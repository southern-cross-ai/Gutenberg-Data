<h2>1. THE SPARK THAT EXPLODED THE MAGAZINE</h2>

<p>When the grandfathers of the present school-children were
studying geography and came to the map of Europe, they found just
north of Greece a broad band of country extending from the Black
Sea to the Adriatic which was called Turkey. It was bounded on the
north by the Save River, but at the northeast it stretched far up
along the east side of the Carpathian Mountains. This was "Turkey
in Europe," but the Turks ruled a much larger territory in Asia,
just across the Straits of Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The original home of the Turks was in Persia. They had gradually
pushed on to the westward, until they held Asia Minor,
Constantinople, and much of what is now known as the Balkan States.
They had forced their way to the north and had even besieged
Vienna. Then came struggles with Russia. Russia was successful, but
the other European countries feared that she might become so
powerful as to threaten them, and so made her give up most of her
Turkish conquests. Europe wanted the Turks driven back into Asia,
but no state was willing that any other state should become heir to
their territory. An attack upon them would be likely to bring on a
general European war. That is why no one ventured to interfere in
1895, when the Turks, who are Mohammedans, massacred tens of
thousands of Armenian Christians.</p>

<p>In Turkey in Europe there were several small nations. They were
inclined to quarrel among themselves, but on one point they agreed,
namely, they all hated their ruler and meant to get free. Greece
had freed herself long before Germany began the present war, and
one by one most of the other little nations had declared their
independence. Bosnia and Herzegovina had fallen into the hands of
Austria-Hungary and were helpless. In 1878, after a war between
Russia and Turkey, the Treaty of Berlin had been signed, which
allowed Austria-Hungary to "occupy" and rule these two countries.
In 1908, she announced that she should retain them as permanent
parts of her empire. This was not according to the treaty, but for
one reason or another nothing was done to prevent it.</p>

<p>The Balkan peoples&mdash;for the district took its name from the
Balkan Mountains&mdash;were all excellent fighters, and if they had
held together and been willing to yield a point to one another now
and then, they could have driven the Turks out of Macedonia and
Albania, and perhaps even across the Bosphorus. "Those peoples will
never unite," said the wiseheads of Europe; but in 1912 the
unexpected happened, the little countries did unite, and they drove
the Turks so far toward the Bosphorus that they had nothing left in
Europe but Constantinople and a little of the country west of that
city.</p>

Bulgaria surrendered to the Allies, September, 1918</p>

<hr>

<p>But now the Balkan countries began to quarrel again. Bulgaria
did not think there had been a fair division of the land that she
had won in the struggle. The result was that they had a little war
of a few weeks among themselves, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, and
Rumania lining up against Bulgaria, and winning the day.</p>

<p>In the first war the influence of Germany and Austria had been
in favor of Turkey; in the second war it had been in favor of
Bulgaria. In both wars they had favored the side that lost. Russia
had favored Serbia, and therefore was on the side that won. Not
long before the Balkan Wars, the interests of France and Germany in
Morocco had clashed, and France had come off victor. Within a few
years, then, Russia and France had gained in prestige, while
Germany and Austria-Hungary had lost. It was practically certain
that as soon as an opportunity appeared, the last two countries
would try to make themselves more powerful.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the people of the Balkans are a quick-tempered
folk; and whatever strikes them as showing the least shade of
injustice, they are ready to resent&mdash;with a gun. Indeed, in
many districts, the inhabitants have such a relish for gunpowder
that they delight in using it to welcome their friends as well as
to make away with their enemies. Like the Russians they belong to
the great Slavic family, but they are of different nations and
origins.</p>

<p>In the Balkan States there is much that is beautiful. There are
grand old mountains, deep green valleys, wide fields of swaying
grain, and everywhere there are flowers. Bulgaria is so well
adapted to the growing of roses that they are raised there by the
million to make the delicious attar of roses; but wherever you go,
there are daisies, wild clematis, poppies, and scores of other
kinds of flowers, and the summer air is always sweet with the
perfume of the honeysuckle.</p>

<p>Serbia is called the "poor man's paradise." In many parts of the
country there are two crops a year, and the soil is so rich that a
very little land will support a family. There are gypsies who
wander about and beg and tell fortunes, but there are no
poorhouses, and it is exceedingly rare to find a really needy
person.</p>

<p>The capital of Serbia was Belgrade. It was a clean white city,
and stood high up on a hill, looking far away to the mountains on
the horizon. At the foot of the hill the Save River meets the
Danube and sweeps half around the town. In the streets were trolley
cars and also lumbering ox-carts drawn by the biggest and slowest
of oxen. There were peasants just in from the country, the men
wearing sheepskin coats, fur inside, and the women in short skirts
of blue or cream-colored homespun, and always displaying an apron
gorgeous with bright embroidery. On féte days the women sometimes
wore long velvet coats embroidered with gold thread and fastened
with gold buttons as big as marbles.</p>

<p>The Serbians were as independent in dress as in other matters,
and when parliament was in session, some of the members wore
handsome frock coats and fine linen, while others appeared in their
sheep-skin coats or whatever else they might choose. They were not
ignorant, these roughly clad farmers, and many of them had very
good incomes; but they saw no reason for changing their garb to
suit the whim of any one else. Many of them sent their sons to the
university. They were a kindly folk, pleasant and hospitable, and
proud of keeping their word. They loved their ballads and fairy
legends; they sang the magnificent old chants in their churches;
they said a bit of a prayer when they kindled their fires; and when
they went to battle, they were the bravest of the brave.</p>

<p>There were two things that the Balkan peoples wanted with their
whole hearts. One was to be free from Turkish rule; and this they
had succeeded in bringing about. The other was quite a different
matter, for they were not satisfied to be divided by mountains and
rivers and political boundaries; they wanted to include in each
state all the people of the same nationality. This would have been
difficult enough even if they had been willing to keep within the
limits of the group of states, but that would not answer their
purpose. East of Rumania, for instance, was Bessarabia. Here lived
many Rumanians; but of course Russia had no idea of giving up this
fertile district, larger than Switzerland, just to accommodate
Rumania. West of Rumania, in eastern Hungary, there was the same
condition, for here too lived many Rumanians, and Austria-Hungary
would not for a moment consider surrendering this part of her
territory.</p>

<p>With Serbia matters were even worse. Her one great wish was to
bring the Serbs under one rule by uniting Serbia, Montenegro, and
the two provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were in the
hands of Austria-Hungary. If this had come to pass, Serbia would
have been somewhat larger than the State of Michigan. Moreover, she
would have won access to the sea, and would no longer have been
obliged to get permission of her neighbors when she wished to send
her products to market.</p>

<p>This is the way it stood with the Balkan nations at the end of
1913. None of them were contented. Bulgaria was angry because in
the settlement after the war so much of the land which she had won
from Turkey had been taken from her. Bosnia and Herzegovina were
enraged at having been made a part of Austria-Hungary. Serbia was
perhaps the most wrathful of all, for she was left with no hope of
uniting the Serbian race. Moreover, in order to appease
Austria-Hungary a port on the Adriatic which Serbia had captured
had been taken from her, thus leaving her with no approach to the
sea. The Balkan States had long been called the "powder magazine of
Europe," and now the magazine was all ready to explode.</p>

<p>The spark that exploded the magazine flashed out in Serajevo,
the capital of Bosnia. This is a wide-awake little city, whose
inhabitants make a vast amount of pottery and metal ware, dye and
weave silk, and carry on a large trade. It is a pleasant town. A
river runs through it, and gardens are all around. Some fine modern
buildings have been erected, and in contrast with them there are,
high up on a hill overlooking the city, picturesque ruins of the
stone walls of a castle seven centuries or more old.</p>

<p>One beautiful June day in 1914, a gentleman and his wife were
riding in procession in Serajevo. The mayor of the place stood
waiting in the town hall, all ready to make his address of welcome,
for the gentleman was the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, nephew of the
Emperor of Austria, and was himself heir to the Austrian throne.
Suddenly a bomb exploded directly behind their automobile,
evidently aimed at the Archduke and his wife. They were not harmed,
but the occupants of the car following them, part of their escort,
were fatally injured. Some hours later, while the royal guests were
on their way to the hospital to inquire for the wounded, a student
of only eighteen years sprang out of the crowd and threw a bomb at
their car. This failed to explode. The young man then drew a
revolver and fired three shots, two of which struck the Archduke
and the third his wife. Both died within an hour.</p>

<p>Emerson writes, in his <i>Concord Hymn</i>, of the Massachusetts
farmers who "fired the shot heard round the world," and surely this
shot at Serajevo was heard round the world. The assassin belonged
in Herzegovina, in Bosnia, but he had been living in Serbia, in
Belgrade, and the Austro-Hungarian papers declared at once that
Serbian influence had made him a murderer. They demanded that
Serbia should be punished.</p>

<p>For one whole month Austria-Hungary plotted and prepared. Then a
note was sent to Serbia. This accused the Serbian Government of
planning or at least conniving at the assassination, and demanded
that Serbia should suppress all newspapers and societies unfriendly
to Austria-Hungary, and cut out from the public schools all
teaching tending to the same result and to any thought of a
possible future union under Serbian rule. It demanded the arrest
and punishment of all connected with the crime, especially two men
who were mentioned by name, one an officer in the army. It demanded
that Austria-Hungary should share in the investigation of the
conspiracy. Austria-Hungary had taken a month to prepare this note,
but she required Serbia to present her reply within forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p>Then the telegraph wires began to hum, and messages whizzed back
and forth among the diplomats in the attempt on the part of several
countries to avert war. England did not want war, neither did
France, nor did Serbia's "big brother," Russia, and the little
country was urged to return as conciliatory a reply as possible.
Serbia put her pride into her pocket and yielded, but required that
if any one was to be punished, proof should be given of his crime.
One demand, however, she refused flatly, a demand to which no
self-respecting country could yield. This was that Austria-Hungary
should take part in the investigation of the conspiracy. She
expressed her willingness, however, to leave the whole question to
the Hague Court in case this reply should not be satisfactory. This
was given to the Austro-Hungarian Minister within the forty-eight
hours, and although Sir Edward Grey, English Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, declared that this reply was the greatest
humiliation he had ever seen a country undergo, the Minister said
that it could not be accepted, as Serbia had not yielded to the
demands in every particular, and that same day he and his staff
left Belgrade.</p>

<p>War between Serbia and Austria-Hungary now seemed unavoidable,
but why need the other states of Europe have anything to do with
it? Why, if there must be conflict between the two countries, could
they not fight it out and leave the rest of the world in peace? The
answer is, "Because of the aims of Germany and because of the
Eastern Question." At the outbreak of the war few people thought
much about any possible aims of Germany, but they thought a great
deal about the Eastern Question, that is, the relations of Turkey
and the Balkan States with the rest of Europe, especially Russia,
Austria-Hungary, and England.</p>

<p>Russia is an enormous country. That portion of it which is in
Europe is one fourth larger than all the rest of the Continent. It
is a land of almost endless resources. It is rich in minerals and
precious stones; it raises flax, hemp, timber, cotton, and
quantities of sugar beets, besides great numbers of cattle, horses,
sheep, hogs, and goats. It has millions of acres of the best wheat
land in the world. Of course the Russian winters are long and cold
and the summers are short; but when summer does come, it is so hot
that vegetation grows wonderfully fast.</p>

<p>Naturally, after Russia has produced all these valuable
articles, she wants to sell them to other nations. Then come
difficulties, for transportation is not good. If Russia had as many
miles of railroads in proportion to her size as France has, the big
country would have six and one half times as much mileage as at
present. She has rivers and canals, and at the north she has
harbors, but from three to six months of every year all these are
closed by ice. On the Black Sea she has her port of Odessa, but to
carry her goods out of the Black Sea her ships must pass through
the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which are controlled by Turkey.
Russia, then, would be glad to have the Turks pushed over into Asia
Minor. As to Serbia, her "little brother," both Russians and
Serbians are of the same family of nations, the Slavic, and while
Russia would hardly have wished Serbia to become powerful enough to
rule all the Balkan States, she could not endure the thought of her
becoming a part of Austria-Hungary, and thus enormously increasing
the Austrian and the German power.</p>

<p>Germany had long felt what is called the "Drang nach Osten,"
that is, the <i>push toward the East</i>, for trade, agriculture,
and colonization. She had already, as has been said, secured the
right to build a railway from the Bosphorus to Baghdad, and had
built one third of it. A "middle Europe" combination, consisting of
Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Balkan countries, and Turkey, would
open Germany's way to Baghdad, to the Far East, and to the rich
lands of southeastern Russia, the Ukraine. With Turkey Germany had
made friends; Herzegovina had become a part of Germany's ally,
Austria-Hungary; nothing blocked her way but the other Balkan
countries, especially Serbia. If Serbia, then, fell under German
control, Russia must give up all hope of ever holding
Constantinople, and she had strong reason to fear losing the
Ukraine, which was somewhat restless under Russian rule, and no one
could say how much more of her territory. It is no wonder that,
when Austria-Hungary threatened Serbia, Russia made her prompt
declaration, "On the day that Austrian troops cross the boundary
line of Serbia, Russian troops will mass for war."</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary is a combination of two countries, ruled by one
man, but independent in many respects. Delegations from the
parliaments of the two countries meet one year in Vienna in
Austria, and the following year in Budapest in Hungary. These
delegations settle questions of national finance of war, and of
foreign relations. Other matters are settled by each country for
itself. Each half of the "Dual Monarchy" is made up of numerous
small states. No one of these forgets that it was once independent,
and its people do their best to maintain their old language and
their old customs. They have formed one kingdom, but they have
never formed any real union. Indeed, neither Austria nor Hungary is
a closely united state. In Austria, about one fourth of the
inhabitants are Germans; but the government is so ordered that they
are in control. In Hungary, the Magyar aristocracy hold the ruling
power. In each state the Slavs are the "under dog." They have no
political power, and small attention is paid to their interests or
wishes. These Slavs belong to the great Aryan family whose home was
in central Asia. They form nearly one half of the population of
Austria-Hungary, but they are of many nations, and each little
group cling together and look upon others with some jealousy and
often with dislike.</p>

<p>The different peoples in the Dual Monarchy are discontented, and
the two kingdoms are not happy together. Their union was formed
merely as a matter of convenience. Between two and three centuries
ago there were, instead of one Germany, two hundred or more tiny
states, which were supposed to owe some allegiance to the Emperor
of Austria. It was not a willing allegiance; nevertheless, a sort
of union was at length formed with Austria at its head. But
Prussia, one of these states, grew strong and began to rival
Austria. The Prussian statesman Bismarck now brought it about that
a confederation was formed with Prussia as its head and Austria
left out. Then came the war with France in 1870, during which this
confederation was changed into an empire, and William I,
grandfather of the present Kaiser, and already King of Prussia, was
proclaimed German Emperor. Neither Austria nor Hungary was quite
strong enough to stand alone, and therefore they formed the twofold
monarchy. Moreover, in 1879, Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an
alliance for mutual defense. A little later, Italy joined them.
This union was known as the Triple Alliance.</p>

<p>A war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia would serve Germany
well, for of course the big country would subdue the little one,
and the way to Constantinople would be open. But if Russia entered
the fray, that was quite another matter, for if Russia gained power
in the Balkans, Germany's plans for the Far East would fall
through. Therefore, if Russia was to protect Serbia, Germany would
enter the war as the ally of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>But what about France? After the Germans defeated France in the
war of 1870, the two provinces, Alsace and Lorraine, had been taken
by Germany, and France felt the need of a friend as a support
against the increasing German power; therefore she had formed an
alliance with Russia, and if Russia fought, France would fight.</p>

<p>Then one more country must be considered, England. It was
England's policy to keep out of "Serbian quarrels," but England had
large interests in the East; she must look out for a clear way to
Egypt, Persia, India, Thibet, and Afghanistan. Those who are in
charge of a country's interests must look far ahead, not only to
what is reasonably certain to happen, but also to what might by any
possibility happen. England had also interests in the
Mediterranean, and she had agreed with France that in case of any
necessity, the French navy should guard those interests. In return,
England was to guard the western shores of France. Then, too, Dover
Strait is hardly more than twenty miles wide at its narrowest
point. If the Triple Alliance should crush France, then Belgium,
then Holland, and so control the English Channel, Dover Strait, and
the North Sea&mdash;England would be hemmed in by enemies. Of
course, no one in England expected these things to come to pass,
but it was the business of her statesmen to be on guard against
whatever might be within the bounds of possibility. Therefore, some
years earlier, England, Russia, and France had made an informal
alliance called the Triple Entente, that is, <i>the triple
understanding or agreement</i>. The object of this was to preserve
the balance of power in Europe against the Triple Alliance. Its
purpose was wholly defensive, for protection against the aggressive
German plans.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, Germany announced her intention of
standing by Austria-Hungary. Italy, as a member of the Triple
Alliance, was bound to stand by Germany and Austria <i>if they were
attacked</i>. They were not attacked, they were making the attack,
and Italy declared her intention to be neutral.</p>

<p>Three days after Serbia handed her reply to the Austro-Hungarian
Minister, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and two days
later she began to bombard Belgrade.</p>

<p>A few months later it came to light that, one whole year before
the Serajevo incident, Austria, certain of the aid of Germany, had
determined to attack Serbia in order to clear the way to the East.
The assassination of the Archduke was the spark that exploded the
powder magazine of Europe; but if that had not occurred, some other
pretext for war would surely have been found.</p>

<a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>
<h2>II. THE DASH TOWARD PARIS</h2>

<p>Two days after the Austrian Minister left Belgrade, a
telegraphic conversation began among the representatives of several
of the countries of Europe, which was in effect as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey, Minister of Foreign Affairs for England: I
invite the German and the Italian Ambassadors to England, as
friends of Austria, to meet the French Ambassador and myself, as
friends of Russia, to try to find a way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Russia, France, and Italy: We will come.</p>

<p>Germany: I could not call Austria in her dispute with Serbia
before a European tribunal.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey: But this would be only a private and informal
discussion.</p>

<p>Germany: It is impossible. But will not France exert a
moderating influence at St. Petersburg?</p>

<p>France: Will not Germany, especially as Serbia has shown herself
so conciliatory, exert a moderating influence upon
Austria-Hungary?</p>

<p>Germany: Oh, no, we have decided not to interfere. Russia and
Austria might discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Austria: I decline.</p>

<p>The Kaiser to the Czar: I urge you to be a spectator only and
not draw all Europe into war.</p>

<p>The Czar: Cannot the Austro-Serbian problem be given over to the
Hague Tribunal?</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey: Will not Austria at least give the other powers
time and opportunity to mediate between Austria and Russia? Will
not Germany "press the button" in the interests of peace?</p>

<p>Russia: If Austria will strike out from her note to Serbia the
demands affecting Serbia's sovereignty, Russia will stop her
military preparations.</p>

<p>Germany: That would be impossible.</p>

<p>Austria: I am ready to discuss the matter with the other
powers.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
But it was too late, as Germany had before this sent her ultimatum
to Russia demanding that within twelve hours Russia cease her
military measures.</p>

<p>The European powers, especially England, had done their best to
prevent war, but their efforts had been in vain. It was evident
that Germany wanted war. Most nations do all in their power to
avoid war; why, then, should this nation be so eager for it? The
answer is, Because she longed for empire. "A place in the sun" had
long been the slogan of the Pan-German party. Jealous of Great
Britain, the Kaiser determined to win by the sword the world empire
to which industrial prosperity at home seemed, in his eyes, to
entitle him. Other large nations had colonies. After a while,
Germany, too, had some colonies; but Germany is a nation of recent
formation, the best places for colonization had already been taken,
and German emigrants did not care to go to the newer settlements.
They made their homes in other countries, among other nations; and
the result was that they or their children often gave up German
citizenship, and their emigration was not, as was the case with
other countries, a gain to the mother country. Then, too, Germany
had but little seacoast. To reach the ocean, her ships must go
around the British Isles or else pass through Dover Strait and sail
within ten miles of either England or France.</p>

<p>Germany had some genuine fear of being crushed by Russia and
France, but for England she had a hatred arising from jealousy.
England held Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, and many islands scattered
over the world. It is true that she threw open her ports to every
nation; but Germany feared her enormous power on the sea and
determined to take from her all possibility of exercising it.
Germany and England were commercial rivals. Germany declared that
England was trying to prevent her from reaching a market, and in
the same breath boasted that she was underselling the English in
England itself.</p>

<p>Between Germany and France there had been great bitterness ever
since the war of 1870. In this war Germany had marched into Paris,
she had seized Alsace and Lorraine and held them. She looked upon
the French as a feeble, worn-out race, and supposed that she could
easily crush them, then crush England, then attend to Russia.</p>

<p>The power at which Germany aimed was nothing less than the rule
of the whole world. She believed that her ideals and customs were
the best on earth, and that she was destined to control the world.
As a beginning, she aimed at a "middle Europe," that is, at winning
a broad belt running from the shores of the North and Baltic Seas,
including Belgium, northern France, Austria-Hungary, the Balkan
States, and a free "corridor" to Baghdad. She would then be well on
her way to the world dominion for which she thirsted. By earlier
wars Germany had gained in size, wealth, and influence, and she
expected to make far greater gains in this war. The
"Junkers"&mdash;that is, the wealthy landed nobility&mdash;longed
for it. Moreover, opposition to autocracy was on the increase, and
in Germany as well as in Austria-Hungary there was much internal
strife. A short and victorious war would do away with this and
unite the people.</p>

<p>Germany was the only country in the world that was prepared for
war. In army, fleet, and munitions she was ready, and the officers
of her "war machine" had long been eager for the time to come. Even
in public banquets her naval chiefs had for many years drunk toasts
to "The Day"&mdash;that is, the day when the Kaiser's new fleet
would meet England's in a war which should finally destroy the
English navy and the British Empire. There was no secrecy about it.
Even little children were taught in school that their country was
"surrounded by cruel and envious nations." Prominent writers and
lecturers had taught that Germans were far superior to other races,
and that the land which others were unfairly keeping from them
would one day be theirs by conquest. They made ready for warfare.
For three years before the war schoolhouses were so built that
almost in a day they could be turned into hospitals.
Machines&mdash;for making ploughs, for instance&mdash;were
especially designed so they could be used in munition work. Not
long before the war, Germany increased her army by sixty per cent,
prepared an unusually large supply of munitions, widened and
deepened the Kiel Canal to accommodate the largest warships, built
more railroads to the Russian, French, and Belgian frontiers,
increased greatly the importation of some articles used in war and
decreased the exportation of others, called home her reservists
from other countries; and only a few weeks before war was declared,
she bought an enormous quantity of hospital supplies. There was no
question who brought on the war.</p>

<p>Germany against Russia, Germany against France, England against
Germany, Austria-Hungary against Russia&mdash;so much for the first
week of warfare. The air fairly hissed with declarations of war, or
rather with declarations that a "state of war" was existing, for
each country wished to make it clear that it was at war only as a
matter of self-defense. The declaration against France stated that
French military aviators had dropped bombs in Germany. On the
following morning Viviani, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs,
declared to the Chamber of Deputies that this was entirely false.
The correctness of his statement has since then been admitted in
Germany.</p>

<p>German troops were at once mobilized&mdash;that is, called into
active service&mdash;and the French troops promptly followed their
example. In tiny French villages drums were beaten as a signal, and
men left their harvest fields on the run, abandoning the half-cut
grain. The oxen gazed at them wonderingly as they sped down the
roads to their homes for the hour of making ready and the hurried
good-byes before they boarded the train for the front, wherever
that might be.</p>

<p>There was another frantic rush, and this was the race of
American tourists to get away from the war. Thousands of them were
scattered over the contending countries. Trains ran, but they had
not room for any one but soldiers. Mails came or not, as it might
happen. Telegraph and telephone wires were cut. To "go west," to
get to America, would be safety, and everybody wanted to sail by
the first steamer.</p>

<p>Moreover, these tourists suddenly found that people would no
longer cash their checks, so that many a man with a letter of
credit in his pocket for thousands of dollars had to beg of some
friend the money to pay for his dinner. But the United States took
care of her wandering citizens. The Government sent over several
million dollars to lend to them and also vessels enough to bring
those home who could not get passage on regular lines.</p>

<p>But the tourists left behind them a continent full of trouble
and anxiety. Just where Germany would strike, no one knew, but
French troops were sent to the northeastern corner of France, just
south of Belgium and Luxemburg, and a few miles away from the
German border line. Luxemburg is a little independent duchy, a sort
of toy kingdom, only four fifths as large as Rhode Island. It was a
"neutralized" state; that is, by a treaty made in 1867, it was
agreed that in case of war Luxemburg would be neutral, would give
no aid to either side, and indeed would maintain no army. In
return, France, England, Russia, and also Prussia, guaranteed her
freedom from any invasion of her territory. Nevertheless, as this
was the easiest road to the heart of France, the German forces took
that road, saying that they would do no harm and that at the end of
the war they would pay for whatever they had found it necessary to
take. Luxemburg had already been violated by the French, they
declared. The President of the Grand Ducal Government said that if
this had been done, he knew nothing about it. The little state
could make no resistance, but there is a report that the plucky
Grand Duchess, an independent young girl of twenty, ran her
automobile squarely across the road up which the German forces were
marching, and indignantly protested against their entrance.</p>

<p>Belgium was also a neutralized state, protected since 1839 by
treaties to which Prussia was a party. She was on friendly terms
with both France and Germany, and only four years previous the
Kaiser and his daughter had been guests of King Albert, ruler of
Belgium, and had been received with every honor. The French
Minister to Belgium had declared that his country would respect
Belgium's neutrality unless it was first violated by the Germans.
The Belgians hoped that Germany would follow the example of France.
But behold, the German Minister announced that the German troops
wished to enter the country. If Belgium was friendly, Germany would
at the close of the war pay for all damages; but if anything was
done to hinder the troops Belgium would be regarded as an enemy.
This was at seven in the evening of August 2. A reply was demanded
within twelve hours.</p>

<p>Of course, the easiest way would have been to say yes and make
no opposition to the coming of the troops. Belgium, however, was
not looking for the easiest way, but for the most honorable. The
little country had promised to be neutral. If she did not now do
her best to prevent either Germany or France from entering her
territory, she would be breaking her promise. The Chamber of
Deputies came together, many of the members already in uniform,
prepared to start for the front at a moment's notice. Before them
stood King Albert, tall, calm, and dignified. "I ask you,
gentlemen," he said, "are you absolutely resolved to maintain
intact the sacred patrimony of your fathers?" They were
resolved.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Cabinet and Ministers of State held another
meeting, and decided to appeal for help to England, France, and
Russia, who, together with Prussia, had guaranteed the neutrality
of their country. On the following day German troops entered
Belgium, and the appeal was sent.</p>

<p>This had been a busy day in England as well as in Belgium.
England had asked Germany to assure her before midnight that the
neutrality of Belgium would be respected. The German Chancellor and
the British Ambassador to Germany had held a meeting. "It is
terrible," said the Chancellor, "that just for a
word&mdash;'Neutrality'&mdash;just for a scrap of paper [that is,
the treaty]&mdash;Great Britain is going to make war upon a kindred
nation who desires nothing better than to be friends with her." No
answer was made to England's question. That night she declared
war.</p>

<p>England had three reasons for entering the war. First, to keep
her word to protect Belgium; second, to stand by her agreement with
France; third, to protect herself. She was forced to the conviction
that she would have to fight either in company with France and
Russia or else, later, alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, German forces were streaming into Belgium. On the
border line of France, south of Luxemburg, were forts and French
troops. To pass these would be no easy matter; but with Belgium in
her hands, Germany could mass her troops and supplies in that
country. They pushed in toward the city of Liege. The Belgians tore
up railways and blew up bridges as best they could; but the Germans
built new bridges, and soon they were not far from the nine forts
that stood on the heights above Liege. These forts commanded river,
bridges, roads, and railroads, and until they were taken, German
troops and supplies could not be brought into the town.</p>

<p>The forts resisted stubbornly, and the Belgian troops fought
resolutely. Of course the little country could not withstand the
big one, and within twenty-one days after the first German soldiers
entered Belgium, they had taken Brussels, and a little later they
forced the inhabitants to give them $40,000,000. They had also
captured wonderful Louvain with its famous old churches, its superb
cathedral, and its great university. The Germans declared that some
of the people of Louvain fired upon them. Even if the charge is
true, the revenge taken by the invaders was visited not upon these
people only, but upon the whole town, for the city was now sacked
and burned, and the famous university with its priceless library
was ruthlessly destroyed.</p>

<p>Like the Roman hero in the story of Horatius at the bridge,
Belgium with her slender might had held back the hostile armies.
The Chancellor of Germany said of the invasion, "This is a breach
of international law, but necessity knows no law." Belgium had lost
her treasures, her cities, her homes, but she had done the noblest
thing in the world, she had kept her word even to her own hurt.</p>

<p>Those were the times when every day counted. The resistance of
Belgium delayed the invaders for two weeks. Neither France nor
England was prepared for war, but this delay gave them time to
bring up their standing armies and hurl them into Belgium. The plan
of the Germans was already formed. They promptly seized bases over
the French line and aimed at making a sudden dash upon Paris.
Belgians, French, and English were driven by the Germans, back,
back, back, until they came to the Marne River.</p>

<p>But in Paris a quiet man with a genial, trustworthy face had
been hard at work. He was the son of people who lived in the
Pyrenees, and had made his way into a military school. He was not
remembered at school for any special brilliancy, but he was
remembered as a good scholar who never shirked or grumbled and
always did his best. He had risen slowly from one position to
another, until, three years before the opening of the war, he had
become commander-in-chief of the French army; but he was so modest
and unassuming that few people knew much about him. This quiet
soldier, General Joffre, had collected half a million men, had
chosen a battle-field on the Marne, and there he awaited the enemy.
They came nearer and nearer. "Paris within a week!" had been their
cry, and now Paris was almost in sight, only twenty-three miles
away. Then came the battle of the Marne, not one battle, but a
series of terrible engagements over a battle-line one hundred and
forty miles long. Years ago a book was written called <i>The
Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</i>. One more will have to be
added to the list&mdash;the battle of the Marne. The German forces
were turned back and were pursued hotly to the banks of the
sluggish Aisne River. The French dashed across the stream, and the
Germans drove them back. There was no victory for either side.
Germany still held a long strip of the land of France, but she had
not taken Paris.</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>
<h2>III. "KITCHENER'S MOB"</h2>

<p>During the first two months of the war, two new countries joined
the Allies besides those that have been named, Japan and
Montenegro. Japan had before this made an agreement to stand by
England, in the East; but she had also two strong reasons of her
own for wishing to have a hand in the struggle. One was to win the
friendship of Russia, so Russia would not interfere with her
occupation of Korea and Manchuria; the other was to get possession
of the district of Kiao-chau in China, and probably by returning it
to China to make a firm alliance with the Chinese nation.</p>

<p>Some years earlier two German missionaries had been murdered in
China, and in reprisal Germany had seized Kiao-chau and obliged the
Chinese to give her a lease of the district for ninety-nine years
together with other valuable privileges. Japan lost no time in
sending her ultimatum, or <i>last word</i>, to Germany, advising
her, in the interests of peace, to deliver up Kiao-chau within a
certain number of days. The Japanese have a keen sense of humor,
and they must have enjoyed writing this ultimatum, for they modeled
it, phrase for phrase, upon one which Germany had sent to Japan,
requiring her to give up some territory which she had taken in a
war with China. Germany made no reply, and Japan promptly began a
bombardment. Kiao-chau surrendered.</p>

<p>Montenegro, "glorious, immortal Montenegro," as Gladstone called
it, is a tiny kingdom whose capital Cettinje is perched on a
mountain-top thousands of feet above the Adriatic Sea. There is a
story that an emperor of Austria once said to a prince of
Montenegro, "My brother the prince lives high." "True," replied the
prince, "my brother the emperor has taken all the sea, the Turks
have taken all the land; so there is nothing left for me but the
sky." The Montenegrins have always been famous as fighters and as
patriots, and for centuries they maintained their freedom by
frequent struggles with the Turks. They are a proud, honorable
people, hospitable and courteous and brave as lions. They are Serbs
by race, and they promptly joined Serbia in the war against
Austria. Many Montenegrins were living in Canada when the war broke
out, and as they could not reach their own country, they enlisted
with the Canadian forces.</p>

<p>For many years Germany had been at work to gain control over
Turkey. The Kaiser himself had paid a visit to Constantinople, and
had declared himself to be the firm friend of all Mohammedans.
Indeed, a story was spread throughout Turkey that he had become a
convert to the faith of Mohammed. In the Balkan Wars, German
officers aided the Turks. When the "Young Turks" brought about a
revolution in 1908, Germany was more than ready to give her advice
and help, to drill the Turkish troops, to provide officers and
equipment, and little by little to get control into her own hands.
"When our government is in shape, we shall say good-bye to
Germany," declared the Young Turks; but Germany's aims were quite
different. She wanted, first, a Turkish decree permitting her to
build a railroad to Baghdad, which should open the way for Germany
in the East; and this she had already obtained; second, she wanted
Turkey, when "the day" should arrive, to be a well-trained and
obedient military ally.</p>

<p>On the day that Germany began the war, Turkey signed a secret
treaty with Germany, and, although posing as a neutral, soon began
to perform unneutral acts. She closed the Dardanelles, thus cutting
off Russia from communication with her allies, and she bombarded
Russian seaports on the Black Sea. Moreover, when two of Germany's
fastest cruisers were in danger of capture in the Mediterranean Sea
and reached the closed Dardanelles, they hoisted the Turkish flag
and sailed through into safety, as they had been ordered by
wireless to do. By German trickery there had been a mock sale of
the cruisers to Turkey, who could not possibly pay for them. So it
was that she was forced into the war and was now in the power of
Germany. There is a story that a Turk said, in friendly fashion to
a Belgian then in Constantinople, "I have terrible news for you;
the Germans have captured Brussels." "But I have even more terrible
news for you," said the Belgian, pointing to the two cruisers lying
at anchor. "The Germans have captured Turkey."</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1914 ten nations had entered the
struggle. If a formal declaration of war had been necessary to
precede fighting, matters would have been in a queer state of
confusion. Japan, for instance, had declared war against Germany,
but Germany had not declared war on Japan. Germany and
Austria-Hungary had declared war on Belgium, but Belgium had simply
tried her best to defend herself, and had not stopped for any
declaration of her purposes. At the end of 1914 Germany and
Austria-Hungary and their friend Turkey stood against England,
France, Belgium, Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Japan.</p>

<p>Almost every country of the world maintains a standing army, and
in nearly all countries men are obliged to prepare themselves for
war and to serve as soldiers if there is need. In Germany, for
instance, every able-bodied young man is required to begin his
military training at the age of twenty, and he may be called upon
at seventeen. For seven years he is a member of, first, the
standing army, and then of the reserves. Of course, this does not
mean that he is under arms for seven years except in war-time.
Cavalrymen and artillerymen are in service three years, others two
years. Students who have passed a state examination are required to
serve but one year. At the age of twenty-seven, the German becomes
a member of the home guards. Twelve years later, he is put into a
force known as the <i>Landsturm</i>; and here, for six years
longer, or until he is forty-five, he may be called upon in any
emergency for such services as guarding bridges or military
supplies.</p>

<p>In the matter of equipment, too, Germany is thoroughly
systematized. When the call was given to mobilize, every man in the
land knew in just which storehouse his equipment was kept. His
clothes, shoes, hat, etc., had all been tried on before, so there
was no delay in finding a fit. All that he had to do was to walk
into the storehouse, say, "I am Fritz &mdash;&mdash;," or, "I am
number &mdash;&mdash;," and receive a large bundle, which he
carried off to a dressing-room. In this bundle were two uniforms
complete with leggings, trousers, shoes, and underwear. There were
also four pairs of socks, a hat, blankets, housewife or "comfort
bag," and a brass tag stamped with his official number. He put the
cord of the brass tag around his neck, dressed himself, made up the
rest of his equipment into one roll to carry with him, and the
clothes in which he came into another to leave with the clerk. His
rifle, belt, and ammunition he got either at the same building or
another, but just as quickly; and in a few minutes the civilian had
become a soldier all ready to march to battle.</p>

<p>England, however, had never introduced compulsory service. Her
troops were made up of men who had volunteered to serve. The result
of the two methods was that in Germany, when the war broke out,
every man had been trained as a soldier. In less than two years
England had to resort to conscription, but at the beginning of the
war she had only her small standing army to fall back upon for
immediate service. This is why she could send only 150,000 troops
to aid the French in the battle of the Marne. Evidently a large
force must be raised as soon as possible, and the business was put
into the hands of "Kitchener of Khartum."</p>

<p>Earl Kitchener was an Irishman of brilliant military genius,
which he had proved many times, but especially in the capture of
Khartum in the Sudan. He now went to work to create the largest
volunteer army in the history of the world. Men enlisted, but arms,
equipment, even uniforms, were wanting. Before long, clothes were
sometimes fastened together with shoestrings and safety pins, and
shoes without holes were almost unknown. "All men needing boots,
one pace forward, march!" the quartermaster once commanded a
company, and the whole company moved briskly and hopefully forward.
But only a single dozen pairs had arrived, and these were in just
two sizes. The British soldier, whom his country nicknames "Tommy
Atkins," has a keen sense of humor, and he promptly dubbed himself
and his companions "Kitchener's Mob." Indeed, as far as outfit
went, the "Mob" were hardly better off than the little ragamuffins
of the town who paraded up and down the streets of London with
paper caps and wooden swords, gravely bearing a banner with the
legend, "We will fight for our country and defend the King." Among
those who wished to enlist were many who were under the regulation
height. Kitchener suggested that they form a division of their own.
These were nicknamed the "Bantams."</p>

<p>Earl Kitchener was a silent man, and he was not much given to
letter-writing, but when his "Mob" was ready to embark its first
troops for "somewhere in France," each man received a copy of his
letter to the troops ordered abroad. This said in part:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">You are ordered abroad as a soldier of the
King to help our French comrades against the invasion of a common
enemy. You have to perform a task which will need your courage,
your energy, your patience. Remember that the honor of the British
Army depends upon your individual conduct...You can do your country
no better service than in showing yourself, in France and Belgium,
in the true character of a British soldier.<br>
<br>
Be invariably courteous, considerate, and kind. Never do anything
likely to injure or destroy property, and always look upon looting
as a disgraceful act. You are sure to meet with a welcome and to be
trusted; and your conduct must justify that welcome and that
trust.<br>
<br>
&gt;Do your duty bravely.<br>
Fear God.<br>
Honor the King.<br>
<br>
Kitchener<br>
<i>Field-Marshal</i></p>

<p>"Kitchener's Mob" had become Kitchener's army, and when they
went into battle, it was said of them, "Nothing stops them except
being killed." Less than two years after the breaking-out of the
war, Earl Kitchener was on his way to Russia on war business for
the nation. His vessel either struck a mine or was torpedoed not
far from the Orkney Islands. It was hard to think of the energetic
soldier as quiet in death, and a myth quickly arose that he had
been captured by a German submarine and was kept a prisoner in
Germany.</p>

<p>When Kitchener's men reached the front, they found quite a
different sort of warfare from any in which Englishmen had ever
been engaged before. Modern explosives are of such terrific power
that forts cannot withstand them. Bodies of men, advancing in
regular formation, would be mowed down like grass. This led to
"trench fighting." The general plan of the trench is a deep zigzag
ditch stretching along on the front toward the enemy. Somewhat
parallel with this and fourteen or fifteen yards behind it is a
second trench, connected with the first by many passageways. In the
walls of the second trench recesses were dug to serve as berths for
the men; and running back from it were deep and narrow blind alleys
in which they could take refuge when the bombs became too furious.
Here and there were shell-proof "dug-outs," twenty feet or more
under ground. In some of the captured German dug-outs, evidently
meant for officers and prepared for a long residence, there were
armchairs, electric lights, ventilating fans, bookcases, rugs, and
even wall-paper. One dug-out is described by the soldiers as large
enough to hold several thousand men. It had been a quarry, but now
it contained, besides places for the men, a first-aid hospital, and
a cooperative store. Later, the "pill-boxes" were introduced. These
are turrets of concrete and steel, connected by short trenches.
They give much better protection against barrage fire than do the
open trenches. Both trenches and pill-boxes are protected from
infantry attack by extensive barbed-wire entanglements.</p>

<p>As the war progressed, a captured trench became almost as
dangerous as one occupied by the enemy, for the Germans left their
trenches full of traps. Cutting a thread might explode a detonator.
A piece of equipment left with scraps, an empty shell, a helmet,
bayonet, anything that would be likely to attract a soldier's
notice was risky to touch. Later, the brutal traps used for
catching bears were sometimes chained firmly in No Man's Land in
the hope of catching an opponent between their steel teeth.</p>

<p>When a trench was dry, it was fairly endurable, even though
great fat lazy rats roamed through it at their own will; but when
it was wet&mdash;! It is no wonder that the irrepressible Tommy
sang,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"I never knew till now how muddy mud is,<br>
I never knew how muddy mud could be."</p>

<p>The Irish especially were full of pranks. In one terrific charge
the members of the London Rugby Club kicked a football before them
as they made the first dash. "On the ball, London Irish!" they
shouted, and those who were not brought down by the storm of
bullets actually kicked that ball straight into the enemy's
trenches, which they captured with a jubilant shout of "Goal!" In
another dash up a hill in the face of machine guns in full blast
during the struggle near the Aisne, a tall Irish Guardsman rushed
on in front of the line, flourishing the green flag, which he had
tied round the barrel of his rifle, and shouting, "Ireland
forever!"</p>

<p>Soon a double line of such trenches as have been described
extended from the North Sea to Switzerland, one line held by the
Germans, the other by the French and what the Kaiser called "the
contemptible little English army." This line swayed from time to
time a few miles toward Germany or a few miles toward France, as
the case might be. The Germans overran nearly all of Belgium and
twice made an effort to break through the French and English lines
in that country, once at the Yser River in the attempt to reach
Calais, and once at Ypres, which the disrespectful Tommy insisted
upon pronouncing "Wipers." The attempts to reach Calais and Paris
were unsuccessful. On the other hand, the Germans held Belgium and
also northeastern France, the portion of France which is rich in
coal and iron.</p>

<p>It was at Ypres that Tommy discovered an old printing-house with
paper and ink, and in the spirit of conservation he set to work to
publish a paper which he called the <i>Wipers Times</i>. It advises
its subscribers to insure against submarines; describes the trench
as "the best-ventilated hall in town"; advertises quack medicines
warranted to cure cold feet; asks the loan of an umbrella as a
protection against taking cold when going out to cut barbed wire;
and finally bursts into verse and thus describes home life in the
trenches:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Take a wilderness of ruin,<br>
Spread with mud quite six feet deep;<br>
In this mud now cut some channels,<br>
Then you have the line we keep.<br>
<br>
"Now you get some wire that's spiky,<br>
Throw it round outside your line;<br>
Get some pickets, drive in tightly,<br>
And round these your wire entwine,<br>
<br>
"Get a lot of Huns and plant them<br>
In a ditch across the way;<br>
Now you have war in the making,<br>
As waged here from day to day."</p>

<p>But Tommy is not all fun, and he closes with,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Oft we're told 'Remember Belgium,' In the years
that are to be; Crosses set by all her ditches Are our pledge of
memory."</p>

<p>This was the condition of things on what came to be called the
Western Front. There was also an Eastern Front, which gradually
extended itself from Riga on the Gulf of Riga to the Black Sea. The
Russians could not make their way into France, but they kept so
much going on in the east that German troops had to be withdrawn
from the Western Front and sent against them. Poland, in the
western part of Russia, thrusts a square wedge between Germany and
Austria. It looks on the map like an easy route for the Russians
into the heart of the enemy's country; but the Grand Duke Nicholas
knew very well that if he took it, the Germans could come from the
north and the Austrians from the south and crush his forces between
them; therefore he marched straight into the part of Germany which
extends farthest into Russia. Now, there was in Germany a retired
general, Von Hindenburg, who had long amused the military folk of
the country by insisting that in case of war this region would be
of the utmost importance. He made it such, for there he won a great
victory over the Russian troops. No one smiled at Von Hindenburg's
notions again.</p>

<p>Another army of Russians made a successful drive into Galicia,
in northeastern Hungary. Unluckily for them, they were not so
cautious as they were brave, and they were nearly destroyed by the
German von Mackensen. They tried it again with fresh troops, and
now they took Lemberg and began the siege of the unpronounceable
Przemysl. This held out until well into 1915. Meanwhile, the
Germans had made a drive into Poland and were aiming at Warsaw; but
like Przemysl this did not change masters until 1915.</p>

<p>The Western and the Eastern were the two principal fronts, but
as the war continued, other fronts developed. Just before the
Germans occupied Louvain, the Austrians made a dash into Serbia,
but were driven back. A second time they attacked Serbia, and from
across the Danube they bombarded Belgrade into ruins and pushed on
victoriously. Suddenly, as in Hawthorne's story of "The Gray
Champion," there came galloping straight into the midst of the
battle-field the white-haired Serbian King. More than forty years
earlier King Peter had fought for the French in the Franco-Prussian
War. Three times he had been captured by the Germans, and three
times he had escaped. No fear had he of Prussian or Austrian, and
he led his troops in so furious and unexpected an attack that the
whole Austrian army retreated to their own country. Serbia's fall
was yet to come, but for a year she was safe.</p>

<p>Germany had planned to become mistress of the seas. She had
built the famous Kiel Canal, so that her war vessels could pass
easily from the Baltic into the North Sea without having to go
around Denmark; and here much of her fleet was gathered. In July,
1914, England had held in the English Channel a review of her
warships, 215 in all. They had not dispersed, and so, the moment
that war broke out, they were ready to do their part, and they
bottled up the German fleet in Wilhelmshaven, west of the Kiel
Canal. A few cruisers and torpedo boats escaped the patrol. Any one
who knows the career of the German commerce raider Emden, how she
destroyed shipping to the value of $10,000,000 before she was sunk
by an Australian war vessel, can guess what damage the whole German
navy might have done had it not been for the prompt action of the
British fleet.</p>

<p>At the end of 1914, England still ruled the seas, but Germany
had acquired nearly all of Belgium, about one tenth of France, and
part of Russian Poland. At the Eastern Front, as at the Western,
the war seemed to have come to a deadlock. The Russians had done
excellent work not only in driving the Austrians out of the passes
of the Carpathian Mountains, but in occupying the greater part of
Austrian Galicia. The results of the war for 1914 have been summed
up in one sentence&mdash;"Germany had failed to conquer Europe, but
Europe had made no progress toward conquering her."</p>

<h2>IV. MODERN METHODS OF WARFARE</h2>

<p>If some dead soldier of our Civil War could come to life and see
the present methods of carrying on warfare, he would be far more
dazed than Rip Van Winkle ever was. The trench system has already
been spoken of. The use of camouflage, the disguise or concealment
of objects of war, is not new by any means, but it never was so
elaborately done before. Trenches are concealed by sods and
branches of trees; vessels are painted, the lower part of the hull
to look like waves, the upper in sky-blue; an apparently solid rock
in a field may prove to be a gray canvas protection for a man with
a gun. A little ammunition shelter was decorated with a picture of
a hen and her chicks, and it easily passed for a hen-coop. The
Emden changed her paint and set up an extra smokestack to persuade
the English that she was one of their own cruisers. The English
retaliated in kind by secretly building dummy dreadnaughts of wood,
which lay idly in the harbors while the real dreadnaughts were
serenely acting as convoy for transports.</p>

<p>Barbed wire has proved a better defense than stone walls. These
can be easily shattered, but barbed wire, stretched from post to
post in wild entanglements, "looking as if they had been woven by a
crazy spider," is slow to yield, even to a storm of shrapnel. It
can be cut, of course, but this is rather a dangerous proceeding
when under a brisk fire from the enemy. Moreover, the wire is
sometimes charged with a high power of electricity, and then any
attempt at cutting it has two chances of proving fatal.</p>

<p>Machine guns have proved of great general value, though they
look anything but dangerous, "so small, so fine, and such bits of
workmanship that one would think to see them that they were a
child's playthings."</p>

<p>The famous French "75's" are light in weight, but in general
artillery has been growing larger and larger and able to throw
shells at a constantly increasing distance. The man who fires the
gun has sometimes not even a glimpse of what he is trying to hit.
His orders come from the man with a view, who is perhaps hidden in
some innocent-looking farm-house on a distant hill, far away from
the scene of action, perhaps skillfully camouflaged in the top of a
tree, perhaps high up in an airplane, whence he can "wireless" down
his directions for the aim.</p>

<p>A weapon revived by the Germans from the Greek fire of ancient
times is liquid fire, made of pitch and gasoline or similar
substances. A large stream of this fire is started, then a small
stream of some mixture that catches fire on reaching the air. This
is so timed that it kindles the large stream at whatever moment the
man in charge wishes. Besides the heat and flame, this causes a
suffocating smell and a heavy smoke.</p>

<p>Even worse than liquid fire is the poison gas set free when the
wind is in the right direction to blow it over the trenches of the
enemy. It is heavier than air, and so sinks down into the trenches.
Other gases are put into shells which burst on reaching the
trenches. These gases not only kill men, but often, if they escape
death, injure the lungs and cause years of suffering. Scientific
men, however, soon invented masks, which, unless the soldier is
caught unawares, will protect him from injury. Poison gas is
strictly forbidden by the Articles of the Hague, but was introduced
by the Germans.</p>

<p>Hand grenades have been much used to hurl into the trenches of
the enemy. An instant before being thrown, the fuse is lighted; but
if the soldier delays a moment too long, the bomb explodes in his
hands.</p>

<p>Shrapnel consists of a case containing so many bullets that a
single shell is more deadly than the machine gun at its best.
Moreover, while the rifle bullets make a clean hole not difficult
to heal, the shrapnel bullets fly unsteadily and tear whatever they
touch. Then, too, the pieces of the shell itself make jagged and
irregular wounds.</p>

<p>Without wireless telegraphy and the use of the telephone warfare
of the present character could not be carried on. The commander of
a warship can reach every part of his vessel by telephone. Even on
a battle-field, the slender wire does in a moment what was in the
Civil War the work of orderlies galloping about with commands.
Telephone wires are strung with almost unbelievable rapidity. Two
men start off on horseback. One carries a reel of slender wire
which unwinds as he goes. The other carries a rod with a hook and
lifts the wire to branches of trees. To make the return circuit, a
metal rod is driven into the ground at each end of the line, or
even into a living tree. By means of this, a commander knows the
condition of every company, and they can receive his orders without
a moment's delay.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all to the observer is the armored tank,
clumsy, unwieldy, lifting up half its body and pawing about in the
air as if searching for the best way to go. It rolls itself
awkwardly into a deep shell-hole as if it really must see what is
down there, then climbs the bank and rumbles on its course. It
plunges through small trees and houses, if any are in its way; it
roams about in barbed-wire entanglements as if it did not know they
were there. It never makes a misstep or misroll&mdash;and wanders
around with an irresistibly comical air of going all by itself and
knowing just what it is about. And all this time it is giving
perfect shelter to the men and machine guns which are protected by
its plates of steel armor. Some one has said that all the tank
lacks is a pocket for carrying prisoners.</p>

<p>The various sorts of flying machines are used in vast numbers.
The German Zeppelin is an enormous cucumber-shaped dirigible
balloon, lifted by gas bags and propelled by gasoline engines. It
has a strong, light aluminum frame and is divided into gas-tight
compartments. Compared with the little French Nieuport biplane, it
is slow, but it can carry a large weight of bombs, and it can keep
still in one place and report by wireless to friends below just
what is going on from moment to moment in the enemy's lines. On the
other hand, the "Zep" is a mark not especially difficult to hit,
even if it is quite high up in the air. The Germans have employed
these in raids not only upon London and Paris, but also upon little
undefended villages and Red Cross hospitals. So many schools have
been struck by their bombs and children killed that they are often
called the "baby-killers." Just as the Allies long refused to
employ poison gas, so for many months they refused to make air
raids; but a stern demand for reprisals sent great battle-planes
forth to drop bombs, not upon schoolhouses and hospitals, but upon
German barracks and munition factories.</p>

<p>Anti-aircraft guns have now become common, and when the whir of
an aircraft is heard, an alarm is given to warn people to keep out
of the street and to go to their cellars. Then long rays from
electric searchlights flash over the sky and the guns begin to
roar. A storm of shrapnel beats upon the aircraft. If the gunners
are fortunate in their aim, a Zeppelin or a "plane" tumbles down
from the sky. Often airplanes go out to meet airplanes, and there
are battles in the air, whose results are known sometimes by the
fall of an enemy's shattered machines, sometimes by the failure of
the defenders to return.</p>

<p>The "flyers" do many kinds of work. They take snapshots of the
country beneath them, which are closely compared with the
photographs of the preceding day, and if there is any new bit of
camouflage or any change in the position of the enemy, it reveals
itself in the film. They drop bombs to destroy railroad bridges and
munition works, they direct by wireless from stationary balloons,
or "sausages," as has been said before, the fire of the artillery,
and they fight with the utmost fearlessness. A later form of the
airplane is the hydroplane, an amphibious sort of invention which
can fly in the air or float on the water, according to the need of
the hour. Airplanes differ in speed and are thus adapted to the
special work required of them. One variety can fly 110 miles per
hour, carrying 700 pounds of bombs; another, which is called
"slow," though it makes 80 miles per hour, can carry 4400 pounds of
bombs.</p>

<p>One specially valuable work of the air machines is the discovery
of submarines. The submarine under water is invisible at the
surface, but from a distance above the surface it can be easily
seen. The submarine is not wholly new; indeed, one is said to have
been made three hundred years ago; but the kinds now in use were
invented some years before the present war by the Americans John P.
Holland and Simon Lake. The submarine is a cigar-shaped shell of
steel, so filled with complicated machinery that the men who run it
have very narrow quarters. It can go on water or under water, and
can sink or rise at the will of its commander. When just under
water a man in the conning tower can see what is on the surface by
means of a periscope. This is an upright tube extending up into the
air with such an arrangement of mirrors and lenses that whatever
goes on above the water is reflected down into the submarine. When
a ship comes into view, and the submarine has reached a convenient
position, it fires a torpedo, rises to the surface to observe the
result, and if necessary dives. It also carries guns of
considerable range; and if the commander thinks it safe, the boat
can remain on the surface and destroy any vessel whose guns are of
less power.</p>

<p>Halfway between flying machines and railways are the teleferica
of Italy. Up to the present time it had been taken for granted that
fighting in the Alps must be done in the passes and on the low
heights, and that no summits of lofty peaks could be held
permanently, for there are no roads above the snow line, and even
those below it are often deep in snow for perhaps half a winter at
a time. The Italians made up their minds to use the summits if
possible. Then came the question how to transport soldiers,
munitions, and food from one mountain to another. The teleferica,
or <i>far carrier</i>, was originally only a cable stretched from
one point to another, on which buckets of ore could travel. The
resourceful Italians adopted the idea, stretched hundreds of miles
of strong wire cable from mountain to mountain, ran a cage on each
cable, and set up a petrol engine to provide power. That is all,
but by means of these, thousands of men and hundreds of thousands
of tons of food and munitions have been carried, and not one
passenger has ever lost his life in an accident. Wounded men,
wrapped in blankets, are often sent a mile or so by teleferica, and
sometimes&mdash;thanks to the slender cable&mdash;the prompt
operation which will save a man's life can be performed within an
hour after he has been wounded.</p>

<p>Perhaps not exactly "methods of warfare," but certainly of great
assistance in warfare, are mules and horses, homing pigeons, and
dogs. Motors do not fill the place of horses and mules by any
means. It is estimated that, entirely aside from the requirements
of the cavalry, one horse is needed to every four men. The horse
will go over ground too rough for the motor, and even over ditches
and through ploughed fields where a motor would flounder
helplessly. The motor car can usually carry supplies of food and
ammunition to within five miles of the fighting line, but the horse
or mule must do the rest.</p>

<p>Homing pigeons are the best carriers of messages in the employ
of the army. Pigeon lofts, looking like lunch carts, are drawn up
behind the lines, and from there the birds are taken to the men who
are to form scouting or attacking parties. Patrol boats and U-boats
carry pigeons, aviators send them home with messages written on
thin paper and fastened in a capsule to one of their legs. The
pigeon never loses his sense of direction. Even if he is set free
in the midst of a heavy barrage fire, he flies up as fearlessly as
if he knew what an impossible mark he is for an enemy's gun,
circles around once to get his bearings, and then starts for his
own loft at astounding speed. Pigeons can fly sixty miles an hour
and have been known to make eight hundred miles on a single flight.
At one of our camps a message of moderate length was started at the
same moment by dog, wireless, and pigeon, to a distant place. The
pigeon-borne message arrived in two and one half minutes. Even the
wireless lagged behind, for it took longer than that to relay the
message and deliver it.</p>

<p>The work of the dog is exceedingly valuable and greatly varied.
For drawing carts the Belgians have long used a cross between the
Great Dane and the mastiff, such a dog as is the hero of Ouida's
story, <i>A Dog of Flanders</i>. He now draws light guns, and with
dogs of other breeds has been taught to search out wounded men,
running back with a cap, a button gnawed from their clothing, or,
as trained in some armies, carrying in his mouth a loose strap left
hanging from his collar and thus showing that he has found some one
in need. Dogs have been brought from Alaska to drag supplies and
ammunition on narrow-gauge tracks laid over the Vosges Mountains.
They also carry food and hot coffee to the men in the first
trenches when the firing is protracted. They carry messages to the
firing-line when communication has been in any manner cut off. They
accompany sentinels and patrols and keep close beside
listening-posts, ready to indicate the direction of the danger by
"pointing." They help kill the rats in the trenches; and not the
least of their services is acting as pets for the soldiers. They
wear gas-masks like "other folk," though they were at first greatly
mortified at appearing in public in such a costume; and if they are
wounded, they are carried to hospitals and are cared for by
skillful specialists. Like other folk, too, they receive badges of
honor. More than one dog has got a message through, thus saving a
whole battalion or system of trenches, and has received from France
the highest decoration for bravery that the country can give.</p>

<p>England has a veterinary corps attached to every brigade. A
horse that is injured hopelessly is put out of his suffering by a
prompt and merciful death. One that can be saved is carried in a
horse ambulance to the hospital and given water, food, and a bed of
straw. If the horse is sleepy, he is first allowed to rest as long
as he likes, for the veterinaries know well that sleep is his best
medicine. Then he is washed, and his wounds dressed. Even after he
recovers, if he needs rest he is sent to pasture for a while before
returning to the front. Thousands of horses that would have died in
lingering agony on the battle-field are saved by this treatment;
and whenever a horse "over there" is saved, the need of sending one
from "over here" is prevented. England soon found her regular corps
insufficient, and appealed to the Royal Humane Society for help.
The Blue Star, as the animal relief society is called in France,
has twelve or more base hospitals and a number of first-aid
hospitals, but very many more are needed. The American Humane
Association, at the request of the Secretary of War, is doing the
same kind of work under the name of the Red Star.</p>

<p>Dogs and horses are just as lonesome and nervous and homesick as
people. In war they are just as much exposed to danger as are the
men, and they suffer just as much from liquid fire burns, from gas,
shrapnel wounds, and shell shock. Well deserved is the noble prayer
of the Russians, "for the innocent beasts who, together with us,
have borne the danger and burden of the day."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. THE TROUBLES OF NEUTRALS</h2>

<p>The old pictures of warfare with troops drawn up in opposing
lines, graceful clouds of smoke rising here and there, and
picturesque "tented fields" in the distance are quite out of date.
In these days the men are hidden in trenches, often only two or
three hundred yards apart, sometimes even less, but invisible to
their opponents. Some of Kitchener's men did not see a German for
weeks, even though they kept close watch with their field-glasses
and periscopes.</p>

<p>Something was going on, however, most of the time. Shells were
tearing great holes in the trenches, rifles were cracking, and when
the shrapnel, or shells full of bullets, came, "It was just like
trying to dodge raindrops in a shower," said one Tommy. At night
things happened. Men slipped out in the darkness over "No Man's
Land," a wild, shell-torn area between the lines which has been
described as "all holes tied together." There they mended the
barbed-wire tangles; they cut grass and weeds lest these should
protect some patrol of the enemy; they brought up food and
ammunition from the wagons back of the lines; and they always had
trenches to repair after the usual bomb-throwing. There were
"listening parties," who stole out in front of the enemy's trenches
to learn if possible what was going on either above ground or below
it, and there were bombing parties, when men crept in the darkness
close up to the enemy, threw bombs wherever they heard voices, then
dropped flat upon the ground to await a chance to wriggle toward
the home lines. This was what went on while the newspapers were
reporting "Nothing doing on the Western Front."</p>

<p>When an engagement was to come, aircraft became more numerous,
watching the lines of the enemy; the front trenches and those back
of them were crowded with soldiers and the batteries fired a
barrage, or curtain of shells, at the enemy's trenches. Under
shelter of this, the men dashed forward "over the top." Suddenly
the barrage firing ceased, and a fierce attack on the trenches of
the enemy was made. If the assault succeeded, men ran forward with
sandbags to build up parapets on the farther side of the captured
trench to shield them from the enemy's return fire; men of the
signal corps darted across No Man's Land, unwinding spools of
telephone wire as they ran; and the riflemen waited ready for the
counter-attack.</p>

<p>Through 1915 there was an occasional attack on the Western Front
by one side or the other. At Neuve Chapelle, not far from Lille in
France, there was a three days' struggle. The English were gaining.
Then came four and a half hours when every minute seemed to them an
age, for their hope of victory lay in keeping up their barrage fire
till reinforcements arrived, and ammunition was low. The German
guns pounded away, but the English response was more and more
feeble; the ammunition had given out. Neuve Chapelle was "a victory
that halted."</p>

<p>In April, 1915, another struggle was made by the Germans for the
town of Ypres&mdash;Tommy's "Wipers." Here for the first time
poison gas was used. The Germans had compressed it into steel
cylinders and when these were opened, the gas rolled along before
the wind. It was a terrible surprise, and nearly a whole division
of the French, 19,000 men, was destroyed. Germany had felt certain
that England's colonies would never stand by her, and had expected
some of them to seize the opportunity to cut loose from their
allegiance. Instead of this, they vied with one another in rushing
to her aid, and here at Ypres was a Canadian brigade. Owing to the
direction of the wind, they escaped much of the gas. They charged
upon the German troops and halted their advance. Again and again
after this the Germans let loose the poisonous gas against the
Canadians and also a division of England's Indian army. Gas-masks,
however, were supplied, and soon the splendid valor of the
Canadians had a better chance. The result was that, although the
Allies were obliged to shorten their lines by Ypres, the Germans
failed to take the city and were driven back to the eastward.</p>

<p>Both France and England had learned that they must make ready to
meet an enemy who had long been preparing for this war. France had
lost her coal-mines, her iron-mines, and her largest factories, and
had not a ton of the chief high explosive on hand when the war
opened. She sent to England for coal, to Spain for iron, to America
for machinery. She made over automobile factories, repair shops,
anything that contained a bit of machinery, into manufactories of
shells and guns. She fed and clothed her armies. She sent
ammunition to Serbia and artillery to Italy after that country
entered the war. She put herself at the head of the flying
business, and supplied airplanes not only for herself, but for
Italy, Russia, and England. Wherever women could become the
workers, men were spared to join the troops.</p>

<p>The English were even less prepared for war than France, but
their lesson was soon learned. The later recruits to "Kitchener's
Mob" had uniforms and whatever else was needed. When the moment
came to take the train, the train was ready to be taken.</p>

<p>Half an hour was allowed for loading. In half an hour the
loading was done, the train rolled out and a second rolled in. So
it went on until every man was at the wharf ready to go "somewhere
in France." Two mine-destroyers guarded each transport, one on
either side, fifty yards distant.</p>

<p>As for the people who "kept the home fires burning," they too
were hard at work for England. Tobacco factories began to
manufacture shells; people who had worked on pianos now made rifle
stocks; the gramophone ceased its wails, for its makers were now
making fuses. Mechanics who had been stamping out the peaceful
trousers button now began to stamp out disks for cartridges. The
wonder of it was the rapidity with which everybody learned to do
everything. Gardeners and porters worked in iron foundries as if
they had been used to such labor from boyhood. Society women
handled lathes and helped make munitions as if they had always done
so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what was the great republic across the Atlantic about
during those tempestuous days? She was trying hard to keep neutral,
to favor neither side. Of course, every man, even in a neutral
land, has a right to his own opinion, and if he chooses he may even
lend money to a country at war. The behavior of a neutral
<i>government</i>, however, is a different matter. A neutral
government must treat contending nations exactly alike. It must not
lend or give money or supplies to either nation; it must not allow
troops for either to be enlisted within its boundaries; it must not
allow its territory to become a base for fitting out ships or
expeditions against either side.</p>

<p>These are the duties of a neutral government, but it also has
rights. These are chiefly concerned with its commerce. This
commerce must not be interfered with except in so far as may be
necessary to maintain a blockade or shut from an opponent
"contraband of war"&mdash;that is, articles of use in war.</p>

<p>In the matter of trade our first difference of opinion was with
England, who had declared a blockade of German ports. This is
permitted by international law, that is, the rules upon which the
principal nations have agreed; but there has always been
controversy in regard to details. Only one principle has been
recognized by all nations, namely, that a blockade must not be a
"paper blockade," but must be effective. This means that a coast
declared to be blockaded must be so closely watched by its enemy
that any vessel attempting to break through the blockade will be in
real danger of capture. The mere proclamation of a blockade is not
sufficient. Vessels enforcing a blockade have been expected to
remain near the enemy's harbors, so as not to interfere with ocean
traffic; but in these days of submarines, mines, and aircraft, it
would be exceedingly dangerous for any vessel to attempt to remain
near the harbor of an enemy; therefore England declared that ships
passing a line drawn from the northern point of the Hebrides
through the Faroe Islands to Iceland would do so at their own
peril. This shut off a large area of the ocean from neutral
trade.</p>

<p>Such trade was also interfered with in another way. The German
Government had taken possession of all the food in Germany, in
order that it might see to it first of all that the troops were
well provisioned; therefore, England declared that she would
prevent food and other contraband from going to Germany, not only
directly, but also through neutral countries. The United States
protested earnestly against this. England pointed out that neutral
countries had increased their importation of certain substances
used in war, like copper and rubber, far beyond what they
themselves could use; and that Holland, for instance, even if she
agreed to send no <i>American</i> leather to Germany, could easily
export all that she produced if she was getting from the United
States what she needed for herself. England also explained that in
several cases our ships had brought in contraband under false
manifestoes, and that, therefore, her only course was to take the
vessels into port and examine their cargoes. Of course this caused
delay, and sometimes perishable cargoes might be injured or even
spoiled, but she agreed to pay for all damages that might be caused
by her action. This was not very different from the policy that we
had followed toward England during our Civil War in regard to her
trade with Mexico and the West Indies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Germany had been building submarines and sending them
to sea as fast as she could. Her fleet was bottled up in the Baltic
Sea, and she depended upon the underwater craft to destroy merchant
vessels and so prevent food and munitions of war from reaching her
enemies. She now declared that just as far as possible she should
destroy without warning every enemy vessel coming into the waters
surrounding the British Isles, from the Faroe Islands to Spain and
from Norway to the twentieth degree of west longitude. To destroy a
merchant ship without examination to see whether she carries
contraband is contrary to international law; and to sink her
without making sure of the safety of her passengers and crew is not
only contrary to law, but to common humanity. Germany said that, if
she gave warning, the merchant ships would escape, and that, as for
passengers, a submarine had no accommodations for them; therefore,
she would not be bound by any law unless the United States would
induce England to give up her attempts to keep food from the
Central Powers. She advised neutrals not to make use of the vessels
of the Allies, and closed with the suggestion of a
threat&mdash;that the submarines might not always be able to
recognize neutrals. Apparently they were not able, for American
ships were sunk without warning. Thus England and Germany
interfered with our trade; but Germany also took the lives of
American citizens, a very different matter. As to the question of
indemnity, England promptly offered to make good all damages;
Germany evaded and excused. This is the way matters stood at the
end of 1914.</p>

<p>Germany was angry with us for not attempting to control England,
but she was even more angry because our Government did not forbid
the sale of ammunition and guns to the Allies. She was fully
prepared for the short war that she had planned; but now that it
threatened to be a long war needing a vast amount of ammunition,
she wished, like the Allies, to be able to buy it. The merchants of
every country have the legal right to sell such articles in war as
well as in peace, and Germany had been perfectly willing to sell to
belligerent nations in other wars. We were willing to sell to
Germany as well as to the Allies, but we had not the ships to
deliver the articles to either party. The Allies could send
vessels, while Germany could not; therefore, Germany wanted the
trade stopped; that is, she wanted the rules changed in the middle
of the game. Yet Germany had sold munitions to Russia in the
Russo-Japanese War of 1904; to Spain in the Spanish-American War of
1898; and in the Boer War of 1899 she had sold to England, although
the Boers, like the Germans to-day, were shut away from markets.
Moreover, taking a wider view of the subject, if a nation could not
in its hour of need buy munitions in the open market, then a
militarist nation like Germany, which at all times makes a business
of manufacturing and exporting them, one firm alone employing
42,000 men in time of peace, would have a great advantage over
nations which did not engage in such manufactures. The result would
be that in order to provide for its own defense, each nation would
be forced to accumulate to the extent of its ability whatever would
be of use in war.</p>

<p>Germany became more and more angry. The United States, too, was
becoming aroused, for many fires and explosions in this country had
been found to be the work of Germans in the pay of the German
Government. American ships flying the American flag, and even Red
Cross ships with their symbol and their names painted on their
sides were torpedoed without warning. In one case, indeed, a
warning was given, and the captain was allowed just five minutes to
get off his 250 passengers and crew! The ship was torpedoed before
the lifeboats could be lowered, and nearly half of those on board
lost their lives. This was about as near a state of war as anything
could be. Protests to Germany met the reply that Germany was not to
blame; it was all the fault of England, who was trying to starve
her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. THE WAR IN 1915</h2>

<p>By both words and deeds Germany had declared that she believed
in conducting war with "frightfulness"; that is, with such cruelty
and ferocity that her adversaries would in mortal terror yield to
her at once. In accordance with this theory, she decided to destroy
the Lusitania, a great passenger steamer plying between this
country and England. Apparently she preferred not to become any
further involved with the United States, for several persons were
warned by anonymous telephone messages not to sail by this vessel,
and the German Embassy in this country published a warning over its
own signature. No one was alarmed, for no one supposed it possible
that any country would commit such a deed as Germany had planned,
and a number of Americans sailed on the steamer. To sink a
transport carrying troops is as much an act of war as a battle is;
but to sink a passenger vessel of non-combatants is not war, it is
murder. The Lusitania was torpedoed without warning, and 1153 of
her 1917 passengers were drowned, men, women, and little children,
114 of them citizens of the United States. Americans were
overwhelmed with the horror of such an atrocity. Germany expressed
her regret at the loss of life, but said it was the fault of her
enemies; that England was trying to starve her, and she was forced
to retaliate. She struck a medal in honor of the crime and gave her
school-children a three-days' holiday for rejoicing.</p>

<p>President Wilson sent to Germany a series of dignified notes,
and declared that she would be held to strict accountability, but
did not succeed in inducing her even to agree to any reparation.
How little real regret was felt for the act was well indicated by
one of the Berlin papers, which published a picture of an American
vessel with its bow-sprit piercing a note. Germans doubled up with
laughter stood on the wharf, exclaiming, "Another!"</p>

<p>Americans began to think. We had heard reports of the cruelty of
the Germans to the Belgians and others; and we had sent money and
food to the suffering people, but we could hardly believe that
these reports had not been greatly exaggerated. Careful
investigations were now made. It was shown that the Germans had
poisoned wells, scattered germs of disease, bombed hospitals,
schoolhouses, and orphan asylums; that non-combatants, not only men
but women and little children, had been killed in large numbers;
that they had been forced with bayonet thrusts to walk in front of
German troops in order to shield them from bullets; that prisoners
and wounded had been murdered in order to get rid of them. German
soldiers were asked to keep diaries. From those found on prisoners
and from articles in the German newspapers it was seen that these
crimes had not been committed by excited, disobedient soldiers, but
under strict orders from headquarters, and that this
"frightfulness" was the kind of warfare which Germany deliberately
planned. War is horrible at the best, and the chief nations of the
world have held several conferences at The Hague in Holland, and
there agreed never to commit such crimes as those that have been
mentioned. Germany was one of those nations, and these acts of
cruelty were violations of her solemn pledges.</p>

<p>In 1914, the Russians, as has been said, were in possession of
most of Galicia, and they were so sure of getting it all that they
appointed a governor-general for "the new Russian province." They
were besieging Przemysl at the end of the year. Russia and Germany
each maintained a line of forts along the boundary; and in Poland
no enemies had come within range of the Russian fortifications. At
the end of 1914, the Russians held the best position. They now made
a plan to advance in the same eastern corner of Germany that they
had tried in 1914. On the German line of defense there were forests
and swamps and lakes, with fortifications wherever they were
needed. The Russians, pushed on eagerly. They made their way
through forests, they dashed into frozen morasses. No large numbers
of Germans had appeared, and what they had met were gradually
falling back. The Russians did not guess that this was a trick, and
they pushed on and on, far into the country of the Mazurian Lakes.
Then there sprang up before them a great German force with Von
Hindenburg as its leader. The Russians lost vast numbers of men
either killed or captured. One whole corps disappeared. Many days
later, one division of this corps made their appearance. They had
been struggling over frozen morasses, in pathless forests, and
through deep snows. Little by little, other divisions succeeded in
joining their own troops.</p>

<p>At the end of 1914 the Russians had taken Lemberg and were
besieging Przemysl. Przemysl would have fared better if it had not
had so many men to use up its food. When the Austrians had been
obliged to retreat before the Russians, many of them had taken
refuge in this place, and there they had remained. In every siege
that is kept up long enough, provisions are certain to fail. The
Russians did not trouble themselves to make attacks on the fort;
they had only to wait until the Austrians within were hungry enough
to surrender. The Austrians without tried to slip through the
Carpathian passes to help their friends. They themselves made
sorties, at first trying to break the siege, then trying only to
capture supplies. Scores of men were dying every day. At length,
after seven months' resistance, the Austrians within the fort
surrendered to the besieging Russian army.</p>

<p>The 100,000 men who had been carrying on the siege of Przemysl
were now free to meet the troops of the Central Powers in the
Carpathian passes. Unfortunately for the Russians, these men were
chiefly cavalry and artillery, neither of which is of much use in
mountain fighting. The German and Austrian troops swarmed into
Galicia. They had 4000 guns, half of them of large size. It has
been estimated that shells enough were thrown to average 140 pounds
of iron for every Russian engaged in the struggle. The Russians
were in as bad a condition as the English at Neuve Chapelle, for
now they had not nearly enough artillery. To save the men or save
the guns was the question. There were so few guns that they did not
dare to lose them, and the men were sacrificed. The Russians were
forced to retreat. Then came a struggle of nearly three weeks to
recapture Przemysl. The Germans were successful. Lemberg also soon
fell into their hands. Warsaw had to yield, and the Russians were
again driven into retreat.</p>

<p>Russia had vast numbers of trained men, but not many guns; and
there are reasons for thinking that certain high officials favored
the Germans and sent thousands of their countrymen to their death
rather than harm the Central Powers. It is possible that this is
why the Grand Duke Nicholas could not risk large battles, knowing
that if his ammunition failed, Russia might be out of the war for
months. Evidently he and the Czar had some disagreement, for the
Grand Duke was sent to take command of the troops in the Caucasus,
a less important position, and the Czar himself became the head of
the forces on the western boundary. This leadership of the Czar was
only in name, and his chief of staff was the real commander.</p>

<p>The Austrians had been driven out of Serbia, but they had no
idea of staying out, and one commander after another tried his luck
against the resolute Serbians. These Serbians had also another
enemy, typhus fever. To overcome this, a company of American Red
Cross nurses and physicians went to Serbia, established camps and
hospitals, and so brought the disease under control. In the autumn
the German general Von Mackensen massed his troops at the northern
boundary of Serbia. Bulgaria now joined the Central Powers. After
the Second Balkan War she had been deprived of districts wherein
lived many of her nation. She was especially angry with Serbia, and
it was not a difficult matter for Germany to induce her by promises
of territory to become an ally. This alliance cleared the way for
Germany's direct route from Berlin to Constantinople, save for the
short distance across the corner of Serbia. The struggle of Serbia
against Bulgaria and the Central Powers went on for months, but at
the end of the year 1915 the Serbians held only a tiny strip of
territory in the west and another in the south of their
country.</p>

<p>Russia in all her military actions was badly handicapped by her
position. On a map she looks at the first glance big enough to
subdue the rest of Europe all by herself; but during this war she
was almost as helpless in getting supplies as little San Marino
would have been if Italy had been unfriendly. What Russia needed
was a way of getting into the Mediterranean, for the Mediterranean
would be open at all seasons of the year. The only way to bring
this about was to take the Strait of the Dardanelles, bring a fleet
through it, and capture Constantinople. If this could be done, the
power of Turkey would be broken; her attacks on Egypt and the Suez
Canal and her mischief-making in Persia would cease. Russia would
be immensely strengthened because she could then reach markets
where she could buy all that she needed to carry on the war.
Moreover, it was quite probable that if Constantinople was held by
the Allies, the Balkan States that had not quite decided where to
stand would join them. And, too, there was another reason, not so
unimportant as it may seem; Constantinople is a city with a history
stretching back many centuries. It has been besieged more than
thirty times, but captured only three times, the last time having
been nearly five hundred years ago. To take Constantinople would be
a vast gain in itself, of course, but it would loom up in men's
minds even greater than it really was and would give more
encouragement to the Allies than any other single event could do.
It was a great undertaking with enormous risk, but the French and
English decided to attempt it.</p>

<p>The Strait of the Dardanelles is forty-seven miles long. Most of
it is three or four miles wide, although at its narrowest place it
is only one mile in width, and with wind and current permitting,
one could row from Europe to Asia in a few minutes. It is more like
a river than a strait, only its current flows both ways at the same
time, for there is a surface current from the Black Sea and an
undercurrent from the Mediterranean. The surface current would help
the Turks in using floating mines, and the undercurrent would help
the Allies in sending their submarines from the Mediterranean
toward Constantinople.</p>

<p>The Allies expected to have aid from Greece, because Venizelos,
the Greek Premier, favored them and had invited them to come; but
just at this time Venizelos was put out of office. They made no
change in their plans, however, but brought a great fleet of French
and English ships together and took for their base the little
islands of Lemnos and Tenedos. This is the part of the world which
was the scene of many of the stories of ancient times. When after
the Trojan War the Greeks pretended to have sailed away from Troy
and left the wooden horse behind them filled with armed men, they
hid their ships behind Tenedos; and when Alexander the Great set
out to conquer Asia, he built a bridge of boats across the
Dardanelles.</p>

<p>The strait was splendidly protected by fortifications at either
end, by forts between, by the best of artillery, by mine fields,
floating mines, and torpedo boats. Any nation might well hesitate
to attack such a place, but the English and French sent a
magnificent fleet against it. The guns of the ships had a much
longer range than those of the forts at the entrance of the strait,
and before many days had passed, the batteries were silenced. This,
however, was only the beginning. By the bombardment the mines at
the western end of the strait had been cleared away, and now the
ships steamed in to attack the forts at the narrowest part of the
strait, which were much stronger than those at the entrance. After
some resistance these forts ceased firing. Apparently they had been
silenced, and the warships moved on. Suddenly the Turkish guns
began to blaze and mines floated swiftly down upon the fleet. Three
of the great battleships were sunk. The others withdrew into the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Military experts declare that there is one lesson which has to
be learned anew in almost every war. It is that coast defenses of
the best sort can resist the attacks of any fleet of the day. The
Allies had now found this to be true. They made another plan. They
decided to land on Gallipoli, the long, narrow peninsula which
forms the western shore of the strait. It is a rich, fertile
country, but a particularly poor place for the landing of troops,
for it is bordered by steep cliffs, and there are only a few
beaches where landing is possible. These beaches were of fine,
slippery sand, and back of them was a steeply rising ground or
cliff of sandstone and clay. In the little hollows of the shore
barbed-wire entanglements were cunningly hidden. In the face of the
cliffs holes had been cut, and here sat sharp-shooters, with
machine guns, while at the top of the cliffs were Turks, good
fighters, particularly behind fortifications, and they had been
trained by the Germans in all the latest fashions of warfare.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the troops determined to land. The men were
French, English, Irish, Indian, and "Anzac," whose name was
manufactured from the initials of "Australian-New Zealand Army
Corps." They have been described as a "fine lot of men, generally
tall, broad-shouldered, and young. They swing along at an easy
pace, their big hats turned up at one side, their jackets rather
loose, high boots, and enormous spurs." They were a very
independent troop and had not much regard for military etiquette.
One of them said the world was so full of officers it made him feel
like a human windmill to salute whenever he met one of them.</p>

<p>These Anzacs had no notion of fear, and when the landing at
Suvla Bay was to be made, they swung up the beach on the run,
apparently not noticing the fact that they were in a storm of
bullets. Straight up the cliffs they scrambled in spite of the
Turks, and quite as if they were on their way to a picnic. It was
two days before a line of the Allies could be formed, for there
were encounters everywhere. In some the Allies won, in some the
Turks. The Anzacs fought splendidly; but so did the French and the
English and the Irish and the Indians. There were no cowards at
Gallipoli. But there was no permanent success for the Allies. The
submarines ran all risks of mines, nets, underwater bombs, and
slipped into the Sea of Marmora, sinking vessel after vessel, one
of them actually close to the Constantinople quay; but the Allies
had no land forces to back them up. The losses from battle were
enormous, and the swarms of flies and the poor water brought
sickness upon the troops. Just after the close of the year the
Allied forces were withdrawn; the attempt to take Constantinople
had failed completely.</p>

<p>The Allies had but little success to show for the year 1915. On
the Western Front they had met with small losses, it is true, but
their gains were equally small. On the Eastern Front, Germany had
practically driven the Russians out of eastern Germany, Poland, and
Galicia. She had overpowered Serbia, and had held Constantinople.
She had lost no territory on the Continent of Europe. On the other
hand, the sinking of neutral ships and the torpedoing of the
Lusitania had aroused the indignation of the United States, and the
Allies had been busy among the German colonies. Japan had taken
Kiao-chau in China, and also several groups of islands lying to the
southeast of that district. England had taken the German
settlements of New Guinea and also some neighboring islands.
Germany still held some of her territory in Africa, German East
Africa on the eastern coast and Kamerun on the western. If she
could win the war, it would be an easy matter to recover her
colonial possessions. It was a hard year for the Allies.</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>
<h2>VII. THE WAR IN 1916</h2>

<p>The year 1916 began with a struggle which lasted for six long
months to decide whether a certain little town in France should be
captured by the Central Powers or remain in the hands of the
French.</p>

<p>That little town was Verdun. It runs up the hill from the Meuse
River to the cathedral built long before America was discovered. It
is not far from the border-line between France and Germany, and
after the Franco-Prussian War the French set to work to make it the
strongest town in their country. It is much more than merely a
"fortified town"; it is a wide area of land with fortified
positions at every turn&mdash;not in plain view by any means, but
concealed so cunningly that the sharpest eyes could not discover
them. There are secret roads, mysterious gun-pits, where one would
never think of looking for a gun, but so placed that one or another
of them can command every approach. Underground there is a whole
labyrinth of passageways, besides galleries, tunnels, winding
staircases, and a great number of rooms for all purposes, well
ventilated and lighted with electricity. One might be roaming about
aboveground, thinking himself almost alone; but if an alarm was
signaled, troops would suddenly spring up from cellars and caves in
the rock and all sorts of unexpected places. Around Verdun are
wooded hills, and they too have been skillfully fortified. All
these are the older defenses. More recently trenches have been made
in most intricate arrangement and wild entanglements of barbed wire
have been placed.</p>

<p>This is the fortress that the Crown Prince of Germany strove for
six months to capture. It was the military key to western France,
and, like Constantinople, it had a great sentimental value. Then
too, thrones are a bit uncertain in these days, and many people
thought that the German Crown Prince was determined to strengthen
his hold upon the German folk by so notable a conquest. However
that may be, the military people of Verdun suspected early in the
year that something was going to happen. Soldiers and guns were
brought up in great numbers. There were attacks on the Allies here
and there along the Western Front, and the Kaiser paid a visit to
his troops. Moreover, there was a certain stir and restlessness
which soldiers known how to interpret. In the later part of
February the attack began, and it continued until almost the end of
the year with now and then a lull of a few days.</p>

<p>The hero of Verdun was General Pétain, tall, slender, and
inclined to be silent. Before the war he was a retired colonel.
Joffre, however, has a way of finding out when people have anything
in them, and he called him back to service. Twice he was promoted
within a year, and the was put in command at Verdun. This was the
silent man's opportunity, and he showed himself a genius in
military strategy. The attack upon Verdun was carried on with
ammunition in unlimited quantities and guns and men in unlimited
numbers. The fighting as a whole was of the most terrible nature,
with all the horrors of modern guns and modern explosives, but by
the skill of the French general and the bravery of the French
soldiers Verdun stood.</p>

<p>But what was England about that she did not come to the help of
Verdun? That is what the fault-finders were asking. England was no
"slacker." Within one week of the outbreak of war, she had sent
40,000 men across the Channel. Within one month 500,000 had
enlisted; two months later, the sum was 1,000,000; and in three
months from then, 500,000 more had joined the ranks. "As to the
women," said the superintendent of one of the government factories,
"I can tell you of a surgical-dressing factory near here, where for
nearly a year the women never had a holiday. They simply would not
take one. 'And what'll our men at the front do, if we go
holiday-making?' they said." Just now England was hard at work on
her plans and had no idea of explaining them to anybody. General
Haig was in command, a canny Scot, with a charming manner but an
expression that said, "I purpose to see this job through." He had
been examining the lay of the land opposite the English front on
the Somme River. He was quietly building roads and a railway, and
before long motor trucks and caterpillar tractors were bringing
guns, shells, barbed wire, howitzers, bombs, and hospital tents.
Landscape painters were called upon to help in the camouflage, and
airmen sailed aloft to see how well they had succeeded. One
succeeded altogether too well, if we may trust the story, for he
camouflaged so perfectly the van in which homing pigeons had been
brought that on their return they did not recognize it.</p>

<p>The preparations for what is now called the battle of the Somme
continued. At length the word was given, and on the morning of July
1 the struggle began, directed by General Haig and Marshal Joffre.
It did not end until the November rains brought it to a close.
Fighting went on furiously, frequently as severe as at Verdun. It
was here that the Germans had their first experience of a great
lumbering "tank," that roamed about like a gigantic caterpillar,
but sent forth death and destruction in a fashion quite unlike
caterpillars or anything else that the Germans had ever seen. Of
course the commanders had hoped to break through the German lines
and drive the invaders out of France. They had not done this, but
they had kept large forces away from Verdun and had also made it
possible for Russia to win a victory in the East.</p>

<p>During this year 1916 there were three especially important
events in the history of the war. One was the siege of Verdun; one
was the battle of the Somme; and the third was an engagement which
took place in the North Sea on the last day of May, between the
English and the German fleets.</p>

<p>During the war the English took the Orkney Islands for their
naval base, and frequently they made "sweeps" through the North
Sea. One afternoon in May, when the English cruisers were off the
coast of Jutland, they met the German fleet, "spoiling for a
fight." In the old stories of pirates a sea-fight was carried on by
grappling two vessels together, the men of one boarding the other,
and fighting hand to hand with swords and cutlasses and anything
else that was convenient. In a modern naval battle the ships are
miles apart, and the gunners would find swords and cutlasses
somewhat in their way. All the afternoon the vessels of the two
fleets fought, but the English kept an eye to the north, for
Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, one hundred miles away, had been sent
for by wireless. Just before six o'clock his fleet of battleships
made their appearance. Twilight soon came on, and the rest of the
fighting was done in the dark. The English had no idea of ceasing
to fight, but they discovered that their enemies had slipped away.
To follow them into their mine-strewn area would have been utter
folly, so they waited till morning. The Germans hastened to publish
it abroad that they had won a great victory; but in the morning,
when the English were patrolling off Jutland, not a German vessel
appeared, nor was the German fleet seen again till one day nearly
three months later, when it showed itself in the North Sea. Luck
was against it, for the English were there also, and the fleet
withdrew. The English navy has a proud record. It has cleared the
ocean of German craft, has practically ended German commerce, and
has by its protection made the commerce of the Allies possible.</p>

<p>Several other countries had now entered the war. Portugal was
bound by treaty to assist England if at any time her aid should be
needed. She had other reasons for fighting Germany, however, for
both countries had territory in Africa, and to make sure of her own
possessions, Portugal had promptly attacked those of Germany. Early
in 1916 she confiscated some German ships which lay in her harbors;
and not many days later Germany declared war on the little
country.</p>

<p>Italy had belonged to the Triple Alliance for thirty years; but
in this time her relations with the Allies, and especially with
France, had been growing more cordial, while her relations with the
Central Powers had been growing less cordial. The cause of this was
chiefly a question of territory. When the present kingdom of Italy
was formed, in 1861, there was considerable territory which was
inhabited by Italians, but had not become part of the new kingdom.
Winning this from foreign control came to be called "redeeming
Italy," and the Italian districts still remaining in the hands of
Austria were spoken of as "Italia irredenta," or <i>unredeemed
Italy</i>. These districts lay about Trieste and the Trentino, and
the lay of the land was such that it would be comparatively easy
for Austria to push down into Italy, and not at all easy for Italy
to thrust herself up into Austria. Italy wanted these districts,
but Austria held on to them. Moreover, Austria, supported by
Germany, had violated the Treaty of Berlin and had already seized
upon Bosnia and Herzegovina. If she also got possession of Serbia,
she would be able to stretch still farther down the eastern side of
the Adriatic. Austria had no idea of yielding, and in 1915 Italy
declared war on her.</p>

<p>Italy's example was followed by her little friend San Marino,
the oldest state in Europe, and the smallest republic in the world,
for it contains only thirty-eight square miles. It looks upon
Americans as its foster children, and declares proudly that the
United States has adopted the Sammarinese form of Government. The
independent little republic lies in the mountains about one hundred
miles south of Venice, and near the eastern coast of Italy. It has
been described as "a piece of land entirely surrounded by Italy."
In 1916 Italy, but not San Marino, declared war on Germany.</p>

<p>The "Fronts" had become many. There was now an Italian Front, a
Galician Front, and an Armenian Front, to say nothing of invasions
and attacks in numerous other places.</p>

<p>Of course long before this, when the war was only a few months
old, the Turks had set their eyes upon Egypt and the Suez Canal.
Egypt is ruled by England, and the Suez Canal is of great
importance to all nations that trade with the East, and especially
to England. That is why the Turks determined to attack it. Aside
from the question of fighting, this was rather a difficult task,
for the Turks had to cross the Sinai Peninsula, which extends into
the Red Sea, and carry their artillery and supplies with them.
Moreover, there are no railroads on this peninsula. Nevertheless,
they succeeded and launched their boats on the canal. It was night,
but the English troops discovered them, and the Turks fled. Through
1916, they kept troops in sight of the canal as a threat, but the
English also kept troops there and were ready at any moment to
defend the canal if necessary.</p>

<p>Things were particularly active near the Caucasus Mountains, to
which the Grand Duke Nicholas had been sent after his disagreement
with the Czar. Southwest of Caucasia is Armenia, a part of Turkey
in Asia. The Armenians have for hundreds of years been oppressed by
the Turks. During the last quarter of a century there have been at
least three savage attempts, which the Turkish Government either
planned or connived at, to destroy the whole race. In 1915 came the
most terrible persecution of all. Thousands of Armenians were
slaughtered on the spot. Other thousands were driven from their
homes out into the deserts of Arabia, where starvation and
exhaustion and the brutality of their merciless guards ended their
lives. So far as the Turks gave any excuse for this barbarous act,
it was that the Armenians would aid the Russians. During the
earlier massacres England, France, and Russia had threatened and
protested and had at length brought Turkey to terms. In this, the
most terrible massacre of all, there was only one country that
could have stopped her&mdash;Germany. And Germany said not a
word.</p>

<p>When the Allies gave up the attempt to capture Constantinople
and their troops moved away, the Grand Duke knew very well that
some of the Turks would come at once to fight his Russian army in
Armenia. He had been planning an attack upon two important cities
in Armenia, Erzerum and Trebizond; and now he hastened to make the
attack before the coming of the Turks from Gallipoli.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke had the advantage of a railroad which would land
his supplies only eighty miles from Erzerum; but the Turks had a
hard time getting theirs, for their nearest railroad was four
hundred and forty miles from Erzerum. It would have been simple and
easy if the Black Sea had been open to them, but that was in the
hands of the Russians, and the Russians were decidedly successful
in sinking ships. The Russians captured Erzerum with its guns and
ammunition and stores of all sorts. A little later they took
Trebizond. The Grand Duke had made a fine record for himself in
Armenia.</p>

<p>The Russians had been driven out of Germany and Galicia and they
had lost Poland; but they held a line from the Gulf of Riga to the
border of Rumania. They had had a busy winter, and they had brought
together a vast amount of ammunition. They planned a drive into
Galicia, and they made it, for they captured Czernovitz, a city
which they had taken in 1914, but had been obliged to surrender;
then took one place after another, successful in whatever they
attempted and taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. Russia was in
her glory.</p>

<p>While the Grand Duke was capturing towns in Armenia, the English
were attacking the Turks in Mesopotamia, or <i>the country between
the rivers</i>, the place where some people think the Garden of
Eden was situated. Late in 1914 the English with troops from India
had sailed up the Persian Gulf and defeated the Turks near the head
of the Gulf. They hoped to get possession of Baghdad, the city of
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, and the place which Germany planned to
make the terminus of her railroad. They now came within about one
hundred miles of the city of many stories, but when they had
reached the little Arab village of Kut-el-Amara, the Turks
surrounded them and settled down comfortably to starve them out.
The native Arabs tried their best to leave the town, but "the more,
the hungrier," reasoned the Turks, and drove them back. The
besieged troops were not strong enough to make a sortie. Sickness
appeared among them, and the medicines gave out. English aeroplanes
dropped into the village, not bombs, but 1800 pounds of food; but
this did not last long when there were so many starving people to
eat it. An expedition sent out for their relief had to turn back;
and soon the Turks were rejoicing over a surrender.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ITALIAN FRONT</p>

<hr>

<p>Waging war on the Italian Front was no easy matter. Indeed, the
Italians have struggled under greater difficulties than any other
nation. Their line of trenches is longer than the whole Western
Front; and many of these trenches have been dug out of snow and ice
or blasted out of solid rock. In the valleys the Italians have
fought in a burning heat, in the lowlands they have fought in water
up to their waists. The Italian mountaineers, the wonderful Alpini,
are not only experts on skis, but they know how to drive iron pegs
into rocky walls and so clamber up precipices. They can make their
barracks in caverns of ice, and more than once sudden storms have
shut them up on their mountain peaks from December to April.</p>

<p>In the struggle for Trieste the Austrians quietly brought their
troops from Russia to Trent, and collected supplies and ammunition
in that place. They had the great advantage of being on high land,
while the Italians were on low land. Suddenly the Austrians
attacked their adversaries with heavy bombardment and drove them
back to their frontier. General Cadorna was now made
commander-in-chief. His plans did not include retreating, and
before long he pushed forward, and now it was the turn of the
Austrians to retreat. The Italians drove onward, and soon did part
of what they had wanted to do, they captured Gorizia, thirteen
miles from Trieste, and detachments of Italian cavalry entered the
city in triumph with the King of Italy at their head. But they had
only begun to carry out their plans. Trieste, the port that they
had longed for, was so near that they hoped to push on and capture
it. But the winter came upon them and the fulfillment of their
hopes was delayed.</p>

<p>Rumania had been hesitating whether to join Germany or the
Allies. She knew just what she wanted, and she was trying to select
the winning side so as to get it. Like Serbia, she wanted to bring
under one rule all neighboring people of her blood.</p>

<p>The Russians, her next-door neighbors, had been meeting with
much success, and the Germans had not succeeded in taking Verdun;
therefore she decided to join the Allies. Many Rumanians lived in
Transylvania, just across the Hungarian border. Poor Rumania did
not stop to consider what her allies were doing, or whether she was
planning the wisest course that could be taken; she dashed across
the border into Transylvania so suddenly that the Austria-Hungarian
forces retreated before her. Then came fierce counter-attacks under
Generals Von Mackensen and Von Falkenhayn. The Russians had come to
Rumania, but they were in the extreme southeast of the land. The
full force of a terrible drive came upon the little country. Early
in December the Central Powers captured Bucharest, the Rumanian
capital, and imposed upon its people a tax amounting to $380 a
head. Straight through the land they went, from Hungary to the
Black Sea; they had won rich wheat-fields and oil-lands. Little
Montenegro, too, had been overcome, and King Nicholas had departed
for France. Neutral countries had been shown what fate would befall
them if they ventured to oppose the Central Powers.</p>

<p>This was the story of the year 1916. It was as a whole favorable
to the Allies. They had had the advantage at Verdun, on the Somme,
in Armenia, and on the sea. On the other hand, the expedition to
Mesopotamia was a failure and Rumania had been crushed.</p>

<h2>VIII. THE UNITED STATES ENTERS THE WAR</h2>

<p>January, 1917, had come, and the war had been going on for two
years and a half. When it first broke out, it was announced in big
headlines in the newspapers, and some of us took down atlases to
make sure just where Serbia was, but we did not expect the United
States to be seriously affected by a little fighting in a remote
corner of Europe. When England and France took up arms, the trouble
began to seem rather nearer home; but still we were on the other
side of the Atlantic, we had followed Jefferson's advice and
avoided European entanglements, and there seemed no reason why we
should have anything to do with this one. Therefore we had issued
promptly a proclamation of neutrality.</p>

<p>Of course Americans, as well as people of other nations, had
read German books declaring German aims; but we had never taken
them seriously. Perhaps one reason was that with our own great
country, "the blessed land of room enough," and our long lines of
seacoast, we could hardly understand the feelings of a rapidly
increasing people who felt themselves shut into too narrow
boundaries. However that may be, there was certainly one thing
which we had not suspected, and this was that German spies were
scattered throughout our land. We found that the German Government
was paying men to place bombs on ships sailing from the United
States, to burn our factories, to bring about strikes, and to wreck
railroads. These men were also attempting to use the United States
as a base from which to outfit steamers to supply German raiders.
They were making efforts to induce the Hindoos in this country to
arouse those of their race in India to rebel against the rule of
England, and they were trying to excite the people of India,
Mexico, Haiti, and Cuba to hatred of the United States. They
planned to involve Japan in their plots. Japan is our friend, and
if we treat her fairly, there is no reason to suppose that she will
ever be otherwise; but Germany schemed to unite Japan and Mexico
against us, their reward to be land in our Southwest. Germans
living in this country were advised from "home" to oppose military
training and arming, so that the United States might be the more
easily overcome in case of war. All this was before there was any
break between this country and Germany.</p>

<p>These things were done partly in revenge for our sales of
ammunition, and partly that we might be kept too busy at home to
join in the war in Europe if the time should come when we
discovered the wisdom of so doing. The German Embassy was the head
and front of this work. It even issued passports by forging the
name of the United States, a particularly dishonorable act, as a
foreign minister is regarded as the guest of the country to which
he is sent, and is accorded special privileges and courtesies. We
learned at last that we must meet bribery, treachery, and
crime.</p>

<p>Before the beginning of the war we had felt as kindly toward
Germany as toward any other country, but as the months passed, our
feelings underwent a change. War is horrible under all conditions,
but civilized nations have tried to lessen its terrors by
international laws and agreements forbidding certain methods of
warfare. Among the forbidden acts are the destruction of private
property; the bombardment of undefended towns, and the bombardment
of any towns without warning; injury to churches, art galleries,
hospitals, and hospital ships; the use of anything causing
unnecessary suffering, such as poison on weapons or in wells,
poison gas, or liquid fire. It is forbidden to impose upon any
community fines or other penalties for deeds of individuals for
which the community is not responsible. All these regulations, and
many others, Germany had violated again and again. She had treated
her prisoners with cruelty; she had spread germs of disease; in
Belgium, Poland, and elsewhere she had torn many thousands from
their families and driven them away into slavery; she had
recognized no law but her own will.</p>

<p>In great free America we could hardly believe that such crimes
as these could be committed anywhere in the world. When it was
proved not only that the charges were true, but that the crimes had
been committed, not by lawless soldiers, but under strict orders
from headquarters, it was impossible not to take sides. What had
happened in our own country increased our indignation. Still we
waited, until at last Germany's methods of carrying on submarine
warfare became unendurable. These were briefly:&mdash;</p>

<p>Early in 1915 Germany marked off a large area of the high seas
in which she declared she would sink all enemy ships without
warning. Three months later she sank the Lusitania. One year after
this, she promised to sink no more vessels without warning. Eight
months later, February 1, 1917, she declared that she would sink
without warning every vessel that she met. This was nothing more
nor less than piracy, and it aroused the indignation of the
world.</p>

<p>Our Government had learned before this that the German
Ambassador, Count Von Bernstorff, was at the head of the plots
against the United States, and two days after the declaration of
unrestricted warfare, he was given his passports. This was not
declaring war, but it was a threat of war if Germany did not mend
her ways. Germany continued in the same course, and two months
after the departure of Count Von Bernstorff, President Wilson stood
before Congress, called in special session. He summed up the
injuries which Germany had inflicted upon the United States and the
efforts of the Government to keep the peace. Then he said: "With a
profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the
step I am taking and of the grave responsibility which it involves,
but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional
duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the
Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war
against the Government and people of the United States." Congress
voted, "<i>Resolved</i>, That the state of war between the United
States and the Imperial German Government which has thus been
thrust upon the United States is hereby formally declared."</p>

<p>We are in this war for the reason which the President stated in
just eight words, "The world must be made safe for democracy." The
word democracy comes from two Greek words meaning <i>people</i> and
<i>power</i>, and a democratic government is one in which the
people are the source of power. The United States is a democracy.
We choose men to represent us, Representatives, Senators, and
President; but if even the President does not do for the country
what the majority think is wise and honorable, we have the right to
try him, and if he is proved guilty, to put him out of his office.
France, like the United States, is a republic. England is not a
republic, but it is a democracy. It has a king, to be sure, but
politically he is hardly more than a figurehead. The Prime Minister
and his party rule; but if they propose an important measure and
Parliament&mdash;<i>chosen by the people</i>&mdash;refuses to pass
it, they understand this as a broad hint that they are not
representing the will of the people; they resign and another
election is held. The Government of Italy is much like that of
England. Italy has a king and a legislature of two houses. Its
Cabinet, like the English Prime Minister and his party, resigns if
Parliament refuses to pass any important measure which it has
presented. Such is a democratic government, "Of the people, by the
people, and for the people," as Lincoln so well expressed it.</p>

<p>The Government of Germany is an autocracy. This word comes from
two Greek words meaning <i>self</i> and <i>power</i>, that is, the
ruler himself and not the people is the source of power. The German
Empire was formed, as has been said before, by the union of a
number of kingdoms, duchies, free cities, etc. The States of the
United States united on equal terms, no State having more
privileges or rights than another. The number of Representatives
which each State sends to Congress depends, as is fair and just,
upon the number of the State's inhabitants; but every State,
whether large or small, sends two Senators. The German union of
States is quite different from ours. When it was formed, some
States refused to join unless they could have special privileges.
Bavaria, for instance, pays no taxes to the Empire on beer and
domestic liquors. Of all these States, Prussia was by far the
strongest, and when her king became also German Emperor, she was
able to secure whatever special privileges she wanted.</p>

<p>The Government of Germany consists of the Kaiser, the
Chancellor, and two houses. The members of one of these, the
Bundesrat, are appointed by the rulers of the twenty-five States,
each one having a fixed number of votes. The other, the Reichstag,
represents the people, and its members are chosen by the people's
vote. At the first glance, this seems much like the Government of
England, with King, Prime Minister, and the two houses of
Parliament; but there is a great difference, as will be seen
later.</p>

<p>The Kaiser is of course at the head of the Government. Under him
is the Chancellor, whom he appoints or puts out of office as he
chooses. The Chancellor is President of the Bundesrat, and he has
also a seat in the Reichstag. In England, as has just been said, if
the Prime Minister proposes an important bill and Parliament
refuses to make it a law, the Prime Minister resigns. In Germany,
if the Chancellor proposes an important bill, and the Reichstag
refuses to make it a law, the Reichstag may be dissolved and a new
election held. This may be done again and again until a Reichstag
has been formed that will vote as the Chancellor&mdash;that is, the
Kaiser&mdash;wishes, and the Chancellor remains in power until the
Kaiser desires to make a change. The Reichstag, then, has almost no
power, and is practically, as it has often been called, only a
debating club.</p>

<p>The Bundesrat represents the States as States; but the number of
representatives varies with the different States. There are in all
61 members. Of these Prussia has 17, while 17 of the States have
only one apiece. Alsace-Lorraine has three votes, but the Kaiser
"instructs" how they shall be cast. The delegates from each State
vote as a unit and as they have been bidden by the Prince of their
State to vote. Now, the Kaiser is also King of Prussia, so the
twenty delegates are subject to his will. The meetings of the
Bundesrat are held in secret. If the Reichstag passes a law, it is
not valid unless the Bundesrat agrees to it. As the Kaiser controls
one third of the votes of the Bundesrat, it is an easy matter for
the Chancellor to secure for him enough more votes to make a
majority and pass whatever measures he may please. The Kaiser,
then, controls both the Reichstag and the Bundesrat. He also
controls the army and the navy. To make offensive war, he must ask
the assent of the Bundesrat&mdash;not difficult to obtain, as has
been seen&mdash;but if, <i>in his own opinion</i>, the war is
defensive, all he needs to do is to say, "Let there be war," and
the vast war machine of the Empire is set in motion. The present
war the Kaiser averred to be defensive, and he did not officially
notify the Bundesrat until three days after it had been
declared.</p>

<p>As Prussia is the leading State of Germany, it is of interest to
know that Prussian voters are divided into three classes according
to their property. Four per cent of the wealthy folk of the land
count in voting for as much as eighty-two per cent of the
working-people, and the vote of one man of wealth or of noble birth
may be equal to the votes of ten thousand working-men. This is why
a "junker," that is, son of a noble house which has always been
devoted to military service, holds so much power. Bismarck was a
junker. The Government of the United States, of England, of France,
and of Italy, is a government of the people by themselves&mdash;a
democracy. The Government of Germany is a government of the people
by one person&mdash;an autocracy.</p>

<p>Lincoln said, "This country cannot endure half slave and half
free." Neither can the nations endure half democratic and half
autocratic. As long as there is a man in the world who has the
power to bring war upon a country, simply by saying the word, the
world is not safe. That is why we are fighting. Our boys do not
cross the ocean to enter "European entanglements," but to keep
autocracy from our own land. This is our war; we fight to defend
our own country and ourselves just as certainly as if German troops
had landed on our shores. "Paris in three weeks, London in three
months, New York in three years," was a common saying among German
officers. From the beginning of the war France and England and
little Belgium have been fighting our battles. The Atlantic is
wide, but if England had not been our friend and had not protected
us by keeping the German fleet shut up in the North Sea, who can
doubt that Germany would have strained every nerve in the effort to
bombard our coast towns and turn parts at least of our country into
a second Belgium?</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. THE CRUMBLING OF RUSSIA</h2>

<p>In 1916, the Allies had attacked the Central Powers on all
sides, and they planned to do this again in 1917, but on a larger
scale. There were great hopes that this course would bring the war
to an end. Before anything could be done, however, an event came to
pass in Russia which gave the Allies great encouragement and
delighted every lover of freedom.</p>

<p>Russia had a strong army, and when the war broke out the Russian
troops showed themselves fine soldiers. But again and again they
lost thousands of lives because of the lack of ammunition. Then
their favorite commander, the Grand Duke Nicholas, was transferred
to a much less important position than he had been holding. A
strong pro-German was made Prime Minister, and there was reason to
believe that the Czarina herself was at the head of a pro-German
movement. The soldiers had suspected that the failure to send them
ammunition had been caused partly because the government officials
were inefficient, and partly because they meant to make money, no
matter what happened to the soldiers. But far back of these
grievances was the fact that the Russian people had hardly any part
in their own government.</p>

<p>The Czar and his officials had built up a strong army, and felt
safe in its protection to do what they chose; but one Sunday
morning in March, 1917, there were such crowds in the streets of
Petrograd that the military and especially the Cossacks, who were
the special dependence of the Czar, were ordered to shoot at them
to make them disperse. The Cossacks fired as ordered, but they used
blank cartridges, while the crowds cheered. A regiment of soldiers
commanded to shoot the people, shot their officers instead. The
Duma was the nearest approach in Russia to a parliament, and the
Czar had ordered it to dissolve.</p>

<p>Instead of this, the Duma sent him a telegram, saying, "The hour
has struck. The will of the people must prevail," and shut him up
in his palace. The Duma announced promptly that the Russian people
would stand by the Allies; but liberty was so new to the Russians
that they did not know what to do with it. They did not understand
that freedom does not mean freedom to do whatever you choose,
regardless of the rights of others, and they seemed to have the
notion that if only they stopped fighting, everybody would be
friendly. German influence was as strong as ever, and the
anarchists, who believe in having no government at all, became
powerful. Kerensky, who led the new government, did his best, but a
new party, the Bolsheviki, overthrew his rule, declaring openly
that they meant to make peace with Germany.</p>

<p class="caption">THE EASTERN FRONT</p>

<hr>

<p>Russia had failed us. She had broken all her promises to the
Allies never to make a separate peace with Germany; but most
thinking people realized that the Bolsheviki did not represent the
Russian people as a whole, but only one party, and were more
desirous of helping Russia to find herself than angry with her,
though, of course, they were bitterly disappointed. With Russia
making no opposition, many German troops could be released from the
East and brought to the West, and so there was no longer any hope
of ending the war in 1917. This was a dark moment, but it was of
this very moment that the following story was told. It seems that
some officers of a certain Belgian battery of artillery, relieved
from active duty for four days, were at supper in their dug-out
late one evening when a loud knocking was heard at the street door
of the farmhouse overhead. As the story-teller puts it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Presently the Colonel's orderly showed in a mud-begrimed
dispatch-rider, who, after saluting, handed the Colonel a sealed
envelope. We were all electrified and could hardly wait to hear the
news contained in this urgent dispatch.</p>

<p>"The Colonel, drawing a little closer to him one of the bottles
holding a lighted candle, tore open the envelope and proceeded to
read.</p>

<p>"Heavens, what a long time did he study that paper! Was he ever
going to share the news with us? We tried to read it from his eyes.
Was it good or was it bad? Were we to 'attack at dawn,' or did it
mean 'retreat'? Perhaps it contained news about his son, who was
reported 'missing' in October, 1914, and whom he would not believe
dead. But the Colonel was slow to solve our questions. For what
seemed to us an interminably long time he sat there staring at that
sheet of white paper. The old alarm clock on the table ticked the
seconds, and I wondered whether it was not my heart that was
beating so loudly. At last he showed some signs of action. The
Colonel had sat down in order to be near the light; now he rose.
For a second or so longer he stood there with large, wide-opened
eyes staring straight in front of him, and then he announced, in a
slow and trembling voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"GENTLEMEN, AMERICA IS OUR ALLY."</p>

<p>Russia had given soldiers, but, brave as they were, they could
not be depended upon, for no one knew at what moment the Russian
officials would do something or leave something undone that would
make all their bravery of little value. The United States had no
troops ready to send, but it could lend money by millions of
dollars, while Russia had been a borrower. Our navy, however, could
give at once a most valuable service; it could help dispose of the
German submarines.</p>

<p>More and more countries declared war, and all on the side of the
Allies. Cuba, Panama, Siam, Liberia, China, Brazil, all joined in
the struggle for freedom. Siam's declaration said that she was
opposing countries "showing contempt for the principles of humanity
and of respect for small nations." Diplomatic relations were broken
off by Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Costa Rica,
Peru, Uruguay, Ecuador. This was chiefly because of Germany's
piratical warfare and her scorn of small nations. There was much
indignation at the trickery of the German charge d'affaires in
Argentina, for he had induced the Swedish Legation to send as their
own correspondence cipher cablegrams recommending, for instance,
that Argentine vessels should either be spared altogether or else
"spurlos versenkt," that is, sunk without a trace. Not all these
countries had any idea of fighting, but all wished to protest
against the methods and aims of Germany.</p>

<p>Greece had by treaty agreed to help Serbia if she was attacked
by another power; and when the capture of the Dardanelles was
planned, the Premier Venizelos promptly invited the French and
English to land at the Greek port of Saloniki and help his country
to keep her word. The Greek people favored the Allies, but King
Constantine had been educated in Berlin and had married a sister of
the Kaiser. His sympathies were with the Central Powers, and he
refused to keep the treaty, declaring that the country should be
neutral. He dismissed the Premier, although, since Venizelos
possessed the confidence of Parliament, this was contrary to the
constitution. Venizelos now established a provisional government at
Saloniki. There was much reason to fear, first, that the unity of
Greece would be destroyed; and, second, that if Germany should
offer sufficient inducement to the King, even his so-called
neutrality would vanish. The Allies now interfered on three
grounds: first, Greece had been made a kingdom through their
efforts; second, they had placed the present dynasty upon the
throne; and, third, they had guaranteed a constitutional
government. They called upon Constantine to resign, permitting him
to name one of his family as successor. He named Alexander, his
second son. Alexander recalled Venizelos, and in a few days the
Greeks formally entered the war on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p>There was now no hope that the war could be brought to an end in
1917, but the fighting had to go on, of course, for every loss to
the enemy would make the later campaigns less difficult. The French
had borne the brunt of the battles of the Marne and of Verdun, and
now the English took the leading place and attacked the Germans in
northeastern France and in Belgium. Here English, French,
Canadians, and Belgians united. The most tremendous explosion of
mines ever known was caused by a mine laid by the English, in which
1,000,000 pounds of high explosives were suddenly set off. Field
Marshal Haig had a fashion of striking a blow now here, now there,
just where it was not expected and of driving the Germans back at
every attack. When the year was almost at an end, an advance upon
the French town of Cambrai, held by the Germans, gave the armored
tanks an opportunity to show what they could do. They waddled on
unconcernedly, paying no attention to holes, small trees, or barbed
wire, and apparently not seeing them at all. Some one said of a
favorite tank, "If it cannot silence a machine gun in any other
way, it can simply sit down upon it." Against these monsters,
nothing was of any power except a heavy siege gun brought to close
range, not a particularly easy matter to manage. The Germans were
forced to draw back in several places. As was their custom, they
took pains to devastate every foot of the country over which they
passed. The Allies were forced to retire somewhat, but, taken as a
whole, the campaign in Flanders was in their favor.</p>

<p>On the Italian Front matters had been going on well through the
summer. The Italians had captured many prisoners, they had taken
mountains whose position made them of great value, and they had
pushed on till only ten miles lay between them and Trieste. Then
came the dropping-out of Russia. The Italians were splendid
fighters, but German troops were set free, not only for the
Western, but also for the Italian Front. German forces and guns
were rushed to the rescue of Austria-Hungary. The Italians fought
like the heroes they were. They were obliged to retreat slowly to
the Piave River, but there they took their stand and faced the
invaders. This halted the invasion, and England and France soon
sent troops to Italy.</p>

<p>In 1916 the English were in Mesopotamia, trying to get to
Baghdad; but when they reached Kut-el-Amara, they were forced to
surrender or starve. They chose to surrender; but in 1917 they made
a "whirlwind campaign "from Kut-el-Amara straight to Baghdad. There
was a three-days battle, the Turks were completely routed, and the
English soldiers were free to dream as many dreams as they liked
about the good Caliph, Haroun al Raschid. But the capture of
Baghdad gave more than the pleasure of dreaming; it produced a
strong effect upon the people of the Orient generally. The failure
of 1916 had jostled the English from their pedestal of power in the
East, but now they were restored in the eyes of the Orientals.</p>

<p>More than six hundred miles from Baghdad, across the Syrian
Desert, is the most famous country of the world, Palestine, where
Jesus was born. In the southern part of Palestine is Beersheba, and
people use the expression "from Dan to Beersheba," meaning from one
end of a land to the other. Near Beersheba were English troops
under General Allenby, and they soon captured the place. The story
of the war in the East is now connected at every turn with Bible
history, for the English next took Gaza, and Gaza is where the Old
Testament story says that Samson took hold of the two middle
pillars of the prison and brought the building down upon his
enemies and himself. It was on the road between Gaza and Jerusalem
that the Apostle Philip met the treasurer of Queen Candace riding
in his chariot and reading some of the prophecies of the Old
Testament, and on his invitation took a seat beside him and
explained to him that they referred to Jesus.</p>

<p>After a number of fights the Turks fell back on Jerusalem, while
the English pushed on after them, the right moving up directly from
Beersheba, the left marching up the Mediterranean coast to Joppa,
where Saint Peter visited Simon the tanner. Joppa was captured, and
soon the English were only three and a half miles from Jerusalem. A
line of hills lay between them, but in two weeks they had crossed
these and were before the gates of the city. The Turks were obliged
to evacuate it, and retreated to the northward. In 1898 the Kaiser
had visited Jerusalem, and a break was made in the walls so that he
might ride in where no one had ever ridden before. The English
troops entered in no such fashion. They dismounted before the Jaffa
(Joppa) Gate, and walked into the Holy City as simply and
reverently as the pilgrims of centuries ago.</p>

<p>Jerusalem has had a strange and varied history. It has been
captured again and again&mdash;by Egypt, Babylon, Persia,
Macedonia, Rome, and in the seventh century by the Mohammedans. In
1096 the series of expeditions called crusades began whose object
was to rescue the Holy Land from the Turks. Jerusalem was captured
and was Christian for a century. Then it was taken by Saladin,
Sultan of Egypt and Syria. He is the brave and knightly enemy whom
Scott pictures in <i>The Talisman</i>, the enemy whom the equally
brave and knightly Richard the Lion-hearted tried in vain to
conquer. Jerusalem remained in the hands of the Mohammedans from
that day to the one when General Allenby brought it again under
Christian control.</p>

<p>Jerusalem is sacred in the eyes of Jews, Christians, and
Mohammedans. The Mohammedans, of course, expected no favors from
the conquerors, but General Allenby, by a single act of tactful
courtesy, made it clear to them that Jerusalem would be free to
all. He not only issued a proclamation that every building, shrine,
and holy place would be carefully maintained, but he asked the
Mohammedan guardian of the Holy Sepulcher to retain his office and
its salary, not as an emblem of power, but in memory of one Caliph
Omar and the early Mohammedans, who, long before the days of
Turkish rule, had taken the utmost care to preserve the sacred
places.</p>

<p>The Jews have been for many centuries a people without a
country, and long before the war a strong desire was felt among
them to establish a national home for themselves in the Holy Land.
England has expressed her interest in this plan and has declared
that she will do all in her power to assist in carrying it out.</p>

<p>Jerusalem was taken during the last month of 1917. During this
year, the piratical submarine warfare of Germany had destroyed much
shipping, but it had brought the United States into the war.
Germany and Austria had made gains in Italy, and Russia had fallen
out of the race; but on the other hand, the Allies had made
progress on the Western Front and had won important victories in
Mesopotamia and Palestine.</p>

<p>In the early days of 1918 the English army reported the taking
of Jericho. This was not especially difficult, though probably less
easy than its capture as described in the Old Testament story, when
its walls are said to have fallen at the sound of the Hebrew
trumpets. For military reasons, this is a valuable place for the
Allies to hold.</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1917, the Germans took Riga and threatened
Petrograd. They then summoned the Bolsheviki to a peace conference
at Brest-Litovsk. Meanwhile, the Ukraine, an exceedingly fertile
district in southwestern Russia, the home of 20,000,000 people,
declared itself independent of Russia and made peace with Germany.
This was the work of the "Reactionaries" of Ukraine. The Bolsheviki
of the district opposed the peace, and Germany overcame them by
force of arms. The Germans, then, were fighting the Bolsheviki in
the Ukraine and holding a peace conference with them in central
Russia at the same time. The Bolsheviki seem to have been obliged
to yield; and they signed a German peace treaty by which Germany
holds not only the Ukraine, but nearly all the Baltic provinces and
much of Esthonia and Poland. Germany never forgets to look far
ahead, and the Bolsheviki were forced as the price of peace to
grant her many commercial privileges. So much of Russia now being
in her hands, Germany took from her quantities of
booty&mdash;cannon, machine guns, thousands of motor cars, and a
vast amount of food and other supplies.</p>

<p>Russia is not so much a country that has broken her promises as
one that has crumbled to pieces. To help Russia to find herself is
an important part of the business of the Allies. The intelligent
Russians long for peace and law and order. They are eager to win
liberty and to free themselves from the clutches of Germany, and
are begging for the aid of the Allies; and the Allies are ready to
give this aid.</p>

<p>In Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean and in Archangel on the White
Sea immense quantities of food and munitions are stored. The
Russians living in this part of the country asked the Allies to
protect these, and to keep them from falling into the hands of the
Germans. The result was the prompt appearance of American marines,
bluejackets, and soldiers, together with English and French naval
forces in the White Sea. To the eastward, on the Siberian coast, a
quarter of the way around the world, lies Vladivostok, and here,
too, were similar stores. Japan lies close at hand, and with the
aid of the other allies, her forces entered this city and saved it
from the Germans.</p>

<p>A new ally has arisen from the very heart of the Central Powers,
the Czecho-Slovaks, inhabitants of northwestern Austria and the
adjoining territory of Hungary. Four hundred years ago, these
people, in order to drive back the Turks, formed a free federation
with Austria and Hungary, and elected a king. Later, Austria
declared the crown hereditary. The Czechs resisted in the Thirty
Years' War, but were beaten, their nobles beheaded or exiled, and
their property confiscated. Although thus overpowered, the Czechs
have always longed for independence. After the Franco-Prussian War
of 1871, they alone among the Austrian parliaments protested
against Germany's annexation of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>When the war began, in 1914, the Czechs were forced to join the
Austrian army, but thousands deserted and other thousands were made
willing captives by the Russians, and many of these joined the
Russian army. Early in 1918, the Bolsheviki Government agreed to
allow these Czechs to cross Siberia and go on their way around the
world to join the French army. Germany objected, and in spite of
their agreement the Bolsheviki suddenly attacked the Czechs. The
indignant Czechs fought fiercely and won the day, marching to the
northward to the railroad that runs from Petrograd to the Pacific,
and entering Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Thus it is that those Russians and Siberians who love liberty
can gather around the Czechs as around a standard. There are
10,000,000 Czechs and about the same number of Siberians. Siberia
has declared her independence and her enmity to Germany. It is the
business of the Allies to strengthen Siberia and central Russia,
and in so doing to hold fast many millions of strong friends of
liberty and enlightenment.</p>

<p>The failure of the German offensive in the spring of 1918 led,
throughout the following summer, to a continually improved
situation for the Allies. Gains of importance were made on all
fronts, and the doom of the Central Powers to ultimate defeat
appeared inevitable. During September, the Allies' success reached
even to the forcing of Bulgaria to unconditional surrender. That
country was put out of the war, and the first breach was made in
the Pan-German plan for Middle Europe, and for the Berlin to
Baghdad Railway. There seemed also to be fore-shadowed the collapse
of Turkey, and perhaps of Austria. To hasten this, the Allies
prepared to fight on&mdash;harder than ever.</p>

<a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>
<h2>X. THE AMERICANS AS HELPERS</h2>

<p>It is one thing to become an ally, and quite another to have an
army prepared to make our proffered alliance of value. After the
indifference with which Germany met American protests in regard to
the sinking of the Lusitania and the U-boat warfare, the thinking
people of the country realized that war would probably be forced
upon us. In the summer of 1915 training camps were formed at
Plattsburg and elsewhere; and there business men, college
professors and students, lawyers, authors, publishers, and others
spent a month in learning how to be soldiers. Here was the
"intensive training" of which we hear so much. The only difference
between this and ordinary training is that in the intensive there
is no dawdling; every man has a reason for doing his best, and he
does it. The result at Plattsburg was that in one month many
hundreds of men learned about warfare and the use of arms what
would ordinarily have required four months of training. They were
not prepared to command armies in battle, but they were prepared to
train raw troops in the manual of arms, to teach them how to care
for their health in a campaign, and, perhaps most valuable of all,
to inspire them with a fuller appreciation of team work, with an
eagerness to serve their country and a comprehension of, the
nobility of such service.</p>

<p>An army was raised by "selective draft," that is, composed of
strong, well men upon whom, as far as possible, no one was
dependent for support, and who were not engaged in work necessary
to the war, such as shipbuilding, munition-making, etc. To every
soldier or sailor the Government gave a life insurance policy, in
amounts varying up to $10,000; the premiums, amounting to 80 or 90
cents a month on each $1000, to be taken from his pay. The
Government also gave him the privilege of taking out additional
insurance up to another $10,000 at the same rates that he would pay
in time of peace. For each $1000 of this he pays about $8 a
year.</p>

<p>The preparations ordered by the Government were enormous. As one
small detail, 45,000,000 yards of cotton cloth had to be purchased,
besides 21,000,000 yards of drilling; the building of ships,
aeroplanes, and submarine chasers was ordered. Cantonments, or
camps wherein our troops may live and be trained for the army, had
to be built; and it is no small matter to build almost in a night
sixteen wooden cities capable of housing some 40,000 men each, with
water-supply, drainage, electric lights and power, barracks,
hospitals, stables, sheds, shops, and storehouses. The average
cantonment has twenty miles of sewer and forty miles of water
mains. In these cantonments the men are taught not only to know the
manual of arms, but to dig trenches, to handle guns and take care
of them, to use bayonets, hand grenades, and bombs, to keep clean,
to care for their feet, to stand and run and walk in the least
fatiguing manner, to obey orders, and, as one detail, to learn that
the salute is a mark, not merely of the deference of a private to
an officer, but of the respect due to the uniform of the United
States. The prescribed form is for the man of lower rank to salute
first, but if the officer neglected to return the salute, he would
be punished.</p>

<p>Before the summer of 1918 had come to an end, some 3,300,000
American boys were under arms, half of them in France and the other
half in training camps. Command of the Allied forces had been put
into the hands of General Foch, whom Marshal Joffre called "the
first strategist in Europe." Week after week Foch repulsed the
drives of the Germans, holding firmly to his positions. At length
the hour came for which he had been planning and preparing. He now
took the offensive; blow followed blow, and from the middle of July
the Germans have been in retreat. Territory has been gained, of
course, but the greatest gain has been the defeat of Germany's
plans to win the war before the end of 1918. From all directions
come praises of the bravery of the American boys. The Germans had
not supposed it possible for a few months' training to make the
Americans into acceptable soldiers; but these same boys, fresh from
college and farm and workshop, have held their own against the
flower of the German army, the famous "Prussian Guards" and the
Bavarian Guards, veterans of many battles.</p>

<p>Immigrants have been coming to this country in vast numbers, and
we have not taken sufficient pains to see that they learned to
speak English. Now that many of them are in our army, they must
learn to understand orders at least, and therefore the cantonments
have classes for them. A visitor to one of these classes thus
pictures a lesson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In one of these groups one of the exercises for the evening
consisted in practicing the challenge when on sentry duty. Each
pupil of the group (there were four of Italian and two of Slavic
birth) shouldered in turn the long-handled stove shovel and aimed
it at the teacher, who ran along the side of the room as if to
evade the guard. The pupil called out in broken speech: 'Halt! Who
goes there?' The answer came from the teacher: 'Friend.' And then,
in as yet unintelligible English (the voices of innumerable
ancestors struggling in their throats to pronounce it), the words:
'Advance and give the countersign.'"</p>

<p>So it is that these men of foreign birth are learning the
language of the country which has given them a home and which they
are preparing to defend.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">A PART OF ONE OF OUR GREAT ARMY TRAINING
CAMPS.<br>
Each of these camps is a city complete in itself, with lodging and
mess quarters, baths, kitchens, bakeries, water-supply adn drainage
systems, hospitals, roads, railways, etc. After a tour of
inspection, Former President Taft wrote an enthusiastic report upon
the health and morale of the men in training. "They are," he said,
"the finest material for the making of an army ever seen in any
country."</p>

<hr>

<p>Americans who have gone to France have not all been expert
linguists, and amusing stories come back to us of their struggles
with the French language. One is said to have wondered why so many
Frenchmen named their dogs "Ici" (<i>here</i>). Another wanted to
tell his peasant hostess that her cow had wandered away, but could
say only, "Madame du Tait promenades"; and there is also the
pathetic tale of a sturdy Australian who wanted a bath, but knew no
French except "Bonjour."</p>

<p>In our navy officers and men had received a thorough and
systematic training, and were quite accustomed to being prompt and
efficient. It is now, in man power, five times as large as it was
before the war; but its needs are great, for it has the task of
protecting our coast, of convoying merchantmen and troop ships, of
helping our allies to destroy submarines, and of being ready at a
moment's notice for anything that may need to be done. Only
first-class men can find any place in the navy. Every ship
maintains a school, and any man who is willing to work can acquire
the education necessary for a commissioned officer.</p>

<p>All this preparation for war has been enormously costly. We no
longer talk about hundreds of thousands of dollars, we talk about
millions and billions. Every bit of wood or iron or platinum must
be paid for, every workman who drives a nail into a ship must have
his wages. Where does the money come from? The Government pays the
bills, but the Government has no money except what it gets from the
people, and there are in general only two ways in which it can get
it from them. One is by taxation, and the other is by "Liberty
Loans," that is, by selling government bonds or promises to pay.
This is the safest investment in the land. Manufacturers and
railroads and all sorts of companies might fail, but the Government
would be the last thing in the country to fail. A bond is exactly
as safe as a bank bill, and in one respect it is of more value,
namely, the bond draws interest, and the bank bill does not. Not
every one can put $50 into even so safe an investment as a
government bond; and therefore War Savings Stamps were issued at
$4.12, which in 1923 will be redeemed by the Government at $5.
There are also Thrift Stamps at 25 cents each. Sixteen of these,
with the addition of a few cents, will purchase a War Savings
Stamp.</p>

<p>The Government builds the cantonments, pays the troops, and
feeds and clothes them; but a very large amount of money is spent
on troops which is the free gift of the people at home to those who
will defend them and their rights abroad. Much of this money goes
through various organizations. One of these is the Young Men's
Christian Association. When this Association asked for volunteers,
this is what it said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is no call to ninnies and milksops. The Y.M.C.A. needs
real men, preferably men who have had some broad and grueling
experience of life; men of education, yes; but, above that, men
capable of understanding, sympathy, and an indefinite deal of hard,
exacting work. Men who can turn a Ford inside out; men who can play
the piano and lead five hundred others in singing; men who are
trained in athletics; men six feet high and three feet wide and
eighteen inches thick; men who understand what Christianity really
means; men with humor and leadership who have been earning a
hundred dollars a week and are willing to live on ten dollars a
week. In other words, MEN."</p>

<p>The Y.M.C.A. does its best for the soldier boys both here and
across the ocean. It provides "huts," which are sometimes a
comfortable building that will hold several thousand, sometimes a
tiny shed carefully camouflaged from the eyes of the enemy, and
sometimes a dug-out twenty-five feet under ground; but whatever the
hut may be, it is always a place where the men are welcome, where
they can rest, play games, write letters, read magazines, see
moving pictures and minstrel shows, and listen to concerts and
phonographs. It opens classes and gets books for those who wish to
study or read. It cheers up the man who is blue and discouraged and
lonely, arranges talks by bright and interesting lecturers, and
good strong religious talks, often by men who know what it is to be
under fire. The secretaries of the "Y" are sometimes in as much
danger as the men; and when a secretary hands a half-frozen soldier
a cup of hot coffee, it may have been made at the risk of the
secretary's life.</p>

<p>Often a Y.M.C.A. secretary rather enjoys attempting the
impossible, and he usually succeeds. One evening the secretary at
one of the cantonments learned that four hundred men were to start
on a two-days march the following day. It took quick work, but when
the men arrived, in the afternoon, there stood a 40 x 60 foot tent
with piano, tables, chairs, couches, graphophones, stationery,
games, the daily papers, bats, balls, gloves, etc. Even a telephone
had been installed, and souvenir postals from the nearest town were
on sale.</p>

<p>The Y.M.C.A. is a Protestant organization, and the Knights of
Columbus is a Roman Catholic. Mass is celebrated in the Knights of
Columbus building, and is not in the huts, unless a priest borrows
one for the purpose; but the work of the two organizations is
exactly the same, and one description applies to both. Every man in
camp is invited to both buildings at all times, and is just as free
to go to one secretary as to the other.</p>

<p>It is estimated that at least 50,000 Jews are in the American
army, and to add to their comfort and give them the services of
their own faith, the Young Men's Hebrew Association and the order
of B'nai B'rith have been most active. In the cantonments the rooms
of the Y.M.C.A. are thrown open for the use of the Jewish
chaplains; and Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Jews work together
in sincere harmony and appreciation of one another's value.</p>

<p>The Red Cross is known wherever there is war or fire or famine
or earthquake or any suffering that needs its help. To respect its
flag is not only common decency, but it is international law, which
forty-three nations have solemnly agreed to observe. To fire upon a
Red Cross ship or hospital is an atrocious crime; yet this crime
has been committed by the Germans over and over. Of course, in the
European war the Red Cross is on hand. Large numbers of the best
doctors and nurses have entered its work, and by their skillful
treatment have saved thousands of lives. Prisoners worked by
Germany until they are feeble and helpless are sent back to France
to die; but the Red Cross cares for them and restores them to
health if possible.</p>

<p>The Red Cross specializes in emergencies. Nearly 7,000,000
slings, bandages, hammocks, etc., were asked for, and within two
weeks they were on their way. One hundred and seventy Americans
were rescued from a ship torpedoed on the French coast. A telegram
went to Paris, and on the instant a worker started for the spot,
telegraphed to Washington the names of the survivors, lent money to
those who had lost their own, and saw to it that the injured were
well cared for. A more startling summons was received by a Red
Cross official in Paris. It said, "750 children have been thrust
upon my hands." It is no wonder that it added, "Send help." These
were children from a town under bombardment. Gas bombs were used,
and as the children were too young to wear gas masks, they had been
hurried away. The day after the reception of the telegram, eight
Red Cross workers were on hand, and in an amazingly short time the
little folk were clean and comfortable and well cared for. Each
nation has its own branch of the Red Cross. The Red Cross in France
not only cares for the children and the sick, but it sees to it
that the families of soldiers do not starve. It teaches young
mothers how to care for their babies. It has even established lines
of transportation. The railroads had more than they could do, and
the Red Cross, without regard to weather or red tape or anything
else, set lines of motor trucks to work, and before long was doing
its own transporting both promptly and well.</p>

<p>The Omaha Indians of this country have a chapter of the Red
Cross, and early in 1918 they held an auction sale for its benefit.
After a prayer the bidding began, and it was reckless bidding, for
every Indian was ready to open his purse wide to buy chickens,
pigs, corn, goats, preserved fruit&mdash;no matter what&mdash;so
long as the money went to help the soldiers. The Indians from the
first have been deeply interested in the war. "I have heard of a
peaceful people brought low by mighty guns," said an aged chief. He
promptly sold a load of corn and sent twenty dollars to the Belgian
Minister at Washington, who responded by a note thanking him "not
alone for his gift of money, but more particularly for the kindness
of an understanding heart." The Indians fully appreciated the need
of Liberty Loans and to the first three they subscribed
$13,000,000. Who was it that said the only good Indian was a dead
Indian?</p>

<p>Since the war began, societies without number have been formed
to help the suffering people of Europe. One of the oldest is that
of the "American Fund for French Wounded." We have never forgotten
that France came to our help in Revolutionary days, when we were
struggling&mdash;not with the people of England&mdash;they were
never against us&mdash;but with an obstinate and short-sighted
sovereign. Moreover, to help France was to keep the enemy from our
own shores. So it was that surgical dressings, garments of all
needed varieties, and all sorts of hospital supplies went to France
from the "French Wounded" by thousands, and did much to strengthen
the old friendship between the two countries.</p>

<p>The Society of Friends does not as a whole approve of fighting,
but it does approve of helping to build up again. Friends have gone
to France, Italy, Russia, wherever there is need, and there is need
everywhere. They make an old chateau into a hospital, a former
barracks into a children's home, they run a factory for making the
most practical sort of artificial limbs and also one to make
furniture for the people who are coming back to their ruined homes.
They sew and nurse and care for refugees. Every week they send
great cases of clothing across the water, and they do not forget to
slip in boxes of candy for the little folk. The Friends go to the
barren and ragged country where once stood neat little villages and
happy homes. They repair the cottages or set up portable ones, and
give to the suffering refugees a hope of having once more a
home.</p>

<p>The college boys were prompt in looking about to see what they
could do for the country in her hour of need. Many enlisted. Some
entered aviation, some drove ambulances for the wounded, often a
college sent half her students to the army or navy. Others formed
companies and were drilled by army officers so as to be ready when
their time should come. Soon it was plain that with the Allies
depending upon us for food and so many of our men in the army, some
one must do farmwork. Thousands of boys from colleges and high
schools set to work and helped to raise corn and potatoes and
whatever else would help to keep hunger away.</p>

<p>College girls, too, were thinking hard. They knit and sewed and
gave their spending money for the soldiers and sailors. War courses
in hygiene were promptly arranged. Canning, first aid, food
conservation, and care of the sick were soon added to their
studies. Several colleges for women sent each an ambulance or more
to the field. Many college girls spent their summer vacation doing
farmwork&mdash;not the kind that is composed of one hour in the
field and three in a hammock, but eight hours a day of real work
for the season. "I didn't raise my hand to be a blister," said one,
looking ruefully at her palm; but evidently she changed her mind,
for she and every other girl of her group worked till the end of
the summer. In the spring of 1918 Vassar announced that as soon as
commencement was over the college buildings and grounds would
become a great training camp for college women from twenty-one to
thirty-one years of age who wished to become trained nurses. This
is the college women's Plattsburg, and just as at Plattsburg men
were rapidly and "intensively" trained to become officers, so at
this training camp for nurses the summer's work was arranged to
count for one year in the three-years course for registered nurses.
Before the middle of May five hundred had applied for admission,
and a waiting list was begun.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army has from the first been at the front in war
work. It has no wealthy members, but during the first year of the
war the American branch raised $25,000 for the troops. It has no
office hours, and even when the drivers of the supply wagons come
in at unearthly times in the morning, biscuits, hot coffee,
doughnuts, and sometimes even pies are waiting with a word of cheer
and appreciation for every man. "Salvationists go," said Commander
Evangeline Booth, "to comfort and encourage in every way
possible&mdash;with rest rooms, refreshment bars, recreation
arrangements; with song, with music, with dispatching and securing
messages to and from the boys' homes, with the Bible, with
affection, with advice, with teaching, with prayer, and with a glad
spirit." A soldier who had lost his way and was creeping cautiously
about in the darkness described the joy that he felt when he heard
singing,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Then we'll roll the old chariot along,<br>
And we won't drag on behind,"&mdash;</p>

<p>and realized that he was close to a Salvationist tent. It is the
rule for the military salute to be given to men only, but the
French troops at Rheims always gave it to two women officers of the
Salvation Army who fearlessly remained in town and served them in
every possible way. The climax came when the hungry soldiers
brought a whole ox for the two women to cook for them over a small
gas stove and an oil lamp. It was done within twenty-four hours,
and surely women who could accomplish that feat deserved the salute
of at least one army.</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts had decided, even before we entered the war, what
they could do to help. They carry no guns, but it is not the man
with the gun who does all the work of a great war. Not every one
realizes that there are about 200,000 on the lists of the Boy
Scouts, besides 350,000 young men who have had the valuable Boy
Scout training, to say nothing of 50,000 men who have been
connected with them as advisers and scout masters. More than half a
million of boys and men who have been trained to see and hear
exactly, to think quickly, and to know what to do in an emergency,
is a valuable asset for any country, whether in war or out of it.
In war a Scout can render first aid to the sick or injured. He can
send messages by wire, wireless, or wigwagging, he can carry a
message promptly and repeat it accurately, and he can get through
places where a man cannot. He can work on a farm; he can act as
guard of property and give alarm in case of danger. All these
things he has often done, and when the United States entered the
war, the Boy Scouts was one of the few organizations that were
prepared to do their part from the first.</p>

<p>Girl Scouts, too, and Camp-Fire Girls had promised to be loyal,
and when war came, they translated their promise of loyalty into
service. Their work was not limited to carrying pretty
knitting-bags by any means, for they offered themselves promptly to
the Red Cross for orders, and the work assigned them was not always
agreeable. From Eastport, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, they swept
workroom floors and picked oakum. In New York they opened a Red
Cross workroom of their own. In Philadelphia they raised by a
bazaar $800 for buying knitting yarn. They have learned the best
methods of canning, and some of them have been specially trained to
teach these things to schools, clubs, and churches. In short,
"wherever a girl's size war job has offered itself, these Girls
have taken it on." Both they and the Boy Scouts have been excellent
solicitors for the Liberty Loans, and both fully deserve to wear a
badge on which is written "America first."</p>

<p>The Government, of course, provides for the care of its animals
in the war, but many emergencies arise in which a private society
can act much more quickly. Therefore, the Secretary of War invited
the American Humane Association to aid in this work, and the
American Red Star was promptly organized. More than six hundred
anti-cruelty societies were eager to help, and even the natives of
Alaska are contributing generously and wearing Red Star buttons
with the utmost pride and satisfaction. The Red Star, like the Red
Cross, "specializes in emergencies," and at times of immediate need
officers are free to call for whatever is needed. Their requests
have ranged all the way from blankets and bandages to a veterinary
hospital, and every one has been promptly filled.</p>

<p>The American Library Association is doing a fine work in
providing books for the men in camp and "over there." Not rubbish,
of course, but books of value in all lines are in demand. In one
camp there are seven hundred college boys. Some colleges give
credit for study done in camp, and the boys want up-to-date college
textbooks. Many foreigners want simple books for beginners in
English. Good novels, interesting histories and biographies,
especially on French subjects, are called for. The Association
collects money for books, and every public library is a station to
which books for the soldiers may be sent.</p>

<p>So it is that every person in the land who has any genuine love
for his country is trying to help her. Well-known artists are
designing posters and doing rough camouflage work; actors and
musicians are using their popularity to gain dollars for the
soldiers, and using their talents to entertain them in the camps;
men with heavy business cares are neglecting these and devoting
their time and ability to the needs of the Government. "My country
asks me to help her," may well be the proud slogan of those who
help make munitions, or drive nails into ships, or save food from
careless waste, or do their bit in any other way. Even little
children are helping to win the war; and this is right, for the war
is waged expressly for their sake. Every man in the trenches of the
Allies is fighting for them. "You must always remember," one brave
soldier wrote home to his boys and girls, "that your father came
into this great war for the sake of all little children. The grown
folk will not stay here many years longer, and it would not have
been difficult for them to make some sort of peace that would
endure for a time. They are not struggling for themselves, but to
make the world safe for their children and the children of those
children. "The glory of the Present is to make the Future
Free"&mdash;and this is why we are in the war.</p>

<p>There is only one thing worse than war, and that is to stand one
side when we ought to be fighting. We have not taken up arms for
revenge, or to gain land or wealth or power. We have entered this
war to make sure that right rather than might shall rule. It is a
struggle between truth and falsehood, between mercy and cruelty,
between freedom and slavery. It is a struggle that we have got to
win.</p>

<p class="poem">"For right is right, since God is God;<br>
And right the day must win;<br>
To doubt would be disloyalty,<br>
To falter would be sin."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>POSTSCRIPT&mdash;THE END OF THE
WAR</h2>

<p>When the last sentence was written, no one doubted that Germany
would surrender some time; the only question was "When?" Her last
frantic drive came to an end with her defeat in the second battle
of the Marne. In the autumn of 1918 she requested an armistice,
with a view, it was generally believed, to creating an opportunity
to get her troops, ordnance, munitions, and supplies safely back
into Germany. She could then rest and prepare for another drive in
the spring of 1919.</p>

<p>Nothing but unconditional surrender could be accepted, and the
Allied lines pushed on. "Are you going to France?" some one asked
an American soldier as he stood waiting on the wharf. "No, ma'am;
to Berlin," he replied.</p>

<p>People who were following on their maps the course of the war
moved every day the flags of the Allies a little nearer the German
boundaries. The German plan had been to make a drive, then rest and
take plenty of time to prepare for another drive. General Foch's
plan was to keep up a continuous battle, striking first at one
point, then at another, then at two together, no German ever
knowing where the next blow would fall. The result was that at the
end of his nine weeks' campaign the line of the Germans on the
Western Front was everywhere crumbling, while the Allies' line was
as powerful as at first. Guns, supplies, and prisoners were
captured in large numbers by the Allies. Japan was winning
victories in Siberia, and England in Palestine. On the Italian
Front and in the Balkans the Allies were moving resistlessly
forward. Austria begged for peace. Turkey signed an armistice that
was really a surrender. Troops of the Allies took possession of the
forts on the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. The Turkish army was
demobilized, and a great force of Allied mine-sweepers set to work
to clear the straits of mines.</p>

<p>It was evident that the end of the war was at hand. Before the
middle of October, 1918, the Belgian authorities sent word to the
Belgian refugees in England to prepare for a return to their own
country. People watched eagerly for news of the ending of the war,
and in the gray of the morning of November 11, which it has since
been proposed to call "Victory Day," the cable under the sea
thrilled with the announcement of an armistice between the Allies
and Germany. Sleepy travelers were aroused by the tooting of their
locomotives responding to the bells and whistles and shouts in
every city and village along their lines. Long before daylight the
streets of cities were full of happy, good-natured crowds. "The
boys are coming home!" millions of Americans were saying joyfully
to themselves. It is no wonder that boys and girls danced and sang;
that men tossed up their hats and raided the toy shops for
everything that would make a noise; that they rang bells and blew
horns; that clouds of confetti swept around the sky-scrapers of New
York; that processions marched through the streets of every city;
and that when evening came, buildings were illuminated, bands
played, and the whole country gave itself up to rejoicing. Most
interesting of all the celebrations was that of the Sioux Indians
of South Dakota. They danced their ancient Victory Dance and made
as many speeches as their white brothers. One chief gravely
expressed his joy for the victory over "barbarism such as Indians
never heard of before." Another said of the Germans, "Let them put
away their barbarism, and then we will give their nation its old
place by the sacred campfire of the nations."</p>

<p>This armistice was the same as a surrender, because of the
strictness of its terms. They were neither cruel nor unmilitary,
but they were severe, because the nations could put no trust in the
word of their treacherous foe, and to protect themselves they were
obliged to leave Germany powerless to renew the warfare. They
required that she should withdraw from the lands that she had
invaded and make good all damage as far as possible. She must also
vacate a long stretch of territory on the western side of the
Rhine. Three great cities in this territory, Cologne, Coblenz, and
Mayence, were to be occupied by the Allies. Another stretch of
land, twenty-five miles wide, lying on the eastern side of the
Rhine, the German troops were required to evacuate. Military stores
and equipments must be surrendered, and both military and civilian
prisoners must be set free. The quantity of material to be given up
was enormous; for instance, 30,000 machine guns and 10,000 motor
trucks. All money and securities which had been stolen from the
countries of the Allies must be restored. The treaties imposed upon
Russia and Rumania must be abandoned.</p>

<p>Most humiliating of all, perhaps, but necessary, were the terms
imposed upon the German navy. Battleships, cruisers, submarines,
and destroyers in large numbers had to be surrendered. To receive
their surrender, two hundred and forty British ships of war were
drawn up in the North Sea, together with French and American
fighting ships, "Comrades of the Mist," as Admiral Beatty called
them. No opportunity for treachery was allowed, and the guns which
had last been fired at the battle of Jutland were in such order
that in thirty seconds a broadside could have been poured out.
"German fleet in sight on the starboard bow," called the lookout
man in a matter-of-fact fashion, as the fleet advanced in
procession. "The German flag will be lowered at sunset," commanded
Admiral Beatty, "and will not be hoisted again without permission."
At the close of the ceremonial, the English sailors gave three
rousing cheers for their commander. "Thank you," said the Admiral;
and added, "I always told you they would have to come out."</p>

<p>So it is that the end of the war has come, but not the end of
difficulties. Germany is in the uproar of anarchy, and the streets
of Berlin have flowed with the blood of her citizens. The Kaiser
has abdicated his throne; he fled to Holland even before the
armistice was signed. The Crown Prince is virtually a prisoner on a
little island belonging to Holland. Germans bitterly regret that
they have lost the war and are angry with the leaders who brought
them into disaster and downfall; but neither Kaiser, junkers, nor
everyday citizens have expressed the least penitence for the
suffering which they have brought upon the world. How can these
people be helped to "put away their barbarism," as the Sioux Indian
said, and be fitted to take a place "by the sacred campfire of the
nations"?</p>

<p>And shall this barbarism go unpunished? "The country that
recklessly plunged the world into agony must accept a stern
reckoning," said Lloyd George, Premier of England. This stern
"reckoning" is not because, in the madness of warfare, occasional
cruelty might have been shown, but because such cruelty is the
settled policy and belief of a nation of more than 60,000,000
people, and the world must never again be called upon to suffer
from it.</p>

<p>Many other questions are pressing upon us. How shall Russia be
aided to find herself? Where shall the border-lines of the various
countries&mdash;new and old&mdash;be drawn? Shall there be
disarmament, and to what extent? What laws of trade must be formed?
What is meant by the "freedom of the seas"? How can it be made sure
that the smaller peoples may live unmolested by more powerful
neighbors, greedy of wealth and territory? Shall there be a League
of Nations, and what shall be its province and its powers?</p>

<p>It is such questions as these that must be answered at the Peace
Table by representatives of the nations that have struggled
together to withstand the onslaught of Germany. It is upon the
wisdom and justice with which these questions are answered that,
perhaps for many generations to come, the peace of the world will
depend.</p>

APPENDIX: PRESIDENT WILSON'S PEACE TERMS

<p>The following are the general terms of peace, as stated by
President Wilson, with the agreement of the Allies.</p>

<p><i>From the President's Message of January 8, 1918</i>
</p>

<p>1. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there
shall be no private international understandings of any kind, but
diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.</p>

<p>2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside
territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas
may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the
enforcement of international covenants.</p>

<p>3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and
the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the
nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its
maintenance.</p>

<p>4. Adequate guaranties given and taken that national armaments
will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic
safety.</p>

<p>5. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of
all colonial claims based upon a strict observance of the principle
that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests
of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the
equitable claims of the Government whose title is to be
determined.</p>

<p>6. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such settlement
of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and
freest co-operation of the other nations of the world in obtaining
for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the
independent determination of her own political development and
national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the
society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing;
and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she
may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by
her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of
their good-will, of their comprehension of her needs as
distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent
and unselfish sympathy.</p>

<p>7. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and
restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she
enjoys in common with the other free nations. No other single act
will serve as this will to restore confidence among the nations in
the laws which they have themselves set and demanded for the
government of their relations with one another. Without this
healing act the whole structure and validity of international law
is forever impaired.</p>

<p>8. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions
restored and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the
matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the
world for nearly fifty years, should be righted in order that peace
may once more be made secure in the interest of all.</p>

<p>9. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected
along clearly recognizable lines of nationality.</p>

<p>10. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the
nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded
the freest opportunity of autonomous development.</p>

<p>11. Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated;
occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure
access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan States
to one another determined by friendly council along historically
established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international
guaranties of the political and economic independence and
territorial integrity of the several Balkan States should be
entered into.</p>

<p>12. The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be
assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are
now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of
life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous
development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a
free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under
international guaranties.</p>

<p>13. An independent Polish State should be erected which should
include territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations,
which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and
whose political and economic independence should be guarantied by
inter-national covenant.</p>

<p>14. A general association of nations must be formed under
specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guaranties
of political independence and territorial integrity to great and
small states alike.</p>

<p><i>From the President's Speech of February 11, 1918</i>
</p>

<p>1. That each part of the final settlement must be based upon the
essential justice of that particular case and upon such adjustments
as are most likely to bring a peace that will be permanent.2</p>

<p>2. That peoples and provinces are not to be bartered about from
sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were mere chattels and pawns
in a game, even the great game, now forever discredited, of the
balance of power; but that&mdash;</p>

<p>3. Every territorial settlement involved in this war must be
made in the interest and for benefit of the populations concerned,
and not as a part of any mere adjustment or compromise of claims
amongst rival states; and&mdash;</p>

<p>4. That all well-defined national aspirations shall be accorded
the utmost satisfaction that can be accorded them without
introducing new or perpetuating old elements of discord and
antagonism that would be likely in time to break the peace of
Europe and consequently of the world.</p>

<p><i>From the President's Speech of July 4, 1918</i>
</p>

<p>1. The destruction of every arbitrary power anywhere that can
separately, secretly, and of its single choice disturb the peace of
the world; or, if it cannot be presently destroyed, at the least
its reduction to virtual impotence.</p>

<p>2. The settlement of every question, whether of territory, of
sovereignty, of economic arrangement, or of political relationship,
upon the basis of the free acceptance of that settlement by the
people immediately concerned, and not upon the basis of the
material interest or advantage of any other nation or people which
may desire a different settlement for the sake of its own exterior
influence or mastery.</p>

<p>3. The consent of all nations to be governed in their conduct
toward each other by the same principles of honor and of respect
for the common law of civilized society that govern the individual
citizens of all modern States in their relations with one another,
to the end that all promises and covenants may be sacredly
observed, no private plots or conspiracies hatched, no selfish
injuries wrought with impunity, and a mutual trust established upon
the handsome foundation of a mutual respect for right.</p>

<p>4. The establishment of an organization of peace which shall
make it certain that the combined power of free nations will check
every invasion of right, and serve to make peace and justice the
more secure by affording a definite tribunal of opinion to which
all must submit and by which every international readjustment that
cannot be amicably agreed upon by the peoples directly concerned
shall be sanctioned.</p>

<p>These great objects can be put into a single sentence: What we
seek is reign of law, based upon the consent of the governed and
sustained by the organized opinion of mankind.</p>

<p><i>From the President's Speech of September 27, 1918</i>
</p>

<p>1. The impartial justice meted out must involve no
discrimination between those to whom we wish to be just and those
to whom we do not wish to be just. It must be a justice that plays
no favorites and knows no standard but the equal rights of the
several peoples concerned.</p>

<p>2. No special or separate interest of any single nation or any
group of nations can be made the basis of any part of the
settlement which is not consistent with the common interest of
all.</p>

<p>3. There can be no leagues or alliances or special covenants and
understandings within the general and common family of the league
of nations.</p>

<p>4. And more specifically, there can be no special, selfish
economic combinations within the league and no employment of any
form of economic boycott or exdusion except as the power of
economic penalty by exclusion from the markets of the world may be
vested in the league of nations itself as a means of discipline and
control.</p>

<p>5. All international agreements and treaties of every kind must
be made known in their entirety to the rest of the world.</p>
