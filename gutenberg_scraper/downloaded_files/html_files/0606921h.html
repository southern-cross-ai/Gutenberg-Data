  <h2><a id="wind1"
     name="wind1">I. &mdash; "I TAKE THIS WOMAN!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EMMETT GLANTON jammed on the brakes of his old Model T and
  skidded to a squealing stop within a few feet of the apparition that had
  materialized out of the black, gusty night.</p>

  <p>"What the Hell do you mean by jumping in front of my car like that?" he
  yelled wrathfully, recognizing the figure that posed grotesquely in the glare
  of the headlights. It was Joshua, the lumbering halfwit who worked for old
  John Bruckman; but Joshua in a mood such as Glanton had never seen before. In
  the white glare of the lights the fellow's broad brutish face was convulsed;
  foam flecked his lips and his eyes were red as those of a rabid wolf. He
  brandished his arms and croaked incoherently. Impressed, Glanton opened the
  door and stepped out of the car. On his feet he was inches taller than
  Joshua, but his rangy, broad-shouldered frame did not look impressive
  compared to the stooped, apish bulk of the halfwit.</p>

  <p>There was menace in Joshua's mien. Gone was the dull, apathetic expression
  he usually wore. He bared his teeth and snarled like a wild beast as he
  rolled toward Glanton.</p>

  <p>"Keep away from me, blast you!" Glanton warned. "What's the matter with
  you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"You're goin' over there!" mouthed the halfwit, gesturing vaguely
  southward. "Old John called you over the phone. I heered him!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did," answered Glanton. "Asked me to come over as quick as I
  could. Didn't say why. What about it? You want to ride back with me?"</p>

  <p>Joshua jumped up and down and battered his hairy breast like an ape with
  his splay fists. He gnashed his teeth and howled. Glanton's flesh crawled a
  little. It was black night, with the wind howling under a black sky, whipping
  the mesquite. And there in that little spot of light that apish figure
  cavorted and raved like a witch's familiar summoned up from Hell.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to ride with you!" bellowed Joshua. "You ain't goin' there!
  I'll kill you if you try to go! I'll twist your head off with my hands!" He
  spread his great fingers and worked them like the hairy legs of great spiders
  before Glanton's face. Glanton bristled at the threat.</p>

  <p>"What are you raving about?" he demanded. "I don't know why Bruckman
  called me, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know!" howled Joshua, froth flying from his loose, working lips. "I
  listened outside the winder! You can't have her! I want her!"</p>

  <p>"Want who?" Glanton was bewildered. This was mystery piled on mystery.
  Black, howling night, and old John Bruckman's voice shrieking over the party
  line, edged with frenzy, begging and demanding that his neighbor come to him
  as quickly as his car could get him there; then the wild drive over the
  wind-lashed road, and now this lunatic prancing in the glare of the
  headlights and mouthing bloody threats.</p>

  <p>Joshua ignored his question. He seemed to have lost what little sense he
  had ever had. He was acting like a homicidal maniac. And through the rents in
  his ragged shirt bulged muscles capable of rending the average man limb from
  limb.</p>

  <p>"I never seen one I wanted before!" he screamed. "But I want her! Old John
  don't want her! I heered him say so! If you didn't come maybe he'd give her
  to me! You go on back home or I'll kill you! I'll twist your head off and
  feed it to the buzzards! You think I'm just a harmless big fool, I bet!"</p>

  <p>Grotesquely his bellowing voice rose to a high-pitched squeal.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it'll satisfy you," said Glanton, watching him warily, "I've
  always thought you were dangerous. Bruckman's a fool to keep you on the
  ranch. I've expected you to go clean crazy and kill him some time."</p>

  <p>"I ain't goin' to kill John," howled Joshua. "I'm goin' to kill you. You
  won't be the first, neither. I killed my brother Jake. He beat me once too
  often. I beat his head to jelly with a rock and dragged the body down the
  canyon and throwed it into the pool below the rapids!"</p>

  <p>A maniacal glee convulsed his face as he screamed his hideous secret to
  the night, and his eyes looked like nothing this side of Hell.</p>

  <p>"So that's what became of Jake! I always wondered why he disappeared and
  you came to live with old John. Couldn't stay in your shack in that lonely
  canyon after you killed him, eh?"</p>

  <p>A momentary gleam of fear shot the murk of the maniac's eyes.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't stay in the pool," muttered Joshua. "He used to come back and
  scratch at the winder, with his head all bloody. I'd wake up at night and see
  him lookin' in at me and gaspin' and gurglin' tryin' to talk through the
  blood in his throat.</p>

  <p>"But you won't come back and ha'nt me!" he shrieked suddenly, beginning to
  sway from side to side like a bull about to charge. "I'll spike you down with
  a stake and weight you down with rocks! I'll&mdash;" In the midst of his
  tirade he lunged suddenly at Glanton.</p>

  <p>Glanton knew that if those huge arms ever locked about him his spine would
  snap like a stick. But he knew, too, that nine times out of ten a maniac will
  try to reach his victim's throat with his teeth. Joshua was no exception.</p>

  <p>Reverting completely to the beast, he plunged in with his arms groping
  vaguely, and his jaws thrust out like a wolf's muzzle, slavering teeth bared
  in the glare of the headlights. Glanton stepped inside those waving arms and
  smashed his right fist against the out-jutting jaw with all his power. It
  would have stretched another man senseless. It stopped the halfwit in his
  tracks, and blood spurted.</p>

  <p>Before he could recover his balance Glanton struck again and again,
  raining terrific blows to face and head, driving Joshua reeling and
  staggering before him. It was like beating a bull, but the ceaseless smashes
  kept the maniac off balance, confused and dazed him, kept him on the
  defensive.</p>

  <p>Glanton was beginning to tire, and he wondered desperately what the end
  would be. The moment his blows began weakening Joshua would shake off his
  bewilderment and lunge to the attack again&mdash;</p>

  <p>Abruptly they were out of the range of the car lights, and floundering in
  darkness. In panic lest the maniac should find his throat in the blackness,
  Glanton swung blindly and desperately, connected glancingly and felt his man
  fall away from him.</p>

  <p>He stumbled himself and went on all fours, almost pitching down the slope
  that fell away beneath him. Crouching there he heard the sounds of Joshua's
  thundering fall down the slant. Glanton knew where he was now, knew that a
  few yards from the road the ground fell away in a steep slope a hundred feet
  long. It was not hard to navigate by daylight, but by night a man might take
  a nasty tumble and hurt himself badly on the broken rocks at the bottom. And
  Joshua, knocked over the edge by Glanton's last wild haymaker, was taking
  that tumble.</p>

  <p>It might have been an animal falling down the slope, from the grunts and
  howls that welled up from below, but presently, when the rattle of pebbles
  and the sounds of a heavy rolling body had ceased, there was silence, and
  Glanton wondered if the lunatic lay senseless or dead at the bottom of the
  slope.</p>

  <p>He called, but there was no answer. Then a sudden shudder shook him.
  Joshua might be creeping back up the slope in utter silence, this time maybe
  with a rock in his hand, such a rock as he had used to batter his brother
  Jake's head into a crimson pulp&mdash;</p>

  <p>Glanton's eyes were getting accustomed to the darkness and he could make
  out the vague forms of black ridges, boulders and trees. The devil-begotten
  wind that shrieked through the trees would drown a stealthy footstep. When a
  man turns his back on peril it assumes an aspect of thousand-fold horror.</p>

  <p>When Glanton started back to the car his flesh crawled cold, and at each
  step he expected to feel a frightful form land on his back, gnashing and
  tearing. It was with a gasp of relief that he lunged into the car, eased off
  the hand-brake, and clattered off down the dim road.</p>

  <p>He was leaving Joshua behind him, alive or dead, and such was the grim
  magic of the gusty dark that at the moment he feared Joshua dead no less than
  Joshua living.</p>

  <p>He heaved another sigh of relief when the red spot that was the light of
  John Bruckman's house began to glow in the black curtain ahead of him. He
  disliked Bruckman, but the old skinflint was sane at least, and any sane
  company was welcome after his experience with a brutish maniac in the black
  heart of this evil night.</p>

  <p>A car stood before Bruckman's gate and Glanton recognized it as the one
  belonging to Lem Richards, justice of the peace in Skurlock, the little
  village which lay a few miles south of the Bruckman ranch.</p>

  <p>Glanton knocked on the door and Bruckman's voice, with a strange,
  unnatural quaver in it, shouted:</p>

  <p>"Who's there? Speak quick, or I'll shoot through the door!"</p>

  <p>"It's me, Glanton!" called the ranchman in a hurry. "You asked me to come,
  didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Chains rattled, a key grated in the lock, and the door swung inward. The
  black night seemed to flow in after Glanton with the wind that made the lamp
  flicker and the shadows dance along the walls, and Bruckman moaned and
  slammed the door in its ebon face. He jammed bolt and chain with trembling
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Your confounded hired hand tried to kill me on the way over," Glanton
  began angrily. "I've told you that lunatic would go bad some day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short. Two other people were in the room. One was Lem Richards,
  the justice of the peace, a short, stolid, unimaginative man who sat before
  the hearth placidly chewing his quid.</p>

  <p>The other was a girl, and at the sight of her a sort of shock passed over
  Emmett Glanton, bringing a sudden realization of his work-hardened hands and
  hickory shirt and rusty boots. She was like a breath of perfume from the
  world of tinsel and bright lights and evening gowns that he had almost
  forgotten in his toil to build up his fortune in this primitive country.</p>

  <p>Her supple young figure was set off to its best advantage by the neat but
  costly dress she wore. Her loveliness dazzled Glanton at first glance; then
  he looked again and was appalled. For she was white and cold as a statue of
  marble, and her dilated eyes stared at him as though she had just seen a
  serpent writhe through the door.</p>

  <p>"Oh, excuse me!" he said awkwardly, dragging off, his battered Stetson. "I
  wouldn't have come busting in here like this if I'd known there was a
  lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that!" snapped John Bruckman. He faced Glanton across the
  table, his face limned in the lamp-light. It was a haggard face, and in the
  burning eyes Glanton saw fear, murky bestial fear that made the man
  repulsive. Bruckman spoke hurriedly, the words tumbling over each other, and
  from time to time he glanced at the big clock on the mantel sullenly ticking
  off the seconds.</p>

  <p>"Glanton, I hold a mortgage on your ranch, and it's due in a few days. Do
  you think you can meet your payment?"</p>

  <p>Glanton felt like cursing the man. Had he called him over that windswept
  road on a night like this to discuss a mortgage? A glance at the white, tense
  girl told him something else was behind all this.</p>

  <p>"I reckon I can," he said shortly. "I'm getting by&mdash;or would if you'd
  stay off my back long enough for me to get a start."</p>

  <p>"I'll do that!" Bruckman's hands were shaking as he fumbled in his coat.
  "Look here! Here's the mortgage!" He tossed a document on the table. "And a
  thousand dollars in cash!" A compact bundle of bank notes plopped down on the
  table before Glanton's astounded eyes. "It's all yours&mdash;mortgage and
  money&mdash;if you'll do one thing for me!"</p>

  <p>"And what's that?"</p>

  <p>Bruckman's bony forefinger stabbed at the cringing girl.</p>

  <p>"Marry her!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Glanton wheeled and stared at her with a new intensity, and she
  stared wildly back, in evident fright, and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Marry her?" He ran a hand dazedly across his head, vividly aware of the
  loneliness of the life he had been leading for the past three years.</p>

  <p>"What does the young lady think about it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Bruckman snarled impatiently.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter what she thinks? She's my niece, my ward. She'll do
  as I say. She could do worse than marry you. You're no common ridge-runner.
  You're a gentleman by birth and breeding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," growled Glanton, waving him aside. He stepped toward
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"Are you willing to marry me?" he asked directly.</p>

  <p>She looked full into his eyes for a long moment, with a desperate and
  pitiful intensity in her gaze. She must have read kindness and honesty there,
  for suddenly, impulsively, she sprang forward and caught his brown hand in
  both of hers, crying:</p>

  <p>"Yes! Yes! <i>Please</i> marry me! Marry me and take me away from
  <i>him</i>&mdash;" Her gesture toward John Bruckman was one of fear and
  loathing, but the old man did not heed. He was staring fearfully at the clock
  again.</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands in a spasm of nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Quick! Lem brought the license, according to my instructions.
  He'll marry you now&mdash;now! Stand over here by the table and join
  hands."</p>

  <p>Richards rose heavily and lumbered over to the table, fingering his worn
  book. All this drama and mystery meant nothing to him, except that another
  couple were to be married.</p>

  <p>And so Emmett Glanton found himself standing holding the quivering hand of
  a girl he had never seen before, while the justice of the peace mumbled the
  ritual which made them husband and wife. And only then did he learn the
  girl's name&mdash;Joan Zukor.</p>

  <p>"Do you, Emmett, take this woman..." droned the monotonous voice.</p>

  <p>Glanton gave his reply mechanically, his fingers involuntarily clenching
  on the slim fingers they grasped. For, pressed briefly against a window, he
  had seen a face&mdash;a white, blood-streaked mask of murder&mdash;the face
  of the halfwit Joshua.</p>

  <p>The maniac's eyes burned on Glanton with a mad hate, and on the woman at
  his side with a sickening flame of desire. Then the face was gone and the
  window framed only the blackness of the night.</p>

  <p>None but Glanton had seen the lunatic. Richards, paid by old John,
  lumbered stolidly forth and the door shut behind him. Glanton and the girl
  stood looking at each other speechlessly, in sudden self-consciousness, but
  old John gave them no pause. He glared at the clock again, which showed ten
  minutes after eleven, jammed the mortgage and the bank notes into Glanton's
  hand and pushed him and the girl toward the door. Sweat dripped from his
  livid face, but a sort of wild triumph mingled with his strange fear.</p>

  <p>"Get out! Get off my place! Take your wife and go! I wash my hands of her!
  I am no longer responsible for her! She's your burden! Go&mdash;and go
  quick!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="wind2"
     name="wind2">II. &mdash; "TELL THEM&mdash;IN PITY'S NAME"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN a sort of daze Glanton found himself out on the porch
  with the girl, and from inside came the sound of drawn bolts and hooked
  chains. Angrily he took a step toward the door, then noticed the girl
  shivering beside him, huddling about her a cloak she had snatched as they
  were evicted.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Joan," he said awkwardly, taking her arm. "I think your uncle
  must be crazy. We'd better go."</p>

  <p>He felt her shudder.</p>

  <p>"Yes, let us go quickly."</p>

  <p>Richards, characteristically, had left the yard gate unfastened. It was
  flapping and banging in the wind which moaned through the junipers. Glanton
  groped his way toward the sound, sheltering the cowering girl against the
  gusts that whipped her cloak about her.</p>

  <p>He shivered at the thick-set, cone-shaped outlines of the junipers along
  the walk. Either of them might be hiding the maniac who had glared through
  the window. The creature was no longer human; he was a beast of prey, ranging
  the night.</p>

  <p>John Bruckman had given Glanton no chance to warn him of the madman. But
  Glanton decided he would phone back from his ranch house. They could not
  loiter there in the darkness, with that skulking fiend abroad.</p>

  <p>He half expected to find Joshua crouching in the car, but it was empty,
  and a feeling of relief flooded him as he turned on the lights and their twin
  beams lanced the dark. The girl beside him sighed too, though she knew
  nothing of the death that lurked near them. But she sensed the evil of the
  night, the menace of the crowding blackness. Even such a dim illumination as
  this was comforting.</p>

  <p>Wordless, Glanton started the car and they began the bumping, jolting
  ride. He was consumed with curiosity, but hesitated to put the question that
  itched on his tongue. Presently the girl herself spoke.</p>

  <p>"You wonder why my uncle sold me like a slave&mdash;or an animal!"</p>

  <p>"Don't say that!" exclaimed Glanton in quick sympathy. "You need
  not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why <i>shouldn't</i> you wonder?" she retorted bitterly. "I can only say&mdash;I don't know. He's my only relative, as far as I know. I've seen him
  only a few times in my life. Ever since I was a small child I've lived in
  boarding schools and I always understood he was supplying the money that
  lodged, dressed and educated me. But he seldom wrote; hardly ever visited
  me.</p>

  <p>"I was in a school in Houston when I received a wire from my uncle
  ordering me to come to him at once. I came on the train to Skurlock, and
  arrived about nine tonight. Mr. Richards met me at the station. He told me
  that my uncle had phoned and asked him to drive me out to his ranch. He had
  the license with him, though I didn't know it at the time.</p>

  <p>"When we got here my uncle told me abruptly that I'd have to marry a young
  man he had sent for. Naturally, I&mdash;I was terrified&mdash;" She faltered
  and then laid a timid hand on his arm. "I was afraid&mdash;I didn't know what
  kind of a man it might be."</p>

  <p>"I'll be a good husband to you, girl," he said awkwardly, and thrilled
  with pleasure at the sincerity in her tone as she replied:</p>

  <p>"I know it. You have kind eyes and gentle hands. Strong, but gentle."</p>

  <p>They were approaching a place where the road had been straightened by a
  new track, which, instead of swinging wide around the sloping edge of a
  steep, thicket-grown knoll, crossed a shallow ravine by a crude bridge and
  ran close by the knob on the opposite side, where it sheered off in a
  forty-foot cliff.</p>

  <p>As the knoll grew dimly out of the windy darkness ahead of them, a grisly
  premonition rose in Glanton's breast. Joshua, loping through the mesquite
  like a lobo wolf, could have reached that knob ahead of them. It was the most
  logical place along the road for an ambush. A man crouching on the
  thicket-clad crest of the cliff could hurl a boulder down on a car passing
  along the new stretch of road&mdash;</p>

  <p>With sudden decision, Glanton wrenched the car into the old track, now a
  faint trace grown up in broom weeds and prickly pears.</p>

  <p>Joan caught at him for support as she was thrown from side to side by the
  jouncing of the auto. Then as they swung around the slope and came back into
  the plain road again, behind and above them yammered a fiendish howling&mdash;the maddened, primordial shrieking of a baffled beast of prey which
  realizes that his victims have eluded him.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" gasped Joan, clutching at Glanton.</p>

  <p>"Just a bobcat squalling in the brush on that knob," he assured her, but
  it was with convulsive haste that he jammed his foot down on the accelerator
  and sent the car thundering down the road. Tomorrow, he swore, he'd raise a
  posse and hunt down that slavering human beast as he would a rabid
  coyote.</p>

  <p>He could imagine the madman loping along the road after them, foam from
  his bared fangs dripping onto his bare, hairy breast. He was glad the lamp
  was burning in the parlor of his ranch house. It reached a warm shaft of
  light to them across the windy reaches of the night.</p>

  <p>He did not drive the car into the shed that served as garage. He drove it
  as close to the porch as he could get it, and opened the car door in the
  light that streamed from the house, as old Juan Sanchez, his Mexican
  man-of-all-work, opened the front door.</p>

  <p>Glanton was briefly aware of the bareness of his residence. There had been
  no time to adorn it in his toil to build his spread. But now he must have a
  front yard with a fence around it and some rose bushes and spineless
  decorative cacti. Women liked things like that.</p>

  <p>"This is my wife, Sanchez," he said briefly. "Señora Joan."</p>

  <p>The old Mexican hid his astonishment with a low bow, and said, with the
  natural courtliness of his race:</p>

  <p><i>"Buenas noches, señora!</i> Welcome to the <i>hacienda</i>."</p>

  <p>In the parlor Glanton said: "Sit down by the fire and warm yourself, Joan.
  It's been a cold drive. Sanchez, stir up the fire and throw on some more
  mesquite chunks. I'm going to call up John Bruckman. There's something he
  ought to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But even as he reached for the phone the bell jangled discordantly. As he
  lifted the receiver over the line came John Bruckman's voice, brittle with
  fear and more than fear&mdash;with physical agony.</p>

  <p>"Emmett! Emmett Glanton! Tell them&mdash;in pity's name tell them that
  you've married Joan Zukor! Tell them I'm no longer responsible for her!"</p>

  <p>"Tell who?" demanded Glanton, all but speechless with amazement.</p>

  <p>Joan was on her feet, white-faced; that frantic voice shrieking from the
  receiver had reached her ears.</p>

  <p>"These devils!" squalled the voice of John Bruckman. "The Black Brothers
  of&mdash;aaagh&mdash;Mercy!"</p>

  <p>The voice broke in a loud shriek, and in the brief silence that followed
  there sounded a low, gurgling, indescribably repellent laugh. And Glanton's
  hair stood up, for he knew it was not John Bruckman who laughed.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he yelled. "John! John Bruckman!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. A click told him that the receiver had been hung up
  at the other end, and a grisly conviction shook him that it had not been John
  Bruckman's hand who had hung it up.</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl, who stood silent and wide-eyed in the middle of the
  room, as he snatched a gun from its scabbard hanging on the wall.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go back to Bruckman's ranch," he said. "Something devilish is
  happening over there, and the old man seems to need help bad."</p>

  <p>She was speechless. Impulsively he took her hands in his and stroked them
  reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, kid," he said. "Sanchez will take care of you till I get
  back. And I won't be gone long."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="wind3"
     name="wind3">III. &mdash; DEAD MADNESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS he drew the old Mexican out onto the porch a glance back
  showed her still standing dumbly in the center of the room, her hands pressed
  childishly to her breasts, an image of youthful fright and bewilderment lost
  in an unfamiliar world of violence and horror.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the Hell's happened over at Bruckman's," he said
  swiftly and low-voiced to Sanchez. "But be careful. Joshua, the halfwit's
  gone on the rampage. He tried to kill me tonight, and he laid for us at the
  knob where the new road passes. Probably meant to brain me with a rock and
  kidnap Joan. Shoot him like a coyote if he shows his head on this ranch while
  I'm gone."</p>

  <p>"Trust me, <i>señor!"</i> Old Sanchez's face was grim as he fondled the
  worn butt of his old single-action Colt. Men had died before that black
  muzzle in the wild old days when Sanchez had ridden with Pancho Villa.
  Sanchez could be depended on. Glanton clapped him on the back, leaped into
  the Ford and roared away southward.</p>

  <p>The road before him was a white crack in a black wall, opening steadily in
  the glare of the headlights. He drove recklessly, half expecting each moment
  to see the shambling figure of the maniac spring out of the blackness. Grimly
  he touched the butt of the pistol thrust into the waistband of his
  trousers.</p>

  <p>Aversion to driving under that gloomy cliff was so strong in Glanton that
  again he swung aside and followed the dimmer, longer road that wound around
  the opposite side of the knob.</p>

  <p>And as he did so he was aware of another roar, above that of his own
  racing motor. He caught the reflection of powerful headlights. Some other car
  was eating up the road, racing northward and taking the shorter cut. As he
  drove into the open road beyond the knob he looked back and glimpsed a
  rapidly receding tail-light. A nameless foreboding seized him, urging him to
  wheel around and race back to his own ranch.</p>

  <p>But there was not necessarily anything sinister in a car speeding
  northward even at that hour. It was probably some ranchman who lived north of
  Glanton returning home from Skurlock, or some traveling salesman bound for
  one of the little cowtowns still further north, and leaving the paved
  highways to take a short cut.</p>

  <p>There was no light in the window of the Bruckman ranch house as Glanton
  approached it; only the glow of the fire in the fireplace staining the
  windows with lurid blood, crimsoning it without illuminating. There was no
  sound but the moaning of the ghostly wind through the dark junipers as
  Glanton went up the walk. But the front door stood open.</p>

  <p>Pistol in hand, Glanton peered in. He caught the glimmer of red coals
  glowing on the hearth. The dry, toneless ticking of the clock made him start
  nervously.</p>

  <p>He called: "John! John Bruckman!"</p>

  <p>No answer, but somewhere a moan rose in the fire-shadowed darkness, a low,
  whimpering of anguish, thick and gurgling as if through a gag of welling
  blood. And a steady drip, drip of something wet and sticky on the floor.</p>

  <p>Panic clawed at Glanton's spine as he moved toward the smoldering hearth,
  instinct drawing him toward the one spot of light in the room. At the moment
  he did not remember just where stood the table with the oil lamp on it. He
  must have a moment to gather his wits, to locate it.</p>

  <p>He groped for a match, then froze in his tracks. A black hand had
  materialized out of the shadows, faintly revealed in the light of the glowing
  embers. It cast something on the coals while Glanton stood transfixed.</p>

  <p>Little tongues of red grew to life; the fire rose and the shadows
  retreated before the widening pool of wavering light. A face grew out of the
  darkness before Emmett Glanton&mdash;a grinning face that was like a carven
  mask somehow imbued with evil life. White pointed teeth reflected the
  firelight, eyes red as the eyes of an owl burned at him.</p>

  <p>With a choking cry Glanton lifted his gun and fired full at the face. At
  that range he could not miss. The face vanished with a shattering crash and
  Glanton was showered with tiny particles that stung his hand.</p>

  <p>But a low laugh rang through the room&mdash;the laugh he had heard over
  the phone! Whence it came he could not be sure, but in the flash of intuition
  that came to him, as it often comes to men in desperate straits, he realized
  the trick that had been played upon him, and wheeled with a gasp of pure
  terror. Pointblank he fired, with the muzzle jammed against the bulk that was
  almost on him&mdash;the bulk of the fiend that had crept up <i>behind him
  while he was staring at its reflection in front of him.</i></p>

  <p>There was an agonized grunt and something that swished venomously ripped
  away the front of his shirt. And then the monster was down and floundering in
  its death throes in the shadows at his feet, and in a panic Glanton fired
  down at it again and again, until its thrashing ceased and in the deafening
  silence that followed the booming of the shots he heard only the dry
  tick-tock of the clock, the drip-drip on the floor and the moaning that rose
  eerily in the gruesome dark.</p>

  <p>His hands were clammy with sweat when he found the oil lamp and lighted
  it. As the flame sprang up, sending the shadows slinking back to the corners,
  he glared fearfully at the thing sprawled before the hearth. At least it was
  a <i>man</i>&mdash;a tall, powerful man, naked to the waist, his shoulders
  and arching chest gigantic, his arms thick with knotting muscles.</p>

  <p>Blood oozed from three wounds in that massive torso. He was black, but he
  was not a Negro. He seemed to be stained with some sort of paint from his
  shaven crown to his fingertips. And the fingers of one hand were frightfully
  armed, with steel hooks that were hollow nearly to the points and slipped
  over the fingers, curving and razor sharp, making terrible, tiger-like
  talons.</p>

  <p>The thick lips, drawn back, revealed teeth filed to points, and then
  Glanton saw that he was not painted all over, after all. In the center of the
  breast a circle of white skin showed, and inside that circle there was a
  strange black symbol; it looked like a blind, black face.</p>

  <p>An arrangement of mirrors fastened at right angles to the mantel and to
  the wall, one shattered by his bullet, revealed the trick by which he meant
  to take Glanton off guard. He must have made his arrangements, simple and
  easy enough, when he heard the car driving up. But it was diabolical,
  betraying a twisted mind.</p>

  <p>From where he had been standing, Glanton could not see his own reflection
  in the mirror on the mantel, but only the reflection of the black man behind
  and to one side of him, like a spectral face floating in the shadows.</p>

  <p>What takes long in the telling flashed lightning-like through Glanton's
  mind as he looked down at the black man; and then he saw something else. He
  saw old John Bruckman.</p>

  <p>The old man lay naked on a table, on his back, arms and legs spread wide,
  so that his body formed a St. Andrew's Cross. Through each hand, nailing it
  to the wood, and through each ankle, a black spike had been driven.</p>

  <p>His tongue had been pulled out of his mouth and a steel skewer was driven
  through it. A ghastly raw, red patch showed on his breast, where a portion of
  skin as big as a man's palm had been savagely sliced away. And that piece of
  skin lay on the table beside him and Glanton gasped at the sight of it. For
  it bore the same unholy symbol that showed on the breast of the dead man by
  the hearth. Blood trickled along the table, dripped on the floor.</p>

  <p>Nauseated, Glanton drew forth the skewer from John Bruckman's tongue.
  Bruckman gagged, spat forth a great mouthful of blood and made incoherent
  sounds.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy, John," said Glanton. "I'll get some pliers and pull these
  spikes out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let them be!" gurgled Bruckman, scarcely intelligible with his butchered
  tongue. "They're barbed&mdash;you'll tear my hands off. I'm dying&mdash; they
  hurt me in ways that don't show so plainly. Let me die in as little pain as
  possible. Sorry&mdash;would have warned you <i>he</i> was waiting for you in
  the dark&mdash;but this accursed skewer&mdash;couldn't even scream. He heard
  your car and made ready&mdash;mirrors&mdash;always carry their paraphernalia
  with them&mdash;paraphernalia of illusion&mdash; deception and murder!
  Whiskey, quick! On that shelf!"</p>

  <p>Though he winced at the sting of the fiery liquid on his mangled tongue,
  Bruckman's voice grew stronger; and a blaze rose in his bloodshot eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you everything," he panted. "I'll live that long&mdash;then you set the law on them&mdash;blast them off the earth! I've kept
  the oath until now, even with the threat of death hanging over me, but I
  thought I could fool them. Curse their black souls, I'll keep their secret no
  longer! Don't talk or ask questions&mdash;listen!"</p>

  <p>Strange the tales that dying lips have gasped, but never a stranger tale
  than that Emmett Glanton heard in the blood-stained room, where a dead black
  face grinned by a smoldering hearth, and a dying man, spiked to a table,
  mouthed grisly secrets with a mangled tongue in the smoky light of the
  guttering lamp, while the black wind moaned and crawled at the rattling
  windows.</p>

  <p>"When I was young, in another land," panted John Bruckman, "I was a fool.
  And I was trapped by my own folly into joining a cult of devil worshippers&mdash;the Black Brothers of Ahriman. Until too late I did not realize what
  they were&mdash;nor to what horrors my own terrible oath had bound me. I need
  not speak of their aims and purposes&mdash;they were foul beyond conception.
  Yet they had one characteristic that is so often lacking in many such
  cults&mdash;they were sincere&mdash;fanatic. They worshipped the fiend
  Ahriman as zealously as did their heathen ancestors. And they practiced human
  sacrifice. Once each year, on this very night, between midnight and dawn, a
  young girl was offered up on the burning altar of Ahriman, Lord of Fire. On
  that glowing altar her body was consumed to ashes and the ashes scattered to
  the night wind by the black-painted priests.</p>

  <p>"I became one of the Black Brothers. On my breast was tattooed indelibly
  the symbol of Ahriman, which is the symbol of Night&mdash;a blind, black
  face. But at last I sickened of the revolting practices of the cult, and fled
  from it. I came to America and changed my name. Some of my people were
  already here&mdash;the branch of the family to which Joan belongs.</p>

  <p>"With the passing of nineteen years I thought the Black Brothers had
  forgotten me. I didn't know there were branches in America, in the teeming
  foreign quarters of the great cities. But I might have known they never
  forget. And one day I received a cryptic message that shattered my illusions.
  They had remembered, had traced me, found me&mdash;knew all about me. And, in
  punishment for my desertion, they had chosen my niece, Joan, for the yearly
  sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"That was bad enough, but what nearly drove me mad with terror was
  knowledge of the custom that attends the sacrifice&mdash;since time
  immemorial it's been the habit of the Black Brothers to kill the man nearest
  the girl chosen for sacrifice&mdash;father, brother, husband&mdash;her
  'master' according to their ritual. This is partly because of a dim phallic
  superstition, partly a practical way of eliminating an enemy, for the girl's
  protector would certainly seek vengeance.</p>

  <p>"I knew I couldn't save Joan. She was marked for doom, but I might save
  myself by shifting responsibility for her to somebody else's shoulders. So I
  brought her here and married her to you."</p>

  <p>"You swine!" whispered Glanton.</p>

  <p>"It did me little good!" gasped Bruckman, his tortured head tossing from
  side to side. His eyes were glazing and a bloody froth rose to his livid
  lips. "They came shortly after you drove away. I was fool enough to let them
  in&mdash;told them I was no longer responsible for the chosen maiden. They
  laughed at me&mdash;tortured me. I broke away&mdash;got to the phone&mdash;but they had ordered my death, as a renegade brother. They drove away,
  leaving one of them here to attend to me. You can see he did his work
  well!"</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;where did they go?" Glanton spoke with dry lips, remembering
  the big automobile roaring northward.</p>

  <p>"To your ranch&mdash;to get Joan&mdash;I told them where she was&mdash;before they started torturing me!"</p>

  <p>"You fool! You're telling me this <i>now,"</i> Glanton yelled.</p>

  <p>But John Bruckman did not hear, for, with a convulsion that spattered foam
  from his empurpled lips and tore one of the bloody spikes out of the wood,
  the life went out of him in one great cry.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="wind4"
     name="wind4">IV. &mdash; CRACKLING BLUE FLAME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LIKE a drunken man, Emmitt Glanton left from that lamp-lit
  room where a black face on the floor grinned blindly at a blind white face
  lolling on the table. The black wind ripped at him with mad, invisible
  fingers as he ran in great leaps to his car.</p>

  <p>The drive through the screaming darkness was nightmare, with the black
  wall splitting before him, and closing behind him, horror hounding him like a
  werewolf on his trail, and the wind howling awful secrets in his ears.</p>

  <p>He did not turn aside for the somber knoll this time, but plunged straight
  on, thundered over the bridge and rushed past the black cliff. No boulder
  fell from above. Joshua must have left his ambush long ago.</p>

  <p>Three more miles and his heart leaped into his throat and stuck there, a
  choking chunk of ice. He should be able to see the light in the ranch house
  window by now&mdash;but only the glare of his own headlights knifed the black
  curtain before him.</p>

  <p>Then the ranch house bulked out of the night and on the porch he saw a
  strange pale spot of radiance glowing. There was no sign of the automobile
  that had come northward. But he checked his own car suddenly to avoid running
  over a shape that sprawled in the fenceless yard. It was the mad Joshua,
  lying face down, one side of his head a mass of blood. He had come only to
  meet death.</p>

  <p>Glanton slid out of the car and ran toward the house, shouting Sanchez'
  name. His cries died away in the stormy clamor of the wind and an icy hand
  gripped his heart.</p>

  <p>His dilated eyes were fixed on the pale spot that grew in size and shape
  as he approached&mdash;a man's face stared at him&mdash;the face of Sanchez,
  weirdly illuminated. Glanton stole closer, holding his breath. Why should the
  face of Sanchez glow so in the darkness? Why should he stand so still,
  unanswering, eyes fixed and glassy? Why should his face be looking down from
  such a height?</p>

  <p>Then Glanton knew. He was looking at Sanchez' severed head, fastened by
  its long hair to a pillar of the porch. Some sort of phosphorus had been
  rubbed on the dead face to make that eerie glow.</p>

  <p>"Joan!"</p>

  <p>It was a cry of agony as Glanton flung himself into the darkened house.
  Only the wind outside answered him, mocked him. His foot struck something
  heavy and yielding just inside the door. Sick with horror he found a match
  and struck it. Near the door lay a headless body, riddled with bullets. It
  was the body of Sanchez. And but for the corpse the house was empty. The
  match burned down to Glanton's fingers and he stumbled out of the house.</p>

  <p>Out in the yard he fought down hysteria and forced himself to look at the
  matter rationally. Joshua must have been shot by Sanchez, while trying to
  sneak up on the house. Then it would have been easy for strangers to catch
  the old Mexican off-guard. He had not expected an attack from anyone except
  the halfwit, nor would he have been expecting enemies to come in a motor car.
  He would have come to the door at a hail from a stopping auto, unsuspectingly
  showing himself in the lighted doorway. A sudden hail of bullets would have
  done the rest. And then&mdash;beads of perspiration broke out on his body.
  Joan, alone and undefended, with those fiends!</p>

  <p>He whirled, gun in hand, as he thought he heard a noise like something
  moving in the bushes north of the house. It diminished, ceased as he went in
  that direction. It might have been a steer, or some smaller beast. It might&mdash;suddenly he turned and strode toward the car.</p>

  <p>The body that had lain there before was gone. Had dead Joshua risen and
  stalked away in the shadows, and was it he that Glanton had heard stealing
  northward through the bushes? Glanton did not greatly care. At that moment he
  was ready to believe any grisliness was possible, and he had no interest in
  Joshua, dead or alive.</p>

  <p>He walked around the house, wiping the sweat from his face with clammy
  hands. The house stood on a rise. From it he could see the lights of any car
  fleeing northward, for several miles. He strained his eyes, but saw no
  distant shaft splitting the dark. The raiders must have already put many
  miles between them and the scene of their crimes. He must follow&mdash;but
  where? Northward, yes&mdash;but a few miles north of his ranch the road split
  into three forks, each leading eventually into a highway, one of which ran to
  New Mexico, one to Oklahoma, and one north into the Panhandle.</p>

  <p>He twisted his fingers together in an agony of indecision. Then he
  stiffened.</p>

  <p>He had seen a light&mdash;yet not a distinct shaft like a car light. This
  was more like a blur in the dark&mdash;like the glow of embers not yet
  extinguished. It seemed to emanate from a spot somewhat east of the road
  which ran north, and this side of the forks. Night made sight and judgment
  deceptive, but tracing out that eerie glow was better than sitting in racking
  inaction.</p>

  <p>Fixing the spot in his mind as well as he could, he ran to his car and
  drove northward. As soon as he had descended the rise on which his house
  stood he could no longer see the glare, but he drove on until he reached a
  spot which he believed was the point where the road most closely approached
  the spot where he had seen the glow. A long wooded ridge stood east of the
  road at that spot.</p>

  <p>He left the car and toiled up the western slope of the ridge, scratching
  his hands and tearing his clothing on rocks and bushes. And nearly to the
  crest he heard something that stopped him in his tracks. The wind had
  dwindled to a fitful moaning, and somewhere ahead of him there rose a weird
  sound that set his flesh crawling.</p>

  <p>Chanting! Beyond that black ridge men were chanting in an evil monotone
  that brought up shuddersome racial memories, old as time and dim as
  nightmares, of grim black temples where clouds of foul incense smoke rolled
  about the feet of bowing worshippers before a blood-stained altar. In a
  frenzy Glanton charged to the crest, tearing through the thickets by sheer
  force.</p>

  <p>Crouching there he looked down on a scene that wrenched his horrified mind
  back a thousand years into the black night of the medieval when madness
  stalked the earth in the guise of men.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the ridge, in a wide, natural basin glowed a ring of fire.
  He saw its apparent source&mdash;boulders had been rolled to form a solid
  circle and these boulders glowed with a blue-white light that was like an icy
  heat beyond human comprehension. From them rose a glow that hung like an
  unholy halo above the shallow basin. It was this light he had seen from his
  ranch. It might have been a glow from the slag-heaps of Hell. And devils were
  not lacking. He saw them, three of them inside the circle&mdash;tall,
  muscular men, naked, black as the night that surrounded them, their heads
  hidden by grinning golden masks made like the faces of beasts.</p>

  <p>They stood about a heap of stones which glowed with a dull blue radiance,
  and on that crude improvised altar lay a slender, white, unmoving figure.</p>

  <p>Glanton almost screamed aloud at the sight. Joan lay there, stark naked,
  spread-eagled in the form of St. Andrew's Cross, her wrists and ankles
  strapped securely. In that instant Glanton knew what it would mean to him to
  lose that girl&mdash;realized how much she had come to mean to him in the few
  hours he had known her. His wife! Even at this moment the phrase brought a
  strange, warm thrill. And now those devils down there were preparing, by some
  hellish art, to reduce that lovely body into ashes&mdash;</p>

  <p>Madly he hurled himself down the slope, pistol in hand. As he went he
  heard the chanting cease, and was aware of a strange, yet curiously familiar
  humming in the air.</p>

  <p>Whence it came he could not tell, but it sounded like the pulsing of a
  giant dynamo. Joan cried out. An edge of pain vibrated through her voice.</p>

  <p>The halo over the circle mounted, grew more intensely blue. The rocks
  glowed with a fiercer light; pale tongues of flame licked up from them. The
  hue of the altar under the girl was changing. The blue was growing more
  pronounced, less dull. That the change in its color was accompanied by
  painful sensations was evident from Joan's cries and the writhings of her
  bound body.</p>

  <p>Glanton yelled incoherently as his feet hit level ground, and the black
  men turned quickly toward him. His lips drew back in a wolfish snarl and the
  old single-action gun went up in a menacing arc as he thumbed back the fanged
  hammer. He meant to shoot these devils down in their tracks, like so many mad
  dogs&mdash;then his out-thrust left hand touched one of the glowing boulders.
  Merely touched it, but the contact was like the jolt of a fork of lightning.
  Glanton was knocked off his feet and rolled, blind and dizzy with brief but
  stunning agony. As he staggered up, snarling and still gripping his gun, he
  recognized the truth.</p>

  <p>Somehow those boulders had been made conductors of electricity. They were
  charged with a voltage terrific beyond his understanding. And so was the
  altar, though as yet the full force had not been turned on.</p>

  <p>The rising hum that now filled the air told its own grisly tale. Joan was
  to die by electricity, not swiftly shocked to death as in an electric chair,
  but slowly agonizedly, burned to a crisp&mdash;to white ashes to be scattered
  to the night wind.</p>

  <p>With an inhuman yell he threw up his gun and fired. One of the masked men
  spun on his heels and fell sprawling, but the taller of the remaining two
  bent quickly and laid a hand on some sort of contraption at his feet.</p>

  <p>Instantly the hum grew to a shriek. White fire danced around the ring,
  blinding and dazzling the man outside. He saw the tall black forms within it
  vaguely, through a dizzying blue-white curtain of flame.</p>

  <p>Shielding his eyes from the glare, panic tugging at his soul, he fired
  again and again until the hammer fell with an empty snap. He could not hit
  them. The noise, the glare, bewildered him; everything was thrown out of its
  proper proportions; vision and perspective were distorted.</p>

  <p>He hurled the gun at them and reeled toward the blazing barricade with his
  bare hands, knowing that to touch it would be death, yet choosing death
  rather than standing by and watching the girl die. But before he reached it a
  black shape hurtled past him, out of the darkness. Joshua! Blood clotted his
  scalp, but his primitive fury, his mad desire for the white body on that
  glowing altar were undimmed.</p>

  <p>Like a charging bull he came out of the dark, headlong at the barrier.
  Running hard and low he bent, gathered his thews and leaped! Only a beast or
  a madman could have made that leap. He cleared the barrier with a foot to
  spare; one instant he was etched in mid-air, black against the glare, arms
  wide and fingers spread like talons, then he hit catlike on his feet within
  the ring of death.</p>

  <p>And as he struck he lunged. The priests were naked and weaponless. The
  taller let go the lever he held, sprang aside, stooped and snatched up some
  object, even as Joshua struck his companion. It might have been a bull that
  smote and tossed the black priest.</p>

  <p>Plain above the lessening hum and crackle of blue flame sounded the snap
  of splintering bones, the shriek of the priest. He was whirled from his feet,
  a broken, dangling doll, lifted high in apelike arms above the bullet-head
  and dashed head first to the earth with such fury that the broken corpse
  rebounded before it lay still. Head down, the killer plunged at the taller
  priest's throat.</p>

  <p>It had been a pistol this man had snatched up, and a raking blast of lead
  met the charging madman&mdash;met him, but did not stop him.</p>

  <p>With bullets smacking into his body at close range, Joshua bellowed with
  pain and swayed on his feet, but came on in an irresistible surge of fury and
  threw his arms about the black body of his foe. He must have been dying even
  then, but the blind force of his rush was enough to carry the priest off his
  feet. Together they hurtled on&mdash;to crash full against the blazing ring
  of boulders!</p>

  <p>A crack like a clap of thunder, a blinding spray of blue fire, one awful
  scream&mdash;then the reek of burnt flesh filled the air. In the swiftly
  dying glare, Emmett Glanton saw two hideous figures&mdash;<i>both</i> black
  now&mdash;crumpled in a fused, indistinguishable mass against the dulling
  rocks.</p>

  <p>Something had happened to the generator of that terrible power. The hum
  had ceased; the demon halo was dying. Already the stones of the altar had
  assumed their natural tint. But on it the girl lay limp.</p>

  <p>As Glanton crawled over the barrier his heart was in his mouth. Tenderly
  he freed her and lifted her, grateful to feel warm, living flesh under his
  hands, but setting his teeth against what he might find&mdash;but her tender
  back and limbs showed none of the ghastly burns he feared.</p>

  <p>Obviously no great amount of electricity had been turned into the altar.
  He saw wires running in all directions from the amazingly small, compact,
  black case-like thing that stood near the altar.</p>

  <p>Before he carried Joan out of the ring he smashed the thing with a heavy
  rock. The Black Brothers knew secrets that were better kept from the world at
  large. Even clean science became hurtful black magic in their hands. That
  tiny dynamo, of a type undreamed of by the world, contained more energy than
  sane men conceived of&mdash;power to turn naked rocks into live wires. Such a
  secret could only be evil.</p>

  <p>He whipped off his torn shirt and wrapped the girl in it, as carefully he
  carried her down to the road.</p>

  <p>As he went, he thought of Joshua, and the only logical explanation offered
  itself. The bullet that had struck the madman had not killed him, but only
  creased him and knocked him out. When he came to himself, he started on the
  trail of the woman his crazed brain desired, drawn either by the same glimpse
  of the distant fire that had drawn Glanton, or by dark, psychic instinct.</p>

  <p>Glanton had almost reached the car when Joan opened her eyes, stared about
  her wildly, then clung to him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, kid," he soothed her. "You're not hurt. You just fainted.
  Everything's all right now. Joshua paid his debt, without meaning to, poor
  devil. Look, it's getting daylight. The night's past."</p>

  <p>He meant it in more than its literal sense. "Take me home, Emmett," she
  whimpered, nestling deep into his arms. Then, irrelevantly: "Kiss me."</p>

  <p>And Emmett Glanton kissed his wife for the first time, just as dawn
  touched the eastern hills.</p>
