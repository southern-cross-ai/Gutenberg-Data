  <p class="poem">Howrah City bows the knee<br>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Siva, Shiva</i>&mdash;one of the principal Hindu
  deities, worshiped as the destroyer and restorer of worlds and in numerous
  other forms. Shiva is often conceived as a member of the triad also including
  Brahma and Vishnu. <i><a href=

  <p class="first">THAT was no time or place for any girl of twenty to be
  wandering unprotected. Rosemary McClean knew it; the old woman, of the
  sweeper caste, that is no caste at all,&mdash;the hag with the flat breasts
  and wrinkled skin, who followed her dogwise, and was no more protection than
  a toothless dog,&mdash;knew it well, and growled about it in incessant
  undertones that met with neither comment nor response.</p>

  <p>"Leave a pearl of price to glisten on the street, yes!" she grumbled.
  "Perhaps none might notice it&mdash;perhaps! But her&mdash;here&mdash; at
  this time&mdash;" She would continue in a rumbling growl of half-prophetic
  catalogues of evil&mdash;some that she had seen to happen, some that she
  imagined, and not any part of which was in the least improbable.</p>

  <p>As the girl passed through the stenching, many-hued bazaar, the roar would
  cease for a second and then rise again. Turbaned and puggreed*&mdash;
  Mohammedan and Hindu&mdash;men of all grades of colour, language, and belief,
  but with only one theory on women, would stare first at the pony that she
  rode, then at her, and then at the ancient grandmother who trotted in her
  wake. Low jests would greet the grandmother, and then the trading and the
  gambling would resume, together with the under-thread of restlessness that
  was so evidently there and yet so hard to lay a finger on.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pugree, puggry, puggerie</i> (Hindi: "pagri,"
  turban)&mdash;a scarf of cotton or silk wound round the hat in turban-form,
  to protect the head from the sun. <i><a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-
bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:889.hobson">The
  Hobson Jobson Dictionary</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>The sun beat down pitilessly&mdash;brass&mdash;like the din of cymbals.
  Beneath the sun helmet that sat so squarely and straightforwardly on the tidy
  chestnut curls, her face was pale. She smiled as she guided her pony in and
  out amid the roaring throng, and carefully refused to see the scowls, her
  brave little shoulders seconded a pair of quiet, brave grey eyes in showing
  an unconquerable courage to the world, and her clean, neat cotton
  riding-habit gave the lie and the laugh in one to poverty; but, as the crowd
  had its atmosphere of secret murmuring, she had another of secret
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Neither had fear. She did not believe in it. She was there to help her
  father fight inhuman wrong, and die, if need be, in the last ditch. The crowd
  had none, for it had begun to realize that it was part a of a two-hundred-
  million crowd, held down and compelled by less than a hundred thousand
  aliens. And, least of all, had the man who followed her at a little distance
  the slightest sense of fear. He was far more conversant with it than she, but
  &mdash;unlike her, and far more than the seething crowd&mdash;he knew the
  trend of events, and just what likelihood there was of insult or injury to
  Rosemary McClean being avenged in a generation.</p>

  <p>He caused more comment than she, and of a different kind. His rose-pink
  puggree, with the egret and the diamond brooch to hold the egret in its place
  &mdash;his jeweled saber&mdash;his swaggering, almost ruffianly air
  &mdash;were no more meant to escape attention than his charger that clattered
  and kicked among the crowd, or his following, who cleared a way for him with
  the butt ends of their lances. He rode ahead, but every other minute a
  mounted sepoy* would reach out past him and drive his lance-end into the ribs
  of some one in the way.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sepoy</i> (Persian <i>sipâhi</i>, "soldier")
  &mdash;a native of India employed as a soldier in the service of a European
  power, usually of the United Kingdom. Specifically, it was the term used in
  the British Indian Army for an infantry private (a cavalry trooper was a
  sowar). The same Persian word has reached English via another route in the
  form of "Spahis." <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>There would follow much deep salaaming; more than one head would bow very
  low indeed; and in many languages, by the names of many gods, he would be
  cursed in undertones. Aloud, they would bless him and call him "Heaven-
  born!"</p>

  <p>But he took no interest whatever in the crowd. His dark-brown eyes were
  fixed incessantly on Rosemary McClean's back. Whenever she turned a corner in
  the crowded maze of streets, he would spur on in a hurry until she was in
  sight again, and then his handsome, swarthy face would light with pleasure
  &mdash;wicked pleasure&mdash;self-assertive, certain, cruel. He would rein in
  again to let her draw once more ahead.</p>

  <p>Rosemary McClean knew quite well who was following her, and knew, too,
  that she could do nothing to prevent him. Once, as she passed a species of
  caravansary*&mdash;low-roofed, divided into many lockable partitions, and
  packed tight with babbling humanity&mdash;she caught sight of a pair of long,
  black thigh boots, silver-spurred, and of a polished scabbard that moved
  spasmodically, as though its owner were impatient.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>caravansary, caravanserai</i> (Persian)&mdash;an
  inn built around a large court for accommodating caravans along trade routes
  in central and western Asia; a large inn or hostelry. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/C0097200.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserai">Caravanserai</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"Mohammed Gunga!" she muttered to herself. "I wonder whether he would come
  to my assistance if I needed him. He fought once&mdash;or so he says
  &mdash;for the British; he might be loyal still. I wonder what he is doing
  here, and what&mdash;Oh, I wonder!"</p>

  <p>She was very careful not to seem to look sideways, or seek acquaintance
  with the wearer of the boots; had she done so, she would have gained nothing,
  for the moment that he caught sight of her through the opened door he drew
  back into a shadow, and swore lustily. What he said to himself would have
  been little comfort to her.</p>

  <p>"By the breath of God!" he growled. "These preachers of new creeds are the
  last straw, if one were wanting! They choose the one soft place where
  Mohammedan and Hindu think alike, and smite! If I wanted to raise hell from
  end to end of Hind, I too would preach a new creed, and turn good-looking
  women loose to wander on the country-side!&mdash;Ah!" He drew back even
  further, as he spied the egret and the saber and the stallion cavorting down
  the street&mdash;then thought better of it and strode swaggering to the
  doorway, and stood, crimson-coated, in the sunlight, stroking upward
  insolently at his black, fierce-barbered beard. There was a row of medal
  ribbons on his left breast that bore out something at least of his
  contention; he had been loyal to the British once, whether he was so now or
  not.</p>

  <p>The man on the charger eyed him sideways and passed on. Mohammed Gunga
  waited. One of the prince's followers rode close to him&mdash;leaned low from
  the saddle&mdash;and leered into his face.</p>

  <p>"Knowest not enough to salute thy betters?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga made a movement with his right hand in the direction of his
  left hip&mdash;one that needed no explanation; the other legged his horse
  away, and rode on, grinning nastily. To reassure himself of his superiority
  over everybody but his master, he spun his horse presently so that its rump
  struck against a tented stall, and upset tent and goods. Then he spent two
  full minutes in outrageous execration of the men who struggled underneath the
  gaudy cloth, before cantering away, looking, feeling, riding like a fearless
  man again. Mohammed Gunga sneered after him, and spat, and turned his back on
  the sunshine and the street.</p>

  <p>"I had a mind to teach that Hindu who his betters are!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Come in, risaldar-sahib!"* said a voice persuasively. "By your own
  showing the hour is not yet&mdash;why spill blood before the hour?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Risaldar</i>&mdash;a mid-level rank in cavalry and
  armoured units of the Indian Army... A Risaldar ranks above a Naib-Risaldar
  (called a Jemadar in the British Indian Army) and below a Risaldar-Major.
  Risaldars generally command squadrons. In other arms the equivalent is a
  Subedar. <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risaldar">Wikipedia</a></i>. Equivalent of a
  captain. ]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sahib</i> (Hindi from Arabic)&mdash;lord, master,
  sir; also formerly used as a term of respect for white Europeans in colonial
  India. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahib">Sahib</a>. ]</p>

  <p>The Rajput* swaggered to the dark door, spurs jingling, looking back
  across his shoulder once or twice, as though he half-regretted leaving the
  Hindu horseman's head upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Rajput</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a member of the dominant
  Hindu landowning and military lineages inhabiting northern and central India.
  For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> articles <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput">Rajput</a> and <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajputana">Rajputana</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"Come in, sahib," advised the voice again. "They be many. We are few. And,
  who knows&mdash;our roads may lie together yet."</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga kicked his scabbard clear, and strode through the door. The
  shadows inside and the hum of voices swallowed him as though he were a big,
  red, black-legged devil re-assimilated in the brewing broth of trouble; but
  his voice boomed deep and loud after he had disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>"When their road and my road lie together, we will travel all feet
  foremost!" he asserted.</p>

  <p>Ten turnings further away by that time, Rosemary McClean pressed on
  through the hot, dinning swarm of humanity, missing no opportunity to slip
  her pony through an opening, but trying, too, to seem unaware that she was
  followed. She chose narrow, winding ways, where the awnings almost met above
  the middle of the street, and where a cavalcade of horsemen would not be
  likely to follow her&mdash;only to hear a roar behind her, as the prince's
  escort started slashing at the awnings with their swords.</p>

  <p>There was a rush and a din of shouting beside her and ahead, as the
  frightened merchants scurried to pull down their awnings before the ruthless
  horse-men could ride down on them; the narrow street transformed itself
  almost on the instant into a undraped, cleared defile between two walls. And
  after that she kept to the broader streets, where there was room in the
  middle for a troop to follow, four abreast, should it choose. She had no mind
  to seek her own safety at the expense of men whose souls her father was
  laboring so hard to save.</p>

  <p>She got no credit, though, for consideration&mdash;only blame for what the
  swordsmen had already done. One man&mdash;a Maharati* trader&mdash;
  half-naked, his black hair coiled into a shaggy rope and twisted up above his
  neck&mdash;followed her, side-tracking through the mazy byways of the
  bewildering mart, and coming out ahead of her&mdash;or lurking beside bales
  of merchandise and waiting his opportunity to leap from shadow into shadow
  unobserved.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Maharati</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a native or inhabitant
  of the Indian state of Maharashtra. See the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. ]</p>

  <p>He followed her until she reached the open, where a double row of trees on
  each side marked the edge of a big square, large enough for the drilling of
  an army. Along one side of the square there ran the high brick wall, topped
  with a kind of battlement, that guarded the Maharajah's* palace grounds from
  the eyes of men.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Maharajah, Maharaja</i> (Hindi, "high king")
  &mdash;a king or prince in India ranking above a rajah, especially the
  sovereign of one of the former native states. The female equivalent to
  Maharaja is Maharani (or Maharanee), a title used either by the wife of a
  Maharaja or, in the few states where that is possible, by a woman ruling in
  her own right. Paraphrased from <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja">Wikipedia</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>Just as she turned, just as she was starting to canter her pony beside the
  long wall, he leaped out at her and seized her reins. The old woman screamed,
  and ran to the wall and cowered there.</p>

  <p>Very likely the man only meant to frighten her and heap insults on her,
  for in '56, though wrath ran deep and strong, men waited. There was to be
  sudden, swift whelming when the time came, not intermittent outrage. But he
  had no time to do more than rein her pony back onto its haunches.</p>

  <p>There came a clatter of scurrying hoofs behind, and from a whirl of dust,
  topped by a rose-pink puggree, a steel blade swooped down on her and him. A
  surge of brown and pink and cream, and a dozen rainbow tints flashed past
  her; a long boot brushed her saddle on the off side. There was a sickening
  sound, as something hard swished and whicked home; her pony reeled from the
  shock of a horse's shoulder, and&mdash;none too gently&mdash;none too
  modestly&mdash;the prince with the egret and the handsome face reined in on
  his horse's haunches and saluted her.</p>

  <p>There was blood, becoming dull-brown in the dust between them. He shook
  his saber, and the blood dripped from it then he held it outstretched, and a
  horseman wiped it, before he returned it with a clang.</p>

  <p>"The sahiba's servant!" he said magnificently, making no motion to let her
  pass, but twisting with his sword-hand at his waxed moustache and smiling
  darkly.</p>

  <p>She looked down between them at the thing that but a minute since had
  lived, and loved perhaps as well as hated.</p>

  <p>"Shame on you, Jaimihr-sahib!" she said, shuddering. A year ago she would
  have fallen from her pony in a swoon, but one year of Howrah and its daily
  horrors had so hardened her that she could look and loathe without the saving
  grace of losing consciousness.</p>

  <p>"The shame would have been easier to realize, had I taken more than one
  stroke!" he answered irritably, still blocking the way on his great horse,
  still twisting at his moustache point, still looking down at her through eyes
  that blazed a dozen accumulated centuries' store of lawless ambition. He was
  proud of that back-handed swipe of his that would cleave a man each time at
  one blow from shoulder-joint to ribs, severing the backbone. A woman of his
  own race would have been singing songs in praise of him and his skill in
  swordsmanship already; but no woman of his own race would have looked him in
  the eye like that and dared him, nor have done what she did next. She leaned
  over and swished his charger with her little whip, and slipped past him.</p>

  <p>He swore, deep and fiercely, as he spurred and wheeled, and cantered after
  her. His great stallion could overhaul her pony in a minute, going stride for
  stride; the wall was more than two miles long with no break in it other than
  locked gates; there was no hurry. He watched her through half-closed,
  glowering, appraising eyes as he cantered in her wake, admiring the frail,
  slight figure in the grey cotton habit, and bridling his desire to make her
  &mdash;seize her reins, and halt, and make her&mdash;admit him master of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>As he reached her stirrup, she reined in and faced him, after a hurried
  glance that told her her duenna had failed her. The old woman was
  invisible.</p>

  <p>"Will you leave that body to lie there in the dust and sun?" she asked
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I am no vulture, or jackal, or hyena, sahiba!" he smiled. "I do not eat
  carrion!" He seemed to think that that was a very good retort, for he showed
  his wonderful white teeth until his handsome face was the epitome of self-
  satisfied amusement. His horse blocked the way again, and all retreat was cut
  off, for his escort were behind her, and three of them had ridden to the
  right, outside the row of trees, to cut off possible escape in that
  direction. "Was it not well that I was near, sahiba? Would it have been
  better to die at the hands of a Maharati of no caste&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Than to see blood spilt&mdash;than to be beholden to a murderer?
  Infinitely better! There was no need to kill that man&mdash;I could have
  quieted him. Let me pass, please, Jaimihr-sahib!"</p>

  <p>He reined aside; but if she thought that cold scorn or hot anger would
  either of them quell his ardor, she had things reversed. The less she behaved
  as a native woman would have done&mdash;the more she flouted him&mdash; the
  more enthusiastic he became.</p>

  <p>"Sahiba!"&mdash;he trotted beside her, his great horse keeping up easily
  with her pony's canter&mdash;"I have told you oftener than once that I make a
  good friend and a bad enemy!"</p>

  <p>"And I have answered oftener than once that I do not need your friendship,
  and am not afraid of you! You forget that the British Government will hold
  your royal brother liable for my safety and my father's!"</p>

  <p>"You, too, overlook certain things, sahiba." He spoke evenly, with a
  little space between each word. With the dark look that accompanied it, with
  the blood barely dry yet on the dusty road behind, his speech was not
  calculated to reassure a slip of a girl, grey-eyed or not, stiff-chinned or
  not, borne up or not by Scots enthusiasm for a cause. "This is a native
  state. My brother rules. The British&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are near enough, and strong enough, to strike and to bring you and your
  brother to your knees if you harm a British woman!" she retorted. "You forget
  &mdash;when the British Government gives leave to missionaries to go into a
  native state, it backs them up with a strong arm!"</p>

  <p>"You build too much on the British and my brother, sahiba! Listen&mdash;
  Howrah is as strong as I am, and no stronger. Had he been stronger, he would
  have slain me long ago. The British are&mdash;" He checked himself and
  trotted beside her in silence for a minute. She affected complete
  indifference; it was as though she had not heard him; if she could not be rid
  of him, she at least knew how to show him his utter unimportance in her
  estimation.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard, sahiba, of the Howrah treasure? Of the rubies? Of the
  pearls? Of the emeralds? Of the bars of gold? It is foolishness, of course;
  we who are modern-minded see the crime of hoarding all that wealth, and
  adding to it, for twenty generations. Have you heard of it, sahiba?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered savagely, swishing at his charger again to make him
  keep his distance. "You have told me of it twice. You have told me that you
  know where it is, and you have offered to show it to me. You have told me
  that you and your brother Maharajah Howrah and the priests of Siva are the
  only men who know where it is, and you lust for that treasure! I can see you
  lust! You think that I lust too, and you make a great mistake Jaimihr-sahib!
  You see, I remember what you have told me. Now, go away and remember what I
  tell you. I care for you and for your treasure exactly that!" She hit his
  charger with all her might, and at the sting of the little whip he shied
  clear of the road before the Rajah's brother could rein him in.</p>

  <p>Again her effort to destroy his admiration for her had directly the
  opposite effect. He swore, and he swore vengeance; but he swore, too, that
  there was no woman in the East so worth a prince's while as this one, who
  dared flout him with her riding-whip before his men!</p>

  <p>"Sahiba!" he said, sidling close to her again, and bowing in the saddle in
  mock cavalier humility. "The time will come when your government and my
  brother, who&mdash;at present&mdash;is Maharajah Howrah&mdash;will be of
  little service to you. Then, perhaps, you may care to recall my promise to
  load all the jewels you can choose out of the treasure-house on you. Then,
  perhaps, you may, remember that I said 'a throne is better than a grave,
  sahiba.' Or else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or else what, Jaimihr-sahib?" She reined again and wheeled about and
  faced him&mdash;pale-trembling a little&mdash;looking very small and frail
  beside him on his great war-horse, but not flinching under his gaze for a
  single second.</p>

  <p>"Or else, sahiba&mdash;I think you saw me slay the Maharati? Do you think
  that I would stop at anything to accomplish what I had set out to do? See,
  sahiba&mdash;there is a little blood there on your jacket! Let that be for a
  pledge between us&mdash;for a sign&mdash;or a token of my oath that on the
  day I am Maharajah Howrah, you are Maharani&mdash;mistress of all the jewels
  in the treasure-house!"</p>

  <p>She shuddered. She did not look to find the blood; she took his word for
  that, if for nothing else.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you dare tell me that you plot against your brother!" That was
  more a spoken thought than a statement or a question.</p>

  <p>"I would be very glad if you would warn my brother!" he answered her; and
  she knew like a flash, and on the instant, that what he said was true. She
  had been warned before she came to bear no tales to any one. No Oriental
  would believe the tale, coming from her; the Maharajah would arrest her
  promptly, glad of the excuse to vent his hatred of Christian missionaries.
  Jaimihr would attempt a rescue; it was common knowledge that he plotted for
  the throne. There would be instant civil war, in which the British Government
  would perforce back up the alleged protector of a defenseless woman. There
  would be a new Maharajah; then, in a little while, and in all likelihood, she
  would have disappeared forever while the war raged. There would be, no doubt,
  a circumstantial story of her death from natural causes.</p>

  <p>She did not answer. She stared back at him, and he smiled down at her,
  twisting at his moustache.</p>

  <p>"Think!" he said, nodding. "A throne, sahiba, is considerably better than
  a grave!" Then he wheeled like a sudden dust-devil and decamped in a cloud of
  dust, followed at full pelt by his clattering escort. She watched their
  horses leap one after the other the corpse of the Maharati that lay by the
  corner where it fell, and she saw the last of them go clattering, whirling up
  the street through the bazaar. The old hag rose out of a shadow and trotted
  after her again as she turned and rode on, pale-faced and crying now a
  little, to the little begged school place where her father tried to din the
  alphabet into a dozen low-caste fosterlings.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she cried, and she all but fell out of the saddle into his arms
  as the tall, lean Scotsman came to the door to meet her and stood blinking in
  the sunlight. "Father, I've seen another man killed! I've had another scene
  with Jaimihr! I can't endure it! I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, why did I ever
  come?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, dear," he answered. "But you would come, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p class="first">HEMMED in amid the stifling stench and babel of the
  caravansary, secluded by the very denseness of the many-minded swarm, five
  other Rajputs and Mohammed Gunga&mdash;all six, according to their turbans,
  followers of Islam&mdash;discussed matters that appeared to bring them little
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>They sat together in a dark, low-ceilinged room; its open door&mdash;it
  was far too hot to close anything that admitted air&mdash;gave straight onto
  the street, and the one big window opened on a courtyard, where a pair of
  game-cocks fought in and out between the restless legs of horses, while a
  yelling horde betted on them. On a heap of grass fodder in a corner of the
  yard an all-but-naked expert in harmony thumped a skin tom-tom with his
  knuckles, while at his feet the own-blood brother to the screech-owls wailed
  of hell's torments on a wind instrument.</p>

  <p>Din&mdash;glamour&mdash;stink&mdash;incessant movement&mdash; interblended
  poverty and riches rubbing shoulders&mdash;noisy self-interest side by side
  with introspective reverie, where stray priests nodded in among the

  unexplainable, in ever-moving flux, but more conservative in spite of it than
  the very rocks she rests on&mdash;India who is sister to Aholibah* and mother
  of all fascination.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Aholah</i> and <i>Aholibah</i> (or: <i>Oholah</i>
  and <i>Oholibah</i>)&mdash;pejorative names given by the prophet Ezekiel to
  the kingdom of Israel and Judah, respectively. They appear in <a href=

  There is a pun in these names in the Hebrew. Oholah means "her tent", and
  Oholibah means "my tent is in her". Ezekiel's rhetoric portrays Oholah and
  Oholibah, or Samaria and Jerusalem, as the daughters of one mother. Both are
  said to be "brides of God", and both are guilty of idolatry and of religious
  and political alliances with Gentile nations. These kingdoms are described as
  prostitutes and adulteresses, given up to the abominations and idolatries of
  the Egyptians and Assyrians. Because of Oholah's crimes, she was carried away
  captive, and ceased to be a kingdom. (Comp. <a href=

  the sin of adultery, in a frequently reappearing rhetorical figure ...

  <p>In that room with the long window, low-growled, the one thin thread of
  clear-sighted unselfishness was reeling out to very slight approval. Mohammed
  Gunga paced the floor and kicked his toes against the walls, as he turned at
  either end, until his spurs jingled, and looked with blazing dark-brown eyes
  from one man to the other.</p>

  <p>"What good ever came of listening to priests?" he asked. "All priests are
  alike&mdash;ours, and theirs, and padre-sahibs! They all preach peace and
  goad the lust that breeds war and massacre! Does a priest serve any but
  himself? Since when? There will come this rising that the priests speak of
  &mdash;yes! Of a truth, there will, for the priests will see to it! There is
  a padre-sahib here in Howrah now for the Hindu priests to whet their hate on.
  You saw the woman ride past here a half-hour gone? There is a pile of tinder
  ready here, and any fool of a priest can make a spark! There will be a
  rising, and a big one!"</p>

  <p>"There will! Of a truth, there will!" Alwa, his cousin, crossed one leg
  above the other with a clink of spurs and scabbard. He had no objection to
  betraying interest, but declined for the present to betray his hand.</p>

  <p>"There will be a blood-letting that will do no harm to us Rajputs!" said
  another man, whose eyes gleamed from the darkest corner; he, too, clanked his
  scabbard as though the sound were an obbligato to his thoughts. "Sit still
  and say nothing is my advice; we will be all ready to help ourselves when the
  hour comes!"</p>

  <p>"It is this way," said Mohammed Gunga, standing straddle-legged to face
  all five of them, with his back to the window. He stroked his black beard
  upward with one hand and fingered with the other at his saber-hilt. "Without
  aid when the hour does come, the English will be smashed&mdash;worn down
  &mdash;starved out&mdash;surrounded&mdash;stamped out&mdash;
  annihilated&mdash;so!" He stamped with his heel descriptively on the hard
  earth floor. "And then, what?"</p>

  <p>"Then, the plunder!" said Alwa, showing a double row of wonderful white
  teeth. The other four grinned like his reflections. "Ay, there will be
  plunder&mdash;for the priests! And we Rajputs will have new masters over us!
  Now, as things are, we have honorable men. They are fools, for any man is a
  fool who will not see and understand the signs. But they are honest. They
  ride straight! They look us straight between the eyes, and speak truth, and
  fear nobody! Will the Hindu priests, who will rule India afterwards, be thus?
  Nay! Here is one sword for the British when the hour comes!"</p>

  <p>"I have yet to see a Hindu priest rule me or plunder me!" said Alwa with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>"You will live to see it!" said Mohammed Gunga. "Truly, you will live to
  see it, unless you throw your weight into the other scale! What are we
  Rajputs without a leader whom we all trust? What have we ever been?" He swung
  on his heels suddenly&mdash;angrily&mdash;and began to pace the floor
  again&mdash;then stopped.</p>

  <p>"Divided, and again subdivided&mdash;one-fifth Mohammedan and four- fifths
  Hindu&mdash;clan within clan, and each against the other. Do we own
  Rajputana?* Nay! Do we rule it? Nay! What were we until Cunnigan-bahadur
  came?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Rajputana</i>&mdash;an historic region of Northwest
  India; roughly coextensive with the modern Indian state of Rajasthan. The
  name means "land of the Rajputs." Rajput tribal power rose here between the
  7th and 13th cent., and the princes resisted the early Moslem incursions,
  which began in the 11th cent. Rajput power reached its peak in the early 16th
  cent., but the area fell to the Mughals when Akbar captured the fort of
  Chitor in 1568. From their seat at Ajmer the Mughals ruled Rajputana until
  the early 18th cent. The Marathas held feudatories in the region from c.1750
  to 1818, when it passed to Great Britain. Under the British, Rajputana
  included more than 20 princely states, notably Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur,
  Udaipur, and Ajmer. The internal autonomy of many of the states was
  guaranteed. Most of these states were incorporated into Rajasthan after India
  gained independence in 1947. <i><a href=

  <p>"Ah!" All five men rose with a clank in honor to the memory of that man.
  "Cunnigan-bahadur!* Show us such another man as he was, and I and mine ride
  at his back!" said Alwa. "Not all the English are like Cunnigan! A Cunnigan
  could have five thousand men the minute that he asked for them!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bahadur</i> (Hindi "hero," "champion")&mdash;a
  title of respect or honor given to European officers in East Indian state
  papers, and colloquially, and among the natives, to distinguished officials
  and other important personages. <i><a href=

  <p>"Am I a wizard?&mdash;Can I cast spells and bring dead men's spirits from
  the dead again? I know of no man to take his place," said Mohammed Gunga
  sadly.</p>

  <p>He was the poorest of them, but they were all, comparatively speaking,
  poor men; for the long peace had told its tale on a race of men who are first
  gentlemen, then soldiers, and last&mdash;least of all&mdash;and only as a
  last resource, landed proprietors. The British, for whom they had often
  fought because that way saber seemed to lie, had impoverished them afterwards
  by passing and enforcing zamindari* laws that lifted nine-tenths of the
  burden from the necks of starving tenants. The new law was just, as the
  Rajputs grudgingly admitted, but it pinched their pockets sadly; like the
  old-time English squires, they would give their best blood and their last
  rack-rent-wrung rupee for the cause that they believed in, but they resented
  interference with the rack-rents! Mahommed Gunga had had influence enough
  with these five landlord relations of his to persuade them to come and meet
  him in Howrah City to discuss matters; the mere fact that he had thought it
  worth his while to leave his own little holding in the north had satisfied
  them that he would be well worth listening to&mdash;for no man rode six
  hundred miles on an empty errand. But they needed something more than words
  before they pledged the word that no Rajput gentleman will ever break.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>zamindari, zemindary</i>&mdash;a system of tax
  collection employed by the Mughals and continued under British rule. After
  independence, however, the system was abolished in India and East Pakistan
  (present day Bangladesh), but is still current in Pakistan. The word
  'Zamindar' has for some time been used for a peasant who owns land.
  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindar">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Find us a Cunnigan&mdash;bring him to us&mdash;prove him to us &mdash;and
  if a blade worth having from end to end of Rajputana is not at his service, I
  myself will gut the Hindu owner of it! That is my given word!" said Alwa.</p>

  <p>"He had a son," said Mohammed Gunga quietly.</p>

  <p>"True. Are all sons like their fathers? Take Maharajah Howrah here; his
  father was a man with whom any soldier might be proud to pick a quarrel. The
  present man is afraid of his own shadow on the wall&mdash;divided between
  love for the treasure-chests he dare not broach and fear of a brother whom he
  dare not kill. He is priest-ridden, priest-taught, and fit to be nothing but
  a priest. Who knows how young Cunnigan will shape? Where is he? Overseas yet!
  He must prove himself, as his father did, before he can hope to lead a free
  regiment of horse!"</p>

  <p>"Then Cunnigan-bahadur's watch-word 'For the peace of India,' is dead
  &mdash;died with him?" asked Mohammed Gunga. "We are each for our own
  again?"</p>

  <p>"I have spoken!" answered Alwa. As the biggest clan-chief left on all that
  countryside, he had a right to speak before the others, and he knew that what
  he said would carry weight when they had all ridden home again, and the
  report had gone abroad in ever-widening rings. "If the English can hold
  India, let them! I will not fight against them, for they are honest men for
  all their madness. If they cannot, then I am for Rajputana, not India&mdash;
  India may burn or rot or burst to pieces, so long as Rajputana stands! But
  &mdash;" He paused a moment, and looked at each man in turn, and tapped his
  saber-hilt, "&mdash;if a Cunnigan-bahadur were among us&mdash;a man whom I
  could trust to lead me and mine and every man&mdash;I would lend him my sword
  for the sheer saber of helping him hack truth out of corruption! I have
  nothing more to say!"</p>

  <p>"One word more, cousin!" said Mohammed Gunga. "I was risaldar in Cunnigan-
  bahadur's regiment of horse. There was more than mere discipline between us.
  I ate his salt. Once&mdash;when he might have saved himself the trouble
  without any daring to reproach him&mdash;he risked his own life, and a troop,
  and his reputation to save a woman of my family from capture, and something
  worse. There was never a Rajput or any other native woman wronged while he
  was with us."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I am no friend of Christian priests&mdash;of padres. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She who rode by just now? What, then?"</p>

  <p>"I ride northward now, and then very likely South again. I can do nothing
  in the matter, yet&mdash;were he in my shoes, and she a native woman at the
  mercy of the troops&mdash;Cunnigan-bahadur would have assigned a guard for
  her."</p>

  <p>"Ho! So I am thy sepoy?" sneered Alwa, standing sideways&mdash;looking
  sideways&mdash;and throwing out his chest. "I am to do thy bidding, guarding
  stray padres" (he spoke the word as though it were a bad taste he was
  spitting from his mouth), "and herding women without purdah,* while thou
  ridest on assignations Allah knows where? Since when?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>purdah</i> (Urdu)&mdash;1) a curtain or screen,
  used mainly in India to keep women separate from men or strangers; 2) the
  Hindu or Muslim system of sex segregation, practiced especially by keeping
  women in seclusion; 3) social seclusion. <a href=

  Dictionary</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>"I have yet to refuse to guard thy back, or thy good name, Alwa!" Mohammed
  Gunga eyed him straight, and thrust his hilt out. "The woman is nothing to me
  &mdash;the padre-sahib less. It is because of the debt I owe to Cunnigan that
  I ask this favor."</p>

  <p>"Oh. It is granted! Should she appeal to me, I will rip Howrah into rags
  and burn this city to protect her if need be! She must first ask, though,
  even as thou didst."</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga saluted him, bolt-upright as a lance, and without the
  slightest change in his expression.</p>

  <p>"The word is sufficient, cousin!"</p>

  <p>Alwa returned his salute, and raised his voice in a gruff command. A sais*
  outside the window woke as though struck by a stick&mdash;sprang to his
  feet&mdash;and passed the order on. A dozen horses clattered in the courtyard
  and filed through the arched passage to the street, and Alwa mounted. The
  others, each with his escort, followed suit, and a moment later, with no
  further notice of one another, but with as much pomp and noise as though they
  owned the whole of India, the five rode off, each on his separate way,
  through the scattering crowd.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sais, saice, syce</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a coachman, a
  groom. <i><a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-
bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:257.hobson">The
  Hobson Jobson Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Then Mohammed Gunga called for his own horse and the lone armed man of his
  own race who acted squire to him.</p>

  <p>"Did any overhear our talk?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Not the sais, even?"</p>

  <p>"No, sahib. He slept."</p>

  <p>"He awoke most suddenly, and at not much noise."</p>

  <p>"For that reason I know he slept, sahib. Had he been pretending, he would
  have wakened slowly."</p>

  <p>"Thou art no idiot!" said Mohammed Gunga. "Wait here until I return, and
  lie a few lies if any ask thee why we six came together, and of what we
  spoke!"</p>

  <p>Then he mounted and rode off slowly, picking his way through the throng
  much more cautiously and considerately than his relatives had done, though
  not, apparently, because he loved the crowd. He used some singularly biting
  insults to help clear the way, and frowned as though every other man he
  looked at were either an assassin or&mdash;what a good Mohammedan considers
  worse&mdash;an infidel. He reached the long brick wall at last&mdash; broke
  into a canter&mdash;scattered the pariah dogs that were nosing and quarreling
  about the corpse of the Maharati, and drew rein fifteen minutes later by the
  door of the tiny school place that Miss McClean had entered.</p>

  <p class="poem">For service truly rendered, and for duty dumbly done

  For men who neither tremble nor forget&mdash;<br>
  There is due reward, my henchman. There is saber to be won.<br>
  There is watch and ward and sterner duty yet.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NO sound came, from within the schoolhouse. The little
  building, coaxed from a grudging Maharajah, seemed to strain for light and
  air between two overlapping, high-walled brick warehouses. Before the door,
  in a spot where the scorching sun-rays came but fitfully between a mesh of
  fast-decaying thatch, the old hag who had followed Rosemary McClean lay
  snoozing, muttering to herself, and blinking every now and then as a street
  dog blinks at the passers-by. She took no notice of Mohammed Gunga until he
  swore at her.</p>

  <p>"Miss-sahib hai?" he growled; and the woman jumped up in a hurry and went
  inside. A moment later Rosemary McClean stood framed in the doorway still in
  her cotton riding-habit, very pale&mdash;evidently frightened at the
  summons&mdash;but strangely, almost ethereally, beautiful. Her wealth of
  chestnut hair was loosely coiled above her neck, as though she had been
  caught in the act of dressing it. She looked like the wan, wasted spirit of
  human pity&mdash;he like a great, grim war-god.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Miss Maklin-sahib!"</p>

  <p>He dismounted as he spoke and stood at attention, then stared truculently,
  too inherently chivalrous to deny her civility&mdash;he would have cut his
  throat as soon as address her from horseback while she stood&mdash;and too
  contemptuous of her father's calling to be more civil than he deemed in
  keeping with his saber.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Mohammed Gunga!" She seemed very much relieved, although doubtful
  yet. "Not letters again?"</p>

  <p>"No, Miss-sahib. I am no mail-carrier! I brought those letters as a favor
  to Franklin-sahib at Peshawar; I was coming hither, and he had no man to
  send. I will take letters, since I am now going, if there are letters ready;
  I ride to-night."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mohammed Gunga. I have letters for England. They are not yet
  sealed. May I send them to you before you start?"</p>

  <p>"I will send my man for them. Also, Miss Maklin-sahib" (heavens! how much
  cleaner and better that sounded than the prince's ironical "sahiba"!)</p>

  <p>"If you wish it, I will escort you to Peshawar, or to any city between
  here and there."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but why?"</p>

  <p>"I saw Jaimihr. I know Jaimihr."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;this is no place for a padre, or for the daughter of a
  padre."</p>

  <p>What he said was true, but it was also insolent, said insolently.</p>

  <p>"Mohammed Gunga-sahib, what are those ribbons on your breast?" she asked
  him.</p>

  <p>He glanced down at them, and his expression changed a trifle; it was
  scarcely perceptible, but underneath his fierce moustache the muscles of his
  mouth stiffened.</p>

  <p>"They are medal ribbons&mdash;for campaigns," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Three-four-five! Then, you were a soldier a long time? Did you&mdash; did
  you desert your post when there was danger?"</p>

  <p>He flushed, and raised his hand as though about to speak.</p>

  <p>"Or did people insult you when you chose to remain on duty?"</p>

  <p>"Miss-sahib, I have not insulted you!" said Mohammed Gunga. "I came here
  for another purpose."</p>

  <p>"You came, very kindly, to ask whether there were letters. Thank you,
  Mohammed Gunga-sahib, for your courtesy. There are letters, and I will give
  them to your man, if you will be good enough to send him for them."</p>

  <p>He still stood there, staring at her with eyes that did not blink. He was
  too much of a soldier to admit himself at a loss what to say, yet he had no
  intention of leaving Howrah without saying it, for that, too, would have been
  unsoldierly.</p>

  <p>"The reason why your countrymen have found men of this land before now to
  fight for them&mdash;one reason, at least&mdash;" he said gruffly, "is that
  hitherto they have not meddled with our religions. It is not safe! It would
  be better to come away, Miss-sahib."</p>

  <p>"Would you like to say that to my father? He is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Allah forbid that I should argue with him! I spoke to you, on your
  account!"</p>

  <p>"You forget, I think," she answered him gently, "that we had permission
  from the British Government to come here; it has not been withdrawn. We are
  doing no harm here&mdash;trying only to do good. There is always danger
  when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would speak of that," he interrupted&mdash;"You will not come
  away?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Your father could remain."</p>

  <p>She shook her head again. "I stay with him," she answered.</p>

  <p>"At present, Jaimihr is the danger, Miss-sahib; but I think that at
  present he will dare do nothing. The Maharajah dare do nothing either, yet.
  Should either of them make a move to interfere with you, it would not be safe
  to appeal to the other one. You will not understand, but it is so. In that
  event, there is a way to safety of which I would warn you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mohammed Gunga. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"There are men more than a day's ride away from here who are to be
  depended on&mdash;by you, at least&mdash;under all circumstances. Is that old
  woman to be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" she smiled. "I believe she is fond of me."</p>

  <p>"That should be enough. I would like, if the Miss-sahib will permit, to
  speak with her."</p>

  <p>At a word from Miss McClean the old hag came out into the sun again and
  blinked at the Rajput, very much afraid of him. Mohammed Gunga saluted Miss
  McClean&mdash;swore at the old woman&mdash;pointed a wordless order with his
  right arm&mdash;watched her shuffle half a hundred yards up-street
  &mdash;followed her, and growled at her for about five minutes, while she
  nodded. Finally, he drew from the pocket of his crimson coat a small handful
  of gold mohurs&mdash;fat, dignified coins that glittered&mdash;and held them
  out toward her with an air as though they meant nothing to him&mdash;
  positively nothing. Her eyes gleamed. He let her take a good look at the
  money before replacing it, then tossed her a silver quarter-rupee piece,
  saluted Miss McClean again&mdash;for she was watching the pantomime from the
  doorway still&mdash;and mounted and rode off, his back looking like the back
  of one who has neither care nor fear nor master.</p>

  <p>At the caravansary his squire came running out to hold his stirrup.</p>

  <p>"Picket the horse in the yard," said Mohammed Gunga, "then find me another
  servant and bring him to me in the room here!"</p>

  <p>"Another servant? But, sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said another servant! Has deafness overcome thee?" He used a word in
  the dialect which left no room for doubt as to his meaning; it was to be a
  different servant&mdash;a substitute for the squire he had already. The
  squire bowed his head in disciplined obedience and led the horse away.</p>

  <p>An hour later&mdash;evening was drawing on&mdash;he came back, followed by
  a somewhat ruffianly-looking half-breed Rajput-Punjabi. The new man was
  rather ragged and lacked one eye, but with the single eye he had he looked
  straight at his prospective master. Mohammed Gunga glared at him, but the man
  did not quail or shrink.</p>

  <p>"This fellow wishes honorable service, sahib." The squire spoke as though
  he were calling his master's attention to a horse that was for sale. "I have
  seen his family; I have inquired about him; and I have explained to him that
  unless he serves at thee faithfully his wife and his man child will die at my
  hands in his absence."</p>

  <p>"Can he groom a horse?"</p>

  <p>"So he says, sahib, and so say others."</p>

  <p>"Can he fight?"</p>

  <p>"He slew the man with his bare hands who pricked his eye out with a
  sword."</p>

  <p>"Oh! What payment does he ask?"</p>

  <p>"He leaves that matter to your honor's pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Good. Instruct him, then. Set him to cleaning my horse and then return
  here."</p>

  <p>The squire was back again within five minutes and stood before Mohammed
  Gunga in silent expectation.</p>

  <p>"I shall miss thee," said Mohammed Gunga after five minutes' reflection.
  "It is well that I have other servants in the north."</p>

  <p>"In what have I offended, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"In nothing. Therefore there is a trust imposed."</p>

  <p>The man salaamed. Mohammed Gunga produced his little handful of gold
  mohurs and divided it into two equal portions; one he handed to the
  squire.</p>

  <p>"Stay here. Be always either in the caravansary or else at call. Should
  the old woman who serves Miss Maklin-sahib, the padre-sahib's daughter come
  and ask thy aid, then saddle swiftly the three horses I will leave with thee,
  and bear Miss Maklin-sahib and her father to my cousin Alwa's place. Present
  two of the gold mohurs to the hag, should that happen."</p>

  <p>"But sahib&mdash;two mohurs? I could buy ten such hags outright for the
  price!"</p>

  <p>"She has my word in the matter! It is best to have her eager to win great
  reward. The hag will stay awake, but see to it that thou sleepest not!"</p>

  <p>"And for how long must I stay here, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"One month&mdash;six months&mdash;a year&mdash;who knows? Until the hag
  summons thee, or I, by writing or by word of mouth, relieve thee of thy
  trust."</p>

  <p>At sunset he sent the squire to Miss McClean for the letters he had
  promised to deliver; and at one hour after sunset, when the heat of the earth
  had begun to rise and throw back a hot blast to the darkened sky and the
  little eddies of luke-warm surface wind made movement for horse and man less
  like a fight with scorching death, he rode off, with his new servant, on the
  two horses left to him of the five with which he came.</p>

  <p>A six-hundred-mile ride without spare horses, in the heat of northern
  India, was an undertaking to have made any strong man flinch. The stronger
  the man, and the more soldierly, the better able he would be to realize the
  effort it would call for. But Mohammed Gunga rode as though he were starting
  on a visit to a near-by friend; he was not given to crossing bridges before
  he reached them, nor to letting prospects influence his peace of mind. He was
  a soldier. He took precautions first, when and where such were possible, then
  rode and looked fate in the eye.</p>

  <p>He appeared to take no more notice of the glowering looks that followed
  him from stuffy balconies and dense-packed corners than of the mosquitoes and
  the heat. Without hurry he picked his way through the thronged streets, where
  already men lay in thousands to escape the breathlessness of walled
  interiors; the gutters seemed like trenches where the dead of a devastated
  city had been laid; the murmur was like the voice of storm-winds gathering,
  and the little lights along the housetops were for the vent-holes on the lid
  of a tormented underworld.</p>

  <p>But he rode on at his ease. Ahead of him lay that which he considered
  duty. He could feel the long-kept peace of India disintegrating all around
  him, and he knew&mdash;he was certain&mdash;as sometimes a brave man can see
  what cleverer men all overlook&mdash;that the right touch by the right man at
  the right moment, when the last taut-held thread should break, would very
  likely swing the balance in favor of peace again, instead of individual self
  seeking anarchy.</p>

  <p>He knew what "Cunnigan-bahadur" would have done. He swore by Cunnigan-
  bahadur. And by the memory of that same dead, desperately honest Cunningham
  he swore that no personal profit or convenience or safety should be allowed
  to stand between him and what was honorable and right! Mohammed Gunga had no
  secrets from himself; nor lack of imagination. He knew that he was riding
  &mdash;not to preserve the peace of India, for that was as good as gone
  &mdash;but to make possible the winning back of it. And he rode with a smile
  on his thin lips, as the crusaders once rode on a less self-advertising
  errand.</p>

  <p class="poem">"You have failed!" whispered Fate, and a weary civilian<br>
  Threw up his task as a matter of course.<br>
  "Failed?" said the soldier. He knew a million<br>
  Chances untackled yet. "Get me a horse!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">THAT was a strange ride of Mohammed Gunga's, and a fateful
  one&mdash; more full of portent for the British Raj* in India than he, or the
  British, or the men amid whose homes he rode could ever have anticipated. He
  averaged a little less than twenty miles a day, and through an Indian
  hot-weather, and with no spare horse, none but a born horseman&mdash;a man of
  light weight and absolute control of temper&mdash;could have accomplished
  that for thirty days on end.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>The British Raj</i> (also simply known as the Raj)
  &mdash;a historical period during which the Indian subcontinent, or present-
  day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were under the colonial authority of the
  British; also included from 1886 was Burma. It lasted from 1858, when the
  rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown, until
  1947, when British India was partitioned into two fully independent states,
  India and Pakistan. Excerpted from <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">Wikipedia</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>Wherever he rode there was the same unrest. Here and there were new
  complaints he had not yet heard of, imaginary some of them, and some only too
  well founded. Wherever there were Rajputs&mdash;and that race of fighting men
  is scattered all about the north&mdash;there was ill-suppressed impatience
  for the bursting of the wrath to come. They bore no grudge against the
  English, but they did bear more than grudge against the money-lenders and the
  fat, litigious traders who had fattened under British rule. At least at the
  beginning it was evident that all the interest of all the Rajputs lay in
  letting the British get the worst of it; even should the British suddenly
  wake up and look about them and take steps&mdash;or should the British hold
  their own with native aid, and so save India from anarchy, and afterwards
  reward the men who helped&mdash;the Rajputs would stand to gain less
  individually, or even collectively, than if they let the English be driven to
  the sea, and then reverted to the age-old state of feudal lawlessness that
  once had made them rich.</p>

  <p>Many of the Hindu element among them were almost openly disloyal. The
  ryots*&mdash;the little one and two acre farmers&mdash;were the least
  unsettled; they, when he asked them&mdash;and he asked often&mdash;
  disclaimed the least desire to change a rule that gave them safe holdings and
  but one tax-collection a year; they were frankly for their individual selves
  &mdash;not even for one another, for the ryots as a class.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ryot, raiyat</i> (Hindi from Arabic)&mdash;a
  nomenclature used customarily and legally for the peasantry of Bengal during
  the Mughal and British periods, but in its widest sense, also used for
  subjects of the state and of the ruling classes. The term seems to have been
  used first in the Todar Mall settlement (1582) and since then it was in
  currency until the term expired legally and practically on the enactment of
  the East Bengal Estate Acquisition Act of 1950 under which the raiyats got a
  new legal nomenclature, malik. But the new term never received popular
  recognition. Jotedar (very rich peasant), Grhastha (quite rich peasant),
  Krsak (ordinary peasant), chasi (marginal peasant), bargadar (sharecropper),
  mazur (farm labourer) are the words which are now used for describing various

  <p>Nobody seemed to be for India, except Mahommed Gunga; and he said little,
  but asked ever-repeated questions as he rode. There were men who would like
  to weld Rajputana into one again, and over-ride the rest of India; and there
  were other men who planned to do the same for the Punjab; there were plots
  within plots, not many of which he learned in anything like detail, but none
  of which were more than skin-deep below the surface. All men looked to the
  sudden, swift, easy whelming of the British Raj, and then to the plundering
  of India; each man expected to be rich when the whelming came, and each man
  waited with ill-controlled impatience for the priests' word that would let
  loose the hundred-million flood of anarchy.</p>

  <p>"And one man&mdash;one real man whom they trusted&mdash;one leader
  &mdash;one man who had one thousand at his back&mdash;could change the whole
  face of things!" he muttered to himself. "Would God there we a Cunnigan! But
  there is no Cunnigan. And who would follow me? They would pull my beard, tell
  me I was scheming for my own ends!&mdash;I, who was taught by Cunnigan, and
  would serve only India!"</p>

  <p>He would ride before dawn and when the evening breeze had come to cool the
  hot earth a little through the blazing afternoons he would lie by some open
  window, where he could watch a hireling flick the flies of his lean, road-
  hardened horse, and listen to the plotting and the carried tales of plots,
  pretending always to be sympathetic or else open to conviction.</p>

  <p>"A soldier? Hah! A soldier fights for the side that can best reward him!"
  he would grin. "And, when there is no side, perhaps he makes one! I am a
  soldier!"</p>

  <p>If they pressed him, he would point to his medal ribbons, that he always
  wore. "The British gave me those for fighting against the northern tribes
  beyond the Himalayas," he would tell them. "The southern tribes&mdash;
  Bengalis of the south and east&mdash;would give better picking than mere
  medal ribbons!"</p>

  <p>They were not all sure of him. They were not all satisfied why he should
  ride on to Peshawar, and decline to stay with them and talk good
  sedition.</p>

  <p>"I would see how the British are!" he told them. And he told the truth.
  But they were not quite satisfied; he would have made a splendid leader to
  have kept among them, until he&mdash;too&mdash;became too powerful and would
  have to be deposed in turn.</p>

  <p>His own holding was a long way from Peshawar, and he was no rich man who
  could afford at a mere whim to ride two long days' march beyond his goal. Nor
  was he, as he had explained to Miss McClean, a letter-carrier; he would get
  no more than the merest thanks for delivering her letters to where they could
  be included in the Government mail-bag. Yet he left the road that would have
  led him homeward to his left, and carried on&mdash;quickening his pace as he
  neared the frontier garrison town, and wasting, then, no time at all on
  seeking information. Nobody supposed that the Pathans and the other frontier
  tribes were anything but openly rebellious, and he would have been an idiot
  to ask questions about their loyalty.</p>

  <p>Because of their disloyalty, and the ever-present danger that they were,
  the biggest British garrison in India had to be kept cooped up in Peshawar,
  to rot with fever and ague and the other ninety Indian plagues.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see that garrison again, and estimate it, and make up his
  mind what exactly, or probably, the garrison would do in the event of the
  rebellion blazing out. And he wanted to try once more to warn some one in
  authority, and make him see the smoldering fire beneath the outer covering of
  sullen silence.</p>

  <p>He received thanks for the letters. He received an invitation to take tea
  on the veranda of an officer so high in the British service that many a staff
  major would have given a month's pay for a like opportunity. But he was
  laughed at for the advice he had to give.</p>

  <p>"Mohammed Gunga, you're like me, you're getting old!" said the high
  official.</p>

  <p>"Not so very old, sahib. I was a young man when Cunnigan-bahadur raised a
  regiment and licked the half of Rajputana into shape with it. Not too old,
  sahib, to wish there were another Cunnigan to ride with!"</p>

  <p>"Well, Mohammed Gunga, you're closer to your wish than you suppose! Young
  Cunningham's gazetted,* and probably just about starting on his way out here
  via the Cape of Good Hope. He should be here in three or four months at the
  outside."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gazette</i> (British English)&mdash;a verb denoting
  the announcement of an official appointment, e.g., to a government post. See
  <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/G0066100.html">The American
  Heritage Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"You mean that, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Wish I didn't! The puppy will arrive here with altogether swollen notions
  of his own importance and what is due his father's son. He's been captain of
  his college at home, and that won't lessen his sense of self-esteem either. I
  can foresee trouble with that boy!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, there is a service I could render!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput spoke with a strangely constrained voice all of a sudden, but
  the Commissioner did not notice it; he was too busy pulling on a wool-lined
  jacket to ward off the evening chill.</p>

  <p>"Well, risaldar&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"I think that I could teach the son of Cunnigan-bahadur to be worth his
  salt."</p>

  <p>"If you'll teach him to be properly respectful to his betters I'll be
  grateful to you, Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>"Then, sahib, I shall have certain license allowed me in the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Do anything you like, in reason, risaldar! Only keep the pup from cutting
  his eye-teeth on his seniors' convenience, that's all!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga wasted no time after that on talking, nor did he wait to
  specify the nature of the latitude he would expect to be allowed him; he knew
  better. And he knew now that the one chance that he sought had been given
  him.</p>

  <p>Like all observant natives, he was perfectly aware that the British
  weakness mostly lay in the age of the senior officers and the slowness of
  promotion. There were majors of over fifty years of age, and if a man were a
  general at seventy he was considered fortunate and young. The jealousy with
  which younger men were regarded would have been humorous had it not come
  already so near to plunging India into anarchy.</p>

  <p>He did not even trouble to overlook the garrison. He took his leave, and
  rode away the long two-day ride to his own place, where a sadly attenuated
  rent-roll and a very sadly thinned-down company of servants waited his
  coming. There, through fourteen hurried, excited days, he made certain
  arrangements about the disposition of his affairs during an even longer
  absence; he made certain sales&mdash;pledged the rent of fifty acres for ten
  years, in return for an advance&mdash;and on the fifteenth day rode
  southward, at the head of a five-man escort that, for quality, was worthy of
  a prince.</p>

  <p>A little less than three months later he arrived at Bombay, and by dint of
  much hard bargaining and economy fitted out himself and his escort, so that
  each man looked as though he were the owner of an escort of his own. Then,
  fretful at every added day that strained his fast-diminishing resources, he
  settled down to wait until the ship should come that brought young
  Cunningham.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Lies home beneath a sickly sun,<br>
  Where humbleness was taught me?<br>
  Or here, where spurs my father won<br>
  On bended knee are brought me?</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE landed, together with about a dozen other newly gazetted
  subalterns and civil officers, cramped, storm-tossed, snubbed, and then
  disgorged from a sailing-ship into a port that made no secret of its absolute
  contempt for new arrivals.</p>

  <p>There were liners of a kind on the Red Sea route, and the only seniors who
  chose the long passage round the Cape were men returning after sick-leave
  &mdash;none too sweet-tempered individuals, and none too prone to give the
  young idea a good conceit of himself. He and the other youngsters landed with
  a crushed-in notion that India would treat them very cavalierly before she
  took them to herself. And all, save Cunningham, were right.</p>

  <p>The other men, all homesick and lonely and bewildered, were met by
  bankers' agents, or, in cases, only by a hotel servant armed with a letter of
  instructions. Here and there a bored, tired-eyed European had found time, for
  somebody-or-other's sake, to pounce on a new arrival and bear him away to
  breakfast and a tawdry imitation of the real hospitality of northern India;
  but for the most part the beardless boys lounged in the red-hot customs shed
  (where they were to be mulcted for the privilege of serving their country)
  and envied young Cunningham.</p>

  <p>He&mdash;as pale as they, as unexpectant as they were of anything
  approaching welcome&mdash;was first amazed, then suspicious, then pleased,
  then proud, in turn. The different emotions followed one another across his
  clean-lined face as plainly as a dawn vista changes; then, as the dawn leaves
  a landscape finally, true and what it is for all to see, true dignity was
  left and the look of a man who stands in armour.</p>

  <p>"His father's son!" growled Mohammed Gunga; and the big, black-bearded
  warriors who stood behind him echoed, "Ay!"</p>

  <p>But for four or five inches of straight stature, and a foot, perhaps, of
  chest-girth, he was a second edition of the Cunnigan-bahadur who had raised
  and led a regiment and licked peace into a warring countryside; and though he
  was that much bigger than his father had been, they dubbed him "Chota"
  Cunnigan on the instant. And that means "Little Cunningham."</p>

  <p>He had yet to learn that a Rajput, be he poorest of the poor, admits no
  superior on earth. He did not know yet that these men had come, at one man's
  private cost, all down the length of India to meet him. Nobody had told him
  that the feudal spirit dies harder in northern Hindustan than it ever did in
  England, or that the Rajput clans cohere more tightly than the Scots. The
  Rajput belief that honest service&mdash;unselfishly given&mdash;is the
  greatest gift that any man may bring&mdash;that one who has received what he
  considers favors will serve the giver's son&mdash;was an unknown creed to him
  as yet.</p>

  <p>But he stood and looked those six men in the eye, and liked them. And
  they, before they had as much as heard him speak, knew him for a soldier and
  loved him as he stood.</p>

  <p>They hung sickly scented garlands round his neck, and kissed his hand in
  turn, and spoke to him thereafter as man to man. They had found their goal
  worth while, and they bore him off to his hotel in clattering glee, riding
  before him as men who have no doubt of the saber that they pay themselves. No
  other of the homesick subalterns drove away with a six-man escort to clear
  the way and scatter sparks!</p>

  <p>They careered round through the narrow gate of the hotel courtyard as
  though a Viceroy at least were in the trap behind them; and Mohammed Gunga
  &mdash;six medaled, strapping feet of him&mdash;dismounted and held out an
  arm for him to take when he alighted. The hotel people understood at once
  that Somebody from Somewhere had arrived.</p>

  <p>Young Cunningham had never yet been somebody. The men who give their lives
  for India are nothing much at home, and their sons are even less. Scarcely
  even at school, when they had made him captain of the team, had he felt the
  feel of homage and the subtle flattery that undermines a bad man's character;
  at schools in England they confer honors but take simultaneous precautions.
  He was green to the dangerous influence of feudal loyalty, but he quitted
  himself well, with reserve and dignity.</p>

  <p>"He is good! He will do!" swore Mohammed Gunga fiercely, for the other
  emotions are meant for women only.</p>

  <p>"He is better than the best!"</p>

  <p>"We will make a man of this one!"</p>

  <p>"Did you mark how he handed me his purse to defray expenses?" asked a
  black-bearded soldier of the five.</p>

  <p>"He is a man who knows by instinct!" said Mohammed Gunga. "See to it that
  thy accounting is correct, and overpay no man!"</p>

  <p>Deep-throated as a bull, erect as a lance, and pleased as a little child,
  Mohammed Gunga came to him alone that evening to talk, and to hear him talk,
  and to tell him of the plans that had been made.</p>

  <p>"Thy father gave me this," he told him, producing a gold watch and chain
  of the hundred-guinea kind that nowadays are only found among the heirlooms.
  Young Cunningham looked at it, and recognized the heavy old-gold case that he
  had been allowed to "blow open" when a little boy. On the outside, deep-
  chiseled in the gold, was his father's crest, and on the inside a portrait of
  his mother.</p>

  <p>"Thy father died in these two arms, bahadur! Thy father said: 'Look after
  him, Mohammed Gunga, when the time is ripe for him to be a soldier.' And I
  said: 'Ha, huzoor!'* So! Then here is India!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>huzoor</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a title of respect; sir.
  See <i><a href=

bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:184.hobson">The
  Hobson Jobson Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>He waved one hand grandiloquently, as though he were presenting the throne
  of India to his protégé!</p>

  <p>"Here, sahib, is a servant&mdash;blood of my own blood."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, and a man who looked like the big, black-ended
  spirit of Aladdin's lamp stood silent, instant, in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"He speaks no English, but he may help to teach thee the Rajput tongue,
  and he will serve thee well&mdash;on my saber. His throat shall answer for
  it! Feed him and clothe him, sahib, but pay him very little&mdash;to serve
  well is sufficient recompense."</p>

  <p>Young Cunningham gave his keys at once to the silent servant, as a tacit
  sign that from that moment he was trusted utterly; and Mohammed Gunga nodded
  grim approval.</p>

  <p>"Thy father saw fit to bequeath me much in the hour when death came on
  him, sahib. I am no boaster, as he knew. Remember, then, to tell me if I fail
  at any time in what is due. I am at thy service!"</p>

  <p>Tact was inborn in Cunningham, as it had been in his father. He realized
  that he ought at once to show his appreciation of the high plane of the
  service offered.</p>

  <p>"There is one way in which you could help me almost at once, Mohammed
  Gunga," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Command me, sahib."</p>

  <p>"I need your advice&mdash;the advice of a man who really knows. I need
  horses, and&mdash;at first at least&mdash;I would rather trust your judgment
  than my own. Will you help me buy them?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput's eyes blazed pleasure. On war, and wine, and women, and a
  horse are the four points to ask a man's advice and win his approval by the
  asking.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib; why buy horses here? These Bombay traders have only crows'
  meat to sell to the ill-advised. I have horses, and spare horses for the
  journey; and in Rajputana I have horses waiting for thee&mdash;seven, all
  told&mdash;sufficient for a young officer. Six of them are
  country-bred-sand-weaned&mdash;a little wild perhaps, but strong, and up to
  thy weight. The seventh is a mare, got by thy father's stallion Aga Khan (him
  that made more than a hundred miles within a day under a fifteen-stone
  burden, with neither food nor water, and survived!). A good mare, sahib
  &mdash;indeed a mare of mares&mdash;fit for thy father's son. That mare I
  give thee. It is little, sahib, but my best; I am a poor man. The other six I
  bought&mdash;there is the account. I bought them cheaply, paying less than
  half the price demanded in each case&mdash;but I had to borrow and must pay
  back."</p>

  <p>Young Cunningham was hard put to it to keep his voice steady as he
  answered. This man was a stranger to him. He had a hazy recollection of a
  dozen or more bearded giants who formed a moving background to his dreams of
  infancy, and he had expected some sort of welcome from one or two perhaps, of
  his father's men when he reached the north. But to have men borrow money that
  they might serve him, and have horses ready for him, and to be met like this
  at the gate of India by a man who admitted he was poor, was a little more
  than his self-control had been trained as yet to stand.</p>

  <p>"I won't waste words, Mohammed Gunga," he said, half-choking. "I'll
  &mdash;er&mdash;I'll try to prove how I feel about it."</p>

  <p>"Ha! How said I? Thy father's son, I said! He, too, was no believer in
  much promising! I was his servant, and will serve him still by serving thee.
  The saber is mine, sahib, and the advantage shall be where thy father wished
  it."</p>

  <p>"My father would never have had me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, forgive the interruption, but a mistake is better checked. Thy
  father would have flung thee ungrudged, into a hell of bayonets, me, too, and
  would have followed after, if by so doing he could have served the cause he
  held in trust. He bred thee, fed thee, and sent thee overseas to grow, that
  in the end India might gain! Thou and I are but servants of the peace, as he
  was. If I serve thee, and thou the Raj&mdash;though the two of us were weaned
  on the milk of war and get our bread by war&mdash;we will none the less serve
  peace! Aie! For what is saber if a soldier lets it rust? Of what use is
  service, mouthed and ready, but ungiven? It is good, Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur,
  that thou art come at last!"</p>

  <p>He saluted and backed out through the swinging door. He had come in his
  uniform of risaldar of the elder Cunningham's now disbanded regiment, so he
  had not removed his boots as another native&mdash;and he himself if in
  mufti&mdash;would have done. Young Cunningham heard him go swaggering and
  clanking and spur-jingling down the corridor as though he had half a troop of
  horse behind him and wanted Asia to know it!</p>

  <p>It was something of a brave beginning that, for a twenty-one-year-old!
  Something likely&mdash;and expressly calculated by Mohammed Gunga&mdash; to
  bring the real man to the surface. He had been no Cunningham unless his sense
  of duty had been very near the surface&mdash;no Englishman, had he not been
  proud that men of a foreign, conquered race should think him worthy of all
  that honor; and no man at all if his eye had been quite dry when the veteran
  light-horseman swaggered out at last and left him to his own reflections.</p>

  <p>He had not been human if he had not felt a little homesick still, although
  home to him had been a place where a man stayed with distant relatives
  between the intervals of school. He felt lonely, in spite of his reception
  &mdash;a little like a baby on the edge of all things new and wonderful. He
  would have been no European if he had not felt the heat, the hotel was like a
  vapor-bath.</p>

  <p>But the leaping red blood of youth ran strong in him. He had imagination.
  He could dream. The good things he was tasting were a presage only of the
  better things to come, and that is a wholesome point of view. He was proud
  &mdash;as who would not be?&mdash;to step straight into the tracks of such a
  father; and with that thought came another&mdash;just as good for him, and
  for India, that made him feel as though he were a robber yet, a thief in
  another's cornfield, gathering what he did not sow. It came over him in a
  flood that he must pay the price of all this homage.</p>

  <p>Some men pay in advance, some at the time, and some pay afterwards. All
  men, he knew, must pay. It would be his task soon to satisfy these
  gentle-men, who took him at his face value, by proving to them that they had
  made no very great mistake. The thought thrilled him instead of frightening
  &mdash;brought out every generous instinct that he had and made him thank the
  God of All Good Soldiers that at least he would have a chance to die in the
  attempt. There was nothing much the matter with young Cunningham.</p>

  <p class="poem">I take no man at rumor's price,<br>
  Nor as the gossips cry him.<br>
  A son may ride, and stride, and stand;<br>
  His father's eye&mdash;his father's hand&mdash;<br>
  His father's tongue may give command;<br>
  But ere I trust I'll try him!</p><br>

  <p class="first">BUT before young Cunningham was called upon to pay even a
  portion of the price of fealty there was more of the receiving of it still in
  store for him, and he found himself very hard put to it, indeed, to keep
  overboiling spirits from becoming exultation of the type that nauseates.</p>

  <p>None of the other subalterns had influence, nor had they hereditary
  anchors in the far Northwest that would be likely to draw them on to active
  service early in their career. They had already been made to surrender their
  boyhood dreams of quick promotion; now, standing in little groups and asking
  hesitating questions, they discovered that their destination&mdash;Fort
  William&mdash;was about the least desirable of all the awful holes in
  India.</p>

  <p>They were told that a subaltern was lucky who could mount one step of the
  promotion ladder in his first ten years; that a major at fifty, a colonel at
  sixty, and a general at seventy were quite the usual thing. And they realized
  that the pay they would receive would be a mere beggar's pittance in a
  neighborhood so expensive as Calcutta, and that their little private means
  would be eaten up by the mere, necessities of life. They showed their chagrin
  and it was not very easy for young Cunningham, watching Mohammed Gunga's
  lordly preparations for the long up-country journey, to strike just the right
  attitude of pleasure at the prospect without seeming to flaunt his better
  fortune.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga interlarded his hoarse orders to the mule-drivers with
  descriptions in stateliest English, thrown out at random to the world at
  large, of the glories of the manlier north&mdash;of the plains, where a man
  might gallop while a horse could last, and of the mountains up beyond the
  plains. He sniffed at the fetid Bombay reek, and spoke of the clean air
  sweeping from the snow-topped Himalayas, that put life and courage into the
  lungs of men who rode like centaurs! And the other subalterns looked wistful,
  eyeing the bullock-carts that would take their baggage by another route.</p>

  <p>Fully the half of what Mohammed Gunga said was due to pride of race and
  country. But the rest was all deliberately calculated to rouse the wicked
  envy of those who listened. He meant to make the son of "Pukka"* Cunnigan
  feel, before he reached his heritage, that he was going up to something worth
  his while. To quote his own north-country metaphor, he meant to "make the
  colt come up the bit." He meant that "Chota" Cunnigan should have a proper
  sense of his own importance, and should chafe at restraint, to the end that
  when his chance did come to prove himself he would jump at it. Envy, he
  calculated&mdash;the unrighteous envy of men less fortunately placed
  &mdash;would make a good beginning. And it did, though hardly in the way he
  calculated.</p>

  <p>Young Cunningham, tight-lipped to keep himself from grinning like a child,
  determined to prove himself worthy of the better fortune; and Mohammed Gunga
  would have cursed into his black beard in disgust had he known of the private
  resolutions being formed to obey orders to the letter and obtain the good
  will of his seniors. The one thing that the grim old Rajput wished for his
  protégé was jealousy! He wanted him so well hated by the "nabobs"* who had
  grown crusty and incompetent in high command that life for him in any
  northern garrison would be impossible.</p>

  <p>Throughout the two months' journey to the north Mohammed Gunga never left
  a stone unturned to make Cunningham believe himself much more than ordinary
  clay. All along the trunk road, that trails by many thousand towns and
  listens to a hundred languages, whatever good there was was Cunningham's.

  kansamah&dagger; least desired to kill, whoever were the stoutest

  <p>Of evenings, while they rested, but before the sun went down, the old
  risaldar would come with his naked saber and defy "Chota" Cunnigan to try to
  touch him. For five long weeks he tried each evening, the Rajput never doing
  anything but parry,&mdash;changing his saber often to the other hand and
  grinning at the schoolboy swordsmanship&mdash;until one evening, at the end
  of a more than usually hard-fought bout, the youngster pricked him, lunged,
  and missed slitting his jugular by the merest fraction of an inch.</p>

  <p>"Ho!" laughed Mohammed Gunga later, as he sluiced out the cut while his
  own adherents stood near by and chaffed him. "The cub cuts his teeth, then!
  Soon it will be time to try his pluck."</p>

  <p>"Be gentle with him, risaldar-sahib; a good cub dies as easily as a poor
  one, until he knows the way."</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me! I will show him the way, and we will see what we will
  see. If he is to disgrace his father's memory and us, he shall do it where
  there are few to see and none to talk of it. When Alwa and the others ask me,
  as they will ask, 'Is he a man?' I will give them a true answer! I think he
  is a man, but I need to test him in all ways possible before I pledge my word
  on it."</p>

  <p>But after that little accident the old risaldar had sword-sticks fashioned
  at a village near the road, and ran no more risks of being killed by the
  stripling he would teach; and before many more days of the road had ribboned
  out, young Cunningham&mdash;bareback or from the saddle&mdash;could beat him
  to the ground, and could hold his own on foot afterwards with either
  hand.</p>

  <p>"The hand and eye are good!" said Mohammed Gunga. "It is time now for
  another test."</p>

  <p>So he made a plausible excuse about the horses, and they halted for four
  days at a roadside dak-bungalow about a mile from where a foul-mouthed fakir
  sat and took tribute at a crossroads. It was a strangely chosen place to rest
  at.</p>

  <p>Deep down in a hollow, where the trunk road took advantage of a winding
  gorge between the hills&mdash;screened on nearly all sides by green jungle
  whose brown edges wilted in the heat which the inner steam defied&mdash;
  stuffy, smelly, comfortless, it stood like a last left rear-guard of a white-
  man's city, swamped by the deathless, ceaselessly advancing tide of green. It
  was tucked between mammoth trees that had been left there when the space for
  it was cleared a hundred years before, and that now stood like grim giant
  guardians with arms out-stretched to hold the verdure back.</p>

  <p>The little tribe of camp-followers chased at least a dozen snakes out of
  corners, and slew them in the open, as a preliminary to further
  investigation. There were kas-kas* mats on the foursquare floors, and each of
  these, when lifted, disclosed a swarm of scorpions that had to be
  exterminated before a man dared move his possessions in. The once white
  calico ceilings moved suggestively where rats and snakes chased one another,
  or else hunted some third species of vermin; and there was a smell and a
  many-voiced weird whispering that hinted at corruption and war to the death
  behind skirting boards and underneath the floor.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>kas-kas, khas-khas, cus-cus</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a

  <p>It had evidently not been occupied for many years; the kansamah looked
  like a grey-bearded skeleton compressed within a tightened shroud of
  parchment skin that shone where a coffin or a tomb had touched it. He seemed
  to have forgotten what the bungalow was for, or that a sahib needed things to
  eat, until the ex-risaldar enlightened him, and then he complained
  wheezily.</p>

  <p>The stables&mdash;rather the patch-and-hole-covered desolation that once
  had been stables&mdash;were altogether too snake-defiled and smelly to be
  worth repairing; the string of horses was quartered cleanly and snugly under
  tents, and Mohammed Gunga went to enormous trouble in arranging a ring of
  watch-fires at even distances.</p>

  <p>"Are there thieves here, then?" asked Cunningham, and the Rajput nodded
  but said nothing. He seemed satisfied, though, that the man he had brought
  safely thus far at so much trouble would be well enough housed in the creaky
  wreck of the bungalow, and he took no precautions of any kind as to guarding
  its approaches.</p>

  <p>Cunningham watched the preparations for his supper with ill-concealed
  disgust&mdash;saw the customary chase of a rubber-muscled chicken, heard its
  death gurgles, saw the guts removed, to make sure that the kansamah did not
  cook it with that part of its anatomy intact, as he surely would do unless
  watched&mdash;and then strolled ahead a little way along the road.</p>

  <p>The fakir was squatting in the distance, on a big white stone, and in the
  quiet of the gloaming Cunningham could hear his coarse, lewd voice tossing
  crumbs of abuse and mockery to the seven or eight villagers who squatted near
  him&mdash;half-amused, half-frightened, and altogether credulous.</p>

  <p>Even as he drew nearer Cunningham could not understand a word of what the
  fakir said, but the pantomime was obvious. His was the voice and the manner
  of the professional beggar who has no more need to whine but still would
  ingratiate. It was the bullying, brazen swagger and the voice that traffics
  in filth and impudence instead of wit; and, in payment for his evening
  bellyful he was pouring out abuse of Cunningham that grew viler and yet viler
  as Cunningham came nearer and the fakir realized that his subject could not
  understand a word of it.</p>

  <p>The villagers looked leery and eyed Cunningham sideways at each fresh
  sally. The fakir grew bolder, until one of his listeners smothered an open
  laugh in both hands and rolled over sideways. Cunningham came closer yet,
  half-enamored of the weird scene, half-curious to discover what the stone
  could be on which the fakir sat.</p>

  <p>The fakir grew nervous. Perhaps, after all, this was one of those
  hatefully clever sahibs who know enough to pretend they do not know! The
  abuse and vile innuendo changed to more obsequious, less obviously filthy
  references to other things than Cunningham's religion, likes, and pedigree,
  and the little crowd of men who had tacitly encouraged him before got ready
  now to stand at a distance and take sides against him should the white man
  turn out to have understood.</p>

  <p>But Cunningham happened to catch sight of a cloud of parakeets that swept
  in a screaming ellipse for a better branch to nest in and added the one touch
  of gorgeous color needed to make the whole scene utterly unearthly and unlike
  anything he had ever dreamed of, or had seen in pictures, or had had
  described to him. He stood at gaze&mdash;forgetful of the stone that had
  attracted him and of the fakir&mdash;spellbound by the wonder-blend of hues
  branch-backed, and framed in gloom as the birds' scream was framed in
  silence.</p>

  <p>And, seeing him at gaze, the fakir recovered confidence and jeered new
  ribaldry, until some one suddenly shot out from behind Cunningham, and before
  he had recovered from his surprise he saw the fakir sprawling on his back,
  howling for mercy, while Mohammed Gunga beat the blood out of him with a
  whalebone riding-whip.</p>

  <p>The sun went down with Indian suddenness and shut off the scene of
  upraised lash and squirming, naked, ash-smeared devil, as a magic-lantern
  picture; disappears. Only the creature's screams reverberated through the
  jungle, like a belated echo to the restless parakeets.</p>

  <p>"He will sleep less easily for a week or two!" hazarded Mohammed Gunga,
  stepping back toward Cunningham. In the sudden darkness the white breeches
  showed and the whites of his eyes, but little else; his voice growled like a
  rumble from the underworld.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it, risaldar? What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"It was enough, bahadur, that he sat on that stone; for that alone he had
  been beaten! What he said was but the babbling of priests. All priests are
  alike. They have a common jargon&mdash;a common disrespect for what they dare
  not openly defy. These temple rats of fakirs mimic them. That is all, sahib.
  A whipping meets the case."</p>

  <p>"But the stone? Why shouldn't he sit on it?"</p>

  <p>"Wait one minute, sahib, and then see." He formed his hands into a trumpet
  and bellowed through them in a high-pitched, nasal, ululating order to
  somebody behind:</p>

  <p>"Oh-h-h&mdash;Battee-lao!"</p>

  <p>The black, dark roadside echoed it and a dot of light leapt up as a man
  came running with what gradually grew into a lamp.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga seized the lamp, bent for a few seconds over the still
  sprawling fakir, whipped him again twice, cursed him and kicked him, until he
  got up and ran like a specter for the gloom beyond the trees. Then, with a
  rather stately sweep of the lamp, and a tremble in his voice that was
  probably intentional&mdash;designed to make Cunningham at least aware of the
  existence of emotion before he looked&mdash;he let the light fall on the slab
  on which the fakir had been squatting.</p>

  <p>"Look, Cunningham-sahib!"</p>

  <p>The youngster bent down above the slab and tried, in the fitful light, to
  make out what the markings were that ran almost from side to side, in curves,
  across the stone; but it was too dark&mdash;the light was too fitful; the
  marks themselves were too faint from the constant squatting of roadside
  wanderers.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga set the lamp down on the stone, and he and the attendant
  took little sticks, sharp-pointed, with which they began to dig hurriedly,
  scratching and scraping at what presently showed, even in that rising and
  falling light, as Roman lettering. Soon Cunningham himself began to lend a
  hand. He made out a date first, and he could feel it with his fingers before
  his eyes deciphered it. Gradually, letter by letter&mdash;word by word
  &mdash;he read it off, feeling a strange new thrill run through him, as each
  line followed, like a voice from the haunted past.</p>

  <h4>A.D. 1823. A.D.<br>
  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF<br>
  GENERAL ROBERT FRANCIS CUNNINGHAM<br>
  WHO DIED ON THIS SPOT<br>
  AETAT 81<br>
  FROM WOUNDS INFLICTED BY A TIGER</h4>

  <p>There was no sound audible except the purring of the lamp flame and the
  heavy breathing of the three as Cunningham gazed down at the very crudely
  carved, stained, often-desecrated slab below which lay the first of the
  Anglo-Indian Cunninghams.</p>

  <p>This man&mdash;these crumbled bones that lay under a forgotten piece of
  rock&mdash;had made all of their share of history. They had begotten "Pukka"
  Cunningham, who had hacked the name deeper yet in the criss-crossed annals of
  a land of war. It was strange&mdash;it was queer&mdash;uncanny &mdash;for the
  third of the Cunninghams to be sitting on the stone. It was unexpected, yet
  it seemed to have a place in the scheme of things, for he caught himself
  searching his memory backward.</p>

  <p>He received an impression that something was expected of him. He knew, by
  instinct and reasoning he could not have explained, that neither Mohammed
  Gunga nor the other men would say a word until he spoke. They were waiting
  &mdash;he knew they were&mdash;for a word, or a sign, or an order (he did not
  know which), on which would hang the future of all three of them.</p>

  <p>Yet there was no hurry&mdash;no earthly hurry. He felt sure of it. In the
  silence and the blackness&mdash;in the tense, steamy atmosphere of
  expectancy&mdash;he felt perfectly at ease, although he knew, too, that there
  was superstition to be reckoned with&mdash;and that is something which a
  white man finds hard to weigh and cope with, as a rule.</p>

  <p>The sweat ran down his face in little streams a the prickly heat began to
  move across his skin, like a fiery-footed centipede beneath his undershirt,
  but he noticed, neither. He began to be unconscious anything except the
  knowledge that the bones of his grandsire lay underneath him and that
  Mohammed Gunga waited for the word that would fit into the scheme and solve a
  problem.</p>

  <p>"Are there any tigers here now?" he asked presently, in a perfectly normal
  voice. He spoke as he had done when his servant asked him which suit he would
  wear.</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib! Many."</p>

  <p>"Man-eaters, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga and the other man exchanged quick glances, but Cunningham
  did not look up. He did not see the quick-flashed whites as their eyes met
  and looked down again.</p>

  <p>"There is one, sahib&mdash;so say the kansamah and the head man&mdash; a
  full-grown tiger, in his prime."</p>

  <p>"I will shoot him." Four words, said quietly&mdash;not "Do you think," or
  "I would like to," or "Perhaps." They were perfectly definite and without a
  trace of excitement; yet this man had never seen a tiger.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sahib." That, too, was spoken in a level voice, but Mohammed
  Gunga's eyes and the other man's met once again above his head.</p>

  <p>"We will stay here four days; by the third day there will be time enough
  to have brought an elephant and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will go on foot," said Cunningham, quite quietly. "Tomorrow, at dawn,
  risaldar-sahib. Will you be good enough to make arrangements? All we need to
  know is where he is and how to get there&mdash;will you attend to that?"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I wonder if my supper's ready."</p>

  <p>He turned and walked away, with a little salute-like movement of his hand
  that was reminiscent of his father. The two Rajputs watched him in heavy-
  breathing silence until the little group of lights, where the horse-tents
  faced the old dak-bungalow, swallowed him. Then:</p>

  <p>"He is good. He will do!" said the black-beard who had brought the
  lamp.</p>

  <p>"He is good. But many sahibs would have acted coolly, thus. There must be
  a greater test. There must be no doubt&mdash;no littlest doubt. Alwa and the
  others will ask me on my honor, and I will answer on my honor, yes or
  no."</p>

  <p>It was an hour before the two of them returned, and looked the horses over
  and strolled up to bid Cunningham good night; and in the meanwhile they had
  seen about the morrow's tiger, and another matter.</p>

  <p class="poem">What found ye, then? Why heated ye the pot?<br>
  What useful metal down the channels ran?<br>
  Gold? Steel for making weapons? Iron? What?<br>
  Nay. Out from the fire we kindled strode a man!</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEY set the legs of Cunningham's string-woven bed into pans
  of water, to keep the scorpions and ants and snakes at bay, and then left him
  in pitch darkness to his own devices, with a parting admonition to keep his
  slippers on for the floor, in the dark, would be the prowling-place of
  venomed death.</p>

  <p>It was he who set the lamp on the little table by his bedside, for his
  servant&mdash;for the first time on that journey&mdash;was not at hand to
  execute his thoughts almost before he had spoken them. Mohammed Gunga had
  explained that the man was sick; and that seemed strange, for he had been
  well enough, and more than usually efficient, but an hour before.</p>

  <p>But there were stranger things and far more irritating ones to interfere
  with the peaceful passage of the night. There were sounds that were
  unaccountable; there was the memory of the wayside tombstone and the train of
  thought that it engendered. Added to the hell-hot, baking stuffiness that
  radiated from the walls, there came the squeaking of a punkah* rope pulled
  out of time&mdash;the piece of piping in the mud-brick wall through which the
  rope passed had become clogged and rusted, and the villager pressed into
  service had forgotten how to pull; he jerked at the cord between nods as the
  heat of the veranda and the unaccustomed night duty combined to make him
  sleepy.</p>

  <p>Soon the squeaking became intolerable, and Cunningham swore at him&mdash;
  in English, because he spoke little of any native language yet, and had not
  the least idea in any case what the punkah-wallah's* tongue might be. For a
  while after that the pulling was more even; he lay on one elbow, letting the
  swinging mat fan just miss his ear, and examining his rifle and pistols for
  lack of anything better to keep him from going mad. Then, suddenly, the
  pulling ceased altogether. Silence and hell heat shut down on him like a
  coffin lid. Even the lamp flame close beside him seemed to grow dim; the
  weight of black night that was suffocating him seemed to crush light out of
  the flame as well.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>wallah</i> (Hindi)&mdash;1) one employed in a
  particular occupation or activity: a kitchen wallah; a rickshaw wallah; 2) an
  important person in a particular field or organization. <i><a href=

  <p>No living mortal could endure that, he imagined. He swore aloud, but there
  was no answer, so he got up, after crashing his rifle-butt down on the floor
  to scare away anything that crawled. For a moment he stood, undecided whether
  to take the lamp or rifle with him&mdash;then decided on the rifle, for the
  lamp might blow out in some unexpected night gust, whereas if he left it
  where it was it would go on burning and show him the way back to bed again.
  Besides, he was too unaccustomed to the joy of owning the last new thing in
  sporting rifles to hesitate for long about what to keep within his grasp.</p>

  <p>Through the open door he could see nothing but pitch-blackness,
  unpunctuated even by a single star. There were no lights where the tents
  stood, so he judged that even the accustomed natives had found the added heat
  of Mohammed Gunga's watch-fires intolerable and had raked them out; but from
  where he imagined that the village must be came the dum-tu-dum-tu-dum of
  tom-toms, like fever blood pulsating in the veins of devils of the night.</p>

  <p>The punkah-wallah slept. He could just make out the man's blurred shape
  &mdash;a shadow in the shadows&mdash;dog-curled, with the punkah rope looped
  round his foot. He kicked him gently, and the man stirred, but fell asleep
  again. He kicked him harder. The man sat up and stared, terrified; the whites
  of his eyes were distinctly visible. He seemed to have forgotten why he was
  there, and to imagine that he saw a ghost.</p>

  <p>Cunningham spoke to him&mdash;he first words that came into his head.</p>

  <p>"Go on pulling," he said in English, quite kindly.</p>

  <p>But if he had loosed his rifle off, the effect could not have been more
  instantaneous. Clutching his twisted rag of a turban in one hand, and kicking
  his leg free, he ran for it&mdash;leaped the veranda rail, and vanished
  &mdash;a night shadow, swallowed by its mother night.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" called Cunningham. "Iderao! I won't hurt you!"</p>

  <p>But there was no answer, save the tom-toms' thunder, swelling now into a
  devil's chorus-coming nearer. It seemed to be coming from the forest, but he
  reasoned that it could not be; it must be some village marriage feast, or
  perhaps an orgy; he had paid out what would seem to the villagers a lot of
  money, and it might be that they were celebrating the occasion. It was
  strange, though, that he could see no lights where the village ought to
  be.</p>

  <p>For a moment he had a half-formed intention to shout for Mohammed Gunga;
  but he checked that, reasoning that the Rajput might think he was afraid.
  Then his eye caught sight of something blacker than the shadows&mdash;
  something long and thin and creepy that moved, and he remembered that bed,
  where the pans of water would protect him, was the only safe place.</p>

  <p>So he returned into the hot, black silence where the tiny lamp-flame
  guttered and threw shadows. He wondered why it guttered. It seemed to be
  actually short of air. There were four rooms, he remembered, to the bungalow,
  all connected and each opening outward by a door that faced one of the four
  sides; he wondered whether the outer doors were opened to admit a draught,
  and started to investigate.</p>

  <p>Two of them were shut tight, and he could not kick them open; the dried-
  out teak and the heavy iron bolts held as though they had been built to
  resist a siege; the noise that he made as he rattled at them frightened a
  swarm of unseen things&mdash;unguessed-at shapes&mdash;that scurried away. He
  thought he could see beady little eyes that looked and disappeared and
  circled round and stopped to look again. He could hear creepy movements in
  the stillness. It seemed better to leave those doors alone.</p>

  <p>One other door, which faced that of his own room, was open wide, and he
  could feel the forest through it; there was nothing to be seen, but the
  stillness moved. The velvet blackness was deeper by a shade, and the heat,
  uprising to get even with the sky, bore up a stench with it. There was no
  draught, no movement except upward. Earth was panting-in time, it seemed, to
  the hellish thunder of the tom-toms.</p>

  <p>He went back and lay on the bed again, leaning the rifle against the cot-
  frame, and trying by sheer will-power to prevent the blood from bursting his
  veins. He realized before long that he was parched with thirst, and reached
  out for the water-jar that stood beside the lamp; but as he started to drink
  he realized that a crawling evil was swimming round and round in rings in the
  water. In a fit of horror he threw the thing away and smashed it into a dozen
  fragments in a corner. He saw a dozen rats, at least, scamper to drink before
  the water could evaporate or filter through the floor; and when they were
  gone there was no half-drowned crawling thing either. They had eaten it.</p>

  <p>He clutched his rifle to him. The barrel was hot, but the feel of it gave
  him a sense of companionship. And then, as he lay back on the bed again, the
  lamp went out. He groped for it and shook it. There was no oil.</p>

  <p>Now, what had been hot horror turned to fear that passed all understanding
  &mdash;to the hate that does not reason&mdash;to the cold sweat breaking on
  the roasted skin. Where the four walls had been there was blackness of
  immeasurable space. He could hear the thousand-footed cannibals of night
  creep nearer&mdash;driven in toward him by the dinning of the tom-toms. He
  felt that his bed was up above a scrambling swarm of black-legged things that
  fought.</p>

  <p>He had no idea how long he lay stock-still, for fear of calling attention
  to himself, and hated his servant and Mohammed Gunga and all India. Once
  &mdash;twice&mdash;he thought he heard another sound, almost like the
  footfall of a man on the veranda near him. Once he thought that a man
  breathed within ten paces of him, and for a moment there was a distinct
  sensation of not being alone. He hoped it was true; he could deal with an
  assassin. That would be something tangible to hate and hit. Manhood came to
  his assistance&mdash;the spirit of the soldier that will bow to nothing that
  has shape; but it died away again as the creeping silence once more shut down
  on him.</p>

  <p>And then the thunder of the tom-toms ceased. Then even the venomed
  crawlers that he knew were near him faded into nothing that really mattered,
  compared to the greater, stealthy horror that he knew was coming, born of the
  shuddersome, shut silence that ensued. There was neither air nor view&mdash;
  no sense of time or space&mdash;nothing but the coal-black pit of terror
  yawning&mdash;cold sweat in the heat, and a footfall&mdash;an undoubted
  footfall&mdash;followed by another one, too heavy for a man's.</p>

  <p>Where heavy feet were there was something tangible. His veins tingled and
  the cold sweat dried. Excitement began to reawaken all his soldier senses,
  and the wish to challenge seized him&mdash;the soldierly intent to warn the
  unaware, which is the actual opposite of cowardice.</p>

  <p>"Halt! Who comes there?"</p>

  <p>He lipped the words, but his dry throat would not voice them. Before he
  could clear his throat or wet his lips his eye caught something lighter than
  the night&mdash;two things&mdash;ten&mdash;twelve paces off&mdash;two things
  that glowed or sheened as though there were light inside them&mdash; too big
  and too far apart to be owl's eyes, but singularly like them. They moved, a
  little sideways and toward him; and again he heard the heavy, stealthy
  footfall.</p>

  <p>They stayed still then for what may have been a minute, and another sense
  &mdash;smell&mdash;warned him and stirred up the man in him. He had never
  smelled it in his life; it must have been instinct that assured him of an
  enemy behind the strange, unpleasant, rather musky reek that filled the room.
  His right hand brought the rifle to his shoulder without sound, and almost
  without conscious effort on his part.</p>

  <p>He forgot the heat now and the silence and discomfort. He lay still on his
  side, squinting down the rifle barrel at a spot he judged was midway between
  a pair of eyes that glowed, and wondering where his foresight might be. It
  struck him all at once that it was quite impossible to see the foresight
  &mdash;that he must actually touch what he would hit if he would be at all
  sure of hitting it. He remembered, too, in that instant&mdash;as a born
  soldier does remember things&mdash;that in the dark an attacking enemy is
  probably more frightened than his foe. His father had told it him when he was
  a little lad afraid of bogies; he in turn had told it to the other boys at
  school, and they had passed it on until in that school it had become rule
  number one of school-boy lore&mdash;just as rule number two in all schools
  where the sons of soldiers go is "Take the fight to him."</p>

  <p>He leaped from the bed, with his rifle out in front of him&mdash;white-
  nightshirted and unexpected&mdash;sudden enough to scare the wits out of
  anything that had them. He was met by a snarl. The two eyes narrowed, and
  then blazed. They lowered, as though their owner gathered up his weight to
  spring. He fired between them. The flash and the smoke blinded him; the burst
  of the discharge within four echoing walls deadened his cars, and he was
  aware of nothing but a voice beside him that said quietly: "Well done,
  bahadur! Thou art thy father's son!"</p>

  <p>He dropped his rifle butt to the floor, and some one struck a light. Even
  then it was thirty seconds before his strained eyes grew accustomed to the
  flare and he could see the tiger at his feet, less than a yard away&mdash;
  dead, bleeding, wide-eyed, obviously taken by surprise and shot as he
  prepared to spring. Beside him, within a yard, Mohammed Gunga stood, with a
  drawn saber in his right hand and a pistol in his left, and there were three
  other men standing like statues by the walls.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been here?" demanded Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"A half-hour, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"In case of need, sahib. That tiger killed a woman yesterday at dawn and
  was driven off his kill; he was not likely to be an easy mark for an untried
  hunter."</p>

  <p>"Why did you enter without knocking?"</p>

  <p>The ex-risaldar said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I see that you have shoes on."</p>

  <p>"The scorpions, sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would you be pleased, Mohammed Gunga, if I entered your house with my hat
  on and without knocking or without permission?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be good enough to have that brute's carcass dragged out and skinned, and
  &mdash;ah&mdash;leave me to sleep, will you?"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga bowed, and growled an order; another man passed the order
  on, and the tom-tom thundering began again as a dozen villagers pattered in
  to take away the tiger.</p>

  <p>"Tell them, please," commanded Cunningham, "that that racket is to cease.
  I want to sleep."</p>

  <p>Again Mohammed Gunga bowed, without a smile or a tremor on his face; again
  a growled order was echoed and re-echoed through the dark. The drumming
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Is there oil in the bahadur's lamp?" asked Mohammed Gunga.</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"I will command that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble, thank you, risaldar-sahib. I sleep better in the
  dark. I'll be glad to see you after breakfast as usual&mdash;ah&mdash;
  without your shoes, unless you come in uniform. Good night."</p>

  <p>The Rajput signed to the others and withdrew with dignity. Cunningham
  reloaded his rifle in the dark and lay down. Within five minutes the swinging
  of the punkah and the squeaking of the rope resumed, but regularly this time;
  Mohammed Gunga had apparently unearthed a man who understood the business.
  Reaction, the intermittent coolth, as the mat fan swung above his face, the
  steady, evenly timed squeak and movement&mdash;not least, the calm of well-
  asserted dignity&mdash;all joined to have one way, and Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur
  slept, to dream of fire-eyed tigers dancing on tombstones laid on the roof of
  hell, and of a grandfather in full general's uniform, who said: "Well done,
  bahadur!"</p>

  <p>But outside, by a remade camp-fire, Mohammed Gunga sat and chuckled to
  himself, and every now and then grew eloquent to the bearded men who sat
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"Aie! Did you hear him reprimand me? By the beard of God's prophet, that
  is a man of men! So was his father! Now I will tell Alwa and the others that
  I bring a man to them! By the teeth of God and my own honor I will swear to
  it! His first tiger&mdash;he had never seen a tiger!&mdash;in the dark, and
  unexpected&mdash;caught by it, to all seeming, like a trapped man in a
  cage&mdash;no lamp&mdash;no help at hand, or so he thought until it was all
  over. And he ran at the tiger! And then, 'you come with your shoes on,
  Mohammed Gunga&mdash;why, forsooth?' Did you hear him? By the blood of Allah,
  we have a man to lead us!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Now, the gist of the thing is&mdash;Be silent. Be calm.<br>
  Be awake. Be on hand on the day.<br>
  Be instant to heed the first note of alarm.<br>
  And&mdash;precisely&mdash;exactly&mdash;Obey.</p><br>

  <p class="first">At Howrah, while Mohammed Gunga was employing each chance
  circumstance to test the pluck and decision and reliability of Cunningham at
  almost every resting-place along the Grand Trunk Road, the armed squire he
  had left behind with a little handful of gold mohurs and three horses was
  finding time heavy on his hands.</p>

  <p>Like his master, Ali Partab was a man of action, to whom the purlieus of a
  caravansary were well enough on rare occasions. He could ruffle it with the
  best of them; like any of his race, he could lounge with dignity and listen
  to the tales that hum wherever many horsemen congregate; and he was no mean
  raconteur&mdash;he had a tale or two to tell himself, of women and the chase
  and of the laugh that he, too, had flung in the teeth of fear when
  opportunity arose.</p>

  <p>But each new story of the paid tale-tellers, who squat and drone and reach
  a climax, and then pass the begging bowl before they finish it&mdash;each
  merrily related jest brought in by members of the constantly arriving trading
  parties&mdash;each neigh of his three chargers&mdash;every new phase of the
  kaleidoscopic life he watched stirred new ambition in him to be up, and away,
  and doing. Many a dozen times he had to remind himself that "there had been a
  trust imposed."</p>

  <p>He exercised the horses daily, riding each in turn until he was as lean
  and lithe and hard beneath the skin as they were. They were Mohammed Gunga's
  horses&mdash;he Mohammed Gunga's man; therefore, his honor was involved. He
  reasoned, when he took the trouble to, along the good clean feudal line that
  lays down clearly what service is: there is no honor, says that argument, in
  serving any one who is content with half a service, and the honor is the only
  thing that counts.</p>

  <p>As day succeeded ever sultrier, ever longer-drawn-out day&mdash;as each
  night came that saw him peg the horses out wherever what little breezes moved
  might fan them&mdash;as he sat among the courtyard groups and listened in the
  heavy heat, the fact grew more apparent to him that this trust of his was
  something after all which a man of worth might shoulder proudly. There was
  danger in it.</p>

  <p>The talk among the traders&mdash;darkly hinted, most of it, and couched in
  metaphor&mdash;was all of blood, and what would follow on the letting of it.
  Now and then a loud-mouthed boaster would throw caution to the winds and
  speak openly of a grim day coming for the British; he would be checked
  instantly by wiser men, but not before Ali Partab had heard enough to add to
  his private store of information.</p>

  <p>Priests came from a dozen cities to the eastward, all nominally after
  pilgrims for the sacred places, but all strangely indifferent to their quest.
  They preferred, it would seem, to sit in rings with chance-met ruffians
  &mdash;with believers and unbelievers alike&mdash;even with men of no caste
  at all&mdash;and talk of other things than pilgrimages.</p>

  <p>"Next year, one hundred years ago the English conquered India. Remember ye
  the prophecy? One hundred years they had! This, then, is the last year. Whom
  the gods would whelm they first deprive of reason; mark ye this! The
  cartridges they serve out to the sepoys now are smeared with the blended fat
  of cows and pigs. Knowing that we Hindus hold the cow a sacred beast, they do
  this sacrilege&mdash;and why? They would make us bite the cartridges and lose
  our caste. And why again? Because they would make us Christians! That is the
  truth! Else why are the Christian missionaries here in Howrah?"</p>

  <p>The listeners would nod while the little red fires glowed and purred above
  the pipes, and others not included in the circle strained forward through the
  dark to listen.</p>

  <p>"The gods get ready now! Are ye ready?"</p>

  <p>Elsewhere, a hajji*&mdash;green-turbaned from the pilgrimage to Mecca
  &mdash;would hold out to a throng of true believers.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>hajji</i>&mdash;a Moslem who has made a pilgramage
  to Mecca. <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/74/H0017400.html">The
  American Heritage Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the
  <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj">Hajj</a>]</p>

  <p>"Ay! Pig's fat on the cartridges! The new drill is that the sepoy bites
  the cartridge first, to spill a little powder and make priming. Which true
  believer wishes to defile himself with pig's fat? Why do they this? Why are
  the Christian missionaries here? Ask both riddles with one breath, for both
  two are one!"</p>

  <p>"Slay, then!"</p>

  <p>"Up now, and slay!"</p>

  <p>There would be an instant, eager restlessness, while Ali Partab would
  glance over to where the horses stood, and would wonder why the word that
  loosed him was so long in coming. The hajji would calm his listeners and tell
  them to get ready, but be still and await the sign.</p>

  <p>"There were to be one hundred years, ran the prophecy; but ninety-nine and
  a portion have yet run. Wait for the hour!"</p>

  <p>Then, for perhaps the hundredth time, Ali Partab would pretend that
  movement alone could save one or other of his horses from heat apoplexy. He
  would mount, and ride at a walking pace through the streets that seemed like
  a night view of a stricken battle-field, turn down by the palace wall, and
  then canter to the schoolhouse, where the hag&mdash;wiser than her mistress
  &mdash;would be sleeping in the open.</p>

  <p>"Thou! Mother of a murrain! Toothless one! Is there no word yet?"</p>

  <p>The hag would leer up through the heavy darkness&mdash;make certain that
  he had no lance with him with which to prod her in the ribs&mdash;scratch
  herself a time or two like a stray dog half awakened&mdash;and then leer
  knowingly.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou the gold mohurs?" she would demand.</p>

  <p>"Am I a sieve?"</p>

  <p>"Let my old eyes see them, sahib."</p>

  <p>He would take out two gold coins and hold them out in such a way that she
  could look at them without the opportunity to snatch.</p>

  <p>"There is no word yet," she would answer, when her eyes had feasted on
  them as long as his patience would allow.</p>

  <p>"Have they no fear then?"</p>

  <p>"None. Only madness!"</p>

  <p>"See that they bite thee not! Keep thy wits with thee, and be ready to
  bring me word in time, else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Patience, sahib! Show me the coins again&mdash;one little look&mdash;
  again once!"</p>

  <p>But Ali Partab would wheel and ride away, leaving her to mumble and gibber
  in the road and curl again on to her blanket in the blackest corner by the
  door.</p>

  <p>Once, on an expedition of that kind, he encountered Duncan McClean
  himself. The lean, tall Scotsman, grey-headed from the cares he had taken on
  himself, a little bowed from heat and hopelessness, but showing no least
  symptom of surrender in the kind, strong lines of a rugged face, stood, eyes
  upward, in the moonlight. The moon, at least, looked cool. It was at the
  full, like a disk of silver, and he seemed to drink in the beams that bathed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Does he worship it?" wondered Ali Partab, reining from an amble to a walk
  and watching half-reverently. The followers of Mohammed are most
  superstitious about the moon. The feeling that he had for this man of peace
  who could so gaze up at it was something very like respect, and, with the
  twenty-second sense that soldiers have, he knew, without a word spoken or a
  deed seen done, that this would be a wielder of cold steel to be reckoned
  should he ever slough the robes of peace and take it into his silvered head
  to fight. The Rajput, who respects decision above all other virtues, perhaps
  because it is the one that he most lacks, could sense firm, unshakable,
  quick-seized determination on the instant.</p>

  <p>Duncan McClean acknowledged the fierce-seeming stare with a salute, and
  Ali Partab dismounted instantly. He who holds a trust from such as Mohammed
  Gunga is polite in recognition of the trust. He leaned, then, against the
  horse's withers, wondering how far he ought to let politeness go and whether
  his honor bade him show contempt for the Christian's creed.</p>

  <p>"Is there any way, I wonder," asked the Scotsman, the clean-clipped
  suspicion of Scots dialect betraying itself even through the Hindustani that
  he used, "of getting letters through to some small station?"</p>

  <p>"I know not," said the Rajput.</p>

  <p>"You are a Mohammedan?" The Scotsman peered at him, adjusting his
  viewpoint to the moon's rays. "I see you are. A Rajput, too, I think."</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib."</p>

  <p>"There was a Rangar* here not very long ago." This man evidently knew the
  proper title to give a true believer of the proudest race there is. Ali
  Partab's heart began to go out to him&mdash;"an officer, I think, once of the
  Rajput Horse, who very kindly carried letters for me. Perhaps you know of
  some other gentleman of your race about to travel northward? He could earn,
  at least, gratitude."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Rangar, Ranghar</i>&mdash;a Moslem of Hindu
  extraction who (or whose ancestors) have converted to Islam. For more
  information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Rajputs">Muslim Rajputs</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"So-ho!" thought Ali Partab to himself. "I have known men of his race who
  would have offered money, to be spat on!&mdash;Not now, sahib," he answered
  aloud.</p>

  <p>"Mohammed Gunga was the officer's name. Do you know him, or know of him,
  by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib, I know him well. It is an honor."</p>

  <p>The Scotsman smiled. "He must be very far away by this time. How many are
  there, I wonder, in India who have such things said of them when their backs
  are turned?"</p>

  <p>"More than a few, sahib! I would draw steel for the good name of more than
  a hundred men whom I know, and there be many others!"</p>

  <p>"Men of your own race?"</p>

  <p>"And yours, sahib."</p>

  <p>There was no bombast in the man's voice; it was said good-naturedly, as a
  man might say, "There are some friends to whom I would lend money." No man
  with any insight could mistake the truth that underlay the boast. The
  Scotsman bowed.</p>

  <p>"I am glad, indeed, to have met you. Will you sit down a little
  while?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. The hour is late. I was but keeping the blood moving in this
  horse of mine."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me, since you won't stay, have you any notion who the man was
  whom Mohammed Gunga sent to get my letters? My daughter handed them to him
  one evening, late, at this door."</p>

  <p>"I am he, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;I understood&mdash;perhaps I was mistaken&mdash;I thought it
  was his man who came?"</p>

  <p>"Praised be Allah, I am his man, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I wonder whether my servants praise God for the privilege!" McClean
  made the remark only half-aloud and in English. Ali Partab could not have
  understood the words, but he may have caught their meaning, for he glanced
  sideways at the old hag mumbling in the shadow and grinned into his beard.
  "Are you in communication with him? Could you get a letter to him?"</p>

  <p>"I have no slightest notion where he is, sahib."</p>

  <p>"If my letters could once reach him, wherever he might be, I would feel
  confident of their arriving at their destination."</p>

  <p>"I, too, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"I sent one letter&mdash;to a government official. It cannot have reached
  him, for there should have been an answer and none has come. It had reference
  to this terrible suttee* business. Suttee is against the law as well as
  against all dictates of reason and humanity; yet the Hindus make a constant
  practice of it here under our very eyes. These native states are under treaty
  to observe the law. I intend to do all in my power to put a stop to their
  ghoulish practices, and Maharajah Howrah knows what my intentions are. It
  must be a Mohammedan, this time, to whom I entrust my correspondence on
  suttee!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>suttee</i>&mdash;the now illegal practice of a

  <p>Now, a Rangar is a man whose ancestors were Hindus but who became converts
  to Islam. Like all proselytes, they adhere more enthusiastically to their
  religion than do the men whose mother creed it is; and the fact that the
  Rangars originally became converts under duress is often thrown in their
  teeth by the Hindus, who gain nothing in the way of brotherly regard in the
  process. A Rangar hates a Hindu as enthusiastically as he loves a fight. Ali
  Partab began to drum his fingers on his teeth and to exhibit less impatience
  to be off.</p>

  <p>"There is no knowing, sahib. I, too, am no advocate of superstitious
  practices involving cruelty. I might get a letter through. My commission from
  the risaldar-sahib would include all honorable matters not obstructive to the
  main issue. I have certain funds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I, too, have funds," smiled the missionary.</p>

  <p>"I am not allowed, sahib, to involve myself in any brawl until after my
  business is accomplished. It would be necessary first to assure me on that
  point. My honor is involved in that matter. To whom, and of what nature,
  would the letter be?"</p>

  <p>"A letter to the Company's Resident at Abu, reporting to him that Hindu
  widows are still compelled in this city to burn themselves to death above
  their husbands' funeral pyres."</p>

  <p>The Rajput grinned. "Does the Resident sahib not know it, then?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no chance of his not knowing should my report reach
  him!"</p>

  <p>"I will see, sahib, what can be done, then, in the matter. If I can find a
  man, I will bring him to you."</p>

  <p>The missionary thanked him and stood watching as the Rajput rode away.
  When the horseman's free, lean back had vanished in the inky darkness his
  eyes wandered over to a point where tongues of flame licked upward, casting a
  dull, dancing, crimson glow on the hot sky. Here and there, silhouetted in
  the firelight, he could see the puggrees and occasional long poles of men who
  prodded at the embers. Ululating through the din of tom-toms he could catch
  the wails of women. He shuddered, prayed a little, and went in.</p>

  <p>That day even the little bazaar fosterlings, whom he had begged, and
  coaxed, and taught, had all deserted to be present at the burning of three
  widows. Even the lepers in the tiny hospital that he had started had limped
  out for a distant view. He had watched a year's work all disintegrating in a
  minute at the call of bestial, loathsome, blood-hungry superstition.</p>

  <p>And he was a man of iron, as Christian missionaries go. He had been hard-
  bitten in his youth and trained in a hard, grim school. In the Isle of Skye
  he had seen the little cabin where his mother lived pulled down to make more
  room for a fifty-thousand-acre deer-forest. He had seen his mother beg.</p>

  <p>He had worked his way to Edinburgh, toiled at starvation wages for the
  sake of leave to learn at night, burned midnight oil, and failed at the end
  of it, through ill health, to pass for his degree.</p>

  <p>He had loved as only hard-hammered men can love, and had married after a
  struggle the very thought of which would have melted the courage of an
  ordinary man, only to see his wife die when her child was born. And even
  then, in that awful hour, he had not felt the utterness of misery such as
  came to him when he saw that his work in Howrah was undone. He had given of
  his best, and all his best, and it seemed that he had given it for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Who was that man, father?" asked a very weary voice through which courage
  seemed to live yet, as the tiniest suspicion of a sweet refrain still lives
  through melancholy bars.</p>

  <p>"The man who took your home letters to Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"He has promised to try to find a man for me who will take my report on
  this awful business to the Resident at Abu."</p>

  <p>"Father, listen! Listen, please!" Rosemary McClean drew a chair for him
  and knelt beside him. Youth saved her face from being drawn as his, but the
  heat and horror had begun to undermine youth's powers of resistance. She
  looked more beautiful than ever, but no law lays down that a wraith shall be
  unlovely. She had tried the personal appeal with him a hundred times, and
  argument a thousand; now, she used both in a concentrated, earnest effort to
  prevail over his stubborn will. Her will was as strong as his, and yielded
  place to nothing but her sense of loyalty. There were not only Rajputs, as
  the Rajputs knew, who could be true to a high ideal. "I am sure that whoever
  that man is he must be the link between us and the safety Mohammed Gunga
  spoke of. Otherwise, why does he stay behind? Native officers who have
  servants take their servants with them, as a rule."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Give the word! Let us at least get in touch with safety!"</p>

  <p>"For myself, no. For you, yes! I have been weak with you, dear. I have let
  my selfish pleasure in having you near me overcome my sense of duty&mdash;
  that, and my faithless fear that you would not be properly provided for. I
  think, too, that I have never quite induced myself to trust natives
  sufficiently&mdash;even native gentlemen. You shall go, Rosemary. You shall
  go as soon as I can get word to Mohammed Gunga's man. Call that old woman
  in."</p>

  <p>"Father, I will not go without you, and you know it! My place is with you,
  and I have quite made up my mind. If you stay, I stay! My presence here has
  saved your life a hundred times over. No, I don't mean just when you were
  ill; I mean that they dare not lay a finger on me! They know that a nation
  which respects their women would strike hard and swiftly to avenge a woman of
  its own! If I were to go away and leave you they would poison you or stab you
  within a day, and then hold a mock trial and hang some innocent or other to
  blind the British Government. I would be a murderess if I left you here
  alone! Come! Come away!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "It was wrong of me to ever bring you here," he said
  sadly. "But I did not know&mdash;I would never have believed." Then wrath
  took hold of him&mdash;the awful, cold anger of the Puritan that hates evil
  as a concrete thing, to be ripped apart with steel. "God's wrath shall burst
  on Howrah!" he declared. "Sodom and Gomorrah were no worse! Remember what
  befell them!"</p>

  <p>"Remember Lot!" said Rosemary. "Come away!"</p>

  <p>"Lot stayed on to the last, and tried to warn them! I will warn the
  Resident! Here, give me my writing things&mdash;where are they?"</p>

  <p>He pushed her aside, none too gently, for the fire of a Covenanter's anger
  was blazing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"There are forty thousand British soldiers standing still, and wrong
  &mdash;black, shameful wrong&mdash;is being done! For a matter of gold
  &mdash;for fear of the cost in filthy lucre&mdash;they refrain from hurling
  wrong-doers in the dust! For the sake of dishonorable peace they leave these
  native states to misgovern themselves and stink to high heaven! Will God
  allow what they do? The shame and the sin is on England's head! Her statesmen
  shut their eyes and cry 'Peace, peace!' where there is no peace. Her queen
  sits idle on the throne while widows burn, screaming, in the flames of
  superstitious priests. Men tell her, 'All is well; there is British rule in
  India!' They are too busy robbing widows in the Isle of Skye to lend an ear
  to the cries of India's widows! Corruption&mdash;superstition&mdash;
  murder&mdash;lies&mdash;black wrong&mdash;black selfishness&mdash;all growing
  rank beneath the shadow of the British rule&mdash;how long will God let that
  last?"</p>

  <p>He was pacing up and down like a caged lion, not looking at Rosemary, not
  speaking to her&mdash;speaking to himself, and giving rein to all the
  rankling rage at wrong that wrong had nurtured in him since his boyhood. She
  knelt still by the chair, her eyes following him as he raged up and down the
  matted floor. She pitied him more than she did India.</p>

  <p>When he took the one lamp at last and set it where the light would fall
  above his writing pad, she left the room and went to stand at the
  street-door, where the sluggish night air was a degree less stifling than in
  the mud-plastered, low-ceilinged room. As she stood there, one hand on either
  door-post to remind her she was living in a concrete world, not a charred
  wisp swaying in the heat, a black thing rose out of the blackness, and the
  toothless hag held out a bony hand and touched her.</p>

  <p>"Is it not time yet for the word to go?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. No word yet, Joanna."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Now, God give good going to master o' mine,<br>
  God speed him, and lead him, and nerve him;<br>
  God give him a lead of a length in the line,<br>
  And,&mdash;God let him boast that I serve him!</p><br>

  <p class="first">The dawn was barely breaking yet when things stirred in the
  little mission house. The flea-bitten grey pony was saddled by a sleepy sais,
  and brought round from his open-sided thatch stable in the rear. The violet
  and mauve, that precede the aching yellow glare of day were fading; a
  coppersmith began his everlasting bong-bong-bong, apparently reverberating
  from every direction; the last, almost undetectable, warm whiff of night wind
  moved and died away, and the monkeys in the near-by baobab chattered it a
  requiem. Almost on the stroke of sunrise Rosemary McClean stepped
  out&mdash;settled her sun-helmet, with a moue above the chin-strap that was
  wasted on flat-bosomed, black grandmotherdom and sulky groom&mdash;and
  mounted.</p>

  <p>She needed no help. The pony stood as though he knew that the hot wind
  would soon dry the life out of him; and, though dark rings beneath dark eyes
  betrayed the work of heat and sleepless worry on a girl who should have
  graced the cool, sweet, rain-swept hills of Scotland, she had spirit left yet
  and an unspent store of youth. The sais seemed more weathered than the
  twenty-year-old girl, for he limped back into the smelly shelter of the
  servants' quarters to cook his breakfast and mumble about dogs and sahibs who
  prefer the sun.</p>

  <p>She looked shrunk inside the riding-habit&mdash;not shriveled, for she sat
  too straight, but as though the cotton jacket had been made for a larger
  woman. If she seemed tired, and if a stranger might have guessed that her
  head ached until the chestnut curls were too heavy for it, she was still
  supple. And, as she whipped the pony into an unwilling trot and old
  mission-named Joanna broke into a jog behind, revolt&mdash;no longer
  impatience, or discontent, or sorrow, but reckless rebellion&mdash;rode with
  her.</p>

  <p>It was there, plain for the world to see, in the firm lines of a little
  Puritan mouth, in the angle of a high-held chin in the set of a gallant
  little pair of shoulders. The pony felt it, and leaned forward to a canter.
  Joanna scented, smelt, or sensed in some manner known to Eastern old age,
  that purpose was afoot; this was to be no early-morning canter, merely out
  and home again; there was no time, now, for the customary tricks of
  corner-cutting and rest-snatching under eaves; she tucked her head down and
  jogged forward in the dust, more like a dog than ever. It was a dog's silent,
  striving determination to be there when the finish came&mdash;a dog's
  disregard of all object or objective but his master's&mdash;but a long-thrown
  stride, and a crafty, beady eye that promised more usefulness than a dog's
  when called on.</p>

  <p>The first word spoken was when Rosemary drew rein a little more than half-
  way along the palace wall.</p>

  <p>"Are you tired yet, Joanna?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-uh!" the woman answered, shaking her head violently and pointing at
  the sun that mounted every minute higher. The argument was obvious; in less
  than twenty minutes the whole horizon would be shimmering again like shaken
  plates of brass; wherever the other end might be, a rest would be better
  there than here! Her mistress nodded, and rode on again, faster yet; she had
  learned long ago that Joanna could show a dusty pair of heels to almost
  anything that ran, and she had never yet known distance tire her; it had been
  the thought of distance and speed combined that made her pause and ask.</p>

  <p>She did not stop again until they had cantered up through the awakening
  bazaar, where unclean-looking merchants and their underlings rinsed out their
  teeth noisily above the gutters, and the pariah dogs had started nosing in
  among the muck for things unthinkable to eat. The sun had shortened up the
  shadows and begun to beat down through the gaps; the advance-guard of the
  shriveling hot wind had raised foul dust eddies, and the city was ahum when
  she halted at last beside the big brick arch of the caravansary, where
  Mohammed Gunga's boots and spurs had caught her eye once.</p>

  <p>"Now, Joanna!" She leaned back from the saddle and spoke low, but with a
  certain thrill. "Go in there, find me Mohammed Gunga-sahib's man, and bring
  him out here!"</p>

  <p>"And if he will not come?" The old woman seemed half-afraid to enter.</p>

  <p>"Go in, and don't come out without him&mdash;unless you want to see me go
  in by myself!"</p>

  <p>The old woman looked at her piercingly with eyes that gleamed from amid a
  bunch of wrinkles, then motioned with a skinny arm in the direction of an
  awning where shade was to be had from the dangerous early sun-rays. She made
  no move to enter through the arch until her mistress had taken shelter.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later she emerged with Ali Partab, who looked sleepy, but
  still more ashamed of his unmilitary dishabille. Rosemary McClean glanced
  left and right&mdash;forgot about the awning and the custom which decrees
  aloofness&mdash;ignored the old woman's waving arm and Ali Partab's frown,
  and rode toward him eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Did Mohammed Gunga-sahib leave you here with any orders relative to me?"
  she asked.</p>

  <p>The Rajput bowed.</p>

  <p>"Before he went away, he spoke to me of safety, and told me he would leave
  a link between me and men whom I may trust."</p>

  <p>The Rajput bowed again. Neither of them saw an elbow laid on the window-
  ledge of a room above the arch; it disappeared, and very gingerly a bared
  black head replaced it. Then the head too disappeared.</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes sparkled as the reassurance came that at least one good
  fighting man was waiting to do nothing but assist her. For the moment she
  threw caution to the winds and remembered nothing but her plight and her
  father's stubbornness.</p>

  <p>"My father will not come away, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ali Partab's eyes betrayed no trace of concern.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I thought&mdash;Are you all alone?"</p>

  <p>"All alone, Miss-sahib, but your servant."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I thought&mdash;perhaps that"&mdash;she checked herself, then rushed
  the words out as though ashamed of them&mdash;"that, if you had men to help
  you, you might carry him away against his will! Where are these others who
  are to be trusted?"</p>

  <p>Ali Partab grinned and then drew himself up with a movement of polite
  dissent. It was not for him to question the suggestions of a Miss-sahib; he
  conveyed that much with an inimitable air. But it was his business to keep
  strictly to the letter of his orders.</p>

  <p>"Miss-sahib, I cannot do that. So said Mohammed Gunga: 'When the hag
  brings word, then take three horses and bear the Miss-sahib and her father to
  my cousin Alwa's place.' I stand ready to obey, but the padre-sahib comes not
  against his will."</p>

  <p>"To whose place?"</p>

  <p>"Alwa's, Miss-sahib."</p>

  <p>"And who is he?" She seemed bewildered. "I had hoped to be escorted to
  some British residency."</p>

  <p>"That would be for Alwa, should he see fit. He has men and horses, and a
  fort that is impregnable. The Miss-sahib would be safe there under all
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but, supposing I declined to accept that invitation? Supposing
  I preferred not to be carried off to a&mdash;er&mdash;a Mohammedan
  gentleman's fort. What then?"</p>

  <p>"I could but wait here, Miss-sahib, until the hour came when you changed
  your mind, or until Mohammed Gunga by letter or by word of mouth relieved me
  of my trust."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Then you will wait here until I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, Miss-sahib."</p>

  <p>The head again peered through the window up above them, but disappeared
  below the ledge furtively, and none of the three were aware of it. For that
  matter, the old woman was gazing intently at Ali Partab and listening
  eagerly; he stood almost underneath the arch, and Miss McClean was staring at
  him frowning with the effort to translate her thoughts into a language that
  is very far from easy. They would none of them have seen the roof descending
  on them.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and won't you under any circumstances take us, say, to the
  Resident at Abu instead?"</p>

  <p>"I may not, Miss-sahib."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"Of a truth I know not. I never yet knew Mohammed Gunga to give an order
  without good reason for it; but beyond that he chose me, because he said the
  task might prove difficult and he trusted me, I know nothing."</p>

  <p>"Have you no idea of the reason?"</p>

  <p>"Miss-sahib, I am a soldier. To me an order is an order to be carried out;
  suspicions, fears are nothing unless they stand in the way of accomplishment.
  I await your word. I am ready. The horses are here&mdash;good horses
  &mdash;lean and hard. The order is that you must ask me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;er&mdash;Ali what?&mdash;thank you, Ali Partab." The
  disappointment in her voice was scarcely more noticeable than the despondency
  her drooping figure showed. The little shoulders that had sat so square and
  gallantly seemed to have lost their strength, and there was none of the
  determined ring left in the words she hesitated for. "I&mdash;hope you will
  understand that I am grateful&mdash;but&mdash;I cannot&mdash; er&mdash;see my
  way just yet to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In your good time, Miss-sahib. I was ordered to have patience!"</p>

  <p>"At least I will have more confidence, knowing that you are always close
  at hand."</p>

  <p>The Rajput bowed. She reined back. He saluted, and she bowed again; then,
  with a glance to make sure that Joanna followed, she started back at little
  more than a walking pace&mdash;a dejected wraith of a girl on a dejected-
  looking pony, too overcome by the upsetting of her rebellious scheme to care
  or even think whether Joanna dropped out of sight or not. Ali Partab watched
  her down the street with a face that betrayed no emotion and no suspicion of
  what his thoughts might be. When she was out of sight he went back under the
  arch to attend to his three horses; and the moment that he did so a fat but
  very furtive Hindu took his place&mdash;glanced down the street once in the
  direction that Rosemary had taken&mdash;and then darted up-street as fast as
  his shaking paunch would let him. He had been gone at the least ten minutes,
  when Joanna, also furtive, also in a hurry, dodged here and there among the
  commencing surge of traffic and approached the arch again.</p>

  <p>It would be useless to try to read her mind, or to translate the glitter
  of her beady eyes into thoughts intelligible to any but an Oriental. It was
  quite clear, though, that she wished not to be noticed, that she feared the
  occupants of the caravansary, and that she had returned for word with Ali
  Partab. He, least of all, would have doubted her intention of demanding the
  two gold mohurs, for it was she who had brought the word that Miss McClean
  wanted him. But what relation that intention had to her loyalty or treachery,
  or whether she were capable of either&mdash;capable of anything except greed,
  and obedience for the sake of pay&mdash;were problems no man living could
  have guessed.</p>

  <p>She asked the lounging sweeper by the arch whether Ali Partab had ridden
  out as yet. He jeered back outrageous improprieties, suggestive of impossible
  ambition on the hag's part. She called him "sahib," dubbed him "father of a
  dozen stalwart sons," returned a few of his immodest compliments with a
  flattering laugh, and learned that Ali Partab was still busy in the
  caravansary. Then she proceeded to make herself very inconspicuous beside a
  two-wheeled wagon, up-ended in the gutter opposite the arch, and waited with
  eastern patience for the horseman to ride out.</p>

  <p>She saw the fat Hindu come back, in no particular hurry now, and seat
  himself not far from her. Later she saw eight horsemen ride down the street,
  pass the arch, wheel, and halt. She noticed that they were not Maharajah
  Howrah's men but a portion of his brother Jaimihr's body-guard, then took no
  further notice of them. If they chose to wait there, it was no affair of
  hers, and to appear inquisitive would be to invite a lance-butt, very
  shrewdly thrust where it would hurt.</p>

  <p>It was an hour at least before Ali Partab rode out through the arch,
  looking down anxiously at his horse's off-hind that had been showing symptoms
  of "brushing" lately. Joanna rose instantly to cross the street and intercept
  him; and she recoiled in the nick of time to save herself from being ridden
  down.</p>

  <p>At a sign from the fat Hindu the eight horsemen spurred, and swooped up-
  street with the speed and certainty of sparrow-hawks and the noise of
  devastation. They rode down Ali Partab&mdash;unhorsed him&mdash;bound him
  &mdash;threw him on his horse again&mdash;and galloped off before any but the
  Hindu had time to realize that he was their objective. He was gone
  &mdash;snatched like a chicken from the coop. Noise and dust were all the
  trace or explanation that he left. The mazy streets swallowed him; the Hindu
  waddled over to the arch and disappeared without a smile on his face to show
  even interest. The interrupted trading and bartering went on again, and no
  one commented or made a move to follow but Joanna.</p>

  <p>She watched the fat Hindu, and made sure that she would recognize him
  anywhere again. Then, by a trail that no one would have guessed at and few
  could have followed, she made her way to Jaimihr's palace&mdash;three miles
  away from Howrah's&mdash;where a dozen sulky-looking sepoys lolled,
  dismounted, by the wooden gate. There was neither sight nor sound of mounted
  men, and the gate was shut; but in the middle of the roadway there was
  smoking dung, and there was a suspicion of overacting about the indifference
  of the guardians of the entrance.</p>

  <p>There was no overacting, though, in what Joanna did. Nobody would have
  dreamed that she was playing any kind of part, or interested in anything at
  all except the coppers that she begged for. She squatted in the roadway,
  ink-black and clear-cut in the now blazing sunlight, alternately flattering
  them and pretending to a knowledge of unguessed-at witchcraft.</p>

  <p>She was there still at midday when they changed the guard. She was there
  when night fell, still squatting in the roadway, still exchanging repartee
  and hints at the supernatural with armed men who shuddered now and then
  between their bursts of mockery. The sore, suffering dogs that sniff through
  the night for worse eyesores than themselves whimpered and watched her. The
  guard changed and the moon paled, but she stayed on; and whatever her
  purpose, or whatever information she obtained in fragments amid the raillery,
  she did not return to the mission house.</p>

  <p>It was not until Rosemary McClean returned and dismounted by the door that
  she realized Joanna had not kept pace. Even then she thought little of it;
  the old woman often lingered on the homeward way when the chance of her being
  needed was remote. Two or three hours passed before the suspicion rose that
  anything might have happened to Joanna, and even then she might not have been
  remembered had not Duncan McClean asked for her.</p>

  <p>"I have changed my mind," he said, calling Rosemary into the long, low
  living-room. It was darkened to exclude the hot wind and the glare, and he
  looked like a ghost as he rose to meet her. "I have decided that my duty is
  to get away from this place for your sake and for the sake of the cause I
  have at heart. We are doing no good here. I can do most by going to the
  Resident, or even to somebody higher up than he, and laying my case before
  him personally. Send for Joanna, and tell her to go and bring Mohammed
  Gunga's man."</p>

  <p>It was then that they missed Joanna and began to search for her. But no
  Joanna came. It was then that Rosemary McClean rehearsed with her father her
  former conversation with Mohammed Gunga and part, at least, of her recent one
  with Ali Partab, and the missionary started off himself to find the horseman
  whom Mohammed Gunga had so thoughtfully left behind.</p>

  <p>But he very naturally found no Ali Partab. What he did discover was that
  he was followed&mdash;that a guard, unarmed but obvious, was placed around
  the mission house&mdash;that his servants deserted one by one&mdash;that no
  more children came to the mission school.</p>

  <p>He decided to take chances and ride off with his daughter in the night.
  But the ponies went mysteriously lame, and nobody would lend or sell him
  horses on any terms at all. He did his best to get a letter through to
  anywhere where there were British, but nobody would take it. And then Jaimihr
  came, swaggering with his escort, to offer him and his daughter the
  hospitality of his palace.</p>

  <p>He declined that offer a little testily, for the insolence behind the
  offer was less than half concealed. Jaimihr sneered as he rode away.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps a month or two of undisturbed enjoyment will induce the padre-
  sahib to change his mind about my invitation!" he said nastily. And he made
  no secret then, as he ordered them about before he went, that the men who
  lounged and watched at every vantage-point were his.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">They looked into my eyes and laughed,&mdash;<br>
  But, what when I was gone?<br>
  Have strong men made me one of them?<br>
  Or do I ride alone?</p><br>

  <p class="first">ON the morning after Mohammed Gunga's daring experiment with
  Cunningham's nervous system he was anxious to say the least of it; and that
  is only another way of saying that he was irritable. He watched the
  Englishman at breakfast, on the dak-bungalow veranda, with a sideways
  restless glance that gave the lie a dozen times over to his assumed air of
  irascible authority.</p>

  <p>"We will see now what we will see," he muttered to himself. "These who
  know such a lot imagine that the test is made. They forget that there be many
  brave men of whom but a few are fit to lead. Now&mdash;now&mdash;we will
  see!" And he kept on repeating that assurance to himself, with the air of a
  man who would like to be assured, but is not, while he ostentatiously found
  fault with every single thing on which his eyes lit.</p>

  <p>"One would think that the Risaldar-sahib were afraid of consequences!"
  whispered the youngest of his followers, stung to the quick by a quite
  unmerited rebuke. "Does he fear that Chota-Cunnigan will beat him?"</p>

  <p>White men have been known&mdash;often&mdash;to do stupider things than
  that, and particularly young white men who have not yet learned to gauge
  proportions accurately; so there was nothing really ridiculous in the
  suggestion. A young white man who has had his temper worked up to the
  boiling-point, his nerves deliberately racked, and then has been subjected to
  the visit of a driven tiger, may be confidently expected to exhibit all the
  faults of which his character is capable.</p>

  <p>To make the situation even more ticklish, Cunningham's servant, in his
  zeal for his master's comfort, had forgotten to sham sickness, and instead of
  limping was in abominably active evidence. He was even doing more than was
  expected of him. Ralph Cunningham had said nothing to him&mdash;had not
  needed to; every single thing that a pampered sahib could imagine that he
  needed was done for him in the proper order, without noise or awkwardness,
  and the Risaldar cursed as he watched the clockwork-perfect service. He had
  hoped for a lapse that might call forth some pointer, either by way of
  irritation or amusement, as to how young Cunningham was taking things.</p>

  <p>But not a thing went wrong and not a sign of any sort gave Cunningham. The
  youngster did not smile either to himself darkly or at his servant. He lit
  his after-breakfast cigar and smoked it peacefully, as though he had spent an
  absolutely normal night, without even a dream to worry him, and if he eyed
  Mohammed Gunga at all, he did it so naturally, and with so little interest,
  that no deductions could be drawn from it. He was neither more nor less than
  a sahib at his ease&mdash;which was disconcerting, very, to the Oriental
  mind.</p>

  <p>He smoked the cigar to a finish, without a word or sign that he wished to
  give audience. Then his eyes lit for the first time on the tiger-skin that
  was pegged out tight, raw side upward, for the sun to sterilize; he threw the
  butt of his cigar away and strolled out to examine the skin without a sign to
  Mohammed Gunga, counted the claws one by one to make sure that no
  superstitious native had purloined any of them, and returned to his chair on
  the veranda without a word.</p>

  <p>"Is he vindictive, then?" wondered Mohammed Gunga. "Is he a mean man? Will
  he bear malice and get even with me later on? If so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Present my compliments to Mohammed Gunga-sahib, and ask him to be good
  enough to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar heard the order, and was on his way to the veranda before the
  servant started to convey the message. He took no chances on a reprimand
  about his shoes, for he swaggered up in riding-boots, which no soldier can be
  asked to take off before he treads on a private floor; and he saluted as a
  soldier, all dignity. It was the only way by which he could be sure to keep
  the muscles of his face from telling tales.</p>

  <p>"Huzoor?"</p>

  <p>"Morning, Mohammed Gunga. Take a seat, won't you?"</p>

  <p>A camp-chair creaked under the descending Rajput's weight, and creaked
  again as he remembered to settle himself less stiffly&mdash;less
  guiltily.</p>

  <p>"I say, I'm going to ask you chaps to do me a favor. You don't mind
  obliging me now and then, do you?"</p>

  <p>The youngster leaned forward confidentially, one elbow on his knee, and
  looked half-serious, as though what he had to ask were more important than
  the ordinary.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, there is nothing that we will not do."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Then you won't mind my mentioning this, I'm sure. Next time you want
  to kennel a tiger in my bedroom, d'you mind giving me notice in advance? It's
  not the stink I mind, nor being waked up; it's the deuced awful risk of
  hurting somebody. Besides&mdash;look how I spoilt that tiger's mask! The
  skins I've always admired at home had been shot where it didn't show so
  badly."</p>

  <p>There was not even the symptom of a smile on Cunningham's face. He looked
  straight into Mohammed Gunga's eyes, and spoke as one man talking calm common
  sense to another. He raised his hand as the Rajput began to stammer an
  apology.</p>

  <p>"No. Don't apologize. If you'll forgive me for shooting your pet tiger,
  I'll overlook the rest of it. If I'd known that you kept him in there o'
  nights, I'd have chosen another room, that's all&mdash;some room where I
  couldn't smell him, and where I shouldn't run the risk of killing an
  inoffensive man. Why, I might have shot you! Think how sorry I'd have
  been!"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar did not quite know what to say; so, wiser than most, he said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, and one other matter. I don't speak much of the language yet, so,
  would you mind translating to my servant that the next time he goes sick
  without giving me notice, and without putting oil in my lamp, I'll have him
  fed to the tiger before he's brought into my room? Just tell him that
  quietly, will you? Say it slowly so that it sinks in. Thanks."</p>

  <p>Straight-faced as Cunningham himself, the Risaldar tongue-lashed the
  servant with harsh, tooth-rasping words that brought him up to attention.
  Whether he interpreted or not the exact meaning of what Cunningham had said,
  he at least produced the desired effect; the servant mumbled apologetic
  nothings and slunk off the veranda backward&mdash;to go away and hold his
  sides with laughter at the back of the dak-bungalow. There Mohammed Gunga
  found him afterwards and administered a thrashing&mdash;not, as he was
  careful to explain, for disobedience, but for having dared to be amused at
  the Risaldar's discomfiture.</p>

  <p>But there was still one point that weighed heavily on Mohammed Gunga's
  mind as the servant shuffled off and left him alone face to face with
  Cunningham. There is as a very general rule not more than one man-eating
  tiger in a neighborhood, and not even the greenest specimen of subaltern new
  brought from home would be likely to mistake one for the other kind. The
  man-eater was dead, and there was an engagement to shoot one that very
  morning. He hesitated&mdash;said nothing for the moment&mdash;and wondered
  whether his best course would be to go ahead and pretend to beat out the
  jungle and tell some lie or other about the tiger having got away. But Ralph
  Cunningham, with serious grey eyes fixed full on his, saved him the trouble
  of deciding.</p>

  <p>"If it's all one to you, Mohammed Gunga," he said, the corner of his mouth
  just flickering, "we'll move on from here at once. This is a beastly old
  bungalow to sleep in, and shooting tigers don't seem so terribly exciting to
  me. Besides, the climate here must be rotten for the horses."</p>

  <p>"As you wish, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;if the choice rests with me, I wish it. It might
  &mdash;ah&mdash;save the villagers a lot of hard work beating through the
  jungle, mightn't it&mdash;besides, there'll be other tigers on the road."</p>

  <p>"Innumerable tigers, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Good. Will you order a start then?"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar departed round the corner of the bungalow, and a minute or
  two later Cunningham's ears caught the sound of a riding-switch, lustily
  applied, and of muffled groans. He suspected readily enough what was going
  on, particularly since his servant was not in evidence, but he dared not
  laugh on the veranda. He went inside, and made believe to be busy with his
  bag before he relaxed the muscles of his face.</p>

  <p>"Now, I wonder whether I handled that situation rightly?" he asked himself
  between chuckles. "One thing I know&mdash;if that old ruffian plays another
  trick on me&mdash;one more of any kind&mdash;Ill show my teeth. There's a
  thing known as the limit!"</p>

  <p>He would not have wondered, though, if he could have overheard Mohammed
  Gunga less than an hour later. The Risaldar had stayed behind to make sure
  nothing had been forgotten, and one of his men remained with him.</p>

  <p>"There be sahibs and then sahibs," said Mohammed Gunga. "Two kinds are the
  worst&mdash;those who strike readily in anger and use bad language when
  annoyed, and those whose lips are thin and who save their vengeance to be
  wreaked later on. They are worse, either of them, than the sahib who is
  usually drunk."</p>

  <p>"And Cunnigan?"</p>

  <p>"Is altogether otherwise. As his father was, and as a few other sahibs I
  have met, he understands what is not spoken&mdash;concedes dignity to him who
  is caught napping, as one who having disarmed his adversary, allows him to
  recover his weapon&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And?"</p>

  <p>"Proves himself a man worth following! I myself will slit the throat of
  any man I catch disparaging the name of Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur! By the blood
  of God&mdash;by my medals, my own honor, and the good name of Pukka-Cunnigan,
  his father, I swear it!"</p>

  <p>"Rung Ho!" grinned the six-foot son of war who rode beside him.</p>

  <p>They rode on at a walk past the tombstone that&mdash;at Mohammed Gunga's
  orders&mdash;the villagers had decked with sickly scented forest flowers, and
  as they passed they both saluted it in silence. The fakir of the night
  before, sitting not very far away from it, mimicked them. He sprang on the
  stone as soon as they were out of sight, scattering the flowers all about
  him, and calling down the vengeance of a hundred gods on the heads of
  Christian and Mohammedan alike.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">From lone hunt came the yearling cub<br>
  And brought a grown kill back;<br>
  With fangs aglut "'Tis nothing but<br>
  Presumption!" growled the pack.</p><br>

  <p class="first">RALPH CUNNINGHAM reached Peshawar at last with no less than
  nine tigers to his gun, and that in itself would have been sufficient to damn
  him in the eyes of more than half of the men who held commands there.
  Jealousy in those days of slow promotion and entrenched influence had eaten
  into the very understanding of men whose only excuse for rule over a
  conquered people ought to have been understanding.</p>

  <p>It was not considered decent for a boy of twenty-one to do much more than
  dare to be alive. For any man at all to offer advice or information to his
  senior was rank presumption. Criticism was high treason. Sport, such as
  tiger-shooting, was for those whose age and apoplectic temper rendered them
  least fitted for it. Conservatism reigned: "High Toryism, sir, old port, and
  proud Prerogative!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga grinned into his beard at the reception that awaited the
  youngster whom he had trained for months now in the belief that India had
  nothing much to do except reverence him. He laughed aloud, when he could get
  away to do it, at the flush of indignation on his protégé's face. Tall,
  lean-limbed, full of health and spirits, he had paid his duty call on a
  General of Division; with the boyish enthusiasm that says so plainly, "Laugh
  with me, for the world is mine!" He had boasted his good luck on the road,
  only to be snubbed thoroughly and told that tiger-shooting was not what he
  came for.</p>

  <p>He took the snub like a man and made no complaint to anybody; he did not
  even mention it to the other subalterns, who, most of them, made no secret of
  their dissatisfaction and its hundred causes. He listened, and it was not
  very long before it dawned on him that, had not Mohammed Gunga gone with him
  to pay a call as well, the General Division would not have so much as
  interviewed him.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga soon became the bane of his existence. The veteran seemed
  in no hurry to go back to his estate that must have been in serious need of
  management by this time, but would ride off on mysterious errands and return
  with a dozen or more black-bearded horsemen each time. He would introduce
  them to Cunningham in public whenever possible under the eyes of outraged
  seniors who would swear and, fume and ride away disgust at the reverence paid
  to "a mere boy, sir&mdash;a bally, ignorant young jackanapes!"</p>

  <p>Had Cunningham been other than a born soldier with his soldier senses all
  on edge and sleepless, he would have fallen foul of disgrace within a month.
  He was unattached as yet, and that fact gave opportunity to the men who
  looked for it to try to "take the conceit out of the cub, by gad."</p>

  <p>"They "&mdash;everybody spoke of them as "they"&mdash;conceived the
  brilliant idea of confronting the youngster with conditions which he lacked
  experience to cope with. They set him to deal with circumstances which had
  long ago proved too difficult for themselves, and awaited confidently the
  outcome&mdash;the crass mistake, or oversight, or mere misfortune that, with
  the aid of a possible court martial, would reduce him to a proper state of
  humbleness.</p>

  <p>Peshawar, the greatest garrison in northern India, was there on
  sufferance, apparently. For lack of energetic men in authority to deal with
  them, the border robbers plundered while the troops remained cooped up within
  the unhealthiest station on the list. The government itself, with several
  thousand troops to back it up, was paying blackmail to the border thieves!
  There was not a government bungalow in all Peshawar that did not have its
  "watchman," hired from over the border, well paid to sleep on the veranda
  lest his friends should come and take tribute in an even more unseemly
  manner.</p>

  <p>The younger men, whose sense of fitness had not yet been rotted by climate
  and system and prerogative, swore at the condition; there were one or two men
  higher up, destined to make history, whose voices, raised in emphatic
  protest, were drowned in the drone of "Peace! Peace is the thing to work for.
  Compromise, consideration, courtesy, these three are the keys of rule." They
  failed to realize that cowardice was their real keynote, and that the
  threefold method that they vaunted was quite useless without a stiffening of
  courage.</p>

  <p>So brave men, who had more courtesy in each of their fingers than most of
  the seniors had all put together, had to bow to a scandalous condition that
  made England's rule a laughing-stock within a stone's throw of the city
  limits. And they had to submit to the indecency of seeing a new,
  inexperienced arrival picked for the task of commanding a body of irregulars,
  for no other reason than because it was considered wise to make an exhibition
  of him.</p>

  <p>Cunningham became half policeman, half soldier, in charge of a small
  special force of mounted men engaged for the purpose of patrol. He had
  nothing to do with the selection of them; that business was attended to
  perfunctorily by a man very high up in departmental service, who considered
  Cunningham a nuisance. He was a gentleman who did not know Mohammed Gunga;
  another thing he did not know was the comfortable feel of work well done; so
  he was more than pleased when Mohammed Gunga dropped in from nowhere in
  particular&mdash;paid him scandalously untrue compliments without a blush or
  a smile and offered to produce the required number of men at once.</p>

  <p>Only fifty were required. Mohammed Gunga brought three hundred to select
  from, and, when asked to do so in order to save time and trouble, picked out
  the fifty best.</p>

  <p>"There are your men!" said the Personage off-handedly, when they had been
  sworn in in a group. "Be good enough to remember, Mr. Cunningham, that you
  are now responsible for their behavior, and for the proper night patrolling
  of the city limits."</p>

  <p>That was a tall order, and in spite of all of youth's enthusiasm was
  enough to make any young fellow nervous. But Mohammed Gunga met him in the
  street, saluted him with almost sacrilegious ceremony, and drew him to one
  side.</p>

  <p>"Have courage, now, bahadur! I ride away to visit my estates (he spoke of
  them always in the plural, as though he owned a county or two). You have
  under you the best eyes and the keenest blades along the border for I
  attended to it! Be ruthless! Use them, work them&mdash;sweat them to death!
  Keep away from messes and parades; seek no praise, for you will get none in
  any case! Work! Work for what is coming!"</p>

  <p>"You speak as though the fate of a continent were hanging in the balance,"
  laughed Cunningham, shaking hands with him.</p>

  <p>"I speak truth!" said Mohammed Gunga, riding off and leaving the youngster
  wondering.</p>

  <p>Now, there was nothing much the matter with the men on either side, taken
  in the main, who hated one another on that far-pushed frontier. Even the
  insufferable incompetents who held the rotting reins of control were such
  because circumstance had blinded them. There was not a man among the highly
  placed ones even who would have deliberately placed his own importance or his
  own opinion in the scale against India's welfare. There was not a border
  thief but was ready to respect what he could recognize as strong-armed
  justice.</p>

  <p>The root of the trouble lay in centralization of authority, and rigid
  adherence to the rule of seniority. Combined, these two processes had served
  to bring about a state of things that is nearly unbelievable when viewed in
  the light of modern love for efficiency. Young men, with the fire of ambition
  burning in them and a proper scorn for mere superficial ceremony, had to
  sweat their tempers and bow down beneath the yoke of senile pompousness.</p>

  <p>Strong, savage, powder-weaned Hill-tribesmen&mdash;inheritors of egoistic
  independence and a love of loot&mdash;laughed loud and long and openly at the
  system that prevented officers from taking arms against them until authority
  could come by delegate from somebody who slept. By that time they would be
  across the border, quarreling among themselves about division of the
  plunder!</p>

  <p>They had respect in plenty for the youth and virile middle age that dealt
  with them on the rare occasions when a timely blow was loosed. Then they had
  proof that from that strange, mad country overseas there came men who could
  lead men&mdash;men who could strike, and who knew enough to hold their hands
  when the sudden blow had told&mdash;just men, who could keep their plighted
  word. No border thief pretended that the British could not rule him; to a
  man, they laughed because the possible was not imposed. And to the last bold,
  ruffianly iconoclast they stole when, where, and what they dared.</p>

  <p>Things altered strangely soon after Ralph Cunningham, with the diffidence
  of youth but the blood of a line of soldiers leaping in him, took charge of
  his tiny force of nondescripts. They were neither soldiers nor police.
  Nominally, he was everybody's dog, and so were they; actually he found
  himself at the head of a tiny department of his own, because it was nobody's
  affair to give him orders. They had deliberately turned him loose "to hang
  himself," and their hope that he might get his head into a noose of trouble
  as soon as possible&mdash;the very liberty they gave him, on purpose for his
  quick damnation&mdash;was the means of making reputation for him.</p>

  <p>Nobody advised him; so with singularly British phlegm and not more than
  ordinary common sense he devised a method of his own for scotching night-
  prowlers. He stationed his men at well-considered vantage-points, and trusted
  them. With a party of ten, he patrolled the city ceaselessly himself and
  whipped every "watchman" he caught sleeping. One by one, the blackmailing
  brigade began to see the discomfort of a job that called for real
  wakefulness, and deserted over the Hills to urge the resumption of raids in
  force. One by one, the night-prowling fraternity were shot as they sneaked
  past sentries. One by one, the tale of robberies diminished. It was merely a
  question of one man, and he awake, having power to act without first
  submitting a request to somebody in triplicate on blue-form B.</p>

  <p>The time came, after a month or two, when even natives dared to leave
  their houses after dark. The time came very soon, indeed, when the nearest
  tribes began to hold war councils and inveigh against the falling off of the
  supply of plunder. Cunningham was complimented openly. He was even praised by
  one of "Them." So it was perfectly natural, and quite in keeping with
  tradition, that he should shortly be relieved, and that a senior to him
  should be placed in charge of his little force, with orders to "organize"
  it.</p>

  <p>The organization process lasted about twelve hours; at the end of that
  time every single man had deserted, horse and arms! Two nights later, the
  prowling and plundering was once more in full swing, and Cunningham was
  blamed for it; it was obvious to any man of curry-and-port-wine proclivities
  that his method, or lack of it, had completely undermined his men's
  loyalty!</p>

  <p>A whole committee of grey-headed gentlemen took trouble to point out to
  him his utter failure; but a brigadier, who was not a member of that
  committee, and who was considered something of an upstart, asked that he
  might be appointed to a troop of irregular cavalry that had recently been
  raised. With glee&mdash;with a sigh of relief so heartfelt and unanimous that
  it could be heard across the street&mdash;the committee leaped at the
  suggestion. The proper person was induced without difficulty to put his
  signature to the required paper, and Cunningham found himself transferred to
  irregular oblivion. Incidentally he found himself commanding few less than a
  hundred men, so many of whose first names were Mohammed or Mahomet that the
  muster-roll looked like a list of Allah's prophets.</p>

  <p>Cunningham was more than a little bit astonished, on the day he joined, in
  camp, a long way from Peshawar, to find his friend Mohammed Gunga, seated in
  a bell tent with the Brigadier. He caught sight of the long black military
  boot and silver spur, and half-recognized the up-and-down movement of the
  crossed leg long before he reached the tent. It was like father and son
  meeting, almost, as the Rajput rose to greet him and waited respectfully
  until he had paid his compliments to his new commander. Cunningham felt
  throat-bound, and could scarcely more than stammer his introduction of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I know who you are and all about you," said the Brigadier. "Used to know
  your father well. I applied to have you in my command partly for your
  father's sake, but principally because Risaldar Mohammed Gunga spoke so
  highly of you. He tells me he has had an eye on you from the start, and that
  you shape well. Remember, this is irregular cavalry, and in many respects
  quite unlike regulars. You'll need tact and a firm hand combined, and you
  mustn't ever forget that the men whom you will lead are gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Cunningham reported to his Colonel, only to discover that he, too, knew
  all about him. The Colonel was less inclined to be restricted as to topic,
  and less mindful of discretion than the Brigadier.</p>

  <p>"I hear they couldn't stand you in Peshawar. That's hopeful! If you'd come
  with a recommendation from that quarter, I'd have packed you off back again.
  I never in my life would have believed that a dozen men could all shut their
  eyes so tightly to the signs&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>"The signs, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the signs! Come and look your troop over."</p>

  <p>Cunningham found that the troop, too, had heard about his coming. He did
  not look them over. When he reached the lines, they came out in a swarm
  &mdash;passed him one by one, eyed him, as traders eye a horse&mdash;and then
  saluted him a second time, with the greeting:</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! You're in disgrace!" said his Colonel, noticing the color rising to
  the youngster's cheeks.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"

  <p class="poem">Sons of the sons of war we be,<br>
  Sabered and horsed, and whole and free;<br>
  One is the caste, and one degree,&mdash;<br>
  One law,&mdash;one code decreed us.<br>

  He who dare is he who may!<br>
  Now, rede ye who shall lead us!</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE check that Ralph Cunningham's management of his police
  had caused, and the subsequent resumption of night looting, served to whet
  the appetites of the hungry crowd beyond the border. Those closest to
  Peshawar, who had always done the looting, were not the ultimate consignees
  by any means; there were other tribes who bought from them&mdash;others yet
  to whom they paid tribute in the shape of stolen rifles. Cunningham's
  administration had upset the whole modus vivendi of the lower Himalayas!</p>

  <p>Though it all began again the moment he was superseded, there had been,
  none the less, a three-month interregnum, and that had to be compensated for.
  The tribes at the rear were clamorous and would not listen to argument or
  explanation; they had collected in hundreds, led by the notorious Khumel
  Khan, preparatory to raiding in real earnest and with sufficient force to
  carry all before them at the first surprise attack.</p>

  <p>They were disappointed when the pilfering resumed, for a tribal Hillman
  would generally rather fight than eat, and would always prefer his dinner
  from a dead enemy's cooking-pot. They sat about for a long time, considering
  whether there were not excuse enough for war in any case and listening to the
  intricately detailed information brought by the deserting watchmen. And as
  they discussed things, but before they had time to decide on any plan, the
  Brigadier commanding the Irregulars got wind of them.</p>

  <p>He was a man who did not worry about the feelings of senile heads of red-
  tape-bound departments; nor was he particularly hidebound by respect for the
  laws of evidence. When he knew a thing, he knew it; then he either acted or
  did not act, as the circumstances might dictate. And when the deed was done
  or left undone, and was quite beyond the reach of criticism, he would send in
  a verbose, voluminous report, written out in several colored inks, on all the
  special forms be could get hold of. The heads of departments would be too
  busy for the next twelvemonth trying to get the form of the report
  straightened out to be able to give any attention to the details of it; and
  then it would be too late. But he was a brigadier, and what he could do with
  impunity and quiet amusement would have brought down the whole Anglo-Indian
  Government in awful wrath on the head of a subordinate.</p>

  <p>He heard of the tribesmen under Khumel Khan one evening. At dawn his tents
  stood empty and the horse-lines were long bands of brown on the green grass.
  The pegs were up; only the burying beetles labored where the stamping
  chargers had neighed overnight.</p>

  <p>The hunger-making wind that sweeps down, snow-sweetened, from the
  Himalayas bore with it intermittent thunder from four thousand hoofs as,
  split in three and swooping from three different directions, the squadrons
  viewed, gave tongue, and launched themselves, roaring, at the half-awakened
  plotters of the night before.</p>

  <p>There was a battle, of a kind, in a boulder-lined valley where the early
  morning sun had not yet reached to lift the chill. Long lances&mdash; devils'
  antennae&mdash;searched out the crevices where rock-bred mountain-men sought
  cover; too suddenly for clumsy-fingered Hillmen to reload, the reformed
  troops charged wedgewise into rallying detachments. In an hour, or less,
  there were prisoners being herded like cattle in the valley bottom, and a
  sting had been drawn from the border wasp that would not grow again for a
  year or two to come.</p>

  <p>But Khumel Khan was missing. Khumel Khan, the tulwar-man*&mdash;he whose
  boast it was that he could hew through two men's necks at one whistling sweep
  of his notched, curved scimitar&mdash;had broken through with a dozen at his
  back. He had burst through the half-troop guarding the upper end of the
  defile, had left them red and reeling to count their dead, and the
  overfolding hill-spurs swallowed him.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>tulwar, talwar</i>&mdash;a type of saber from Mogul
  India dating back to at least the 17th century. In what was called Hindustan
  this became by far the most popular choice of sword. In outline it bears a
  resemblance to the Persian shamshir and the Turkish kilic; however, the blade
  of a talwar is wider in the ricasso than a shamshir, and will taper less
  toward the point. It also has a less extreme curve in the 28-30 inch blade.

  <p>"Mr. Cunningham! Take your troop, please, and find their chief! Hunt him
  out, ride him down, and get him! Don't come back until you do!"</p>

  <p>The real thing! The real red thing within a year! A lone command&mdash;
  and that is the only thing a subaltern of spunk may pray for!&mdash;eighty-
  and-eight hawk-eyed troopers asking only for the opportunity to show their
  worth&mdash;lean, hungry hills to hunt in, no commissariat, fair law to the
  quarry, and a fight&mdash;as sure as God made mountains, a fight at the other
  end! There are men here and there who think that the day when they pass down
  a crowded aisle with Her is the great one. Other great days are all as
  gas-jets to the sun. And there are others. There are men, like Cunningham,
  who have heard the drumming of the hoofs behind them as they led their first
  un-apron-stringed unit out into the unknown. The one kind of man has tasted
  honey, but the other knows what fed, and feeds, the roaring sportsmen in
  Valhalla.</p>

  <p>There were criss-cross trails, where low-hung clouds swept curtainwise to
  make the compass seem like a lie-begotten trick. There were gorges, hewn when
  the Titans needed dirt to build the awful Himalayas&mdash;shadow-darkened
  &mdash;sheer as the edge of Nemesis. Long-reaching, pile on pile, the over-
  lapping spurs leaned over them. The wind blew through them amid silence that
  swallowed and made nothing of the din which rides with armed men.</p>

  <p>But, with eyes that were made for hunting, on horses that seemed part of
  them, they tracked and trailed&mdash;and viewed at last. Their shout gave
  Khumel Khan his notice that the price of a hundred murders was overdue, and
  he chose to make payment where a V-shaped cliff enclosed a small, flat
  plateau and not more than a dozen could ride at him at a time. His companions
  scattered much as a charge of shrapnel shrieks through the rocks, but Khumel
  Khan knew well enough that he was the quarry&mdash;his was the head that by
  no conceivable chance would be allowed to plan fresh villainies. He might
  have run yet a little way, but he saw the uselessness, and stood.</p>

  <p>The troop, lined out knee to knee, could come within a hundred paces of
  him without breaking; it formed a base, then, to a triangle from which the
  man at bay could no more escape than a fire-ringed scorpion.</p>

  <p>"Call on him to surrender!" ordered Cunningham.</p>

  <p>A chevroned black-beard half a horse-length behind him translated the
  demand into stately Pashtu, and for answer the hill chieftain mounted his
  stolen horse and shook his tulwar. He had pistols at his belt, but he did not
  draw them; across his shoulder swung a five-foot-long jezail,* but he loosed
  it and flung it to the ground.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>jezail</i> (Pashtun)&mdash;an Afghan matchlock or
  flintlock musket (an un-rifled long gun) fired from a forked rest.
  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezail">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Is there any here dare take me single-handed?" he demanded with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>Of the eight-and-eighty, there were eighty-eight who dared; but there was
  an eighty-ninth, a lad of not yet twenty-two, whom Indian chivalry desired to
  honor. The troop had heard but the troop had not yet seen.</p>

  <p>"Ride in and take him!" ordered Cunningham and there was a thoroughly well
  acted make-believe of fear, while every eye watched "Cunnigan-bahadur," and
  the horses, spurred and reined at once, pranced at their bits for just so
  long as a good man needs to make his mind up. And Cunningham rode in.</p>

  <p>He rode in as a Rajput rides, with a swoop and a swinging saber and a
  silent, tight-lipped vow that he would prove himself. Green though he was
  yet, he knew that the troop had found for him&mdash;had rounded up for him
  &mdash;had made him his opportunity; so he took it, right under their eyes,
  straight in the teeth of the stoutest tulwar man of the lower Himalayas.</p>

  <p>He, too, had pistols at his belt, but there was no shot fired. There was
  nothing but a spur-loosed rush and a shock&mdash;a spark-lit, swirling,
  slashing, stamping, snorting melee&mdash;a stallion and a mare up-ended
  &mdash;two strips of lightning steel that slit the wind&mdash;and a thud, as
  a lifeless border robber took the turf.</p>

  <p>There was silence then&mdash;the grim, good silence of Mohammedan
  approval&mdash;while a native officer closed up a sword-cut with his fingers
  and tore ten-yard strips from his own turban to bind the youngster's head.
  They rode back without boast or noise and camped without advertisement. There
  was no demonstration made; only-a colonel said, "I like things done that way,
  quickly, without fuss," and a brigadier remarked, "Hrrrumph! 'Gratulate you,
  Mr. Cunningham!"</p>

  <p>Later, when they camped again outside Peshawar, a reward of three thousand
  rupees that had been offered on the border outlaw's head was paid to
  Cunningham in person&mdash;a very appreciable sum to a subaltern, whose pay
  is barely sufficient for his mess bills. So, although no public comment was
  made on the matter, it was considered "decent of him" to contribute the whole
  amount to a pension fund for the dependents of the regiment's dead.</p>

  <p>"You know, that's your money," said his Colonel. "You can keep every anna*
  of it if you choose."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>anna</i>&mdash;a copper coin worth 1/16th of a
  rupee formerly used in India, Pakistan and parts of Africa. For more
  information see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee">Rupee</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"I suppose I needn't be an officer unless I choose?" suggested
  Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, youngster! I can't guess what your troop would do if you
  tried to desert it!"</p>

  <p>That was, of course, merely a diplomatic recognition of the fact that
  Cunningham had done his duty in making his men like him, and was not intended
  seriously. Nobody&mdash;not even the Brigadier&mdash;had any notion that the
  troop would very shortly have to dispense with its leader's services whether
  it wanted to or not.</p>

  <p>But it so happened that one troop at a time was requisitioned to be
  ornamental body-guard to such as were entitled to one in the frontier city;
  and the turn arrived when Cunningham was sent. None liked the duty. No
  soldier, and particularly no irregular, likes to consider himself a
  pipe-clayed ornament; but Cunningham would have "gone sick" had he had the
  least idea of what was in store for him.</p>

  <p>It was bad enough to be obliged to act as body-guard to men who had
  jockeyed him away because they were jealous of him. The white scar that ran
  now like a chin-strap mark from the corner of his eye to the angle of his jaw
  would blaze red often at some deliberately thought-out, not fancied, insult
  from men who should have been too big to more than notice him. And that,
  again, was nothing to the climax.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga chose to polish up his silver spurs and ride in from his
  "estates" on a protracted visit to Peshawar, and with an escort that must
  have included half the zamindars on the countryside as well as his own small
  retinue. Glittering on his own account like a regiment of horse, and with all
  but a regiment clattering behind him, he chose the occasion to meet
  Cunningham when the youngster was fuming with impatience opposite the club
  veranda, waiting to escort a general.</p>

  <p>On the veranda sat a dozen men who had been at considerable pains to put
  and keep the officer of the escort in his place. If the jingle and glitter of
  the approaching cavalcade had not been sufficient to attract their notice,
  they could have stopped their ears and yet have been forced to hear the
  greeting.</p>

  <p>"Aha! Salaam sahib! Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur, bohut salaam! Thy father's
  son! Sahib, I am much honored!"</p>

  <p>The white scar blazed, but Mohammed Gunga affected not to notice the
  discomfort of his victim. Many more than a hundred sabered gentlemen pressed
  round to "do themselves the honor," as they expressed it, of paying
  Cunningham a compliment. They rode up like knights in armour in the lists,
  and saluted like heralds bringing tribute and allegiance.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Chota-Cunnigan!"</p>

  <p>"Salaam, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Bohut salaam, bahadur!"</p>

  <p>The Generals, the High-Court judges, and Commissioners on the club veranda
  sat unhonored, while a boy of twenty-two received obeisance from men whose
  respect a king might envy. No Rajput ever lived who was not sure that his
  salute was worth more than tribute; he can be polite on all occasions, and
  what he thinks mere politeness would be considered overacting in the West,
  but his respect and his salute he keeps for his equals or his betters&mdash;
  and they must be men indeed.</p>

  <p>The coterie of high officials sat indignation-bound for ten palpitating
  minutes, until the General remembered that it was his escort that was waiting
  for him. He had ordered it an hour too soon, for the express sweet purpose of
  keeping Cunningham waiting in the sun, but it dawned now on his apoplectic
  consciousness that his engagement was most urgent. He descended in a pompous
  hurry, mounted and demanded why&mdash;by all the gods of India&mdash;the
  escort was not lined up to receive him. A minute later, after a loudly
  administered reprimand that was meant as much for the swarm of Rajputs as for
  the indignant Cunningham, he rode off with the escort clattering behind
  him.</p>

  <p>But on the club veranda, when the Rajputs with Mohammed Gunga had
  dispersed, the big wigs sat and talked the matter over very thoroughly.</p>

  <p>"It's no use blinking matters," said the senior man present, using a huge
  handkerchief to wave the flies away from the polished dome which rose between
  two side wisps of grey hair. "They're going to lionize him while he's here,
  so we'd better move him on."</p>

  <p>"But where?"</p>

  <p>"I've got it! There's a letter in from Everton at Abu, saying he needs a
  man badly to go to Howrah and act resident there&mdash;says he hasn't heard
  from the missionaries and isn't satisfied&mdash;wants a man without too much
  authority to go there and keep an eye on things in general. Howrah's a hell
  of a place from all accounts."</p>

  <p>"But that 'ud be promotion!"</p>

  <p>"Can't be helped. No excuse for reducing him, so far as I've heard. The
  trouble is the cub has done too dashed well. We've got to promote him if we
  want to be rid of him."</p>

  <p>They talked it over for an hour, and at the end of it decided Cunningham
  should go to Howrah, provided a brigadier could be induced without too much
  argument to see reason.</p>

  <p>"The Brigadier probably wants to keep him, and his Colonel will raise all
  the different kinds of Cain there are!" suggested the man who had begun the
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"I've seen brigadiers before now reduced to a proper sense of their own
  unimportance!" remarked another man. And he was connected with the Treasury.
  He knew.</p>

  <p>But a week later, when the papers were sent to the Brigadier for
  signature, he amazed everybody by consenting without the least objection.
  Nobody but he knew who his visitor had been the night before.</p>

  <p>"How did you know about it, Mohammed Gunga?" he demanded, as the veteran
  sat and faced him over the tent candle, his one lean leg swaying up and down,
  as usual, above the other.</p>

  <p>"Have club servants not got ears, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I, too, have ears&mdash;good ones!"</p>

  <p>The Brigadier drummed his fingers on the table, hesitating. No officer,
  however high up in the service, likes to lose even a subaltern from his
  command when that subaltern is worth his salt.</p>

  <p>"Let him go, sahib! You have seen how we Rangars honor him&mdash;you may
  guess what difference he might make in a crisis. Sign, sahib&mdash;let him
  go!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;where do you come in? What have you had to do with this?"</p>

  <p>"First, sahib, I tested him thoroughly. I found him good. Second, I told
  tales about him, making him out better than even he is. Third, I made sure
  that all those in authority at Peshawar should hate him. That would have been
  impossible if he had been a fool, or a weak man, or an incompetent; but any
  good man can be hated easily. Fourth, sahib, I sent, by the hand of a man of
  mine, a message to Everton-sahib at Abu reporting to him that it was not in
  Howrah as it should be, and warning him that a sahib should be sent there. I
  knew that he would listen to a hint from me, and I knew that he had no one in
  his office whom he could send. Then, sahib, I brought matters to a head by
  bringing every man of merit whom I could raise to salute him and make an
  outrageous exhibition of him. That is what I have done!"</p>

  <p>"One would think you were scheming for a throne, Mohammed Gunga!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib, I am scheming for the peace of India! But there will be war
  first."</p>

  <p>"I know there will be war," said the Brigadier. "I only wish I could make
  the other sahibs realize it."</p>

  <p>"Will you sign the paper, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will sign the paper. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite certain that I'm doing right."</p>

  <p>"Brigadier-sahib, when the hour comes&mdash;and that is soon&mdash;it will
  be time to answer that! There lie the papers."</p>

  <p class="poem">Even in darkness lime and sand<br>
  Will blend to make up mortar.<br>
  Two by two would equal four<br>
  Under a bucket of water.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOW it may seem unimaginable that two Europeans could be
  cooped in Howrah, not under physical restraint, and yet not able to
  communicate with any one who could render them assistance. It was the case,
  though, and not by any means an isolated case. The policy of the British
  Government, once established in India, was and always has been not to occupy
  an inch of extra territory until compelled by circumstances.</p>

  <p>The native states, then, while forbidden to contract alliances with one
  another or the world outside, and obliged by the letter of written treaties
  to observe certain fundamental laws imposed on them by the Anglo-Indian
  Government, were left at liberty to govern themselves. And it was largely the
  fact that they could and did keep secret what was going on within their
  borders that enabled the so-called Sepoy Rebellion* to get such a smoldering
  foothold before it burst into a blaze. The sepoys were the tools of the men
  behind the movement; and the men behind were priests and others who were
  feeling nothing but their own ambition.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sepoy Rebellion</i> a revolt of the sepoy (native)
  troops in British India (1857-59), resulting in the transfer of the
  administration of India from the East India Company to the Crown. Also called
  Sepoy Mutiny, Indian Mutiny. For more information, see the article <a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/65/in/IndianMu.html">Indian Mutiny</a> in the
  <i><u>Columbia Encyclopedia</u></i>. ]</p>

  <p>No man knows even now how long the fire of rebellion had been burning
  underground before it showed through the surface; but it is quite obvious
  that, in spite of the heroism shown by British and loyal native alike when
  the crash did come, the rebels must have won&mdash;and have won easily by
  sheer weight of numbers&mdash;had they only used the amazing system solely
  for the broad, comprehensive purpose for which it was devised.</p>

  <p>But the sense of power that its ramifications and extent gave birth to
  also whetted the desires of individuals. Each man of any influence at all
  began to scheme to use the system for the furtherance of his individual
  ambition. Instead of bending all their energy and craft to the one great
  object of hurling an unloved conqueror back whence he came, each reigning
  prince strove to scheme himself head and shoulders above the rest; and each
  man who wanted to be prince began to plot harder than ever to be one.</p>

  <p>So in Howrah the Maharajah's brother, Jaimihr, with a large following and
  organization of his own, began to use the secret system of which he by right
  formed an integral part and to set wheels working within the wheels which in
  course of time should spew him up on the ledge which his brother now
  occupied. Long before the rebellion was ready he had all his preparations
  made and waited only for the general conflagration to strike for his own
  hand. And was so certain of success that he dared make plans as well for
  Rosemary McClean's fate.</p>

  <p>There is a blindness, too, quite unexplainable that comes over whole
  nations sometimes. It is almost like a plague in its mysterious arrival and
  departure. As before the French Revolution there were almost none of the
  ruling classes who could read the writing on the wall, so it was in India in
  the spring of '57. Men saw the signs and could not read their meaning. As in
  France, so in India, there were a few who understood, but they were scoffed
  at; the rest&mdash;the vast majority who held the reins of power&mdash; were
  blind.</p>

  <p>Rosemary McClean discovered that her pony had gone lame, and was angry
  with the groom. The groom ran away, and she put that down to native
  senselessness. Duncan McClean sent one after another of the little native
  children to find him a man who would take a letter to Mount Abu. The children
  went and did not come back again, and he put that down to the devil, who
  would seem to have reclaimed them.</p>

  <p>Both of them saw the watchers, posted at every vantage-point, insolently
  wakeful; both of them knew that Jaimihr had placed them there. But neither of
  them looked one inch deeper than the surface, nor supposed that their
  presence betokened anything but the prince's unreachable ambition. Neither of
  them thought for an instant that the day could possibly have come when
  Britain would be unable to protect a woman of its own race, or when a native
  &mdash;however powerful&mdash;would dare to do more than threaten.</p>

  <p>Joanna disappeared, and that led to a chain of thought which was not
  creditable to any one concerned. They reasoned this way: Rosemary had seen
  Mohammed Gunga hold out a handful of gold coins for the old woman's eyes to
  glitter at, therefore it was fair to presume that he had promised her a
  reward for bringing word to the man whom, it was now known, he had left
  behind. She had brought word to him and had disappeared. What more obvious
  than to reason that the man had gladly paid her, and had just as gladly
  ridden off, rejoicing at the thought that he could escape doing service?</p>

  <p>"So much," they argued, "for native constancy! So much for Mohammed
  Gunga's boast that he knew of men who could be trusted! And so much for
  Joanna's gratitude!"</p>

  <p>The old woman had been saved by Rosemary McClean from the long-drawn-out
  hell that is the life portion of most Indian widows, even of low caste; she
  had had little to do, ever, beyond snooze in the shade and eat, and run
  sometimes behind the pony&mdash;a task which came as easily to her as did the
  other less active parts of her employment. Her desertion, particularly at a
  crisis, made Rosemary McClean cry, and set her father to quoting
  Shakespeare's "King Lear."</p>

  <p class="poem">"Blow, blow, thou winter wind! Thou art not so unkind<br>
  As man's ingratitude!"</p>

  <p>All Scotsmen seem to have a natural proclivity for quoting the appropriate
  dirge when sorrow shows itself. The Book of Lamentations&mdash; Shakespeare's
  sadder lines&mdash;roll off their tongues majestically and seem to give them
  consolation&mdash;as it were to lay a sound, unjoyous basis for the proper
  enjoyment of the songs of Robbie Burns.</p>

  <p>The poor old king of the poet's imagining, declaiming up above the cliffs
  of Dover, could have put no more pathos into those immortal lines than did
  Duncan McClean as he paced up and down between the hot walls of the darkened
  room. The dry air parched his throat, and his ambition seemed to shrivel in
  him as he saw the brave little woman who was all he had sobbing with her head
  between her hands.</p>

  <p>He turned to the Bible, but he could find no precedent in any of its pages
  for abandoning a quest like his in the teeth of disaster or adversity. He
  read it for hour after crackling hour, moistening his throat from time to
  time with warm, unappetizing water from the improvised jar filter; but when
  the oven blast that makes the Indian summer day a hell on earth had waned and
  died away, he had found nothing but admonishment to stand firm. There had
  been women, too, whose deeds were worthy of record in that book, and he found
  no argument for deserting his post on his daughter's account either. In the
  Bible account, as he read it, it had always been the devil who fled when
  things got too uncomfortable for him, and he was conscious of a tight-lipped,
  stern contempt for the devil.</p>

  <p>He had about made up his mind what line to take with his daughter, when
  she ceased her sobbing and looked up through swollen eyes to relieve him of
  the necessity for talking her over to his point view. What she said amazed
  him, but not because it came to him as a new idea. She said, in different
  words, exactly what was passing in his own mind, and it was as though her
  tears and his search of the Scriptures had brought them both to one clear-cut
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Why are we here, father?" she asked him suddenly; and because she took
  him by surprise he did not answer her at once. "We are here to do good aren't
  we?" That was no question; it was the beginning of a line of argument. Her
  father held his tongue, and laid his Bible down, and listened on. "How much
  good have we done yet?"</p>

  <p>She paused, but the pause was rhetorical, and he knew it; he could see the
  light behind her eyes that was more than visionary; it was the light of
  practical Scots enthusiasm, unquenched and undiscouraged after a battle with
  fear itself. She began to be beautiful again as the spirit of unconquerable
  courage won its way.</p>

  <p>"Have we won one convert? Is there one, of those you have taught who is
  with us still?"</p>

  <p>The answer was self-evident. There was none. But there was no sting for
  him in what she asked. Rather her words came as a relief, for he could feel
  the strength behind them. He still said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Have we stopped one single suttee? Have we once, in any least degree,
  lessened the sufferings of one of those poor widows?"</p>

  <p>"Not once," he answered her, without a trace of shame. He knew, and she
  knew, how hard the two of them had tried. There was nothing to apologize
  for.</p>

  <p>"Have we undermined the power of the Hindu priests? Have we removed one
  trace of superstition?"</p>

  <p>"No," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Have we given up the fight?"</p>

  <p>He looked hard at her. Gray eyes under grey brows met grey eyes that shone
  from under dark, wet lashes, and deep spoke unto deep. Scotsman recognized
  Scotswoman, and the bond between them tightened.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me"&mdash;there was a new thrill in her voice&mdash;"that
  here is our opportunity! Either Jaimihr wants to frighten us away or he is in
  earnest with his impudent attentions to me. In either case let us make no
  attempt to go away. Let us refuse to go away. Let us stay here at all costs.
  If he wishes us to go away, then he must have a reason and will show it, or
  else try to force us. If he is really trying to make love to me, then let him
  try; if he has pluck enough, let him seize me. In either case we shall force
  his hand. I am willing to be the bait. The moment that he harms either you or
  me, the government will have to interfere. If he kills us so much the better,
  for that would mean swift vengeance and a British occupation. That would stop
  suttee for all time, and we would have given our lives for something worth
  while. As we are, we cannot communicate with our government, and Jaimihr
  thinks he has us in his grasp. Let him think it! Let him go ahead! Sooner or
  later the government must find out that we are missing Then&mdash;!" Her eyes
  blazed at the thought of what would happen then.</p>

  <p>Her father looked at her for about a minute, sadness and pride in her
  fighting in him for the mastery. Then he rose and crossed the little space
  between them.</p>

  <p>"Lassie!" he said. "Lassie!"</p>

  <p>She took his hand&mdash;the one little touch of human sentiment lacking to
  disturb his emotional balance. The Scots will talk readily enough of sorrow,
  but at showing it they are a grudging race of men. Unless a Scotsman thinks
  he can gain something for his cause by showing what emotion racks him, he
  will swallow down the choking flood of grief, and keep a straight face to the
  world and his own as well. Duncan McClean turned from her&mdash;drew his hand
  away&mdash;and walked to open the slit shutters. A moment later he came back,
  once more master of himself.</p>

  <p>"As things are, dear," he said gently, "how would it be possible for us to
  get away?"</p>

  <p>"'We canna gang awa'!" she quoted, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"No, lassie. We must stay here and be brave. This matter is not in our
  hands. We must wait, and watch, and see. If opportunity should come to us to
  make our escape, we will seize it. Should it not come&mdash;should Jaimihr,
  or some other of them, make occasion to molest us&mdash;it may be&mdash; it
  might be that&mdash;surely the day of martyrs is not past&mdash;it might be
  that&mdash;well, well, in either case we will eventually win. Should they
  kill us, the government must send here to avenge us; should we get away,
  surely our report will be listened to. A month or two&mdash; perhaps only a
  week or two&mdash;even a day or two, who knows?&mdash;and the last suttee
  will have been performed!"</p>

  <p>He stood and stroked her head&mdash;then stooped and kissed it&mdash; an
  unusual betrayal of emotion from him.</p>

  <p>"Ye're a brave lassie," he said, leaving the room hurriedly, to escape the
  shame of letting her see tears welling from his eyes&mdash;salt tears that
  scalded as they broke their hot-wind-wearied bounds.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later she arose, dry-eyed, and went to stand in the doorway,
  where an eddy or two of lukewarm evening breeze might possibly be stirring.
  But a dirtily clad Hindu, lounging on a raised, railless store veranda
  opposite, leered at her impudently, and she came inside again&mdash;to pass
  the evening and the sultry, black, breathless night out of sight, at least,
  of the brutes who shut her off from even exercise.</p>

  <p class="poem">So, I am a dog? Hence I must come<br>
  To do thy bidding faster?<br>
  Must tell thee&mdash;Nay, a dog stays dumb!<br>
  A dog obeys one master!</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOT many yards from where the restless elephants stood lined
  under big brick arches&mdash;in an age-old courtyard, three sides of which
  were stone-carved splendor and the fourth a typically Eastern mess of
  stables, servants' quarters, litter, stink, and noisy confusion&mdash;a stone
  door, slab-hewn, gave back the aching glitter of the sun. Its only
  opening&mdash; a narrow slit quite near the top&mdash;was barred. A
  man&mdash;his face close-pressed against them&mdash;peered through the
  interwoven iron rods from within.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr, in a rose-pink puggree still, but not at all the swaggering
  cavalier who pranced, high-booted, through the streets&mdash;a down-at-heel
  prince, looking slovenly and heavy-eyed from too much opium&mdash;sat in a
  long chair under the cloister which faced the barred stone door. He swished
  with a rhino riding-whip at the stone column beside him, and the much-swathed
  individual of the plethoric paunch who stood and spoke with him kept a very
  leery eye on it; he seemed to expect the binding swish of it across his own
  shins, and the thought seemed tantalizing.</p>

  <p>"It is not to be done," said Jaimihr, speaking in a dialect peculiar to
  Howrah. "That&mdash;of all the idiotic notions I have listened to&mdash; is
  the least worth while! Thy brains are in thy belly and are lost amid the fat!
  If my brother Howrah only had such counsellors as thou&mdash;such monkey folk
  to make his plans for him&mdash;the jackals would have finished with him long
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, did I not bring word, and overhear, and trap the man?"</p>

  <p>"Truly! Overheard whisperings, and trapped me a hyena I must feed! Now
  thou sayest, 'Torture him!' He is a Rangar, and of good stock; therefore, no
  amount of torturing will make him speak. He is that pig Mohammed Gunga's man;
  therefore, there' is nothing more sure than that Mohammed Gunga will be here,
  sooner or later, to look for him&mdash;Mohammed Gunga, with the half of a
  Hindu name, the whole of a Moslem's fire, and the blind friendship of the
  British to rely on!"</p>

  <p>"But if the man be dead when Mohammed Gunga comes?"</p>

  <p>"He will be dead when Mohammed Gunga comes, if only what we await has
  first happened. But this rising that is planned hangs fire. Were I Maharajah
  I would like to see the Rangar who dare flout me or ask questions! I would
  like but to set eyes on that Rangar once! But I am not yet Maharajah; I am a
  prince&mdash;a younger brother&mdash;surrounded, counselled, impeded,
  hampered, rendered laughable by fat idiots!"</p>

  <p>"My belly but shows your highness's generosity. At whose cost have I grown
  fat?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, at whose cost? I should have kept thee slim, on prison diet, and
  saved myself a world of useless problems! Cease prattling! Get away from me!
  If I have to poison this Ali Partab, or wring his casteless neck, I will make
  thee do it, and give thee to Mohammed Gunga to wreak vengeance on. Leave me
  to think!"</p>

  <p>The fat former occupant of the room above the arch of the caravansary
  waddled to the far end of the cloister, and sat down, cross-legged, to
  grumble to himself and scratch his paunch at intervals. His master,
  low-browed and irritable, continued to strike the stone column with his cane.
  He was in a horrid quandary.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga was one of many men he did not want, for the present, to
  offend seriously. Given a fair cause for quarrel, that irascible ex-Risaldar
  was capable of going to any lengths, and was known, moreover, to be trusted
  by the British. Nobody seemed to know whether or not Mohammed Gunga
  reciprocated the British regard, and nobody had cared to ask him except his
  own intimates; and they, like he, were men of close counsel.</p>

  <p>The Prince had given no orders for the capture of Ali Partab; that had
  been carried out by his men in a fit of ill-advised officiousness. But the
  Prince had to solve the serious problem caused by the presence of Ali Partab
  within a stone-walled cell.</p>

  <p>Should he let the fellow go, a report would be certain to reach Mohammed
  Gunga by the speediest route. Vengeance would be instantly decided on, for a
  Rajput does not merely accept service; he repays it, feudal-wise, and smites
  hip and thigh for the honor of his men. The vengeance would be sure to follow
  purely Eastern lines, and would be complicated; it would no doubt take the
  form of siding in some way or other with his brother the Maharajah. There
  would be instant, active doings, for that was Mohammed Gunga's style! The fat
  would be in the fire months, perhaps, before the proper time.</p>

  <p>The prisoner's presence was maddening in a million ways. It had been the
  Prince's plan (for he knew well enough that Mohammed Gunga had left a man
  behind) to allow the escape to start; then it would have been an easy matter
  to arrange an ambush&mdash;to kill Ali Partab&mdash;and to pretend to ride to
  the rescue. Once rescued, Miss McClean and her father would be almost
  completely at his mercy, for they would not be able to accuse him of anything
  but friendliness, and would be obliged to return to whatever haven of safety
  he cared to offer them. Once in his palace of their own consent, they would
  have had to stay there until the rising of the whole of India put an end to
  any chance of interference from the British Government.</p>

  <p>But now there was no Ali Partab outside to try to escort them to some
  place of safety; therefore, there was little chance that the missionaries
  would try to make a bolt. Instead of being in the position of a cat that
  watches silently and springs when the mouse breaks cover, he was in the
  unenviable condition now of being forced to make the first move. Over and
  over again he cursed the men who had made Ali Partab prisoner, and over and
  over again he wondered how&mdash;by all the gods of all the multitudinous
  Hindu mythology&mdash;how, when, and by what stroke of genius he could make
  use of the stiff-chinned Rangar and convert him from being a rankling thorn
  into a useful aid.</p>

  <p>He dared not poison him&mdash;yet. For the same reason he dared not put
  him to the torture, to discover, or try to discover, what Mohammed Gunga's
  real leanings were in the matter of loyalty to the Raj or otherwise. He dared
  not let the man go, for forgiveness is not one of the virtues held in high
  esteem by men of Ali Partab's race, and wrongful arrest is considered ground
  enough for a feud to the death. It seemed he did not dare do anything!</p>

  <p>He racked his opium-dulled brain for a suspicion of a plan that might help
  solve the difficulty, until his eye&mdash;wandering around the courtyard
  &mdash;fell on the black shape of a woman. She was old and bent and she was
  busied, with a handful of dry twigs, pretending to sweep around the
  stables.</p>

  <p>"Who is that mother of corruption?" demanded Jaimihr; and a man came
  running to him.</p>

  <p>"Who is that eyesore? I have never seen her, have I?"</p>

  <p>"Highness, she is a beggar woman. She sat by the gate, and pretended to a
  power of telling fortunes&mdash;which it would seem she does possess in some
  degree. It was thought better that she should use her gift in here, for our
  advantage, than outside to our disadvantage. So she was brought in and set to
  sweeping."</p>

  <p>"By the curse of the sin of the sack of Chitor, is my palace, then, a
  midden for the crawling offal of all the Howrah streets? First this Rangar
  &mdash;next a sweeper hag&mdash;what follows? What bring you next? Go, fetch
  the street dogs in!"</p>

  <p>"Highness, she is useful and costs nothing but the measure or two of meal
  she eats."</p>

  <p>"A horse eats little more!" the angry Prince retorted, perfectly
  accustomed to being argued with by his own servants. That is the time-honored
  custom of the East; obedience is one thing&mdash;argument another&mdash; both
  in their way are good, and both have their innings. "Bring her to me
  &mdash;nay!&mdash;keep her at a decent distance&mdash;so!&mdash;am I dirt for
  her broom?"</p>

  <p>He sat and scowled at her, and the old woman tried to hide more of her
  protruding bones under the rag of clothing that she wore; she stood,
  wriggling in evident embarrassment, well out in the sun.</p>

  <p>"What willst thou steal of mine?" the Prince demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I am no thief." Bright, beady eyes gleamed back at him, and gave the lie
  direct to her shrinking attitude of fear. But he had taken too much opium
  overnight, and was in no mood to notice little distinctions. He was satisfied
  that she should seem properly afraid of him, and he scowled angrily when one
  of his retainers&mdash;in slovenly undress&mdash;crossed the courtyard to
  him. The man's evident intention, made obvious by his manner and his leer at
  the old woman, was to say something against her; the Prince was in a mood to
  quarrel with any one, on any ground at all, who did not cower to him.</p>

  <p>"Prince, she it is who ran ever with the white woman, as a dog runs in the
  dust."</p>

  <p>"What does she here, then?"</p>

  <p>"Ask her!" grinned the trooper. "Unless she comes to look for Ali Partab,
  I know not."</p>

  <p>He made the last part of his remark in a hurried undertone, too low for
  the old woman to hear.</p>

  <p>"Let her earn her meal around the stables," said the Prince. A sudden
  light dawned on him. Here was a means, at least, of trying to make use of Ali
  Partab. "Go&mdash;do thy sweeping!" he commanded, and the hag slunk off.</p>

  <p>For ten minutes longer, Jaimihr sat still and flicked at the stone column
  with his whip,&mdash;then he sent for his master of the horse, whose mistaken
  sense of loyalty had been the direct cause of Ali Partab's capture. He had
  acted instantly when the fat Hindu brought him word, and he had expected to
  be praised for quick decision and rewarded; he was plainly in high dudgeon as
  he swaggered out of a dark door near the stables and advanced sulkily toward
  his master.</p>

  <p>"Remove the prisoner from that cell, taking great care that the hag yonder
  sees what you do&mdash;yes, that hag&mdash;the new one; she is a spy. Bring
  the prisoner in to me, where I will talk with him; afterwards place him in a
  different cell&mdash;put him where we kept the bear that died&mdash; there is
  a dark comer beside it, where a man might hide; hide a man there when it
  grows dark. And give the hag access. Say nothing to her; let her come and go
  as she will; watch, and listen."</p>

  <p>Without another word, the Prince got up and shuffled in his decorated
  slippers to a door at one end of the cloister. Five minutes later Ali Partab
  &mdash;high-chinned, but looking miserable&mdash;was led between two men
  through the same door, while the old woman went on very ostentatiously with
  her sweeping about the yard. She even turned her back, to prove how little
  she was interested.</p>

  <p>Ali Partab was hustled forward into a high-ceilinged room, whose light
  came filtered through a scroll-work mesh of chiseled stone where the wall and
  ceiling joined. There were no windows, but six doors opened from it, and
  every one of them was barred, as though they opened into treasure-vaults. The
  Prince sat restlessly in a high, carved wooden chair; there was no other
  furniture at all, and Ali Partab was left standing between his guards. The
  Prince drew a pistol from inside his clothing.</p>

  <p>"Leave us alone!" he ordered; and the guards went out, closing the door
  behind them.</p>

  <p>"I gave no orders for your capture," said Jaimihr, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Then, let me go," grinned Ali Partab.</p>

  <p>"First, I must be informed on certain matters."</p>

  <p>Ali Partab still grinned, but the muscles of his face changed their
  position slightly, and it took no expert in physiognomy to read that
  questions he would answer must be very tactfully asked.</p>

  <p>"Ask on!"</p>

  <p>"You are Mohammed Gunga's man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is an honorable service."</p>

  <p>"Did he order you to stay here?"</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;in this palace? Allah forbid!"</p>

  <p>"Did he order you to stay in Howrah?"</p>

  <p>"He gave me certain orders. I obeyed them until your men invited swift
  death for themselves and you by interfering with me!"</p>

  <p>"What were the orders?"</p>

  <p>Ali Partab grinned again&mdash;this time insolently.</p>

  <p>"To make sure that the Jaimihr-sahib did not make away with the treasure
  of his brother Howrah!" he answered.</p>

  <p>"If you were released now what would you proceed to do?"</p>

  <p>"To obey my orders."</p>

  <p>Jaimihr changed his tactics and assumed the frequently successful legal
  line of pretending to know far more than he really did.</p>

  <p>"I am told by one who overheard you speak that you were to take the
  missionary and his daughter to Alwa's place. How much is my brother Howrah
  paying for Mohammed Gunga's services in this matter? It is well known that he
  and Alwa between them could call out all the Rangars in the district for
  whichever side they chose. Since they are not on my side, they must be for
  Howrah. How much does he pay? I might offer more."</p>

  <p>"I know not," said Ali Partab, perfectly ready to admit anything that was
  not true.</p>

  <p>"It is true, then, that Howrah has designs on the missionary's daughter?
  Alwa is to keep her prisoner until the great blow is struck, and Howrah dare
  take possession of her?"</p>

  <p>"That is not my business," answered Ali Partab, with the air of a man who
  knew all of the secret details but would not admit it. Jaimihr began to think
  that he had lit at random on the answer to the riddle.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mohammed Gunga?"</p>

  <p>"I know not."</p>

  <p>"At Alwa's place?"</p>

  <p>"Am I God that I should know where any man is whom I cannot see?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! So he is at Alwa's, eh?" That overdose of opium had rendered
  Jaimihr's brain very dull indeed; he considered himself clever, and
  overlooked the fact that Ali Partab would be almost surely lying to him. In
  India men never tell the truth to chance-met strangers or to their enemies;
  the truth is a valuable thing, to be shared cautiously among friends.</p>

  <p>"If Mohammed Gunga is at Alwa's," reasoned Jaimihr, "then he is much too
  close at hand to take any chances with. I must keep this man close confined."
  He raised his voice in a high-pitched command, and the guards opened the door
  instantly; at a sign from the Prince they seized Ali Partab by the
  wrists.</p>

  <p>"I will send a message to Mohammed Gunga for thee," said Jaimihr. "On his
  answer will depend your release or otherwise." He nodded. The guards took
  their prisoner out between them&mdash;led him past the wrinkled old woman in
  the courtyard&mdash;and halted him in a far corner, where an evil-smelling
  cage of a place stood open to receive him. A moment later, in order to make
  sure, the master of the horse sent for the old woman and made her sweep out
  the cell a little; then he drove her away with a fierce injunction not to let
  herself be caught anywhere near the cell again unless ordered. Following the
  line of eastern reasoning, had he not given that order he would not have
  known what her object could be should she make her way toward the cell; but
  now, if she risked his wrath by disobeying, he would know beyond the least
  shadow of a doubt that she had a message to deliver to the prisoner&mdash;the
  man who was hidden in the dark corner need entertain no hope of keeping the
  secret to himself for purposes of sale or blackmail!</p>

  <p>They trust each other wonderfully&mdash;with an almost childlike
  confidence&mdash;in a household such as Jaimihr's!</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER 15</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Ho! I am king! All lesser fry<br>
  Must cringe, and crawl, and cry to me,<br>
  And none have any rights but I,&mdash;<br>
  Except the right to lie to me.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JAIMIHR was not the only man who would have dearly liked to
  know of the whereabouts of Mohammed Gunga. It had been reported to Maharajah
  Howrah, by his spies, that the redoubtable ex-Risaldar of horse had visited
  his relatives in Howrah City, and, though he had not been able to ascertain a
  word of what had passed, he was none the less anxious.</p>

  <p>He knew, of course&mdash;for every soul in Howrah knew&mdash;that Jaimihr
  was plotting for the throne. He knew, too, that the priests of Siva, who with
  himself were joint keepers of the wickedly won, tax-swollen treasure, had
  sounded Jaimihr; they had tentatively hinted that they might espouse his
  cause, provided that an equitable division of the treasure were arranged
  beforehand. The question uppermost in Maharajah Howrah's mind was whether the
  Rangars&mdash;the Moslem descendants of once Hindu Rajputs, who formed such a
  small but valuable proportion of the local population&mdash; could or could
  not be induced to throw in their lot with him.</p>

  <p>No man on the whole tax-ridden countryside believed or considered it as a
  distant possibility that the Rangars would strike for any hand except their
  own; they were known, on the other hand, to be more or less cohesive, and it
  was considered certain that, whichever way they swung, when the priest-pulled
  string let loose the flood of revolution, they would swing all together. The
  question, then, was how to win the favor of the Rangars. It was not at all an
  easy question, for the love lost between Hindus and Mohammedans is less than
  that between dark-skinned men and white&mdash;a lot less.</p>

  <p>Within two hours of its happening he had been told of the capture of Ali
  Partab; and he knew&mdash;for that was another thing his spies had told him
  &mdash;that Ali Partab was Mohammed Gunga's man. Apparently, then, Ali
  Partab&mdash;a prisoner in Jaimihr's palace-yard&mdash;was the only
  connecting link between him and the Rangars whom he wished to win over to his
  side. He was as anxious as any to help overwhelm the British, but he
  naturally wished to come out of the turmoil high and dry himself, and he was,
  therefore, ready to consider the protection of individual British subjects if
  that would please the men whom he wanted for his friends.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga was known to have carried letters for the missionaries. He
  was known to have engaged a new servant when he rode away from Howrah and to
  have left his trusted man behind. Miss McClean was known to have conversed
  with the retainer, immediately after which the man had been seized and
  carried off by Jaimihr's men. Jaimihr was known to have placed watchers round
  the mission house and&mdash;once&mdash;to have killed a man in Miss McClean's
  defence. The deduction was not too far-fetched that the retainer had been
  left as a protection against Jaimihr, and consequently that the Rangars, at
  the behest of Mohammed Gunga, had decided&mdash;on at least the white girl's
  safety.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he argued, if he now proceeded to protect the McCleans, he
  would, at all events, not incur the Rangars' enmity.</p>

  <p>It was a serious decision that he had to make, for, for one thing, he
  dared not yet make any move likely to incite his strongly supported brother
  to open rebellion; he dared not, therefore, interfere at present with the
  watchers near the mission house. To openly befriend the Christian priests
  would be to set the whole Hindu population against himself, for it had been
  mainly against suttee and its kindred horrors that the missionaries had bent
  all their energy.</p>

  <p>The great palace of Howrah was ahum. Elephants with painted tusks, and
  loaded to the groaning-point under howdahs decked with jewels and gold-leaf,
  came and went through the carved entrance-gates. Occasionally camels, loaded
  too until their legs all but buckled underneath them, strutted with their
  weird, mixed air of foolishness and dignity, to be disburdened of great cases
  that eight men could scarcely lift; on the outside the cases were marked
  "Hardware," but a horde of armed and waiting malcontents scattered about the
  countryside could have given a more detailed and accurate guess at what was
  in them.</p>

  <p>Men came and went&mdash;men almost of all castes and many nationalities.
  Priests&mdash;not all of them fat, but every single one fat-smiling
  &mdash;sunned themselves, or waited in the shade until they could have
  audience; no priest of any Hindu temple had to wait long to be admitted to
  that Rajah's presence, and there was an everlasting chain of them, each with
  his axe to grind, coming and going by day and night.</p>

  <p>Color rioted in the blazing sun and deep, dark shadows lurked in all the
  thousand places where the sun could never penetrate. It was India in essence
  &mdash;noise and blaze and flouted splendor, with a back-ground and
  underground of mystery. Any but the purblind British could have told at half
  a glance, merely by the attitude of Howrah's armed sepoys, that a concerted
  movement of some kind was afoot&mdash;that there was a tight-held thread of
  plan running through the whole confusion; but no man&mdash;not even a
  native&mdash;could have guessed what secret plotting might be going on within
  the acres of the straggling palace.</p>

  <p>From the courtyard there was no least hint obtainable even of the
  building's size; its shape could only have been marked down from a bird's-eye
  view aloft. Even the roof was so uneven, and so subdivided by traced and
  deep-carved walls and ramparts, that a sentry posted at one end could not
  have seen the next man to him, perhaps some twenty feet away. Building had
  been piled on building&mdash;other buildings had been added end to end and
  criss-crosswise&mdash;and each extension had been walled in as new centuries
  saw new additions, until the many acres were a maze of bricks and stone and
  fountain-decorated gardens that no lifelong palace denizen could have learned
  to know in their entirety.</p>

  <p>Within&mdash;one story up above the courtyard din&mdash;in a spacious,
  richly decorated room that gave on to a gorgeous roof-garden, the Maharajah
  sat and let himself be fanned by women, who were purchasable for perhaps a
  tenth of what any of the fans had cost. Another woman, younger than the rest,
  played wild minor music to him on an instrument not much unlike a flute; they
  were melancholy notes&mdash;beautiful&mdash;but sad enough to sow pessimism's
  seed in any one who listened.</p>

  <p>His divan&mdash;carved, inlaid, and gilded&mdash;faced the wide,
  awning-hung opening to the garden. Round him on all three sides was a carved
  stone screen through whose interstices came rustlings and whisperings that
  told of the hidden life which sees and is not seen. The women with the fans
  and flute were mere court accessories; the real nerves of Asia&mdash;the
  veiled intriguers whom none may know but whose secret power any man may feel
  &mdash;could be heard like caged birds crowding on their perches.</p>

  <p>Now and then glass bracelets tinkled from behind the screen; ever and
  again the music stopped, until another girl appeared to play another
  melancholy air. But the even purring of the fans went on incessantly, and the
  poor, priest-ridden fool who owned it all scowled straight in front of him,
  his brows lined deep in thought.</p>

  <p>It is a strange malady, that which seizes men whom fate has elevated to a
  throne. It acts as certain Indian drugs are known to do&mdash;deprives its
  victim of the power to act, but intensifies his ability to think, and
  theorize, and feel. Howrah, with untold treasure in his vaults, with an army
  of five thousand men, with the authority and backing that a hundred
  generations give, could long for more&mdash;could fear the loss of what he
  did have&mdash;but could not act.</p>

  <p>The priests held him fear-bound. His brother held him hate-bound. His
  women&mdash;and not even he knew, probably, how many of them languished in
  the secret warren inside those palace walls&mdash;kept him restless in a net
  of this-and-that-way-tugged intrigue. Flattery&mdash;and that is by far the
  subtlest poison of the East&mdash;blinded him utterly to his own best course,
  and kept him blind. Luxury unmanned him; he who had once held the straightest
  spear in western India, and for the love of feeling red blood racing in his
  veins had ridden down panthers on the maidan,* was flabby now; deep, dark
  rings underlined his eyes and the once steel-sinewed wrist trembled.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>maidan</i> (Hindi and Persian)&mdash;an open space,
  as for military exercises, or for a market place; an open grassy tract; an
  esplanade. <i><a href=
  "http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=maidan">Webster's Revised
  Unabridged Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>His brother Jaimihr in his place, unsapped yet by decadent delights, would
  have loosed his five thousand on the countryside&mdash;butchered any who
  opposed him&mdash;pressed into service those who merely lagged&mdash;and
  would have plunged India in a welter of blood before the priests had time to
  mature their plans and arrange to keep all the power and plunder to
  themselves. But Jaimihr had to stalk lesser game and content himself with
  pricking at the ever-growing hate that gradually rendered the Maharajah
  decisionless and sorry only for himself.</p>

  <p>A first glimpse at Howrah, particularly in the shaded room, showed a
  handsome man, black-bearded, lean, and lithe; a second look, undazzled by his
  jewelry or by the studied magnificence of each apparently unstudied movement,
  betrayed a man whose lightest word was law, but who feared to give the word.
  Where muscles had been were unfilled folds of skin that shook; where a firm
  if selfish mouth had once smiled merrily beneath a pointed black moustache, a
  mouth still smiled, but meanly; the selfishness was there, but the firmness
  had faded.</p>

  <p>His eyes, though, were his most marked feature. They were hungry eyes,
  pathetic as a caged beast's and as savage. No one could see them without
  pitying him, and no man in his senses would have accepted their owner's word
  on any point at all. A man looks as he did when the fire of a burning veldt
  has circled him and there is no way out. There was fear behind them, and the
  look of restless search for safety that is nowhere.</p>

  <p>In one of the many-columned courtyards of the palace was a chained, mad
  elephant whose duty was to kneel on the Rajah's captive enemies. In another
  courtyard was a big, square tank with a weedy, slippery stone ramp at one
  end; in the tank were alligators; down the ramp other of the Rajah's enemies,
  tight-bound, would scream and struggle and slide from time to time. But they
  were only little enemies who died in that way; the greater ones, who had
  power or influence, lived on and plotted, because the owner of the execution
  beasts was afraid to put them to their use.</p>

  <p>Below, in damp, unlit dungeons, there were silken cords suspended from
  stone ceilings; their ends were noosed, and the nooses hung ten feet above
  the floor; those told only, though, of the fate of women who had schemed
  unwisely&mdash;favorites of a week, perhaps, who had dared to sulk, listeners
  through screens who had forgotten to forget. No men died ever by the silken
  cord, and no tales ever reached the outside world of who did die down in the
  echoing brick cellars; there was a path that led underground to the alligator
  tank and a trap-door that opened just above the water's edge. Night, and the
  fungus-fouled long jaws, and slimy, weed-filled water&mdash; the creak of
  rusty hinges&mdash;a splash&mdash;the bang of a falling trap &mdash;a swirl
  in the moonlit water, and ring after heavy, widening ring that lapped at last
  against the stone would write conclusion to a tragedy. There would be no
  record kept.</p>

  <p>Howrah was childless. That, of all the hell-sent troubles that beset him,
  was the worst. That alone was worse than the hoarded treasure whose secret he
  and his brother and the priests of Siva shared. Only in India could it happen
  that a line of Rajahs, drag-net-armed&mdash;oblivious to the duties of a king
  and greedy only of the royal right to tax&mdash;could pile up, century by
  century, a hoard of gold and jewels&mdash;to be looked at. The secret of that
  treasure made the throne worth plotting for&mdash;gave the priests, who
  shared the secret, more than nine tenths of their power for blackmail,
  pressure, and intrigue&mdash;and grew, like a cancer, into each succeeding
  Rajah's mind until, from a man with a soul inside him he became in turn a
  heartless, fear ridden miser.</p>

  <p>Any childless king is liable to feel the insolent expectancy betrayed by
  the heir apparent. But Jaimihr&mdash;who had no sons either&mdash;was an heir
  who understood all of the Indian arts whereby a man of brain may hasten the
  succession. Worry, artfully stirred up, is the greatest weapon of them all,
  and never a day passed but some cleverly concocted tale would reach the
  Rajah, calculated to set his guessing faculties at work.</p>

  <p>Either of the brothers, when he happened to be thirsty, would call his
  least-trusted counsellor to drink first from the jeweled cup, and would watch
  the man afterwards for at least ten minutes before daring to slake his
  thirst; but Jaimihr had the moral advantage of an aspirant; Howrah, on the
  defensive, wilted under the nibbling necessity for wakefulness, while Jaimihr
  grinned.</p>

  <p>What were five thousand drilled, armed men to a king who feared to use
  them? Of what use was a waiting countryside, armed if not drilled, if he was
  not sure that his brother had not won every man's allegiance? Being Hindu,
  priest-reared, priest-fooled, and priest-flattered, he knew, or thought he
  knew, to an anna the value he might set on Hindu loyalty or on the loyalty of
  any man who did not stand to gain in pocket by remaining true; and, as many
  another fear-sick tyrant has begun to do, he turned, in his mind at least, to
  men of another creed&mdash;which in India means of another race,
  practically-wondering whether he could not make use of them against his
  own.</p>

  <p>Like every other Rajah of his line, he longed to have sole control of that
  wonderful treasure that had eaten out his very manhood. Miser though he was,
  he was prepared at least to bargain with outsiders with the promise of a
  portion of it, if that would give him possession of it all. He had learned
  from the priests who took such full advantage of him an absolute contempt for
  Mohammedans; and their teaching, as well as his own trend of character, made
  him quite indifferent to promises he might make, for the sake of diplomacy,
  to men of another creed. It began to be obvious to him that he would lose
  nothing by courting the favor of the Rangars, and of Alwa in particular, and
  that he might win security by coaxing them to take his part. Of one thing he
  was certain: the Rangars would do anything at all, if by doing it they could
  harm the Hindu priests.</p>

  <p>But, being of the East Eastern, and at that Hindu, he could not have
  brought himself to make overtures directly and go straight to the real issue.
  He had to feel his way gingerly. The thousand horses in his stables, he
  reflected, would mount a thousand of the Rangars and place at his disposal a
  regiment of cavalry which would be difficult to beat; but a thousand mounted
  Mohammedans might be a worse thorn in his side than even his brother or the
  priests. He decided to write to Alwa, but to open negotiations with a very
  thin and delicately inserted wedge.</p>

  <p>He could write. The priests had overlooked that opportunity, and had
  taught him in his boyhood; in that one thing he was their equal. But the
  other things that they had taught him, too, offset his penmanship. He was too
  proud to write&mdash;too lazy, too enamored of his dignity. He called a court
  official, and the man sat very humbly at his feet&mdash;listened meekly to
  the stern command to secrecy&mdash;and took the letter from dictation.</p>

  <p>Alwa was informed, quite briefly, that in view of certain happenings in
  Howrah City His Highness the Maharajah had considered it expedient to set a
  guard over the Christian missionaries in the city, for their safety. The
  accompanying horse was a gift to the Alwa-sahib. The Alwa-sahib himself would
  be a welcome guest whenever he might care to come.</p>

  <p>The document was placed in a silver tube and sealed. Within the space of
  half an hour a horseman was kicking up the desert dust, riding as though he
  carried news of life-and-death importance, and with another man and a led
  horse galloping behind him. Five minutes after the man had started, in a cell
  below the temple, of Siva, the court official who had taken down the letter
  was repeating it word for word to a congeries of priests. And one hour later
  still, in a room up near the roof of Jaimihr's palace, one of the priests
  &mdash;panting from having come so fast&mdash;was asking the Rajah's brother
  what he thought about it.</p>

  <p>"Did he say nothing?" asked Jaimihr.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sahib."</p>

  <p>The priest watched him eagerly; he would have to bear back to the other
  priests an exact account of the Prince's every word, and movement, and
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Then I, too, say nothing!" answered Jaimihr.</p>

  <p>"But to the priests of Siva, who are waiting, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Tell them I said nothing."</p>

  What if the dark have eyes as well?</p><br>

  <p class="first">BESIDE the reeking bear's cage in which Ali Partab stood and
  swore was a dark, low corner space in which at one time and another sacks and
  useless impedimenta had been tossed, to become rat-eaten and decayed. In
  among all the rubbish, cross-legged like the idol of the underworld, a nearly
  naked Hindu sat, prick-eared. He was quite invisible long before the sun went
  down, for that was the dingiest corner of the yard; when twilight came, he
  could not have been seen from a dozen feet away.</p>

  <p>Joanna, sweeping, sweeping, sweeping, in the courtyard, with her back very
  nearly always turned toward the cage, appeared to take no notice of the
  falling darkness; unlike the other menials, who hurried to their rest and
  evening meal, she went on working, accomplishing very little but seeming to
  be very much in earnest about it all. Very, very gradually she drew nearer to
  the cage. When night fell, she was within ten feet of it. A few lamps were
  lit then, here and there over doorways, but nobody appeared to linger in the
  courtyard; no footfalls resounded; nothing but the neigh of stabled horses
  and the chatter around the big, flat supper pans broke on the evening
  quiet.</p>

  <p>Joanna drew nearer. Ali Partab came forward to the cage bars, but said
  nothing; it was very dark inside the cage, and even the sharp-eyed old woman
  could not possibly have seen his gestures; when he stood, tight-pressed,
  against the bars she might have made out his dark shape dimly, but unless he
  chose to speak no signal could possibly have passed from him to her. He said
  nothing, though, and she&mdash;still sweeping, with her back toward him
  &mdash;passed by the cage, and stooped to scratch at some hard-caked dirt or
  other close to the rubbish hole where the Hindu waited. Still scratching,
  still working with her twig broom, still with her back toward the rubbish
  hole, she approached until the darkest shadow swallowed her.</p>

  <p>There were two in the dark then&mdash;she and the man who listened. He,
  motionless as stone, had watched her; peering outward at the lesser darkness,
  he lost sight of her for a second as she backed into the deepest shadow
  unexpectedly. Before he could become accustomed to the altered focus and the
  deeper black, her beady eyes picked out the whites of his. Before he could
  move she was on him&mdash;at his throat, tearing it with thin, steel fingers.
  Before he could utter a sound, or move, she had drawn a short knife from her
  clothing and had driven it to the hilt below his ear. He dropped without a
  gurgle, and without a sound she gathered up her broom again and swept her way
  back past the cage-bars, where Ali Partab waited.</p>

  <p>"Was any there?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"There was one."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"He was."</p>

  <p>"Good! Now will the reward be three mohurs instead of two!"</p>

  <p>"Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"These pigs have taken all the money from me. Now we must wait until
  Mohammed Gunga-sahib comes. His word is pledged."</p>

  <p>"He said two mohurs."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;Ali Partab&mdash;pledge his word for three."</p>

  <p>"And who art thou? The bear in the cage said: 'I will eat thee if I get
  outside!"'</p>

  <p>"Mother of corruption! Listen! Alwa must know! Canst thou escape from
  here? Canst thou reach the Alwa-sahib?"</p>

  <p>"If the price were four mohurs, there might be many things that I could
  do."</p>

  <p>"The price is three! I have spoken!"</p>

  <p>"'I would eat honey were I outside!' said the bear."</p>

  <p>"Hag! The bear died in the cage, and they sold his pelt for how much?
  Alive, he had been worth three mohurs, but he died while they bargained for
  him!&mdash;Quick!"</p>

  <p>"I am black, sahib, and the night is black. I am old, and none would
  believe me active. They watch the gates, but the bats fly in and out."</p>

  <p>"Find out, then, what has happened to my horses, left at the caravansary;
  give that information to the Alwa-sahib. Tell the Miss-sahib at the mission
  where I am. Tell her whither I have sent thee. Tell the Alwa-sahib that a
  Rangar&mdash;by name Ali Partab&mdash;sworn follower of the prophet, and
  servant of the Risaldar Mohammed Gunga&mdash;is in need and asks his instant
  aid. Say also to the Alwa-sahib that it may be well to rescue the Miss-sahib
  first, before he looks for me, but of that matter I am no judge, being
  imprisoned and unable to ascertain the truth. Hast thou understood?"</p>

  <p>"And all that for three mohurs?"</p>

  <p>"Nay. The price is now two mohurs again. It will be one unless
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Three, sahib! It was three!"</p>

  <p>"Then run! Hasten!"</p>

  <p>The shadows swallowed her again. She crept where they were darkest&mdash;
  lay still once, breathless, while a man walked almost over her&mdash; reached
  the outer wall, and felt her way along it until she reached low eaves that
  reached down like a jagged saw from utter blackness. Less than a minute later
  she was crawling monkeywise along a roof; before another five had passed she
  had dropped on all fours in the dust of the outer road and was running like a
  black ghost&mdash;head down&mdash;an end of her loin-cloth between her
  teeth&mdash;one arm held tight to her side and the other crooked outward,
  swinging&mdash;striding, panting, boring through the blackness.</p>

  <p>She wasted little time at the caravansary. The gate was shut and a sleepy
  watchman cursed her for breaking into his reverie.</p>

  <p>"Horses? Belonging to a Rangar? Fool! Does not the Maharajah-sahib impound
  all horses left ownerless? Ask them back of him that took them! Go,
  night-owl! Go ask him!"</p>

  <p>Almost as quickly as a native pony could have eaten up the distance, she
  dropped panting on the door-step of the little mission house. She was panting
  now from fright as well as sheer exhaustion. There were watchers&mdash;two
  sets of them. One man stood, with his back turned within ten paces of her,
  and another&mdash;less than two yards away from him&mdash;stood, turned half
  sideways, looking up the street and whistling to himself. There was not a
  corner or an angle of the little place that was not guarded.</p>

  <p>She had tried the back door first, but that was locked, and she had rapped
  on it gently until she remembered that of evenings the missionary and his
  daughter occupied the front room always and that they would not have heard
  her had she hammered. She tapped now, very gently, with her fingers on the
  lower panel of the door, quaking and trembling in every limb, but taking care
  to make her little noise unevenly, in a way that would be certain to attract
  attention inside. Tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap.
  Pause. Tap-tap. The door opened suddenly. Both watchers turned and gazed
  straight into the lamplight that streamed out past the tall form of Duncan
  McClean. He stared at them and they stared back again. Joanna slunk into the
  deep shadow at one side of the steps.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary for you to annoy me by rapping on my door as well as by
  spying on me?" asked the missionary in a tone of weary remonstrance.</p>

  <p>The guards laughed and turned their backs with added insolence. In that
  second Joanna shot like a black spirit of the night straight past the
  missionary's legs and collapsed in a bundle on the floor behind him.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door, sahib!" she hissed at him. "Quick! Shut the door!"</p>

  <p>He shut it and bolted it, half recognizing something in the voice or else
  guided by instinct.</p>

  <p>"Joanna!" he exclaimed, holding up a lamp above her. "You, Joanna!"</p>

  <p>At the name, Rosemary McClean came running out&mdash;looked for an
  instant&mdash;and then knelt by the old woman.</p>

  <p>"Father, bring some water, please, quickly!"</p>

  <p>The missionary went in search of a water-jar, and Rosemary McClean bent
  down above the ancient, shriveled, sorry-looking mummy of a woman&mdash; drew
  the wrinkled head into her lap&mdash;stroked the drawn face&mdash; and wept
  over her. The spent, age-weakened, dried-out widow had fainted; there was no
  wakened self-consciousness of black and white to interfere. This was a
  friend&mdash;one lone friend of her own sex amid all the waste of smoldering
  hate&mdash;some one surely to be wept over and made much of and caressed. The
  poor old hag recovered consciousness with her head pillowed on a European
  lap, and Duncan McClean&mdash;no stickler for convention and no believer in a
  line too tightly drawn&mdash;saw fit to remonstrate as he laid the jar of
  water down beside them.</p>

  <p>"Why," she answered, looking up at him, "father, I'd have kissed a dog
  that got lost and came back again like this!"</p>

  <p>They picked her up between them, after they had let her drink, and carried
  her between them to the long, low sitting-room, where she told them&mdash;
  after considerable make-believe of being more spent than she really was
  &mdash;after about a tenth "sip" at the brandy flask and when another had
  been laughingly refused&mdash;all about Ali Partab and what his orders to her
  were.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what it all can mean?" McClean sat back and tried to summarize
  his experiences of months and fit them into what Joanna said.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?" asked his daughter, leaning forward. She was
  staring at Joanna's forearm and from that to a dull-red patch on the woman's
  loin-cloth. Joanna answered nothing.</p>

  <p>"Are you wounded, Joanna? Are you sure? That's blood! Look here,
  father!"</p>

  <p>He agreed that it was blood. It was dry and it came off her forearm in
  little flakes when he rubbed it. But not a word could they coax out of Joanna
  to explain it, until Rosemary&mdash;drawing the old woman to her&mdash;
  espied the handle of her knife projecting by an inch above the waist-fold of
  her cloth. Too late Joanna tried to hide it. Rosemary held her and drew it
  out. Beyond any shadow of a doubt, there was blood on the blade still, and on
  the wooden hilt, and caked in the clumsy joint between the hilt and
  blade.</p>

  <p>"'Joanna&mdash;have you killed any one?"</p>

  <p>Joanna shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the truth, Joanna. Whose blood is that?"</p>

  <p>"A dog's, Miss-sahib. A street dog attacked me as I ran hither."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could believe it!"</p>

  <p>"I too!" said her father, and he took Joanna to one side and cross-
  examined her. But he could get no admission from her&mdash;nothing but the
  same statement, with added details each time he made her tell it, that she
  had killed a dog.</p>

  <p>They fed her, and she ate like a hyena. No caste prejudices or forbidden
  foods troubled her; she ate whatever came her way, Hindu food, or Mohammedan,
  or Christian,&mdash;and reached for more&mdash;and finished, as hyenas
  finish, by breaking bones to get the marrow out. At midnight they left her,
  curled dogwise on a mat in the hall, to sleep; and at dawn, when they came to
  wake her, she was gone again&mdash;gone utterly, without a trace or sign of
  explanation. The doors, both front and back, were locked.</p>

  <p>It was two days later when they found a hole torn through the thatch,
  through which she had escaped; and though they searched the house from cellar
  up to roof, and turned all their small possessions over, they could not find
  (and they were utterly glad of it) that she had stolen anything.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" said the missionary.</p>

  <p>"I've finished disbelieving in Joanna!" said his daughter with a grimace
  that went always with irrevocable decision.</p>

  <p>"I've come to the conclusion," said McClean, "that there are more than
  just Joanna to be trusted. There is Ali Partab, and&mdash;who knows how
  many?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER 17</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Against all fear; against the weight of what,<br>
  For lack of worse name, men miscall the Law;<br>
  Against the Tyranny of Creed; against the hot,<br>
  Foul Greed of Priest, and Superstition's Maw;<br>
  Against all man-made Shackles, and a man-made Hell&mdash;<br>
  Alone&mdash;At last&mdash;Unaided&mdash;I REBEL!</p><br>

  <p class="first">NO single, individual circumstance, but a chain of
  happenings in very quick succession, brought about a climax, forcing the hand
  of Howrah and his brother and for the moment drawing the McCleans, father and
  daughter, into the toothed wheel of Indian action. As usual in India, the
  usual brought about the unexpected, and the unexpected fitted strangely into
  the complex, mysteriously worked-out whole.</p>

  <p>Two days after Joanna left the mission house, through a hole made in the
  thatch, the spirit of revolt took hold of Rosemary McClean again. The stuffy,
  narrow quarters&mdash;the insolent, doubled, unexplained, but very obvious,
  guard that lounged outside&mdash;the sense of rank injustice and
  helplessness&mdash;the weird feeling of impending horror added onto
  stale-grown ghastliness&mdash;youth, chafing at the lack of liberty&mdash;
  stirred her to action.</p>

  <p>Without a word to her father, who was writing reports that seemed endless
  at the little desk by the shaded window, she left the house&mdash;drew with a
  physical effort on all her reserve of strength and health&mdash;faced the
  scorching afternoon wind, as though it were a foe that could shrink away
  before her courage, and walked, since she had no pony now, in any direction
  in which chance or her momentary whim might care to lead her.</p>

  <p>"I won't cry again&mdash;and I won't submit&mdash;and I'll see what
  happens!" she told herself; and the four who followed her at a none-too-
  respectful distance&mdash;two of the Maharajah's men in uniform and two
  shabby-looking ruffians of Jaimihr's&mdash;grinned as they scented action.
  Like their masters they bore no love for one another; they were there now, in
  fact, as much to watch one another as the missionaries; they detected the
  possibility of an excuse to be at one another's throats, and gloated as they
  saw two messengers, one of either side, run off in a hurry to inform the
  rival camps.</p>

  <p>It was neither plan nor conscious selection that led Rosemary McClean
  toward the far end of the maidan, where the sluggish, narrow, winding Howrah
  River sucked slimily beside the burning ghats.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ghat</i>&mdash;a broad flight of steps on the bank
  of a river in India, used especially by bathers. <i><a href=

  Dictionary</a></i>, 4th edition. ]</p>

  <p>When she realized where her footsteps were leading her she would have
  turned in horror and retreated, for even a legitimately roasting corpse that
  died before the Hindu priests had opportunity to introduce it to the flames
  is no sight for eyes that are civilized.</p>

  <p>But, when she turned her head, the sight of her hurrying escort perspiring
  in her wake&mdash;(few natives like the heat and wind one whit better than
  their conquerors)&mdash;filled her with an unexpected, probably
  unjustifiable, determination not to let them see her flinch at any kind of
  horror. That was the spirit of sahibdom that is not always quite commendable;
  it is the spirit that takes Anglo-Saxon women to the seething, stenching
  plains and holds them there high-chinned to stiffen their men-folk by
  courageous example, but it leads, too, to things not quite so womanly and
  good.</p>

  <p>"I'll show them!" muttered Rosemary McClean, wiping the blown dust from
  her eyes and facing the wind again that now began to carry with it the
  unspread taint&mdash;the awful, sickening, soul-revolting smell inseparable
  from Hindu funeral rites. There were three pyres, low-smoldering, close by
  the river-bank, and men stirred with long poles among the ashes to make sure
  that the incineration started the evening before should be complete; there
  was one pyre that looked as though it had been lit long after dawn&mdash;
  another newly lit&mdash;and there were two pyres building.</p>

  <p>It was those two new ones that held her attention, and finally decided her
  to hold her course. She wanted to make sure. The smell of burning&mdash;the
  unoutlined, only guessed-at ghastliness&mdash;would probably have killed her
  courage yet, before she came close enough to really see; but the suspicion of
  a greater horror drew her on, as snakes are said to draw birds on, by merely
  being snakes, and with red-rimmed eyes smarting from smoke as well as wind
  she pressed forward.</p>

  <p>The ghats were deserted-looking, for the funeral rites of those who burned
  were practically over until the time should come to scatter ashes on the
  river-surface; only a few attendants hovered close to the fires to prod them
  and occasionally throw on extra logs. Only round the two new pyres not yet
  quite finished was anything approaching a crowd assembled, and there a priest
  was officiously directing the laying of the logs. It was the manner of their
  laying and the careful building of a scaffold on each side of either pyre
  that held Rosemary McClean's attention&mdash;called all the rebellious
  womanhood within her to interfere&mdash;and drew her nearer.</p>

  <p>Soon the priest noticed her&mdash;a cotton-skirted wraith amid the smoke
  &mdash;and shouted to the guards behind; one of them answered, laughing
  coarsely, and Rosemary understood enough of the dialect he used to grit her
  teeth with shame and anger. The men left off building, and, directed by the
  priest, came toward her in a ragged line to cut her off from closer approach;
  she stood, then&mdash;examined the new pyres as carefully as she could
  &mdash;walked to another vantage-point and viewed them sideways&mdash;then
  turned her back.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the brutes!" she ejaculated. There were tears in her voice, as well
  as helpless anger. "There is not one devil, there are a million, and they all
  live here!"</p>

  <p>She looked back again once, trembling with an overmastering hate, directed
  less at the priest who grinned back at her than at the loathsome rite he
  represented. In two actual words, she cursed him. It was the first time she
  had ever cursed anybody in her life, and the wickedness of doing it swept
  over her as a relief. She reveled in it. She was glad she had cursed him. Her
  little, light, graceful body that had been quivering grew calm again, and she
  turned to hurry home with an unexpected sense of having pulled some lever in
  the mechanism that would bring about results. She neither knew nor cared what
  results, nor how they were to happen; she felt that that curse of hers, her
  first, had landed on the mark!</p>

  <p>But she had come further than she thought. Distance, hot wind, and emotion
  had exhausted her far more, too, than she had had time to realize. Before a
  mile of the homeward journey had been accomplished, she was forced against
  her stubborn Scots will to sit down on a big stone by the roadside and rest,
  while the four that followed came up close, grinning and passing remarks in
  anything but under-tones. If the meaning of the words escaped her, their
  gestures left little to be misunderstood. A crowd of stragglers drew together
  near the four&mdash;laughed with them&mdash;took sides in the coarse-worded
  argument about Jaimihr's known ambition&mdash;and shamed her into pressing on
  homeward.</p>

  <p>But she was forced to rest again, and then again. Physical sickness
  prevented her from obeying instinct, reason, will, that all three urged her
  on. No false pride now told her to dare the insolence of the guards; nothing
  appealed to her but the desire to hurry, hurry, hurry, and do whatever should
  appear to need doing when she reached the mission house. She had no plan in
  her head. She only knew that she had cursed a man, and that the curse was
  potent. But her feet dragged, and her vitality died down. It was sundown when
  she reached the mission house, and she could hear the rising, falling,
  intermittent din of drums before she saw her father in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Father!" She ran to him, and he caught her in his arms to save her from
  falling headlong. "Father, there is going to be a suttee tonight! Hear the
  drums, father! Hear the drums! It'll be tonight! That's to stop the screams
  from being heard! Listen to them, father&mdash;two suttees, side by side
  &mdash;I've seen the pyres and the scaffolds&mdash;do they jump into the
  flames, father, from the scaffolds?&mdash;tell me! No-don't tell me&mdash; I
  won't listen! Take me away from here&mdash;away&mdash;away&mdash;away
  &mdash;take me away, d'you hear!"</p>

  <p>He carried her inside, and laid her on the caned couch in the living-
  room, looking like a great, big, helpless, grey-haired baby, as any man is
  prone to do when he has hysteria to deal with in a woman whom he loves.</p>

  <p>"I cursed a man, father! I cursed a man! I did! I said 'Damn you!' I'm
  glad!"</p>

  <p>"Don't, little girl&mdash;don't! Lassie mine, don't! Never mind what you
  saw or what you said&mdash;be calm now&mdash;there is something we must do;
  we must act; I have determined we must act. We must act tonight. But we can't
  do anything with you in this state."</p>

  <p>Slowly, gradually he calmed her&mdash;or probably she grew calm, in spite
  of his attentions, for he was too upset himself to exercise much soothing
  sway over anybody else. At last, though, she fell into a fitful sleep, and he
  sat beside her, holding rigid the left hand that she clutched, letting it
  stiffen and grow cold and numb for fear of waking her.</p>

  <p>Outside a full moon rose majestically, pure and silvery as peace herself,
  bathing the universe in blessings. And each month, when the full moon rose
  above the carved dome of Siva's temple, there was a ceremony gone through
  that commemorated cruelty, greed, poisoning, throat-slitting, hate, and all
  the hell-invented infamy that suckles always at the breast of stagnant
  treasure.</p>

  <p>Since history has forgotten when, at each full moon, the priests of Siva
  had gone with circumstantial ceremony to view the hoarded wealth tied up by
  jealousy and guarded jealously in Howrah's palace. With them, as the custom
  that was stronger than a thousand laws dictated, went the Maharajah and his
  brother Jaimihr&mdash;joint owners with the priests.</p>

  <p>There had not been one Maharajah, since the first of that long line, who
  would not have given the lives of ten thousand men for leave to broach that
  treasure; nor, since the first heir apparent shared the secret with the
  priests and the holder of the throne, had there been one prince in line
  &mdash;son-brother-cousin&mdash;who would not have drenched the throne with
  his relation's blood with that same purpose.</p>

  <p>Heir after heir could have agreed with Maharajah, but the priests had
  stood between. That treasure was their fulcrum; the legacy, dictated by a
  dead, misguided hand, intended as a war reserve to stay the throne of Howrah
  in its need, and trebly locked to guard against profligacy, had placed the
  priests of Siva in the position of dictators of Howrah's destiny. A word from
  them, and a prince would slay his father&mdash;only to discover that the
  promises of Siva's priests were something less to build on than the hope of
  loot. There would be another heir apparent to be let into the secret&mdash;
  another man to scheme and hunger for the throne&mdash;another party to the
  bloody three-angled intrigue which kept the Siva-servers fat and the princes
  lean.</p>

  <p>Past masters of the art by which superstitious ignorance is swayed, the
  priests could swing the allegiance of the mob whichever way they chose
  &mdash;even the soldiers, loyal enough to their masters under ordinary
  circumstances, would have rebelled at as much as a hint from holy Siva. It
  was the priests who made it possible for Jaimihr to dare take his part in the
  ceremony; without them he would not have entered his brother's palace-yard
  unless five thousand men at least were there to guard his back&mdash;but, if
  there was danger where the priests were, there was safety too.</p>

  <p>As the custom was, he rode to the temple of Siva first with a ten-man
  guard; there, when the priests had finished droning age-old anthems to the
  echoing roof, when his brother, the Maharajah, also with a ten-man guard, had
  joined him, and the two had submitted to the sanctifying rites prescribed,
  eleven priests would walk with them in solemn mummery to the palace-entrance
  &mdash;censer-swinging, chanting, blasphemously acting duty to their gods and
  state.</p>

  <p>The moon&mdash;and that, too, was custom&mdash;rested with her lower rim
  one full hand's breadth above the temple dome as viewed from the palace-
  gate, when a gong clanged resonantly, died to silence, music of pipes and
  cymbals broke on the evening quiet, and the strange procession started from
  the temple door, the Maharajah leading.</p>

  <p>Generally it passed uninterrupted over the intervening street to the
  palace-entrance, between the ranks of a salaaming, silent crowd, and
  disappeared from view. This time, though, for the first time in living
  memory, and possibly for the first time in all history, the unforeseen,
  amazing happened. The procession stopped. Moon-bathed, between the carved
  posts of the palace-gate, two people blocked the way.</p>

  <p>The music ceased. The sudden silence framed itself against the distant
  thunder of a hundred drums. The crowd&mdash;all heads bowed, as decreed
  &mdash;drew in its breath and held it. A sea of puggrees moved as brown eyes
  looked up surreptitiously&mdash;stared&mdash;memorized&mdash;and then looked
  down again. There was no precedent for this happening, and even the Maharajah
  and the priests were at a momentary loss&mdash;stood waiting,
  staring&mdash;and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Maharajah-sahib!&mdash;I must interrupt your ceremony. I must have word
  with you at once!"</p>

  <p>It was Duncan McClean, bareheaded, holding his daughter's hand. They had
  no weapons; they were messengers of peace, protesting, or so they looked. No
  longer timid, but resigned to what might happen&mdash;they held each other's
  hands, and blocked the way of Siva's votaries&mdash;Siva's tools &mdash;and
  Siva's ritual.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr whispered to his brother&mdash;the first time he had dared one
  word to him in person for years&mdash;the high priest of the temple pressed
  forward angrily, saying nothing, but trying to combine rage and dignity with
  an attempt to turn the incident to priestly advantage. Surely this was a
  crisis out of which the priests must come triumphant; they held all the cards
  &mdash;knew how and when rebellion was timed, and could compare, as the
  principals themselves could not do, Howrah's strength with Jaimihr's. And the
  priests had the crowd to back them&mdash;the ignorant, superstitious crowd
  that can make or dethrone emperors.</p>

  <p>But some strange freak of real dignity&mdash;curiosity perhaps, or
  possibly occasion&mdash;spurred the desire to act of his own initiative and
  keep the high priest in his place&mdash;impelled the Maharajah in that
  minute. Men said afterwards that Jaimihr had whispered to him advice which he
  knew was barbed because it was his brother whispering, and that he promptly
  did the opposite; but, whatever the motive, he drew himself up in all his
  jeweled splendor and demanded: "What do you people wish?"</p>

  <p>The McCleans were given no time to reply. The priests did not see fit to
  let the reins of this occasion slip; the word went out, panic-voiced, that
  sacrilege to Siva was afoot.</p>

  <p>"Slay them! Slay them!" yelled the crowd. "They violate the sacred
  rites!"</p>

  <p>There were no Mohammedans among that crowd to take delight in seeing Hindu
  priests discomfited and Hindu ritual disturbed. There came no counter-shout.
  The crowd did not, as so often happens, turn and rend itself; and yet, though
  a surge from behind pressed forward, the men in front pressed back.</p>

  <p>"Slay them! Slay the sacrilegious foreigners!" The yell grew louder and
  more widely voiced, but no man in the front ranks moved.</p>

  <p>The Maharajah looked from the company of guards that lined the palace-
  steps to the priests and his brother and the crowd&mdash;and then to the
  McCleans again.</p>

  <p>He remembered Alwa and his Rangars, thought of the messenger whom he had
  sent, remembered that a regiment of lance-armed horsemen would be worth a
  risk or two to win over to his side, and made decision.</p>

  <p>"You are in danger," he asserted, using a pronoun not intended to convey
  politeness, but&mdash;Eastern of the East&mdash;counteracting that by
  courtesy of manner. "Do you ask my aid?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, among other things," Duncan McClean answered him. "I wish also to
  speak about a Rangar, who I know is held prisoner in a cage in the Jaimihr-
  sahib's palace."</p>

  <p>"Speak of that later," answered Howrah. "Guard!"</p>

  <p>He made a sign. A spoken word might have told the priests too much, and
  have set them busy forestalling him. The guards rushed down the steps, seized
  both McCleans, and half-carried, half-hustled them up the palace-steps,
  through the great carved doors, and presently returned without them.</p>

  <p>"They are my prisoners," said the Maharajah, turning to the high priest.
  "We will now proceed."</p>

  <p>The crowd was satisfied, at least for the time being. Well versed in the
  kind of treatment meted out to prisoners, partly informed of what was
  preparing for the British all through India, the crowd never doubted for an
  instant but that grizzly vengeance awaited the Christians who had dared to
  remonstrate against time-honored custom. It looked for the moment as though
  the high priest's word had moved the Maharajah to order the arrest, and the
  high priest realized it. By skillful play and well-used dignity he might
  contrive to snatch all the credit yet. He ordered; the pipes and cymbals
  started up again at once; and, one by one&mdash;Maharajah, Jaimihr, high
  priest, then royal guard, Jaimihr's guard, priest again&mdash;the procession
  wound ahead, jeweled and egretted, sabered and spurred, priest-robed,
  representative of all the many cancers eating at the heart of India.</p>

  <p>Chanting, clanging, wailing minor dirges to the night, it circled all the
  front projections of the palace, turned where a small door opened on a
  courtyard at one side, entered, and disappeared.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER 18</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Oh, is it good, my soldier prince and is the wisdom
  clear,<br>
  To guard thy front a thousand strong, while ten may take thy rear?</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOW, because it was impregnable to almost anything except a
  yet-to-be- invented air-ship, the Alwa-sahib owned a fortress still,
  high-perched on a crag that overlooked a glittering expanse of desert. More
  precious than its bulk in diamonds, a spring of clear, cold water from the
  rock-lined depths of mother earth gushed out through a fissure near the
  summit, and round that spring had been built, in bygone centuries, a
  battlemented nest to breed and turn out warriors. Alwa's grandfather had come
  by it through complicated bargaining and dowry-contracts, and Alwa now held
  it as the rallying-point for the Rangars thereabouts.</p>

  <p>But its defensibility was practically all the crag fort had to offer by
  way of attraction. Down at its foot, where the stream of rushing water
  splashed in a series of cascades to the thirsty, sandy earth, there were an
  acre or two of cultivation&mdash;sufficient, in time of peace, to support an
  attenuated garrison and its horses. But for his revenues the Alwa-sahib had
  to look many a long day's march afield. Leagues of desert lay between him and
  the nearest farm he owned, and since&mdash;more in the East than
  anywhere&mdash;a landlord's chief absorption is the watching of his rents, it
  followed that he spent the greater part of his existence in the saddle,
  riding from one widely scattered tenant to another.</p>

  <p>It was luck or fortuitous circumstance&mdash;Fate, he would have called
  it, had he wasted time to give it name&mdash;that brought him along a road
  where, many miles from Howrah City, he caught sight of Joanna. Needless to
  say, he took no slightest notice of her.</p>

  <p>Dog-weary, parched, sore-footed, she was hurrying along the burning, sandy
  trail that led in the direction of Alwa's fort. The trail was narrow, and the
  horsemen whose mounts ambled tirelessly behind Alwa's plain-bred Arab pressed
  on past him, to curse the hag and bid her make horse-room for her betters.
  She sunk on the sand and begged of them. Laughingly, they asked her what a
  coin would buy in all that arid waste.</p>

  <p>"Have the jackals, then, turned tradesman?" they jeered; but she only
  mumbled, and displayed her swollen tongue, and held her hands in an attitude
  of pitiful supplication. Then Alwa cantered up&mdash;rode past&mdash; heard
  one of his men jeering&mdash;drew rein and wheeled.</p>

  <p>"Give her water!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>He sat and watched her while she knelt, face upward, and a Rangar poured
  lukewarm water from a bottle down her tortured throat. He held it high and
  let the water splash, for fear his dignity might suffer should he or the
  bottle touch her. Strictly speaking, Rangars have no caste, but they retain
  by instinct and tradition many of the Hindu prejudices. Alwa himself saw
  nothing to object to in the man's precaution.</p>

  <p>"Ask the old crows' meat whither she was running."</p>

  <p>"She says she would find the Alwa-sahib."</p>

  <p>"Tell her I am he."</p>

  <p>Joanna fawned and laid her wrinkled forehead in the dust.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" he growled. "Thy service is dishonor and my ears are deaf to it!
  Now, speak! Hast thou a message? Who is it sends a rat to bring me news?"</p>

  <p>"Ali Partab."</p>

  <p>"Soho! And who is Ali Partab? He needs to learn manners. He has come to a
  stern school for them!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;great one&mdash;Prince of swordsmen!&mdash;Ali Partab is
  Mohammed Gunga-sahib's man. He bid me say that he is held a prisoner in a
  bear-cage in Jaimihr's palace and needs aid."</p>

  <p>Alwa's black beard dropped onto his chest as he frowned in thought. He had
  nine men with him. Jaimihr had by this time, perhaps, as many as nine
  thousand, for no one knew but Jaimihr and the priests how many in the
  district waited to espouse his cause. The odds seemed about as stupendous as
  any that a man of his word had ever been called upon to take.</p>

  <p>A moment more, and without consulting any one, he bade one of his men
  dismount.</p>

  <p>"Put that hag on thy horse!" he commanded. "Mount thou behind
  another!"</p>

  <p>The order was obeyed. Another Rangar took the led horse, and Joanna found
  herself, perched like a monkey on a horse that objected to the change of
  riders, between two troopers whose iron-thewed legs squeezed hers into the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>"To Howrah City!" ordered Alwa, starting off at an easy, desert-eating
  amble; and without a word of comment, but with downward glances at their
  swords and a little back-stiffening which was all of excitement that they
  deigned to show, his men wheeled three and three behind him.</p>

  <p>It was no affair of Alwa's that a full moon shone that night&mdash;none of
  his arranging that on that one night of the month Jaimihr and his most
  trusted body-guard should go with the priests and the Maharajah to inspect
  the treasure. Alwa was a soldier, born to take instant advantage of chance
  &mdash;sent opportunity; Jaimihr was a schemer, born to indecision and the
  cunning that seeks underhanded means but overlooks the obvious. Because the
  streets were full of men whose allegiance was doubtful yet, because he
  himself would be too occupied to sit like a spider in a web and watch the
  intentions of the crowd unfold, Jaimihr had turned out every retainer to his
  name, and had scattered them about the city, with orders, if they were
  needed, to rally on a certain point.</p>

  <p>He did think that at any minute a disturbance might break out which would
  lead to civil war, and he saw the necessity for watchfulness at every point;
  but he did not see the rather obvious necessity for leaving more than twenty
  men on guard inside his palace. Not even the thoughtfulness of Siva's priests
  could have anticipated that ten horse-men would be riding out of nowhere,
  with the spirit in them that ignores side issues and leads them only straight
  to their objective.</p>

  <p>Alwa, as a soldier, knew exactly where fresh horses could be borrowed
  while his tired ones rested. A little way beyond the outskirts of the city
  lived a man who was neither Mohammedan nor Hindu&mdash;a fearful man, who
  took no sides, but paid his taxes, carried on his business, and behaved
  &mdash;a Jew, who dealt in horses and in any other animal or thing that could
  be bought to show a profit.</p>

  <p>Alwa had an utterly complete contempt for Jews, as was right and proper in
  a Rangar of the blood. He had not met many of them, and those he had had
  borne away the memory of most outrageous insult gratuitously offered and
  rubbed home. But this particular Jew was a money-lender on occasion, and his
  rates had proved as reasonable as his acceptance of Alwa's unwritten promise
  had been prompt. A man who holds his given word as sacred as did Alwa
  respects, in the teeth of custom or religion, the man who accepts that word;
  so, when the chance had offered, Alwa had done the Jew occasional favors and
  had won his gratitude. He now counted on the Jew for fresh horses.</p>

  <p>To reach him, he had to wade the Howrah River, less than a mile from where
  the burning ghats glowed dull crimson against the sky; the crowd around the
  ghats was the first intimation he received that the streets might prove less
  densely thronged than usual. It was the Jew, beard-scrabbling and fidgeting
  among his horses, who reminded him that when the full moon shone most of the
  populace, and most of Jaimihr's and Howrah's guards, would be occupied near
  Siva's temple and the palace.</p>

  <p>He left his own horses, groomed again, and gorging their fill of good,
  clean grain in the Jew's ramshackle stable place. Joanna he turned loose, to
  sneak into any rat-hole that she chose. Then, with their swords drawn&mdash;
  for if trouble came it would be certain to come suddenly&mdash;he and his
  nine made a wide-ringed circuit of the city, to a point where the main street
  passing Jaimihr's palace ended in a dune of wind-piled desert sand. From the
  moment when they reached that point they did not waste a second; action trod
  on the heel of thought and thought flashed fast as summer lightning.</p>

  <p>They lit through the deserted street, troubling for speed, not silence;
  the few whom they passed had no time to determine who they were, and no one
  followed them. A few frightened night-wanderers ran at sight of them, hiding
  down side streets, but when they brought up at last outside Jaimihr's palace-
  gate they had so far escaped recognition. And that meant that no one would
  carry word to Jaimihr or his men.</p>

  <p>It was death-dark outside the bronze-hinged double gate; only a dim lamp
  hung above from chains, to show how dark it was, and the moon&mdash;cut off
  by trees and houses on a bluff of rising ground&mdash;lent nothing to the
  gloom.</p>

  <p>"Open! The Jaimihr-sahib comes!" shouted Alwa and one of his horsemen
  legged up close beside the gate.</p>

  <p>Some one moved inside, for his footsteps could be heard; whoever he was
  appeared to listen cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Open for the Jaimihr-sahib!" repeated Alwa.</p>

  <p>Evidently that was not the usual command, or otherwise the gates would
  have swung open on the instant. Instead, one gate moved inward by a fraction
  of a foot, and a puggreed head peered cautiously between the gap. That,
  though, was sufficient. With a laugh, the man up closest drove his sword-hilt
  straight between the Hindu's eyes, driving his horse's shoulder up against
  the gate; three others spurred and shoved beside him. Not thirty seconds
  later Alwa and his nine were striking hoof sparks on the stone of Jaimihr's
  courtyard, and the gates&mdash;that could have easily withstood a hundred-man
  assault with battering-rams&mdash;had clanged behind them, bolted tight
  against their owner.</p>

  <p>"Where is the bear cage?" demanded Alwa. "It is a bear I need, not
  blood!"</p>

  <p>The dozen left inside to guard the palace had recovered quickly enough
  from their panic. They were lining up in the middle of the courtyard, ready
  to defend their honor, even if the palace should be lost. It was barely
  probable that Jaimihr's temper would permit them the privilege of dying
  quickly should he come and find his palace looted; a Rangar's sword seemed
  better, and they made ready to die hard.</p>

  <p>"Where's Ali Partab?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. The little crowd drew in, and one by one took up the
  fighting attitude that each man liked the best.</p>

  <p>"I say I did not come for blood! I came for Ali Partab! If I get him,
  unharmed, I ride away again; but otherwise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What otherwise?" asked the captain of the guard.</p>

  <p>"This palace burns!"</p>

  <p>There was a momentary consultation&mdash;no argument, but a quickly
  reached agreement.</p>

  <p>"He is here, unharmed," declared the captain gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Bring him out!"</p>

  <p>"What proof have we that he is all you came for?"</p>

  <p>"My given word."</p>

  <p>"But the Jaimihr-sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You also have my given word that unless I get Ali Partab this palace
  burns, with all that there is in it!"</p>

  <p>Distrustful still, the captain of the guard called out to a sweeper,
  skulking in the shadow by the stables to go and loose Ali Partab.</p>

  <p>"Send no sweepers to him!" ordered Alwa. "He has suffered indignity
  enough. Go thou!"</p>

  <p>The captain of the guard obeyed. Two minutes later Ali Partab stood before
  Alwa and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, my master's thanks!"</p>

  <p>"They are accepted," answered Alwa, with almost regal dignity. "Bring a
  lamp!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>One of the guard brought a hand-lantern, and by its light Alwa examined
  Ali Partab closely. He was filthy, and his clothing reeked of the disgusting
  confinement he had endured.</p>

  <p>"Give this man clothing fit for a man of mine!" commanded Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, there is none; perhaps the Jaimihr-sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have ordered!"</p>

  <p>There was a movement among Alwa's men&mdash;a concerted, horse-length-
  forward movement, made terrifying by the darkness&mdash;each man knew well
  enough that the men they were bullying could fight; success, should they have
  to force it at the sword-point, would depend largely on which side took the
  other by surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is done, sahib," said the leader of the guard, and one man hurried off
  to execute the order. Ten minutes later&mdash;they were ten impatient
  minutes, during which the horses sensed the fever of anxiety and could be
  hardly made to stand&mdash;Ali Partab stood arrayed in clean, new khaki that
  fitted him reasonably well.</p>

  <p>"A sword, now!" demanded Alwa. "Thy sword! This man had a sword when he
  was taken! Give him thine, unless there is a better to be had."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but obedience, for few things were more certain
  than that Alwa was not there to waste time asking for anything he would not
  fight for if refused. The guard held out his long sword, hilt first, and Ali
  Partab strapped it on.</p>

  <p>"I had three horses when they took me," he asserted, "three good ones,
  sound and swift, belonging to my master."</p>

  <p>"Then take three of Jaimihr's!"</p>

  <p>It took ten minutes more for Ali Partab and two of Alwa's men to search
  the stables and bring out the three best chargers of the twenty and more
  reserved for Jaimihr's private use. They were wonders of horses, half-Arab
  and half-native-bred, clean-limbed and firm&mdash;worth more, each one of
  them, than all three of Mohammed Gunga's put together.</p>

  <p>"Are they good enough?" demanded Alwa.</p>

  <p>"My master will be satisfied," grinned Ali Partab.</p>

  <p>"Open the gate, then!" Alwa was peering through the blackness for a sight
  of firearms, but could see none. He guessed&mdash;and he was right&mdash;
  that the guard had taken full advantage of their master's absence, and had
  been gambling in a corner while their rifles rested under cover somewhere
  else. For a second he hesitated, dallying with the notion of disarming the
  guard before he left, then decided that a fight was scarcely worth the
  risking now, and with ten good men behind him he wheeled and scooted through
  the wide-flung gates into outer gloom.</p>

  <p>He galloped none too fast, for his party was barely out of range before a
  ragged volley ripped from the palace-wall; one of his men, hampered and
  delayed by a led horse that was trying to break away from him, was actually
  hit, and begged Alwa to ride back and burn the palace after all. He was
  grumbling still about the Color of a Rangar, when Alwa called a halt in the
  shelter of a deserted side street in order to question Ali Partab
  further.</p>

  <p>Ali Partab protested that he did not know what to say or think about the
  missionaries. He explained his orders and vowed that his Color held him there
  in Howrah until Miss McClean should consent to come away. He did not mention
  the father; he was a mere side issue&mdash;it was Alwa who asked after
  him.</p>

  <p>"A tick on the belly of an ox rides with the ox," said Ali Partab.</p>

  <p>"Lead on, then, to the mission house," commanded Alwa, and the ten-man
  troop proceeded to obey. They had reached the main street again, and were
  wheeling into it, when Joanna sprang from gutter darkness and intercepted
  them. She was all but ridden down before Ali Partab recognized her.</p>

  <p>"The mohurs, sahib!" she demanded. "Three golden mohurs!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, three!" said Ali Partab, giving her a hand and yanking her off the
  ground. She sprang across his horse's rump behind him, and he seemed to have
  less compunction about personal defilement than the others had.</p>

  <p>"Is she thy wife or thy mother-in-law?" laughed Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib, but my creditor! The mother of confusion tells me that the
  Miss-sahib and her father are in Howrah's palace!"</p>

  <p>They halted, all together in a cluster in the middle of the street&mdash;
  shut in by darkness&mdash;watched for all they knew, by a hundred
  enemies.</p>

  <p>"Of their own will or as prisoners?"</p>

  <p>"As prisoners, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Back to the side street! Quickly! Jaimihr' rat's nest is one affair," he
  muttered; "Howrah's beehive is another!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER 19</a></h2>

  <p>Now, secrets and things of the Councils of Kings<br>
  Are deuced expensive to buy,<br>
  For it wouldn't look nice if a Councillor's price<br>
  Were anything other than high.<br>
  Be advised, though, and note that the price they will quote<br>
  Is less at each grade you go deeper,<br>
  And&mdash;(Up on its toes it's the Underworld knows!)&mdash;<br>
  The cheapest of all is the Sweeper.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JOANNA&mdash;when Alwa forgot about her and loosed her to
  run just where she chose&mdash;had sneaked, down alleys and over roof-tops,
  straight for the mission house. She found there nothing but a desultory guard
  and an impression, rather than the traces, of an empty cage. About two
  minutes of cautious questioning of neighbors satisfied her where the
  missionaries were; nothing short of death seemed able to deprive her of
  ability to flit like a black bat through the shadows, and the distance to
  Howrah's palace was accomplished, by her usual bat's entry route, in less
  time than a pony would have taken by the devious street. Before Alwa had
  thundered on Jaimihr's gate Joanna had mingled in the crowd outside the
  palace and was shrewdly questioning again.</p>

  <p>She arrived too late to see McClean and his daughter seized; what she did
  hear was that they were prisoners, and that the Maharajah, Jaimihr, and the
  priests were all of them engaged in the secret ceremony whose beginning was a
  monthly spectacle but whose subsequent developments&mdash;supposed to be
  somewhere in the bowels of the earth&mdash;were known only to the men who
  held the key.</p>

  <p>Like a rat running in the wainscot holes, she tried to follow the
  procession; like everybody else, she knew the way it took from the palace
  gate, and&mdash;as few others were&mdash;she was aware of a scaling-place on
  the outer wall where a huge baobab drooped century-scarred branches nearly to
  the ground on either side. The sacred monkeys used that route and where they
  went Joanna could contrive to follow.</p>

  <p>It was another member of the sweeper caste, lurking in the darkness of an
  inner courtyard, who pointed out the bronze-barred door to her through which
  the treasure guardians had chanted on their way; it was he, too, who told her
  that Rosemary McClean and her father had been rushed into the palace through
  the main entrance. Also, he informed her that there was no way&mdash;
  positively no way practicable even for a monkey or a bird&mdash;of following
  further. He was a sweeper-intimate acquaintance of creeper ladders,
  trap-doors, gutters, drains, and byways; she realized at once that there
  would be no wisdom in attempting to find within an hour what he had not
  discovered in a lifetime.</p>

  <p>So Joanna, her beady eyes glittering between the wrinkled folds of skin,
  slunk deeper in a shadow and began to think. She, the looker-on, had seen the
  whole play from its first beginning and could judge at least that part of it
  which had its bearing on her missionary masters. First, she knew what
  Jaimihr's ambition was&mdash;every man in Howrah knew how he planned to seize
  Miss McClean when the moment should be propitious&mdash;and her Eastern
  wisdom warned her that Jaimihr, foiled, would stop at nothing to contrive
  vengeance. If he could not seize Miss McClean, he would be likely to use
  every means within his power to bring about her death and prevent another
  from making off with his prize. Jaimihr, then, was the most pressing
  danger.</p>

  <p>Second, as a Hindu, she knew well how fiendishly the priests loathed the
  Christian missionaries; and it was common knowledge that the Maharajah was
  cross-hobbled by the priests. The Maharajah was a fearful man, and, unless
  the priests and Jaimihr threatened him with a show of combination, there was
  a slight chance that he might dread British vengeance too much to dare permit
  violence to the McCleans. Possibly he might hold out against the priests
  alone; but before an open alliance between Jaimihr and the priests he would
  surrender for his own throne's sake.</p>

  <p>So far Joanna could reason readily enough, for there was a vast fund of
  wisdom stored beneath her wrinkled ugliness. But her Eastern limitation
  stopped her there. She could not hold loyalty to more than one cause, or to
  more than one offshoot of that cause, in the same shrewd head at once. She
  decided that at all costs Jaimihr must be out of the way so that the
  Maharajah might be left to argue with the priests alone. For the moment no
  other thought occurred to her.</p>

  <p>The means seemed ready to her hand. A peculiarity of the East, which is
  democratic in most ways under the veneer of swaggering autocracy, that
  servants of the very lowest caste may speak, and argue on occasion, with men
  who would shudder at the prospect of defilement from their touch. There was
  nothing in the least outrageous in the proposition that the sweeper, waiting
  in a corner for the procession to emerge again so that he might curl on his
  mat and sleep undisturbed when it had gone, should dare to approach Jaimihr
  and address him. He would run no small risk of being beaten by the guards;
  but, on the other hand, should he catch Jaimihr's ear and interest him, he
  would be safe.</p>

  <p>"Wouldst thou win Jaimihr's Color?" asked Joanna, creeping up beside him,
  and whispering with all the suggestiveness she could assume.</p>

  <p>"Who would not? Who knows that within week he will not be ruler?"</p>

  <p>"True. I have a message for him. I must hurry back. Deliver it for
  me."</p>

  <p>"What would be the nature of the message?"</p>

  <p>"This. His prisoner is gone. A raid has taken place. In his absence, while
  his men patrolled the city, certain Rangars broke into his palace&mdash;
  looted&mdash;and prepared to burn. Bid him hurry back with all the men he can
  collect."</p>

  <p>"From whom is this message?"</p>

  <p>"From the captain of the guard."</p>

  <p>"And I am to deliver it? Thou dodderest! Mother of a murrain, have I not
  trouble sufficient for one man? Who bears bad news to a prince, or to any but
  his enemy? I&mdash;with these two eyes&mdash;I saw what happened to the men
  who bore bad news to Howrah once. I&mdash;with this broom of mine &mdash;I
  helped clean up the mess. Deliver thine own message!"</p>

  <p>"Nay. Afterwards I will say this&mdash;to the Jaimihr-sahib in person.
  There is one, I will tell him, a sweeper in the palace, who refused to bear
  tidings when the need was great."</p>

  <p>"If his palace is burned and his wealth all ashes, who cares what Jaimihr
  hears?"</p>

  <p>"There is no glow yet in the sky," said Joanna looking up. "The palace is
  not yet in flames; they loot still."</p>

  <p>"What if it be not true?"</p>

  <p>"Will Jaimihr not be glad?"</p>

  <p>"Glad to see me, the bearer of false news, impaled&mdash;or crushed
  beneath an elephant&mdash;ay&mdash;glad, indeed."</p>

  <p>"The reward, were the Jaimihr-sahib warned in time, would be a great
  one."</p>

  <p>"Then, why waitest thou not to have word with him. Art thou above
  rewards?"</p>

  <p>"Have no fear! He will know in good time who it was brought thee the
  news."</p>

  <p>They argued for ten minutes, Joanna threatening and coaxing and promising
  rewards, until at last the man consented. It was the thought, thoroughly
  encouraged by Joanna, that the penalty for not speaking would be greater than
  the beating he might get for bearing evil news that at last convinced him;
  and it was not until she had won him over and assured herself that he would
  not fail that it dawned on Joanna just what an edged tool she was playing
  with. While getting rid of Jaimihr, she was endangering the liberty and life
  of Alwa&mdash;the one man able to do anything for the McCleans!</p>

  <p>That thought sent her scooting over housetops, diving down dark alleyways,
  racing, dodging, hiding, dashing on again, and brought her in the nick of
  time to a ditch, from whose shelter she sprang and seized the hand of Ali
  Partab. That incident, and her intimation that the missionaries were in
  Howrah's palace, took Alwa back up the black, blind side street; and before
  he emerged from it he saw Jaimihr and his ten go thundering past, their eyes
  on the sky-line for a hint of conflagration, and their horses&mdash;
  belly-to-the-earth&mdash;racing as only fear, or enthusiasm, or grim
  desperation in their riders' minds can make them race.</p>

  <p>A little later, in groups and scattered fours, and one by one, his heavy-
  breathing troopers followed, cursing the order that had sent them abroad
  without their horses, damning&mdash;as none but a dismounted cavalryman can
  damn&mdash;the earth's unevenness, their swords, their luck, their priests,
  the night, their boots, and Jaimihr. Forewarned, Alwa held on down the pitch-
  dark side street, into whose steep-sided chasm the moon's rays would not
  reach for an hour or two to come, and once again he led his party in a
  sweeping, wide-swung circle, loose-reined and swifter than the silent night
  wind&mdash;this time for Howrah's palace. There was his given word, plighted
  to Mohammed Gunga, to redeem.</p>

  performed, the thirty wound their way, chanting, in single file back again.
  The bronze-enforced door, that was only first of half a hundred barriers
  between approach and the semi-sacred hoard, at last clanged shut and was
  locked with three locks, each of whose individual keys was in the keeping of
  a separate member of the three&mdash;Maharajah, Prince, and priest. The same
  keys fitted every door of the maze&mdash;made passages, but no one door would
  open without all three.</p>

  <p>Speaking like an omen from the deepest shadow, the sweeper called to
  Jaimihr.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, thy palace burns! Sahib, thy prisoner runs! Haste, sahib! Call thy
  men and hasten back! Thy palace is in flames&mdash;the Rangars come to
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>As a raven, disturbed into night omen-croaking, he sent forth his news
  from utter blackness into nerve-strung tension. No one member of the thirty
  but was on the alert for friction or sudden treachery; the were all eyes for
  each other, and the croaking fell on ears strained to the aching point. He
  had time to repeat his warning before one of Jaimihr's men stepped into the
  darkness where he hid and dragged him out.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, a woman came but now and brought the news. It was from the captain
  of the guard. The Rangars came to take their man away. They broke in. They
  burn. They loot. They&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Jaimihr did not wait another instant to hear the rest. To him this
  seemed like the scheming of his brother. Now he imagined he could read
  between the lines! That letter sent to Alwa had been misreported to him, and
  had been really a call to come and free the prisoner and wreak Rangar
  vengeance! He understood! But first he must save his palace, if it could be
  saved. The priests must have deceived him, so he wasted no time in arguing
  with them; he ran, with his guards behind him, to the outer wall of Siva's
  temple where the horses waited, each with a sais squatting at his head. The
  saises were sent scattering among the crowd to give the alarm and send the
  rest of his contingent hurrying back; Jaimihr and his ten drove home their
  spurs, and streaked, as the frightened jackal runs when a tiger interrupts
  them at their worry, hell-bent-for-leather up the unlit street.</p>

  <p>Then Maharajah Howrah's custom-accorded dignity stood him in good stead.
  It flashed across his worried brain that space had been given him by the gods
  in which to think. Jaimihr&mdash;one facet of the problem and perhaps the
  sharpest&mdash;would have his hands full for a while, and the priests
  &mdash;wish how they would&mdash;would never dare omit the after-ritual in
  Siva's temple. He&mdash;untrammelled for an hour to come&mdash;might study
  out a course to take and hold with those embarrassing prisoners of his.</p>

  <p>He turned&mdash;updrawn in regal stateliness&mdash;and intimated to the
  high priest that the ceremony might proceed without him. When the priests
  demurred and murmured, he informed them that he would be pleased to give them
  audience when the ritual was over, and without deigning another argument he
  turned through a side door into the palace.</p>

  <p>Within ten minutes he was seated in his throne-room. One minute later his
  prisoners stood in front of him, still holding each other's hands, and the
  guard withdrew. The great doors opening on the marble outer hall clanged
  tight, and in this room there were no carved screens through which a hidden,
  rustling world might listen. There was gold-encrusted splendor&mdash;there
  were glittering, hanging ornaments that far outdid the peacocks' feathers of
  the canopy above the throne; but the walls were solid, and the marble floor
  rang hard and true.</p>

  <p>There was no nook or corner anywhere that could conceal a man. For a
  minute, still bejeweled in his robes of state and glittering as the diamonds
  in his head-dress caught the light from half a dozen hanging lamps, the
  Maharajah sat and gazed at them, his chin resting on one hand and his
  silk-clad elbow laid on the carved gold arm of his throne.</p>

  <p>"Why am I troubled?" he demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You know!" said the missionary. His daughter clutched his hand tightly,
  partly to reassure him, partly because she knew that a despot would be
  bearded now in his gold-bespattered den, and fear gripped her.</p>

  <p>"Maharajah-sahib, when I came here with letters from the government of
  India and asked you for a mission house in which to live and work, I told you
  that I came as a friend&mdash;as a respectful sympathizer. I told you I would
  not incite rebellion against you, and that I would not interfere with native
  custom or your authority so long as acquiescence and obedience by me did not
  run counter to the overriding law of the British Government."</p>

  <p>Howrah did not even move his head in token that he listened, but his tired
  eyes answered.</p>

  <p>"To that extent I promised not to interfere with your religion."</p>

  <p>Howrah nodded.</p>

  <p>"Once&mdash;twice&mdash;in all nine times&mdash;I came and warned you that
  the practice of suttee was and is illegal. My knowledge of Sanskrit is only
  slight, but there are others of my race who have had opportunity to translate
  the Sanskrit Vedas,* and I have in writing what they found in them. I warned
  you, when that information reached me, that your priests have been
  deliberately lying to you&mdash;that the Vedas say: 'Thrice-blessed is she
  who dies of a broken heart because her lord and master leaves her.' They say
  nothing, absolutely nothing, about suttee or its practice, which from the
  beginning has been a damnable invention of the priests. But the practice of
  suttee has continued. I have warned the government frequently, in writing,
  but for reasons which I do not profess to understand they have made no move
  as yet. For that reason, and for no other, I have tried to be a thorn in your
  side, and will continue to try to be until this suttee ceases!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Vedas</i>&mdash;a corpus of ancient Indo-Aryan
  religious literature that is considered by adherents of Hinduism to be
  revealed knowledge. The word Veda means Knowledge and is cognate with the
  word "wit" in English (as well as "vision" through Latin). Many Hindus
  believe the Vedas existed since the beginning of creation ... The newest
  parts of the Vedas are estimated to date back to around 500 BCE. The oldest
  text (RigVeda) found is now dated to around 1,500 BCE, but most Indologists
  agree that a long oral tradition possibly existed before it was written down.

  <p>"Why," demanded Howrah, "since you are a foreigner with neither influence
  nor right, do you stay here and behold what you cannot change? Does a snake
  lie sleeping on an ant-hill? Does a woman watch the butchering of lambs? Yet,
  do ant-hills cease to be, and are lambs not butchered? Look the other way!
  Sleep softer in another place!"</p>

  <p>"I am a prisoner. For months past my daughter and I have been prisoners to
  all intents and purposes, and you, Maharajah-sahib, have known it well. Now,
  the one man who was left to be our escort to another place is a prisoner,
  too. You know that, too. And you ask me why I stay! Suppose you answer?"</p>

  <p>Rosemary squeezed his hand again, this time less to restrain him than
  herself. She was torn between an inclination to laugh at the daring or shiver
  at the indiscretion of taking to task a man whose one word could place them
  at the mercy of the priests of Siva, or the mob. But Duncan McClean, a little
  bowed about the shoulders, peered through his spectacles and waited&mdash;
  quite unawed by all the splendor&mdash;for the Maharajah's answer.</p>

  <p>"Of what man do you speak?" asked Howrah, still undecided what to do with
  them, and anxious above all things to disguise his thoughts. "What man is a
  prisoner, and how do you know it?"</p>

  <p>Before McClean had time to answer him, a spear haft rang on the great teak
  double door. There was a pause, and the clang repeated&mdash;another pause
  &mdash;a third reverberating, humming metal notice of an interruption, and
  the doors swung wide. A Hindu, salaaming low so that the expression of his
  face could not be seen, called out down the long length of the hall.</p>

  <p>"The Alwa-sahib waits, demanding audience!" There was no change apparent
  on Howrah's face. His fingers tightened on the jeweled scimitar that
  protruded, silk-sashed, from his middle, but neither voice nor eyes nor lips
  betrayed the least emotion. It was the McCleans whose eyes blazed with a
  new-born hope, that was destined to be dashed a second later.</p>

  <p>"Has he guards with him?"</p>

  <p>"But ten, Maharajah-sahib."</p>

  <p>"Then remove these people to the place where they were, and afterwards
  admit him&mdash;without his guards!"</p>

  <p>"I demand permission to speak with this Alwa-sahib!" said McClean.</p>

  <p>"Remove them!"</p>

  <p>Two spear-armed custodians of the door advanced. Resistance was obviously
  futile. Still holding his daughter's hand, the missionary let himself be led
  to the outer hall and down a corridor, where, presently, a six-inch door shut
  prisoners and guards even from sound of what transpired beyond.</p>

  <p>Alwa, swaggering until his long spurs jingled like a bunch of keys each
  time his boot-heels struck the marble floor, strode straight as a soldier up
  to the raised throne dais&mdash;took no notice whatever of the sudden
  slamming of the door behind him&mdash;looked knife-keenly into Howrah's
  eyes&mdash;and saluted with a flourish.</p>

  <p>"I come from bursting open Jaimihr's buzzard roost!" he intimated mildly.
  "He held a man of mine. I have the man."</p>

  <p>Merely to speak first was insolence; but that breach of etiquette was
  nothing to his manner and his voice. It appeared that he was so utterly
  confident of his own prowess that he could afford to speak casually; he did
  not raise his voice or emphasize a word. He was a man of his word, relating
  facts, and every line of his steel-thewed anatomy showed it.</p>

  <p>"I sent a letter to you, by horseman, with a present," said Howrah. "I
  await the answer."</p>

  <p>Alwa's eyes changed, and his attention stiffened. Not having been at home,
  he knew nothing of the letter, but he did not choose to acknowledge the fact.
  The principle that one only shares the truth with friends is good, when taken
  by surprise.</p>

  <p>"I preferred to have confirmation of the matter from the Maharajah's lips
  in person, so&mdash;since I had this other matter to attend to&mdash;I
  combined two visits in one trip."</p>

  <p>He lied, as he walked and fought, like a soldier, and the weary man who
  watched him from the throne detected no false ring.</p>

  <p>"I informed you that I had extended my protection to the two missionaries,
  man and daughter."</p>

  <p>"You did. Also, you did well." He tossed that piece of comfort to the
  despot as a man might throw table scraps to a starveling dog! "I have come to
  take away the missionaries."</p>

  <p>"With a guard of ten!"</p>

  <p>It was the first admission of astonishment that either man had made.</p>

  <p>"Are you not aware that Jaimihr, too, has eyes on the woman?"</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it. I have shown Jaimihr how deep my fear of him lies! I
  know, too, how deep the love lies between thee and thy brother, king of
  Howrah! I am here to remind you that many more than ten men would race their
  horses to a stand-still to answer my summons&mdash;brave men,
  Maharajah-sahib&mdash;men whose blades are keen, and straightly held, and
  true. They who would rally round me against Jaimihr would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would fight for me?"</p>

  <p>"I have not yet said so." There was a little, barely accentuated emphasis
  on the one word "yet." The Maharajah thought a minute before he answered.</p>

  <p>"How many mounted troopers could you raise?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? A thousand&mdash;three thousand&mdash;according to the
  soreness of the need."</p>

  <p>"You have heard&mdash;I know that you have heard&mdash;what, even at this
  minute, awaits the British? I know, for I have taken care to know, that a
  cousin of yours&mdash;Mohammed Gunga&mdash;is interested for the British.
  So&mdash;so I am interested to have word with you."</p>

  <p>Alwa laughed ironically.</p>

  <p>"And the tiger asked the wolf pack where good hunting was!" he mocked. "I
  and my men strike which way suits us when the hour comes."</p>

  <p>"My palace has many chambers in it!" hinted Howrah. "There have been men
  who wondered what the light of day was like, having long ago forgotten!"</p>

  <p>"Make me prisoner!" laughed Alwa. "Count then the hours until three
  thousand blades join Jaimihr and help him grease the dungeon hinges with thy
  fat!"</p>

  <p>"Having looted Jaimihr's palace, you speak thus?"</p>

  <p>"Having whipped a dog, I wait for the dog to lick my hand."</p>

  <p>"What is your purpose with these missionaries?"</p>

  <p>"To redeem my given word."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"I would be free to pledge it again."</p>

  <p>"To me?"</p>

  <p>"To whom I choose."</p>

  <p>"I will give thee the missionaries, against thy word to fight on my side
  when the hour comes."</p>

  <p>"Against whom?"</p>

  <p>"The British."</p>

  <p>"I have no quarrel with the British, yet."</p>

  <p>"I will give thee the missionaries, against thy word to support me on this
  throne."</p>

  <p>"Against whom?"</p>

  <p>"Against all comers."</p>

  <p>"If I refuse, what then?"</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr&mdash;who by this time must surely be thy very warmest friend!
  &mdash;shall attack thee unmolested. Pledge thy word&mdash;take thy
  missionary people&mdash;and Jaimihr must oppose thee and me combined."</p>

  <p>"Should Jaimihr ride after me, what then?"</p>

  <p>"If he takes many with him, he must leave his camp unguarded, or only
  weakly guarded. Then I would act. If he goes with few, how can he take thy
  castle?"</p>

  <p>"Then I have your protection against Jaimihr, and the missionaries,
  against my promise to support you on the throne?"</p>

  <p>"My word on it."</p>

  <p>"And mine."</p>

  <p>Howrah rose, stepped forward to the dais edge, and held his hand out.</p>

  <p>"Nay!" swore Alwa, recoiling. "My word is given. I take no Hindu's
  hand!"</p>

  <p>Howrah glared for a moment, but thought better of the hot retort that rose
  to his lips. Instead he struck a silver gong, and when the doors swung open
  ordered the prisoners to be produced.</p>

  <p>"Escape through the palace-grounds," he advised Alwa. "A man of mine will
  show the way."</p>

  <p>"Remember!" said Alwa across his shoulder with more than royal insolence,
  "I swore to help thee against Jaimihr and to support thee on thy throne
  &mdash;but in nothing did I swear to be thy tool&mdash;remember!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER 21</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Howrah City bows the knee<br>
  (More or less) to masters three,<br>
  King, and Prince, and Siva.<br>
  Howrah City comes and goes&mdash;<br>
  Buys and sells&mdash;and never knows<br>
  Which is friend, and which are foes&mdash;<br>
  King, or Prince, or Siva.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THAT which followed Alwa's breakaway was all but the tensest
  hour in Howrah City's history. The inevitable&mdash;the foiled rage of the
  priests and Jaimihr's impudent insistence that the missionaries should be
  handed over to him&mdash;the Maharajah's answer&mdash;all combined to set the
  murmurings afoot. Men said that the threatened rebellion against the rule of
  Britain had broken loose at last, and a dozen other quite as false and
  equally probable things.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr, finding that his palace was intact, and that only the prisoner
  and three horses from his stable were missing, placed the whole guard under
  arrest&mdash;stormed futilely, while his hurrying swarm flocked to him
  through the dinning streets&mdash;and then, mad-angry and made reckless by
  his rage, rode with a hundred at his back to Howrah's palace, scattering the
  bee-swarm of inquisitive but so far peaceful citizens right and left.</p>

  <p>With little ceremony, he sent in word to Howrah that he wanted Alwa and
  the missionaries; he stated that his private Color was at stake, and that he
  would stop at nothing to wreak vengeance. He wanted the man who had dared
  invade his palace&mdash;the man whom he had released&mdash;and the two who
  were the prime cause of the outrage. And with just as little ceremony word
  came out that the Maharajah would please himself as to what he did with
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>That message was followed almost instantly by the high priest of Siva in
  person, angry as a turkey-gobbler and blasphemously vindictive. He it was who
  told Jaimihr of the unexpected departure through the palace-grounds.</p>

  <p>"Ride, Jaimihr-sahib! Ride!" he advised him.</p>

  <p>"How many have you? A hundred? Plenty! Ride and cut him off! There is but
  one road to Alwa's place; he must pass by the northern ford through Howrah
  River. Ride and cut him off!"</p>

  <p>So, loose-reined, foam-flecked, breathing vengeance, Jaimihr and his
  hundred thundered through the dark hot night, making a bee-line for the point
  where Alwa's band must pass in order to take the shortest route to
  safety.</p>

  <p>It was his word to the Jew that saved Alwa's neck. He and his men were
  riding borrowed horses, and he had promised to return them and reclaim his
  own. They had moved at a walk through winding, dark palace-alleys, led by a
  palace attendant, and debouched through a narrow door that gave barely
  horse-room into the road where Jaimihr had once killed a Maharati trader who
  molested Rosemary McClean. The missionary and his daughter were mounted on
  the horses seized in Jaimihr's stable; Joanna, moaning about "three gold
  mohurs, sahib&mdash;three, where are they?" was up behind Ali Partab, tossed
  like a pea on a drum-skin by the lunging movements of the wonder of a
  horse.</p>

  <p>Instead of heading straight for home, in which case&mdash;although he did
  not know it&mdash;he would have been surely overhauled and brought to bay, he
  led at a stiff hand gallop to the Jew's, changed horses, crossed the ford by
  the burning ghats, and swooped in a wide half-circle for the sandy trail that
  would take him homeward. He made the home road miles beyond the point where
  Jaimihr waited for him&mdash;drew rein into the long-striding amble that
  desert-taught horses love&mdash;and led on, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Ho!" He laughed. "Ho-ho! Here, then, is the end of Mohammed Gunga's
  scheming! Now, when he comes with arguments to make me fight on the British
  side, what a tale I have for him! Ho! What a swearing there will be! I will
  give him his missionary people, and say, 'There, Mohammed Gunga, cousin mine,
  there is my word redeemed&mdash;there is thy man into the bargain&mdash;
  there are three horses for thee&mdash;and I&mdash;I am at Howrah's beck and
  call!' Allah! What a swearing there will be!"</p>

  <p>There was swearing, viler and more blasphemous than any of which Mohammed
  Gunga might be capable, where Jaimihr waited in the dark. He waited until the
  yellow dawn broke up the first dim streaks of violet before he realized that
  Alwa had given him the slip; and he cursed even the high priest of Siva when
  that worthy accosted him and asked what tidings.</p>

  <p>"Another trick!" swore Jaimihr. "So, thou and thy temple rats saw fit to
  send me packing for the night! What devils' tricks have been hatched out in
  my absence?"</p>

  <p>The high priest started to protest, but Jaimihr silenced him with coarse-
  mouthed threats.</p>

  <p>"I, too, can play double when occasion calls for it!" he swore. And with
  that hint at coming trouble he clattered on home to his palace.</p>

  <p>To begin with, when he reached home, he had the guard beaten all but
  unconscious for having dared let raiders in during the night before; then he
  sent them, waterless and thirsty, back to the dungeon. He felt better then,
  and called for ink and paper.</p>

  <p>For hours he thought and wrote alternately, tearing up letter after
  letter. Then, at last, he read over a composition that satisfied him and set
  his seal at the foot. He placed the whole in a silver tube, poured wax into
  the joint, and called for the fat man who had been responsible for Ali
  Partab's capture.</p>

  <p>"Dog!" he snarled. "Interfering fool! All this was thy doing! Didst thou
  see the guard beaten awhile ago?"</p>

  <p>"I did. It was a lordly beating. The men are all but dead but will live
  for such another one."</p>

  <p>"Wouldst thou be so beaten?"</p>

  <p>"How can I prevent, if your highness wishes?"</p>

  <p>"Take this. It is intended for Peshawar but may be given to any British
  officer above the rank of major. It calls for a receipt. Do not dare come
  back, or be caught in Howrah City, without a receipt for that tube and its
  contents intact!"</p>

  <p>"If Alwa and Mohammed Gunga are in league with my brother," muttered
  Jaimihr to himself when the fat Hindu had gone, "then the sooner the British
  quarrel with both of them the better. Howrah alone I can dispose of easily
  enough, and there is yet time before rebellion starts for the British to
  spike the guns of the other two. By the time that is done, I will be
  Maharajah!"</p>

  <p>It was less than three days later when the word came mysteriously through
  the undiscoverable "underground" route of India for all men to be ready.</p>

  <p>"By the next full moon," went the message, from the priests alone knew
  where, "all India will be waiting. When the full moon rises then the hour is
  come!"</p>

  <p>"And when that full moon rises," thought Jaimihr to himself, "my brother's
  funeral rites will be past history!"</p>

  <p>For the present, though, he made believe to regret his recent rage, and
  was courteous to priest and Maharajah alike&mdash;even sending to his brother
  to apologize.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER 22</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">They've called thee by an evil word,<br>
  They've named thee traitor, friend o' mine.<br>
  Thou askest faith? I send my sword.<br>
  There is no greater, friend o' mine.</p><br>

  <p class="first">RALPH CUNNINGHAM said good-by to Brigadier-General Byng
  (Byng the Brigadier) with more feeling of regret and disappointment than he
  cared to show. A born soldier, he did his hard-mouthed utmost to refrain from
  whining; he even pretended that a political appointment was a recognizable
  advance along the road to sure success&mdash;or, rather, pretended that he
  thought it was; and the Brigadier, who knew men, and particularly young men,
  detected instantly the tell-tale expression of the honest grey
  eyes&mdash;analyzed it&mdash;and, to Cunningham's amazement, approved the
  unwilling make-believe.</p>

  <p>"Now, buck up, Cunningham!" he said, slapping him familiarly on the
  shoulder. "You're making a good, game effort to hide chagrin, and you're a
  good, game ass for your pains. There isn't one man in all India who has half
  your luck at this minute, if you only knew it; but go ahead and find out for
  yourself! Go to Abu and report, but waste no more time there than you can
  help. Hurry on to Howrah, and once you're there, if Mohammed Gunga tells you
  what looks like a lie, trust him to the hilt!"</p>

  <p>"Is he coming with me, then?" asked Cunningham in some amazement.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;unofficially. He has relations in that neighborhood and wants
  to visit them; he is going to take advantage of your pack-train and escort.
  You'll have a small escort as far as Abu; after that you'll be expected to
  look out for yourself. The escort is made up of details traveling down-
  country; they'll leave you at Abu Road."</p>

  <p>So, still unbelieving&mdash;still wondering why the Brigadier should go to
  all that trouble to convince him that politics in a half-forgotten native
  state were fair meat for a soldier&mdash;Cunningham rode off at the head of a
  variously made-up traveling party, grudging every step of that wonderful mare
  Mohammed Gunga had given him, that bore him away from the breeze-swept
  north&mdash;away from the mist-draped hills he had already learned to love
  &mdash;ever down, down, down into the hell-baked plains.</p>

  <p>Each rest-house where he spent a night was but another brooding-place of
  discontent and regret, each little petty detail connected with the command of
  the motley party (mainly time-expired men, homeward bound), was drudgery;
  each Hindu puggree that he met was but a beastly contrast, or so it seemed to
  him, to the turbans of the troop that but a week ago had thundered at his
  back.</p>

  <p>More than any other thing, Mohammed Gunga's cheerfulness amazed him. He
  resented it. He did not see why the man who had expressed such interest in
  the good fortune of his father's son should not be sympathetic now that his
  soldier career had been nipped so early in the bud. He began to lose faith in
  Mohammed Gunga's wisdom, and was glad when the ex-Risaldar chose to bring up
  the rear of the procession instead of riding by his side.</p>

  <p>But behind, in Peshawar, there was one man at least who knew Mohammed
  Gunga and his worth, and who refused to let himself be blinded by any sort of
  circumstantial evidence. The evidence was black&mdash;in black on white
  &mdash;written by a black-hearted schemer, and delivered by a big, fat black
  man, who was utterly road-weary, to the commissioner in person.</p>

  <p>The sepoy mutiny that had been planned so carefully had started to take
  charge too soon. News had arrived of native regiments whose officers had been
  obliged against their will to disarm and disband them, and the loyalty of
  other regiments was seriously called in question.</p>

  <p>But the men whose blindness was responsible for the possibility of mutiny
  were only made blinder by the evidence of coming trouble. With a dozen
  courses open to them, any one of which might have saved the situation, they
  deliberately chose a thirteenth&mdash;two-forked toboggan-slide into
  destruction. To prove their misjudged confidence in the native army, they
  actually disbanded the irregulars led by Byng the Brigadier&mdash;removed the
  European soldiers wherever possible from ammunition-magazine guard-duty,
  replacing them with native companies&mdash;and reprimanded the men whose
  clear sight showed them how events were shaping.</p>

  <p>They reprimanded Byng, as though depriving him of his command were not
  enough. When he protested, as he had a right to do, they showed him Jaimihr's
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Mohammed Gunga told you, did he? Look at this!"</p>

  <p>The letter, most concisely and pointedly written, considering the indirect
  phraseology and caution of the East, deliberately accused Mohammed Gunga and
  a certain Alwa, together with all the Rangars of a whole province, of
  scheming with Maharajah Howrah to overthrow the British rule. It recommended
  the immediate arrest of Mohammed Gunga and stern measures against the
  Rangars.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do about it?" inquired Byng.</p>

  <p>"It's out of our province. A copy of this letter has been sent to the
  proper quarter, and no doubt the story will be investigated. There have been
  all kinds of stories about suttee being practiced in Howrah, and it very
  likely won't be difficult to find a plausible excuse for deposing the
  Maharajah and putting Jaimihr in his place. In the meantime, if Mohammed
  Gunga shows himself in these parts he'll be arrested."</p>

  <p>Byng did then the sort of thing that was fortunately characteristic of the
  men who rose in the nick of time to seize the reins. He hurried to his
  quarters, packed in its case the sword of Color that had once been given him
  by his Queen, and despatched it without a written line of comment to Mohammed
  Gunga. The native who took it was ordered to ride like the devil, overtake
  Mohammed Gunga on the road to Abu, present the sword without explanation, and
  return.</p>

  <p>Cunningham, in spite of himself, had traveled swiftly. The moon lacked two
  nights of being full and two more days would have seen him climbing up the
  fourteen-mile rock road that leads up the purple flanks of Abu, when the ex-
  trooper of Irregulars cantered from a dust cloud, caught up Mohammed Gunga,
  who was riding, as usual, in the rear, and handed him the sword. He held it
  out with both hands. Mohammed Gunga seized it by the middle, and neither said
  a word for the moment.</p>

  <p>In silence Mohammed Gunga drew the blade&mdash;saw Byng's name engraved
  close to the hilt&mdash;recognized the sword, and knew the sender&mdash;
  thought&mdash;and mistook the meaning.</p>

  <p>"Was there no word?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Then take this word back. 'I will return the sword, with Color added to
  it, when the peace of India is won.' Say that, and nothing else."</p>

  <p>"I would rest my horse for a day or two," said the trooper.</p>

  <p>"Neither thou nor yet thy horse will have much rest this side of Eblis!"
  said Mohammed Gunga. "Ride!"</p>

  <p>The trooper wheeled and went with a grin and a salute which he repeated
  twice, leaning back from the saddle for a last look at the man of his own
  race whom Byng had chosen to exalt. He felt himself honored merely to have
  carried the sword. Mohammed Gunga removed his own great saber and handed it
  to one of his own five whom he overtook; then he buckled on the sword of
  Color and spurred until he rode abreast of Cunningham, a hundred yards or
  more ahead of the procession.</p>

  <p>"Sahib," he asked, "did Byng-bahadur say a word or two about listening to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"He did. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I will now say things!"</p>

  <p>The fact that the Brigadier had sent no message other than the sword was
  probably the Rajput's chief reason for talking in riddles still to
  Cunningham. The silence went straight to his Oriental heart&mdash;so to
  speak, set the key for him to play to. But he knew, too, that Cunningham's
  youth would be a handicap should it come to argument; what he was looking for
  was not a counsellor or some one to make plans, for the plans had all been
  laid and cross-laid by the enemy, and Mohammed Gunga knew it. He needed a man
  of decision&mdash;to be flung blindfold into unexpected and unexpecting hell
  wrath, who would lead, take charge, decide on the instant, and lead the way
  out again, with men behind him who would recognize decision when they saw it.
  So he spoke darkly. He understood that the sword meant "Things have started,"
  so with a soldier's courage he proceeded to head Cunningham toward the spot
  where hell was loose.</p>

  <p>"Say ahead!" smiled Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Yonder, sahib, lies Abu. Yonder to the right lies thy road now, not
  forward."</p>

  <p>"I have orders to report at Abu."</p>

  <p>"And I, sahib, orders to advise!"</p>

  <p>"Are you advising me to disobey orders?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput hesitated. "Sahib, have I anything to gain," he asked, "by
  offering the wrong advice?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine so."</p>

  <p>"I advise, now, that we&mdash;thou and I, sahib, and my five turn off
  here&mdash;yonder, where the other trail runs&mdash;letting the party proceed
  to Abu without us."</p>

  <p>"But why, Mohammed Gunga?"</p>

  <p>"There is need of haste, sahib. At Abu there will be delay&mdash;much talk
  with Everton-sahib, and who knows?&mdash;perhaps cancellation of the plan to
  send thee on to Howrah."</p>

  <p>"I'd be damned glad, Mohammed Gunga, not to have to go there!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, look! What is this I wear?"</p>

  <p>"Which?"</p>

  <p>"See here, sahib&mdash;this."</p>

  <p>For the first time Cunningham noticed the fine European workmanship on the
  sword-hilt, and realized that the Rajput's usual plain, workmanlike weapon
  had been replaced.</p>

  <p>"That is Byng-bahadur's sword of Color! It reached me a few minutes ago.
  The man who brought it is barely out of sight. It means, sahib, that the hour
  to act is come!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;this sending thee to Howrah is my doing. Since the day when I
  first heard that the son of Pukka Cunnigan-bahadur was on his way I have
  schemed and planned and contrived to this end. It was at word from me that
  Byng-bahadur signed the transfer papers&mdash;otherwise he would have kept
  thee by him. There are owls&mdash;old women&mdash;men whom Allah has deprived
  of judgment&mdash;drunkards&mdash;fools&mdash;in charge at Peshawar and in
  other places; but there are certain men who know. Byng-bahadur knows. I
  know&mdash;and I will show the way! Let me lead, sahib, for a little while,
  and I will show thee what to lead!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does this sword, sahib, mean nothing? Did Byng-bahadur send it me for
  fun?"</p>

  <p>"But what's the idea? I can't disobey orders, and ride off to&mdash;God
  knows where&mdash;without some excuse. You'll have to tell me why. What's the
  matter? What's happening?"</p>

  <p>"Byng-bahadur sent not one word to me when he sent this sword. To thee he
  said: 'Listen to Mohammed Gunga, even when he seems to lie!' I know that, for
  he told me he had said it. To me he said: 'Take charge, Mohammed Gunga, when
  the hour comes, and rub his innocent young nose hard as you like into the
  middle of the mess!' Ay, sahib, so said he. It is now that I take
  charge."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'But,' said the nylghau,* and the wolf-pack had him! 'But,' said the
  tiger, and the trap door shut! 'But,' said the Hindu, and a priest betrayed
  him! But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I never knew thy father make much use of
  that word!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>nylghau, nilgai</i>&mdash;a large Indian antelope;

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;I have my orders, Mohammed Gunga!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;this sword is a sword of Color&mdash;it stands for Byng-
  bahadur's Color. I have it in my keeping. Mine own Color is a matter somewhat
  dear to me, and I have kept it clean these many years. Now I ask to keep
  thine Color, too, awhile&mdash;making three men's Color. If I fail, then thou
  and I and Byng-bahadur all go down together in good company. If I fail not,
  then, sahib&mdash;Allah is contented when his Color stands!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham drew rein and looked him in the eyes. Gray eyes met brown and
  neither flinched; each read what men of mettle only can read when they see it
  &mdash;the truth, the fearlessness, the thought they understand because it
  lives with them. Cunningham held out his hand.</p>

  <p>Some thirty minutes later Cunningham, Mohammed Gunga, and the five, with a
  much-diminished mule-train bumping in their wake, were headed westward on a
  dry, hot trail, while the time-expired and convalescent escort plodded south.
  The escort carried word that Cunningham had heard of trouble to the west, and
  had turned off to investigate it.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER 23</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Quoth little red jackal, famishing, "Lo,<br>
  Yonder a priest and a soldier go;<br>
  You can see farthest, and you ought to know,&mdash;<br>
  Which shall I wander with, carrion crow?"<br>
  The crow cawed back at him, "Ignorant beast!<br>
  Soldiers get glory, but none of the feast;<br>
  Soldiers work hardest, and snaffle the least.<br>
  Take my advice on it&mdash;Follow the priest!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was two hours after sunrise on the second day that
  followed Cunningham's desertion of his party when he and Mohammed Gunga first
  caught sight of a blue, baked rock rising sheer out of a fringe of green on
  the dazzling horizon. It was a freak of nature&mdash;a point pushed through
  the level crust of bone-dry earth, and left to glitter there alone.</p>

  <p>"That is my cousin Alwa's place!" exclaimed Mohammed Gunga, and he seemed
  to draw a world of consolation from the fact.</p>

  <p>The sight loosed his tongue at last; he rode by Cunningham, and deigned an
  explanation now, at least, of what had led to what might happen. He wasted
  little breath on prophecy, but he was eloquent in building up a basis from
  which Cunningham might draw his own deductions. They had ridden through the
  cool of the night in easy stages, and should have camped at dawn; but
  Mohammed Gunga had insisted that the tired animals could carry them for three
  hours longer.</p>

  <p>"A soldier's horse must rest at the other end sahib," he had laughed. "Who
  knows that they have not sent from Abu to arrest both thee and me?" And he
  had not vouchsafed another word until, over the desert glare, his cousin's
  aerie had blazed out, beating back the molten sun-rays.</p>

  <p>"It looks hotter than the horns of hell!" said Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"The horns of hell, sahib, are what we leave behind us! They grow hot now!
  Thy countrymen&mdash;the men who hated thee so easily&mdash;heated them and
  sit now between them for their folly!"</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean? 'Pon my soul and Color, Risaldar, you talk more riddles
  in five minutes than I ever heard before in all my life!"</p>

  <p>"There be many riddles I have not told yet&mdash;riddles of which I do not
  know the answer. Read me this one. Why did the British Government annex the
  state of Oudh? All the best native soldiers came from Oudh, or nearly all.
  They were loyal once; but can a man be fairly asked to side against his own?
  If Oudh should rise in rebellion, what would the soldiers do?"</p>

  <p>"Dunno, I'm sure," said Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Read me this one, then. By pacifying both Mohammedan and Hindu and by
  letting both keep their religion, by sometimes playing one against the other
  and by being just, the British Government has become supreme from the
  Himalayas to the ocean. Can you tell me why they now issue cartridges for the
  new rifles that are soaked in the fat of cows and pigs, thus insulting both
  Mohammedan and Hindu?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it was so."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, it is! These damned new cartridges and this new drill-sahib, I
  &mdash;I who am loyal to the marrow of my bones&mdash;would no more touch
  those cartridges&mdash;nor bite them, as the drill decrees&mdash;than I would
  betray thee! Pig's fat! Ugh!"</p>

  <p>He spat with Mohammedan eloquence and wiped his lips on his tunic sleeve
  before resuming.</p>

  <p>"Then, like a flint and steel, to light the train that they have laid,
  they loose these missionaries, in a swarm, from one end of India to the
  other. Why? What say one and all? Mohammedan and Hindu both say it is a plot,
  first to make them lose their own religion by defilement, then to make
  Christians of them! Foolishness to talk thus? Nay! It was foolishness to act
  thus!</p>

  <p>"Sahib, peace follows in the wake of soldiers, as we know. Time and time
  again the peace of India has been ripped asunder at the whim of priests!
  These padre people, preaching new damnation everywhere, are the flint and
  steel for the tinder of the cartridge fat!"</p>

  <p>"I never knew you to croak before, Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>"Nor am I croaking. I am praising Allah, who has sent thee now to the
  place whence the wind will come to fan the hell flames that presently will
  burn. The wind will blow hot or cold&mdash;for or against the government
  &mdash;according as you and I and certain others act when opportunity
  arrives! See yonder!"</p>

  <p>They had been seen, evidently, for horsemen&mdash;looking like black ants
  on the desert&mdash;seemed to have crawled from the bowels of the living rock
  and were galloping in their direction.</p>

  <p>"Friends?" asked Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Friends, indeed! But they have yet to discover whether we are friends.
  They set me thinking, sahib. Alwa is well known on this country-side and none
  dare raid his place; few would waste time trying. Therefore, it is all one to
  him who passes along this road; and he takes no trouble, as a rule, to send
  his men out in skirmishing order when a party comes in view. Why, then, does
  he trouble now?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't say. I don't know Alwa."</p>

  <p>"I am thinking, sahib, that the cloud has burst at last! A blood-red
  cloud! Alwa is neither scare-monger nor robber; when he sends out armed men
  to inspect strangers on the sky-line, there is war! Sahib, I grow young
  again! Had people listened to me&mdash;had they called me anything but fool
  when I warned them&mdash;thou and I would have been cooped up now in Agra, or
  in Delhi, or Lucknow, or Peshawar! Now we are free on the plains of
  Rajputana&mdash;within a ride of fifty of my blood-relations, and they each
  within reach of others! Ho! I can hear the thunder of a squadron at my back
  again! I am young, sahib&mdash;young! My old joints loosen! Allah send the
  cloud has burst at last&mdash;I bring to two thousand Rangars a new
  Cunnigan-bahadur! Thy father's son shall learn what Cunnigan-bahadur
  taught!"</p>

  <p>He lapsed into silence, watching the advancing horsemen, who swooped down
  on them in an ever-closing fan formation. His tired horse sensed the thrill
  that tingled through its rider's veins, and pranced again, curving his neck
  and straining at the bit until Mohammed Gunga steadied him. The five behind
  &mdash;even the mule-drivers too&mdash;detected excitement in the air, and
  the little column closed in on its leaders. All eyes watched the
  neck-and-neck approach of Alwa's men, until Cunningham at last could see
  their turbans and make out that they were Rangars, not Hindus. Then he and
  the Risaldar drew rein.</p>

  <p>There were twenty who raced toward them, but no Alwa.</p>

  <p>"It is as I thought!" declared Mohammed Gunga. "It is war, sahib! He has
  summoned men from his estates. As a rule, he can afford but ten men for that
  fort of his, and he would not send all his men to meet us&mdash;he has a
  garrison up yonder!"</p>

  <p>Like blown dust-devils the twenty raced to them, and drew up thundering
  within a lance-length. A sword-armed Rangar with a little gold lace on his
  sleeve laughed loud as he saluted, greeting Mohammed Gunga first. The
  Risaldar accepted his salute with iron dignity.</p>

  <p>"Forgive him, sahib!" he whispered to Cunningham. "The jungli* knows no
  better! He will learn whom to salute first when Alwa has said his say!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>jungli, junglee</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a savage; a
  primitive native; a "man of the woods." See the <i><a href=

  website. ]</p>

  <p>But Cunningham was in no mood just then to stand on military ceremony or
  right of precedence. He was too excited, too inquisitive, too occupied with
  the necessity for keeping calm in the face of what most surely looked like
  the beginning of big happenings. These horsemen of Alwa's rode, and looked,
  and laughed like soldiers, new-stripped of the hobble ropes of peace, and
  their very seat in the untanned saddles&mdash;tight down, loose-swaying from
  the hips, and free&mdash;was confirmation of Mohammed Gunga's words.</p>

  <p>They wheeled in a cloud and led the way, opening a little in the center to
  let the clouds of sand their horses kicked up blow to the right and left of
  Cunningham and his men. Not a word was spoken&mdash;not a question asked or a
  piece of news exchanged&mdash;until the whole party halted at the foot of
  Alwa's fortress home&mdash;a great iron gate in front of them and garden land
  on either side&mdash;watered by the splashing streamlet from the heights
  above.</p>

  <p>"Men of the house of Kachwaha* have owned and held this place, sahib,
  since Allah made it!" whispered Mohammed Gunga. "Men say that Alwa has no
  right to it; they lie! His father's father won the dower-right!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kachwaha, Kachhwaha, Kachhvaha</i>&mdash;a Rajput
  clan which formerly ruled the kingdom of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India. The
  Kachwahas claim descent from Rama, ancient king of Ayodhya and hero of the
  Ramayana ... the Kachwahas furnished the Mughals (Moguls)some of their most
  distinguished generals. Excerpted from <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachhwaha">Wikipedia</a>. ]</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the rising of the iron gate. It seemed solid,
  without even an eyehole in it. It was wide enough to let four horses under
  side by side, and for all its weight it rose as suddenly and evenly as though
  a giant's hand had lifted it. Immediately behind it, like an actor waiting
  for the stage-curtain to rise, Alwa bestrode his war-horse in the middle of a
  roadway. He saluted with drawn Color, and this time Cunningham replied.</p>

  <p>Almost instantly the man who had led the gallopers and had saluted
  Mohammed Gunga spurred his horse up close to Cunningham and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Pardon, sahib! I did not know! Am I forgiven?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Cunningham, remembering then that a Rajput, and a Rangar more
  particularly, thinks about points of etiquette before considering what to
  eat. Alwa growled out a welcome, rammed his Color home, and wheeled without
  another word, showing the way at a walk&mdash;which was all a wild goat could
  have accomplished&mdash;up a winding road, hewn out of the solid mountain,
  that corkscrewed round and round upon itself until it gave onto the
  battlemented summit. There he dismounted, ordered his men to their quarters,
  and for the first time took notice of his cousin.</p>

  <p>"I have thy missionary and his daughter, three horses for thee, and thy
  man," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Did Ali Partab bring them?"</p>

  <p>"Nay. It was I brought Ali Partab and the rest! My promise is
  redeemed!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga thrust his sword-hilt out and smiled back at him. "I
  present Raff-Cunnigan-sahib&mdash;son of Pukka-Cunnigan-bahadur!" he
  announced.</p>

  <p>Alwa drew himself up to his full height and eyed young Cunningham as a
  buyer eyes a war-horse, inch by inch. The youngster, who had long since
  learned to actually revel in the weird sensation of a hundred pairs of eyes
  all fixed on him at once, felt this one man's gaze go over him as though he
  were being probed. He thanked his God he had no fat to be detected, and that
  his legs were straight, and that his tunic fitted him!</p>

  <p>"Salaam, bahadur," said Alwa slowly. "I knew thy father. So&mdash;thou
  &mdash;art&mdash;his&mdash;son. Welcome. There is room here always for a
  guest. I have other guests with whom you might care to speak. I will have a
  room made ready. Have I leave to ask questions of my cousin here?"</p>

  <p>Cunningham bowed in recognition of his courtesy, and walked away to a
  point whence he could look from the beetling parapet away and away across
  desert that shone hot and hazy-rimmed on every side. If this were a man on
  whom he must depend for following&mdash;if any of all the more than hints
  dropped by the risaldar were true&mdash;it seemed to him that his reception
  was a little too chilly to be hopeful.</p>

  <p>After a minute or two he turned his eyes away from the dazzling plain
  below and faced about to inspect the paved courtyard. Round it, on three
  sides of a parallelogram, there ran a beautifully designed and wonderfully
  worked-out veranda-fronted building, broken here and there by cobbled
  passages that evidently led to other buildings on the far edge of the rock.
  In the center, covered by a roof like a temple-dome in miniature, was the
  ice-cold spring, whose existence made the fort tenable. Under the veranda, on
  a long, low lounge, was a sight that arrested his attention&mdash;held him
  spell-bound&mdash;drew him, tingling in a way he could not have explained
  &mdash;drew him&mdash;drew him, slow-footed, awkward, red&mdash;across the
  courtyard.</p>

  <p>He heard Mohammed Gunga swear aloud; he recognized the wording of the
  belly-growled Rangar oath; but it did not occur to him that what he saw
  &mdash;what was drawing him&mdash;could be connected with it. He looked
  straight ahead and walked ahead&mdash;reached the edge of the veranda
  &mdash;took his helmet off&mdash;and stood still, feeling like an idiot, with
  the sun full on his head.</p>

  <p>"I'd advise you to step into the shade," said a voice that laughed more
  sweetly than the chuckling spring. "I don't know who you are, but I'm more
  glad to see you than I ever was in my life to see anybody. I can't get up,
  because I'm too stiff; the ride to here from Howrah City all but killed me,
  and I'm only here still because I couldn't ride another yard. My father will
  be out in a moment. He's half-dead too."</p>

  <p>"My name is Cunningham."</p>

  <p>"I'm Miss McClean. My father was a missionary in Howrah."</p>

  <p>She nodded to a chair beside her, and Cunningham took it, feeling awkward,
  as men of his type usually do when they meet a woman in a strange place.</p>

  <p>"How in the world did you get in?" she asked him. "It's two days now since
  the Alwa-sahib told us that the whole country is in rebellion. How is it that
  you managed to reach here? According to Alwa, no white man's life is safe in
  the open, and he only told me today that he wouldn't let me go away even if I
  were well enough to ride."</p>

  <p>"First I've heard of rebellion!" said Cunningham aghast at the notion of
  hearing news like that a second hand, and from a woman.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't Alwa told you?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't had time to, yet."</p>

  <p>"Then, you'd better ask him. If what he say is true&mdash;and I think he
  tells the truth&mdash;the natives mean to kill us all, or drive us out of
  India. Of course they can't do it, but they mean to try. He has been more
  than kind&mdash;more than hospitable&mdash;more than chivalrous. Just because
  he gave his word to another Rangar, he risked his life about a dozen times to
  get my father and me and Ali Partab out of Howrah. But, I don't think he
  quite liked doing it&mdash;and&mdash;this is in confidence &mdash;if I were
  asked&mdash;and speaking just from intuition&mdash;I should say he is in
  sympathy with the rebellion!"</p>

  <p>"How long have you been here?" asked Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Several days&mdash;ten, I think. It seemed strange at first and rather
  awful to be lodged on a rock like this in a section of a Rangar's harem! Yes,
  there are several women here behind the scenes, but I only see the waiting-
  women. I've forgotten time; the news about rebellion seems too awful to leave
  room for any other thought."</p>

  <p>"Who was the Rangar to whom Alwa gave his word? Not Mohammed Gunga, by any
  chance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm&mdash;!" Cunningham clipped off the participle just in time.
  "There is something, then, in the talk about rebellion! That man's been
  talking in riddles to me ever since I came to India, and it looks as though
  he knew long in advance."</p>

  <p>He was about to cross-examine Miss McClean rigorously, even at the risk of
  seeming either rude or else frightened; but before his lips could frame
  another question he caught sight of Mohammed Gunga making signals to him. He
  affected to ignore the signals. He objected to being kept in the dark so
  utterly, and wished to find out a little for himself before listening to what
  the Rangars had to say. But Mohammed Gunga started over to him.</p>

  <p>He could not hear the remark Mohammed Gunga made to Alwa over his shoulder
  as he came.</p>

  <p>"Had I remembered there was a woman of his own race here, I would have
  plunged him straight into the fighting! Now there will be the devil first to
  pay!"</p>

  <p>"He has decision in at least one thing!" grinned Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Something that I think thou lackest, cousin!" came the hot retort.</p>

  <p>Alwa turned his back with a shake of his head and a thin-lipped smile
  &mdash;then disappeared through a green door in the side of what seemed like
  solid rock. A moment later Mohammed Gunga stood near Cunningham,
  saluting.</p>

  <p>"We ask the Color of a consultation, sahib."</p>

  <p>Cunningham rose, a shade regretfully, and followed into the rock-walled
  cavern into which Alwa had preceded them. It was nearly square&mdash;a hollow
  bubble in the age-old lava&mdash;axe-trimmed many hundred years ago. What
  light there was came in through three long slits that gave an archer's view
  of the plain and of the zigzag roadway from the iron gate below. It was cool,
  for the rock roof was fifty or more feet thick, and the silence of it seemed
  like the nestling-place of peace.</p>

  <p>They sat down on wooden benches round the walls, with their soldier legs
  stretched out in front of them. Alwa broke silence first, and it was of
  anything but peace he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;now, let us see whose throats we are to slit!" he started
  cheerfully.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER 24</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Achilles had a tender spot<br>
  That even guarding gods forgot,<br>
  When clothing him in armour;<br>
  And I have proved this charge o' mine<br>
  For fear, and sloth, and vice, and wine,<br>
  But clear forgot the charmer!</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Alwa-sahib knew more English than he was willing to
  admit. In the first place, he had the perfectly natural dislike of committing
  his thoughts to any language other than his own when anything serious was the
  subject of discussion; in the second place, he had little of Mohammed Gunga's
  last-ditch loyalty. Not that Alwa could be disloyal; he had not got it in
  him; but as yet he had seen no good reason for pledging himself and his to
  the British cause.</p>

  <p>So for more than ten minutes he chose to sit in apparent dudgeon, his
  hands folded in front of him on the hilt of his tremendous Color, growling
  out a monologue in his own language for Mohammed Gunga's benefit. Then
  Mohammed Gunga silenced him with an uplifted hand, and turned to translate to
  Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"It would seem, sahib, that even while we rode to Abu the rebellion was
  already raging! It burst suddenly. They have mutinied at Berhampur, and slain
  their officers. Likewise at Meerut, and at all the places in between. At
  Kohat, in this province they have slain every white man, woman, and child,
  and also at Arjpur and Sohlat. The rebels are hurrying to Delhi, where they
  have proclaimed new rule, under the descendants of the old-time kings. Word
  of all this came before dawn today, by a messenger from Maharajah Howrah to
  my cousin here. My cousin stands pledged to uphold Howrah on his throne;
  Howrah is against the British; Jaimihr, his brother, is in arms against
  Howrah."</p>

  <p>"Why did the Alwa-sahib pledge himself to Howrah's cause?"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga&mdash;who knew quite well&mdash;saw fit to translate the
  question. With a little sign of irritation Alwa growled his answer.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that for the safety of two Christian missionaries, for
  whom he has no esteem at all, he was forced to swear allegiance to a Hindu
  whom he esteems even less. He says that his word is given!"</p>

  <p>"Does he mean that he would like me and the missionaries to leave his home
  at once&mdash;do we embarrass him?"</p>

  <p>Again Mohammed Gunga&mdash;this time with a grin&mdash;saw fit to ask
  before he answered.</p>

  <p>"He says, 'God forbid,' sahib; 'a guest is guest!'"</p>

  <p>Cunningham reflected for a moment, then leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Tell him this!" he said slowly. "I am glad to be his guest, but, if this
  story of rebellion is true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is true, sahib! More than true! There is much more to be told!"</p>

  <p>"Then, I can only accept his hospitality as the representative of my
  government! I stay here officially, or not at all. It is for him to
  answer!"</p>

  <p>"Now, Allah be praised!" swore Mohammed Gunga. "I knew we had a man! That
  is well said, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"The son of Cunnigan-bahadur is welcome here on any terms at all!" growled
  Alwa when Mohammed Gunga had translated. "All the rebels in all India, all
  trying at once, would fail to take this fort of mine, had I a larger
  garrison. But what Rangar on this countryside will risk his life and estates
  on behalf of a cause that is already lost? If they come to hold my fort for
  me, the rebels will burn their houses. The British Raj is doomed. We Rangars
  have to play for our own stake!"</p>

  <p>Then Mohammed Gunga rose and paced the floor like a man in armour, tugging
  at his beard and kicking at his scabbard each time that he turned at either
  end.</p>

  <p>"What Rangar in this province would have had one yard of land to his name
  but for this man's father?" he demanded. "In his day we fought, all of us,
  for what was right! We threw our weight behind him when he led, letting
  everything except obedience go where the devil wanted it! What came of that?
  Good tithes, good report, good feeling, peace!"</p>

  <p>"And then, the zamindary laws!" growled Alwa. "Then the laws that took
  away from us full two-thirds of our revenue!"</p>

  <p>"We had had no revenue, except for Cunnigan-bahadur!"</p>

  <p>It dawned on Cunningham exactly why and how he came to be there! He
  understood now that Mohammed Gunga had told nothing less than truth when he
  declared it had been through his scheming, and no other man's, that he
  &mdash;Cunningham&mdash;whose sole thought was to be a soldier, had been
  relegated to oblivion and politics! He understood why Byng had signed the
  transfer, and he knew&mdash;knew&mdash;knew&mdash;deep down inside him that
  his chance had come!</p>

  <p>"It seems that another Cunningham is to have the Color of preserving
  Rangars' titles for them," he smiled. "How many horsemen could the Alwa-sahib
  raise?"</p>

  <p>"That would depend!" Alwa was in no mood to commit himself.</p>

  <p>"At the most&mdash;at a pinch&mdash;in case of direst need, and for a
  cause that all agreed on?"</p>

  <p>"Two thousand."</p>

  <p>"Horsed and armed?"</p>

  <p>"And ready!"</p>

  <p>"And you, Alwa-sahib&mdash;are you pledged to fight against the
  British?"</p>

  <p>"Not in so many words. I swore to uphold Howrah on his throne. He is
  against the British."</p>

  <p>"You swore to help smash his brother, Jaimihr?"</p>

  <p>"If I were needed."</p>

  <p>"And Jaimihr too is against the British?"</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr is for Jaimihr, and has a personal affair with me!"</p>

  <p>"I must think," said Cunningham, getting up. "I can think better alone.
  D'you mind if I go outside for a while, and come back later to tell you what
  I think?"</p>

  <p>Alwa arose and held the door open for him&mdash;stood and watched him
  cross the courtyard&mdash;then turned and laughed at Mohammed Gunga.</p>

  <p>"Straight over to the woman!" he grinned. "This leader of thine seems in
  leading-strings himself already!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga cursed, and cursed again as his own eyes confirmed what
  Alwa said.</p>

  <p>"I tried him all the ways there are, except that one way!" he declared.
  "May Allah forgive my oversight! I should have got him well entangled with a
  woman before he reached Peshawar! He should have been heart-broken by this
  time&mdash;rightly, he should have been desperate with unrequited love!
  Byng-bahadur could have managed it! Byng-bahadur would have managed it, had I
  thought to advise him!"</p>

  <p>He stood, looking over very gloomily at Cunningham, making a dozen wild
  plans for getting rid of Miss McClean&mdash;by no means forgetting poison
  &mdash;and the height of Alwa's aerie from the plain below! He would have
  been considerably calmer, could he have heard what Cunningham and Miss
  McClean were saying.</p>

  <p>The missionary was with her now&mdash;ill and exhausted from the combined
  effects of excitement, horror, and the unaccustomed ride across the
  desert&mdash;most anxious for his daughter&mdash;worried, to the verge of
  desperation, by the ghastly news of the rebellion.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cunningham, I hope you are the forerunner of a British force?" he
  hazarded.</p>

  <p>But Cunningham was too intent on cross-examination to waste time on giving
  any information.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me, quite quietly and without hurry, all you can about
  Howrah," he said, sitting close to Miss McClean. "I want you to understand
  that I am the sole representative of my government in the whole district, and
  that whatever can be done depends very largely on what information I can get.
  I have been talking to the Alwa-sahib, but he seems too obsessed with his own
  predicament to be able to make things quite clear. Now, go ahead and tell me
  what you know about conditions in the city. Remember, you are under orders!
  Try and consider yourself a scout, reporting information to your officer.
  Tell me every single thing, however unimportant."</p>

  <p>On the far side of the courtyard Alwa and Mohammed Gunga had gone to lean
  over the parapet and watch something that seemed to interest both of them
  intently. There were twenty or more men, lined round the ramparts on the
  lookout, and they all too seemed spellbound, but Cunningham was too engrossed
  in Miss McClean's story of the happenings in Howrah City to take notice. Now
  and then her father would help her out with an interjected comment;
  occasionally Cunningham would stop her with a question, or would ask her to
  repeat some item; but, for more than an hour she spun a clear-strung
  narrative that left very little to imagination and included practically all
  there was to know.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," asked Cunningham "that this brute Jaimihr really wants to
  make you Maharani?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't say," she shuddered. "You know, there have been several
  instances of European women having practically sold themselves to native
  princes; there have been stories&mdash;I have heard them&mdash;of English
  women marrying Rajahs, and regretting it. There is no reason why he should
  not be in earnest, and he certainly seemed to be."</p>

  <p>"And this treasure? Of course, I have heard tales about it, but I thought
  they were just tales."</p>

  <p>"That treasure is really there, and its amount must be fabulous. I have
  been told that there are jewels there which would bring a Rajah's ransom, and
  gold enough to offset the taxes of the whole of India for a year or two. I've
  no doubt the stories are exaggerated, but the treasure is real enough, and
  big enough to make the throne worth fighting for. Jaimihr counts on being
  able to break the power of the priests and broach the treasure."</p>

  <p>"And Jaimihr is&mdash;er&mdash;in love with you!"</p>

  <p>"He tried very hard to prove it, in his own objectionable way!"</p>

  <p>"And Jaimihr wants the throne&mdash;and Howrah wants to send a force
  against the British, but dare not move because of Jaimihr&mdash;I have
  Mohammed Gunga and five or six men to depend on&mdash;the Rangars are sitting
  on the fence&mdash;and the government has its hands full! The lookout's
  bright! I think I see the way through!"</p>

  <p>"You are forgetting me." The missionary spread his broad stooped
  shoulders. "I am a missionary first, but next to that I have my country's
  cause more at heart than anything. I place myself under your orders, Mr.
  Cunningham."</p>

  <p>"I too," said Miss McClean. She was looking at him keenly as he gazed away
  into nothing through slightly narrowed eyes. Vaguely, his attitude reminded
  her of a picture she had once seen of the Duke of Wellington; there was the
  same mastery, the same far vision, the same poise of self-contained power.
  His nose was not like the Iron Duke's, for young Cunningham's had rather more
  tolerance in its outline and less of Roman overbearing; but the eyes, and the
  mouth, and the angle of the jaw were so like Wellesley's as to force a smile.
  "A woman isn't likely to be much use in a case like this&mdash;but, one never
  knows. My country comes first."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he answered quietly. And as he turned his head to flash one
  glance at each of them, she recognized what Mohammed Gunga had gloated over
  from the first&mdash;the grim decision, that will sacrifice all&mdash; take
  full responsibility&mdash;and use all means available for the one unflinching
  purpose of the game in hand. She knew that minute, and her father knew, that
  if she could be used&mdash;in any way at all&mdash;he would make use of
  her.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!" she nodded. "I'll obey!"</p>

  <p>"And I will not prevent!" said Duncan McClean, smiling and straightening
  his spectacles.</p>

  <p>Cunningham left them and walked over to the parapet, where the whole
  garrison was bending excitedly now above the battlement. There were more than
  forty men, most of them clustered near Alwa and Mohammed Gunga. Mohammed
  Gunga was busy counting.</p>

  <p>"Eight hundred!" he exclaimed, as Cunningham drew near.</p>

  <p>"Eight hundred what, Mohammed Gunga? Come and see, sahib."</p>

  <p>Cunningham leaned over, and beheld a mounted column, trailing along the
  desert road in wonderfully good formation.</p>

  <p>"Where are they from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr's men, from Howrah!"</p>

  <p>"That means," growled Alwa, "that the Hindu pig Jaimihr has more than half
  the city at his back. He has left behind ten men for every one he brings with
  him&mdash;sufficient to hold Howrah in check. Otherwise he would never have
  dared come here. He hopes to settle his little private quarrel with me first,
  before dealing with his brother! Who told him, I wonder, that I was pledged
  to Howrah?"</p>

  <p>"He reckons he has caught thee napping in this fort of thine!" laughed
  Mohammed Gunga. "He means to bottle up the Rangars' leader, and so checkmate
  all of them!"</p>

  <p>The eight hundred horsemen on the plain below rode carelessly through
  Alwa's gardens, leaving trampled confusion in their wake, and lined up
  &mdash;with Jaimihr at their head&mdash;immediately before the great iron
  gate. A moment later four men rode closer and hammered on it with their
  lance-ends.</p>

  <p>"Go down and speak to them!" commanded Alwa, and a man dropped down the
  zigzag roadway like a goat, taking short cuts from level to level, until he
  stood on a pinnacle of rock that overhung the gate. Ten minutes later he
  returned, breathing hard with the effort of his climb.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr demands the missionaries&mdash;particularly the Miss-sahib
  &mdash;also quarters and food!" he reported.</p>

  <p>"Quarters and food he shall have!" swore Alwa, looking down at the Prince
  who sat his charger in the center of the roadway. "Did he deign a
  threat?"</p>

  <p>"He said that in fifteen minutes he will burst the gate in, unless he is
  first admitted!"</p>

  <p>Duncan McClean walked over, limping painfully, and peered over the
  precipice.</p>

  <p>"Unfriendly?" he asked, and Mohammed Gunga heard him.</p>

  <p>"Thy friend Jaimihr, sahib! His teeth are all but visible from here!"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"He demands admittance&mdash;also thee and thy daughter!"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;art thou a priest?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"One, then, who prays?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"For dead men, ever? For the dying?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Aloud?"</p>

  <p>"On occasion, yes."</p>

  <p>"Then pray now! There will be many dead and dying on the plain below in
  less than fifteen minutes! Hindus, for all I know, would benefit by prayer.
  They have too many gods, and their gods are too busy fighting for ascendancy
  to listen. Pray thou, a little!"</p>

  <p>There came a long shout from the plain, and Alwa sent a man again to
  listen. He came back with a message that Jaimihr granted amnesty to all who
  would surrender, and that he would be pleased to accept Alwa's allegiance if
  offered to him.</p>

  <p>"I will offer the braggart something in the way of board and lodging that
  will astonish him!" growled Alwa. "Eight men to horse! The first eight! That
  will do! Back to the battlement, the rest of you!"</p>

  <p>They had raced for the right to loose themselves against eight
  hundred!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER 25</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Oh, duck and run&mdash;the hornets come!<br>
  Oh, jungli! Clear the way!<br>
  The nest's ahum&mdash;the hornets come!<br>
  The sharp-stinged, harp-winged hornets come!<br>
  Nay, jungli! When the hornets come,<br>
  It isn't well to stay!</p><br>

  <p class="first">ALWA ordered ten men down into the bowels of the rock
  itself, where great wheels with a chain attached to them were forced round to
  lift the gate. Next he stationed a signaler with a cord in either hand, above
  the parapet, to notify the men below exactly when to set the simple machinery
  in motion. His eight clattered out from the stables on the far side of the
  rock, and his own charger was brought to him, saddled.</p>

  <p>Then, in a second, it was evident why Rajputs do not rule in
  Rajputana.</p>

  <p>"I ride too with my men!" declared Mohammed Gunga.</p>

  <p>"Nay! This is my affair&mdash;my private quarrel with Jaimihr!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga turned to Ali Partab, who had been a shadow to him ever
  since he came.</p>

  <p>"Turn out my five, and bring my charger!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>"No, I say!" Alwa had his hand already on his Color hilt. "There is room
  for eight and no more. Four following four abreast, and one ahead to lead
  them. I and my men know how to do this. I and my men have a personal dispute
  with Jaimihr. Stay thou here!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga's five and Ali Partab came clattering out so fast as to
  lead to the suspicion that their horses had been already saddled. Mohammed
  Gunga mounted.</p>

  <p>"Lead on, cousin!" he exclaimed. "I will follow thy lead, but I come!"</p>

  <p>Then Alwa did what a native nearly always will do. He turned to a man not
  of his own race, whom he believed he could trust to be impartial.</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;have I no rights in my own house?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly you have," said Cunningham, who was wondering more than
  anything what weird, wild trick these horsemen meant to play. No man in his
  senses would have dared to ride a horse at more than foot-pace down the path.
  Was there another path? he wondered. At least, if eight men were about to
  charge into eight hundred, it would be best to keep his good friend Mohammed
  Gunga out of it, he decided.</p>

  <p>"Risaldar!" The veteran was always most amenable to reason when addressed
  by his military title. "Who of us two is senior&mdash;thou or I?"</p>

  <p>"By Allah, not I, sahib! I am thy servant!"</p>

  <p>"I accept your service, and I order you to stay with your men up here with
  me!"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga saluted and dismounted, and his six followed suit, looking
  as disappointed as children just deprived of a vacation. Alwa wheeled his
  horse in front of Cunningham and saluted too.</p>

  <p>"For that service, sahib, I am thy friend!" he muttered. "That was right
  and reasonable, and a judgment quickly given! Thy friend, bahadur!" He spoke
  low on purpose, but Mohammed Gunga heard him, caught Cunningham's eye, and
  grinned. He saw a way to save his face, at all events.</p>

  <p>"That was a trick well turned, sahib!" he whispered, as Alwa moved away.
  "Alwa will listen in future when Cunnigan-bahadur speaks!"</p>

  <p>"Go down and tell Jaimihr that I come in person!" ordered Alwa, and the
  man dropped down the cliff side for the third time; they could hear his
  voice, high-pitched, resounding off the rock, and they caught a faint murmur
  of the answer. Below, Jaimihr could be seen waiting patiently, checking his
  restive war-horse with a long-cheeked bit, and waiting, ready to ride under
  the gate the moment it was opened. Rosemary McClean came over; she and
  Cunningham and the missionary leaned together over the battlement and
  watched.</p>

  <p>"We might do some execution with rifles from here," Cunningham suggested;
  "I believe I'll send for mine." But Mohammed Gunga overheard him.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! No shooting will be necessary. Watch!"</p>

  <p>There was a clatter of hoofs, and they all looked up in time to see the
  tails of the last four chargers disappearing round the corner, downward. They
  had gone&mdash;full pelt&mdash;down a path that a man might hesitate to take!
  From where they stood, there was an archer's view of every inch of the only
  rock-hewn road that led from the gate to the summit of the cliff; an enemy
  who had burst the gate in would have had to climb in the teeth of a searching
  hail of missiles, with little chance of shooting back.</p>

  <p>They could see the gate itself, and Jaimihr on the other side. And,
  swooping&mdash;shooting&mdash;sliding down the trail like a storm-loosed
  avalanche, they could see the nine go, led by Alwa. No living creature could
  have looked away!</p>

  <p>Below, entirely unconscious of the coming shock, the mounted sepoys waited
  behind Jaimihr in four long, straight lines. Jaimihr himself, with a
  heavy-hilted scimitar held upward at the "carry," was about four charger
  lengths beyond the iron screen, ready to spur through. Close by him were a
  dozen, waiting to ram a big beam in and hold up the gate when it had opened.
  And, full-tilt down the gorge, flash-tipped like a thunderbolt,
  grey-turbaned, reckless, whirling death ripped down on them.</p>

  <p>They caught sound of the hammering hoofs too late. Two gongs boomed in the
  rock. The windlass creaked. Five seconds too late Jaimihr gathered up his
  reins, spurred, wheeled, and shouted to the men behind him. The great gate
  rose, like the jaws of a hungry monster, and the nine&mdash;streaking too
  fast down far too steep a slide to stop themselves&mdash;burst straight out
  under it and struck, as a wind blast smites a poppy-field.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr was borne backward&mdash;carried off his horse. Alwa and the first
  four rode him down, and crashed through the four-deep line beyond; the second
  four pounced on him, gathered him, and followed. Before the lines could form
  again the whole nine wheeled&mdash;as a wind-eddy spins on its own
  axis&mdash;and burst through back again, the horses racing neck and neck, and
  the sabers cutting down a swath to screech and swear and gurgle in among the
  trampled garden stuff.</p>

  <p>They came back in a line, all eight abreast, Alwa leading only by a
  length. At the opening, four horses&mdash;two on either side&mdash;slid, rump
  to the ground, until their noses touched the rock. Alwa and four dashed
  through and under; the rest recovered, spun on their haunches, and followed.
  The gongs boomed again down in the belly of the rock, and the gate clanged
  shut.</p>

  <p>"That was good," said Mohammed Gunga quietly. "Now, watch again!"</p>

  <p>Almost before the words had left his lips, a hail of lead barked out from
  twenty vantage-points, and the smoke showed where some forty men were
  squinting down steel barrels, shooting as rapidly and as rottenly as natives
  of India usually do. They did little execution; but before Alwa and his eight
  had climbed up the steep track to the summit, patting their horses' necks and
  reviling Jaimihr as they came, the cavalry below had scampered out of range,
  leaving their dead and wounded where they lay.</p>

  <p>"How is that for a start, sahib?" demanded Mohammed Gunga exultantly, as
  two men deposited the disheveled Jaimihr on his feet, and the Prince glared
  around him like a man awaking from a dream. "How is that for a
  beginning?"</p>

  <p>"As bad as could be!" answered Cunningham. "It was well executed&mdash;
  bold&mdash;clever&mdash;anything you like, Mohammed Gunga, but&mdash;if I'd
  been asked I'd have sooner made the devil prisoner! Jaimihr is no use at all
  to us in here. Outside, he'd be veritable godsend!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER 26</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">There is war to the North should I risk and ride forth,<br>
  And a fight to the South, too, I'm thinking;<br>
  There is war in the East, and one battle at least<br>
  In the West between eating and drinking.<br>
  I'm allowed to rejoice in an excellent choice<br>
  Of plans for a soldier of mettle,<br>
  For all of them mean bloody war and rapine.<br>
  So&mdash;on which should a gentleman settle?</p><br>

  <p class="first">WITH his muscles strained and twisted (for his Rangar
  capturers had dragged him none too gently) and with his jeweled puggree all
  awry, Jaimihr did not lack dignity. He held his chin high, although he gazed
  at the bubbling spring thirstily; and, thirsty though he must have been, he
  asked no favors.</p>

  <p>One of Alwa's men brought him a brass dipper full of water, after washing
  it out first thoroughly and ostentatiously. But Jaimihr smiled. His caste
  forbade. He waved away the offering much as Caesar may have waved aside a
  crown, with an air of condescending mightiness too proud to know
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"Go, help thyself!" growled Alwa; and Jaimihr walked to the spring without
  haste, knelt down, and dipped up water with his hand.</p>

  <p>"Now to a cell with him!" commanded Alwa, before the Prince had time to
  slake a more than ordinary thirst. Jaimihr stood upright as four men closed
  in on him, and looked straight in the eyes of every one in turn. Rosemary
  McClean stepped back, to hide herself behind Cunningham's broad shoulders,
  but Jaimihr saw her and his proud smile broadened to a laugh of sheer
  amusement. He let his captors wait for him while he stared straight at her,
  sparing her no fragment of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I slew a man once to save thee, sahiba!" he mocked. "Why slink away? Have
  I ever been thy enemy?"</p>

  <p>Then he folded his arms and walked off between his guards, without even an
  acknowledgment of Alwa's or any other man's existence on the earth.</p>

  <p>Alwa spat as he wiped blood from his long Color. He imagined he was doing
  the necessary dirty work out of Miss McClean's sight; but, except hospital
  nurses, there are few women who can see dry blood removed from steel without
  a qualm; she had looked at Alwa to escape Jaimihr's gaze; now she looked at
  Jaimihr's back to avoid the sight of what Alwa was seeing fit to do. And with
  all the woman in her she pitied the prisoner, who had said no less than truth
  when he claimed to have killed a man for her.</p>

  <p>She knew that he would have killed a thousand men for her with equal
  generosity and equal disregard of what she thought was right, and she did not
  doubt that he would think himself both justified and worthy of renown for
  doing it. She could have begged his release that minute, had she thought for
  an instant that Alwa would consent, and but for Cunningham. She had grown
  aware of Cunningham's grey eyes, staring straight at her&mdash;summing her
  up&mdash;reading her. And she became conscious of the fact that she had met a
  man whose leave she would like to ask before deciding to act.</p>

  <p>The mental acknowledgment brought relief for a few seconds. She was tired.
  The woman in her went out to the man in Cunningham, and she welcomed a
  protector. Then the Scots blood raced to the assistance of the woman, and she
  bridled instantly. Who, then, was this chance-met jackanapes, that she should
  lean on him or look to him for guidance?</p>

  <p>The rebellion that had made her disobey her father back in Howrah City
  &mdash;the spirit that had kept her in Howrah City and had given Jaimihr back
  cool stare for stare&mdash;rallied her to resist&mdash;to ridicule &mdash;to
  rival Cunningham's pretensions. He saw her flush beneath his gaze, and turned
  away to where Mohammed Gunga watched from the parapet.</p>

  <p>The leaders of Jaimihr's cavalry were arguing. They could be seen gathered
  together out of rifle-shot but in full view of Alwa's rock, and from their
  gestures they seemed to be considering the feasibility of an attack.</p>

  <p>But it needed no warrior&mdash;it needed less even than ordinary
  intelligence&mdash;to know that as few as forty men could hold that fastness
  against two thousand. Eight hundred would have no chance against it. Even two
  thousand would need engineers, and ordnance, as well as plans.</p>

  <p>Presently half of the little army rode away, back toward Howrah City, and
  the other half proceeded to bivouac where they could watch the iron-shuttered
  entrance and cut off the little garrison from all communication or
  assistance.</p>

  <p>"We might as well resume our conference," suggested Alwa, with the courtly
  air of a man just arisen from a chair. No one who had not seen him ride would
  have dreamed that he was fresh from snatching a prisoner at the bottom of a
  neck-breaking defile. Cunningham nodded acquiescence and followed him,
  turning to stare again at Miss McClean before he strode away with long, even
  strides that had a reassuring effect on any one who watched him. She bridled
  again, and blushed. But she experienced the weird sensation of being read
  right through before Mohammed Gunga contrived adroitly to step into the line
  of view and so let Cunningham's attention fix itself on something else. The
  Risaldar had made up his mind that love was inopportune just then; and he was
  a man who left no stone unturned&mdash;no point unwatched&mdash;when he had
  sensed a danger. This might be danger and it might not be; so he watched.
  Cunningham was conscious of the sudden interruption of a train of thought,
  but he was not conscious of deliberate interference.</p>

  <p>"That very young man is an old man," said Duncan McClean, wiping his
  spectacles as he walked beside his daughter to the deep veranda where their
  chairs were side by side. "He is a grown man. He has come to man's estate.
  Look at the set of that pair of shoulders. Mark his strength!"</p>

  <p>"I expect any one of those Rajputs is physically stronger," answered
  Rosemary, in no mood to praise any one.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of the strength of character he expresses rather than of
  his actual muscles," said McClean.</p>

  <p>"Bismillah!"* Alwa was swearing behind the thick teak door that closed
  behind him and Cunningham and Mohammed Gunga. "We have made a good beginning!
  With the wolf in a trap, what has the goat to dread? Howrah may chuckle
  himself to sleep! And I&mdash;I, too, by the beard of God's prophet!
  &mdash;I, too, may laugh, for, with Jaimihr under lock and key, what need is
  there to ride to the aid of a Hindu Rajah? I am free again!"</p>

  <p>"Alwa-sahib!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham had fixed him with those calm grey eyes of his, and Mohammed
  Gunga sat down on the nearest bench contented. He could wait for what was
  coming now. He recognized the blossoming of the plant that he had nursed
  through its growth so long.</p>

  <p>"I listen," answered Alwa.</p>

  <p>"I represent the British Government. I am the only servant of the Company
  within reach. Do you realize that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"I have no orders which entitle me to deal with any crisis such as this.
  But, when my orders were given me, no such crisis was contemplated.
  Therefore, on behalf of the Company, I assume full authority until such time
  as some one senior to me turns up to relieve me. Is all that clear to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga went through considerable pantomime of being angry with a
  fly. He found it necessary to conceal emotion in some way or other. Alwa sat
  motionless and stared straight back at Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"I understand, sahib," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"You are talking to me, then, on that understanding?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly, huzoor."</p>

  <p>"You can raise two thousand men?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Say fifteen hundred?"</p>

  <p>"Surely fifteen hundred. Not a Color less."</p>

  <p>"All horsed and armed?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, bahadur. Of what use would be a rabble? I was speaking in terms
  of men able to fight, as one soldier to another."</p>

  <p>"Will you raise those men?"</p>

  <p>"Of a truth, I must, sahib!" Alwa laughed. "Jaimihr's thousands will be in
  no mind to lie leaderless and let Howrah ride rough-shod over them! They know
  his charity of old! They will be here to claim their Prince within a day or
  two, and without my fifteen hundred how would I stand? Surely, bahadur, I
  will raise my fifteen hundred."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now I will make you a proposal. On behalf of the Company I
  offer you and your men pay at the rate paid to all irregular cavalry on a war
  basis. In return, I demand your allegiance."</p>

  <p>"To whom, sahib? To you or to the Company?"</p>

  <p>"To the Company, of course."</p>

  <p>"Nay! Not I! For the son of Cunnigan-bahadur I would slit the throats of
  half Asia, and then of nine-tenths of the other half! But by the breath of
  God&mdash;by my spurs and this Color here&mdash;I have had enough of
  pledging! I swore allegiance to Howrah. Being nearly free of that pledge by
  Allah's sending, shall I plunge into another, like a frightened bird
  fluttering from snare to snare? Nay, nay, bahadur! For thyself, for thy
  father's sake, ask any Color. It is granted. But thy Company may stew in the
  grease of its own cartridges for ought I care!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham stood up and bowed very slightly&mdash;very stiffly&mdash; very
  punctiliously. Mohammed Gunga leaped to his feet, and came to attention with
  a military clatter. Alwa stared, inclining his head a trifle in recognition
  of the bow, but evidently taken by surprise.</p>

  <p>"Then, good-by, Alwa-sahib."</p>

  <p>Cunningham stretched out a hand.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you for your hospitality, and regret exceedingly
  that I cannot avail myself of it further, either for myself or for Mohammed
  Gunga or for Mr. and Miss McClean. As the Company's representative, they, of
  course, look to me for orders and protection, and I shall take them away at
  once. As things are, we can only be a source of embarrassment to you."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;sahib&mdash;huzoor&mdash;it is impossible. You have seen the
  cavalry below. How can you&mdash;how could you get away?"</p>

  <p>"Unless I am your prisoner I shall certainly leave this place at once. The
  only other condition on which I will stay here is that you pledge your
  allegiance to the Company and take my orders."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, this is&mdash;why&mdash;huzoor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alwa looked over to Mohammed Gunga and raised his eyebrows eloquently.</p>

  <p>"I obey him! I go with him!" growled Mohammed Gunga.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I would like time to think this over."</p>

  <p>"How much time? I thought you quick-witted when you made Jaimihr prisoner.
  Has that small success undermined your power of decision? I know my mind.
  Mohammed Gunga knows his, Alwa-sahib."</p>

  <p>"I ask an hour. There are many points I must consider. There is the
  prisoner for one thing."</p>

  <p>"You can hand him over to the custody of the first British column we can
  get in touch with, Alwa-sahib. That will relieve you of further
  responsibility to Howrah and will insure a fair trial of any issue there may
  be between yourself and Jaimihr."</p>

  <p>Alwa scowled. No Rajput likes the thought of litigation where affairs of
  Color are concerned. He felt he would prefer to keep Jaimihr prisoner for the
  present.</p>

  <p>"Also, sahib"&mdash;fresh facets of the situation kept appearing to him as
  he sparred for time&mdash;"with Jaimihr in a cage I can drive a bargain with
  his brother. While I keep him in the cage, Howrah must respect my wishes for
  fear lest otherwise I loose Jaimihr to be a thorn in his side anew. If I hand
  him to the British, Howrah will know that he is safe and altogether out of
  harm's way; then he will recall what he may choose to consider insolence of
  mine; and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;consider it!" said Cunningham, saluting him and making for
  the door, close followed by Mohammed Gunga. The two went out and left Alwa to
  stride up and down alone&mdash;to wrestle between desire and
  circumspection&mdash;to weigh uncomfortable fact with fact&mdash;and to curse
  his wits that could not settle on the wisest and most creditable course. They
  turned into another chamber of the tunneled rock, and there until long after
  the hour of law allowed to Alwa they discussed the situation too.</p>

  <p>"The point was well taken, sahib," said Mohammed Gunga, "but he should
  have been handled rather less abruptly."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Rather less abruptly, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Well&mdash;if his mind isn't clear as to which side he'll fight on, I
  don't want him, and that's all!" said Cunningham. And Mohammed Gunga bitted
  his impatience fiercely, praying the one God he believed in to touch the
  right scale of the two. Later, Cunningham strode out to pace the courtyard in
  the dark, and the Rajput followed him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER 27</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">The trapped wolf bared his fangs and swore,<br>
  "But set me this time free,<br>
  And I will hunt thee never more!<br>
  By ear and eye and jungle law,<br>
  I'll starve&mdash;I'll faint&mdash;I'll die before<br>
  I bury tooth in thee!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHILE Alwa raged alone, and while Mohammed Gunga talked to
  Cunningham in a rock-room near at hand, Rosemary McClean saw fit to take a
  hand in history. It was not her temperament to sit quite idle while others
  shaped her destiny; nor was she given to mere brooding over wrongs. When a
  wrong was being done that she could alter or alleviate it was her way to
  tackle it at once without asking for permission or advice.</p>

  <p>From where her chair was placed under the long veranda she could see the
  passage in the rock that led to Jaimihr's cell. She saw his captors take him
  up the passage; she heard the door clang shut on him, and she saw the men
  come back again. She heard them laugh, too, and she overheard a few words of
  a jest that seemed the reason for the laughter.</p>

  <p>In Rajputana, as in other portions of the East, men laugh with meaning as
  a rule, and seldom from mere amusement. Included in the laugh there usually
  lies more than a hint of threat, or hate, or cruelty. And, in partial
  confirmation of the jest she unintentionally overheard, she saw no servant go
  to the chuckling spring to fill a water-jar. She recalled that Jaimihr only
  sipped as much as he could dip up in the hollow of his hand, and that
  physical exertion and suffering of the sort that he had undergone produces
  prodigious thirst in that hot, dry atmosphere.</p>

  <p>She waited until dark for Cunningham, growing momentarily more restless.
  She recalled that she was a guest of Alwa's, and as such not free to
  interfere with his arrangements or to suggest insinuations anent his
  treatment of prisoners. She recalled the pride of all Rajputs, and its
  accompanying corollary of insolence when offended. There would come no good
  &mdash;she knew&mdash;from asking anybody whether Jaimihr was allowed to
  drink or not.</p>

  <p>Cunningham, with that middle-aged air of authority laid over the fire and
  ability of youth, would be able, no doubt, to enforce his wishes in the
  matter after finding out the truth about it. But Cunningham did not come; and
  she remembered from a short experience of her own what thirst was.</p>

  <p>The men-at-arms were all on the ramparts now, watching the leaderless
  cavalry on the plain. They had even left the cell door unguarded, for it was
  held shut by a heavy beam that could not be reached from the inside; and they
  were all too few, even all of them together, to hold that rock against eight
  hundred. It was characteristic, though, and Eastern of the East, that they
  should omit to padlock the big beam. It pivoted at its center on a big bronze
  pin, and even a child could move it from the outside; it was only from the
  inside that it was uncontrollable. From inside one could have jerked at the
  door for a week and the big beam would have lain still and efficient in its
  niche in the rock-wall; but a little pressure underneath one end would send
  it swinging in an arc until it hung bolt upright. Then the same child who had
  pushed it up could have swung the teak door wide.</p>

  <p>Rosemary, growing momentarily thirstier herself as she thought of the
  probable torture of the prisoner, walked down to the spring and filled a
  dipper, as she had done half a dozen times a day since she first arrived. She
  had carried almost all her own and her father's water, for Joanna was
  generally sleeping somewhere out of view, and no other body-servant had been
  provided for her. There was a fairly big brass pitcher by the spring. She
  filled it. Nobody noticed her.</p>

  <p>Then she recalled that nobody would notice her if she were to carry the
  brass pitcher in the direction of her room, for she had done that often. She
  picked it up, and she reached the end of the veranda with it without having
  called attention to herself. She set it down then to make quite sure that she
  was unobserved.</p>

  <p>But some movement of the cavalry on the plain below was keeping the eyes
  of the garrison employed. Although a solitary lantern shone full on her, she
  reached the passage leading to the prisoner's cell unseen; and she walked on
  down it, making no attempt to hide or hurry, remembering that she was acting
  out of mercy and had no need to be ashamed. If she were to be discovered,
  then she would be, and that was all about it, except that she would probably
  be able to appeal to Cunningham to save her from unpleasant consequences. In
  any case, she reasoned, she would have done good. She was quite ready to get
  herself and her own in trouble if by doing it she could insure that a
  prisoner had water.</p>

  <p>But she was not seen. And no one saw her set the jar down by the door. No
  one except the prisoner inside heard her knock.</p>

  <p>"Have you water, Jaimihr-sahib?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>The East has a hundred florid epithets for one used in the West; and in a
  land where water is as scarce as gold and far more precious the mention of
  water to a thirsty man calls forth a flood of thought such as only music or
  perhaps religion can produce in luckier climes. Jaimihr waxed eloquent; more
  eloquent than even water might have made him had another&mdash;had even
  another woman&mdash;brought it. He recognized her voice, and said things to
  her that roused all the anger that she knew. She had not come to be made love
  to.</p>

  <p>She thought, though, of his thirst. She remembered that within an hour or
  two he might be raving for another reason and with other words. The big beam
  lifted on her hands with barely more effort than was needed to lift up the
  water-jar; the door opened a little way, and she tried, while she passed the
  water in, to peer through the darkness at the prisoner. But there were no
  windows to that cell, and such dim light as there was came from behind
  her.</p>

  <p>"They have bound me, sahiba, in this corner," groaned Jaimihr. "I cannot
  reach it. Take it away again! The certainty that it is there and out of reach
  is too great torture!"</p>

  <p>So she slipped in through the door, leaving it open a little way&mdash;
  both her hands busy with the brass pitcher and both eyes straining their
  utmost through the gloom&mdash;advancing step by step through moldy straw
  that might conceal a thousand horrors.</p>

  <p>"You wonder, perhaps, why I do not escape!" said a voice. And then she
  heard the cell door close again gently.</p>

  <p>Now she could see Jaimihr, for he stood with his back against the door,
  and his head was between her and the little six-inch grating that was all the
  ventilation or light a prisoner in that place was allowed.</p>

  <p>"So you lied to me, even when I brought you water?" she answered. She was
  not afraid. She had nerve enough left to pity him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I see that you did not lie. I am still thirsty, sahiba."</p>

  <p>He held out both hands, and she could see them dimly. There were no chains
  on them, and he was not bound in any way. She gave him the jar.</p>

  <p>"Let me pass out again before you drink," she ordered. "It is not known
  that I am in here, and I would not have it known."</p>

  <p>She could have bitten out her tongue with mortification a moment
  afterwards for letting any such admission escape her. She heard him chuckle
  as he drank&mdash;he choked from chuckling, and set the jar down to cough.
  Then, when he had recovered breath again, he answered almost
  patronizingly.</p>

  <p>"Which would be least pleased with you, sahiba? The Rangars, or thy
  father, or the other Englishman? But never mind, sahiba, we are friends. I
  have proved that we are friends. Never have I taken water from the hands of
  any man or any woman not of my own caste. I would have died sooner. It was
  only thou, sahiba, who could make me set aside my caste."</p>

  <p>"Let me pass!"</p>

  <p>She certainly was frightened now. It dawned on her, as it had at once on
  him, that at the least commotion on his part or on hers a dozen Rangars would
  be likely to come running. And just as he had done, she wondered what
  explanation she would give in that case, and who would be likely to believe
  it. To have been caught going to the cell would have been one thing; to be
  caught in it would be another. He divined her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, sahiba. Thou and I are friends."</p>

  <p>She did not answer, for words would not come. Besides, she was beginning
  to realize that words would be of little help to her. A woman who will tell
  nothing but the truth under any circumstances and will surely keep her
  promises is at a disadvantage when conversing with a man who surely will not
  tell the truth if he can help it and who regards his given word with almost
  equal disrespect.</p>

  <p>"I have no fear, sahiba. I am not afraid to open this door wide and make a
  bid for liberty. It would not be wise, that is all, and thou&mdash;and I must
  deal in wisdom."</p>

  <p>His words came through the dark very evenly&mdash;spaced evenly&mdash; as
  though he weighed each one of them before he voiced it. She gathered the
  impression that he was thinking for his very life. She felt unable to think
  for her own. She felt impelled to listen&mdash;incredulous, helpless,
  frightened,&mdash;not a little ashamed. She was thinking more of the awful
  things those Moslem gentlemen would say about her should they come and
  discover her in Jaimihr's cell.</p>

  <p>"Listen, sahiba! From end to end of India thy people are either dead, or
  else face to face with death. There is no escape anywhere for any man or
  woman&mdash;no hope, no chance. The British doom is sealed. So is the doom of
  every man who dared to side with them."</p>

  <p>She shuddered. But she had to listen.</p>

  <p>"There will be an army here within a day or two. My men&mdash;and I number
  them by thousands&mdash;will come and rip these Rangars from their roost.
  Those that are not crucified will be thrown down from the summit, and there
  shall be a Hindu shrine where they have worshipped their false god. Then,
  sahiba, if thou art here&mdash;perhaps&mdash;there might&mdash; yet&mdash;be
  a way-perhaps, yes?&mdash;a way, still, to escape me?"</p>

  <p>She was trembling. She could not help beginning to believe him. Whatever
  might be true of what he said was certainly not comforting.</p>

  <p>"But, while my army comes in search of me, my brother Howrah will be
  making merry with my palace and belongings. There will be devastation and
  other things in my army's rear for which there is no need and for which I
  have no stomach. I detest the thought of them, sahiba. Therefore, sahiba, I
  would drive a bargain. Notice, sahiba, I say not one word of love, though
  love such as mine is has seldom been offered to a woman. I say no word of
  love&mdash;as yet. I say, help me to escape by night, when I may make my way
  unseen back to my men: enable me to reach Howrah before my dear brother is
  aware of my trouble and before his men can start plundering, and name your
  own terms, sahiba!"</p>

  <p>Name her own terms&mdash;name her own terms&mdash;name her own terms! The
  words dinned through her head and she could grasp no other thought. She was
  alone in a cell with Jaimihr, and she could get out of it if she would name
  her terms! She must name them&mdash;she must hurry&mdash;what were they? What
  were her terms? She could not think.</p>

  <p>"Understand, sahiba. Certain things are sure. It is sure my men will come.
  It is sure that every Rangar on this rock will meet a very far from pleasant
  death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He grinned, and though she could not see him grin, she knew that he was
  doing it. She knew that he was even then imagining a hundred horrors that the
  Rangars would endure before they died. She might name her terms. She could
  save them.</p>

  <p>"No!" she hissed hoarsely. "No! They are my terms! I name them! You must
  spare them&mdash;spare the Rangars&mdash;spare every man on this hill, and
  theirs, and all they have!"</p>

  <p>"Truly are those thy terms, sahiba?"</p>

  <p>"Truly! What others can I ask?"</p>

  <p>"They are granted, sahiba!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank God!"</p>

  <p>She knew that he was speaking at least half the truth. She knew his power.
  She knew enough of Howrah City's politics to be convinced that he would not
  be left at the mercy of a little band of Rangars. She knew that there were
  not enough Rangars on the whole countryside to oppose the army that would
  surely come to his rescue. And whether he were dead or living, she knew well
  enough that the vengeance would be wreaked on every living body on the hill.
  Alwa might feel confident, not she. She trembled now with joy at the thought
  that she&mdash;she the most helpless and useless of all of them&mdash; might
  save the lives of all.</p>

  <p>But then another phase of the problem daunted her. She might help Jaimihr
  go. He might escape unobserved with her aid. But then? What then? What would
  the Rangars do to her? Had she sufficient courage to face that? It was not
  fear now that swept over her so much as wonder at herself. Jaimihr detected
  something different in her mental attitude, and, since almost any change
  means weakness to the Oriental mind, he was quick to try to take advantage of
  it. He guessed right at the first attempt.</p>

  <p>"And what wilt thou do here, sahiba? When I am gone, and there is none
  here to love thee&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" she commanded. "Peace! I have suffered enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt suffer more, should the Rangars learn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is my business! Let me pass! I have bargained, and I will try to
  fulfill my part!"</p>

  <p>She stepped toward the door, but he held out both his arms and she saw
  them. She had no intention of being embraced by him, whatever their
  conspiracy.</p>

  <p>"Stand back!" she ordered.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, sahiba! Listen! Escape with me! These Rangars will not believe
  without proof that thou hast saved their lives by bargaining. They will show
  thee short shrift indeed when my loss is discovered. Come now and I will make
  thee Maharani in a week!"</p>

  <p>"I would be as safe with one as with the other!" she laughed, something of
  calm reflection returning to her. "And what proof have I in any case that you
  will keep your word, Jaimihr-sahib. I will keep mine&mdash;but who will keep
  yours, that has been so often broken?"</p>

  <p>"Sahiba&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Show me a proof!"</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;now&mdash;in this place?"</p>

  <p>"Convince me, if you can! I will give myself willingly if I can save my
  father by it and these Rangars and Mr. Cunningham; but your bare word,
  Jaimihr-sahib, is worth that!"</p>

  <p>She snapped her fingers, and he swore beneath his breath. Then he
  remembered his ambition and his present need, and words raced to his aid
  &mdash;words, plans, oaths, treachery, and all the hundred and one tricks
  that he was used to. He found himself consciously selecting from a dozen
  different plans for tricking her.</p>

  <p>"Sahiba"&mdash;he spoke slowly and convincingly. In the gloom she could
  see his brown eyes levelled straight at hers, and she saw they did not flinch
  &mdash;"there is none who knows better than thou knowest how my brother and I
  stand to each other." She shuddered at the reiterated second person singular,
  but he either did not notice it or else affected not to. "Thou knowest that
  there is no love between him and me, and that I would have his throne. The
  British could set me on that throne unless they were first overwhelmed. Wert
  thou my legal wife, and were I to aid the British in this minute of their
  need, they would not be overwhelmed, and afterwards they would surely set me
  on the throne. Therefore I pledge my word to lead my men to the Company's
  aid, provided that these Rangars ride to my aid. My brother plans to overcome
  me first, and then take arms against the British. If the Rangars come to help
  me I will ride with them to the Company's aid afterwards. That is my given
  word!"</p>

  <p>"Then the throne of Howrah is your price, Jaimihr-sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Thou art the price and the prize, sahiba! For thee I would win the
  throne!"</p>

  <p>She actually laughed, and he winced palpably. There was no doubt that he
  loved her after a manner of his own, and her contempt hurt him.</p>

  <p>"I have said all I can say," he told her. "I have promised all I can
  promise. What more is there to say or offer? If I stay here, I swear on the
  Color of a Rajput and a prince of royal blood, that every living man and
  woman on this rock, excepting thee only, shall be dead within a week. But if
  I escape by thy aid, and if, at thy instance, these Rangars and their friends
  ride to my help against my brother, then I will throw all my weight&mdash;
  men and influence&mdash;in the scale on the British side."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"And thou shalt be Maharani!"</p>

  <p>"Never!"</p>

  <p>"But in case that the British should be beaten before we reach them, then,
  sahiba! Then in case of thy need!"</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr-sahib, I will help you to escape tonight on the terms that you
  have named&mdash;that you spare these Rangars and every living body on this
  hill. Then I will do my utmost to persuade the Rangars to ride to your
  assistance on your condition, that you lead your men to help the British
  afterwards. And if my action in helping you escape should make the Rangars
  turn against me and my immediate friends, I shall claim your protection. Is
  that agreed?"</p>

  <p>"Sahiba&mdash;absolutely!"</p>

  <p>"Then let me pass!"</p>

  <p>Reluctantly he stood aside. She slipped out and let the bar down
  unobserved. But she had not recovered all her self-possession when she
  reached the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Evening, Miss McClean," said Cunningham; and she all but fainted, she was
  strained to such a pitch of nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Where have you come from, Miss McClean?" asked Cunningham. And she told
  him. She was not quite so stiff-chinned as she had been.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing there?"</p>

  <p>She told him that, too.</p>

  <p>"Where is your father?"</p>

  <p>"In his chair on the veranda, Mr. Cunningham. There, in that deep
  shadow."</p>

  <p>"Come to him, please. I want your explanation in his presence."</p>

  <p>She followed as obediently as a child. The sense of guilt&mdash;of
  fright&mdash;of impending judgment left her as she walked with him, and gave
  place to a glow of comfort that here should be a man on whom to lean. She did
  not fight the new sensation, for she was growing strangely weary of the other
  one. By the time that they had reached her father, and he was standing before
  Cunningham wiping his spectacles in his nervous way, she had completely
  recovered her self-possession, although it is likely she would not have given
  any reason for it to herself.</p>

  <p>Cunningham held a lantern up, so that he could study both their faces. His
  own face muscles were set rigidly, and he questioned them as he might have
  cross-examined a spy caught in the act. His voice was uncompromising, and his
  manner stern.</p>

  <p>"Do you both understand how serious this situation is?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We naturally do," said Duncan McClean. The Scotsman was beginning to
  betray an inclination to bridle under the youngster's attitude, and to show
  an equally pronounced desire not to appear to. "More so, probably, than
  anybody else!"</p>

  <p>"Are you positive&mdash;both of you&mdash;you too, Mr. McClean&mdash; that
  all that talk about treasure in Howrah City is not mere imagination and
  legend?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely positive!" They both answered him at once, both looking in his
  eyes across the unsteady rays of the flickering, smoky lamp. "The amount has
  been, of course, much exaggerated," said McClean, "but I have no doubt there
  is enough there to pay the taxes of all India for a year or two."</p>

  <p>"Then I have another question to ask. Do you both&mdash;or do you not
  &mdash;place yourselves at the service of the Company? It is likely to be
  dangerous&mdash;a desperate service. But the Company needs all that it can
  muster."</p>

  <p>"Of course we do!" Again both answered in one breath.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand that that involves taking my orders?"</p>

  <p>This time Duncan McClean did the answering, and now it was he who seized
  the lamp. He held it high, and scanned Cunningham's face as though he were
  reading a finely drawn map.</p>

  <p>"We are prepared&mdash;I speak for my daughter as well as for myself
  &mdash;to obey any orders that you have a right to give, young man."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me," answered Cunningham. "I am offering you the
  opportunity to serve the Company. As the Company's senior officer in the
  neighborhood, I am responsible to the Company for such orders as I see fit to
  give. I could not have my orders questioned. I don't mind telling you that
  I'm asking you, as British subjects, no more than I intend to ask Alwa and
  his Rangars. You can do as much as they are going to be asked to do. You
  can't do more. But you can do less if you like. You are being given the
  opportunity now to offer your services unconditionally&mdash;that is to say
  in the only manner in which I will accept them. Otherwise you will remain
  non-combatants, and I shall take such measures for your safety as I see fit.
  Time presses. Your answer, please!"</p>

  <p>"I will obey your legal orders," said McClean, still making full use of
  the lantern.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to admit the qualification," answered Cunningham promptly.
  "Either you will obey, or you will not. You are asked to say which, that is
  all."</p>

  <p>"I will obey," said Rosemary McClean quietly. She said it through straight
  lips and in a level voice that carried more assurance than a string of
  loud-voiced oaths.</p>

  <p>"And you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Since my daughter sees fit to&mdash;ah&mdash;capitulate, I have no
  option."</p>

  <p>"Be good enough to be explicit."</p>

  <p>"I agree to obey your orders."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." He seemed to have finished with McClean. He turned away from
  him and faced Rosemary, not troubling to examine her face closely as he had
  done her father's, but seeming none the less to give her full attention. "I
  understood you to say that you promised to help Prince Jaimihr to escape from
  his cell tonight?"</p>

  <p>"WHAT?"</p>

  <p>Duncan McClean could not have acted such amazement. Cunningham desired no
  further evidence that he had not been accessory to his daughter's visit to
  the prisoner. He silenced him with a gesture. And now his eyes seemed for the
  time being to have finished with both of them; in spite of the darkness they
  both knew that he had resumed the far-away look that seemed able to see
  things finished.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Rosemary. "I promised. I had to."</p>

  <p>Her father gasped. But Cunningham appeared to follow an unbroken chain of
  thought, and she listened.</p>

  <p>"Well. You will both realize readily that we, as British subjects, are
  ranged all together on one side opposed to treachery, as represented by the
  large majority of the natives. That means that our first consideration must
  be to keep our given word. What we say,&mdash;what we promise&mdash;what we
  boast&mdash;must tally with what we undertake, and at the least try, to do.
  You must keep your word to Jaimihr, Miss McClean!"</p>

  <p>She stared back at Cunningham through wide, unfrightened eyes. Whatever
  this man said to her, she seemed unable to feel fear while she had his
  attention. Her father seemed utterly bewildered, and she held his hand to
  reassure him.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, we cannot be guilty of a breach of faith to our friend
  Alwa here. I must have a little talk with him before I issue any orders.
  Please wait here and&mdash;ah&mdash;do nothing while I talk to Alwa. Did
  you&mdash;ah&mdash;did you agree to marry Jaimihr, should he make you
  Maharani?"</p>

  <p>"No! I told him I would rather die!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you. That makes matters easier. Now tell me over again from the
  beginning what you know about the political situation in Howrah. Quickly,
  please. Consider yourself a scout reporting to his officer."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Cunningham heard a commotion by the parapet, and stalked
  off to find Alwa, close followed by Mohammed Gunga. The grim old Rajput was
  grinning in his beard as he recognized the set of what might have been
  Cunningham the elder's shoulders.</p>

  <p class="poem">Ye may go and lay your praise<br>
  At a shrine of other days<br>
  By the tomb of him who gat, and her who bore me;<br>
  My plan is good&mdash;my way&mdash;<br>
  The sons of kings obey&mdash;<br>
  But, I'm reaping where another sowed before me.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JAIDEV SINGH was a five-K man, with the hair, breeches,
  bangle, comb, and dagger that betoken him who has sworn the vow of Khanda ka
  Pahul.* Every item of the Sikh ritual was devised with no other motive than
  to preserve the fighting character of the organization. The very name Singh
  means lion. The Sikh's long hair with the iron ring hidden underneath is
  meant as a protection against sword-cuts. And because their faith is rather
  spiritual than fanatical&mdash;based rather on the cause of things than on
  material effect&mdash;men of that creed take first rank among fighting
  men.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Khanda ka Pahul</i> (baptism by the sword)&mdash; a
  Sikh initiation rite which must be performed in the presence of at least five
  initiates who are learned in the faith. During the ceremony a sweetmeat is
  stirred up in water with a double-edged sword while the candidate repeats the
  articles of faith proclaimed by the officiant. Some of the water is sprinkled
  on him five times, and he drinks of it five times from the palms of his
  hands; he then pronounces the Sikh watchword "Khalsa of God, Victory to God!"
  and promises adherence to the new obligations he has contracted. He must from
  that date wear the five K's and add the word singh to his name. The five K's
  are 1) the "kes" or uncut hair of the whole body, 2) the "kachh" or short
  drawers ending above the knee, 3) the "kara or iron bangle, 4) the "khanda"
  or small steel dagger, 5) the "khanga" or comb. The five K's and the other
  esoteric observances of the Sikhs mostly had a utilitarian purpose. When
  fighting was a part of the Sikh's duty, long hair and iron rings concealed in
  it protected his head from sword cuts. Excerpted from the article on <a href=

  <p>Jaidev Singh arrived soon after the moon had risen. The notice of his
  coming was the steady drumming footfall of his horse, that slowed
  occasionally, and responded to the spur again immediately.</p>

  <p>Close to the big iron gate below Alwa's aerie there were some of Jaimihr's
  cavalry nosing about among the trampled gardens for the dead and wounded they
  had left there earlier in the afternoon. They ceased searching, and formed up
  to intercept whoever it might be who rode in such a hurry. Above them, on the
  overhanging ramparts, there was quick discussion, and one man left his post
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"A horseman from the West!" he announced, breaking in on Alwa's privacy
  without ceremony.</p>

  <p>"One?"</p>

  <p>"One only."</p>

  <p>"For us or them?"</p>

  <p>"I know not, sahib."</p>

  <p>Alwa&mdash;glad enough of the relief from puzzling his brain&mdash;ran to
  the rampart and looked long at the moving dot that was coming noisily toward
  his fastness but that gave no sign of its identity or purpose.</p>

  <p>"Whoever he is can see them," he vowed. "The moon shines full on them.
  Either he is a man of theirs or else a madman!"</p>

  <p>He watched for five more minutes without speaking. Cunningham and Mohammed
  Gunga, coming out at last in search of him, saw the strained figures of the
  garrison peering downward through the yellow moon rays, and took stand on
  either side of him to gaze, too, in spellbound silence.</p>

  <p>"If he is their man," said Alwa presently, "he will turn now. He will
  change direction and ride for the main body of them yonder. He can see them
  now easily. Yes. See. He is their man!"</p>

  <p>On a horse that staggered gamely&mdash;silhouetted and beginning to show
  detail in the yellow light&mdash;a man whose nationality or caste could not
  be recognized rode straight for the bivouacking cavalry, and a swarm of them
  rode out at a walk to meet him.</p>

  <p>The tension on the ramparts was relaxed then. As a friend in direst need
  the man would have been welcome. As one of the enemy, with a message for
  them, however urgent, he was no more than an incident.</p>

  <p>"By Allah!" roared Alwa suddenly. "That is no man of theirs! Quick! To the
  wheels! Man the wheels! Eight men to horse!"</p>

  <p>He took the cord himself, to send the necessary signal down into the belly
  of the rock. From his stables, where men and horses seemed to stand ready day
  and night, ten troopers cantered out, scattering the sparks, the whites of
  their horses' eyes and their drawn blades gleaming; without another order
  they dipped down the breakneck gorge, to wait below. The oncoming rider had
  wheeled again; he had caught the cavalry, that rode to meet him, unawares.
  They were not yet certain whether he was friend or foe, and they were milling
  in a bunch, shouting orders to one another. He, spurring like a maniac, was
  heading straight for the searching party, who had formed to cut him off. He
  seemed to have thrown his heart over Alwa's iron gate and to be thundering on
  hell's own horse in quest of it again.</p>

  <p>Alwa's eight slipped down the defile as quickly as phantoms would have
  dared in that tricky moon-light. One of them shouted from below. Alwa jerked
  the cord, and the great gate yawned, well-oiled and silent. The oncomer raced
  straight for the middle of the intercepting line of horsemen; they&mdash;
  knowing him by this time for no friend&mdash;started to meet him; and Alwa's
  eight, unannounced and unexpected, whirled into them from the rear.</p>

  <p>In a second there was shouting, blind confusion&mdash;eddying and trying
  to reform. The lone galloper pulled clear, and Alwa's men drove his
  opponents, crupper over headstall, into a body of the main contingent who had
  raced up in pursuit. They rammed the charge home, and reeled through both
  detachments&mdash;then wheeled at the spur and cut their way back again,
  catching up their man at the moment that his horse dropped dead beneath him.
  They seized him beneath the arms and bore him through as the great gate
  dropped and cut his horse in halves. Then one man took the galloper up behind
  his saddle, and bore him up the hill unquestioned until he could dismount in
  front of Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" demanded the owner of the rock, recognizing a warrior by
  his trademarks, but in no way moderating the natural gruffness of his voice.
  Alwa considered that his inviolable hospitality should be too well known and
  understood to call for any explanation or expression; he would have
  considered it an insult to the Sikh's intelligence to have mouthed a welcome;
  he let it go for granted.</p>

  <p>"Jaidev Singh&mdash;galloper to Byng-bahadur. I bring a letter for the
  Risaldar Mohammed Gunga, or for Cunnigan-sahib, whichever I can find
  first."</p>

  <p>"They are both here."</p>

  <p>"Then my letter is for both of them."</p>

  <p>Cunningham and Mohammed Gunga each took one step forward, and the Sikh
  gave Cunningham a tiny, folded piece of paper, stuck together along one edge
  with native gum. He tore it open, read it in the light of a trooper's
  lantern, and then read it again aloud to Mohammed Gunga, pitching his voice
  high enough for Alwa to listen if he chose.</p>

  <p>"What are you two men doing?" ran the note. "The very worst has happened.
  We all need men immediately, and I particularly need them. One hundred
  troopers now would be better than a thousand men a month from now. Hurry, and
  send word by bearer. S. F. BYNG."</p>

  <p>"How soon can you start back?" asked Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"The minute I am provided with a horse, sahib."</p>

  <p>Cunningham turned to Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Will you be kind enough to feed him, Alwa-sahib?"</p>

  <p>Alwa resented the imputation against his hospitality instantly.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I was waiting for his money in advance!" he laughed. "Food waits,
  thou. Thou art a Sikh&mdash;thou eatest meat&mdash;meat, then, is ready."</p>

  <p>The Sikh, or at least the true Sikh, is not hampered by a list of caste
  restrictions. All of his precepts, taken singly or collectively, bid him be
  nothing but a man, and no law forbids him accept the hospitality of soldiers
  of another creed. So Jaidev Singh walked off to feed on curried beef that
  would have made a Hindu know himself for damned. Cunningham then turned on
  Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Now is the time, Alwa-sahib," he said in a level voice. "My party can
  start off with this man and our answer, if your answer is no. If your answer
  is yes, then the Sikh can bear that answer for us."</p>

  <p>"You would none of you ride half a mile alive!" laughed Alwa.</p>

  <p>"I none the less require an answer, Alwa-sahib."</p>

  <p>Alwa stared hard at him. That was the kind of talk that went straight to
  his soldier heart. He loved a man who held to his point in the teeth of odds.
  The odds, it seemed to him, were awfully against Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"So was thy father," he said slowly. "My cousin said thou wast thy
  father's son!"</p>

  <p>"I require an answer by the time that the Sikh has finished eating," said
  Cunningham. "Otherwise, Alwa-sahib, I shall regret the necessity of foregoing
  further hospitality at your hands."</p>

  <p>"Bismillah! Am I servant here or master?" wondered Alwa, loud enough for
  all his men to hear. Then he thought better of his dignity. "Sahib," he
  insisted, "I will not talk here before my men. We will have another
  conference."</p>

  <p>"I concede you ten minutes," said Cunningham, preparing to follow him, and
  followed in turn by Mohammed Gunga.</p>

  <p>"Now, swore the Risaldar into his beard, we shall see the reaching of
  decisions! Now, by the curse of the sack of Chitor we shall know who is on
  whose side, or I am no Rangar, nor the son of one!"</p>

  <p>"I have a suggestion to make, sahib," smiled Alwa, closing the door of the
  rock-hewn chamber on the three of them.</p>

  <p>"Hear mine first!" said Cunningham, with a hint of iron in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Ay! Hear his first! Hear Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!" echoed Mohammed Gunga.
  "Let us hear a plan worth hearing!" And Alwa looked into a pair of steady
  eyes that seemed to see through him&mdash;past him&mdash;to the finished work
  beyond.</p>

  <p>"Speak, sahib."</p>

  <p>"You are pledged to uphold Howrah on his throne?"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Then, I guarantee you shall! You shall not go to the Company's aid until
  you have satisfactory guarantees that your homes and friends will not be
  assailed behind your backs."</p>

  <p>"Guarantees to whose satisfaction, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Yours!"</p>

  <p>"But with whom am I dealing?" Alwa seemed actually staggered. "Who makes
  these promises? The Company?"</p>

  <p>"I give you my solemn word of honor on it!"</p>

  <p>"It is at least a man who speaks!" swore Alwa.</p>

  <p>"It is the son of Cunnigan-bahadur!" growled Mohammed Gunga, standing chin
  erect. He seemed in no doubt now of the outcome. He was merely waiting for it
  with soldierly and ill-concealed impatience.</p>

  <p>"But, sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Alwa-sahib, we have no time for argument. It is yes or no. I must send an
  answer back by that Sikh. He must&mdash;he shall take my answer! Either you
  are loyal to our cause or you are not. Are you?"</p>

  <p>"By the breath of God, sahib, I am thinking you leave me little
  choice!"</p>

  <p>"I still await an answer. I am calling on you for as many men as you can
  raise, and I have made you specific promises. Choose, Alwa-sahib. Yes or
  no?"</p>

  <p>"The answer is yes&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I understand that you undertake to obey my orders without question
  until such time as a senior to me can be found to take over the command."</p>

  <p>"That is contingent on the agreement," hesitated Alwa.</p>

  <p>"I would like your word of honor, Alwa-sahib."</p>

  <p>"I pledge that not lightly, sahib."</p>

  <p>"For that very good reason I am asking for it. I shall know how far to
  trust when I have your word of honor!"</p>

  <p>"I knew thy father! Thou art his son! I trusted him for good reason and
  with good result. I will trust thee also. My word is given, on thy
  conditions, sahib. First, the guarantees before we ride to the British
  aid!"</p>

  <p>And you obey my orders?</p>

  <p>"Yes. My word is given, sahib. The oath of a Rajput, of a Rangar, of a
  soldier, of a zamindar of the House of Kachwaha; the oath of a man to a man,
  sahib; the promise of thy father's friend to thy father's son! Bahadur"
  &mdash;he drew himself to his full height, and clicked his spurs together
  &mdash;"I am thy servant!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham saluted. All three men looked in each other's eyes and a bond
  was sealed between them that nothing less than death could sever.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Cunningham quite quietly. "And now, Alwa-sahib"&mdash;
  (he could strike while the iron glowed, could this son of Cunnigan!)&mdash;
  "for the plan. There is little time. Jaimihr must escape tonight!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, did I understand aright?"</p>

  <p>Alwa's jaw had actually dropped. He looked as though he had been struck.
  Mohammed Gunga slammed his saber ferule on the stone floor. He too, was hard
  put to it to believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr is the key to the position. He is nothing but a nuisance where he
  is. Outside he can be made to help us."</p>

  <p>"Am I dreaming, or art thou, sahib?" Alwa stood with fists clinched on his
  hips and his legs apart&mdash;incredulous. "Jaimihr to go free? Why that
  Hindu pig is the source of all the trouble in the district!"</p>

  <p>"We are neither of us dreaming, Alwa-sahib. Jaimihr is the dreamer. Let
  him dream in Howrah City for a day or two, while we get ready. Let him lead
  his men away and leave the road clear for us to pass in and out."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know. He is your prisoner, and your honor is involved, and all that
  kind of thing. I'm offering you, to set off against that, a much greater
  honor than you ever experienced in your whole life yet, and I've put my order
  in the shape of a request for the sake of courtesy. I ask you again to let me
  arrange for Jaimihr to escape."</p>

  <p>"I was mad. But it seems that I have passed my word!" swore Alwa.</p>

  <p>"I give you your word back again, then."</p>

  <p>"Bismillah! I refuse it!"</p>

  <p>"Then I do with Jaimihr as I like?"</p>

  <p>"I gave my word, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. You'll be glad before we've finished. Now I've left the raising
  of as many men as can be raised to you, Alwa-sahib. You will remember that
  you gave your promise on that count, too."</p>

  <p>"I will keep that promise, too, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Good. You shall have a road clear by tonight."</p>

  <p>He stepped back a pace, awaited their salute with the calm, assured
  authority of a general of division, returned it, and left the two Rajputs
  looking in each other's eyes.</p>

  <p>"What is this, cousin, that thou hast brought me to?" demanded Alwa.</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga laughed and shook his saber, letting it rattle in its
  scabbard.</p>

  <p>"This? This is the edge of the war that I promised thee a year ago! This
  is the service of which I spoke! This is the beginning of the blood-spilling!
  I have brought thee the leader of whom we spoke in Howrah City. Dost
  remember, cousin? I recall thy words!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I recall them. I said then that I would follow a second Cunnigan,
  could such be found."</p>

  <p>"And this is he!" vowed Mohammed Gunga.</p>

  <p>"Ho! But we Rangars have a leader! A man of men!"</p>

  <p>"But this plan of his? This loosing of the trapped wolf&mdash;what of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I neither know nor care, as yet! I trust him! I am his man, as I was his
  father's! I have seen him; I have heard him; I have felt his pulse in the
  welter of the wrath of God. I know him. Whatever plans he makes, whatever way
  he leads, those are my plans, my road! I serve the son of Cunnigan!"</p>

  <p class="poem">Did he swear with his leg in a spring-steel trap<br>
  And a tongue dry-cracked from thirst?<br>
  Or down on his knees at his lady's lap<br>
  With the lady's lips to his own, mayhap,<br>
  And his head and his heart aburst?<br>
  Nay! I have listened to vows enough<br>
  And never the oath could bind<br>
  Save that, that a free man chose to take<br>
  For his own good reputation's sake!<br>
  They're qualified&mdash;they're tricks&mdash;they break&mdash;<br>
  They're words, the other kind!</p><br>

  <p class="first">MOHAMMED GUNGA had long ago determined to "go it blind" on
  Cunningham. He had known him longest and had the greatest right. Rosemary
  McClean, who knew him almost least of all, so far as length of time was
  concerned, was ready now to trust him as far as the Risaldar dared go; her
  limit was as long and as devil-daring as Mohammed Gunga's. Whatever Scots
  reserve and caution may have acted as a brake on Duncan McClean's enthusiasm
  were offset by the fact that his word was given; so far as he was concerned,
  he was now as much and as obedient a servant of the Company as either of the
  others. Nor was his attitude astonishing.</p>

  <p>Alwa's was the point of view that was amazing, unexpected, brilliant,
  soldierly, unselfish&mdash;all the things, in fact, that no one had the least
  right to expect it to turn out to be. Two or three thousand men looked to him
  as their hereditary chieftain who alone could help them hold their chins high
  amid an overwhelming Hindu population; his position was delicate, and he
  might have been excused for much hesitation, and even for a point-blank
  refusal to do what he might have preferred personally. He and his stood to
  lose all that they owned&mdash;their honor&mdash;and the honor of their wives
  and families, should they fight on the wrong side. Even as a soldier who had
  passed his word, he might have been excused for a lot of wordy questioning of
  orders, for he had enough at stake to make anybody cautious.</p>

  <p>Yet, having said his say and sworn a dozen God-invoking Rangar oaths
  before he pledged his word, and then having pledged it, he threw Rajput
  tradition and the odds against him into one bottomless discard and proceeded
  to show Cunningham exactly what his fealty meant.</p>

  <p>"By the boots and beard of Allah's Prophet!" he swore, growing freer-
  tongued now that his liberty of action had been limited. "Here we stand and
  talk like two old hags, Mohammed Gunga! My word is given. Let us find out now
  what this fledgling general of thine would have us do. If he is to release my
  prisoner, at least I would like to get amusement out of it!"</p>

  <p>So he and Mohammed Gunga swaggered across the courtyard to where
  Cunningham had joined the McCleans again.</p>

  <p>"We come with aid and not objections, sahib," he assured him. "If we
  listen, it may save explanations afterwards."</p>

  <p>So at a sign from Cunningham they enlarged the circle, and the East and
  West&mdash;bearded and clean-shaven, priest and soldiers, Christian and
  Mohammedan&mdash;stood in a ring, while almost the youngest of them&mdash; by
  far the youngest man of them&mdash;laid down the law for all. His eyes were
  all for Rosemary McClean, but his gestures included all of them, and they all
  answered him with nods or grunts as each saw fit.</p>

  <p>"Send for the Sikh!" commanded Cunningham.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, with a lump of native bread still in his fist, Jaidev
  Singh walked up and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Where is Byng-bahadur now?" asked Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"At Deeseera, sahib&mdash;not shut in altogether, but hard pressed. There
  came cholera, and Byng-bahadur camped outside the town. He has been striking,
  sahib, striking hard with all too few to help him. His irregulars, sahib,
  were disbanded at some one's orders just before this outbreak, but some of
  them came back at word from him. And there were some of us Sikhs who knew
  him, and who would rather serve him and die than fight against him and live.
  He has now two British regiments with him, sadly thinned&mdash;some of my
  people, some Gurkhas, some men from the North&mdash;not very many more than
  two thousand men all told, having lost heavily in action and by disease. But
  word is going round from mouth to mouth that many sahibs have been
  superseded, and that only real sahibs such as Byng-bahadur have commands in
  this hour. Byng-bahadur is a man of men. We who are with him begin to have
  courage in our bones again. Is the answer ready? Yet a little while? It is
  well, sahib, I will rest. Salaam!"</p>

  <p>"You see," said Cunningham, "the situation's desperate. We've got to act.
  Alwa here stands pledged to protect Howrah and you have promised to aid
  Jaimihr. Somebody's word has got to break, and you may take it from me that
  it will be the word of the weakest man! I think that that man is Jaimihr, but
  I can't be sure in advance, and we've got to accept his promise to begin
  with. Go to him, Miss McClean, and make a very careful bargain with him along
  the line I mapped out for you. Alwa-sahib, I want witnesses, or rather
  overhearers. I want you and Mohammed Gunga to place yourselves near Jaimihr's
  cell so that you can hear what he says. There won't be any doubt then about
  who has broken promises. Are you ready, Miss McClean?"</p>

  <p>She was trembling, but from excitement and not fear. Both Rajputs saluted
  her as she started back for the cell, and whatever their Mohammedan ideas on
  women may have been, they chose to honor this one, who was so evidently one
  of them in the hour of danger. Duncan McClean seemed to be praying softly,
  for his lips moved.</p>

  <p>When the cell-door creaked open, Alwa and Mohammed Gunga were crouched one
  on either side, listening with the ears of soldiers that do not let many
  sounds or words escape them.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr-sahib!" she whispered. "Jaimihr-sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! Sahiba!" Then he called her by half a dozen names that made the
  listening Rangars grin into their beards.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr-sahib"&mdash;she raised her voice a little now&mdash;"if I help
  you to escape, will you promise me my safety under all conditions?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, sahiba!"</p>

  <p>"Do you swear to protect every living person on this hill, including the
  Alwa-sahib and Cunningham-sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, sahiba."</p>

  <p>"You swear it?"</p>

  <p>"I swear it on my honor. There is no more sacred oath."</p>

  <p>"Then, listen. I can help you to escape now. I have a rope that is long
  enough to lower you over the parapet. I am prepared to risk the consequences,
  but I want to bargain with you for aid for my countrymen."</p>

  <p>Jaimihr did not answer.</p>

  <p>"The Alwa-sahib and his Rangars stand pledged to help your brother!"</p>

  <p>"I guessed at least that much," laughed Jaimihr.</p>

  <p>"They would not help you against him under any circumstances. But they
  want to ride to the Company's aid, and they might be prepared to protect you
  against him. They might guarantee the safety of your palace and your men's
  homes. They might exact a guarantee from Howrah."</p>

  <p>Jaimihr laughed aloud, careless of the risk of being overheard, and
  Rosemary knew that Cunningham's little plan was useless even before it had
  been quite expounded. She felt herself trembling for the consequences.</p>

  <p>"Sahiba, there is only one condition that would make me ride to the
  British aid with all my men."</p>

  <p>"Name it!"</p>

  <p>"Thou art it!"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you, Jaimihr-sahib," she whispered, understanding all
  too well.</p>

  <p>"Follow me. Come to me in Howrah. Then whatever these fool Rangars choose
  to do, I swear by Siva and the Rites of Siva that I will hurry to the
  Company's aid!"</p>

  <p>Rosemary McClean shuddered, and he knew it. But that fact rather added to
  his pleasure. The wolf prefers a cowering, frightened prey even though he
  dare fight on occasion. She was thinking against time. Through that one
  small, overburdened head, besides a splitting headache, there was flashing
  the ghastly thought of what was happening to her countrymen and women&mdash;
  of what would happen unless she hurried to do something for their aid. All
  the burden of all warring India seemed to be resting on her shoulders, in a
  stifling cell; and Jaimihr seemed to be the only help in sight.</p>

  <p>"How many men could you summon to the Company's aid?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Ten thousand!" he boasted.</p>

  <p>"Armed and drilled men&mdash;soldiers fit to fight?"</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>"I think that is a lie, Jaimihr-sahib. There is not time enough to waste
  on lies. Tell me the exact truth, please."</p>

  <p>He contrived to save his face, or, rather, he contrived to make himself
  believe he did.</p>

  <p>"I would need some to guard my rear," he answered. "I could lead five
  thousand to the British aid."</p>

  <p>"Is that the truth?"</p>

  <p>"On my honor, sahiba."</p>

  <p>"And you wish to marry me?"</p>

  <p>"Sahiba&mdash;I&mdash;I have no other wish!"</p>

  <p>"I agree to marry you provided you will lead five thousand men to the
  Company's aid, but not until you have done so."</p>

  <p>"You will come to Howrah?"</p>

  <p>She could feel his excitement. The cell walls seemed to throb.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but I shall come accompanied by my father, and Mr. Cunningham, and
  all the Rangars he can raise. And I shall hold you to your bargain. You must
  help the Company first. FIRST&mdash;d'you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand."</p>

  <p>It was Jaimihr's turn now to lay the law down. She had let him see her
  eagerness to gain his aid for the Company, and he saw the weakness of her
  case in an instant. He knew very well, too, that no woman of her breed would
  have thought of consenting to marry him unless her hand was forced. He
  decided immediately to force it further.</p>

  <p>"I understand, sahiba. I, too, will hold thee to thy promise! Thou wilt
  come with an escort, as befits a prince's wife! But how should I know that
  the Rangars would prove friends of mine? How should I know that it is not all
  a trap?"</p>

  <p>"You will have my promise to depend on."</p>

  <p>"Truly! And there will be how many hundred men to override the promise of
  one woman? Nay! My word is good; my promise holds; but on my own conditions!
  Help me to escape. Then follow me to Howrah City. Come in advance of thy
  Rangar escort. By that I will know that the Rangars and this Cunningham are
  my friends&mdash;otherwise they would not let thee come. The Rangars are to
  exact guarantees from my brother? How should I know that they do not come to
  help my brother crush me out of existence? With thee in my camp as hostage I
  would risk agreement with them, but not otherwise. Escape with me now, or
  follow. But bring no Rangars, sahiba! Come alone!"</p>

  <p>"I will not. I would not dare trust you."</p>

  <p>Jaimihr laughed. "I have been reckoning, sahiba, how many hours will pass
  before my army comes to rip this nest of Alwa's from its roots, and defile
  the whole of it! If I am to spare the people on this rock, then I must hurry!
  Should my men come here to carry me away, they will be less merciful than I!
  Choose, sahiba! Let me go, and I will spare these Rangars until such time as
  they earn punishment anew. Or let me go, and follow me. They fight with the
  Rangars and for the Company, with thee as the price of my alliance. Or leave
  me in this cell until my men come to rescue me. The last would be the
  simplest way! Or it would be enough to help me escape and wait until I have
  done my share at conquering the British. Then I could come and claim thee!
  Choose, sahiba; there are many ways, though they all end in one goal."</p>

  <p>"If I am the price of your allegiance," said Rosemary, "then I will pay
  the price. Five thousand men for the British cause are dearer to me than my
  own happiness. I promise, Jaimihr-sahib, that I will come to you in Howrah. I
  shall come accompanied by one servant, named Joanna, and&mdash;I think
  &mdash;by my father; and the Rangars and Mr. Cunningham shall be at least a
  day's ride behind me. I give my word on that. But&mdash;I can promise you, on
  Mr. Cunningham's behalf, and on the Alwa-sahib's, and Mohammed Gunga's, that
  should you have made any attempt against my liberty&mdash;should you have
  offered me any insult or indignity&mdash;before they come&mdash; should you
  have tried to anticipate the terms of your agreement&mdash;then
  &mdash;then&mdash;there would be an end of bargaining and promises,
  Jaimihr-sahib, and your life would be surely forfeit! Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, sahiba!"</p>

  <p>"Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"I already have agreed. They are my terms. I named them!"</p>

  <p>"I would like to hear you promise, on your honor."</p>

  <p>"I swear by all my gods and by my honor. I swear by my love, that is
  dearer to me than a throne, and by the name and the honor of a Rajput!"</p>

  <p>"Be ready, then. I am going now to hide the rope in the shadow of the
  wall. It will take perhaps fifteen minutes. Be ready."</p>

  <p>He made a quick movement to embrace her, but she slipped out and escaped
  him; and he thought better of his sudden plan to follow her, remembering that
  her word was likely to be good, whatever his might be. He elected to wait
  inside until she returned for him. He little knew that he missed the downward
  swing of Alwa's saber, that was waiting, poised and balanced for him, in the
  darkness by the door.</p>

  <p>"Bismillah! I would have had a right to kill him had he followed her and
  broken faith so early in the business!" Alwa swore, excusing his impatience
  to Mohammed Gunga. "Have no fear, sahib!" he counselled Cunningham a moment
  later, laying a heavy hand on the boy's arm. "Let her keep her promises. That
  Hindu pig will not keep his! We will be after her, and surely&mdash;surely we
  will find good cause for some throat-slitting as well as the cancelling of
  marriage promises!"</p>

  <p>"Do you understand, Alwa-sahib, that&mdash;if Jaimihr keeps his promise to
  her, she must keep hers to him? Do you realize that?"</p>

  <p>"Allah! Listen to him! Yes, sahib. Truly, bahadur, I appreciate! I also
  know that I have given certain promises which I, too, must fulfill! She is
  not the only bargainer! I am worrying more about those guarantees that Howrah
  was to give&mdash;I am anxious to see how, with fifteen hundred, we are to
  get the better of a Rajah and his brother and their total of ten thousand! I
  want to see those promises performed! Ay! The Miss-sahib has done well. She
  has done her share. Let her continue. And do thou thy share, bahadur! I am at
  thy back with my men, but give us action!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham held up a lantern, and looked straight at Duncan McClean. The
  missionary had held his daughter's hand while she recounted what had happened
  in the cell. Whatever he may have thought, he had uttered no word of
  remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we go to Howrah ahead of you," he answered to Cunningham's
  unspoken question.</p>

  <p>Cunningham held out his right hand, and the missionary shook it.</p>

  <p>"Hold the lamp, please," said Cunningham, and Mohammed Gunga seized it.
  Then Cunningham took paper and a pencil and read aloud the answer that he
  wrote to Byng-bahadur. He wrote it in Greek characters for fear lest it might
  fall into the enemy's hands and be too well understood.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I can be with you in one week, sir, and perhaps sooner.
  Unless we are all killed in the meantime we should number more than fifteen
  hundred when we come. Expect either all or none of us. The situation here is
  critical, but our course seems clear, and we ought to pull through. Mohammed
  Gunga sends salaams. Your obedient servant, "RALPH CUNNINGHAM."</p>

  <p>"Would God I could see the clear course!" laughed Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Call the Sikh, please."</p>

  <p>The Sikh came running, and Cunningham gave him the folded note.</p>

  <p>"Have you a horse for him, Alwa-sahib?"</p>

  <p>"That has been attended to, sahib," the Sikh answered. "The Alwa-sahib has
  given me a wonder of a horse."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, Jaidev Singh. Watch your chance. Go to the parapet, and
  when you see by their lanterns that the cavalry below have ridden off, then
  race for all you're worth with that news for Byng-bahadur!"</p>

  <p>"Salaam, sahib!" said the Sikh.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Jaidev Singh. And now hide, everybody! Don't let Jaimihr get the
  impression that we're playing with him."</p>

  <p>A little later Miss McClean led Jaimihr through a passage in the rock, off
  which axe-hewn cells led on either side, to the far side of the summit, where
  the parapet was higher but the wall was very much less sheer. The Prince's
  arms were still too sore from the wrenching he received when they took him
  prisoner for him to dare trust himself hand over hand on a rope; she had to
  make the rope fast beneath his armpits, and then lower him slowly, taking two
  turns with the rope round the waist of a brass cannon. The Prince fended
  himself off the ragged wall with hands and feet, and called up instructions
  to her as loudly as he dared.</p>

  <p>It was a tremendous drop. For the last fifty or more feet the wall rose
  straight, overhung by a ridge that rasped the rope. And the rope proved
  fifteen feet or more too short. Rosemary paid out as much of it as she dared,
  and then made the end fast round the cannon, leaning over to see whether
  Jaimihr would have sense enough or skill enough to cut himself free and fall.
  But he hung where he was and spun, and it was five minutes before Rosemary
  remembered that his weapons had all been taken from him! It was scarcely
  likely that he could bite the thick rope through with his teeth!</p>

  <p>She stood then for two or three more minutes wondering what to do, for she
  had no knife of her own, and she had made the rope fast&mdash;woman-wise
  &mdash;with a true landlubber's knot that tightened from the strain until her
  struggling fingers could not make the least impression on it. But Alwa walked
  up openly&mdash;drew his heavy saber&mdash;and saved the situation for
  her.</p>

  <p>"That may help to jog his recollection of the bargain!" he laughed,
  severing the rope with a swinging cut and peering over to see, if he could,
  how Jaimihr landed. By a miracle the Prince landed on his feet. He sat down
  for a moment to recover from the shock, and then walked off awkwardly to
  where his cavalry were sleeping by their horses.</p>

  <p>He had some trouble in persuading the outposts who he really was, and
  there was an argument that could be quite distinctly heard from the summit of
  the rock, and made Alwa roar with laughter before, finally, the whole
  contingent formed and wheeled and moved away, ambling toward Howrah City at a
  pace that betokened no unwillingness.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the Sikh's horse thundered out across the plain from
  under Alwa's iron gate, and the news, such as it was, was on its way to Byng-
  bahadur.</p>

  <p>"A clear road at the price of a horse-hide rope!" laughed Alwa. "Now for
  some real man's work!"</p>

  <p>Rosemary stole off to argue with her father and her conscience, but Alwa
  went to his troopers' quarters and told off ten good men for the task of
  manning the fortress in his absence. They were ten unwilling men; it needed
  all his gruff authority, and now and then a threat, to make them stay
  behind.</p>

  <p>"I must leave ten men behind," he insisted. "It takes four men, even at a
  pinch, to lift the gate. And who shall guard my women? Nay, I should leave
  twenty, and I must leave ten. Therefore I leave the ten best men I have, and
  they who stay behind may know by that that I consider them the best!"</p>

  <p>The remainder of his troopers he sent out one by one in different
  directions, with orders to rally every Rangar they could find, and at a
  certain point he named. Then he and Mohammed Gunga said good-by to Cunningham
  and took a trail that led in the direction where most of the doubtfuls lived
  &mdash;the men who might need personal convincing&mdash;rousing&mdash;
  awakening from lethargy.</p>

  <p>"You think I ought to stay behind?" asked Cunningham, who had already made
  his mind up but chose to consult Alwa.</p>

  <p>"Surely, sahib. If for no other reason, then to make sure that that priest
  of thine and his daughter make tracks for Howrah City! While he is here he is
  a priest, and we Rangars have our own ideas on what they are good for! When
  he is there he will be a man maneuvering to save his own life and his
  daughter's reputation! See that he starts, sahib!"</p>

  <p>He rode off then. But before Mohammed Gunga saw fit to follow him he
  legged his charger close to Cunningham for a final word or two.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear now, bahadur&mdash;no anxiety! Three days hence there will
  be a finer regiment to lead than ever thundered in thy father's wake&mdash; a
  regiment of men, sahib, for a man to lead and love!&mdash;a regiment that
  will trust thee, sahib! See thou to the guarantees! Rung Ho, bahadur!"</p>

  <p>"Rung Ho! See you again, Mohammed Gunga!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"

  <p class="poem">Sabers and spurs and jingling bits&mdash;<br>
  (Ho! But the food to feed them!)<br>
  Sinews and eyes and ears and wits&mdash;<br>
  (Hey! But the troopers need them!)<br>
  Sahib, mount! Thy chargers fling<br>

  <p class="first">IT was arranged that the McCleans, with old Joanna, should
  start at dawn for Howrah City, and they were, both of them, too overcome with
  mingled dread and excitement to even try to sleep. Joanna, very much as
  usual, snoozed comfortably, curled in a blanket in a corner.</p>

  <p>They would run about a hundred different risks, not least of which was the
  chance of falling in with a party of Howrah's men. In fact, if they should
  encounter anybody before bringing up at Jaimihr's palace it was likely that
  the whole plan would fizzle into nothing.</p>

  <p>Cunningham, after fossicking for a long time in Alwa's armory&mdash;that
  contained, besides weapons of the date, a motley assortment of the tools of
  war that would have done great credit to a museum of antiquities&mdash;
  produced two pistols. He handed, one to the missionary and one to Miss
  McClean, advising her to hide hers underneath her clothing. "You know what
  they're for?" he asked. "No. You'd gain nothing by putting up a fight.
  They're loaded. All you've got to do is jerk the hammer back and pull the
  trigger, and the best way not to miss is to hold the muzzle underneath your
  chin&mdash;this way&mdash;keeping the butt well out from you. You make sure
  when you do that. The only satisfaction you'll have, if it comes to suicide
  as a last resort, will be that you've tried to do your duty and the knowledge
  that you'll be avenged. I promise that. But I don't think you'll have any
  need to do it&mdash;if I did think it I'd have thought twice before sending
  you."</p>

  <p>"How does such a very young man as you come to have all this
  responsibility?" asked Rosemary, taking the pistol without a shudder. She
  laughed then as she noticed Cunningham's discomfort and recognized the
  decency that hates to talk about itself.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I know my own mind," he answered. "These other awfully decent
  fellows don't, that's all&mdash;if you except Mohammed Gunga. That chap's a
  wonder. 'Pon my soul, it seems he knew this was coming and picked me from the
  start to take charge over here. Seems, owing to my dad's reputation, these
  Rangars think me a sort of reincarnation of efficiency. I've got to try and
  live up to it, you know&mdash;same old game of reaping what you didn't sow
  and hoping it'll all be over before you wake up! Won't you try and get some
  sleep before morning? No? Come and sit over by the parapet with me,
  then."</p>

  <p>He carried chairs for both of them to a point whence he could sit and
  watch the track that led to Howrah and so help out the very meager garrison.
  There, until the waning moon dipped down below the sky-line, they talked
  together&mdash;first about the task ahead of each of them; then about the
  sudden ghastliness of the rebellion, whose extent not one of them could
  really grasp as yet; last, and much longest, as familiarity gradually grew
  between them, of youthful reminiscences and home&mdash;of Eton and the Isle
  of Skye.</p>

  <p>In the darkness and the comparative coolness that came between the setting
  of the moon and dawn Rosemary fell asleep, her head pillowed in her father's
  lap. For a while, then, seeing her only dimly through the night, but
  conscious, as he could not help being, of her youth and charm and of the act
  of self-sacrifice that she had undertaken without remonstrance, he felt
  ashamed. He began to wonder whether there might not have been some other way
  &mdash;whether he had any right, even for his country's sake, to send a girl
  on such a mission. Misgiving began to sap his optimism, and there was no
  Mohammed Gunga to stir the soldier in him and encourage iron-willed pursuance
  of the game. He began to doubt; and doubt bred silence.</p>

  <p>He was wakened from a reverie by Duncan McClean, who raised his daughter
  tenderly and got up on his feet.</p>

  <p>"The dawn will be here soon, Mr. Cunningham. We had better get ready. Well
  &mdash;in case we never meet again&mdash;I'm glad I met you."</p>

  <p>"Better start before the sun gets up," he answered, gripping the
  missionary's hand. He was a soldier again. He had had the answer to his
  thoughts! If the man who was to sacrifice his daughter&mdash;or risk her
  sacrifice&mdash;was pleased to have met him, there was not much sense in
  harboring self-criticism! He shook it off, and squared his shoulders,
  beginning again to think of all that lay ahead.</p>

  <p>"Trust to the old woman to guide you and show you a place to rest at, if
  you must rest. You ought to reach Howrah at dusk tomorrow, for you'll find it
  quite impossible to travel fast&mdash;you're both of you too stiff, for one
  thing. Lie up somewhere&mdash;Joanna will know of a place&mdash;until the old
  woman has taken in a message to Jaimihr, and wait until he sends you some men
  to escort you through the outskirts of the city. I've got disguises ready for
  you&mdash;a puggree for you, Mr. McClean, and a purdah for your
  daughter&mdash;you'll travel as a Hindu merchant and his wife. If you get
  stopped, say very little, but show this."</p>

  <p>He produced the letter written once by Maharajah Howrah to the Alwa-sahib
  and sent by galloper with the present of a horse. It was signed, and at the
  bottom of it was the huge red royal seal. "Now go and put the disguise on,
  while I see to the horses; I'm going to pick out quiet ones, if possible,
  though I warn you they're rare in these parts."</p>

  <p>Some twenty minutes later he led their horses for them gingerly down the
  slippery rock gorge, and waited at the bottom while six men wound the gate up
  slowly. Rosemary McClean was quite unrecognizable, draped from head to foot
  in a traveling veil that might have been Mohammedan or Hindu, and gave no
  outward sign as to her caste, or rank. McClean, in the full attire of a
  fairly prosperous Hindu, but with no other mark about him to betoken that he
  might be worth robbing, rode in front of her, high-perched on a native
  saddle. In front, on a desert pony, rode Joanna, garbed as a man.</p>

  <p>"She ought to be traveling in a carriage of some kind," admitted
  Cunningham, "but we haven't got a single wheeled thing here. If any one asks
  pertinent questions on the road, you'd better say that she had an ekka,* but
  that some Rangars took it from you. D'you think you know the language well
  enough to pass muster?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ekka, ecka</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a one-horse, two-
  wheeled, springless cart. <i><a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-
bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:862.hobson">The
  Hobson Jobson Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"It's a little late to ask me that!" laughed McClean. "Yes&mdash;I'm
  positive I do. Good-by."</p>

  <p>They shook hands again and the three rode off, cantering presently, to
  make the most of the coolness before the sun got up. Cunningham climbed
  slowly up the hill and then watched them from the parapet&mdash;wondering,
  wondering again&mdash;whether he was justified. As he put it to himself, it
  was "the hell of a position for a man to find himself in!" He caught himself
  wondering whether his thoughts would have been the same, and whether his
  conscience would have racked him quite as much, had Rosemary McClean been
  older, and less lovely, and a little more sour-tongued.</p>

  <p>He had to laugh presently at the absurdity of that notion, for Jaimihr
  would never have bargained for possession of a sour-faced, elderly woman. He
  came to the conclusion that the only thing he could do was to congratulate
  the Raj because, at the right minute, the right good-looking woman had been
  on the spot! But he did not like the circumstances any better; and before two
  hours had passed the loneliness began to eat into his soul.</p>

  <p>Like any other man whose race and breed and training make him self-
  dependent, he could be alone for weeks on end and scarcely be aware that he
  had nobody to talk to. But his training had never yet included sending women
  off on dangerous missions any more than it had taught him to resist woman's
  attraction&mdash;the charm of a woman's voice, the lure of a woman's eyes. He
  did not know what was the matter with him, but supposed that his liver must
  be out of order or else that the sun had touched him.</p>

  <p>Taking a chance on the liver diagnosis, he had out the attenuated
  garrison, and drilled it, both mounted and dismounted, first on the hilltop
  &mdash;where they made the walls re-echo to the clang of grounded butts
  &mdash;and then on the plain below, with the gate wide open in their rear and
  one man watching from the height above. When he had tired them thoroughly,
  and himself as well, he set two men on the lookout and retired to sleep; nor
  did the droning and the wailing music of some women in the harem trouble
  him.</p>

  <p>They called him regularly when the guard was changed, but he slept the
  greater part of that day and stood watch all night. The next day, and the
  third day, he drilled the garrison again, growing horribly impatient and
  hourly more worried as to what Byng-bahadur might be doing, and thinking of
  him.</p>

  <p>It was evening of the fourth day when a Rangar woke him, squeezing at his
  foot and standing silent by the cot.</p>

  <p>"Huzoor&mdash;Mohammed Gunga comes!"</p>

  <p>"Thank God!"</p>

  <p>He ran to the parapet and watched in the fading light a little dust cloud
  that followed no visible track but headed straight toward them over
  desert.</p>

  <p>"How d'you know that's Mohammed Gunga?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Who else, huzoor? Who else would ride from that direction all alone and
  straight for this nest of wasps? Who else but Alwa or Mohammed Gunga? Alwa
  said he would not come, but would wait yonder."</p>

  <p>"It might be one of Alwa's men."</p>

  <p>"We have many good men, sahib&mdash;and many good horses&mdash;but no man
  or horse who could come at that pace after traversing those leagues of
  desert! That is Mohammed Gunga, unless a new fire-eater has been found. And
  what new man would know the way?"</p>

  <p>Soon&mdash;staccato, like a drum-beat in the silence&mdash;came the
  welcome, thrilling cadence of the horse's hoofs&mdash;the steady thunder of a
  horse hard-ridden but not foundered. The sun went down and blackness
  supervened, but the sound increased, as one lone rider raced with the evening
  wind, head on.</p>

  <p>It seemed like an hour before the lookout challenged from the crag that
  overhung the gate&mdash;before the would-be English words rang out; and all
  Asia and its jackals seemed to wait in silence for the answer.</p>

  <p>"Howt-uh! Hukkums-thar!"</p>

  <p>"Ma-hommed-Gunga&mdash;hai!"</p>

  <p>"Hurrah!"</p>

  <p>The cheer broke bonds from the depth of Cunningham's being, and Mohammed
  Gunga heard it on the plain below. There was a rush to man the wheels and
  sweat the gate up, and Cunningham started to run down the zigzag pathway. He
  thought better of it, though, and waited where the path gave out onto the
  courtyard, giving the signal with the cords for the gate to lower away
  again.</p>

  <p>"Evening, Mohammed Gunga!" he said, almost casually, as the weary
  charger's nose appeared above the rise.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, bahadur!"</p>

  <p>He dismounted and saluted and then leaned against his horse.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, sahib, whether the horse or I be weariest! Of your favor,
  water, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham brought him water in a dipper, and the Rajput washed his
  horse's mouth out, then held out the dipper again to Cunningham for fresh
  charge for himself.</p>

  <p>"I would not ask the service, sahib, but for the moment my head reels. I
  must rest before I ride again."</p>

  <p>"Is all well, Mohammed Gunga?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, sahib! More than well!"</p>

  <p>"The men are ready?"</p>

  <p>"Horsed, armed, and waiting, they keep coming&mdash;there were many when I
  left&mdash;there will be three squadrons worthy of the name by the time we
  get there! Is all well at your end, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all's well."</p>

  <p>"Did the padre people go to Howrah?"</p>

  <p>"They started and they have not returned."</p>

  <p>"Then, Allah be praised! Inshallah,* I will grip that spectacled old woman
  of a priest by the hand before I die. He has a spark of manhood in him! Send
  me this good horse to the stables, sahib; I am overweary. Have him watered
  when the heat has left him, and then fed. Let them blanket him lightly. And,
  sahib, have his legs rubbed&mdash;that horse ever loved to have his legs
  rubbed. Allah! I must sleep four hours before I ride! And the Miss-sahib
  &mdash;went she bravely?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Inshallah, Insh'allah</i> (Arabic)&mdash;God
  willing.]</p>

  <p>"Went as a woman of her race ought to go, Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>"Ha! She met a man first of her own race, and he made her go! Would she
  have gone if a coward asked her, think you? Sahib&mdash;women are good
  &mdash;at the other end of things! We will ride and fetch her. Ha! I saw! My
  eyes are old, but they bear witness yet!&mdash;Now, food, sahib&mdash;for the
  love of Allah, food, before my belt-plate and my backbone touch!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the damned old infidel is dreaming of!" swore Cunningham,
  as Mohammed Gunga staggered to the chamber in the rock where a serving-man
  was already heaping victuals for him.</p>

  <p>"Have me called in four hours, sahib! In four hours I will be a man
  again!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31">CHAPTER 31</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">The freed wolf limped home to his lair,<br>
  And lay to lick his sore.<br>
  With wrinkled lip and fangs agnash&mdash;<br>
  With back-laid ear and eyes aflash&mdash;<br>
  "Twas something rather more than rash<br>
  To turn me loose!" he swore.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOW Jaimihr fondly thought he held a few cards up his sleeve
  when he made his bargain with Rosemary McClean and let himself be lowered
  from the Alwa- sahib's rock. He knew, better probably than any one except his
  brother and the priests, how desperate the British situation had become
  throughout all India at an instant's notice, and he made his terms
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>He did not believe, in the first place, that there would be any British
  left to succor by the time matters had been settled sufficiently in Howrah to
  enable him to dare leave the city at his rear. Afterwards, should it seem
  wise, he would have no objection in the world to riding to the aid of a
  Company that no longer existed.</p>

  <p>In the second place, he entertained no least compunction about breaking
  his word completely in every particular. He knew that the members of the
  little band on Alwa's rock would keep their individual and collective word,
  and therefore that Rosemary McClean would come to him. He suspected, though,
  that there would prove to be a rider of some sort to her agreement as
  regarded marrying him, for he had young Cunningham in mind; and he knew
  enough of Englishmen from hearsay and deduction to guess that Cunningham
  would interject any obstacle his ingenuity could devise.</p>

  <p>Natives of India do not like Englishmen to marry their women. How much
  less, then, would a stiff-necked member of a race of conquerors care to stand
  by while a woman of his own race became the wife of a native prince? He did
  not trust Cunningham, and he recalled that he had had no promise from that
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he proposed to forestall Cunningham if possible, and, if that
  were inconvenient or rash, he meant to take other means of making Rosemary
  McClean his, beyond dispute, in any case.</p>

  <p>Next to Rosemary McClean he coveted most the throne of Howrah. With regard
  to that he was shrewd enough not to conceal from himself for a second the
  necessity for scotching the priests of Siva before he dare broach the Howrah
  treasure, and so make the throne worth his royal while. Nor did he omit from
  his calculations the public clamor that would probably be raised should he
  deal too roughly with the priests. And he intended to deal roughly with
  them.</p>

  <p>So the proposed allegiance of the Rangars suited him in more ways than
  one. His army and his brother's were so evenly matched in numbers and
  equipment that he had been able to leave Howrah without fear for the safety
  of his palace while his back was turned. The eight hundred whom he had led on
  the unlucky foray to Alwa's were scarcely missed, and, even had the Maharajah
  known that he was absent with them, there were still too many men behind for
  him to dare to start reprisals. The Maharajah was too complete a coward to do
  anything much until he was forced into it.</p>

  <p>The Rangars, he resolved, must be made to take the blame for the broaching
  of the treasure. He proposed to go about the broaching even before
  hostilities between himself and his brother had commenced, and he expected to
  be able to trick the Rangars into seeming to be looting. To appear to defend
  the treasure would probably not be difficult; and it would be even less
  difficult to blame the Rangars afterwards for the death of any priest who
  might succumb during the ensuing struggle. He counted on the populace, more
  than on his own organized forces, to make the Rangars powerless when the time
  should come for them to try to take the upper hand. The mob would suffer in
  the process, but its fanaticism&mdash;its religious prejudice and numbers
  &mdash;would surely win the day.</p>

  <p>As for Rosemary McClean, the more he considered her the more his brown
  eyes glowed. He had promised to make her Maharani. But he knew too thoroughly
  what that would mean not to entertain more than a passing doubt as to the
  wisdom of the course. He was as ready to break his word on that point as on
  any other.</p>

  <p>A woman of his own race, however wooed and won, would have been content to
  accept the usual status of whisperer from behind the close-meshed screens.
  Not so an Englishwoman, with no friends to keep her company and with nothing
  in the world to do but think. She, he realized, would expect to make
  something definite of her position, and that would suit neither his creed
  (which was altogether superficial), nor custom (which was iron-bound and to
  be feared), nor prejudice (which was prodigious), nor yet convenience (which
  counted most).</p>

  <p>He came to the conclusion that the fate in store for her was not such as
  she would have selected had she had her choice. Nor were his conclusions in
  regard to her such as would commend him in the eyes of honest men.</p>

  <p>But, after all, the throne was the fulcrum of his plotting; and the lever
  had to be the treasure, if his plans were to succeed beyond upsetting. He
  changed his plans a dozen times over before he arrived at last at the
  audacious decision he was seeking.</p>

  <p>Like many another Hindu in that hour of England's need, he did not lose
  sight altogether of the distant if actual possibility that the Company's
  servants might&mdash;by dint of luck and grit, and what the insurance papers
  term the Act of God&mdash;pull through the crisis. Therefore, he decided that
  under no circumstances should Rosemary McClean be treated cavalierly until
  the Rangars were out of the way and he could pose as her protector if need
  be.</p>

  <p>He would be able to prove that Rosemary and her father had come to him of
  their own free will. He would say that they had asked him for protection from
  the Rangars. He had evidence that his brother Howrah had been in
  communication with the Rangars. So, should the Company survive and retain
  power enough to force an answer to unpleasant questions, he thought it would
  not be difficult to prove that he had been the Company's friend all
  along.</p>

  <p>Under all the circumstances he considered it best to be false to everybody
  and strike for no hand but his own, and with that reconsidered end in view he
  decided on a master-stroke. He sent word to his brother, the Maharajah,
  saying that the Rangars had accepted service with the Company and purposed a
  raid on Howrah; therefore, he proposed that they unite against the common
  enemy and set a trap for the Rangars.</p>

  <p>Howrah sent back to ask what proof he had of the Rangars' taking service
  with the British. Jaimihr answered that Cunningham and Mohammed Gunga were
  both on Alwa's crag. He also swore that as Alwa's prisoner he had been able
  to overhear the Rangars' plans.</p>

  <p>The Maharajah was bewildered, as Jaimihr had expected that he would be.
  And with just as Eastern, just as muddle-headed, just as dishonest reasoning,
  he made up his mind to play a double game with everybody, too. He agreed to
  join Jaimihr in opposition to the Rangars. He agreed to send all his forces
  to meet Jaimihr's and together kill every Rangar who should show himself
  inside the city. And he privately made plans to arrive on the scene too late,
  and smash Jaimihr's army after it had been reduced in size and efficiency by
  its battle with Alwa's men.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr, unknowingly, fitted his plan into his brother's by determining to
  get on the scene early enough to have first crack at the treasure. He meant
  to get away with that, leave his brother to deal with Alwa's men, circle
  round, and then attack his brother from the rear.</p>

  <p>Finally, he made up his mind once and for all that Rosemary McClean must
  remain inviolate until he was quite certain that the English had been driven
  out of India. He expected that good news within a week.</p>

  <p>He was delighted when Joanna, dressed as a man, turned up at his palace-
  gates and cajoled her way in past the guards. To be asked for an escort to
  bring the McCleans into Howrah fitted in with his role of protector as a key
  might fit a lock. Now they could never pretend&mdash;nobody could ever
  pretend&mdash;that he had seized them. He sent a carriage out for them, and
  when they arrived placed a whole wing of his palace at their disposal,
  treating them like royalty. He made no attempt to molest or interfere with
  either of them, except that he prevented them from going in and out; and he
  told off plenty of witnesses who would be able to swear subsequently that
  they had seen how well his guests were treated. He was taking no unnecessary
  chances at that stage of the game he played.</p>

  <p>There were others, though, who plotted besides Jaimihr. There were, for
  instance, Siva's priests. It is not to be forgotten that in that part of
  India the priests had been foremost in fomenting the rebellion. They urged
  Howrah constantly to take the field against the British, and it was only the
  sure knowledge of his brother's intention to strike for the throne that
  prevented the Maharajah from doing what the priests urged.</p>

  <p>He knew that Alwa and the Rangars would not help him unless Jaimihr first
  attacked him, for Alwa would be sure to stand on the strict letter of his
  oath. And he was afraid of the Rangars. He feared that they might protect him
  and depose him afterwards. He reasoned that that, too, might be construed
  into a strict interpretation of the terms of Alwa's promise!</p>

  <p>He consented to collect his army. He kept it under arms. He even paid it
  something on account of arrears of wages and served out rations. But, to the
  disgust of the priests who asked nothing better than dissension between the
  brothers, he jumped at the idea of uniting with Jaimihr to defeat Alwa's men.
  He knew&mdash;just as the priests feared&mdash;that once he could trick and
  defeat Jaimihr he could treat the troublesome priests as cavalierly as he
  chose.</p>

  <p>So the priests made a third knot in the tangle and tried desperately at
  the last moment to recreate dissension between the rival royal camps.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr is getting ready to attack you!" they assured Howrah. "Attack him
  first!"</p>

  <p>"I will wait until he does attack," the Maharajah answered. "For the
  moment we are friends and have a cause in common."</p>

  <p>"Howrah's men will desert to you the moment you make a move to win the
  throne," they assured Jaimihr.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" answered Jaimihr. "Wait but a day or two. I will move fast as I
  see fit when I am ready. For the present my cause and my brother's cause are
  one."</p>

  <p>Spies brought in news to Maharajah, Prince, and priest of the hurried
  raising of a Rangar army. The Maharajah and the Prince laughed up their
  sleeves and the priests swore horribly; the interjection of another element
  &mdash;another creed&mdash;into the complication did not suit the priestly
  "book." They were the only men who were really worried about Alwa.</p>

  <p>And another spy&mdash;Joanna&mdash;disappeared. No longer garbed as a man,
  she had hung about the palace, and&mdash;known to nearly all the
  sweepers&mdash;she had overheard things. Garbed as a man again, she suddenly
  evaporated in thin air, and Rosemary McClean was left without a servant or
  any means of communication with the outside world.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32">CHAPTER 32</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">The ringed wolf glared the circle round<br>
  Through baleful, blue-lit eye,<br>
  Not unforgetful of his debt.<br>
  "Now, heed ye how ye draw the net."<br>
  Quoth he: "I'll do some damage yet<br>
  Or ere my turn to die!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE mare that had been a present from Mohammed Gunga was
  brought out and saddled, together with a fresh horse for the Risaldar. The
  veteran had needed no summoning, for with a soldier's instinct he had wakened
  at the moment his self-allotted four hours had expired. He mounted a little
  stiffly, and tried his horse's paces up and down the courtyard once or twice
  before nodding to Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"All ready, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Ready, Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>But there was one other matter, after all, that needed attention
  first.</p>

  <p>"That horse of mine that brought me hither"&mdash;the Risaldar picked out
  the man who waited with the gong cord in his hand&mdash;"is left in thy
  particular charge. Dost thou hear me? I will tell the Alwa-sahib what I now
  tell thee&mdash;that horse will be required of thee fit, good-tempered,
  light-mouthed, not spur-marked, and thoroughly well groomed. There will be a
  reward in the one case, but in the other&mdash;I would not stand in thy
  shoes! It is a trust!"</p>

  <p>"Come along, Risaldar!" called Cunningham. "We're wasting an awful lot of
  time!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib, but a good horse is like a woman, to be loved and treated
  faithfully! Neither horse nor woman should be sacrificed for less than duty!
  Lead on, bahadur&mdash;I will join thee at the gate."</p>

  <p>He had several directions to give for the horse's better care, and
  Cunningham was forced to wait at least five minutes for him at the foot of
  the steep descent. Then for another minute the two sat their horses side by
  side, while the great gate rose slowly, grudgingly, cranked upward by four
  men.</p>

  <p>"If we two ever ride under here again, bahadur, we shall ride with honor
  thick on us," remarked Mohammed Gunga. "God knows what thy plan may be; but I
  know that from now on there will be no peace for either of us until we have
  helped rip it with our blades from the very belly of rebellion. Ride!"</p>

  <p>The gate clanged down behind them as&mdash;untouched by heel or spur
  &mdash;the two spring-limbed chargers raced for their bits across the sand.
  They went like shadows, casting other shadows&mdash;moon-made&mdash;wind-
  driven&mdash;knee-to-knee.</p>

  <p>"Now, sahib!"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar broke silence after fifteen minutes. Neither he nor
  Cunningham were of the type that chatters when the time has come to loosen
  sabers and sit tight.</p>

  <p>"In the matter of what lies ahead&mdash;as I said, neither I nor any man
  knows what this plan of thine may be, but I and the others have accepted thy
  bare word. These men who await thee&mdash;and they are many, and all
  soldiers, good, seasoned horsemen&mdash;have been told that the son of
  Cunnigan will lead them. Alwa has given his word, and I mine, that in the
  matter of a leader there is nothing left to be desired. And my five men have
  told them of certain happenings that they have seen. Therefore, thou art
  awaited with no little keenness. They will be all eyes and ears. It might be
  well, then, to set the pace a little slower, for a man looks better on a
  fresh horse than on a weary one!"</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking, Mohammed Gunga, of the two McCleans and of General Byng,
  who is expecting us. There is little time to lose."</p>

  <p>"I, too, consider them, sahib. It is we Rangars who must do the saber
  work. All, sahib&mdash;<strong>all</strong>&mdash;depends now on the
  impression created on the men awaiting thee! Rein in a little. Thy father's
  name, thine own, and mine and Alwa's weigh for much on thy side; but have a
  sound horse between thy legs and a trumpet in thy throat when we get there! I
  have seen more than one officer have to fight up-hill for the hearts of his
  troopers because his tired horse stumbled or looked shabby on the first
  parade. Draw rein a little, sahib."</p>

  <p>So Cunningham, still saying nothing, drew back into an easy canter. He was
  conscious of something, not at all like a trumpet, in his throat that was
  nearly choking him. He did not care to let Mohammed Gunga know that what was
  being mistaken for masterly silence was really emotion! He did not speak
  because he did not trust his voice.</p>

  <p>"There are three squadrons, sahib&mdash;each of about five hundred men.
  Alwa has the right wing, I the left. Take thou the center and command the
  whole. The horses are as good as any in this part of India, for each man has
  brought his best to do thee honor. Each man carries four days' rations in his
  saddle-bag and two days' rations for his horse. More horse feed is
  collecting, and they are bringing wagons, to follow when we give the word.
  But we thought there would be little sense in ordering wagons to follow us to
  Howrah City, knowing that thy plan would surely entail action. If we are to
  ride to the aid of Byng-bahadur it seemed better to pick up the wagons on the
  journey back again. That is all, sahib. There will be no time, of course, to
  waste on talk or drill. Take charge the moment that we get there&mdash; issue
  thy orders&mdash;and trust to the men understanding each command. Lead off
  without delay."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Cunningham&mdash;two English words that went much
  further to allay the Risaldar's anxiety than any amount of rhetoric would
  have done. "But&mdash;d'you mean to tell me that the men don't understand
  words of command?"</p>

  <p>"All of them do, sahib&mdash;but to many of them the English words are
  new. They all understand formations, and those who know the English words are
  teaching the others while they wait for us. There is not one man among them
  but has couched a lance or swung a saber in some force or other?"</p>

  <p>"Good. Have they all got lances?"</p>

  <p>"All the front-rank men are armed with lance and saber&mdash;the rear
  ranks have sabers only."</p>

  <p>"Good."</p>

  <p>After two hours of steady cantering the going changed and became a quick
  succession of ever-deepening gorges cleft in sandstone. Far away in the
  distance to the left there rose a glow that showed where Howrah City kept
  uneasy vigil, doubtless with watch-fires at every street corner. It looked
  almost as though the distant city were in flames.</p>

  <p>Ahead of them lay the gloom of hell's mouth and the silence of the space
  beyond the stars.</p>

  <p>It was with that strange, unclassified, unnamed sixth sense that soldiers,
  savages, and certain hunters have that Cunningham became aware of life ahead
  of him&mdash;massed, strong-breathing, ready&mdash;waiting life, spring-bent
  in the quivering blackness. A little farther, and he caught the ring of a
  curb-chain. Then a horse whinnied and a hoarse voice swore low at a restive
  charger. His own mare neighed, throwing her head high, and some one
  challenged through the dead-black night.</p>

  <p>"How-ut! Hukkums&mdash;thar!"</p>

  <p>A horseman appeared suddenly from nowhere, and examined them at close
  quarters instead of waiting for their answer. He peered curiously at
  Cunningham&mdash;glanced at Mohammed Gunga&mdash;then wheeled, spinning his
  horse as the dust eddies twist in the sudden hot-wind gusts.</p>

  <p>"Sahib-bahadur hai!" he shouted, racing back.</p>

  <p>The night was instantly alive with jingling movement, as line after line
  of quite invisible light-horse-men&mdash;self-disciplined and eager to obey
  &mdash;took up their dressing. The overhanging cliff of sandstone hid the
  moon, but here and there there was a gleam of eyeballs in the dark&mdash; now
  man's, now horse's&mdash;and a sheen that was the hint of steel held
  vertical. No human being could have guessed the length of the gorge nor the
  number of the men who waited in it, for the restless chargers stamped in
  inch-deep sand that deadened sound without seeming to lessen its
  quantity.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, bahadur!"</p>

  <p>It was Alwa, saluting with drawn saber, reining back a pedigreed mare to
  get all the spectacular emotion out of the encounter that he could.</p>

  <p>"Here are fifteen hundred eight and fifty, sahib&mdash;all Rangars
  &mdash;true believers&mdash;all true men&mdash;all pledged to see thee
  unsinged through the flames of hell! Do them the honor of a quick inspection,
  sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" smiled Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"I have told them, sahib, that their homes, their women, their
  possessions, and their honor are all guaranteed them. Also pay. They make no
  other terms."</p>

  <p>"I guarantee them all of that," said Cunningham, loud enough for at least
  the nearest ranks to hear.</p>

  <p>"On thine own honor, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"On my word of honor!"</p>

  <p>"The promise is enough! Will you inspect them, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take their salute first," said Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Pardon, bahadur!"</p>

  <p>Alwa filled his lungs and faced the unseen lines.</p>

  <p>"Rangars!" he roared. "Your leader! To Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur&mdash;son of
  Pukka-Cunnigan whom we all knew&mdash;general&mdash;salute&mdash;
  present&mdash;sabers!"</p>

  <p>There was sudden movement&mdash;the ring of whipped-out metal&mdash;a
  bird's wing-beat&mdash;as fifteen hundred hilts rose all together to as many
  lips&mdash;and a sharp intake of breath all down the line.</p>

  <p>It wasn't bad. Not bad at all, thought Cunningham. It was not done as
  regulars would have worked it. There was the little matter of the lances,
  that he could make out dimly here and there, and he could detect even in that
  gloom that half of the men had been caught wondering how to salute with lance
  and saber both. But that was not their fault; the effort&mdash;the respect
  behind the effort&mdash;the desire to act altogether&mdash;were all there and
  striving. He drew his own mare back a little, and returned their salute with
  full military dignity.</p>

  <p>"Reeeeee-turn&mdash;sabers!" ordered Alwa, and that movement was
  accomplished better.</p>

  <p>He rode once, slowly, down the long front rank, letting each man look him
  over&mdash;then back again along the rear rank, risking a kick or two, for
  there was little room between them and the cliff. He was not choking now. The
  soldier instinct, that is born in a man like statesmanship or poetry, but
  that never can be taught, had full command over all his other senses, and
  when he spurred out to the front again his voice rang loud and clear, like a
  trumpet through the night.</p>

  <p>With fifty ground scouts scattered out ahead of them, they drummed out of
  the gorge and thundered by squadrons on the plain beyond&mdash;straight, as
  the jackal runs, for Howrah City. Alwa, leaving his own squadron, to canter
  at Cunningham's side, gave him all the new intelligence that mattered.</p>

  <p>"Last evening I sent word on ahead to them of our coming, sahib! I sent
  one messenger to the Maharajah and one to Jaimihr, warning each that we ride
  to keep our plighted word. At the worst, we shall find both parties ready for
  us! We shall know before we reach the city who is our friend! News reached
  me, too, sahib, that the Maharajah and his brother have united against us
  &mdash;that Howrah will eat his promises and play me false. God send he does!
  I would like to have my hands in that Hindu's treasure-chests! We none of us
  know yet, bahadur, what is this plan of thine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've been guessing awfully close to it, I think" laughed
  Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Aha! The treasure-chests, then! But&mdash;is there&mdash;have you
  information, sahib? Who knows, then&mdash;who has told where they are?
  Neither I nor my men know!"</p>

  <p>"Send for Mohammed Gunga."</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga left his squadron, too, to canter beside Alwa.</p>

  <p>"I am all ears, sahib!" he asserted, reining his horse until his stride
  was equal to the others.</p>

  <p>"The key to the situation is that treasure," asserted Cunningham. "Howrah
  wants it. Jaimihr wants it. The priests want it. I know that much for
  certain, from the McCleans. All right. We're a new factor in the problem, and
  they all mistrust us nearly as much, if not more, than they mistrust one
  another. Good. They'll be all of them watching that treasure. It'll be near
  where they are, and I'm going to snaffle it or break my neck&mdash;and all
  your necks&mdash;in the deuced desperate attempt. Is that clear? Where the
  carcass is, there wheel the kites and there the jackals fight, as your
  proverb says. The easiest part will be finding the treasure. Then
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>They legged in closer to him, hanging on his words and too busy listening
  to speak.</p>

  <p>"If Howrah thinks we're after the treasure and decides to fight without
  previous argument, that absolves you from your promise, doesn't it, Alwa-
  sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, sahib, provided our intention is not to evade the promise."</p>

  <p>"Our intention is to prevent Howrah and his brother from fighting, to
  insure peace and protection on this whole countryside, and, if possible, to
  ride away with Jaimihr's army to the Company's aid."</p>

  <p>"Good, sahib."</p>

  <p>It seemed to occur to none of the three that fifteen hundred mounted men
  were somewhat few with which to accomplish such a marvel.</p>

  <p>"If they are fighting already, we must interfere."</p>

  <p>"We are ready, bahadur. Fighting is our trade!"</p>

  <p>"But, before all things, we must keep our eyes well skinned for a hint of
  treachery on Jaimihr's part. I would rather quarrel with that gentleman than
  be his friend, but he happens to hold our promise. We've got to keep our
  promise, provided he keeps his. I think our first objective is the
  treasure."</p>

  <p>"That, sahib, is an acrobat of a plan," said Alwa; "much jumping from one
  proposition to another!"</p>

  <p>"It is no plan at all," said Cunningham. "It is a mere rehearsal of the
  circumstances. A plan is something quickly seized at the right second and
  then acted on&mdash;like your capture of Jaimihr. Wait awhile,
  Alwa-sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, wait awhile!" growled Mohammed Gunga. "Did I bring thee a leader to
  ask plans of thee, or a man of men for thee to follow? Which?"</p>

  <p>"All the same," said Alwa, "I would rather halt and make a good plan. It
  would be wiser. I do not understand this one."</p>

  <p>"I follow Cunnigan-bahadur!" said Mohammed Gunga; and he spurred off to
  his squadron. Alwa could see nothing better than to follow suit, for
  Cunningham closed his lips tight in a manner unmistakable. And whatever
  Alwa's misgivings might have been, he had the sense and the soldierly
  determination not to hint at them to his men.</p>

  <p>As dawn rose pale-yellow in the eastern sky they thundered into view of
  Howrah City and drew rein to breathe their horses. The sun was high before
  they had trotted near enough to make out details. But, long before details
  could be seen, it was evident that an army was formed up to meet them on the
  tree-lined maidan that lay between them and the two-mile-long palace-wall.
  Beyond all doubt it was Jaimihr's army, for his elephants were not so gaudily
  harnessed as Howrah's, and his men were not so brilliantly dressed.</p>

  <p>As they dipped into the last depression between them and the wall and
  halted for a minute's consultation, a khaki-clad, shriveled figure of a man
  leaped up from behind a sand-ridge, and raced toward Cunningham, shouting to
  him in a dialect he had no knowledge of and gesticulating wildly. A trooper
  spurred down on him, brought him up all standing with an intercepted lance,
  examined him through puckered eyes, and then, roaring with laughter, picked
  him up and carried him to Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"A woman, sahib! By the beard of Abraham, a woman!"</p>

  <p>"Joanna!"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib! Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>She babbled to him, word overtaking word and choking all together in a
  dust-dry throat. Cunningham gave her water and then set her on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Translate, somebody!" he ordered. "I can't understand a word she
  says."</p>

  <p>Babbled and hurried and a little vague it might be, but Joanna had the
  news of the minute pat.</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr is looting the treasure now, sahib. He has tricked his brother.
  They were to join, and both fight against you, but Jaimihr tried to get the
  treasure out before either you or his brother came. He is trying now,
  sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Miss McClean! Ask her where Miss McClean is! Ask for Miss Maklin,
  sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Jaimihr has told her that thou and Alwa and Mohammed Gunga are all dead,
  and the British overwhelmed throughout all India! He has her with him in a
  carriage, under guard, for all his men are with him and he could spare no
  great guard for his palace. See! Look, sahib! Jaimihr's palace is in
  flames!"</p>

  <p>Alwa all but fell from his charger, laughing volcanically. The Rajput, who
  never can agree, can always see the humor in other Rajputs' disagreement.</p>

  <p>"Ho, but they are playing a great game with each other!" he shouted. But
  Cunningham decided he had wasted time enough. He shouted his orders, and in
  less than thirty seconds his three squadrons were thundering in the direction
  of Jaimihr's army and the palace-wall. They drew rein again within a quarter
  of a mile of it, to discover with amazed military eyes that Jaimihr had no
  artillery.</p>

  <p>It was then, at the moment when they halted, that Jaimihr reached a quick
  decision and the wrong one. He knew by now that his brother had won the first
  trick in the game of treachery, for he could see the smoke and flames of his
  burning palace from where he sat his horse. He decided at once that Alwa and
  his Rangars must have taken sides with the Maharajah, for how, otherwise, he
  reasoned, could the Maharajah dare let the Rangars approach unwatched and
  unmolested. It was evident to him that the Rangars were acting as part of a
  concerted movement.</p>

  <p>He made up his mind to attack and beat off the new arrivals without
  further ceremony. He out-numbered them by four or five to one, and was on his
  own ground. Whatever their intentions, at least he would be able to pretend
  afterwards that he had acted in defence of the sacred treasure; and then,
  with the treasure in his possession, he would soon be able to recompense
  himself for a mere burned and looted palace!</p>

  <p>So he opened fire without notice, argument, or parley, and an ill-aimed
  volley shrieked over the heads of Cunningham's three squadrons.</p>

  <p>Cunningham, unruffled and undecided still, made out through puckered eyes
  the six-horse carriage in which Miss McClean evidently was; it was drawn up
  close beside the wall, and two regiments were between it and his squadron. He
  was recalling the terms of the agreement made with Jaimihr; he remembered it
  included the sparing of all of Alwa's men, and not the firing on them.</p>

  <p>A thousand of Jaimihr's cavalry swooped from the shelter of the infantry,
  opened out a very little, and, mistaking Cunningham's delay for fear, bore
  down with a cheer and something very like determination.</p>

  <p>They were met some ten yards their side of the half-way mark by
  Cunningham's three squadrons, loosed and led by Cunningham himself.
  Outridden, outfought, outgeneraled, they were smashed through, ridden down,
  and whirled back reeling in confusion. About a hundred of them reached the
  shelter of the infantry in a formed-up body; many of the rest charged through
  it in a mob and threw it into confusion.</p>

  <p>Too late Jaimihr decided on more reasonable tactics. Too late he gave
  orders to his infantry that no such confused body could obey. Before he could
  ride to rally them, the Rangars were in them, at them, through them, over
  them. The whole was disintegrating in retreat, endeavoring to rally and
  reform in different places, each subdivision shouting orders to its nearest
  neighbor and losing heart as its appeals for help were disregarded.</p>

  <p>Back came Cunningham's close-formed squadrons, straight through the
  writhing mass again; and now the whole of Jaimihr's army took to its heels,
  just as part of the five-feet-thick stone palace-wall succumbed to the
  attacks of crowbars and crashed down in the roadway, disclosing a dark vault
  on the other side.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr made a rush for the six-horse carriage, and tried vainly to get it
  started. Cunningham shouted to him to surrender, but he took no notice of the
  challenge; he escaped being made prisoner by the narrowest of margins, as the
  postillion next him was cut down. The other postillions were unhorsed, and
  six Rangars changed mounts and seized the reins. The Prince ran one man
  through the middle, and then spurred off to try and overtake his routed army,
  some of which showed a disposition to form up again.</p>

  <p>"Sit quiet!" called Cunningham through the latticed carriage window.
  "You're safe!"</p>

  <p>The heavy, swaying carriage rumbled round, and the horses plunged in
  answer to the Rangars' heels. A moment later it was moving at a gallop; two
  minutes later it was backed against the wall, and Rosemary McClean stepped
  out behind three protecting squadrons that had not suffered perceptibly from
  what they would have scorned to call a battle.</p>

  <p>"Now all together!" shouted Cunningham, whose theories on the value of
  seconds when tackling reforming infantry were worthy of the Duke of
  Wellington, or any other officer who knew his business; and again he led his
  men at a breakneck charge. This time Jaimihr's disheartened little army did
  not wait for him, but broke into wild confusion and scattered right and left,
  leaving their elephants to be captured. There were only a few men killed. The
  lance-tipped, roaring whirlwind loosed itself for the most part against
  nothing, and reformed uninjured to trot back again. Cunningham told off two
  troops to pursue fugitives and keep their eyes open for the Prince before he
  rode back to examine the breach in the wall that Jaimihr had been to so much
  trouble about making.</p>

  <p>He had halted to peer through the break in the age-old masonry when
  Mohammed Gunga spurred up close to him, touched his arm, and pointed.</p>

  <p>"Look, sahib! Look!"</p>

  <p>Jaimihr&mdash;and no one but a wizard could have told how he had managed
  to get to where he was unobserved&mdash;was riding as a man rides at a
  tent-peg, crouching low, full-pelt for Rosemary McClean!</p>

  <p>Cunningham's spurs went home before the word was out of Mohammed Gunga's
  mouth, and Mohammed Gunga raced behind him; but Jaimihr had the start of
  them. Duncan McClean, looking ill and weak and helpless, crowded his daughter
  to the wall, standing between her and the Prince; but Jaimihr aimed a
  swinging saber at him, and the missionary fell. His daughter stooped to bend
  over him, and Jaimihr seized her below the arms. A second later he had
  hoisted her to his saddle-bow and was spurring hell-bent-for-leather for the
  open country.</p>

  <p>Two things prevented him from making his escape. Five of Alwa's men,
  returning from pursuing fugitives, cut off his flight in one direction, and
  the extra weight on his horse prevented him from getting clear by means of
  speed alone&mdash;as he might have done otherwise, for Cunningham's mare was
  growing tired.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr rode for two minutes with the frenzy of a savage before he saw the
  futility of it. It was Cunningham's mare, gaining on him stride over stride,
  that warned him he would be cut down like a dog from behind unless he
  surrendered or let go his prize.</p>

  <p>So he laughed and threw the girl to the ground. For a moment more he
  spurted, spurring like a fiend, then wheeled and charged at Cunningham. He
  guessed that but for Cunningham that number of Rangars would never have
  agreed on a given plan. He knew that it was he, and not Cunningham or Alwa or
  Rosemary McClean, who had broken faith. He had broken it in thought, and
  word, and action. And he had lost his prospect of a throne. So he came on
  like a man who has nothing to gain by considering his safety. He came like a
  real man at last. And Cunningham, on a tired mare, met him point to
  point.</p>

  <p>They fought over a quarter of a mile of ground, for Jaimihr proved to be
  as useful with his weapon as Mohammed Gunga's teaching had made Cunningham.
  There was plenty of time for the reformed squadrons to see what was happening
  &mdash;plenty of time for Alwa, who considered that he had an account of his
  own to settle with the Prince, to leave his squadron and come thundering up
  to help. Mohammed Gunga dodged and reined and spurred, watching his
  opportunity on one side and Alwa on the other. It would have suited neither
  of them to have their leader killed at that stage of the game, but the
  fighting was too quick for either man to interfere.</p>

  <p>Jaimihr charged Cunningham for the dozenth time and missed, charged past,
  to wheel and charge again, then closed with the most vindictive rush of all.
  Again Cunningham met him point to point. The two blades locked, and bent like
  springs as they wrenched at them. Cunningham's blade snapped. He snatched at
  his mare and spun her before Jaimihr could recover, then rammed both spurs in
  and bore down on the Prince with half a saber. He had him on the near side at
  a disadvantage. Jaimihr spurred and tried to maneuver for position, and the
  half saber went home just below his ribs. He dropped bleeding in the dust at
  the second that Alwa and Mohammed Gunga each saw an opportunity and rushed
  in, to rein back face to face, grinning in each other's faces, their horses'
  breasts pressed tight against the charger that Jaimihr rode. The horse
  screamed as the shock crushed the wind out of him.</p>

  <p>"You robbed me of my man, sahib, by about a saber's breadth!" laughed
  Alwa.</p>

  <p>"And you left your squadron leaderless without my permission!" answered
  Cunningham. "You too! Mohammed Gunga!"</p>

  <p>"But, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Do you prefer to argue or obey?"</p>

  <p>Mohammed Gunga flushed and rode back. Alwa grinned and started after him.
  Cunningham, without another glance at the dead Prince, rode up to Rosemary
  McClean, who was picking herself up and looking bewildered; she had watched
  the duel in speechless silence, lying full length in the dust, and she still
  could not speak when he reached her.</p>

  <p>"Put your foot on mine," he said reassuringly; "then swing yourself up
  behind me if you can. If you can't, I'll pick you up in front."</p>

  <p>She tried hard, but she failed; so he put both arms under hers and lifted
  her.</p>

  <p>"Am I welcome?" he asked. And she nodded.</p>

  <p>Fresh from killing a man&mdash;with a man's blood on his broken sword and
  the sweat of fighting not yet dry on him&mdash;he held a woman in his arms
  for the first time in his life. His hand had been steady when it struck the
  blow under Jaimihr's ribs, but now it trembled. His eyes had been stern and
  blazing less than two minutes before; now they looked down into nothing more
  dangerous than a woman's eyes and grew strangely softer all at once. His
  mouth had been a hard, tight line under a scrubby upper lip, but his lips had
  parted now a little and his smile was a boy's&mdash;not nervous or
  mischievous&mdash;a happy boy's.</p>

  <p>She smiled, too. Most people did smile when young Cunningham looked
  pleased with them; but she smiled differently. And he, with that blood still
  wet on him, bent down and kissed her on the lips. Her answer was as
  characteristic as his action.</p>

  <p>"You look like a blackguard," she said&mdash;"but you came, and I knew you
  would! I told Jaimihr you would, and he laughed at me. I told God you would,
  and you came! How long is it since you shaved? Your chin is all prickly!"</p>

  <p>They were interrupted by a roar from the three waiting squadrons. He had
  ridden without caring where he went, and his mare had borne the two of them
  to where the squadrons were drawn up with their rear to the great gap in the
  wall. The situation suited every Rangar of them! That was, indeed, the way a
  man should win his woman! They cheered him, and cheered again, and he grinned
  back, knowing that their hearts were in the cheering and their good will won.
  Red, then, as a boiled beet, he rode over to the six-horse carriage and
  dismounted by her father&mdash;picked him up&mdash;called two troopers
  &mdash;and lifted him on to the rear seat of the great old-fashioned
  coach.</p>

  <p>"Get inside beside him!" he ordered Rosemary, examining the missionary's
  head as he spoke. "It's a scalp wound, and he's stunned&mdash;no more. He's
  left off bleeding already. Nurse him!" He was off, then, without another word
  or a backward glance for her&mdash;off to his men and the gap in the wall
  that waited an investigation.</p>

  <p>The amazing was discovered then. The treasure&mdash;the fabled, fabulous,
  enormous Howrah treasure was no fable. It was there, behind that wall! The
  jewels and the bullion in marketable bars that could have bought an army or a
  kingdom&mdash;the sacred, secret treasure of twenty troubled generations,
  that was guarded in the front by fifty doors and fifty corridors and three
  times fifty locks&mdash;the door of whose secret vault was guarded by a
  cannon, set to explode at the slightest touch&mdash;was hidden from the
  public road at its other side, its rear, by nothing better than a five-foot
  wall of ill-cemented stone! Cunningham stepped inside over the dismantled
  masonry and sat down on a chest that held more money's worth than all the
  Cunninghams in all the world had ever owned, or spent, or owed, or used, or
  dreamed of!</p>

  <p>"Ask Alwa and Mohammed Gunga to come to me here!" he called; and a minute
  later they stood at attention in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Send a hundred men, each with a flag of truce on his lance, to gallop
  through the city and call on Jaimihr's men to rally to me, if they wish
  protection against Howrah!"</p>

  <p>"Good, sahib! Good!" swore Alwa. "Howrah is the next danger! Make ready to
  fight Howrah!"</p>

  <p>"Attend to my orders, please!" smiled Cunningham, and Alwa did as he was
  told. Within an hour Jaimihr's men were streaming from the four quarters of
  the compass, hurrying to be on the winning side, and forming into companies
  as they were ordered.</p>

  <p>Then Cunningham gave another order.</p>

  <p>"Alwa-sahib, will you take another flag of truce, please, and ride with
  not more than two men to Maharajah Howrah. Tell him that I want him here at
  once to settle about this treasure."</p>

  <p>Alwa stared. His mouth opened a little, and he stood like a man bereft of
  reason by the unexpected.</p>

  <p>"Are you not still pledged to support Howrah on his throne?"</p>

  <p>"I am, bahadur."</p>

  <p>"Would plundering his treasure be in keeping with your promise to
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be good enough to take my message to him. Assure him that he may come
  with ten men without fear of molestation, but guarantee to him that if he
  comes with more than ten&mdash;and with however many more&mdash;I will fight,
  and keep his treasure, both!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33">CHAPTER 33</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Friends I have sought me of varying nations,<br>
  Men of all ranks and of different stations;<br>
  Some are in jail now, and some are deceased.<br>
  Two, though, I found to be experts at sundering<br>
  Me from my revenue, leaving me wondering<br>
  Which was the costlier&mdash;soldier or priest.</p><br>

  <p class="first">A LITTLE more than one hour later, Howrah&mdash;sulky and
  disgruntled, but doing his level best to appear at ease&mdash;faced young
  Cunningham across a table in the treasure-vault. Outside was a row of wagons,
  drawn by horses and closely guarded by a squadron of the Rangars. Behind
  Cunningham stood Alwa and Mohammed Gunga; behind the Maharajah were two of
  his court officials. There were pen and ink and the royal seal between them
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"So, Maharajah-sahib. They are all scaled, and each chest is marked on the
  outside with its contents; I'm sorry there was no time to weigh the gold, but
  the number of the ingots ought to be enough. And, of course, you'll
  understand it wasn't possible to count all those unset stones&mdash;that 'ud
  take a week; but your seal is on that big chest, too, so you'll know if it's
  been opened. You are certain you can preserve the peace of your state with
  the army you have?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Howrah curtly.</p>

  <p>"Don't want me to leave a squadron of my men to help you out?"</p>

  <p>"No!" He said that even more abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Good. Of course, since you won't have to spare men to guard the treasure
  now, you'll have all the more to keep peace in the district with, won't you?
  Let me repeat the terms of our bargain&mdash;they're written here, but let's
  be sure there is no mistake. I agree to deliver your treasure into safe
  keeping until the rebellion is over, and to report to my government that you
  are friendly disposed toward us. You, in return, guarantee to protect the
  families and property of all these gentlemen who ride with me. It is mutually
  agreed that any damage done to their homes during their absence shall be made
  good out of your treasure, but that should you keep your part of the
  agreement the treasure shall be handed back to you intact. Is that
  correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Howrah shifting in his seat uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>"One other thing. I am outmaneuvered, and I have surrendered with the best
  grace possible. That agreement stands in my name, and no other man's?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"The priests of Siva are not parties to it?"</p>

  <p>"I've had nothing whatever to do with them," said Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"That is all, then, sahib. I am satisfied."</p>

  <p>"While we're about it, Maharajah-sahib, let's scotch those priests
  altogether! McClean-sahib has told me that suttee has been practiced here as
  a regular thing. That's got to stop, and we may as well stop it now. Of
  course, I shall keep my word about the treasure, and you'll get it back if
  you live up to the bargain you have made; but my government will know now
  where it is, and they'll be likely to impose a quite considerable fine on you
  when the rebellion's over unless this suttee's put an end to. Besides, you
  couldn't think of a better way of scoring off the priests than by enforcing
  the law and abolishing the practice. Think that over, Maharajah-sahib."</p>

  <p>Howrah swore into his beard, as any ruling potentate might well do at
  being dictated to by a boy of twenty-two.</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, sahib," he answered. "I am with the British&mdash; not
  against them."</p>

  <p>"Good for you!&mdash;er, I mean, that's right!" He turned to Alwa, and
  looked straight into his eyes. "Are you satisfied with the guarantee?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I am more than satisfied!"</p>

  <p>"Good! Oh, and&mdash;Maharajah-sahib&mdash;since we've fought your battle
  for you&mdash;and lost a few men&mdash;and are going to guard your treasure
  for you, and be your friends, and all that kind of thing&mdash; don't you
  think you'd like to do something for us&mdash;not much, but just a little
  thing?"</p>

  <p>"I am in your power. You have but to command."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. I don't want to force anything. We're friends&mdash;talking as
  friends. I ask a favor."</p>

  <p>"It is granted, sahib."</p>

  <p>"A horse or two, that's all."</p>

  <p>"How many horses, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not more than one each."</p>

  <p>The Maharajah pulled a wry face, but bowed assent. It would empty his
  stables very nearly, but he knew when he could not help himself. Mohammed
  Gunga clapped a hand to his mouth and left the vault hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"You understand this is not a demand, Maharajah-sahib. I take it that you
  offer me these horses as an act of royal courtesy and as additional proof of
  friendliness?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, sahib."</p>

  <p>"My men will be very grateful to you. This will enable them to reach the
  scene of action with their own horses in good shape. I'm sure it's awfully
  good of you to have offered them!"</p>

  <p>Outside, where the late afternoon sun was gradually letting things cool
  down, Mohammed Gunga leaned against the wall and roared with laughter, as he
  explained a few details to the admiring troopers.</p>

  <p>"A horse or two, says he! How many? Oh, just a horse or two, Maharajah-
  sahib&mdash;merely a horse apiece! Fifteen hundred horses! A horse or two!
  Oh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho! Allah! But that boy will make a better soldier than his
  father! As a favor, he asked them&mdash;no compulsion, mind you&mdash; just
  as a favor! Allah! What is he asking now, I wonder!
  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho-ho-ho!"</p>

  <p>And inside, with a perfectly straight face and almost ghastly generosity,
  young Cunningham proceeded to impose on Howrah the transferred, unwelcome,
  perilous allegiance of Jaimihr's reassembling army. The mere keeping of it in
  subjection, it was realized by donor and recipient alike, would keep the
  Maharajah's hands full.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied that your homes will be safe, now?" he asked Alwa. And
  Alwa looked him in the eyes and grinned.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34">CHAPTER 34</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">Now, fifteen hundred, horse and man,<br>
  Reel at the word of one!<br>
  Loosed by the brazen trumpet's peal&mdash;<br>
  Knee to knee and toe on heel&mdash;<br>
  Troop on troop the squadrons wheel<br>
  Outbrazening the sun!</p><br>

  <p class="first">WITHIN a fortnight of the outbreak of the mutiny, men spoke
  with bated breath about the Act of God. It burst at the moment when India's
  reins were in the hands of some of the worst incompetents in history. A week
  found strong men in control of things&mdash;the right men, with the right
  handful behind them.</p>

  <p>Some of the men in charge went mad, and were relieved. Some threw up their
  commands. Some of the worst incompetents were killed by the mutineers, and
  more than one man who could have changed the course of history for the worse
  were taken sick and died. Instead of finding themselves faced by spineless
  nincompoops, the rebels reeled before the sudden, well-timed tactics of real
  officers with eyes and ears and brains. The mask was off on both sides, and
  the sudden, stripped efficiency of one was no less disconcerting than the
  unexpected rebellion of the other.</p>

  <p>Byng-bahadur&mdash;"Byng the Brigadier"&mdash;was in command of a force
  again within three days of the news of the first massacre; and because he was
  Byng, with Byng's record, and Byng's ability to handle loyal natives, the men
  who succeeded to the reins packed him off at once with a free hand, and with
  no other orders than to hit, hit hard, and keep on hitting.</p>

  <p>"Go for them, Byng, old man. Live off the country, keep moving, and don't
  let 'em guess once what your next move's going to be!"</p>

  <p>So Byng recruited as he went, and struck like a brain-controlled tornado
  at whatever crossed his path. But irreparable damage had been done before the
  old school was relieved, and Byng&mdash;like others&mdash;was terribly short
  of men. Many of his own irregulars were so enraged at having been disbanded
  at a moment's notice that they refused to return to him. Their honor, as they
  saw it, had been outraged. Only two British regiments could be spared him,
  and they were both thinned by sickness from the first. They were Sikhs, who
  formed the bulk of his headquarterless brigade, and many of them were
  last-minute friends, who came to him unorganized and almost utterly
  undrilled.</p>

  <p>But Byng was a man of genius, and his bare reputation was enough to offset
  much in the way of unpreparedness. He coaxed and licked and praised his new
  men into shape as he went along; within a week he had stormed Deeseera,
  blowing up their greatest reserve of ammunition and momentarily stunning the
  rebellion's leaders. But cholera took charge in the city, and two days later
  found him hurrying out again, to camp where there was uncontaminated water,
  on rising ground that gave him the command of three main roads. It was there
  that the rebels cornered him.</p>

  <p>They blew up a hundred-yard-long bridge behind him at the one point where
  a swiftly running river could be crossed, and from two other sides at once
  mutinied native regiments and thousands from the countryside flocked,
  hurrying to take a hand in what seemed destined to be Byng's last action. The
  fact that so many swaggering soldier Sikhs were cornered with him was
  sufficient in itself to bring out Hindu and Mohammedan alike.</p>

  <p>The mutinous regiments had all been drilled and taught by British officers
  until they were as nearly perfect as the military knowledge of the day could
  make them; the fact that they had killed their officers only served to make
  them savage without detracting much from their efficiency. They had native
  officers quite capable of taking charge, and sense enough to retain their
  discipline.</p>

  <p>So Byng entrenched himself on the gradual rise, and sent out as many
  messengers as he could spare to bring reinforcements from whatever source
  obtainable. Then, when almost none came, he got ready to die where he stood,
  using all the soldier gift he had to put courage into the last-ditch
  loyalists who offered to die with him. He had counted most on aid from
  Cunningham and Mohammed Gunga, but that source seemed to have failed him; and
  he gave up hope of their arrival when a body of several thousand rebels took
  up position on his flank and cut off approach from the direction whence
  Cunningham should come.</p>

  <p>The sun blazed down like molten hell on sick and wounded. Rotting
  carcasses of horses and cattle, killed by the rebels' artillery-fire, lay
  stenching here and there, and there was no possibility of disposing of them.
  A day came very soon, indeed, when horse, or occasional transport bullock,
  was all there was to eat, and a night came when Govind Singh, the leader of
  the Sikhs, came to him and remonstrated.</p>

  <p>The old man had to be carried to Byng's tent, for a round shot had
  disabled him, and he had himself set down by the tent-door, where the General
  sat on a camp-stool.</p>

  <p>"General-sahib, I have not been asked for advice; I am here to offer
  it."</p>

  <p>The huge black dome of heaven was punctuated by a billion dots of steely
  white that looked like pin-pricks. All the light there was came from the
  fitful watch-fires, where even the wagons were being burned now that the
  meager supply of rough timber was giving out. The rebels, too, were burning
  everything on which they could lay their hands, and from between the
  spaced-out glow of their bonfires came ever and again the spurt of
  cannon-flame.</p>

  <p>"Speak, Govind Singh!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, we have no artillery with which to answer them. We have no food;
  and the supply of ammunition wanes. Shall we die here like cattle in a
  slaughter-house?"</p>

  <p>"This is as good as any other place" said Byng.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib!" "How, then?"</p>

  <p>"In their lines is a better place! Here is nothing better than a shambles,
  with none but our men falling. They know that our food is giving out&mdash;
  they know that we lose heavily&mdash;they wait. They will wait for days yet
  before they close in to finish what their guns have but begun, and&mdash;
  then&mdash;how many will there be to die desperately, as is fitting?"</p>

  <p>"We might get reinforcements in the morning, Govind Singh."</p>

  <p>"And again, we might not, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"I sent a number of messengers before we were shut in."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib&mdash;and to whom? To men who would ask you to reinforce them
  if they could get word to you! Tomorrow our rear will be surrounded, too;
  they have laid planks across the little streams behind us, and are preparing
  to drag guns to that side, too. Now, sahib, we have fire left in us. We can
  smite yet, and do damage while we die. Tomorrow night may find us decimated
  and without heart for the finish. I advise you to advance at dawn,
  sahib!"</p>

  <p>That advice came as a great relief to Byng-bahadur. He had been the first
  to see the hopelessness of the position, and every instinct that he had told
  him to finish matters, not in the last reeking ditch, but ahead, where the
  enemy would suffer fearfully while a desperate charge roared into them, to
  peter out when the last man went down fighting. Surrender was unthinkable,
  and in any event would have been no good, for the mutineers would be sure to
  butcher all their prisoners; his only other chance had been to hold out until
  relief came, and that hope was now forlorn.</p>

  <p>A Mohammedan stepped out of blackness and saluted him&mdash;a native
  officer, in charge of a handful of irregular cavalry, whose horses had all
  been shot.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>"This, sahib. Do we die here? I and my men would prefer to die yonder,
  where a mutineer or two would pay the price!"</p>

  <p>A Gurkha officer&mdash;small as a Japanese and sturdy-looking came up
  next. The whole thing was evidently preconcerted.</p>

  <p>"My men ask leave to show the way into the ranks ahead, General-sahib!
  They are overweary of this shambles!"</p>

  <p>"We will advance at dawn!" said Byng. "Egan&mdash;" He turned to a British
  officer, who was very nearly all the staff he had. "Drag that table up. Let's
  have some paper here and a pencil, and we'll work out the best plan
  possible."</p>

  <p>He sent for the commanding officers of the British regiments&mdash;both of
  them captains, but the seniors surviving&mdash;and a weird scene followed
  round the lamp set on the tiny table. British, Sikh, Mohammedan, and Gurkha
  clustered close to him, and watched as his pencil traced the different
  positions and showed the movement that was to make the morrow's finish, their
  faces outlined in the lamp's yellow glow and their breath coming deep and
  slow as they agreed on how the greatest damage could be done the enemy before
  the last man died.</p>

  <p>As he finished, and assigned each leader to his share in the last assault
  that any one of them would take a part in, a streak of light blazed suddenly
  across the sky. A shooting-star swept in a wide parabola to the horizon. A
  murmur went up from the wakeful lines, and the silence of the graveyard
  followed.</p>

  <p>"There is our sign, sahib!" laughed the Mohammedan. The old Sikh nodded
  and the Gurkha grinned. "It is the end!" he said, without a trace of
  discouragement.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Byng, his face, too, turned upward.</p>

  <p>"What, then, does it mean, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;it means that God Almighty has relieved a picket! We're the
  picket. We're relieved! We advance at dawn, and we'll get through somehow!
  Join your commands, gentlemen, and explain the details carefully to your men
  &mdash;let's have no misunderstandings."</p>

  <p>The dawn rose gold and beautiful upon a sleepless camp that reeked and
  steamed with hell-hot suffering. It showed the rebels stationary, still in
  swarming lines, but scouts reported several thousand of them moving in a body
  from the flank toward the British rear.</p>

  <p>"What proportion of the rebel force?" asked Byng. "New arrivals, or some
  of the old ones taking up a new position?"</p>

  <p>"The same crowd, sir. They're just moving round to hem us in
  completely."</p>

  <p>"So much the better for us, then! That leaves fewer for us to deal with in
  front."</p>

  <p>As he spoke another man came running to report the arrival of five
  gallopers, coming hell-bent-for leather, one by one and scattered, with the
  evident purpose of allowing one man to get through, whatever happened.</p>

  <p>"That'll be relief at last!" said Byng-bahadur. And, instead of ordering
  the advance immediately, he waited, scouring the sky-line with his
  glasses.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;dust&mdash;lance-heads&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash; three
  divisions, coming in a hurry."</p>

  <p>Being on rising ground, he saw the distant relieving force much sooner
  than the rebels did, and he knew that it was help for him on the way some
  time before the first of the five gallopers careered into the camp, and
  shouted:</p>

  <p>"Cunnigan-bahadur comes with fifteen hundred!"</p>

  <p>"Fifteen hundred," muttered Byng. "That merely serves to postpone the
  finish by an hour or two!"</p>

  <p>But he waited; and presently the rebel scouts brought word, and their
  leaders, too, became aware of reinforcements on the way for somebody. They
  made the mistake, though, of refusing to believe that any help could be
  coming for the British, and by the time that messengers had hurried from the
  direction of the British rear, to tell of gallopers who had ridden past them
  and been swallowed by the shouting British lines, three squadrons on fresh
  horses were close enough to be reckoned dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Is that a gun they've got with them?" wondered Byng. "By the lord Harry,
  no,&mdash;it's a coach and six! They're flogging it along like a twelve-
  pounder! And what the devil's in those wagons?"</p>

  <p>But he had no time for guesswork. The desultory thunder of the rebel
  ordnance ceased, and the whole mass that hemmed him in began to revolve
  within itself, and present a new front to the approaching cavalry.</p>

  <p>"Caught on the hop, by God! The whole line will advance! Trumpeter!"</p>

  <p>One trumpet-call blared out and a dozen echoed it. In a second more a roar
  went up that is only heard on battle-fields. It has none of the exultant
  shout of joy or of the rage that a mob throws up to heaven; it is not even
  anger, as the cities know it, or the men who riot for advantage. It is a
  welcome ironically offered up to Death&mdash;full-throated, and more
  freighted with moral effect on an enemy than a dozen salvoes of
  artillery.</p>

  <p>The thousands ahead tried hard to turn again and face two attacks at once;
  but, though the units were efficiently controlled, there were none who could
  swing the whole. Byng's decimated, forward-rushing fragment of a mixed
  brigade, tight-reined and working like a piece of mechanism, struck home into
  a mass of men who writhed, and fell away, and shouted to each other. A third
  of them was out of reach, beyond the British rear; fully another third was
  camped too far away to bring assistance at the first wild onslaught.
  Messengers were sent to bring them up, but the messengers were overtaken by a
  horde who ran.</p>

  <p>Then, like arrows driven by the bows of death, three squadrons took them
  on the flank as Cunningham changed direction suddenly and loosed his full
  weight at the guns. Instead of standing and serving grape, the rebel gunners
  tried to get their ordnance away&mdash;facing about again too late, when the
  squadrons were almost on them. Then they died gamely, when gameness served no
  further purpose. The Rangars rode them down and butchered them, capturing
  every single gun, and leaving them while they charged again at the rallying
  hordes ahead.</p>

  <p>The strange assortment of horsed wagons and the lumbering six-horse coach
  took full advantage of the momentary confusion to make at a gallop for the
  British rear, where they drew up in line behind the Sikhs, who were volleying
  at short range in the center.</p>

  <p>Byng detached two companies of British soldiers to do their amateur
  damnedest with the guns, and, for infantry, they did good service with them;
  fifteen or twenty minutes after the first onslaught the enemy was writhing
  under the withering attention of his own abandoned ordnance. But the odds
  were still tremendous, and the weight of numbers made the ultimate outcome of
  the battle seem a foregone conclusion.</p>

  <p>From the British rear heads appeared above the rising ground; the deserted
  camp was rushed and set alight. The tents blazed like a beacon light, and a
  moment later the Gurkhas retaliated by setting fire to such of the rebel camp
  as had fallen into British hands.</p>

  <p>It was those two fires that saved the day. From the sky-line to the rebel
  rear came the thunder of a salvo of artillery. It was the short bark of
  twelve-pounders loaded up with blank&mdash;a signal&mdash;and the rebels did
  not wait to see whether this was friend or foe. Help from one unexpected
  source had reached the British; this, they argued, was probably another
  column moving to the relief, and they drew off in reasonably decent order
  &mdash;harried, pestered, stung, as they attempted to recover camp-equipment
  or get away with stores and wagons, by Cunningham, Alwa, and Mohammed
  Gunga.</p>

  <p>In another hour the rebel army was a black swarm spreading on the eastern
  sky-line, and on the far horizon to the north there shone the glint of
  bayonets and helmet spikes, the dancing gleam of lance-tips, and the dazzle
  from the long, polished bodies of a dozen guns. A galloper spurred up with a
  message for Byng.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You are to join my command," it ran, "for a raid in force
  on Howrah, where the rebels are supposed to have been concentrating for
  months past. The idea is to paralyze the vita of the movement before
  concentrating somewhere on the road to Delhi, where the rebels are sure to
  make a most determined stand."</p>

  <p>As he read it Mohammed Gunga galloped up to him, grinning like a boy.</p>

  <p>"Cunnigan-sahib's respects, General-sahib! He asks leave to call his men
  off, saying that he has done all the damage possible with only fifteen
  hundred."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Call 'em off and send Cunningham to me. How did he shape?"</p>

  <p>"Like a son of Cunnigan-bahadur! General-sahib-salaam!"</p>

  <p>"No. Here, you old ruffian&mdash;shake hands, will you? Now send
  Cunningham to me."</p>

  <p>Cunningham came up fifteen minutes later, with a Rangar orderly behind
  him, and did his best to salute as though it were nothing more than an
  ordinary meeting.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Here you are. 'Gratulate you, Cunningham! You came in the nick of
  time. What kept you?"</p>

  <p>"That 'ud take a long time to tell, sir. I've fifteen hundred horses about
  ten miles from here, sir, left in charge of native levies, and I'd like
  permission to go and fetch them before the levies make off with them."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! Yes, you'd better go for them. What's in the wagons."</p>

  <p>"The Howrah treasure, sir!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"The whole of the Howrah treasure, sir! It's held as security. Howrah
  guarantees to keep the peace and protect the homes of my men. I guaranteed to
  hand him back the treasure when the show's over, less deductions for damage
  done!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm&mdash;Who thought of that? You or Mohammed Gunga?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I expect we cooked it up between us, sir."</p>

  <p>"H-rrrr-umph! And what's in the six-horse coach?"</p>

  <p>"A lady and her father."</p>

  <p>"The deuce they are!"</p>

  <p>Byng rode up to the lumbering vehicle, signing to Cunningham to follow
  him.</p>

  <p>"General Byng," said Cunningham. "Miss McClean, sir."</p>

  <p>A very much disheveled and very weary-looking young woman with a wealth of
  chestnut hair leaned through the window and smiled, not at the General but at
  Cunningham. Byng stared&mdash;looked from one to the other of them&mdash; and
  said "Hu-rrrr-umph!" again.</p>

  <p>"It was she who made the whole thing possible, sir."</p>

  <p>"The very deuce it was!" It began to be evident that Byng was not a
  ladies' man!</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. McClean, sir&mdash;Rosemary's father. He helped her put the
  whole scheme through."</p>

  <p>Byng nodded to the missionary and looked back at Rosemary McClean&mdash;
  then from her to Cunningham again.</p>

  <p>"Hu-rrrr-umph! Christian names already! More 'gratulations, eh?"</p>

  <p>Rosemary's head and shoulders disappeared and Cunningham looked
  foolish.</p>

  <p>"Well! Send Mohammed Gunga for the horses. Ride over there to where you
  see General Evans's column and tell him the whole story. Take a small escort
  and the treasure with you. And&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;lemme see &mdash;take
  this carriage, too. Oh, by the bye&mdash;you'd better ask General Evans to
  make some arrangements for Miss McClean. Leave her over there with the
  treasure. I want you back with my brigade, and I want you to be some sort of
  use. Can't have love-making with the brigade, Mr. Cunningham!"</p>

  <p>The Brigadier rode off with a very perfunctory salute.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he a rather curmudgeonly sort of officer?" asked Rosemary the
  moment that his back was turned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" laughed Cunningham. "That's Byng-bahadur's little way, that's
  all. He's quite likely to insist on being best man or something of that sort
  when the show's all over! Wait here while I fetch the escort."</p>
