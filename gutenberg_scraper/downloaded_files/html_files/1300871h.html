  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-01"
     id="ch1-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE SUMMONS</h2>

  <p class="first">On a certain day in November, a misty day with sharpness
  under the mist, a gentleman was walking out of the little town of St. Ives,
  which stood black and bleak above the bleak, black waters of the Ouse and the
  mournful clusters of bare, drooping willows.</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon, and there chanced to be no one abroad in the
  grazing lands outside the town save this one gentleman who walked eastward
  towards the damp, vaporous fen country.</p>

  <p>The horizon was brought within a few yards of him by the confining mist,
  and, as he walked farther from St. Ives, the town began to be also rapidly
  lost and absorbed in the general dull greyness, so that when he turned at
  last (sharply and as if with some set purpose or some lively inner
  prompting), the dwelling-houses, the river, bounded by the barns and palings,
  had all disappeared, and there remained only visible the erect, tall steeple
  of the church, pointing into the grey sky from the dark obscured willows and
  dark obscured town and unseen river.</p>

  <p>And though he walked rapidly, yet this tower and steeple of the old,
  humble, enduring church continued long in sight, for it was uplifted into the
  higher, clearer air, and was in itself substantial and massive.</p>

  <p>For the high-wrought mood of this gentleman who, as he advanced farther
  into utter solitude, so continually looked back, this steeple of God's
  mansion had a deep spiritual meaning; it rose out of darkness and vapour and
  obscurity as the mandate of God rose, the one clear thing, out of the
  confusions and strifes and clamours of the world.</p>

  <p>The mandate of God, ay&mdash;surely the one thing that mattered, the one
  thing to be followed and obeyed&mdash;and when the summons and command were
  clear there was great joy in obedience; but what when, as now, the order was
  not given, when God remained mute and the soul of His creature was enclosed
  in darkness even as town and fields were now enclosed in the cloudy
  exhumations of the earth?</p>

  <p>When the steeple was at last hidden from his keenest glance, the gentleman
  stopped and, leaning against a paling, gazed over the short expanse of foggy
  ground visible to him, alone and terribly lonely in his soul.</p>

  <p>A deep melancholy lay upon him, a melancholy almost inseparable from his
  unbending, austere, and sombre creed, a melancholy of the spirit, black and
  awful, neither to be ignored nor reasoned with&mdash;a spiritual disease to
  which he had been prone since his earliest youth, and which became at times
  almost intolerable and scarcely to be endured by any mortal, however
  stout-hearted.</p>

  <p>Had any one come up through the November mist and noticed and observed
  this gentleman leaning on the rough willow paling, he would have seen nothing
  to suggest a gloomy mystic nor one struggling with the anguished tribulations
  of the soul.</p>

  <p>He was, to the outward eye, a man in the prime of life, of the type
  commonly accepted as English, and, indeed, possible to no other nation in the
  world, of medium height and the appearance of medium strength, his obvious
  gentility gracing his plain, sober, frieze clothes, and the little sword at
  his side giving the one courtly touch to his habit, which otherwise, with
  plain band and ribbonless hat, might have seemed too much that of a mere
  farmer, for his high boots, now mud-caked, had seen good service. He wore no
  gloves on his browned hands, and his hair, of the dusk English brown, was cut
  in a country fashion, and worn no longer than his shoulders.</p>

  <p>His face was unusual, yet might have been that of an ordinary man, the
  features powerful, the nose bluntly aquiline, the mouth set steadily, the
  Saxon grey-blue eyes rather overbrowed, giving the countenance a Blooming
  air, the chin and jaw massive, the complexion tanned to the glowing natural
  colour of a healthy fair man past any bloom of youth, and unused to the
  softness of town life.</p>

  <p>Not a handsome face, but not uncomely, and remarkable chiefly (now, at
  least) for a certain quiet look, not a slumbering look, but rather the look
  of one whose soul is locked and sealed.</p>

  <p>Such was his appearance, and his history was as simple and unpretending as
  his visage and his attire; nothing had ever happened to him that he should
  stand there now sunk in torments of melancholy. His life had been smooth,
  uneventful, successful; he had been born and bred in Huntingdon, and never
  gone beyond the borders of that county save when he had sat, a silent borough
  Member, in His Majesty's last Parliament at Westminster, nine years ago, and
  he was in that happy position of being well known and respected, in his own
  little world, as one of the largest landowners in St. Ives, and utterly
  unknown to the great world where fame is distraction and confusion. He was
  tranquil in an honourable obscurity, happy in his wife, his children, of an
  old well-placed family, well connected, and of considerable local influence
  and fair repute. He could himself remember that His late Majesty, twice
  coming through Huntingdon, had each time been entertained by his grandfather
  at his manor house, on the first occasion with much splendour, when the King
  came from Scotland to take up his new crown.</p>

  <p>In his own business he had prospered; the lands he had bought at St. Ives
  and which he farmed himself, reclaiming them with patience from the fen, had
  well repaid his labour, and he might count himself well off, and even, for
  this quiet spot, wealthy.</p>

  <p>Therefore it might have been supposed that this man, midway now through
  life, would have considered his honourable labour, his honourable profits,
  his serene existence, his fair placement and good report among his
  neighbours, his prospect of quietness and respect and comfort to the end of
  his days, and have been content, for he was without ambition.</p>

  <p>But he was not satisfied with his own material happiness, for great new
  forces and powers were abroad in the world struggling together, and this
  struggle echoed again and again in the heart of the man who stood against the
  willow paling, gazing into the November mist that shrouded Erith Bulwark and
  the fen country.</p>

  <p>The country had been long at peace, lulled and tranquil after that great
  triumph of the Reformation of the Church, and that demonstration of material
  power which had silenced the pretensions of Spain and warned the world what
  England was.</p>

  <p>But Elizabeth was now a generation dead, and the grandson of the Papist
  Mary sat on the Tudor's throne with a Frenchwoman, a Mary and a Papist too,
  beside him, and the Church was becoming again corrupt, the power of the
  bishops daily higher, troubles in Church and State increasing, liberty, civil
  and religious, threatened&mdash;for the King and his ministers had governed
  nine years without a Parliament, contrary to the laws and ordinances of the
  realm of England.</p>

  <p>This Huntingdonshire gentleman knew that the devil was in these things,
  that God was surely with the oppressed, with those who sought and found a
  purer worship, with those, daily increasing, who accepted that teaching of
  John Calvin which had inspired the Hollanders to throw off the bloody yoke of
  Alva and the Inquisition, with those 'who had ventured to plead humbly for
  liberty of conscience at the conference of Hampton and had been denied by
  King and bishops with threats and scorn, and had gone about since, ridiculed
  and persecuted, nicknamed 'Puritans.'</p>

  <p>This man knew this as he knew the King and the bishops, the ministers, and
  the followers of these, were dealing with things idolatrous and horrible,
  stepping into the fore-courts of hell.</p>

  <p>Ay, and taking the nation with them. How was that to be
  prevented&mdash;which way did God appoint?</p>

  <p>That was the question which troubled the personal melancholy of the man in
  whose heart it flashed&mdash;for the King was King by Divine appointment, and
  if he had lent his weight and authority to these ways of misrule and
  oppression, idolatry and Papistry, who was to argue with him or withstand
  him?</p>

  <p>Who was to appeal from the King to God?</p>

  <p>The man in the frieze habit was conscious of a burning flame or light in
  himself which urged him to step forward for this distracted England's
  succour. But he received no summons. The face of the Lord was veiled and he
  was but a poor soul, possibly damned, with no knowledge of what destiny the
  Highest had prepared for him. He felt himself in blackest chaos; his soul,
  which had ever striven to obtain God's grace, now seemed tossed far from
  mercy on the black waters of despair.</p>

  <p>To him, and especially in this mood, the present world was nothing; he was
  not given to metaphor, but in his thoughts he compared the world to a little
  plank he had once seen stretched across a deep and angry stream, and arched
  above with fairest blossoming trees. The plank in itself was insignificant,
  and useful only to support those who might for a moment stand
  thereon&mdash;the important thing was to save oneself from the black,
  dangerous abysses beneath, and gain, somehow, the flower-crowned heights that
  the trees veiled and decked.</p>

  <p>Whether the plank be rough or smooth, narrow or wide, mattered not at all,
  if only one were enabled to tread thereon straightly. So it mattered not a
  jot to this gentleman what his station, chances, or fortunes might be in this
  world. Am I damned or saved? was the question that held the heart of his
  torment and mingled with it was another: Is there not that in me, unworthy as
  I am, which God might make use of to save these poor people in poor England
  now? Yea, though I am not bred to be a lawyer or a soldier, am I not
  conscious of <i>something</i> within me which might fit me for this work if
  God should call me to it?</p>

  <p>But the heavens were black and mute to his intense prayers and his humble
  endeavours to commune with God, and he went his obscure way in wretchedness
  of heart, never faltering from the stern composure of his belief that the
  Lord had preordained all things, and that no act of any man's could alter a
  jot what was to befall.</p>

  <p>The King and the bishops, poor puppets, believed in Freewill and such
  heresies of Arminianism and Popery, but this Calvinist, standing in the
  November vapour, <i>knew</i> that he was but a helpless weapon to be used as
  God might direct; <i>knew</i> he was saved or damned before his birth, and
  that no deed of his could alter the Divine fiat; <i>knew</i> he was but a
  machine into which the Holy Spirit might blow some sparks, but which at
  present was cold and empty.</p>

  <p>In this moment he felt hell very close beneath his feet, the earth seemed
  a mere crust over that awful region, a crust that might easily break and spew
  forth devils, while the over-arching heavens seemed lost, lost beyond mortal
  attainment.</p>

  <p>A long shudder shook his strong body, he covered the steadfast grey eyes
  with his rough hand, and leant heavily against the paling.</p>

  <p>A cousin of his, a man not unknown in Parliament, had recently defied the
  King; had refused, being armed and at the head of his tenantry, to pay the
  ship-money, that being a tax (one of many) levied by the King without the
  consent of the people of England, Parliament being in abeyance; and this
  country gentleman had appealed to the laws, asking, 'By what authority?' and
  when they said, 'the King,'&mdash;had answered, 'that was not sufficient, for
  the laws and the nation were above the King, and alone he could enforce
  nothing.'</p>

  <p>Which statement made men stare, for it was near treason, and the speaker
  of these words was now on his trial, and his cousin, fighting through his own
  tribulations, thought of him and of the issue that hung upon the verdict
  pronounced upon his case.</p>

  <p>If the judges found the ship-money tax illegal, then had civil liberty won
  indeed a victory! If they found that the King was above the laws and could by
  his sole authority do what he pleased in Church and State, why, where was
  England and those poor few within her borders who truly sought the Lord? Yet
  not so much even this tremendous issue touched the soul of the melancholy
  Calvinist as the thought&mdash;What he did, could not I do, ay, and more?</p>

  <p>If one, a gentleman of good repute, may thus challenge even the sacred
  authority of the King, may not another, of the same good blood and stalwart
  faith, the Lord bidding him, accomplish something?</p>

  <p>The thought was like a tiny ray of light penetrating his deep melancholy;
  he moved from his cramped position, shook his frieze cloak on which the drops
  of moisture hung thick, and looked about him.</p>

  <p>Something to do&mdash;something to labour for&mdash;something to save and
  guard for the Lord in this old realm where all had gone so crooked of
  late...</p>

  <p>The fire that never lay very deep beneath the stagnation of his
  melancholies mounted clear and bright in his soul.</p>

  <p>He turned about to where he knew the church stood, and, stately Englishman
  as he was, he flung out his hands wide with the unconscious gesture of strong
  passion, and, looking upwards through the drizzling mist with that inner eye
  which perfectly beheld the choired rows of Paradise and the multitude about
  the Throne, he cried out aloud&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Lord, wilt thou not choose <i>me</i> also for this service?'</p>

  <p>The little light in his soul increased into a gleam of hope; he turned his
  back on the fens and Erith Bulwark, and retraced his steps towards St. Ives,
  crossing the lands of Slepe Hall, which he rented, and coming soon again in
  view of the quiet, sombre little town, and of the garden wall enclosing his
  own riverside house.</p>

  <p>The mist now began to waver and lift, and to be over-coloured with a play
  of light, and when he reached the church the day was almost normal fair.</p>

  <p>In his soul, too, was the struggle stilled; a curious apathy, a pause in
  spiritual experience, enveloped him. He stood motionless for a moment, for he
  felt physically weak and his legs trembled under him.</p>

  <p>As he halted so, not a yard from the entrance to the church, a solitary
  horseman disturbed the dulness of the street&mdash;a young yeoman farmer
  returning from market at Huntingdon town. On seeing the gentleman he reined
  in the stout grey he rode, and very respectfully raised his hat.</p>

  <p>'Why, sir,' he said, 'there is great news in Huntingdon. Why, Mr.
  Cromwell, the news of the verdict is abroad!'</p>

  <p>The other had no need to ask what verdict. In all England men spoke of
  'the trial'&mdash;the trial of John Hampton for refusing to pay the King's
  tax.</p>

  <p>'Well?' he asked, and his serious face was pale.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Cromwell,' answered the young man dismally, 'he is to pay the twenty
  shillings.'</p>

  <p>For a moment Mr. Cromwell was silent, then he spoke slowly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'So we have no hope in those who administer the laws?'</p>

  <p>'They have put the laws beneath His Majesty,' said the farmer eagerly.
  'All is to be as he wills, with no talk of a Parliament at all&mdash;so the
  lawyers in London say, sir&mdash;and Mr. Hampton is to pay the twenty
  shillings which goeth with many another honest man's money into the coffers
  of the bishops and the Papist Queen.'</p>

  <p>'Ay, so the lawyers say,' returned Mr. Cromwell, 'but this is a matter
  which England '&mdash;he slightly stressed the word&mdash;'must decide.'</p>

  <p>The young farmer, flushed and important with his great news, saluted
  again, and rode on to report all over the countryside how the protest of Mr.
  John Hampton to the laws of England against the tyranny of the King had
  failed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell remained standing by the church a moment, then he wandered
  off into one of his own fields near by and entered a great barn which stood
  there, and remained silent in the dimness of the interior, which was fragrant
  from the scent of last summer's hay stored in the lofts.</p>

  <p>So the Law had decided in favour of the King, who might now levy
  ship-money and whatever tax else he chose&mdash;and there would be the Tower
  and the pillory, the branding and the fine, for those who dared resist, as
  there had been for Prynne and Bastwick who had dared to criticize the ritual
  of Archbishop Laud.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell felt a strange sparkle in his blood: he paced to and fro on
  the rough floor, strewn with the dried husks of the last harvest, and clasped
  his hands on his rough coat-breast and then dropped the left to his sword. As
  he clasped the plain hilt, a sudden exaltation shot into his heart, his
  spirit leapt suddenly to a greater height than any it had touched before. And
  then it happened.</p>

  <p>A dazzle of unbelievable light opened before his inner vision, he fell on
  his knees and, from a sword of fire, received the accolade of God...</p>

  <p>'Lord, I am saved!' he cried. 'I am in Grace! And I am chosen to be Thy
  servant in this work which is to be done in England...'</p>

  <p>When the glamour faded he rose, staggering, and wept a little for joy.</p>

  <p>It was a tremendous moment of his life.</p>

  <p>Then he went home across the wet fields, outwardly an ordinary gentleman,
  inwardly a soul newly awake to salvation, bearing a burning light no more to
  be quenched until it returned to Heaven.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-02"
     id="ch1-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THREE YEARS LATER</h2>

  <p class="first">'Sir,' said the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who had been
  called hotly from that country to counsel the imperative needs of the King,
  'I am come to give you advice, and I tell you first, and plainly, never man
  came to so lost a business.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke they stood looking at each other, master and servant, King and
  minister, in a little cabinet of Whitehall, that glittered with richness and
  flash of deep colour, like a casket of jewels.</p>

  <p>Beyond the deep square window lay the gardens, the houses, the straight
  reach of river, and London, beneath a quivering August haze; no discord of
  sight nor sound disturbed the peaceful harmony of this scene, and in the
  palace gardens the trees rustled and the flowers gave forth their strength in
  sweet odours unvexed by human noise or hustle; yet my lord, gazing out on
  this sunshine, knew well enough 'that the city, whose towers rose beyond the
  sleepy river, was nursing forces that might soon gather sufficient deadly
  power to sweep him, and all he stood for, into nothingness. He bore himself
  erect, and the courage that was his strongest quality showed in his haughty
  pose, in the expression of his dark, disdainful face, in the quiet smile with
  which he spoke his gloomy pronouncement.</p>

  <p>He received no immediate answer, and in the pause of silence he glanced
  attentively at the master whom he had served so whole-heartedly and believed
  in so intensely&mdash;for such as he must always believe intensely in the
  principle for which they fight.</p>

  <p>Charles was leaning against the mullions; melancholy and levity were
  strangely mingled in his mien. In stature and make he was slight, in dress
  extravagant, his dove-grey silk was embroidered with seed pearls and gold,
  and a deep collar of exquisite lace was fastened by two gold tassels at the
  lacing of his doublet.</p>

  <p>Every Englishman, first seeing him, noted how foreign he was in
  appearance. Though brought up as one of the nation whom he was to rule, blood
  was here stronger than breeding, the powerful French-Scotch strain of his
  famous name, the influence of his gay, foreign mother, showed in his
  elegance, his refinement, his somewhat sad dignity, which gave him an air as
  if he were too great to be proud outwardly, but was beyond measure proud
  inwardly.</p>

  <p>His hair, of the renowned Stewart auburn colour, fell full and Soft round
  a face that was slightly worn and troubled, but handsome and composed
  still&mdash;a face that was too charming to be the index of a mind, or more
  than a mere seductive disguise for whatever manner of man lay beneath.</p>

  <p>My lord had served him long and known him as intimately as any man save my
  late murdered Duke of Buckingham, but even my lord, now it was coming to the
  issue of their joint policies, could not be quite sure what the King would
  do,&mdash;where he would be adamant and where give way, where he would fail,
  and where he would stand firm.</p>

  <p>'A lost business,' Charles repeated at last. He had a blood-red cameo on
  the little finger of his fair left hand, and turned it about as he spoke; it
  was the only jewel he wore save a long pearl in his right ear.</p>

  <p>'Sir, I call it no better than lost. The army unexercised and unprovided,
  great disloyalty abroad, the Scots in a rebellion which is daily more
  successful, the people mightily disaffected, and all in a clamour for a
  Parliament&mdash;and I would to God, sire, that you had not dismissed the
  last one, for it was better than any you are like to have called together at
  this turn.'</p>

  <p>'I will,' said Charles, 'call none at all.' He knew secretly that his
  minister was right, and he already regretted the moment of spleen in which,
  after a three weeks' sitting, he had dismissed the first Parliament he had
  called for eleven years&mdash;had called in desperation for aid against the
  Scots&mdash;for he saw that what Strafford said was true, and that in the
  present temper of the nation he was unlikely to get men so loyal in their
  temper as even the Members of the so-called Little Parliament had been.</p>

  <p>'Yea, call none at all,' returned the Earl, 'and where are we for money?
  Is there any king or country to whom we can turn? Have we not asked in vain
  even at Rome&mdash;even from the merchants of Genoa?'</p>

  <p>'The money must be raised in England,' said the King. He would not put it
  into words, but to himself he was forced to admit that no foreign power nor
  personage would lend money without security&mdash;and security Charles was
  quite unable to give; for in the eyes of Europe a King of England, acting
  without his Parliament, was a person by no means to be seriously
  regarded.</p>

  <p>'Then,' returned Strafford, in the tone of a man who courageously accepts
  defeat, 'your Majesty must call another Parliament.'</p>

  <p>Charles moved from the window and seated himself before a small bureau of
  dark wood, inlaid with mother-o'-pearl; he rested his delicate face in his
  delicate hand and gazed mournfully, almost reproachfully, at his
  minister.</p>

  <p>'You accuse me of failure,' said the Earl, answering the look in his
  master's eyes. 'Well, I have failed.'</p>

  <p>Certainly he had; his famous policy, which he had proudly called
  'Thorough,' had fallen to pieces before the first demonstration of the
  popular anger, and his attempt to establish the English monarchy as the
  monarchies of Spain and France were established had come to nothing. He was
  not the man to shirk blame or responsibility, and he did not reflect, as he
  might have reflected, that had Charles whole-heartedly trusted Strafford as
  Strafford had whole-heartedly served Charles, the endeavour to force the
  policies of Richelieu on the English people might have approached nearer
  accomplishment, or at least have avoided a failure so disastrous.</p>

  <p>The King did not speak; he was not in a mood to be generous with his
  servant, for his own humiliation was very bitter and would be bitterer still
  if he were forced to call another Parliament. The rebellious Scots, resisting
  his attempt to thrust Episcopalian bishops upon them, had advanced as far as
  Durham, and the English, far from flying to arms to resist the invader, were
  showing obviously enough that they considered the Scottish cause as theirs,
  and would indeed soon follow their northern neighbour's example and call a
  Parliament of their own did Charles not call one for them.</p>

  <p>So much the daily petitions, and the demeanour of John Pym, the ringleader
  of the malcontents, and those country gentlemen who had rallied round him in
  the Little Parliament, by refusing supplies for the Scottish war unless the
  country's grievances were first redressed, attested.</p>

  <p>Strafford took his eyes from his master and looked across the garden to
  the shimmering river. He was a more resolute, a more brilliant, a bolder man
  than the King. He saw more clearly and gauged more accurately than his
  Majesty the strength of the opposition now growing in England against the
  royal prerogative and the pretensions of the Anglican clergy, and he saw also
  that in the ensuing struggle he stood in the forefront of the battle and was
  marked out by Pym and his followers as the first and principal victim. Once
  he had been of Pym's party, and when he had seceded to the King, Pym had told
  him, 'You may leave us, but we shall not leave you while your head is on your
  shoulders.'</p>

  <p>He had only been Thomas Wentworth then, and now he was Earl of Strafford,
  and, under the King, the greatest man in the three realms, but the threat
  recurred to him now as his eyes rested on the dazzle of the river flowing
  swiftly towards the Tower.</p>

  <p>He knew he had conic to England to play a desperate game with John Pym,
  and that the stakes were, '<i>Thy head or my head</i>.'</p>

  <p>The King startled him from his sombre thoughts by a light blow with
  clenched hand on the bureau, and by rising abruptly.</p>

  <p>'Is there no one to defend me against these rebellious Commons?' he cried,
  as if his reflections had become desperate and were no longer to be borne in
  silence.</p>

  <p>'I have,' said Strafford, 'done my utmost. I am the best-hated man in
  England, sire, for what I have done to enforce your authority. But if none of
  my expedients avail your Majesty, if the people will not take a debased
  coinage, if the train-bands refuse to arm&mdash;if all the support of my
  Archbishop but end in his fleeing his palace, pursued by the
  people&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'The people!' broke in Charles, 'always the people!'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' said Strafford, 'always&mdash;the people.'</p>

  <p>'And what, my lord,' asked the King, 'is your advice now?'</p>

  <p>'Advice?' echoed the Earl; the sun now fell full over his fine face and
  showed it to be near as colourless as the rich lace collar he wore. 'There is
  no advice to be given but this&mdash;Your Majesty must call a
  Parliament.'</p>

  <p>The King's mobile mouth curved scornfully.</p>

  <p>'And what will be the first action of this new assembly?' he demanded. 'To
  present a petition against my Lord Strafford as once a petition was presented
  against my Lord Buckingham. Do you not know how the nation deals with my
  friends?'</p>

  <p>'Sire,' replied the minister, with a great sweetness of manner that came
  with endearing charm from one of his stern and bold demeanour, 'if Your
  Majesty calls me friend, it is enough. What shall I fear when the King stands
  by me?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes,' replied Charles, in sudden agitation; 'they should not have
  had Buckingham, and they shall not have you&mdash;rest assured, my lord.
  Guard only from another Felton, and I will protect you from these baying
  hounds that hate us so.'</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and Strafford clasped and kissed it with sincere
  reverence. Not only was the King his beloved master, but the symbol of that
  sacred and Divine authority which he believed to be the finest form of
  government, and which his strong genius had so devotedly and strenuously
  served.</p>

  <p>The King, who seemed shaken with some sudden emotion, turned away,
  pressing his handkerchief to his lips, and at that moment the door opened,
  the leathern hanging that concealed it was lifted, and a lady entered the
  cabinet&mdash;a lady frail and flowerlike to the eye, attired in a gown of
  white silk with knots of pink; a lady with a radiant face of the most
  delicate hues and shadings, whose fine black ringlets were adorned with a
  braid of pearls worked in the likeness of the fleur-de-lis on a pink
  ribbon.</p>

  <p>Her countenance wore a look of fatigue and anxiety under the animation of
  her expression, but, though she had lost the dewy loveliness of her girlhood,
  she still appeared fragrant and youthful, an exquisite, royal creature whose
  Bourbon blood showed in the quick, impetuous pride of her carriage, while she
  had the great black eyes of her Medici mother, and something, too, of the
  Italian in her gay liveliness.</p>

  <p>At her entrance the King turned towards her with instant eagerness. He had
  at this time three counsellors&mdash;Strafford, Laud, and the Queen&mdash;and
  any one who looked upon him now as he took his wife's hand and led her to the
  deep-cushioned window-seat, would not have doubted which had the most
  influence of the three. Henriette Marie was now, as she had ever been, the
  most powerful influence in her husband's life.</p>

  <p>She looked now from the King to the Earl and said quickly, with a
  pronounced French accent&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What advice does my lord give in this perverse issue?'</p>

  <p>'He saith there is nothing for it, Mary, but to call another
  Parliament.'</p>

  <p>The Queen stamped her white-shod foot.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she exclaimed, with her eyes afire and a heat as of
  fire in her voice also. 'Are we to stretch our 'necks out for the
  <i>canaille</i> to put their feet thereon?'</p>

  <p>She spoke with the boundless pride of the daughter of Henri Quatre, of one
  whose father, brother, and husband were kings; she spoke also with the
  intolerance of a Papist for heretics, and with a woman's ignorance of the
  worth and value of the great movements and upheavals of the world.</p>

  <p>All this Strafford saw; he saw also that she was a bad counsellor for the
  King, but, though he was not the kind of man to relish sharing confidences
  with a woman, he had long since recognized the fact that Henriette Marie
  ruled England fully as much as the King.</p>

  <p>Therefore he answered quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'It is the only expedient, Madame, to raise money.'</p>

  <p>'I would rather,' returned the Queen impetuously, 'sell every jewel I
  possess!'</p>

  <p>The Earl smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>'All your jewels twice over, Madame, would not serve our need now.'</p>

  <p>The Queen turned and caught her husband's sleeve.</p>

  <p>'Is there no alternative&mdash;none?' she demanded. 'Where are the
  soldiers? Believe me, I would sooner see the heads of these men on London
  Bridge than conferring together in Westminster Hall.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' replied Charles tenderly, 'hold up thy heart, dearest. I cannot
  think I shall again be confronted by such unruly miscreants as last time, and
  truly there are divers things of much inconvenience that I do fear cannot be
  settled save by this same calling of a Parliament.'</p>

  <p>The Queen returned his look of deep affection with a flashing glance.</p>

  <p>'Truly I am ashamed and scandalized that Your Majesty is come to this
  pass! Where are your lords and your soldiers?'</p>

  <p>'We have barely enough to hold the Scots off London,' replied Charles,
  'and those are unpaid and disaffected&mdash;as thou knowest.'</p>

  <p>The Queen's great eyes sparkled with the ready tears of provoked
  passion.</p>

  <p>'My Lord Archbishop was not safe at Lambeth,' said Strafford slowly. 'The
  mobile followed him even to the gates of Whitehall.'</p>

  <p>'And is there no one to fire on them&mdash;to cut them down with the
  sword?' asked the Queen. 'Oh, Strafford, my Lord Strafford, I fear you have
  very greatly failed of your high promises!'</p>

  <p>'The depth of my failure is measured by the depth of my humiliation,'
  returned the Earl. 'I have not spared myself, Madame, in the endeavour to
  make this kingdom great in the councils of Europe, and His Majesty first
  among the crowned heads thereof, but the breath of the populace is a wind
  that will blow any barque on to the rocks.'</p>

  <p>The King put his hand on Strafford's great shoulder.</p>

  <p>'My friend,' he said warmly, 'no king ever had a truer. Do not blame my
  lord, Mary, for this pass we are in, for he, if any man can, will serve us
  and help us to a better issue.'</p>

  <p>'In France we have other ways to deal with treason and rebellion,' said
  the Queen with sudden weariness; 'but do what thou wilt! Call thy Parliament,
  and God grant it avail thee to ease thy needs!'</p>

  <p>She moved, with a whisper of silk, from the two men, and, taking up a
  vellum-bound book from the little bureau where the King had sat, fluttered
  over the painted leaves.</p>

  <p>Strafford picked up his great plumed hat; he was bound that evening for
  the headquarters of the English army at York, where he was to take up the
  chief command.</p>

  <p>The King walked with him to the door, holding his arm.</p>

  <p>'Fear thou nought,' he said earnestly. 'I will protect thee.'</p>

  <p>The Queen put down the book and came forward.</p>

  <p>'Take no heed of my passions,' she said sweetly. 'You have served us well
  and we love you; good fortune, my lord. Farewell, and a fair journey to
  York.'</p>

  <p>The Earl went on one knee to kiss her perfumed, pale hand, and she looked
  at him with a certain tenderness, a certain regret, a certain scorn curious
  to behold.</p>

  <p>'I am too much your servant to avow myself afresh your creature,' said
  Strafford, lifting his ardent eyes, not to the lady, but to his master. 'You
  have all of me. I pray God deliver Your Majesty from these present pressures,
  and grant me power to work you some service.'</p>

  <p>The sun was pouring broad beams full through the window and illumining all
  the rich treasures that filled the cabinet, the gold-threaded tapestry, the
  Italian pictures, the finely-wrought furniture, the carpets of Persia, and
  the two graceful figures so delicately apt to this gorgeous setting. The
  sunlight fell also on my lord, a figure more soldier-like and not so attuned
  to a scene of luxury.</p>

  <p>So he took his leave and came glooming into the courtyard, and mounted
  amid his escort, and rode down Whitehall.</p>

  <p>The streets were empty, by reason of the heat; only the vendors of oranges
  and a few idlers were abroad, but when my lord reached Westminster Hall, he
  saw by the corner-posts of the road two men standing, and his bright, quick
  glance knew them at once for the two enemies of his&mdash;one his chief
  enemy, Mr. Pym, and the other one of his followers who had sat for Cambridge
  in the Little Parliament, and been marked unfavourably by my lord&mdash;a
  certain Oliver Cromwell.</p>

  <p>My lord was too great a man to be discourteous, he touched his beaver to
  the gentlemen and rode on with his guard, serene and aloof.</p>

  <p>John Pym looked after the little cavalcade flashing in the dust and
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>'There goeth the chief enemy of these realms,' he said. 'Marked you his
  haughty eye when he did salute us?'</p>

  <p>'He cometh from Whitehall,' returned Mr. Cromwell. 'Hath he advised the
  King to call a Parliament, think you, Mr. Pym?'</p>

  <p>John Pym pointed to Westminster Hall behind them.</p>

  <p>'There you and I will sit before the summer be burnt out,' he answered,
  'whether the King issue the writs or no.'</p>

  <p>They both stood silent, looking after my lord, who presently turned in his
  saddle and gazed back at the Parliament House.</p>

  <p>'<i>My head or thy head</i>,' he thought, as he rode through the
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>Strafford did not want to die.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-03"
     id="ch1-03"></a>CHAPTER III. MR. PYM AND AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">When Mr. Cromwell had seen Lord Strafford ride away into the
  late summer dust of gold, he returned to his lodging and, packing up his
  effects, went back to Huntingdon. He was lately removed from St. Ives to Ely,
  and was become of late a more quiet, sombre man than even formerly, for he
  had received a blow his soul had staggered under, namely, the death of his
  eldest son, a gallant youth still at college. Yet he was soon withdrawn again
  from his grazing grounds and his cattle, his harvesting, and buying, and
  selling, for the King called a Parliament, and the people sent up from the
  boroughs and shires all the flower of English gentlehood, the Cursons,
  Ashtons, Leighs, Derings, Ingrams, Fairfaxes, Cecils, Polies, Grenvils,
  Trevors, Carews, and Edgcombes, all fine old names deep rooted in English
  soil&mdash;most of them the very men who had formed the late Parliament which
  the King had so summarily dismissed&mdash;and with them came Mr. Cromwell,
  borough member for Cambridge, a silent man still, waiting for the Divine
  guidance which had been promised him when he entered into Covenant with the
  Lord.</p>

  <p>Soon after the session opened, a motion was moved for inquiry into Irish
  affairs, and Mr. Cromwell, seeing Mr. Pym as they left the House together,
  called out to him and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>'It is my Lord Strafford you strike at, is it not?'</p>

  <p>And Mr. Pym answered 'Yes.'</p>

  <p>The two gentlemen walked together down Whitehall. There were a great many
  of the meaner sort abroad, P. hustling and clamouring and passing rumour from
  mouth to mouth about the progress of the Scots and the humour of the King,
  all of them big with hopes of the things the Parliament men would do, now
  they were gotten together; of how the bishops would be put down for ever, the
  new taxes taken off, and His Majesty's design for bringing over an army of
  Irish or French Papists finally defeated.</p>

  <p>As they neared Whitehall&mdash;that portentous and haughty palace behind
  whose closed gates Majesty endured humiliation as best might be&mdash;Mr.
  Pym, looking round him in his stately way at the robust and eager crowd,
  touched his companion's arm.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Cromwell,' he said, 'there is good material here if he right man
  could be found to handle it.'</p>

  <p>''Tis a great nation,' answered Mr. Cromwell, 'but 'tis to the ancient
  blood we must look&mdash;not to these.'</p>

  <p>'That was my meaning,' returned John Pym; 'there are among us many able
  men&mdash;but who will be called?'</p>

  <p>'Thou thyself, Mr. Pym,' said his friend warmly, 'art surely a man after
  God's own heart, one whom He hath raised up to be a captain, even as He
  raised up David.'</p>

  <p>'I do what I can,' returned Mr. Pym quietly, 'but I am not the man for
  whom England waiteth.'</p>

  <p>By now they had reached the post office at Charing Cross and halted at a
  cutler's shop near by, for Mr. Cromwell had left his sword there in the
  morning to be repaired, and now came to call for it. As there was press
  enough of people buying and testing arms about the door, they were delayed a
  little, and as they waited, a young gentleman, thrusting a brace of new
  pistols into his belt, pushed his way through the crowd, mounted a horse a
  groom held for him, and rode away with great speed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pym looked after him.</p>

  <p>'That is a friend of my Lord Strafford,' he whispered, 'posting to York to
  warn him to keep from London.'</p>

  <p>'Has it come to that?' asked Mr. Cromwell in a moved voice. 'Is my lord
  afraid?'</p>

  <p>John Pym looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>'Hast thou not seen that temper in the House whereof any man might be
  afraid?' he answered.</p>

  <p>'But my Lord Strafford!' exclaimed the other gentleman in a tone as if he
  named the King himself.</p>

  <p>'Thinkest thou I have not the courage to impeach my Lord Strafford?'
  demanded Mr. Pym grimly. He is the chief author of these troubles, and must
  answer for them to the Commons of England.'</p>

  <p>'I well believe thou hast the courage,' answered Mr. Cromwell quietly,
  taking up the sword which was waiting for him, 'as I believe my lord hath the
  courage to answer you.'</p>

  <p>'He hath courage,' returned John Pym. 'You speak as if you favoured him,'
  he added with a smile.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell smiled also and they left the shop, turning towards St.
  Martin's Lane where Mr. Cromwell had his lodgings beyond the fields, and
  there, when they had reached his chamber, they sat quiet awhile, oppressed by
  the sense of great events which, gathering force and momentum with every day,
  were marching forward with the majestic strength of fate&mdash;events in
  which they, these two modest gentlemen sitting silent in this modest chamber,
  felt that they might be involved, might indeed be piece and part of the new
  pattern into which the destinies of England were being rapidly woven.</p>

  <p>Presently Mr. Cromwell rose and opened the window on to the light of the
  setting sun which fell aslant the narrow street.</p>

  <p>'There is a great battle before us,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Now the Parliament is called, half the battle is won,' replied Mr.
  Pym.</p>

  <p>Dost thou see things so easily?' returned the other.</p>

  <p>'This Earl now will make a fight.'</p>

  <p>'This Earl will bend,' flashed John Pym, 'as the King will bend.'</p>

  <p>'The King?' repeated Mr. Cromwell thoughtfully. 'Wilt thou threaten even
  the rock of Divine authority on which the throne standeth?'</p>

  <p>John Pym laid his hand on his friend's arm with' a great eagerness and
  intensity of gesture. He stood now in the full light of the open window, and
  it was noticeable that, despite his strong and passionate air, his person was
  emaciated and there was a look of disease and fatigue very marked in his
  mobile face, as if he felt the full weight of his years.</p>

  <p>'Hark ye, Mr. Cromwell,' he said, 'thou art now much hearkened to in the
  House and do often obtain the mastery thereof; thou wilt come to great things
  yet, for, methinks, thou hast power over men; help us now to rid England of
  this Strafford. I ask thee, for hitherto thou hast kept silence on this
  matter. And I do not know thy mind on it.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell regarded him gravely, almost mournfully.</p>

  <p>'Dost thou mean to have the Earl's head?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'That is my inner and final meaning&mdash;even as it is his to have thine
  and mine, and that of every man in England who dares speak his mind.'</p>

  <p>'Then there is failure before thee,' answered Oliver Cromwell, 'for this
  man is the King's friend, and the King will protect him.'</p>

  <p>'The King will have neither the power nor the will to protect a man whom
  the Commons demand.'</p>

  <p>'The Duke of Buckingham&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Mr. Pym broke the sentence.</p>

  <p>'Ay&mdash;the Duke of Buckingham&mdash;-would the King have saved him?
  Felton's knife spared the answer.'</p>

  <p>'This makes His Majesty without honour,' said Mr. Cromwell. 'I cannot
  imagine that he ever could or would abandon one whom he bath twined so
  closely in his affections.'</p>

  <p>'The Earl must go and all he standeth for,' returned John Pym.</p>

  <p>'Ay, all he standeth for&mdash;the Star Chamber, the ship-money, the Court
  of High Commission, the power of the bishops&mdash;but the man thou canst not
  touch, and thou mayst well leave his life when thou hast destroyed his life
  work.'</p>

  <p>'Surely thou art always too compassionate,' replied Mr. Pym.</p>

  <p>'I have no natural hatred against the Earl of Strafford,' smiled Mr.
  Cromwell, 'and it seemeth to me a hopeless task you do attempt, for the King
  can never surrender him.'</p>

  <p>I may fail,' said John Pym. 'I know that I play a desperate game, but I
  feel the Lord is with me and that for His ends and His people I work. Only a
  little while we have, the bravest and best of us, and how much there is to
  do! How much!'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell leant further out of the window; there was a pot of geranium
  slips on the sill, and their perfume was strengthening with the fall of
  evening, and filling the quiet air with richness.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell looked over the deep, bright, green leaves towards
  Whitehall which lay bathed in the gold and amber light of the sinking
  sun.</p>

  <p>'Hark!' he said, 'hark!'</p>

  <p>'Thou hast sharp ears,' said Mr. Pym. 'I hear nothing.</p>

  <p>I hear,' returned the other, 'the citizens of London rising&mdash;'</p>

  <p>John Pym listened intently. A distant, murmurous sound was soon audible
  enough, a hoarse sound of human shouting, a blend of human voices with clash
  of weapons and the tramp of feet.</p>

  <p>''Tis the train-bands fighting the apprentices, and those of the baser
  sort, belike,' said Mr. Pym. 'Yesterday they were like to have burnt down
  Lambeth Palace when they discovered His Grace had again fled.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell continued to gaze towards the end of the street, across which
  several people were beginning to run, attracted by the now common event of a
  street riot.</p>

  <p>'The Lord is leading the nation through bitter ways,' he observed. 'And I
  do see ahead of us a time of much trouble, for if His Majesty is stubborn,
  these,' he pointed down the street to the hurrying crowds, 'will fight.'</p>

  <p>'Parliament,' replied Mr. Pym, 'will settle all grievances without
  bringing the mobile into it. Mr. Cromwell, tomorrow I will go to the Bar of
  the House of Lords and impeach the King's favourite of high treason, and
  there will be a many following me. Wilt thou be one of them?'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell turned swiftly round to face his friend.</p>

  <p>'Count on me,' he said quietly, 'to not leave thy party until thou hast
  brought the King to reason, but I believe that this will be a longer and
  bloodier business than any of us reckon on as yet.'</p>

  <p>'I trust we shall leave blood out of it,' answered Mr. Pym gravely. 'But
  God directs as He will, and we are not of a temper to shrink from fighting
  for His word and our liberty.'</p>

  <p>By now the crowd had gathered in considerable proportions, and the two
  spectators at the window observed that the centre of this agitated throng was
  a coach and four which, protected by several constables, footmen, and two
  gentlemen on horseback, was endeavouring to make headway down Whitehall,
  probably to the palace.</p>

  <p>'Who is this,' wondered Mr. Pym, 'whose appearance causeth such a
  riot?'</p>

  <p>They were, however, too far off to discern the occupant of the coach, and
  therefore presently descended into the street to discover who it might be
  whose progress was thus impeded, and to offer, if need be, some assistance
  against the clamour of the mobile, for violence and outrage were not wished
  for by these two, even though the cries of the populace might be but an echo
  of their own sentiments.</p>

  <p>As they began to push their way into the fringe of the crowd, they
  perceived that the coach had been brought to a standstill and was densely
  surrounded by shop boys and the meaner kind of citizen.</p>

  <p>The coachman, buffeted by various missiles, leant from his box and
  cried&mdash;</p>

  <p>'My lady, I cannot go on!'</p>

  <p>At this the leathern curtains of the coach were drawn back and a woman's
  face appeared at the window. She regarded the press before her fixedly, and
  with a curious blankness of expression, her high-bred and sensitive
  countenance had a cold look of either pride or terror, or preoccupation,
  which made it mask-like as a carving.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pym touched his companion's arm.</p>

  <p>'It is Lady Strafford,' he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell had never before seen the wife of the great minister who was
  now no better than a doomed man, and he gazed with vast interest and pity at
  the face staring from the coach window.</p>

  <p>'We should save her from this,' he answered, and, M lifting his sword
  hilt, with a few rude blows he forced his way through the crowd to the
  coach.</p>

  <p>'Stop this fooling!' he shouted, and his voice, when raised, was of an
  extraordinary depth and harshness. The rioters turned, startled, and, with a
  quick movement of his powerful arm, he swept two youths from the wheels to
  which they were clinging to impede the movement of the coach.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pym was now beside him, rather breathless with pushing his way
  through.</p>

  <p>The Countess never moved or altered her bitter calm; the two gentlemen
  both saluted her, and when Mr. Pym's hat was off and she had a clear view of
  his countenance, she gave a great start and the hot blood rushed to her face
  and burnt up her pallor.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Pym!' she cried. 'Oh, John Pym!'</p>

  <p>At the sound of this name, which was now famous throughout England as the
  champion of the people, the crowd quieted and began shamefacedly to give way,
  being at heart good humoured and not disposed to more than rough horse-play,
  after the nature of English crowds.</p>

  <p>'Ride on, madam,' said Mr. Pym sombrely. 'Your way is clear.'</p>

  <p>I want not your succour,' she returned, with great heat and force; 'false
  friend and subtle enemy, I know what you contrive against us!'</p>

  <p>'Against <i>you</i> nothing,' he replied, 'since once I enjoyed your grace
  and entertainment&mdash;and, madam, it was your lord left us, not we
  him.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, what a land is this become!' answered the Countess, 'when every
  designing, rebellious knave may endeavour to strike even at the very
  architects of the realm!'</p>

  <p>'Architects of tyranny, madam,' said Mr. Pym; 'and every plain fellow who
  can handle a sword may rightly endeavour to strike at them.'</p>

  <p>'Your presence flouts me,' cried Lady Strafford. 'Drive on!'</p>

  <p>The coach swung forward on the leathers and jolted off down Whitehall,
  still pursued by a few boys shouting and hooting.</p>

  <p>'In the old days when I knew her,' said John Pym, 'she was a most modest,
  excellent lady, but now I doubt but that she is proud and blinded even as her
  lord.'</p>

  <p>'She seemed to me,' replied Mr. Cromwell, 'to be not so much as one proud,
  but as one in a mortal fear.'</p>

  <p>'She has heard somewhat of this inquiry into Irish affairs, and is off to
  the King to pray protection for her lord. Poor, silly woman, as if she could
  prevail against the Commons of England!'</p>

  <p>The autumn dusk was now rapidly approaching, and the two friends turned
  into the Strand to find a tavern to get themselves some dinner before they
  returned to the House.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Countess of Strafford drove furiously into the courtyard of
  the palace and, hastening through the public halls and galleries, demanded an
  audience of the Queen.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-04"
     id="ch1-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE QUEEN'S POLICY</h2>

  <p class="first">Lady Strafford was admitted, without any delay, into the
  private apartment of the Queen, where Henriette Marie sat with two ladies in
  a sumptuous simplicity and elegant seclusion, which was noticeable in the
  extreme richness and good taste of the apartment, in the attire of the Queen
  herself, which, free from all fopperies of fashion, was of an exceeding
  fineness and grace, and in her occupation, which was that of sewing figures
  in beads on a casket of white silk.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the Countess, she very sweetly dismissed the ladies and
  smiled at her visitor, then continued her task, thoughtfully selecting the
  beads from an ivory tray and sewing them skilfully on to the thick white
  silk.</p>

  <p>The Countess remained standing before the Queen. She was now shown to be a
  woman of a carriage of pride and tire, fair-haired, and swift-moving, with a
  great expression of energy which did not alter her wholly feminine
  attraction.</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty will forgive this uncourtly coming of mine,' she said, 'but
  I have it on good authority that this inquiry into Irish Affairs is but a
  covert attack on my Lord Strafford.'</p>

  <p>'Yea, most certainly,' returned the Queen, raising her soft eyes to the
  breathless lady.</p>

  <p>'I saw John Pym to-day,' cried the Countess, 'and methought he had an air
  of triumph; besides, would the very boys in the street dare shout at me
  unless my lord's fall were assured?'</p>

  <p>She twisted her hands together and sank on to a brocade stool near the
  window. The Queen slightly lifted her shoulders and smiled. She bitterly
  detested the English who in their turn loathed her, both for her nationality
  and her religion, and even for the name 'Mary,' which the King gave her, and
  which was for ever connected in the popular mind with Papistry and with two
  queens who had been enemies of England. Therefore she was well-used to
  unpopularity and that hatred of the crowd of which Lady Strafford to-day had
  had a first taste.</p>

  <p>'Why discourage yourself about that, madam?' she asked. 'These creatures
  are not to be regarded.'</p>

  <p>'The House of Commons is to be regarded,' returned Lady Strafford.</p>

  <p>She spoke, despite herself, in a tone of respect for the power that
  threatened her husband, and the Frenchwoman's smile deepened.</p>

  <p>'How afraid you all are of this Parliament,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Has it not lately shown that it is something to be afraid of?' cried the
  Countess.</p>

  <p>The Queen continued to carefully select the tiny glass beads and to
  carefully thread them on the long white silk thread. To the Countess, who had
  never loved her, this absorption, at such an hour, in an occupation so
  trivial, was exasperating.</p>

  <p>'I have come to Your Majesty on matter of serious moment,' she said, and
  she spoke as one who had a claim; her husband had rendered great services to
  the Crown, and held his lofty position more by his own genius than by the
  King's favour. 'Yesterday I sent an express to York, beseeching my lord to
  stay there with the army, and to-day Mr. Holles, one of my kinsmen, hath gone
  on the same errand. I beseech Your Majesty to add your weight to these
  entreaties of mine, and to ask His Majesty to bid my lord stay where he is
  safe.'</p>

  <p>At this the Queen's lovely right hand stopped work, and lay slack on the
  white cover of the casket, and with the other she put back the fine ringlets
  of black hair from her brow and looked full and delicately at the
  Countess.</p>

  <p>'Both the King and I,' she returned gently, 'wrote to my lord before
  that&mdash;ay, the day before, and were you more often at court, madame, you
  would have heard of it.'</p>

  <p>An eloquent flush bespoke the relief and gratitude of the Countess.</p>

  <p>Then he is safe!' she exclaimed. 'At York, amid the army, who can touch
  him!'</p>

  <p>The Queen laughed lightly.</p>

  <p>'Dear lady,' she said, 'thy lord is no longer at York, but on his way to
  London. At least, if he be as loyal as I think he be.'</p>

  <p>'London?' repeated Lady Strafford, as if it were a word of terror.
  'London? my lord cometh?'</p>

  <p>'On the bidding of His Majesty and myself,' answered Henriette Marie.</p>

  <p>The Countess rose, she pushed back the dull crimson hood from her fair
  curls, and looked the Queen straightly in the face.</p>

  <p>'Wherefore have you bidden him to London, madame?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'That he may answer the charges that will be brought against him,' said
  the Queen.</p>

  <p>'And you have persuaded him to this!' cried the Countess. 'I did think
  that I might have counted you and His Majesty among my lord's friends!'</p>

  <p>Henriette Marie picked up a knot of white silk and began to disentangle
  the twisted strands.</p>

  <p>'The Earl hath His Majesty's assurances and mine, of friendship and
  protection,' she said with dignity touched with coldness.</p>

  <p>Lady Strafford stood silent, utterly dismayed and bewildered. It seemed to
  her incredible that the King should have asked his hated minister to come to
  the capital at the moment when the popular fury against him had reached full
  height and the Commons were on the eve of impeaching him. She did not, could
  not, doubt that the King would wish to protect his favourite, but she felt an
  awful doubt as to his power. Had he not been forced to call the Parliament at
  the demand of the people?&mdash;was it not to please them that he had sent
  for the Earl?&mdash;so what else might he not consent to when driven into a
  corner!</p>

  <p>The Countess shuddered; she thought of the angry crowd who had chased Laud
  from Lambeth Palace, who daily hooted at and insulted her when she went
  abroad, of the useless train-bands, of the general bottomless confusion and
  tumult, and she saw before her with a horrid vividness, the calm, weary face
  of John Pym, the man who led the Commons.</p>

  <p>The Queen surveyed her narrowly, and observed the doubt and terror in her
  face.</p>

  <p>'Are you afraid?' she asked. 'Is it possible you think the King cannot
  protect his friends?'</p>

  <p>Lady Strafford looked at the beautiful frail woman in her lace and silk
  who was so delicate, so charming, so gay, and who had more power over the
  King than his own conscience, and her heart gave a sick swerve. She never
  had, never could, wholly trust the French Papist Queen, for she was herself
  too wholly open and English in her nature.</p>

  <p>Henriette Marie rose, and the jasmine perfume was stirred by the shaking
  of her garments.</p>

  <p>'Is it not better,' she said, with a lovely, tender smile, 'that Lord
  Strafford should come here and face his enemies than that he should lurk in
  York among his soldiers as if he feared what creatures like this Pym could
  do?'</p>

  <p>'Madame,' returned Lady Strafford, through white lips, 'no one would ever
  think the Earl feared his enemies. But to come to London now is not courage
  but folly.'</p>

  <p>'It is obedience to the King's wishes,' said the Queen, and a haughty fire
  sparkled in her dark liquid eyes.</p>

  <p>'The King,' returned the Countess, 'asketh too much from his servant, by
  Heaven, madame! Those who love my lord would see him stay at York&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And those who love the King would obey him,' flashed Henriette Marie.</p>

  <p>The Countess controlled herself and swept a curtsey.</p>

  <p>'I take my leave,' she said. 'May Your Majesty hold as ever sacred the
  promises with which you have brought my lord in among those who madden to
  destroy him! As for me, my heart is fallen low. Madame, a good night.'</p>

  <p>'I do forgive thy boldness for the sake of thy anxiety,' said the Queen
  with sweetness. 'We women have many desperate moments in these bitter times.
  A good night, my lady.'</p>

  <p>The Countess bent her proud blonde head and departed, and the Queen took
  up her beads and her silks and began again to work the bouquet of roses,
  lilies, and violets she was embroidering on the lid of the casket.</p>

  <p>A thoughtful and haughty expression clouded the delicate lines of her
  face, and this proud pensive look did not alter when the hangings that had
  scarcely fallen into place behind Lady Strafford were again lifted, and the
  King, unattended, and with an air of haste, came into her presence.</p>

  <p>'Has Strafford come? 'she asked.</p>

  <p>'Not yet!' replied Charles, in an unsteady voice, 'and I have begun to
  wish I had not sent for him.'</p>

  <p>The Queen flung down her work and rose; the angry red of a deep passion
  stained her pallor.</p>

  <p>'Canst thou never be resolute?' she cried. 'Wilt thou for ever hesitate
  and change and regret every action? My lord, I would sooner be dead than see
  this temper in thee.'</p>

  <p>The King came and kissed her hand with a charming air of gallantry.</p>

  <p>'Sweet,' he said, in self-justification, 'it is a horrid thing to command
  a man into the hands of his enemies.'</p>

  <p>'Thou knowest,' returned Henriette Marie firmly, 'that the Parliament and
  London both clamour for my lord and will not, by any means, be quiet until he
  appear. Thou knowest that we, that I, am in actual danger.'</p>

  <p>'Hush, dear heart&mdash;speak not of our danger,' interrupted Charles
  hastily, 'lest it seemeth we sacrifice our servant, our friend, to bare
  fear.'</p>

  <p>'Acquit thyself to thy conscience, Charles,' she answered with limitless
  pride. 'Art thou not the King? Must I remind thee of that as even now I had
  to remind my Lady Strafford?'</p>

  <p>'My lady here?' murmured the King.</p>

  <p>'Did you not meet her in your coming?'</p>

  <p>As she spoke Henriette Marie moved towards a mirror that hung in one
  corner, and looked at her reflection with unseeing eyes, then turned the same
  abstracted glance on to the King.</p>

  <p>The mirror was set in a deep border of embroidery which was framed in
  tortoise-shell, and the mellow colours of these, silks and shell, were
  softened into rosy dimness by the shaded light. This same glow was over the
  lovely figure of the Queen, her gown of ivory and amber tints, brightened
  into a knot of orange at her breast, and the pearls round her throat, and her
  soft, dark hair held no more lustre than the exquisite carnation of her
  fragile beauty. She seemed utterly removed from all that was commonplace,
  tumultuous, noisy, coarse, and Charles, gazing at her with his soul in his
  eyes, was spurred and stung, as always when he regarded his wife, with bitter
  anger that he was not allowed to follow the bright guidance of this lady, and
  live with her in rich happiness and peace adorned with every fine and costly
  art, with all the intellectual delicacies and luxurious refinements which so
  pleased them both.</p>

  <p>He loathed the English people who dragged him and even his adored wife
  into the clamorous atmosphere of intrigue and dissension, of controversy and
  riot.</p>

  <p>To Charles there was one God, one Church, one King, one right&mdash;the
  right of God as manifested in the King's right; all else was to him mere
  vexation, disloyalty, and blasphemy. The popular side of the questions now
  rending the nations he did not even consider; he stood absolutely, without
  compromise or doubt, by his own simple, unyielding, ardent belief that he was
  King by God's will, and above and beyond all laws.</p>

  <p>And his late impotency to enforce this view on his subjects had stirred
  his naturally gracious serene nature to deepest astonishment and anger. He
  was baffled, outraged, and inwardly humiliated, and he had already in his
  heart decided to be avenged on these gentlemen of the Commons whose clamours
  had so rudely broken his regal security, and on the stubborn English who had
  taken advantage of the rebellion of the Scots and his lack of money with
  which to defend himself, to force on him this hateful Parliament.</p>

  <p>And now, when he knew that Pym, the inspiration and leader of these unruly
  gentlemen, was daring to strike at his own special friend&mdash;minister and
  favourite, the man who was at once his guide and mouthpiece&mdash;he was
  bewildered by his intense inner fury, and pride as well as justice made him
  regret that he had summoned the Earl to London.</p>

  <p>He gazed at the Queen where she stood in golden shadow, and these thoughts
  tormented him bitterly.</p>

  <p>He knew her mind; her temper was even more despotic than his, and armed
  force was the first and only weapon she would have ever used in dealing with
  the people; her counsels were ever for the high hand, the haughty command,
  the merciless sword, and always the King hearkened to her. But his nature was
  more subtle, involved, and secretive than hers, and he knew better than she
  did the growing strength of the forces opposed to him; therefore he had often
  endeavoured to cope with his difficulties after a fashion she called
  irresolute and unstable.</p>

  <p>The Queen broke the heavy silence.</p>

  <p>'Strafford will come and we will protect him,' she said; 'that is
  enough.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, not enough,' replied Charles, 'for I must be avenged on these men
  who seek to touch my lord.'</p>

  <p>'Hadst thou hearkened to me,' she murmured in a melancholy voice, 'thou
  hadst been avenged on all these long since.'</p>

  <p>'Ay, Mary,' cried the King earnestly, 'we are not in a realm as loyal and
  steadfast as France, but rule a country that hath become a very hive of
  sedition, discontent, and treason, and it is well to tread cautiously.'</p>

  <p>'Caution is not a kingly virtue,' said Henriette Marie, with that same sad
  sweetness of demeanour that was so exquisite a cloak for reproof.</p>

  <p>'Trust me to act as is best for thee and for our sons,' replied Charles
  firmly. 'Trust me to so acquit myself to God as to be worthy of thy
  love.'</p>

  <p>The Queen regarded him with a wise little smile, then pulled a toy watch
  of diamonds from the lace at her bosom and glanced at it with eyes that
  flashed a little.</p>

  <p>'With quick riding and sharp relays, my lord might almost be here,' she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Charles sank into the great chair with arms by the window, and bent his
  gaze on the floor. His whole figure had a drooping and fatigued look; he
  mechanically fingered the deep points of lace edging his cambric cuffs.</p>

  <p>Henriette Marie dropped the watch back behind the knot of orange velvet on
  her breast, and her glance, that was so quick and keen behind the misty
  softness that veiled it, travelled rapidly over her husband's person.</p>

  <p>She noted the grey hairs in his love-locks, the lines of anxiety across
  his brow and round his mouth, his unnatural pallor, the nervous twitching of
  his lips. He was the dearest thing on earth to her, but she had been married
  to him nearly twenty years and she knew his weakness, his faults, too well to
  any longer regard him as that Prince of romance which he had at first
  appeared to her. His figure, as she looked at him now, seemed to her
  strangely tragical; she could have wept for this man who leant on her when
  she should have leant on him, this man whom she would have despised if she
  had not loved.</p>

  <p>'Holy Virgin,' she said passionately to herself, 'give him strength and me
  courage.'</p>

  <p>She went to her table and began to put away her work. The King raised his
  narrowed wistful eyes and said abruptly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Supposing the Earl doth not come? We are as likely to be hounded from
  Whitehall as His Grace from Lambeth if my lord disappoints the people.'</p>

  <p>'He will come,' said Henriette Marie, delicately putting away her beads
  and silks in a tortoise-shell box lined with blue satin and redolent of
  English lavender.</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke and before she had turned the silver key in the casket,
  her page had entered with the momentous news for which they both, in their
  different fashion, waited.</p>

  <p>My Lord Strafford was in the audience chamber, all in a reek from hard
  riding.</p>

  <p>They went down together, the King and Queen, and found the dark Earl, in
  boots and cloak still muddied, waiting for them.</p>

  <p>'My faithful one!' cried Charles, 'so thou art come!' and when Strafford
  would have knelt, he prevented him, and instead kissed him on the cheek.</p>

  <p>'Sire,' answered my lord, 'I met your messengers on the road. I had
  already left York and was hastening to London to meet this accusation mine
  enemies do prepare to spring on me.'</p>

  <p>Charles seized his hand and grasped it warmly.</p>

  <p>'I do approve thine action, and here confirm all expressions of favour I
  have ever given thee.'</p>

  <p>'Thy lady,' added the Queen, smiling, 'was, poor soul, fearful for thee,
  but thou art not, I think, seeing thou hast our protection and
  friendship.'</p>

  <p>'Madame,' answered the Earl, fixing on her the powerful glance of his
  tired dark eyes, 'I am fearful of nothing, I do thank my God, save only of
  some smirch on my honour, and that is surely safe while my gracious master
  holdeth me by the hand.'</p>

  <p>There was energy and purpose in his look, his carriage, his speech, his
  bearing had the unshakable composure of the fine man finely prepared for any
  fate.</p>

  <p>'Sire,' he said, speaking with great sincerity and emotion, 'my own aim
  hath been to make thee and England great, and if His Majesty is satisfied, I
  hold myself acquitted of any wrong to any man, nor do I take any such on my
  conscience.'</p>

  <p>The King, much moved, clasped my lord's firm right hand closer in his own,
  and stood close beside him in intimate affection.</p>

  <p>'What weapon hast thou prepared to fight these rascals with?' asked
  Henriette Marie.</p>

  <p>'Madame,' replied the Earl grimly, 'I shall go down to the House to-morrow
  and impeach John Pym of high treason on the ground of his sympathy with, and
  negotiating with, the rebel Scots.' He smiled fiercely as if to himself, and
  added, <i>'My head or thine,</i> and no time to lose!'</p>

  <p>A sudden tremor shook the Queen, a silence fell on her vivacity.</p>

  <p>'Come to us to-morrow,' said Charles, 'before going to
  Westminster&mdash;and now to thy waiting wife and a good night, dear
  lord.'</p>

  <p>'Truly this evening I am a weary man,' smiled Strafford and with that
  kissed the hands of his lieges and left them.</p>

  <p>They stood silent after his going, not looking at each other.</p>

  <p>They could hear the distant angry clamour of London at their gates.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-05"
     id="ch1-05"></a>CHAPTER V. THE FALL OF THE GREAT MINISTER</h2>

  <p class="first">The moon's circle was half-filled with light, a mist rose
  and hung above the river, a sullen rain was falling through the windless air,
  as the gentlemen left the House and dispersed among the excited crowd to
  their dwellings. Along the river the people were dense, they surged and
  gathered along the banks from Westminster to St. Katherine's wharf, shouting,
  singing, flinging up their hats, and wringing each other's hands for joy.</p>

  <p>They had just been regaled with a sight many of them had never dared to
  hope to see. The mist and the rain had not obscured from their hungry eyes
  the barge in which my Lord Strafford, that morning the greatest subject in
  two kingdoms, had gone by, a prisoner, to the Tower.</p>

  <p>He stood for an absolute monarchy, a dominant priesthood, taxation without
  law, the Star Chamber, the Court of High Commission, even as the Queen stood
  for Papistry and the possible employment of foreign force, and the two
  between them represented all that was most hateful to the English.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was neither the usual levity of crowds nor the usual vulgar
  rejoicing in fallen greatness that animated these dense throngs of Londoners,
  but a deep, almost awful sense that a definite and tremendous struggle had
  begun between King and people, and had begun with a great victory on the
  popular side.</p>

  <p>It had been a day of smouldering excitement that frequently burst into
  riotings between Westminster and Whitehall. In the morning my lord, with a
  guard of halberdiers, had gone down as usual to the House; after a little
  while he had returned to the palace, accompanied each time by the furious
  shouting and groans of the people. The truth was that his charges against Pym
  were not yet ready, and he wished to consult his master.</p>

  <p>The crowd, however, waited, fed by rumours that came from time to time by
  means of those who had the entry into the House; by the afternoon it was
  definitely known that Mr. Pym had cleared the Lobby and locked the door of
  the House, while a discussion of grave importance took place.</p>

  <p>So the people waited, patient but insistent, trusting Mr. Pym and those
  gentlemen shut up with him, yet watchful lest they should cheat them.</p>

  <p>Nor were they disappointed; at five o'clock out came Mr. Pym at the head
  of some three hundred Members, and, passing through the frantically
  applauding crowd, went to the House of Lords.</p>

  <p>Here, at the Bar, he told the Peers, that by the command of the Commons in
  Parliament and in the name of all the Commons of England, he accused the Earl
  of Strafford of high treason, and demanded that he be put in custody while
  they produced the grounds of their accusation.</p>

  <p>Then came my lord again, hastening back from Whitehall (where the news had
  reached him), with an assured and proud demeanour, and so into the House,
  with a gloomy and unseeing countenance for the hostile throng; then more
  suspense, while excitement increased to a point where it could not be any
  longer contained, and vented itself in fierce rattlings on the very doorsteps
  of Westminster Hall and rebellious tumults at the very gates of Whitehall,
  where the guards were doubled and stood with drawn swords, for there had been
  some ugly shouting of the Queen's name, and some hoarse demand that John Pym
  should accuse her also of high treason against the realm of England, and haul
  her forth with her black Papist brood of priests to answer the charges
  against her, even as my lord was answering, or must answer them. Before the
  misty evening was far advanced, and while the moon hung yet sickly pale in a
  scarcely dark sky, the prologue to this tragedy was accomplished, and my lord
  left the House where he had so long ruled supreme, and was conveyed down the
  sullen tide to the Tower.</p>

  <p>And when he had at last gone, and his guarded barge was absorbed into the
  shadows of the Traitor's Gate, a kind of awe and silence fell over London.
  The great minister, the King's favourite, the man who was both his master's
  brain and conscience, had fallen so swiftly, so irrecoverably, as London knew
  in her heart, that there was almost a terror mingled with the triumph; for
  all knew that Strafford was not one like Somerset or Buckingham, but a man of
  the utmost capacity for courage, intelligence, and all the arts of
  government.</p>

  <p>The Commons of Parliament, who had done this thing, scattered, weary and
  quiet, to their various homes and lodgings, and Mr. Cromwell and Mr. Hampden
  walked through the falling rain, communing with their hearts.</p>

  <p>As they neared the palace which stood brilliant with flambeaux lights
  flashing on the drawn swords at the gates, Mr. Hampden turned his gentle face
  towards his companion and said, 'What will the King do?'</p>

  <p>'The King?' repeated Mr. Cromwell, lifting earnest eyes to the silent
  palace. 'I would I could come face to face with the King&mdash;surely he is a
  man who might be persuaded of the truth of things if he were not so
  surrounded by frivolous, wrong, and wanton counsellors.'</p>

  <p>'I believe,' answered John Hampden, 'that His Majesty rooteth his
  pretences so firmly in Divine Right&mdash;(being besides upheld in this by
  all the clergy), that he would consider it blasphemy to abate one jot of his
  claims. See this pass we are come to, Mr. Cromwell; we deal with a man with
  whom no compromise is possible&mdash;ask Mr. Pym, who tried to serve
  him&mdash;he will excuse himself, he will shift and turn, but he will never
  give way, and when he is most quiet he will always break his tranquillity
  with some monstrous imprudence, as this late forcing of the Archbishop's
  prayer book on the Scots, thereby provoking a peaceable nation into
  rebellion.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell turned up the collar of his cloak, for the cold dampness of
  the night was increasing, and he was liable to rheumatism. He made no answer,
  and Mr. Hampden, glancing expectantly at his thoughtful face, repeated his
  query&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What will the King do now?'</p>

  <p>'What can he do?' replied the Member for Cambridge. 'Strafford falleth
  through serving him, and likely enough came to London on promise of the
  King's protection. The King will stand by Strafford.'</p>

  <p>'Then it will remain to be seen which is the stronger&mdash;Parliament or
  His Majesty,' said John Hampden, and he sighed as if he foresaw ahead a long
  and bitter struggle. 'I tell thee this,' he added, with an earnestness almost
  sad, 'that if the people are disappointed of justice on my lord, the King is
  not safe in his own capital, nor yet the Queen. Thou hast observed, Mr.
  Cromwell, how well hated the Queen is?'</p>

  <p>'A Papist and a Frenchwoman,' replied the other, 'how could she hope for
  English loyalty? And she is meddling&mdash;of all things the English hate a
  meddling woman. Her ways might do well in France, but here we like them not.
  I am sorry for my Lady Strafford,' he added irrelevantly, and with a strange
  note of tenderness in his rough voice. 'What are all these issues to her? Yet
  she must suffer for them. I saw her yesterday, and she was as still for
  terror as a chased deer fallen spent of breath, and yet had the courage to
  move and speak with pride, poor gentlewoman!'</p>

  <p>'We shall see many piteous things before England be tranquil,' returned
  Mr. Hampden sadly. 'Chief among them this discomfiture of patient women. The
  Lord support them.'</p>

  <p>They were now at Mr. Cromwell's door.</p>

  <p>'Wilt thou come up, my cousin?' he asked, laying a detaining hand on the
  other's damp coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>'This evening hold me excused,' answered Mr. Hampden. 'I have some country
  gentlemen at my entertainment, and I would not disappoint them.'</p>

  <p>So they parted as quietly as if this momentous day had held nothing of
  note, and Mr. Cromwell went up to his modest chamber and lit the candles and
  placed them on a writing-table which held a Bible among the quills and
  papers. He stood for a while thoughtfully; he had flung off his mantle and
  his hat, and his well-made, strong figure showed erect in a plain, rather
  ill-cut, suit of dark green cloth, his band and cuffs were of linen, and
  there was no single ornament nor an inch of lace about his whole attire;
  indeed, his lack of the ordinary elegancies of a gentleman's costume would
  have seemed to some an affectation, and to all a sure indication that he had
  now definitely joined the increasingly powerful Puritan party which had set
  itself to destroy every vestige of ornament in England&mdash;from Bishops to
  lace handkerchiefs, as their opponents sneeringly remarked. These enemies
  were not, perhaps, in a humour for sneering to-night when the chief of them
  lay straightened between prison walls. So thought Mr. Cromwell as he stood
  thoughtfully before the little table that bore the Bible, and looked down on
  the closed covers.</p>

  <p>Above the table hung a mirror; the glass was old and cracked, and into the
  frame were stuck various papers which showed how the present possessor of the
  room disregarded the original use of the mirror. Sufficient of the glass,
  however, remained unobscured to reflect the head and shoulders of Oliver
  Cromwell, and this reflection, with the dark background and the blurred
  surface of the glass, was like a fine portrait, and by reason of the absolute
  consciousness of the man, like a portrait of his soul as well as of his
  features.</p>

  <p>His expression was at once fierce and tender and deeply thoughtful; the
  brow, so carelessly shaded by the disordered brown hair, was free from any
  lines, the grey eyes seemed as if they looked curiously into the future, the
  lips were lightly set together, and seemed as if they might at any minute
  quiver into speech, the line of his jaw and cheek had a look of serene
  fierceness, like the noble idea of strength given by the jaw of a lion.</p>

  <p>So he looked, reflected in the old mirror and lit by the two common
  candles, and if one had suddenly glanced over his shoulder into the glass and
  seen that face, they would have thought they looked at a painting of abstract
  qualities, not at a compound human being, at this moment so utterly was his
  rugged look of strength and fortitude spiritualized by the radiance of the
  soul within.</p>

  <p>Outside the rain fell and there was no sound but the drip of the drops on
  the sill; the great city was silent after the tumult of the day, most people
  were eating, sleeping, going their ways as if there was no King humiliated
  utterly, raging in his chamber; no Queen weeping among her priests; no great
  man in prison writing to his wife: 'Hold up your heart, look to the children
  and your house, and at last, by God's good pleasure, we shall have our
  deliverance'; no quiet gentleman from Huntingdon standing in a quiet room and
  meditating things that would change this city and this land as it had not
  been changed since it bore the yoke of kingship.</p>

  <p>To the many, even to Mr. Pym and Mr. Hampden, the fall of Strafford might
  seem a tremendous thing, a shrewd blow against tyranny and a daring act, but
  to this younger man, with his deeper, more mystical, religious fervour, his
  practical and immeasurable courage, the sweeping aside of the King's
  favourite was but the first of many acts that would utterly alter the face of
  England.</p>

  <p>Strafford might have gone, but there were other things to
  go&mdash;Papistry, the Star Chamber, ship-money, and other civil wrongs,
  bishops, prayer books, church ornaments and choirs, and other pollutions of
  the pure faith of Christ, and there was a burning blazing ideal to be
  followed&mdash;the ideal of what might be made of England in moral worth, in
  civic liberty, in that domestic dignity and foreign power that had made the
  reign of Elizabeth Tudor splendid throughout the world.</p>

  <p>This might be done; but how was a poor country gentleman, untrained in
  diplomacy or war, to accomplish it?</p>

  <p>How dare he presume that he was meant to accomplish it?</p>

  <p>He moved from the table abruptly and, going to the window, rested his head
  against the frame and stared through the soiled panes into the dark street
  where the lights glimmered sparsely at long intervals in the heavy winter
  air.</p>

  <p>He recalled and clung to the memory of the vision that he had had in the
  old barn outside St. Ives; the certainty that he was in covenant with the
  Lord to do the Lord's work in England had pierced his soul with the same
  sharpness as a dagger might pierce the flesh. At times the remembered glamour
  faded, weariness, misgivings, would cloud the glorious conviction&mdash;yet
  deep-rooted in his noble spirit it remained. God had spoken to him and he was
  to do God's works,&mdash;but the practical humanity in him, the strong
  English sense and sound judgment demanded&mdash;how?</p>

  <p>He was of full middle age and unaccomplished in anything save farming and
  such knowledge of the law as less than a year's training could give him. His
  education had been the usual education of a gentleman, but he had less
  learning than most, for his college days had been short, owing to the death
  of his father and the sudden call to responsibilities, and he had absolutely
  no love for any of the arts and sciences. How then was he equipped to combat
  the immense powers arrayed against him&mdash;the King, the Church, immemorial
  tradition, custom, usage, the weight of aristocracy, the example of
  Europe&mdash;for his design, though yet vague, was to create in England a
  constitution for Church and State for which he could see no pattern anywhere
  within the world.</p>

  <p>He felt no greatness in himself, he was even doubtful of his own capacity.
  Though he was already much hearkened to, principally, he thought, by reason
  of his connexion with Hampden and the vast number of relations he had in the
  House, still, on the few occasions when he had spoken in public, as when he
  had taken up the cause of the Fen people in the late question of the drainage
  scheme, his ardour and impetuosity had gone far to spoil his cause, and he
  was well behind, in political weight and party influence, such men as Pym and
  Hampden and even Falkland and Hyde, Holles and Haselrig, Culpeper and
  Strode.</p>

  <p>Yet with trumpet rhythm there beat on his brain&mdash;'Something to do and
  I to do it! Work to be done and I to accomplish it! Something to be gained
  and I to gain it! The Lord's battles to be fought and I to fight them!'</p>

  <p>He moved from the window; the room was cold and the candles burnt with a
  tranquil frosty light. Mr. Cromwell went to the great book lying between the
  two plain brass sticks, the only book he ever read, the book in which, to
  him, was comprised the whole of life and all we know of the earth, of hell,
  of heaven.</p>

  <p>He opened the Bible at random; the thick leaves fell back at the psalms,
  and his passionate grey eyes fell on a sentence that he read aloud with a
  deep note of triumph in his heavy masculine voice&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>'O help us against the enemy; for vain is the help of man. Through God
  we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
  enemies.'</i></p>

  <p>'Through...God,' repeated Mr. Cromwell, 'we...shall do...<i>great</i>
  acts.'</p>

  <p>He put his hand to the plain little sword at his side, that had hitherto
  been of no use save to give evidence of his gentility on market days at
  Huntingdon and Ely...'<i>Great</i> acts,' he repeated again.</p>

  <p>As he stood so, his right hand crossed to his sword, his left resting on
  the open Bible, his chin sunk on to his breast and his whole face softened
  and veiled with thought, he was not conscious of the humble room, the patter
  of the rain, the two coarse candles poorly dispelling the darkness. He was
  only aware of a sudden access of power, a revival of the burning sensation
  that had come to him in the old barn perfumed with hay at St. Ives.</p>

  <p>His doubts and confusions, misgivings and fears, vanished, this inner
  conviction and power seemed sufficient to combat all the foes concealed in
  the quiet city&mdash;all, even to the King himself...</p>

  <p>He went to his knees as swiftly as if smitten into that attitude.</p>

  <p>'Through God,' he whispered, 'we shall do <i>great</i> acts.'</p>

  <p>He hid his strong face in his strong hands and prayed.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-06"
     id="ch1-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE KING FAILS</h2>

  <p class="first">November had turned to May and my Lord Strafford's public
  agony was over; he lay in the Tower a condemned man.</p>

  <p>For seventeen days had he, in this most momentous trial of his, defended
  himself, unaided, against thirteen accusers who relieved each other, and with
  such skill that his impeachment was like to have miscarried; but the Commons
  were not so to be baulked.</p>

  <p>They dare not let Strafford escape them; they feared an Irish army, a
  French army, they feared the desperate King would dissolve them, they feared
  another gunpowder plot, and twice, on a cracking of the floor, fled their
  Chamber. All fears, all anxieties, all animosities were at their sharpest
  edge; the crowds in the streets demanded the blood of Strafford, and did not
  pause to add that if they were disappointed they would not hesitate to
  satisfy themselves with more exalted victims.</p>

  <p>A Bill of attainder against my lord was brought forward and hurried
  through Parliament. Pym and Hampden opposed it, but popular fear and popular
  rage were stronger than they, and there was no hope for Strafford save in the
  master whom he was condemned for serving. He wrote to the King, urging him to
  pass the Bill for the sake of England's peace.</p>

  <p>London became more and more exasperated; rumours flew thick: the King's
  son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, was coming with an army; money was being
  sent from the French King; the Irish, that ancient nightmare, were to be let
  loose; the Queen had raised a troop to attack the Keys of the Kingdom and set
  my lord free by force from the Tower.</p>

  <p>The Bill was passed, and on a May morning sent up for the King's
  assent.</p>

  <p>He had, a week before, sent a message to the Lords, beseeching them not to
  press upon his conscience, on which he could not condemn his minister.</p>

  <p>But the appeal had failed; Lords, Commons, and people all waited eagerly,
  angrily, threateningly, for the King's assent.</p>

  <p>He asked a day to consider; he sent for three bishops and, in great agony
  of mind, asked their ghostly counsel. Usher and Juxon told him Strafford was
  innocent and that he should not sign. Williams bid him bow to the opinion of
  the judges, and bade him listen to the thunderous tumult at his gates. London
  was roused, he said, and would not be pacified until my lord's head fell on
  Tower Hill.</p>

  <p>So the hideous day wore on to evening, and the King had not signed.</p>

  <p>As the delay continued, the suspense and agitation in the city became
  almost unbearable, and it took all the efforts of the royal guards to hold
  the gates of the Palace.</p>

  <p>The King was locked into his private cabinet, and even the Queen had not
  seen him since noon.</p>

  <p>Henriette Marie had passed the earlier part of the day with her younger
  children. She had made several vain attempts to see the King and she had
  denied herself to all, even to Lady Strafford and her frantic
  supplications.</p>

  <p>She had many agents continually employed, and during the day they came to
  her and reported upon the feeling in the Houses, in the city, and in the
  streets.</p>

  <p>She saw, from these advices, that the King's situation was little better
  than desperate. She saw another thing&mdash;<i>there was not, at that moment,
  sufficient force available in the capital to control the multitude</i>. They
  were, in fact, at the mercy of the populace.</p>

  <p>When the haze of spring twilight began to fall over the stocks and lilies,
  violets and pinks in the gardens sloping to the river, still flashing in the
  sinking sun, and the first breaths of evening were wafted through the open
  windows of the Palace, delicious with the perfume of these beds of sweets,
  the Queen went herself and alone to the cabinet where the King kept his
  anguished vigil.</p>

  <p>For a while he would not open, even to the sound of her voice, but after
  she had waited there a little, like a supplicant, she heard his step, the key
  was turned, and he admitted her. She entered swiftly and flung herself at his
  feet, as she had done at their first meeting nearly twenty years ago, when he
  had lifted her young loveliness to his heart, there to for ever remain.</p>

  <p>Now she was a worn woman, her beauty prematurely obscured by distresses,
  and he was far different from the radiant cavalier who had welcomed her to
  England, but the fire of love lit then in the heart of each had not abated;
  even now, in the midst of his misery of mind, he raised her up as tenderly,
  as reverently, as when she had first come to him.</p>

  <p>'Mary,' he said brokenly, 'Mary.'</p>

  <p>He kissed her cold cheek as he drew her to his shoulder, and she felt his
  tears.</p>

  <p>But her mood was not one of weeping; her frail figure, her delicate
  features, were alert and quivering with energy; her large vivid eyes glanced
  eagerly round the room. On the King's private black and gold Chinese bureau
  lay the warrant for my Lord Strafford's execution. So hasty and resolved was
  the Parliament, also, perhaps, so confidant of their power to force the
  King's assent, that the warrant had been sent before the royal consent had
  been given to the Bill.</p>

  <p>The Queen drew herself away from Charles and rested her glance on him. She
  wore a white gown enriched with silver damask flowers, her face, too, was
  colourless save for a feverish flush under her eyes, and the long-admired
  black locks hung neglected and disarranged over her deep lace collar. She was
  a sorrowful and reproachful figure as she stood regarding him so
  intently.</p>

  <p>The King's white sick face, too, wore a look of utter suffering, in his
  narrowed eyes was a bitterness beyond sorrow.</p>

  <p>'Sire,' said the Queen in a formal tone,'you shut yourself up here when it
  would more befit you to come forth and face what must be faced.' She set her
  teeth, 'The people are at the very gates.'</p>

  <p>Charles took a step back against the heavy brocaded hangings of the
  wall.</p>

  <p>I will not sign&mdash;no&mdash;I will not assent,' he muttered.</p>

  <p>'Will not? Will not?' cried the Queen. 'Charles, thou hast no choice.'</p>

  <p>Dost thou advise me to do this infamous thing?' answered the King in a
  terrible voice. He is my friend, his peril is through serving me; and he
  trusts me, relies on me&mdash;that is enough. Even as you came I had resolved
  that, not even to save my sacred Crown, would I abandon Strafford.'</p>

  <p>'And what of me and my children?' asked the Queen, in a still voice; 'do
  we come after thy servant? Is thy love for me grown so halting that I come
  last?'</p>

  <p>The King winced.</p>

  <p>'Who would touch thee?' he murmured.</p>

  <p>'Even those who, now outside this very palace, cry insults against the
  Papist and the Frenchwoman. Charles, I tell thee this is playing on the edge
  of a revolution&mdash;are we all to go to ruin for Strafford's sake?'</p>

  <p>'He went to ruin for mine,' replied the King.</p>

  <p>'He failed,' said the Queen, 'and he pays. When we fail, we too will pay.
  But this is not our time. The people demand Strafford, and we will not risk
  our Crowns and lives by refusing this demand.'</p>

  <p>'He trusts me,' repeated Charles, 'and I do love him. He served me well,
  he was loyal...our God help me!...my friend&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He turned away to hide the uncontrollable tears, and, opening a drawer in
  the little Chinese cabinet, fumbled blindly among some papers and pulled out
  a letter.</p>

  <p>'This is what he wrote me,' he faltered. 'I have never had one like him in
  my service...Mary...I cannot let him die.'</p>

  <p>He sank into a chair and, resting his elbow on the arm of it, dropped his
  face into his hand; the other held the letter of my lord written from the
  Tower.</p>

  <p>The Queen had read this epistle; at the time it had moved her, but now
  that sensation of generous pity was dried up in the fierce desire to save her
  husband and herself from all the ruin a revolution threatened. She went up to
  the King and took the letter from his inert fingers, and, glancing over it,
  read aloud a passage&mdash;</p>

  <p>'"Sir, my consent shall more acquit you herein to God, than all the world
  can do besides. To a willing man there is no injury done; and as by God's
  grace I forgive all the world with calmness and meekness of infinite
  contentment to my dislodging soul, so, sir, to you I can give the life of
  this world with all the cheerfulness imaginable, in the just acknowledgment
  of your exceeding favours."&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Hear!' added the Queen breathlessly, 'the man himself does not ask nor
  expect this sacrifice of you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Charles interrupted.</p>

  <p>'Because he is magnanimous, shall I be a slavish coward?</p>

  <p>'He is willing to die,' urged the Queen; 'he is pleased to give his life
  for you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Willing to die? Where is there a man willing to die? There is none to be
  found, however old, wretched, or mean. Deceive not thyself, Strafford is
  young, strong, full of joy and life&mdash;he hath a wife and children and
  others dear to him&mdash;is it like that he is <i>willing</i> to die?'</p>

  <p>The Queen's eyes did not sink before the miserable reproach in her
  husband's gaze.</p>

  <p>Willing or no, he <i>must</i> die,' she said firmly. 'He must go. Stand
  not in the way of his fate.'</p>

  <p>'He shall not die through me,' said Charles, with a bitter doggedness. 'Am
  I never to sleep sound again for thinking of how I abandoned this man? He
  came to London, Mary, on our promise of protection.'</p>

  <p>'We have done what we could,' returned Henriette Marie, unmoved, 'and now
  we can do no more.'</p>

  <p>'I will not,' said the King, as if repeating the words gave him strength.
  'I will not. Do they want everything I love&mdash;first Buckingham&mdash;now
  Strafford&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Then me,' flashed the Queen. 'Think of that, if you think of your wife at
  all.'</p>

  <p>This reproach was so undeserved as to be grotesque. In all the King's
  concerns, from the most important to the most foolish, she had always come
  foremost, and this was the first occasion on which he had not absolutely
  thrown himself on her judgment and bowed to her desires.</p>

  <p>Some such reflection must have crossed his tortured mind.</p>

  <p>'You always disliked Strafford,' was all he said.</p>

  <p>'No,' said the Queen vehemently, as if she disclaimed some shameful thing.
  'No, never, and I would have saved him. Do not take me to be so mean and
  creeping a creature as to counsel you pass this Bill because I hate my
  lord.'</p>

  <p>She was justified in her defence; she had been jealous of the powerful
  minister, and she had never personally liked him, but it was not for
  vengeance or malice that she urged the King to abandon Strafford, but because
  she was afraid of that power which asked for his death, and because her
  tyrannical royal pride detested the thought that she and hers should be in an
  instant's danger for the sake of a subject. And when she saw her husband, for
  the first time since their marriage, so absorbed in anguished thought as to
  be scarcely aware of her presence, as to be forgetful of her and her
  children, she felt jealous of this other influence that seemed to defy hers,
  and a fierceness that was akin to cruelty touched her desperation.</p>

  <p>'Who is this man that I should be endangered for his sake?' she cried,
  after she had in vain waited for the King to break his dismal silence.</p>

  <p>'He is my friend,' muttered Charles.</p>

  <p>'Save him then, or share his fate,' returned his wife bitterly. 'As for
  me, I will go to my own country, and there find the protection that you
  cannot give me.'</p>

  <p>Charles sprang up and faced her.</p>

  <p>'Mary, what is this? What do you speak of?' he cried in a distracted
  voice, and holding out to her his irresolute hands.</p>

  <p>The Queen took advantage of this sudden weakening of his silent defences;
  her whole manner changed. She went up to him softly, took his hands in hers,
  and, raising to him a face pale and pleading, broke out into eager and humble
  entreaties.</p>

  <p>'My Charles, let him go&mdash;let us be happy again&mdash;do not, for this
  scruple, risk everything! My dear, give way&mdash;it must be&mdash;we are in
  danger&mdash;oh, listen to me!'</p>

  <p>He stared at her with eyes clouded with suffering.</p>

  <p>'Couldst thou but put this eloquence on the other side I might be a
  happier man,' he said. 'Strengthen my conscience, do not weaken it.'</p>

  <p>His tone was as pleading as hers had been, but she perceived that he was
  still obdurate on the main part of her entreaty, and she slipped from his
  clasp and knelt at his feet in a genuine passion of tears.</p>

  <p>'You have had the last of me!' she sobbed. 'I will not stay where neither
  my dignity nor my life is safe. Keep Strafford and let me go!'</p>

  <p>The King turned away with feeble and unsteady steps, and going to the
  window pulled aside the olive velvet curtains.</p>

  <p>The twilight had fallen and the sky was pale to colourlessness; low on the
  horizon, beyond the river, sombre banks of clouds were rising, and at the
  edge of them, floating free in the purity of the sky, was the evening star,
  sparkling with the frosty light of Northern climes.</p>

  <p>The King fixed his eyes on this star, but without hope of comfort; cold
  and disdainful seemed star and heavens, and God pitiless and very far away
  behind the storm-clouds.</p>

  <p>There was no command, no excuse, no reproof for him from on High; in his
  own heart the decision must be and now&mdash;at once&mdash;within the next
  hour. At that moment life seemed unutterably hateful to the King; everything
  in the world, even the figure of his wife, he viewed with a touch of sick
  disgust; the taint of what he was about to do was already over him, his life
  was already stained with baseness, his happiness corrupted.</p>

  <p>He knew, as he stared at the icy star that was already being veiled by the
  on-rushing vapours of the rain-cloud, that he would abandon Strafford.</p>

  <p>Though he knew that it would be better to be that man in the Tower,
  against whose ardent life the decree had gone forth, than himself in his
  palace, secure by the sacrifice of that faithful servant; though he knew that
  in the bloody grave of his betrayed friend would be entombed for ever his own
  tranquillity and peace of mind, yet he also knew that it was not in him to
  stand firm against those inexorable ones who demanded Strafford, against the
  tears and reproaches of his wife, against his own inner fears and weaknesses
  which whispered to him dread and terror of these hateful Parliament men and
  of this mutinous city of London.</p>

  <p>In his heart he had always known that he would fail Strafford if it ever
  came to a sharp issue, yea, he had known it when he urged his minister to
  come from York, and that made this moment the more awful, that his secret
  weakness which he had never admitted to himself, was forced into life.</p>

  <p>He would forsake Strafford to buy the safety of his Crown, his family, his
  person, and Strafford would forgive him (he could picture the look of
  incredulous pity on the condemned man's dark face when the sentence was read
  to him), and the Parliament would scorn him.</p>

  <p>Through the entanglement of his bitter and humiliating reflections, he
  became aware of the sound of the persistent low sobbing of the Queen in the
  darkening room behind him, and he turned, letting the curtains fall together
  over the fading heavens, the brightening star, the oncoming storm.</p>

  <p>The scanty light that now filled the chamber was only enough to let him
  discern the white blur of his wife's figure as she knelt before one of the
  brocade chairs with her dark head lost in the shadows and her hands upraised
  in a startling position of prayer.</p>

  <p>Her sobs, even and continuous as the breaths of a peaceful sleeper, filled
  the rich chamber, the splendours of which were now gloomed over with shadow,
  with sorrow.</p>

  <p>Presently, as he watched her, and as he listened, the grim sharpness of
  his anguish was melted into a weak grief at her distress; his impotency to
  protect her from tears became his main torment.</p>

  <p>'Mary,' he said, 'Mary&mdash;it is over&mdash;think no more of it&mdash;go
  to bed and sleep in peace. London shall be content to-night.'</p>

  <p>He stumbled towards her, and she rose up swiftly and straightly, holding
  her rag of wet white handkerchief to her wet white face.</p>

  <p>'Ah, Charles!' she exclaimed, her voice thick from her weeping.</p>

  <p>She held out her arms, he took her to his heart and bowed his shamed head
  on her shoulder; but after a very little while he put her away.</p>

  <p>'Leave me now!'</p>

  <p>'This thing must be done at once&mdash;to-night&mdash;I cannot tell how
  long they can hold the gates&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I must go out,' said Charles, with utmost weariness 'get me a light, my
  dear, my beloved.'</p>

  <p>She found the flint and tinder and, with deftness and expedition, lit the
  lamp of crystal and silver gilt which stood on the King's private bureau.</p>

  <p>As the soft, gracious flame illumined the room, the King, who was leaning
  against the tapestry like a sick man, looked at once towards the fatal paper
  and beside it the pen and ink dish ready.</p>

  <p>The Queen stood waiting; her face was all blotted and swollen with
  weeping; she looked a frail and piteous figure; her youth seemed suddenly in
  one day dead, and her beauty already a thing of yesterday.</p>

  <p>'It is well I love thee,' said Charles, otherwise what I do would make
  hell for me. Oh, if I had not loved thee, never, never would I have done this
  thing!'</p>

  <p>'We shall forget it,' answered the Queen, 'and we shall live,' she added,
  straining her hoarse voice to a note of passion, 'to avenge ourselves.'</p>

  <p>She spoke to a man of a nature absolutely unforgiving, and at this moment
  her mention of vengeance came like comfort to his anguish and palliation of
  his baseness.</p>

  <p>'I will never forget, I will never pardon,' he swore, lifting up his hand
  towards heaven. 'Never, never shall there be peace between me and Parliament
  until this shame is covered over with blood.'</p>

  <p>He snatched up the warrant with trembling hand.</p>

  <p>'Send some lords to me,' he cried. 'I cannot sign this myself&mdash;get it
  done&mdash;bring this most hateful day to an end!'</p>

  <p>He sank into the chair on which her tears had fallen, and stared at the
  paper clutched in his fingers as if it was a sight of horror.</p>

  <p>Henriette Marie hastened away to tell the waiting deputies of the Houses
  that the King would pass the Bill, and as she went she heard a cry intense
  enough to have carried to the Tower where my lord sat waiting the news of his
  fate.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Strafford! Strafford! my friend!'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-07"
     id="ch1-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. AUTUMN, 1641</h2>

  <p class="first">'Things go too far and too fast for me, and though men speak
  of the progress we make, to me it seemeth more like a progress into
  calamities unspeakable.'</p>

  <p>The young man who spoke leant against the dark-blue and gold diapered wall
  of the antechamber to the House of Commons, in Westminster Hall; members and
  their friends were passing to and fro; in a few days the memorable and
  triumphant session would adjourn. The King was in Scotland, employed, as the
  Parliament well knew, in one of his innumerable intrigues, this time an
  endeavour to bring a Northern army into London. The Scots, since the
  imperfect peace he had patched with them, remained his chief hope. Mr.
  Hampden was in Edinburgh watching him, but Mr. Pym remained in London, the
  mainspring of the popular party.</p>

  <p>It was late August of the year my Lord Strafford ('putting off my doublet
  as cheerfully now as I ever did when I went to my bed,' he had said), had
  walked to his death on Tower Hill. Archbishop Laud was a prisoner, and the
  King had given his consent to a series of Acts which swept away those
  grievances which the people had complained of, and, most momentous of all, he
  had passed a law by which it was impossible for him to dissolve Parliament
  without its own consent.</p>

  <p>Therefore it might seem that affairs had never been so bright and hopeful
  for the leaders of the reforming party, and yet this young gentleman, leaning
  against the wall and staring at the pool of sunlight the Gothic window cast
  at his feet, spoke in a tone of melancholy and foreboding.</p>

  <p>He had always been a close follower and friend of Pym and Hampden; and
  always ardent for the public good&mdash;one of the keen, swift spirits whose
  direct courage had helped the House to triumph, but now he stood dejected and
  rather in the attitude of one who has suffered defeat.</p>

  <p>His companion, who was but a few years older, regarded him with a
  thoughtful air, then glanced dubiously at the crowds which filled the chamber
  and from which they, in the corner by the window, stood a little apart.</p>

  <p>'I take your meaning,' he replied, after a considerable pause. 'I see a
  bigger cleavage between King and people than I, for one, ever meant there to
  be, and prospects of a division in this nation which will be a long while
  healing.'</p>

  <p>He bent his gaze on the other side of the chamber where Mr. Pym and Mr.
  Cromwell were talking loudly and at great length together.</p>

  <p>If any casual observer had looked in at this assembly, assuredly it would
  have been this man by the window at whom they would have glanced longest and
  oftenest.</p>

  <p>His appearance would have been noticeable in any gathering, for it was one
  of the most unusual beauty and charm.</p>

  <p>He was no more than thirty years of age, and the delicate smoothness of
  his countenance was such as belongs to even earlier years, and gave him,
  indeed, an air of almost feminine refinement and gentleness; his long
  love-locks were pale brown, his heavy lidded eyes of a soft and changeable
  grey, and the expression of his lips, set firmly under the slight shade of
  the fashionable moustaches, was one of great sweetness.</p>

  <p>The whole expression of his face was a tenderness and purity seldom seen
  in masculine traits; yet in no way did he appear weak, and his bearing showed
  energy and resolution.</p>

  <p>His dress, of an olive green, was carefully enriched with rough gold
  embroidery, and his linen, laces, and other appointments were of a finer
  quality than those worn by the other gentlemen there.</p>

  <p>Such was Lucius Carey, my Lord Viscount Falkland, one of the noblest, in
  degree and soul, of those who had combined to curb and confine the tyranny of
  the King.</p>

  <p>His companion was Mr. Edward Hyde, an ordinary looking blonde gentleman,
  inclined to stoutness, and a prominent member of the more moderate section of
  the dominant Commons.</p>

  <p>He followed the direction of the Viscount's gaze and remarked, in a low
  tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Those two are getting matters very, much into their own hands, and Mr.
  Cromwell, at least, is too extreme.'</p>

  <p>'What more do they want?' asked my Lord Falkland. 'The King hath redressed
  the grievances we laboured under. They strained the very utmost of the law
  (nay, more than the law) on the Earl of Strafford, and to push matters
  further smacks of disloyalty to His Majesty.'</p>

  <p>'My Lord,' answered Mr. Hyde firmly, 'reformers are ever apt to run a
  headlong course, and some excesses must be excused those who have so laboured
  at the general good&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Excesses?' answered my lord, flushing a little. 'I am still an Anglican,
  by the grace of God, and when I see altars dragged from their places, rood
  screens smashed, all pictures, images, and carvings destroyed in our churches
  until God's houses look as if they were the poor remnants of a besieged
  city,&mdash;when I know that this is by order of Parliament, then methinks it
  seemeth as if violence had taken the place of zeal.'</p>

  <p>'Neither do these things please me,' answered Mr. Hyde, 'but the dams are
  broken and there are swift tides running in all directions. And who is to
  stem them?'</p>

  <p>'Or who,' asked my lord sadly, 'to guide them into proper channels? Not
  your "root and branch men," who would sweep every bishop and every prayer
  book out of the land. Not by such intolerance or bigotry, Mr. Hyde, are we to
  gain peace and liberty.'</p>

  <p>'Moderate counsels,' returned the other, 'own but a weak voice in these
  bitter savoured times. It is such as this Oliver Cromwell, with their loud
  rude speech, who are hearkened to.'</p>

  <p>'I only half like this noisy Mr. Cromwell,' said my lord. 'He hath sprung
  very suddenly into notice, and seemeth to have, on an instant, gained much
  authority with Mr. Pym and Mr. Hampden.'</p>

  <p>At this moment the object of their speech turned his head and looked at
  them as if he had heard his own name. Lord Falkland smiled at him and made a
  little gesture of beckoning.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell instantly left his friends and came over to the window, where
  he stood in the gold flush of sunshine and looked keenly at the two young
  aristocrats.</p>

  <p>'More plots, eh,' he asked pleasantly.</p>

  <p>'More talk only, sir,' smiled the Viscount.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell laid his heavy muscular hand on my lord's arm.</p>

  <p>'Thou art worthy,' he remarked; 'but what shall I say of thee?' his
  narrowed grey eyes rested on Mr. Hyde's florid face. 'Thou art he who bloweth
  neither hot nor cold.'</p>

  <p>'I am like to blow hot enough, I think,' returned Mr. Hyde, 'unless thou
  blow more cold.'</p>

  <p>'Wherein have I vexed thee?' asked Oliver Cromwell, with a pleasantness
  that might have covered contempt.</p>

  <p>'Your party is too extreme, sir,' said the Viscount earnestly. 'You press
  too hard upon the weakness of His Majesty. What we set out to gain hath been
  gained and safeguarded by law. You should now go moderately, and, from what I
  know of your councils, you do not propose moderation.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell's face hardened into heavy, almost lowering lines.</p>

  <p>'So you, too, slacken!' he exclaimed. 'You would join those who rise up
  against us! Fie, my lord, I had better hopes.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell,' returned the Viscount, 'we have been long together on the
  same road; but if your mind is what I do think it to be, then here we come to
  a parting, and many Christian gentlemen will follow my way.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell regarded him with intense keenness.</p>

  <p>'What do you think my mind to be?' he demanded.</p>

  <p>'I think you rush forward to utterly destroy the Anglican Church and to so
  limit the King's authority that he is no more than a show piece in the
  realm.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe that and maybe more than that,' returned Mr. Cromwell. 'Even as the
  Lord directeth; "He shall send down from on high to fetch me and shall take
  me out of many waters." I stand here, a poor instrument, waiting His
  will.'</p>

  <p>This answer bore the fervent and ambiguous character that Lord Falkland
  had noticed in this gentleman's speeches, and which might be due either to
  enthusiasm or guile, and which was, at least, difficult to answer.</p>

  <p>'You run too much against the King,' said Mr. Hyde, 'and against the
  Church of England. Our aim was to clear her of abuses, not to destroy
  her.'</p>

  <p>'Our aim, Mr. Hyde?' interrupted the Member for Cambridge keenly. 'Were
  our aims ever the same, from the very first? I saw one thing, you another;
  but trouble me not now with this vain discourse,' he added, with a note of
  great strength in his hoarse voice, 'when I know you are in communication
  with His Majesty and but seek an opportunity to leave us.'</p>

  <p>Edward Hyde flushed, but answered at once and with pride.</p>

  <p>'I make no secret of it that, if the Parliament forget all duty to the
  King, I shall not.'</p>

  <p>'Are you afraid?' asked Mr. Cromwell, with more sadness than contempt. 'Or
  do you look for promotion and honours from His Majesty? There is no
  satisfaction in such glory, "but hope thou in the Lord and He shall promote
  thee, that thou shalt possess the land; when the ungodly shall perish, thou
  shalt see it."'</p>

  <p>'You do us wrong!' exclaimed Lord Falkland. 'We hold to loyalty; we think
  of that and not of base rewards.'</p>

  <p>'Loyalty!' exclaimed Mr. Cromwell vehemently. 'We own loyalty to One
  higher than the King, yet what saith St. Paul; "See then that Ye walk
  circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, because the days are evil.
  Wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
  Therefore we go not definitely against His Majesty, but rather wait, hoping
  still for peaceable issues and fair days, yet abating nothing of our just
  demands nor of our high hopes.'</p>

  <p>'Go your ways as you see them set clear before you,' returned the
  Viscount; 'but as for me, all is confusion and I have begun to ponder many
  things.'</p>

  <p>'"A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways,"' said the Puritan
  firmly, 'and such can be of no use to us. Go serve the King and take ten
  thousand with you, and still we stand the stronger.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyde's personal dislike of the speaker, as well as his loyalty and
  conservative principles, spurred him into a hot answer.</p>

  <p>'Do you then admit you do not serve the King?' he asked. 'Are we to hear
  open rebellion?'</p>

  <p>'God knoweth what we shall hear and what we shall see,' said Mr. Cromwell
  grimly. 'There will be more wonders abroad than thy wits will be able to cope
  with, methinks, Mr. Hyde.'</p>

  <p>'My wits stand firm,' smiled that gentleman, 'and my faith is uncorrupt
  and my sword is practised.'</p>

  <p>'The sword!' repeated Oliver Cromwell, putting his hand slowly on the
  plain little weapon by his side. 'Speak not of the sword! Englishman have
  not, sir, come to that, and will not, unless they be forced.'</p>

  <p>'Yet,' said Lord Falkland quietly, 'do you not perceive that by your
  actions you provoke the possibilities of bloodshed? Already the Lords have
  fallen away from you&mdash;the King hath many friends even among the Commons,
  and they are not less resolute, less courageous, less convinced of the
  justice of their desires than you yourself&mdash;how then are these divided
  parties to be brought together unless a temperate action and a mild counsel
  be employed? The King hath held his hand&mdash;<i>sir, hold yours</i>.'</p>

  <p>With these words, which he uttered in a stately fashion and almost in the
  tone of a warning, the young lord, taking Mr. Hyde by the arm, was turning
  away, but Oliver Cromwell, with an earnest gesture, caught his hand.</p>

  <p>'Lucius Carey, stay thou with us,' he said.</p>

  <p>Lord Falkland let his slight hand remain in the Puritan's powerful grasp,
  and turned his serene, mournful eyes on to the older man's stern, eloquent
  face.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Cromwell,' he replied, 'believe me honest as yourself. You left
  plenty and comfort for this toilsome business of Parliament, and I also put
  some ease by that I might do a little service here. My cause is your cause,
  the cause of liberty. I despise the courtier and hate the tyrant, but I
  believe in the old creeds, too, Mr. Cromwell, and that the King is as like to
  save us as any other gentleman. Therefore, if henceforth you see little of
  me, believe that I obey my conscience as you do follow yours.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell released his hand and said no other word.</p>

  <p>'A good night,' smiled Lord Falkland, and raising his beaver, left
  Westminster Hall with Edward Hyde.</p>

  <p>Lord Essex came up to the window, and to him Oliver Cromwell turned
  sharply.</p>

  <p>'There go two who will join the King's party,' he said bluntly, pointing
  after the two Cavaliers.</p>

  <p>'They have long been of that mind,' replied Lord Essex dryly. 'Mr. Hyde
  goeth to seek advancement and my lord because he is tender towards the
  clergy.'</p>

  <p>'I would have kept my lord,' remarked Mr. Cromwell, with a touch of
  wistfulness in his tone. 'He is a goodly youth and a brave, and hath too fair
  a soul to join with idolators and Papists.'</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Lord Falkland, having parted from Mr. Hyde, was walking along
  the river-bank, where an uneven row of houses edged the gardens of
  Northumberland House, Whitehall, and the estates of the Buckingham
  family.</p>

  <p>The scene was thrice familiar to Lord Falkland, but his sensitive soul and
  quick eye were alive to every detail of the street, the people, and the
  river.</p>

  <p>He loved England, he loved London and the crooked river, built over with
  crooked houses, from which rose the churches with the Gothic towers or lead
  cupolas; but to-night this love made him feel melancholy. He had a
  premonition that terror and discord would descend on the beloved city, on the
  beloved land, and that he would be able to avail nothing against those
  relentless forces of which Mr. Cromwell was typical, and which seemed to be
  sweeping him on to tumult and strife.</p>

  <p>He had left all the delights of his wealthy retirement&mdash;his dear
  family, his dear friends, and his dear literature&mdash;that be might help
  his country in the pass to which she had come.</p>

  <p>And now he had himself arrived at a pass and must decide whether he would
  remain with the party by which he had so far stood, or remain loyal to the
  ancient Church and the ancient constitution which his fathers had served and
  defended.</p>

  <p>He paused in his walk when he reached Whitehall stairs, and turned to look
  at the splendid new palace as it rose above the gardens and the houses.</p>

  <p>Then he called a pair of oars and was rowed to Chelsea Reaches to gain the
  sweeter air of the country and to have leisure on the bosom of the river and
  under the flaming sky to deal with the perplexing thoughts that vexed his
  noble mind.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-08"
     id="ch1-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE NEWS FROM IRELAND</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Cromwell was in his chamber writing letters; it was a
  few weeks before the expected return of the King and the opening of
  Parliament, and the Member for Cambridge had come up to London early to
  confer with Mr. Pym and other leaders of the popular party on the so-called
  Remonstrance, otherwise the exposition of the case against Charles, and of
  the hopes and fears and perils of the Parliament, already divided within its
  own walls by the standing back or falling aside of men like Falkland and
  Hyde.</p>

  <p>It was a challenge to the King and to those who supported him, and if
  passed would prove a shrewder blow to royalty than even the death of
  Strafford.</p>

  <p>For the rest, events were, for such a time of unrest, going with
  surprising smoothness and quietness for the Parliament; it was now generally
  known that the King had failed in his endeavours to bring down a northern
  army to overawe Westminster, and though his plots, the intrigues of the Queen
  and her Romanist advisers were incessant and served to keep the Commons in a
  continual state of watchfulness and alarm, they had hitherto been fruitless,
  and Mr. Pym and Mr. Cromwell, though they might be accounted the strongest
  opponents of the King, yet now hoped to bring or force Charles to reason and
  put the kingdom in good order without recourse to more rioting or
  ferment.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell, thinking of these things with satisfaction, and having
  sealed his letter, rose to light the lamp, for the gloomy October day, foggy
  and brown at the brightest, was drawing to a close.</p>

  <p>When he had trimmed and lit the lamp, he heard a familiar footstep on the
  stairs, and, going swiftly to the door, opened it on John Pym.</p>

  <p>'I did not expect thee,' said Mr. Cromwell, smiling.</p>

  <p>His visitor passed him and, throwing himself into the great chair fitted
  with worn leather cushions near the yet unshuttered window, stared at his
  friend with such a visible disturbance in his usually composed and bold
  features that Mr. Cromwell was surprised into an exclamation&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What news is there?'</p>

  <p>A grim smile stirred John Pym's pale lips.</p>

  <p>'Where hast thou been all this day that thou hast not heard?'</p>

  <p>'Here, since midday, and never a breath of news could reach me if some
  friend did not bring it.'</p>

  <p>John Pym put his hand to his forehead; he looked old and ill and more
  utterly overmastered by emotion than his colleague had ever before seen
  him.</p>

  <p>'Evil news, Mr. Pym?' and the energetic Puritan's mind flew to that centre
  of mischief, the King and Queen in Scotland.</p>

  <p>'Evil news,' repeated the older man sombrely, 'news that hath set London
  in a frenzy. They are running mad in the streets now&mdash;news that will
  make some swift conclusion here inevitable.'</p>

  <p>A light that was perhaps as much of pleasurable anticipation and
  satisfaction as of regret or anger brightened Mr. Cromwell's eyes as he
  answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Tell me&mdash;as quick as may be&mdash;tell me this grievous thing.'</p>

  <p>'The full news has not come to hand yet&mdash;only a couple of desperate
  messengers and this afternoon three more expresses confirming it.'</p>

  <p>He paused, for his voice was fast breaking under the strain of what he had
  to utter.</p>

  <p>'The lamp is smoking,' he said, to steady himself.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell slowly turned down the wick, then Mr. Pym resumed in a
  controlled and normal voice.</p>

  <p>'There has been a most bloody rising in Ireland. The popish Irish have
  risen against the English in Ulster&mdash;one of them, O'Neil, hath declared
  he holdeth a commission from the King. Mr. Cromwell, the fearful stories are
  beyond belief&mdash;thousands have been massacred, and the whole Island is in
  a welter of barbarous confusion.'</p>

  <p>A groan of passionate horror and fury broke from Oliver Cromwell; all the
  hatred of the Englishman for the Irish, of the Puritan for the Papist, of the
  champion of freedom for the King and tyrant stirred in his heart.</p>

  <p>'This is the Queen's doing!' he exclaimed as half London had exclaimed in
  the same rage and anguish.</p>

  <p>'That is the popular cry,' said Mr. Pym; 'but we must be above the popular
  cries and reason out this thing ourselves. Maybe this Phelim O'Neil lieth,
  maybe the Queen hath no hand in this slaying of the Protestants.'</p>

  <p>'Canst thou deny,' cried Mr. Cromwell, 'that she and her priests of Baal
  have ever given pernicious advice to the King? Oh, wretched country that ever
  had this cursed Frenchwoman set over it!'</p>

  <p>'Let the Queen go,' said John Pym. 'We are not concerned with her, we
  cannot strike at her; our business is with the King. Compose thyself&mdash;I
  am come to confer with thee.'</p>

  <p>'I cannot so easily be calm,' answered Mr. Cromwell, 'when I consider how
  God's English have been treated&mdash;are, at this moment, being tormented
  and slain!'</p>

  <p>'This is the sowing,' returned Mr. Pym grimly. 'By and by will come the
  harvest.'</p>

  <p>'May I be there to help gather it!' cried the Member for Cambridge. 'May
  God preserve me to a little aid in avenging His people.'</p>

  <p>'The time will come,' said John Pym, '"for the eyes of the Lord are over
  the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the
  Lord is against them that do evil."'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell dropped his chin on his breast, as his fashion was when
  deeply moved; but John Pym raised his authoritative face and spoke again.</p>

  <p>'At this moment we must consider how this event is like to bear on the
  issues at Westminster. We must be ready. I do not dare to hold the King
  responsible for this most horrible work in Ireland, though I fear he will
  find it hard to clear his name before the popular eye; but this much is
  proven&mdash;he had a plot with the Irish gentry to gain Dublin for himself,
  and there to raise an army to send against us.'</p>

  <p>'Aye, the sword,' muttered Cromwell, 'the power of the sword!'</p>

  <p>'Even of that have I come to speak,' pursued John Pym. 'Thou, sagacious as
  thou art, canst see the next move the King will take when he returneth
  without the help he hoped for from Scotland?'</p>

  <p>The other lifted his fine head quickly.</p>

  <p>'He will demand an army for the reconquest of Ireland,' he said briefly.
  'And as I hope for mercy,' he added solemnly, 'he shall not have it!'</p>

  <p>'The only army the Parliament will raise will be one under its own control
  and officered by its own men,' replied John Pym; 'but the struggle will be
  sharp. We have now such men as Hyde and Falkland against us, and the King's
  Episcopalian party gathered strength in the House and in the country.'</p>

  <p>He was silent a while, then he gave a great sigh of mental distress and
  physical weariness.</p>

  <p>'Is it too late to hope for peace?' he murmured, as if speaking to
  himself. 'Is it too late?'</p>

  <p>'It is too late,' blazed out Cromwell, 'to trust the King. Too late,
  indeed! Unless we wish to wait another Saint Bartholomew&mdash;another
  Valtelline. It is not so long since this Queen's house had those damnable
  murders done on poor Protestants&mdash;she who designed that devilry was a
  Medici. Was not this woman's mother of that family? And was not the King's
  grandmother from that same idolatrous court, and was she not a wanton Papist?
  Trust none of them, Mr. Pym, nor Stewart, nor Bourbon, but listen to the
  Lord's bidding, even as He commandeth, and care nothing for any other.'</p>

  <p>'Thou didst not use to be so hot against the King,' said John Pym.</p>

  <p>'I did not know his subtle tricks, his shifts, his deceptions, his lies,
  his faithlessness, his great unreason. Hath he not given us his challenge?
  What did he not write this very month from Scotland? Mindst thou his words?
  "I am constant to the discipline and doctrine of the Church of England
  established by Queen Elizabeth and my father, and I resolve, by the Grace of
  God, to die in the maintenance of it." And then he proceedeth to fill up the
  vacant bishoprics, and with those very divines against whom we were bringing
  a charge of treason. Then what thou hast said, even this moment, of
  Ireland&mdash;tell me not that it was not his sceptre which was the staff
  that stirred up this flame! No more dealings with Charles, Mr. Pym; the time
  for that is past.'</p>

  <p>The extraordinary strength and grandeur that emanated from the speaker's
  personality, clothing it with that magnificence that is usually only bestowed
  by the knowledge of high power or a mighty station, was impressed on Mr. Pym
  as never, perhaps, before; and it flashed into the mind of the bold
  parliamentary leader that here might be indeed that champion of great
  fearlessness, indomitable purpose, spiritual enthusiasm, and broad views who
  would soon be necessary to second him and even to take his place, for he,
  John Pym, was not young, and was worn with years of infinite labour. Times,
  too, had immensely changed since first he had stepped forward to defend the
  English law and English liberties, and in the new, strange, perhaps terrific
  epoch coming it might well be that a man would be needed of qualities
  different from his own.</p>

  <p>Hitherto John Pym had not looked upon Oliver Cromwell as other than an
  able and enthusiastic lieutenant; he had ranked him below men of the
  intellectual calibre and the culture of Hampden and Falkland, and though he
  had never doubted his willingness in the cause of freedom, he had not given
  much thought to his capacity. But lately&mdash;when Cromwell had fired at the
  King's appointment of the obnoxious priests, when he had spoken by his side
  for the exclusion of the bishops from Parliament, when he had seconded the
  attack on the Prayer Book&mdash;Pym had noticed in him the gleam of rare and
  splendid qualities.</p>

  <p>And as he looked at him now, a man of homely simplicity in appearance, yet
  conveying, by some magic of the spirit, a splendour and a force such as is
  found once among tens of thousands, his heart leapt with a deep inward
  joy.</p>

  <p>'Thou art very fit to challenge the King,' he said quietly.</p>

  <p>The Calvinist was in no way moved by this.</p>

  <p>'I may be an instrument,' he said, 'but the way is confused and troubled;
  we draw near the whirlpool, and unless God make Himself manifest, how are we
  to avoid being sucked into destruction?'</p>

  <p>He began to pace the room with uneven and agitated steps.</p>

  <p>'I would not be the first to draw the sword!' he cried; 'but if the Lord
  make it law and putteth it into my hands, shall I not strike? Oh, Mr. Pym,
  war is an awful thought, and we hang on the edge of dreadful conclusions; but
  is this the moment to turn back or pause? "Teach me, O Lord, the way of Thy
  statute, and I will keep it to the end! Give me understanding and I will keep
  Thy law; yea, I will keep it with my whole heart!"'</p>

  <p>He paused by the farther wall, resting one hand against the wood
  panelling, and with the other wiping his brow and lips with a plain cambric
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>John Pym sat motionless in the great arm-chair, leaning forward a little
  and looking intently and with a kind of quiet eagerness at the younger
  man.</p>

  <p>'When I heard this afternoon of the confirmation of this dismal and
  lamentable news from Ireland, when I foresaw that the King had now an excuse
  to demand an army&mdash;then I too thought&mdash;God hath spoken, and it must
  be the sword.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell's whole stout frame trembled, as if responding to some
  intense and suppressed emotion.</p>

  <p>'England! England!' he muttered, are we come to have to heal thy hurts
  with the bloody steel and the devouring flame? I had hoped differently.'</p>

  <p>'If the King armeth so must we,' said John Pym. 'But there is yet some
  hope. Hyde and Falkland are now something in the councils of the King, and he
  may listen to them.'</p>

  <p>'My Lord Falkland will do a true man's uttermost,' replied Cromwell, with
  that sudden tenderness that was as natural to him as his sudden fierceness.
  'But will he avail? I have but a mean opinion of Mr. Hyde.'</p>

  <p>'Neither he nor my Lord Viscount have a grasp bold enough nor an outlook
  sure enough for these difficult times. But their advice will better that of
  the Queen and the priests, and in them resteth our last hopes of a peaceable
  settlement.'</p>

  <p>As Pym spoke he rose and, going over to Cromwell, grasped him by the
  shoulders and looked earnestly into his face. In age there was nearly twenty
  years difference between the two men, and the appearance of the lawyer who
  had led a studious life in cities was very different from that of the robust
  country gentleman; but their look of ardour, of resolution, of steadfastness
  was the same, and John Pym's face, marked with years and faded by ill-health,
  held the same brightness of a high purpose as the blunt, fresh features of
  the younger man, still in the height and prime of his vigorous strength.</p>

  <p>'Thou wilt be a man much needed in the times to come,' said Mr. Pym, 'for
  I think thou hast the gift of fortitude.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell did not answer; in his mind's eye he saw that misty day
  outside St. Ives, the black river, the black houses, the gnarled and bent
  willows, the church spire pointing to an obscure heaven, the flat bog leading
  to Erith's Bulwark, beyond&mdash;the rude paling&mdash;all the common details
  of that familiar scene where he had first entered into covenant with God.</p>

  <p>The glory of the vision had faded, and melancholies had taken the place of
  that unspeakable joy and wonder; but a faith that never weakened was always
  there and sometimes flashed up, as now, into a dazzling remembrance of that
  other November day and the promise of the Lord.</p>

  <p>'Englishmen such as thee are greatly wanted now,' added Mr. Pym after a
  little.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell suddenly flashed into a smile which had a certain steady
  happiness in it, as if he had gained contentment from his momentary
  absorption or reverie.</p>

  <p>'There are many better than I!' he answered. 'Poor reeds, Mr. Pym, but by
  binding us together thou mayst make a stout birch for thy purpose!'</p>

  <p>He turned and took his hat and mantle from a peg on the wall.</p>

  <p>'I will come out with thee,' he said, 'and see how things go in
  London.'</p>

  <p>As the two gentlemen went together down the narrow stairs, Pym, in a few
  words, gave his companion the outlines of the next momentous measure he
  intended to bring forward at this juncture, when the public frenzy at the
  Irish rebellion and the atrocious circumstances of it would be occupying
  Parliament as well as people.</p>

  <p>'I shall ask that military appointments may be under parliamentary
  control, Mr. Cromwell, and that His Majesty take only such advisers as the
  nation can approve; also that my Lord of Essex be given the command of the
  train bands&mdash;under the authority of Parliament, not the King.'</p>

  <p>'Well dost thou seize the moment!' returned the other, in a tone of
  admiration. 'Turning even these events of horror into profit for liberty,
  methinks thou hast the King so stript of all pretences that he will scarce be
  able to find any rag of Popery to cover his bareness.'</p>

  <p>Take care,' said John Pym, gently laying his hand on his friend's cuff,
  'that thou dost not underestimate those forces opposed to thee.'</p>

  <p>'And thou,' replied Cromwell, 'that thou dost not underestimate thine own
  strength and power.'</p>

  <p>They came out into the street, down which the sleet was sweeping in icy
  spears; the close, stale odours of the city encompassed them, and the bitter
  damp struck through their mantles and made their flesh shiver.</p>

  <p>'Methinks,' said Cromwell, 'this dark air is full of portents and heavy
  with forebodings. Thou knowest, Mr. Pym, that we stand in a little mean
  street, in the cold and darkness, in the midst of a distressed and oppressed
  city, yet I tell thee the Lord hath us by the hand and will lead us yet into
  the freedom and light of great spaces, there to work His will.'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-09"
     id="ch1-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. JOHN PYM AND THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">'This is Lord Falkland's advice,' said the Queen, 'and I do
  wonder you should so listen to one who was but lately in the forefront of
  your enemies and even now is close with them.'</p>

  <p>'It is the advice of the moderate men,' returned Charles, with a sneer on
  the adjective, 'and I must listen to them. Patience, my dear, my beloved. If
  I could win John Pym it were worth some sacrifice of pride.'</p>

  <p>'Things run more smoothly in your favour now,' retorted Henriette Marie,
  'and you have no need for these concessions. Was not our welcome to London
  fair enough? And do not your friends in the Lords grow daily?'</p>

  <p>'But the party of John Pym groweth daily also,' said the King grimly, 'and
  therefore have I sent for him.'</p>

  <p>'I do wonder,' cried his wife, 'that you should stoop to parley with one
  whom we both hold in hatred!'</p>

  <p>'Do not imagine,' replied Charles, with intense bitterness, 'that I shall
  ever forgive John Pym, whom I have long resolved to punish fittingly. But if
  I can make an instrument of him, for his own humiliation and my gain surely I
  will.'</p>

  <p>They were walking in the gardens of Whitehall. It was still winter, but of
  an extraordinary mildness; a pale and soft blue sky showed between the bare
  branches, and through the thick carpet of damp brown leaves the fresh little
  plants and weeds pushed up shoots of green.</p>

  <p>Charles and his wife walked slowly along the damp paths; she was wrapped
  carelessly in a black hood and cloak, and her face was disfigured by a look
  of annoyance, anxiety, and fatigue.</p>

  <p>Her beauty and sweetness seemed to have been lately burnt away by the
  angry pride and passions the recent troubles had roused in her; she was not
  one to retain either meekness or gaiety in adversity, and she fretted deeply
  under what she termed the King's inaction.</p>

  <p>Had she been in his place she would have put her fate to the test before
  now by some act of violence, and instead of making concession after
  concession, as Charles had done, she would have given the call to arms at the
  first refusal of the Parliament to do her will or at the first murmur they
  made against her fiat.</p>

  <p>And now, in her eyes, a humiliation deeper than any yet endured was to
  hand, in the shape of the King's proposed interview with John Pym&mdash;a
  proposal which, as she had guessed, came from Lord Falkland, who was
  beginning to attach himself to the Court, and who was, as always, working
  sincerely in the interests of concord, a peaceful settlement, and public
  security.</p>

  <p>As usual, perversity and impatience, frivolity and pride made it
  impossible for the Queen to grasp the difficulties of her husband's position
  and how those difficulties had been augmented by the hideous uprisings in
  Ireland, which continued with all the violence of furious passions loosened
  after long restraint.</p>

  <p>She said no more, however, for she was not the woman to waste words on a
  matter where she was not likely to prevail.</p>

  <p>The King too was silent; his feelings against John Pym were no less bitter
  than his Queen's hatred of that resolute commoner, and they were tinged with
  a dreadful shame and an awful remorse which she did not feel, for the thought
  of Pym brought with it the thought of Strafford.</p>

  <p>When they came to a little turn in one of the paths they beheld ahead of
  them a very pleasant vista of bare but fresh trees, flecked with sun and
  covered with splashes and tufts of moss, and on a bench beneath a slender
  beech a group of youths who were engaged in shooting arrows at a target.</p>

  <p>Three of the little company were at the first opening of manhood, two were
  children. All were unusual in their handsomeness and princely poise as in the
  richness of their appointments, and four of them were distinguished by a
  darkness of colouring and vividness of expression commonly associated with
  the French or Italian, and not likely to be the passport to popularity in
  England; the fifth and youngest was a beautiful, grave child of eight, or so,
  with bright complexion and golden auburn hair, who, leaning against the tree,
  handed to the others the arrows out of a quiver of gilded leather.</p>

  <p>His dress heightened his look of fairness, for it was light blue, and the
  sun fell full over him while the others were in shade and darkly though
  magnificently attired.</p>

  <p>The other child was a lad a year or two older, of no particular beauty,
  but of a nimble and sprightly appearance, whose irregular features were lit
  by a pair of very handsome, eloquent, black eyes; seated at the end of the
  bench, he was at the moment practising his skill at archery and was tugging
  at a great bow that was almost too stubborn for his strength.</p>

  <p>The three young men who were gathered round him, directing and
  instructing, were obviously brothers; all three of a splendid presence and
  all characterised by an air of recklessness, arrogance, and a certain rude
  pride, and one was a youth who would have been distinguished in any company
  for his extreme handsomeness and his animated, flamboyant personality.</p>

  <p>It was he who, with the quickness that accompanied all his motions, turned
  at the first footfall he heard and discerned the King. At the sight of His
  Majesty the sport ended, and the young men rose, laughing; but the fair
  child, with a certain prim absorption, busied himself in putting the arrows
  away, and never looked up from his task.</p>

  <p>'The bow is too strong for Charles,' said the handsome youth with a strong
  foreign accent.</p>

  <p>'Get thee a smaller one,' answered the King, smiling at his eldest son,
  who had cast the bow down with a good-natured grimace.</p>

  <p>'Nay, sire,' replied the Prince of Wales, 'it is a play that groweth
  old-fashioned. I will practise the sword.'</p>

  <p>At this the fair boy glanced up from the quiver he was filling.</p>

  <p>'If you will not learn,' he said, in a voice serious for his years, 'why
  waste this time in the essay?</p>

  <p>His brother burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>'To pass the hours, thou wise man!'</p>

  <p>'I love not to pass the time in fooling,' replied the little Duke of York
  crossly. 'If I had thought you would not learn, I would not have held the
  arrows for you.'</p>

  <p>The young man laughed again, and so did the Queen, but the King said
  quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'If James hath a mind to be serious&mdash;why, it is no ill thing; you, my
  nephews, might without harm be graver.'</p>

  <p>The three princes took this reproof in smiling silence; they made a
  charming picture in the winter sunlight, in their youth and gaiety and
  self-confidence and all the graceful airs of pride and rank which well became
  their thoughtless age and high position.</p>

  <p>Two of them, the Elector Palatine and Prince Maurice, moved on through the
  gardens with their two English cousins and the Queen, but Rupert, the
  handsome, impatient youth, remained where the King stood thoughtfully by the
  bench, beside the fallen bow and the quiver of arrows little James had flung
  down in disgust.</p>

  <p>'Will Your Majesty see this traitor Pym to-day?' asked Rupert eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Yes, here, and soon,' replied Charles.</p>

  <p>'He should be treading the scaffold planks, not the King's garden!' cried
  the Prince.</p>

  <p>Charles looked at his nephew with mingled affection and doubt. His own
  nature was so totally different from that of the headstrong, violent,
  reckless, and rudely arrogant Prince, that he could not altogether love and
  trust his nephew; at the same time the young man's eager loyalty, his warm if
  imprudent championship of the King's every action, could not but endear him
  to Charles, as did his history of misfortune and the fact that he was the son
  of the King's only sister, Elizabeth, who had met with troubles undeserved
  and bravely borne.</p>

  <p>He answered with the bitterness that often now flavoured his speech.</p>

  <p>'You will taste trouble in your time, Rupert, if you do not learn that
  such words must not be used of those who lead the people.'</p>

  <p>'I shall never be a king or a ruler,' answered Rupert, 'and so can keep a
  freer tongue. A third son hath no hopes, but few fears, so tantivy to these
  crop-eared churls, and may I one day have the hunting of them!'</p>

  <p>He cast up his beaver as he spoke and caught it again with a laugh of
  sheer light-heartedness.</p>

  <p>'A free lance at your service, sire,' he cried, and stooping near the root
  of the beech he pulled up a root of violet which bore several pale and small
  flowers of an exceeding sweetness of perfume.</p>

  <p>With quick brown fingers he fastened it into the button-hole of his dark
  scarlet doublet.</p>

  <p>'Here comes the bold rebel,' he said, his loud, deep voice but slightly
  lowered.</p>

  <p>Charles hastily turned his head.</p>

  <p>Lord Falkland and John Pym were approaching. The King seated himself and
  pulled his hat over his eyes as if to conceal the confusion in his
  countenance when he found himself face to face with the man whom he regarded
  as his minister's murderer, and Rupert, leaning against the tree, folded his
  arms on his broad chest in an attitude of contempt and defiance.</p>

  <p>The four men made a strange opposition when they came together; the
  refined sweetness and gentle bearing of the English noble contrasting with
  the coarse beauty and bold demeanour of the foreign prince, and the severe
  deportment and graceful figure of the King opposed to the bent form, simple
  attire, and quiet carriage of the parliamentary leader.</p>

  <p>Both men had approached this interview with reluctance and a sense of
  hopelessness; Pym, because he thought that it would be impossible to force
  the King to sincerity, and the King, because he thought it would be
  impossible to bend or break Pym.</p>

  <p>Charles gave no immediate answer to Lord Falkland's presentation, and made
  not the least effort to appear gracious. He and Pym were not strangers to
  each other; there had been a time, years ago, when it had seemed as if the
  famous lawyer might be one of those advising and guiding the King.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' said Charles at length, 'I know not why I have chosen to see you
  here, save that the day is fair and we can talk here under the sky as well as
  under a ceiling.'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied John Pym simply, 'I have been mewed up so much of late that
  I am very glad to be in a pleasant place of green.'</p>

  <p>'Give us leave, my lord,' said Charles, 'and you, Rupert, we have to
  confer with this our faithful subject.'</p>

  <p>The King's cold sarcasm was not lost on John Pym, whose lips curved into a
  faint quiet smile, nor on the two young men, one of whom heard with vexation,
  the other with considerable amusement.</p>

  <p>Rupert would, indeed, have liked to have stayed and helped bait and annoy
  a man whom he regarded as only fit for the branding, the mutilation, the
  pillory, and the fine which had been the fate of William Prynne a few years
  earlier, but he bowed to the King's decision and moved away with the
  Viscount.</p>

  <p>Charles looked after the two figures, alike in youth and comeliness,
  dissimilar in everything else, then turned his stern and weary eyes on John
  Pym, who stood with his plain hat in his hand, waiting for the King to
  speak.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Pym,' he said abruptly, there is much disaffection in the House.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sire.'</p>

  <p>'And parties are very sharply divided,' added Charles, alluding to the
  continued strength of his partisans in the Commons.</p>

  <p>John Pym understood him perfectly.</p>

  <p>'We have,' he answered, 'much to contend against, but God hath given us
  success.'</p>

  <p>The King's pale face assumed a look even more hard and bitter than before;
  he knew Pym referred to the passing of the Great Remonstrance which he had
  carried through the Commons by a narrow majority.</p>

  <p>'We?' he exclaimed. 'For whom do you speak when you say "we," Mr.
  Pym?'</p>

  <p>'For those whom Your Majesty wished to deal with when you sent for me,'
  answered the commoner calmly.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried the King sharply. 'You think you can boast to my face of your
  power in the Commons!'</p>

  <p>'I can boast to any man's face of the power of the English people,'
  replied Pym, 'and I believe it is that power that Your Majesty wisheth to
  reckon with.'</p>

  <p>Charles was silent, not being able to master his humiliation and pride
  sufficiently to speak.</p>

  <p>'It is that power Your Majesty <i>must</i> reckon with,' added John Pym,
  without bravado or insult, but with intense firmness.</p>

  <p>The blood stained the King's pallor as if it had been called there by a
  blow.</p>

  <p>'You have changed your language since last we spoke together, Mr. Pym!' he
  cried.</p>

  <p>'Much hath changed, sire. There is a broad river with many currents and
  many whirlpools flowing now through England, and it hath swept away many old
  landmarks. I do not mean discourtesy, but Your Majesty must have seen for
  yourself the swift changes of the times.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied the King. 'I have marked a crop of sedition such as few
  sovereigns have been called upon to cope with.'</p>

  <p>'And the advisers of Your Majesty have ordered and permitted an upset of
  the laws such as few peoples have had to endure, and as it is not in the
  temper of the English to bear.'</p>

  <p>A haughty and bitter reply was on Charles' lips, but he remembered that it
  was his object to in some way gain Pym and Pym's enormous influence, and he
  summoned his slender stock of tact and patience.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Pym,' he said, with dignity, 'we are not here to discuss old
  grievances, but rather to prepare balm for present sores and to consider how
  to avoid opening of future wounds.'</p>

  <p>John Pym smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>'It is all,' he said, 'in Your Majesty's hands.'</p>

  <p>'I think,' answered the King, that very little is left in my hands. 'Civil
  and religious authority is both assailed, and now you would arrest from me
  the power of the sword.'</p>

  <p>'The Parliament should have authority to choose Your Majesty's advisers
  and to control the army and the militia,' said Pym.</p>

  <p>'You try to force me into a corner,' replied Charles, in a still voice.
  'But you say it is in my hands,' he added, with an effort. 'Tell me if there
  is any means you&mdash;and I&mdash;may pursue together.'</p>

  <p>John Pym knew as clearly as if Charles had put it into words that he was
  appealing for his help; he stood silent, waiting for the King to further
  reveal himself.</p>

  <p>'You have had a long and laborious life, Mr. Pym,' continued Charles,
  fingering the deep lace on his cuffs. 'I could give you that ease and honour
  that brings repose.'</p>

  <p>'I am sorry Your Majesty said that,' returned the commoner. 'You must know
  that I am not a second Strafford to leave my party for royal bribes.'</p>

  <p>'You dare use that name to me!' blazed Charles, all his wrath and hatred,
  shame and pain, suddenly laid bare.</p>

  <p>'Why not?' returned Pym steadily. 'The death of Thomas Wentworth lieth not
  at my door. I opposed his impeachment. I wished his punishment, not his
  blood.'</p>

  <p>'Thou and thou only brought him to the block!' cried Charles.</p>

  <p>'Nor I, nor any could have done it if his master had chosen to save him,'
  said John Pym.</p>

  <p>'This is too much!' cried Charles, his lips quivering, his eyes reddened
  and flashing. 'By my soul, it is too much! Against my will was this
  meeting!'</p>

  <p>'I also thought it was too late,' replied Pym; 'but I stand here, ready to
  serve Your Majesty if Your Majesty will deal sincerely with your people.'</p>

  <p>Charles' natural duplicity came to his aid and supplied the place of
  patience; he mastered the wrath and horror caused in him ever by the mention
  of Strafford, and answered with sudden and unnatural quietness&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Mr. Pym,' he said, looking not at him but at his own square-toed shoes
  and white silk roses on them, 'I do desire concord and plain dealing, nor do
  I wish to provoke further strife.'</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty,' replied Pym, 'then, should stop this great gathering of
  ruffling Cavaliers who rally to the palace, and this armed guard who insult
  the passing crowd.'</p>

  <p>'What of the Roundhead rabble?' said Charles fiercely, 'who tear my
  bishops' robes from their backs when they endeavour to make their way across
  Palace Yard&mdash;who insult my Queen because she is Romanist?</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty provoked it,' answered Pym calmly. 'And had the bishops
  shown more of the meekness proper to their calling they would not now be in
  the Tower for their foolish proclamation.'</p>

  <p>He still held himself erect, though he was in feeble health and weary from
  standing. The King marked his fatigue, natural in one of his age, but his
  innate courtesy was stifled by his hatred of this man, and neither policy nor
  kindness moved him to bid John Pym be seated.</p>

  <p>'We must discuss these things,' he said. 'I am willing to be reasonable,
  and you have the reputation of a moderate. But you have some fanatic fellows
  of your party, Mr. Pym&mdash;Holles, Haselrig, Hampden, and a certain Oliver
  Cromwell.'</p>

  <p>'These gentlemen you name,' replied John Pym, 'are no more nor less
  fanatic than a hundred others, sire.'</p>

  <p>'They have stood forth of late as notable in voicing certain daring
  opinions,' said the King, who, though he had himself carefully in hand, was
  not able to be more than barely civil. 'You must not think, Mr. Pym, that I
  have overlooked them.'</p>

  <p>'What is the meaning of Your Majesty's reference to these gentlemen?'</p>

  <p>'Only this,' replied Charles steadily, 'that you and I could work together
  only if you refused your company and counsels to these I have
  mentioned&mdash;and some others, as my Lord Kimbolton, Mr. Strode, and the
  Earl of Essex.'</p>

  <p>'They are all,' said Mr. Pym, 'as well able to advise Your Majesty as
  myself. And, sire, if you sincerely wish to please your people, you will
  entertain no prejudice against these men, for they are highly esteemed and
  trusted by all.'</p>

  <p>'Enough, enough!' cried the King, in great agitation, hastily rising. 'I
  might consider terms with you, Mr. Pym, but not with every heretic whose
  voice is loud enough to catch the ear of the vulgar&mdash;but do not
  misunderstand me&mdash;you will hear from me again. To-day&mdash;to-day the
  sun sets and it groweth chilly.' He looked round the garden, now filled with
  sunset light, with an abstracted air. Think of me kindly, Mr. Pym, and tell
  the Commons their honour and safety is my chiefest care&mdash;as I hope
  theirs will be the welfare of the nation.'</p>

  <p>'Our talk, then, hath no conclusion?' asked Mr. Pym, who augured little
  good from this abrupt dismissal.</p>

  <p>'Not here,' said the King with a smile; 'at some further time, sir, you
  shall know the impression your speech to-day hath made on me. Now I must
  think a little on what you have said. A good night, Mr. Pym.'</p>

  <p>The commoner bowed, and the King, blowing a little silver whistle which he
  carried, brought up an attendant whom he told to conduct Mr. Pym to the gates
  of the palace.</p>

  <p>And so the interview, from which Lord Falkland and the moderate royalists
  had hoped so much, ended.</p>

  <p>Charles, trembling with emotion, spurned with the light cane he carried
  the spot of earth on which John Pym had stood.</p>

  <p>'Thou damnable Puritan!' he muttered, 'must I not only swallow thee but
  all thy brood of heretics! Too much, by Christ, too much!'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-10"
     id="ch1-10"></a>CHAPTER X. LORD FALKLAND'S ADVICE</h2>

  <p class="first">Half an hour later the Queen and Rupert found the King
  standing by the sundial; the sun had faded from the heavens, leaving them
  faintly purple, the trees were intertwining shapes, grey avenues of darkness,
  the scent of the violets by the dial was rich and strong, the air blew
  chilly, and in the palace windows the yellow lights were springing up, one by
  one.</p>

  <p>The Queen in her dark careless garments and Rupert in his brilliant
  bravery alike gloomed up out of the twilight as indistinct shapes.</p>

  <p>The King peered at them a little before he knew them.</p>

  <p>'John Pym and I will never speak together more,' he said abruptly and in a
  hoarse tone. 'When I returned to London it was not with the purpose of
  winning these men but of punishing them, and to that purpose I adhere.'</p>

  <p>'Lord Falkland,' answered Rupert, 'said Your Majesty had promised him to
  take no violent measures, and to consult him and your new advisers in all
  your actions.'</p>

  <p>'Of late I have had to make many promises that are impossible for me to
  keep,' returned Charles gloomily. 'If men press on a king they must expect he
  will use all weapons against them. I shall act without my Lord Falkland's
  advice. How can he,' added the King with a grand air, 'or any man, know what
  I feel towards these men who threaten my sacred crown and God His Holy
  Church? Who imprison my bishops and take from me&mdash;my friends?' His voice
  broke into sadness. 'Truly, as I stood by this dial, I thought it was like an
  emblem of my life, all the sunny hours numbered and the finger now moving
  into darkness.'</p>

  <p>'But to-morrow will see the sun again,' cried Rupert, 'and so Your
  Majesty, coming from an eclipse, shall behold a brighter day.'</p>

  <p>'Alas,' answered Charles, 'the moon is misty and clouds and rain threaten
  for to-morrow. But though I am encompassed with many dangers I will not
  hesitate to bring these traitors to judgment.'</p>

  <p>'This is what I from the first advised,' said the Queen. 'When we came
  from Scotland, and the people were shouting and the city feasting
  us&mdash;then was the moment to strike.'</p>

  <p>'It is not too late,' replied Charles.</p>

  <p>'Take care it be not,' urged Henriette Marie. 'Last autumn half a day's
  delay ruined my Lord Strafford, so quick was this accursed Pym.'</p>

  <p>'He shall be avenged,' cried the King in great agitation. 'This time I
  will strike first&mdash;keep it from my council. The King acts for the King,
  now. Come in, my dear love, our short winter day is over&mdash;I feel it
  cold.'</p>

  <p>'A keen wind blows up the river,' said the Queen, with a little shudder.
  'I saw the gulls to-day at Whitehall; that means a stormy winter.'</p>

  <p>'But so far it hath been sweet as spring,' said Rupert, 'and there are so
  many flowerets out, that you might think it Eastertide.'</p>

  <p>They returned to the palace, and the King had sent for Lord Falkland and
  was proceeding to his cabinet, when he was met by Lord Winchester, one of the
  most influential and ardent of his courtiers, a magnificent and wealthy
  Cavalier, a Romanist, and one greatly beloved by King and Queen.</p>

  <p>'Sire,' said this gentleman in a low, hurried voice. 'I have just come
  from Westminster where there are some most horrid rumours abroad. I must
  acquaint you with&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Charles looked at him in a startled and bewildered fashion.</p>

  <p>'More ill news?' he murmured.</p>

  <p>'Nay,' said the Marquess, 'it is but one of many rumours such as now for
  ever beat the air&mdash;but I have sounded several on the likely truth of
  this report, and do believe it to be more than an idle alarm.'</p>

  <p>The King took his friend's arm and drew him into his cabinet where the
  wax-lights had already been lit and the fire sparkled between the gleaming
  brass andirons.'</p>

  <p>'Dear lord, be concise and brief,' he said affectionately.</p>

  <p>'I have summoned Lord Falkland, and he,' added Charles with his usual
  imprudence, 'is not in my confidence. I have taken him because I must. Now,
  thy news.'</p>

  <p>The Marquess, who was as magnificent in appearance as he was in
  temperament, being in all things the great noble, the patron of the arts, the
  refined proud gentleman, the type of all that Charles most admired, began to
  pace the room as if in some perturbation of mind.</p>

  <p>'I do not know bow to frame the thing in words,' he began; ''tis about
  John Pym.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, John Pym!' exclaimed Charles. He went to the fire and broke one of
  the flaming logs with the toe of his boot.</p>

  <p>'It is soberly said and credibly received,' continued the Marquess, 'that
  this knavish fellow who hath such a marvellous hold on the minds of his party
  is preparing an impeachment of&mdash;'</p>

  <p>My lord paused, and the King turned sharply from the fire.</p>

  <p>'What friend of mine doth he strike at now?' he asked, in a tone of bitter
  anger and shame.</p>

  <p>'It is said&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Thyself?'</p>

  <p>'Nay, sire&mdash;should I for that have troubled you? It is said he
  meditates impeaching Her Most Sacred Majesty.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, just God!' cried Charles, 'shall I endure this another hour, another
  minute?' He struck his breast with his open hand, and the rush of blood to
  his face showed even through the glow of the fire. 'Am I the King and cannot
  I protect my wife?'</p>

  <p>'Among Pym's party the thing is denied,' said the Marquess, with an
  instinctive desire to be fair even to people so hateful to him as were the
  Puritans, 'but remembering how suddenly he struck before, and seeing how
  persistent the rumour was and how many held it credible, I thought it well to
  bring it before Your Majesty&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It needed but that!' exclaimed the King. 'Yet it needed not a further
  outrage. I had already decided on my course.'</p>

  <p>He crossed suddenly to the Marquess and grasped him by the embroidered
  sleeves.</p>

  <p>'Ever since Strafford died,' he said, struggling with violent emotion, 'I
  have vowed in my heart, by my crown and before God, that Pym and the
  Parliament should pay! And they shall&mdash;to the last drop of blood in
  their bodies! Let no one ask me for mercy for John Pym, for I would sooner
  lose my all than lose my vengeance on these rebellious heretics!'</p>

  <p>'It were better to strike at once,' replied the Marquess, who well knew
  the King's habit of hesitation, and whose sympathies were with the more
  reckless counsels of the Queen. 'Nor wait until they have gathered strength
  and courage, or till fear giveth them daring. For I believe they have their
  suspicions that Your Majesty meaneth to punish them.'</p>

  <p>'My lord,' replied Charles, 'you speak with wisdom. You shall not have
  long to wait. Let me but beguile my Lord Falkland, who is for a compromise
  with these fellows.'</p>

  <p>He returned to the fireplace and stood there, shivering, and warming his
  hands, though not that he was cold; his features had a red, swollen look as
  if he had lately wept, and his eyes were heavy-lidded and bloodshot.</p>

  <p>'My lord,' he said, 'come to me when Lord Falkland hath gone, and I shall
  have my project ready.'</p>

  <p>Before the Marquess could answer, the King's page ushered in Lord
  Falkland.</p>

  <p>The King stood silent, biting his forefinger as the young noble saluted
  him.</p>

  <p>Not without misgiving did Lord Falkland see the Marquess in this closeness
  with the King. He knew him to be a man of honour and loyalty, but he knew him
  also to be one of those whose perverse and reckless advice the King most
  leant on&mdash;advice fatal to the peace of the kingdom, my lord thought,
  despairing of bringing Charles into an alliance with the Puritans when the
  great Romanist noble thus held his ear. The Marquess on his side regarded
  Lord Falkland as little better than a mild fanatic, and in his heart likened
  him, half bitterly, half humorously, to one who, at a bear baiting, should
  strive to separate the furious animals by Christian reasoning when the
  stoutest stick made would be scarce sufficient.</p>

  <p>So to the Marquess, who, though no statesman and no idealist, yet was
  shrewd enough in a worldly way, did Lord Falkland's attempt to make peace
  among the factions appear.</p>

  <p>He took a half-laughing leave of the Viscount, and, kissing the King's
  hand, retired.</p>

  <p>Charles picked up a small black leather portfolio from his bureau and
  began turning over the sketches it contained; they were Italian drawings
  recently brought by the Earl of Arundel from Rome, and the King glanced at
  them with real pleasure and relief. They were to his distracted mind what
  wine and gaiety would be to other men.</p>

  <p>Lucius Carey, my Lord Falkland, with a look of anxiety on his beautiful
  face, waited for him to speak.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Pym,' said Charles at length, gazing at a little drawing in bistre of
  a rocky landscape with trees, 'did make some discourse with me on the
  government of England.'</p>

  <p>'Was his speech such as to please Your Majesty?' asked the Viscount
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Please me?' repeated the King, keeping his voice steady, but the paper in
  his hand fluttering from the nervous shaking of his wrist. 'He wished to
  discuss matters with me as if we were two stewards set over an
  estate&mdash;not as if we were King and subject. Yet I do not doubt that he
  is a man of influence and one full of expedients and devices.'</p>

  <p>'He is honest,' said my lord, 'and of great power, and it is most
  necessary that Your Majesty should consider him and his party.'</p>

  <p>'Have I not,' asked the King with subdued violence, 'considered them?'</p>

  <p>He put the drawing back in the portfolio and turned his sad, angry gaze on
  Lord Falkland.</p>

  <p>'It is most necessary,' returned the Viscount, 'that Your Majesty should
  put aside all prejudice, and entertain the advices of these men with
  sincerity and openness. It is said at Westminster&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yea, it is said at Westminster!' interrupted Charles, thinking of what
  the Marquess of Winchester had told him. 'What is not said at
  Westminster?'</p>

  <p>Lord Falkland was entirely ignorant of what the King referred to, and knew
  nothing of the designs imputed to Mr. Pym.</p>

  <p>'I referred to those floating whispers and alarming rumours which declare
  Your Majesty intendeth, and hath intended, ever since your coming from
  Scotland, some sudden and violent measures against the popular leaders.'</p>

  <p>The King turned to his portfolio again and drew out a delicate pencil
  sketch of the Madonna and Child; the few strokes of lead glowed with all the
  sweetness and grace of the Umbrian School.</p>

  <p>'There is a lovely Raffaello, my lord,' he said. 'Who would not rather
  spend his time with these than with dusty politics?'</p>

  <p>'A King hath no choice, sire,' answered the Viscount, who had himself left
  a wealthy cultured retirement at the call of patriotism.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Charles, 'there are many matters in which I have no choice. As
  to these reports you have heard, did I not lately promise the Commons that
  their safety was as much my care as that of my own children? And have I not
  promised you, my lord, and my other counsellors, to take no step without your
  advice? What more can you ask of your King?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing more,' replied Lord Falkland. 'If Your Majesty remain of that
  mind I believe there will be but little difficulty to bring all things to a
  happy conclusion. Only I know that there are certain rash perverse courtiers
  who would tempt Your Majesty to step outside the law.'</p>

  <p>'You have caught a republican tone from this Puritan party,' said Charles
  haughtily. 'How shall I keep within the law who am alone the law?'</p>

  <p>Lord Falkland reddened at the rebuke, but answered the King manfully and
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>'Sire, if I am not honest with you, I lack in loyalty. The constitution of
  England is a mighty thing, and even the King must respect it&mdash;even as
  you have promised. And if you go against it, and against the party and
  principles of Mr. Pym, there will be great store of unhappiness ahead of us
  all.'</p>

  <p>Charles closed the portfolio and flung it down.</p>

  <p>'I will do all things in reason,' he said, facing the Viscount, 'but I
  stand as fast by my faith as they by their heresies. I will not forsake the
  Church of England.'</p>

  <p>Lord Falkland was silent.</p>

  <p>'And they ask for the militia,' added Charles. 'They desire that the army
  for Ireland be in their hands, officered by their creatures.'</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty,' suggested Falkland, 'might allow them the militia for a
  time.'</p>

  <p>'No, by Christ!' cried Charles, not for an hour! You ask what was never
  asked of King before. Neither Church nor sword will I surrender.'</p>

  <p>'Then the conference of Your Majesty with Mr. Pym hath been unavailing?'
  asked my lord mournfully.</p>

  <p>'I do not say so much,' replied Charles. 'I have said I will not be
  unreasonable, nor regardless in any way of the good of the people. I will see
  Mr. Pym again.'</p>

  <p>'Forgive me, sire,' said the Viscount, 'but a temperate carriage is
  advisable now in all things, to keep our friends, to gain others, and to
  render impossible the horrid chance of bloodshed.'</p>

  <p>The King's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>'They would fight, would they?' he answered. 'Well, so would I&mdash;I am
  not fearful of that, I should know how to meet rebellion.'</p>

  <p>'Rebellion?' repeated Lord Falkland. 'I do not dare to use or think that
  word!'</p>

  <p>'There are some who do,' said Charles dryly, 'but with God's grace we will
  avoid that danger. Are you satisfied, my lord?'</p>

  <p>The Viscount bowed.</p>

  <p>'I have Your Majesty's word for those measures we believe most necessary
  now. I am content to leave the rest in the hands of Your Majesty.'</p>

  <p>In his heart, the Viscount, who had met much disillusion and
  disappointment since he had joined the Court party, was far from satisfied.
  He found the King, as ever, vague, shifting, and reserved, and he was bound
  to conclude that the interview with John Pym had proved absolutely fruitless.
  Yet he drew some comfort from the fact that Charles had promised to commit no
  violence on any of the Members of the Commons nor to take any steps without
  the advice of his new counsellors&mdash;those moderate, loyal men of whom
  Falkland and Hyde were the chief, and whose mild and patriotic measures were
  entirely devoted to the task of making a settlement in the kingdom and
  mediating between Charles and the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Charles seemed to notice the shade of sadness, perhaps of mistrust, on my
  lord's fair face, and he touched him lightly and kindly on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Believe I shall act as becometh a King,' he said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Lord Falkland kissed his sovereign's hand and withdrew, reassuring himself
  as best he might, and comforting himself with those fair visions of truth and
  concord that never failed to fill his idealistic mind.</p>

  <p>Charles returned to the portfolio and continued to handle the drawings
  with a loving, delicate touch, and to gaze at them with the sensitive eyes of
  appreciation and knowledge.</p>

  <p>He was so employed when my Lord Winchester returned. When the splendid
  Marquess entered, he put the sketches by.</p>

  <p>'There is little satisfaction to be had from my Lord Falkland,' he
  remarked. 'He is little better than an ambassador of the Puritans.'</p>

  <p>'What will Your Majesty do?' asked the Marquess eagerly.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow,' replied Charles, 'there will be a few of these enemies of
  mine lodged in the Tower. To-morrow I impeach Pym and four of his creatures
  of high treason, at the Bar of the House of Lords.'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-11"
     id="ch1-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. THE FIVE MEMBERS</h2>

  <p class="first">The commotion at Westminster was intense; never, even at the
  arrest of Sir John Eliot or at the impeachment of the Earl of Strafford, or
  at the passing of the Great Remonstrance, had excitement run so high.</p>

  <p>For the King, without acquainting his new advisers, in direct violation of
  his recent promises, to the astonishment and dismay of his friends, the rage
  and horror of his enemies, had made a move which put his legal position in
  the wrong and showed at once and for ever that alliance between him and the
  popular party was impossible. He had sent the Attorney-General to the Bar of
  the House of Lords to impeach Lord Kimbolton and five members of the Lower
  Chamber&mdash;Pym, Strode, Halles, Haselrig, and Hampden.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards a guard was sent from Whitehall to arrest the five
  members. The Commons refused to deliver them, and sent a message to the King
  to say that the gentlemen charged were ready to answer any legal accusation,
  They also ordered the arrest of the officers who had been sent to search the
  rooms of the five members and seize and seal up their papers.</p>

  <p>This was the answer of the House to the challenge cast down by the King,
  and all England thrilled to it; all England waited too, in a kind of
  passionate suspense, the answer that would come from Whitehall. Was the King,
  who had so suddenly declared himself an enemy of the nation, baffled, checked
  or only further enraged? What would he do next?</p>

  <p>Few slept that night of the 3rd of January; and from thousands of Puritan
  households prayers and lamentations ascended.</p>

  <p>It was now clear that not by gentle means could the people of England hope
  to regain their cherished liberty, and that neither consideration nor fair
  dealing was to be hoped from a King who had so contemptuously disregarded
  faith and the law.</p>

  <p>Falkland, Culpeper, Hyde, and their following were utterly confounded and
  dismayed, ashamed and humiliated, but in the stern hearts of Pym, Hampden,
  Holles, Haselrig, Strode, and Cromwell was a certain exultation.</p>

  <p>Their enemy (for so by now these men had come to regard the King) had put
  himself in the wrong, and alienated that vast mass of the nation which in all
  great crises long remains neutral, and which had, hitherto, declared for
  neither King nor Parliament.</p>

  <p>But the recent action of the King, after his open promise before
  Parliament, caused the least reflective and humble of men to entertain a
  jealousy of their liberties, and a strong murmur of indignation arose over
  the whole country, which was a good help and encouragement to these men at
  Westminster.</p>

  <p>Added to this satisfaction, the popular leaders, who had already dared so
  much and ventured so far, felt a deep, if stern, gratification, which was
  not, perhaps, shared by their followers, that affairs were coming at length
  to a conclusion. Charles had now raised the issue, and it was their task to
  answer his challenge as decisively as he had given it. Three at least of the
  Commoners&mdash;Pym, Hampden, and Cromwell&mdash;did not shrink from the
  immense responsibilities which this involved on them, nor from the high
  stakes on which they had to play.</p>

  <p>Pym and Hampden already stood as near to death as had Pym the year before,
  when Strafford had come glooming to Westminster to impeach him, for there
  could be little doubt of the King's intention to appease that proud blood of
  his forsaken minister by the blood of those who had sent him to his
  death.</p>

  <p>Cromwell, one of a younger generation and of no such importance in the
  eyes of either King, his own party, or the nation, ran no such risk as his
  leaders and incurred no such responsibility. He was, however, their able and
  indefatigable lieutenant, and Pym at least thought highly of him as a driving
  force of courage and fortitude, enthusiasm and resolution.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 4th of January, the House met in an incredible state
  of tension and excitement, but during the morning hours nothing untoward
  occurred, and the Commons adjourned at midday without there having been any
  sign or message from Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell returned to the House early, as did most, and when Mr. Pym
  was in his place the benches were again crowded. Denzil Holles, Strode,
  Hampden, and Haselrig were near the entrance, talking earnestly with Lord
  Kimbolton, the Member of the House of Lords who had been impeached with
  them.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell looked at them with some admiration and even envy; they had a
  splendid chance to exercise all those qualities which he felt strongly
  burning in himself.</p>

  <p>He rose up and made his way to Mr. Pym, who was sitting silent, and looked
  ill and fatigued. But his calm, resolute expression, the light of energy,
  command, and courage in his glance showed him to be, as always, the intrepid,
  prompt leader of men&mdash;the leader of wit and resource and vigour.</p>

  <p>'Any news yet to hand?' asked Mr. Cromwell eagerly. 'You have gathered
  nothing either in the lobbies or the streets?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Pym smiled.</p>

  <p>'What is to be gathered but wild, bottomless rumours such as are to be
  looked for in these divided times? I have some of our own people posted near
  Whitehall that we may know as soon as possible the action of His
  Majesty.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe,' said Mr. Cromwell, 'he will do no more, finding his threats have
  failed.'</p>

  <p>'You do not know the King as well as I,' returned John Pym. 'He is the
  very haughtiest and most revengeful of men, and is not like to suffer in
  silence such an affront (for so he will call it) as hath been put on
  him.'</p>

  <p>'What, then, will he do?' asked the Member for Cambridge. 'What can he
  do?'</p>

  <p>'I have tried for many years,' replied John Pym, 'to work with His Majesty
  to form a ministry of loyal men proven by the Parliament&mdash;but it could
  never be, as you know&mdash;and all my dealings with the King, down to this
  last interview when I saw him face to face, have taught me his variableness,
  his unstability, his pride, and his insincerity. Therefore I cannot judge nor
  guess what he will do.'</p>

  <p>The four members talking at the entrance had now returned to their places,
  and Oliver Cromwell hastened to meet his friend, Lord Kimbolton, who was
  about to leave for the Upper House. The Member for Cambridge accompanied him
  into the antechamber, and while they were there, talking on the one absorbing
  topic of the moment, a fellow with his face pinched by the wind and a little
  breathless, came up asking for Mr. Pym, and showing his credentials, was
  admitted into the Chamber.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cromwell, taking a hasty leave of Lord Kimbolton, hurried back to his
  place in the House.</p>

  <p>He found the Members already in a state of deep emotion and excitement,
  for the most momentous of news was flashing from mouth to mouth.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pym's messenger had brought word that the King himself, accompanied by
  some hundreds of armed men, was riding down to Westminster. There was no time
  to lose; the royal party had been issuing from Whitehall gates when the man
  had seen them, and, though some little delay might be caused by the dense
  crowd thronging the street, it could not be long.</p>

  <p>Deep cries of 'The city! safety in the city! To the river!' echoed through
  Westminster Hall, and the five members were pushed from their places by
  friendly hands and hurried from the Hall to the lobbies, from the lobbies to
  the Thames, and there into the first boat available with directions to hasten
  to the sanctuary of the city.</p>

  <p>The thing was done with desperate swiftness, but if it had lacked this
  haste it would have been too late, for the House was scarcely returned to
  wonted order when the King with his cavalcade of ruffling Cavaliers arrived
  at Westminster.</p>

  <p>A deep hush fell on the Chamber, as if every man held his breath. Mr.
  Cromwell leant forward in his seat, every line in his powerful face tense,
  like a great mastiff on the watch, entirely absorbed by the movements of his
  foe.</p>

  <p>The King's men now filled Westminster Hall, and on the threshold of the
  inviolable Chamber itself the King appeared.</p>

  <p>When he first saw these rows of hostile faces, darkened, silent
  countenances of men who had defied him and whom he hated and scorned, he
  paused for a moment full in the doorway and calmly and deliberately gazed
  round him.</p>

  <p>There was something awful in the moment; the two opponents, King and
  Parliament, so suddenly and violently brought together, seemed like actors
  pausing before they enter on a tragedy.</p>

  <p>The King, in rose-coloured cloth and a crimson cloak, great boots with
  gilt spurs, his hat in his left hand, and his right pressed to his heart, the
  bleak light of the wintry day falling over his fair head and melancholy face,
  looked a frail figure to be opposed to these gathered ranks of gentlemen who
  had the whole strength and feelings of a great nation behind them, while he
  was only armed with the intangible weapons of traditional authority and such
  virtue as he might find in the royal blood of his unfortunate race.</p>

  <p>Beside him was his nephew, the young Elector Palatine, whose dark, haughty
  features expressed mingled curiosity and doubt. He had known exile and
  wandering, misfortunes and defeat, and it might be that he thought his uncle
  was daring those disasters which had broken his father's heart. His own
  presence there was an additional outrage on the Commons, but neither he nor
  Charles thought of this, so completely had they in common the family
  recklessness.</p>

  <p>The two Princes, Charles slightly before his nephew, advanced down the
  floor of the House. Mr. Cromwell, turning in his seat, watched him; there was
  a deep silence.</p>

  <p>The King mounted the step of the chair and faced the Speaker; his voice,
  very pleasant and slow as always, rose clearly through the crowded, still
  Chamber.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he said, 'we demand certain of your Members&mdash;Mr. Pym, Mr.
  Strode, Mr. Haselrig, Mr. John Hampden, and Mr. Denzel Holles.'</p>

  <p>There was a second's pause, then the King added in a voice slightly varied
  and strained with anger&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Where are these men?'</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty,' replied the Speaker, 'I have neither ears nor eyes in this
  place save as the House may be pleased to direct.'</p>

  <p>A low, deep murmur followed these words, and the blood ran up from the
  King's fair beard to his fair curls, and remained there, a fixed red in his
  haughty face.</p>

  <p>'It is no matter,' he replied, 'I think my eyes are as good as
  another's.'</p>

  <p>He turned and glanced round the House and scrutinized the packed benches
  in which were those five notable empty places; through the open doors his own
  followers peered in with a show of pike and pistol. Oliver Cromwell looked at
  them and smiled. When the King's swift glance for one instant rested on him,
  that grim smile was still on his lips; he turned and looked down full into
  the flushed face of the King.</p>

  <p>Charles smiled also with a bitterness beyond words.</p>

  <p>'I perceive that my birds are flown,' he said; 'but I shall take my own
  course to find them.'</p>

  <p>The Speaker neither moved nor spoke; a few deep cries of 'Privilege!' rose
  from the benches, and the King seemed to suddenly lose that proud composure
  he had hitherto maintained. His painful colour deepened and his countenance
  was confused and troubled, as if he realized how many and powerful his
  enemies were and how completely he was now encompassed by them.</p>

  <p>'Hold us excused that we thus disturb you,' he stammered, and he took his
  hand from his heart, where he had hitherto kept it, and caught his nephew by
  the arm as if to assure himself of the presence of one friend in the midst of
  this hostile assembly.</p>

  <p>'God save you, sire!' muttered the Elector Palatine. 'Do not give these
  rogues the power of disconcerting you.' Charles replied something that was
  lost in the ever deepening and growing murmur from the benches, and, turning
  on his heel, passed with his usual dignity of carriage through the ranks of
  the angry and triumphant Commons, and joined his own followers in the
  lobby.</p>

  <p>As the rose-coloured habit flashed out of sight, a great murmur arose, and
  the Members turned passionately one to the other. There was neither noise nor
  disorder; they were the very flower of English gentlemen, nearly all of
  famous names and ancient lineage, and they had not acted lightly nor for a
  trivial cause, but with full gravity and weight and for the sake of civic
  liberty.</p>

  <p>'His Majesty,' said Mr. Cromwell to his neighbour, 'is as great a
  blunderer as any I have ever seen.'</p>

  <p>Further down the benches a member remarked&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The die is cast. Now there is no turning back.'</p>

  <p>The next day the Parliament moved into the city for safety, and there went
  into committee on the state of affairs in the kingdom. Mr. Cromwell moved the
  consideration of means to put the kingdom in a state of armed defence.</p>

  <p>The King left Whitehall and sent his Queen from Dover to gain help from
  France, and to pledge the Crown jewels in Holland.</p>

  <p>So was the die cast indeed, as all men began to see as the stormy spring
  merged into the stormy summer.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-12"
     id="ch1-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. NOTTINGHAM</h2>

  <p class="first">'This is a day that will be remembered in the history of
  these times,' said the lady at the window.</p>

  <p>Her brother made no answer, but continued to lace up his long riding
  gloves.</p>

  <p>They were in an upper chamber of a house of the better sort in the town of
  Nottingham; the dark panelled walls, the dark floor and ceiling, the heavy
  furniture, with the fringes to the chairs and the worked covers to the table,
  showed vividly to the least detail in the strong afternoon rays of the August
  sun, which was, however, now and then obscured by heavy clouds which veiled
  the whole town in dun shadow and filled with gloom the apartment.</p>

  <p>Both the lady and her brother were very young; but on her countenance was
  a melancholy, and on his a resolution, ill-suited to their years. The
  Cavalier was fair-haired, slight, grave, and arrayed in the garb of war,
  being armed on back and breast, and carrying pistolets and a great sword.</p>

  <p>The lady was dressed in a style of fantastical richness which well became
  her delicate and unusual appearance; she wore a riding habit and it was of
  pale violet cloth, enriched with silver, and opening on a petticoat of
  deep-hued amber satin braided with a border of purple and scarlet; at her
  wrists and over her collar hung deep bands of lace; her hair was dressed in a
  multitude of little blonde curls which was like a net of gold silk wire about
  her face, and she wore a black hat crowned with many short ostrich
  feathers.</p>

  <p>Her features were sensitive, well-shaped, and showed both wit and
  melancholy, her eyes were pale brown and languid-lidded, and her lips were
  compressed in a decided line which indicated courage and determination; yet
  the prevailing impression she made was of great modesty and feminine
  tenderness.</p>

  <p>At her breast, fastened with a knot of blue silk, was a long trail of
  yellow jasmine and a white rose.</p>

  <p>'If I had been the Queen,' she said, 'I would not have gone to
  France.'</p>

  <p>'She went to gain succour, Margaret,' returned Sir Charles Lucas.</p>

  <p>'Another could have gone,' insisted the lady, resting her dreamy eyes on
  her very lovely white hands which bore several curious pearl rings. 'If I had
  a lord and he was in the situation of His Blessed Majesty, I would not have
  left him, no, not for two worlds packed with joys.'</p>

  <p>'The Queen went in April,' replied the Cavalier, 'and then matters did not
  look to be past mending.'</p>

  <p>'Yet, methinks,' said Margaret Lucas, 'that any one might have perceived
  such a temper in the Roundheads that they would not easily see reason. And,
  dear Charles, the King had been defied at Hull&mdash;what was that but a
  portent of this?</p>

  <p>'However,' she added at once, 'it is not for me to speak so of my
  sovereign lady. Oh, Charles, what a heaviness and melancholy doth encumber my
  spirits! See how the sky is also stormy and doth presage a tempest in the
  heavens, even as men's actions hasten a tempest on earth.'</p>

  <p>'Thine is not the only heart filled with foreboding to-day. Many eyes are
  already bitter with tears which shall be shed till their founts are dry
  before these troubles end,' replied the young man. 'But it is not for us to
  lament the tearing asunder of England, but to remember for which purpose we
  came hither from Colchester&mdash;to pay our duty to the King, and renew our
  oaths of fealty before his banner which shall to-day be raised.'</p>

  <p>Margaret Lucas came from the window; the brilliant light that streamed
  through the cracks in the storm-clouds made a dazzling gold of her hair, and
  slipped in lines of light down the rich silks and satins of her garments.</p>

  <p>Glorified by this strong light, she went up to her brother and laid her
  hands lightly on his shoulders, turning him, with a gentle pressure, to face
  her and look down on her lesser height.</p>

  <p>'Dear,' she said, 'dear and best&mdash;what shall come is hid by God, and
  no human eye may take a peep at it, yet we may make a guess that the times
  will be rough and disheartening, and thou wilt be thick in the midst of
  commotion. Yet whatever happen, remember thy loyal need, thy fair name; heed
  no chatter, but serve the King, under God, and keep a thought for all of
  us&mdash;and for Margaret, who hath no knight as thou hast yet no lady, have
  a sweet remembrance. God bless thee according to His will, Charles, and bring
  thee safely through these sad distresses.'</p>

  <p>The young Cavalier, much moved, drew her two hands from his shoulders and
  kissed them, and she, gazing on him with much affection and something of a
  mother's look, kissed his bent head where the light hair waved apart.</p>

  <p>Then, in a humour too solemn for speech, the two young loyalists (their
  faith was simple and admitted of no argument&mdash;to them the King could do
  no wrong) left the chamber and house, and mounting two well-kept horses and
  followed by a neat groom, rode through the streets of Nottingham towards the
  castle on the hill.</p>

  <p>There were many people abroad, and several companies of shotmen,
  musketeers, and of armed citizens marching in the direction of the castle;
  but all were silent, and most, it seemed, sad, for an air of general gloom
  overhung the town, and there was no one to break it with rejoicing or
  shouting or any enthusiasm, and though those gathered within the town might
  be tenacious in their loyalty, they were either not confident enough or not
  exalted enough in their spirits to express it by any demonstration.</p>

  <p>Margaret Lucas and her brother rode into the courtyard of the castle,
  where several companies of soldiers were gathered; some brass guns and
  demi-culverins reflected the sun in blazes of light, and a band of drummers
  and trumpeters stood ready.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Lucas perceived that Prince Rupert was already there at the
  head of a company of finely-equipped gentlemen on horseback, and rode up to
  pay his respects, having already met the Prince. Margaret remained a little
  behind among the crowd of courtiers, ladies, and citizens.</p>

  <p>Rupert's spirits were ablaze with excitement and satisfaction; he did not
  even seem to be aware of the general air of depression and apprehension. The
  King had promised him the command of the cavalry, the most important branch
  of the army, and to a Prince of his years and temperament, the glory of this
  was sufficient to obscure everything else.</p>

  <p>'Good evening, Sir Charles!' he cried; then his quick eye roved past the
  youth. 'Is not that lady your sister? The likeness is great between you.'</p>

  <p>'That is indeed Margaret Lucas,' replied her brother, 'who was visiting
  near this town, and nothing would satisfy her but joining me to-day in this
  ceremony.'</p>

  <p>'I must speak to this loyal lady,' smiled the Prince.</p>

  <p>He rode up to her and took off his hat, which was heavy with black
  plumes.</p>

  <p>'Would you not know me, Mrs. Lucas,' he asked, 'that you would stay behind
  your brother?'</p>

  <p>'I would not be uncivil to any, least to a Prince,' replied the lady, 'but
  neither would I put my conversation on any man nor be so bold as to look at
  one unbidden.'</p>

  <p>'This is a fair sweet loyalist,' said Rupert. 'Hast thou a cavalier beside
  the King?'</p>

  <p>She looked at him out of untroubled eyes; his bold, hawk-like face, the
  black eyes, the white teeth flashing in a smile, the waving black hair, the
  dark complexion above the white collar, and all his attire of scarlet and
  buff and gold and trappings of war, his great horse, and the background of
  cannon, halberdiers, and stormy heavens, made a noble and splendid
  picture.</p>

  <p>'I have no cavalier,' said Margaret Lucas calmly, 'nor have I yet seen the
  man to whom I could give my troth.'</p>

  <p>'How many years hast thou?' asked Rupert.</p>

  <p>'Highness&mdash;nineteen.'</p>

  <p>He was little older himself, but he smiled at her as he would have smiled
  at a child.</p>

  <p>'Give me your white rose,' he said; 'as thou art yet free, the gift harms
  none.'</p>

  <p>Margaret turned to her brother.</p>

  <p>'Charles, shall I?' and a faint smile touched her grave lips.</p>

  <p>'With all heartiness,' replied Sir Charles.</p>

  <p>She took the rose and jasmine from above her true heart, and her small
  hand laid them on the Prince's outstretched brown palm.</p>

  <p>He raised that hand and kissed her glove, and her eye-brows lifted
  half-humorously under her golden fringe of curls.</p>

  <p>'You are in good spirits, my lord,' she said. As Rupert, with clumsy
  carefulness, was fastening the two frail flowers in his doublet, the King
  rode into the courtyard, followed by the royal standard.</p>

  <p>Charles rode a white horse and was wrapped in a dark blue mantle, an
  unnatural pallor disfigured his cheek, and an unnatural fire sparkled in his
  restless eyes; he seemed both melancholy and excited. He did not fail of his
  usual dignity, however, and though shut within himself in an inner gloom, he
  acknowledged readily the salutes that greeted him. There was but a scanty
  crowd, both of citizens and soldiers, nor was there much fervour save among
  the courtiers and personal friends of the King.</p>

  <p>Charles glanced up at the wide, darkening sky across which the mighty
  clouds were marching, trailing fire in the west, then he turned to Prince
  Maurice, who rode at his side.</p>

  <p>'When I was crowned,' he said, in a low voice, 'they did preach a sermon
  on this text&mdash;"Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown
  of life"&mdash;and unto death I will be faithful to God, the Church of
  England, and my rightful royal heritage.'</p>

  <p>He then rode forward, and amid the music of the drums and trumpets and the
  shouts of the spectators, the Royal Standard of England was raised and
  unfurled as sign and symbol that the King called on all loyal subjects for
  their service and duty.</p>

  <p>Many of the citizens threw up their caps and called out, 'Long live King
  Charles and hang up the Roundheads!' but their cries soon ceased, and all
  gazed in a mournful silence at the great flag straining now at poles and
  ropes and flaunting the sunset with bravery of leopards and lilies and the
  rampant lion&mdash;crimson, gold, and blue.</p>

  <p>It was the symbol of war&mdash;of civil war; when it broke on the evening,
  then was all hope of peace for ever gone. All argument, appeals to law, to
  reason, all legal dispute, all compromise, was over now; henceforth the sword
  would decide.</p>

  <p>The sensitive soul of Margaret Lucas was touched by a dreadful grief; she
  bent on her saddle and wept. There was to her an almost unbearable sadness in
  the silent appeal of the lonely flag.</p>

  <p>The King glanced half-wildly round the little knot of faithful friends
  gathered about him; a silence had fallen which none seemed ready to
  break.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Charles put out his hand; a drop of rain splashed on the bare
  palm.</p>

  <p>'The storm beginneth,' he said, and turned his horse's head towards the
  castle.</p>

  <p>So they all went their several ways homeward in a wildness of wind and
  rain.</p>

  <p>The Royal Standard faced the gusty tempests for six days, then the pole
  snapped and the storm hurled it in the dust.</p>

     id="ch2-00"></a>PART II. THE MAN</h2>

  <p class="quote">'A larger soul, I think, hath seldom dwelt in a house of
  clay.'&mdash;<i>A Contemporary on Oliver Cromwell</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-01"
     id="ch2-01"></a>CHAPTER I. A LEADER OF MEN</h2>

  <p class="first">John Pym was dead.</p>

  <p>In June John Hampden had fallen in the fight at Chalgrove field, Lord
  Falkland had hurled himself on death in the front of the royalist ranks at
  Newbury, and now Pym, the bold and able leader, the dauntless spirit, the
  uncorrupted heart, had resigned the weight of his troublous years and rested
  in peace at London, where his body lay in state for good patriots to gaze on
  and mourn over before it was carried to the Abbey Church which held the
  nation's great dead.</p>

  <p>To no man in the three rent kingdoms did the news of John Pym's death come
  with such force and menace as to Oliver Cromwell, now Colonel, and Governor
  of Ely.</p>

  <p>When the Parliament had taken up arms in reply to the King's challenge at
  Nottingham, patriotic and energetic members had been given commands in the
  parliamentary army. Mr. Cromwell had raised a troop of his own in
  Cambridgeshire, had contributed out of his private means to the public
  service, had seized the magazine in Cambridge Castle, and forcibly prevented
  the University from sending its gold and silver plate to the King, and so, by
  boldness and expedition in all his actions, had justified the opinion held of
  him by his colleagues. He had been under fire at Winceby and Edgehill and in
  some other of the random skirmishes which marked the beginning of the war,
  and he had shown himself quiet and tenacious in battle. He was now the soul
  of the Eastern Association, one of the foremost of the county leagues against
  the royal tyranny, Colonel of his own troop (now nearing close on a thousand
  men), and Governor of Ely, the town of his residence, where his family had
  remained during his service in London.</p>

  <p>So the first turmoil and confusion of this most unhappy calling to arms
  had cast up Oliver Cromwell to a higher position than he could ever have
  thought of occupying in times of peace, and he had already had tumultuous
  experience of the bitternesses, difficulties, and bewilderments of one in
  authority during such momentous times.</p>

  <p>To this man, in this situation, came the news of the death of John Pym,
  and he went privately to his chamber about the time they were lighting the
  candles and considered within himself.</p>

  <p>The two leaders of the older generation, Hampden and Pym, were now gone,
  and who was there with sufficient courage and capacity, foresight and
  strength to take their place?</p>

  <p>The moment was a critical one for the Parliament. The first rush of
  enthusiasm, the first outburst of fury against the King was over; a general
  lukewarmness overspread the adherents of the popular party, and the people,
  seeing that Parliament had now gotten the sword, were waiting for a speedy
  deliverance out of trouble, and finding themselves instead in the midst of a
  bloody civil war, were inclined to clamour for a peace, however hasty and
  patched up, especially as the tide of martial success had run in favour of
  the King, thanks largely to the generalship of his nephew Rupert, and many
  faint-hearted men were beginning to remember that they were incurring the
  risk of impeachment for high treason if the King should prove the final
  victor.</p>

  <p>Those in the forefront of the parliamentary party were moderate men such
  as Essex, Warwick, Holles, Strode, Vane, and Manchester; the keen and fervent
  eye of Oliver Cromwell could see no successor to Hampden or Pym.</p>

  <p>Again there came to him remembrances of the day at St. Ives when he had
  received together absolute assurance that he was in Grace, and that the Lord
  had some uses for him. Did it not seem as if the path, at first so dim and
  obscured, was being opened out before him with greater and increasing
  clearness?</p>

  <p>He could see the dangers that threatened the liberties of England, still
  struggling with, and not yet released from, their bonds, and he marvelled if
  God had put the means of quenching these dangers into his hands; <i>no other
  were there</i> now Pym was gone, perhaps it might be that he would be
  called.</p>

  <p>There was Sir Harry Vane, with his knowledge of foreign countries and
  tongues, his pure heart and high courage, who had much of the mystic piety
  which pleased Oliver Cromwell. Yet he doubted if this man had the force and
  boldness to accomplish what must be accomplished now in England.</p>

  <p>He paced up and down the room a little, then went to the window and looked
  out on the winter afternoon; the bare trees bent and shivered beneath the
  steady sweeps of the wind in St. Mary's churchyard near by, and the towers of
  the cathedral had a bleached and homelike look against a low, dark grey
  sky.</p>

  <p>As he stood so, deep in his thoughts, he perceived, at first quite dully,
  but soon with interest, the solitary figure of a gentleman facing the wind in
  the chill street and coming towards his house.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell opened the leaded diamond pane and looked out; the
  pedestrian raised his hand to hold his hat against the wind, the beaver
  flapped back nevertheless, and the keen observer at the window recognized the
  Earl of Manchester, formerly that Lord Kimbolton who had been one of six
  members hurried from Westminster to the city, and now President of the
  Eastern Association and one of the most popular and influential men on the
  parliamentary side. Cromwell, however, had not that affection for him which
  he had formerly held; he suspected not my lord's loyalty, but his judgment,
  not his good intentions, but his strength of mind and purpose, and he saw in
  him a typical exponent of those evils and dangers his party had most to guard
  against.</p>

  <p>With a sombre expression on his clouded features he descended the modest
  stairway of his simple home; the two-storied house had come to him, together
  with the office of tithe farmer, from his wife's uncle.</p>

  <p>When he reached the hall he saw the slight figure of a girl lighting the
  lamp above the door; she turned to him with the wax taper in the silver
  holder still in her hand and the pure flame of it lighting a face at once
  resolute and gentle.</p>

  <p>The extreme plainness of her dark gown and white collar robbed her of the
  usual pleasant festive carelessness of youth, but her air of dignity and
  health and goodness was attractive enough, and she was not without
  distinction and a certain handsomeness of form and feature.</p>

  <p>At the sight of his eldest daughter Colonel Cromwell's face softened
  wonderfully, and when he spoke his voice had a note of great tenderness which
  entirely dispelled the usual harshness.</p>

  <p>'I did perceive Lord Manchester coming, Bridget,' he said. 'I pray thee
  set the candles in the little parlour. Is thy mother out?'</p>

  <p>'She hath taken Frances and Elisabeth for an airing, sir,' answered the
  girl. 'Mary remaineth with me. She will assay to help me with a tansy
  pudding.'</p>

  <p>'The odour thereof is abroad already,' said Colonel Cromwell. 'Have we not
  tansy pudding overoften, Bridget?'</p>

  <p>A look of distress flushed the serene face of the young housekeeper.</p>

  <p>'It is so difficult since the war began to vary the dishes,' she answered.
  'All commodities are so high in price and so scarce.'</p>

  <p>'I spoke lightly, dear,' interrupted her father hastily. 'Trouble not thy
  mind with this matter.'</p>

  <p>A knock sounded. Bridget Cromwell opened the door and admitted Lord
  Manchester, curtsied with great simplicity, then turned into the parlour,
  bearing with her the frail light of the taper.</p>

  <p>The two gentlemen followed her.</p>

  <p>'You have heard that John Pym is dead?' asked my lord abruptly.</p>

  <p>'But to-day, though it is a week ago. But the roads have been
  impossible.'</p>

  <p>'It is,' said Lord Manchester, 'very rough marching in the fen
  country.'</p>

  <p>'We have a great loss in Mr. Pym,' remarked Colonel Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'Sir Harry Vane will take his place.'</p>

  <p>'Umph! Sir Harry Vane!' muttered the other. 'A dreaming man.'</p>

  <p>'A moderate man,' amended my lord.</p>

  <p>'I begin,' cried Oliver Cromwell, 'to detest that word!'</p>

  <p>Bridget had lit four plain candles which stood in copper sticks on the
  mantelpiece, and, kneeling down, put her taper to the twigs under the great
  logs on the hearth. The small room, which contained neither picture nor
  ornament, but which was solidly and comfortably furnished, was now fully
  revealed, as was the figure of the Earl in his buff gallooned with gold,
  armed with sword and pistol, with his soldier's cloak falling from his
  shoulders and his beaver in his hand.</p>

  <p>Bridget blew out the taper, drew the red curtains over the window, then
  went to a great sideboard which ran half the length of the room, and was
  taking out a bell-mouthed glass and a silver tray when my lord interrupted
  her.</p>

  <p>'Not for me, my child,' he said, with a smile. 'I am lodging in Ely for
  the night, and am merely here to have a few words with Colonel Cromwell.'</p>

  <p>At this Bridget curtsied again and withdrew. As the door closed behind her
  Oliver Cromwell turned suddenly on his guest with such an expressive movement
  that my lord startled. But Cromwell said nothing.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' remarked my lord, 'since last we met much hath changed. Things show
  well for the King.'</p>

  <p>Colonel Cromwell did not speak.</p>

  <p>'And I,' continued the Earl, 'am now very desirous to stop the war.'</p>

  <p>The other took this statement quietly.</p>

  <p>'You were ever for a compromise,' he said. 'Well, well,' he smiled. 'So
  you would stop the war? Not yet, my lord, not yet. When we lay down the sword
  the King must be so defeated that he is glad to take our terms, otherwise why
  did we ever unsheath the sword?'</p>

  <p>'Success lies so far with His Majesty,' was the reply. 'Fairfax and Essex
  can hardly hold their own, Rupert hath proved a very genius, the Queen cometh
  from over seas with men and money&mdash;bethink you a little, Colonel
  Cromwell, if the King should defeat us? Death for us all, aye, to our poorest
  followers, as traitors, and his own terms imposed on a bleeding nation!'</p>

  <p>'He must not defeat us.'</p>

  <p>'The chances are against us,' said my lord uneasily.</p>

  <p>'God,' returned Colonel Cromwell, with indescribable force, reverence, and
  enthusiasm, 'is with us. Do you think He will give the victory unto the
  children of Belial?'</p>

  <p>'Even if we gain the victory,' persisted the Earl, 'the King is always the
  King.'</p>

  <p>'My lord, if that is your temper, why did you ever take up arms?'</p>

  <p>'For that cause in which I would lay them down&mdash;the cause of
  liberty.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell went to the fire and stared down at the cracking logs,
  through which the thin flames spurted.</p>

  <p>'These arguments whistle like the wind in an empty drum,' he said. 'We
  must not think of peace until we have gained that for which we made war. Is
  the moment when the King is victorious the moment to ask his terms?'</p>

  <p>'What instrument have we to defeat the King? demanded my lord.</p>

  <p>'One can be forged,' replied Oliver Cromwell. 'I do believe, as I told
  that very noble person, Mr. Hampden, that the King hath so far gained the
  advantage because the blood and breeding is in his ranks&mdash;as I said to
  my cousin, decayed serving men and tapsters will not fight like
  gentlemen&mdash;therefore if we have not as yet gentle blood, let us get the
  spirit of the Lord; faith will inspire as well as birth, my lord. I have now
  myself a lovely troop, honest men, clean livers, eager devourers of the Word,
  and had I ten times as many I would put them with great confidence against
  Rupert's godless gentlemen.'</p>

  <p>'Your troop is mostly fanatic, Anabaptist, Independent&mdash;full of
  sermons and groans,' said my lord. 'Extreme men, by your leave, Colonel
  Cromwell, and full of religious disputations.'</p>

  <p>'Admit they be&mdash;they are all enthusiasts, they fight for God, not
  pay&mdash;as Charles' gentlemen fight for loyalty, not pay&mdash;and, sir, I
  prefer them who know what they fight for, and love that they know, to any
  luke-warm hireling who will mutiny when his pence are in arrear.'</p>

  <p>'You yourself are an Independent,' remarked the Earl dryly. 'I had
  forgot.'</p>

  <p>'Sir, I belong to no sect; within the limits of the true faith I would let
  each man think as he would.'</p>

  <p>'So tolerant!' cried my lord. 'Then wherefore have you pulled the preacher
  from his pulpit in Ely Church?'</p>

  <p>'Because the Anglican rites are a mockery of the Lord,' returned Cromwell,
  with fire. 'And I would as soon have a Papist as a Prelatist&mdash;toleration
  with the true faith, I said, my lord.'</p>

  <p>'Who is to define the true faith?' asked the Earl wearily. 'I keep the
  Presbyterian doctrine which seemeth best to me, but you, methinks, would
  follow Roger Williams. Remember, sir, that you, as all of us,' he added, with
  some malice, 'must take this Covenant the Scots have put upon us as the price
  of their aid.'</p>

  <p>'That was John Pym's work,' answered Colonel Cromwell, in a slightly
  troubled manner. 'His last work&mdash;'twas a galling condition, and at the
  time I blamed him; but, sir, we had to have the Scottish army, and as they
  would not give the army without we took the Covenant&mdash;well, Mr. Pym was
  a wise man, and he judged it best&mdash;and we have the Scots (for what they
  may be worth) marching to us instead of to the King.'</p>

  <p>'When you take up your appointment as my Lieutenant-General,' insisted the
  Earl, 'you, too, must take the Covenant.'</p>

  <p>'Any man may take it now Sir Harry Vane, that lovely soul, hath added his
  clause&mdash;<i>that religion be reformed in England according to the Word of
  God</i>; that covereth everything, I think, sir, the <i>Word of God</i>, not
  the dictates of the Scots!'</p>

  <p>Lord Manchester looked at him in silence for an attentive moment, then
  spoke briskly.</p>

  <p>'You follow Sir Harry Vane in religion, do you follow him in politics? Are
  you, too, a Republican?'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell looked at him quietly and frankly.</p>

  <p>'I think a kingly government a good one,' he said, 'if the king be a just,
  wise man. Nay, I never was a Republican.'</p>

  <p>'Remember we stand for King and Parliament,' remarked the Earl. 'I would
  not go too far&mdash;I would not overthrow the authority of His Majesty.'</p>

  <p>'What care I what man holdeth authority in England as long as he is
  powerless to do her wrong,' replied Cromwell quietly. 'Sir, all I say is that
  the time hath not come for peace save it be offered by His Majesty. Now is
  still the misty morning when all is doubtful to our eyes but presently the
  sun shall rise above the vapours, and we shall behold very clearly the things
  we have to do. The Lord will strengthen our hands and show us the way, and
  His enemies shall go down like a tottering wall and a broken hedge.'</p>

  <p>The Earl moved about restlessly.</p>

  <p>'You have great faith, Colonel Cromwell,' he said, half sad, half
  vexed.</p>

  <p>The fire had now sprung up strongly and threw a vivid light over the
  figure of the Puritan soldier standing thoughtfully on his homely hearth.</p>

  <p>'Have I not need of faith?' he asked, in an exalted voice. 'Aye, the
  shield of faith and the breastplate of righteousness and the sword of the
  spirit which is the Word of God! "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
  but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
  darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places!"'</p>

  <p>The Earl made no reply; he was moved by the sincerity and force with which
  Colonel Cromwell spoke, but at the same time he was appalled by the prospect
  which a continuance of the war seemed to open up. He, like many others, was
  confused, bewildered, alarmed by the tremendous thing the Parliament had
  dared to do, and he wished to stop a crisis which was becoming immense and
  overwhelming; he wished to keep the King and the Church in their ancient
  places, and he felt more or less vaguely that men such as Oliver Cromwell
  were aiming at a new order of things altogether.</p>

  <p>Colonel Cromwell, on the other hand, was not confused by the thought of
  any future issues; he saw one thing, and that plainly; in the present
  struggle between the King and the Parliament, the Parliament must be
  victorious; then the future government of England might be decided, not
  before.</p>

  <p>He felt that there was no longer much use for men like my Lord Manchester,
  able and popular as he was; the stern fanatics among his own arquebusiers who
  spent their time in minute disputes and arguments on matters of religious
  discipline were more to the liking of Oliver Cromwell.</p>

  <p>The Earl rose to take his leave.</p>

  <p>'I am at my ancient lodging,' he said. May I expect you to-morrow morning?
  There arc some military points I would discuss with you.'</p>

  <p>'Command me to your own convenience,' replied Colonel Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow, then.'</p>

  <p>The two went into the hall, which was filled by the smell of the tansy
  pudding.</p>

  <p>My lord asked after the eldest son of his host.</p>

  <p>'He is very well, I thank you. He is at Newport Pagnell with my Lord St.
  John's troop of horse. Richard is still at Felsted, as is Henry; but I mean
  soon to take them from their schooling and put them in the army. Fairfax
  would take one in his lifeguards; Harrison, I think, another.'</p>

  <p>'So soon!' exclaimed my lord. Their years are very tender.'</p>

  <p>Colonel Cromwell smiled.</p>

  <p>'But the times are very rough, and we must suit ourselves to the
  times.'</p>

  <p>He opened the door; Ely showed bare and dreary beneath the darkening sky,
  from which a few flakes of snow were beginning to slowly fall. The two
  gentlemen touched hands and parted. As Colonel Cromwell still stood at the
  door of his house, gazing thoughtfully at the winter evening as if he saw
  there some sign or character plain for his reading, his wife descended the
  stairs and, seeing him there, came to his side. She had a bunch of keys in
  her hand, and the light from the lamp above the door gleamed on them. Her
  docile eyes lifted to his; her face had a look of stillness; she seemed a
  creature made for quietness.</p>

  <p>'What had my lord to say?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Peace! peace!' muttered her husband. 'He wanted peace!'</p>

  <p>'And you?' she ventured timidly.</p>

  <p>'I!' he answered. 'I live in Meshech and Kedar. I am in blackness and in
  the waste places; but the Lord hath had exceeding mercy upon me&mdash;I have
  seen light in His Light&mdash;therefore am I confident in the hope I may
  serve Him. His will be done!'</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell looked out at the dim white towers of the cathedral,
  where her first husband and her first-born lay buried, and she thought of
  that other child, Robert, who had died at school only three years before.
  Life seemed to her suddenly unreal. She closed the door and turned away.</p>

  <p>Her husband followed her into the room on the right of the passage, where
  a fair group of children, Mary, Frances, and Elisabeth, were roasting
  chestnuts by the fire.</p>

  <p>A maid was putting a white cloth on the table; the pleasant clink of
  glasses and china mingled with the laughter and talk of Elisabeth, a
  beautiful child of some thirteen years, whose grace and gaiety was a sudden
  brightness in the Puritan household.</p>

  <p>At her father's entrance she came to him at once and showed him a round
  ball she had made of holly berries and hung by a red ribbon as an ornament to
  her wrist.</p>

  <p>'Vanity!' said Colonel Cromwell; but as he kissed her his whole face was
  radiant with love.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-02"
     id="ch2-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE QUEEN'S FAREWELL</h2>

  <p class="first">It was in the July following the winter when he had first
  come to discussion with my Lord Manchester that Oliver Cromwell, now the
  Earl's Lieutenant-General, flamed suddenly into great brilliance over
  England.</p>

  <p>By his valour and skill he had turned the tide at Marston, after
  Manchester, Fairfax, and Leven had fled from the battle as lost; he had
  beaten Rupert's victorious horse with his own light cavalry, and he had led
  the Scottish infantry in an overwhelming charge against the enemy. The north
  of England was now lost to the King, the prestige of the parliamentary army
  had never stood higher, and Oliver Cromwell was become the foremost soldier
  in their ranks, both for fame and success.</p>

  <p>Such were the results of the battle at Marston Moor but Manchester
  appeared to be more frightened than encouraged at the victory. He almost
  refused to fight; his indecision lost the battle of Newbury; he allowed the
  King to relieve Donnington Castle; he would not go to the help of Essex, who
  was losing ground in the south; he and his Lieutenant-General had high
  altercations; the Scottish Presbyterian party proposed terms to the King,
  which Charles haughtily refused. After this failure they were somewhat
  quieter, though two of their leaders, Essex and Hones, endeavoured to bring
  an action against Cromwell as an incendiary; but Cromwell himself showed tact
  and moderation sufficient to bring about a peace between the various factions
  that constituted the parliamentary forces and in the autumn of that year was
  instrumental in the creation of the New Model Army&mdash;the instrument which
  he had long been burning to handle; the instrument by which the King, still
  haughty and defiant at Oxford, in which loyal city he had his own Parliament,
  was to be finally brought to accept and keep the people's terms.</p>

  <p>Cromwell was excepted from the self-denying ordinance which ruled that no
  Members of Parliament were to bear commands in the army, and was created
  Lieutenant-General and Commander of the Horse, Fairfax being General and
  Skippon Major-General.</p>

  <p>Manchester and Essex retired with good sense and dignity.</p>

  <p>Charles, moving from Oxford, stormed Leicester; Fairfax raised the siege
  of Oxford to dash after him, and on 14th June 1645 found himself face to face
  with the King's forces at Naseby, on the borders of Northamptonshire. A
  battle was now inevitable, and by both sides it was felt that it would be
  decisive; neither side could endure a great defeat, and either side would
  become almost completely master of England by a great victory at this
  juncture. Rupert was smarting to revenge himself for Marston; the King
  despised the New Model Army, and was eager to dash to pieces this new
  instrument of his enemies; Fairfax was ardent to justify the trust reposed in
  him. Both armies were impatient to bring matters to an issue, so on each side
  were motives sufficient for fierce inspiration.</p>

  <p>The night after the armies had faced each other the King lay at Market
  Harborough, eight miles from the village of Naseby, where the parliamentary
  forces were encamped. He had his Queen with him and the infant Princess,
  recently born at Exeter, and was lodged in the modest country house of a
  certain loyal gentleman, a cadet of the noble house of Pawlet. Rupert rode up
  in the twilight from his quarters to see his uncle, and came into a peaceful,
  old walled garden, where Charles paced the daisied grass.</p>

  <p>On a bench beneath a great cedar tree sat the pale Queen, the sun and
  shade flecked all over her white dress, her baby on her knee, and by her side
  her new lady, Margaret Lucas.</p>

  <p>Prince Rupert came slowly over the lawn; his fringed leather breeches and
  Spanish boots were dusty, and his red cloak open on soiled buff and a torn
  scarf. He had a gloomy, reckless look, and his brow was frowning beneath the
  disordered black lovelocks.</p>

  <p>Charles stopped when he saw his nephew coming and asked
  abruptly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'They will fight to-morrow?'</p>

  <p>It</p>

  <p>'I think they will,' replied the Prince. He went up o the Queen and kissed
  her hand.</p>

  <p>There was the dimness of many tears in that proud woman's eyes, and the
  delicacy of her beauty had turned to a haggard air of sickness; she had,
  however, the swift, hawklike look of one whose courage is unbroken, and her
  pride was even more obviously shown now than in the days of her greatest
  splendour, when it had been cloaked with sweetness. Her worn, dark features,
  her careless dress and impatient glances, words, and movements were in great
  contrast to the careful splendour, the composed gravity, and the smooth youth
  of the blonde Margaret Lucas.</p>

  <p>'Have you come to take His Majesty away from me?' cried the Queen to
  Rupert as his lips touched her thin, cold hand.</p>

  <p>'He did promise to inspect the army to-night, Madame,' returned Rupert,
  with a certain touch of indifferency in his manner; Charles was no soldier,
  and the Prince had little deference for his opinion on military matters.</p>

  <p>'And to-morrow there will be a battle,' said the Queen. She rose suddenly,
  clasping the sleeping child to her heart her ruined eyes regained, by the
  sparkle of tears, for one moment their lost brilliancy.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Madame,' cried Margaret Lucas passionately, 'surely God will not
  permit His Majesty to be defeated!'</p>

  <p>Rupert's dark countenance flashed into a smile as he glanced at her pale
  fervency.</p>

  <p>'That cursed Cromwell is on his way to join Fairfax,' he remarked. 'Pray,
  Mrs. Lucas, that he doth not arrive in time.'</p>

  <p>'Is he so terrible a man?' asked the Queen scornfully; she could not
  endure to give even the compliment of fear to these rebels.</p>

  <p>'A half-crazed fanatic or a very cunning hypocrite,' returned the Prince;
  'but an able fighter, on my soul, Madame!'</p>

  <p>'His army consisteth of poor ignorant men,' cried Henriette Marie.
  'Surely, surely gentlemen can prevail against them.'</p>

  <p>'We will make the trial to-morrow, Madame,' said Rupert, with a flush on
  his swarthy face for the memory of Naseby. 'At least, we do not lack in
  loyalty&mdash;in endeavour&mdash;Your Majesty believeth that?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes,' said the Queen hurriedly. 'Loyalty is common enough; but where
  shall we get good counsels? Are we wise to fight the rebels to-morrow? By all
  accounts they are double our number&mdash;and if this Cromwell cometh up with
  reinforcements&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The King, who had hitherto stood silent, fingering the dark foliage on one
  of the lower sweeping branches of the cedar tree, now spoke with
  authority.</p>

  <p>'We fight to-morrow, Mary. I mean to surprise their outposts.'</p>

  <p>A pause of silence fell. The sunlight was slipping lower through the
  trees, and lay like flat gold on the lawn; the last brilliance of the day lay
  in the fair locks of Margaret Lucas, in the embroideries of her gown, in the
  swords of King and Prince, and over the frail figure of the undaunted
  Queen.</p>

  <p>'I shall see Your Majesty at the camp after supper?' asked Rupert.</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;sooner,' replied Charles.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked keenly at the young man on whom so much depended in the
  issue of to-morrow, and seemed as if she was about to make some appeal or
  exhortation; but she turned away with a mere quiet farewell. The King
  followed her with a smile to his nephew.</p>

  <p>Margaret Lucas remained under the great cedar tree and Rupert
  lingered.</p>

  <p>'The white roses are again in bloom,' he said.</p>

  <p>'When they next flourish may the King be safe in London again!' cried the
  lady.</p>

  <p>'Amen,' said Rupert. 'Do you know the noble Marquess of Newcastle, Mrs.
  Lucas?' he added, with a smile.</p>

  <p>A bright colour mounted to her alert face.</p>

  <p>'I met him in Oxford,' she returned.</p>

  <p>'I had your flowers in my Prayer Book in memory of that day we raised the
  Standard,' said the young Prince, 'and when my lord saw them, we being in
  chapel together, he did ask of them, and when he heard their history begged
  them from me. Does this anger you?'</p>

  <p>'It is not becoming that Your Highness should tell me of it,' faltered
  Margaret Lucas.</p>

  <p>'You are too modest,' smiled the Prince. 'He is a gallant lord and a
  valiant, loyal soldier. He asked me, if I saw you, to give you his
  homages.'</p>

  <p>The lady stood silent, her eyes downcast, the quick blood coming and going
  in her noble face. Rupert waited.</p>

  <p>'Have you no answer to the princely Marquess?' he asked.</p>

  <p>Margaret Lucas lifted her head.</p>

  <p>'Tell him to&mdash;keep&mdash;the flowers,' she stammered.</p>

  <p>With that she turned away as if she was frightened of having said too
  much; the young General laughed a little and went back towards the house,
  whistling the air of a German song.</p>

  <p>Margaret stood staring over her shoulder after him; all the misfortunes of
  the State, of her own family, all the hideous sights and sad stories which
  had weighed her heart with black bitterness, the danger of her beloved
  brother, her own precarious situation&mdash;all these things were forgotten
  in one great flash of happiness.</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands tightly.</p>

  <p>'How I do love thee, thou excellent gentleman,' she murmured, 'even with
  an affection that is so beyond modesty and reason that if thou wert here I
  could avow it to thy face! God protect thee, dear, loyal lord!'</p>

  <p>The sun had now sunk behind the trees and hedges of the orchard; the last
  bee had flown; the roses gave forth their strength in a more intense perfume;
  the sky changed to a sparkling violet, glimmering with rosy gold in the
  west.</p>

  <p>The Queen called Margaret Lucas, and, putting the little Princess in her
  arms, bid her go and take the child to her women.</p>

  <p>Margaret made her grave and humble obeisances and withdrew, holding the
  King's youngest born over a joyful heart.</p>

  <p>'Mary,' said Charles, taking his wife's hand, 'if I fail to-morrow you
  will go to France. Promise me.'</p>

  <p>'You must not fail,' she answered passionately. But I give you this
  promise if it makes you fight with a lighter conscience.'</p>

  <p>'A light conscience!' echoed the King. 'Methinks I shall never own a light
  conscience again.'</p>

  <p>'You are too discouraged,' murmured the Queen, but with a kind of
  lassitude.</p>

  <p>They went together into the house, and he told her of the arrangements he
  had made for her safe conduct to the coast in case of his defeat. She
  listened and made no reply.</p>

  <p>They entered the sitting-room that opened on the garden, and the King
  closed the door, for he could hear some of his gentlemen without.</p>

  <p>Henriette Marie seated herself on a worn leather couch and looked at her
  husband.</p>

  <p>His face was pallid, his eyes heavy and shadowed, his hair damp about the
  brow; he continually put his hand above his eyes or above his heart.</p>

  <p>'Last night I dreamt of Strafford,' he said suddenly. 'It was a dream!'
  answered the Queen. 'Is this a time to dwell on things unfortunate?</p>

  <p>He made no reply; he moved about the darkening room, aimlessly touching
  the furniture and the walls. At last he stopped before the inert figure of
  his wife.</p>

  <p>'Farewell, sweet,' he said. 'I have to join the Prince.'</p>

  <p>'Farewell,' she murmured.</p>

  <p>He moved towards the door and she sprang up.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' she exclaimed, in a tone of horror, 'this may be our last
  meeting!'</p>

  <p>Charles turned, startled.</p>

  <p>Dear God forbid!' he cried.</p>

  <p>'If&mdash;the worst cometh&mdash;if I go to France&mdash;ah, when shall I
  again behold you?'</p>

  <p>'Hast thou also evil premonitions?' asked the King, with a shudder.</p>

  <p>She controlled herself.</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied through stiff lips. 'No&mdash;no&mdash;but many thoughts
  press on my heart, and I am weak of late.'</p>

  <p>Indeed, she felt all her limbs tremble, so that they would no longer
  support her, and she sat down on the couch again, cold from head to foot.</p>

  <p>Charles stood beside her, gazing with the soul's deepest passion of love
  and anguish at her bowed dark head.</p>

  <p>'Kiss me and go,' she said. 'What can I say? You know my whole heart. All
  hath been said between you and me. We have been surprised by misfortune, and
  I am something unprepared. But never doubt that I love thee wholly.'</p>

  <p>The King again made that gesture of his hand, pressed first to his heart
  and then to his forehead, as if heart and head were equally wounded, then he
  went to a corner of the room where an old clavichord stood and lifted up the
  cover.</p>

  <p>'Sing to me before I go, Mary,' he whispered.</p>

  <p>The Queen rose heavily. Her bold spirit was bent with gloom; ill-health
  and the continual failure of the King's intrigues and the King's arms had
  given her a kind of disgust of life. As she had been more despotic than the
  King in prosperity, so she was more bitter and stern in adversity. As she
  crossed the window, open on the soft dimness of the garden, she thought,
  through her miserable languor, 'If, indeed, I never see him again, the scent
  of these roses will be with me all my life.'</p>

  <p>'I will light the candles,' said Charles.</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;no,' she answered. She seated herself and her hands touched the
  keys.</p>

  <p>Her voice, once the pride of two courts and her greatest accomplishment,
  rose in a little French song; but tears and suffering had taken the clearness
  from her notes that once had rung so true.</p>

  <p>At the end of the first verse she broke down and, putting her hands before
  her face, wept.</p>

  <p>'I do love thee,' said the King, bending over her in a passion of
  tenderness. 'More than words can rehearse I do love thee, dear Mary, and have
  loved thee all my days. Be not confounded&mdash;it cannot be God's will to
  desert us utterly. Hold up your heart. Oh, I do love thee, or I had rather
  not have lived to see my present miseries&mdash;but thou hast made life worth
  while to me. My dear wife&mdash;my dear, dear wife.'</p>

  <p>The Queen did not move, and her dry, difficult sobs did not cease.</p>

  <p>'Oh, love that is so weak,' cried the King, 'that it cannot do more than
  this...to see thee thus...what greater misery could I have than to see thee
  thus.'</p>

  <p>Still she did not speak. She had done much for him&mdash;crossed the seas
  and become a supplicant at her brother's court, sold her jewels, persuaded,
  inspired, and led many to join his standard, raised an army for his cause,
  been untiring and dauntless in her counsels, her energy, her confidence; but
  now a fatigue that was like despair was over her. She felt about him a
  fatality as if success was impossible for him, and all her ruined pride and
  splendour, her lost hopes, her lost endeavours crowded upon her till she
  could do nothing but weep.</p>

  <p>Charles stooped and, with infinite gentleness, drew her hands from her
  face.</p>

  <p>'This is a bad augury for me to-morrow,' he said.</p>

  <p>She lifted her head then, the sobs still catching her throat. It was too
  dark for him to see her face, distorted by tears; only the dim white oval of
  it showed in the dusk.</p>

  <p>'No bad auguries,' she said. 'No&mdash;to-morrow must see a turn in our
  miserable fortunes.'</p>

  <p>He kissed her with a trembling reverence of devotion, and her tears dried
  on his cold cheek.</p>

  <p>'Have confidence,' she murmured, her face pressed against his lace collar.
  She was always heartening him, firing his hesitation, directing his
  indecision, and the instinct of guiding and inspiring him came to her now
  even in her moment of weakness. 'Have no sad thoughts, no ill
  thoughts&mdash;God will fight for his anointed King. If I seem confounded,
  consider that I have been troubled with many things.'</p>

  <p>He drew her gently towards the window, and they stood together looking out
  on to the garden. The white hawthorn and roses, the last lilac still showed
  pallid through the gloaming; the stars were beginning to sparkle in a sky
  from which the gold had faded, leaving it the colour of dead violets; the
  pure air was rich and sweet as honey.</p>

  <p>'Whatever betide,' said the King, remember this&mdash;I will never forsake
  my children's heritage nor my faith.'</p>

  <p>He had always scrupulously kept his promise never to discuss religion with
  his Papist Queen, and he did not emphasize his resolve to remain for ever
  faithful to the Church of England. She knew this constancy of his and admired
  it, but now she said nothing of these matters.</p>

  <p>'Whatever befall,' she replied, 'you are always the King.'</p>

  <p>'I shall not forget it,' he said, with a kind of passion.</p>

  <p>Another moment of silence passed, during which their thoughts burnt like
  fire in their hearts and brains, then he moved to go, stammering
  farewells.</p>

  <p>Thrice he turned back to embrace her again, thrice her hands clung to him
  with a desperation almost beyond her control, while her lips tried to form in
  words what no words could say.</p>

  <p>Then at length he was gone, and she heard the door shut.</p>

  <p>'I will not watch him ride <i>away</i>,' she said to herself. 'I will wait
  and watch his return.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly she thought of Lady Strafford and of the last time she had spoken
  with the Countess.</p>

  <p>'O, God,' she cried, 'if I should never see Charles again!'</p>

  <p>She turned to go after him, but controlled herself from this folly and
  stood huddled in the window watching the night moths flutter, shadows among
  shadows, and the chilly moon brighten from a wraith to gleaming silver among
  the whispering orchard trees.</p>

  <p>She stood so until she heard the bugles that announced the King's
  departure, then she went to her prayers to supplicate the Madonna and the
  saints with bitter tears and bitter forebodings.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-03"
     id="ch2-03"></a>CHAPTER III. THE GREAT FIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">That evening, while the King was reviewing his troops at
  Harborough and giving them the word for to-morrow&mdash;'Mary'&mdash;while
  General Sir Thomas Fairfax was holding a council at Naseby,
  Lieutenant-General Cromwell was hastening over the borders of
  Northamptonshire with six hundred men towards the headquarters of the
  parliamentary army, which he reached about five in the morning under the
  light of a cloudless dawn.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the village he halted for an instant and surveyed with
  a keen eye the undulating open space of ground which rolled towards
  Guilsborough and Daventry; unfenced ground, full of rabbit holes and covered
  with short, sweet grass and flowers, above which the larks were singing.</p>

  <p>The pure summer morning was full of gentle airs blowing from orchards and
  gardens and the scents of all fresh green things opening with the opening
  day.</p>

  <p>Silent lay the hamlet of Naseby, the white thatched cottages, the two
  straggling streets, the old church with a copper ball glittering on the
  spire, all clearly outlined in the first fair unstained light of the sun.</p>

  <p>Beyond lay the parliamentary army; a sober force with their pennons,
  flags, and colours already displayed among them, and the gold fire gleaming
  along their brass cannon.</p>

  <p>Cromwell and his six hundred, dusty from the night's ride, swept, a flash
  of steel on leather, a tramp of hoofs, a cloud of dust, through Naseby, where
  the villagers crowded at windows and doors, not knowing whether to curse them
  or bless them, and so to the headquarters of General Sir Thomas Fairfax.</p>

  <p>As the new-comers passed through the army and were recognized for
  Lieutenant-General Cromwell and his men, whom Rupert had, after Marston Moor,
  nicknamed 'Ironsides,' the soldiers turned and shouted as with one voice, for
  it had lately been very commonly observed that where Cromwell went there was
  the blessing of God.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Fairfax was already on horseback, and the two Generals met and
  saluted without dismounting.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell looked pale, and when he lifted his beaver the grey
  strands showed in his thick hair; the war had told on him. He had lost his
  second son and a nephew. His natural melancholy had been increased by this
  and by the bloody waste he had daily to witness, by the continual bitterness
  and horror of the struggle; but the exaltation of his stern faith still
  showed in his expression, and he sat erect in his saddle, a massive figure
  solid as carved oak, in his buff and steel corselet.</p>

  <p>General Fairfax was a different type of man, patriotic and honourable as
  his Lieutenant-General, but cultured, fond of letters, lukewarm in religion,
  and not given to extremes. Cromwell, however, found him more acceptable than
  Manchester or Essex.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' cried the General, 'you are as welcome to me as water in a drought.
  Sir, I give to you the command of all the horse, and may you do the good
  service you did at Long Marston Moor.'</p>

  <p>'We are but a company of poor ignorant men, General Fairfax,' replied
  Oliver Cromwell, 'and the malignants, I hear, make great scorn of us as a
  rabble that are to be taught a lesson. Yet I do smile out to God in praises,
  in assurance of victory, for He will, by things that are not, bring to naught
  things that are!'</p>

  <p>'We have to-day a great task,' said Sir Thomas Fairfax, 'for if the King
  gaineth the victory he will press on to London&mdash;and once there he may
  regain his old standing; whereas if he faileth, he will never more, I think,
  be able to bring an army into the field.'</p>

  <p>'Make no pause and have no misgiving, sir,' replied Cromwell. 'God hath
  put the sword into the hands of the Parliament for the punishment of
  evil-doers and the confusion of His enemies, and He will not forsake us. Sir,
  I will about the marshalling of the horse, for I do perceive that we are as
  yet not all gotten in order.'</p>

  <p>The army indeed, though armed and mounted, was not yet arranged in any
  order of battle, and at this moment there came a message from one of the
  outposts that the King's forces, in good order, were marching from
  Harborough.</p>

  <p>Fairfax with his staff galloped to a little eminence beyond some apple
  orchards that fenced in the broad graveyard of the church. By the aid of
  perspective glasses they could very clearly see the army of the
  King&mdash;the flower of the loyal gentlemen of England, the final effort and
  hope of Majesty (for this force was Charles' utmost, and all men knew
  it)&mdash;marching in good array and with a gallant show, foot and horse,
  from Harborough. The Royal Standard was borne before, and, they being not
  much over a mile away, Cromwell, through the glasses, could discern a figure
  in a red montero, such as Fairfax wore, riding at the head of the
  cavalry.</p>

  <p>'Tis Rupert, that son of Baal,' he muttered sternly. 'The false Arminian
  fighteth well&mdash;yet what availeth his prowess, when his end shall be that
  outer darkness where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth?'</p>

  <p>Near by, higher than the old copper ball of the church, a tiny lark sang;
  the bees hovered in the thyme at their feet; the stainless blue of the
  heavens deepened with the strengthening day. A sudden sense of the peace and
  loveliness of the scene touched the sensitive heart of Sir Thomas
  Fairfax.</p>

  <p>'English against English, on English land!' he cried. 'The pity of it! God
  grant that we do right!'</p>

  <p>Cromwell turned in his saddle, his heavy brows drawn together.</p>

  <p>'Dost thou doubt it?' he demanded. 'Art thou like the Laodicean, neither
  hot nor cold?'</p>

  <p>'I think of England,' replied the General, 'and of what we destroy
  herein&mdash;fairness and tranquillity vanisheth from the land like breath
  from off a glass!'</p>

  <p>Cromwell pointed his rough gauntleted hand towards the approaching royal
  forces.</p>

  <p>'Dost thou believe,' he asked, 'that by leaving those in power we secure
  tranquillity and repose? I tell thee, every drop of blood shed to-day will be
  more potent to buy us peace than years of gentle argument.'</p>

  <p>'Thou,' said Sir Thomas Fairfax, 'art a man of a determined
  nature&mdash;but I am something slow-footed. To our work now, sir, and may
  this bloody business come to a speedy issue!'</p>

  <p>Cromwell rode with his own troop down the little hillside to take up his
  position at the head of the cavalry on the right, the left wing being under
  Ireton, the infantry in the centre being under the command of Skippon, the
  Scotsman, the whole under the supervision of Fairfax. This deposition of the
  army was hastily come to, for there was not an instant to lose; indeed, the
  Parliamentarians had scarcely gained the top of the low ridge which ran
  between the hedges, dividing Naseby from Sulby and Clipston, when the King's
  army came into view across Broadmoor, Rupert opposite Ireton, Langdale and
  his horse facing Cromwell and the Ironsides, Lord Astley in the centre, with
  the infantry and the King himself in armour riding in front.</p>

  <p>Fairfax posted Okey's dragoons behind the bridges running to Sulby, and
  flung forward his foot to meet the advancing line of the royalist attack. The
  infantry discharged their pieces, and the first horrid sound of firing and
  thick stench of gunpowder disturbed the serene morning.</p>

  <p>Then began the bloody and awful fight. Up and down the undulating ground
  English struggled with English, the colours rocked and dipped above the
  swaying lines of men, the demi-culverins and demi-sakers roared and smoked,
  the horse charged and wheeled and wheeled and charged again. The mounting sun
  shone on a confusion of steel and scarlet, sword and musket, spurt of fire
  and splash of blood, on many a grim face distorted with battle fury, on many
  a fair, youthful face sinking on to the trampled earth to rise no more, on
  many fair locks of loyal gentlemen, combed and dressed last night and now
  fallen in the bloody mire never to be tended or caressed again, on many a
  stern peasant or yeoman going fiercely out into eternity with his word of
  'God with us!' on his stiffening lips.</p>

  <p>Lord Astley swept back Skippon's first line on to the reserve. Rupert,
  hurling his horse through the sharp fire of Okey's dragoons, broke up
  Ireton's cavalry, and for all their stubborn fighting bore them back towards
  Naseby village. Uplifted swords, maddened horses, slipping, falling,
  staggering up again, the shouting, flushed Cavaliers, the bitter, silent
  Roundheads struggled together towards the hamlet and church. In the midst was
  always Rupert, hatless now, and notable for his black hair flying and his red
  cloak and his sword red up to the hilt.</p>

  <p>Fairfax looked and saw his left wing shattered, his infantry overpressed
  and in confusion, the ignorant recruits giving ground, the officers in vain
  endeavouring to rally them, and his heart gave a sick swerve; he dashed to
  the right, where Cromwell was fighting Langdale, whose northern horsemen were
  scattered right and left before the terrible onslaught of the Ironsides.</p>

  <p>As Cromwell, completely victorious, thundered back from this charge, he
  met his General. He did not need, however, Sir Thomas Fairfax to tell him how
  matters went; his keen eye saw through the battle smoke the colours of the
  infantry being beaten back into the reserve, and he rose up in his stirrups
  and waved on his men.</p>

  <p>'God with us!' broke from the lips of the Puritans as their commander
  re-formed them.</p>

  <p>God with us!' shouted Cromwell.</p>

  <p>One regiment he sent to pursue Langdale's flying host; the rest he wheeled
  round to the support of the foot.</p>

  <p>Rupert had left the field in pursuit of Ireton; there was no one to
  withstand the charge of the Ironsides as they hurled themselves, sword in
  hand, into the centre of the battle.</p>

  <p>A great cheer and shout arose from the almost overborne ranks of Fairfax
  and Skippon when they saw the cavalry dashing to their rescue, and a groan
  broke from Charles when he beheld his foot being cut down before the charge
  of the Parliamentarians.</p>

  <p>He rode up and down like a man demented, crying through the storm and
  smoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Where is Rupert? Is he not here to protect my loyal foot?'</p>

  <p>But the Prince was plundering Fairfax's baggage at Naseby, and the
  infantry were left alone to face the Ironsides.</p>

  <p>They faced about for their death with incredible courage, being now
  outnumbered one to two, forming again and again under the enemy's fire,
  closing up their ranks with silent resolution, one falling, another taking
  his place, mown down beneath the horses till their dead became more than the
  living, yet never faltering in their stubborn resolution.</p>

  <p>One after another these English gentlemen, pikemen, and shotmen went down,
  slain by English hands, watering English earth with their blood, gasping out
  their lives on the rabbit holes and torn grass, swords, pikes, and muskets
  sinking from their hands, hideously wounded, defiled with blood and dirt,
  distorted with agony, dying without complaint for the truth as they saw truth
  and loyalty as they conceived loyalty. One little phalanx resisted even the
  charge of the Ironsides, though attacked front and flank; they did not break.
  As long as they had a shot they fired; when their ammunition was finished
  they waited the charge of Fairfax with clubbed muskets. Their leader was a
  youth in his early summer with fair, uncovered head and a rich dress. He fell
  three times; when he rose no more his troop continued their resistance until
  the last man was slain. Then the Ironsides swept across their bodies and
  charged the last remnant of the King's infantry.</p>

  <p>Charles Stewart, watching with agony and dismay the loss of his foot and
  guns, rode from point to point of the bitter battle, vainly endeavouring to
  rally his broken forces.</p>

  <p>Such as was left of Langdale's horse gathered round him, and at this point
  up came Rupert, flushed and breathless, his men exhausted from the pursuit
  and loaded with plunder.</p>

  <p>'Thou art too late,' said the King sternly, pointing to the awful
  smoke-hung field. 'Hadst thou come sooner some loyal blood might have been
  saved.'</p>

  <p>It was the sole reproach he made; he was past anger as he was past
  hope.</p>

  <p>'God damn and the devil roast them!' cried Rupert, in a fury. 'But we will
  withstand them yet!'</p>

  <p>With swiftness and skill he seconded the King's courageous efforts to
  rally the remnant of the horse, and these drew up for a final stand in front
  of the baggage wagons and carriages, where the camp followers shrieked and
  cowered.</p>

  <p>For the third time Oliver Cromwell formed his cavalry, being now joined by
  Ireton, who, though wounded, had rallied the survivors of Rupert's pursuit,
  and now, in good order and accompanied by the shotmen and dragoons, advanced
  towards the remnants of the royal horse.</p>

  <p>The King seemed like one heedless of his fate; his face was colourless and
  distorted, the drying tears stained his cheek. He looked over the hillocks
  scattered with the dead and dying who had fallen for him, and he muttered
  twice, through twitching lips&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Broken, broken! Lost, lost!'</p>

  <p>The parliamentary dragoons commencing fire, Rupert headed his line for his
  usual reckless charge, and Charles, galloping to the front, was about to
  press straight on the enemy's fire, where a group of Cavaliers rode up to
  him, and one of them, Lord Carnwath, swore fiercely and cried out&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Will you go upon your death in an instant?'</p>

  <p>The King turned his head and gave him a dazed look, whereon in a trice the
  Scots lord seized the King's foam-flecked bridle, and turned about his
  horse.</p>

  <p>'This was a fight for all in all, and it is lost!' cried Charles.</p>

  <p>Seeing the King turn from the battlefield, his cavalry turned about too as
  one man, and galloped after him on the spur, without waiting for the third
  charge of Cromwell's Ironsides, who chased them through Harborough, from
  whence the Queen, on news of how the day was going, had an hour before fled,
  and along the Leicester road.</p>

  <p>The regiments that remained took possession of the King's baggage, his
  guns and wagons, his standards and colours, his carriages, including the
  royal coach, and made prisoner every man left alive on the field.</p>

  <p>In the carriages were many ladies of quality, sickened and maddened,
  shrieking and desperate, who were seized and hurried away in their fine
  embroidered clothes and fallen hair&mdash;calling on the God who had deserted
  them&mdash;carried across the field strewn with their slain kinsmen to what
  rude place of safety might be devised.</p>

  <p>Nor was any roughness exercised against them, for they were English and
  defenceless.</p>

  <p>The Irish camp followers were neither English nor defenceless, even the
  most wretched tattered woman of them had a skean knife at her belt, and used
  it with yelling violence.</p>

  <p>'What mercy for such as these, accursed of God and man&mdash;the same
  breed as those who rose and murdered the English in Ulster?'</p>

  <p>'What of these vermin?' asked an officer of Cromwell, when he galloped
  past in pursuit of the royalists.</p>

  <p>'Is there not an ordinance against Papists?' was the answer, hurled harsh
  and rough through the turmoil. 'To the sword with the enemies of God!'</p>

  <p>It was done.</p>

  <p>Midday had not yet been reached; the whole awful fight had hardly occupied
  three hours, and now the King had fled with his broken troops, and from among
  the baggage wagons, the stuffs, the clothes, the food, the hasty tents, the
  Puritans drove into the open the wretched Irish women, wild creatures, full
  of a shrieking defiance and foul cursing, pitiful too in their rags and dirty
  finery, their impotence, their despair.</p>

  <p>Some were young enough and fair enough, but smooth cheeks and bright eyes
  and white arms worked no enchantment here; sword and bullet made short shrift
  of them and their knives and curses.</p>

  <p>'In the name of Christ!' cried one, clinging half-naked to an Ironside
  captain.</p>

  <p>'In the name of Christ!' he repeated fiercely, and dispatched her with his
  own hand.</p>

  <p>Then that too was over; the last woman's voice shrieking to saint and
  Madonna was quieted; the last huddled form had quivered into stillness on the
  profaned earth, the carbines were shouldered, the swords sheathed, and the
  Puritans turned back with their captured colours and standards, such plunder
  as could be met with, and the King's secret cabinet, recklessly left in his
  carriage, and full, as the first glance showed, of secret and fatal
  papers.</p>

  <p>The dial on the church front at Naseby hamlet did not yet point to twelve;
  across the graves lay Ireton's men and Rupert's Cavaliers, their blood
  mingling in the daisied grass; the copper ball which had overlooked a day of
  another such sights beyond the sea, still gleamed against a cloudless sky,
  and above it, in the purer, upper air, the lark still poured forth his
  immutable song which the living were as deaf to as the dead.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-04"
     id="ch2-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE DEAD CAVALIER</h2>

  <p class="first">Lieutenant-General Cromwell pursued the King to within sight
  of Leicester, nine miles beyond Harborough, to which hamlet he returned with
  his troop towards the close of day.</p>

  <p>The royalists, who had filled Harborough twenty-four hours before, were
  now scattered like dust before the wind; the house where the King and Queen
  had stayed the previous night was deserted, and this Cromwell and some of his
  officers took possession of, as the most commodious in the place.</p>

  <p>The church, after being despoiled of painting, carving, coloured glass,
  and altar, was used partly as a stable and partly as a prison for the few
  captives the Parliamentarians had with them.</p>

  <p>Cromwell watched this work completed, then rode across the fragments of
  broken tombs and shattered glass, flung out of the church, to the house where
  Charles Stewart had taken farewell of his wife the day before.</p>

  <p>The furniture the Queen had used was still in its place; in the parlour
  where Cromwell entered with Ireton stood the clavichord open, as Henriette
  Marie had left it when she broke down over her French song; a glove and a
  scarf belonging to Margaret Lucas lay on the couch, the windows were wide on
  the beautiful garden which again sent up sweet scents to the evening air.</p>

  <p>Cromwell noticed none of these things; he was not a man of exquisite
  senses; perfume and flowers, green trees and sunshine were as little to him
  as they could be to any healthy man, and as for delights of man's making, he
  abhorred them all as vanities, from pictures and music, fine dwellings and
  costly gardens, to ruffles and fringed breeches.</p>

  <p>Ireton was, if anything, a man even stiffer and more rigid in his ideas.
  They both sat down to their supper in the delicate little room which had been
  some one's home, without the least regard to their surroundings, either the
  luxurious furniture or the fair garden giving forth sweets to the evening
  air.</p>

  <p>Neither had changed their dusty, blood-stained leather and steel; Cromwell
  cast his beaver and gloves on to the satin couch, and Ireton flung his on to
  the polished floor.</p>

  <p>A soldier brought in bread, meat, cheese, and beer from the inn; nothing
  more was to be had. Cromwell, who had not eaten since the night before, did
  not complain, but finished his food with a good appetite.</p>

  <p>Though he had been twenty-four hours in the saddle, he was too strong a
  man to feel more than an ordinary weariness, and the exaltation of his
  spirits made him forget the slight fatigue of his body.</p>

  <p>The two soldiers said little while they were eating, save to now and then
  make some remark on the number of the malignants slain or captured, or some
  ejaculations as to the might and power of the Lord who had now so signally
  demonstrated that His countenance was turned towards them.</p>

  <p>Henry Ireton was a man after Cromwell's own heart, one of the choicest of
  that little band who had taken the place of the older patriots, such as Pym
  and Hampden. Blake and Sydney were two others; Sir Harry Vane, who was of my
  late Lord Falkland's temper, Cromwell considered less well suited to the
  times; Fairfax he had some doubts of; and Manchester, Essex, and their kind
  he regarded as little better than Laodiceans.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his meal he pushed back his chair and regarded his
  companion fixedly. Ireton had taken off his corselet, bandoleer, and sword,
  and his left arm was bandaged; his extreme pallor and the drooping way he sat
  showed the severity of his wound, but it had not had power to dismay his
  spirit or to soften his stern bearing.</p>

  <p>He was a man of five-and-thirty, well born and well favoured, his features
  showing resolution, enthusiasm, capacity, and courage.</p>

  <p>'Hast thou no mind to take a wife?' asked Cromwell abruptly.</p>

  <p>'It is not for me to be thinking of marriage when the land is in
  mourning,' replied Ireton. 'Even a wilderness with the water-springs dried up
  and a fruitful land become barren.'</p>

  <p>'Peace cometh soon,' said Cromwell grimly.</p>

  <p>'Yet the King hath escaped into Oxford by now, and many places hold out
  against us,' returned Ireton.</p>

  <p>'Be not as the children of Ephraim, but remember what the Lord hath done
  for us,' said Cromwell. 'I tell thee He shall this year make an end of His
  enemies, Papist, Prelatist, and Arminian, and all such as defy Him. Is not
  His hand truly visible amongst us? Surely it would be a very atheist to doubt
  it. And for what I was about to say, Harry, coming to a plainer matter, my
  daughter Bridget is marriageable and full of piety and fear of the
  Lord&mdash;a thrifty maiden and one well-exercised in household ways, and if
  thou hast a mind to this alliance we may celebrate a marriage with the
  peace.'</p>

  <p>Ireton flushed with pleasure at this undoubted honour; for Oliver Cromwell
  had become already a considerable man, and after the splendour of to-day's
  achievements was like to become more considerable still; beside, Ireton held
  him in sincere respect and affection.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he replied, 'I am very sensible of this kindness, and if I on my
  part may satisfy what you shall demand of me, I will take a wife from thy
  hearth with as much joy as Jacob took Rachel.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell's face softened into sudden tenderness.</p>

  <p>'Thou <i>dost</i> satisfy me, Henry!' he answered. 'I have great and good
  hopes of thee. I know not why this came into my mind at this season, save
  that, seeing thee hurt and weary, methought a woman's care would not come
  ill.'</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly, to cut short Ireton's further thanks, and, going to the
  door, called for candles.</p>

  <p>Colonel Whalley and some other officers now entered, and after some
  further talk they left, Ireton with them, to see to the deposition of the new
  troops who, bringing prisoners and plunder, were continuing to pour into
  Harborough. Cromwell, left alone, called for ink and paper, and, seating
  himself anew at the table where the candles now stood among the tankards,
  plates, and knives, commenced his letter to the Speaker of the House of
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Little of the tumult filling the village reached this quiet room; outside
  the roses, lilacs, and lilies folded their parcels of sweets beneath the
  rising moon, and far off a nightingale was singing where the orchards dipped
  to a coppice, and the coppice dipped to the west.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell wrote&mdash;'Harborough, 14th June 1645.' paused a minute,
  biting his quill and frowning at the candlelight, then briefly wrote the news
  of the great victory;&mdash;</p>&lt;&lt;br&gt;

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Being commanded by
  you to this service, I think myself bound to acquaint you with the good hand
  of God towards you and us.</p>

  <p class="letter">We marched yesterday after the King, who went before us
  from Daventry to Harborough; and quartered about six miles from him. This day
  we marched towards him.</p>

  <p class="letter">He drew out to meet us; both armies engaged. We, after
  three hours' fight very doubtful, at last routed his army; killed and took
  about 5000, very many officers, but of what quality we yet know not.</p>

  <p class="letter">We also took about 200 carriages&mdash;all he had; and all
  his guns, being 12 in number, whereof 2 were demi-cannon, 2 demi-culverins,
  and (I think) the rest sakers.</p>

  <p class="letter">We pursued the enemy from three miles short of Harborough
  to nine miles beyond, even to the sight of Leicester, whither the King
  fled.'</p><br>

  <p>Having said all he could think of with regard to the actual battle that
  was of importance, Cromwell paused again and thoughtfully sharpened his
  quill.</p>

  <p>Both the mystical and practical side of him wished to improve the
  opportunity. He had lately heard how the Presbyterian party at Westminster
  was very hot against the Independents, especially such as would not take the
  Covenant, calling them Anabaptists, Sectaries, and Schismatics; and Cromwell,
  who was for liberty of conscience and toleration within Puritan bounds, and
  who was, if he was anything, an Independent himself and no lover of the Scots
  or their Covenant, wished to impress the Parliament with the worth of these
  despised sects, at the same time to magnify God for what He had done for
  them.</p>

  <p>He wished also to give praise to Fairfax, who, under the Lord, he
  considered the author of this victory.</p>

  <p>After labouring a little further in thought, he added this to his
  letter</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Sir, this is none other but the hand of God; and to Him
  alone belongs the glory wherein none are to share with Him.</p>

  <p class="letter">The General served you with all faithfulness and honour;
  and the best commendation I can give him is, that I dare say he attributes it
  all to God and would rather perish than assume to himself.</p>

  <p class="letter">Which is an honest and a thriving way, and yet as much for
  bravery may be given to him in this action as to a man.'</p><br>

  <p>Having thus done justice to his General, the Puritan endeavoured to do
  justice to his soldiers, and to give a timely warning to the Presbyterians.
  He dipped his quill into the ink-dish and added, with a firm hand and a bent
  brow, frowning:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Honest men served you faithfully in this action. Sir, they
  are trusty; I beseech you, in the name of God, not to discourage them.</p>

  <p class="letter">I wish this action may beget thankfulness and humility in
  all that are concerned in it.</p>

  <p class="letter">He that ventures his life for the liberty of his country, I
  wish he trust God for the liberty of his conscience, and you for the liberty
  he fights for.</p>

  <p class="letter">In this he rests, who is your most humble servant,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell.</span></p><br>

  <p>As he dried and sealed up his letter, the soldier, whose ears, though deaf
  to the nightingale and the lift of the wind in the trees without, were keen
  enough for all practical sounds, heard a certain tumult or commotion which
  seemed to be in the house and almost at his very door.</p>

  <p>With the instinct that the last few years had bred in him, he put his hand
  to his tuck sword and shifted it farther round his thigh, then, taking up the
  standing candlestick, he hastily crossed to the door and opened it. A little
  group of soldiers were gathered round the front entrance to the house, which
  stood wide open, and Cromwell joined them, casting the rays of his two
  candles over a scene that had hitherto been illumined only by the pale
  trembling light of the rising moon.</p>

  <p>A small, white, tired horse stood at the steps of the house, his head
  hanging down to his feet; at his bridle was a woman, a dark scarf about her
  shoulders, the slack reins in her hand, and on his back hung a man who had
  fallen forward on his neck, almost, if not quite, unconscious.</p>

  <p>The woman, with the moonlight on her face, was speaking to the soldiers in
  a tone at once imperious and desperate, and from all parts of the garden a
  mingled crowd was approaching to ascertain the cause of this supplication at
  the gate of the General's house.</p>

  <p>Cromwell stepped with authority to the front; the first flutter of the
  candlelight over the scene revealed to him that the man was desperately
  wounded and that the woman was wild with fear and anger, yet, by some fierce
  effort, keeping her composure. The look on her face reminded him of that he
  had seen on Lady Strafford's face when her coach was stopped by the mob in
  Whitehall.</p>

  <p>'What is this?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied one of the troopers, 'this is none other than one of those
  calves of Bethel who did so levant and flourish to-day.'</p>

  <p>The lady now let go the reins and stepped forward, interrupting the
  soldier, and addressing herself directly to Cromwell, whom she perceived by
  his scarf and equipments to be an officer of some rank.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' she said, with a dignity greater than her sorrow, and a pride
  stronger than her grief, 'this is my husband's brother's house.'</p>

  <p>'Thy brother hath doubtless fled with the King,' returned Cromwell, 'and
  his house is now the property of the Parliament.'</p>

  <p>'This is my husband,' said the lady; 'he was in the battalia
  to-day&mdash;and I went down to the field and found him, and one helped me
  set him on a horse and so we came here&mdash;to my brother's house.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell listened tenderly.</p>

  <p>'Alas!' he said, 'thou art over young for such scenes.'</p>

  <p>He gave the candlestick to one of the soldiers, and stepped into the
  garden.</p>

  <p>The Cavalier, who was, by a desperate effort, holding on to his senses,
  now dragged himself upright and spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Since the rebels have the house, ask them not&mdash;for charity,' he
  muttered, and then, with the attempt at speech, fainted, and dropped sideways
  out of the saddle into the arms of one of the Roundheads.</p>

  <p>At this sight the lady lost all pride, and, glancing wildly round the ring
  of steel-clad figures, she clasped her hands in a gesture of appeal.</p>

  <p>'May he not be taken into the house?' she stammered. 'Oh, good sirs, for
  pity!'</p>

  <p>'A malignant,' said the corporal who had caught the Cavalier, pointing to
  his long locks and rich dress, and one doubtless drunk with the blood of the
  saints! 'Shall I take him to the church, that plague spot of hierarchy, where
  the other children of Belial lie bound?'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' replied Cromwell, 'take up the young man and bring him into the
  house.'</p>

  <p>He looked to the lady and added&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Madam, what is your name and quality?'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' she replied, 'my lord is Sir William Pawlet, of the House of the
  Marquis of Winchester, and I am Jane, his wife.'</p>

  <p>The look of pity died from the Puritan's expressive face.</p>

  <p>'He who holdeth Basing House against us? That Winchester?' he cried
  grimly. 'Art thou, as he, Papist?'</p>

  <p>'Your tongue doth call us that,' she replied faintly.</p>

  <p>'Ha!' cried Cromwell, 'must I then succour the children of filth and
  abomination, the brood of the Scarlet Women, whose bones I have declared
  shall whiten the valley of Hinnom and whose dust I promised to cast into the
  brook of Kedar?'</p>

  <p>The lady pressed to her husband's side.</p>

  <p>'God's will be done,' she said in despair; 'even in this pass I cannot
  deny my God nor my King.'</p>

  <p>The two soldiers who had lifted the Cavalier paused with their burden,
  expecting that the General would order both Papists to a common prison.</p>

  <p>And such, indeed, was for a moment his intention, for no man was more
  hated by him than Lord Winchester, who had, since the beginning of the war,
  defied the Parliamentarians from Basing House.</p>

  <p>But as he was about to speak he glanced down at the face of the
  unconscious man, and a shudder shook him.</p>

  <p>On the young Cavalier's fair face was a dreadful look of his own son
  Oliver, who had died at Newport Pagnell, and of that nephew who had died in
  his arms after Marston Moor; and with these two memories came that of his
  first-born, Robert, dead in early youth, and the intolerable pain of that
  loss smote him afresh.</p>

  <p>'Bring the youth into the house,' he said sombrely.</p>

  <p>Lady Pawlet made no answer and gave no sign of gratitude: she followed the
  soldiers who were carrying her husband, and helped them to support his
  head.</p>

  <p>'Surely the young man is dying,' said Oliver Cromwell gloomily. 'Bring him
  into the parlour and fetch a surgeon if one may be found. And look you,
  Gaveston,' he added to the sergeant, 'see this letter is dispatched to Mr.
  Lenthall, in London.'</p>

  <p>The candles had now been replaced on the table, and the General took up
  his letter to the Speaker, but while he was addressing the soldier and
  handing him the dispatch, his frowning eyes were fixed on the Cavalier, who
  was now extended on the couch with his cloak for a pillow.</p>

  <p>Lady Pawlet, as if despairing of better accommodation, perhaps too sunk in
  grief to notice anything, went on her knees by the side of her husband, and
  knelt there as still as he, holding his hand to her breast.</p>

  <p>The black scarf had fallen back over her tumbled grey dress and soiled
  ruffles, and the red-gold of her disordered hair glittered round a face
  disfigured with fatigue and sorrow&mdash;a face that had once been fair
  enough and gay enough. They were both very young and scarcely past their
  bridal days.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell stood with his back to the table, the light behind him,
  watching them; she seemed forgetful of his presence.</p>

  <p>Sir William was bleeding in the head and the arm; these at least were his
  visible hurts, probably he had other wounds beneath his battle bravery of
  silk and bullion fringe, Spanish leather, and brocaded scarf.</p>

  <p>His wife, bending over him still and helpless, as if she, too, was
  secretly wounded and dying of it, suddenly moved.</p>

  <p>'A priest,' she whispered, 'is there not a priest? I think he
  is&mdash;dying.'</p>

  <p>'Pray that the light may come to him in the little time left,' said the
  Puritan sternly. 'And seek not to seal his eternal damnation by idolatry and
  devilry.'</p>

  <p>The lady looked up as if she had not heard what he said and did not know
  who he was.</p>

  <p>'Oh, sir,' she said, 'will you come and look at my lord?'</p>

  <p>Cromwell stepped up to the couch and gazed down at the Cavalier; his
  features were pinched, the wound at the side of the head, from which the
  blood had ceased to flow, was of a purplish colour.</p>

  <p>The General touched him on the brow, moving back the clotted curls, and
  gazed into his agonized features.</p>

  <p>'His heart&mdash;I cannot feel his heart,' cried Lady Pawlet.</p>

  <p>'He is not here,' said Cromwell. 'Even as we speak, he standeth before the
  Judgment Seat.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-05"
     id="ch2-05"></a>CHAPTER V. LIEUT.-GENERAL CROMWELL AND HIS GOD</h2>

  <p class="first">'Well, well!' stammered Lady Pawlet. 'There are some shall
  answer to God for this. Well, well!</p>

  <p>'Get to thy friends if thou hast any,' said the Puritan, 'and let them put
  thee beyond seas. There is an ordinance against Papists.'</p>

  <p>She stared at him; the body of the dead Cavalier was between them; the red
  candlelight and the white moonlight mingled grotesquely over the dead and the
  living.</p>

  <p>'Ah yes,' she said; her eyes wandered to her husband's face. 'The King
  will be sorry,' she added.</p>

  <p>'The King,' replied Cromwell, 'hath troubles of his own to mourn for. Up.
  mistress, and be going. This is no place for mourner and Papists. Tell me
  some friend's house and I will have thee conveyed thither.'</p>

  <p>Lady Pawlet made no reply, and remained kneeling by the couch which held
  her husband.</p>

  <p>Cromwell moved away abruptly; though professional insensibility and his
  hatred of the Papist checked the pity that was natural to him at any sight of
  distress, still his mystic, melancholy nature had been moved by the sight of
  the young man brought in dead. He thought he beheld in him a type of all the
  fair lives that had been ruined or lost since this war began&mdash;wasted
  men! And how many of them, one, two, or three thousand to-day, now being
  shovelled into the trenches at Broadmoor...all English like this one...all
  with some woman some where to weep for them...</p>

  <p>He turned again to the immobile woman.</p>

  <p>'Come, madam, come, come,' he began, but his speech was broken by the
  entry of a soldier with some dispatches from Fairfax, who remained at Naseby,
  and with the statement that there was no surgeon conveniently to be
  brought.</p>

  <p>'As for that,' returned Cromwell, 'the malignant is now in the hands of
  the Living God. But let that little white horse I saw be looked to. He turned
  to Lady Pawlet. 'He is mine by right of war, but I will give thee a fair
  price for him if he be thine, since we are ever in need of horses.'</p>

  <p>She made no reply; Cromwell glanced at her frowningly.</p>

  <p>'Gaveston,' he said, 'is there nought but this burnt ale in the house?
  Search for a glass of alicant for the malignant's wife, she bath neither
  strength to speak or move.'</p>

  <p>'Methinks the King did take the fleshpots with him when he fled from this
  Egypt,' returned Gaveston. 'There is Scarce enough in the village to refresh
  the outer men of the saints themselves&mdash;but I will see if I can find a
  bottle of sack or alicant, General Cromwell.'</p>

  <p>Lady Pawlet, hitherto so immovable as to appear insensible, now suddenly
  rose to her feet, and, turning so that she stood with her back to her
  husband's body, stared at the General who remained at the table, not two
  paces away from her.</p>

  <p>'Art thou Oliver Cromwell?' she cried, with a force and energy that was so
  in contrast to her former despairing apathy that the two men were startled,
  and Cromwell turned as if to face an accuser.</p>

  <p>'I am he,' he answered.</p>

  <p>'Rebel and heretic!' cried the unfortunate lady. 'May the curse of England
  rest on thee! May all the blood that has been spilt, and all the tears shed
  for those thou hast slain, cry out to the throne of God for a bolt to strike
  thee down!'</p>

  <p>'Fond creature,' replied Cromwell, 'I am in covenant with the Lord, and I
  do the Lord's work, and your blasphemies do but waste the air.'</p>

  <p>'No! I am heard!' answered Lady Pawlet, to whom horror and wrath had given
  an exalted dignity and a desperate strength. 'Man of blood and disloyalty, a
  scourge upon this land, a bitterness and a terror to these unhappy
  people!'</p>

  <p>'Shall I take her away?' asked Gaveston, advancing.</p>

  <p>Nay,' replied Cromwell, let her speak. 'Words no more than swords touch
  those who wear the armour of the Lord. As for thee, vain, unhappy one, go and
  wrestle with the evil errors that hold thee, and pray that light be given to
  thy eternal darkness.'</p>

  <p>Lady Pawlet moved aside and pointed to her husband.</p>

  <p>'He is dead,' she said. 'Only I know how good he was, how excellent and
  loyal&mdash;but he is dead in his early summer. And I, too, have lived my
  life.'</p>

  <p>'"Man is a thing of nought, he passeth away like a shadow,"' returned the
  Lieutenant-General sombrely. 'We are but a little dust that the wind bloweth
  as it will.'</p>

  <p>'A brazen face and an iron hand!' cried Lady Pawlet wildly. 'A wicked
  heart and a lying mouth! What has this unhappy England done that she cannot
  be delivered of thee?'</p>

  <p>To the surprise of Sergeant Gaveston, Cromwell neither left the room nor
  ordered the removal of the frantic lady, but answered her earnestly, even
  passionately&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Was it the Parliament first set up the standard of war? Nay, it was the
  King. Was it the Parliament that ever refused to come to an accommodation?
  Again the King. Was it the Parliament that roused the Highlands of Scotland
  to war? Nay, Montrose, the King's man. Was it the Parliament did command
  these horrid outrages in Ireland? Nay, Phelim O'Neil, the King's man.
  Therefore accuse us not of bloodshed, for we do but make a defence against
  violence and tyranny. We fight for God's people that they may have repose and
  blessing, and for this land that it may have liberty.'</p>

  <p>'Thou to talk of God's people, heretic of heretic, who hast rejected even
  thine own deluded Church!'</p>

  <p>'Ay, and the blue and brown of the Presbyter as well as the lawn sleeves
  of the Bishop,' cried Cromwell, pacing up and down in that agitation that
  often came on him when he was excited by any attack on his religious
  sincerity. 'If the prayer-book is but a mess of pottage, what is the
  preaching of the Covenanters but dry chips offered to the soul starving for
  spiritual manna? Men of all sects fight side by side in my ranks&mdash;would
  they could do so at Westminster.' He suddenly checked himself as he perceived
  that he was saying more than his place and dignity required, controlled the
  agitation that had hurried him into speech, and turned to Lady Pawlet, not
  without pity and tenderness&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Gaveston, conduct this lady to Naseby where are the other gentlewomen
  taken to-day, and give her name and quality to Sir Thomas Fairfax. Take out
  the malignant and place him with his fellows in the trenches.'</p>

  <p>At this the unhappy wife gave a shriek and hurled herself across the dead
  Cavalier, desperately clinging to his limp arms and pressing her bright head
  against his bloodied coat.</p>

  <p>'My dear, they want to put you in the ground! I went to find you&mdash;you
  were alive; what has happened now? I found you; what has happened? They shall
  not take you away. Leave me,' as Gaveston tried to move her from the body;
  'he is not dead.' She looked up and the tears were falling down her cheeks.
  'I have nothing of him&mdash;no child. Would you take him away?'</p>

  <p>'Leave them here,' said Cromwell. Since he had beheld his wife mourning
  her two eldest sons he could not bear to see a woman weep, and the young
  Cavalier had still that dreadful look of young Oliver. 'Send some woman from
  the village to her, and in the morning, when she is removed, you might bury
  him. Take my things upstairs&mdash;wait&mdash;' He broke open the packages
  and, holding them near the candlelight, looked over the contents.</p>

  <p>'Nothing I need answer to-night,' he said, and glanced again at the slim
  figure of the young woman as she clung to her dead in her agony, the bright
  unbounded hair all that was left of beauty that had been so fresh and
  lovely.</p>

  <p>'So is it with the ungodly,' he muttered sombrely. 'How suddenly do they
  perish, consume, and come to a fearful end! Even like a dream when one
  awaketh!'</p>

  <p>So saying, he turned abruptly into the garden and walked away from the
  house.</p>

  <p>The Puritan soldier passed through the garden without noticing the
  sleeping loveliness or reflecting on the desolation it soon would be; his
  mind was solely on his work, on what he had done, on what he must
  do&mdash;occupied with all the doubts and terrors of the struggle between the
  uplifted spirit and the still passionate human nature.</p>

  <p>Outwardly he never faltered or hesitated, but inwardly all was often black
  and awful; a thousand perplexities assailed his strong understanding, a
  thousand different emotions warred in his warm and ardent heart.</p>

  <p>Usually his spiritual enthusiasm went hand in hand with his physical
  courage and capacity, with his earthly feelings and hopes; but sometimes
  these jarred with each other, and then the old melancholy rolled over his
  soul.</p>

  <p>When he had walked unheeding as far as the paling and was stopped there,
  by lack of a gate, he folded his arms on the fence and gazed ahead of him
  into the sweet night.</p>

  <p>He was fatigued, yet far from the thought of sleep; the excitement of the
  battle and the pursuit, the thrill of victory was still with him...</p>

  <p>And yet...and yet...the dead face of Sir William Pawlet and the no less
  terrible countenance of his wife came before the soldier's vision...And how
  many thousands of these were there not now in England, how many homes
  deserted like this one, how many fugitives flying beyond seas, how many
  comely corpses being tumbled into the trenches dug among the rabbit burrows
  on Broadmoor? So many that the rolling hillocks would be all great graves,
  and for long years no man would be able to turn the earth there with a plough
  but he would disturb the mouldering dead.</p>

  <p>What if he had to answer for this blood? Was not he the man who had always
  urged war&mdash;been the soul and inspiration of the conflict, so that the
  malignants turned and cursed him, even as Lady Pawlet had this very evening,
  believing him to be the foremost of their enemies?</p>

  <p>Lord God,' he cried out, grasping the fence with his strong hands, 'I do
  not fight for gain or power, for pride or hot blood, but for Thy service, as
  Thou knowest! What am I but a worm in Thy sight, yet Thou hast given me
  success through Thy lovely mercy and made me a fear unto them who defy Thee!
  Hast Thou not declared that Thine enemies shall be scattered like the dust,
  and they who dwell in the wilderness kneel before Thee? Bring us that time, O
  Lord, bring Thy promised peace and scatter those who delight in war! For Thou
  hast said, "I will bring My people again as I did from Bashan, Mine own will
  I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea!"'</p>

  <p>These words, which he spoke out loudly and in a strong voice, were wafted
  strangely over the sleeping copse, where even the nightingale was silent now;
  the sound of them seemed to be blown back again and to echo in his soul
  strongly even after his lips were silent.</p>

  <p>He suddenly remembered when last he had rested against a fence; it was
  that November day outside St. Ives, when God had come to him as he walked his
  humble fields in obscurity and given him promise of grace.</p>

  <p>His whole being shook with joy at the recollection; he put his hand to the
  cross of his sword, and as he touched the cold metal he again felt God stoop
  towards him, and saw the future and the labour of the future clear and
  blessed.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-06"
     id="ch2-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE KING DREAMS</h2>

  <p class="first">The Parliamentarians followed up the victory at Naseby with
  victories at Langport, Bridgewater, Sherborne, and Bath. The King was
  desolate at Newark, relying on Rupert, who held Bristol, that famous city,
  and had promised to stand siege for four months and more, and on the Marquess
  of Montrose, who had roused the gallant Highlanders to fight for their
  ancient line of kings, who had already been triumphant in many engagements,
  and was now marching to meet General Leslie, Cromwell's comrade-in-arms at
  Marston Moor, who had crossed the Tweed to crush the Scottish royalists.</p>

  <p>It might seem that the reckless bravery of Rupert and the reckless loyalty
  of Montrose were poor props with which to support a crown; but the King,
  unpractical in everything, dreamt that these two might save him yet, though
  his cause, since first he set his standard up at Nottingham, had never looked
  so desperate.</p>

  <p>His private cabinet of papers which had been taken at Naseby had done him
  more harm than the defeat, for there were many documents, letters, and
  memoranda which proved to the victors the insincerity of his dealings with
  the Parliament, the sophistries of his arguments, the hollowness of his
  professions, and the unreliability of his word.</p>

  <p>They proved also, if the Parliamentarians had cared to make the deduction,
  that Charles, however frivolous he might be, however unstable and changing,
  however much he had temporized and given way, was on some points adamant, and
  these points were his devotion to the Church of England, to his Crown and all
  its prerogatives, his unshaken belief in his own divine right, and the sacred
  justice of his cause.</p>

  <p>Charles, indeed, had never meant to come to an honest understanding with
  Parliament, which he regarded as rebellious and traitorous. He might have
  played with it, cajoled it, lured it, deceived it; but he had never intended
  to do more. Promises had been forced from him, but he had always found some
  sophistry with which he consoled his conscience for breaking them;
  concessions might have been forced from him, but he always meant, at the
  first opportunity, to withdraw. He would, if he had had the power, have
  replaced the Star Chamber to-morrow and treated the Puritans as they had been
  treated after the Hampton Conference in his father's time.</p>

  <p>And he scarcely made a secret of the way he intended to treat the rebels
  if they were ever at his mercy. They embodied all that was hateful to him,
  and he had Strafford, Laud, and deep personal humiliations to avenge. He
  might sometimes talk of toleration, but there was none in his heart; his
  graceful exterior concealed a fanaticism as stern, as convinced, as
  unyielding as any that burnt beneath the rough leather of Cromwell's
  Independents.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of the year of Naseby, so disastrous to his cause, he was in
  the besieged city of Newark, one of the few holding out for him; he had,
  indeed, now only few cities, such as Oxford, Bristol, Exeter, and Winchester,
  besides that in which he lay.</p>

  <p>The Marquess of Newcastle, that faithful soldier and loyal subject, and
  many faithful Cavaliers and a small loyalist garrison were with him; they
  were not under any immediate fear of an attack, because Fairfax and Cromwell
  were harrying Goring and Hopton in the south, and the Parliamentary force in
  the north was occupied with Montrose.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Wales had followed his mother to the Hague and then to
  Paris; the other sons, the Dukes of York and Gloucester, remained in St.
  James's Palace, together with the younger children. This safety of his wife
  and his heir gave the King a certain comfort and ease in his mind, and the
  long, idle autumn days did not pass unpleasantly in the beleaguered city for
  one whose delight was in dreams and repose and a retired leisure.</p>

  <p>His soul was indeed sunk in melancholy, but it was a gentle sadness; and
  the quiet of the moment, the sunny days in the old castle and garden did not
  fail to touch with peace a soul so sensitive to surroundings.</p>

  <p>He told Lord Digby, my Lord of Bristol's son (that nobleman having fled to
  Paris), that if he could not live like a king he could always die like a
  gentleman; no one, not the most insulting, crop-eared ruffian of them all,
  could take that privilege from him. So, too, he wrote to the Queen in reply
  to her letters, which always advised uncompromising courses and exhorted him
  not to give way on any single point in reality, though she said it might be
  well to yield in appearance.</p>

  <p>Charles needed no such advice; he was calmly and patiently resolved to go
  to ruin on the question of Episcopacy and his divine right rather than yield
  a tittle, and this was not any the less true that few believed it of him.
  Almost the entire country, including the Parliamentary leaders, thought that
  now the King was cornered he would make terms; their only concern was to find
  guarantees to make him keep these terms when made.</p>

  <p>To some, in whom he put perfect trust, the King revealed his mind. Thus he
  had written to Rupert at Bristol&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Speaking as a mere soldier or statesman, I must say that
  there is no probability but of my ruin.</p>

  <p class="letter">But, speaking as a Christian, I must tell you that God will
  not suffer rebels and traitors to prosper or this cause to be overthrown. And
  whatever personal punishment it shall please Him to inflict on me must not
  make me repine, much less give over this quarrel.</p>

  <p class="letter">Indeed, I cannot flatter myself with expectations of good
  success more than this, to end my days with honour and a good conscience,
  which obliges me to continue my endeavours, as not despairing that God may in
  due time avenge His own cause.</p>

  <p class="letter">Though I must avow to all my friends&mdash;that he who will
  stay with me at this time must expect and resolve either to die for a good
  cause or (which is worse) to live as miserable in maintaining it as the
  violence of insulting rebels can make it.</p><br>

  <p>As for the King's future plans, they were vague, uncertain, and waited on
  events. Every General in arms for him&mdash;Rupert, Goring, Hapton,
  Montrose&mdash;fought on their own, with no other guidance than what their
  talents and circumstances might give them, and Charles might either join the
  one of them who was most successful or return to Oxford, which had been for
  nearly three years his headquarters. He was not without hopes that the
  energies of the Queen might land another army in England, either Frenchmen
  supplied by her brother or Dutchmen sent by his son-in-law, the Prince of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>He had some encouragement, too, to believe that the Scots, who disliked
  Independency almost as much as Prelacy, might yet be detached from their
  alliance with the Parliament. It was known that they did not love Cromwell
  nor he them, and the more that he gained in importance the more their ardour
  for the cause he represented cooled. It was said that they had even viewed
  the defeat of the malignants at Naseby with a cold and dubious eye, as they
  considered the discomfiture of the royalists quite balanced by the triumph of
  the Sectarists, Schismists, and Anabaptists who composed Cromwell's
  Ironsides.</p>

  <p>Charles, therefore, nourished some fantastic hope that by deluding the
  Scots into thinking he would take the Covenant that was their shibboleth, he
  might altogether detach them from his enemies. It was a subtle and difficult
  piece of policy, and could only be accomplished by those intrigues which had
  so often damaged the King before; but Charles dallied with the idea, while he
  waited for the news of a victory from Montrose which would put Scotland in a
  more submissive attitude.</p>

  <p>The middle of September came, and there was no message from the Marquess.
  Charles soothed himself with memories of the Graeme's victories at Aberdeen,
  Perth, Inverlochy, and Kilsyth, and whiled away the time with reading,
  meditation, and the elegant companionship of the cultured and poetical
  Newcastle and the fantastical and brilliant Digby.</p>

  <p>These two were with the King in the garden of the house, or castle, where
  he lodged in the afternoon of one lovely day when the sun sent a bloom of
  gold over the majestic scenery and glittered in the stately windings of the
  Trent.</p>

  <p>The talk fell on the Marquess of Winchester, who had so long held Basing
  against the Parliament that the Cavaliers had come to call it Loyalty House
  and the Puritans to curse it as a cesspool of Satan or outpost of hell.</p>

  <p>'I would that my noble lord was here,' said Charles, with feeling.</p>

  <p>'He doth better service to Your Majesty,' returned Lord George Digby, 'in
  defying the rebels from Basing House.'</p>

  <p>'But how long can he defy them?' asked the King. 'Can a mere mansion
  withstand the onslaughts of an army? Nay,' he added, in a melancholy tone,
  stooping to pat the white boarhound which walked beside him, 'my Lord
  Winchester will be ruined like all my friends, and Loyalty House will be but
  burnt walls blackened beneath the skies, even as so many others which have
  been besieged and beleaguered by the rebels.'</p>

  <p>'Speak words of good omen, sir,' said Newcastle, who had himself staked
  (and lost, it seemed) the whole of a princely fortune on the royal cause.
  'Methought that to-day you did have a more cheerful spirit and a more
  uplifted heart.'</p>

  <p>'Alas!' replied Charles. 'I hope on this, on that, I trust in God, I
  believe that my own fate is in my own hands, and that I can make it dignified
  or mean as I will; but when I consider those who are ruined for me, then, I
  do confess, I have no strength but to weep and no desire but to mourn.'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' said the Marquess, much moved, 'Your Majesty's misfortunes but
  endear you the more to us; and as for any inconveniences or losses we may
  have suffered, what are they compared to the joy of being of even a little
  service to your sacred cause? Sir, the rebels may wax strong and successful,
  but believe me there are still thousands of gentlemen in England who would
  gladly lay down their lives for you.'</p>

  <p>'I do believe it, Newcastle,' answered the King affectionately, 'and
  therefore I am sad that I must see those suffer whom I would protect and
  reward.'</p>

  <p>They had now, in their leisurely walking, reached a portion of the garden
  laid out on some of the old disused fortifications of the castle, and looking
  towards the town.</p>

  <p>The castle, which stood as an outpost to the town, was grimly fortified at
  the base, and the walls of Newark held cannon and soldiery; but none of this
  was visible to the three on the old ramparts. The scene was one of perfect
  peace, of that peculiar rich and tender beauty which seems only possible to
  England, and which not even civil war had here been able to destroy.</p>

  <p>The King seated himself on a bench which stood against one of the
  buttresses of the castle, the white dog gravely placed himself at his feet,
  while the two Cavaliers remained standing. The three figures, aristocratic,
  finely dressed, at once graceful and careless, well fitted the scene.</p>

  <p>The King, though worn and haggard, was still a person eminently pleasing
  to the eye; the Marquess, a little past the meridian of life, was yet notable
  for his splendid presence; and Lord Digby, at once a philosopher and a
  courtier, set out a handsome appearance with rich clothes, both gorgeous and
  tasteful.</p>

  <p>Charles, after being sunk for some minutes in contemplation of the
  prospect below him, turned to Newcastle with a smile both tender and
  whimsical.</p>

  <p>'The Queen writes me, my lord,' he said, 'that there is a certain
  gentlewoman with her in Paris who often discourseth of your excellencies.
  Have you any knowledge of whom this lady can be?'</p>

  <p>The Marquess flushed at this unexpected allusion, and his right hand
  played nervously at his embroidered sword band.</p>

  <p>'I only know one lady in Her Majesty's service,' he smiled, 'and she is
  scarce like to flatter me or any man, being most cold, most shy. Sir, it is
  Margaret Lucas, and I met her when she was attending the Queen at
  Oxford.'</p>

  <p>'It is Margaret Lucas that I speak of,' replied Charles. 'Dear Marquess, I
  think her a very noble lady. Will you not write to her in Paris and console
  her exile?'</p>

  <p>The Marquess answered with a firm sadness&mdash;</p>

  <p>'If Mrs. Lucas would accept of me I would take her for my wife. But these
  are not the times to think of such toys as courtships.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, my lord,' said Charles earnestly, 'a true and loyal love shall
  console thee in any times. What adversity is there a faithful woman cannot
  soften? Whatever be before thee, take whilst thou may, this gentlewoman's
  love&mdash;thy sacrifices would not so vex my soul if I could see thee with a
  gentle wife.'</p>

  <p>He sighed as he finished, his thoughts perhaps turning to the one deep
  passion of his own life&mdash;the Queen&mdash;now so far away and so divided
  from him by dangers and difficulties. When would he again behold her in her
  rich chamber singing at her spinet, with roses at her bosom, and her dark
  eyes flashing with love and joy? When again would he behold her among her
  court at Whitehall, honoured and obeyed? When again take her hand and look
  into her dear, dear face?...Were these days indeed over for ever, to be
  numbered now with dead things?...</p>

  <p>He rose with a sharp exclamation under his breath; these reflections were
  indeed intolerable.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' he said impatiently, 'this dearth of news is bitter to the spirit. I
  sometimes think it would be well to gather my faithful remnant round me and
  make a sortie into Scotland to join my Lord Montrose.'</p>

  <p>This was quite to the taste of the two noblemen, who were also tired of
  Newark, and Lord Digby, for whom no scheme was too fantastic, began to
  discourse on the advantages of the King's sudden appearance in the
  Highlands.</p>

  <p>But the mood of Charles quickly changed; his resignation and melancholy
  returned.</p>

  <p>'Nay,' he said, 'I must better the Scots by wits, not force. What would it
  avail to fall into the hands of the cunning Argyll and his Covenanters, and
  give the squinting Campbell the pleasure of making us prisoner?'</p>

  <p>The Cavaliers were silent, and the three began to slowly continue their
  walk round the old ramparts.</p>

  <p>'Methinks this might be the garden of the Hesperides,' said Newcastle
  presently. 'See how bright the gilded light faileth, how gently move the
  dappled deer, and how softly all the little leaves quiver. And all the young
  clouds that come abroad are soft as a lady's veil.'</p>

  <p>'It were good to die in such a place, at such an hour, if God gave us any
  choice,' said Charles. 'For one could think, in such a moment, that it was
  well to leave all sordid things and let the soul leap into the sunset sky as
  gladly as the body leapeth in cool water on a dusty day. But we must live and
  endure bloody times&mdash;and may the angels give us constancy!'</p>

  <p>As he spoke he idly turned and saw, coming towards him, one of the
  gentlemen of his bedchamber.</p>

  <p>He stood still.</p>

  <p>'This is some news,' he said. 'Go forward, my lord,'&mdash;touching Lord
  Digby on the arm&mdash;'and ask.'</p>

  <p>He had become notably pale, and he looked down at the roses on his shoes
  and put his hand to his side as the two gentlemen came up to him.</p>

  <p>Momentous news had arrived at last; one of Rupert's troopers had brought a
  dispatch from that Prince, and within a few minutes of him had come a Captain
  of some Irish who had been with Montrose.</p>

  <p>He brought no dispatch; he had made his way with danger, difficulty, and
  great delay from Scotland. His news was put in a few words, but they were
  words which Lord Digby could scarcely stammer to the pale King.</p>

  <p>'There is news come, sir&mdash;that David Leslie&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'A battle,' asked Charles, swiftly looking up. 'There hath been a
  battle?'</p>

  <p>'Alas! Your Majesty must speak with this Captain of Irish yourself,' said
  the gentleman, in dismay. 'He saith Leslie fell on the noble Marquess near
  Selkirk, and did utterly defeat and overwhelm him; it was at Philiphaugh,
  sir&mdash;and all the Scottish clans were broken and the Marquess is
  fled.'</p>

  <p>Newcastle gave an exclamation of bitter grief and rage. Charles stood
  silent a full minute, then said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The Marquess is not taken?'</p>

  <p>'Not that this Captain knoweth&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Then we have some mercy,' said the King, with a proud tenderness
  infinitely winning. 'My dear lord, what bitterness is thine to-day! Alas!
  Alas!'</p>

  <p>Digby, with tears in his eyes, took the dispatch and gave it to the King,
  hoping that it might contain news that would soften the bitterness of
  Montrose's overthrow.</p>

  <p>But for a while the King, struggling with his stinging disappointment and
  mortification, could not read, and when he did break the seals it was with a
  distracted air.</p>

  <p>The very heading of the paper brought the hot blood to his pallid cheeks;
  it was not 'Bristol,' but 'Oxford.'</p>

  <p>The Prince wrote laconically to say he had surrendered Bristol to Fairfax
  and Cromwell, and had gone under parliamentary convoy to Oxford.</p>

  <p>When the King had read the letter he stared round upon his gentlemen.</p>

  <p>'Is this my sister's son,' he cried, with quivering lips, 'or a hireling
  Captain? Was this my own blood did this thing? Rupert whom I trusted?'</p>

  <p>None of them dare speak. Charles was so white that they feared that he
  would fall in a fit or swoon.</p>

  <p>'My city, my loyal city!' he muttered; then he cast the Prince's letter on
  to the grass, as if it soiled his fingers, and turned slowly away. He had the
  look of a broken man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-07"
     id="ch2-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. LOYALTY HOUSE</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after Bristol surrendered, Winchester, that other loyal
  city, fell. Leicester, so lately taken from the Parliament, was by them
  recaptured soon after Naseby. Nearly twenty fortified houses had been taken
  this year. Goring's troopers were dispersed. Rupert and his brother had, in
  spite of all denials, followed the King to Newark; Rupert in high disgrace,
  deprived of his commissions, and ordered abroad, yet staying and endeavouring
  to justify himself to his outraged kinsman, succeeding somewhat, yet still in
  the unhappy King's deep displeasure, and hardly any longer to be considered
  as His Majesty's Commander of Horse, whether or no he held a commission,
  since His Majesty had no longer an army for any one to general.</p>

  <p>In Scotland Montrose had fled to the Orkneys. Argyll and the Conventiclers
  were triumphant and biding their chance to make a bargain either with King or
  Independents, according as circumstances might shape themselves, or as either
  party might be ready to take the Covenant.</p>

  <p>What, indeed, could the King hope for now but for some division among his
  enemies, or that the shadowy army of Dutch, Lorrainers, or Frenchmen should
  at last materialize and descend upon the coasts of Britain.</p>

  <p>Ireland, in a welter of bloody confusion, was a broken reed to lean on.
  Ormonde, working loyally there, had too many odds against him, and was no
  more to be relied on than Montrose, who had paid a bitter price for his
  loyalty and his gallant daring.</p>

  <p>It was in the October of this year which had meant such bitter ruin to the
  King's party that the Lieutenant-General of the parliamentary army, returning
  from the capture of Winchester, set his face towards Hampshire, where, at
  Basingstoke, stood Basing House, the mansion of the King's friend, the
  Marquess of Winchester, which had stood siege for four years, and was a
  standing defiance and menace to the Parliamentarians and a great hindrance to
  the trade of London with the West, for the Cavaliers would make sorties on
  all who came or went and capture all provisions which were taken past.</p>

  <p>Cromwell had at first intended to storm Dennington Castle at Newbury,
  another fortified residence which had long annoyed the Puritans; but Fairfax
  decided otherwise, believing that nothing could so hearten and encourage the
  Parliament as the capture of that redoubtable stronghold, Basing House.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Cromwell, gathering together all the available artillery,
  turned in good earnest towards Basing, from whence so many had fallen back
  discomfited.</p>

  <p>'But now the Lord is with us,' said General Cromwell. We have smitten the
  Amalekite at Bristol and Winchester, and shall he continue to defy us at
  Basing? Rather shall they and theirs be offered up as a sweet-smelling
  sacrifice to the Lord.'</p>

  <p>It was in the middle of the night of 13th October that the
  Parliamentarians surrounded Basing House.</p>

  <p>Then, while the batteries were being placed and Dalbier, the Dutchman from
  whom Cromwell had first learnt the rudiments of the art of war, Colonel
  Pickering, Sir Hardress Waller, and Colonel Montague were taking up their
  positions, the Lieutenant-General, who had already been in prayer for much of
  the night, gave out to his brigade that he rested on the 115th Psalm,
  considering that those they were about to fight were of the Old Serpent
  brood, to be fallen upon and slain even as Cosbi and Timri were slain by
  Phineas&mdash;to be put to the sword even as Samuel put Agag to the
  sword.</p>

  <p>All night the great lordly House, which had so long stood unscathed, had
  been silent among its courts, lights showing at the windows and above the
  Stewart standard floating lazily in the night breeze. There were two
  buildings&mdash;the Old House, which had stood, the seat of the Romanist
  Pawlets, for three hundred years, a fine and splendid mansion, turreted and
  towered after the manner of the Middle Ages, and before that the New House,
  built by later descendants of this magnificent family in the modern style of
  princely show and comfort, both surrounded by fortifications and works, a
  mile in circumference, and well armed with pieces of cannon.</p>

  <p>As the sun strengthened above the autumn landscape, the steel of morion
  and breastplate could be discerned on the ramparts and the colour of an
  officer's cloak as he went from post to post giving orders; these were the
  only signs that the besieged were aware of the great number and near approach
  of the Parliamentarians.</p>

  <p>Soon after six, the dawn light now being steady, and the attacking parties
  being set in order&mdash;Dalbier near the Grange, next him Sir Hardress
  Waller and Montague, and on his left Colonel Pickering&mdash;the agreed-upon
  signal, the firing of four of the cannon, being given, the Lieutenant-General
  and his regiments stormed Basing House.</p>

  <p>A quick fire was instantly returned, and the steel morions and coloured
  cloaks might be seen hastening hither and thither upon the walls and works,
  and a certain shout of defiance arose from them (it was known that they made
  a boast of having so often foiled the rebels as they termed them, and that
  they believed this bit of ground would defy them even when great cities
  fell), which the Puritans replied to not at all, but directed a full and
  incessant fire, as much as two hundred shots at a time at a given point in
  the wall, which, unable to withstand so fierce an attack, fell in, and
  allowed Sir Hardress Waller to lead his men through the breach and right on
  the great culverins of the Cavaliers, which were set about their court guard.
  They, however, with extraordinary courage and resolution, beat back the
  invader and recovered their cannon; but, Colonel Montague, coming up, they
  were overpowered again by sheer numbers, and the Puritans flowed across the
  works to the New House, bringing with them their scaling ladders. There was
  another bitter and desperate struggle, the Cavaliers sallying out and only
  yielding the bloodstained ground inch by inch as they were driven back by the
  point of the pike on the nozzle of the musket.</p>

  <p>Dalbier and Cromwell in person had now stormed at another point; the air
  was horrid with fire-balls, the whiz of bullets, the rank smoke of the
  cannon, the shrieks and cries that began to issue from the New House at the
  very walls of which the fight was now expending its force, like waves of the
  sea dashed against a great rock.</p>

  <p>Not once, nor twice, but again and again did the stout-hearted defenders,
  in all their pomp of velvet and silk, plume and steel, repulse their foes;
  again and again the colours of my Lord Marquess, bearing his own motto,
  '<i>Aymer loyaulte</i>,' and a Latin one taken from King Charles' coronation
  money, '<i>Donec pax redeat terris</i>,' surged forth into the thickest of
  the combat, were borne back, and then struggled forward, tattered and stained
  with smoke.</p>

  <p>But the hour of Loyalty House had come; the proud and dauntless Cavalier,
  whose loyalty had endured foul as well as fair weather, had now come to the
  end of his resistance to his master's enemies.</p>

  <p>Nothing human could long withstand the rush forward of the Ironsides.</p>

  <p>Colonel Pickering passed through the New House and got to the very gate of
  the Old House.</p>

  <p>Seeing his defences so utterly broken down and his first rampart and
  mansion gone, the desperate Marquess was wishful to summon a parley, and sent
  an officer to wave a white cravat from one of the turrets with that
  purpose.</p>

  <p>But the Puritans would listen to no parley.</p>

  <p>'No dealings with this nest of Popery!' cried Colonel Pickering, whose
  zeal was further inflamed by the sight of a popish priest who was admonishing
  and encouraging the besieged.</p>

  <p>After this the Cavaliers fell to it again with the sword, keeping up an
  incredible resistance, and all the works and the courtyards, the fair
  gardens, walks, orchards, and enclosed lands, the pleasances and alleys laid
  out by my lord with great taste after the French model were one bloody waste
  of destruction; sword smiting sword, gun replying to gun, men pressing
  forward, being borne back, calling on their God, sinking to their death,
  trampled under foot; the air all murky with smoke, the lovely garden torn up
  and in part burning from fire-balls, the wall of the noble House pierced by
  cannon-shot, the shrieks of women and the curses of men uprising, the colours
  of my lord ever bravely aloft until he who held them sank down in the press
  with a sigh, while his life ran out from many wounds, and the banner of
  loyalty was snatched by a trooper of Pickering's and flaunted in triumph
  above the advancing Parliamentarians.</p>

  <p>At this sight a deep moan burst from the House and dolorous cries issued
  from every window, as if the great mansion was alive and lamented its fate
  pressing so near.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-General Cromwell was now at the very gates of the inner house,
  and these were, without much ado, burst open. The Cavaliers, pressed upon by
  multitudes and broken at the sword's point, fell back, mostly dying men, in
  the great hall; and on the great staircase were some, notably my Lord
  Marquess himself, who still made a hot resistance, as men who had nothing but
  death before them and meant to spend the little while left them in
  action.</p>

  <p>From the upper floors might be heard the running to and fro of women and
  servants, the calling of directions, and the gasping of prayers, while from
  without the cannon still rattled and smoke and fire belched through the
  broken walls.</p>

  <p>At last, my lord being driven up into his own chambers, and those about
  him slain, Major Harrison sprang to the first landing and called upon all to
  surrender; upon which eight or nine gentlewomen, wives of the officers, came
  running forth together and were made prisoners.</p>

  <p>Major Harrison pushed into the nearest chamber, which was most
  magnificently hung with tapestries and furnished in oak and Spanish
  leather&mdash;a great spacious room with candlesticks of gold and lamps of
  crystal, brocaded cushions, and Eastern carpets&mdash;and there stood three
  people, one Major Cuffe, a notable Papist, one Robinson, a player of my
  lord's, and a gentlewoman, the daughter of Doctor Griffiths, who was in
  attendance on the garrison.</p>

  <p>These three stood together warily, watching the door, and when the godly
  Harrison and his troopers burst in they drew a little together, the soldier
  before the others. Harrison called on him curtly to surrender, and named him
  popish dog, at which the Cavalier came at him with a tuck sword that was
  broken in the blade, and with this poor weapon defended those who were
  weaponless.</p>

  <p>But Harrison gave him sundry sore cuts that disarmed him, and, his blood
  running out on the waxed floor, he slipped in it and so fell, and was slain
  by Harrison's own sword through the point of his cuirass at the armpit.</p>

  <p>Thereupon they called on the play-actor and the lady to surrender. She
  made no reply at all, but stared at the haggled corpse of Major Cuffe,
  twisting her hands in her flowered laycock apron.</p>

  <p>And the player put a chair in front of him and turned a mocking eye upon
  the Puritans.</p>

  <p>'I have had my jest of you many a time,' he said, 'and if I had lived I
  had jested still&mdash;but I choose rather to die with those who maintained
  me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Here Harrison interrupted.</p>

  <p>'This is no gentleman, but a lewd follow of Drury Lane.' He was dragged
  from behind the chair.</p>

  <p>'I have been in many a comedy,' he cried, 'but now I play my own
  tragedy!'</p>

  <p>Him they dispatched with a double-edged sword, and cast him down; he fell
  without a groan, yet strangely murmured, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>Major Harrison, with his bloody weapon in his hand, swept across the
  chamber through the farther entrance into the next, and his soldiers after
  him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Griffiths now woke from her stupor of dismay and rushed from one body
  to another as they lay yet warm at her feet.</p>

  <p>And when she found that they who had lately been speaking to her were
  hideously dead, and her hands all blooded with the touching of them, she
  turned and cursed the soldiery in her agony.</p>

  <p>'Silence! thou railing woman!' one of them cried. She seized one of the
  empty pistols from the window-seat and struck at the man.</p>

  <p>'God's Mother avenge us!' she shrieked.</p>

  <p>The fellow, still in the heat of slaughter, hurled her down. 'Spawn of the
  scarlet woman!' he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She got up to her knees, her head-dress fallen and her face deformed.</p>

  <p>'Thrice damned heretic!' she said. 'Thou shalt be thrust into the deepest
  pit&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Stop her mouth!' cried another, coming up; he gave her an ugly name, and
  hit her with his arquebus.</p>

  <p>She fell down again, but continued her reproaches and railing, till they
  made an end, one firing a pistol at her at close range, the ball thereof
  mercifully killing her, so that she lay prone with her two companions.</p>

  <p>After this the soldiers joined Major Harrison, whom they found with
  Lieutenant-General Cromwell at the end of this noble suite of apartments,
  having there at last brought to bay the indomitable lord of this famous and
  wealthy mansion, the puissant prince, John Pawlet, Marquess of
  Winchester.</p>

  <p>The place where this gentleman faced his enemies was the chapel of his
  faith, pompous and glorious with every circumstance of art and wealth.</p>

  <p>In front of the altar lay a dead priest; the violet glow from the east
  window stained his old shrunken features, and beside him on the topmost step
  stood the Marquess; above the altar and the Virgin hung a beautiful picture
  brought from Italy at great expense by my lord, and showing a saint singing
  between some others&mdash;all most richly done; and this and the statue was
  the background for my lord.</p>

  <p>He had his sword in his hand&mdash;a French rapier&mdash;waterwaved in
  gold&mdash;and he wore a buff coat embroidered in silk and silver, and
  Spanish breeches with a fringe, and soft boots, but no manner of armour. He
  was bareheaded; his hair, carefully trained into curls after the manner of
  the Court, framed a face white as a wall; one lock fell, in the fashion so
  abhorred by the Puritans, longer than the rest over his breast, and was tied
  with a small gold ribbon.</p>

  <p>'Truly,' said Major Harrison exultingly, 'the Lord of Israel hath given
  strength and power to His people! "As for the transgressors, they shall
  perish together; and the end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at
  the last!"'</p>

  <p>Then Lieutenant Cromwell demanded my lord's sword.</p>

  <p>'The King did give me this blade, and to him alone will I return it,'
  replied the Marquess.</p>

  <p>'Proud man!' cried Cromwell. 'Dost thou still vaunt thyself when God hath
  delivered thee, by His great mercy, into our hands?'</p>

  <p>He turned to the soldiers.</p>

  <p>'Take this malignant prisoner and cast down these idolatrous shows and
  images&mdash;for what told I ye this morning? "<i>They that make them are
  like unto them, so is every one who trusteth in them</i>"&mdash;the which
  saying is now accomplished.'</p>

  <p>When the Marquess saw the soldiers advancing upon him, he broke his light,
  small sword across his knee and cast it down beside the dead priest.</p>

  <p>'Though my faith and my sword lie low,' he said, 'yet in a better day they
  will arise.'</p>

  <p>'Cherish not vain hopes, Papist,' cried Harrison, 'but recant thine errors
  that have led thee to this disaster.'</p>

  <p>At this, Mr. Hugh Peters, the teacher, who had newly entered the chapel,
  spoke.</p>

  <p>'Dost thou still so flourish? When the Lord hath been pleased in a few
  hours to show thee what mortal seed earthly glory groweth upon?&mdash;and how
  He, taking sinners in their own snares, lifteth up the heads of His despised
  people?'</p>

  <p>The Marquess turned his back on Mr. Peters, and when the soldiers took
  hold of him and led him before the Lieutenant-General, he came unresisting,
  but in a silence more bitter than speech.</p>

  <p>Cromwell spoke to him with a courtesy which seemed gentleness compared to
  the harshness of the others.</p>

  <p>'My lord,' he said, 'for your obstinate adherence to a mistaken cause I
  must send you to London, a prisoner to the Parliament. God soften your heart
  and teach you the great peril your soul doth stand in.'</p>

  <p>Lord Winchester smiled at him in utter disdain, and turned his head away,
  still silent.</p>

  <p>Now Colonel Pickering came in and told Cromwell that above three hundred
  prisoners had been taken, and that Basing was wholly theirs, including the
  Grange or farm, where they had found sufficient provisions to last for a year
  or more and great store of ammunition and guns.</p>

  <p>'The Lord grant,' said the Lieutenant-General, 'that these mercies be
  acknowledged with exceeding thankfulness.'</p>

  <p>And thereupon he gave orders for the chapel to be destroyed.</p>

  <p>'And I will see it utterly slighted and cast down,' he said, 'even as
  Moses saw the golden calf cast down and broken.'</p>

  <p>The soldiers needed little encouragement, being already inflamed with zeal
  and the sight of the exceeding rich plunder, for never, since the war began,
  had they made booty of a place as splendid as Basing.</p>

  <p>Major Harrison with his musket hurled over the image of the Virgin on the
  altar, and his followers made spoil of the golden vessels, the embroidered
  copes, stoles, and cloths, the cushions and carpets.</p>

  <p>The altar-painting was ripped from end to end by a halbert, slashed
  across, and torn till it hung in a few ribbons of canvas; the gorgeous glass
  in the windows was smashed, the leading, as the only thing of value, dragged
  away, the marble carvings were chipped and broken, the mosaic walls defaced
  by blows from muskets and pikes.</p>

  <p>After five minutes of this fury the chapel was a hideous havoc, and the
  Marquess could not restrain a passionate exclamation.</p>

  <p>Cromwell turned to him.</p>

  <p>'We destroy wood and stone and the articles of a licentious worship,' he
  said, 'but you have destroyed flesh and blood. To-day you shall see many
  popish books burnt&mdash;but at Smithfield it was human bodies.'</p>

  <p>The Marquess made no reply, nor would he look at the speaker, and they led
  him away through his desolated house.</p>

  <p>Wild scenes of plunder were now taking place; clothes, hangings, plate,
  jewels were seized upon, the iron was being wrenched from the windows, the
  lead from the roof; what the soldiers could not remove they destroyed; one
  wing of the house was alight with fierce fire, and into these flames was
  flung all that savoured of Popery; from the Grange, wheat, bacon, cheese,
  beef, pork, and oatmeal were being carried away in huge quantities; amid all
  the din and confusion came the cries for quarter of some of the baser sort
  who had taken refuge in the cellars, and divers groans from those of the
  wounded who lay unnoticed under fallen rubbish and in obscure corners.</p>

  <p>Cromwell gave orders to stop the fire as much as might be, for, he said,
  these chairs, stools, and this household stuff will sell for a good
  price.</p>

  <p>The pay of his soldiers was greatly in arrears, and he was glad to have
  this pillage to give them.</p>

  <p>'It will be,' he remarked, 'a good encouragement&mdash;for the labourer is
  worthy of his hire, and who goeth to warfare at his own cost?'</p>

  <p>He and his officers, together with the Marquess and several other
  prisoners, now came (in the course of their leaving of the House) on the
  bedchamber of my lord, which caused the Puritans to gape with amaze, so rich
  beyond imaginings was this room, especially the bed, with great coverings of
  embroidered silk and velvet and a mighty canopy bearing my lord's arms, all
  sparkling with bullion as was the tapestry on the walls.</p>

  <p>Some soldiers were busy here, plundering my lord's clothes, and others
  were fighting over bags of silver, and the crown-pieces were scattered all
  over the silk rugs.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Peters, who had been arguing with my lord on his sinful
  idolatrous ways, pressed home his advantage and pointed to the disaster about
  him and asked the Marquess if he did not plainly see the hand of God was
  against him?</p>

  <p>Lord Winchester, who had hitherto been silent, now broke out.</p>

  <p>'If the King had had no more ground in England than Basing House, I would
  have adventured as I did and maintained it to the uttermost!'</p>

  <p>'Art so stubborn,' cried Mr. Peters, 'when all is taken from thee?'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' said the Marquess, 'Loyalty House this was called, and in that I
  take comfort, hoping His Majesty may have his day again. As for me, I have
  done what I could; and though this hour be as death, yet I would sooner be as
  I am than as thou art!'</p>

  <p>And he said this with such sharp scorn and with an air so princely (as
  became his noble breeding) that Hugh Peters was for awhile silenced.</p>

  <p>But Oliver Cromwell said, 'Thou must say thy say at Westminster.'</p>

  <p>And so fell Basing in full pride.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-08"
     id="ch2-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE KING'S FOLLY</h2>

  <p class="first">Lieutenant-General Cromwell lay encamped outside Oxford;
  Chester had lately fallen, and Gloucester, and when the Parliamentarians took
  Oxford, as they must certainly soon take it, the King would have not a foot
  of ground left in England.</p>

  <p>The King was in Oxford; he had gone from Newark to Wales, he had wandered
  awhile with such scattered forces as were left him with Rupert and Maurice,
  and then he had returned once more to the faithful, loyal city that might
  continue to be both faithful and loyal, but could not much longer resist the
  enemy that was ever pressing closer round her grey walls.</p>

  <p>It was April. 'We must end the war this year,' Cromwell said. The people
  expected a peace and a settlement from the Parliament; the only question now
  in the minds of the leaders was, what peace and settlement would the King
  make, and keep, now he was fairly beaten?</p>

  <p>This question was foremost night and day in the mind of General
  Cromwell.</p>

  <p>This day, towards the end of April, he sat in his tent outside the
  beleaguered city, smoking a pipeful of Virginian tobacco and gazing out at
  the spring landscape and the near encampment of the Parliamentarian army,
  which was illumined by the dubious light of a misty moon.</p>

  <p>Two companions were with him&mdash;Henry Ireton, who was to wed Bridget
  Cromwell at the conclusion of the war, and Major Harrison, a soldier not so
  entirely to the Lieutenant-General's liking as his prospective son-in-law,
  still, a deeply religious man and dauntless soldier, if too strongly tinged
  with that fanaticism which was now the mainspring of the new model army.</p>

  <p>A discussion which involved some difference of opinion was taking place
  between the three Puritans; Cromwell, who was one against two, was much more
  silent than his wont, for it was usual for him to speak at great length, with
  many illustrations of his meaning (which served, however, as much for
  confusing his purpose as for enlightening it, and had already got him the
  name of dissembler among his opponents) and great fervour and enthusiasm; he
  could never be called taciturn, but tonight he was silent with a kind of
  dumbness as if one of his melancholies were on him, whereas Harrison and
  Ireton expounded their case with much rigour and eloquence.</p>

  <p>And their case was that the King was utterly and entirely not to be
  trusted, and that any pact or bargain made with him would be a useless thing,
  not worth the sheepskin it was written upon.</p>

  <p>'As witness,' said Major Harrison, 'his solemn protestation to the Commons
  that he loved them as his own children, and a few days after his coming down
  to the House and claiming the five&mdash;as witness his promises and false
  oaths to Parliament which his papers taken at Naseby did show he never meant
  to keep, but was the while trying to bring over Lorrainers to cut our
  throats&mdash;and what of this last business in Ireland when he sent Lord
  Glamorgan over to stir up the Irish Papists, and then, when the scheme was
  discovered, forsook my lord and utterly denied him and the Papists too?'</p>

  <p>'As he forsook Strafford,' added Ireton. 'That deed alone would have
  spoilt the credit of a private man, and to my thinking spoils the credit of a
  king too.'</p>

  <p>'He tried to save him,' said Cromwell briefly.</p>

  <p>'Nay, his lady, being Sir Denzil Holles' sister, was the one who made the
  effort for the reprieve, as I know from Sir Denzil,' replied Ireton; 'the
  King shook him off like an old cloak, as he would shake off any friend he
  thought was likely to be hurtful to him.'</p>

  <p>Harrison took up the theme with the greater vehemence of his low origin
  and coarse training, for though his noble appearance and military
  appointments gave him some of the appearance of that equality with his
  fellow-officers which he claimed by reason of his military rank, still, when
  he spoke, it was obvious that neither the levelling of war nor religion could
  do away with the distinctions of birth and education; Cromwell and Ireton
  were as clearly gentlemen as Harrison, the son of a butcher, was clearly
  not.</p>

  <p>'What is dealing with the King but trafficking with Egypt,' he concluded
  his peroration, 'and setting up a covenant with the powers of darkness? Can
  good come from tinkling with such as Charles Stewart? Nay, rather a curse
  upon the land.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell took the pipe out of his mouth; he sat near the entrance
  to the tent, and the feeble moonlight was full over his rugged profile.</p>

  <p>The one oil-lamp had burnt out, and the three soldiers either had not
  noticed, or were indifferent to the fact, that they were sitting in the
  half-dark.</p>

  <p>'Shallow and frivolous he may be, nay, hath been proved to be,' said
  Cromwell slowly. 'But he is the King. Major Harrison, those words are as a
  tower of strength, as a wand of enchantment&mdash;there is the weight of
  seven hundred years or more to support them&mdash;and Charles, without one
  soldier, means more to England than you or I could ever mean were we backed
  by millions.'</p>

  <p>'During those seven hundred years you speak of,' replied Harrison grimly,
  'there have been kings so detestable that means have been found to put them
  off their thrones. The thing is not without precedence.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, surely,' said the Lieutenant-General gently; 'but in the wars and
  quarrels of which you speak some rival prince was always there to take his
  kinsman's place. This is not a dispute among kings and nobles, but an
  uprising of the people for their liberty to force the King to grant them
  their just demands&mdash;therefore, the case is without precedent.'</p>

  <p>'And what, sir, do you deduct from that?' asked Henry Ireton.</p>

  <p>'Why, that if we put the King down there is no one to set in his place.
  The Prince of Wales hath gone abroad to the French Court and a Papist mother;
  the King's nephew, the Elector Charles Louis, who was flattered with some
  hopes of the succession, is a silly choice; the King's other sons are
  children, Rupert and Maurice are free lances&mdash;and which of these, were
  he ever so desirable, would be accepted by the nation while the King
  lives?'</p>

  <p>There was a little pause, and then Harrison said boldly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Why need we a king at all?'</p>

  <p>'It is a good form of government,' replied Cromwell, and I believe the
  only one the English will take. If you have no king you may have a worse
  thing&mdash;every shallow pate faction casts to the top seizing the direction
  of affairs. It was never the design of any of us,' he added, 'to depose the
  King when we took up arms.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' admitted Ireton, 'the design was to bring him to reason, but how
  may that be done when we deal with on who knows not the name of reason?'</p>

  <p>'Now,' said the Lieutenant-General, 'he has no power to be false. Nor will
  the Parliament ever again be as defenceless as it was when he was last at
  Whitehall.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' put in Ireton shrewdly, 'if you offer terms to the King which
  leave the power of the sword with the Parliament, you offer what he, even in
  his utmost extremity, will not accept.'</p>

  <p>'We have had no experience of what he will do in extremity,' replied
  Cromwell, 'since he has never come to it till now.'</p>

  <p>'But has he not,' cried Harrison, 'always refused to give up what he terms
  his rights? Did he not contemptuously reject the Uxbridge Treaty?'</p>

  <p>'As any man might have guessed he would,' replied Cromwell dryly; 'he had
  been no party to the folly of the Presbyterians in asking the King to accept
  these impossible conditions. 'He will always be a Prelatist, yet he
  might&mdash;nay, he must&mdash;rule according to the laws of England, and
  allow all men freedom in their thoughts.'</p>

  <p>'He never will!' exclaimed Harrison.</p>

  <p>'He must,' repeated Cromwell.</p>

  <p>His pipe had now gone out; he knocked out the ashes against the tent pole
  and rose.</p>

  <p>'The settlement of this war,' remarked Henry Ireton, 'is like to be more
  trouble than the fighting of it.'</p>

  <p>'What,' asked Cromwell, with that half-moody, half-tender melancholy that
  so often marked his speech, 'avail these doubts and surmises? It is but lost
  labour that ye haste to rise up so early and so late take rest, and eat the
  bread of carefulness&mdash;"it is in the Lord's hands&mdash;the Lord's will
  be done."'</p>

  <p>Major Harrison rose also; he wore part of his armour; vambrace and cuirass
  clattered as he moved.</p>

  <p>'Ay,' he said, 'worthy Mr. Hugh Peters did wrestle in prayer with the Lord
  for three hours on that point, and afterwards held forth in lovely
  words&mdash;yet were we still in darkness as to God's will with
  us&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Doubt not,' answered Cromwell fervently, 'that He will make it manifest
  as He hath done aforetime.'</p>

  <p>He paused in his pacing and turned to face the huge soldier, who now stood
  with one hand on the tent flap, holding it back.</p>

  <p>The moon was sinking, a white wafer behind the gates and towers of Oxford,
  but the first flush of the dawn replaced her misty light.</p>

  <p>'I look for the Lord!' cried Cromwell. 'My soul doth wait for Him, in His
  word is my trust&mdash;"My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning
  watch, I say before the morning watch!"'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' added Harrison, with a coarser enthusiasm and a blunter speech; 'and
  when the Lord cometh what shall He say&mdash;but slay Dagon and his
  adherents, put to the sword the Amalekite and Edomite and all the brood of
  the Red Dragon. And who is the foremost of these but Charles Stewart?'</p>

  <p>'The Lord,' replied Cromwell, 'hath not yet put it into my soul to put the
  King down, nor to utterly slight his authority. Yet on all these matters I
  would rather be silent&mdash;this is scarce the time for speech on this
  subject.'</p>

  <p>Major Harrison picked up his morion, which bore in front the single
  feather that denoted his rank, and with a few words of farewell left the
  tent.</p>

  <p>Ireton prepared to follow him.</p>

  <p>'A good repose, Harry,' said Cromwell affectionately. 'We have talked over
  long, and I fear to little purpose. We must come to these arguments again at
  Westminster. Get now some sleep&mdash;farewell.'</p>

  <p>When Henry Ireton had gone, Cromwell continued to walk up and down the
  worn turf that formed the floor of the tent.</p>

  <p>'Ah, soul, my soul,' he muttered, 'art thou wandering again in blackness,
  not knowing which way to turn? Do the waters come in and overwhelm thee? Yet
  did not the Lord receive thee into His grace, and make with thee a Covenant
  and a promise? The sword of the Lord and Gideon!&mdash;has it not been given
  thee to wield that weapon, and to triumph with it? Was not the Lord's hand
  plainly shown in that they have felled the malignants as the bricks of Basing
  that fell down one from the other? And hast thou not permitted them to be
  utterly consumed from the land, even from Havilah unto Shur?'</p>

  <p>While he thus exhorted and chided some inner weakness or sadness that was
  liable to come over him, most often at night, and when he was inactive,
  speaking aloud, as was his wont when thus excited, he was startled by the
  sudden entry of one of his officers.</p>

  <p>The man was preceded by the soldier in attendance on Cromwell, who had
  kept guard outside his tent, and now carried a lantern, the strong beams of
  which, disturbing the dubious light of the tent, showed the figure of
  Cromwell standing by the camp-bed on which his armour was piled.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' began the officer, 'we have made, outside the city, a prisoner,
  whom it is expedient Your Excellency should see.'</p>

  <p>'For what purpose, Colonel Parsons?' asked Cromwell wearily, and hanging
  his head on his breast, as he did when tired or thoughtful.</p>

  <p>'Because the malignant, defying us, with much fury, did declare a strange
  thing. He said that the King had escaped from Oxford two days or so ago.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell looked up sharply; his face seemed full of shadows.</p>

  <p>'Bring the prisoner before me,' he said briefly, and seated himself on the
  leathern camp-chair at the foot of his rough couch.</p>

  <p>The officer retired, and soon returned accompanied by two halberdiers
  escorting a young Cavalier, completely disarmed and dusty and disordered in
  his dress, as if he had made a fair struggle before surrendering his
  liberty.</p>

  <p>'Thy name?' asked Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'Charles Lucas,' replied the young man.</p>

  <p>'And what hast thou to say of this escape of the King from Oxford?'</p>

  <p>The young man laughed.</p>

  <p>'I may now freely tell thee, thou cunning rebel, that, His Sacred Majesty
  is by now safe in the hands of his faithful Scots.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell scarcely repressed a violent start.</p>

  <p>'He went from Oxford in the guise of a groom,' continued Sir Charles, in a
  tone of amusement and triumph; 'and I, for one, helped him.'</p>

  <p>'Even so?' said Cromwell, and gazed upon him absently.</p>

  <p>'Shall I not,' asked Colonel Parsons, 'have the young malignant shot
  before the sun is up?'</p>

  <p>The Lieutenant-General roused himself from deep thought with an
  effort.</p>

  <p>'Nay, let him go,' he said; 'we want no more corpses nor prisoners.'</p>

  <p>Parsons, with the freedom the Independent officers took, remonstrated.</p>

  <p>'He is a Socinian, a Prelatist, an Erastian&mdash;even as a soldier of
  Pekah or Jeroboam!'</p>

  <p>'Let him go,' repeated Cromwell, with his usual mildness, 'it is now a
  matter of days. Spare all the blood you can, Colonel Parsons.'</p>

  <p>The dark red flushed the royalist's cheek.</p>

  <p>'I want no mercy nor quarter from rebels,' he said haughtily.</p>

  <p>'Silly boy,' smiled Cromwell, 'take thy vaunts elsewhere,' and Sir
  Charles, whether he would or no, was hustled out of the tent.</p>

  <p>Cromwell sat motionless awhile, holding his hand before his eyes.</p>

  <p>'The Scots,' he was swiftly thinking, 'what a turn is here...he will not
  take the Covenant...Then he is ours for the asking...helpless any way...the
  Scots! Thou art an ill statesman, Charles Stewart...Methinks the war is
  ended.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-09"
     id="ch2-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. THE END OF THE WAR</h2>

  <p class="first">In June of that year two women sat together in an upper room
  of a humble, though decent, house in London, near the Abbey of Westminster
  and the Hall where the Parliament was now sitting.</p>

  <p>This was a back street, crooked and obscure; never as yet had it been
  touched nor disturbed by the clamours and tumults which of late had risen and
  fallen through the broad ways of London like the tempestuous rising and
  falling of the winter sea.</p>

  <p>The two women sat near the window and talked together in low voices.</p>

  <p>One was in her prime but spoilt by sorrow and sickness, her blonde hair
  mixed with grey as if dust had been sprinkled upon it, her face peaked and
  thin, her lids heavy, her eyes dimmed; the other little beyond girlhood, but
  she too disfigured by suffering, and nothing remaining to her of the pleasant
  beauty of youth save the flowing richness of her red-gold curls.</p>

  <p>Both were simply, even humbly, clad, in heavy mourning.</p>

  <p>The younger, after a pause of silence during which both gazed out at the
  sun among the green with eyes that no longer kindled to such a sight,
  remarked&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Bridget Cromwell is married to-day.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied the other; 'they say it is a sure sign of a general
  peace.'</p>

  <p>The young gentlewoman made no reply to this remark, but glanced down at
  the wedding-ring on her fair thin hand.</p>

  <p>'I wonder,' she cried fiercely, 'if she is as happy as I was when I was a
  bride. I wonder if she will ever come to be as unhappy as I am now!'</p>

  <p>Lady Strafford did not reply, and her companion, with the tears smarting
  up into eyes already worn with weeping, continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I could find it in my heart to wish that the rebel's daughter might find
  herself, at my years, a childless widow!'</p>

  <p>'Hush, Jane,' said the Countess; 'this is not charity!'</p>

  <p>'The times,' replied Lady William Pawlet, 'do not teach charity. Thou art
  nobly patient, but I have not yet learnt to hush my railing. All, all gone
  and an empty life! Madonna! how can one support the burden! Oh, to be a man
  and go forward in the front ranks to die as Lord Falkland did! But to be a
  woman&mdash;a woman who must wait till she die of remembering!'</p>

  <p>'There is no answer to be made&mdash;none,' said the Countess; 'the heart
  knoweth its own bitterness.'</p>

  <p>'And we sit here in poverty, bereaved and desolate, and Oliver Cromwell
  hath my Lord Worchester's estates and the thanks of Parliament,' continued
  Lady William, following out thoughts too bitter to be kept silent. 'Loyalty
  now must go barefoot and impudent knavery swell in high places! I will go
  abroad to the Queen in Paris&mdash;she too is desolate and maybe can employ
  me about her person, for I will no longer be a charge on you, madam. Will you
  not,' she added, in a more timid tone, 'come too?'</p>

  <p>'I will not, willingly,' replied the elder lady firmly, 'ever see Her
  Majesty again. Nor yet the King. Thank God I can keep my loyalty and wish His
  Majesty a safe deliverance from all his present perils, but this I know, that
  were he to taste the bitterest death and she the bitterest widowhood, both,
  in the extreme hour of their misery, could endure no greater torment than to
  remember Lord Strafford and how he died.'</p>

  <p>She spoke quietly without raised voice or flushed cheek, yet so intensely,
  that Jane Pawlet, who had never heard her mention this subject before, was
  horrified and awed.</p>

  <p>'The world is upside down, I think,' she murmured. 'It all seems to me so
  unreal&mdash;I doubt it can be more strange in hell.'</p>

  <p>'You are young,' replied the Countess, 'and may live to think of all this
  as a clouded dream. But my life is over.'</p>

  <p>'You have been the wife of a great man,' cried Lady William Pawlet, 'and
  you have children.'</p>

  <p>'Whom I must see grow up as landless exiles, bearing an attainted name,'
  said Lady Strafford, with a stern smile.</p>

  <p>'But you have fulfilled yourself,' returned the other, 'while I have been,
  and am, useless. Ah me, how differently I dreamed it!'</p>

  <p>Then the poor widow, overwhelmed by recollections of a happiness which now
  seemed the doubly dazzling because it had been so brief, rose to conceal her
  emotion, and moved restlessly round the room.</p>

  <p>Lady Strafford glanced at her and, with an effort to distract her mind,
  touched on another subject.</p>

  <p>'I had a letter from Margaret Lucas in Paris&mdash;so ill spelt I can
  hardly read it; but it seems the Marquess of Newcastle hath come to St.
  Germains and that they are reading each other's poetry&mdash;so belike there
  will be a match there.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes?' said Lady William heavily.</p>

  <p>'They have both lost their estates,' continued the Countess, 'so it will
  be a fair trial of their love and constancy.'</p>

  <p>As she spoke there was a light, almost uncertain knock on the door.</p>

  <p>Lady Strafford, who, in her narrow circumstances, kept no servant, looked
  from the window cautiously.</p>

  <p>'It is my brother,' she said, and the younger lady at once left the room,
  soon returning accompanied by Sir Denzil Holles.</p>

  <p>This gentleman had always been of a contrary party to the Earl of
  Strafford, and in the first part of his life had seen but little of his
  magnificent sister. He had, however, done his utmost to save the Earl's life,
  and was now almost the principle support of the Countess and her
  children.</p>

  <p>He was not in arms for Parliament (though he had been one of the famous
  five members), and, being estranged from the army by the fact of his
  Presbyterian religion, and animated by a great dislike of Oliver Cromwell, he
  stood as much aloof as he was able from the clashes of the times, though he
  led a considerable party in the Commons.</p>

  <p>'Any news?' asked his sister, after greeting him affectionately.</p>

  <p>'The usual,' replied Sir Denzil gloomily. 'Oxford surrendered&mdash;the
  princes and Sir Ralph Hopton are gone beyond seas&mdash;Sir Jacob Astley with
  the last force of royalists bath been taken&mdash;and Bridget Cromwell is now
  Bridget Ireton.'</p>

  <p>'The King's cause, then,' said the Countess, 'is utterly lost and
  ruined?'</p>

  <p>'As far as it can be maintained by arms, it is,' replied her brother, who,
  though he had been imprisoned by King Charles, showed no great elation at his
  downfall. 'And as it is certain he will not take the Covenant&mdash;why, you
  may take it it is altogether ruined.'</p>

  <p>'He will not?' asked Lady William Pawlet.</p>

  <p>'Nay, though they have entreated him on their knees, with tears&mdash;as
  have we, the Presbyterians&mdash;and if he will not take it, there is not a
  single Scot will shoulder a musket for him.'</p>

  <p>'It seems,' remarked the Countess quietly, 'that the King can be faithful
  to some things.'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' said Sir Denzil, 'to the Church of England and his Crown. I believe
  he would resign life itself sooner than either.'</p>

  <p>'Therefore, if the Scots will not fight there is an end of the war?' said
  his sister. 'Well, Denzil, what shall we do?'</p>

  <p>'Get beyond seas, unless I can put down the army,' he replied. 'This is no
  longer a country for such as I. The King is overcome&mdash;but in his place
  is like to be a worse tyrant.'</p>

  <p>'You mean Oliver Cromwell?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Denzil Holles bitterly. 'That man is now the front of all
  things&mdash;he hath the army at his back and groweth bigger every day.'</p>

  <p>'The talk is,' said his sister, 'that he would make accommodation with the
  King, whereas many of his party are for measures the most extreme, even for
  setting up a Republic&mdash;so it is said&mdash;but I know not. What does one
  hear but echoes of echoes in a retirement such as this?'</p>

  <p>'It matters not,' replied Sir Denzil, 'things are all ajar in England. I
  have a mind to Holland to a little quiet, some books, a few
  friends&mdash;Ralph Hopton is at the Hague. I can be no use in this
  whirligig, and I will save what little credit, what little fortune, I have
  left.'</p>

  <p>He had often spoken so before, but had always been drawn back to the
  whirlpool at Westminster, and his sister believed that he would be so
  again.</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' said Lady Strafford, 'London is no place for me&mdash;every
  paving-stone hath a memory...And you, child, will you go to Paris?'</p>

  <p>Yes, madam, to the Queen, who was always a good friend to me. We have the
  same faith, as you know.'</p>

  <p>'The noble family of Pawlet,' remarked Sir Denzil gracefully, 'have a
  great claim on the house of Stewart. The defence of Basing was one of the
  noblest actions of this unhappy war.'</p>

  <p>'The Marquess lost everything,' said Lady William Pawlet. 'Even the bricks
  were pulled down and sold&mdash;even my lord's shirts&mdash;and his
  bedchamber invaded by the vulgar, who burnt all the tapestry there for the
  sake of the gold threads in it, and they were the most beautiful hangings in
  England. What is loyalty's reward? Bitter, I fear, bitter.'</p>

  <p>She glanced out of the window at the unchanging sunshine as if it hurt her
  eyes, then moved away again restlessly round the room.</p>

  <p>The Countess made an effort to stir a silence that was so full of
  memories, of regrets, of disappointments.</p>

  <p>'Well,' she said, 'the war is over and we shall go abroad; but what will
  happen in England?'</p>

  <p>'That,' replied Sir Denzil sternly, 'is very much in the hands of Oliver
  Cromwell.'</p>

  Hammond</span>, Nov. 1648.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-01"
     id="ch3-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE ISSUE WITH THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">On a summer afternoon in the year 1647, an officer, with a
  small escort of arquebusiers, rode from Putney to Hampton village, and
  turning briskly towards the palace, passed unchallenged, and saluted by the
  sentries, through the great iron gates, over the moat, and stopped at the
  principal entrance.</p>

  <p>The captain of the guard-house came out.</p>

  <p>''Tis Lieutenant-General Cromwell!' he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Ah, Colonel Parsons,' returned the other pleasantly. 'I do recall that
  thou went here&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Things have changed since we besieged Oxford, sir,' said Parsons.</p>

  <p>'Ay, and gotten themselves into a fine confusion,' replied Cromwell; 'but
  I will see the King. Tell His Majesty who waits.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, sir, step in,' said Parsons; 'the days are gone by when men had to
  wait for an audience of His Majesty.'</p>

  <p>'Yet I trust to it that he is entertained with civility?' said the
  Lieutenant-General. 'Were it otherwise it would look very ill.'</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply to this, which was intended more as a rebuke
  to Parsons' tone of speech than as question, for Cromwell knew very well how
  the King was treated and lodged, the Lieutenant-General passed up the stairs
  and along the galleries towards the royal apartments, preceded by one of the
  palace attendants.</p>

  <p>Parsons looked after him with mingled admiration and envy.</p>

  <p>'There goes the darling of the army and the terror of the Parliament,' he
  said to another officer who had joined him. 'They no more know what to do
  with Noll Cromwell than they know what to do with Charles Stewart.'</p>

  <p>He voiced the common view of the situation of the Parliament men; the
  which had indeed found themselves in greater difficulties during the peace
  than they had done during the war, though they had succeeded in getting the
  Scots out of the kingdom and the King into their own hands.</p>

  <p>After wearisome and confused negotiations between the King, the Scots, and
  the Presbyterians had come to nothing through Charles' haughty refusal to
  forsake the Church of England and take the solemn Covenant, the Parliament
  had paid the Scots 20,000, as an instalment of the pay due to them, and on
  this the Northerners had marched away across the Borders to the endless
  disputes among themselves, headed by Argyll, the Covenanter, and Hamilton,
  the royalist, who were now one up, now one down, like boys on a see-saw.</p>

  <p>The King had been delivered to the Parliamentary Commissioners and lodged
  with great respect at Holmby.</p>

  <p>And then the Parliament was confronted with other problems; On one hand
  the clamours of the people for a good understanding with His Majesty, and on
  the other side the claims of the army, which refused to be disbanded without
  the arrears of pay owing, which arrears were not forthcoming except in so
  small a proportion as to be indignantly refused by the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Some of the right was on the side of the army and all the might. Neither
  Parliament nor nation could do anything with them, especially as all the
  force and fervour of the new Puritan religion which had defeated the King was
  to be found in the ranks of the soldiers, for nearly all the Parliament men
  were Presbyterians, and nearly all the army belonged to one or other of the
  enthusiastic sects commonly named 'Independents'; and on either side of this
  cleavage of religious belief was nearly as much bitterness as had animated
  Puritan and Papist against each other.</p>

  <p>Denzil Holles had resolved to stay in England, and was busy leading a
  party in Parliament against the chiefs of the army, principally against the
  Lieutenant-General, who was looked upon as the great man of his side, nay, by
  some, as the great man of the nation.</p>

  <p>He, on his part, maintained a singular quiet, nor put himself forward in
  any way. He had moved his family from Ely to London, and there resided
  quietly or moved about from place to place as his duties called,
  contradicting no man and interfering with none; yet somehow his figure was
  always in the background of men's thoughts, and all either feared him, or
  looked to him hopefully as their case might be, as if from him must come,
  sooner or later, the healing of the schisms, the twisting together of the
  intricate strands of faction, the smoothing out of the tangled confusions
  that now maddened and bewildered men.</p>

  <p>There were able, honest leaders in every sect and faction, there were
  clever, high-minded politicians like Sir Harry Vane, there were energetic and
  successful soldiers like Sir Thomas Fairfax, and there were men like Ireton
  who combined the qualities of both&mdash;all of whom were respected and
  followed by their several parties. But none stood out so vividly in the eyes
  of both friend and foe as did the figure of Oliver Cromwell, whose cavalry
  charges had turned the tide of battle at Marston Moor and Naseby, who was the
  idol of that army which seemed now to hold the balance of power, and whose
  utterances in Parliament had shown him to be as decisive, as wary, as
  brilliant in attack, as quick in resource, as commanding a personality in
  politics as he was on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Yet there was perhaps no one, among all the men whom the times had made
  prominent, who kept so in the background of events during the last turmoils,
  confusions, and intricacies of the negotiations and consultations between the
  King, the Scots, the Parliament, the Army, the Presbyterians, and the
  Independents.</p>

  <p>Since the conclusion of the Civil War, the King had been, and continued to
  be, the great clement of discord and difficulty. No one could resign
  themselves to do without him, and no one knew what to do with him; the Scots
  had given him up in despair, and the Parliamentary Commissioners found him
  equally impossible to deal with. A general deadlock had been solved, Gordian
  knot fashion, by the army; Cornet Joyce and six hundred men, acting under
  what orders no one knew, but acting certainly according to the general wish,
  had carried off the King (very much to his will and liking), from Holmby, to
  the great dismay of the parliamentary Presbyterians, and lodged him at
  Hinchinbrook, from whence he moved about with the army, treated in kingly
  style. He was finally taken to Hampton Court, the army headquarters being now
  at Putney, in such ominous nearness to London that the great city itself was
  believed to tremble, and at Westminster there was open turmoil.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-General Cromwell, who, with the other officers, had been
  ordered to his regiments when news came of Cornet Joyce's amazing action, but
  who had already gone (not without some haste, his enemies said, for fear of
  an arrest from the incensed Parliament, for it was credited that his was the
  authority under which Joyce had acted), had remained at Putney for some weeks
  before this visit of his to Hampton Court.</p>

  <p>He was, with little delay, admitted to the King's ante-chamber, where Lord
  Digby received him, and soon into the King's presence. The apartment was one
  of the beautiful chambers built and decorated by Henry VIII.; old oak, carved
  in a deep linen pattern and worn to a colour that was almost dark silver,
  formed the walls, and round the deep blue painted ceiling ran a design of
  'A.H.' and the Tudor roses, quartered thus to please the first English Queen
  who died a public and shameful death.</p>

  <p>An oriel window, brilliant with painted blazonry, was set open on to the
  gardens which sloped to the willow trees and the river, and in the
  red-cushioned window-seat the King's white dog slept.</p>

  <p>The furniture was very handsome stately oak and stamped Spanish leather;
  above the low mantelshelf hung a picture by Antonio Mor, a portrait of the
  sad-faced Mary Tudor, in white cambric and black velvet, gold chain, and
  breviary.</p>

  <p>Charles was seated at a coral-red lacquer cabinet or desk powdered with
  gold figures&mdash;a princely piece of furniture, rich and costly. Cromwell,
  seeing him, paused in the doorway and took off his broad-leaved hat.</p>

  <p>The two exchanged a quick and steady look. Cromwell had last seen the King
  at Childerly House, only a few weeks before, when he and General Fairfax had
  ridden down to Huntingdon to meet His Majesty; but the interview had been
  brief, by torchlight, and the Lieutenant-General had taken little part in it.
  The King, too, had been largely obscured by a horseman's hat and cloak, so
  that the last clear remembrance Cromwell had of the King remained that of the
  famous day when Charles had come to Westminster to seize the five
  members.</p>

  <p>That scene and the central figure of it remained very vividly in
  Cromwell's mind, even across all the stormy years which lay between then and
  now. He recalled the unutterable haughtiness, the poise, the splendour, the
  rich attire of the King then; he would not have known the man before him for
  the same.</p>

  <p>Charles wore a brown cloth suit passemented with silver, grey hose, and
  shoes with dark red roses on them; his whole attire was careless, even
  neglected, and he had no jewellery, order, or any kind of adornment, save a
  deep falling collar of Flemish thread lace.</p>

  <p>But the change in his attire was not so remarkable as the change in his
  appearance; his hair, which still fell in love-locks on to his shoulders, was
  utterly grey, and his face had a grey look too, so entirely devoid was it of
  any brightness of colour, his features were swollen and suffused, and his
  eyes were heavy-lidded and unutterably weary.</p>

  <p>It gave Oliver Cromwell a sudden start to see the King, whose mere name
  was such a tower of strength, who had vaunted himself so proudly, and been so
  tenacious of his royal rights, reduced to this semblance of beaten humanity
  who bore on his face the marks of how he had suffered in body and soul.
  Cromwell himself had changed too; he was a year older than Charles, but, in
  his untouched vigour and ardent air of strength and enthusiasm, looked many
  years younger; his buff and soldierly appointments were richer than formerly,
  and he carried himself with an air of greater authority and decision.</p>

  <p>Charles set down the quill with which he was writing, and pointed to a
  chair with arms near the window.</p>

  <p>'What can Lieutenant-General Cromwell,' he said, with a most delicate,
  most scornful, emphasis on the title, want with me?'</p>

  <p>Cromwell gazed at him with unabashed grey eyes. It might be acutely in the
  King's mind that it was strange for a country gentleman to be thus facing a
  King of England, but no such thought disturbed the Puritan.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he returned, 'the nation is in a crisis that must end
  soon&mdash;the army and the Parliament are in disagreements. We are the
  victims of unsearchable judgments.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed Charles, who was not sorry to hear it, and who hoped, in the
  troubled waters of these divisions, to fish for his own benefit; he was
  already like a wedge between Parliament and army, splitting them further
  apart.</p>

  <p>'I am here,' continued Cromwell, 'as representing the army.'</p>

  <p>'Sent by a deputation?' asked the King keenly.</p>

  <p>His greatest hope was in the army.</p>

  <p>Sent by no deputation,' returned the other firmly. 'Inspired only by the
  Lord, yet what I offer I could engage the fulfilment of.'</p>

  <p>There was a quiet assumption of power in these words that was wormwood to
  the King, but he controlled himself.</p>

  <p>'You have come to propose terms,' he said. 'I have been listening to terms
  for long weary months. What are yours?'</p>

  <p>'Nay, I make no terms with Your Majesty,' said Cromwell. 'I only wish you
  to be sincere with your people.'</p>

  <p>It was what John Pym had said at the very beginning&mdash;before the war,
  Charles remembered; he remembered, too, that he had offered Pym a price and
  Pym had refused. 'You did not bid high enough,' the Queen said afterwards.
  Charles, ever untaught by experience, proceeded to repeat with Cromwell the
  tactics he had used with Pym. What, after all, could this man have come for,
  save to drive a bargain? And he was worth bargaining with, as Pym had
  been&mdash;powerful rebels both!</p>

  <p>The King's eyes shot hate at the quiet figure before him, but he answered
  smoothly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Sincere! You and I speak a different language, sir, but I will try to
  understand you. You mean that the army will do something for me? That you
  might influence them on my behalf?'</p>

  <p>Cromwell rose and moved to the oriel window; an expression of agitation
  swept into his face.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he said, with deep earnestness, 'Your Majesty is the only remedy
  for these present divisions&mdash;until a good peace be established, and you
  be again at Whitehall, the nation is but like a parcel of twigs which,
  unbound, cannot stand. Sir, I know there are extreme men who think otherwise,
  but they are of the sort who are always there, and must be never heeded.'</p>

  <p>A wave of exultation made the blood bound in the King's veins; he was then
  indispensable to the nation. His swift, secret thought was that he might
  regain his throne on his own terms, without yielding a jot of his
  prerogatives, since his arch-enemy admitted what he had admitted.</p>

  <p>'The army desires to see Your Majesty in your rightful place,' continued
  Cromwell, 'and would and could bring you to London despite the
  Parliament.'</p>

  <p>'Well?' asked Charles.</p>

  <p>'We must have,' said Cromwell, with a certain heaviness, 'the things for
  which we have fought, for which we have poured out our blood.'</p>

  <p>A bitterly sarcastic smile curved the King's thin lips. Cromwell was
  coming to his price, he thought; he wondered what he would ask, and what
  might be promised with safety.</p>

  <p>'We must have toleration for God's people,' said the Puritan.</p>

  <p>The King interrupted.</p>

  <p>'I will not take the Covenant. I have already refused an army because of
  that condition.'</p>

  <p>'You are now, sir,' returned Cromwell bluntly, 'dealing with Englishmen,
  not Scots. We set no such store by the Covenant. I said, sir,
  toleration.'</p>

  <p>'A word,' remarked Charles, 'beloved of fanatics.'</p>

  <p>'A word,' said Cromwell, unmoved, 'dear to honest men. We would have all
  deal with God according to their conscience.'</p>

  <p>The King did not think it worth while to probe into the reservation this
  tolerance made in disfavour of Prelacy and Papacy, the two faiths <i>he</i>
  believed in. The whole gamut of theological questions had been run through
  and argued upon during the conferences at Newcastle, and had left Charles as
  firm an adherent as before of the Anglican Church. The whole subject of the
  Puritan faith, associated as it was with vexation, disloyalty, and rebellion,
  was too distasteful a one for him to enter on; he reserved his wit and
  strength for the more practical issues.</p>

  <p>'Will you tell me briefly, sir, the main purpose of this visit?'</p>

  <p>'I wished,' said Cromwell, 'to sound Your Majesty. The army would not
  waste its labours&mdash;and Your Majesty hath been slippery,' he added
  calmly.</p>

  <p>The outraged blood stormed the King's cheeks; but the several instances of
  his duplicity were too well known and too well attested to be for an instant
  denied.</p>

  <p>'I am a prisoner,' he said haughtily, 'and therefore forbidden
  resentment.'</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers he drew nearer to him a bowl of yellow roses that
  stood on his desk and nervously pulled at the leaves.</p>

  <p>Cromwell did not look at him, but at the peaceful and lovely view of
  garden and river beyond the oriel window.</p>

  <p>'The army,' he pursued quietly, giving weight to every word, 'would have
  no trafficking with foreign powers, no bringing of foreign forces, no
  stirrings and meddlings in Ireland or Scotland, no vengeance taken on any of
  their number, a free Parliament, and free churches. To a king who could agree
  to these things&mdash;swear to them&mdash;<i>on the word of a king</i>, and
  on that pledge keep them&mdash;there would be small difficulty in his coming
  again to his ancient place and power. Remember these things, Your Majesty;
  consider and ponder them. I shall come again to consult with you. "Put thou
  thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good; dwell in the land, and verily thou
  shalt be fed&mdash;delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee thy
  heart's desire." Cast thyself on these words, sir, that God hath moved me to
  say to thee.'</p>

  <p>He spoke with such earnestness, dignity, such extraordinary conviction
  that the King's sneer died on his lips, and though his sensation of respect
  was instantly gone, still it had been there.</p>

  <p>'Above all,' added Cromwell, 'I pray Your Majesty be sincere. If you
  mislike what I have said, what I have asked of you&mdash;bid me not to come
  again.'</p>

  <p>The King took this to mean, 'Will you deal with me or no?' and he answered
  without hesitation, for he was well aware of Cromwell's power and
  prestige.</p>

  <p>'Come again and let us talk of these things at leisure. I commonly walk in
  the galleries in the afternoon. Let me some day have your company.'</p>

  <p>He rose; a smile softened his haggard face into something of its ancient
  grace.</p>

  <p>'Do not disappoint me of your second coming,' he said. He held out his
  hand. Cromwell, without hesitation or confusion, kissed it and left.</p>

  <p>While his steps were yet sounding without, Charles rang a bell on his desk
  that instantly summoned Lord Digby from the adjoining apartment.</p>

  <p>'Open the window wider!' cried the King, with a shudder. 'The air is
  tainted...'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-02"
     id="ch3-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE KING'S PLOTS</h2>

  <p class="first">'That man,' added Charles, in a tone of great agitation,
  'will make terms. He came abruptly and left abruptly, he spoke
  obscurely&mdash;but his meaning was to offer himself for my service.'</p>

  <p>'It is no wonder,' replied Lord Digby, 'there is a great and widening rift
  between the army and the Parliament, and Cromwell hath been heard to very
  plainly urge on the Presbyterians the advisability of submitting to Your
  Majesty.'</p>

  <p>'What,' muttered the King, walking about the room, 'does he want?'</p>

  <p>'Did he not tell Your Majesty? Methought that had been the object of his
  visit.'</p>

  <p>'He told me,' replied Charles, 'the usual demands&mdash;what the army
  would have, what it would not have. I take no notice of that. What doth he
  want for himself?'</p>

  <p>'His price would be a high one,' returned Lord Digby thoughtfully. 'He is
  much esteemed by his party; he hath good hopes of rising.'</p>

  <p>'Faugh!' cried the King angrily. 'He hath <i>risen</i>&mdash;what more can
  he hope? He comes to me because he finds his usurped honours perilous,
  because he can hardly hold his own. There is no loyalty in the fellow. I take
  him to be a very artful, false rebel.'</p>

  <p>'Yet,' said my lord earnestly, 'he is worth gaining. I know of none whom
  the rebels think so highly of, and his interest in the army is supreme.'</p>

  <p>'I also have some interest in the army,' said Charles haughtily. 'Dost
  thou not know it? Even as this Cromwell knoweth it&mdash;else why doth he
  come to me? Nay, he is well aware that I still count for something in this my
  kingdom.'</p>

  <p>'Still, I would say that it were well to gain Oliver Cromwell&mdash;if he
  be willing to bring the army over to Your Majesty. I say, he is greater in
  the public eye than we can think. His party taketh him for a man.'</p>

  <p>'And so he is, and therefore can be gained,' replied Charles, with a
  bitter smile. 'I tell thee it goes to my heart to deal with this fellow, whom
  I would very willingly see hanged; indeed, it does. But as I do believe he
  hath influence, I will do it. What would he have&mdash;some patent of
  nobility? It were fitting to offer him the rebel Essex's title. Hath he not
  some distant relation to that Thomas Cromwell who was the Earl of Essex?'</p>

  <p>'I have heard it,' assented Lord Digby, 'and I believe that Your Majesty
  hath hit on a good bait. Cromwell hath much railed against the nobility,
  which is a good sign in a man that he would have a title himself.'</p>

  <p>'And Fairfax&mdash;I must throw a sop to Fairfax,' continued Charles.
  'There is more loyalty and more manners in him than in his Lieutenant.'</p>

  <p>'He is not,' added Lord Digby, 'so useful.'</p>

  <p>Charles paused before the window.</p>

  <p>'You know,' he said, 'that my best hopes are still in Scotland, and not
  with these rebels. If I can make a secret treaty with the Scots, I am
  independent of army and Parliament both.'</p>

  <p>Lord Digby was not practical nor level-headed. His loyalty was too sincere
  to allow him broad-mindedness in his view of the struggle now taking place in
  England, and his ideas were rather fantastical and partook of that lightness
  and even frivolity which characterized so many of the King's followers; but
  even he could not help seeing that Charles was playing a game which every day
  became more dangerous, and that this complicated and subtle intrigue was not
  suited to present circumstances. A straight dealing with the army leaders,
  the Cavalier thought, would have been better than these underhand
  negotiations with the Scots, who had already proved themselves so unreliable,
  especially as Charles never would, under any pressure, take the Covenant, and
  therefore his alliance with Scotland could only be based on delusion and
  fraud; while, at the same time, if these negotiations were revealed, the
  English Parliament and the English army would be further set against the
  King, and with England and the divisions in England lay Charles' best
  chance&mdash;not in his northern kingdom.</p>

  <p>It was these constant intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the King,
  his blindness to his real interests, his unconquerable disdain of his
  enemies, his firm refusal to believe that any pact or agreement was possible
  between him, the King, and them, his subjects, his proud resignation, which
  would take any ill, but would never give way on any detail, however small,
  that had driven those fierce and downright Princes, Rupert and Maurice, out
  of England. Rupert had thought the Royal cause lost before he delivered
  Bristol, yet the King had had many chances since then, all lost, or missed,
  or flung away.</p>

  <p>He was too extraordinarily incredulous of his enemies' successes; it
  seemed as if he could not believe nor remember that he was no longer what he
  had been, one of the foremost kings in Europe, but a monarch without an army,
  without a town, without revenues or allies, separated from his family,
  surrounded by adversaries, practically a prisoner, and dependent on the dole
  of the Parliament for the very bread he ate. Charles could not realize these
  things&mdash;his birth, his instincts, his character were too strong for his
  intelligence, though that was not mean&mdash;and he still blinded himself
  with the idea that he was the King, and that he needed no other claim and no
  other force than what lay in those words to eventually triumph over, and be
  signally revenged on, his rebellious subjects.</p>

  <p>Not that Charles had shown this temper too openly or exhibited any outward
  folly in his long dealings with Scots and Parliament. These complicated
  negotiations had shown him at his best; he had been clever, learned,
  courteous, full of resource and firmness. The principle of his unalterable
  divine authority (the rock on which all the various hopes of a compromise
  were eventually shattered) he kept securely out of sight, being too proud to
  vaunt or rave. None the less it was there, and he was disdainfully storing up
  future vengeance for all of them&mdash;Scots, Presbyterians, Parliament men,
  army men, and Puritans&mdash;when the time should come for him to have done
  playing with them.</p>

  <p>Such advisers as he had (the Queen was still the foremost) supported him
  in his views and in the means he took to advance his aims; but now affairs
  were become so desperate that he held the bare semblance of kingship only by
  the consent and tolerance of the Parliament and the army. And it occurred to
  many, as it occurred now to Lord Digby, that an open peace with the rebels on
  the best terms to be got was the safest, indeed the only, policy to be
  pursued.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby ventured now to say as much, in guarded and respectful terms,
  but with as much weight as his own volatile nature (only too much like
  Charles' own) would allow.</p>

  <p>The King, resting one elbow on the window-sill, his chin in his hand and
  his eyes fixed on the passing glitter of the river, listened with impatience
  hardly disguised.</p>

  <p>Soon he interrupted.</p>

  <p>'Next thou wilt advise me to take the Covenant,' he said, 'or to accept
  the articles offered me at Uxbridge or Norwich!'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' answered Lord Digby, with a flush on his fair face; 'but I do say
  there is no reliance to be placed on the Scots.'</p>

  <p>'Wait,' returned Charles obstinately. 'I am of good hopes I can get an
  army from them without taking the Covenant, but on the mere promise to do so,
  and on some suspension of the bishops for three years or so&mdash;some
  compromise, worked secretly.'</p>

  <p>'Is this plan laid?' asked Digby, who had not before heard of it.</p>

  <p>'Yea, with my Lord Hamilton, and then I shall be able to hang up all these
  knavish rascals who come to me to bargain&mdash;to offer terms to
  <i>me</i>!'</p>

  <p>'Meanwhile flatter them,' said my lord uneasily.</p>

  <p>'I will flatter them,' returned Charles, with a flash in his worn eyes. 'I
  will talk of an Earldom to Cromwell&mdash;but I hope the Scots will be across
  the Border again before the patent is signed!'</p>

  <p>Lord Digby was still not convinced; it seemed to him that this overture
  from a man of the weight and influence of Oliver Cromwell was not an advance
  to be lightly treated at this delicate stage of affairs.</p>

  <p>'This man is fanatic,' he said. 'Your Majesty must remember that. I
  believe he standeth more for principle than party, more for his ideas than
  for his gain. A title may allure him, but it is a matter where one would need
  to be careful, sire. The bait must be skilfully played, or this fish will not
  rise.'</p>

  <p>But Charles, though supremely constant on some points himself, found it
  impossible to believe in the constancy of those whose opinions were opposed
  to him; such as Cromwell were to him 'rebels,' and he gave them no other
  distinction.</p>

  <p>'We shall see as to that,' he replied impatiently. What did this man come
  here for, if not to get his price?'</p>

  <p>'Methinks he came on behalf of his policy,' said Lord Digby doubtfully.
  'Maybe he would have the credit of reconciling Your Majesty with the
  Parliament, and after the peace some great place in the army or at your
  Council board.'</p>

  <p>'These high ambitions may be useful to us,' replied Charles, with a bitter
  accent, 'and therefore we will encourage them. Meanwhile, our hopes lie
  across the Border or across the sea&mdash;not in the rebel camp.'</p>

  <p>He was then silent a little while and seemed, as had become usual with
  him, to have suddenly sunk into a meditation or reverie; he would so do now
  in the midst of a conversation, the midst of a sentence even, as if his mind
  wandered suddenly from the present to the past, from the objects near to
  objects far away.</p>

  <p>His face looked as if a veil had been dropped over it, so completely
  absent was his gaze, so utterly did an expression of melancholy hide and
  disguise all other.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby stood watching him with bitter regret, with indignant sorrow,
  and as he gazed at this face which humiliation and anguish had distorted and
  altered as a terrible disease will distort and alter, as he noticed the grey
  locks, the thin, marred profile, the careless dress, a horrible conviction
  pressed on his heart with the certainty of a revelation; the King was ruined,
  broken, cast down; never would he be set up again, and these schemes and
  plots were mere baseless delusions. This conviction was as fleeting as it was
  strong, yet for one moment the faithful gentleman had seen his master as a
  thing utterly lost, and he turned his head away swiftly, for he loved the man
  as well as the King.</p>

  <p>Charles turned from the window, his thin fingers still pressed to his
  face.</p>

  <p>'Go and see if any letters have come,' he said.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby did not say that immediately a courier came he was brought to
  the King, and therefore there could be no letters without his instant
  knowledge, but turned sadly to go on his errand; he knew the King was waiting
  always for letters from Henriette Marie in France&mdash;imperious, passionate
  letters when they came, which he kissed every line of and sprinkled with the
  scalding tears of pride and love and regret.</p>

  <p>As soon as Lord Digby had gone Charles drew from his doublet a gold chain,
  from which hung two diamond seals and a miniature in a case ornamented with
  whole pearls.</p>

  <p>He touched the spring, the lid flew up, and he gazed at the little enamel
  which showed him the features of the Queen.</p>

  <p>The painting had been done in her bridal days, and the artist's delicate
  skill had preserved for ever the seductive loveliness of her early youth; she
  wore white, and her complexion was the tint of blonde pearl, her dark hair
  hung in fine tendrils on her brow, her large eyes were glancing at the
  spectator with a laughing look, round her neck was a string of large pearls,
  and on her bosom a bow of pink ribbon.</p>

  <p>So he remembered her as he had first seen her, when, at the first glance,
  she had subdued him into her willing bondsman; before he met her he had been
  cold to women, and after meeting her there had been no other in the world for
  him.</p>

  <p>He never reflected if this complete absorption in her, this submission to
  her will had been for his good; he never recalled the many fatal mistakes she
  had advised, nor the damage done him by his unpopular Romanist Queen; he
  never even admitted to himself that the one action of his life for which he
  felt bitter remorse, the abandonment of Strafford, was mainly committed to
  please her; nor did it ever occur to him that many women would have stayed
  with him to the last, at all costs. The brightness of his devotion outshone
  all these things; he saw her image good and brave and infinitely dear, and of
  all his losses the loss of her was paramount. As he thought of her, his
  longing half formed the resolution to quit all these turmoils and escape to
  France, abandoning for her sake his last chances of keeping his crown.</p>

  <p>He might have come to this resolution before and carried it through had he
  not too well known her pride and her ambition.</p>

  <p>'If you make an agreement with Parliament,' she had written, 'you are no
  king for me. I will never set foot in England again.'</p>

  <p>And he had promised her that he would make no pact with the rebels unless
  she had first approved.</p>

  <p>A light cloud passed over the sun, the sparkle died from the river, the
  glow from the sky, the warm tremble of light from the trees; and as Charles
  looked other clouds came up, in stately battalions, and darkened the whole
  west.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby returned.</p>

  <p>'No messenger, sire,' he said, 'no letters.'</p>

  <p>'I did know it,' replied Charles, with a smile that cast scorn on himself;
  'but I am my own fool, and beguile the time with mine own follies.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-03"
     id="ch3-03"></a>CHAPTER III. LIEUT.-GENERAL CROMWELL, ROYALIST</h2>

  <p class="first">'Thou goest too often to Hampton Court,' said Major
  Harrison. 'I say it to thy face.'</p>

  <p>'Thou mayst say it before any man,' returned Cromwell mildly, 'and do no
  harm.'</p>

  <p>'If you will have any influence with the army you will go no more,'
  continued Harrison.</p>

  <p>'Ay!' said Cromwell, with the same patience; 'but I think neither of my
  influence with the army nor of any other thing, friends, but of what the Lord
  hath put it in my heart to do for His service and the peace of these
  times.'</p>

  <p>So saying, he laid down a little manual of gun drill, the pages of which
  he had been turning over, and relit his pipe.</p>

  <p>The scene was the guard-room of the army's headquarters at Putney.
  Cromwell had been to London that morning to see his family, who were now
  established in a mansion in Drury Lane, and his buff coat and his falling
  boots were still dusty with the dust of the return ride.</p>

  <p>Fairfax was in the room and the preacher, Hugh Peters. The bolder Harrison
  voiced their opinions when he told Cromwell that he was becoming too intimate
  with the King and too firm a supporter of the royal pretensions; but Fairfax,
  from a natural reserve, and Peters, because he hoped the Lieutenant-General
  would make an adequate defence, were silent.</p>

  <p>'Little did I ever think,' cried Harrison, pacing heavily about the room,
  'that thou wouldst become the consort of tyrants, the frequenter of the
  strange children, whose mouth talketh of vanity, and whose right hand is a
  hand of iniquity!'</p>

  <p>Cromwell raised his calm eyes from his long clay pipe.</p>

  <p>'No man will enjoy his possessions in peace until the King hath his rights
  again,' he said, 'and I make no disguise from you nor from any that I am
  doing my utmost to bring about a good peace with His Majesty. For what other
  reason did any of us take up arms?'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' assented Sir Thomas Fairfax hastily, 'and the Parliament and the
  city of London are pressing for a settlement.'</p>

  <p>'My visits to Hampton Palace,' continued Cromwell, 'and my communings with
  the King have had this one object&mdash;a good peace.'</p>

  <p>If thou canst bring Charles Stewart to a good peace&mdash;<i>and make him
  keep it</i>&mdash;thou hast more than mortal skill,' said Harrison.</p>

  <p>'What wouldst thou in this realm?' asked Cromwell, glancing up at him with
  a gleam of humour. 'A republic?'</p>

  <p>The other three were silent at this; even among the extremists the idea of
  totally abolishing the kingship was scarcely murmured.</p>

  <p>'Well, then,' said Cromwell, with a little smile, glancing round the three
  silent faces, 'a treaty with the King is the only means to get us out of our
  present imbroglio, is it not? Now we have conquered His Majesty, we must make
  terms with him.'</p>

  <p>'You never will,' cried Hugh Peters vehemently. 'He is false and false,
  unstable and creeping in his ways&mdash;even while you confer with him he is
  arranging to bring in the Scots again or murdering Papists from Ireland or
  the French!'</p>

  <p>'How do you know?' asked the Lieutenant-General, turning sharply in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>Mr. Peters glanced at Major Harrison, who replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>'It is true that I have my finger in some plots the King hath in hand. His
  agents meet at the Blue Boar in Holborn, and he hath a whole service of
  secret couriers travelling between England, the Scots, and France. As yet I
  have no letters, no absolute proofs in my possession, but I do not think to
  lack them long.'</p>

  <p>'Have you long known of this, Sir Thomas?' asked Cromwell, rising.</p>

  <p>'A week or so,' replied the General; 'but I have not given it overmuch
  attention. If one listened to all the rumours of plots one's brain would be
  confounded.'</p>

  <p>'I have men in disguise at the Blue Boar,' said Harrison stubbornly, 'and
  soon I hope to prove my suspicions correct.'</p>

  <p>'Why, if they are,' said Cromwell calmly, 'then I shall change my
  policy.'</p>

  <p>'Thou art all of a fatalist,' remarked Harrison grimly; 'there is no
  ruffling thee.'</p>

  <p>The Lieutenant-General picked up his gloves and hat and riding-stock.</p>

  <p>'Can I alter God's decrees that I should fret because of them?' he
  answered earnestly. 'I am but the flail in the hand of the thresher. The
  Lord's will be done on me and on His Majesty, who are both the instruments of
  His unsearchable judgments on these lands.'</p>

  <p>He saluted the General respectfully, but left without further speech. He
  might call himself the instrument of the Lord; it was clear that he did not
  consider himself the instrument of Sir Thomas Fairfax.</p>

  <p>He seemed, indeed, quietly but fully conscious that he and he alone could
  move the army (which at present still held the balance of power), and that
  he, therefore, and no other, was become the arbiter of these realms.</p>

  <p>When he left the guard-room he sent his servant for his son-in-law, Henry
  Ireton, who soon joined him; the two mounted and, through the October sun,
  rode to Hampton Court.</p>

  <p>They exchanged little conversation on the way, partly because each
  thoroughly understood the other, and partly because their minds were full of
  busy thoughts.</p>

  <p>The King, who was still treated with formality and respect, with his own
  servants and his own friends about him, made no delay in seeing them. He had
  lately had several interviews with Cromwell, with Fairfax, with Ireton, and
  walking about Wolsey's groves and alleys had discussed with them, through
  more than one summer and autumn afternoon, the prospects before England.</p>

  <p>It was in the garden, in one of the beautiful walks of yellowing oak and
  beech that sloped to the river, that he received them now.</p>

  <p>As usual his manner was gentle and gracious, as usual he kept his seat (he
  was resting on a wooden bench) and did not uncover, though the two Generals
  doffed their hats; power still paid this respect to tradition.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' said Cromwell at once, 'I should have waited on you sooner, but I
  have been sick of an imposthume in the head. But now I am here I have weighty
  matters to say, and I would have Your Majesty give a keen ear to my
  words.'</p>

  <p>'Am I not ever,' said Charles, with a faint smile, 'attentive to your
  words?'</p>

  <p>'I know not,' replied Cromwell, with his plain outspokenness. 'I cannot
  read the heart of Your Majesty,' and he looked at him straightly.</p>

  <p>With the tip of his cane Charles disturbed the first little dead gold
  leaves which lay at his feet.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' he replied slowly, 'so you have weighty things to say?'</p>

  <p>He had long known that his conferences with the leaders of the army must
  come to a crisis and a plain issue soon; it had not been his purpose to force
  this moment until his plans were all smoothly arranged, but now he was ready
  enough. As usual he had his points clear, his feelings under command, as
  usual his manner was gentle, contained, courteous, his mind alert and
  watchful; yet there was a weariness in his face and voice that all his art
  could not disguise, as he came again to the old wretched business of speaking
  his enemies fair, as he once more engaged in the endless game of negotiation,
  proposal and counter-proposal, which he never intended should come to
  anything.</p>

  <p>The keen eyes of Commissary-General Ireton detected the shudder of
  reluctance, almost repulsion, which Charles so instantly repressed.</p>

  <p>'We will be short, Your Majesty,' he said, 'and it is not our intention to
  ask you for more audiences. The army doth not like our meeting. All must be
  settled in this coming together.'</p>

  <p>Charles glanced up at the two men standing before him as John Pym had
  stood before him once in another of his royal gardens&mdash;Pym was dead, but
  his principles were alive indeed; Charles thought that if the old Puritan was
  in any hell which allowed him a glimpse of the earth he must be grinning
  derisively at this scene now.</p>

  <p>'We have had,' said Cromwell, not waiting for Charles to speak,
  'conferences, rendezvous, councils of war, much running to and fro between
  the army and the Parliament, many talks between ourselves and Your Majesty.
  Surely this thing must come to an end. The country is without a government,
  and many extreme and fanatic men do seize the time to unsettle the mind of
  the vulgar with fierce, empty words.'</p>

  <p>He paused a moment, then added, looking at the King intently and openly,
  and speaking with almost mournful seriousness&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty knows what the country must have&mdash;are you prepared to
  grant us these desires?'</p>

  <p>Charles looked at him with a steadiness equal to his own.</p>

  <p>'And if I say I am?' he replied. 'What then?'</p>

  <p>Both men were speaking with a directness usually foreign to them.</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Cromwell, 'you may be in Whitehall within the week, sir. The
  army will escort you there.'</p>

  <p>Charles could hardly disguise the leap of exultation that shook his heart
  at this splendid chance, which, after being dangled before him so long, was
  at length definitely offered him.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' added the Lieutenant-General. 'I make no disguise from you that
  there are many in the army not of my mind&mdash;it is rumoured that Your
  Majesty hath secret dealings with the Scots, the French, the
  Dutch&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'If the English are loyal to me,' replied Charles, 'wherefore should I
  need foreign aid? These tales fly like thistle-down before the first autumn
  wind&mdash;when we are in London, sir, I will listen to, and satisfy, all
  demands.'</p>

  <p>'Is that a pledge?' demanded Cromwell. 'Is your Majesty sincere with
  me?'</p>

  <p>Charles rose.</p>

  <p>'What have I to gain by insincerity?' he said; and again his cane stirred
  the drifting shrivelled leaves.</p>

  <p>'And I must speak my side,' he added. 'It is my wish to show you that
  loyalty may bring more profit and honour than rebellion.'</p>

  <p>'What manner of profit?' asked Cromwell. 'If you mean personal profit,
  why, I am well enough.' ('Ay, with my Lord Worchester's lands,' thought
  Charles bitterly.) Two of my wenches are wed, my eldest son is settled, the
  younger making good progress, for my other little maids and their mother I
  can provide&mdash;what more should I want? For Henry Ireton I can say the
  same.'</p>

  <p>'Yet I can gild this honourable prosperity,' replied the King. 'When my
  Lord Essex died, his title&mdash;his title died with him&mdash;you, methinks,
  are of the first Earl's house&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried Cromwell sharply, and flushed all over his face and neck.</p>

  <p>'Oliver Cromwell may take the rank of Thomas Cromwell, who was also the
  terror and the help of a king,' continued Charles, with smiling lips and
  narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>The blood was still staining the Lieutenant-General's face; his forehead
  was crimson up to the thick brown hair; he looked on the ground in a fashion
  that was embarrassed, almost stricken.</p>

  <p>'I have not offered enough,' thought Charles; aloud he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>'When I am in Whitehall I will sign the patent, and then the Earl of Essex
  may command me to further service.'</p>

  <p>Still Cromwell did not speak.</p>

  <p>'Thou clod, dost thou not understand!' cried the King in his heart.</p>

  <p>He spoke again.</p>

  <p>And thy son-in-law, Henry Ireton here&mdash;he also I would
  raise&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Cromwell interrupted, but in a confused and stammering fashion.</p>

  <p>'Sir&mdash;you have mistaken&mdash;I am no cadet of the first Earl of
  Essex's family&mdash;nay&mdash;or so remote; it matters not&mdash;I never
  thought of it&mdash;this was not what I came to speak of&mdash;yet what I
  would have said is gone from me.' His head fell on his breast despondently;
  he made a hopeless little gesture with his gloved right hand.'Let it pass,'
  he finished.</p>

  <p>'For me,' said Henry Ireton, 'I would that Your Majesty had not spoken of
  this.'</p>

  <p>Charles could not keep all scorn from his smile as he replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>'We will discuss these things at Westminster.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell raised his head and gazed into the King's pale, composed
  face.</p>

  <p>'I do ask Your Majesty,' he said, and in his deep voice was a note of
  intense appeal, 'to be sincere with me.'</p>

  <p>'I am sincere with you, General Cromwell,' replied Charles.</p>

  <p>A light gust of wind shook the oak branches and more leaves drifted
  downwards.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow I will return with General Fairfax and some other officers,'
  said Cromwell, 'with whom Your Majesty may finally speak.' He seemed about to
  take his leave, hesitated, then, as if a sudden impulse had shaken him, he
  turned again and addressed Charles.</p>

  <p>'Not for my sake,' he said, 'nor for any light reason&mdash;but for thy
  soul's sake that when thou comest before the living God thou mayst have no
  treachery or falsehood in the scale against thee, deal fairly with me now.
  There thou shalt wear no crown to give thee courage, and no courtier shall
  flatter thee&mdash;therefore, sir, bethink thee, and tell me plainly if I may
  trust thee.'</p>

  <p>'I have said it,' replied Charles.</p>

  <p>For a second Cromwell was silent; then he and Ireton took a formal leave
  and left the Palace grounds.</p>

  <p>When they were mounted and clear of the iron gates and the stone lions,
  Ireton spoke.</p>

  <p>'Wilt thou put that man up in Whitehall again? See how his mind runs on
  little things&mdash;he did offer us bribes as if we were soldiers deserting
  for higher pay.'</p>

  <p>'That went to my soul,' replied Cromwell simply.</p>

  <p>'I thought he took me for an honest man&mdash;but it pleased the Lord to
  mortify me, and I must not murmur. As for the King&mdash;yea, I will put him
  on his heights again, for that is the only way to peace.'</p>

  <p>They rode silently until they came within sight of Putney, and there they
  were met by Major Harrison, who, riding, came out of the village and joined
  them at the village green.</p>

  <p>'News,' he said abruptly, with a grim smile and triumphant
  eyes&mdash;'news from "The Blue Boar."'</p>

  <p>'Ay?' replied Cromwell quietly.</p>

  <p>Harrison turned his horse about and rode beside the others; the three
  slowed to a walking pace.</p>

  <p>'You had not left the guard-room ten minutes,' said Harrison, 'before my
  man arrived from London, all in a reek. He had found and arrested the King's
  secret messenger, and out of his saddle ripped these'&mdash;he held up a
  packet of papers&mdash;'secret letters to the Queen,' he added triumphantly,
  'and as fatal as those papers captured after Naseby!'</p>

  <p>Ireton gave a passionate exclamation, but Cromwell said&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What is in them?'</p>

  <p>Much treason,' replied Harrison succinctly. 'He tells his wife he will
  never make a peace with either army or Parliament, that he is deluding both
  while he raises a force in Scotland and Ireland, in which countries Hamilton
  and Ormonde intrigue for him. He begs her to get a loan from the Pope to
  raise a foreign army&mdash;and he promises,' added Harrison dryly, 'that,
  when he hath his day again, those two rebels, Cromwell and Ireton, shall both
  be hanged.'</p>

  <p>'Doth he? doth he?' said Cromwell; he held out his hand and took the
  papers.</p>

  <p>One glance at their contents confirmed Ireton's summary&mdash;the whole
  was in the King's known hand.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell turned his horse and rode back to Hampton Court.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-04"
     id="ch3-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE KING AT BAY</h2>

  <p class="first">When Cromwell returned to the Palace the King had already
  gone to his supper.</p>

  <p>'I will wait,' said the Lieutenant-General; and in the little room with
  the linen-pattern carving in the grey-coloured walls, the portrait of Mary
  Tudor, the red lacquer desk, and the oriel window, where he had first spoken
  with Charles, he waited.</p>

  <p>Between his buff coat and his shirt lay the packet of papers ripped from
  the saddle of the secret messenger in the stables of 'The Blue
  Boar'&mdash;papers which Charles believed to be across the Channel by
  now.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell waited while nearly half an hour ticked away on the dial
  of the gilt bracket clock, and then came Lord Digby to say that His Majesty
  would not be disturbed again to-night; Charles had still the unconquerable
  pride of royalty; he would not be summoned to meet his enemies at any hour
  they chose to name; the state with which he was still surrounded perhaps
  deluded him into thinking he could behave as he had behaved at Whitehall.</p>

  <p>If so, the veil of his dignity was now rent in such a way that it could
  never be patched again; Cromwell, with a manner there was no mistaking, the
  manner of the master, repeated his demand for an instant audience of His
  Majesty.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby withdrew, and five minutes later the Puritan soldier was
  ushered into the old, now disused, state chamber of Henry VIII., hung with
  fine Flemish tapestries representing the 'Seven deadly Sins' and lit by
  mullioned windows looking on the Park.</p>

  <p>Charles was already there, walking up and down; he had changed his dress
  since Cromwell had left him, and now wore black velvet with cherry-coloured
  points and gold tags; his fingers played nervously with the long gold chain
  which thrice circled his chest.</p>

  <p>In the light, already slightly dim, of the large room, the grey look of
  his face and hair was more apparent; it was almost as if some faded carving
  had been joined to a living body, so extraordinarily lifeless and without
  light was that immobile face framed in the long, waving, colourless
  locks.</p>

  <p>But in the eyes, swollen and lined, an intense vitality gleamed; the dark
  pupils sparkled with force and emotion under the tired, drooping lids as
  Charles stopped in his pacing and turned about to face Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'I had not expected this,' he said, with a haughtiness which seemed to
  disguise some straining passion. 'What more have we to say, sir? Methought
  you were to come to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow might have been too late,' said Cromwell. He spoke in his usual
  quiet, almost melancholy, fashion; his heavy voice held the usual deep note,
  enthusiastic, mournful.</p>

  <p>'Too late for what?' asked Charles, still endeavouring to conciliate his
  powerful foe, and now, he hoped, ally, still barely able to conceal his angry
  pride at the lack of ceremony with which he was treated, the manner in which
  this man came before him, his great disgust and repulsion at having to deal
  with such fellows at all.</p>

  <p>'Get you gone to-night from Hampton, sir,' said Cromwell, 'to whatever
  place seems good&mdash;here you shall no longer be safe.'</p>

  <p>'Ah,' cried Charles, 'is this the end of all your wily advances? I am not
  safe!'</p>

  <p>Because I cannot protect you when what Major Harrison knows is spread
  abroad among the army.'</p>

  <p>The King's right hand left his chain; he pressed his fingers over his
  heart; on the black velvet they looked thin and white beyond nature.</p>

  <p>'The hand of God is against you,' said Cromwell sombrely. 'He does not
  mean that you shall again rule in this land. I would have made treaty with
  you as the Gibeonites made with David&mdash;and I would not ask from you the
  lives of seven, as they asked for the sons of Saul, but only your own word
  pledged openly. But you could not keep it, but dealt with the children of
  Belial and all the array of the ungodly.'</p>

  <p>Charles took one delicate step backwards.</p>

  <p>'These are mighty words,' he said.</p>

  <p>'They are mighty doings,' replied Cromwell. 'Not of mean things or small
  things or the things concerning one man or another am I speaking, but of
  great things, the displeasure of God on this wretched land, the means we must
  take to revoke His judgment...Much blood hath been shed,' he added, with a
  sudden flash in his voice, 'but not that which must be before we find
  peace.'</p>

  <p>'I know not of what you speak,' muttered the King.</p>

  <p>'You very well know,' replied Cromwell, and through the obscure web of his
  words a meaning of passion, of force and fire did gleam, like gold or flame.
  'You know what you have done. How you have deceived and gone crookedly. But
  God is not mocked. Hath He not said, "Though they dig into Hell thence shall
  mine hand take them, though they climb up into Heaven thence shall I pull
  them down? " And out of darkness and secrecy hath He revealed your designs
  that you may not bring more evil upon England.'</p>

  <p>'Of what dost thou accuse the King?' asked Charles.</p>

  <p>'Of high treason,' replied Cromwell&mdash;'of treason towards God and
  England.'</p>

  <p>A step further back moved Charles, so that his shoulders touched and
  ruffled the tapestry.</p>

  <p>'By what authority do you use this boldness?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'My authority is from within,' answered the Puritan. 'I can satisfy men of
  my authority. I am not afraid. I see that in treating with you I have
  committed folly, but that is over. God will find another way. Get from
  Hampton, under what excuse you may. I would not, sir, have the army do you a
  mischief.'</p>

  <p>'I will,' replied Charles, 'get as far as may be from the violence of
  insulting rebels&mdash;I will withdraw, myself from my subjects until they
  remember their duty to their King.'</p>

  <p>'In what way,' demanded Cromwell, 'hast thou fulfilled thy duty to God or
  to His people?'</p>

  <p>'I have endured much!' cried Charles, in a sharp voice. 'But till now I
  have been spared open insolence!'</p>

  <p>Unmoved and unblenching the Lieutenant-General regarded him.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he replied, 'you may yet hear worse words than any I have said, and
  may have to bear a rougher speech. I did not come to rail, but to tell you
  that I am now persuaded there can be no treaty or understanding between you
  and us. Sir, others advised me of this awhile ago, but I would not listen.
  But now the hand of God is plainly discoverable&mdash;your plots and
  subterfuges are revealed, sir, your secret letters to the Queen are
  known.'</p>

  <p>Charles, whose quick mind had been reviewing all the possible disasters
  that could have befallen, who had been wondering which of his intrigues had
  been unveiled, was not prepared for a catastrophe so complete as the
  discovery of his secret correspondence with his wife, which revealed, not
  one, but all of his complicated plots.</p>

  <p>As Cromwell told him at last the cause of his sudden estrangement, he felt
  at once a shock and a premonition chill his heart; he remembered quite
  clearly what had been in his last letter to the Queen, and the statement that
  he had made in his irritation and humiliation regarding Cromwell and Ireton,
  and he saw that another golden chance had gone, and that he had lost for ever
  the help of the army which he had sacrificed so much pride to gain.</p>

  <p>But he faced this misfortune as he had faced so many others, with
  unfailing courage and dignity.</p>

  <p>'You pretend to deal with me as your King,' he said, 'but you treat me as
  your prisoner. I am spied upon, and my very letters opened...There is no more
  to be said.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell did not deny the charge, as he might well have done, since Major
  Harrison, and not he, had tracked and arrested the King's messenger.</p>

  <p>'My hopes of you are dead,' he merely said. 'I would have you leave
  Hampton, for I know not what the army may do, and if they take you to
  Whitehall now, sir, it will not be as a king, but as a prisoner.'</p>

  <p>'I am well used to that treatment,' replied Charles, with hot bitterness,
  'nor have I looked for any other at the hands of rebellious fanatics. Didst
  thou think,' he added, with the full force of that fury and scorn he had so
  long concealed breaking the bounds of his fitful prudence and his steady
  courtesy, 'that <i>I</i> ever regarded <i>thee</i> as my friend?'</p>

  <p>'I would have been so, sincerely,' replied Cromwell, with his unruffled
  melancholy calm. 'I and Ireton risked our prestige with the army to make
  conferences and debates with you, but it hath been as if one should pour
  water into a sieve. I would have overlooked much&mdash;even the insult you
  put on me to-day when you tried to buy me with a feather for my cap, when I
  was offering myself to you with no thought but the good of this realm. So
  cheaply did you hold Pym, so cheaply will you always hold honest men, it
  seems&mdash;and I, sir, tell you plainly that I have done with you. I will
  find other ways. Not through you can peace come to England, I do now perceive
  it. "Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel." You must go on to your fate,
  sir, as I shall to mine; but look for no ally in me or in the army, for
  henceforth there can be no treaty between Your Majesty and us. My cousin,
  Colonel Whalley, shall remain here to look after your security; as for me,
  you shall not see me again, or in a manner very different. As for what may
  become of you or your estate, of that I wash my hands&mdash;the Lord deal
  with you.'</p>

  <p>'Amen,' said Charles sternly, 'and may He judge between you and me.
  Between me who have kept His ancient statutes and upheld His Church, and you
  who have defied and blasphemed both.'</p>

  <p>'God is neither in statutes nor in churches,' replied Cromwell, 'but in
  the innermost recesses of the spirits and the secret depths of the heart, and
  these sanctuaries have you polluted and defiled, with tyranny and falseness
  and sly and untruthful dealing.'</p>

  <p>He took a step towards the door; a sudden weariness seemed to have
  overtaken him, or a wave of the weakness from his recent illness; he looked,
  in his dusty clothes, like a rider beaten with fatigue, a traveller exhausted
  after a long journey, his chin sank on his linen collar; his broad shoulders
  were bowed, and his step was at once heavy and uncertain.</p>

  <p>Charles remained white, rigid in pose and expression as when Cromwell
  entered the chamber; the shadows were swiftly closing round them and all
  sharp lines and fine colours were blurred; through the one open window a
  breeze came, which lightly stirred the dusty tapestry and shook it in faint
  ripples from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>When he had reached the door, Cromwell turned and spoke again.</p>

  <p>'Thou hast, sir, lost as good a chance as we are ever like to get of a
  fair settlement, and lost it through falseness and folly.' He spoke with
  passion, but it was a passion of regret, not of vexation or wrath. 'A good
  night.'</p>

  <p>The King, without turning his head or moving, stood as if he dismissed an
  unwelcome suitor from an audience, he showed an indifference that was
  stronger than contempt and an insulting coolness and absence of passion.</p>

  <p>So, with no other word on either side, they parted, and Oliver rode back
  to Putney, weary with disappointment and chagrin, though his inmost
  prescience knew, and had known, that this disappointment and chagrin had been
  from the first foredoomed, that in ever dealing with the King at all he had
  been preparing the failure that had disclosed itself to-night; as he
  reflected on the whole business, his stern common sense laughed at the
  idealism which had led him astray; how could he have ever hoped to have
  clipped a king to <i>his</i> pattern out of Charles?</p>

  <p>The delusion was over; he asked himself, as he rode through the fresh
  autumn twilight, what was to take its place?</p>

  <p>If the King could not be trusted&mdash;what then? Some of the bold words
  of Thomas Harrison flashed into his mind. Must they, could they, do without a
  king at all?</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell did not think so; he was never a Republican; order and
  system were lovely to him, and both were involved, in his English heart, with
  the idea of a steadfast though constrained monarchy.</p>

  <p>In anything else (where, indeed, was the model for anything else to be
  found in Europe, save perhaps in the peculiar constitution, founded under
  peculiar circumstances, of the United Provinces?) he foresaw the elements of
  constant anarchy, constant revolution...</p>

  <p>Yet he had done with the King&mdash;finished with him with that complete
  definiteness of which his resolutions were supremely capable.</p>

  <p>So Cromwell strove with his thoughts during the short ride to Putney where
  all the chiefs of the army were already in conclave.</p>

  <p>Alone in the uncared-for splendour of another monarch the unhappy King
  stood, motionless, as his enemy had left him, and tried to measure the extent
  of his misfortune and to readjust his shattered plans.</p>

  <p>He was still, as ever, incredulous of his ultimate defeat, but never
  before had he been so utterly at a loss for present action. The army was lost
  to him, that was clear; neither the Scots nor the Parliament were ready to
  receive him, the Queen had not been able to raise the foreign army, his
  son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, had been prevented by the States-General
  from sending troops to his assistance, Ormonde could do nothing in
  Ireland&mdash;that country was indeed lost to the royal cause, since the
  miserable affair of the Earl of Glamorgan&mdash;and Hamilton seemed powerless
  to fight the Campbell faction at Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>'What shall I do?' muttered Charles. 'What shall I do?'</p>

  <p>His thoughts turned with even deeper longing than usual to the Queen in
  her exile; he believed that he might forsake everything and go to her; two
  things restrained him, sheer pride and the thought of his two children, the
  Princess Elisabeth and the Duke of Gloucester, who were in the hands of the
  Parliament and whom he would have to leave behind.</p>

  <p>The Duke of York had already escaped to France, but the figures of these
  little children rose up and restrained his flight.</p>

  <p>Besides, he must stand by his crown...but he would not stay at
  Hampton&mdash;his own enemy had warned him.</p>

  <p>But where to go&mdash;in all my three realms where to go?</p>

  <p>Several days he waited in his usual indecision, then, miserable, harassed,
  uncertain, torn by a thousand perplexities, he and his few companions crept
  one night down the back stairs, came out on to the riverside, and went forth
  aimlessly, with no plan nor purpose, with nothing but schemes as wild as
  will-o'-the-wisps to light the dimness and confusions of their future.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-05"
     id="ch3-05"></a>CHAPTER V. LIEUT.-GENERAL CROMWELL, REPUBLICAN</h2>

  <p class="first">In a room of the house where Oliver Cromwell had moved his
  family from Ely, a mansion in Drury Lane, one of the least pretentious in
  that fashionable street, but stately and comfortable, two women were sitting
  over the ruddy fire which lit and cheered the close of the short winter
  day.</p>

  <p>The contrast between them was as marked as any contrast could be, yet
  something in their personalities knit together and blended as if beneath
  their great differences there was an underlying likeness&mdash;the likeness
  of the same breed and birth.</p>

  <p>The elder lady was towards the close of life&mdash;eighty, perhaps, or
  more; her face and person were delicate, her lap full of delicate embroidery,
  out of which her fine fingers drew a fine needle and thread.</p>

  <p>She wore a grey tabinet gown; a white cap and white strings enclosed her
  fragile face, white linen enfolded her shoulders and bosom, and long white
  cuffs reached from her wrist to her elbow.</p>

  <p>A housewife's case and a small Bible hung by cords to her waist; she had
  nothing of gold or silver but her worn wedding ring, yet she gave the
  impression of something high and fine and aristocratic.</p>

  <p>She sat in a deep, cushioned chair with a hooded top; the failing light
  had baffled the eyes that were still so keen, and the needlework was dropped
  on her lap.</p>

  <p>At her feet, on a small footstool, sat her grandchild, she who had
  brightened the house at Ely with her balls of holly berries, her red ribbons,
  her laughter, and her songs, and who now brightened the finer town house when
  she visited there; she was no longer an inmate of her father's home, for,
  though only seventeen, Elisabeth was a year married and now Mrs.
  Claypole.</p>

  <p>Neither in dress nor manner was she a Puritan; her lavender-blue silk
  gown, flowing open on a lemon-coloured petticoat, her deep falling collar and
  cuffs of Flemish lace, the bow of rose colour at her breast and in her hair,
  her white sarcenet shoes with the silver buckles, the long ringlets which
  escaped the pearl comb and fell on her shoulders, even her piquant bright
  face, with eyes slightly languishing and mouth slightly wilful, seemed more
  to belong to the now exiled court of Henriette Marie than to the household of
  the leader of the Roundhead army.</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing frivolous in the appearance of Elisabeth Claypole;
  her prettiness had a pensive cast, her glance often a seriousness unusual for
  her age, and if she sometimes showed a pride, a vanity, or an impatience,
  impossible to her sweetly austere sister, Bridget Ireton, she was not less
  noble and pious, brave and good, and perhaps her deeper tenderness, her
  greater gaiety, her warmer love of life were not such sins in the eyes of the
  God whom she had always been taught to fear; yet sins her father called them,
  though he knew they made her lovable, though he found her sweeter than
  Bridget, who was gentle perfection.</p>

  <p>Sitting here now, in the closing day, with the firelight flushing her
  delicate clothes and her sensitive face, and the shadows encroaching on her
  hair, here, with the cheerful noises of London without and the cheerful
  atmosphere of home within, she talked to her grandmother of the one subject
  every one must talk of this wondrous winter&mdash;the King's bewildered
  flight from Hampton, his aimless two days' riding, his final turning to the
  Isle of Wight and giving himself up to the Governor there, Colonel Hammond,
  whom he had reason to believe was loyalist at heart.</p>

  <p>Yet here again the King had been, as ever, unfortunate; Robert Hammond,
  tempted at first to take the King where he wished, yet remained true to his
  trust, and the unhappy Stewart was again a prisoner, now at Carisbrooke, kept
  more strictly than before&mdash;and a portentous silence hung over the
  nation; English, Scots, Presbyterians, Independents, Parliamentarians, the
  army, the Royalists&mdash;all seemed waiting&mdash;'Waiting for what?' asked
  Elisabeth Claypole, voicing the question England was asking.</p>

  <p>'For the Lord to show His will towards this poor kingdom,' said Mrs.
  Cromwell simply. 'Surely He will dispose it all to mercy.'</p>

  <p>'Mercy?' repeated the young girl thoughtfully. I see little mercy abroad.
  Much blood and bitterness&mdash;but no mercy.'</p>

  <p>'At least,' said the old gentlewoman composedly, His Majesty is mewed up,
  and that should be a step towards the settlement of these tangled
  affairs.'</p>

  <p>'Alas, poor King!' murmured the youngest Elisabeth (it was her mother and
  her grandmother's name). 'Alas! alas!'</p>

  <p>'Why dost thou say alas?' asked Mrs. Cromwell calmly. 'Dost thou not
  recall what thy father said in the House the other day when he moved that no
  more addresses should be sent to the King, nor any dealings made with him,
  under pain of high treason? He put his hand on his sword, thy father did, and
  he said, quoting Holy Writ&mdash;"Thou shalt not suffer a hypocrite to
  reign&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'He said not so much a month ago,' replied Elisabeth; 'then he was all for
  a good peace with His Majesty, saying&mdash;how could any man come quietly to
  his own save by that?'</p>

  <p>'Thou knowest,' returned the old lady, who had much of the strength and
  melancholy of her son in her calm demeanour, that all that is changed.'</p>

  <p>'Will there be another war?' murmured Elisabeth Claypole, looking dreamily
  into the fire.</p>

  <p>'That is a matter for men...Be not so grave, dear heart, the Lord hath us
  all in His keeping.'</p>

  <p>'My father,' replied the girl, 'hath been grave of late&mdash;during all
  my visit. He thinketh affairs are dark, I believe.'</p>

  <p>'Not only affairs of the kingdom weigh on him, Elisabeth&mdash;something
  his own do oppress him. The Parliament settlements are yet indefinite, and
  then there is your brother Richard's marriage. It does not please your father
  that he should be so deep in love as to leave the Life Guards. And then this
  Dorothea Mayor's father requireth settlements, hard for your father to give
  as things now stand&mdash;all this weighs with him and puts him in anxieties
  and silences.'</p>

  <p>At the end of this speech, Mrs. Cromwell, either exhausted from so many
  words or from the thoughts her own explanation had conjured up, sighed and
  leant back in her chair, dropping her chin on the immaculate whiteness of her
  cambric bosom, as her son would sink his on his breast when he was thoughtful
  or oppressed.</p>

  <p>'Richard,' said Elisabth Claypole in that soft, eager voice which was
  always ready to plead for and to praise every one, 'is not suited for the
  army&mdash;he never cared for it.'</p>

  <p>'Cannot you see,' replied Elisabeth Cromwell almost sharply, 'what a
  disappointment that is for your father?'</p>

  <p>'He loveth Oliver,' whispered Oliver's sister, and her eyes swam in tears.
  'Oliver would have been a good soldier.'</p>

  <p>'He loved Robert more,' returned the grandmother. 'Robert was the first
  born. His eldest son. Richard could never be as either Robert or Oliver to
  him; yet he will be loving and just to Richard.' That sense of the presence
  of the dead that the hushed mention of them seemed to so often evoke, as if
  they were never far, and at the sound of love and regret hovered near, filled
  the darkening room. Both the grandmother and sister seemed to see the bright
  ardent figure of the young cornet, whose life had burst forth so fiercely
  into action amid the whirling events of war, and had been stilled so suddenly
  by a hideous disease in an insignificant garrison, and was now forgotten save
  by these one or two who had loved him.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole remembered; she remembered his excitement, their
  mother's instructions, the cordials and balms he had taken with him, the fine
  shirts she had helped stitch and pack, his new sword that had looked so big
  to her childish eyes&mdash;the farewells&mdash;the letters...</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell remembered; she remembered his farewell visit, how she
  had blessed him and he had knelt before her with her hand on his smooth fair
  head...and his tallness and straightness and slenderness, and all his bright
  new bravery of war array...</p>

  <p>'Ah well,' she said softly. 'Ah well,' and her mind wandered off to her
  own youth, and it seemed to her as if she had indeed been living a long
  time...almost too long.</p>

  <p>'Light the candles, my love, my dear,' she said. 'It is sad to sit in the
  dark.'</p>

  <p>As her granddaughter rose, the door opened and Oliver Cromwell
  entered.</p>

  <p>His coming was a surprise; he was not now often in London, save when he
  had to speak at Westminster. He had lately been at Hereford, and they had not
  expected his return so soon.</p>

  <p>The sincere warmth of his welcome might have pleased any man, however
  weary, and his gravity lifted under it for a while, but when he had kissed
  them both and come to the fire and warmed his hands, silence came over him,
  as if the melancholy had closed over and clouded him again. His mother, from
  her hooded chair, gazed at his powerful, yet drooping figure, and the
  presence of the younger Oliver seemed more insistent.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole had gone to fetch the candles.</p>

  <p>'We were speaking of Oliver,' said Mrs. Cromwell.</p>

  <p>Her son turned to look down at her.</p>

  <p>'He is with the Lord,' he answered gravely. 'He was a man&mdash;and took a
  man's fate doing man's work.'</p>

  <p>A little fall of silence, then Cromwell spoke again&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Do you think of Robert sometimes, mother?'</p>

  <p>'I knew, I knew,' murmured the old gentlewoman. 'He was your love.'</p>

  <p>'He was a child,' replied Cromwell, with infinite tenderness, with
  infinite regret. 'A little, useless child. Dying so, he remains a
  child&mdash;never higher than my shoulder. My eldest born. Oliver laughed
  when he did go, for joy to die in God's service, but Robert wept. Ay, they at
  Felsted told me he wept because I was not there to take his hand in the
  sharpness of his passing. Oh, that went to my heart, my innermost heart...but
  God saved me.'</p>

  <p>The young Elisabeth returned, followed by the servant with the two
  branched candlesticks of brass which stood on the black polished table, where
  they reflected their full shining length.</p>

  <p>With a shudder the Lieutenant-General roused himself and turned to face
  the room.</p>

  <p>'What hast thou been doing?' asked Elisabeth Claypole when the maid had
  gone.</p>

  <p>'It would not please thee to know,' he answered sombrely.</p>

  <p>Now the room was lit she noticed his pallor, his heavy air.</p>

  <p>'Thou art tired, father,' she cried.</p>

  <p>'Ay&mdash;tired&mdash;tired&mdash;bring me a glass of wine, dearest.' He
  turned round again to the fire and said abruptly, 'There bath been a mutiny
  in the army. A rebellious meeting at Corkbush field&mdash;these levellers it
  was&mdash;but I did stamp it out; we must have no disaffection in the
  army.'</p>

  <p>'A meeting?' exclaimed his daughter, taking a bell-mouthed glass from the
  sideboard; 'but it is ended&mdash;how?'</p>

  <p>'They drew lots,' replied Cromwell, 'and one was shot. One Arnald&mdash;a
  brave man.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, father!' cried Mrs. Claypole. 'More blood&mdash;more misery!'</p>

  <p>'It had to be,' said Cromwell. Dost thou think I love it?' He made an
  effort to slake off his preoccupation and his gloom. 'Come, come, this is no
  news for thee.'</p>

  <p>He turned again to gaze very tenderly at her as she came with wine on a
  silver salver.</p>

  <p>'Oh, vanity and carnal mind!' he cried, pulling at the ribbons on her
  sleeve; 'thy sister Ireton doth think that thou art too much given to
  worldliness! Yet seek ye the Lord and ye shall find Him,' he added, with a
  sudden grave smile.</p>

  <p>'Sir, I would,' she replied earnestly. 'Let not my ways deceive you, I am
  very humble at heart.'</p>

  <p>'I do believe it,' he said.</p>

  <p>He drank his wine slowly. He asked where his wife was (he had learnt below
  that she was abroad), and was told that she was with Lady Wharton.</p>

  <p>'She did not expect me,' he said half-wistfully. 'I wish that I had
  chanced to find her. Since I am so much away I would have all round me when I
  am at home.'</p>

  <p>'She will be in soon,' said his mother, gathering up her fine sewing with
  an air of regret, for the candlelight was not strong enough for her to see
  the minute stitches.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth crept up to her father, and taking his sword hand, caressed
  it.</p>

  <p>'What of the King?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'The King is at Carisbrooke,' he replied.</p>

  <p>She gave a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>'How will it end, my father?'</p>

  <p>'How should we have that knowledge yet?'</p>

  <p>'The poor King!' she exclaimed. I am sorry for the poor King!'</p>

  <p>Cromwell was silent.</p>

  <p>'Tell me,' said Elisabeth, creeping closer to him, 'will there be another
  war?'</p>

  <p>'God forfend,' he answered gravely.</p>

  <p>'Then what will the King do?' she insisted.</p>

  <p>'Thou art very tender towards the King.'</p>

  <p>'I am sorry for him, surely. And I have heard thee say&mdash;he must have
  his rights again.'</p>

  <p>'He hath forfeited his rights,' said Cromwell, glooming. 'He is a
  hypocrite.'</p>

  <p>'Once you were his friend,' said Elisabeth Claypole; 'is that over? Why,
  Major Harrison even called you royalist.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it is over,' returned her father, 'and now you may sooner call me
  republican&mdash;a name I did use to hate. The King is not one to be trusted,
  neither is he fortunate. God is against him, and will not have him raised up
  again; even as the Lord's judgment went forth against Tyrus, so hath it gone
  forth against Charles Stewart. What hath God said&mdash;"I shall bring thee
  down with them that descend to the pit&mdash;and thou shalt be no
  more&mdash;thou shalt be sought for, but never shalt thou be found!"'</p>

  <p>'But what wilt thou do with the tyrant?' asked Mrs. Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'He is not my prisoner, nor am I his judge,' replied Cromwell, with sudden
  vehemence. 'Ask <i>me</i> not what his fate will be! Ask me not to pity the
  King&mdash;"he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity, and the rod of his
  anger shall fail."'</p>

  <p>He crossed to the sideboard and set his glass there.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole stood sad and thoughtful by her grandmother's chair;
  Cromwell came and kissed her delicate forehead.</p>

  <p>'Thy brother's marriage treaty sticks,' he said pleasantly. 'I must go and
  write to Mr. Mayor, and cast up what higher settlements I can offer.'</p>

  <p>'He demands too much,' declared Mrs. Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'Nay, he is prudent; but I have two wenches still to provide
  for&mdash;farewell for a moment.' He had gone again.</p>

  <p>'The affairs of men!' muttered the old gentlewoman. 'Well, well.'</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole, too, felt sad; she, too, felt helpless in a busy world
  that did not need her. She returned to her stool and began to fold up her
  grandmother's work; both of them, being women, were used to loneliness.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3-06"
     id="ch3-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. PRESTON ROUT</h2>

  <p class="first">Charles was a prisoner at Carisbrooke, more strictly guarded
  than ever before, but not any less dangerous to Parliament or the disrupting
  forces which stood for Parliament. In spite of everything they still tried to
  come to an agreement with him, for the confusion of the kingdom was beyond
  words, beyond any one man's brain to grasp and cope with, and all turned to
  the King and the tradition behind the King as the one stable thing in a whirl
  of chaos.</p>

  <p>Charles thought that they, traitors and rebels as they were, were speeding
  to their own doom. Outwardly he played with them as he had done before; he
  referred himself, he said, wholly to them. Meanwhile he was sowing the seeds
  of another Civil War.</p>

  <p>He had come to an agreement with the Scots whereby they were to unite with
  the English royalists against the Parliament, and he on his side was to
  suppress Sectaries and Independents and to establish presbytery for three
  years, himself retaining the Anglican form of worship. This agreement was
  signed secretly, wrapped in lead, and buried in the garden of Carisbrooke
  Castle.</p>

  <p>Royalist risings broke out all over the country, particularly in Wales;
  mutinies were frequent in the still undisbanded, unpaid army; the struggle
  between Presbyterian and Independent was as sharp as it had ever been.
  Hamilton triumphed over the Argyll faction in the Scottish Parliament, raised
  an army 40,000 strong, and prepared to march across the Border 'to deliver
  the King from Sectaries.' Part of the fleet had revolted, gone to Holland,
  fetched the young Prince of Wales and Rupert, and was buccaneering round
  Yarmouth Roads. In Ireland the Marquess of Ormonde and the papal Nuncio were
  coming to some pact to unite against the Parliament, and the feeling of the
  sheer people of England was veering against the austere rule of the Puritan
  and coming again to the old known and tried idea of Kingship. 'Why not,' they
  asked, 'a good peace with His Majesty?'</p>

  <p>Cromwell and a few others knew why not; because the King was utterly
  impossible to deal with; because he did not admit that he, the King,
  <i>could</i> be dealt with, made party to a bargain or an agreement, like an
  ordinary man.</p>

  <p>But in the minds of the common people, Charles did not get the blame nor
  they the credit of this attitude of his. Cromwell in particular had lost much
  of his prestige; the zealots blamed him for his conferences with the King,
  the moderates because they had not succeeded. He brought about meetings
  between the leaders of the two factions, Presbyterians and Independents, but
  quite uselessly&mdash;neither would yield a jot. Then the extreme men of the
  Parliament and the extreme men of the army were gotten together by his care
  to discuss the desperate state of affairs.</p>

  <p>This conference resolved itself into a bitter and academic dispute on the
  various forms of government, each man backing himself by manifold quotations
  from Scripture.</p>

  <p>'Wherefore,' cried Cromwell, starting up impatiently, .'do you argue which
  is best&mdash;monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy&mdash;when you are come
  here to find a remedy for the present evils?'</p>

  <p>Thereat they began to reply together, tediously and idly, and Cromwell
  picked up the cushion from the chair on which he sat and hurled it at
  Ludlow's head, and before it could be flung back to him he ran down the
  stairs, thus ending the conference.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the army came together at Windsor and, with prayers and tears
  and exhortations, besought God to tell them for what mistreading or fault all
  these turmoils and distresses had come upon them.</p>

  <p>And the conclusion of these three days of mystic exaltation was that God
  was punishing them for their dealings with Charles Stewart, who was
  henceforth to be no more considered or dealt with, but treated as a
  delinquent and man of blood who would be, in good time, made to answer for
  his sins to men before he went to answer for them to God.</p>

  <p>The situation was a paradox. The Scots were invading the kingdom to
  restore Charles and to force the Covenant on England; these two matters were
  no less the object of the parliamentary majority, yet they were bound to
  withstand Hamilton, for his victory would mean their own utter overthrow.</p>

  <p>To further complicate the situation, Langdale and the English Cavaliers,
  joined with Hamilton, abhorred the Covenant, and were fighting not merely for
  the re-establishment of the monarchy but the re-establishment of the Church
  of England.</p>

  <p>It was obvious, even to the most hopeful, that only the sword could cut
  these tangles; it was obvious, even to the most hesitating, that the Scots
  must be driven back over their own Border.</p>

  <p>Cromwell, who had been on the edge of impeachment, who had many eager foes
  now in Parliament and army, was called forth again at the supreme moment.</p>

  <p>He was sent to South Wales, crushed the rebellion there, took Pembroke
  Castle, heard Hamilton had crossed the Border, turned northwards and, by
  July, was in Leicestershire. By the middle of August he had joined General
  Lambert between Leeds and York.</p>

  <p>There his scouts brought him news that Hamilton and Langdale had effected
  a juncture and were marching for London.</p>

  <p>'If,' said Cromwell, 'they reach London, then good night to us, for the
  King will be master for all in all, and all the blood and bitterness will
  have been for naught.'</p>

  <p>There was nothing but him and his force to stay them. He had, perhaps,
  eight thousand men; they, twenty-one thousand, or near it. The weather was
  tumultuous, stormy; torrents of rain fell, the upland fells were almost
  impassable from mud and bog. Cromwell had brought his army by long and
  arduous marches from Wales; many of them were barefoot, many in rags. None of
  them had yet received the months of arrears of pay which had been so long in
  dispute. Plunder was forbidden them; they were there, like the hosts of
  Joshua, to fight for the Lord, and for nothing else.</p>

  <p>My Lord Duke, with his great straggling army, came over the open heaths as
  far as Preston and Wigan, no colours displayed because of the wind, no tents
  nor fires at night because of the wind and the rain; so they marched, a weary
  troop, neither well-disciplined nor well-generaled, and soon to face those
  troops which Oliver Cromwell had made the best in the world. But there was
  with them neither hesitation nor dismay, for half of them were Scots, and
  Langdale's men were of the same breed as Cromwell's, and would fight as well
  and endure as stubbornly.</p>

  <p>Cromwell came to Clitheroe and lay in the house of a Mr. Sherburn, a
  Papist, at Stonyhurst. The next day was Wednesday, and still raining; the
  weather, the soldiers said, 'was as fearful a marvel as the hideous sight of
  English fighting English on English earth'; the sky was one colour with
  earth, heavy, dun; the beaten heath, the broken bushes dripped with moisture,
  the water ran in rivulets through the soaked earth. As the rain ceased for a
  while the wind would rise, sweeping strongly across the open spaces.</p>

  <p>Ashton marched to Whalley, other troops of dragoons to Clitheroe, Cromwell
  advanced towards Preston. On the other side my Lord Duke advanced, also,
  hardly knowing where, in the rain and wind, on the undulating ground of
  hillocks and hollows, his army lay, or how and where it was available.</p>

  <p>Sir Marmaduke Langdale was near Langdridge Chapel, on Preston Moor, the
  other side the Ribble. Four miles away my Lord the Duke, who was at Darwen,
  the south side of the river too, where there should have been a ford, but was
  not, so swollen was the tide with the mighty rains. My Lord Duke passed the
  bridge with most of his brigades and sent Lord Middleton with a large portion
  of the cavalry to Wigan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, through the rain and the confusion, stumbling over the
  incredibly rough ground, a forlorn of horse and foot, commanded by Major
  Hodgson and Major Rounal, came upon Sir Marmaduke and his three thousand
  English.</p>

  <p>The Scots, themselves confused, thinking it only an attack of Lancaster
  Presbyterians, did not support Langdale, who complained that he had not even
  enough powder; but he fought, he and his men, like heroes, against forces
  more than double their number&mdash;against the Ironsides, for four hours,
  always in the wind and wet, on the rough ground. Then such as was left of
  them gave way and fell back on Preston; some of the infantry surrendered,
  some of the horse escaped north to join Munro.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cromwell had swept Hamilton and Baillie back across the Darwen,
  back across the Ribble, had captured both bridges and driven my lord towards
  Preston town. Three times in his retreat my lord turned round to face his
  enemies, crying out for 'King Charles!' Three times he repulsed the troops
  pursuing him, and the third time he drove them far back and, escaping from
  them, swam the river and joined Lieutenant-General Baillie where he had
  enclosed himself on the top of a hill.</p>

  <p>Night fell and the battle was stayed; all were wet, weary, hungry,
  haggled; the Parliamentarians, the victor's, not the less exhausted, but with
  fire in their hearts and hymns of praise on their lips. Cromwell wrote to
  'the Committee of Lancashire sitting at Manchester' his account of the day's
  fight, dispatched it, prayed, and got into the saddle again.</p>

  <p>It was still foul weather, wind, rain, miles of muddy heath, hillocks,
  hollows now stained with blood and scattered with bodies, men, and horses,
  dead and dying.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Hamilton's forces fought all that day and the next, routed
  again and again, rallied again and again; always the rain, the wind, the
  muddy heath, the low clouds, always the soldiers growing fainter and wearier.
  Beaten from the bridge of Ribble, falling back, a drumless march on Wigan
  Moor, leaving the ammunition to the enemy, falling farther back on to Wigan
  town, where they thought to make some stand, but decided not to, with
  skirmishes of detachments at Redbank where the Scots nearly worsted Colonel
  Pride at Ribble Bridge, and where Middleton (the weather, always foul,
  bringing confusion and fatigue) missed his chief, coming too late. And so it
  went for three days on the wet Yorkshire heaths, till finally it was over;
  the fate of King, Church, Constitution, and Covenant was decided. Hamilton
  and the vanguard of horse rode wearily and aimlessly towards Uttoxeter; Munro
  and the rearguard straggled back to their own country; a thousand of them
  were left dead under the rain, trodden into the bloody heath; three thousand
  of them were made prisoners. And the second Civil War which had flamed up so
  suddenly and so fiercely was ended.</p>

  <p>The Puritans&mdash;the patriots&mdash;had passed through their darkest
  hour triumphantly; their ragged, hungry, unpaid soldiers, fighting truly for
  God and not for pay, had again saved England from the return of the tyrant
  and his manifold oppressions and confusions.</p>

  <p>After the three days' fight was over, Cromwell sat down at Warrington to
  write to the Speaker of the House of Commons a long account of the rout.</p>

  <p>'The Duke,' he wrote, 'is marching with his remaining horse towards
  Namptwich...If I had a thousand horse that could but trot thirty miles, I
  should not doubt but to give a very good account of them; but truly we are so
  harassed and haggled out in this business, that we are not able to do more
  than walk at an easy pace after them.'</p>

  <p>But whether or no the Puritans were too wearied to pursue their enemies
  mattered little; the day was decided.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Hamilton, wandering vaguely, with fewer and fewer men after
  him, was finally taken at Uttoxeter, where he surrendered, a sick and broken
  man.</p>

  <p>Cromwell cleared the Border of the remnants of the Scots, retook Berwick
  and Carlisle, engaged the Argyll faction, now the head of the Government of
  Scotland, to exclude all royalists from power, and turned back towards
  England, the foremost man of the moment again, and in the eyes of at least
  half England, the saviour of the country from the invader.</p>

  <p>But if the country was grateful, the Parliament was not. Denzil Holles,
  fiercest of Presbyterians, rose up at Westminster to lead a party against his
  enemy Cromwell. The Lords, who had all become royalists, considered whether
  they should impeach the victorious general; it was noticeable how much bolder
  they all were when the Independents and their indomitable leader were absent,
  and how, as the return of the army, strengthened in renown and prestige, drew
  nearer, they began to cast round for some means of escape from the fact
  facing them, that when Cromwell reappeared at Westminster he would be
  absolute master of the political situation, for he had behind him the entire
  army and they had nothing but the mere unsupported weight of the law.</p>

  <p>So sharp was the division and so fierce had party hatred become, that the
  Presbyterians at Westminster hated the Independents with the army as no
  Roundhead or Cavalier had ever hated in the first broad division of the
  war.</p>

  <p>Toleration was the watchword of Cromwell and his followers, and no word
  was more detestable to the Parliament. To mark their loathing of it they
  passed an ordinance punishing Atheism, Arianism, Socinianism, Quakerism,
  Arminianism, and Baptists with death.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cromwell, looming ever larger in the imaginations of men, was
  returning triumphant to London. If his fame had been at the lowest when he
  left for Wales, it was at the highest now. Denzil Holles conceived the idea
  of meeting material force by moral force; as they had nothing else to oppose
  to Cromwell they must oppose the King. Charles still remained, in many ways,
  the hub of the political wheel.</p>

  <p>The Parliament must now yield either to him or to the army; they thought
  they saw their chance with Charles. If terms could be come to with him, and
  he be installed in London before the army returned, Cromwell would be faced
  with a situation with which he would probably not be able to cope. <i>He</i>
  had denounced the King solemnly at the Windsor meeting, therefore Charles,
  once again in power, could not treat him otherwise than as any enemy.</p>

  <p>The vote against further addresses to the King, which Cromwell's eloquence
  had hurried through the House, was repealed, and parliamentary commissions
  were sent to the Isle of Wight to open a new treaty with the King.</p>

  <p>But they were not prepared to make concessions; the propositions of
  Uxbridge, of Newcastle, of Oxford, of Hampton Court were offered again and
  again, fought inch by inch. Charles, too, was still as intractable as ever;
  the coalition between royalist and Presbyterian seemed doomed to failure; the
  negotiations were continually ruptured on the subject of Church government.
  Charles would not forgo his bishops, and the Parliament would not endure
  them; though each side was desperate, on this point they were firm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cromwell and his Ironsides were coming nearer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-07"
     id="ch3-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. THE CONSTANCY OF THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">The fifteen commissioners had left the King; Sir Harry Vane,
  perhaps the sincerest republican of all, had stayed behind a moment to
  entreat Charles&mdash;as Pym&mdash;as Cromwell&mdash;had entreated
  him&mdash;'to be sincere.'</p>

  <p>The King, grave, composed, courtly, had answered him as he had answered
  Pym and Cromwell&mdash;'In all these dealings I have been sincere.'</p>

  <p>And so they left him, and the wearisome yet desperate negotiations, which
  had been protracted from the middle of the September after Preston Rout to
  nearly the end of November, were over.</p>

  <p>Charles had given way; he had consented to the temporary abolition of the
  bishops, for three years at least; the coalition of Royalist and Presbyterian
  was formed against Cromwell and the army; the treaty which made a third Civil
  War imminent was signed.</p>

  <p>After the Commissioners had departed, Lord Digby came to Charles, who
  still sat at the head of the table at which he had so often held his own in
  caustic argument and learned dispute on the subject of Episcopacy.</p>

  <p>'Bring me,' said the King, 'a little wine.'</p>

  <p>Lord Digby, without calling a servant, served the King himself.</p>

  <p>The winter twilight was falling; the sea fog drifting over the island
  thickened the sad atmosphere that filled the room in which the King sat. A
  private house at Newport had been for some weeks now his residence, and
  carried with it less state, but more semblance of freedom, than Carisbrooke
  Castle.</p>

  <p>The King wore grey. Since his own servants had been taken from him he had
  grown more and more neglectful of his attire; there was nothing either fine
  or splendid in his garments, and he wore no jewels. His face showed a more
  cheerful expression than had been of late usual to him, and when he had drunk
  the alicant, a faint colour came into his cheeks and a sparkle to his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>'Digby,' he said, 'I think I shall yet be able to undo these rogues, these
  traitors, these villains&mdash;but come, I must write to my Lord Ormonde, for
  I have had to publicly give orders that he is to do nothing in Ireland, and
  he may be misled.'</p>

  <p>To most these words, the first he had spoken since he had assured Sir
  Harry Vane of his sincerity, would have appeared indeed startling and
  ironical, but Lord Digby knew the whole of his master's tortuous intrigues.
  He was aware that from the moment the negotiations with the Parliament began,
  Charles had been planning to escape from the Isle of Wight, and join that
  portion of the navy which was now under the command of Rupert and the Prince
  of Wales, and thus make a descent on Ireland, where the incredible exertions
  of the Marquess of Ormonde kept alive a royalist party, and from there
  attempt another such invasion of England as had just ended so fatally at
  Preston Rout.</p>

  <p>Such was the wild, vague, and desperate scheme which the King nursed in
  preference to returning triumphantly to London as the ally of the Parliament,
  and from there dealing with the army, now his open enemies.</p>

  <p>But this, though it might seem the surest proof of his levity and falsity,
  was in reality the uttermost testimony he could give of his constancy to
  principles which he accounted Divine.</p>

  <p>The price the Parliament asked was the sacrifice of Episcopacy, and that
  was what Charles would never consent to. Far preferable was the wild hazard,
  the desperate risk, the almost certain danger of trusting to Rupert and his
  lawless little fleet, or Ormonde and his inadequate forces, or Ireland and
  her uncertain loyalty, than keeping the pact with the Presbyterian, who
  refused the Divine form of Church government.</p>

  <p>Now, almost before the commissioners had entered their coaches, he was
  hurriedly writing to Ormonde and to the Queen.</p>

  <p>'Do not be astonished at any concession I may make,' he wrote to the
  Marquess, for it will come to nothing, and heed no public commands I may
  give, until you hear that I am free; but keep alive with all vigour the
  spirit of loyalty in Ireland.'</p>

  <p>To his wife he wrote&mdash;'The great concessions I have made to-day were
  merely in order to [assist] my escape.'</p>

  <p>When these hasty letters, in the writing of which the King seemed to
  relieve some of the feelings that he had had to contain in his bosom during
  the long hours of his conference with the representatives of Parliament, were
  finished and locked into the secret drawers of the King's desk, Lord Digby
  lit the candles and closed the shutters over the mournful, wet, misty
  night.</p>

  <p>'I would, sir,' he said, with a little shudder, 'that we were well out of
  this cursed island.'</p>

  <p>Charles rose from the little desk; his eyes were brilliant, his mouth
  hardly set under the delicate moustaches.</p>

  <p>'If I were once in Ireland,' he said, 'fortune would look differently on
  me.'</p>

  <p>He had always been so&mdash;always, under the most cruel mortification
  hopeful, trustful in some expedient. Ever since his overthrow he had trusted
  first in Rupert and Montrose, then in the foreign armies the Queen would
  raise, then in Hamilton, then in the divisions of his enemies, and now in
  Rupert and his elusive ships.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby could not fail to see this incurable hopefulness of his master,
  nor to argue ill from it; but he was himself light-spirited and fantastical,
  and his remonstrances were few and faint.</p>

  <p>Yet he hazarded one now.</p>

  <p>'As the army is deadly disloyal and much raised up of late, and as the
  Parliament is your one sure refuge from it, sir, would it not be wiser to
  observe this treaty, at least for a while?'</p>

  <p>'Never!' cried Charles fiercely, 'Never will I yield! I have sworn that I
  will defend the Church of England and my rights&mdash;even unto death. I will
  not deal with these rebels save by the sword. The sword? Nay, the halter. I
  hope, Digby, that God will give me the day when I can see these rogues
  marched to Tyburn. Thou canst scarcely conceive,' he added, with great
  intensity, 'what a hatred I have for them&mdash;how my mortifications, my
  humiliations, my losses, all the loyal blood shed for me cry out for
  repayment! How I loathe them and their heretical opinions and their canting
  speech&mdash;how I detest them for mine own helplessness!'</p>

  <p>He flung himself into the arm-chair beside the hearth, where a feeble fire
  burnt neglected.</p>

  <p>'Hamilton's a prisoner,' he said gloomily. 'What will they do with my
  faithful lord? How many noble lives have I not to avenge?'</p>

  <p>As he spoke he thought (as he thought often now, too often for his own
  peace) of Strafford, his first great, awful, and useless sacrifice.</p>

  <p>'If it cost my heart's blood I will not submit,' he muttered, biting his
  lip.</p>

  <p>But Lord Digby would not so easily relinquish his point&mdash;that the
  Parliament was a surer refuge from the army than Rupert or Ormonde, or any
  possible ships or possible men either of these Cavaliers might be able to
  command.</p>

  <p>'Fairfax,' he reminded the King, 'sent Ireton to the House with a
  remonstrance from the army, protesting against the Parliament dealing with
  Your Majesty, and even daring to say that you should be brought to
  trial.'</p>

  <p>'But the House,' replied the King, with a grim smile, 'refused to consider
  these demands of "armed sectaries."</p>

  <p>But the army,' persisted Lord Digby, hath the power.'</p>

  <p>'I will be free of all of them,' cried Charles passionately. 'Of the army,
  of the Parliament, of all their cursed acts and heresies.'</p>

  <p>He lapsed into a melancholy silence again. My lord put another log on the
  fire and stirred the faint flames to a blaze.</p>

  <p>'In the Queen's letter of this morning,' said Charles suddenly, 'she
  mentioned that loyal gentlewoman, Margaret Lucas&mdash;she hath fallen ill.
  When she had the news of the end of her brother, Sir Charles, she was as one
  who had received a death-sentence.'</p>

  <p>Tears moistened his own eyes. He was not usually very sensible of the
  sorrows of those who were ruined in his service, and gratitude was no part of
  his character or tradition; yet there was something in the story of the
  gallant young Lucas, who, after an heroic defence of Colchester, had
  surrendered on terms which bargained for quarter for the inferiors, but left
  the superiors at the mercy of the enemy, yet who had been taken out with his
  fellow-officer, Sir George Lisle, and shot like a dog before those walls he
  had so valiantly defended through three months of famine and misery, which
  moved the King, even to tears.</p>

  <p>'Ireton's doing,' he cried. 'Jesus God! grant that I may send Ireton to
  Tyburn one day.'</p>

  <p>'From an officer who came here recently I heard an account of it,' said
  Lord Digby, in a low voice, 'They neither of them thought to have died,
  seeing they had surrendered to mercy, but they made no grief of it. Sir
  Charles was shot first, and Sir George bent and kissed him while he was yet
  warm (and conscious, I hope) and spoke to the wretched rebels, "Come nearer
  and make sure of me." And upon one of the dogs replying, "I warrant you we
  shall hit you, Sir George," he smiled and said, "Ay! but I have been nearer
  to you, many a time, my friends, and you have missed me,&mdash;I would I had
  been there to give them company."'</p>

  <p>'And they are gone!' sighed Charles. 'How many of the young and brave have
  I not lost! Ah, Digby, mine hath been a dismal fate, to ruin all those I
  would most advance, to bring down those whom I would most exalt.'</p>

  <p>He was not thinking now of Sir Charles Lucas, but of the Queen; his
  thoughts were never long from her. The image of her in her exile, in her
  poverty and humiliation, in her beaten pride and broken splendour was the
  most lively of all his mortifications, the most exquisite of all his secret
  tortures; he felt that he had abjectly failed towards her, towards her
  children, and, keenest sting of all, that must despise him for his failure
  and his misfortune.</p>

  <p>His head sank lower and lower on his breast, and two tears forced
  themselves from his tired eyes and hung burning on his faded cheeks.</p>

  <p>'Digby, my faithful lord,' he said, 'I do sometimes think that it would
  have been better for me to have died at Naseby. By now the Lord would have
  judged me, and I should have been at peace&mdash;peace, peace! How the word
  dangles before us while the thing is never to be found, this side of
  heaven.'</p>

  <p>Digby dropped on one knee beside him.</p>

  <p>'May Your Majesty soon find it,' he said, in a broken voice, 'and live
  long to enjoy it.'</p>

  <p>'If it were possible!' murmured Charles. 'But we must get to
  Ireland&mdash;it is very needful that we should get to Ireland.'</p>

  <p>Lord Digby lowered his voice, as if somewhere in this lonely,
  desolate-looking room a spy of Parliament or army might lurk.</p>

  <p>'The preparations are all complete,' he said. It only needs to wait until
  the Commissioners have left the island.'</p>

  <p>A little shudder shook the King.</p>

  <p>'What will it feel, Digby,' he murmured, 'to be free
  again&mdash;free!'</p>

  <p>Then, as if rousing himself from thoughts that threatened to be
  overwhelming, he put out his hand and took up a small brown volume tooled in
  gold, and, turning over the thin pages rough with print, let slip his mind
  from the leases of care and suffered himself to be distracted by Lucan's
  <i>Pharsalia</i>.</p>

  <p>The mist changed to rain, which slashed at the window; a winter wind
  disturbed the tapestry and flickered the flames on the deep hearth, which
  hissed beneath the drops falling down the wide chimney.</p>

  <p>Charles, sunk in the deep, worn leather chair, with one thin hand
  supporting his thin face, the long curls flowing over his breast, gathered
  consolation from those ancient deeds of melancholy heroism and fated
  endeavour.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby left the room to concert with the few personal attendants left
  the King about the final arrangements for the King's flight from Newport as
  soon as the Parliamentarians should have returned to London.</p>

  <p>But again Charles Stewart proved unfortunate.</p>

  <p>The day before his projected escape Colonel Hammond, the Governor of the
  Island, sent an escort to remove His Majesty from Newport to Hurst Castle, a
  dreary residence near the coast, on the sea shingle, where Charles was
  closely guarded beyond all hope of escape, even if his word of honour not to
  escape had not been extracted from him; and this was a point where he would
  admit of no sophistries. So the dream of Rupert and his ships and Ormonde and
  his loyal Catholics vanished, as all Charles' dreams had vanished, into the
  bitter obscurity of disappointment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-08"
     id="ch3-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. IN THE BALANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was the army who had ordered the King's removal to a
  place of greater security, the army who had now resolved to make an end of
  these long negotiations between King and Parliament.</p>

  <p>On the day after Charles was closed into Hurst Castle the army marched
  into London, Cromwell not yet with them; but other men, embued with his
  spirit, were his representatives. He had proposed that the Parliament should
  be forcibly dissolved and a new one elected, and a Declaration to this effect
  had been issued by the army now openly at variance with the assembly, which
  had flung aside their great Remonstrance. Leading officers spoke darkly, yet
  unmistakably, of what they would do to the King, ay, and to the
  Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Commons, undaunted, voted that the King's concessions were sufficient
  ground for treating of a general peace; the reply of the army was to send
  Colonel Pride down to the House to arrest every member who had voted to
  continuing negotiations with the King.</p>

  <p>'It was the only way,' said Henry Ireton, 'to save the kingdom from a new
  war into which King and Parliament conjointly would plunge us&mdash;that is
  our warrant and our law for what we do.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell, coming the evening of that day to London, approved. 'Since it is
  done, I am glad of it,' he said, 'and will endeavour to maintain it.'</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Harrison had gone down to Hurst Castle and removed the King
  from that melancholy solitude to Windsor.</p>

  <p>The now purged House of Commons, which consisted of a mere handful of
  Independent members, was nothing but the mouthpiece of the army, who were now
  the masters of the hour. In council they decided against bringing the King to
  trial if he could be brought by any means to reason, and Lord Denbigh was
  sent to Windsor again&mdash;once more and for the last time&mdash;to offer
  Charles terms.</p>

  <p>The same terms&mdash;the abandonment of Episcopacy and of his own absolute
  sovereignty.</p>

  <p>All illusion was at last stripped from the proceedings; no meaningless
  courtesies or formalities obscured the issue. The army were treating Charles
  as they would treat a vanquished enemy, and he at last saw it&mdash;saw there
  was no hope, no evasion possible, no succour at hand, no shift, no expedient
  to which he could turn; saw, too, for the first time, the sharp and bitter
  nature of the alternative of his refusal of these terms.</p>

  <p>The army talked freely of his trial and death; there was barely a disguise
  given to the fact that Lord Denbigh gave him his choice between the Church of
  England, his Crown&mdash;and his life.</p>

  <p>This struck not at the King's ambition or lust of power or love of
  authority, but at his conscience, for he believed as firmly that he was there
  to uphold the Divine ordinance in Church and State as Cromwell believed that
  God was mocked by Laud's surplices, candles, and genuflexions.</p>

  <p>On the gloomy day in the end of December when the return of Lord Denbigh
  with the King's answer was expected, Henry Ireton was with his father-in-law
  in his house in Drury Lane. Both men showed signs of the tremendous physical
  and spiritual stress they had lately undergone. Cromwell especially was
  haggard; the burden which he had assumed was no light one, nor was the
  responsibility he was about to undertake one which could be worn easily.</p>

  <p>Up to the very last he had hoped that the King would give way. Lord
  Denbigh's journey had been on his recommendation, and he still clung to the
  possibility that Charles, now absolutely with his back against the wall,
  might make those concessions which would enable the army to spare him.</p>

  <p>But the other and more likely alternative had to be faced.</p>

  <p>'Can we,' said Henry Ireton, in a tone almost of awe, 'bring to trial the
  crowned and anointed King?'</p>

  <p>The thing was indeed unheard of, appalling in its audacity even to the men
  who had been already years in arms against their King&mdash;a thing without
  precedent, full of a nameless horror. But Oliver Cromwell was not troubled by
  this consideration. He was uplifted by his stern enthusiasm from all fears of
  laws and tradition; he knew himself capable of moulding the movement to suit
  the need; and he was of an incalculable courage.</p>

  <p>Yet in this affair he had shown himself more moderate, almost more
  hesitating, than many of his colleagues; he did not see clearly; he was not
  sure what God had meant him to do, and his personal feeling, despite his
  absolute refusal to deal further with Charles after his treachery had been
  made manifest, was still towards some arrangement by which the King could be
  returned to the throne and forced to keep his people's laws.</p>

  <p>His trust in the King had been utterly scattered; his sentiments had
  become almost republican; yet in his heart he struggled to find some means of
  saving the King as he had struggled since the end of the first Civil War.</p>

  <p>He still hesitated before committing himself to the fierce measures
  advocated by the great body of the army; yet Charles had done some things
  which Cromwell could never forgive.</p>

  <p>Notably the calling in of the Scots.</p>

  <p>To the Englishman, English of the English in every fibre, this 'attempt to
  vassalage us to a foreign nation,' as he had called it, was the intolerable,
  unforgivable wrong&mdash;a thing which burnt the blood to think of&mdash;a
  wrong which the Scots, beaten back across the Border and Hamilton waiting
  death in London, did not soften or make amends for. Cromwell had broken the
  Scots, but he could not forgive them.</p>

  <p>'Had he not done that,' he cried aloud, 'it had been easier to forget his
  manifold deceits.'</p>

  <p>'God hath witnessed against him,' replied Ireton.</p>

  <p>But he, too, was for moderation; he had suggested a trial of the King and
  then a decorous imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Such a compromise did not please the Lieutenant-General, who was waiting
  for the indication for swift, prompt action. He wanted an impetus to an
  irrecoverable decision, not an expedient for avoiding it; nothing in the
  nature of a shift was ever tolerable to him.</p>

  <p>'Until Lord Denbigh return,' he broke out, 'we can decide on nothing. I
  know not what the Providence of God may put upon us; but this I know, the
  King hath one more chance, and if he take it not&mdash;there will be no
  excuse but folly and cowardice to delay our dealings with him.'</p>

  <p>'And when we have dealt with him&mdash;what then?' asked Ireton, and he
  looked gloomy and apprehensive, like a man oppressed with many heavy
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell rose from the table at which both had been sitting;
  through his air of weariness the indomitable fire of his inner conviction,
  his inner faith glowed. Ireton, looking at him, thought that he always, even
  in his moments of deepest dejection or melancholy, gave that impression of
  one carrying a flame.</p>

  <p>'I have much rested on these words of late,' he said: '"They that shine
  with thee shall perish. They that war against thee shall be as nothing; and
  as a thing of nought. For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying
  unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee."'</p>

  <p>As he spoke he moved to the window and stood with his back against the
  dark curtains which hung before it. His clothes were dark too, his white band
  and his tanned but pale face, his brown hair and clasped hands were all
  picked out and shone upon by the candlelight; for the rest, his figure was in
  shadow. Ireton, gazing at him, was impressed by something about him which,
  hearty and homely as were his manners, seemed to always put him beyond his
  brother officers; the quality of greatness, Henry Ireton thought it was; but
  he wondered wherein lay greatness.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell did not speak again, and Ireton took his leave.</p>

  <p>'I am going to Sir Thomas Fairfax,' he said, 'and if any messenger comes
  from Windsor to-night, I will send one over to you with the news.'</p>

  <p>After he had been alone a little while Cromwell went upstairs, still with
  a thoughtful face, with eyes downcast and a frowning brow.</p>

  <p>The room he entered was rendered cheerful by the bright firelight and the
  glow of the candles in the wall sconces of polished brass, and it formed the
  setting to a fair and tender picture.</p>

  <p>Cromwell's wife was seated at the spinet which occupied one corner of the
  room, and either side of her stood one of her younger daughters, singing. The
  lady and the children were all dressed in a brown colour, and the purity of
  their fair-complexioned faces and the delicacy of their soft and waving
  gold-brown hair was heightened by their collars and caps of white cambric
  enriched with exquisite needlework.</p>

  <p>At the Lieutenant-General's entrance they paused, and Elisabeth Cromwell
  was about to rise, but he bade them continue and crossed to the fireplace,
  where he stood quietly, with his head hanging on his breast.</p>

  <p>With a blush for the presence of their father at their simple performance,
  the two little girls began again; the fresh voices, sharply pure and sweetly
  tremulous, rose clearly and echoed clearly in the high-ceiled chamber,
  accompanied by the faint, half-muffled notes of the spinet.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">'Ye Holy Angels bright,<br>
  Who wait at God's right hand,<br>
  Or through the realms of light<br>
  Fly at your Lord's command.<br>
  Assist our song,<br>
  Or else the theme<br>
  Too high doth seem<br>
  For mortal tongue.'</p><br>

  <p>The little singers had forgotten the embarrassment of an audience; their
  eyes sparkled, their little round mouths strained open in a rapture.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell, as her fingers touched the keys to the simple melody,
  looked across the spinet to her husband.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">'Ye blessed souls at rest,<br>
  Who ran this earthly race,<br>
  And now from sin released,<br>
  Behold the Saviour's face<br>
  His praises sound<br>
  As in His light<br>
  With sweet delight<br>
  Ye do abound.'</p><br>

  <p>The mother's head bent a little; she dropped her eyes. She was thinking of
  Robert and Oliver, and wondering if they were leaning from heaven to listen
  to this song&mdash;'blessed souls at rest.' Ah, well!</p>

  <p class="poem">'Ye saints, who toil below,<br>
  Adore your Heavenly King,<br>
  And onward as ye go<br>
  Some joyful anthem sing.<br>
  Take what He gives<br>
  And praise Him still<br>
  Through good and ill,<br>
  Who ever lives!'</p><br>

  <p>The young voices gathered greater fervency on the next
  lines&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">'My soul, bear thou thy part,<br>
  Triumph in God above,<br>
  And with a well-tuned heart<br>
  Sing thou the songs of love!<br>
  Let all thy days<br>
  Till life shall end,<br>
  Whate'er He send,<br>
  Be tilled with praise!'</p><br>

  <p>Frances and Mary Cromwell, having ended their hymn, came round from behind
  the spinet and curtsied to their father.</p>

  <p>A sweet song,' he said, 'and sweetly sung. Who wrote the words, Mary?'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Richard Baxter, sir.' she replied; 'he taught them to the troop he
  was chaplain of at Kidderminster&mdash;and Henry copied them and brought them
  home to us.'</p>

  <p>'Learn Mr. Baxter's hymns,' he smiled, 'but not his tenets. He is lukewarm
  and unstable.'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cromwell rose.</p>

  <p>'And now they must to bed&mdash;I fear it is already overlate.'</p>

  <p>The Lieutenant-General stooped and kissed each of them on the fair,
  untroubled brow.</p>

  <p>'A good night, my dears, my sweets. A good night, my little wenches.'</p>

  <p>He lingered over the farewell caress half wistfully, and as they left the
  room his tired eyes followed them.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell came to her husband's side and glanced up at him, then
  down at the fire.</p>

  <p>'You are troubled to-night,' she said, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered 'no.'</p>

  <p>About Richard's marriage settlements,' she returned. 'It is over a year
  since that affair was first opened.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' he replied, 'I know. But what can I do? I cannot settle on
  Dorothy Mayor moneys which I have not got for my own. There is Henry to think
  of, and the two little ones&mdash;and thou knowest, Bess, I am not rich.'</p>

  <p>She knew well enough from many economies of her own. He had strained his
  estates at the commencement of the first war, when he had raised and
  equipped, at his own expense, his troop in Cambridgeshire; his pay was in
  arrears and had lately been reduced; he had waited many ancient debts due to
  him from the Government; and he had returned the larger portion of the income
  arising from the grant of Lord Worchester's lands to the Parliament to be
  used in settling that unhappy country, Ireland. Therefore he was now more
  hampered and with less money to dispose of than when in private life, and all
  his frugal living and all his wife's good management would not permit him to
  afford Mr. Mayor what he demanded for his daughter; therefore Richard's match
  had hung a year, and seemed likely to hang longer.</p>

  <p>'I would rather,' said Richard's father abruptly, 'that the lad was more
  like his brother Henry, and less eager to take a wife and live easily.'</p>

  <p>'All cannot be as thee,' answered Elisabeth Cromwell half sadly, 'wrapped
  in great affairs.'</p>

  <p>He turned.</p>

  <p>'Why, Bess,' he said, taking her hand, 'that did sound as a reproach.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, my lord, my dear,' she replied, in a subdued passion; 'but thou art
  so much away.'</p>

  <p>'But thou art not alone,' he said, eagerly bending over her.</p>

  <p>'A woman is always alone, Oliver, when she is away from him she loves. I
  think a man doth not understand that&mdash;he hath so much
  else&mdash;thou&mdash;thou hast so much&mdash;and I am gone right into the
  background of thy life!'</p>

  <p>He took both her hands now and laid them on his heart.</p>

  <p>'Thou art dearer to me than any creature in the world,' he said. 'Let that
  content thee.'</p>

  <p>She sighed and smiled together. By her great love for him she could
  measure her great pain because of him&mdash;the separations, the anxieties,
  the apprehension, the knowledge that she was only a part of his life, that he
  had now many, many other things to think of more important than her, while
  she had nothing but him&mdash;always him. But he could not understand.</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Why art thou sad, Bess?' he asked tenderly. 'Is it about Dick's
  marriage?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head; her gentle face flushed with the thought that came to
  her.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Oliver, I have been sorry about the King,' she said simply.</p>

  <p>'The King!' He dropped her hands.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell lifted her large, clear grey eyes.</p>

  <p>'What is to be the fate of the King?' she asked, trembling.</p>

  <p>'That hangs in the balance,' he replied briefly. 'Bring not these
  questions on to my own hearth, Bess.'</p>

  <p>Thus rebuked, she moved away, trembling more. Her husband looked at her
  kindly.</p>

  <p>'It is not for me or thee,' he said gently, 'to discuss the fate of the
  King, but for God in His good time to disclose it. Maybe He will harden His
  heart as He hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and maybe He will turn it to
  peace.'</p>

  <p>'These are terrible times,' replied Elisabeth Cromwell rapidly. 'I cannot
  but think of how terrible&mdash;being a woman I cannot but
  tremble&mdash;fearful things are said now about the
  King&mdash;about&mdash;bringing him to trial.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' asked her husband sternly. 'Hath he not been the author of two
  civil wars, and would he not have brought about a third save that God struck
  his forces at Preston Battle?'</p>

  <p>'But he&mdash;he is the Governor of England,' she answered timidly.</p>

  <p>'Nay, no longer,' returned Oliver Cromwell; 'that high office hath he
  defiled. God hath overturned him&mdash;"He shall put down the mighty from
  their seats and exalt the humble and meek." The King hath sinned against God,
  against his people, against the laws of England.'</p>

  <p>'Alack&mdash;it is beyond my understanding,' sighed his wife; 'but it
  seems to me he is the King!'</p>

  <p>'Be not deceived by high-sounding words,' replied the Lieutenant-General.
  'Charles Stewart is a man and must pay as men pay&mdash;for their sins and
  their follies.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke the servant entered with a note, which had just been brought,
  he said, by General Fairfax's man.</p>

  <p>Cromwell gazed at the seal&mdash;Henry Ireton's arms pressed into wax
  scarcely cold&mdash;a full minute before he opened it, and the blood rushed
  to his face.</p>

  <p>When he opened the letter his fingers shook.</p>

  <p>It contained a few words from his son-in-law, the sand yet sticking to the
  ink.</p>

  <p>The King had utterly refused to see Lord Denbigh, and utterly refused to
  have any dealings either with Parliament or army.</p>

  <p>He defied them. Now, driven to the last extremity, he had flung aside all
  subterfuge and all evasion; he stood by his conscience, and no matter what
  the consequences, he refused terms which he regarded as a betrayal of God's
  laws in Church or State.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell crumpled up the letter with a gesture of, for him, unusual
  agitation.</p>

  <p>'So it is over!' he muttered. He gazed at his wife with eyes that did not
  see her; drops of sweat stood out on his forehead and his lips quivered.</p>

  <p>'What is over?' asked Elisabeth Cromwell, in terrified tones.</p>

  <p>He drew himself together with an effort.</p>

  <p>'The reign of Charles Stewart,' he replied simply.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-09"
     id="ch3-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. BY WHAT AUTHORITY?</h2>

  <p class="first">The Lords having rejected the ordinance for bringing the
  King to trial, the Commons, always under the influence of the army, declared
  themselves capable of enforcing their own act by their own law, the People
  being, under God, the original of all just power.'</p>

  <p>Charles was hurried from Windsor to St. James's, and the day after his
  arrival in London put on his trial for having endeavoured to subvert his
  people's rights, for having levied war on them with the help of foreign
  troops, and with having, after once being spared, endeavoured by all wicked
  arts to again involve the kingdom in bloody confusion.</p>

  <p>This was the end after so many years of strife, evasion, pacts made and
  broken, bloodshed and lives ruined. Charles was a prisoner on trial for his
  life, and in one of his splendid beds at Whitehall (now the headquarters of
  the army) Oliver Cromwell slept or lay awake and struggled with tumultuous
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>Many who had been with him all along were against him now. Vane and Sidney
  protested hotly. Many members refused to sit among the judges who were to try
  Charles.</p>

  <p>'The King,' said Sidney, 'can be tried by no court, and by such a court as
  this no man can be tried.'</p>

  <p>'I tell you,' said Cromwell sombrely, 'we will cut off his head with the
  crown upon it.'</p>

  <p>So passionate and vigorous and unalterable was his resolution now it was
  taken.</p>

  <p>The fiercer spirits of the army were with him. '"Blood defileth the
  land,"' quoted Ludlow, '"and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood shed
  therein, but by the blood of him that shed it."'</p>

  <p>Cromwell, too, now believed that by God's express law the King was
  doomed.</p>

  <p>It mattered not a whit to him that the tribunal which was to try Charles
  had neither legal nor moral right, since there was no law by which the King
  could be brought to trial, and the judges represented neither the Commons nor
  the people, but a section of the army; indeed, while others endeavoured to
  find excuses with which to cover up the obvious illegality of the proceeding,
  Cromwell disdained any such shifts. As he had been the man who had striven
  longest and most arduously to make some compromise with the King, he was now
  the man who was advancing most boldly and directly to the climax of the
  King's last phase.</p>

  <p>He had decided there could be no peace while Charles lived, and he spared
  no effort to secure his death.</p>

  <p>The time for temporizing was past, he believed, and he acted, as he never
  failed to act at a crisis, with swiftness, with firmness, with unhesitating
  decision.</p>

  <p>Whitelocke, St. John, Wilde, and Rolle declined to be President of the
  Court which tried the King, but John Bradshaw accepted.</p>

  <p>For a week the trial in the great hall of Westminster (which the King had
  last entered when he came to demand the five members) continued, a long
  haughty protest on the part of Charles, a stern overruling of him on the part
  of the Court&mdash;the whole thing almost incredible in swiftness,
  fierceness, and enthusiastic passion overlaid with the stately forms of
  ancient ceremonial. On the fourth time of the sitting, the 29th January,
  being Saturday, the Court was held&mdash;as many believed&mdash;for the last
  time.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby, who had been separated from his master when Charles was
  removed to Hurst Castle, and had been wandering about, more or less in
  disguise ever since, had managed to gain London, and on this morning of the
  29th, a cold, wet, and grey day, he made his way to Westminster Hall, to
  witness the awful, unbelievable spectacle of the trial of his King.</p>

  <p>The great gates of the Hall were opened to admit the general public, which
  soon swarmed in, and Digby found himself in the midst of a vast concourse of
  people, mostly of the baser sort, who pushed and gossiped and passed food and
  drink from one to another, so that the atmosphere was like the pit of a
  theatre for the smell of beer and oranges, as it had been at the trial of
  Lord Strafford.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby caught scraps of conversation which pierced him to the
  heart&mdash;how, on the second day, the head had fallen off the King's cane
  and he had had to stoop for it himself&mdash;how he had paled at this, as if
  he took it for an ill-omen...how curt Bradshaw had been with him, and how
  certain all were that there could only be one end&mdash;the axe...</p>

  <p>Soon the Court entered, and a great 'Ah-h,' like an indrawn breath, rose
  from the crowd when they saw that Serjeant Bradshaw, the Lord President, was
  attired in a scarlet robe, instead of the black one which he had worn on the
  previous occasions. 'His cap,' whispered the man next Lord Digby, 'is lined
  with steel, for fear one might make an attempt on him.'</p>

  <p>John Bradshaw, with a very unmoved dignity and stern calmness, took his
  seat in the midst of the Court, in a crimson velvet chair, having a desk with
  a crimson velvet cushion before him; either side of him, on the scarlet-hung
  benches, the fourscore members of the Court seated themselves, all with their
  hats on; sixteen gentlemen with partisans stood either side the Court; before
  a table, set at the feet of the President and covered with a rich Turkey
  carpet on which lay the sword, stood the Serjeant-at-Arms with the mace; the
  Clerk of the Court sat at this table also.</p>

  <p>A company of guards was placed about the Hall to keep order, and
  everywhere, in the body of the Court and in the galleries, was a great
  expectant press of people.</p>

  <p>After the Court had been sitting about ten minutes, the prisoner arrived
  in the charge of Colonel Tomlinson and a company of gentlemen with
  partisans.</p>

  <p>As he entered some of the soldiers cried out, 'Execution Execution!
  Justice against the traitor at the Bar!'</p>

  <p>The Serjeant-at-Arms met the King and conducted him to the Bar, where a
  crimson velvet chair was placed for him.</p>

  <p>Charles looked sternly at the Court, up at the galleries and the multitude
  gathered in the body of the Hall; then he seated himself, without moving his
  hat.</p>

  <p>He was dressed more richly than Lord Digby remembered him to have been for
  some time; his suit was black velvet and pale blue silk, with Flemish lace
  and silver knots; he carried a long cane in his hand and a pair of doeskin
  gloves. He was scarcely seated before he rose up again and moved about and
  looked down at the spectators with a smile of unutterable haughtiness. Lord
  Digby was near enough to remark that he looked in good health, vigorous, and
  composed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he glanced up at the Lord President, and though he must have
  remarked the scarlet robe, he did not change colour.</p>

  <p>'I shall desire a word&mdash;to be heard a little,' he said, 'and hope I
  shall give no occasion of interruption.'</p>

  <p>'You may answer in your time,' replied Bradshaw coldly. 'Hear the Court
  first.'</p>

  <p>'If it please you, sir, I desire to be heard,' said the King. 'And I shall
  not give any occasion of interruption&mdash;and it is only in a word&mdash;a
  sudden judgment&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' interrupted the Lord President, 'you shall be heard in due time,
  but you are to hear the Court first&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Sir, I desire&mdash;it will be in answer to what I believe the Court will
  say&mdash;sir, a hasty judgment is not so soon recalled&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied the Lord President sternly, 'you shall be heard before the
  judgment be given, and in the meantime you may forbear.'</p>

  <p>Charles took his seat again, saying, 'Well, sir, shall I be heard before
  judgment be given?'</p>

  <p>The Lord President now proceeded to address the Court</p>

  <p>'Gentlemen, it is well known to most of you that the prisoner at the Bar
  hath been several times convened before the Court to make answer to a charge
  of treason&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Here the King looked up and laughed in the face of the Court.</p>

  <p>'&mdash;and other high crimes exhibited against him in the name of the
  People of England&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A shrill woman's voice interrupted from one of the galleries&mdash;'Not
  half the People!' The King smiled, and there was some disturbance while the
  lady was silenced or removed.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw continued:</p>

  <p>'To which charge being required to answer, he began to take on him to
  offer reasoning and debate unto the authority of the Court to try and judge
  him; but being overruled in that, and still required to make his answer, he
  was still pleased to continue contumacious, and to refuse to submit or
  answer.</p>

  <p>'Thereupon the Court have considered of the charge; they have considered
  of the contumacy and of the notoriety of the fact charged upon the prisoner,
  and have agreed upon the sentence to be pronounced against this
  prisoner.'</p>

  <p>The Lord President paused a moment, and a low hum went through the Court.
  The King threw back his head with that expression of incredulous haughtiness
  still on his face.</p>

  <p>'The prisoner doth desire to be heard,' continued Bradshaw, before the
  sentence be pronounced, and the Court hath resolved that they will hear
  him.'</p>

  <p>Charles rose; his scornful eyes flickered along the faces of his judges
  and rested for a second on the white countenance of Oliver Cromwell, who was
  looking at him intently.</p>

  <p>The Lord President addressed the King&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Yet, sir, this much I must tell you beforehand, which you have been
  minded of before, that if that you have to say be to offer any debate
  concerning jurisdiction, you arc not to be heard in it&mdash;you have offered
  it formerly and you have indeed struck at the root, that is, the power and
  supreme authority of the Commons of England&mdash;but, sir, if you have
  anything to say in defence of yourself concerning the matter charged, the
  Court hath given me in command to let you know that they will hear you.'</p>

  <p>The King caught hold of the bar in front of him. He began to speak; at
  first his voice, though steady, was so low that only those near could hear
  him; he addressed himself to Bradshaw, but he faced all his judges, and his
  glance travelled from one to another.</p>

  <p>At last Lord Digby, straining forward through the press, caught some
  words.</p>

  <p>'...This many a day all things have been taken away from me, but that
  which I call more dear to me than my life, my honour, and my
  conscience&mdash;and if I had respect to my life more than the peace of the
  kingdom, the liberty of the subject, certainly I should have made a
  particular defence for myself, for by that at leastwise I might have deferred
  an ugly sentence, which I believe will pass on me.'</p>

  <p>He then asked to be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and
  Commons before any sentence was given.</p>

  <p>As he concluded he raised his voice and spoke with great nobleness and
  force.</p>

  <p>'And if I cannot get this liberty I do here protest that so fair shows of
  liberty and peace are pure shows and not otherwise since you will not hear
  your King.'</p>

  <p>A hush followed his speech; Cromwell whispered to a neighbour; a faint
  sunlight penetrated the narrow Gothic window and touched to brilliancy John
  Bradshaw in his scarlet robes among his crimson cushions.</p>

  <p>'Sir, you have spoken,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' replied the King, looking at him austerely.</p>

  <p>The sunlight strengthened; the judge blazed in his unrelieved red; the
  prisoner was still in shadow; he stood with his hands on the bar; Lord Digby
  could see that he was biting his under-lip.</p>

  <p>'What you have said,' announced Bradshaw, 'is a further declining of the
  jurisdiction of this Court, which was the thing wherein you were limited
  before&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The King's voice cut his speech.</p>

  <p>'Pray excuse me, sir, for my interruption, because you mistake me&mdash;it
  is not a declining of it; you do judge me before you hear me speak. I say I
  will not, I do not decline, though I cannot acknowledge the jurisdiction of
  this Court&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A deep humming from the Court drowned the rest of his speech.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw, stern, slightly flushed, and in a voice of terrible import, made
  reply&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Sir, this is not altogether new that you have moved unto us&mdash;not
  altogether new to us, though it is the first time in person that you have
  offered it to the Court. Sir, you say you do not decline the jurisdiction of
  the Court.'</p>

  <p>'Not in this that I have said,' answered Charles swiftly.</p>

  <p>'I understand you well, sir,' said the Lord President 'but, nevertheless,
  that which you have offered seems to be contrary to that saying of
  yours&mdash;for the Court are ready to give a sentence.'</p>

  <p>The very slightest quiver disturbed the King's face; he sought for his
  handkerchief, found it, and wiped his lips, looking down the while.</p>

  <p>'It is not as you say,' continued Bradshaw sternly, 'that we will not hear
  our King&mdash;we have been ready to hear you, we have patiently waited your
  pleasure for three Courts together, to hear what you would say to the
  People's charges against you, to which you have not vouchsafed to give any
  answer at all.'</p>

  <p>AS Lord Digby, pressed in the pushing crowd, listened to these words and
  gazed at the awful scene a sickness came over him; he saw that terrible red
  of judge and cushion, chair and bench float in a mist before his eyes, and
  through that scarlet blur the King's figure, stripped now of the inviolate
  sacredness of Majesty&mdash;merely a man, a desperate man in a sea of
  enemies, making a last stand for his life.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw concluded his speech by saying that the Court would withdraw to
  the Court of Awards to consider of the King's request to be heard in the
  Painted Chamber, and so they moved out, leaving the red chair and the red
  benches bare.</p>

  <p>Charles was also removed; as he passed the sword lying on the table
  covered with the Turkey carpet he said, 'I do not fear that,' and Oliver
  Cromwell and Thomas Harrison, hearing the words, looked at him over their
  shoulders as they went out.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby struggled nearer the front and cried out, 'God save your
  Majesty!' hoping the King would recognize his voice, but it was lost in cries
  of 'Justice!' and 'Execution!' which rose from the soldiers.</p>

  <p>After half an hour the Court returned and the Serjeant-at-Arms brought
  back the prisoner. Charles now held in his hand a small bunch of herbs, and
  truly the atmosphere was stifling; he was still composed, but his face was
  now as white as the wall behind him; he seated himself and folded his
  arms.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw addressed him; he was not to be allowed to go before the Lords
  and Commons in the Painted Chamber. 'The judges are resolved to proceed to
  punishment and to judgment, and that is their unanimous resolution.'</p>

  <p>Some of the spectators groaned; the sense of impending doom, calamity, and
  horror spread from one to another. Charles rose; he was not a whit abashed or
  lowered in his pride, but there was a passion in his tones, a ringing
  challenge in his words, which were the indications of an inner despair.</p>

  <p>'I know it is vain for me to dispute,' he said. 'I am no sceptic for to
  deny the power you have&mdash;I know that you have power enough! I confess,
  sir, I think it would have been for the kingdom's peace if you had shown the
  lawfulness of your power!' His haughty contempt showed for a moment unmasked,
  his look, his bearing, his voice, defied them utterly. For this delay that I
  have desired, I confess it is a delay, but a delay very important to the
  peace of the kingdom, for it is not my person that I look on alone, it is the
  kingdom's welfare and the kingdom's peace&mdash;it is an old sentence that we
  should think long before we resolve of great matters&mdash;therefore, sir, I
  do say again, that I do put at your doors all the inconveniency of a hasty
  sentence. I confess I have been here this week, this day eight days ago was
  the day I came here first, but a little delay of a day or two further may
  give peace&mdash;whereas a hasty judgment may bring on that trouble and
  perpetual inconveniency to the kingdom that the child which is unborn may
  repent it.' He paused a second, then raised his voice slightly. 'Therefore
  again, out of the duty I owe to God, and to my country, I do desire that I
  may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, or any other
  chamber that you will appoint me.'</p>

  <p>The sixty-eight judges made no movement; Bradshaw, whose dignity and
  unfaltering composure were as remarkable as the dignity and composure of the
  prisoner, considering the extraordinary position in which he, a mere Cheshire
  gentleman, was now placed towards his sovereign, and what a responsibility he
  was taking on himself, what undying vengeance, what possibly horrible fate he
  was facing if the tide should one day turn, briefly replied that the Court
  had made their resolution and again asked Charles if he had anything to say
  for himself before sentence was delivered.</p>

  <p>The King, facing him, replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I say this, sir, that if you will hear me, if you will but give this
  delay, I doubt not but I shall give some satisfaction to you all here. and to
  my People, after that. And, therefore, I do require you, as you shall answer
  it at the dreadful Day of Judgment, that you will consider it once
  again.'</p>

  <p>It was what he had said since he had first been put on trial, a steady
  refusal to recognize this Court (as on all legal grounds he was justified in
  doing), a refusal to plead or argue the cause, a repetition of the haughty
  demand&mdash;'By what authority?' Before the Lords and Commons he might
  defend himself, not before this tribunal of his rebellious subjects. But as
  deeply rooted, as unyielding, as his refusal to recognize the Court was the
  Court's intention to judge and condemn him; they were there to make
  inquisition for blood, and not one of them faltered in their stern task.</p>

  <p>In answer to the King's last speech Bradshaw said merely, 'Sir, I have
  received direction from the Court.'</p>

  <p>The King sat down.</p>

  <p>'Well, sir,' he said, and looked about him with utter haughtiness.</p>

  <p>'The Court will proceed to sentence,' continued the Lord President, 'if
  you have nothing more to say.'</p>

  <p>Lord Digby and many others held their breath; would the King, even now,
  disdain to answer to his charge?</p>

  <p>He looked at Bradshaw and very faintly smiled.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he said, 'I have nothing more to say, but I shall desire that this
  may be entered&mdash;what I have said.'</p>

  <p>'The Court, sir, hath something more to say to you,' said Bradshaw,
  'which, although I know it will be very unacceptable, yet they are resolved
  to discharge their duty. Sir, you speak very well of a precious thing, which
  you call Peace, and it is much to be wished that God had put it into your
  heart that you had as effectually and really endeavoured and studied the
  peace of the kingdom, as now in words you do pretend&mdash;but, as you were
  told the other day, actions must expound intentions&mdash;yet your actions
  have been clean contrary.'</p>

  <p>In this strain the speech continued, delivered with clearness, with force
  and point, yet with a rapidity that strained the speed of the licensed penmen
  who were taking down the report of the trial.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw spoke with learning, with eloquence, with weight and fire; yet
  what he said was but a repetition of the old grounds the Parliament had taken
  since the beginning of the war; the law was above the King. The King had
  defied the law and was therefore answerable.</p>

  <p>He cited many precedents, quoted many authorities, but he could not
  disguise the illegality of the tribunal over which he presided, or cloak the
  fact that the King was being judged by means as outside the law as his had
  been when he had cast Sir John Eliot into the Tower or forced John Hampton to
  pay ship money.</p>

  <p>Charles, listening to an indictment such as no king had ever listened to
  before, in a situation in which no king had ever been before, sat perfectly
  still, holding the herbs to his nostrils.</p>

  <p>To him this talk was mere waste of air; he was, as he had said, as good a
  lawyer as any in the kingdom, and he knew that the Court which Bradshaw so
  burningly justified had no shadow of legal right; he knew that he was the
  victim of force, and he knew that he was suffering, not so much for the
  offences which the Lord President laid to his charge, as because he had
  remained faithful to the Church of England and the Divine right of kings; he
  knew that if he had forsaken these two tenets even a few days ago when Lord
  Denbigh came to Windsor he might have been saved.</p>

  <p>And he did not regret his firmness&mdash;even at this moment.</p>

  <p>Once, when Bradshaw, appealing to history, said, 'You are the hundred and
  ninth King of Scotland,' he moved, and his look brightened as if he had been
  recalled from wandering thoughts to the present moment; and when the Lord
  President spoke of the violent end of his grandmother, Mary Stewart, he
  started a little and frowned.</p>

  <p>For the rest he was motionless and silent, save only when Bradshaw
  arraigned him as, 'Tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy to the
  Commonwealth of England'; then he blushed and cried out, 'Ha!'</p>

  <p>The Lord President, spurred afresh by this cry of defiance, proceeded to
  prove these charges against the King, reinforcing them with texts of
  Scripture, and so upbraiding and fiercely condemning the King that at last
  Charles, amid a general murmur and buzz of the Court, sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>'I would only desire one word before you give sentence,' he said, 'and
  that is that you hear me concerning those great imputations that you have
  laid to my charge!'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied' Bradshaw undauntedly, 'you must give me leave to go
  on&mdash;for I am not far from your sentence and your time is now
  past&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Again Charles interrupted.</p>

  <p>'But I desire that you will hear me a few words only&mdash;for truly
  whatever sentence you will put upon me in respect of those heavy imputations
  that I see by your speech you have put upon me&mdash;sir, it is very true
  that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' said Bradshaw, with great sternness, 'I would not willingly,
  especially at this time, interrupt you in anything you have to say, but, sir,
  you have not owned us as a Court&mdash;you look upon us as a sort of people
  met together&mdash;and we know what language we receive from your party.'</p>

  <p>'I know nothing of that!' exclaimed Charles contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw continued with the old bitter grievance; 'You disavow us as a
  Court'&mdash;and on that theme spoke a little longer, the King the while
  facing him, leaning forward eagerly, with clenched hands and white face,
  frowning.</p>

  <p>'We cannot be unmindful of what the Scripture tells us, for to acquit the
  guilty is of equal abomination as to condemn the innocent. We may not acquit
  the guilty. What sentence the law affirms to a traitor, tyrant, a murderer,
  and a public enemy to the country, that sentence you are now to hear read
  unto you, and that is the sentence of the Court.'</p>

  <p>There was a great movement in the Hall as of a wave advancing, then flung
  back. Oliver Cromwell put his hands before his face; the King did not
  move.</p>

  <p>'Read the sentence,' said Bradshaw. 'Make an oyer [sic] and command
  silence while the sentence is read.'</p>

  <p>Which was done by the Clerk of the Court, and silence indeed fell&mdash;a
  silence which seemed to shudder.</p>

  <p>The Clerk read over the charge from the parchment he held, and then
  proceeded&mdash;</p>

  <p>'This charge being read unto him, he, the said Charles Stewart, was
  required to give his answer, but he refused to do so, and so expressed the
  several passages of his trial in refusing to answer. For all which Treasons
  and Crimes this Court doth adjudge that the said Charles Stewart, as a
  tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy, shall be put to death by the
  severing of his head from his body.'</p>

  <p>Terrible sighs broke from the spectators; they swayed to and fro. The
  King, now the moment had come, looked incredulous.</p>

  <p>'The sentence now read and published,' said Bradshaw, 'is the Act,
  Sentence, Judgment, and Resolution of the whole Court.'</p>

  <p>At this the sixty-eight judges stood up to show their assent.</p>

  <p>'Will you hear me a word, sir?' cried Charles.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' returned Bradshaw, 'you are not to be heard after the
  sentence.'</p>

  <p>'No, sir?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir&mdash;by your favour, sir. Guard, withdraw your prisoner.'</p>

  <p>The partisans closed round Charles; incredulous, outraged, he continued to
  protest.</p>

  <p>'I may speak after the sentence&mdash;by your favour, sir, I may speak
  after the sentence&mdash;ever&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The guards caught hold of him none too civilly.</p>

  <p>'I say, sir, I do,' cried the unfortunate King&mdash;then sternly to the
  soldier who had seized his arm, 'Hold!&mdash;by your favour the sentence,
  sir&mdash;'</p>

  <p>They pushed and dragged him away. He raised his voice.</p>

  <p>'I am not suffered for to speak! Expect what justice other people will
  have!'</p>

  <p>So, still incredulous, protesting, he was forced away, and the Court rose
  and went into the Painted Chamber.</p>

  <p>Lord Digby made his way out of the crowd; he found a dun mist over London
  and rows of Cromwell's Ironsides keeping guard outside the Hall.</p>

  <p>As the King passed out with his guards on his way to Sir Robert Cotton's,
  one of these men called out, 'God bless you, sir!' and his officer struck him
  on the face.</p>

  <p>'It is a severe punishment for a little offence,' said Charles. He was now
  quite calm.</p>

  <p>The mist deepened, blotting out the surging crowd, some of whom wept and
  some of whom were silent, but none of whom openly rejoiced.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3-10"
     id="ch3-10"></a>CHAPTER X. EXIT THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">The Dutch Ambassador interceded for the King; the Queen and
  the Prince of Wales wrote, offering to accept any conditions Parliament might
  require if only the King might be spared; but the stern enthusiasts who had
  resolved to sacrifice the blood of the tyrant were not to be turned from
  their purpose now by any entreaty or threat whatever; the thing they were
  about to do was awful, incredible to the whole world, but they were not to be
  stopped now. The Scottish Commissioners spoke for the King, too, but in vain;
  neither they nor the others got any answer.</p>

  <p>That day, Monday, the King was permitted to take leave of the only two of
  his children left in England&mdash;the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess
  Elisabeth; that day Oliver Cromwell and his colleagues signed the
  death-warrant at Whitehall.</p>

  <p>The next day was appointed for the execution; the King slept that night at
  St. James's Palace, but Oliver Cromwell, in the rich chamber in Whitehall,
  slept not at all, but prayed from candlelight to dawn, then armed himself and
  went out to meet the other commissioners who were in the banqueting hall,
  urging that the workmen be hastened with the scaffold in front of the Palace,
  which was not yet ready, nor did look to be ready before the King came.</p>

  <p>Charles slept; neither dreams nor visions disturbed him, and when he woke,
  two hours before the dawn, he remembered everything at once, very
  clearly.</p>

  <p>He remembered that he was to die to-day, that he had taken leave of his
  children and given Elisabeth two diamond seals for her mother...He remembered
  that he would never see the Queen again, and that he left her in exile
  dependent on her sister-in-law, the Regent of France.</p>

  <p>And as he got out of bed he remembered Lord Strafford.</p>

  <p>He dressed himself with great slowness and care in the clothes he had worn
  during his trial; he put on two shirts and a blue silk vest, for it was cold
  and he had no wish to shiver; he exactly adjusted the black and silver, the
  Flemish lace, the knots of ribbon; he combed his hair and arranged it in the
  long, smooth ringlets...Once or twice while he was dressing he paused.</p>

  <p>'O God,' he said, 'am I&mdash;the King&mdash;going to die to-day?'</p>

  <p>He was still incredulous; it seemed to himself that his feelings were
  suspended. He moved mechanically; he had an almost childish anxiety not to
  tremble; he kept holding out his right hand and looking at it; when he saw
  that it was steady he smiled.</p>

  <p>When he came to fasten his doublet he went to the mirror framed in
  embroidery and tortoise-shell, which hung at the foot of his bed, and then he
  noticed that his face was slightly distorted&mdash;at one side drawn with a
  strange contraction...Yet he told himself that he felt quite calm; he tried
  to smooth that look away from his features with his fingers, then moved away
  abruptly and opened the window.</p>

  <p>He wondered what Strafford had looked like just before his death, and it
  came to him that he was enduring what Strafford had endured&mdash;minute by
  minute the same&mdash;he was also the same age as Strafford had been, to the
  very year.</p>

  <p>He sat down in the great arm-chair by the bed and tried to think; what a
  failure his life had been, what a collapse of all hopes and
  ambitions&mdash;how incomplete; he was very, very weary of the long struggle
  which he had maintained so unyieldingly, and not sorry to have it ended.</p>

  <p>Yet it was an awful thing to die this way&mdash;and so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Only a month ago he had been at Windsor, firmly believing that his enemies
  would destroy each other, firmly believing that he would once more come to
  Whitehall, a king, and hang all these rebels and traitors.</p>

  <p>And now it was all over, all the hopes and fears, suspenses and
  agitations, all the struggles and defeats and intrigues; there were only a
  few hours of time left, and only one thing more to do&mdash;to die
  decently.</p>

  <p>He put on his shoes with the big crimson roses, his light sword, his
  George with the collar of knots and roses, his black velvet cloak; then as
  the dawn began to blur the candlelight, Bishop Juxon, whose attendance had
  been permitted him, came to him. It was this Bishop who had urged him not to
  assent to Strafford's death&mdash;how well both men remembered that
  now&mdash;across all the tumultuous events which lay between&mdash;how
  well!</p>

  <p>Charles rose.</p>

  <p>'I thank you for your loyalty, my lord,' he said; and then he was silent,
  for he thought that his voice sounded unnatural.</p>

  <p>'May Your Majesty wake to-morrow so glorified that you will forget
  to-day!' replied the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow!' repeated Charles absently. 'Ay, to-morrow&mdash;you will get
  up to-morrow and move and eat&mdash;ay, to-morrow&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow thou wilt be in Paradise, sire,' replied Juxon firmly, and a
  sincere hope and courage shone in his eyes, which were red and swollen with
  weeping.</p>

  <p>'I die for the Church of England,' said the King quickly. 'They may say
  what they will, but if I had abandoned Episcopacy I might have lived.'</p>

  <p>'God knoweth it,' answered the Bishop solemnly, 'and men will know it
  after a little while.'</p>

  <p>Charles took up his hat, his gloves, his cane, and without speaking
  followed the Bishop into the little royal chapel where he had so often
  worshipped in happier times.</p>

  <p>He took the Sacrament; when the ceremony was over a calm, almost a
  lethargy, fell on his spirits; he tried to think of great and tremendous
  things, of what was behind him and what was before him, but his brain slipped
  from them; even the Queen had become absolutely remote. He found himself
  wondering how Strafford had felt at this same moment in his life.</p>

  <p>When he left the chapel he went to one of the antechambers and waited.</p>

  <p>'The omens were against me from the first,' he said suddenly. 'I was
  crowned in white, like a shroud, and at my coronation sermon the text was;
  "Be thou faithful unto Death and I will give thee a crown of Eternal Life";
  then my flag was blown down at Nottingham&mdash;and the other day, at what
  they call my trial, the head fell off my cane.'</p>

  <p>This speech showed that his mind still ran on worldly things; but Juxon
  seized hold on a portion of his words with which to give him comfort.</p>

  <p>'Thou hast been faithful unto death,' he said, and 'to-day will enter on
  to Eternal Life.'</p>

  <p>'I said I would rather die than betray the Church of England,' answered
  Charles, 'and I have redeemed it to the letter.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke there entered unceremoniously Colonel Hacker, one of the three
  officers appointed to convey him to Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Charles rose with such majesty and undaunted dignity that the stout
  Puritan was, for a moment, abashed, and held out his warrant in silence.</p>

  <p>'I submit to your power, but I defy your authority,' said the King
  contemptuously, 'and with that clapped on his hat and followed the officer,
  Juxon following him.</p>

  <p>When they reached the fresh air Charles felt a new vigour, a certain
  excitement; in all the depth of his fall and the bitterness of his
  humiliation, in all the extreme of his failure and the mightiness of his
  defeat, he had his own inner triumph. He might be broken but he was not bent;
  he died a King, not yielding a jot of his rights, bequeathing to his son a
  lost heritage, but one uncurtailed by any concession of his. He was dying for
  his beliefs&mdash;because he would not forgo them they were killing him; he
  found satisfaction in that thought.</p>

  <p>When he came to where his escort of guards waited, he cried out in his
  usual tone of authority, 'March on apace!'</p>

  <p>It was now about ten o'clock; the heavy air had hardly lifted over London,
  but it was pleasant in the Park, and from the bare fields and hedgerows
  beyond came a waft of winter freshness; all the view was blocked by people
  and regiment upon regiment of soldiers, all motionless and
  expressionless.</p>

  <p>'It is an ordinary day,' said Charles, 'like a hundred other days, but it
  shall long be marked with red in England's calendar.'</p>

  <p>The people, overawed by the soldiers and by the terror of the occasion,
  were strangely silent as he passed; the prevailing emotion seemed a desperate
  curiosity, as if they waited, breathless, to know if this horrific thing
  could really come to pass.</p>

  <p>The King thought of nothing but of how Strafford had walked so...</p>

  <p>When he came to Whitehall be was conducted to his own bedchamber; there
  was a fire burning and a breakfast laid for him. In these familiar
  surroundings, where some of the happy moments of his splendid life had been
  spent, a faint horror came over him, and he felt his knees tremble; he found,
  too, that a physical sickness touched him at the sight of the food.</p>

  <p>'I have taken the Sacrament,' he said briefly. Then he asked of the
  soldiers still attending him&mdash;'How long?'&mdash;and they told him 'Till
  the scaffold was finished.'</p>

  <p>'It is terrible,' said Charles to the Bishop, 'to wait.'</p>

  <p>The Commissioners were waiting too. Oliver Cromwell was in the boarded
  gallery, and with him was one Nunelly, the doorkeeper to the committee of the
  army, who had a warrant of 50,000 to deliver to the Lieutenant-General; with
  them were Major Harrison and Mr. Hugh Peters.</p>

  <p>'O Lord!' cried this last, 'what mercy to see this great city fall down
  before us! And what a stir there is to bring this great man to justice,
  without whose blood he would turn us all to blood had he reigned again!'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell took the packet from Nunelly; he was quite white, and his
  hand shook, so that twice the package dropped.</p>

  <p>'Nunelly,' he said hoarsely, 'will you see the beheading of the
  King&mdash;surely you will see the beheading of the King?'</p>

  <p>And without waiting for an answer he began to pace up and down, in
  uncontrollable agitation and excitement.</p>

  <p>And presently Hugh Peters and Richard Nunelly went out into the banqueting
  hall, and out of the centre window on to the scaffold where the joiners were
  yet at work driving staples in.</p>

  <p>When they returned to the boarded gallery, Cromwell and Harrison were
  still there.</p>

  <p>'This will be a good day,' said Peters.</p>

  <p>'Are you not afraid that it will be a bloody day to all England?' asked
  Nunelly fearfully.</p>

  <p>'This is not a thing done in a corner,' replied Harrison calmly, 'but
  before the world. I follow not my own poor judgment, but the revealed word of
  God in His Holy Scriptures.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell turned to Peters who stood in his black cloak and hat like
  death's own herald.</p>

  <p>'Is it ready?' he asked. 'Why this delay&mdash;this intolerable
  delay?'</p>

  <p>His voice shook as he spoke.</p>

  <p>'Are the vizards ready?' he asked again.</p>

  <p>'Ay, it is Brandon the hangman and the fellow Hulet, and they are to have
  thirty pounds apiece&mdash;and now, I think, Colonel Hacker may go to fetch
  the King,' replied Peters.</p>

  <p>'Will you see him pass?' asked Harrison.</p>

  <p>'I will not look on him again, alive or dead!' replied Cromwell
  sombrely.</p>

  <p>But Peters and Nunelly went to an upper window where they might have a
  good view...</p>

  <p>In his bedchamber the King still waited; the soldiers had withdrawn and
  left him alone with Juxon, to whom the dying man gave his last instructions,
  and one, above all, important.</p>

  <p>'Let my son forgive his father's murderers&mdash;and, let <i>him always
  maintain the Church of England and his own royal rights in this
  realm</i>&mdash;let him make no compromise on these points. And let my
  younger sons never be cajoled into taking their brother's place&mdash;my son
  Charles, who, in a few moments now, will be King of England and
  Scotland.'</p>

  <p>'I promise,' said Juxon.</p>

  <p>Then the King rose and walked up and down.</p>

  <p>'Jesus, God!' he cried, 'spare me this waiting!'</p>

  <p>'I implore Your Majesty to eat and drink a little,' entreated the Bishop,
  and Charles, who felt himself indeed sick and faint, drank a glass of claret
  and eat a piece of bread. When he had finished he took a white satin cap from
  his pocket and gave it to Juxon, also his watch, with some broken words of
  thanks. Then Colonel Hacker came, and the King turned to go through the
  splendid galleries of his old home to his death.</p>

  <p>He had his hat on and said not a word; beneath his composure he was
  struggling to overcome the physical weakness that beset him, rendering him
  incapable of high thoughts; the sensitive flesh shrank from what it had to
  face; already he felt a ring of pain round his neck.</p>

  <p>The fine apartments, the paintings, the rich furniture still there, swam
  dizzily before his eyes; but he walked firmly...</p>

  <p>Colonel Hacker led the way; they stepped through the centre window of the
  banqueting hall on to a scaffold hung with black, on which stood the two
  vizards or headsmen both of whom wore frieze breeches and coats&mdash;one had
  a grey beard showing beneath the mask, the other was disguised with a light
  wig. When Charles stepped out of the window he recoiled with a repulsion no
  pride could control. In the foreground the two black figures, and beyond a
  sea of white faces, all looking at him; even the soldiers, horse and foot,
  their red coats and steel brightening the grey morning, were looking at
  him&mdash;all in silence.</p>

  <p>His glance fell to the block. 'Is it so low?' he asked, in a horrified
  way. Then he recovered himself and turned to the few about him.</p>

  <p>'It was the Parliament began the war, not I,' he said, 'but I hope they
  may be guiltless too, and all blame may go to the ill instruments which came
  between us'&mdash;here one of the officers touched the axe, and the King
  cried out&mdash;'Take care of the axe! take care of the axe!'&mdash;resuming
  afterwards his speech. 'The government rests with the King and not with the
  people, in that belief and in the faith of the Church of England I die.'</p>

  <p>He laid off his cloak and hat, then added with great
  wistfulness&mdash;</p>

  <p>'In one respect I suffer justly, and that is because I have permitted an
  unjust sentence to be executed on another.'</p>

  <p>He took off his George and the little miniature of the Queen (which he
  kissed), and gave them to Juxon.</p>

  <p>He gave a purse of guineas to the grey-bearded vizard with the axe, who
  knelt to ask his pardon, and again that awful sickness closed over his
  heart.</p>

  <p>'Take care they do not put me to pain,' he said to Colonel Hacker, and his
  lips trembled. Then to the man, 'I shall say but very short prayers, and then
  thrust out my hands&mdash;at this sign do you strike.'</p>

  <p>'I will warrant, sir,' said Colonel Hacker, 'the fellow is skilful.'</p>

  <p>The King now took off his doublet, sword, and swordstring, doing it
  carefully that he might gain time for perfect composure at the supreme
  minute.</p>

  <p>Juxon approached him.</p>

  <p>'Your Majesty hath but one more stage to travel in this weary world, and
  though that is a turbulent and troublesome stage, it is a short one, and will
  carry Your Majesty all the way from earth to heaven.'</p>

  <p>Charles looked at St. James's Palace showing beyond the multitude of
  faces.</p>

  <p>'I have a good cause and a gracious God on my side,' he said. He took the
  white satin cap from the Bishop, and put his hair up in it; a slight figure
  he looked now in the straight blue vest and white cap.</p>

  <p>The church bells struck half-past twelve, the sluggard sun sent faint rays
  through the low winter clouds. The King knelt down. 'Remember,' he said to
  Juxon.</p>

  <p>A great excitement steadied him, driving away the sickness; this was the
  end, the end&mdash;and after?</p>

  <p>He placed his forehead in the niche of the block; the position was
  uncomfortable, and he was staring down at the black covering of the scaffold
  floor.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes, clutching his hands on his breast; he felt the keen
  air on his bare neck, and confused visions leaped before him. He tried to
  pray.</p>

  <p>'Lord Jesus,' he murmured swiftly. 'Lord Jesus&mdash;' he could think of
  nothing more; with an almost mechanical movement he threw out his hands.</p>

  <p>He heard the headsman step nearer; he set his teeth.</p>

  <p>The axe struck cleanly; the blood was over all of them, and the vizard
  with the light wig held up by the long grey curls the head which had bounded
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>'God save the people of England!' said Colonel Hacker.</p>

  <p>A deep and awful groan broke from the multitude, and the soldiers,
  hitherto immovable, turned about in all directions, clearing the streets.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-01"
     id="ch4-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE CROWNING MERCY</h2>

  <p class="first">On a soft golden blue day in September 1651 a crowd was
  gathered in the streets of London&mdash;a crowd vast and as excited as that
  which had waited to hear the verdict on Lord Strafford, or had thronged to
  witness the awful scene outside Whitehall when the King knelt before the
  headsman.</p>

  <p>On both these occasions the people were awestruck and silenced. Now they
  were triumphant openly, rejoicing almost light-heartedly; the King had died a
  traitor's death and the skies had not fallen; other great men had followed
  him in his final fate, and none had avenged them. The present Charles
  Stewart, called the King of Scots since his coronation at Scone, was flying
  the country, a proscribed fugitive; the Commonwealth, proclaimed after the
  death of the late King, was a year and a half old and had shown no signs of
  weakness nor unstability, and to-day the people were got together to welcome
  home the Lieutenant-General, Oliver Cromwell, who was returning after having
  subdued Ireland and Scotland as those Islands had never yet been subdued.</p>

  <p>Fire and sword had swept Ireland from coast to coast; Cromwell had not
  spared the enemies of the Lord, as Drogheda could witness, Papist priests had
  been hanged or knocked on the head, Papist garrisons massacred, Papist
  peasants transported, Papist gentry forbidden their religion, and driven from
  their estates into the desolate regions of Connaught.</p>

  <p>Next, he turned against Scotland, where the second Charles, having
  denounced the faith of his father, and the religion of his mother, having
  taken the Covenant (submitting in a moment to those things which the late
  King had died rather than yield to), was setting up once more the standard of
  the Stewarts.</p>

  <p>Cromwell (now Lord-General, for Fairfax, too cold and meticulous for these
  times, had retired) met the Scots at Dunbar and beat Lord Leven and David
  Leslie as thoroughly as he had beaten Hamilton at Preston, and with troops as
  tired, hungry, and outnumbered, as they had been hungry and outnumbered then.
  Dunbar Drove they called this, as they had called the other Preston Rout.</p>

  <p>Both were mighty victories.</p>

  <p>Then, a year later, on the 3rd of September, the anniversary of Dunbar,
  Cromwell, supported by Lambert and Harrison, marched to meet another invading
  army of Scots headed by the young Charles, and on the banks and bridges of
  the Severn and in the streets of Worcester city, beat them again, ruining
  completely the cause of the young Stewart, who watched the day from the
  cathedral tower, then fled, hopeless, not to Scotland, but beyond seas, this
  time to seek an asylum at his sister's court.</p>

  <p>That was the end of it. Cromwell had subdued kings and kingdoms; there was
  no one left to lead any army across the Border or ships across St. George's
  Channel, and neither of the sister islands would be likely to attempt to
  measure swords with England again. There were no more gallant Cavaliers to
  rise up for a lost cause. Montrose had been hanged in Edinburgh, and the
  young King for whom he died had repudiated him almost before the heroic soul
  had left the gallant body. Hamilton, Capel, Holland, Derby, had suffered on
  the block, kissing the axe that had slain their master; the rest were beyond
  seas, in exile and poverty, or in their own country outnumbered, forlorn,
  impoverished, and silenced.</p>

  <p>And the man who had thus achieved the triumphs of his cause and his
  beliefs, the soldier who had been victorious in every engagement he had
  undertaken, whose enthusiasm, fire, and faith had heartened his party when
  even the bravest had been daunted, was the man who was riding into London
  to-day, welcomed by salvos of artillery and pealing of bells.</p>

  <p>Five of the foremost members of Parliament had ridden out to meet him on
  his march. One of the royal palaces, that of Hampton, had been given him as a
  residence; he enjoyed now a grant of nearly six thousand a year, and in his
  train, as he entered London, were many of the noblest in the country, and
  with him rode the Lord Mayor, the Speaker, the Council of State, the
  Aldermen, and Sheriffs.</p>

  <p>With a modesty that was absolutely unaffected he declined all credit for
  his overwhelming victories; and with a simplicity some mistook for irony (but
  irony was not in his nature), he remarked of the huge multitude which had
  gathered to see him pass; 'There would be even more to see me hanged,' so
  exactly did he value the popular favour, and so completely was he aware of
  the peril of the height on which he stood.</p>

  <p>When the triumphal entry was over and evening was closing in, he turned at
  last to his own home.</p>

  <p>One sadness marred the return; Henry Ireton had died in Ireland, worn out
  by the fatigues of the strenuous campaign which had more than once laid the
  Lord-General himself on a bed of sickness, and Bridget Ireton was shut into
  her house, mourning her lord, whose body was being brought home for burial in
  the Abbey Church at Westminster.</p>

  <p>The rest were all there to welcome him; his mother, his wife, his son
  Richard, now at last wedded to Dorothy Mayor (Henry was still in Ireland,
  doing good work there), Elisabeth Claypole and her husband, and the two
  unmarried girls, Mary and Frances.</p>

  <p>The women wept, in their enthusiasm and joyful relief. Elisabeth Claypole
  hung on his breast in a passion of tears, so completely did the sadness of
  the world overwhelm her sensitive heart in any moment of emotion.</p>

  <p>Almost her first words were to ask his kindness towards the poor Irish who
  were being sent to Jamaica and Barbadoes as slaves. After all Cromwell's
  victories his favourite daughter's delicate voice had risen with the same
  appeal; 'Be merciful, be pitiful&mdash;spare the prisoners!'</p>

  <p>'Why do you weep, Betty?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Because she is a foolish wench,' said her husband good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>'Nay,' said Elisabeth Cromwell, what doth your old poet say&mdash;"pity
  runneth soon in a gentle heart" and we have had to bear some straining
  anxieties.'</p>

  <p>'And we have heard awful reports,' murmured Mrs. Claypole, smiling through
  her tears with that simple archness which her father loved, 'however he might
  contemn her carnal mind. 'Blood&mdash;nothing but blood was spoken of, until
  my dreams were coloured red.'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' said old Mrs. Cromwell, with the vagueness of her great age. 'Hast
  thou not slain the children of the Scarlet Woman by tens of thousands? I
  heard that at Drogheda thou didst close the blasphemous idolaters into their
  own church, and there burn them, as an offering of sweet savour in the
  nostrils of the Lord.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell glanced at his daughter Elisabeth, and answered nothing; the
  cries of the burning Papists echoed sometimes in his own heart for all his
  stern exaltation in slaying the enemies of God. For a moment his brow
  clouded, but the subject was swept away and forgotten in the congratulations,
  questions, and answers of Mr. Claypole and Richard Cromwell. The times were
  still momentous, even perilous; now there was peace what would they and all
  the other men of England do?</p>

  <p>While the Lord-General talked with these two, the women took the old
  gentlewoman to her room; she could hardly walk now and her senses were
  failing, the Bible was constantly in her hands, and she spoke of little else
  but her son.</p>

  <p>When she had reached the chamber set apart for her, she got into her chair
  by the window and looked at the sunset a little, half-dozing and talking to
  herself, then she roused suddenly and asked Mrs. Claypole, who tenderly
  remained with her, to 'Fetch your father, child, fetch your father. I have
  had little of him but the pain of his absences, and I would see him now!'</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole, light-footed and delicate in her glimmering white and
  blue silks, sped on her errand, taking with her some of the last late roses
  with which she had adorned her grandmother's room.</p>

  <p>When she gave her message she slipped the stems of two of them through the
  buttonhole of her father's dusty uniform. Their gay beauty looked incongruous
  enough on his sober attire, but though his lips chid her, his eyes smiled,
  and he let the blossoms remain.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell was wondering, in sentences half-awed, half-vexed, how
  she should keep house in a great place like Hampton Court?&mdash;how many
  servants must she have, and how could they use such a number of rooms?</p>

  <p>'We will come and stay with thee,' said Dorothy, Richard's wife, who was
  not averse to her share of her father-in-law's splendour. Her pretty face was
  very bright and smiling to-day above the demure fall of her lawn collar, and
  her gown was new silk, embroidered in a fashion not uncourtly; her husband,
  too, was habited with a richness beyond his father's. The Lord-General had
  not failed to mark his son's wide, Spanish boots, fringed breeches, grey
  cloth passemented with rose-colour, and Malines lace collar and fall. It did
  not please him, for he took it as another indication of that weakness and
  levity which he had before suspected, with a terrible pang, in his eldest
  surviving son.</p>

  <p>He made no reply to Dorothy Cromwell, but followed his daughter to her
  grandmother's room.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell crossed the room, which was dark and plain, but full of
  the odour of dry rose leaves and lavender and camphire, and stood before his
  mother who sat by the window, a small shrivelled gentlewoman in a hooded
  chair.</p>

  <p>She lifted her blurred eyes and held out her two little hands to him; he
  kissed them, and then as Elisabeth Claypole left them he broke forth,
  'Mother, I am tired, tired.'</p>

  <p>He rested his sick head against the mullions and gazed up at the little
  strip of sky, glorious with floating clouds of light, visible above the
  houses opposite.</p>

  <p>'How is it with thee, my son Oliver?' she asked. 'Thou art come in triumph
  with much acclaim, but hast thou within the peace of God, which passeth all
  understanding?'</p>

  <p>He answered with a fervour and a quickness which was like the passion of
  self-justification yet ennobled by his usual enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'I have followed the pillar of cloud by day,' he answered, 'the pillar of
  fire by night. I have disregarded the wind and the whirlwind, and I have
  listened for the still small voice. <i>I believe God hath been with me
  because of the victories I have had</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Surely,' replied Mrs. Cromwell, 'He hath witnessed for thee as He
  witnessed against the King. Is not this fight at Worcester spoken of on all
  tongues as the crowning mercy?'</p>

  <p>The Lord-General continued to look at the sky which was fast paling from
  flame tints into a burning paleness, like gold in a furnace, thrice
  refined.</p>

  <p>'For nine years I have laboured,' he said, 'and not once hath the Lord put
  me down. Yet sometimes the voice will fail, sometimes the Sign will not
  come&mdash;sometimes I even seem to fall from grace&mdash;sometimes I wonder
  why I ever left obscurity. Yet the Lord called me! I will maintain
  it&mdash;He held up my hands and made me His instrument! I have been one with
  the Spirit; I say it was God's work, for He did not put me down! Now, it were
  better that I should lay aside my high office and return to what I was.'</p>

  <p>'It were better,' said the old gentlewoman; 'but can England spare you
  yet? For me, I would rather die where I have lived than amid these
  splendours.'</p>

  <p>'I will go back to my own place,' continued Oliver Cromwell. 'I have done
  what God set me to do&mdash;I have swept the enemy from the land, I have seen
  the tyrant slain, and his children exiled. When shall the young man Charles
  Stewart, get another army? Nay, when he fled from Worcester city, he fled
  from his throne for ever; his forces are scattered and no captain out of
  Egypt shall ever get them together again. I say the land is purged, and what
  work is there for me?'</p>

  <p>He was silent a moment, then he added, 'I am weary and still something
  sick.'</p>

  <p>These recent sicknesses of his troubled him; he could not understand the
  fault for which this weakness had been laid on him. Following out his own
  thoughts he broke into speech again.</p>

  <p>As for Drogheda, <i>I say it was in the heat of action</i>, and were they
  not Papists, blasphemous idolaters whose hands were red with the blood of
  God's poor people? <i>It was in the heat of action</i>! What was that little
  moment compared to the torments of hell they have earned? When they were shut
  up in the church and the flames were getting hold on them, I heard one
  say&mdash;"God damn me, God confound me, I burn!" That is God's judgment. God
  <i>hath</i>, damned him&mdash;to the flame that is never quenched and the
  worm that never dieth! Poor clay am I, but a reed He breatheth
  through.&mdash;shall I be blamed for His vengeance against Drogheda? Nay, no
  more than I shall be praised for His victories at Dunbar and
  Worcester&mdash;when He was pleased to make use of a certain poor thing of
  mine, nay, a little invention, the army.'</p>

  <p>The ancient gentlewoman leant forward and stroked his sleeve with her
  pallid hand thickened with heavy veins. She had an instinct that he required
  comforting in this the highest moment of his glory.</p>

  <p>He still wore his buff riding coat, his dusty boots, his plain
  sword-thread and sword; surely no victorious general had ever returned to
  take his triumph in such attire. No order, no ornament distinguished him from
  the meanest of his fellow-citizens; his features, always heavy, were slightly
  swollen and slightly suffused, his eyes most deeply lined and shadowed; there
  was as much grey as brown now in the locks that fell to his shoulders, and a
  general sadness was in his expression, his pose, the tone of his rough
  voice.</p>

  <p>His little mother continued to anxiously stroke his cloth sleeve and to
  gaze up at him with those failing eyes which saw neither marks of age nor
  fatigue, saw neither plainness nor ill-health, but only <i>her</i> son in the
  glory of his matchless achievement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-02"
     id="ch4-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE TALK IN ST. JAMES'S PARK</h2>

  <p class="first">The Council of State had done well; great names were among
  the members. Sir Harry Vane had devoted his patriotism and his great gifts to
  the administration of the navy, which was under the command of William Blake,
  already as renowned at sea as Cromwell on the land; the naval war with the
  United Provinces was already taxing the resources of the infant Commonwealth,
  and so far all had acquitted themselves with honour and distinction.</p>

  <p>Rupert and his roving pirate ships had been swept from the seas, Deane and
  Monk kept an iron hand on Scotland, Fleetwood and Ludlow completed the bloody
  conquest of Ireland. Outwardly the new Republic might well present a uniform
  and solid appearance; but within it seethed with confusion.</p>

  <p>The main cause of the two civil wars and the execution of the
  King&mdash;ecclesiastical questions&mdash;was still in abeyance; nothing was
  settled in Church or State. Nor were the finances of the country in a hopeful
  condition; neither the Church lands nor the King's lands nor all the revenues
  formerly given to royalty served to pay the expenses of the Dutch War.
  Cromwell's dreams of retirement vanished; urged from within by his own eager
  soul and from without by the appeals of those who could not bear their
  burdens without his help, he remained in the forefront of affairs, the leader
  of the army in name and fact, a figure slightly enigmatical, needed by all
  and by some feared.</p>

  <p>He was not without his enemies. Edmund Ludlow, on one of his visits to
  London, told him frankly that the extreme Puritans could not forget his
  attempt to come to terms with the late King, and the extreme moderates could
  not forget his execution of the mutineers at Ware.</p>

  <p>The last time Ludlow and Cromwell had crossed words Cromwell had ended the
  argument by hurling a cushion at his opponent's head. Now he answered mildly
  and declared that the Lord was bringing to pass through him what He had
  promised in the 110th Psalm; he expounded this theory for an hour, and Ludlow
  was silenced by rhetoric if not convinced by reason.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cromwell, whether he silenced his critics by oratory or hurled
  cushions, went his way without heeding any of them; sometimes mildly,
  sometimes in sudden gusts of temper, sometimes in strange exalted excitements
  he pursued a policy which, however obscure and vague it might seem to others,
  was clear as crystal and bright as flame to him.</p>

  <p>The feeling between the army and the remnant of Charles' last Parliament
  still ruling at Westminster became again restless and intense; all men began
  to see that the present Government was, and could be nothing else, but
  provisional. A date, three years off, was fixed for the dissolution of the
  present Parliament, and Cromwell called a conference between the chief
  lawyers and the chief captains, to whom he offered two vital questions;
  Should they have a republic or a monarchy? if a monarchy, who was to be
  King?</p>

  <p>The Parliament men were mostly for a monarchy, the army men for a
  republic; Desborough and Whalley were especially strong for that.</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell was not with them; he had never been at heart republican;
  but he said little, and the conference broke up, as the others had done,
  without solving a single difficulty.</p>

  <p>Sometime after the Lord-General, coming from his luminous obscurity where
  he gleamed, keeping all men in an uncertainty as to his wishes and his
  intentions, asked the Lord Whitelocke, lawyer and Parliament man, to attend
  him in his walking in the Park, and to there discuss with him the
  unsettlement and turmoil of the State.</p>

  <p>It was a day in November; the brambles in the hedges had sparse
  fox-coloured leaves; the trees in the orchard and orchery ground were bare;
  the elms and oaks were hung with thin scattered gold leaves against a pale
  blue and frosty sky; the ground was hard with a thin ice in the ruts where
  yesterday had been mud; above the empty Palace, which might be plainly
  glimpsed through the bare trees, a solitary white cloud floated, like a
  forlorn banner. The Lord-General often looked at this cloud while he spoke;
  he had a habit of gazing much at the sky.</p>

  <p>He wore a black suit and grey worsted hose, broad leathern shoes with wide
  steel buckles, sword, band, collar, and hat as plain as might be. There was
  nothing about his person to indicate the profession which he represented; he
  was in every way as plain as the plain lawyer to whom he talked. He opened
  with what was in his mind, but gently, indirectly and vaguely, after his
  usual manner.</p>

  <p>'Where is the cause? Where is this for which we all fought? Lord
  Whitelocke, did so many poor people die to this end? Was the glorious climax
  of the war, the death of the tyrant to lead to no better conclusion than
  this? Hath the Lord led us out of Egypt to abandon us now? Truly, sir, I do
  not think it, yet I ask you where is the cause? I say that the cause is
  overlaid with jars, with jealousies, with confusion, and this must not be.
  The Lord will not have it&mdash;it is not as it should be, sir, in a
  Commonwealth.'</p>

  <p>Bulstrode Whitelocke hesitated a moment and struck at the frozen ground
  with his cane; he was a shrewd, prosaic man, a keen lawyer, and a fearless
  patriot. After his little pause he resolved on boldness; his quick, direct
  speech was a contrast to Cromwell's involved phrases.</p>

  <p>'The peril we are in, sir, cometh from the arrogance of the army, from
  their high pretensions and unruly ways and desire for dominance.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-General gave him a long glance.</p>

  <p>'Say you so?' he returned mildly. 'Yet methinks they are a lovely company,
  worthy of all honour.'</p>

  <p>'They have had all honour and all profit too,' returned Whitelocke grimly,
  'and now they would have all power as well, under your favour, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' returned Cromwell, 'this is not so. The army is the poor instrument
  by which the Lord saved England; they did some little service at
  Naseby&mdash;at Preston&mdash;at Dunbar and Winchester, and though I dare say
  they would sooner die than take any of the glory of these mercies, yet the
  Lord chose them as His instruments, and that must be accounted to them as an
  honour. Sir, the army hath laboured much, sweated in your service; sir,
  without the army'&mdash;he pointed to Whitehall&mdash;'that Palace would now
  be the dwelling-place of the young man, Charles Stewart. I pray you consider
  these things.'</p>

  <p>'Yet I repeat,' insisted the Lord Whitelocke, who was voicing the feeling
  of the entire Parliament and a great portion of the nation, 'that the army is
  the cause of these present jars&mdash;their imperious carriage is hard to be
  borne, sir, and from it arises the confusions and jealousies which oppress
  us. As to their merits, the Council of State hath done somewhat too&mdash;the
  war with the Dutch&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Because of this war my spirit hath groaned!' interrupted Cromwell.
  'Should there not rather be a union between two Protestant republics than
  war? And what do not you spend on it? All that which you have gained from
  King and bishops. I say it were more befitting us, as Christians and
  Englishmen, to have peace with the Dutch.'</p>

  <p>Whitelocke refused to be drawn into this argument. He returned to his
  point.</p>

  <p>'The Council of State rule well and wisely&mdash;the people uphold
  them.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, do they?' interrupted the Lord-General, in a very decided tone. 'I
  tell you this, Mr. Whitelocke, I have been up and down the country and heard
  the opinions of many men, and I say that most, and the best of them, do
  loathe the Parliament.'</p>

  <p>'Where is this leading?' asked the lawyer sharply.</p>

  <p>'Ay, where?' repeated Cromwell. 'There are the people new come from civil
  strife unheard of, and ye lay on them the great burden of a foreign war; ye
  settle nothing and strive after nothing but to prolong your own sitting.
  There are scandalous members among you&mdash;ay, I know it
  well&mdash;self-seekers, drunkards, men of lewd life. I say it is not well
  these should be uncontrolled in power, therefore I spoke for a king or for
  one with a king's authority. They have none to check them, they do as they
  will, they are slow, they are idle, they meddle in private matters; it will
  not do. Let them look to their authority, which is on high; let them seek God
  painfully.'</p>

  <p>He spoke with passion now, but also with a certain weariness, as if he was
  oppressed with great thoughts and slowly struggled to the outward expression
  of them.</p>

  <p>'You are a soldier and therefore impatient,' returned Whitelocke quietly.
  'The Parliament is slow&mdash;but that is within human reason.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-General turned and looked at him grimly.</p>

  <p>'There is another thing which is not within human reason, which is that
  this Commonwealth should stand without a master set over the Parliament.'</p>

  <p>'How may one do that?' demanded the lawyer sharply, 'when the Parliament
  is itself the authority from which we derive ours?'</p>

  <p>'That is a formal difficulty,' replied Cromwell impatiently. 'Do you think
  I should be stopped by nice points of law?'</p>

  <p>Whitelocke marked the pronoun the soldier had used.</p>

  <p>'Would you withstand the Parliament?' he asked keenly. 'They are your
  masters.'</p>

  <p>'They are no man's masters; they are means to an end,' replied Cromwell. I
  am a poor thing, but the Lord hath made some use of me these ten years
  past&mdash;yea, a little use. He hath been pleased to appoint me to do a few
  things for him, some little work, and I will do it, despite Parliament as I
  did and despite a king. I say we will have righteousness and justice; if need
  be these men can be put down as the tyrant was put down, and the poor and
  simple be cared for and the groans of the needy heard.'</p>

  <p>'These are stern words,' said Whitelocke; 'and how will you justify
  them?'</p>

  <p>'God will justify them,' replied the Lord-General, as He hath hitherto
  upheld what I have said in His name. What was I? What did I know of armies or
  of the battalion? Yet the Lord said, "Be thou ruler, even among Mine
  enemies," and sent me forth to conquer kings and princes. And we were but a
  handful and they gentlemen. Yet we did it. "With His own right hand and with
  His holy arm hath He gotten Himself the victory!" And now I am bidden to
  labour still in His cause and to go forward&mdash;and do you think that poor
  remnant sitting at Westminster shall hinder me?'</p>

  <p>The Lord Whitelocke was silent; he was rather startled at what he took to
  be the kernel of Cromwell's speech&mdash;his enmity to the
  Parliament&mdash;and he was not deceived by the gentleness and
  self-effacement of the Lord-General, who, he knew, was indeed capable of
  doing away with the Parliament as he and his had done away with the King. And
  there was now, as always, the great fact to be remembered and reckoned with
  that Cromwell had behind him the army of his own creation, that fierce
  military whose enthusiasm was not much curbed or checked by regard for mere
  formal institutions and laws of men's framing.</p>

  <p>'In very deed,' he replied, 'your power and the power behind you is too
  high. How can we withstand it?'</p>

  <p>'My power, such as it be,' returned the soldier mildly, 'cometh from God
  and the People. Be assured that if I use it for other than the glory of one
  and the good of the other it will pass from me. I say this because meseemeth
  you have fear of the army, poor souls; but I did not open this talk for any
  matter of argument with thee, but rather in a friendly spirit to discuss the
  present jars.'</p>

  <p>'You have discussed them to good purpose, sir,' returned Whitelocke dryly.
  'I perceive that you look upon the Parliament and the Council of State with
  and mistrust.'</p>

  <p>'I think,' replied Cromwell, still gazing at the pale cloud floating in
  the pale sky over Whitehall, 'that we need a Governor over this England.'</p>

  <p>'Where is he to be found?' demanded Whitelocke.</p>

  <p>'The Lord will bring such an one forward in His good leisure,' said
  Cromwell.</p>

  <p>Whitelocke liked this speech still less than those which had gone before
  it; he thought it meant that the Lord-General intended in truth to set
  himself against the Parliament.</p>

  <p>'Who will be your Governor of England?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Who can resolve that question?' said Cromwell evasively.</p>

  <p>'What is your proposal to solve the present difficulties?' was
  Whitelocke's next question. He was determined that he would, if possible,
  gain something definite from the present conversation.</p>

  <p>The Lord-General made no answer, and they walked on slowly and in silence.
  The very last leaves were scattered from the boughs overhead on to the frosty
  ground at their feet, and a little low, sharp wind was blowing across the
  city.</p>

  <p>Bulstrode Whitelocke waited for the Lord-General's answer. Himself a
  moderate man, to a point he was wholly with Cromwell's tolerance and
  large-mindedness; but when Cromwell's moderation suddenly culminated in
  daring action, then Whitelocke refused to follow him. He had been one of the
  most active of those who had endeavoured to frame a treaty with the late
  King, and had warmly supported Cromwell's attempts to bring Charles to a
  compromise; but he had refused to sit in the High Court of Justice that had
  tried and condemned the King. So now he felt that they were again reaching a
  crisis when he could not support any longer the man whom he so sincerely
  admired.</p>

  <p>But the Lord-General would not any further disclose himself, and when
  Whitelocke was about to press for a reply he caused a distraction by pausing
  and pointing to a gentleman walking near the archery fields, to which they
  had now nearly approached.</p>

  <p>'I know his face, who is he?' asked Cromwell.</p>

  <p>Bulstrode Whitelocke, somewhat vexed at this abrupt change of subject,
  answered briefly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'He is the Latin Secretary to the Council of State.'</p>

  <p>'Ah,' said the Lord-General, 'a very worthy citizen. I have heard of him.
  From the first he hath given his testimony to the good cause. I would there
  were many more such among you.'</p>

  <p>By this, the person of whom he spoke drew near, and seeing the two
  gentlemen, and knowing Whitelocke and recognizing Cromwell, he stopped and
  bowed.</p>

  <p>Cromwell turned towards him, and Whitelocke had no choice but to do
  likewise.</p>

  <p>'You are the Latin Secretary,' said the Lord-General. 'You have written
  much in defence of the cause. I have often sought an occasion to speak to
  you.'</p>

  <p>The gentleman thus addressed bowed in some confusion like one overwhelmed
  by a great honour.</p>

  <p>'Do you know me?' asked Cromwell.</p>

  <p>'I do, my Lord-General,' was the reply, given in a sweet musical voice.
  'What lover of truth and freedom doth not?&mdash;"My lord fighteth the
  battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days."'</p>

  <p>He spoke with a warm sincerity which raised his words above the suspicion
  of flattery, and a flush overspread his naturally pallid features.</p>

  <p>There was something about his person and manner wholly attractive; in his
  youth (he was now in middle age) he must have been of a beauty almost
  feminine, and his traits still had a frail and delicate comeliness; his large
  dark blue eyes were fatigued and heavy lidded as if swollen with overuse, and
  his pale cheek and the brow shaded by the long locks of brown hair bore
  traces of sickness and anxiety; his figure was slender and noble, and his
  black clothes were fine in quality; his whole appearance was of an elegance
  wholly lacking to the Lord-General's person; indeed, for all the sobriety of
  his attire, he appeared more like one of the unfortunate Cavaliers than one
  of the most vigorous champions of the Independents, the author of
  <i>Eikonoclastes</i>.</p>

  <p>'I thank you, Mr. Milton,' replied Cromwell. 'I hope we may be better
  acquainted. You have laboured much and your reward halts, but I believe you
  have that greatness in you which is pleased to serve England without
  fee.'</p>

  <p>'For the little that I do I am even overpaid,' replied John Milton, with a
  deepening of his boyish flush.</p>

  <p>The glance of the two men met, and a look flashed between them as if they
  were wholly one in spirit; then the Secretary bowed again, and each went his
  way.</p>

  <p>'The Council have bidden him write an answer to Salmasius' work,' said
  Whitelocke. 'He calls it <i>A Defence of the People of England</i>&mdash;but
  it doth not proceed as quickly as he would wish because his eyes fail him. He
  told me that at times he could hardly see the letters on the paper.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell looked back at the slender, erect figure walking away under the
  bare trees.</p>

  <p>'Thou hast a brave heart if I mistake not,' he murmured. Then he went on
  again, Bulstrode Whitelocke still waiting for him to deliver himself.</p>

  <p>Not until they had almost reached the confines of the Park and the houses
  of Charing Cross did the Lord-General speak.</p>

  <p>Then, turning suddenly to his expectant companion, he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What if a man should take it upon himself to be king?'</p>

  <p>Whitelocke stared, startled beyond concealment.</p>

  <p>Well?' urged Cromwell gently.</p>

  <p>The lawyer, recovering himself, took refuge in the pedantic, formal
  objections offered by the law and the constitution.</p>

  <p>Cromwell listened patiently. When Whitelocke, rather confused and
  breathless, had brought his speech to an end he answered mildly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Neither the law nor the constitution gave authority for the execution of
  a king. Yet we did it. Therefore we may do other things for which there is no
  warrant in charter or Parliament roll, but for which the warrant cometh from
  God. Yet for the moment I have no more to say.'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4-03"
     id="ch4-03"></a>CHAPTER III. EXIT THE PARLIAMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">During these days the Lord-General and his colleagues,
  Harrison and Lambert, waited much on the Lord, confessing their sinfulness
  and asking for Divine help. Behind them was always the army, demanding
  arrears of pay, work for the poor, and the suppression of the general
  lawlessness of the kingdom; there were many more conferences between the
  lawyers and the soldiers; towards the close of 1652 Cromwell gently, and
  Lambert and Harrison not at all gently, began to say that it was the Lord's
  will that the Parliament should go. Parliament, they declared, should call a
  convention and then abdicate.</p>

  <p>The gentlemen at Westminster, seeing the military saints were in earnest,
  set themselves to prepare a scheme of government which should meet the
  approval of the army; the wise and valiant Sir Harry Vane, the younger, drew
  up a bill to provide for a provisional government, the nucleus of which was
  to be the members now sitting, they who had been ever in the forefront of the
  fight since that fight had begun.</p>

  <p>This scheme to give perpetuity to a body which they wished to completely
  abolish only further exasperated the army; Cromwell and Harrison pushed
  forward their own bill.</p>

  <p>On the 19th of April, Vane and Cromwell and their several supporters held
  another conference in the suite of apartments in Whitehall Palace, now given
  to the Lord-General, at which both parties agreed to stay their hands until
  the discussion should be resumed and brought to some conclusion. The next day
  Cromwell was more cheerful than had been usual with him of late; he loved
  polemics and to measure his rhetoric with others; yesterday's long argument
  with Sir Harry Vane had enlivened him; he looked forward to a resumption of
  the conference and to a final triumph for the Cause; he had recently communed
  much with himself, brooded and considered in his soul, and he was convinced
  that God had further work for him; part of that work he believed to be to
  settle the nation&mdash;and not by way of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>That morning as he was at breakfast with Lambert and Harrison an abrupt
  end was put to his tranquillity and satisfaction.</p>

  <p>News was brought that the Parliament had assembled early and were hurrying
  through Sir Harry Vane's bill.</p>

  <p>The Lord-General sank at once into gloomy silence, while the other two
  soldiers heavily condemned the perfidy of the Parliament men.</p>

  <p>'I will not believe it,' said Cromwell at last. Nay, I will not believe
  falsehood of Sir Harry Vane.'</p>

  <p>'But maybe,' suggested Major-General Harrison, 'his followers have got
  beyond Sir Harry and done this thing despite him.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' returned the Lord-General. I believe it not.'</p>

  <p>'You are too slow to move!' cried Harrison, with some heat. If it had not
  been for your hesitation there would have been no Parliament to defy the poor
  toilers in God's cause.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-General pushed his tankard away from him.</p>

  <p>'You are one,' he answered, who will not wait the Lord's leisure, but
  would hurry into that which afterwards honest men must repent.'</p>

  <p>'You have waited the Lord's leisure too long,' said Harrison. 'Much delay
  is not good.'</p>

  <p>'When the Lord speaks, I obey,' answered Cromwell, with some grimness;
  'and then my actions are as swift as any man's, yea, even as thine,
  Major-General Harrison. I have given some poor testimony to that effect.'</p>

  <p>'Meanwhile,' put in Lambert, 'the miserable remnant at Westminster are
  making their bill law&mdash;and where are we? Even made a mock of and
  slighted.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke another messenger arrived, and close on his heels a third, to
  say that the Parliament were in very deed pushing through Sir Harry Vane's
  bill.</p>

  <p>Then Cromwell rose.</p>

  <p>'"Up, Lord, and help me, O my God,"' he said, '"for Thou smitest all mine
  enemies upon the cheek-bone&mdash;Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly!"
  Now is the time&mdash;yea, even now.' He turned to Harrison. 'Come with me to
  Westminster and let us testify to God.'</p>

  <p>He called for his hat; he wore his black coat and his grey worsted
  stockings and a plain neck-band.</p>

  <p>As he was leaving Whitehall he ordered a guard of soldiers to accompany
  him, and marched down to Westminster with them behind him, as Charles had
  marched with his armed followers from the same Palace to the same Parliament
  eleven years before.</p>

  <p>When they reached Westminster Hall he left the file of muskets in the
  outer room, and he and his two generals passed to their usual places in the
  Commons.</p>

  <p>There were about sixty members present; at the silent entrance of the
  three soldiers all looked round and about them, and some shifted in their
  places and whispered to their neighbours.</p>

  <p>'I see Old Noll's red nose,' said one as Cromwell entered; 'we are like to
  have a tempest.'</p>

  <p>But the Lord-General went quietly to his seat, as did his two companions;
  and the members, whatever trepidation they might feel, displayed none, but
  continued their debate, preparatory to passing Sir Harry Vane's bill.</p>

  <p>Cromwell listened, his arms folded, his head bent on his breast; the sweet
  April sunshine filled the chamber with a pleasant haze in which the motes
  danced; Sir Harry Vane looked often at the Lord-General as if he would find
  an opportunity to excuse himself for his seeming breach of faith; indeed, his
  supporters had taken the matter out of his hands and forced the bill on,
  whether he would or no; but Cromwell sat glooming, and would not meet his
  eye.</p>

  <p>The discussion proceeded, moderate, orderly; presently the Lord-General
  called to Major-General Harrison, who sat opposite to him on the other side
  of the House, to come to him.</p>

  <p>'Methinks,' said Cromwell grimly, looking about him, 'this Parliament is
  rife for a dissolution&mdash;and that this is the time for doing it.'</p>

  <p>Harrison, impetuous as he was, was startled by this; he might urge
  Cromwell to action, and blame his slowness, but when Cromwell was roused
  Harrison, like any other, was alarmed.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied Harrison, lowering his voice (for their conversation was
  being observed with suspicion), 'this work is very great and dangerous,
  therefore, seriously consider of it, before you engage in it.'</p>

  <p>'You say well,' replied Cromwell, and lapsed into moody silence again.
  Harrison took the seat next him, Lambert being near.</p>

  <p>The members, though still outwardly tranquil, hastened the debate, and in
  a short while the question for passing the bill was about to be put.</p>

  <p>Then Cromwell moved, and, leaning sideways to Harrison, touched him on the
  arm and said, 'This is the time; I must do it'; and then he suddenly stood
  up, taking off his hat, and throwing out his right hand, he addressed the
  members with great passion.</p>

  <p>'What heart have ye for the public good,' he cried&mdash;'ye who support
  the corrupt interest of presbytery and that of the lawyers, who are the props
  of tyranny and oppression? This is a time of rebuke and chastening, but as
  the Lord liveth, we will have neither rebuke nor chastening from such as
  you!'</p>

  <p>The members, swept into silence by the suddenness and violence of his
  speech, made no reply; all eyes were fixed on him as he stood on the floor of
  the House, his face flushed and his eyes fiery under the lowering brows.</p>

  <p>'What do ye care for but power?' he flung at them, and his voice rang into
  the farthest corners of the Hall. 'What do you care for but to perpetuate
  that power? As for that Act'&mdash;he pointed to where it lay ready to be
  passed&mdash;'you have been forced to it, and I dare affirm that you never
  designed to observe it! I say your time has come; the Lord hath done with
  you&mdash;He has chosen more worthy instruments for the carrying on of His
  work&mdash;I say He will have no more paltering and fumbling with traps and
  toys of the ungodly!'</p>

  <p>Here Sir Peter Wentworth got to his feet amid a hum of approbation.</p>

  <p>'This is the first time,' he declared, red in the face, 'that ever I heard
  such unbecoming language in Parliament&mdash;and it is the more horrid as it
  comes from the servant of the Parliament, and a servant whom Parliament hath
  so highly trusted&mdash;yea, and so highly obliged,' he added, with
  meaning.</p>

  <p>But he could get out no more. Cromwell stepped into the midst of the House
  and waved his hand contemptuously.</p>

  <p>'Come, come!' he cried. I will put an end to your prating!'</p>

  <p>Then, stamping his feet and clapping on his hat as he saw several rise in
  a tumult to answer him, he said in a loud, stern voice, 'You are no
  Parliament&mdash;I say you are no Parliament! I will put an end to your
  sitting!'</p>

  <p>Then, while several tried to speak together and there was a confusion, the
  Lord-General bade the serjeant attending the House open the doors, which he
  did.</p>

  <p>'Call them in,' said Cromwell; call them in.' And Lieutenant-Colonel
  Wolseley, with two files of muskets, entered the House and marched up the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Then Sir Harry Vane, seeing the soldiers, stood up in his place and
  protested loudly&mdash;</p>

  <p>'This is not honest! Yea, it is against morality and common honesty!'</p>

  <p>Cromwell turned round and sorted him with his glance from the press.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Sir Harry Vane! Sir Harry Vane!' he cried. 'The Lord deliver me from
  Sir Harry Vane!'</p>

  <p>Then pointing out another member, he cried, 'There sits a drunkard,' and
  so railed at several separately, ending, 'Are these fit to govern God's poor
  people?'</p>

  <p>The House was now in absolute disorder and confusion, but the
  Lord-General's voice rose above it all.</p>

  <p>His angry eye lit on the mace.</p>

  <p>'What shall we do with this bauble?' he asked, and added, 'There, take it
  away!'</p>

  <p>Major-General Harrison went up to the Speaker.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he said, 'seeing things are reduced to this pass, it is no longer
  convenient for you to remain here.'</p>

  <p>The Speaker answered, 'Unless you force me, I will not come down.'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied Harrison, 'I will lend you my hand.'</p>

  <p>And, so saying, he took hold of him and brought him down.</p>

  <p>Then Cromwell turned again to the Members who were all coming from their
  places.</p>

  <p>'It is you who have forced me to do this!' he cried, with passion, 'for I
  have sought the Lord day and night that He would rather slay me than put me
  on the doing of this work!'</p>

  <p>Turning to Lieutenant-General Wolseley, who commanded the muskets, he
  ordered him to clear the House, which was done, the Members forlornly
  departing under the command of the soldiers, Cromwell sternly watching the
  while.</p>

  <p>And when the benches were all empty he went to the clerk, who was blankly
  and in a bewildered way holding Sir Harry Vane's bill, and, snatching it from
  his hands, put it under his cloak.</p>

  <p>Then ordering the doors to be locked, he went back to Whitehall with
  Lambert and Harrison. But the day's work was not yet complete; he had barely
  reached his headquarters before Lieutenant-General Wolseley came up to say
  that the late Parliament's creation, the Council of State, were sitting as
  usual in the Painted Chamber.</p>

  <p>'Say you so?' replied Cromwell, and he turned back to Whitehall as he had
  turned back to Hampton when he heard of Charles' double dealing.</p>

  <p>Lambert and Harrison accompanied him, and the three swept into the Painted
  Chamber with little ceremony.</p>

  <p>John Bradshaw, the late King's judge, was in the chair; he faced the
  Lord-General as he had faced the unhappy King, with unshaken dignity and
  calm.</p>

  <p>Cromwell was now composed; but he eyed the Councillors fiercely as he
  walked up the room.</p>

  <p>'If you meet here as private persons,' he said, 'you shall not be
  disturbed, but if you meet as a Council of State, this is no place for you,'
  his harsh voice became ominous. 'Since you cannot but know what has just been
  done in the House, take notice that the Parliament is dissolved.'</p>

  <p>The Latin Secretary raised his tired blue eyes with something of
  admiration as well as keen interest in their glance, but Bradshaw replied
  with unmoved sternness, eyeing Cromwell with a directness as uncompromising
  as Cromwell eyed him.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he said, 'we have heard what you did in the House, and before many
  hours all England will hear it. But, sir, you are mistaken to think that the
  Parliament is dissolved&mdash;for no power under Heaven can dissolve them but
  they themselves, therefore take you notice of that.'</p>

  <p>'Ha, Mr. Bradshaw,' returned the Lord-General, 'you may talk and talk, but
  I say that the Lord has done with you and with these others about you. I know
  that you are a person of an upright carriage, who has notably appeared for
  God and for the public good, but I say that your time is over&mdash;other
  means are to be used now, yea, other means!'</p>

  <p>'The means of force and violence,' replied John Bradshaw calmly, 'and to
  them we must submit. I do hot deny that, but your right we shall always deny,
  therefore remember it&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You are no longer a Council of State,' said Cromwell, and none shall any
  longer give heed to you. Go about your several businesses.'</p>

  <p>Bradshaw came down from his place.</p>

  <p>'And with us goes the Commonwealth,' he returned. 'What will you put in
  place of it?'</p>

  <p>'The Lord shall show in His leisure,' said Cromwell sternly, and went from
  the Painted Chamber with Lambert and Harrison after him.</p>

  <p>And so it was over; the Parliament had followed the King; the last remnant
  and pretence of a constitution had been swept away, and a sudden military
  revolution had placed the army at the head of the nation, their leader
  thereby becoming the greatest man in England.</p>

  <p>For, the King gone, the Parliament broken, who was there left for any man
  to look to, save he who had swept away both King and Parliament and now
  stamped angrily out of Westminster Hall?</p>

  <p>Even Harrison had been taken by surprise; he was enthusiastic, as he
  foresaw an uninterrupted reign of God's chosen, those military saints who
  were sacred and purified by their fights for the Lord, but he was also a
  little bewildered as to the course future events must take.</p>

  <p>Lambert merely said, 'This is a difficult business and requires careful
  handling.'</p>

  <p>But Cromwell himself was openly exalted and uplifted; his passion of anger
  gave way to a passion of spiritual enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'This hath been a call from the Lord!' he cried, as the three walked back
  to Whitehall. 'Yea, a direct call! Own it, for it hath been unprojected, and
  is marvellous! This morning did we know of this thing? Nay, and now it is
  done! And this hath been the way the Lord hath dwelt with us from the first.
  He hath kept things from our eyes all along so that we have never seen His
  dispensations beforehand!'</p>

  <p>'Truly,' replied Harrison, 'He hath marvellously witnessed for us, and
  thou hast been as Joshua who scattered the enemies of the Lord at the waters
  of Merom, and chased them even into the valley of Mizpeh, and burnt Hazor
  with fire.'</p>

  <p>'The Edomites, the Ammonites, and the Moabites are scattered,' said
  Lambert, 'but who is now to reign in Israel?'</p>

  <p>'We whom God hath called,' replied Cromwell.</p>

  <p>And so they came to the headquarters of the army at Whitehall, the palace
  of the late King; and the second revolution was complete.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-04"
     id="ch4-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. 'THE NEW ORDER'</h2>

  <p class="first">The rule of the Lord-General and his council of officers,
  governing in a form parliamentary, called 'the Little Parliament' was a
  failure complete and absolute.</p>

  <p>Soldiers could not do the work of lawyers, nor the veterans of Naseby,
  Preston, Dunbar, and Worcester rule England as well as they had defended her.
  Such measures as they carried were totally against the principles and policy
  of their leader, who passed from rapt enthusiasm to sad disillusion, and
  finally to gloomy anger again; the military saints, chosen of the Lord as
  they were, and the very cream of the elect, could not govern England.</p>

  <p>In December 1653, after many consultations with his councils, Cromwell,
  who hesitated to break up another Parliament by force, persuaded the officers
  to hand back their powers to him from whom they had received them.</p>

  <p>The soldiers, though fanatic, narrow, and intolerant, were neither
  self-seeking nor unreasonable; they saw that they were unable to govern the
  country, and that there was only one man who could undertake the task that
  had been too much for them.</p>

  <p>Whether he had the courage, the daring, the firmness to seize this
  position, to step to the front and take the command so completely, to take
  upon himself the burden of rule in the present state of the country, after so
  many attempts at government had failed, was yet to be seen.</p>

  <p>He had hitherto shown no personal ambition and no desire to thrust himself
  forward, his manner being rather to keep himself in the background and wait
  for God to bid him act.</p>

  <p>The moment was serious, perilous, even awful; the Members of the last
  Parliament and the officers met constantly in prayer; conferences, meetings
  between all the able men available, were frequent; the people, sternly and
  austerely ruled for the last three years, with the Puritans triumphant and
  the Cavaliers utterly silenced and suppressed, waited in a quietude that
  concealed an intense excitement.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, the 15th of December, the Lord-General rode from one of
  these meetings to his home, now at Hampton Court. He arrived there bitten
  with the cold and covered with fine snow. He went straight to the fire in the
  room which his family used to dine in, and flung himself with the weariness
  of one spent in mind and body into the great wicker chair with arms and red
  cushions that he commonly used.</p>

  <p>The noble, pleasant room was empty save for Elisabeth, his daughter (the
  Claypoles had a suite of apartments at Hampton Palace), and her youngest
  child, who was asleep on her knee. He had not noticed her at first, so
  quietly was she withdrawn into the shadows, and her low, pleased exclamation,
  'My father!' gave him a little start.</p>

  <p>'Betty!' he impetuously flung out his hand to her; she softly laid the
  sleeping boy on the velvet couch from which she had risen, and, coming to his
  side, knelt beside him, and slipped her hand inside his.</p>

  <p>He gazed with affectionate pleasure at her charming face, bright and
  delicate, sensitive and resolute, lifted to his, the brown, waving hair, the
  expressive blue eyes, the mouth a little wistful, the chin a little proud,
  the whole infinitely dear and loving.</p>

  <p>'What has happened to-day?' she asked gently.</p>

  <p>The look of heaviness her greeting had lightened returned to his
  countenance; he lifted his head and stared into the mellow flames that sprang
  from the great logs between the brass and irons.</p>

  <p>'Betty, it hath come,' he said; 'it is to be laid on me, the burden, yea,
  the whole burden. Mine was the responsibility,' his rough voice rose a
  little. 'I put down the King, I broke the Parliament&mdash;I set up the
  officers who failed (the more blame to me)&mdash;and now it is I who must
  guide the State.'</p>

  <p>'Thou?' murmured Elisabeth.</p>

  <p>'Who else?' he continued moodily, 'who else? It is a call from God and the
  people, and no man could ask for more. Yea, I know the Lord hath called me as
  He called me ten years ago from St. Ives&mdash;this is thy work&mdash;get
  thou up and do it!'</p>

  <p>'Thou&mdash;wilt thou be King?' asked Elisabeth, dropping his hand with a
  shiver of fear.</p>

  <p>'Even so,' he replied sombrely; 'but not with the name of a thing so hated
  shall I be called. Some time ago this came to me as the thing to do&mdash;a
  flash out of a cloud&mdash;then darkness came again; but now it is before me,
  very clearly, that I must be the Governor of England.'</p>

  <p>'It is a high calling and an awful place to hold,' said his daughter.</p>

  <p>'And I am sick in the body, often and often tired in the soul. Thou dost
  know,' he added, with a kind of passion, 'how very, very willing I was to
  retire after Worcester fight; often upon riding the rough ways in Scotland,
  often when sick in Ireland, have I dreamt to come back to a meek, sweet
  retirement, but it was not to be. God sought me out again and bid me go
  forward. And now there is this come upon me. Betty, I shall soon be
  fifty-five years old. I feel myself, in many ways, old. But there is this
  work to do. And it is for England. Yet how shall I prevail where these
  upright and wise ones failed? For they strove earnestly, yet God would not
  have them. Will He forsake me also? "Oh, that I had wings like a dove, then
  would I fly away and be at rest!" Lo, then would I wander far off and remain
  in the wilderness. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and
  tempest!'</p>

  <p>And his head drooped on his breast as if he was discouraged.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth took his inert hand again between her fresh, warm palms.</p>

  <p>'Why should you fear a cold success in this great venture?' she asked.
  'Truly it is a great and awful thing to take a king's place, but shall not
  the Lord still support you as hitherto, and bless you with notable
  victories?'</p>

  <p>Cromwell, still staring into the fire, answered slowly.</p>

  <p>'I have some sparks of the light of His countenance, which keeps me
  alive&mdash;yet I see ahead difficulties greater than any I have yet met.
  What are charges in the field compared to factions in the State? I say the
  saints failed, and shall not I fail? Will not men say to me, as the Hebrew
  said to Moses&mdash;"Who made thee a Prince and a judge over us? Intendest
  thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?"'</p>

  <p>Elisabeth shuddered.</p>

  <p>'Ay, I killed the Egyptian,' continued Cromwell, glooming, 'but there are
  many more out of Egypt ready to take his place, ready to confound us, yea,
  there are plenty of diabolic persons abroad, ready to set snares for the
  godly, even the devil and all his angels are lying in wait to thwart this
  England which the Lord hath elected for His own!'</p>

  <p>'But thou canst meet and conquer them, if it be in the power of any man to
  do so,' returned Elisabeth simply. 'Again I say it is a high and fearful
  thing that thou must undertake, but I know that in all things thou wilt walk
  according to the Gospel.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-General turned to look at her as she knelt beside him in her rosy
  gown with the firelight glowing over her, her face upturned, and her hands
  clasped on the arm of his chair&mdash;a sweet comforter truly, in her
  seriousness and loving encouragement, in her eager belief in him and rapt
  piety.</p>

  <p>'That is not how many will speak of me, Betty,' he said, with a sad
  tenderness. 'Rather will they call me usurper and traitor, and say that I
  have put down others for carnal ambition. Many hard and contemptuous things
  will be said of me, Betty.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' she answered bravely, 'but need we care?' As she spoke, a third
  came down the shadowy room, and joined them&mdash;Elisabeth Cromwell.</p>

  <p>The Lord-General rose and went up to her.</p>

  <p>'You arc tired!' she cried, noting that before all, and she caught his
  arms and peered up into his face tenderly through the dim light.</p>

  <p>'Mother,' said Mrs. Claypole, rising from beside the empty
  chair&mdash;'the new orders are decided upon to-day&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried Cromwell's wife, 'and thou?'</p>

  <p>'My dear, my best,' he said, 'we must live at Whitehall now&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'The king's palace?' she exclaimed, recoiling a little.</p>

  <p>'Yea,' he answered gently, 'for I am called to be the new Governor of this
  country.'</p>

  <p>'Why, that is a fearful thing!' she said, with a half-terrified laugh.
  'Thou wilt never more be safe, nor I at peace!'</p>

  <p>She let go her hold on his sleeves and moved to the fire.</p>

  <p>'I was happier before it all began,' she said abruptly; 'this startles
  me.' She gave again that piteous laugh, which was more like a sob. 'I am too
  old to learn to be a Prince's lady,' she said.</p>

  <p>And she glanced in the mirror above the mantelpiece, looking at her grey
  hair and meek face.</p>

  <p>'I would sooner not put this up in Whitehall for all the world to gape
  at!' she said.</p>

  <p>'Ah, mother!' cried Betty Claypole, and embraced her and kissed her
  hand.</p>

  <p>'Did you not expect this?' asked the Lord-General mournfully. 'I did
  so&mdash;because,' he added, with great simplicity, 'I saw no other fitted
  for the place.'</p>

  <p>'There is no other,' said his daughter. 'He is one and only&mdash;is it
  not so, mother? And thou art one and only, too, dear, and wilt shine in
  Whitehall far higher than the French Queen.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-General turned with a little smile to both of them.</p>

  <p>'By now you should be used to living in a palace,' he said.</p>

  <p>'What will they say of us?' asked Elisabeth Cromwell, still troubled. They
  will say that we have put ourselves up in the King's place.'</p>

  <p>'There is no king,' interrupted Cromwell firmly. 'And as for the place I
  undertake to fill, the whole people have called me to it, yea, the whole
  people.'</p>

  <p>He repeated this statement as if to persuade and convince himself; he well
  knew that his authority came from a very few of the people, mainly from the
  army leaders, and that his election was not the result of a general demand on
  the part of the nation; only the minority had hailed him, the majority
  remained as always, passive, almost indifferent&mdash;or fiercely
  hostile.</p>

  <p>He might be going to rule for the people's sake, purely, but he was not
  going to rule by their wish. He felt this a weakness in his case and strove
  to cover it, even to deceive himself in it; a general election, a genuine
  appeal to the country, might have resulted in bringing in the second Charles
  Stewart, and for the sake of the cause he had not dared risk it. Sir
  Bulstrode Whitelocke, who in many ways represented the average Englishman,
  had pressed Cromwell to call in Charles after the crisis of a year ago, and
  no one knew better than the Lord-General that the three islands seethed with
  royalist plots and the restless intrigues of various fanatical sects. No one
  knew better than he, either, what a target for hatred and rage he would be,
  what undying fury he would arouse, how many and implacable his enemies would
  become.</p>

  <p>His call might be from God, it certainly was not from the people of
  England.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole knew something of all this, and to her there was
  something piteous in the strong man's attempt to belittle his difficulties
  and disguise the narrow basis on which his authority rested.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell broke the thoughtful silence.</p>

  <p>'And thou wilt be Governor of England!' she said. 'Scarcely can I believe
  it.'</p>

  <p>She voiced the incredulity of many; yet the thing was done.</p>

  <p>On the following Friday, His Excellency the Lord-General of the Forces
  became His Highness the Lord-Protector of England, and was installed in that
  office with all ancient ceremonial, formerly used by kings, and kings
  alone.</p>

  <p>There was an installation in the Chancery Court, Westminster Hall, His
  Highness appearing in a richer dress than he had ever worn before, even at
  his son's wedding&mdash;rich velvet, all black, with a band of gold round his
  hat, a fine sword, and sword band.</p>

  <p>So he went in procession from Whitehall and back again, attended by the
  Lord Mayor, the judges, and other dignitaries, in robe of state, outriders,
  running footmen, guards of soldiers, and the usual shouting crowd, half-awed,
  half-jeering, and wholly curious, some wishing confusion to red-nosed Noll
  and some thanking the Lord that He had sent a gracious saint to reign over
  them.</p>

  <p>The serjeants with their maces, the heralds in gold and scarlet,
  proclaimed, at Old Exchange, at Palace Yard, and in other places, Oliver
  Cromwell Lord-Protector, with the same dignity, and ceremony, and shouting as
  Charles Stewart had been proclaimed King. So a change so tremendous was
  accomplished with such little outward difference.</p>

  <p>The new ruler had given his oath of fidelity to the new Constitution (an
  instrument drawn up in four days by the officers, with Lambert at their head)
  and had received the great seal and sword of State. By the afternoon all was
  over, and the man who little more than ten years ago had been a gentleman
  farmer was now sole ruler, dictator, and symbol of one of the greatest
  nations in Europe and foremost champion of the Reformed Religion...</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole (Lady Elisabeth now) slept that next spring in
  Whitehall; the first night she lay on a bed with blue satin curtains brought
  by Henriette Marie from France, and not sold with the King's other effects by
  reason of the fine workmanship of the needlework on them. Elisabeth, who had
  less than any of her family the stern belief in fatalism, which was the
  central doctrine of their austere and heroic creed, and less blind reliance
  on the justice of the Puritan cause, felt a faint horror and a regretful
  remorse at lying among these splendours when the woman to whom they had
  belonged (to whom they still belonged, Elisabeth thought) dwelt in poverty
  and loneliness, unfortunate as Queen and wife.</p>

  <p>That first night she dreamt dismal things, and woke up in the dark,
  oppressed with confused remembrances of the excitement of the day.</p>

  <p>And with other remembrances, more awful; often had she heard an account of
  the execution of the King and listened with horrified and reluctant ears.</p>

  <p>Now, as she sat up in the great bed, shivering in the winter night, she
  pictured, all too clearly, the late King as he had been described to
  her&mdash;the slender figure in the pale blue silk vest, with the George on
  the breast, and the hair gathered up under a white satin cap.</p>

  <p>She thought that she saw him glimmer across the dark, looking down at his
  feet&mdash;he wore the wide shoes with silk roses, which had gone out of
  fashion since his death&mdash;and then at her, smiling bitterly.</p>

  <p>He came, without moving his limbs, gliding to the bed, passed it, rose up
  a man's height from the floor, and disappeared in a shaft of shaking
  light.</p>

  <p>'We are intruders here!' said Elisabeth, cold to the heart. She got out of
  bed (her husband was still asleep; she could hear his even breathing) and
  stood shivering in the keen air.</p>

  <p>A chill like a presage of death crept through her veins; the whole place
  seemed to exhale an air of hate and misery.</p>

  <p>So strong was this feeling that she fumbled for a gown in the dark, and
  stole to the next chamber to look at her infant son.</p>

  <p>The moonlight was in his room, and she saw him sleeping peacefully beside
  his nurse. Elisabeth crept back, dreading lest she should conjure up another
  awful image of the late King.</p>

  <p>'I am not going to be happy here,' she kept saying to herself. 'I am not
  going to be happy here.'</p>

  <p>The next day she did not leave her bed, and before long it was known that
  the Protector's favourite daughter was stricken with a lingering, nameless
  illness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-05"
     id="ch4-05"></a>CHAPTER V. HIS HIGHNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">'Was England ever in a better Way?' demanded the Lord-
  Protector. 'Even under Elisabeth of famous memory (for so we may truly call
  her) was this country more quiet at home, more respected abroad? Nay, there
  is no malignant in the land can say it&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Surely Your Highness hath no need to make any defence to us,' said the
  Lord Lambert, one of his military council. Some number of them and other
  dignitaries were gathered in his apartment at Whitehall, listening to
  him.</p>

  <p>His Highness, who had hitherto been pacing restlessly up and down the
  room, here came to a pause before the table at which the officers and
  councillors sat.</p>

  <p>'I have need to defend myself before all men,' he exclaimed vehemently,
  'for on every hand am I decried and blamed! I speak not of plots against my
  life and such little matters&mdash;the work of a few diabolic persons in the
  pay of Charles Stewart&mdash;but of the great discontent of the Prelatists,
  of the rage of the Papists, of the intolerance of all&mdash;yea, even of the
  sharpness and bitterness of many of God's people who go about saying that the
  ways of Zion are filled with money, that their gold is dim, and that there is
  a sharp wind abroad, but not to cleanse the land.'</p>

  <p>None of the officers offering to speak, Cromwell continued, still in an
  impassioned manner&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Whoever speaks so is wrong! God put me here. My authority is from
  Him&mdash;I will come down for none of them.'</p>

  <p>He went to the window embrasure and stood there, with his back to the
  light, his hat pulled over his brows, his arms folded on his breast, gazing
  at his councillors and friends.</p>

  <p>The Protectorship had lasted over a year, and Cromwell was now as absolute
  as ever any Stewart had dared to be.</p>

  <p>His first Parliament had gone the way of the last of King Charles'; the
  members presuming to question the Instrument by which Cromwell had been
  elected, His Highness had again resorted to the file of soldiers with loaded
  snaphances, and, gathering the expelled members in the Painted Chamber, had
  made them swear fealty to the Instrument and to himself before he permitted
  them to return to their places.</p>

  <p>The immovable Bradshaw, Sir Arthur Haselrig, one of the famous five
  members, and some others refused the oath; the rest took it and went
  back.</p>

  <p>But so impossible was it to combine a military autocracy with the ancient
  methods of civil government, so impossible for soldiers and lawyers to work
  together, that the Parliament again displeased His Highness by revising the
  Instrument into a constitution which His Highness could not accept.</p>

  <p>On the earliest opportunity he dismissed them, and had since ruled
  entirely on his own authority with such help as he might get from the Council
  of officers.</p>

  <p>So when all the ancient landmarks had been carried away, the power of the
  sword remained standing and the army and their general ruled England; it was
  a strange ending to the long, earnest, and bloody struggle, an ending neither
  Pym nor Hampden had ever foreseen, nor Cromwell himself, when the Parliament
  he was afterwards to break had sent him down to Cambridge to raise a troop
  for the defiance of the King.</p>

  <p>In ruling without a Parliament he was doing what Strafford and Charles had
  perished for attempting, in keeping a huge standing army (it was now twice
  the number named in the Instrument) he was doing what no king of England had
  been permitted to do; he had, in fact, the power at which Charles had aimed,
  and he had what Charles had never been able to attain&mdash;the armed force
  to maintain him in that power.</p>

  <p>When he dealt with the Parliament he had used the methods Strafford would
  have used had he dared, and he was ruling now with the absolutism which
  Strafford had always passionately hoped would one day belong to his
  master.</p>

  <p>But what had not been possible to a descendant of many kings, with all
  tradition behind him, had been achieved easily enough by a soldier produced
  by a revolution, who had nothing to rely on but the gifts within himself.</p>

  <p>Cromwell was too clear-sighted not to discern the illogical position he
  was occupying, but it did not disturb him, nor did he find it very wonderful;
  his fatalism (which his enemies termed opportunism) accepted without question
  all that the Lord should be pleased to send; his enthusiasm for the cause of
  liberty disguised, even from himself, the arbitrary nature of his authority,
  and the victorious soldier, who had fought God's battles from Naseby to
  Worcester, was not to be frightened from the position he held by any
  malignant talk of his unlawful right. Nor was the wise patriot and ardent
  statesman to be argued from the point of vantage from whence he could do the
  best for England.</p>

  <p>But the plots, agitations, upheavals, intolerances, and violences about
  him, even among his own one-time friends (some of whom, including the
  lofty-minded Vane, were in the Tower), did shake and trouble him. These, more
  than anything, thwarted him in his honest and strenuous attempt to set up an
  orderly government on the ruins left by the violence of war and the wreckage
  of social upheaval.</p>

  <p>'I will not have intolerance!' he broke out now, suddenly at his Council.
  'I say I will not have it&mdash;let every man who is not a Prelatist or a
  Papist&mdash;who doth not preach licentious doctrines in the name of
  Christ&mdash;let him worship in peace!'</p>

  <p>'In this way many damnable heresies will creep into the land,' answered
  one of the officers.</p>

  <p>'I would rather,' cried His Highness, 'permit Mahometanism in the land
  than have one of God's people persecuted!'</p>

  <p>His Council remained silent; not one of these men agreed with him, and it
  was a notable tribute to the respect and affection they had for him that none
  of them raised a voice in dissent.</p>

  <p>He felt, however, their opposition, as indeed he felt the opposition of
  the entire nation to this dearest of his ideals&mdash;toleration.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if men never would agree to leave their neighbour in peace on
  the question of religious belief; and the extraordinary bitterness of the
  feeling between the various sects was more and more vexing to Cromwell, who
  had always held tolerance as a matter of principle, and now, as he advanced
  more and more in greatness and power, recognized it as being a necessary
  element of wise government at home and useful alliances abroad.</p>

  <p>'God,' he continued, driving home his point with a certain labour, as if
  he struggled to put into words what no words would convey, 'hath elected
  England&mdash;He hath made us the instruments of some work of His. He wishes
  us to go forward&mdash;to fight heresies and Antichrist&mdash;but also He
  wisheth us to remain united in brotherly love, not to be too nice and strict
  about the religion of the man next us, so long as he be working clearly in
  due fear of Him&mdash;were we not all kinds in the army? Did any fight the
  worse for being an Anabaptist? Nay, I do not think so. God hath need of all
  of us who love Him.'</p>

  <p>General Lambert answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>'This is very well here, among sober men, but how shall Your Highness get
  such a doctrine accepted among the general?'</p>

  <p>'Yea,' said the Lord-Protector gloomily. 'Truly the fools trouble me more
  than the knaves&mdash;most of all do the lukewarm vex me, for nought will
  bring them to any reason&mdash;give me a Saul sooner than a Gallio!'</p>

  <p>'Sir,' replied one of the officers, there are Sauls, and plenty too, and
  maybe the Lord calleth us to combat these sooner than to smooth over heresies
  and live peaceably with those who are little better than the heathen and the
  infidel.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell groaned.</p>

  <p>'There is much to do,' he answered, 'I say there is much to do&mdash;yea,
  serious and mighty things; and shall we stop on the way to argue upon trivial
  matters?'</p>

  <p>'Trivial matters!' echoed several voices at once.</p>

  <p>The Lord-Protector flashed upon them&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Yea, so I say! Study how a man may serve the State, not how he may be
  persuaded from his proper beliefs&mdash;this is enough for any man. "With my
  whole heart have I sought Thee-O let me not go wrong out of Thy
  commandments!"&mdash;he who can say that from his heart, leave him in peace.
  Even these poor people the Quakers&mdash;what harm is there in them that they
  should be so roughly used? What hath God said?&mdash;"I have loved thee with
  an everlasting love&mdash;with loving kindness have I drawn thee!" Shall we,
  too, not strive for a little of this kindness? What have we not had to
  contend with of late? A Parliament that was but a clog and a hindrance,
  rebellions such as that at Salisbury, godly men such as Major-General
  Harrison led astray, rising of Anabaptists&mdash;all manner of trouble and
  confusion&mdash;and shall we add to it by persecuting those who differ from
  us in small matters of doctrine?'</p>

  <p>The Council remained silent; the Keepers of the Great Seal glanced at one
  another. These men were not in dread of His Highness as his Parliament had
  been; they were not his creation to be scattered at his will&mdash;nay, he
  was rather their creation&mdash;yet they knew that when it came to a struggle
  he always prevailed, gently or roughly, directly or indirectly, and they were
  aware of his whirlwind resolutions and believed that if occasion arose they,
  too, might be smitten and cast aside, even though they were the very
  foundations on which his power stood.</p>

  <p>The Protector, eyeing them keenly, was silent too.</p>

  <p>The Master of the Rolls, Lenthall (the Speaker whom Harrison had helped
  from the chair when Cromwell had dismissed the remnant of Charles' last
  Parliament), propping his grim face on his thin hand, asked His Highness what
  he was discontented with.</p>

  <p>'Surely,' he said, with some austerity, 'the work of Christ is being
  accomplished in England? Abroad we have good respect&mdash;I think General
  Blake hath made the name of English respected on the seas&mdash;all Europe
  hath recognized this Commonwealth. Why is Your Highness so vexed and
  troubled?'</p>

  <p>He spoke with some sternness, for he believed, in common with many of his
  colleagues, that the Protector aimed at an even greater personal power, and
  to make himself king in name as he was in fact&mdash;an ambition which was
  intensely displeasing to the army and to their leaders, nearly all of whom
  were staunch Republicans.</p>

  <p>I am vexed and troubled because there is so much confusion and littleness
  at home,' replied Cromwell. 'There is more lamenting over the putting down of
  cock-fighting, play-acting, and horse-racing, gambling, and such lewd sports
  than ever I heard over the loss of any good thing. There are plots and
  confusions manifold, and the Lord hath veiled the future from me, therefore I
  am vexed and troubled. Yet,' he added, with a change of voice and a bright
  flash in his eyes, 'I am not discouraged nor disheartened&mdash;ye must not
  so misread me&mdash;"in the daytime also He led them with a cloud, and in the
  night with a pillar of fire"&mdash;so it hath always been with me&mdash;do
  not think that that hath ever failed me.'</p>

  <p>No man had any speech with which to answer him, and the little assembly
  broke up with the usual courtesies. Only Lambert said as he was leaving; '"He
  shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways."'</p>

  <p>When they had all gone His Highness went to the table where they had been
  sitting, and sat down in his great chair of honour and dropped his head on
  his breast.</p>

  <p>For some while he sat so, his head sinking lower, his hands clasped on his
  knees; then he was aroused by the gentle opening of the door, and Elisabeth
  Claypole came softly into the Council Chamber.</p>

  <p>'Forgive me,' she said. 'I did see that the others had gone, and, knowing
  that you must be alone, I feared you had fallen into sad thoughts.' She
  approached him. 'It is not well, my father&mdash;nay, it is not
  well&mdash;that you should sit alone with melancholy thoughts.'</p>

  <p>She sank into the chair that the stern Lambert had just left; the dark
  wood and leather now framed a very different picture from that the austere
  soldier had made.</p>

  <p>Long ill-health, which physicians could not cure, and intervals of
  lingering illness, which physicians could not ease, had robbed Elisabeth
  Claypole of much of her vivacity and much of her fresh comeliness, but she
  still remained, despite her languor, her paleness, a certain sadness caused
  by constant pain, a creature choice and rare, and, despite all, cheerful and
  courageous. As the Lord-Protector lifted his tired eyes to gaze at her dear
  face he saw in her youthful features a sudden startling likeness to his
  mother, who had died, still valiant and serene, a few months after she had
  moved into the King's palace.</p>

  <p>This curious resemblance between one dead, so full of years, and one young
  and living gave him a feeling of horrid presage; he rose abruptly.</p>

  <p>'Betty, I wish you would get well,' he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>'That is what Bridget says,' she answered (Bridget Seton was Bridget
  Fleetwood now, the wife of one of her father's most honoured generals. Mary
  and Frances were still to wed, and great matches were foretold for them);
  'but you must not think so much of me&mdash;I shall soon be well enough.'</p>

  <p>Her father gazed at her, yearning over that lost brightness which he had
  condemned once as evidence of a carnal mind; her grey gown, her modest laces,
  her smooth ringlets&mdash;all were plain enough now; though her father had
  put on great state and lived almost with the ceremonial of a king, the Lady
  Elisabeth had no longer any heart for pretty vanities.</p>

  <p>'Methinks,' said Cromwell bluntly, 'thou art not happy when thou art at
  Whitehall.'</p>

  <p>'I love Hampton better,' she replied evasively.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for him to divine what her thoughts were&mdash;what
  they always had been.</p>

  <p>'Thou dost think thy father liveth in another man's house by living in the
  King's palace,' he said, with whimsical tenderness.</p>

  <p>'No, no,' she answered, with an effort; 'but it remindeth me of old,
  unhappy times&mdash;of all the blood that was shed&mdash;of the King himself
  (poor, wretched King)&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Cromwell interrupted vehemently.</p>

  <p>'He did not die for nothing, neither he nor the others&mdash;that judgment
  on the tyrant was the fruit and crown of all our efforts and prepared the way
  for such of Christ's work as we have been able to do since.
  Betty&mdash;'&mdash;he turned to his daughter with the same half-anxious,
  half-proud air of defence with which he had turned to his council a little
  before&mdash;'is not this country better at home and abroad than it was under
  the late King?'</p>

  <p>'All bear witness to that,' she replied quickly; 'and that is the reason
  why you should be more uprised in spirits, sir.'</p>

  <p>'I have much to overcome,' he answered.</p>

  <p>'What hath the Lord said?' rejoined the Lady Elisabeth-'"With him that
  overcometh will I share My throne."'</p>

  <p>'Dear one, thy rebuke is well,' answered His Highness gently, 'and do not
  doubt that I shall go forward to the end. But at present there are some
  things hard to bear&mdash;mostly the estrangement from some Christians of my
  acquaintance. I did never think to be parted from Major-General Harrison and
  John Bradshaw, those godly men. Albeit I have tried my best to remain with
  them, and I hope yet to win Major-General Harrison.'</p>

  <p>'He is hard, father&mdash;he is hard and fierce,' replied Elisabeth
  Claypole. 'He was cruel to many poor men&mdash;I have heard notable talk of
  it&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Thou art too pitiful,' said Cromwell, 'and judge as a woman. There is no
  man among us&mdash;not thy brother Henry, not Lambert, nor Dishowe, nor my
  son Fleetwood, a finer soldier or a truer Christian than Thomas
  Harrison.'</p>

  <p>'I do not like him,' insisted the Lady Elisabeth, with a sparkle of her
  former spirit. 'Methinks he smells of his father's trade, and it is credibly
  believed that he hath plotted against you with the Anabaptists&mdash;Richard
  told me as much.'</p>

  <p>'As to that I will demand an answer of these charges from him,' returned
  Cromwell gloomily. 'Believe me that I love him.'</p>

  <p>For answer and comfort she rose and went up to him; as she took him
  lovingly by the upper arm she started. She felt something hard beneath the
  rich black velvet which he wore.</p>

  <p>'You have armour on!' she murmured.</p>

  <p>'Since young Major Gerrard set the precedent there have been many ready to
  follow his example,' replied His Highness. 'And in this way I would not
  die&mdash;nay, I would not die shot like a beast.'</p>

  <p>'O Christ, preserve us all!' cried Lady Elisabeth, and fell weeping over
  the heart that her father had to guard with a steel corselet from the
  assassin's bullet or knife.</p>

  <p>He put his arm round her as if she had been a child (so, indeed, she still
  seemed to him); and the thoughts of both went back to the happy home in St.
  Ives, before they had known sickness or death among them, when she had not
  gone in silk nor he in secret armour, when they had not known the perils of
  great positions nor the magnificence of king's palaces.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-06"
     id="ch4-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. MAJOR-GENERAL HARRISON</h2>

  <p class="first">Major-General Harrison, in grim retirement, sternly rejected
  the Lord-Protector's half-wistful attempts to win him, and even refused to
  come to Whitehall as a friend and dine or sup with the Cromwell family.</p>

  <p>His Highness, however piqued or hurt he might be in secret, refused to
  allow any persecution of his old comrade-in-arms, though Harrison was
  becoming daily more involved with the Anabaptists and that peculiar section
  of enthusiasts who were styled Fifth Monarchy Men, because they believed that
  the four kingdoms foretold by St. John had come to pass, and that the kingdom
  now approaching was the fifth, that of Christ.</p>

  <p>His Highness was lenient with them as with other fanatics; it was in his
  nature to be tolerant and to prefer any form of enthusiasm to lukewarmness.
  He was gentle with the Quakers, and listened patiently to George Fox's mystic
  denunciations of him. 'I am sure that thou and I should be good friends did
  we but know each other,' had been his parting words. He interceded, though
  vainly, for the poor, half-crazed Naylor, who had allowed his followers to
  salute him as the Messiah and had been sentenced by Parliament to brandings,
  whippings, and pillories that meant a hideous death.</p>

  <p>But though the Lord-Protector was merciful he was also strong, as had been
  abundantly proved.</p>

  <p>When fanaticism became insubordination and the cause of religious liberty
  cloaked mutiny and revolt, when, in brief, things mystic and intangible
  interfered with things very practical and tangible, His Highness struck once
  and for ever.</p>

  <p>He raised no objection to men finding in the pages of the Revelations a
  doctrine comfortable to themselves but if they used such doctrines as a
  pretext for rebellion, he knew how to hold them down with a firm hand.</p>

  <p>Therefore, though he argued sweetly and meekly with Thomas Harrison, he
  had that redoubtable saint closely under his observation, as he also watched
  Harry Vane and Bradshaw and Haselrig and other of his one-time friends.</p>

  <p>His Highness was busy in these days, full of high business with France and
  Spain and the Netherlands as well as with this business of keeping order at
  home; for Oliver Cromwell, who had always been a great man, was now a great
  Prince, and England had become of more importance in Europe than she had been
  since the royal Elisabeth or the royal Harry V.</p>

  <p>It was the Lord's doing, said His Highness, the Lord who had elected the
  English as His chosen people. A league of the Protestant nations in one
  alliance was foremost of the Lord-Protector's deeply cherished schemes; at
  present it seemed far from consummation; more practical matters occupied His
  Highness. With Blake on the seas and himself at home, England was powerful
  and vigorous; outwardly she was serene as she was glorious, but none knew
  better than Cromwell himself how beneath this serenity raged faction,
  discontent, and confusion, and how uncertain the tenure of this glory
  was&mdash;merely the tenure of his own life.</p>

  <p>Soon after a certain complicated and perilous plot against that life had
  been discovered and crushed, Cromwell received, among other news equally
  disturbing (for troubles did not lack in England this turbulent spring), an
  account, well attested, of Major-General Harrison's treasonous dealings with
  the Fifth Monarchy Men and of a widespread plot to seduce the army from its
  allegiance.</p>

  <p>An Anabaptist preacher had held forth boldly. 'Wilt thou have Christ or
  Cromwell?' he had asked. In daring and in defiance these enthusiasts were
  getting beyond all common prudence.</p>

  <p>His Highness sent for Major-General Harrison, not in the terms of
  friendship now, but as a Prince summoning a subject.</p>

  <p>Major-General Harrison came, grimly but serenely, and was ushered through
  all the state the Protector kept, for, though simple with his family and
  friends, to the outer world he held as much show as any monarch, into the
  presence of His Highness, who waited him in a very rich chamber that still
  contained some of the late King's pictures and hangings and carpets.</p>

  <p>The Lord-Protector was standing facing the door. He looked less than his
  years, and his expression and pose were both of extraordinary vigour; he wore
  brown velvet galloned with gold and a great falling collar of lace; his hair
  was now as grey as Charles' when he was brought prisoner to Hampton Court;
  but his mournful, resolute face showed no sign of age or feebleness.</p>

  <p>Thomas Harrison was unbooted, for he had come by water; his attire was the
  very extreme of severe simplicity, and his dark countenance was pale and
  stern.</p>

  <p>He took off his high-crowned hat as he came into the Protector's presence
  and flung it, with his cloak, across a chair; he made no reverence and eyed
  His Highness with calm hostility.</p>

  <p>This cold look from one who had been his ancient friend, who had shared
  with him so many hopes, enthusiasms, toils, and victories, smote the
  Protector to the heart. He had been prepared for this enmity; but now that he
  was actually in the presence of his former companion-at-arms, the sight of
  the figure he had so often seen foremost in the field of battle, fighting for
  the Lord, and the face which he had seen so often fired by an exaltation
  kindred to his own, overwhelmed him with a tender sadness and the tears
  sprang into his eyes.</p>

  <p>'Thomas Harrison,' he cried, 'I did not think that we should meet
  thus!'</p>

  <p>'Nor I,' replied the other sombrely. Sir, have your say with me and let me
  go&mdash;for I have nobler work to do than a vain waiting on men in
  palaces.'</p>

  <p>His Highness slightly flushed.</p>

  <p>'I see what rankles in thy mind,' he replied. 'Yet I did think that,
  whatever the general might say, a man such as thou wouldst have believed the
  best, not the worst. Nay,' he added more warmly, 'why shouldst thou think so
  meanly of me? Looking into thy own heart, thou knowest thy motives and
  principles pure&mdash;hast thou not the generosity to credit that I might
  look into my heart and say the same?'</p>

  <p>Major-General Harrison gazed at him unmoved.</p>

  <p>'Wherefore this defence?' he asked. 'I have accused you of nothing,'</p>

  <p>'Not in words,' replied the Lord-Protector, but by thy whole conduct and
  manner.'</p>

  <p>'Neither need trouble thee,' said the soldier calmly, speaking with more
  mildness and adopting the form of speech both more respectful and more
  affectionate, 'since thou needst not see me save by thy own wish.'</p>

  <p>'It was needful that I should see thee,' returned His Highness, 'it was
  very needful. Hard things are said of thee&mdash;yea, difficult and curious
  things.'</p>

  <p>He walked about the room, looking at the floor, his arms folded behind
  him, then stopped before Harrison, who remained a few paces from the door
  standing by the chair on which were his hat and cloak.</p>

  <p>'Thou hast meddled with Anabaptists and these mistaken people called Fifth
  Monarchy Men,' he said abruptly. A grim smile flashed over Harrison's
  face.</p>

  <p>'Art thou become a persecutor and a watcher over men's consciences and a
  spy on their actions?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Nay,' replied His Highness, grimly too, 'thou knowest well enough if I am
  tolerant or no, Thomas Harrison; thou knowest me very well, even to the roots
  of my heart. But now I am Governor of England, and over England I shall
  watch.'</p>

  <p>'Thou art,' said the undaunted Republican, 'a tyrant.'</p>

  <p>'I am a ruler by charter of God and the People,' said Cromwell. 'It is
  well known in this nation and in all the world'&mdash;he lifted his head with
  great dignity&mdash;'whether I am a tyrant or no. But I will admit this much,
  I have as much power and authority as many a bad king. Take that along with
  thee.'</p>

  <p>'I take along with me,' returned Harrison, that thou art a tyrant; and
  though it hath pleased God, in His mysterious decrees, to place thee where
  thou art, I know that He hath done it to bring a further rebuke and
  chastening upon us before the coming of His kingdom and for thy destruction.
  There is a wind abroad over the land, but one which neither purifies nor
  cools&mdash;the presence of God is not with thee nor with those under
  thee.'</p>

  <p>'This is hardly said,' answered the Lord-Protector sadly. 'Ah, thou hast
  gone so far with me&mdash;canst thou not go a little further? Together we
  fought, together we judged that wicked man, Charles Stewart&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Harrison interrupted.</p>

  <p>'Then thou wast acting as God directed&mdash;but lately thou hast acted as
  if a bad angel possessed thee. The true saints who fought with thee then
  could not fight with thee now, Lord Cromwell. A poor few we are&mdash;nay, a
  pitiful remnant, but we believe that before long it will be made known from
  Heaven that we are right, although it hath seemed good to Him to suffer this
  turn to come upon us&mdash;so that we are a forsaken few.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, not forsaken!' cried His Highness, much agitated. 'Is it not for
  thee, and such as thee, that this Government exists?'</p>

  <p>'I know not,' replied Harrison coldly. Methought that it existed for
  itself, as all governments do.'</p>

  <p>'Truly,' cried the Lord-Protector, with rising anger, 'they who call thee
  hard have reason&mdash;nay, thou art more, thou art unjust.'</p>

  <p>'Unjust!' repeated Harrison, with more emotion than he had so far shown.
  'Is thy memory so feeble or thy heart so false as not to recall the old days,
  the bright morning of our hopes and triumphs?'</p>

  <p>He came a step nearer, holding out his hands and speaking vehemently.</p>

  <p>'We rejoiced in slaying the enemies of the Lord; with many tears and
  prayers and strivings we sought assurance of the Lord's will and brought the
  tyrant to judgment. Thou and I put our names to his death-warrant; thou and I
  will answer together for that deed before the Heavenly Throne, and I can say
  before Him who searcheth all hearts, I did this thing thinking His hand was
  in it, and that the land could only be cleansed from blood by the blood of
  him who first shed blood. But thou, what canst thou say?&mdash;I slew this
  man that I might climb into his place, succeed to his power, sleep in his
  rich bed, have carnal honours for my children, and a high name for myself!
  Oh, Oliver, thou canst say nothing else!'</p>

  <p>'Before Him who made me a Joshua over this Israel I need no defence,'
  answered His Highness simply. 'He knoweth my poor heart and what He put
  therein&mdash;and how this miserable flesh, with many stumbles, tried to do
  His will. I am not afraid of my God. Leave Him to judge me and return to thy
  ancient faithfulness to me.'</p>

  <p>'Thou wert,' said Harrison, 'as the apple of mine eye, but now I loathe
  thee. Thou hast turned aside, and thou shalt not tempt me to follow thee,
  even if thou flatterest me, saying, "Come and sit on my right hand and share
  my power."'</p>

  <p>The Lord-Protector took a sharp turn about the room.</p>

  <p>'Thou art deluded, I plainly see,' he said; 'but it cannot be allowed that
  thou shouldst run into these excursions, though I have given thee a great
  latitude&mdash;I say that it cannot be allowed. I have with a great deal of
  patience suffered thee to sally out, but I perceive thou art misled, yea, and
  rebellious&mdash;surely we will have no rebellion.'</p>

  <p>'Do what you will with me,' said Harrison calmly. 'I will give my little
  poor testimony to the truth as I know it. Maybe I am a little mistaken, but I
  act according to my understanding, desiring to make the revealed Word of God
  in His Holy Scriptures my guide.'</p>

  <p>'Thou art mistaken,' replied Cromwell gloomily. 'Beware of a hard heart
  and an obdurate spirit. And beware of these Fifth Monarchy Men. They plot
  against the Commonwealth&mdash;they plot against my life.'</p>

  <p>'You believe that of me?' asked Harrison sharply.</p>

  <p>'Why not?' returned His Highness scornfully. 'Thou hast put thy hand to
  the removal of one tyrant and may willingly desire to remove another.'</p>

  <p>'What I did against Charles Stewart was not done in a corner,' said the
  Republican calmly, 'nor should I act in a hidden way against you or against
  any one.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' said Cromwell impulsively, 'I believe it. Forgive me. But thou art
  in these Fifth Monarchy plots.'</p>

  <p>'We do not plot,' returned Harrison, 'nor intrigue, whatever may be noised
  of us.'</p>

  <p>'Thou mayst put what name thou wilt to it, Major-General Harrison,' said
  His Highness; 'but it is a known fact that thou seekest to disturb the
  Government and seduce the army.'</p>

  <p>'I neither own the Government nor molest it. But wherefore these words? I
  do not seek to fly or in any way to save myself. Sir, I am in your power,
  both I and those poor hearts, those few redcoats who still hold the pure
  doctrine.'</p>

  <p>'Thou knowest,' replied the Lord-Protector hastily, and with evident
  emotion, 'that I wish to be at peace with all men&mdash;even with the
  malignants.'</p>

  <p>'Yea!' cried Thomas Harrison, with a flame of anger in his dark eyes, 'you
  have been very ready to make peace with Bael&mdash;to this has your tolerance
  led you!'</p>

  <p>'I would that thou hadst a little more tolerance,' was the mild reply.</p>

  <p>'These are vain words,' said the soldier impatiently. 'You and I have
  parted company long since. Our ways lie differently now. Tell me what you
  will of me and let this end.'</p>

  <p>Oliver Cromwell looked at him fully and mournfully, then sighed.</p>

  <p>'If thou wilt recognize the Government thou mayst live in peace for
  me.'</p>

  <p>Thomas Harrison replied in a tone serene and unmoved&mdash;'I will not;
  come what may, I will not.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-Protector straightened his figure (which drooped a little in the
  shoulders of late), and then the blood slowly overspread his face.</p>

  <p>'I shall not take this lightly,' he said; 'for my own dignity I may not
  take it lightly&mdash;I am the Governor of England. I have some
  authority.'</p>

  <p>The brief carnal power of a thing of clay,' replied Harrison with an
  exalted smile. 'Wherefore should I seek to please thee, who in a few years
  will be gone from this scene, leaving behind thy power and thy splendour? I
  listen to the voice of Him before whom thou and all the nations of the earth
  are less than a drop of water in the bucket; my thoughts are fixed, not on
  this dusty sojourn here, but on those azure eternities which God giveth to
  His servants. Therefore I will not obey thee in this matter, for my
  conscience is against it.'</p>

  <p>The Lord-Protector was silent a moment, then he spoke in a tone from which
  all friendliness and pleading had gone.</p>

  <p>'Then if you will not recognize the Government, you must cease to serve
  it. I shall ask for your commission.'</p>

  <p>Major-General Harrison gently unfastened his sword thread and laid the
  plain weapon and the plain belt on a little table which stood near the
  Protector.</p>

  <p>'There is my sword,' he said, 'which hath done some poor little service.
  Take it and let it rust.'</p>

  <p>Cromwell remembered Marston Moor, Naseby, Basing, Oxford, many warm acts
  of friendship, many mutual prayers&mdash;all the old laborious, hopeful,
  triumphant days which they had shared.</p>

  <p>He said nothing; his hand went out as if yearningly and lovingly towards
  the weapon which he had so often seen red with the newly smitten blood of
  God's enemies.</p>

  <p>He still did not speak, and his silence was stern.</p>

  <p>Thomas Harrison took up his hat and cloak, and with a courteous but cold
  salute turned to take his leave.</p>

  <p>His Highness turned to watch him and suddenly spoke, even as the other had
  his hand on the door.</p>

  <p>'Thomas Harrison, it is very fitting that I make some defence to you. You
  have known me very well, and you believe hard, diabolic things of me. I would
  make some answer to this. I may bear the unkind thoughts of mine enemies, but
  I would be relieved of the ill-opinion of those who were once my
  friends.'</p>

  <p>Harrison paused, and then turned with his back to the door, still unmoved
  and hostile, but attentive, as if compelled to that amount of respect by the
  rough, impassioned voice and fervent tones of the man for whom he would have
  given his life a few years ago. As he listened to his one-time beloved
  General, something of the old affection touched him, though faintly; he
  waited.</p>

  <p>'You accuse me of base ambition,' said His Highness, lifting his
  head&mdash;his face had a look of a lion, mournful and infinitely
  strong&mdash;'but that failing I never had. You accuse me of grasping at the
  King's power, but that I never wanted. A man was needed&mdash;England, I say,
  had need of a man&mdash;but none came. Any of you could have come forward to
  take this place I hold&mdash;this place of no peace, little sleep, and
  endless labour&mdash;any of you! But you were not called, or you did not heed
  the call, you stepped aside&mdash;and England waited. I know not if you
  lacked courage, or if your conscience called you different ways&mdash;but
  none offered. And I, on in years and something broken by the wars, besought
  the Lord not to put this upon me&mdash;yet He did. And I did not shirk it. I
  obeyed Him as I did when I left London to form a troop in Cambridge that time
  the King did raise his standard against the people. Each time the Lord's
  breath was through me, as wind is through a hollow reed, and by Him I could
  do a little. That is my only merit. And England is something now&mdash;the
  home of His chosen. You were nice, you hesitated, you made
  punctilios&mdash;but I heard the call and saw the light, as oft in the
  battalion, and I obeyed. I have tried many ways of government, each as it
  comes to my hand. What my position truly is I know not&mdash;I am a parish
  constable set to keep the peace. Yet here I be, by God's will, and here I do
  my work. You may judge me with charity, Thomas Harrison, as one upon whom a
  very heavy burden hath been laid.'</p>

  <p>He paused, and his head drooped.</p>

  <p>'There is no more to say,' he added, and his rough voice had fallen lower.
  'Farewell&mdash;"God watch between me and thee when we are absent from one
  and another."'</p>

  <p>'Amen,' said Thomas Harrison.</p>

  <p>And so they parted.</p>

  <p>The Lord-Protector stood lonely in the rich chamber, which had been
  furnished by the dead King and the banished Queen.</p>

  <p>He went to the window and looked on the spring fairness of the garden, on
  the warm glitter of the river and the sails going down to the sea.</p>

  <p>His greatness oppressed him in that moment, and he was homesick for the
  past and the uneventful days of his youth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-07"
     id="ch4-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. LADY NEWCASTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">Through the mingled splendour and distress, brightness and
  confusion of these years of the Lord-Protector's ruling in England, while the
  glory of England rose to a perilous height (her renown glittered as the foam
  on a wave cast for a moment into the sun&mdash;soon to fall into the darkness
  of the waters again and to be lost), while Oliver Cromwell shone refulgent in
  all men's eyes, the Lady Elisabeth Claypole, moving from her husband's house
  to her father's palaces, and in all places greatly loved, faded visibly and
  pitifully.</p>

  <p>She had always been an advocate of mercy, and many a Cavalier owed his
  life or his estate to her pleadings, and there was no one, however he might
  hate Cromwell, who had not a gentle thought for this daughter of his. Among
  her keen, delicate sisters she showed yet more keen and delicate, and though
  she had now lost the fresh English fairness which bloomed in the Lady Mary
  and the Lady Frances, and which had become womanly grace in Bridget
  Fleetwood, yet of all of them she was the most lovable. If any wished a
  favour from the Lord-Protector it was to her they went to ask her
  intercession, for as her illness and her weakness grew and her end came
  nearer, nearer with every painful breath she drew, His Highness' tender love
  increased into an agony of yearning, until it seemed as if he could refuse
  her nothing.</p>

  <p>One April, when His Highness was deep in great affairs&mdash;letters to
  Cardinal Mazarin, letters to General Blake now sailing victorious in foreign
  waters, questions of his taking the title of King, questions of the Fifth
  Monarchy Men having broken out rebelliously at last, and Thomas Harrison
  being in the Tower for abetting them&mdash;a supplicant came to Hampton with
  a very earnest entreaty to be allowed to see the Lord-Protector. Whereat John
  Thurloe, His Highness' faithful secretary, was indignant almost beyond the
  bounds of courtesy, and mighty angry with the servants who had let the lady
  get as far as the ante-chamber.</p>

  <p>'Lackeys,' said she, on hearing his complaint, 'are still used to pay
  respect to princesses.'</p>

  <p>But he told her she could by no means see His Highness, and he spoke so
  firmly that she sadly turned away.</p>

  <p>'Alas!' she murmured, 'that I should be sent like a beggar from the door
  of a usurper!'</p>

  <p>John Thurloe regarded her sharply.</p>

  <p>'Had you been a man, madam, you would have had to answer for that
  remark.'</p>

  <p>The lady turned and seemed about to reply, when Elisabeth Claypole chanced
  to pass the open door, and, seeing a stranger there, she entered.</p>

  <p>'Who is this?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'A lady who will not give her name,' said the secretary dryly; 'but no one
  can see His Highness now.'</p>

  <p>'My name,' said the stranger, with that air of fantastic dignity which
  disguised her haggard sadness, 'is something too great to be bandied about
  here&mdash;but give me yours, madam.'</p>

  <p>'I am Elisabeth Claypole, madam,' returned the Protector's daughter
  mildly.</p>

  <p>The lady swept a courtly courtesy.</p>

  <p>'There is no need,' she replied, 'for me to disguise my quality from one
  so generous and good. I am, madam, the wife of the unfortunate Marquess of
  Newcastle.'</p>

  <p>This name, which a few years ago had been one of the greatest in the land,
  and still echoed in the minds of men, had an effect on John Thurloe and even
  on Elisabeth herself. The new order had not endured long enough for people to
  have eradicated the instinct of respect for noble blood and ancient names;
  for a moment the Marchioness in her poor attire, abashed the two commoners,
  so strong still were tradition and the old teaching.</p>

  <p>Then Elisabeth Claypole spoke.</p>

  <p>'Will you come with me, madam, and take a little poor hospitality?'</p>

  <p>Thurloe, glad to be relieved of the responsibility of the distinguished
  petitioner, put in his word.</p>

  <p>'I will give Your Grace's name to His Highness presently, but I do fear it
  is useless.'</p>

  <p>'Come with me, madam,' repeated the Lady Elisabeth, and she gently took
  the Marchioness by the hand and led her to her apartment.</p>

  <p>Lady Newcastle came meekly; for all her air of pride she was downcast and
  bewildered with misfortune.</p>

  <p>The Lady Elisabeth's room looked on the river, now shaded by willow trees
  covered with drooping yellow and red leaves, the banks were grown with tall
  grasses and rushes, and the first pale flowers of spring, beyond the soft
  fields, faded into the soft sky.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole loved to sit day after day at her deep window gazing on
  that scene, watching the river that wandered through such pleasant ways
  through the great city, past the palace, past the Traitor's Gate, out to the
  wonder and turmoil of the open sea.</p>

  <p>She put a chair for the Marchioness and herself sank into the window seat,
  glancing swiftly at her guest. She saw a lady of a medium loveliness, most
  piteously worn and marred by sorrow, and attired in a tasteful if unusual
  style, which gave her the appearance of being richly dressed; but Elisabeth's
  quick eyes saw that the grey silk dress had been turned and scoured, that the
  ruffles of lace had been darned again and again, and that she wore no jewels.
  The Protector's daughter felt ashamed of her own velvet gown and the valuable
  pearls she had in her ears.</p>

  <p>'I wished to see your father, madam,' said Lady Newcastle, in a voice
  where fatigue and humiliation struggled with a natural pride.</p>

  <p>'Alas!' murmured Elisabeth, 'he is so pressed with business&mdash;will you
  tell your errand to me, my Lady Newcastle?'</p>

  <p>'I have come to England in company with my brother-in-law to endeavour to
  obtain some remnant of my husband's estates,' was the answer. 'And we were
  returning in despair, when I, unknown to him, thought to make this personal
  appeal.'</p>

  <p>The Lady Elisabeth knew at once that the unfortunate gentlewoman had made
  an utterly hopeless journey, for she was well aware that one of the late
  King's generals, and a royalist so notable as the Marquess of Newcastle,
  could never obtain grace from the Commonwealth.</p>

  <p>Wishful, as ever, to avoid inflicting pain rudely, she made an evasive
  answer.</p>

  <p>'Will your lord swear fealty to the Government, madam?'</p>

  <p>'Nay&mdash;do you take him for a disloyal wretch?' flashed the
  Duchess.</p>

  <p>'Then,' replied Elisabeth, with something of her pride roused, 'I wonder
  that you should have undertaken the labour of this journey.'</p>

  <p>A pallor overshadowed the royalist lady's features, and she hung her head,
  as if she heard in these words the full extent of her miseries and the depths
  of her humiliations.</p>

  <p>'Could you see how the exiles live in Paris, in Rotterdam&mdash;in
  Antwerp,' she answered&mdash;'all of us&mdash;even the Queen&mdash;you would
  not wonder at my endeavour, however foolish, to obtain some relief.'</p>

  <p>It was the Protector's daughter who paled now; the thought of the English
  exiles wandering miserably through Europe had constantly haunted her.</p>

  <p>'You are then in distress?' she asked, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'In the greatest poverty,' replied Lady Newcastle, her pride melting
  before the touch of tenderness, and the tears suddenly reddening her eyes.
  'The French King makes nothing of us; he is all for an alliance with the
  usur&mdash;with your father. The Princess of Orange can do nothing for us,
  for, since her husband died, the Netherlands have put down her son and
  so&mdash;and so&mdash;' She paused to command herself, then continued; 'Do
  not think I complain for myself. My lord was ruined when I married him in
  Paris. I took him for great and exceeding love, as he did me, seeing I was
  dowerless, and I make it no hardship to share his exiled wanderings with
  him&mdash;but there are so many others even wanting bread&mdash;and Her
  Majesty and the Princess Henrietta are in such distress&mdash;But not to you
  should I speak of these things. I would only explain how it is that I have so
  far lowered my dignity as to come here on this errand.'</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole caught a glimpse of the sufferings, poverties, and
  misery of the exiled English in this speech, given so humbly, so haltingly,
  yet with the accent of a pride unquenched.</p>

  <p>My lady dashed the tears from her eyes with a laced handkerchief.</p>

  <p>'I am Margaret Lucas,' she added, 'and well used to misfortunes. I came to
  England to try what I could do, but I found no friend anywhere, nor any one
  who would bring me before your father. So I came to-day&mdash;wildly and
  foolishly, it might be&mdash;to ask if he would give my lord his rights.'</p>

  <p>'I would not give you false hopes,' replied the Lady Elisabeth. 'My Lord's
  estate is forfeit, and no entreaties of yours or mine could avail to restore
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Entreaties?' cried Lady Newcastle. I fear I could not entreat&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She abruptly checked her sentence, but Elisabeth knew well enough that
  some hard thing against the Protector had been on her tongue.</p>

  <p>'Have patience, my lady, this life is very short and full of sadness. All
  these great affairs and great pains will soon be past, and others will be in
  our places while we shall be at rest&mdash;up there'&mdash;she pointed to the
  sky&mdash;'above it all, God grant!'</p>

  <p>'You speak as if you too were unfortunate!' said the Marchioness
  wonderingly. 'Surely, Mrs. Claypole, you do not need philosophy to sweeten
  your lot.'</p>

  <p>'I am dying,' answered Elisabeth Claypole. 'And I am young and have much
  on this earth that I love, also I suffer very greatly&mdash;so much that I
  wish I could die quicker. Therefore,' she added sweetly, 'you see that I have
  not found the world wholly pleasant, and why I long for these mansions God
  hath prepared for us above.'</p>

  <p>My lady's warm heart was greatly moved by this touching confession.</p>

  <p>'Forgive me, I did not know,' she answered; 'but I dare hope you are
  mistaken&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Those who love me deceive themselves, but I know,' smiled Elisabeth. 'I
  am not afraid to die&mdash;but sometimes, madam, I am a coward before the
  pain, the great pain,'&mdash;then, hastily turning the subject from herself,
  she added,&mdash;'I mix not at all in business, I know my father doeth God's
  work&mdash;yet I am most grieved for you and such as you, for all the blood
  shed, for all the misery. Ah me!&mdash;our day is now, we seem very glorious,
  but what doth it all hang on? My father's life&mdash;no more. And it may be
  that we too shall end and come to nothing and your turn come again. I know
  not. Sometimes life seems very far away from me, as if I surveyed it from a
  distance, and saw it all blurred and vague.'</p>

  <p>'How many sad women I have seen!' exclaimed Margaret. 'The Queen&mdash;you
  would not know her&mdash;an old woman, all burnt away with fiery tears; Lady
  Strafford, all broken and silenced; Lady William Pawlet, who hath crept into
  a convent and is as near a nun as a widow may be&mdash;and myself&mdash;how I
  have wept&mdash;mine eyes are weakened for ever because of tears. It was for
  Charles, my dear, dear brother...you know they shot him, poor gallant
  soldier, outside Colchester...Your father was guiltless of that, or nothing
  had brought me here to-day.'</p>

  <p>Elisabeth did not answer; Cromwell was certainly not responsible for the
  military executions, so harsh and unnecessary, of Lucas and Lisle after the
  siege of Colchester; but it had been the work of Bridget's first husband,
  Henry Ireton (a man whom she had never liked), and so she could not condemn
  the action though her heart cried out against it. The Marchioness rose, and
  the gentle April sunlight flicked the scoured silk, the darned lace, the face
  so peaked and worn for one so young.</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' she said, with quivering lips, 'one goes on living&mdash;but
  the world is never the same after these things have happened. How differently
  I dreamed it would be!'</p>

  <p>'I also,' answered Elisabeth Claypole. 'I never thought of death at all.
  Far, far off I fancied him, and behold, he was knocking at the door. But the
  world does not heed poor silly women, madam; we are but the dust bruised by
  the tramplings of great events; nations march past and leave us weeping. God
  send you a good deliverance from your sorrows. I will do what little I can,
  and ask my father to receive your petition, but well I know it hopeless.'</p>

  <p>'I thank you,' said Margaret; 'from my heart I thank you for your good,
  your generous, graciousness. I cannot think of you as my enemy&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Why should you?' cried Elisabeth. 'We are both English women. I hope the
  day is near when all such shall be united.'</p>

  <p>She rose and unlatched the lattice, and a fresh air blew in from the young
  leaves that quivered on the willows and the young grass that waved in the
  fields.</p>

  <p>'The river!' said Margaret, looking over her shoulder. 'I often dream of
  the river, it seems woven through everything&mdash;twisted in and out of the
  past years and all their story. In Paris, among strangers, I think of the
  river, and grow sad with home-sickness. The river is very dear&mdash;and
  means so much.'</p>

  <p>'I think so too,' said Elisabeth. 'Consider how it will flow on the same,
  hundreds of years hence, when all the present kingdoms of the earth will be
  dust like yester year's roses.'</p>

  <p>'I hope I shall die in England,' said my lady irrelevantly; and now
  farewell,' she added bravely. 'Forgive me my sad coming.'</p>

  <p>'Come again,' interrupted the Lady Elisabeth, taking her hand. 'I may have
  news for you. Where do you lodge?'</p>

  <p>'With Mrs. Brydon, a cousin of my father over against the Exchange. I am
  called Mrs. Lucas there, for any pomp is foolish in such sorry
  circumstances.'</p>

  <p>'Come again in a few weeks&mdash;my father is so occupied with the Spanish
  War&mdash;but I will speak to him of my lord's estates. Yet I can promise
  nothing,' she added reluctantly.</p>

  <p>'Yet I love you dearly for the kindness,' replied Margaret, holding out
  her hands.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth took them in her own frail fingers; these two women were
  strangely drawn to one another.</p>

  <p>'I pray Heaven you will recover,' added the Marchioness. 'I think you will
  recover. Madam, you will live to be very happy.'</p>

  <p>'God may make me happy,' said Elisabeth, 'but not on the earth now.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, you will live to encourage other unfortunates as you have encouraged
  me.'</p>

  <p>Both of them had tears in their eyes; obeying a mutual impulse, they bent
  and kissed each other on the cheek.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth came with Margaret to the outer door of her apartments, and
  there gave her in charge to one of the ushers to be conducted from the palace
  with all courtesy.</p>

  <p>Before she returned to her chamber she asked if His Highness was at
  leisure.</p>

  <p>She was told that he was deeply engaged with his secretary on the
  questions to be put before the Council when he returned to Whitehall
  to-morrow.</p>

  <p>Lady Newcastle returned to an alien London, and sat down in her forlorn
  and ancient splendour to write to her beloved lord in Antwerp, where he
  lodged in the house of the late King's painter, Sir Peter Rubens.</p>

  <p>As the shadows fell over the city, over the fresh countryside, over the
  river, as the night moths came out and the early stocks and pinks in the
  gardens at Hampton Palace filled the air with sweetness, His Highness still
  toiled in his cabinet, and Elisabeth Claypole still sat at the open window of
  her room with folded hands and thoughtful eyes gazing across the
  twilight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-08"
     id="ch4-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE LADY ELISABETH</h2>

  <p class="first">When the Marchioness of Newcastle, after waiting long and
  vainly, returned at length to Hampton Court and asked for the Lady Elisabeth,
  she was told that the Protector's daughter was too ill to see any one.</p>

  <p>After lingering a little, and trying other sources of communication with
  the Court and finding none, she returned sadly with her husband's brother to
  Antwerp to take up again her exiled life.</p>

  <p>All through that summer and autumn Elisabeth Claypole had seemed sinking
  down to death. She knew little of what passed; of how, after long debates,
  His Highness had refused the title of King ('a feather in his cap,' he called
  it; a feather he would fain have had, many said, only the army had willed
  otherwise), but had been installed in purple and ermine as Lord-Protector of
  the new-formed Constitution and presented with Bible and sword; of how
  ambassadors had come and gone in England and the war with Spain proceeded
  brilliantly; how plots were formed and exposed and His Highness went in a
  continual fear of his life that was beginning to undermine his calm nerves
  and resolute courage, and of how he and his generals toiled
  continually&mdash;</p>

  <p>Of all this Elisabeth Claypole knew little; she was scarcely conscious of
  more than the darkened room in which she lay and of the figures of her mother
  and sisters coming and going softly, of her husband grieving by her bed, and
  her father's presence in such moments as he could spare to hold her hand and
  speak comforting words to her tired ears.</p>

  <p>By the spring they thought that they had cured her; but in the summer she
  drooped again, though she went to the marriage of her sister Frances with
  young Mr. Rich, the Earl of Warwick's heir.</p>

  <p>Frances was the last to wed, for Mary was now Lady Fauconberg. Many finer
  matches had been suggested for this youngest of the Protector's daughters;
  some had even tried to bring about a marriage between her and Charles
  Stewart, and the women of His Highness' family had favoured this scheme, but
  Cromwell waved it aside&mdash;'If he could forgive his father's death, I
  could not forgive the loose manner of his life'&mdash;and Frances had wedded,
  after much opposition, Mr. Rich, a delicate youth.</p>

  <p>In the June of this year of 1658 came the great news of the fall of
  Dunkirk, the defeat of the Spanish, and the flattering friendship of the
  French. London glittered with a congratulatory embassy from Paris; in the
  midst of the pageantry, His Highness, who had already interfered once to save
  the poor people of the valleys of Piedmont, was once more extending his
  mighty protection to them, and Mr. Milton, the Latin Secretary to the Council
  of State, was turning His Highness' letters into Latin: Mr. Milton dictated
  his translations now, for he was lately become utterly blind.</p>

  <p>The news of the battle of the Dunes raised England to a yet higher point
  of fame than she had yet reached. France could refuse such an ally nothing,
  and Mazarin interfered to protect the Piedmontese.</p>

  <p>So went affairs abroad and in England well too, save that the finances
  were strained, His Highness having dissolved the Parliament in February,
  preferring, indeed, to govern without one.</p>

  <p>'God be judge between you and me,' were the concluding words of his last
  speech.</p>

  <p>Other sorrows beside the illness of his daughter visited His Highness this
  summer; Mr. Rich died a few months after his marriage, leaving poor Frances a
  widow at seventeen; the old Earl of Warwick died, an ancient friend of the
  Protector; most painful and terrible loss of all, the youngest son of the
  Lady Elisabeth died, and she fell again into illness and was soon at a
  desperate extremity.</p>

  <p>In between his entertainment of the French ambassadors at Whitehall, his
  conferences with his Council, and all the routine of government, His Highness
  would take his coach and drive to Hampton, and sit for a while in his child's
  darkened chamber and pray with tears that her agony might be lessened.</p>

  <p>His own health began to suffer. Those about him noticed that the deep
  gloom which had settled on his spirits was affecting his strength; he still
  looked and seemed in every way younger, much younger than his years; he had a
  great appearance of strength; he gave the impression of being firmly built,
  and set, and able to endure for a great while yet the powerful winds which
  buffeted his high and glorious pinnacle of splendour.</p>

  <p>Yet those most with him, especially Thurloe, his ardent and faithful
  secretary, thought that underneath this calm and strong exterior he was much
  shaken in mind and health. His domestic sorrows were known to affect him
  sorely, his nerves were strained to breaking-point by the constant
  apprehension of assassination, the future was believed to weigh on him, for
  there was no settlement of the country for any period longer than his life,
  and it became daily more apparent how the whole fabric of Puritan government
  depended on that life, on his unique position and influence with the army, on
  the dominating force of his personality, on the glory of his prestige and the
  glamour of his genuis.</p>

  <p>He had always seemed so vigorous, and glowing with the light and the fire
  of an immortal spirit that no one associated him with age or death or thought
  about his successor; but it was possible that to himself, as the atmosphere
  of death chilled his home, might come the reflection that the England of his
  making was as baseless as the Greece of Alexander, and might as easily fall
  to pieces at his death&mdash;only his captains were not the men to divide the
  spoils. What, then, would follow?</p>

  <p>He may well have asked himself that question and pondered over it in these
  dark days.</p>

  <p>The Lord Richard, his eldest surviving son, was a mere country gentleman,
  with neither strength nor talents&mdash;nay, rather of an indolent turn and a
  certain softness; to set him to hold together the various elements which
  controlled the nation would be to invite certain failure.</p>

  <p>The Lord Henry, his second son, was as able a man as any about him and
  already of much distinction in his military and diplomatic career; but he was
  not the man to step into another's place; ambition did not spur his noble
  qualities. Then there were the Lord Fleetwood, his son-in-law, the Lord
  Lambert, Disbrowe, many fine, fearless soldiers, Blake, Monck. But where was
  the man&mdash;the one pre-eminently marked out to continue the work of His
  Highness?</p>

  <p>No one could point to such an one. The Lord-Protector had the right of
  naming his successor, but as yet had not done so; the new-founded
  Constitution (the last attempt to frame a civil government on the foundations
  of arbitrary military power) was scarcely complete, and after these last
  glorious successes in the Spanish War there was further persistent talk of a
  kingship for the Protector. Many said this title was a certain thing; but it
  was a thing yet pending, and with it the question of the succession.</p>

  <p>There were many jars and confusions, too, in the inner state of England
  that might well weigh on the spirit of the Protector. His body was worn with
  gout and a slight but lingering aguish fever. He might neglect none of his
  business, and maintain the appearance of mental and physical strength, but
  John Thurloe, his constant companion, was not deceived.</p>

  <p>'His Highness,' he said to Whitelocke, 'is a sick man, and these vigils by
  the Lady Elisabeth will wear him to a great disease.'</p>

  <p>That summer was notable for the fierceness of the heat day by day the sun
  beat down without either rain or cloud, night after night the stars shone
  with unveiled brilliance; then towards the beginning of August a light wind
  blew for several days and cooled the air. Elisabeth Claypole seemed to rally
  a little as the great heat was relieved, and His Highness, who had left
  business for several days lately to watch by her, thought it safe to return
  to London, where the French notables were still being entertained.</p>

  <p>On Friday the 6th of August he came back to Hampton Court; he came in a
  coach, for, having lately been flung from his carriage, he was too shaken to
  ride on horseback. That day he had been more than usually cheerful; he had
  even smiled at the reports from France; tales of how his Ironsides (oh,
  irony!), now fighting there side by side with the followers of the Scarlet
  Lady, had given their General trouble by their behaviour in the churches of
  the idolaters, one lighting his pipe from the candle on the high altar. Then
  he heard how Mr. Hugh Peters had endeavoured to make long sermons before the
  magnificent Cardinal, hoping to convert him from his deep errors.</p>

  <p>At the name of Mr. Hugh Peters His Highness smiled no more; it recalled to
  him strangely that winter morning in Whitehall when he had paced the boarded
  gallery in sick agitation, and Hugh Peters, in his black clothes, had gone
  out to the scaffold and helped knock a staple in and hurried to and fro in
  enthusiastic excitement...It seemed so long ago...and now this same Hugh
  Peters was arguing with Cardinal Mazarin, and the young King of France was
  sending him a rich sword with a jewelled hilt...a King who was the nephew of
  that other King who had knelt down at the block that January morning.</p>

  <p>His Highness did not set much store by this costly sword; his victories
  had been won with plainer weapons.</p>

  <p>While he was in his coach, hastening towards Hampton, he took from his
  pocket a pamphlet which was then making much stir in England. The title was
  <i>Killing no Murder</i>, and it set forth with much eloquence that any
  murderer of Oliver Cromwell would be justified by God and man.</p>

  <p>His Highness read the paper from beginning to end, then put it back in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>'There is no notice to be taken of such things,' said John Thurloe, who
  sat opposite him.</p>

  <p>'It is no matter one way or another,' answered His Highness; and he took
  from his bosom a small Bible and gave it to Thurloe and asked him to read
  from it aloud, For,' he said, 'I feel my eyes tired.'</p>

  <p>'What shall I read?' asked the secretary, leaning towards the light of the
  window and unclasping the Book; the coach had just turned by Turnham Green
  and the road was smooth.</p>

  <p>'Read,' said the Lord-Protector, the fourth of St. Paul to the
  Philippians, the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth verses&mdash;read aloud in
  a strong voice.'</p>

  <p>Which John Thurloe did.</p>

  <p>"Not that I speak in respect of want; but I have learned, in whatsoever
  state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know
  how to abound. Everywhere, and by all things, I am instructed both to be full
  and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things
  through Christ which strengtheneth me."</p>

  <p>His Highness repeated the last sentence.</p>

  <p>'"<i>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me</i>." This
  Scripture did once save my life,' he added, 'when my eldest son, poor Robert,
  died, which went as a dagger to my heart&mdash;indeed, it did.'</p>

  <p>He paused and John Thurloe looked up, startled to hear him refer to a
  sorrow so ancient. But Cromwell's thoughts seemed to be in the past.</p>

  <p>'In my great extremity,' he continued, 'I did read these passages of
  Paul's contention&mdash;of the submission to the will of God in all
  conditions; and it was hard&mdash;indeed, it was hard. In my weakness I said,
  "It is true, Paul, <i>you</i> have learned this, and attained to this measure
  of grace; but what shall <i>I</i> do? Ah, poor creature, it is a hard lesson
  for me to take out. I find it so!" But reading on to the thirteenth verse,
  where Paul saith, "<i>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
  me</i>," then faith began to work and my heart to find support, saying to
  myself, "He that was Paul's Christ is my Christ too"&mdash;and so I drew
  waters out of the well of salvation.'</p>

  <p>'Why should Your Highness remind yourself of this?' asked Thurloe
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Thurloe!' cried the Lord-Protector, with a great sigh, 'it is to
  nerve myself in case another of my children should be taken from me. If she
  should die&mdash;it would be almost more than I could bear. Yet God might
  take her, though I have wrestled with Him for her life, even as David
  wrestled for the life of his son. My brave, sweet one She was always good and
  loving, was she not, Thurloe? Wonderful and inscrutable are His ways that He
  should lay such suffering and agonies on one so delicate and valiant!'</p>

  <p>The secretary had no more to say; neither did His Highness speak again,
  but gazed out of the window at the sun-dried countryside, at the orchards
  where the dry wind blew the shrivelled leaves of red and gold from the fruit
  too early ripe, at the great elms and oaks rustling the foliage to the
  ground, at the thatched and gabled cottages where the children ran to the
  doors to watch the coach with the four horses and outriders and the troop of
  Life Guards go by.</p>

  <p>Soon they came in sight of the river, with islands and barges and reaches,
  where the boats were drawn above the tide, and a few boys fished, knee-deep
  in mud.</p>

  <p>Then they lost the river and passed between private mansions standing
  among trees, and so to the village of Hampton as the sun was sinking in a
  glow of unstained fire.</p>

  <p>As they neared the Palace His Highness became very pale, and he looked
  once or twice with an air of dread from the window, as if he expected to see
  some awful change over the place.</p>

  <p>But no scene could have been more peaceful; the river flowed softly
  between the fading willows and the banks where the tall grasses, white whorls
  of hemlock, and clusters of parsley flowers grew; the last light of the sun
  glowed on the red bricks of the Palace and cast long shadows from the summer
  flowers in the garden; up among the high chimney-stacks white pigeons
  fluttered home with light upon their wings.</p>

  <p>Cromwell entered the Palace. The first to meet him was one of the grooms
  of his chamber; the man gave him a frightened look and moved away without
  speaking.</p>

  <p>He went towards his daughter's apartments, and in the corridor Frances
  Rich, a child in widow's mourning, came towards him with staggering
  steps.</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my father!' she said, and lifted a face swollen with weeping.</p>

  <p>'What is it, my dear?' he asked, in a still voice. 'Be calm, my child, my
  dear.'</p>

  <p>He took her trembling little figure by the shoulder and smoothed back the
  damp hair from her forehead.</p>

  <p>'Is she dead?' he asked. 'Is she gone&mdash;is Betty dead, dear?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, my father!' sobbed poor Frances again, and seemed unable to find
  other words.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Cromwell came down the passage, and with her the Lord
  Claypole.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' said His Highness, 'is it over? And I left her&mdash;yet only for a
  little&mdash;and she is gone.'</p>

  <p>His wife came and put her arms round his neck and wept on his shoulder a
  little, then she took his hand and led him to their daughter's chamber,
  followed by those two other mourners, also sick with grief and watching.</p>

  <p>Elisabeth Claypole lay dead, she had fallen from one convulsion fit to
  another, and breathed her last breath, in great pain and suffering, but with
  a composed and cheerful mind and a serene and hopeful soul.</p>

  <p>She was dead; very young she looked as she lay in the great bed in the
  darkened chamber with the shadows over her; the rich coverlet was
  straightened across her limbs, the sheet smoothed, the pillow shaken; she was
  at peace after the long tossings to and fro, the hot nights of agony, the
  dragging days of unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>Very small she looked and delicate; her hair seemed like a handful of fine
  silk on the pillow, her hands white flowers on the coverlet; her head was
  drooping slightly sideways, and the gentle look she wore in life had
  returned, effacing all trace of suffering.</p>

  <p>There were many standing round her; all made way at the approach of His
  Highness; he came up to the bed and looked down at her.</p>

  <p>'"My life is waxen old with heaviness,"' he murmured, '"and my years with
  mourning...I am become like a broken vessel."'</p>

  <p>He bent over her stillness, his transient sorrow breaking vainly against
  her eternal repose.</p>

  <p>'"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,"' said Elisabeth Cromwell, and
  touched her husband's hand.</p>

  <p>He went to his knees on the bed-step and put his head on his folded
  hands.</p>

  <p>'May He who sitteth above the waterflood comfort me&mdash;for in myself I
  can do nothing!' he muttered.</p>

  <p>They left him there, for they thought that he prayed but it was not so;
  the valiant spirit had been robbed of its matchless fortitude at last; His
  Highness was in a swoon of anguish.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4-09"
     id="ch4-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. EXIT HIS HIGHNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">From that day he sickened rapidly; his strength fell from
  him with a suddenness that amazed those about him. He attended business as
  usual, wearing the purple of royal mourning, but the heaviness of his spirit
  was noticed by all.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of August, George Fox, the Quaker, came to Hampton Court
  to see His Highness about the persecution of the Friends; he went by river,
  and soon after he stepped ashore at Hampton he saw His Highness riding at the
  head of his Life Guards, going towards the palace under the shade of the
  riverside trees.</p>

  <p>George Fox waited until the cavalcade, which was coming slowly towards
  him, into Hampton Court Park, had reached him, gazing steadily the while at
  that figure of His Highness, drooping a little in the saddle and looking
  ahead of him, with an extraordinary air of stillness.</p>

  <p>'I felt and saw,' wrote Fox afterwards when he was back in his cobbler's
  shop in London, 'a waft of death go forth against him, and when I came to him
  he looked like a dead man.'</p>

  <p>His Highness was very courteous; he checked his horse when he saw the
  patient figure, russet-clad, with the broad-brimmed hat, waiting for him, and
  welcomed Fox as warmly as he had done two years before when the Quaker saw
  him at Hyde Park corner among his Guards, and pressed to his carriage window,
  and spoke to him gravely&mdash;as he spoke to him now, warning him, and
  laying before him the sufferings of the Friends, even as the spirit moved him
  to do.</p>

  <p>His Highness listened; the stillness of his demeanour, remarkable in one
  naturally so full of energy and eloquence, did not alter; he said very
  little, only kindly bade Fox come and see him at his house next day.</p>

  <p>And so he rode on slowly towards the red palace, 'and I,' wrote Fox in his
  <i>Journal</i>, 'never saw him more.'</p>

  <p>For the following day, when he came from Kingston to Hampton again, the
  doctors would let no one see His Highness, who was fallen worse&mdash;of a
  tertian ague, they said&mdash;and would never ride at the head of his famous
  Guard again, either through Hampton Court Park or anywhere else. George Fox
  had been the last to see the Lord-Protector on horseback, girt with a
  sword.</p>

  <p>Soon after he was moved by coach to London, where the air was thought to
  be better for his complaint; St. James's Palace, that he intended to lodge
  at, not being immediately ready, he was taken to Whitehall, and on the
  Wednesday following half the nation was praying for him, and half waiting
  breathlessly, for a great deliverance.'</p>

  <p>In Whitehall, a meeting of preachers and godly persons besought God with
  prayers and tears to spare His Highness, and all over the city were
  apprehension, expectation, hopes, fears, and supplication.</p>

  <p>So it had come to this; the twenty years of great events, with all the
  toil, achievement, triumph, tumult, and sorrow, had swept up to this moment
  when the gentleman farmer from St. Ives, who had received a command from God,
  lay dying at Whitehall, with that command executed as far as it is in a man
  to accomplish a mission he conceives Divine, dying, with England breathless,
  and the son of the late tyrant breathless too, and watching and waiting from
  across the water.</p>

  <p>It seemed to many valiant souls as if this England so violently shaped
  anew into something of the form which was the ideal of Puritanism, purged and
  glorified, was no more than the vivified dream of this one man, and that when
  he passed from the earth it would be as when a sleeper wakes&mdash;the dream
  would be dispelled and all things become as they had been.</p>

  <p>What he himself might think, now that he knew the summons had come, none
  could tell, for he was mostly silent during the ebb and flow of his illness,
  and only spoke to pray; once or twice the passionate entreaties to God, which
  he heard rising around him, and the passionate affection of his family and
  friends, seemed to rouse in him a desire and hope of life. He could not but
  know that his work was not yet finished, and that this was not the best of
  times for him to die.</p>

  <p>'Lord, Thou knowest,' he said, 'that if I do desire to live, it is to show
  forth Thy praise and declare Thy works!' and, 'is there none that says, Who
  will deliver me from this peril?' then, 'Man can do nothing; God can do what
  He will.'</p>

  <p>And at times he fell into a kind of enthusiasm, speaking much of the
  Covenants of Works and of Grace and expounding them; to his wife and
  children, who felt their very life being torn from them, he spoke, too; 'Love
  not this world'&mdash;he repeated the words with great vehemence, as was his
  wont&mdash;'I say, love not this world; it is not good that you should love
  this world&mdash;children, live like Christians. I leave you the Covenant to
  feed on!'</p>

  <p>But for the most he had done with human affection; weeping did not seem to
  touch that heart that had once been so tender to tears.</p>

  <p>He did not even look at those about him, but upwards at the dark canopy of
  his bed; and to that inner eye which had beheld the sword stretched out of
  the cloud in the barn at St. Ives, it was no covering of tapestry which hung
  above him, but the threshold of the eternal world.</p>

  <p>The dry wind, which had begun before the Lady Elisabeth died, and blown
  for weeks across the Island from sea to sea, deepened and strengthened now
  from day to day, and at the end of this month of August, when His Highness
  was rapidly coming to the end of all storms and calms alike, a hurricane of
  wind arose&mdash;the most fearful, violent, and protracted any man could
  remember.</p>

  <p>It was drawing near to that most glorious day for Oliver Cromwell and his
  cause, the 3rd of September, the anniversary of Dunbar and Worcester, and of
  the calling of the first Parliament of His Highness&mdash;a day of general
  thanksgivings and triumph to all Puritans.</p>

  <p>As the stormy winds rocked Whitehall Palace and rattled at the window out
  of which Charles Stewart had stepped to die, and at the window of the room
  where the Lord-Protector lay, His Highness rallied from his slumbers and sat
  upright in his great bed and listened to the tempest, as a soldier might sit
  up in the dark and listen the night before a battle.</p>

  <p>'I think I am the poorest wretch alive,' he said, 'but I love God, or,
  rather, am beloved by Him&mdash;I am a conqueror and more than a
  conqueror&mdash;"<i>through Christ which strengtheneth me</i>"'&mdash;so he
  repeated again the words which had saved him once, long ago. But as he sat
  up, hearkening to the blowing winds without, his comfort seemed to go from
  him.</p>

  <p>'It is a fearful thing,' he said, 'to fall into the hands of the Living
  God!'</p>

  <p>He raised himself up and stretched out his hand towards the wind as if he
  appealed to something in that tumult outside his palace.</p>

  <p>'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God!' he cried
  again.</p>

  <p>So high and loud the wind howled that those about him shivered as if they
  feared to be struck by some supernatural force; but Cromwell sat erect, and
  again cried out, 'I say it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
  Living God!'</p>

  <p>One of the chaplains praying in the adjoining chamber heard his Highness'
  raised and agonized voice and entered the sick-room.</p>

  <p>To him Oliver Cromwell turned eagerly.</p>

  <p>'<i>Tell me</i>,' he asked, in a voice of intense wistfulness, '<i>is it
  possible to fall from Grace</i>?'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' said the pastor, 'it is not possible.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said the dying man, '<i>I am saved, for I know that I was once in
  Grace</i>.'</p>

  <p>He clasped his hands, and the family and friends about him, whom he seemed
  to have forgotten, heard, in the pauses of the wind, his prayer&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Lord, though I am a miserable and wretched creature, I am in Covenant
  with Thee through Grace! And I may&mdash;I will&mdash;come to Thee, for Thy
  people! Thou hast made me, though very unworthy, a mean instrument to do them
  some good, and Thee service&mdash;many of them have set too high a value on
  me, others wish and would be glad of my death&mdash;Lord, however Thou do
  dispose of me, continue and go on and do good for them.'</p>

  <p>His voice rose now like the voice of a well man, almost as strong as the
  voice that had greeted with a psalm the rising sun before Dunbar.</p>

  <p>'Give them consistency of judgment, one heart, and mutual love&mdash;and
  go on to deliver them, and with the work of reformation&mdash;and make the
  name of Christ glorious in the world. Teach those who look too much on Thy
  Instruments to depend more upon Thyself. Pardon such as desire to trample on
  the dust of a poor worm, for they are Thy people too.'</p>

  <p>'And pardon the folly of this short prayer&mdash;even for Jesus Christ's
  sake. And give us a good night, if it be Thy pleasure. Amen!'</p>

  <p>And after this he lay down among his pillows and slept, despite the
  storm.</p>

  <p>And there began to be whispers about the succession, which hitherto no one
  had dared name.</p>

  <p>The faithful Thurloe approached his bed and asked him who was to be his
  successor.</p>

  <p>At which His Highness turned his head and was silent.</p>

  <p>'The Lord Richard?' whispered Thurloe, and the Lord-Protector was believed
  to answer, 'Yes, yes,' but no man could be sure of what he said. Henry
  Cromwell was absent; the rest of his family were near him, but he seemed to
  forget them. Only twice he asked intensely for <i>Robert, Robert</i>, my
  eldest son.'</p>

  <p>He fell now into great pains, but with them came great cheerfulness of
  spirit.</p>

  <p>'God is good,' he was heard to say&mdash;'indeed, He is&mdash;God is
  good&mdash;my work is, done. Yet God be with His people.'</p>

  <p>On the eve of the thanksgiving day, which shall never be kept as a
  thanksgiving day again, save by an oppressed people, secretly in their
  hearts, the victor of the battles which made the 3rd of September glorious
  was seen to be very near the end of his restlessness and his pain.</p>

  <p>His sad, forlorn wife (who saw but dark days ahead of her) besought him to
  drink and sleep and held out a cup to him.</p>

  <p>'It is not my design to drink or sleep,' he answered, 'but my design is to
  make what haste I can to be gone.'</p>

  <p>All through the windy night he prayed brokenly; once he spoke of Harrison,
  and seemed troubled; once he asked God to spare Betty further pain, and again
  he said, 'Is Robert dead?&mdash;and Oliver?'</p>

  <p>When the sun was up over city and golden river, and the vast crowds
  waiting anxiously, His Highness had fallen to silence.</p>

  <p>That afternoon the Lord ungirt the sword with which he had invested His
  Captain twenty years before, and in Whitehall Palace Oliver Cromwell's
  lifeless body lay&mdash;and the nation flew asunder into confusion.</p>
