<h1>The Rowdy</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>Octave Thanet</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>MIKE HOLLIN'S nineteenth birthday was eventful. To have you understand
how eventful, it is necessary to draw Mike's portrait. He was the seventh
child of Thomas Hollin, an honest black-smith who could &mdash; and did
&mdash; boast that he had never scamped a piece of work, broken his word,
or taken the sight of man's fists in his face without fighting. Hollin
belonged to a trades-union, but it was a trades-union of the
old-fashioned kind; and he despised the "new-fangled notions" of the
Knights of Labor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollin may be called a semi-American; although her father was an
Irishman, and her mother the daughter of an Irishman with a touch of some
other nationality, she herself was born in Ohio; and a race that has been
a certain time in America becomes, as it were, aired off, and the strong
national flavor evaporates. Annie Hollin's brogue was enlivened by
American idioms; in the same way her temperament had felt the climate;
she was nervous, energetic, warm-hearted, hot-tempered, and tidy. Did you
see her wiry little shape of a Saturday afternoon, hurling huge pailfuls
of water over her back fence into the convenient ravine that served the
neighborhood as a reservoir for tin cans, garbage, and diphtheria, you
would call her "a genuine American." Did you see her face, &mdash; a
small, round face, with a short nose, long upper lip, brilliant blue
eyes, and black hair, &mdash; you would call her, just as decidedly, "an
Irishwoman, of course." But even her Irish face had an American touch,
for she wore her hair clipped short like a man's: she never had time for
long hair, she said. All her life she had been looking forward to a day
of sufficient leisure to "do up her hair"; so far, the leisure was a
mirage, receding as life advanced. Hollin was her third husband. The
other two she had lost; one by death, one by divorce. She had seen hard
days, had wept over little coffins, and known what it was to be cold, and
hungry, and bruised. If she had not, &mdash; so she sometimes told
Hollin, &mdash; she never would have married again.</p>

<p>It was not Hollin's way to retort on such occasions, he being a man of
deep experience in the married state &mdash; a widower with six children
on his second wedding-day. He only puffed the harder at his pipe, and, if
the atmosphere grew too dense, put on his hat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollin was not a bad stepmother: she kept the children warm,
neat, and well fed; if she cuffed them vigorously in her tempers, she
made amends by lavish indulgence at other times, and there never was a
more fearless or devoted nurse in sickness. Mike was the couple's only
child. Notwithstanding his advent, the family circle dwindled. Tom, the
eldest son, a stolid, good fellow like his father, married and moved to
another town; two of the sisters died of diphtheria; the eldest girl was
married; one sister went out to service; the brother next to Mike fell
into the cistern, and before Mike left school he was the only child at
home. This departure from school occurred suddenly when Mike was
fourteen; the direct cause being his father's running up against him just
as he swaggered out of a saloon.</p>

<p>"That's what they learn ye at school, is it?" said old Tom, grimly.
"Time you was at work!" And to work Mike went the very next morning, in
spite of his mother's protestations and promises. Many were the tears
shed by Annie Hollin because of Mike's lost "learning"; for she gave the
fetish-like worship of her class to "education."</p>

<p>But Mike did not regret the school. Study was irksome to him, and work
suited him better than any one could have expected; he really had plenty
of energy. Moreover, Hollin had shrewdly gaged the youngster's mind. He
told him that he could have all he made over two dollars a week. The work
was piece-work, and Mike very soon rose out of his humble beginning as
errand-boy for the foreman in the machine-shop of the Agricultural
Implement Company, for which his father worked, to a bench of his own,
and the right to counter-sink cultivator-shovels at ten cents a
hundred.</p>

<p>Mike's spiritual training was not cut short like his secular
education; on the contrary, although his father never went to church, and
his mother seldom, I am inclined to think that the boy suffered from a
plethora of religious advantages. He attended no less than four
Sunday-schools &mdash; Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopal, and
Unitarian. He went to the first school because his mother had been born
in the Church of Rome, and, long since estranged from it, still felt its
attraction, and cherished vague hopes of reconciliation &mdash; when she
could afford it. Therefore, she sent Mike to Father Kelly as clay to the
potter. The other three Sunday-schools Mike attended on his own account
because they had picnics and Christmas-trees.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that his religious instruction was variegated, even
contradictory. Little, however, did contradictions trouble our young
heretic; since his four guides each told him a different story of the way
of life, he took a short cut out of all difficulties by believing none of
them. At sixteen Mike was beyond reach of such modest bribery as
Christmas-trees and picnics can offer. He preferred to spend his Sundays
dangling his legs from an empty packing-box at the street corner, puffing
at a rank cigar, his ears gulping down unsavory gossip, taking new
lessons in the cheap vices; at intervals (presuming him to have a few
pennies, or some talker in the crowd to be in a generous mood) refreshing
himself at the adjacent saloons. The town being under so-called
"prohibitory laws," you couldn't throw a stone anywhere without hitting a
green screen.</p>

<p>By the time he was nineteen Mike knew how to drink, smoke, swear
fluently, box in a crude fashion, and lose his money at any gambling game
without wincing. He knew some other ways of pleasing the devil, if one
may believe his father; in fact, he was a rowdy, the kind of fellow that
women hurry past on the streets. But none the less was he his mother's
idol. She dowered him with all the treasures of her dreams, from curly
hair &mdash; the best you could say of Mike's red locks was that they
were crooked at the ends &mdash; to a sweet disposition. He was such a
handy boy about the house (Mike did care for his mother in a careless
way, and had the grace to help her, occasionally, with a tub or a basket
of wood). Then Mike wasn't like "them Murray boys, &mdash; never could
spend an evening home, always loafing and guzzling at the saloons,
&mdash; Mike was a great reader, he read aloud beautifully!" If only
Hollin had let him get an education, there was no knowing where he would
have stopped. The truth was, Mike read a socialist newspaper, and some
novels of the baser sort.</p>

<p>Yet I am not denying some virtues in the mire. By nature Mike had a
sweet temper. He was neither envious nor churlish; and he was kind to
helpless creatures, the fowls, the dog, the cow, and the children. He had
a distorted sense of honor, that, so far, getting tangled up with his
class feeling, had done him more harm than good. For instance, honor,
egged on by class feeling, hampered him in his work, not permitting him
to be industrious or a notable artisan, of which there were the makings
in Mike, for he was nice-fingered, quick-witted, and patient; but where
work is done by the piece, it is not considered square to the other
fellows to do too many pieces daily. Should you be so inconsiderate, the
"boss" may put down the price on you; then, the slow workers will be in
trouble, while the brisk workers cannot make any more. Therefore a shrewd
mechanic will "nurse his job!"</p>

<p>Mike brimmed over with class feeling. He belonged to a union and to
the Knights of Labor, and to a mysterious organization without a name
that carried its aims farther than most men out of the penitentiary care
to go. All the enthusiasm, all the capacity for reckless devotion, that
belong to his own age and his mother's race, poured into this one channel
&mdash; zeal for his class. Mike was as proud because he was a Knight of
Labor as any medieval knight ever was of his gold spurs. He bragged and
he fought for the order &mdash; bragged to his father, and fought three
miserable "rats" in the shop that refused to join the Knights and
resented having their tools stolen: that was how his nose got broken. He
made sacrifices for the cause, going without tobacco one whole month that
he might contribute his share to what his father called "the foolest fool
strike in the country."</p>

<p>Mike was capable of hero-worship also; he admired the foreman of his
shop, Bill Nicker, who once had drawn a fifty-dollar prize in the
Louisiana Lottery, and henceforth was a prime authority on betting, and
knew how to drive so well that the livery stables would trust him with
fast horses. Only second to this hero was a big fellow in the blacksmith
shop about whom there was a dark rumor that he had once stood up against
John L. Sullivan, in a round at an exhibition, with bare fists! Mike
himself never would make a pugilist, because he was a stunted little
creature, agile and enduring, but small like his mother. All the more did
he esteem inches and muscle. Secretly he admired his father; though
Hollin made no secret that he despised his son.</p>

<p>"He ain't no good, and never will be," fumed Tom; "calling himself a
Knight of Labor, striking for every cat that squalls; wanting to buy
cigars, &mdash; what business 'as a kid like 'im got with cigars, anyhow?
&mdash; not wanting to buy them at Carter's, 'cause Carter's men was on
the strike! Now what the &mdash; &mdash; is it his look-out what Carter's
men does? They doesn't consult us when they strikes, and why the &mdash;
&mdash; should we be paying for their fun? 'Tain't the way I was brought
up. And them Knights ain't the wust, neither. He belongs to some other
society that he keeps almighty dark about. Guess the darker he keeps the
better. That Bill Nicker's a bad egg; if he don't end on the gallows, I
miss my guess. And Mike's lucky if he don't git there with him. He's
going to the devil fast's I ever see a boy yet."</p>

<p>"No, he ain't, neither!" Hollin's wife, who naturally got most of
these gruesome suspicions, would cry. "No, he ain't; and you know it,
Hollin. And you ought to be 'shamed talkin' so of your own son. Mike may
be a little wild; but he never got drunk in his life, and he'll come out
all right, you'll see."</p>

<p>Perhaps in his secret soul old Tom craved to be proved wrong; for he
never resented Annie's vehemence; rather, at times he seemed to invite
it, as if he would see the other side of the argument, if he could.</p>

<p>In fact, however, Mike's society justified his father's fears. The
doctrines would have scared any one except an anarchist. All the regular
orders of labor have an unacknowledged and desperate kind of following,
that are to them what guerrillas are to armies. Few people understand how
important a part such irregulars play in strikes. The younger and wilder
spirits belong to these secret bands; they are the ones having least to
lose and most to gain, are always ready for a strike, tickled at the
notion of the holiday, sure of being supported in idleness while the
strike lasts (never having a penny of their own by any chance to fall
back on), glad to get the better wage if the strike be successful, hardly
the worse in any event.</p>

<p>Bill Nicker, already mentioned, was the originator of Mike's society;
Tom Hollin, junior, afterward declared that Bill made most of it up "out
of his own head." I cannot say how far he was right: certainly Mike had
no suspicions; he believed in the society, and all its vague and
tremendous penalties, with unction; he was afire to distinguish himself,
and felt vastly superior to the workmen who did not belong.</p>

<p>Long ago said wise Francis of Verulam: "There is nothing makes a man
suspect much, more than to know little." Every man or boy &mdash; to say
truth, most of the members were nearer boyhood than manhood &mdash; in
Mike's society was convinced that he was wronged, even where he could not
place the wrong. And, as ignorance is equally as hopeful as suspicious,
they gave to Nicker's artless schemes for turning the world upside down a
faith that ought to move mountains.</p>

<p>Nicker was a socialist, anarchist, moral out-law, every inch of him,
having that facility for turning sentences that often passes for logic.
He didn't always quite know what he meant himself, and his hearers never
did, but they listened to his flatulent eloquence with awe. He was not a
lover of humanity, he had none of the pathetic frenzy of longing to help
the woes of the world, which goads on many socialists: not he, not
William Nicker, who could smoke his pipe when home on a strike, and let
his wife fill her tubs to earn him drink-money; but he did have an
unaffected hatred of the rich that he was convinced was sympathy for the
poor. Thus he was a fanatic, with something of the fanatic's momentum.
Mike considered him one of the great reformers of the century; but Mike's
father, having been put to some trouble by Nicker's shifty workmanship,
was outspoken against him, and usually called him "Gasbag."</p>

<p>Nicker was the real mover in the strange experience that came to Mike
on his birthday. There had been a change of ownership in the works. A new
company had bought them, and a new superintendent had been sent to the
shops. The men were suspicious of the change; Nicker said harsh things of
the owners. But Hollin exulted. For one thing, his son Tom was coming
with Mr. Thorne; and Tom was the good, dutiful son whom old Tom loved,
the rising man of whom old Tom was proud.</p>

<p>"They say the new superintendent ain't much more'n a boy," Mike
grumbled on one occasion.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said old Tom, "one thing in his favor; he learned the
business in the shop, come back from college, and put on his overalls,
and got up at six, and kept hours. Say he kin do anything in the shops;
invented a dandy spring to the cultivators; knows a good job from a poor
one across the street: that's the sort for me!"</p>

<p>"Bill Nicker says he's a spy," said Mike; "says he worked in the shop
and found out how much the fellers kin do if they hump themselves; and
kept doing that much; so they put down the price."</p>

<p>"I mind Bill Nicker came from the Thornes', and he got a hand mashed
fooling with a punch. They paid him his wages full time and all the
doctor's bills &mdash; "</p>

<p>"That's 'cause they're insured; Bill told me 'bout it."</p>

<p>"Guess they got to pay fer insurance, then. Pay comes at one end or
'nother; no great difference 'cept to a fool like Bill. And they sent him
off &mdash; oh, I know all 'bout Gasbag &mdash; they sent him off fer
stirring up bad blood with the men. He got up a strike; but it didn't
pay, and the Knights' Lodge there was close to firing him, they was. If
ye want to know, that's why he hates Thorne like pizen." The old man
puffed a minute, then summed up his case: "Tell ye, Mike, them Thornes is
pretty decent folks, and fer one I'm glad they bought us out. I know they
give their men fair living wages, and some of the older ones gits a share
of the profits. There's Tom; he was keen to have me go there when he
left; now he's a foreman, been with 'em three year, and got his wages
raised twice without his saying a word. He gits thirty dollars a week
now. I wish to the Lord I'd gone with him when he first went, for he says
they know a good man when they see him, and are willing to pay for good
work."</p>

<p>"Well, I know one thing," said Mike, sulkily, "we ain't a-going to
have any interference with our organizing here. That young Thorne's got
to quit fighting organized labor, or we'll strike!"</p>

<p>"My, what a long tail our cat's got!" said old Tom, with a Rabelaisian
grimace. "Guess you better try to see what good work you kin do, and, my
word for it, you won't have to strike. Look at Tom. He don't belong to no
Union nor no Knights, and he's clumb up and up and up!"</p>

<p>"I ain't a-going to desert my comrades, anyhow," came round the corner
of Mike's collar.</p>

<p>His father took a stride forward, and tapped him on the shoulder. The
old man looked very tall, there at his elbow, and Mike was impressed by
something unusual, almost solemn, in his expression.</p>

<p>"Mike," he said, "I've been living and thinking a good while; and I
know enough to know I ain't going to do a bit of good by talking to you.
No matter; it'll free my mind to tell. You're all wrong, boy, clean
wrong, you and your societies. The way to help all the other fellers is
to be a decent feller yourself. And it's a heap easier fer the strongest
feller to climb the hill fust, and then &mdash; and all the while &mdash;
be lendin' a hand to the hindmost, than it is to have the strong one stay
underneath a-boostin' and a-boostin' up fellers that ain't got sprawl
enough to help themselves when they are boosted. I tell ye, Mike, it's
all wrong."</p>

<p>Mike was not convinced, but he was cowed by his father's earnestness;
he took refuge in sulky silence, glad to see the shop doors.</p>

<p>The superintendent came. He was a tall, slim, smiling young fellow, in
the last fashion of clothes, with very bright, dark eyes. He did look
absurdly young and gentle, &mdash; "pretty as a girl!" jeered Mike,
&mdash; but there was a faint contraction of the eyebrows giving to those
bright and soft dark eyes a mingled steadiness and keenness of gaze, and
a look that in a man's face never means but one thing.</p>

<p>"He's a hard hitter when he's mad, or I miss my guess," said old
Tom.</p>

<p>The first thing to happen was a strike, the cause being persecution of
organized labor, insomuch as Thorne had discharged four members of Mike's
nameless society for drunkenness and inefficiency. Nicker was one of the
men discharged. He had declared that it was not possible for his men to
turn out more work a day than they did, without injury to the quality of
the work; Thorne had replied that more work was done in the other shops,
and if Nicker couldn't get it done, he would try to find some one who
could. Nicker kicked the metal wheel in his hands to the end of the shop,
and picked up his coat, profanely giving Thorne permission to try.</p>

<p>The condition of affairs was ripe for mischief. The former owners had
been neither better nor worse than the bulk of their kind. As they
themselves said, they were not running the implement business as a
missionary enterprise, but to make money; it did not strike them as
unfair or especially hard-hearted to pare down the men's wages in winter,
when work was slack, and the shop could afford an idle time far better
than workingmen with families. If the men did not like the wages, they
could quit, which option the hotheads were for taking; but they, in
general, had no children to clothe, or stoves to keep going, or butchers
and bakers to satisfy. The men grumbled; but they did not strike. They
organized, and bided their chance. Thorne walked into a crater. The
season was summer now; the shops were running full time on heavy orders;
it was the men's turn at the screw. Nicker was mightily busy with
insinuations; whispering ugly stories about the Thornes' determination to
root out labor organizations, and splendid promises of success &mdash; if
they all pulled together. On the other hand, Tom Hollin and the men that
came with Thorne represented that the new company (Thorne's father and
brothers) were fair men, who made their contracts at the beginning of the
year, and stood by them. They wouldn't ask better men to work for.</p>

<p>But an uneasy suspicion clings to the workman outside the unions and
too successful to side with his mates. Tom Hollin had bought a house; his
wife kept a hired girl; Sunday afternoons he would go driving in a buggy,
with his wife and baby, dressed up like a gentleman. "You couldn't expect
such a man to be in touch with the toiling millions!" declaimed Bill
Nicker. Nevertheless, the Hollins and a few more of the cautious workmen
did succeed in averting a general strike, and in persuading the local
Knights of Labor to be neutral. Thus from the first the strike was
doomed; in less than a week's time Thorne had filled half the empty
benches with new men. The strikers began to be frightened. They sent a
deputation to Thorne, who told them that what places were not already
filled were open to the first comers; he would not discharge the men he
had hired. While he spoke he brushed an insignificant mustache with a
hot-house rose, looking more amiable and girlish than ever; but he was no
more to be stirred than the huge engine buzzing outside.</p>

<p>"They don't belong to the Knights or the union or nothing," urged
Mike, one of the deputation.</p>

<p>"Don't they?" said the superintendent. "I didn't inquire. If they do
their work well, they are free to belong to a dozen labor organizations
or to none. It is none of my business; I shall go on filling the places
as fast as I can. For you boys, I advise you to come back quick, while
there are any jobs left."</p>

<p>"And how about Ransom, and O'Brien, and Schreiner, and me?" said
Nicker.</p>

<p>"All of you, Mr. Nicker, will have to go somewhere else than
here."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that, Mr. Thorne. If this is going to be a scab shop,
you'll find it isn't easy running it; and these men that have taken the
bread out of our children's mouths, let them look out for
themselves!"</p>

<p>The deputation went away, keeping a high crest, but inwardly
disheartened by Thorne's composure. Tom Hollin, to this day, maintains
that whatever their anger and disappointment, they would not have gone
beyond petty intimidations with the new men, but for Nicker; to him Tom
always charged the lamentable bloodshed that followed. Thorne gave
warning that, at all hazards, he would protect his men. He kept his word;
the most turbulent week that the little Western city had ever known ended
in a frantic riot, with utter rout to the strikers, a score of broken
heads and limbs, a policeman stabbed, and one poor lad struck so heavily
that he could never wring his mother's heart again. Poor Patsy was the
only son of a widow, the best-hearted fellow in the world when sober. He
belonged to Mike's society. Mike himself helped carry him home, and came
away crying.</p>

<p>Squalid, needless, futile tragedy that it was, it had more needless,
more tragical possibilities in its wake. It is not an easy thing to
propose assassination to American workingmen, even to young anarchists;
but when, that night, Nicker rose in the garret that served his society
for a council-chamber, and glanced from one bruised and lowering face to
another, he recognized he image of his own passions.</p>

<p>With hardly a dissenting voice, Arthur van Rensselaer Thorne,
superintendent of the Ernsdale Agricultural Implement Company, was tried
by this modern Fehmgericht, for murder, convicted, and condemned to
death. The execution of the sentence was to be deferred for two weeks,
lest suspicion should be turned in the real quarter; for the same reason
the strike was declared off. There only remained to settle who should be
the executioner, and Michael Hollin drew the black lot. This it was that
happened to him on his nineteenth birthday. He held out the palm of his
hand, and they all could see it; very likely not a man there but drew a
breath of relief.</p>

<p>"I am ready," said Mike in an even voice. Nicker, watching the lad
keenly, nodded once or twice; there were certain dusky labyrinths in his
memory where he did not often care to rummage; perhaps they held faces
with a like sinister radiance to that shining through Mike's freckles.
"He'll do," decided the socialist.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he made him a sign to wait after the others had gone,
having it in mind to "hearten him up a bit"; which he accomplished by
kicking aside the huddle of chairs and pushing Mike past the eddies of
stale tobacco smoke and dust from shuffling feet, until they stood under
the full glare of the gas-jets, and then saying, in his most impressive
chest-tones, "Remember our laws. If Thorne doesn't die, you will! Think
of that when you weaken."</p>

<p>"I ain't going to weaken," said Mike.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe you," said Nicker, heartily. "The social revolution
would come quicker if there were more like you. Say, have you got any
change about you? Let's go take a drink."</p>

<p>"I guess I don't care for a drink," said Mike; "here's a quarter,
though, you're welcome to. It's all I got."</p>

<p>The exhilaration that Mike experienced when the great man first
condescended to borrow small sums had been dulled by repetition of late;
and his cynical levity jarred on the boy's strained mood. "He hadn't
ought to drink to-night," &mdash; thus for a daring second he ventured to
criticize his chief, &mdash; "it ain't no drinking business he's got us
into."</p>

<p>There was a relief when he could bid Nicker good night (every detail
having been settled), and was free to go his own way. Mike's home was on
the hills, and his custom was to ride up the long street on the electric
cars; but tonight he did not hail the flashing thing that roared past
him, spattering blue and green fire off the rails.</p>

<p>"Ain't it like the devil?" occurred to Mike. "It ain't near so much
like the devil, really, though, as them saloons" &mdash; he stood
opposite one, at the moment, able to see Nicker's square shoulders and
the back of the hand with which he wiped his black mustache, while he
spent Mike's quarter &mdash; "I guess I won't drink any more."</p>

<p>How devious and amazing are the ways of that strong spirit which,
Christian or pagan, we may well call the Holy Ghost. Here is a young
ruffian, whose life has been for years as evil as his wages would allow,
who now is pledged to commit an atrocious crime; yet the weight of this
very crime on his soul is crushing out his trivial vices. He, the idle,
dissolute rowdy about to become an assassin, is nearer salvation than he
ever was in his ignoble life. For the first time poor Mike tried to
understand the meaning of duty and devotion. In some indistinct fashion
the cruel deed that he was to do seemed to him a sacrificial act, and
himself a priest of justice. He was no longer simply Mike Hollin, he was
the representative of the avengers of the poor, who dealt with the
tremendous issues of life and death. He was awed. "I guess I'll behave as
well's I know how," said Mike.</p>

<p>He had mounted the hill, where lights were still shining from upper
stories, behind dainty curtains; and now he turned into a side street.
The houses grew smaller; and gradually the red slipped out of the windows
until there was no light visible except in one house, a little yellow
cottage on the slope of a hill. There was a garden about the house with
an old-fashioned garnishment of peonies and hollyhocks; the latter sprung
so close to the walls and the bright window that the stalks were not only
drawn but faintly tinted, the pink splashes showing amid the green.</p>

<p>Mike knew why that single window was bright while all the homes around
were soundless and dark. He looked at it as he whispered: "Patsy, do you
hear? I'm glad it's me will do it. Rest easy, Patsy, boy; we'll pay him
up! We'll revenge you!" Then he recoiled and hurried away, for he had
seen a shape cross the translucent white screen &mdash; a little, bent
woman's shape, a knitted shawl drawn over the gray head. "She ain't much
bigger'n ma," thought Mike, swallowing at a lump in his throat. Again he
could hear the little, wrinkled creature's wail above her son. Never but
the one cry over and over, "Oh, he was always such a good boy to me!"</p>

<p>"It's more'n ma could rightly say for me," said Mike to himself; "but
she would, though; you bet she would! Poor ma, I ain't done right by her,
and that's a fact. I'll fill the wood-boxes to-morrow, by &mdash; &mdash;
."</p>

<p>The Hollins lived in a Mississippi town, not yet so old that the high
bluffs have been cleft in any rectangular order; there remain picturesque
ravines between streets, and hills tied together by slight wooden bridges
that echo hollowly to the tread, and shady slopes with foot-paths under
the bur-oaks. Such a bridge Mike crossed, and rested his elbows on the
railing just where the string-course sags on its crooked piles. Although
an electric lamp swings from its tower above the further bank, like a
luminous porcupine, radiating fuzzy needles of light on the first half of
the bridge, the shadow of the bank blocks off the last span. It is very
dark. Sometimes the water stagnates in the hollow underneath, and the
frogs croak. Always it is a lonesome, uncanny spot, past which belated
children scamper on winter evenings. Mike laid his eyes on the bright
path. Some night &mdash; a night not so far away &mdash; he must stand in
the selfsame place, peering out of the dusk as he peered now, waiting,
watching, until a light figure should step on the planks with an elastic
footfall that Mike knew, should traverse the little portion of the road
in the lamplight, and so &mdash; pass into the darkness and the jaws of
death!</p>

<p>Everything was cunningly planned. Nicker had fitted in each detail,
down to the alibi ready next day for Mike. There would be the revels at
half a dozen saloons, three trusty comrades of the Fehmgericht to bear
witness to the hours (omitting only one), a simulated drunkenness by
Mike, and, finally, the bearing of him home, in the guise of a sodden and
helpless wreck, to be put to bed by his mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't need to be afraid, Mike," Nicker had chuckled, half an
hour ago; "we'll see you through. I know the ropes."</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid," said Mike. Nor was he afraid now; but his nerves
thrilled as a violin-string will vibrate to a strong chord. He glanced
from the light that was shining on Patsy O'Connor's winding-sheet to a
light burning across the ravine where his mother waited for him, and he
thought, "I wonder has he any folks." Then he set his face homeward,
knitting his brows. All the way he could see the light.</p>

<p>His father flung the door open before Mike's thumb was off the gate
latch.</p>

<p>Mike saw the room inside: the new brass lamp glowing on the table; the
short waves of his mother's black hair; the lines in her worn little face
painted in broad strokes by the light; and the gay rags, tumbled on her
white apron, for the mat that she was knitting &mdash; to lie in front of
Mike's bed. She looked up, and her lips trembled while she smiled.</p>

<p>"You're late, Mike." His father speaks sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," says Mike, with an extraordinary meekness, &mdash;
to-night he has no more heart to squabble than he has had to carouse,
&mdash; "there was a meeting, and the strike's declared off. I came right
home after the meeting. I ain't been drinking, pa."</p>

<p>"Had any money left to drink on?" grunts old Tom. "Um &mdash; m
&mdash; m!" &mdash; the grunt, this time, that of the justified seer, as
Mike shakes his head, looking foolish &mdash; "I thought as much. Well,
go into the kitchen and git your supper; your ma would save it for you. I
told her like's not you was killed. Got hurted at all, hey?"</p>

<p>"No, pa."</p>

<p>To hear Hollin's snarl, one would infer that he was rather
disappointed at Mike's escape, whole and clean of limb &mdash; the fact
being that young Tom and he had scoured the town for news; and since he
had come home (on assurance from a friendly policeman that his boy was
safe), he had been pacing the floor, pouring out his anxieties by jerks,
for his wife to contradict.</p>

<p>"And didn't I tell you he wouldn't be hurt?" shrilly chimed in Mrs.
Hollin, among whose virtues magnanimity will not be reckoned at the last
day. "And, Mike, don't you mind a word he says, or Tom, neither, for he's
glad enough you're not laying alongside Patsy O'Connor; and so's Tom. And
Clara was crying, she was so scared about you; but I fried you some liver
and apples, and there's coffee &mdash; if it ain't all sizzled away; I
guessed you'd like a hot supper better'n me cryin' &mdash; "</p>

<p>Mike astonished his parents no more than himself by obeying an
unaccountable impulse to kiss his mother. "I wisht I'd never made you
cry, ma," he growled, and plunged into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Thomas Hollin.</p>

<p>The mother wiped the tears out of her eyes; but she called after Mike,
in her natural high key: "Say, Mike, little Terry came round with Clara,
and he was so worked up he jest wouldn't go home; said he would stay and
sleep with Uncle Mike. I let him, 'cause I knew you wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"No; I'm glad," answered Mike, his voice deeper than usual.</p>

<p>Terry was the crippled seven-year-old boy of his sister Clara, who had
married the grocer at the corner; and of all the four grandchildren he
was the one that Mike petted most. Mrs. Hollin, unknown to any mortal,
had her appalling seasons of vision with regard to Mike. His father was
mistaken when he judged her to be blind; she knew more about Mike's vices
than did he. But in her worst discouragement she would be comforted if
she saw Mike with Terry. "He's got a good heart, that boy, or he never
could love a child so &mdash; Lord, do save him yet!" Then Annie Hollin
used to pray &mdash; for she did pray, and fervently, although only on
great occasions. "I ain't one to be bothering the Lord every time my
bread don't rise," said Annie. "No, I help myself long's I can; and when
I can't, I ask help. It's the way I'd be done by, and it's the way I
do!"</p>

<p>The day must have been a hard one for her in spite of her bravado,
since, after Tom slept, she stole to the window and kneeled there a long
time, sobbing and praying. She might have judged her prayers answered
could she have looked into Mike's room, and seen Mike's face pressed
against the curly yellow head, with that better and softer look that
Terry often saw. But surely she would have known a new foreboding had she
tarried until the child roused himself to murmur sleepily, "Give Uncle
Mike a kiss and a hug and a pat" &mdash; all his little store of sweets
&mdash; "'cause the cops didn't kill you!" and heard Mike say huskily,
"You won't quit liking Uncle Mike, whatever they say, will you, little
Terry?"</p>

<p>The following morning (the day of the week was Wednesday) Mike applied
at the shops for work. Before he started he filled the kitchen wood-box.
Every morning he filled it. He pumped water unasked. The next pay-day he
bought his mother probably the gaudiest and ugliest photograph frame to
be gotten in the town for money. He put a photograph of Terry in it.</p>

<p>"Oh, dearie me," sighed Annie Hollin, "that boy must 'a' got something
on his mind; he ain't natural at all."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope he'll stay unnatural, then," said her husband, easily.
"He ain't worked so well or kept so steady since I've knowed him."</p>

<p>Mike, in fact, was working hard. The instructions given him were to be
industrious and seem content. To work was a relief in the ferment of his
mind, to seem content was a different matter. Possessed still by a somber
enthusiasm, he took no pleasure in the "chaff" of his mates in the shop,
or in beer and dirty packs of cards, out of hours. He took to spending
his evenings home. He was civil to his father and to young Tom. "I'd like
'em to have something kind o' pleasanter 'bout me to remember than jest
always having to keep the coffee on the back of the stove for me,"
thought Mike.</p>

<p>Old Tom viewed his son's changed ways with a mixture of bewilderment
and secret thankfulness; it was too soon to approve; but he ceased to
sneer or grumble, preserving a decent silence, filled with tobacco-smoke.
Young Tom was openly encouraged. "Mike's been brought up standing by
Patsy O'Connor's death, that's what it is," said Tom. "He's trying to
think it out; and one good thing, he's broken with the Nicker gang. Say,
Elly, we must ask Mike to the house, sometimes, and lend him books. And I
don't believe it'll break me to hire a two-horse carriage next Sunday,
and all of us go riding, pa and ma, and you 'n' me and Arthur, and
Mike."</p>

<p>Even Clara's husband, hitherto the gloomiest of Mike's critics, had
felt the contagion of the family hopefulness, and displayed his good will
in a package of Durham tobacco and an invitation to a revival meeting,
enlivened by stereopticon views of the Holy Land. Mike thanked him,
smoked the tobacco, and went to see the pictures. What would the staid
deacons in the pew behind him have thought, could they have looked into
his brain and seen the pictures there! Steadily, these feignings of his
fancy grew more terrible, more absorbing. He got no comfort from his
comrades. Nicker made jokes about murder when in good humor, or ferocious
threats when angry. The older comrades were shy of the subject. "They're
scared, the cowards!" thought Mike. The younger comrades had a callous
cheerfulness that exasperated him. He couldn't help thinking that they
would be less cheerful were their own necks in danger, instead of his.
When was it that a new suspicion joined the tumult of his thoughts? They
changed; insidiously, imperceptibly a doubt, not of the righteousness of
the cause, not of the justice of punishing the oppressors, but a doubt of
the exact measure of guilt of this special oppressor, Arthur Thorne,
unarmed his purpose. Whether it was that seeing Thorne daily,
discovering, as a good workman is never slow to discover, that he
"understood the business down to the ground," and, discovering, too, that
he was quick to commend, Mike had felt the personal charm that made his
brother the young fellow's devoted adherent; whether it was that the talk
of the shop, which had now veered over to Thorne's side, as to a "man
with sand that would stick to them that stuck to him," unconsciously
affected him; whether he was influenced by the example of the principal
Knights of Labor among the workmen, men not the least like Nicker, either
in habit or principle, and giving a modified support to Thorne as
apparently "meaning well"; in fine, whether any or all of these causes
moved him to compassion for Thorne as a man too rashly doomed, moved he
was, and deeply. He tried to brace up his nerves by a visit to Patsy's
mother, whom he had not seen for a week, not since he helped carry
Patsy's coffin to his grave.</p>

<p>She met his sympathy with a strange answer. "Is it Mr. Thorne you'd be
imputin' it to, Mike Hollin?" she cried. "He had nothing to do with it at
all, except the goodness of him paying for the fine carriages at the
funeral. He did that, God bless him! I know well the man that's my poor
boy's murderer, and ye mind it, Michael Hollin!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mike, vaguely, "was it Officer Reilly?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not, Michael Hollin. Who hit him I know not, nor do I want
to know. They was all in a heap, and ivery man a-striking for his own
head &mdash; I might be blaming unjustly an I did know, so I pray God to
keep it from me! No; the wan Almighty God blames for that day, an' the
blood on it, ain't the craturs that was hitting, maybe by mistake; it's
the man that druv them poor boys wild an' bad with his wicked lies."</p>

<p>"And him, Mrs. O'Connor?"</p>

<p>"Ye know well that it's Bill Nicker I mean, Michael Hollin."</p>

<p>Of course she was raving in her grief, but he could not tell her so;
and her words recurred to him uncomfortably all the way down-town.</p>

<p>It was a half-holiday at the works, owing to some repairs, and Mike
had the afternoon to himself. He thought that he would go to Terry's
school in time to walk home with Terry. There was a reason for the heavy
sickness of heart that made him crave the little fellow's companionship;
time had not stood still for his struggles, and to-morrow was the night.
Sunk in darker and darker meditation, he walked down the shady street
toward the great brick building that is the Eighth District school. And
so mutinous was the cast of his thoughts, that he gave a guilty start
when he observed, a little in advance, Nicker himself walking with the
gigantic blacksmith. Of late the blacksmith, who was a member of the
society, had been restive under discipline, grumbling about Thorne's
sentence; and indeed, Mike had noticed that while the hatred of Thorne
had steadily grown more virulent and reckless in the men outside, &mdash;
those who like Nicker were refused any place in the shops, &mdash; the
men at work were becoming listless and uneasy. "Some of 'em would like to
back out," said Mike, scowling. "After to-morrow, it will be too late to
back out." He quickened his pace a little, &mdash; as one will when Black
Care strikes the spursin, &mdash; and he was only the breadth of the
street, obliquely, from the school-house, near enough to see the heads,
white and yellow and brown, filing behind the windows, in the formal
march to the doors; he could distinguish Terry's yellow curls, see the
doors swing apart, the lower-room children pouring out into the street;
when, quite without warning, all the people on the sidewalk began to run
with loud screams. The horrid cry arose: "Mad dog! mad dog!" Mike turned
whence the noise mostly came, to behold an ugly sight. Down the side
street, headed directly toward the crowd of children, ran the animal, one
of those white, bow-legged, wrinkle-jawed, vicious-eyed bull-dogs, to
which in their best estate one instinctively gives the larger half of the
walk, at this moment a creature out of a nightmare, with his ghastly
mouth and the blind, crouching fury of his gait; and behind him raced
fast and faster the single pursuer, a young man on a bicycle. He could
see the children; in his set face and straining muscles was as fierce an
eagerness as that hurling the brute. This picture flashed into Mike's
consciousness before he wrenched a loose brick from the pavement and ran
straight into the dog's path. He passed Nicker and the blacksmith, who
had leaped a fence, and were hunting for weapons on the safe side. One
chance in a thousand that he might hit the dog before he should reach the
children! If not &mdash; Mike straightened himself and shut his teeth
hard; the brick was poised in his right hand, he opened his pocket-knife
with his teeth and his left hand. They were coming! A woman screamed as
the rider gained. He was level with the beast, he swung his body over;
nobody quite saw how it was done, but the dog was snatched up and held
out at arm's-length by the collar, while the wheels whirled on.</p>

<p>"Hold him!" screamed Mike. "Hold him! I kin hit him!" The man on the
wheels did hold the dog, held him far out, struggling savagely, a
horrible mark. Mike threw his brick so truly, that the writhing, foaming
mass collapsed into a string of limp legs and a bloody head, which the
rider flung on the ground, just before he sprang down himself.</p>

<p>They saw a quick movement of one arm; there was a flash and a loud
report.</p>

<p>Arthur Thorne replaced his revolver. "Thank you," said he, with a nod
at Mike; "I really don't think he needed that last shot, but it was
better to make safe. You throw well, Hollin."</p>

<p>Mike had drawn near enough to be one of the crowd staring at the gory
lump; a second earlier there were only Thorne the dog, and he, but now at
least twenty men bustled up valorously with improvised weapons, and one
adventurous matron swung a tea-kettle. The blacksmith had wrenched off a
pump-handle. Among them no one would have singled out Mike standing with
shoulders relaxed, hands in his pockets, and mouth agape, for an actor in
the scene. His head swam. A dizzy admiration for Thorne's feat mingled
with something that suffocated him, as he saw Terry limping</p>

<p>through the crowd, and heard the familiar little voice calling:</p>

<p>"Please let me get to my Uncle Mike. Did you kill him, Uncle Mike? Let
me look. He can't bite nobody now, can he?"</p>

<p>Mike lifted the child up in his arms, and hid his face against Terry's
jacket.</p>

<p>"You're a brave boy," cried the woman, sobbing.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," said Mike bruskly; "there was all the children. Anyhow,
Mr. Thorne done it. I must take this boy home." So he got away, got Terry
home, almost staggered home himself.</p>

<p>His father smoked his pipe on the piazza steps; indoors his mother was
setting the table, both waiting for Mike, with excited faces, for a
neighbor had told them the story. Mrs. Hollin ran out and fell on Mike's
neck. "But 'twasn't me killed the dog, ma," said Mike, who, indeed, was
too harried by conflicting emotions to realize the splendor of his own
conduct.</p>

<p>"Yes 'twas, too," sobbed Mrs. Hollin; "you hit him with the
brickbat."</p>

<p>"But I never could have got nigh enough in time to slug him," Mike
cried very earnestly. "Mr. Thorne he caught him up like lightning &mdash;
tell ye, ma, 'twas somethin' to see!"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, he was brave, too," admitted Mrs. Hollin.</p>

<p>"I say ye both done well," pronounced the father, "and I am going out
this minute to git some beer to drink Mike's health."</p>

<p>Mike could hardly remember the time when his father had praised him
before; and yet so confused and troubled was his mind, that he was only
aware of a new kind of pang. Nevertheless, being occupied with the
catastrophe and their own vivid emotions, none of the family except his
mother noticed anything odd in his demeanor. Clara came before supper was
ended, to relate the story with tears; and Clara's husband choked when he
thanked Mike. "I know little Terry never could have got out of the way,"
said he. Tom came, too, with his wife, who, having been a school-teacher
and wearing a gold watch, was considered to hold herself rather above the
family; and Elly actually kissed Mike, calling him, "You splendid
fellow!" while Tom held him out by both elbows, crying, "Let's look at
the young feller Mr. Thorne says is the bravest man he knows."</p>

<p>"Oh, you get out!" stammered the wretched Mike, feeling ready to cry.
"And Bill Nicker," says Tom, gleefully, &mdash; "bless you, Bill was
there, but he wasn't there long; he got over a fence like greased
lightning, and Johnny Mahin was with him; he got over, too, and pulled
the handle off the Lowders's pump, and Lowder was round swearing he'll
make him mend it! The joke is, it's cast-iron, and he broke it off short.
'A feller's strong's that oughtn't to be afraid of a pup,' says Lowder.
Bill Nicker got Mrs. Lowder's carving-knife, and was round mighty brave
after the dog was dead."</p>

<p>"Is he gone to work yet?" asked old Tom, who was puffing very
comfortably on the step.</p>

<p>"No; says he's waiting for the new factory to start up over the river.
Says he'll get higher wages there."</p>

<p>"Bill Nicker," said old Tom, meditatively, "he tries every way on
earth to get higher wages, 'cept doing better work."</p>

<p>To all this and more Mike listened. He said nothing. He felt no desire
to defend Nicker. His moral world was in ruins. Nicker had shown the
white feather, and Thorne had saved Terry.</p>

<p>But only his mother watched him anxiously, sitting mute and dismal
amid the chatter; only his mother stole to his door during the night and
heard his sobs. In the morning she made a pretext of some pie for his
dinner to get him off to her little pantry. "You walk on, Tom," said she;
"he'll ketch up!"</p>

<p>"All right," called old Tom, cheerfully, &mdash; he was in high good
humor with Mike, the world, and himself, &mdash; "give the lad a good
dinner, he deserves it."</p>

<p>She folded a napkin neatly about the "turnover," and placed it in his
pail. Her hands trembled. He could see her out of the corners of his
eyes; he felt both those trembling hands laid on his shoulders; and he
wriggled, blinking his swollen eyelids in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Micky," said his mother, "you don't need to wink, I know you been
crying. You been wretched 's could be going on two weeks." He looked at
her with a quivering mouth that wouldn't smile for all his efforts.
"Don't you mind, Micky, when you was a boy, and you'd been bad or
anything had gone wrong, how you'd come round after a while and tell all
to mother? And then you'd feel all right! Micky dear, can't you tell it
all to mother now?" She was afraid that he would be angry, but he was not
angry.</p>

<p>"I wish I could, ma," he said, "but I can't."</p>

<p>"Micky, I know it's that society. Mrs. O'Connor told me she's sure
they're after some mischief. Two or three of the boys was at her house;
and you know boys: they can't no more help leaking out what's in their
minds than a dish-pan with a hole in it; and they was bragging to her how
Thorne would be sorry some day. Micky, don't go to feeling bad. Say, if I
tell the police on 'em, and have 'em took up, will anything come out to
hurt you?"</p>

<p>She was startled at his face, which turned a dark red, while he
gripped her arms so hard that it hurt her. "Mother," he groaned, "if you
do that, by &mdash; &mdash; I'll cut my throat!"</p>

<p>"Oh, then, I won't, Micky. Then I won't indeed, Micky. But, Micky, I'd
hate &mdash; I'd hate for any harm to come to Mr. Thorne, after Terry,
you know, and him godfather to Tom's boy."</p>

<p>"There'll no harm come to Mr. Thorne, mother; I promise you that." He
spoke very steadily, and, after a long look at her, he kissed her. It was
so unlike Mike, and she was so oppressed, so fluttered, that she had no
more strength to detain him. All she could do was miserably to watch him
running through the little garden, and to fall on her knees by the
flour-barrel. But in an instant she was on her feet. "I dunno as I need
to pray, after all," cried she. She intended no irreverence; she only
meant that her own resources were not yet exhausted; unless they were
exhausted, to her queer conscience prayer was unwarrantable beggary.
Rapidly she made herself ready for the street, and ran over to Mrs.
O'Connor's.</p>

<p>Mike was a hero at the shops that day. The men thought that he seemed
embarrassed by their praises; but that was natural, and to be commended
in a youngster. John, the blacksmith, himself the butt of many jocose
references to pump-handles, approached him at noon. Mike sat on the shady
side of the car-shed looking at the river. John said something
complimentary about the dog; then he kicked at the bits of slag on the
black ground. "Say, you ain't going on with it, are ye?" said he in an
undertone.</p>

<p>"No," said Mike.</p>

<p>"I won't let anybody hurt you. You can buy a revolver; I'll lend you
the money. And I'll go home with you every night."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Mike. The big man glanced half wistfully
at the insignificant bare arms folded on Mike's knee and at the freckled,
pale face; but he was a man of few words, so he merely said, "I guess
so," and went his ways.</p>

<p>"I'd need more'n him to stand them off me," thought Mike, who had lost
some of his belief in the Fehmgericht's infallibility, but not a whit of
confidence in its power. "I don't blame the boys, neither," he would have
answered, had there been any one to argue with him. "I'm a traitor. But I
can't help it."</p>

<p>When the whistle blew for closing, Mike slipped away, and went to a
toy-shop. There he bought some envelops and paper and a toy pistol. He
was very particular that the pistol should be a safe one, with a rubber
ball. Having made his purchases, he took the street-car to his sister
Clara's. Clara's mother-in-law, the only person at home, wondered a
little over his evident disappointment when he found her there alone: he
gave her the pistol for Terry. From Clara's house, instead of going home,
although it was now past six o'clock, he went down the hill to the river
bridge.</p>

<p>In sunny weather there are so many people loitering about the
approaches to the bridge, on the stone wall above the river bank, or on
the wharves of the bath-house and the boat-houses, that one more quiet
figure attracts no attention, even should it be that of a young
working-man who chooses to write his letters with a lead-pencil, and on
his knee. Who would divine anything tragical concerning a
round-shouldered young fellow that wrote with his tongue between his
teeth, or who would imagine, when, having written and sealed his letter
(the envelop [sic] was addressed to "A. V. Thorne, Esq."), he put both
hands into his pockets and stared at the opal water and the great gold
ball hung above it, that here was a bewildered and tormented soul, so
tormented, so bewildered as to see but one dark passage of escape? "I'll
post it, and he'll get it to-morrow," said Mike. "I had to give him a bit
of a caution, and I ain't told on anybody. I wisht I could get a word to
ma; but &mdash; she won't take it so hard, thinking it's accidental." All
his misspent life seemed drifting past him on the softly flaming, glowing
water: if he were to have the chance again, maybe he wouldn't be such a
fool. Terry's laugh sounded in the swash of the waters, his mother's
voice, his father's gruff tones, and Nicker's clear, rich intonations. He
heard Nicker speak quite distinctly, "If Thorne don't die, you will!" No;
there was no other way out, but &mdash; poor mother!</p>

<p>"For the land's sake, Micky, what are you looking at?" said his
mother. "I've been a-waving and a-waving to you, to get you to look
round."</p>

<p>She stood before him in the flesh, wearing her best bonnet, and her
black silk gown given her by Tom, sacred to high feasts, and smiling as
if well pleased. "And why ain't you walking home, Micky Hollin?" she
said, slipping her hand into his arm. "Do you know Elly's been and got a
grand supper for you, for a surprise, and all of us is coming, and Mr.
Thorne, too? It'll be great doings, and I've been hunting the town over
for you. You've got bare time to put on your Sunday coat; I got the
things all laid out on the bed."</p>

<p>"All right, ma," said Mike, forcing himself to smile. "I'll just run
down to the bath-house for a plunge to clean up, and ride up in the
street-car. You go on to Elly's."</p>

<p>"The tubs at home'll do you, Mike," she answered, holding tightly to
his arm. "Wait; I got a letter Mr. Nicker gave me to be sure to give you.
I guess it's about his going away, for I saw him getting on the
cars."</p>

<p>Now she released his arm. He read the note that she gave him, while
the sky, and the street, and the lighted water, and her face, all reeled
about him as about a man in an earthquake: "Friend Mike: All is
discovered. I'm off to look for work. For God's sake, do nothing in the
matter! Will write."</p>

<p>When Mike looked up, Mrs. Hollin was laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>"Mother," he cried, "what have you done?"</p>

<p>"I ain't done nothing, Micky dear. I ain't let on a word to the cops.
But I accidental like met Mr. Nicker to-day, and says I: 'Excuse me, Mr.
Nicker, was there a fire or a fight down your way, for I seen three
policemen there this morning?' says I &mdash; but I was lying, you know,
God forgive me! I wish you'd seen the man; he was hopping round like a
hen with its head cut off, trying all the while not to appear strange at
all. But he went off, and he hadn't got well round the corner before he
runs up on Mrs. O'Connor, who said very stiff (she ain't on no too good
terms with him), 'Mr. Nicker, there was a little boy handed me this,
begging me to hand it to you. I ain't easy in my conscience 'bout it, but
for old times' sake, here 'tis.' And you see, Micky, it was jest more
lies, a letter telling him the police was on to everything, and for him
to warn M. H &mdash; &mdash; ."</p>

<p>"Ma, you wrote it!" gasped Mike.</p>

<p>"Of course I wrote it, Micky. Do you expect poor Mrs. O'Connor, who
can hardly sign her name, to write a document like that? I wrote it. And
the man took it all for law and gospel, like I knew he would, and run
home quick for his gripsack. I had to laugh to see him rolling his eyes
round down at the depot, trying to look out of the back of his head if he
could see a policeman, he was so scairt. But, the Lord be praised, we're
rid of him, for good! So, Micky, I sha'n't ask no questions and you don't
need to tell me no lies; but don't never have no such awful things happen
to you that your mother has got to be a liar for you, or think of taking
baths in the river; and do try and be a good boy and please your
father."</p>

<p>"'Fore God I will, ma," said Mike, out of a full heart.</p>
