  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; FROSTY</h2>

  <p class="first">FROSTY was perfect. He had the hazel eyes of a fighter, eyes
  that became whirling pools of fire when a kill was at hand. He was heavily
  muscled where strength was needed, and yet there was not an extra ounce for
  him to carry when it meant traveling fast and far. One looked at him as one
  always looks at a fighter, seeing first shoulders, jaw, and eyes. And there
  was nothing that should be changed.</p>

  <p>Frosty was perfect, because he could kill anything that was able to catch
  him. He was perfect because he could keep himself warm in winter and cool in
  summer by natural alterations. He was perfect because he knew how to feed
  himself. He was perfect because he was in the first young prime of his life,
  and the world had not yet scarred and hurt him; neither had this universe
  ceased being a great mystery to him.</p>

  <p>Frosty was a timber wolf, or buffalo wolf, or lobo, or any one of a dozen
  other terms. But he was dignified with a name that had appeared in the public
  print more than once. That was because he had discovered, when he was still a
  gaunt, leggy yearling, that veal is easy to kill and delicious to the taste.
  He began killing young cattle when he was scarcely a year old, and then he
  kept on killing them.</p>

  <p>Frosty was not confined to one diet, as a matter of fact. He knew only one
  thing&mdash;that the majority of meats produced by man's care are tenderer
  than the meats produced by a wild life. Therefore Frosty spent a great deal
  of his time within sight and sound and scent of man.</p>

  <p>If it happened that the tender-throat calves were too well protected
  inside the herd, Frosty knew all about the ways of approaching chicken
  houses. He could rear from the floor and take a rooster off its perch without
  giving the poor fowl a chance to flap its wings once before it was dead. He
  knew how to get into a barn and hunt out the chickens there. Once he had
  actually got up on the haymow and picked off some pigeons on their nests
  among the upper rafters.</p>

  <p>But there were other things to be found within sight and sound of man.
  There were rabbits&mdash;not the long, stringy jacks such as he was
  accustomed to snap up on the desert or in the mountains by dint of work of
  the brain, never by speed of foot&mdash;but fat, thick-fleshed rabbits even
  one of which made quite a meal! There were tiny little items such as caged
  squirrels, whose wire cages could be bashed open by the stroke of a heavy
  forepaw. And near the house of man one could find goats staked out on a
  convenient rope&mdash;if it were in a town&mdash;and stupid yearling calves
  standing in corrals.</p>

  <p>He knew where at least half a dozen farmers' wives had their creameries in
  which broad pans of milk were standing, and where eggs accumulated in deep
  dishes. He knew how to clip the end off an egg and swallow the contents
  without the shell as expertly as any fox with delicate muzzle. He knew how to
  nose or paw open a door and lap up the milk in the pans. He knew how to visit
  coolers of a summer night, coolers of burlap with water dripping over them
  from pans at the top. Cold meats, butter, and various delicacies were
  contained in those coolers&mdash;and sometimes summer may be a hungry
  season.</p>

  <p>Frosty knew the taste of fresh pork, and he loved it. Pigs were easy to
  kill. It was a question of running very low and catching the porker with the
  shoulder so that the fat beast fell on its back. Then one knife slash of the
  long fangs and the throat was open and the life was streaming out.</p>

  <p>It was just a neat little trick, because pigs were not easy to kill for
  some predatory animals. Their weight was too close to the ground, and their
  teeth were too sharp, their jaws too powerful. But it was true that most
  affairs in this life could be made smooth by the use of tricks.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of sheer brawn in Frosty. He was the biggest timber wolf
  that had ever terrorized the cattlemen of the Blue Water Mountains. He had,
  in fact, a spread of foot that was so huge that those who were not initiated
  could hardly believe that it was the tread of a wolf at all. A
  hundred-and-ten-pound wolf is a big fellow; but Frosty weighed a hundred and
  fifty&mdash;not hog-fat, but in the height of good running condition. But for
  all of his bulk, he knew that brains are better than toothwork.</p>

  <p>He had had a wise mother to teach him things in the beginning. And he had
  a mind that was able to improve on what he learned from others. He knew that
  squirrels bury nuts, because he had seen them dig up part of the treasure.
  And a wolf may enjoy nuts in a hungry hour. He knew most expertly that
  rabbits may be worn out to a frazzle without much effort on the part of the
  hunter, because a startled rabbit will run a mile like a winging arrow,
  gradually turning as it runs, unless pressed too hard. A wise wolf stays in
  the center of the circle and keeps starting the jack until it is
  exhausted.</p>

  <p>Once from a distance he had watched an old Southern hound kill a wild cat
  after walking around and around it until the nervous cat was brain tired and
  nervously limp. He had tried the same method with perfect success.</p>

  <p>He had seen a pack of four wolves pull down a bull after hamstringing it.
  Well, what the pack could do, one wolf might manage. No bull on the range can
  turn fast enough to keep away an active wolf, and, once behind the big
  fellow, it is not hard to cut the huge tendon that runs down the back of the
  leg. One hamstring gone and the other will soon follow. Then the bull must
  fall, and the wolf may dine.</p>

  <p>He knew a great many other things.</p>

  <p>There was man, for instance.</p>

  <p>Man is the great enemy that must not be faced. One may treat a mountain
  lion, or even the terrible, sage grizzly bear, almost with contempt&mdash;if
  one has four fast feet and good terrain to use them over. But man is
  different. He is accompanied by the scent of iron and powder, always. He
  makes a noise from a distance and hurls through the air an invisible tooth
  that Frosty had seen bite a huge elk to death at a single stroke. Frosty had
  seen a monstrous grizzly bear smitten to the ground, not by a single noise,
  but by several. He had seen the hair of the bear fly where one of the
  invisible teeth grazed its back.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Frosty had had those same teeth go by him in the air. Once he
  had heard the hum of one in the air and heard the sound of the tooth going
  through a sapling close to him. Afterward he came back and sniffed the hole
  through the tree. It was clean cut. It bored straight through. Not the
  greatest bear that ever lived could bite like that; not the great god of
  bears could do such damage!</p>

  <p>Man, also has many devices. He puts on the ground raw meat, fresh and
  delicious, but with a peculiar scent adhering. Wolves that eat this meat die.
  Frosty's own mother had died in this manner. Man also puts, here and there
  through the brush, entrancing scents, and if a wolf comes close to them, a
  steel mouth bites upward from the ground and then closes on the wolf's
  leg.</p>

  <p>Frosty had been fighting with a big, mature he-wolf one day, and the steel
  teeth had struck upward from the ground and caught his enemy.</p>

  <p>Afterward Frosty learned never to trust strange scents.</p>

  <p>The very truth is that Frosty loved to learn almost as much as he loved to
  eat.</p>

  <p>But his appetite was also very good, and he liked frequent meals. Your
  average wolf will gorge at a kill. But Frosty learned better after he had
  been twice hunted by Major Tweedale's pack of wolfhounds. Major Herbert
  Tweedale had the best pack of hounds in the Blue Water Mountains, and it was
  his boast that they never failed to get their prey.</p>

  <p>He had made that boast before he encountered Frosty. The major learned
  something then; the hound pack&mdash;except for two which Frosty
  killed&mdash;learned something, also; and Frosty learned most of all. He
  learned that a filled belly may bring an early death.</p>

  <p>Frosty dined temperately, but always on the choicest morsels. Or perhaps
  he learned to appreciate a lean figure, because he was never so starved that
  he was tempted to swell himself with food. Famine never came anywhere near
  Frosty. He liked warm food. He liked it fresh. He never returned to a dead
  carcass.</p>

  <p>And that was why the ranchers had placed upon his famous head a bounty of
  no less than two thousand dollars!</p>

  <p>Yes, more than the bounty on the head of many a murderer! But who can
  blame them when it is remembered that Frosty, day after day, all through the
  year, descended from the heights above timber line, killed fresh beef, ate
  sparingly thereof, and retired again?</p>

  <p>Guns could not harm him now, because he had learned that guns do not bite
  at night any more than birds sing.</p>

  <p>Poison could not harm him, because he would not eat cold meat.</p>

  <p>Traps could not catch him, because the scent of steel seemed to rise
  before him out of the ground like a red danger signal.</p>

  <p>For all of that, Frosty was to be caught in a trap on this winter day when
  the wind was blowing white streamers of snow powder off the tops of the Blue
  Waters. He was to be caught by the cleverest trapper that ever worked in that
  district. And yet, strangely enough, though Bill Gary was particularly
  hunting Frosty for the great bounty, it was only by accident and second
  chance that the famous wolf was snared.</p>

  <p>Because of that accident, Bill Gary died without ever collecting the
  bounty he wanted, and Jim Silver rode into the strangest of all his
  adventures.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; BILL GARY'S DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL GARY did nothing but trap wolves. He cared little about
  other pelts, even the precious fur bearers. What he knew about was wolves,
  and what he wanted was wolves and nothing else.</p>

  <p>He looked as though he had been born to his work, because he greatly
  resembled a wolf in his own person. He had a great, shaggy head and heavy
  shoulders. He had a slouching gait, a bright and dangerous eye, and the
  manners of an eater of raw meat.</p>

  <p>There was nothing good to be said about Bill Gary, except that he knew how
  to catch wolves. Otherwise he was a huge, snarling, sullen, dangerous boor.
  He never went down to a town except to collect his bounties, lay in a supply
  of bacon, flour, a few other necessaries, and perhaps a new trap or two. He
  never stayed in a town longer than one whisky drunk and a few fights.</p>

  <p>After some of those fights the oher fellow was crippled for life. Bill
  Gary fought foul, because that was his nature. He never saw any point in
  giving the other fellow a chance, any more than Frosty would have dreamed of
  giving a tender young beef a chance for its life when he was hungry. Bill
  Gary fought because he loved to give pain, just as Frosty fought because he
  wanted fresh meat.</p>

  <p>Bill Gary had traveled a thousand miles to come to the range of Frosty.
  The fame of the great wolf had traveled far and wide during the last year,
  but when it came to the ears of Bill Gary that such a small fortune could be
  collected for the scalp of a single wolf, when he heard moreover that this
  wolf could be known by the mere spread of its foot, and that it had its name
  from its pale-gray, misty color, he could hardly wait to pack his traps on a
  mule and start south. So he got to the Blue Waters, heard as much as he
  needed to know about the range of the monster, and went out to catch him.</p>

  <p>Bill Gary arrived in October. This was March&mdash;a white, cold, windy
  March in the upper mountains&mdash;and still Gary had not so much as laid an
  eye on the great wolf. He had caught several others, but he had not so much
  as glimpsed the cattle eater.</p>

  <p>Nearly any other man would have given up the task long before and
  attributed his lack of success to the work of the devil. But Bill Gary was as
  stubborn as steel, and therefore he remained at his work.</p>

  <p>On this day, with a burden of No. 4½ Newhouse traps&mdash;the only traps
  ever specially designed for the catching of timber wolves&mdash;Bill Gary
  trudged through the Blue Waters above the timber line.</p>

  <p>He bore with him, also, a strong ax, with a head wide and heavy enough to
  serve for the driving of stakes, and he had with him a big chunk of fresh
  venison to serve as bait.</p>

  <p>So weighted down, it was a hard pull for Bill Gary up the snowy slopes,
  but he minded no labor when he was working at his favorite occupation. He
  came now to the crest of a ridge where the wind had scoured the snow away;
  there, on a rock ledge, he sat down to rest himself while his eye ran over
  the picture of the great, gaunt mountains, blue-white against the gray of the
  sky. Below extended the forest of pines, dark as night, and the plains and
  foothills beyond were lost in the winter mist. Out of a canyon near by he
  heard the calling voices of a torrent so strong that even the winter had been
  unable to silence it.</p>

  <p>None of these things had an important meaning to Bill Gary. He simply
  wished that the spring would hurry along, because spring is the best season,
  as every one knows, for the trapping of wolves. Now, when the ache had
  disappeared from behind his knees, he stood up and stretched himself. He saw
  a knob of rock jutting from the ledge, and he struck it an idle blow with the
  back of his ax, breaking it off short. Then he strode on.</p>

  <p>But after he had gone a step or two, he began to think of something that
  his eyes had seen, but which had had no meaning to his mind at the
  moment.</p>

  <p>He turned, went back, and at this instant the cloud opened, and a flare of
  sunshine fell right on the ledge of rock.</p>

  <p>There was little superstition in Bill Gary, but it seemed to him that a
  bright, glorious hand had reached down from the sky to point to and gild his
  good fortune.</p>

  <p>For there was no doubt of the thing that glittered from the broken face of
  the ledge. It was a dark stone on the outside, but within the skin of
  weathering it was gray with a crystal glittering. There was another
  brightness that matched and overmatched the sun that fell on it&mdash;a
  veining of yellow, of shining yellow!</p>

  <p>Bill Gary looked suddenly and wildly around him. If there had been another
  man in sight, it would have gone ill with the stranger. But there was no one
  near. Who would enter this white wilderness at this season of the year?</p>

  <p>Suddenly it seemed to Gary that this was his reward from whatever
  mysterious powers may be. It was his repayment for the long years of service
  which he had spent in wiping from the face of the earth as many as possible
  of the four-footed meat eaters. Here was the exchange which fate gave
  him&mdash;gold!</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was only a point, a spot?</p>

  <p>He took ten steps down the ledge and struck with the back of the ax again.
  A weighty fragment broke away&mdash;and again the glorious yellow glittered
  up at him!</p>

  <p>He suddenly saw himself in a great, roaring city, and the great city was
  his. The roar of it was as the voice of his power. He saw an army of faces,
  and they belonged to him. He would be rich. He would be as rich as Midas!</p>

  <p>He began to laugh, for he was thinking of his nephew, that poor,
  hard-working cow-puncher, Alec Gary, who drudged from year to year trying to
  save enough money to marry the girl of his choice. Well, what would Alec
  think when his savage uncle descended from the mountains with both hands
  filled with gold?</p>

  <p>After laughing at Alec, after taunting him, Bill Gary decided that he
  might even give a little charity to his nephew, because, after all, Alec was
  not a bad sort of a lad. He kept his mouth shut, he never criticized, and he
  knew how to work. And, after all, his name was Gary. Bill Gary, the black
  sheep, might now become the head of the family, the man to whom the whole
  tribe looked up for advice, and for help. Well, some of the advice that he
  had in mind to give them would work under the skin and sting them to the
  bone, if he knew his own mind!</p>

  <p>He took out a pencil and a notebook. He was a methodical fellow, and he
  was old enough as a hunter to understand that one may forget one's place in
  the wilderness. So he wrote down a description in the notebook, after he had
  unwrapped it from the piece of oiled silk which protected it from
  moisture.</p>

  <p>Thunder Mountain on the right; Chimney Peak on the left. I face Mount
  Wigwam. A ledge of black rock outcropping.</p>

  <p>That was enough for him. He could always locate the place from that
  description.</p>

  <p>But how deep did the vein run? Was it only a surface skimming, or did it
  go down deep?</p>

  <p>Well, he had a double jack and a drill down in his cabin, and the shack
  was only a mile away. He would soon make out the truth&mdash;at least he
  would cut a little deeper into it.</p>

  <p>So he put down the load of fresh meat and traps and the ax. It would be a
  joke on him, he thought, if a wolf happened by and ate that bait before a
  trap was set! Then he strode off down the slope toward the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Cabin" was too much of a name for it. Some unknown man had built it,
  perhaps the year before. It was a crazy little shack that leaned against a
  rock, but it had the advantage of running water near by, and, of course,
  plenty of wood for fuel. It was good enough for Bill Gary, who used to be
  fond of saying that his own hide was tent enough to shelter him from
  winter.</p>

  <p>As he came through the trees his two dogs jumped up. They had been lying
  on either side of the entrance to the shack, and now they sprang up and
  stared at him with their wistful, red-stained eyes. Neither of them made a
  sound. They had been trained to hunt silently, fight silently, die silently,
  if need be.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they had no desire to give tongue when they saw their master, for
  they had no love for him. To him they were simply tools. To them he was
  simply a resistless and cruel force which must be obeyed. Of their own kind,
  they were magnificent. He had bred them for his own purposes in hunting
  wolves. He had bred them big, on a basis of greyhound and Scottish deerhound
  for speed and general conformation. He had dashed in some mastiff to give
  ferocity, and some St. Bernard and Great Dane for size. For fifteen years he
  had been creating these monsters, and now he had a pair, either one of which
  was capable of giving a wolf a hard tussle single-handed.</p>

  <p>Shock weighed a hundred and eighty pounds. Tiger was a good deal bigger.
  When he stood up on his hind legs his head was almost a foot above that of
  his master. They were as ugly as nightmares, but they had the qualities for
  which the master had bred them&mdash;wind, speed, and a tenacious love of
  battle at all times.</p>

  <p>They had Red Cross collars around their necks. Big Bill Gary grinned as he
  considered that name for them. He had bought them because they were made of
  rustless, hinged plates of steel, so broad that they would be
  useful&mdash;and had indeed proved useful&mdash;in parrying the slash of a
  wolf when it cuts for the throat. But originally they had been Red Cross
  collars for use on big trained dogs that could go among the wounded, perhaps,
  and carry first-aid kits. Each collar had, also, a little flat compartment
  under one of the steel plates. It closed with a strong snap, and was almost
  air-tight. That was for messages that the injured could write when they used
  the dog to send out a call for help. That was why Bill Gary
  grinned&mdash;when he thought that those collars had been made for purposes
  of mercy, and he had put them on his killers.</p>

  <p>He had a pair of pack harnesses for the dogs, too. He put one of them on
  Shock and loaded the heavy double jack onto it. He put a pair of drills and
  some fuse and blasting powder on Tiger. He decided that he ought to saddle
  the dogs more often and take them out to carry burdens. It hardened them. It
  made them a little slower, but it hardened them for the struggle of a
  fight.</p>

  <p>Now he was prepared to go back to that ledge above him and tackle the
  problem of what it contained. So he strode away again, with the two great
  dogs following him. They went actively up the steepness of the slope, arching
  their backs high, sticking out their long tongues as they panted. One shifty
  red eye was always fixed upon him. He saw that and liked it. He always liked
  it. He would rather have either beast or man fear than love him.</p>

  <p>When he got up to the ridge, he scowled back at the line of tracks which
  extended behind him. He was a fool to have come so straight. He should have
  wandered off to the side and buried his sign as he went. However, the sky was
  turning gray, and snowflakes were falling.</p>

  <p>He forgot the trail and went to his work. In his powerful hand the heavy,
  twelve-pound double jack plied as easily as a single jack in the grasp of an
  ordinary man. It drove the bit chunking rapidly into the rock. He drilled a
  hole not too deep, slanting it up under a big and massive projection of the
  ledge. Then he put in a shot of powder, buried the fuse, and lighted it. From
  the near distance he waited, sitting down cross-legged, and heard the hollow
  boom of the report. He thought at first that the explosion had simply
  "bootlegged." Now he returned to find that it had in reality neatly cracked
  off the outthrust of the rock. A two-hundred-pound mass lay on the ground,
  and right across the heart of it lay the precious golden streakings.</p>

  <p>He looked up sharply, savage as a beast from a meal of raw meat. The wind,
  in a strong gust, blew a flurry of snow into his face. He was glad of the
  cold beat of the wind. He was glad to take the force of the blast, because it
  assured him that no other men were likely to be near.</p>

  <p>He thought of covering up the ledge. But no, there was no use of that. A
  falling of trees to cover the places where he had broken the stone would
  simply call the attention of any traveler. And if he heaped snow over the
  exposure, the wind would scour it away.</p>

  <p>Well, other men could thank their lucky stars that they did not come to
  bother him just now!</p>

  <p>He licked his chapped lips as he stared at the veining of the gold. It was
  all his. He felt the running of the gold in the vein as he felt the running
  of the blood in his body. He felt able to chew the gold out of the rock.</p>

  <p>Then, as he looked about him, he took note of the venison which still had
  not been used.</p>

  <p>He had found a gold mine, to be sure, but that did not by any means
  eradicate his sense of the months which he had spent in the pursuit of the
  great Frosty. It merely freed his hands to devote his full artistry to the
  task of catching the famous wolf. He determined, before he started on the
  long trek to town to file on his claim, that he would first of all take a
  last chance to catch Frosty.</p>

  <p>So he turned his back on the ledge and went on up the slope.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; TRAGEDY PLANNED</h2>

  <p class="first">NO man's common sense continues when he has to deal with the
  thing he loves. If Bill Gary had consulted his common sense, he would have
  gone straightway to file his claim, but instead of using his matter-of-fact
  brain, he remembered that he loved wolf trapping. That was what caused
  trouble for Frosty. That was why the great Barry Christian was hurled into
  danger, and why Jim Silver rode strange trails for a long time. Also, that
  was how Bill Gary came to die.</p>

  <p>He left his dogs well behind him when he found what he wanted, which was
  an open place in the woods, higher up the slope. There was even a little
  knoll in the middle of the opening, which made the thing perfect, and the
  snow was not lying on the ground; there was only a sheathing of dead, brown
  pine needles.</p>

  <p>The big, fresh, crimson chunk of venison he hung eight feet from the
  ground on the branch of a tree at the edge of the clearing.</p>

  <p>He did not put the trap on the ground under the tree, because a careful
  timber wolf that knows anything about the arts of the trapper is fairly sure
  to suspect just such a device. And a wolf which will make a hundred-yard
  detour around a blaze on a tree has such hair-trigger sensitiveness of nose
  and eye that it is fairly sure to find the human hand wherever it has
  appeared, once it is roused to the search.</p>

  <p>Gary cut three six-foot stakes, each with a strong crotch at one end. He
  took three Newhouse traps. Each had a long chain attached to it, and at the
  end of each chain there was a ring. He passed the rings over the ends of the
  stakes and drove them into the ground on or near the little knoll in the
  center of the clearing. In the end, each chain was securely anchored in this
  fashion, and the stake was driven down until the head of it as well as the
  crotch was out of sight.</p>

  <p>The three traps were then placed on the knoll and covered over with fresh
  pine needles. Those needles were not taken from the spot. They were brought
  from a distance, and they were handled with pieces of bark, so that the scent
  which exudes from the hands of a man might taint the air as little as
  possible. All to the eye and to the scent must be as undisturbed as possible
  in appearance.</p>

  <p>When he had finished setting the traps, Bill Gary moved off to a distance,
  called his dogs, and strode off up the mountainside to visit a similar set of
  traps which he had arranged two days before. He was well out of sight before
  the tragedy which he had planned actually began.</p>

  <p>A big lop-eared wolf running across the mountain suddenly dropped to his
  haunches and pointed his nose into the wind. For down that wind came the
  eloquent tale of red meat. Lop-ear was a good hunter, an expert hunter. But
  he was not in a class with the great Frosty. Therefore his belly, at certain
  seasons, cleaved close to his backbone, and this was one of the seasons.
  Hunting had been bad. It had been terribly bad, and the call of the red meat
  was frightfully strong in him.</p>

  <p>So he went up the wind to find the treasure. He did not run in a straight
  line, but shifting here and there, his nose high and then low. For there were
  some odd features about the scent of that meat. The odor was fresh as that of
  a yearling deer, and yet the odor was not hot. At any rate, the delicious
  scent was not retreating. He took his time about the stalking, therefore, and
  it was some minutes later before he ventured to thrust his nose out from the
  edge of the clearing.</p>

  <p>He dropped to his belly at once, his hair bristling with fear. For man had
  been there. There was unmistakable evidence in the heavy air close to the
  ground, that man had been there not very long before. But, for that matter,
  man was everywhere in the woods, and in a great many portions of the white
  district above the timber line, even. Here, where he was close to the upper
  verge of the trees, the wolf was not so accustomed to meeting the dreadful
  scent. That was why he remained still for a long time before he ventured
  forward.</p>

  <p>He could not only smell the prize, but he could see it, now. It hung red
  as a jewel in the branch of a tree.</p>

  <p>Could he reach it? It seemed just on the verge of his jumping powers! He
  retreated, took a strong run, and then checked himself shortly on skidded
  legs that trembled with fear. For he had remembered that the ground he was to
  land on might not be secure. Therefore he checked himself and began to sniff
  carefully. His eyes became dim as the intensity of his search increased. What
  good are eyes for near hunting, compared to the powerful concentration of a
  wolf's power of smell?</p>

  <p>He found the ground clear. It was not clean, to be sure, for the horrible
  smell of man was on it, but it was clear of all actual danger, as far as
  Lop-ear could make out.</p>

  <p>So he ran back to the proper distance, ran forward, and hurled himself
  high into the air.</p>

  <p>His teeth clicked only a few inches beneath the prize.</p>

  <p>He went back again. His eyes were red-stained with passionate desire now,
  and his mouth was drooling. Again, again, he drove himself as high as he
  could into the air.</p>

  <p>Then, standing back for another try, he measured the leap and told himself
  that he could never manage the thing. His brain was strong enough to give him
  that clear assurance, and therefore he retreated after the manner of his kind
  to the first high place in the clearing, and sat down and lifted his voice in
  mourning. If he had found a vast bull moose or an elk bogged in the snow and
  had been afraid of tackling the monster himself, he would have sat down in
  the same fashion and sent up the same wild, long-drawn, unearthly howl. Every
  wolf within miles, hearing it, would know that it meant just one thing: "Red
  meat to be had! Red meat to be had!" And they would come. They could hardly
  resist coming.</p>

  <p>He sat down and howled, and his cry reached the ears of a far greater and
  wiser wolf in the distance&mdash;Frosty, that sleek and untroubled robber of
  farmyards on the one hand and the wilderness on the other.</p>

  <p>In what a complicated way Fate was working against Frosty, using in part
  the skill of the trapper and in part the wiles of Frosty's own kind! Hardly
  had Frosty heard that first long wail when the voice of Lop-ear snapped off
  into silence; for as he shifted back in giving his yell a greater volume, he
  had done what Bill Gary expected, and put his foot into a trap that shut its
  strong teeth of steel into the flesh and tendons of the leg and bit down
  toward the bone.</p>

  <p>But Frosty could not tell that. All he knew was that there had been one
  wolf cry of such a volume that it announced the presence of a he-wolf of
  almost, if not quite, his own proportions. If that were the case, the fellow
  had to be thrashed or killed.</p>

  <p>Frosty turned with joy on the trail of a fight and ran with winged feet
  down the wind to get at the stranger. It was his duty, and it was his pride,
  to keep his own run as clear of other wolves as he could. If he had resided
  constantly among the mountains, he would have kept the marches of his domain
  as free from other wolves as the parlor table of a good housewife is free
  from dust. But Frosty made so many and such long excursions in the dangerous
  lowlands, where the habitations of man were thick, that he did not keep his
  kingdom properly policed. He was all the keener, therefore, to get at the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>As for fighting, he knew all about it. There was hardly a night, during
  his travels from village to village and from ranch to ranch, when he did not
  run into whole packs of dogs. Some of them would run at the mere scent of a
  wolf. But others were his full equal in size and had been bred to the work.
  Therefore Frosty was kept efficient in the cunning fence of tooth and
  shoulder with which a wolf lays his peers low.</p>

  <p>He knew how to shift his big weight like a shadow, feinting here and
  there. He knew how to strive for a hamstring as well as for the throat, which
  was the limit of fighting sense of many wolves. He knew, even&mdash;and dogs
  had taught him this&mdash;that a leg hold, maintained half a second with due
  wrenchings, would probably break the bone. He knew that when the other fellow
  has been overturned by a charge there is always the belly as a larger and
  easier target. A wound there may be as fatal, though not so quickly.</p>

  <p>One might consider Frosty, in fact, not so much as a mere sneak thief, as
  he could be held a bold pirate that cruised through dangerous waters and
  constantly defied the attacks of whole fleets of armed ships of war. And this
  was certainly true: that more than almost any other of his kind, he had the
  sort of pride that makes a warrior stand and fight instead of running away,
  even from overwhelming odds.</p>

  <p>There was one occasion when he had driven a whole pack of five wolves from
  the freshly killed carcass of an elk; not that he needed the meat, but
  because he wanted to see what a mixture of bluff, courage, and fighting skill
  could accomplish.</p>

  <p>This was the Frosty that you must have in mind as he hurried down the wind
  to find the meaning of that voice which had dared to give tongue in the midst
  of his realm. Imagine him as a great form of misty gray, swiftly running,
  with his head high, since there was no scent for him to follow.</p>

  <p>He was almost on top of the clearing before the scent of man struck him
  like the pealing sound of a rifle. The scent doubled him up and turned him
  around. He skirted rapidly, furtively, around the clearing, and on the
  farther side of it he found the trail of the big wolf which had come there
  before him. Moreover, the wind carried to him two smells of blood. One was
  venison; one was that of a wounded wolf.</p>

  <p>It was very intriguing. It was just the sort of a scent that one might
  expect to come across where a wolf had succeeded in pulling down a deer and
  had been wounded in the struggle.</p>

  <p>On his belly, Frosty pulled himself through the brush and came out on the
  verge of the open, and there he had sight of a figure which made him bristle
  the hair of his mane and rise slowly to his feet, with glaring eyes.</p>

  <p>For there on the knoll in the middle of the clearing lay a huge wolf. Yes,
  a monster almost of his own proportions. The head of the stranger was turned
  toward him. His snarling lips unmasked fangs of terrible proportions.</p>

  <p>What amazed Frosty was that the stranger did not deign to rise to meet
  him. It was as though the big fellow preferred to keep his gaze fixed on the
  bit of red meat that dangled in the branches of the pine tree to the right.
  Poor fool, could he not tell that that meat must have been placed there by
  the hand of man?</p>

  <p>Observe the cruel workings of fate against Frosty! If the trapped wolf had
  risen an instant sooner, if there had been the slightest sight or jangling
  sound of the steel chain, if there had been the least suspicion of a trap,
  Frosty would have given that place a berth miles wide. But as it was, he was
  merely overwhelmed with rage at what he considered the contemptuous
  indifference of the stranger.</p>

  <p>Left to his own cunning, Frosty would have detected every trap that even
  Bill Gary could have placed for him. Already for six months he had been
  avoiding them. But now, half blinded by rage, he hurled himself straight at
  the enemy. He reached the knoll. And as he reached it, as the stranger rose,
  too late Frosty saw the glitter of the deadly chain and the trap that was
  attached to a foreleg of Lop-ear. For in that very instant, as he tried to
  put on the brakes, Frosty jammed his left hind foot right into a Newhouse
  trap!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; BATTLE AND DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">THE charge of Frosty had brought him well within the leaping
  distance of Lop-ear. That big fellow was a fighter on his own account, with
  plenty of wolf experience behind him. He went right in, low and hard, and got
  a tooth parry for his pains.</p>

  <p>A tooth parry is executed by a wolf that knows its business and trusts the
  strength of its teeth. It is a slashing stroke, not at the body, but at the
  striking mouth of an enemy. Lop-ear, with slashed lips, shrank back from that
  strange shock, and as he shrank, Frosty jumped in and gave him the shoulder
  thrust. The full weight of his big body was behind that blow, and Lop-ear
  immediately dropped over on his back.</p>

  <p>He never rose again. It was as though a sword had opened his throat with a
  slashing blow. The grip of Frosty finished the battle there and then.</p>

  <p>But the instant Lop-ear was dead, the limp body became of no importance.
  Those other teeth of steel which were fastened in the hind leg of Frosty were
  what mattered. He sat down and studied what had happened.</p>

  <p>The grip did not grow less. Once a bulldog had clamped down on his leg and
  kept working in its teeth to break the bone. That was the way this skeleton
  jaw of death, this grisly and cold monster, locked its grip on the leg of
  Frosty.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he pointed his nose at the sky, and a howl worked up in his
  throat, a yell of despair. That sound was never uttered. He had learned
  during long process of time that noise makes no matter better in the
  wilderness. It can bring trouble, but never help.</p>

  <p>Therefore Frosty swallowed the yell of pain, the appeal for sympathy.
  Instead, he turned his head once more and considered the only possible way of
  escape. He got up and tentatively pulled until the chain was tight. There was
  no give to it. He went over and studied the way the chain disappeared into a
  narrow hole in the ground. Buried in that hole was wood. That was as far as
  the intelligence of Frosty could solve the mystery. The iron came like a
  snake out of the ground, and the bodiless jaws were attached to the
  chain.</p>

  <p>Yet there was another resource.</p>

  <p>He could not free himself with a sound body, but he could escape by
  maiming himself. He could gnaw off the foot that was imprisoned in the grasp
  of the trap. Already the leg was numb below the point where the steel teeth
  were fastened upon him.</p>

  <p>He was about to grind his powerful teeth through the bones of his own leg
  when there was another interruption.</p>

  <p>Up the hillside, far away, Bill Gary had heard the mournful wail of
  Lop-ear some time ago. His dogs had heard it, also, and had been anxious to
  run toward the sound. But Gary, as he turned and countermarched, kept them at
  hand. It was only when he was comparatively close to the clearing that he
  allowed the big, savage brutes to cut loose and run ahead toward the silence
  of the traps.</p>

  <p>And now Frosty saw them lurching through the brush and out into the open.
  He stood up. Pain from his wound hunched his back. Hatred and loathing of
  these enemies made his hair bristle. They were huge. Either of them might
  make a formidable antagonist, even if his feet were free for maneuvering in
  the battle. The two together would probably tear the life out of him, and he
  knew it.</p>

  <p>Frosty despised his fate. There had been nobler ways of dying, as when the
  great grizzly almost cornered him one day, or as when the dog pack in the
  village had actually tumbled him off his feet. But now, against only two
  dogs, to be found pinned down to the ground, helpless.</p>

  <p>He stood there rigid, glaring. The horrible scent of man blew to him from
  the reeking bodies of the dogs. They were man-made engines of battle, and he
  hated them with the religious hatred of the wilderness.</p>

  <p>They knew their work, this pair. Tiger circled immediately around to the
  rear and charged. Shock came in from the front.</p>

  <p>For that frontal attack Frosty apparently braced himself, acting as though
  he intended to abandon his hind quarters to the second enemy until he had
  disposed of the first attacker. But that was not at all what he had in his
  cunning mind.</p>

  <p>Truly and strongly, Shock rushed in to carry his charge home as Tiger
  flashed in from the rear, but from the corner of his eye Frosty gauged the
  proper instant. Then he wheeled and struck.</p>

  <p>Tiger tried to dodge. In trying to dodge, he naturally lifted his head a
  little. That was why Frosty found the most perfect target that a wolf could
  ask for, and flashed both his fangs in the soft under throat of Tiger.</p>

  <p>Shock, overcharging his target that had shifted so suddenly, made a flying
  snap that laid open the haunch of Frosty. Then, as Shock turned, he saw his
  companion standing back, coughing blood, and standing on legs that were
  already beginning to tremble at the hocks and knees.</p>

  <p>A wiser dog than Shock might have realized that, for all his size and
  strength, he was not capable of meeting this master of fight. But Shock was
  not wise, really. His eyes were red, and in his brain there was no knowledge
  except that of battle. He had been bred to fly at the enemy. He was hurled by
  the will of his absent master, like a javelin at the mark. So he plunged
  straight in at Frosty.</p>

  <p>For Frosty it was child's play now. He stood erect and huge till the
  instant of the contact. Then he dropped flat to the ground and slashed
  upward. Shock stumbled away with a great sword cut across his belly. That
  wound alone would have finished him in time, but the valiant brute swung
  around blindly, hungering for one good grip of his jaws on the enemy.</p>

  <p>He might as well have gripped at a ghost. Frosty sidestepped, then bowled
  Shock over and put his grip on the throat.</p>

  <p>When he stood back, Shock lay still, and there was a vague comfort in the
  heart of the wolf.</p>

  <p>He knew, if ever an animal could have known, that battle was his destiny,
  and then death in the wild. Now he had fought, and the dead lay around him.
  No matter what happened then, even with this single day behind him, he had
  not lived in vain.</p>

  <p>It was then that he heard the heavy, clumsy beat of the foot of man, for
  big Bill Gary was approaching swiftly. By the footfall alone, Frosty would
  have known that it was man. He did not need the scent of powder and steel
  that was blowing down the wind to him. He knew now that he had no time even
  to sever his leg below the trap and go halting away. In all the world of his
  cunning devices there was only one poor expedient left, and that was to drop
  and lie like a stone.</p>

  <p>He had seen other animals play possum, but none ever played it better than
  Frosty as he lay with glassy eyes partly open, his mouth wide, his tongue
  lolling out on the pine needles. His very breathing was so controlled that
  only the most considerate eye could have detected the rise and fall of his
  ribs beneath their deep coating of fur.</p>

  <p>That was the picture that Bill Gary saw as he came rushing out into the
  clearing. He saw Shock dead, Tiger kicking himself around in the last
  struggle for breath, a big wolf also dead, with one leg caught in a trap, and
  above all&mdash;a sight that made all else as nothing in his mind&mdash;here
  was, at last, the great marauder, Frosty, stretched on the ground with open
  mouth and tongue lolling!</p>

  <p>They had killed Frosty, and he had taken toll of his slayers. Well, it was
  a pity to lose Shock and Tiger, but, after all, one has to pay for great
  results. People would remember him for this. They would say, in days to come:
  "Bill Gary, that rich man&mdash;that fellow that found the great gold
  mine&mdash;the same one that caught Frosty, the famous wolf."</p>

  <p>That was the way people would have to talk about him. Because it is
  possible to overlook a man who has done only one thing&mdash;the
  accomplishment may be put down to luck or to chance&mdash;but when a man has
  done two outstanding things, his peers must stand back and take off their
  hats.</p>

  <p>The battle was plainly over. So the trapper put his rifle against a tree
  and came forward with only the ax in his hand. He came on slowly, with the
  loss of his two fine dogs a diminishing fact in his mind, every instant, and
  glory in the taking of Frosty outruling all other things in the world. It
  grew in his passionate mind into a thing equal with the finding of the gold
  mine. If he had had to take his choice between the two accomplishments at
  that instant, perhaps he would have preferred the trapping of the great
  wolf.</p>

  <p>He was a monster. Bill Gary had sometimes felt that the size of the
  footprint could not really have indicated the actual bulk of the marauder. He
  called Frosty, in his own mind, "Big-foot." And yet here was the actuality
  spread magnificently over the ground. There was no other wolf in the world
  like this, he was sure. Two thousand dollars? It no longer seemed an absurdly
  high reward for the catching of the monster. It was almost worth two thousand
  dollars to have one look at that king of the wilderness and see what a wolf
  could really be like!</p>

  <p>Those were the thoughts of big Bill Gary as he strolled up closer and
  closer to the spot where the wolf lay, with the wind ruffling his fur. He
  came within three steps, within two, within one.</p>

  <p>And then the heap of fur twitched into life. Bill Gary had a chance to
  heave up the ax, but he was far too late to spring back. The slash of the
  knife-sharp fangs caught him across the inside of his right thigh and cut
  through the tough cloth of his trousers, and into the deep, soft
  flesh&mdash;cutting and tearing.</p>

  <p>The wrenching force of that stroke dropped big Bill Gary to his knees. The
  agony of the torn flesh half blinded his eyes. It was a smoke of pain filled
  with red sparks that flared up across his mind, and through it he saw
  Frosty.</p>

  <p>He struck at the leaping form. The blow of the ax glanced, and the teeth
  of the wolf reached at his throat. He struck with all the force of his left
  hand. The blow fell; the teeth ripped all the tendons inside his wrist with a
  knife stroke.</p>

  <p>He had only one hand, now, for the swaying of the ax, and Frosty, with
  blood-dripping mouth, was rushing in at him again.</p>

  <p>He had the ax by the narrow neck as he struck to parry that rush. The wolf
  swerved from the blow and came in again, and with a half swing of his arm,
  Bill Gary smashed the back of the ax home right on the broad top of Frosty's
  head.</p>

  <p>The lobo dropped, either stunned or brained. But, impelled by the force of
  his leap, he struck against the legs of Gary. The breath went out of Frosty's
  body with an audible grunt. The impact knocked Gary backward, and as he
  strove to get to his feet, his wounded right leg gave way under him, and he
  fell on his side.</p>

  <p>A mist of whirling darkness poured over his brain, and he fainted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; FREEDOM FOR FROSTY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE total surprise, the horror of the grinning mask of the
  wolf, the agony of the wounds, the hot gushing of his own blood, had unstrung
  even the steel nerves of Bill Gary&mdash;but only for a few moments.</p>

  <p>When he recovered and sat up, he was lying in a pool of blood. And more
  blood was pumping out of his thigh and out of his wrist. Arteries had been
  severed in both places&mdash;big arteries.</p>

  <p>He knew the extent of the danger by the frightful giddiness of his brain.
  There was still strength in one hand, however. As for the left hand, he would
  never be able to use that again. Or would the cunning doctors actually be
  able to tie severed tendons together?</p>

  <p>To stop the blood was the first thing.</p>

  <p>He knew that those few moments of unconsciousness during which he had lain
  on the ground had brought him to the verge of death, for his heart had been
  strongly pumping out his lifeblood every instant of that time.</p>

  <p>Now, in a frenzy of panic, he wanted to stop both flows of blood at
  once.</p>

  <p>He steadied himself. He could not do both things at once. That was
  impossible. It was a time to make every second count, to be calm and cool. So
  he made himself calm and cool.</p>

  <p>He ripped off his coat with his right hand.</p>

  <p>He kneeled on the coat, held one edge of it between his teeth, and with
  his hunting knife slashed off several strips. He took two of those strips,
  still working with teeth and hand, and twisted them together. The gaping
  wound in his thigh was what counted most. He ran the cloth around the top of
  his leg and knotted it. It was barely long enough to serve the purpose. He
  had to lean over and almost break his back, to catch one end of the cloth in
  his teeth. Then he worked the bandage up. He took a short stick, shoved it
  inside the bandage, and twisted.</p>

  <p>As he twisted, he saw the compression of the flesh open the gaping mouth
  of the wound, but the flow of the blood diminished. He kept on twisting until
  the bandage pressed down through his flesh. The agony of it burned him to the
  bone. But he kept on until not a drop of blood was flowing from the wound.
  Then he took out a bit of twine&mdash;what man of the wilds will do without
  string or thongs of some sort in his pockets&mdash;and lashed the stick in
  place.</p>

  <p>After that, he did the same thing with his torn wrist. The devil was in
  the wolf that it had been able to open arteries with each stroke of its
  fangs! The devil was in the wolf, and in the luck of Bill Gary.</p>

  <p>Then he told himself that this was his payment. He had found incredible
  wealth. He had unlocked the ribs of the ancient mountains to get at it. Well,
  there is always bad luck in store for the finders of treasure. He was having
  his misfortune now.</p>

  <p>Afterward, in the long years to come, he would be able to revel in the
  wealth. He would be able to look back on the day when he had fought with that
  incarnate fiend, Frosty.</p>

  <p>Who in the world had ever heard of a wolf playing possum before? Yes, they
  had been known to do it. Coyotes will do it, too.</p>

  <p>Then, as he finally sealed up the flow of blood on his wrists, he became
  very faint, and was nauseated. The trees spun around and around before his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>He endured that, closing his eyes, stretching himself on his back. He was
  almost glad of the two hot bands of agony that were biting into his flesh on
  his leg and on his arm. That pain would bring him back to his senses. Or had
  he already lost so much blood that he was sure to die?</p>

  <p>He put a hand over his heart and could feel nothing. He listened calmly,
  and made out by sense, not by sound, the fluttering pulsation.</p>

  <p>Live? Of course he would live! He pushed himself to a sitting posture. His
  left arm was blackening and swelling with the checked currents of the blood.
  His leg below the bandage was numb. Half of him was dead already. He felt
  that. He was suddenly, calmly sure that he would in fact die before he ever
  managed to get back to the cabin.</p>

  <p>If he got back to the cabin, he could light two fires in front of his
  shack. That smoke, as it rose, would be a signal to Luke Warner, three miles
  farther down the valley. He and Luke had arranged the signals long before. A
  man may get terribly ill or may have an accident which keeps him from
  traveling through the mountains. In case anything happened to one of them,
  they were to send the signal&mdash;two columns of smoke, steadily rising.</p>

  <p>If he could get back to the cabin, he could manage to light the fires, and
  then Luke Warner would come. Luke was a fellow to be depended upon. Mean and
  hard, but dependable.</p>

  <p>The nausea returned upon him. Something was sickening him, and he told
  himself that it was the smell of wolf.</p>

  <p>That made him look at the motionless body of the great lobo, and he saw
  that from the place where the ragged back of the ax had torn the scalp of the
  wolf, blood was flowing. Well, blood does not flow from dead bodies, and,
  therefore, Frosty was still alive!</p>

  <p>The mouth of Bill Gary twisted to the side. It was almost a smile. There
  was a chance&mdash;one chance in ten thousand&mdash;that some one might come
  up here and find the two dogs, the other wolf, and Gary himself lying
  dead&mdash;and Frosty still alive!</p>

  <p>That lucky stranger would claim the scalp money! He would get the bounty
  that really belonged to a dead man!</p>

  <p>And suddenly Bill Gary hated the entire living world of man. They lived,
  and little did they care how he lay in agony on the mountain, slowly
  dying!</p>

  <p>They lived, and the wolf lived.</p>

  <p>He crawled over to the tree. It was hard to hunch himself along on one
  knee and one hand. He put his ruined left hand down and used the left arm,
  also. The agony was only a little more frightful. What bothered him most was
  the thought of the pine needles and the dirt getting into the opening and
  shutting wound in his wrist.</p>

  <p>He got the rifle, tied it to him, and crawled back to shoot Frosty. The
  blood was still trickling from the head of the stunned wolf.</p>

  <p>Then another thought came to him.</p>

  <p>If he died, and the wolf died, then his gold mine was lost. No man would
  ever find it, because these mountains had been prospected thoroughly for gold
  and the miners had given up. The secret of the mine would be lost. In a
  single year or so the weather would cover over the raw wounds in the ledge
  where the gleam of the gold still shone out.</p>

  <p>The greatest thing in his life would then be as nothing! It would be
  almost as though he had not lived, in fact!</p>

  <p>When he thought of that, he cursed softly. If he used too much breath, it
  started him gasping, and the trees and the mountains spun around him in dark,
  swift circles.</p>

  <p>That was when he remembered the Red Cross collars on the dead dogs, and
  with a stroke of imagination his mind leaped the rest of the way. He went to
  Shock, the nearest body, and unbuckled the heavy steel collar. He took out
  his notebook, opened it, and wrote with his indelible pencil, under his last
  entry:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR ALEC: Go to place described and find a ledge with a
  gold outcrop. I think I'm dying. Good luck to you. I give you the mine. It's
  as rich as thunder.<br>
  <br>
  BILL GARY.</p>

  <p>He tore the page out of the book and folded it small. On the outside, he
  wrote the address:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Alexander Gary, Newlands. Please deliver."</p>

  <p>He wrapped that folded bit of paper in some of the oiled silk, opened the
  little compartment in the dog collar, and placed the message inside. Then he
  crawled to the senseless body of the wolf and fastened the collar around the
  great neck. It fitted so snugly that he could be sure the beast would not be
  able to rub it off.</p>

  <p>Watching closely, he could see the slight rise and fall of the ribs as the
  senseless monster breathed. He was glad. He was wonderfully glad that his
  messenger might live&mdash;if only the ax stroke had not shattered the
  skull.</p>

  <p>He crawled to the rear leg that was fastened in the trap. He had to bear
  down with his ruined left hand and with his right to unspring the powerful
  trap. And his head spun around as he made the effort.</p>

  <p>But at last the great wolf was free.</p>

  <p>Bill Gary dragged himself to a little distance and got his back to a
  tree.</p>

  <p>To lie down and die, like a silly fool, like a baby&mdash;that would be
  too horrible for speech. But to die sitting up, looking the world in the
  face&mdash;that was not so bad.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see the wolf get up and start away before he gave up the
  ghost.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that he had a small metal flask of whisky in his hip
  pocket. It shocked him to think that he could have forgotten this until such
  a late moment. Instantly the flask was uncorked and half the contents flowed
  down his throat.</p>

  <p>When he looked up from his drink, he saw Frosty actually rising to his
  feet. He swayed a moment, staggered, and then, with a motion as fluidly
  sliding as though there were not a wound on his body, Frosty faded away among
  the trees and was gone.</p>

  <p>He was gone, but he could not escape men forever. He had learned much
  wisdom in his life. No doubt this one day had taught him several profound
  chapters. But nevertheless he could not hold out forever against the wiles of
  traps, poison, hunting packs of fast and savage dogs and, above all,
  high-power rifles. Some day he would fall. And when he fell, certainly the
  mystery of finding a steel collar around his throat would cause the collar to
  be removed. Might it start merely a legend that Frosty was not a wolf at all,
  but merely a dog that had run wild?</p>

  <p>But surely, one day, men would open the little container and find therein
  the message.</p>

  <p>So Gary's great enemy, Frosty, became his one link with the world, the
  hand which he reached out for the recognition of posterity.</p>

  <p>For when the message was read, the mine would be discovered, and
  then&mdash;well, they could hardly do less than name the mine after him. For
  every drop of blood shed from his veins, an ounce of yellow gold would pour
  out into circulation. It would work evil and it would work good, here and
  there. And all that it accomplished would be the work of a dead man, Bill
  Gary.</p>

  <p>It was a satisfaction to him. It was a foretaste of immortality. It made
  him smile.</p>

  <p>And, above all, it seemed to Bill Gary most right and fitting that he
  should have fastened his gift to the world around the neck of a wolf.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; THE FUGITIVES</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER a while big Bill Gary stopped meditating about death
  because he was tired of it, and because a cold wind began to thrill through
  his wounds. Their pain had joined. The pain from the wrist rose up the arm
  and at the shoulder it encountered the pain from the wounded thigh, which
  possessed all the rest of the body.</p>

  <p>Bill Gary was tired of sitting there. If it were better to meet death
  sitting down than lying down, it was still better to meet death in action
  than in repose, so he began to act.</p>

  <p>He crawled out of the clearing, out of the strip of trees, and to the
  verge of the treeless waste of snow. He was a mile above the cabin, and he
  started for it, not because he thought that he had strength to get there, but
  because he despised inactive waiting for the end.</p>

  <p>It was easier than he expected. It was the sort of a thing that one can do
  more easily than think. To crawl a mile would have been totally impossible,
  and he could not have gone a hundred yards up a slope, but this was
  different. He had snow under him all the way, and there was a continually
  declining slope to the ground. He could half roll and half slide. He moved
  his body like a fish wriggling through slime rather than like a land animal.
  He received a heavy battering before he got to the bottom of the rise among
  the trees that shrouded his shack. He half rolled and half crawled to the
  cabin, and fainted on the threshold of it.</p>

  <p>When he wakened again, a few minutes later, he found himself much weaker.
  There was a hurrying pulse in his temples like a clock ticking all out of
  time. Everything that his eyes looked on shuddered as though an earthquake
  were shaking the ground.</p>

  <p>He said to himself: "Bill, you're going to die, you old fool!"</p>

  <p>Then he thought of the mine again, and he was sorry that he had inclosed
  the news of it in the collar of the wolf. If he had only known that he could
  reach his cabin, he would have waited and written a letter. Then, with his
  pair of smokes, he could have called up Warner and confided the letter to him
  to be mailed, a month or so later, when Warner went to town.</p>

  <p>He would still be able to write the letter, he told himself. He was going
  to die, all right, but not immediately. There was the sort of metal in him
  that rubs out only after long and constant friction.</p>

  <p>He dragged himself to his knees and got to the table of soft pine, which
  he had made himself. He had built a drawer under that table. He was prouder
  of that drawer than of almost anything he had ever done, because it was a
  homemade luxury such as most men of the wilderness would not have considered
  worthy of thought. It was this drawer that he drew open, and then he worked
  himself up onto the bench that ranged beside the table.</p>

  <p>Then he lay across the table for a moment, nauseated more than ever, his
  brain whirling. He wished that he could die without being sick at the
  stomach.</p>

  <p>He pushed himself erect. The top of the table was new and white because it
  was only recently made, and planed down. Now there was blood on it. In his
  rolling, sliding descent, his clothes had been caught and torn in many
  places; his flesh had been caught and torn, also. The blood stood out on the
  top of the table as on a field of snow.</p>

  <p>He got out of the drawer a sheet of letter paper and an envelope. In
  indelible pencil he wrote the address first:</p>

  <p class="letter">MR. ALEXANDER GARY,<br>
  <br>
  Newlands.</p>

  <p>Then he started on the sheet of paper:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR ALEC: I'm done for. I got Frosty, and Frosty got
  me.<br>
  <br>
  I've tapped open the biggest vein of gold, to-day, that you ever seen. Then I
  caught Frosty in a trap, and he chawed me almost to death.<br>
  <br>
  I took and wrote out the description of where to find the mine and put one of
  my dogs' Red Cross collars on Frosty and put the description in the collar
  and turned Frosty loose, because I thought that I sure never would&mdash;</p>

  <p>His hand paused.</p>

  <p>It was hard work pushing the pencil, because it bit not only into the
  paper, but also into the softness of the wood on which the paper smoothly
  rested.</p>

  <p>There was a cloud before his eyes. This time it was not whirling, but it
  was thickening and moving up on him, little by little. He rubbed the back of
  his hand across his eyes, but that did not help very much. The darkness kept
  on growing.</p>

  <p>He got out the flask of whisky.</p>

  <p>"Hell," said Bill Gary, "it's like as though there was a kind of a night
  in the middle of the day."</p>

  <p>He could not uncork the flask with his numb fingers, but he worried it out
  with his teeth. He drank the rest of what was in the flask, holding the neck
  of the bottle between his teeth. It slewed out of his mouth, when it was
  emptied, and bumped on his shoulder on the way to the floor.</p>

  <p>He was no longer nauseated, and he was glad of that. He told himself that
  perhaps he would not die. He wanted to go to sleep for a minute, and after
  that, he would wake up and finish writing the letter. Alec Gary was a good
  kid, and Alec ought to have the mine&mdash;if Bill Gary died.</p>

  <p>Bill Gary put his forehead on his right arm. Everything was confused, and
  red lights began to move in his darkness, not whirling about, but wavering
  toward him like lanterns swinging at the sides of walking men. He closed his
  eyes harder. The darkness grew complete. He slept.</p>

  <p>That was the way Barry Christian and Duff Gregor found him. It is hard to
  say that blind chance brought Barry Christian, the greatest of all criminal
  brains and hands, through the mountains at exactly the right time to find
  Bill Gary dead with the news of the finding of the gold mine written out on a
  piece of paper. It is easier and more convenient to say that there was a
  malice in Fate which had designed this happening with malignant care.</p>

  <p>For many miles now, Barry Christian and Duff Gregor had been fleeing. They
  had had almost a dozen men about them in the beginning; they had only
  themselves now. For Jim Silver had hounded them closely all the way. He was
  still hounding them, perhaps, unless the strength had finally departed out of
  the tireless limbs of Parade, the golden stallion.</p>

  <p>A great, bright ghost, Parade had stridden over the leagues behind them.
  All the others among the pursuers, gradually, had dropped away. All the
  others of the fugitives had been worn out and turned to this side or to
  that.</p>

  <p>Only Barry Christian kept on, with Duff Gregor. Gregor himself, big and
  strong as he was, would have fallen away with the rest, except that Christian
  gave him extra support and help, the reason being that the resemblance of
  Gregor to Jim Silver had been helpful to Barry before and might prove helpful
  again. So Christian kept him along.</p>

  <p>They had worn out one set of horses after another. Where they could buy
  horses, they bought them. Where they could not buy horses, they stole them.
  They crossed the Bull's Head Range on foot, a hundred terrible miles that
  Christian forced Duff Gregor to travel. He walked behind Gregor.</p>

  <p>The last twenty miles, he beat Gregor like a beast, with his quirt. When
  Gregor fell from exhaustion, Barry Christian kicked him to his feet again and
  forced him to travel on.</p>

  <p>They got horses on the other side of the range. Christian tied Duff Gregor
  into the saddle and led the horse ahead, while Gregor lay senseless with
  sleep. That was the way they had managed to keep out of the grasp of Jim
  Silver on Parade. That was the only way.</p>

  <p>It might be that on the edge of the Blue Waters they had shaken the great
  Silver off the trail. It was more likely that Silver was somewhere behind
  them, either reading their sign or else guessing with his accustomed uncanny
  accuracy what was going on inside their minds. Duff Gregor, for his part,
  felt that death itself was almost better than being pursued any longer in
  this fashion. The pain of death could bite him to the bone only once, whereas
  now he was dying every day of his life, a hundred times over.</p>

  <p>The big body of Duff Gregor looked more like that of Jim Silver than ever
  before, for the immense labor of the flight had taken away all excess flesh
  and left him with his shoulders broad and heavy and the rest of the body
  tapering off.</p>

  <p>His face looked more like the face of Silver than ever, also. It, too, had
  been refined by agony. Only his forehead was different, for the brow of
  Silver always held a sort of gloomy serenity, and the brow of Duff Gregor was
  heavily contracted.</p>

  <p>As they came up the hillside, this day, it was Gregor who first noticed
  the hint of a trail and said:</p>

  <p>"Somebody lives not far from here."</p>

  <p>"We'll find 'em all right," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"So that we can leave our trail posted for Silver?" asked Gregor
  satirically.</p>

  <p>The pale, handsome face of Barry Christian turned toward his companion,
  and he smiled. His gentle and musical voice answered: "We need fresh horses,
  partner."</p>

  <p>"Not likely to be horses, where we're heading. This isn't a horse trail,
  you can see."</p>

  <p>"This isn't a horse trail, but there may be horses, and if there are not
  horses, there may be burros. Anything will be useful. Even a dog."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Duff Gregor, looking about the tips of the trees at the
  blue-white of the sea above timber line that extended into the sky, "you mean
  that you're really going to cross the Blue Waters in one march?"</p>

  <p>"Not in one march," said Christian. "We'll camp for one night up yonder,
  and freeze and chatter our teeth till the morning. And then we'll go on again
  and try to finish the crossing to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather turn around and face Jim Silver," cried out Duff Gregor, in a
  passion. "I'd rather face him and have it out with him. Look! We're two men,
  and he's only one!"</p>

  <p>Barry Christian looked not at Gregor, but down at his long, graceful
  hands.</p>

  <p>Many a man said, and was willing to swear to it, that those famous hands
  of Barry Christian were even more dreadful with weapons than were the hands
  of Jim Silver. Even if they were not, there could not be very much actual
  difference between the prowess of the two men.</p>

  <p>"You can beat him all by yourself, Barry!" cried Duff Gregor. "You can
  beat anybody in the world, if you make up your mind to it."</p>

  <p>Barry Christian slowly shook his head. Sorrow came into his face and made
  it handsomer than ever&mdash;like the face of one suffering spiritual pain
  beyond the concerns of this earth of ours.</p>

  <p>"Silver's beaten me," he said. "He's beaten me with his bare hands and
  he's beaten me with guns. He's outtricked and he's outfought me. Sometimes I
  even think that the only reason I'm permitted to be alive is so that the
  young men of the world can have the spectacle of Barry Christian being kicked
  around the world by the great Jim Silver, the upholder of the law. That's a
  moral sight. Deters the youth of the country from crime."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor suddenly grinned. When he smiled, all the brute in him came
  out, and his entire resemblance to Jim Silver flickered and then went
  out.</p>

  <p>"By thunder, Barry," he said, "when I hear you talk like that, it's as
  good as reading a book. You say the queerest things!"</p>

  <p>"Do I?" asked Christian softly.</p>

  <p>No one could tell what he meant, when he looked and spoke like this.
  Sometimes Duff Gregor half expected to have his throat cut and be left by the
  trail. That would be the instant that Christian decided that Gregor was more
  of a present encumbrance than a future assistance. In any case, he would not
  want Gregor to fall alive into the hands of his enemies. Gregor knew too
  much.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said Christian. "Perhaps I should have been a
  teacher or a minister, or some such thing, leading a secluded life, and
  trying to help other men toward a vision of the truth."</p>

  <p>Big Duff Gregor filled the woods with his bawling laughter.</p>

  <p>"There you go again. You sure beat me. You beat anybody. You're a scream,
  Barry! Hey, there's the house!"</p>

  <p>Through the tree trunks they saw the broken picture of the little house.
  Falling snow obscured it, also. The sky was filled with deep miles of gray
  that promised a soft ocean of snow to descend upon the earth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; OUTLAW'S PLAN</h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTAIN went in first. He was always first, when Gregor
  was his companion, because he profoundly distrusted everything that Gregor
  was apt to do in an emergency. He detested Gregor with all his soul, as he
  would have detested a false coin. But still, the resemblance between the man
  and the famous Jim Silver was too great to permit him to be discarded.
  Counterfeit he was, but even so he might be of immense use in the future.</p>

  <p>At the door of the shack, Christian saw the great body of Bill Gary
  spilled across the table. He called, got no answer, and stepped to the table.
  His head was still bent above the still figure when Gregor asked calmly:
  "That mug is dead, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Christian slowly lifted his head and looked toward Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's dead."</p>

  <p>Big Gregor stepped to the table and stared calmly down at the body. He had
  seen plenty of death&mdash;since he had joined the forces of Barry
  Christian.</p>

  <p>"Look at&mdash;His left wrist is all torn."</p>

  <p>"I see it," said Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>He picked up the loose weight of Bill Gary, grasping him under the
  armpits, and dragged him toward the bunk that was built against the wall. A
  paper fluttered from the top of the table to the floor.</p>

  <p>Gregor picked up the feet of the dead man and helped lay him on the
  bunk.</p>

  <p>"Torn all to the devil," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Something got at him. Dogs&mdash;wolves," said Christian. He looked
  around the shack at the extra traps. "A trapper, and the wolves got him.
  That's rather pretty."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, that's pretty," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>He picked up the fallen paper. Christian was pulling a blanket over the
  face of the dead man, and, turning, he asked:</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"That? What?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>"That thing you picked up."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing."</p>

  <p>"You certainly wouldn't pick up nothing."</p>

  <p>"What could a gent pick up in a place like this?"</p>

  <p>"There was a piece of paper."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. With some stuff scribbled over it," said Gregor. "Let's see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Ain't worth seeing."</p>

  <p>Christian held out his left hand. Their eyes met, and those of Gregor fell
  away.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Just a crazy idea out of a dead man's head."</p>

  <p>"Dead men tell the truth, if they talk at all," said Christian.</p>

  <p>He took the paper which Gregor had crumpled, thrusting it into his pocket.
  Christian spread it out and read the contents aloud.</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR ALEC: I'm done for. I got Frosty, and Frosty got
  me.<br>
  <br>
  I've tapped open the biggest vein of gold, to-day, that you ever seen. Then I
  caught Frosty in a trap, and he chawed me almost to death.</p>

  <p>He paused and looked at Gregor. Gregor hung his head.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was just a crazy lot of drool," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>Christian said nothing. He continued to hold Gregor with his eye, like a
  fish dangling, dying at the end of a line. Then he went on with the remaining
  few lines, reading them aloud, quietly.</p>

  <p>He lowered the paper and then he said:</p>

  <p>"Nerve. That's what that dead man had. He traveled quite a distance on
  that ruined hand and spoiled leg. He crawled and rolled and slid. See how his
  clothes were torn to pieces?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I seen," said Gregor. "Think that there's anything in that
  drool?"</p>

  <p>"You know there's something in it," answered Christian. "You're dead
  certain that there's something in it. Otherwise, you wouldn't have planned to
  hold out the paper, duck away from me, and finally come back to this part of
  the world and look up Frosty."</p>

  <p>"Hey, listen, Barry&mdash;" began Gregor in a pleading voice.</p>

  <p>Christian bit his lip as though to keep it from curling with contempt.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said. "I know you pretty well, Gregor. But I hoped that
  I didn't know you as well as all this."</p>

  <p>"You take it pretty hard," said Gregor, "when all I meant was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quit it," said Christian.</p>

  <p>Gregor was gloomily silent.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian picked up the envelope.</p>

  <p>"This letter ought to go," he said, "to the hands of one Alexander Gary,
  in the town of Newlands. Unfortunately for him, however, he'll never see it.
  The letter has come into better hands than his, and those hands will find the
  gold mine, I imagine."</p>

  <p>"It's a dog-gone queer thing," muttered Gregor. "I never heard of anything
  like it."</p>

  <p>"Neither have I," said Christian.</p>

  <p>He stared with narrowed eyes at his companion.</p>

  <p>"It means several things," he said. "One is, that you're going to have
  your wish, Gregor."</p>

  <p>"What wish?" asked Gregor, half frightened by the tone and the cold, calm
  manner of Christian.</p>

  <p>"It means," said Christian, "that we're going to run no longer. We're
  going to stand our ground, and if Jim Silver overtakes us, we're going to
  fight it out with him. Does that suit you?"</p>

  <p>Gregor closed his eyes and shuddered. Then, looking up again, he
  muttered:</p>

  <p>"We were running for our lives a minute ago. There wasn't hardly anything
  to live for. But, now we've as good as got a gold mine, things look
  different, Barry. Why should we go and chuck ourselves away on a fight with
  Jim Silver, just for the fun of it?"</p>

  <p>He waited with a puckered brow, as one who is reasonably sure of receiving
  a reproof, but the pale, handsome face of Christian merely smiled in
  return.</p>

  <p>"I can understand that state of mind, too," he answered. "After all,
  Gregor, it's a pleasure to be with you. Whatever you do, you'll never
  surprise me. It's like listening to a twice-told tale. Well, here we are in
  the Blue Water Mountains, and here we stay until we find the wolf called
  Frosty. And on the neck of Frosty there's an iron collar, and somewhere in
  that collar there is the description of the location of the vein of gold. Is
  that clear?"</p>

  <p>"That's clear," muttered Gregor. "Sure it is."</p>

  <p>He added: "And Jim Silver?"</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver," said Christian, "may have had enough hunting to suit even
  him. He's followed this trail until even his best friend, Taxi, was worn out
  and had to quit the job. And Taxi has the strength and the endurance of a
  wild beast, when it comes to following a blood trail. It may be that Jim
  Silver is not following us into these mountains. If he is following us, he
  expects us to try to cut straight across the summits."</p>

  <p>"Through a storm like this?" queried Gregor.</p>

  <p>"He knows that we've gone through worse than this, to get away from him,"
  said Christian. "He knows that we've gone through hot hell and cold hell to
  get away from him, and a little feathery snowstorm like this could never stop
  us, I imagine he'll think. No, he'll drive straight through the mountains,
  and try to catch us on the other side."</p>

  <p>"And we?" asked Gregor hopefully. "We camp here?"</p>

  <p>"Camp here?" asked Christian, lifting his brows with a touch of surprise.
  "Are you out of your head, Gregor? Stay here in this shack as if we were in a
  trap, in case he manages to come up with the place? That would be pretty
  convenient for Jim Silver, Gregor. That would be about all that he would ask
  out of life&mdash;to find the pair of us lodged together in one house!"</p>

  <p>Gregor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," he said, "you tell us what we're to do. We go on with these
  horses, and they freeze in the cold unless they keep traveling, and
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Christian raised a hand, and the other was silent.</p>

  <p>"We have to do a little inquiring," he said. "It's as plain as can be that
  this dead man was a wolf trapper. It's as plain as can be that he trapped a
  wolf and the wolf chewed him up. We'll have to ask some one what that wolf
  was like."</p>

  <p>Gregor stared helplessly.</p>

  <p>"You ain't gone crazy, Barry, have you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"But look here. Who would know what that wolf is like? All wolves are
  about the same! Who could know what the wolf was like?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Christian, "he has a name&mdash;Frosty. And that means
  that he's a celebrity. One wolf in a million raises enough devil to get a
  nickname from people. You'll find that every man in these mountains knows
  something about Frosty, I suppose."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE PURSUER</h2>

  <p class="first">BLUE-GRAY dusk settled down through the blackness of the
  trees. The falling snow pressed the evening close on the heads of the pines.
  In the great smother of the storm the wind whirled, above the forest, and
  made obscure pools of motion. It was very cold; it was growing momentarily
  colder, for the wind came off the higher peaks to the northwest.</p>

  <p>But Jim Silver kept Parade to his work.</p>

  <p>He had lost all sign of the two men he was trailing something over an hour
  before. He could only hope, as he had hoped so often before, that he had been
  able to read the minds of the fugitives, and that he could guess in what
  direction they were riding. He felt, on the whole, that the pair would try to
  cut straight across the Blue Water Mountains in a couple of marches.</p>

  <p>He must follow. He felt that it would be best to strike right across to
  the farther side, not trying to find trail on the way, and then, in the
  distance, attempt to pick up the sign again. It would be very hard on Parade
  to make that forced march, but the stallion was whalebone and finest spring
  steel, and he would not fail.</p>

  <p>This very night, they would have to camp far above timber line, in the lee
  of some bluff; else they would have to move slowly on, all during the
  night.</p>

  <p>Silver swung down from the saddle and ran ahead, throwing the lines of the
  hackamore over the pommel of the saddle and leaving the stallion to
  follow.</p>

  <p>In this manner he gained two advantages. One was that he took his weight
  off the back of the horse. The other was that he broke trail for the
  stallion, to a certain extent, for he could depend on Parade to step exactly
  where his master had trod before him.</p>

  <p>As for the burning up of Silver's own strength, that did not matter.
  Nothing mattered except the horse. And it was this attitude of his,
  relentlessly enforced by practice all the way, that had enabled him to keep
  so close to the heels of men who were constantly picking up fresh relays of
  horseflesh to carry them away. Of the hundreds of miles they had traveled
  since the chase began&mdash;that great chase which men were never to
  forget&mdash;a good third of the distance had been covered by Silver on foot,
  with Parade following easily behind, like a dog at the heels of his
  master.</p>

  <p>In rough going, of steep ups and downs, Silver actually was on foot more
  than he was in the saddle. He had divorced himself utterly from the usual
  Western viewpoint, that man is helpless on his feet and must have a saddle to
  hold his weight. Like an Indian, patiently, Silver was accustomed to
  traveling over rough or smooth until exhaustion made his head swim. Then, and
  only then, he gave his weight to the saddle again.</p>

  <p>So it was that he ran down the near slope and then plodded steadily up the
  farther one with the head of the great horse nodding behind him. He used his
  eyes little, because the light was much too dim for them to be of much
  service. It was true that Christian and Gregor might at any moment have
  decided to turn back and waylay their enemy, but in that case he would trust
  to the wolfish keenness of the scent of Parade. The nostrils of Parade
  retained the wisdom they had picked up during the years when he had wandered
  as a wild horse through the mountain desert. And at the first suspicious
  sound or scent, he would give warning to his human companion.</p>

  <p>By night, also, it was better to have Parade at hand than any pair of
  human sentinels, no matter how keen of vision and hearing. There was a
  perfect partnership between the two. One was complementary to the other. Each
  had a perfect trust.</p>

  <p>Silver was well up the hillside before he came out of the trees into a
  little clearing at the very instant when the snort and stamp of Parade warned
  him that there might be danger ahead. And now, vaguely outlined through the
  falling snow of the twilight, Silver saw the silhouette of the shack.</p>

  <p>He held up his hand in a gesture which would force Parade to remain in
  place. Then he stole forward cautiously.</p>

  <p>The shack was probably uninhabited. Otherwise it would almost surely be
  lighted by a fire at this time of the day; since it was not likely that its
  occupant might be off on a trip in such weather as this. The greatest
  likelihood was that it had been thrown up by some prospector or trapper, and
  was long since abandoned.</p>

  <p>And yet no cautious wolf could have investigated the probable lair of a
  mountain lion with more care than Jim Silver showed as he advanced toward the
  place.</p>

  <p>He circled to the rear of it, first of all, and brought himself close to
  the wall, where he crouched, listening intently, shutting the noise of the
  storm out of his mind, and concentrating on any sound that might come out of
  the interior.</p>

  <p>He heard nothing, except those mysterious breathings which the wind makes
  through imperfect walls.</p>

  <p>After a time, he went to the front of the place, and found the door. It
  was latched, but not locked. There was a latchstring which he used, and then
  pushed the door open with a swift gesture and stepped inside.</p>

  <p>The thickness of the darkness was now perfect. And around him he found the
  odor of cookery which was not of a very ancient date. The fumes of fried
  bacon will linger for a long time on the walls of a shack.</p>

  <p>There was the smell of cookery, which proved that the shack was inhabited,
  or at least that it had been used not long before. That made it doubly
  strange to find the place empty and dark.</p>

  <p>He felt down the wall until his hand touched a lantern. That he took off
  its peg, raised the chimney, and lighted the wick. Even then he was so uneasy
  that he made a long stride back from the light.</p>

  <p>What he saw first was the shining white surface of the pine table on which
  he had placed the lantern. Next he was aware of the crazy little cast-iron
  stove, in the corner, with a rusted length of stovepipe rising above it
  through the roof. There were old traps piled in several places. There were
  battered clothes hanging along the wall. A saddle hung from a peg, a pack
  saddle from another. And on a bunk in a corner of the room was a man
  stretched out with a blanket pulled over his head, sleeping so hard,
  apparently, that even the noise of the lighting of the lantern had not
  wakened him.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" called Silver.</p>

  <p>Then an icy finger ran down his spine.</p>

  <p>He stepped to the bunk and gradually drew the blanket away from an
  unshaven, shaggy face. The eyes of the man were partially open. There was a
  faint, derisive smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>It seemed, as Silver drew the blanket completely away, that the smile of
  derision was directed toward the sleeper's own body, for the clothes were
  torn to rags on it, the left arm was frightfully gashed at the wrist, and
  there was a powerful tourniquet above the wound.</p>

  <p>The right thigh was badly mangled on the inside of the leg, also, and
  there was another tourniquet above that injury.</p>

  <p>The right hand lay on the chest. Silver touched it, and found it as hard
  and as cold as a stone. This sleeper would never waken again.</p>

  <p>He went back to the table. By the bloodstains he saw how the wounded man
  had slumped across it. A pencil lay on the earthen floor, which was marked by
  the imprint of small heels, like those of the boots of a cowpuncher, far
  different from the big shoes of the dead man. There were two sets of those
  imprints; therefore two men had been there. They had carried the burden to
  the bunk. Yes, for here were the deeper signs to indicate how they had lifted
  and borne the weight. They had stretched him on the bunk and covered his
  face. Then they had gone away. Two men&mdash;Barry Christian and Duff Gregor,
  perhaps. By the sizes of the footmarks, it could hardly have been any others
  who had visited here.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver turned hastily to the door to remount Parade and push ahead
  through the storm. He was about to extinguish the lantern when he thought of
  the dead man again, and paused.</p>

  <p>No matter how keen he was to pursue the trail, he could not leave the body
  to decay, unheeded. It might be years before another traveler penetrated to
  this obscure corner of the mountains.</p>

  <p>He carried the lantern outside. The snow was still falling rapidly, and
  through the dim pencilings that it made in the air, he saw a perfect place
  for a grave, a natural hollow in the side of the slope, with plenty of loose
  rock about it.</p>

  <p>He went back into the cabin, swathed the body in the blanket, and carried
  the rigid form outside. In the hollow he laid it with a decent gravity. He
  picked up a handful of gravel and let it fall gradually on the corpse.</p>

  <p>"Whoever you may be," said Jim Silver, taking his sombrero from his head,
  "good hunting!"</p>

  <p>He began to push in the large rocks. Under a yard of heavy stones he
  buried the stranger. Then he went inside the cabin to put out the lantern and
  leave it. As he put the lantern on the table, however, he noticed a portion
  of a side of bacon hanging in the corner near the stove, tied up by a bit of
  twine, as though to keep it from rats. And the sight of this puzzled him
  greatly. For he had every reason to think that Gregor and Christian were
  hungry travelers. He had pushed them hard. It was long since they had had a
  chance to lay in new supplies of food, and yet they had overlooked this
  invaluable meat! Neither were they fellows who would spare the goods of a
  dead man!</p>

  <p>Deep in thought, he tapped his fingers on the white, shining surface of
  the table. It could not have been his coming that had frightened the pair
  away. They could not have seen him approaching. Something must have drawn
  their minds away from the thought of eating. But what is stronger in the mind
  of a hungry man than the desire for food?</p>

  <p>He considered the red stains on the table, the pencil on the floor. He
  picked it up. It was indelible, with a very hard lead. The table drawer was
  partly ajar, and there was writing paper in it. It seemed plain that the dead
  man had been found slumped forward on the table, writing.</p>

  <p>And that was strangest of all! For why should a man on the verge of death,
  so horribly torn by wolves or dogs, have sat down to spend his last moments
  writing? To a wife? Well, the haggard, savage face of the corpse had not been
  that of a sentimentalist.</p>

  <p>Silver sat down at the table and leaned his own body above the red stains.
  The sensitive tips of his fingers, at the same time, slipped over impressions
  which had been faintly grooved in the soft surface of the wood. He put his
  eye almost on a level with the table top, and now he saw the dim impression
  of writing which had registered through the paper on the tender pine.</p>

  <p>He went to the stove, got a bit of a charred ember of wood, and delicately
  drew it back and forth over the writing, until the depressions stood out as
  lines of white in the midst of the black shading. Letters, words, appeared,
  some dim, but all legible, and the opening phrases were enough to make his
  blood leap:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR ALEC: I'm done for. I got Frosty, and Frosty got
  me.<br>
  <br>
  I've tapped open the biggest vein of gold, to-day, that you ever seen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; ALEC GARY</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was one bit of testimony which was important to Jim
  Silver, and that was an envelope which had been carelessly crumpled in the
  hand and thrown behind the stove. The address on it was "Alexander Gary,
  Newlands." That name, since it was put down in the handwriting that had
  appeared upon the surface of the table, and since the "Dear Alec" of the
  table inscription suited the name on the envelope, convinced Jim Silver that
  he had found the man to whom the dead man had determined to make over the
  claim which he had discovered.</p>

  <p>It left Silver in a quandary.</p>

  <p>He had no doubt, now, that the great Barry Christian and his companion,
  Duff Gregor, were somewhere in the mountains trying to get their
  hands&mdash;or their guns&mdash;on a wolf sufficiently famous to have won a
  nickname among men. And if they succeeded, Christian would find, in a collar
  which had been strangely placed upon the neck of the animal by human hands,
  the secret of the claim's location.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, in the town of Newlands, wherever that might be, was to
  be found the fellow to whom the dying man had willed his discovery.</p>

  <p>The great problem of Silver was to get at Christian. Now he had help on
  the trail, because if he could find Frosty, the wolf, he would probably find
  Barry Christian not far off. The two things worked together. And the only
  complication was the existence of this man Alexander Gary.</p>

  <p>It was no great pinching of the heart of Jim Silver to give up all hope of
  getting any of the gold for himself. It was not the first time that he had
  turned his back on fortune. Neither would it be the last. And besides, he was
  fascinated by the thought of that savage-faced wolf hunter, the dead man, who
  had sent abroad the message of his discovery tied to the neck of a wild wolf,
  and who, with the last of his strength, had striven to send word to this
  Alexander Gary, also.</p>

  <p>That was why Jim Silver left the upper Blue Waters and went to the little
  town of Newlands, on the edge of the range.</p>

  <p>In the town he learned that Alec Gary had an uncle, Bill Gary, who was
  well known as a ruffian and a wolf hunter. Alec Gary had, also, a job on the
  Chester ranch, not far from the town. The postmaster readily told him that,
  and Silver slipped out of the town, unobserved.</p>

  <p>He was lucky in doing so, he felt, for during recent days more and more
  men knew that the rider of a great chestnut stallion might be Jim Silver. And
  when they knew the name, they knew everything else. They knew all the long
  story of his exploits, and that meant public applause, questions, and a
  surrounding atmosphere of awe which always pinched the heart of Silver and
  made him wish, more than ever, for the quiet of the wilderness.</p>

  <p>He used to tell himself, over and over again, that the trail of Barry
  Christian was the last one that he would pursue. Once that was completed, Jim
  Silver would retire forever into the still peace of the mountains and live
  forever alone.</p>

  <p>He thought this more than ever on this day, as he rode out of Newlands
  toward the Chester ranch. He took off his sombrero and let the wind blow
  through his hair. At other times he dared not expose his head, if men were
  around, for fear that even the most casual eye would not fail to notice the
  two tufts of gray hair above his temples, like incipient horns beginning to
  thrust out. They knew his face, too often, as well. His picture had got into
  the newspapers, into the magazines. Some fool had written a life of him and
  told everything wrong, and gilded him brighter than gold. He had managed to
  wade far enough into the reading of that book to be bogged down with the lies
  that were told.</p>

  <p>In fact, he knew that he had become, in spite of himself, a public
  character. His reputation had even ridden farther than Jim Silver himself had
  gone.</p>

  <p>As he came in sight of the Chester ranch house&mdash;a long, low building
  of unpainted boards&mdash;he put the sombrero back on his head, and he was
  glad of a little pool of dust that whirled down on the wind and tarnished the
  brilliance of Parade with gray.</p>

  <p>When he got up to the ranch house, he tethered the horse, went to the
  kitchen door, and rapped.</p>

  <p>The door was jerked open, and a woman with a red, weary face, hot from
  cookery, appeared before him.</p>

  <p>She exclaimed: "Another one of you lazy, worthless rascals that calls
  yourselves cowboys! I'd fire every last one of you off the place, if I had my
  way about it. It's a crying pity, I tell Will Chester, to waste good money on
  the feeding of them that are no better than tramps!"</p>

  <p>Silver had tipped his hat, and now he settled it slowly back on his
  head.</p>

  <p>He would have been glad to do away with the embarrassing notoriety of his
  celebrated name, but he hardly liked being called a tramp.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Chester," he said, "I'm not a tramp."</p>

  <p>She thrust out her big red fist.</p>

  <p>"Lemme see your hand, young man!" she demanded.</p>

  <p>He surrendered his hand, and she rubbed a thumb over the palm of it.</p>

  <p>"Just as I thought!" she shouted. "Soft as the hand of a girl! And yet you
  call yourself a cow-puncher, do you? You got the nerve to stand there and
  call yourself a working man, an honest man?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Silver gently, "a fellow can be honest, even if he doesn't
  punch cows, can't he?"</p>

  <p>"Honest doing what?" exclaimed Mrs. Chester. "Honest, my foot! Honest men
  have calluses on their hands, or else they're living on stolen money, is what
  I say. But fetch your lazy hulk in here and set down at the table, while I
  get you some food. A pity, I say, though, when a woman can't be the boss in
  her own kitchen, but has to foller the crazy ways of her husband. Spendthrift
  is what he is. Spendthrift!"</p>

  <p>"I only want to see a man who's working here," said he. "I'd like to see
  Alec Gary, if you know where he can be found."</p>

  <p>"How would I know where he could be found?" she demanded. "Hurry up and
  come inside before all the flies in the world get into the kitchen. Ain't you
  got no sense at all?"</p>

  <p>He stepped inside, removing his hat.</p>

  <p>"There&mdash;set down at that table," she commanded. "I'll fetch you some
  cold pone and some cold boiled beef, to fill yourself with. There's no
  coffee, this time of day, but tea is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Silver. "I don't need anything to eat. I only want to find
  Alec Gary, if you'll tell me where he's probably working on the ranch."</p>

  <p>"Alec? How would you come to know a good, hard-working, honest boy like
  Alec?" she asked suspiciously. "What you want with him?"</p>

  <p>"His uncle has died," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"A good riddance," answered Mrs. Chester. "The great, hulking, cruel
  brute. There ain't going to be no tears shed about his death. Not in no part
  of the world there ain't!"</p>

  <p>She had stepped back toward the stove, as she said this, and glancing out
  the kitchen window, she saw the great stallion at the hitch rack. The wind
  was blowing through his mane and tail, and his head was high, to look into
  the breeze at that moment. What Mrs. Chester saw made her turn and stare
  again at Silver, and he felt her eyes fix above his upon the telltale patches
  of gray on his temples, the hornlike spots of silver that had given him his
  nickname all through the world.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" said Mrs. Chester. She picked up the skirt of her apron
  and folded her red hands inside it. "Good heavens, what have I been saying?
  Are you Jim Silver?"</p>

  <p>He silently cursed the folly that had induced him to enter the kitchen
  where he had to take off his hat. But now he had to admit: "Yes, that's my
  name. Alec Gary is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's down the creek, mending fence," said she. "Mr. Silver, what'll you
  be thinking about a fool of a woman that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Jim Silver, smiling. "You were perfectly right. I don't know
  how many years have gone by since I've done an honest stroke of work."</p>

  <p>He got out to Parade, escaping from the apologies of Mrs. Chester as well
  as he could, and she remained staring after him, screening her eyes from the
  sun with one hand until he was well down the line of the creek.</p>

  <p>A mile from the ranch house he found a tall cow-puncher toiling over a
  big-handled borer with which he was drilling a series of post holes. His hat
  was off. His curling black hair shuddered in the sunlight with the violence
  of his efforts. It was the perfect picture of a man doing disagreeable work
  with all his might, and striving as hard for wages as though for his own
  interests.</p>

  <p>He looked up as Silver drew near, and Jim Silver was relieved to see a
  fine, open face and an excellently shaped head. He had feared that he would
  look on a type like that dead savage of the mountains, Bill Gary.</p>

  <p>He dismounted, saying: "You're Alec Gary? My name is Silver. I've brought
  you bad news and good news together. The bad part is that your uncle, Bill
  Gary, is dead."</p>

  <p>He waited curiously to see the reaction, and saw the brow of Alec Gary
  pucker.</p>

  <p>"Are you Jim Silver?" asked Gary. "Then," he added, as Silver nodded, "I
  suppose this is one of the first times in your life that you've ever brought
  a man bad news. It is bad news to me. Uncle Bill was a hard man, but he was
  pretty good to me."</p>

  <p>Silver nodded. "I'm glad to hear that," he said. "I'll follow up with the
  good news, if good is what you call it. This is a copy of a letter that he
  wrote as he was dying. The copy runs to the point where he must have stopped
  writing because he died. It was a wolf that killed him. He was badly torn,
  Gary."</p>

  <p>Young Alec Gary took the paper which Silver held out and scanned it
  carefully. He stared up into Silver's face with amazement.</p>

  <p>"A gold mine!" he exclaimed. And for one instant the yellow flame of the
  gold hunger burned wildly in his eyes. Then he groaned. "Inside the collar,
  and on the neck of Frosty! It might as well be tied to the neck of a
  thunderbolt, as far as I'm concerned."</p>

  <p>"Suppose," said Silver, "that we both try our hands on him."</p>

  <p>"You?" said Gary. "Would you help? Why, Mr. Silver, if you will help me,
  of course we'll make an even split on the profits."</p>

  <p>"I get profits of my own," said Silver, "and I can't take a share of
  anything that comes out of this."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Alec Gary, amazed.</p>

  <p>"Because I've made a resolution, long ago, never to handle blood
  money."</p>

  <p>"Blood money? This isn't a price on a man's head."</p>

  <p>"No," said Silver. "It's a price that your uncle has already paid. If the
  mine goes to you, it's all right. If I share in it, the ghost of Bill Gary
  will haunt me. Let's find Chester and ask him if you can cut loose for a few
  weeks. Or maybe it will be months. There is a great deal that we have to talk
  over&mdash;and the first thing is Frosty."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE HUNTER</h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTIAN went to Joe Thurston. It was on record that Joe
  Thurston had killed a running deer at eight hundred yards. There was no doubt
  about the fact, and though a good many of the old-time hunters were likely to
  say that nothing but luck could account for such marksmanship, there were
  others who said that a man like Thurston never had luck. He was simply one of
  the few past masters.</p>

  <p>But Thurston spent most of his time not in hunting with a rifle, but with
  a pack of dogs. To support that pack and to follow it afield, he had allowed
  his big ranch to go to pieces. The one thing that he valued in life, outside
  of an occasional brawl in a saloon, was a chance to see his pack corner a
  wild beast and tear it to pieces, or at least hold it at bay until his rifle
  settled the argument.</p>

  <p>Joe Thurston was himself a wild beast, and perhaps that was why he
  understood the ways of the wilderness so very well. He was a little man, very
  dark, very handsome when he smiled, and very sinister when, in silence, he
  allowed his upper lip to curl a little.</p>

  <p>He sat, on this day, on the back of a young brown gelding which he had
  just finished breaking. Blood was still trickling down the gored sides of the
  horse, and bloodstained, also, the froth that dripped from the wounded mouth
  of the gelding, for Thurston used a cruel spade bit that opened up like a
  sword when the rider jerked on the reins. A horse, for Thurston, was simply a
  machine that got him from one place to another. He despised sentimentality.
  It was not in his nature. He was forty-five. He looked a full ten or even
  fifteen years younger. But as many years as he had gained, his poor wife had
  lost. He looked more like her son than her husband.</p>

  <p>He was overlooking the feeding of his pack. They were fed once a day, in
  the middle of the afternoon, and they got little, from one end of the year to
  the other, except raw meat. If one of them fell sick, it rarely received
  medicine. Either nature cured it, or soon it was brained and its carcass fed
  to the ravenous pack.</p>

  <p>That pack was always ravenous. Joe Thurston knew exactly how the dogs
  should be fed in order to keep them in the pink of condition, thin until they
  were as keen as edged swords for game and food, but not thin enough to be
  weakened.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian and Gregor came up at that moment and waved to the keeper
  of the pack.</p>

  <p>"Are you Joe Thurston?" Christian said.</p>

  <p>Thurston failed to turn his head. His mood was savage that afternoon.
  Ordinarily, he would have given some heed to a pair of big, powerful,
  well-mounted fellows like Christian and Gregor, but on this day he had in
  mind the pressing demands of certain creditors. Already his ranch was heavily
  mortgaged, and now it seemed that it would be wiped out. He cared nothing
  about the loss of land and cattle, but with the other possessions his pack
  would go, also. And that was a knife in his heart.</p>

  <p>"I'm Joe Thurston," he admitted shortly.</p>

  <p>"My name is Barry Christian," said the outlaw.</p>

  <p>"The devil it is," answered Thurston.</p>

  <p>"And this is Duff Gregor," said Christian.</p>

  <p>The head of Thurston slowly turned. He looked over the pale, clean lines
  of the face of Christian and at the bright, thoughtful eyes. They were a
  little too bright, in fact. Suddenly Thurston knew that it was Christian,
  indeed. And he could not help smiling. There was so much evil, so much
  violence in his own nature that he suddenly felt something expand and lighten
  in his heart.</p>

  <p>He held out his hand, silently, and took the strong grip of the criminal.
  He shook hands with Duff Gregor, also, and saw that the man was a nonentity
  compared with his more celebrated companion. And yet any one who had dared,
  more than once, to play the role of Jim Silver, was worthy of some
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Want something here?" asked Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Christian, "I want you and your dogs."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" said Thurston.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to hunt wolves," said Christian.</p>

  <p>The door of the house slammed. Christian saw a girl with a face pale as
  stone, and shadowy, great eyes, come out on the back porch and look toward
  him. She turned and re-entered the house again.</p>

  <p>"Inviting me or hiring me?" asked Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Inviting you," said Christian.</p>

  <p>Thurston took a quick breath. Rage had been mounting in his throat,
  tightening like a fist inside his gullet. Now the passion left him.</p>

  <p>"I've hunted wolves before," said he noncommittally. "Where do you want to
  pick them up?"</p>

  <p>"In the Blue Waters, or the foothills near them," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"That's a hard country," said Thurston. "Are you talking about
  Frosty?"</p>

  <p>"That's the only wolf I've ever wanted to catch," said Christian.</p>

  <p>Thurston narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"There's a price on the head of that wolf," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not hunting for the price. That goes to you. Besides, I'll add
  something over and above. A thousand dollars, say."</p>

  <p>"Well?" murmured Thurston, pinching his lips together in a smile. "I
  understand that Jim Silver is down there in the Blue Waters&mdash;doing good
  for humanity again&mdash;hunting for Frosty, the cattle thief."</p>

  <p>"Silver is there," agreed the outlaw. "That's why I want to be there. To
  meet him on his own ground."</p>

  <p>"Haven't there been times," said grim Joe Thurston, "when you weren't so
  glad to meet Jim Silver on any ground?"</p>

  <p>"He's had the upper hand more than once," answered Christian. "But the
  fact is that there isn't room on top of the earth for the two of us. One of
  us has to be buried, and the time has come.</p>

  <p>"He's in the Blue Waters hunting a wolf. Well, I'm going to be there
  hunting a wolf. He has a man with him. I have Gregor. If we happen to meet
  along the trail, it's no business of yours. Gregor and I will have to try to
  tend to that part of the game."</p>

  <p>"I don't follow this," said Thurston. "Unless you mean that it's a
  challenge to Jim Silver&mdash;something to make him come hunting for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You can call it that. If he comes for me, he has to meet me on my own
  ground. And I won't be asleep."</p>

  <p>"It looks to me," said Thurston, "as though there might be something in
  this deal. I'll go one step farther. I'll admit that I need the money. That
  thousand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll pay half of it on the nail the moment we shake hands," said
  Christian, "and the other half the instant that Frosty's dead at my
  feet."</p>

  <p>"What'll you do with him?" asked Thurston curiously.</p>

  <p>"Mount the hide. Send it somewhere to stand behind glass. A proof to
  people that I've beaten Silver at at least one job."</p>

  <p>Thurston actually laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Here's my hand on the deal," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Christian shook the hand. He pulled out a wallet and counted five
  hundred-dollar bills and put them in the fingers of Thurston.</p>

  <p>"That binds the deal," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'll write up the contract," said Thurston.</p>

  <p>"We've shaken hands," said Christian, "and that's enough."</p>

  <p>A dull flush of pleasure worked in the face of Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Besides," exclaimed Christian, in his gentle and persuasive voice, the
  very accent of courtesy, "you can't draw up a contract between yourself and
  Barry Christian. You can't make a contract with an outlawed man. To you, my
  name is simply Wilkins, and this is Murphy." He broke off to add: "I'd like
  to see the pack."</p>

  <p>"Use your eyes," said Thurston, whose own politeness could not last long.
  He waved toward the big pens that contained the dogs.</p>

  <p>"I don't know enough about them to see the whole truth," answered
  Christian.</p>

  <p>Thurston glanced at him with an appreciative flash of the eye.</p>

  <p>"Few men with brains enough to say they don't know," said Thurston. "Come
  along with me."</p>

  <p>He moved down the line of the pens.</p>

  <p>"There's the brains of the pack," he said, pointing to a number of big,
  rangy pointers. "People use 'em to find birds. I use 'em to find coyotes and
  wolves and mountain lions. They've got the best noses in the world. They're
  fast, and they can run all day. I've bred 'em for speed and nose and brain.
  Those pointers would never point a bird in a thousand years, but they'll
  point a wolf. What's more, they'll hold the trail on a wolf. Yes, or a
  mountain lion. Whatever they've been entered on."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with them?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing is perfect."</p>

  <p>Thurston grinned.</p>

  <p>"They're too hot-headed and tender. They want to rush in and get their
  teeth into the game, and the wolves or the big cats open 'em up like fried
  beefsteak."</p>

  <p>He went to another set of pens where were housed some of the biggest
  greyhounds that Christian had ever seen. They moved around with little,
  stilted steps, as though their muscles were sore. They were tucked up into
  bows. Their chests were narrow. The shoulders and thighs were overlaid with
  entangled whipcords.</p>

  <p>"They're the point of the arrow," he said. "They'll run down any wolf that
  ever breathed almost two steps for one. If the pointers get a wolf into open
  sight, this gang will get up in time to mob him and hold him back until the
  heavy artillery gets into action. And here's the heavy artillery."</p>

  <p>He indicated the next pens, where there were dogs built and furred like
  Scottish deerhounds, but enormously bigger. They looked made for speed and
  strength of running, but also there was a terrible promise in the size of the
  muzzles, the fangs, the huge muscles along the jaws.</p>

  <p>"Every one of 'em," said Christian with keen interest, "looks able to do
  for a wolf."</p>

  <p>"Some of 'em could kill a buffalo wolf now and then," agreed Thurston,
  watching the monsters with a hungry eye. "But some wolves are mean devils in
  a fight. No matter what's the breed or the training of a dog, a wolf seems to
  have more biting powers and more fighting brains and tricks. However, I'll
  match two of these dogs against the biggest wolf that ever lived, and three
  of 'em will kill the champion of the wolf world&mdash;even if his name is
  Frosty!"</p>

  <p>He nodded with assurance as he said this, adding, "This breed was started
  by Bill Gary. You may happen to know him since you know Frosty. Frosty was
  what killed Gary, people say. I don't know how the story started. But Gary
  never managed to get out of his own stock what I've done with it. He didn't
  use enough persistence, enough time and money on the job. I don't care where
  the wolf is, I'll catch him with this pack. In open country or foothills it
  will be a joke. In the middle of the mountains I'll catch him or run him to
  earth. Frosty's hide is as good as mounted and behind glass, Christian, this
  very minute!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; FROSTY'S MATE</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE was tall. She was beautiful. She moved with a light and
  delicate grace. There was bright humor and good nature in her eyes. She was
  young. She was gay. She was foolish. And Frosty loved her the moment he set
  eyes on her in the moonlight of that glade.</p>

  <p>Wolf song had been in the air for a long time that night, and there were
  notes in the singing that made Frosty wrinkle his nose and point his head at
  the sky and break that inviolable rule of silence which had been his for a
  year&mdash;since the days of his puppyhood, in fact. Now he opened his
  throat, and his immense bass note went booming through the canyons among the
  softer singing of the wind and the rumble and hollow crashing of cataracts
  which had been newly loosened from the long, white silence of the winter.
  Spring was in the air.</p>

  <p>Frosty had not seen enough springs to know what it was that worked like
  electric fire through his blood. But it was a thing that called him in hot
  haste to that mountain gorge where five big wolves moved slowly around this
  cream of wolf beauty, this sleek, well-furred lady of the hills.</p>

  <p>Frosty came swiftly. He fell in love while he was still on the run,
  literally, and so he continued his charge. He did not even pause to touch
  noses with the lady and inquire after her health and happiness. He simply ran
  berserk among those wolves.</p>

  <p>In fact, Frosty had been laid up all this time in order to be healed of
  the wounds that he had received while he was in the jaws of the trap. He was
  now completely recovered, and the thick fur had closed well over the scars.
  But he was hungry. He had been living on rabbits he had managed to surprise,
  on unwary squirrels, on mice above all. He was hungry, too, for a dash of
  excitement. And five wolves looked just about the right number to give him a
  good fight, he felt.</p>

  <p>He gave one such a tremendous shoulder wallop that the big lobo rolled a
  dozen yards away and let out the yell of fear and of defeat. He dived
  straight on under the throat of another and slashed him deeply across the
  breast. He nearly ripped the hamstring out of the next, and laid open the
  head of the fourth hero from eye to muzzle. The fifth timber wolf had seen
  enough, and took to his heels. The others followed as fast as they could,
  while Frosty, laughing his wide, red laughter, lay down and licked the blood
  from his white vest, and from his forelegs and forepaws. He was a very dainty
  and clean-living fellow, was Frosty.</p>

  <p>The pleasure of that brief skirmish had not yet rollicked out of his heart
  when he saw that the lady of his dreams was sitting on a hummock with her
  beautiful long, bushy tail curled around her forepaws. The moment he glanced
  at her she rose, turned, and fled.</p>

  <p>He followed.</p>

  <p>She was as fast as a deer, and she went down the wind as though the devil
  of wolves were after her. But, fast as she was, he was a little bit
  faster.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she whirled, her mane bristling, her ears twitched back, her eyes
  green with hatred, her fangs bared.</p>

  <p>Frosty walked right up to that dreadful mask of hatred and sniffed at her
  nose. And then, suddenly, they stood back from one another and laughed two
  red laughters, set off with teeth that glistened just like ice.</p>

  <p>There are no tears at the wedding ceremony of a wolf. They seem to have a
  saving sense of humor, and so there was only a great deal of that silent
  laughter at the marriage of Frosty under the spring moon.</p>

  <p>Kind Mother Nature had brought to him a proper mate, and he could have
  looked his life long among the ladies of his kind before he would have found
  one more handsome, more discreet, more prepared to learn the wisdom of
  hunting laws and ways.</p>

  <p>She had been well raised, as wolf rearing goes. She was not the least bit
  of a fool, and she knew as well as a Greek philosopher that the track of
  grizzly is not one to follow, and that foxes are too swift to be caught, and
  that their wits are even sharper than their teeth. She knew that mountain
  sheep are better avoided than troubled, and that small pickings will
  eventually make a full belly.</p>

  <p>She knew the rain signs and the wind signs that the god of wolves hangs in
  the midnight blue of the sky, and she could read like type the scents that
  travel on the breeze. But in all the bright days of her life she never had
  tasted either beef or horse, and sheep were unknown to her except when the
  well-guarded flocks went by at a distance, always accompanied by the
  distressing scent of man, the great enemy, and gunpowder and steel.</p>

  <p>When Frosty discovered that she was afraid of going out of the highlands
  into the hills, he sat down and looked her in the face. Then he stood up and
  jogged quietly on his way along the down trail.</p>

  <p>She turned and went the other way, until she found out that he would no
  longer follow. Then she whined like a dog for him, and afterward she sang a
  mournful tune. Last of all, she got to her feet and raced like the wind to
  catch up with him, picking his scent off the ground and then out of the air
  until she was at his side once more.</p>

  <p>He merely turned his head a little and admitted that he was aware of her
  coming. For he had a very good domestic and political head, did Frosty, and
  he knew as well as any wolf in the world how to be the head of a family.</p>

  <p>So they came out into the foothills, and Frosty headed straight for the
  biggest, the choicest, of all of his preserves. It was a ranch where there
  were cattle and sheep; where there were plenty of pigs and chickens, and a
  creamery, and poultry, including ducks and turkeys and geese, and there were
  rabbits, white and brown, and there were goats and beef cattle big and small,
  and horses, and mules, and nearly every sort of four-footed beast that one
  could imagine on a big Western ranch.</p>

  <p>It was the Truman place, with an almost national reputation behind it. But
  Frosty, in a sense, knew that place better than even its wise-headed owner.
  He had tasted of every sort of meat that his unwilling host could provide,
  and his track was so well-known that drawings and photographs and
  measurements of the tracks of Frosty were to be found in the study of John
  Truman. That was not all. Mrs. Truman was a very clever artist with her
  pencil, and several times she had seen the terrible Frosty&mdash;by
  starlight, by moonlight, in the dusk, and in the crystal pink of the early
  morning light. So she had done a number of pictures of the monster, and, in
  fact, Frosty was a major item of conversation in the Truman household.</p>

  <p>It was not accident that when Frosty came out of the mountains to dine in
  high estate, his mate beside him, he should have traveled straight toward the
  greatest of danger. It was not accident, because something far from chance
  had brought Barry Christian and Duff Gregor and the famous pack of the
  Thurston dogs to the ranch of Truman.</p>

  <p>It was known that Truman would do almost anything in the world to get rid
  of the cunning marauder. There was some risk that he might recognize
  Christian, but, as a matter of fact, he proved to be blind to everything
  except the manifest excellence of the dog pack of Joe Thurston. He was glad
  to house that pack and feed it gratis, and he hoped that Thurston would
  continue to stay at his house, even for a year and a day, and enjoy free
  board for his pack, so long as the chief business of that pack continued to
  be the hunting of Frosty.</p>

  <p>They sat in the house, the four of them, and looked at the photographs of
  the sign of Frosty, and admired the clever drawings which Mrs. Truman had
  made of the devastator himself. And while they were laying their plans and
  deciding in what direction they had better cast through the hills and into
  the mountains in the hope of finding the trail of the great wolf, Frosty in
  person was sliding through the fence of the southeastern section and heading
  straight toward the house, followed by his frightened mate.</p>

  <p>She was, in fact, fairly blind with fear.</p>

  <p>But she was also hungry, and when she came to a fresh-killed carcass she
  said:</p>

  <p>"That meat is new and good. And I have an empty stomach."</p>

  <p>Frosty shuddered till his mane stood up on end.</p>

  <p>Dead meat? Eat dead meat? Not since he was a puppy&mdash;not since he had
  become a wolf of the world and had learned how to set his own table
  properly.</p>

  <p>But he decided to give her a lesson. So he took her right up into the wind
  toward the new kill, and then lay down and bade her study the scents.</p>

  <p>A pair of coyotes, frightened from the feast, fled far away. But Frosty
  paid no heed to them.</p>

  <p>"Death is not a nothing," he said. "There is always a reason. Sometimes it
  is the odor of gunpowder and the steel of man. Sometimes the teeth of other
  hunters have done the work. And sometimes it is the work of poison such as I
  have seen kill big wolves, and wise and strong wolves. A small tooth will
  kill the biggest wolf in the world if it strikes him in the right place.
  Poison is such a strong tooth as that. It cannot be seen. But it can be
  tasted, and, above all, it can be smelled.</p>

  <p>"Now hold your head straight up and sniff the air&mdash;smell the fresh
  blood from where the coyotes have been feeding. And in that you find an acrid
  taint. That is poison. It will kill those coyotes. It will surely kill them.
  I have seen a mountain lion in such an agony that it leaped at the grizzly of
  Thunder Mountain in the middle of its fit from the poison. And the grizzly,
  of course, smashed the head of that big cat with one stroke of his paw.</p>

  <p>"Now, to prove that I know of what I speak, come with me and you shall see
  a thing."</p>

  <p>He took her around the carcass of the dead calf and across the big field
  to the edge of a dry draw. Rapid, light feet scampered away from a place
  where the stars fell bright and small in a little water hole.</p>

  <p>"After poison, hunters drink," said Frosty. "Now watch!"</p>

  <p>The two coyotes had climbed to the farther side of the draw when one of
  them stopped, whirled suddenly, and snapped at the empty air. The wolves
  could hear the teeth clash like steel against steel. The other coyote drew
  back and sat down to watch.</p>

  <p>"Poison!" said Frosty. "And now he is fighting an enemy that he cannot
  see. Look!"</p>

  <p>The coyote had leaped up into the air, and, falling again, it twisted into
  a frightful convulsion. Its mate, a moment later, was caught by the same
  fits. In the fury of their silent agonies, it seemed as though they were
  fighting one another in the midst of the thin cloud of dust that they
  raised.</p>

  <p>Then the two were still. One lay perfectly still on its side. The other
  was braced up on its forelegs, but the hindquarters trailed on the ground as
  though paralyzed.</p>

  <p>And as a small breeze moved the air, the two wolves found in it again the
  strange, the indescribable scent of the invisible death. Frosty's mate shrank
  suddenly against his side, and she snarled:</p>

  <p>"Let us go! Quickly! Quickly! Every wise wolf knows that men are
  dangerous, and that they can bite from far away. Let us go. I had rather have
  a few field mice in peace of mind than all the beef banquets of this world of
  men."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE KILL</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS very good reasoning that the lady had applied to that
  question, but Frosty only laughed his red laughter. He looked at the beauty
  of his mate and remembered her speed of foot and all the cleverness that she
  had showed along the trail, and he felt a great happiness, because he knew
  that he was going to have a proper audience to appreciate his efforts.</p>

  <p>He said to her: "Men have their own keen ways. So have mice and squirrels,
  for that matter. And so has Frosty. Come with me!"</p>

  <p>The scent of the poison and the sight of what it could accomplish had made
  her almost sick with fear, but she followed Frosty slowly across the fields,
  and then he showed her some good hunting.</p>

  <p>The wind came always in puffs, slowly and gently, the very best sort of a
  wind for the carrying of scents of every kind, and, getting to the right
  quarter of the compass, Frosty worked up that wind to the edge of a big field
  where a great mound of something living slept upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"Beef?" said his mate.</p>

  <p>"Ours!" said Frosty, and since the wires of that fence were strung close
  together and wickedly barbed, he leaped lightly and trotted on.</p>

  <p>Over his shoulder he saw her slenderer body follow, arching against the
  stars, and he was immensely pleased to see this blind faith in her. But he
  paused to give her a caution.</p>

  <p>"This is a trick," said Frosty, "which I have learned. But it has cost a
  good many other wolves their lives. It is all a matter of foot and eye and
  tooth and quick thinking. I have seen three wolves gored to death in this
  game&mdash;yes, and each time they were hunting in packs. Perhaps they were a
  little too hungry to have clear wits. Sit down and watch me work. That is a
  bull yonder, and a bull fights to the last gasp. One thing is to make the
  kill swiftly, because a bull roars as he fights. And then men come on
  horses!"</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" shuddered his mate. "The wind changes, and I smell dogs and the
  scent of many men."</p>

  <p>"There are always dogs about this place," said Frosty carelessly. "The
  trouble with dogs is that when they can run fast enough to catch you, they
  have no jaw muscles for biting. And when they are big enough to take a grip,
  they are too clumsy to put a tooth on a wolf that has his wits about him.
  Besides, the fools are easily made to change their minds."</p>

  <p>He thought, as he said that, of the two great dogs of the trapper that had
  not been made to change their minds till they were dead. And back in his mind
  there was the memory of a certain great mastiff that, in the midst of a mob
  scene, had once managed to lay its deadly grip on Frosty. The pain of the
  wound ached right up into the back of his mind as he recalled it.</p>

  <p>His mate obediently sat down. He could see the stars in her bright eyes,
  and it made him laugh to observe her fear. However, she said nothing. Only
  the fur of her mane lifted as she saw him actually turn toward that monstrous
  antagonist.</p>

  <p>He went up softly toward that mountain of dangerous flesh. There had been
  a night when he had slit the throat of a sleeping steer just as it tossed up
  its head. Perhaps he would have equal luck on this occasion and make the
  battle end in blessed silence. However, he was not surprised when the big
  brute lurched suddenly from the ground, rear end first, and swung to face
  him. For a range bull is only a shade less wary than any meat eater, and
  fully as savage.</p>

  <p>This was the hardy veteran of a score of battles with his kind, a true
  champion of the range. He got the wind of Frosty, came to his feet like a
  wild cat, and charged without even waiting to bellow.</p>

  <p>He missed Frosty.</p>

  <p>The she-wolf did not rise from her haunches. She remained in the near
  distance, lolling her tongue, apparently indifferent. In reality, she was
  taking stock of her mate's talent as a provider. She saw Frosty avoid that
  thrusting of sharp horns, swing to the side, and sway back again to get
  behind the monster.</p>

  <p>But the bull was wary, and spun about in time.</p>

  <p>He put down his head and pawed the earth, preparing to bellow. Frosty made
  a bluff of charging straight at the head and lowered horns. It was a very
  good bluff. It looked to the watcher as though her mate were hurling himself
  right on those terrible, curved spear points. The bull took three little
  running steps to meet the shock&mdash;and Frosty floated away to the side,
  slid like a ghost under the belly of the bull, and danced away on the farther
  side.</p>

  <p>The bull whirled again. Muttering thunder was forming in his throat. The
  she-wolf heard it, and she smelled fresh blood&mdash;beef blood. She could
  even hear it trickling to the ground, splashing in a pool. Frosty had used
  his teeth in that last maneuver.</p>

  <p>He was ready to use them again. He went in at that huge bull like a snipe
  flying against the wind. The bull backed, checked, charged furiously. In the
  dullness of the starlight high overhead, the she-wolf saw the clots of turf
  flying. The ground trembled with the beating of the hoofs.</p>

  <p>The horns missed Frosty by a margin so slight that the bull paused to hook
  two or three times at the spot in the air where the gray wolf had seemed to
  be. Then he jerked up his head with an almost human groan of pain, for
  Frosty, twisting about to the rear, had chopped right through the great
  tendon over the hock as cleanly as a butcher could have done with a sharp
  cleaver.</p>

  <p>The bull started to spin, but it was hard to maneuver rapidly on only one
  rear leg, and the she-wolf heard the dull, chopping sound as the great fangs
  of Frosty struck through the tendon of the other leg.</p>

  <p>The bull dropped to his hind quarters, still formidable, for with the sway
  of his monstrous horns he could guard his flanks; in the meantime, out of his
  throat rolled a thundering call of rage, and appeal, and helplessness.</p>

  <p>Frosty sat down five yards away to laugh, as though he enjoyed that music,
  but in the middle of the lowing he flashed off his feet and dipped right in
  under the stretched-out throat of the bull. He cut that throat wide open
  across the tender narrows just beneath the jaws. The bull, trying to bellow
  again, only belched forth a vast stream of blood.</p>

  <p>Frosty went back and stood beside his mate, panting:</p>

  <p>"That was easy. You see how it's done. Just a little matter of foot and
  eye and tooth."</p>

  <p>She put her shoulder against him and shuddered. And the heart of Frosty
  grew great. He suddenly felt as though he would rejoice in a chance to bring
  red meat home to a wife and cubs. Yes, to dozens of them!</p>

  <p>The bull, slumping suddenly forward, struck the earth in a loose, dead
  bulk. Now he was still, and the banquet table was spread!</p>

  <p>The she-wolf delayed only to see her mate put tooth to the hide. Then she
  was instantly at work.</p>

  <p>Frosty was hungry; he was very hungry. It was a long time since he had had
  a chance to enjoy the sort of diet that he relished most, but all of his
  hunger and all this delicious smell of fresh blood could not hide in his mind
  the knowledge that he was dining on the very verge of destruction. So, while
  his wife tore-out great gobbets and whole pounds of tender flesh, Frosty ate
  more daintily, more delicately.</p>

  <p>Now and again he would lift his great, wise young head and survey the
  country around him, and the obscure line where the starlit sky met the
  thicker night of the earth. It took eyes and some knowing to observe the
  movement of forms at a distance against such a background. But, when danger
  threatened a moment later, it took nothing but ears and nose to
  understand.</p>

  <p>It was the scent of man and dogs in the distance, and the sound of a man
  calling, and the answering high yip-yipping of the dogs.</p>

  <p>Inside the house of Truman they had been talking late, smoking, telling
  old tales of hunting, listening to Thurston's description of some of the
  great runs the pack had made; and then, out of the distance, they heard the
  booming, thundering call of the bull.</p>

  <p>Truman got out of this chair at once, crossed the room, and opened a
  window wide. He leaned into the night and listened. The bellowing of the bull
  was cut off short. In the middle of the great, angry lament the thunder
  ended.</p>

  <p>Truman turned back to the others.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong," he said. "That's a mighty expensive bull I've
  got out yonder, and I don't like the way he cut off that bellow, as though
  somebody had just laid a whip on him!"</p>

  <p>Christian said: "Maybe it's Frosty come down to dine."</p>

  <p>Truman shook his head. "It won't be Frosty," he said. "Frosty wouldn't
  waste as much effort as that killing old beef when there's so much young
  stuff scattered around the place. He'd rather have veal than beef. I know his
  tastes."</p>

  <p>He leaned out through the window again, shaking his head, very
  worried.</p>

  <p>Thurston stood up and said:</p>

  <p>"I'll take a walk with a few of my dogs and see what I can turn up."</p>

  <p>"No good doing that," answered Truman. "No good trying to run that devil
  of a wolf in the dark of the moon, and he very well knows it."</p>

  <p>Thurston turned and smiled. It was not a real smile, but merely a baring
  of the teeth.</p>

  <p>"You're rather proud of what your Blue Waters wolf can do, Truman," he
  said, "but I'll tell you this: My pack will find in the dark and it will run
  in the dark, and it will kill in the dark, too. If friend Frosty is anywhere
  around, he's a dead wolf before morning."</p>

  <p>With that Joe Thurston walked out of the house and got his selection from
  the dogs. He simply took a pair of pointers so perfectly trained that they
  would obey gestures as far as the wave of the hand could be seen. Whistles
  could give them further orders.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian walked out with Thurston and the dogs into the field, and
  saw, almost at once, the outline of the bulk of the bull, prostrate. Asleep,
  perhaps, as Barry Christian thought. But then the dogs, scouting close to the
  bull, failed to rouse it to its feet, which was strange, and a moment later
  the pointers were kiting across the field and giving trouble.</p>

  <p>"Wolves, by thunder!" shouted Thurston.</p>

  <p>His whistle shrilled into the night to call back the pointers before they
  ran themselves into hopeless trouble.</p>

  <p>"Come back to the house!" he shouted to Christian. "We'll saddle up and
  hit the trail."</p>

  <p>Christian had lighted a match close to the bull. He saw the terribly torn
  throat; he saw a big patch of blood, and in the softness of the ground that
  was outlined, the huge print of a wolf's foot, a print so big that it started
  his heart racing.</p>

  <p>"Thurston!" he cried. "We've got on his trail at last. It's Frosty, or his
  twin!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE CHASE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Frosty heard the outbreak of the dogs and the voice of
  the man, he had to snap his big teeth close to the head of his mate before
  she would leave off her greedy feeding and lift her red, dripping muzzle.</p>

  <p>"A full stomach makes a slow foot," he told her. "Come! Let us go!"</p>

  <p>She was reluctant. He urged her with the powerful thrust of his shoulder,
  and at last she slunk away, regretfully, slackening her pace every now and
  then. He studied her with a critical eye. She had eaten like fire. Already
  she was logey with food. She ran with her head down, and her tail down, also.
  She kept coughing, and she stumbled over small obstacles.</p>

  <p>Behind them the noise of the dogs and the man ceased. Then it came once
  more, and a pair of dogs rushed straight at Frosty through the starlight. He
  turned back to get ready for them, merely saying to his mate:</p>

  <p>"Guard my heels and I'll take them. Guard my back and I'll handle
  them."</p>

  <p>No matter how unfit she might be for battle, she fell in behind him and
  faced to guard his back. But the two big dogs that came glimmering out of the
  starlight veered off to this side and that. They retreated to a little
  distance and howled.</p>

  <p>Both Frosty and his mate charged the pair. The pointers turned and fled
  faster than the wolves could follow. For a timber wolf is not very fleet of
  foot. He is made for endurance and the shock of hard fighting, not for
  flight, like the fox or the coyote. Only in the rough country of the uplands
  will a timber wolf pull away from a pack of dogs. The she-wolf managed to
  slash the hip of one of the dogs; that was all.</p>

  <p>Then she turned with Frosty and started to race off at full speed. He
  calmed her and made her come back to a dogtrot. For it was plain that she
  could not stand the test of a hard run at once. Frosty himself was not
  exactly comfortable, for there was a considerable burden of meat inside him,
  and yet he had eaten nothing in comparison with his companion. Her sides
  thrust out with her meal. Her panting was a painful thing to hear.</p>

  <p>It was better to go on rather slowly, always in the direction of the
  higher foothills and the mountains beyond them.</p>

  <p>"We are safe, anyway," said the she-wolf. "We are safe, because there are
  only two dogs, and they can do us no harm. I laughed to see how they
  ran."</p>

  <p>"There is the scent of man in the air, and you know that always means
  danger."</p>

  <p>"It is from the collar that you wear, like a dog, around your neck," said
  his mate, sniffing at the linked steel.</p>

  <p>He tossed his head, and the collar slid a little upward through his fur.
  Already he had some cause to be grateful for the protection it had given to
  him, for in the battle that won him his mate, the second big wolf had struck
  for the throat of Frosty, and merely snapped a fang short off on the metal
  that ran around his throat. For all that, it was a hateful thing, because it
  continually reminded him of the most dreadful moment of his life.</p>

  <p>Still, he could not conceive what had happened after the blow that bad
  knocked him senseless. During the interval, in the darkness of his mind, the
  steel teeth of the trap had been removed from his hind leg and the steel
  bondage of the collar had been placed around his neck. The man had withdrawn
  and sat against a tree, bleeding. And he, Frosty, had been free to
  escape.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he felt as though that collar were man's claim upon him, a
  detached hand that had him by the throat, and by which he might be one day
  throttled, as he had seen a brute of a wolf trapper once throttle a litter of
  helpless young puppies at the mouth of a cave. Or perhaps a mysterious agency
  was attracted to the steel and would one day draw him back to mysterious
  man.</p>

  <p>They got out of the low, rolling ground and climbed to the top of the
  first steep rise, where the she-wolf flung herself down on the ground
  suddenly. She was sick, and she could hardly travel farther.</p>

  <p>"Only," she gasped, "only a fool runs from a memory. Only a fool runs from
  a shadow."</p>

  <p>Frosty looked down at her heaving sides. Then he scanned the dark shadow
  of the lower ground beneath him. It might be, in fact, that no more danger
  was coming toward them, though in that case it was very strange that the two
  dogs, alone, dared to remain so close. Here they were again, glimmering
  shapes in the starlight, and pausing at a little distance, they sat down to
  howl at the enemy. The lips of Frosty twitched as he considered the keen edge
  of his teeth and the softness of their throats, but he was not a witless one
  to try to catch four faster feet than his own.</p>

  <p>Then out of the distance he heard a deadly chorus. There were more voices
  like those of the pointers. He could hear the keen yelping of the greyhounds,
  thin and far away, and, above all, the harsh cries of dogs whose voices were
  exactly like those of the ugly pair of monsters that had fallen upon him when
  he was in the trap.</p>

  <p>There were more than a score of throats giving music to that chorus. The
  heart of Frosty suddenly grew small in him. He stood over his mate and said
  to her:</p>

  <p>"Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"It is far away," she panted huskily.</p>

  <p>"It is pointing toward us, and the yelling of these two dogs holds the
  light on us like a shaft of sunshine, and guides the others. They are coming
  rapidly. Up, up! Away with me!"</p>

  <p>She rose with a lurch so slow and so heavy that the heart of Frosty failed
  in him again. Certainly she was hard spent, and yet the worst of the run
  might remain all ahead of them. In this condition he dared not lead her at a
  rapid pace. He could merely pick rough going, always, so that their trail
  would furnish as much difficulty as possible to the dogs in the distance.</p>

  <p>But what great difference did the trailing make when the two pointers,
  always near by, guided their companions out of the night with their
  outcry?</p>

  <p>Moreover, the gray of the morning began now, streaking around the rim of
  the horizon and making the mountains stand up black and huge against the
  eastern sky.</p>

  <p>With terrible speed the clamor from the rear rolled up on them. He saw his
  mate swing her head in impatient fear from side to side, hunting some
  escape.</p>

  <p>"We must hide! We must hide!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"They have noses that will find us," said Frosty.</p>

  <p>"Then we can fight them away from some narrow place," said the
  she-wolf.</p>

  <p>"Man kills from afar," said Frosty.</p>

  <p>"Run far ahead then," she said. "Let me stay here behind. I am sick. My
  knees are weak, and my hocks will not bear me up. Run ahead, and I shall
  handle myself."</p>

  <p>He fell in behind her and nipped at her heels.</p>

  <p>"Little fool!" said Frosty, and drove her relentlessly before him up the
  way.</p>

  <p>The wind brought to them the smell of a barnyard, of man, and the thin,
  distant clamor of more dogs. The she-wolf would have swerved to the side, but
  Frosty drove her straight ahead.</p>

  <p>Of ordinary dogs he had no heed whatever. But those keen yelpings of the
  greyhounds from the rear he understood. Even the antelope could hardly run
  faster than those lean beasts. He had seen them overtake and kill the
  wing-footed rabbits. And once they came in sight of their target, nothing
  could keep them from overtaking a pair of wolves, particularly wolves running
  in the open.</p>

  <p>Worst of all, there was the harsh calling of greater throats, giving forth
  notes like those of the two monsters which had come before Bill Gary to the
  traps.</p>

  <p>Frosty felt cornered, though still at a distance. The steel hand of man
  was surely closing about his throat. And it seemed to Frosty that the collar
  was shrinking, shutting off his breath.</p>

  <p>He paid no heed, therefore, to the smell of the barnyard and the scent of
  man and the yelping of other dogs. He even welcomed the thing and drove his
  unwilling mate before him straight down into a hollow where stood the long,
  squat shadow of a ranch house and the larger mass of a barn behind it.</p>

  <p>"There will be confusion down there," he told her. "Geese will cackle, and
  hens and ducks. Dogs will howl. The scents of a hundred cattle will cross our
  trail. Perhaps we shall be able to sneak away to safety across the dangerous
  ground."</p>

  <p>But he had no very great hope of that. He only knew that he would be safe
  if he took to his heels and left his mate behind him to be torn by the teeth
  of the pack.</p>

  <p>He could not do that. The power of instinct checked and held him
  powerfully to her. He was not one to change his mind when danger
  threatened.</p>

  <p>So they came down into the hollow, and as they reached the damper, colder
  air below, they heard the forefront of the dog pack break over the hill
  behind them&mdash;the pointers first, and then the greyhounds on the leash,
  and then the fighting heavy artillery of the crew. Worst of all, there were
  beating hoofs of horses, and the calling of men to one another. And always
  the cursed daylight brightened around the rim of the wide horizon.</p>

  <p>He saw the entangled mazes of corral fencing behind him. He turned, and,
  with a determined charge, drove the two pointers who were closest far away
  from him. They yielded ground readily, as always. While they lingered in the
  distance, he whirled about and leaped the nearest fence. His mate had already
  crawled under the lowest wire, and was disappearing around the corner of a
  great stack of hay that stood in the middle of the inclosure.</p>

  <p>A little yellow dog came scooting toward him, yapping at the top of its
  lungs, splitting the night with its sharp ki-yiing. He swerved toward it. The
  house dog, terrified by the size and the imminence of that danger, dropped
  flat on the ground.</p>

  <p>One stroke of his teeth and Frosty would leave it with a smashed back,
  dead. But he disdained an enemy of such proportions, and hurried on as fast
  as he could leg it, until, turning the corner of the haystack, he was amazed
  to find that there was no sight of his mate before him!</p>

  <p>No, not although his glance could now extend far across the fields
  brightened with dew.</p>

  <p>He dropped his bewildered head toward the ground and suddenly picked up
  her trail. It turned sharply to the side into one of the hollows that were
  worked under the side of the haystack, where cattle had fed and where
  scratching chickens had widened the entrances. Into one of those her trail
  led, and, crushing far back into the yielding hay, he suddenly found himself
  at her side. He heard her gasping.</p>

  <p>"Go on! Go on! I cannot run another step!"</p>

  <p>Terror made him cold. His body lay still. His heart was still, also. Some
  instinct, from the first, had told him that association with females is
  dangerous. Now he found himself trapped, and the peril of the hunt swarming
  in around him!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; WOLF STRATEGY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE day freshened every moment. As the light grew stronger,
  the intricate entanglement of hay drew yellow bars across his vision.</p>

  <p>"Go on! Go on!" whispered the panting she-wolf. "Don't wait here with me.
  We'll both be lost! We'll both be lost!"</p>

  <p>He swung his head against her.</p>

  <p>"Be still, little fool!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>She was still. He could feel that her stifled breathing was choking her.
  He could feel her shuddering as she strove to control her gasping breath.</p>

  <p>He needed that silence to study the approach of danger. The whole hunt had
  swept down and around the corral. It poured on. He was sure, for a few
  moments, that it was definitely gone, for there was no noise close at hand
  except the shrill screeching of the little yellow dog, which had taken up its
  post directly in front of the hiding place of the two wolves.</p>

  <p>That is what comes of foolish mercy to a treacherous enemy in a time of
  war, thought Frosty, and all his teeth were on edge with anger and
  disgust.</p>

  <p>Then the hunt came back, as though the yelling of the little dog had
  guided it. The doors of the house began to slam, and men carrying the deadly
  odor of gunpowder and steel issued. Their voices were loud. The riders of the
  hunt had returned. The scent of their sweating horses was strong in the
  nostrils of Frosty. The great dogs were roving here and there. Chickens,
  foraging in the early day, fled with scattering outcries from these
  marauders. And always the cursed dogs were giving tongue.</p>

  <p>Had they lost the scent in the entangled mazes of fresh tracks that
  crossed and recrossed the odorous ground of the corral? Well, the yelping of
  the little yellow dog would soon lead them aright.</p>

  <p>Yes, at this very moment there was a howl from a pointer, and then from
  another, right at the entrance to the lurking place of the wolves.</p>

  <p>Frosty nudged his mate with the shrug of a shoulder. This was the time. By
  the tightening of his muscles she could be able to judge that a sudden face
  attack was what he had in mind, and he could feel her muscles tightening,
  also. There was good stuff in her. She was not one to shrink from her duty in
  a great pinch like this.</p>

  <p>Now came the great voices which Frosty had feared most of all, and waited
  for&mdash;the heavy artillery of the Thurston pack, which was sweeping toward
  the haystack.</p>

  <p>Frosty came out of the hay with a bound. A big pointer, right in front of
  him, received a slash that opened his shoulder like a knife stroke. That dog
  would run no more on this day.</p>

  <p>The dazzled eyes of Frosty saw men on horseback outside the corral fence.
  He saw, closer in, greyhounds running, and big, grizzled monsters, covered
  with mouse-colored, curling tufts of hair exactly like the two dogs of Bill
  Gary, but even larger, if anything.</p>

  <p>The men yelled. The dogs gave tongue all in one voice. And the wretched
  little yellow dog that had caused all this crisis of danger fled screaming
  out of the path.</p>

  <p>That talkative busybody, the squirrel, betrays many a hiding animal in the
  heart of the woods. Frosty thought of that as he swerved around the corner of
  the haystack as fast as he could possibly leg it.</p>

  <p>Behind him his fleet-footed mate was racing. The fluff of his tail must be
  beside her head. And Frosty turned the next corner, and the next of the
  stack, and bolted straight back across the corral.</p>

  <p>He had simply doubled the stack, and was running, now, right on toward the
  spot where he had seen the horsemen, because he had judged that they would
  get into motion in another direction.</p>

  <p>He was right. They had scattered to this side and to that, and the whole
  stream of dogs was in movement out of sight, around the big stack of hay, as
  Frosty and his mate streaked back across the corral and leaped the fence.</p>

  <p>A little wilderness of labyrinthine barbed wire crossed and crisscrossed
  before them, bright with newness and the morning light here, and red with
  rust there. And Frosty held straight on through the midst of that wire. The
  strands which were farthest apart he dived between. The lower fences he
  jumped. He knew of old that ridden horses will not follow across barbed wire,
  even where it is stretched low along the posts.</p>

  <p>Off to the side he saw a little boy and two women at the back of the
  house, throwing up their hands, yelling in shrill voices. They were not to be
  considered, however, because no smell of gunpowder and steel came from
  them.</p>

  <p>In fact, Frosty gained so much by his doubling maneuver that he was
  actually well beyond the entanglements of the corral fencing before the head
  of the dog pack got wind and sight of him and lurched in pursuit. The
  horsemen were coming, too, scattering off to the side to avoid the fences.
  Rifles began to clang as Frosty shifted into a scattering of brush that
  worked up a steep hillside. And through that brush the two wolves dodged to
  the head of the hill.</p>

  <p>Frosty glanced at his mate, and saw that she was not scathed. Her eyes
  were red with labor and with terror. They were blank. She was incapable of
  using, now, the excellent brain which the god of wolves had put into her
  head. All that she could do was to follow blindly where her great mate led
  her.</p>

  <p>Her heavy meal of meat still weighted her down, but she was in her second
  wind. And before them stretched the ragged sea of the mountain uplands which
  Frosty knew so by heart, every corner, every hole, every den, every patch of
  brush.</p>

  <p>He realized, by the first glimmering of hope, how utterly he had been lost
  in despair.</p>

  <p>He knew the best way to head now. Just off to the right there was a canyon
  which a small stream of water had drilled and grooved and polished through
  the rising mountains. If they could get into that ravine they could shift
  from one side of the narrow water to the other, and so delay the dogs which
  ran so well by scent. And presently a horde of little branching canyons
  opened to the right and to the left. Up one of them they could flee and
  perhaps gain safety.</p>

  <p>It only needed that they should first make the long pull of the upgrade
  that would bring them to the edge of the canyon wall.</p>

  <p>He knew the best way, and he showed it to his mate now. There is nothing
  so killing as an upslope, but wolves handle such labor better than dogs,
  almost always. He felt that for the moment only man was to be feared, because
  the light of the day was bright now, and man could use that light to kill
  from afar with the barking voice of a trusty rifle.</p>

  <p>So Frosty legged it up the slope, cut suddenly to the right, and found
  himself running on an old Indian trail up the side of the valley. Sometimes
  that trail was ten feet wide. Sometimes it narrowed to three. Would the
  riders dare to follow on their horses? Or would they give up the hunt and
  leave it to the dogs to finish the day's work?</p>

  <p>The trail rose in a straight line, hugging the great rocky wall of the
  ravine. From the outer edge of the ancient road the cliff dropped again
  hundreds of feet to where the little river widened into pools or narrowed
  again into arrow-straight white rushings of water. It was still a good mile,
  a long mile, to the place where the trail dipped downward and slipped onto
  the level floor of the narrow valley. It was still a mile from the broken bad
  lands where Frosty and his mate could begin to have hope indeed.</p>

  <p>And before that mile was over, Frosty knew that he would have to turn and
  fight.</p>

  <p>The pointers had fallen well behind now. They had not the legs to keep up
  with the arrowy flight of the greyhounds, and next to the greyhounds came the
  great fighting dogs of the breed of Bill Gary. The riders were also there, in
  the distance, driving their horses up the narrow, slippery, dangerous ledge
  with a remorseless courage. But they could not keep up with the dogs on such
  a grade as this. Therefore they lost ground at every turn. Only twice did
  they have a clear view of the fugitives and fill the air with whining bits of
  lead that made Frosty shift and dodge from side to side.</p>

  <p>But the she-wolf was almost spent. Her effort to maintain a gallop sent
  the loose hide and ruff of her mane swaying forward above her shoulders. Her
  head was down. Her long red tongue almost brushed the rocks. She ran with a
  telltale swerving as Frosty suddenly checked, with a snarl that told her to
  run on.</p>

  <p>She went on, but only at a dragging trot. And he, looking after her,
  realized that it was all the speed she could possibly get out of her
  exhausted body.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to face the danger.</p>

  <p>He was in a narrow spot in the trail where it was scarcely a stride broad.
  Two dogs could come at him at once over this footing. Here they
  came&mdash;the two leading greyhounds, running as evenly as though on a
  double leash&mdash;magnificent thoroughbreds, the pick of the dog pack of Joe
  Thurston. The length of the race had put them where they belonged&mdash;in
  front. Now, very gamely, they bared their teeth and rushed in on the wolf. If
  they could get a toothhold for even a moment, the big fighters of the Gary
  breed would close and end Frosty's business.</p>

  <p>And Frosty knew it. That was why he had no thought at all of his fangs at
  this moment. He simply stood braced until the last instant, and then he dived
  for the shoulder of the inside dog. His head was the entering point of the
  wedge that he drove between that greyhound and the rock way. His shoulder was
  the heel of the wedge that hurled the tall dog to the side with a resistless
  impetus that knocked both it and its running mate over the edge of the
  rock.</p>

  <p>Their death yells ran needle-thin through the air and dropped at once into
  vagueness and distance.</p>

  <p>Frosty had no time to waste on triumph. One of the Gary breed was at him
  now. Frosty went right at his head with a blinding slash of his teeth, and
  then with a shoulder stroke that hurled him backward, head over heels.</p>

  <p>He slipped over the edge of the rock, clung by the forelegs, slowly,
  instinctively crawled back to the ledge.</p>

  <p>His second in the pack had gone the way of all flesh by that time. Frosty,
  fighting for life, had cut that big fellow down by the forelegs and rammed
  him in turn over the edge of the rock.</p>

  <p>And now, at last, that best of fighting backs held back. They had seen
  their leaders, one by one, hurled to destruction. It must have seemed to them
  that a four-footed devil was standing there, bristling, green fire shooting
  from his eyes.</p>

  <p>So they gave back, howling, snarling. Only the gallant, foolish greyhounds
  strove to get at the throat of the enemy, but found their way blocked by the
  massed formation of the Gary dogs, which were now at the front.</p>

  <p>So, for a moment, the great wolf stood his ground, and knew that he was
  giving his mate safe time to cross the top of the ledge and get down into the
  ravine beneath. And as that knowledge made him glance aside, he saw a thing
  that curdled his wolfish blood&mdash;for, straight across the ravine, lying
  at ease on the ground, a man was leveling his rifle at Frosty's heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; SAVED BY SILVER</h2>

  <p class="first">FROSTYknew that danger as well as though he already felt the
  bullet in his flesh. There were two men yonder across the ravine, and two
  horses, one of which shone like a statue of polished gold. The man who lay
  with the rifle at his shoulder was the vital danger for the moment; his
  companion was erect, his own rifle held at the ready, and now he leaned and
  jerked the gun of the marksman aside.</p>

  <p>That rifle spoke at the same instant, but the bullet finished far away,
  and Frosty heard the faint thud of it against the rock high up the cliff. He
  saw the marksman spring to his feet. He heard the thin, distant voices of
  dispute blowing toward him.</p>

  <p>And even the heart of the wolf knew that it was very strange indeed that
  men should interfere with one another when it came to the making of a
  kill.</p>

  <p>For his own part, there was a hollow thrill of joy in his heart, and he
  ran on with lightened body and strengthened legs. Behind him the disheartened
  pack of dogs had begun to snarl and quarrel with one another. The voices of
  their owners yelled far away; and so Frosty ran over the peak of the trail
  and sloped down the farther side into the bottom of the ravine, where his
  mate was already cantering.</p>

  <p>Above him, to the right side of the ravine, he saw the two hunters had
  mounted. A big man with a bare head rode the golden stallion, and on the bare
  head of the man there were two faintly gleaming spots of silver, just over
  the temples, and exactly like the sheen of incipient horns that begin to
  break out from the head of a deer.</p>

  <p>The rough edge of the cliff shut out the view of those two riders for a
  moment, and Frosty was glad to forget them. The newness of his escape from
  imminent danger was still a bewilderment in his mind. It was as though his
  throat had been crushed in the grip of a mighty enemy who, unharmed, had
  suddenly relented.</p>

  <p>But there is no relenting in the wilderness. To slay is to do right, and
  to destroy the enemy is the first duty.</p>

  <p>So when Frosty came to the staggering form of his mate, he looked upon her
  almost as a visionary thing&mdash;a thing that a young cub may daydream or
  see in the sweeping, tossing spray of a waterfall in summer. She was unreal.
  The reality remained back there on the trail where the dog pack had
  confronted him, and where the rifle had pointed at his heart.</p>

  <p>He ran up the main ravine, twice springing across the little run of water,
  leaping from stone to stone that jutted above the surface; and his mate,
  obediently, though on failing legs, followed him. Then he came to the place
  where the many smaller ravines split away from the throat of the main valley;
  and at the same time, far away behind him, he heard the full current of the
  hunting pack enter the valley.</p>

  <p>But he could afford to laugh now. It would take those dogs, no matter how
  keen, some time to pick up the trail which he had entangled in the lower
  valley for them. And while they were puzzling over that, he and his mate
  would be scampering to safety in the labyrinth of canyons that cut up the
  back country.</p>

  <p>He turned, therefore, down the first small ravine to his right.</p>

  <p>"A little more," he said to his mate, "and then we rest&mdash;we
  rest!"</p>

  <p>She made no answer. She gave no hint that she heard. She ran with slaver
  falling from her long red tongue. Her eyes seemed swollen; they were closed
  to mere slits, and showed like unlighted glass. Her coat stood up raggedly,
  like the coat of a wolf that has been through a frightful winter of famine.
  Mud and dust covered her. Her heart was breaking, as Frosty very well knew,
  but where a weaker spirit would have given up and crawled into the first
  hole, she kept to her work right valiantly. She was the sort of steel of
  which the right wolfhood should be made, Frosty knew.</p>

  <p>He knew, too, that his example and his presence were what finally
  sustained her during this last effort, and therefore he trotted cheerfully in
  the front, looking back now and again over his shoulder toward her.</p>

  <p>He was looking back in this manner as they rounded a sharp corner of the
  ravine, and he was surprised to see her stop short.</p>

  <p>Was she about to die of weariness, as he had seen a hunted rabbit die?</p>

  <p>He glanced ahead, and then he understood!</p>

  <p>For there stood the golden stallion with the big rider on his back, and
  the man was swinging a rope and calling, to his smaller, darker
  companion:</p>

  <p>"We'll take him alive! Don't shoot, Alec!"</p>

  <p>Alexander Gary, his rifle leveled from his shoulder, exclaimed in answer:
  "If you get that wolf on a rope, you'll wish that you'd daubed the rope on
  the devil, sooner! Lemme put some lead in him. That's the only way to handle
  him! Let me shoot, Silver!"</p>

  <p>"Keep that rifle to yourself!" thundered Silver. "Don't shoot!"</p>

  <p>His voice rang and roared through the narrows of the canyon as poor Frosty
  and his mate halted again, he crowding back to her.</p>

  <p>His heart was failing him at last. Before him were two men, reeking with
  the fatal taint of gunpowder and steel; two men, nearer to him than ever men
  had been before. And the sun was full and strong upon the scene, and what
  could keep death from Frosty now?</p>

  <p>Then he heard, well in the distance, the cry of the dog pack in the outer
  valley. In a few moments it would drift in and follow this canyon. There were
  dogs, and behind the dogs were armed hunters. From that danger there would be
  no escape, whereas once before these men had pointed a gun at him, and yet he
  had run to safety.</p>

  <p>So, making his choice, Frosty threw his mate one brief, snarling
  admonition, and started right up the canyon toward the two riders.</p>

  <p>The she-wolf lurched after him. She was so far gone that she would have
  followed the command of Frosty over a precipice blindly. It was all death to
  her. It had been death almost from the moment that the two pointers began to
  yell on the trail. It had been death on the run through the hills, death in
  the hiding of the haystack, death in running through the fencing of the
  corrals, death in the agony of long labor up the Indian trail, and now it was
  doubly death and doubly bitter since, for a moment, there had been a little
  hope of life.</p>

  <p>But she ran heavily after her lord and master.</p>

  <p>He was like a lord and master now more than ever before. He had erected
  his mane. He had thrown his head high. His eyes were balls of green fire as
  he threatened the two men to this side and to that.</p>

  <p>Before him he saw the glimmering on the bright steel barrel of Alec Gary's
  rifle. The weapon was still at the shoulder of Alec, and he groaned with
  eagerness as he got, through the sights, a dead bead on the great wolf.</p>

  <p>And on the other side of the narrow way, inescapably close, sat the man
  with the silver gleam in the hair above his temples. He was swinging a rope,
  opening the noose in it. The thing sang softly in the air. It was thin as a
  shadow, and it whipped a frail ghost of a shadow over the ground as the rider
  whirled it.</p>

  <p>That was danger, but it was a smaller danger than the rifle. This was that
  same man, also, who had pulled the rifle away from its line of fire upon the
  first occasion.</p>

  <p>That was why Frosty, compelled to make a choice between dangers, ran much
  closer to the man with the swinging rope, and as he ran, paid no heed to Jim
  Silver, but turned all his green-eyed fury, all of his hatred, toward Alec
  Gary.</p>

  <p>And as he came in between the danger of the pair it seemed to Frosty that
  the hateful steel collar that had been fastened upon him by the will of man
  now drank up all of the heat of the blazing sun and scalded his neck.</p>

  <p>But he was through!</p>

  <p>He was through the gap, though the rifle still pointed at him, though the
  whistle of the swinging rope had been in his very ear.</p>

  <p>He was through, and his mate was safely at his heels!</p>

  <p>Perhaps they had let him go as a wild cat lets a captured squirrel creep a
  little way from her terrible claws as she pretends to look the other way, all
  the while lashing her silken flanks with her tail in an ecstasy of savage
  exultation, and hate, and rage, and triumph.</p>

  <p>Perhaps these men were playing with him and would strike him dead at the
  moment he thought that he had come to safety.</p>

  <p>Alec Gary was groaning: "If you won't let me shoot, then daub the rope on
  him. There's the steel collar on his neck, and the location of the mine's
  inside the collar. Jim Silver, are you goin' to let a million dollars of
  meanness and wolf run right by you?"</p>

  <p>"I can't put the rope on him!" exclaimed Silver in answer. "He's too full
  of nerve. He had plenty of run in him. He could have crawled up the side of
  one of these rock walls, but he wouldn't leave his mate. He's a hero, Alec. I
  can't touch him&mdash;to-day, I can't!"</p>

  <p>Of course Frosty did not understand these words. But what he did
  understand was that that deep powerful voice was interceding between him and
  the danger. He knew that out of the throat of Jim Silver was flowing safety
  for him and for his mate.</p>

  <p>Did he feel gratitude?</p>

  <p>Well, that was an emotion about which he knew nothing. There is no
  gratitude in nature&mdash;unless it be perhaps between cubs and mothers or
  such a rare union as that of Frosty and the she-wolf. All that Frosty knew
  was that a man's voice had given him security. Twice, on a single day, his
  life had been saved by that same man. Frosty could not attribute motives, but
  he could understand facts. You may be sure that he was very glad that he had
  run as close as possible to Silver and as far as possible from Gary!</p>

  <p>And behind him, Silver was saying: "I'm sorry, Alec. But I couldn't do it.
  Not if that collar were worth a million mines. If I'd roped Frosty, we would
  have had to kill him before we could have quieted him. There was no room to
  run him and choke him down&mdash;not in this narrow ravine. And&mdash;man,
  man, he came right under the noose of my rope. He ran so close to me that it
  looked as though he were asking me for mercy&mdash;trusting me!"</p>

  <p>Alec Gary, gray and drawn of face, exhausted by violent emotions, stared
  at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Jim," he said, "everybody knows that you're the best fellow in the world.
  Everybody understands that. But what's in your head to-day, I can't tell. I
  thought you and I were hunting a wolf!"</p>

  <p>"We are," said Jim Silver contritely. "I've been a fool. We're hunting a
  cattle-killing devil of a lobo. No matter how big and handsome and brave he
  is, I'll never be a fool like this again, Alec. Only&mdash;something came
  over me twice to-day. I forgot he was just a wolf. I thought of him just as a
  brave fellow in danger, in the last ditch."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; CHRISTIAN'S SCHEME</h2>

  <p class="first">THURSTON and his pack of dogs, with Truman, the rancher to
  back him up, and with the patient and intelligent assistance of Barry
  Christian and Duff Gregor, kept after Frosty steadily.</p>

  <p>In seven days they actually ran the great wolf seven times. They ran
  Frosty high above timber line over snow and ice; they ran him in the tangles
  of the canyon that split the lower heights of the Blue Waters. But for a week
  they had no sight of his mate. Frosty came out alone and faced the hunt and
  ran it breathless.</p>

  <p>There were certain things to notice.</p>

  <p>The first day had cost a lot of dog flesh from the pack, but it had
  afforded a chance to do some shooting at Frosty.</p>

  <p>The second day there were three chances to open on Frosty with rifles, and
  it seemed probable that he had been wounded. The third day they had only a
  few glimpses of him in the distance. The fourth day they ran the pack by
  scent only, the greyhounds led behind on leashes to save their valuable and
  arrowy speed for the right moment. And on that day another dog out of the
  pack was killed&mdash;a big and wise pointer. The fifth day again they hunted
  Frosty without sight of his valuable head. They lost another pointer and one
  of the Gary dogs that day. They lost three of them on the sixth day, and four
  on the seventh. The very heart had been cut out of Joe Thurston's pack. He
  had to send back for more dogs.</p>

  <p>But he locked his jaw and said that he would keep on along those lines if
  it took him all summer.</p>

  <p>Barry laid his long-fingered hand on the shoulder of Thurston and said in
  his gentlest voice:</p>

  <p>"It won't take you all summer. It won't take you another week. There may
  be something left of you, but your dogs will all be gone. Look!"</p>

  <p>He sat down cross-legged by the camp fire and took out a notebook and
  began to sketch in it.</p>

  <p>"He got the first dogs on the ledge. Call that luck. He was hanging back
  for his mate, that day, and he just happened to find a place to make a last
  stand at the very moment that he needed it.</p>

  <p>"The second day the dogs were still working him pretty close, but already
  he had learned to leave the she-wolf behind him. We had a look at him a few
  times through the sights of our rifles. The third day we had only a glimpse.
  And since, the dogs have had his scent now and then, and we've had his prints
  to look at now and then. Not so often, either, because you notice that he
  prefers to run on hard rock now? The sun burns the scent off rock in a short
  time, and he knows it. Rock won't take the print of a wolf's paw, and he
  knows that, too. Every day we work him, we're teaching him how to beat us.
  The fourth day, he begins to teach us that he knows his lesson. Here, look at
  this."</p>

  <p>He showed the sketch which his rapid pencil had made&mdash;a little
  thicket of brush on a vast, rocky mountainside.</p>

  <p>"One of the pointers runs ahead of the rest, and Frosty waits for him and
  makes the kill, and then goes ahead. See how the kill was made&mdash;one long
  rip right across the throat. Knocked the dog flat with a shoulder stroke
  first, I suppose. Then Frosty doesn't stay there to exult over the kill. He
  runs right on and we see no more of him. Neither does the pack.</p>

  <p>"The next day, he gets two dogs. He waits for them on the far side of a
  ford. When the first dog gets across, Frosty pops out of these rocks and
  slaughters him. While he's killing that one, another of your fighting
  strength gets across, and Frosty handles him, too. See how it's done. Big
  dogs&mdash;scientific fighters, all of 'em. But Frosty knows how to lay them
  out. Would you fight a duel with a Frenchman who has been educated all his
  life to use a sword? That's what it means when any dog gets up against
  Frosty. Brains, and strength, and teeth that will bite through steel, it
  seems.</p>

  <p>"The next day, you lose three dogs. At different places along the trail.
  In a dark lane through a patch of big woods&mdash;in the narrows of a
  ravine&mdash;in a huge tangle of brush like a jungle. You see, Frosty is
  beginning to know this pack as well as he knows these mountains. He knows how
  fast the pack can run and how long it will take him to get to the next cover.
  He's enjoying the game now. The pack is running after him, but Frosty is
  doing the hunting.</p>

  <p>"Then comes to-day. He leads the pack through the tunnel of a long cave.
  In the dark he turns around, and two of the best dogs never come out. He
  takes the pack right back to the ford where he had fought them before, and
  there he slaughters two more. Notice that every day he grows bolder and
  bolder, turns to fight more and more often. And yet never lets us get within
  sight of him."</p>

  <p>He finished his sketching and folded his notebook.</p>

  <p>Joe Thurston, his coffee cup on his knee, stared at the fire with a small,
  grim smile, and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Truman got up and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"We're beaten," he muttered, under his breath.</p>

  <p>Thurston's voice snipped into that sentence sharply.</p>

  <p>"You may be beaten. I'm not. Not while the dogs last," he said.</p>

  <p>Big Duff Gregor was usually a silent partner in these conversations, only
  turning his head now and again to wait for wisdom from Barry Christian. But
  now he ventured:</p>

  <p>"It looks like a cooked job. What's the good of wasting our lives?
  Besides, there may be trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He let his voice die away, because the sharp glance of Christian had
  checked him.</p>

  <p>Truman, shrugging his shoulders, remarked that he would take a walk
  through the woods before he turned in, and added that he would start back to
  his ranch in the morning.</p>

  <p>As soon as the rancher was gone, Thurston declared: "You fellows have
  scared Truman off the trail. That's all right. I don't care if everybody's
  scared off the trail. I stick to it. What's the trouble that Gregor is afraid
  of?"</p>

  <p>"Gregor believes in luck; he thinks that we've got bad luck permanently on
  our trail now," put in Christian, before Gregor could speak.</p>

  <p>Thurston laughed, and the sound was like the snarling of one of his
  dogs.</p>

  <p>"I know another kind of trouble that you fellows don't want any part of,"
  he said. "Big Jim Silver and a fellow named Gary are still drifting around
  through the mountains, trying to cut into this game. And you don't want him
  to sight you. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>Christian was rubbing his hands slowly together, nodding, but what he said
  was:</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it occur to you, Thurston, that I may be able to make something
  out of this wolf hunt that will settle the score between me and Jim Silver? I
  know that Silver's in this part of the world, but he probably doesn't know
  that I'm around. Thurston, Truman, and a couple of strangers. That's all he's
  prepared for. But we'll never bag Jim Silver the way we're going about things
  now."</p>

  <p>Thurston turned his head and waited, his expression poisonously cold.</p>

  <p>"Go on, chief," urged Gregor, softening his voice as though he feared to
  break the current of the thoughts of Christian.</p>

  <p>But the great outlaw continued to stare into the distance where the
  mountains sprang up out of the night and pierced the last color in the
  sky.</p>

  <p>At last he said: "There's a way of doing the thing, I think. We can get
  Frosty. We can get Jim Silver, too. But not by tackling either of them
  directly."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor looked with a quick, small smile toward Thurston, as though he
  wanted to call Thurston's attention and bid him be ready for an idea that
  would be worth hearing.</p>

  <p>Then Barry Christian said: "Silver trails the wolf, and the wolf trails
  its mate. We can't catch Frosty by fair means, so we'll catch him by foul.
  We'll get the she-wolf alive and keep her, then Frosty will have to come to
  us. Silver will have to come to us, too. We'll have to try to be ready."</p>

  <p>He turned his face from the mountains and smiled at the fire, and his eyes
  glowed. Thurston had jumped up from his place. He glared at Christian for a
  moment. Then he began to walk up and down with short, quick steps.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd thought of it before," he said. "I'd be in a thousand
  dollars' worth of dogs, by this time&mdash;and maybe we'd have both the
  wolves drying by the fire."</p>

  <p>"It's no easy job to get the she-wolf. She never appears any more,"
  suggested Duff Gregor.</p>

  <p>"She'll sure appear to-morrow, though," said Thurston through his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, she did appear on the morrow. Thurston found an old
  set of her tracks and worked the dogs down the line to a dugout which was
  rank with the smell of the wolves. Out of that dugout the pack got the scent
  of the she-wolf, and though it was crossed and recrossed by the sign of
  Frosty, it seemed as though the dogs were glad to forget all about that
  destroyer. The pack hung closely to the traces of Frosty's mate and, late in
  the afternoon, suddenly she ran out of cover a mile ahead of the
  pointers.</p>

  <p>Big Frosty was there beside her, but only for a moment; then he
  disappeared into brush, heading off to the right, while his mate kept
  straight ahead.</p>

  <p>Joe Thurston cursed with hearty amazement, for Frosty's intention of
  pulling the pack after him while the she-wolf ran free was perfectly
  apparent.</p>

  <p>But on this day, Frosty's luck was out. He had read human minds very well,
  indeed, but he could not guess the device which Barry Christian had brought
  into the game.</p>

  <p>Right past the sign of Frosty's diverging trail ran the pack, with the
  greyhound shooting out into the lead toward the point where the other wolf
  had disappeared.</p>

  <p>There were two burning miles, then the riders brought their foaming horses
  in view of a big rock under which Frosty's mate had taken her stand, at bay.
  She had not the foot to distance the greyhounds, of course, and she had not
  the shiftiness to dodge them, as Frosty would have done.</p>

  <p>She had laid one of them writhing on the ground; the others, in a close
  semicircle, edged in gradually on the raving, green-eyed beauty.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian rode right through the dogs and landed the noose of his
  lariat over her neck just as she whirled to make a break for liberty.</p>

  <p>Thurston kept the dogs off. Duff Gregor landed another rope on the big
  she-wolf. In thirty seconds she was choked to a stagger, muzzled, hobbled,
  and ready to be dragged wherever her captors wished.</p>

  <p>Through the swirl of dust, Thurston looked down at their prize.</p>

  <p>"There's the difference between hunting an ordinary wolf and tackling
  Frosty," he said. "We've got her in one day. We wouldn't get him in one year.
  Not with an army."</p>

  <p>There was a peculiar answer to that speech, for from the opposite side of
  the valley, unseen among the woods, a wolf gave voice to a great,
  deep-throated lament; and the three men looked down at the ground with a
  sudden qualm of shame. They knew it was Frosty mourning for his mate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE HUNTERS' CAMP</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM SILVER lay out on the edge of a bluff with a field glass
  pressed to his eyes. He studied the opposite slope for a time, then he sat up
  and passed the glass to Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>"Take your turn," he said. "I think it's Frosty's mate. She's chained
  there. I could see the glitter of the chain."</p>

  <p>Gary studied the picture in turn. The powerful glasses picked up the
  farther mountainside and brought it suddenly closer. It expanded the
  clearing. He saw the white-headed stump where a tree had been newly felled.
  He saw the glistening of an ax. And in the middle of a patch of sunset that
  sloped from the west over the heads of the pines, he made out the big wolf
  that stalked restlessly up and down. A snaky streak of light coiled and
  recoiled and followed the captive. That was the chain, of course.</p>

  <p>"Looks tall," said Gary. "But I couldn't spot it as Frosty's mate."</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Jim Silver. "Dark above and pale below. She sat down
  while I was watching her, and the breast was almost white. Those are the
  markings of Frosty's mate. Listen!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden clamor of the voices of dogs. The noise fell away on
  one yelping sound as though a whip had been used.</p>

  <p>"And that's the pack!" suggested Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>He lowered the field glasses and shaded his eyes with his hand as though
  in that manner it would be easier to see the truth. All his lean, dark,
  handsome face showed the strain.</p>

  <p>"That's the pack," he went on. "It's the same lot of people who have been
  hunting Frosty with the dogs."</p>

  <p>"The same lot," said Silver. "Who are they?"</p>

  <p>Gary glanced at him and waited. He was always waiting on Silver, as upon
  the knowledge of a superior being. It was not merely that deference that had
  caused Silver to feel an affection for him. All during the ardors of that
  hunt, above timber line and below, through all sorts of weather, the patience
  and the endurance of Gary had been all that a man could ask for. There seemed
  to be in him none of the brute that had appeared in his uncle, Bill Gary. In
  Alec Gary the blood stream had run pure and clear. In every way the work had
  been difficult, and a dozen times, as they toiled and moiled to make out the
  trail, they had heard the clamor of the dog pack sweep by in the distance,
  hurrying miles away, and driving out of their den, once more, the great wolf
  for whom they hunted. But Gary had never complained.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who they might be," said Gary. "Except what I've guessed
  before&mdash;that it's Thurston's pack."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Silver. "Do you know Thurston?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him. That's about all."</p>

  <p>"What sort of reputation?"</p>

  <p>"Mean&mdash;but straight."</p>

  <p>"Really straight? Too straight, say, to throw in with a pair of
  crooks?"</p>

  <p>"What sort of crooks?" asked Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>"A crook like Barry Christian, for instance?"</p>

  <p>Slowly Gary shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "Thurston comes of decent people. I've seen his daughter.
  She's the right stuff. No, I don't think that he'd throw in with Christian.
  I'm sure he wouldn't. No decent man would, because everybody knows what
  Christian is and how he's deviled you."</p>

  <p>"Somewhere," mused Jim Silver, "Barry Christian and Gregor are in the
  mountains on the trail of Frosty. They are unless I'm entirely wrong.
  Christian knows what's inside that Red Cross collar. And he isn't the sort of
  a fellow to give up the job until he's put his hands on the treasure."</p>

  <p>"Suppose he knew that you were after Frosty, too. Would he still keep at
  the job?" asked Gary.</p>

  <p>"He'd keep at the job. He's not afraid of me, if that's what you mean,"
  answered Silver.</p>

  <p>"No? Then why does he run away from you?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's like a beast of prey. Doesn't fight until he's pretty sure
  of winning. He wants an advantage before he throws his hat into the ring. But
  if you think that Thurston wouldn't throw in with Christian&mdash;why, then
  it would be safe enough for you to go over there and find out just who owns
  that dog pack. Because, Alec, whoever it is will probably have Frosty by the
  leg before many days."</p>

  <p>"You mean," answered Gary, "that they'll cover the ground with traps and
  that Frosty will walk over those traps to get to his mate?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean. Has Frosty ever failed to stand by her, so far?"</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Alec Gary. "He's a regular lion when it comes to standing up
  for her."</p>

  <p>"He'll keep away for a while, perhaps. And when he comes in, first of all,
  he'll smell the traps and clear off. But finally he'll close his eyes and
  take a chance. It will be the last chance that he ever takes."</p>

  <p>Gary nodded.</p>

  <p>"And that," said Silver, "will be the end of the trail. The people who
  catch the wolf will be sure to examine the collar he's wearing. They'll open
  the little compartment. They'll find the message about the mine. They'll get
  the fortune that ought to be yours, Alec, and you'll have all of this work
  for nothing."</p>

  <p>Gary squinted at the distance, a way that all mountain men have when they
  are in earnest thought.</p>

  <p>"Not for nothing," he answered. "I've learned to know you, Jim. That's
  enough for me."</p>

  <p>Silver smiled at him. "Ride down there and take a look at the camp, will
  you?" he asked. "You can be back here before the twilight's very deep. You
  haven't pulled the saddle off your horse yet, and Parade has started grazing
  already."</p>

  <p>The stallion, hearing his name, tossed up his head and looked anxiously
  toward his master, scented the wind, made sure that all was well on all
  sides, and resumed his grazing.</p>

  <p>"I'll have the camp made and the fire started," said Silver. "I'll have
  the meat cooked before you get back."</p>

  <p>"I'll be here again before dark," agreed Gary. "And we ought to know who
  those people are. Jim, you really think that they'll get Frosty?"</p>

  <p>"They will," said Silver. "We're as good as beaten now. They had the
  brains to tackle the problem on its easier side. I never thought of doing
  that."</p>

  <p>Gary sighed. But without making the least complaint, he swung into the
  saddle and rode off down the hillside.</p>

  <p>Silver watched him for a short time. The way led steeply down into the
  valley and then up through a thickness of pines toward the clearing. Already
  the clearing was lost in thick shadows as the sun dropped lower in the
  west.</p>

  <p>It was the moment of the day which Silver liked best of all, next to the
  pure, still colors of the dawn. If he had been alone, he would have stood
  motionless, watching the day end and the fires of it soak out into the dim
  vapors of the night, but Gary was not accustomed to living like a wild
  Indian, and needed at least two good meals a day, with three preferred.</p>

  <p>So Silver, with a sigh, turned to the cookery.</p>

  <p>He could not help wishing to find, one day, a man like himself, capable of
  enjoying life even if there were only one meal a day&mdash;yes, or once in
  two days, if necessary&mdash;a man with all of his appetites perfectly under
  control, except that passionate and urgent appetite for the wilderness. He
  had never found a man of that sort. He was reasonably sure that he never
  would find one. In the whole course of his life he had found one living
  creature that he felt was like himself&mdash;and that was the great stallion,
  Parade. He did not own Parade. He had simply formed a partnership with the
  horse. Of men, there was of course Taxi&mdash;but Taxi was not a blood
  brother. Whatever the affection between them might be, they were total
  opposites.</p>

  <p>These were the rather gloomy thoughts of Jim Silver as he broke up some
  wood for the camp fire, and cut a number of small twigs to serve as spits for
  the rabbit meat. Young Alec Gary, with an accurate rifle, had picked off two
  jack rabbits that afternoon. They had been partially dressed, immediately
  after the killing, of course. Now Silver finished the cutting up of the meat
  and arranged it on the spits around the handful of flame.</p>

  <p>That, and salt and cold water, would be their fare. And perhaps a few bits
  of hard-tack. Ample for Silver, but starvation diet for Gary, as Silver well
  knew.</p>

  <p>Parade posted himself to windward of the fire and close in toward it.</p>

  <p>At a greater distance he would find far better grazing, free from the
  brush, but Parade always chose the strategic position rather than the one
  where he could fill his stomach most easily. Now, as he grazed, whether his
  head was down or up, he would be continually on guard. And even when he lay
  down to sleep, his senses would not be totally closed. His nostrils would
  still be drinking the wind and sifting the messages that were borne on it to
  his subconscious brain. His keen ears would be listening for the sound of
  feet or of distant voices. And, at the first token of peril, he would be up
  and snort and stamp beside his master until Jim Silver wakened.</p>

  <p>He made a better sentinel than a dozen trained men, and Silver trusted the
  horse more in dangerous country. Though, for that matter, all country was
  dangerous where Jim Silver rode. His friends made much noise, but they were
  always at a distance. His enemies were apt to be on his trail.</p>

  <p>He was thinking of these things, more gloomily than ever, when he was
  aware that the twilight had ended. The meat he had been turning on the spits
  was now browned and ready for eating. He wrapped that meat in some clean
  leaves, stood up, and cast one guilty glance toward the stars. He felt that
  he had been asleep at his post, indulging in useless reflections.</p>

  <p>For well before this, his friend should have returned.</p>

  <p>He went to the brow of the hill overlooking the deep valley, and stared in
  the direction of the clearing. It was invisible now. The trees seemed to
  march in unbroken ranks up the opposite steep slope. Only on the ridge they
  bristled against the dim background of the starlight.</p>

  <p>There Silver waited, watching, listening.</p>

  <p>The fact that there was no firelight from the opposite clearing was
  suspicious enough, for people were still there. At least, the dogs were
  there. Even now Silver heard a short, eager yelping that floated faintly to
  him on the thin mountain air.</p>

  <p>Danger was in that air, and he knew that he would have to go straight on
  to investigate the source of it. He saddled Parade and rode at once into the
  deeper night of the valley.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; BAIT FOR SILVER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE day is always two or three hours shorter under a heavy
  growth of pine trees. The morning light needs time to soak down through the
  branches, as it were; and in the evening the night seems to rise up out of
  the ground.</p>

  <p>So it seemed to young Alec Gary as he rode his mustang up the mountainside
  toward the clearing. It was already twilight in those woods. But there was
  still a dull rosy golden light in the air when he came out into the open.</p>

  <p>Before him he saw the big she-wolf. At his coming she had slunk to the
  other end of her chain and cowered against the ground, her bright eyes
  flashing from side to side as she vainly searched for some means of
  escape.</p>

  <p>On the far side of the clearing there was a straight face of rock some
  twenty-five or thirty feet high. He had not been able to see it from across
  the valley, no doubt because of the way the shadows from the trees fell
  across the polished face of it. Off to the side, half lost among the trees,
  he could see the shadowy forms of the leashed dogs. But more interesting than
  anything else, to the eye of Alec Gary, was the slender figure of Joe
  Thurston standing facing him with a loaded rifle.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Thurston," he said. "You don't have to shoot. I'm a friend."</p>

  <p>He laughed a little, as he said this.</p>

  <p>"You're a friend, are you?" said Thurston. "And what makes you think that
  I expect to see any enemies around here?"</p>

  <p>"The point is that I don't think it," answered Alec Gary. "But you seem to
  be ready for anything."</p>

  <p>"That's a good way to seem," answered Thurston.</p>

  <p>His thin lips kept twisting a little, and his eyes were always focusing
  and narrowing as though he were picking out the part of Gary's body into
  which he intended to put a slug of lead.</p>

  <p>He added: "What brought you up here, and who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Alec Gary. I'm up here with a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Alec Gary? I don't remember that name. Ever see me before?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I remember you, all right. But I'm not important enough to be looked
  at twice."</p>

  <p>This modest remark brought no smile from Thurston.</p>

  <p>"It's a funny time to be breaking in on a camp, seems to me," he said. "If
  you've got a friend with you, where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Back yonder," said Gary, with a very general wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Back where?"</p>

  <p>"Over yonder."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" asked Thurston. "Don't beat around the bush like this. Who is
  he?"</p>

  <p>"A fellow you may have heard of. His name is Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>The effect was instant. Thurston dropped the butt of his rifle to the
  ground and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver's with you, eh?" he said. "And doing what? Hunting
  Frosty?"</p>

  <p>"How do you guess that?"</p>

  <p>"Silver can't do anything that people won't talk about," said Thurston.
  "Every time he lifts his hand, the shadow falls right across the sky." He
  chuckled, amused by his own conceit.</p>

  <p>"Get off your horse and sit down," said Thurston finally.</p>

  <p>Gary accepted the invitation.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing cooked yet," said Thurston. "Can't offer you
  anything."</p>

  <p>"That's all right. Other fellows out hunting grub?"</p>

  <p>"What other fellows?" snapped Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Why," said Gary, "you couldn't be up here handling and feeding a mob of
  dogs like this all by yourself."</p>

  <p>But he was disturbed by the sudden way in which Thurston had snapped the
  words at him.</p>

  <p>"I can handle those dogs and more," was all that Thurston replied.</p>

  <p>"That's Frosty's mate, isn't she?" asked Gary.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Why else would you have her on a chain?"</p>

  <p>"Because she's the finest she-wolf that I've ever seen. Some of the
  museums are always looking for outstanding specimens like her. They get
  plenty of fine dog-wolf pelts for stuffing, but mighty few females that are
  not runts."</p>

  <p>Gary merely smiled.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe me, eh?" asked Thurston, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Sure, that's all right," answered Gary. "I believe anything that you want
  to tell me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Thurston coldly.</p>

  <p>He kept on eying Gary as though with a profound distrust.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Gary. "You don't have to open up and talk. We're both
  after the same scalp, and I suppose you'll get it&mdash;now that you have
  this museum hide staked out. Do you always do that, Thurston?"</p>

  <p>"Do I always do what?"</p>

  <p>"Stake out your big wolves and cool 'em off with a little walking on a
  chain before you take their hides?"</p>

  <p>Joe Thurston snapped suddenly: "You're too curious."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Alec Gary slowly.</p>

  <p>Thurston turned suddenly on his heel and walked off through the trees.</p>

  <p>He simply tossed over his shoulder the words: "He's Jim Silver's hunting
  partner, and Silver is somewhere around here."</p>

  <p>Whom was he addressing? Alec Gary glanced over his shoulder and saw two
  big men stepping out from behind the pine trees. One was heavily, strongly
  made about the shoulders and narrow through the hips; in body and in face he
  was something of the appearance of Jim Silver, though he was less clean-cut.
  His companion had a rather long, pale, handsome face. He looked as though he
  had not been much in the sunlight. His hair was very long. He had supple
  hands with very long fingers. One might have expected to see him sitting at
  an easel pointing a woodland scene rather than drawing a revolver with a
  practiced ease.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, partner?" he asked as he approached.</p>

  <p>His voice was wonderfully soft, gentle and low but that did not seem an
  excellent thing to Alec Gary. He had heard a cat purr on much the same note.
  In the face of the pale man's companion there was a frank and open glint of
  mockery.</p>

  <p>"My name is Alec Gary," he answered. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Wilkins," said the stranger. "This is my partner, Hal Murphy."</p>

  <p>"Or Jones?" queried Alec Gary. "Or Smith? Or Brown?"</p>

  <p>For the falsity of the name suddenly rang hollow on his ear. He regretted
  that he had allowed his tongue to take the mastery over him.</p>

  <p>"Wilkins" continued to regard him with a quiet eye.</p>

  <p>"You're with Silver, are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm with Jim Silver," answered Gary, reassured as he mentioned the
  name.</p>

  <p>For, even if these fellows were outlaws, they would be certain to respect
  that famous and terrible name.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the pale-faced man, "perhaps you wouldn't mind spending a
  little time with us?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" asked Gary.</p>

  <p>"Because," said the other, while his companion suddenly grinned more
  broadly, "Jim Silver knows me, and when he comes looking for you, to-night, I
  want him to find me in."</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver knows you?" repeated Gary. He could understand that there was
  a threat in the air, but he could not make out what seemed a very twisted
  meaning.</p>

  <p>The pale man kept smiling gently at him. His voice was more poisonously
  caressing than ever as he answered: "You see the she-wolf, Gary?"</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Gary.</p>

  <p>"She's bait for Frosty. She's his mate."</p>

  <p>"I guessed at that," answered Gary, frowning.</p>

  <p>"And I've been hoping," said the other, "that Jim Silver might come
  investigating at about the same time that Frosty dropped in on us. But now
  that you've decided to stay with us, I'll be the surer that Silver will come.
  Because there is one thing that one can always be sure of, when Jim Silver is
  in the case. He won't let his friends down. Never! If one of 'em gets in a
  pinch, honest Jim Silver, brave Jim Silver, noble Jim Silver will never fail
  to put his head in the lion's mouth to get the fellow out of trouble."</p>

  <p>A strong chill of dread passed through Alec Gary, body and mind.</p>

  <p>"What trouble?" he asked. "I don't follow you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you? Be patient, brother, be patient. If you stay here with us, you
  see, Jim Silver might get a wrong idea in his head. He might think that you
  were being forced to stay. He might think that we'd drawn guns on you, and
  tied you hand and foot, and that we intended to keep you until we decided how
  we'd cut your throat. And ideas like that are just the things to bring out
  all the nobility of Mr. Silver. Oh, I could tell you some strange stories
  about the ways he has walked into danger for the sake of his friends.
  Eh?"</p>

  <p>The silent companion nodded and grinned. Both of them were watching Gary
  steadily, and a big Colt kept shifting in the supple hand of the pale
  man.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" broke out Gary suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why," said the pale man, "as you suggested a while ago, you might call us
  Smith, or Jones, or Brown, or, perhaps, Barry Christian and Duff Gregor!"</p>

  <p>At this, as the flesh of Gary turned to stone, Gregor broke out:</p>

  <p>"Why give him the names, Barry? That's a fool play, it seems to me!"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Christian calmly, "after he's been used, he won't be alive
  to talk about us, Duff."</p>

  <p>He made a gesture that jerked up the muzzle of the Colt.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands, you poor half-wit," he said to Gary. "You've walked
  right in on us, and now you'll stay a while."</p>

  <p>There was plenty of fighting blood in Alec Gary. To put up his hands meant
  to surrender his hope of living. But not to raise them, as he plainly saw in
  the face of Barry Christian, meant to die at once. Besides, the evil name of
  the man enchanted him and killed his heart. Slowly he raised his hands in
  surrender.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE COMING STORM</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM SILVER, as he went down the hillside on Parade, heard
  out of the north and the west a heavy rumbling, as if a great wagon were
  rolling over a wooden bridge, gradually disappearing.</p>

  <p>The noise died away. It began again. Then he saw the glimmer of distant
  lightning above the mountaintops. Either that was a storm which would
  presently walk up across the sky and put out the stars, or else it was to be
  confined to the farther side of the range, only its head showing in thin
  flashes above the crest of the peaks.</p>

  <p>He passed the bottom of the valley, and Parade started through the trees,
  weaving suddenly to this side and then to that, for Parade knew perfectly
  well that branches which he could easily clear himself might nevertheless
  sweep his master out of the saddle, and when Silver was on his back, the man
  was a part of the horse. One nervous system seemed adequate for them both. So
  they went snaking through the woods at a pace that would have been ruinous
  for any other rider on any other mount.</p>

  <p>When they were well up the slope of the mountain, at about the place where
  Silver expected to find the clearing, he halted Parade, dismounted, and
  whispered for a moment into the ear of the great horse. Parade would stand
  quietly now, straining his ears to hear from his master even the faintest and
  most distant whistle. And if there were a sound of footfalls coming toward
  him through the woods, Parade could tell perfectly if the step of his master
  were among the noises. Otherwise he would shift and give ground and hide
  himself with all the cunning of some great jungle beast.</p>

  <p>So Silver left him and went gradually forward, listening continually for
  noises of any sort. Now and again he heard the voices of the dogs as they
  whimpered in their sleep or wakened to growl at imaginations of the
  night.</p>

  <p>That was all that he could make out until he suddenly found himself clear
  of the trees. That was all he could make out for an instant, but dropping to
  one knee, he commenced to scan everything around him with care until the
  starlight showed him the main details.</p>

  <p>He was on the verge of the clearing. Yonder skulked the she-wolf, with the
  long steel chain clinking musically as she walked back and forth. Now she lay
  down and gritted at the chain with her strong teeth; and out of the
  distance&mdash;no, it was not so very far away&mdash;Frosty's melancholy call
  came echoing through the woods.</p>

  <p>Then a man's voice said: "He's on the trail now. He's pretty close,
  too."</p>

  <p>The words were not what made Silver flatten himself against a tree to gain
  a better shelter. They were not what brought the Colt suddenly into his hand.
  But it was the voice that ran all through him with an electric shock of
  savage joy and desire.</p>

  <p>It was the prime goal of all his questing, and he was now in reaching
  distance of it. It was Barry Christian who spoke there.</p>

  <p>He could see the man, at first obscured against the shadow of the trees,
  but now discernible with a smaller companion at his side. Whoever it was, it
  was not Duff Gregor.</p>

  <p>"He's coming in," said the smaller man. "I thought he'd have more sense.
  It's a pity in a way, Barry. It's like seeing a great man throw himself away
  on account of a woman."</p>

  <p>"I'll pity him to-morrow, if I can catch him to-night," answered
  Christian. "Whisper hears him now. Listen to her whining."</p>

  <p>"Who gave her that name?" asked the smaller man.</p>

  <p>"Gregor," said Barry Christian. "And it fits her. If it weren't for the
  chain that she carries around, we'd never hear her moving."</p>

  <p>"Whisper!" said the other. "Well, isn't it time for you to get on guard?
  Isn't Silver likely to show up any moment?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a time, I think," said Christian. "Only the devil can tell just
  what Silver will do or how long it will take him to do it. But he won't be
  here for a while, I suppose. If he does come&mdash;well, he may simply
  blunder into the clearing and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice stopped.</p>

  <p>"You'll have only starlight to shoot by," said the smaller man.</p>

  <p>"There are handfuls of buckshot in those shotguns," said Christian. "We
  won't miss. This time of all times, we won't miss."</p>

  <p>They retired toward the base of the big rock. From the darkness there,
  unseen, the voice of Alec Gary spoke. There was the hard, smacking sound of a
  blow and a snarling answer. Gary spoke no more. One of the dogs whimpered, as
  though in sympathy. Then the forest settled back into silence.</p>

  <p>It was only silence close at hand. In the distance there was still the
  muttering and the rumbling of the thunder, from time to time.</p>

  <p>Silver remained on one knee. If ever he had been close to praying, he was
  close now; and if ever temptation had taken him by the throat, it had been
  when the dark form of Barry Christian loomed so close through the night. One
  flick of Silver's thumb over the hammer of his revolver, and Barry Christian
  would have gone, at last, to his final account. It seemed to Jim Silver, as
  he kneeled there, that there was a perverse deity controlling him, bringing
  him so often close to the great criminal, and so often letting Christian slip
  away from him again.</p>

  <p>He had lodged Christian in prison, to await the death penalty; and
  Christian had managed to escape almost on the last day. He had seen Christian
  hurled into a flooded river that ran like a galloping horse toward a
  cataract. But chance and the unlucky hands of another man had drawn Christian
  out of the danger that time. And now, as Silver kneeled in the dark, he knew
  that at last he could bring the trail to an end and kill his man. It was the
  thing for which he had waited. It was an incredible good fortune that had
  brought Christian into his hand. He would speak one word&mdash;and then the
  bullet would strike.</p>

  <p>But the thought of young Alec Gary held Silver back. Gary was somewhere
  near. Gary and a she-wolf were baits for him and for the great wolf,
  Frosty.</p>

  <p>That thought was still working in his mind, holding his hand, as Christian
  moved away through the darkness. And then, after Gary had spoken and had been
  silenced, and after the dog had whimpered and silence fallen yet again,
  Silver was aware that something lived beside him. There had been no sound of
  the approach, but something was there&mdash;something formidably big and
  dangerous.</p>

  <p>Gradually he turned his head and saw, hardly two steps away, the dim loom
  of the figure of a wolf.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Silver was on one knee, but it seemed to him at the
  first glance that the creature had the outline of a wolf but the bulk of a
  bear. A shock of fear struck Silver.</p>

  <p>Then he realized that it was Frosty.</p>

  <p>He had come through the darkness to the edge of the clearing. Would he
  venture out across ground that was doubtless sewed thick with traps?</p>

  <p>The big fellow drifted a little forward, crouched on his belly, stretched
  out a shadowy paw, and then drew it back. He moved to the side, and then the
  wind seemed to come to him from the man so close.</p>

  <p>There was an instant of pause. Frosty bristled to his full height. The
  green glare of his eyes burned into the soul of Silver. And then he was gone.
  For all the speed of that withdrawal, still there had not been a sound.</p>

  <p>Was that not another of the ironies which chance was heaping upon the head
  of Jim Silver on this night? The wolf had been there beside him. He had even
  been able to make out the glimmer of the steel links of the collar that was
  around his neck. And yet Silver had not dared to shoot.</p>

  <p>He had not dared because of Alec Gary. The young fellow seemed to be hung
  like a leaden weight around his neck.</p>

  <p>But what could be done?</p>

  <p>To cross the clearing was impossible because of the traps. It was
  impossible because of the shotguns, also. For Barry Christian would not miss.
  Even Silver himself was hardly a hairbreadth more accurate with weapons than
  Christian&mdash;and on this night Christian would be shooting for the prize
  of all his life.</p>

  <p>How to come at the prisoner at the base of the rock, then?</p>

  <p>It was typical of Christian that he should have had wit enough to secure
  his man at a point which was so perfectly open, and which was nevertheless so
  unapproachable.</p>

  <p>Suppose that Silver tried to skirt around through the woods and come at
  the others?</p>

  <p>Well, there would be traps through the woods, too&mdash;on the verge of
  them, at least. And if a wolf trap closed on his foot it would be a bad
  business&mdash;the last business for Jim Silver in this world.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth and waited for a thought. None came.</p>

  <p>He withdrew through the trees to Parade and saw the pale glimmer of the
  great eyes of the horse. Parade stood with high head, turning it a little
  from side to side, his ears stiffly forward as he listened and scented a
  hundred dangers. His fear was so great that he had broken into a fine sweat,
  but still he waited at his post for his master. And a great outrush of
  admiration for the dumb brute poured from the heart of Silver. What is so
  admirable as those who can endure even when they cannot understand?</p>

  <p>As he stroked the horse, his hand touched the rope which was coiled and
  tied to the front of the saddle. With it came his first hope of making the
  delivery of Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>It was only a vague hope, for the scheme seemed so ridiculous that he
  smiled and shook his head in the darkness. He gripped his hands hard, also,
  and flexed the big muscles of his arms.</p>

  <p>He was stronger, far stronger than other men, and yet he could not help
  doubting the sufficiency of his might for the task which he contemplated.</p>

  <p>He took Parade back through the woods, circled them at a distance, and as
  the wind blew from him toward the clearing, he heard the dogs of the pack
  break out into one of their sudden clamors. He continued in the wide sweep of
  the semicircle, quitted Parade in the trees up the slope, and at last came
  slowly forward, carrying the rope which he had taken from the saddle.</p>

  <p>He had laid his course, through the darkness of the night and the trees,
  with such accuracy that he came out just above the lip of the rock at the
  foot of which the men of the camp were posted.</p>

  <p>The night was dimmer than ever. It seemed that the storm which had been
  roaring in the north and west was now breaking out of the higher mountains
  and approaching this section. Gusts of wind moaned distantly through the
  trees or sounded close at hand with sudden rushings. Big clouds, also, were
  poured in broken streams across the sky, so that the stars were blotted out
  in great parts of the heavens. But in intervals of the noise of the coming
  storm, Silver, stretched out at full length on the ground, staring down from
  the ledge, could hear and vaguely see the men below.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; ROPE RESCUE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHAT Silver made out, at last, was one figure continually in
  place at the bottom of the rock. That he took to be his friend, particularly
  since the silhouette never moved, and therefore was probably bound hand and
  foot. There were three others who changed places from time to time. Sometimes
  one of them would move away into the woods on one side, and sometimes one
  would pass into the other trees. He heard the name "Thurston" used, which
  served to identify the smaller man of the trio. The others would be Christian
  and Gregor, of course.</p>

  <p>As his eyes grew more used to the broken starlight, he could make out the
  details more clearly. Above all, he could see the double-barreled shotguns
  whose big charges of buckshot could be sent home without much light to aim
  by. Sometimes all three of the men on watch were pooled together for a few
  moments, and on those occasions there was most of the talk that he was able
  to hear. The voices were kept low, but the face of the rock was hollowed and
  curved in such a way that it gathered the noises like a sounding board.</p>

  <p>At one of those times, Silver heard Thurston say: "This may be a rotten
  business. People are going to ask a lot of questions if Jim Silver
  disappears. The other one, here&mdash;I don't suppose that he'll count so
  much."</p>

  <p>"People won't have any questions to ask. Not for years," said Christian.
  "No one is likely to show up in this neck of the woods for a long time. We're
  pretty far back in the tall timber, you know. The main thing is to realize
  that Silver often disappears for months at a time. Every one realizes
  that."</p>

  <p>"What does he do when he disappears?" asked Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Nobody knows. Some people say that he has a mine staked out somewhere,
  and when he runs out of funds, he goes back to the place and grinds up more
  ore in his coffee mill and washes out some more dust," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"What does he need money for, when he lives worse than a wild Indian most
  of the time?" asked Thurston.</p>

  <p>"He needs it to throw away," said Christian. "The fool can't keep money in
  his pocket. Any fellow with half a brain about him can wheedle every penny
  out of the hand of Jim Silver. But I don't think he spends his lost time at
  any mine."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because it would be beneath him. That's one of his poses. Pretends to
  despise gold and everything that it will do. He probably just goes out into
  the woods and gets close to nature."</p>

  <p>"How close?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he can whistle like any bird you name; he can chatter like a
  squirrel and hoot like an owl and growl like a bear. He knows the look of
  every tree and blade of grass. That's why he knows how to follow a trail. He
  can almost see in the dark."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said Thurston. "That might be bad business for us."</p>

  <p>Christian merely laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not so bad," he said. "He won't shoot you in the back, no matter what
  happens. There's no Indian in him. He'll give you as much warning as a
  rattlesnake before he starts spraying lead."</p>

  <p>That was the brief picture of Silver that Christian painted, and as it
  ended, Thurston asked:</p>

  <p>"Why does he hate you, Christian? What good would it do him to nail you
  down?"</p>

  <p>"Newspaper space," said Christian. "He wants glory. And he thinks that
  there isn't room enough in the world for the two of us."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thurston, "if he's as clever as you say, and can work in the
  dark so well, it's pretty certain that he won't run into the trap that you've
  laid for him."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what he sees," answered Christian. "The fool has a sort
  of a code that he lives by. If he has a partner, he has to get the other
  fellow out of trouble every time. He knows that if we have young Gary, we'll
  make a dead man of him by the time the day commences. Sometime before the
  dawn, he's sure to try his hand. He may do anything he can think of that's
  clever, but cleverness won't help him now. There's only one way for him, and
  that's to rush the camp!"</p>

  <p>"Aye," exclaimed Gregor, exultantly, "and that will mean one Colt against
  three shotguns. But can't he work some trick here?"</p>

  <p>"Look around for yourself," said Christian. "What can he do? If he had
  wings, he might drop down out of the air and carry Gary off in his talons.
  That's about all that he could manage, I take it."</p>

  <p>Then he commanded: "Keep on the stir. The best way to handle him is to
  meet him on the way and get in the first shot. He'll sneak up through the
  trees probably, on one side or the other. Keep sifting in and out. Use your
  eyes and use your ears. This storm that's blowing up makes everything a lot
  harder for us."</p>

  <p>The trio broke up again. Thurston and Gregor moved off to the trees, and
  Christian remained walking up and down in front of the prisoner.</p>

  <p>The sky was now almost totally covered with clouds. The stars whirled
  through the rents, now and again. The wind struck in quickening gusts, with a
  louder roaring, and when the lightning played in the northwest, it showed a
  hood of rain lowered over the higher mountains. Sometimes the lightning
  seemed to set all the rain on fire, like a gas, and against that dull flare
  the big trees stood out. There was one thunder-blasted giant with a
  half-naked head that remained seared forever upon the memory of Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>Rain began to rattle around him, big drops that splashed from the polished
  rock against his face in fine spray. The weight and sting of the drops he
  could feel against the back of his neck. He had taken off his hat. The wind
  cuffed his head from behind and pulled almost painfully at the roots of his
  hair.</p>

  <p>He was cold, he was wet, but he remained in his place, motionless,
  watchful as a cat beside a mouse hole.</p>

  <p>Then, at last, he had his chance.</p>

  <p>All three of the watchers had, for the moment, stepped out of sight. Rain
  was falling in sheets now. It would ease away in a moment, he felt sure. But
  the lightning flash that fell jagged out of the heart of the sky just
  overhead showed him the polished, wet green of the trees, the cowering
  she-wolf in the clearing, the bowed form of the captive, and not even a
  glimmer of any of the guards. They were effectively carrying out Barry
  Christian's doctrine of watching in the trees for the approach of the
  rescuer.</p>

  <p>Instantly he dropped the noose of his rope&mdash;and missed the figure
  below him!</p>

  <p>He jerked up on the rope and got nothing. The wind must have blown the
  noose awry to spoil his cast.</p>

  <p>He tried again, though in a misty darkness that shut out view of his
  target. Through the smother of the rain he cast with a wider noose, and
  hauled in, and again he caught nothing.</p>

  <p>The rain, instead of letting up, fell now with a mightier violence than
  ever. It struck on his back with ten million little hammer beats. Then the
  lightning cleaved the watery air again and showed him a scene covered with
  dark or glistening pencil strokes of rain, like a photograph taken in a dim
  room. He could see the target, that instant, and as he threw the noose of the
  rope again, he saw something else&mdash;a vaguely outlined figure not far
  away, coming out from the trees. The man was Gregor, walking with his shotgun
  sheltered under his arm, his head down to the rush of the rainfall.</p>

  <p>The thunder burst over the head of Silver like a load of rocks on a tin
  roof. He pulled in on the rope, half despairingly. He could not believe his
  fortune when he found a weight attached to it!</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet. Already, long before, he had selected the small jags
  of rock on which he would brace his feet. He planted himself accordingly and
  hauled. He had feared that it was merely an outthrust of rock at the base of
  the cliff that he might have snared, but he found a ponderous, loose weight
  at the bottom of his line.</p>

  <p>He could not get a free haul on the weight. He had to lean back to get his
  full strength at the work, and that meant that the rope ground against the
  edge of the cliff, and the friction used up a large part of his effort.</p>

  <p>He took short arm hauls, giving himself half a second of rest between the
  efforts, his right fist braked against his hip. The weight grew heavier and
  heavier, or so it seemed.</p>

  <p>He prayed that there might not be another flash of lightning. In the
  extremity of his labor, his head jerked back with each swing of his body, and
  that was how he saw the clouds breaking above him, the stars showing through
  like a whirl of bright golden bees.</p>

  <p>The weight came closer. He could tell that by the shorter oscillations of
  the rope. Then the greatest of his efforts failed to budge the rope.</p>

  <p>Fear made his eyes swell suddenly in his head. He took a breath, made
  ready, and hauled with all his might.</p>

  <p>There was not the slightest give!</p>

  <p>Had the body or the clothes of Gary caught against a sharp projection of
  the rock? He leaned and made the free end of the rope fast to a knob of rock.
  As he finished the knot, the rope slacked out a little. And then, again, the
  lightning split the heavens, and the thunder shouted at his ear, filled his
  brain with deafness.</p>

  <p>Not total deafness, however, for as he crawled to the side of the ledge,
  he heard a wild voice, the voice of Gregor, shouting from below:</p>

  <p>"Silver's here! Silver! He's hauling Gary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before the words ended, a shotgun roared, and a whistling blast of the
  buckshot tore the air just in front of Silver. If he had leaned out from the
  rock an instant sooner, that discharge would have knocked out his brains, he
  knew.</p>

  <p>As it was, he found that his first guess had been right. It was a
  projecting rock that had halted the upward progress of Gary. It was, in fact,
  the very edge of the cliff itself! He groaned at his folly in not
  calculating, accurately, just how much slack he would have to draw in to
  bring the body to the lip of the rock, for here was the prisoner, pressed
  close against the ledge, in easy arm reach.</p>

  <p>Silver gripped the other's coat at the nape of the neck with a mighty hand
  and lifted until the springing tendons on his back and shoulder threatened to
  snap&mdash;but he managed to sway Gary up and over the ledge.</p>

  <p>They sprawled flat, side by side, as two more shotguns belched in the
  lower darkness, and the terrible, ringing voice of Christian began to shout
  revilings at Gregor.</p>

  <p>"The horses!" shouted Christian. "Get the horses! We'll cut 'em off in the
  woods. This is going to be our night before it finishes!"</p>

  <p>Silver, with one hand, drew his hunting knife to cut the bonds of Gary.
  With the other hand he fumbled at the ropes. And the first thing that he
  found was that his lariat was around the head of the captive! In his effort
  to free the man, had he hanged him?</p>

  <p>He removed the noose, cut the bonds, tore the gag from the mouth of Gary,
  and jerked him to his feet. A loose figure sagged against him. A dead, limp
  weight remained in his arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE TRAP IS SPRUNG</h2>

  <p class="first">LIGHTNING played again. By the thrusting flash of it, Silver
  saw the face of his friend. It looked like death, and horrible death. The
  mouth sagged wide open, and there was blood about the corner of it. The rope
  mark was pressed into the flesh still, as though Gary had bitten at the rope
  and tried to keep it in place in that manner, when he first felt the noose
  slipping up around his body after the last cast of Silver. The earlier casts
  must have brushed him and warned him of the manner in which his friend was
  fishing to save his life from above.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the pressure of the rope alone had been enough to strangle Gary.
  Perhaps the effect of the gag which had been wedged inside the teeth of Gary
  plus the rope had turned the trick.</p>

  <p>Silver moved the body. The head fell limply back. The eyes were partly
  open. Another flare of the lightning showed that.</p>

  <p>He stood there with a helpless bulk in his arms&mdash;and terrible Barry
  Christian and his men were coming on horses to comb the woods for prey!</p>

  <p>Silver threw the body of Alec over his shoulder and ran stumblingly back
  to Parade. Over the withers of the horse he bent the burden, mounted, and
  made the loose hulk sit up before him.</p>

  <p>Now he was ready for flight, at least, if Christian should sight him. And
  at the same time he heard what was a sweet music to his ears&mdash;a faint,
  gasping sound from the throat of Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>Silver instinctively threw upward one look of gratitude. Then he sent
  Parade swiftly through the darkness down the slope. It might be that he would
  encounter the enemy on either one side of the way or the other, but he took
  the chance because already another idea had come to his mind.</p>

  <p>Alec Gary was fighting hard for breath now, groaning and gasping, and life
  was returning rapidly into his inert body. He was able to maintain himself
  erect by the time Silver had circled back through the woods to the point
  which he desired.</p>

  <p>Then from the mountain slope just above, he heard the crackling of guns, a
  brief burst, silence, a distant shouting.</p>

  <p>Had they mistaken one another in the darkness, and opened fire blindly?
  Silver could not help smiling as he thought of that possibility. He was out
  of the saddle. Gary had slid down to the ground, still gasping for
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Stay here&mdash;move if the horse wants to move," Silver warned him, and
  glided straight ahead toward the clearing.</p>

  <p>Lightning showed it to him through the trees. He saw the open space and
  the chained she-wolf. Straight to her he went. She lay flat, as though to be
  exposed to the lightning without any shelter over her head had left her
  senseless.</p>

  <p>In one moment the flying fingers of Jim Silver had loosed the collar from
  her neck. As he stood up, he heard a faint whine that diminished along the
  ground. And the mate of Frosty was gone like a streak away from his feet.</p>

  <p>With her went the nearest chance of capturing Frosty and the secret of the
  lost gold mine. But at least she had been taken from the hands of Christian;
  she would no longer serve as a lure to drag back the great Frosty into a
  trap.</p>

  <p>Silver rejoined Gary.</p>

  <p>What he wanted, and what he hoped, was to find Gary sufficiently well to
  take care of himself; instead, he discovered Gary lying on the ground, softly
  groaning. And that ended his chance of taking Barry Christian and Gregor and
  Thurston in hand that night. His duty would be to Gary first. Once more the
  heir of Bill Gary was a load tied to his neck.</p>

  <p>So he got Gary back on Parade and rode behind him down the slope of the
  valley and up the farther side.</p>

  <p>He regained the old camping ground. He could trust that Barry Christian
  would hardly hunt for him that far afield, to find him with his helpless man.
  Therefore he ventured on building a fire well screened about by rocks and
  trees so that the only strength of it rose straight upward in the air. He
  stretched his sick man by that fire and covered him with a slicker. Gradually
  the warmth restored the tied-up circulation of Gary, though still for a long
  time every breath he drew was a muffled groan.</p>

  <p>When he could speak, he said: "They would have murdered me by morning.
  They would have done me in. I heard Christian say so."</p>

  <p>"I heard the same thing," said Silver. "But they missed you&mdash;forget
  about it!"</p>

  <p>"Forget about hell and the chief devil on the job!" muttered Gary. He
  stared at the fire with great eyes, and then rubbed his battered, torn mouth.
  He spat blood. His whole body was trembling.</p>

  <p>"I felt the rope brush me two or three times," he said. "If I could have
  moved, I would have rolled away. If I could have yelled, I would have called
  for help. I began to strangle with fear. I had a crazy idea in my head that I
  must be blocking the entrance to some snake's den, and that some big,
  poisonous rattler was about to sock his fangs into me. It didn't occur to me
  that a rattler would have sounded off first. And then the rope caught around
  me. I understood then. I knew that you were up there fishing for me, Jim. But
  I didn't see how it could work. I didn't see how you'd have strength to pull
  me up."</p>

  <p>"I was a half-wit," said Silver. "Otherwise I would have brought up Parade
  and hitched the rope to him. I would have hauled you up with Parade instead
  of with my arms."</p>

  <p>He paused. Gary nodded. Then he went on:</p>

  <p>"Then I felt the cursed noose slipping up around me little by little. It
  wouldn't catch hold around my body. It wouldn't catch me around the
  shoulders. When it slipped off my shoulders, I leaned my head forward. My
  mouth was held gaping&mdash;wide open&mdash;by the gag that Gregor had shoved
  into it. I couldn't bite on the rope, but I could hook my teeth over it. Then
  came a big strong pull that lifted me right off the ground. The noose froze
  in on my head. The ring of it ground into the base of my skull. I thought it
  was smashing the bone. The fore part of it crushed back into my mouth. I
  thought I'd be strangled, or that my head would smash in.</p>

  <p>"I tried to get the rope out of my mouth. It seemed better to die the way
  Christian would kill me than the way I was dying then. But I couldn't get the
  rope out of my mouth. The noose was freezing into me deeper and deeper. It
  shoved the gag back into my mouth until I couldn't breathe any more. I was
  strangling. All the time I was being hauled up higher and higher, and all the
  time the noose was biting into me, constricting, tearing at the flesh,
  threatening to smash in my skull. But the strangling was the worst. There was
  blackness with spinning red lights across it. Then there was just the
  blackness and no lights at all. And after that&mdash;I died. I mean I thought
  it was death. It was just the same as death. Just the same agony.</p>

  <p>"But afterward I saw the whirled lights and the blackness. I was on
  Parade, and your hands were holding me up."</p>

  <p>He had talked himself back into a full realization of life, and how near
  he had come to losing it. Now he sat up suddenly and stared at Silver.</p>

  <p>"Nobody else would have thought of that," he said. He measured the heavy
  shoulders of Silver with his eyes. "And nobody else would have had the
  strength to do it, even if he had thought about the trick. But if I can get
  my chance at Barry Christian and Gregor, maybe I could partly pay you back
  that way, Jim!"</p>

  <p>"Steady," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He had stripped off his clothes and wrung them in his powerful hands, the
  water spurting out in strong, muddy jets. Now he pulled on the damp things
  again. The wind still was blowing in gusts, not steadily. The rain rushed
  downward in great volleys. Sometimes drops fell hissing into the fire around
  which Silver had begun again to roast rabbit meat.</p>

  <p>"We're comfortable enough here," said Silver. "And Christian is groaning
  now. He's lost you. His trap has been sprung, and the she-wolf is gone.
  Whisper, they call her. She's gone, and Frosty and she are hitting it for the
  tall timber somewhere, side by side. That means that Christian is as far as
  ever from your uncle's gold mine. He's lost Whisper, and that means that he's
  lost his first real chance at Frosty."</p>

  <p>"What turned the she-wolf loose? I know they call her Whisper. What turned
  her loose?"</p>

  <p>"I did. That's why I left you with Parade."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you kill her?" asked Gary. "They have the dogs, and the dogs
  still will know her scent. They ran her down before, and they'll run her down
  again. That pack will trail and catch any wolf in the world except Frosty.
  You should have killed her, chief."</p>

  <p>Silver drew a long breath and shook his head ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should," he admitted. "But just then it seemed to me that she'd
  won a right to run a little longer beside Frosty. Gold mine or no gold
  mine&mdash;cattle killing or not&mdash;Frosty has some of the makings of a
  gentleman, Alec. Anyway, Barry Christian is the worst wolf of the lot!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; SURROUNDED</h2>

  <p class="first">IT rained all of seven days. It rained as the sky can only
  in the mountains. The winds held steadily in the northwest, carrying vast
  masses of water vapor in toward the heights, where the currents were forced
  upward, the mist congealed to drops, and mile-deep clouds disgorged their
  contents swiftly, continuously.</p>

  <p>The sound of the rivers increased all through the land. The forests were
  sodden. The grasses were pale. A million little rivulets, running day and
  night, carried yellow detritus down the slopes, and in the ravines the creeks
  were white with eager speed, and the rivers they joined kept thundering with
  increasing voices.</p>

  <p>There was rain by day and rain by night. Only now and again was there a
  pause as the clouds broke up for an hour or more. The lowlands were flooded.
  Worst danger of all, now and then a cloudburst filled a number of upper
  ravines all in an hour, and sent the contents hurtling down into the narrows
  of some greater valley, a wall of water, a great bore that whittled the trees
  off the banks, shaved away the banks themselves, reached out casual hands
  here and there, and flicked cabins and all their contents into the basins of
  the streams.</p>

  <p>But all through this bad weather Frosty was the happiest wolf in the Rocky
  Mountains. On the night when his mate was delivered from the second mortal
  peril of her life, he had heard her howl of freedom, of release, and of
  yearning, and he had come to her as to a star. After that he had marched
  straight across the mountains, passing right out of his known range into
  strange country. He had turned the next day and come back into his own
  country, to a point a full thirty miles away from his former abode with his
  mate. And on that day he had found a young and foolish deer in the higher
  hills, and he had taught his mate the delightful game of deer hunting.</p>

  <p>Wolves do the trick by knowing the habits of a deer, which runs full speed
  for a certain length of time, and then, if not followed closely, turns off
  the trail sharply to one side or the other, and is apt to lie down and try to
  make itself invisible in the woods until it has regained its breath.</p>

  <p>The trick consists in spotting the deer and then posting a hunter at
  either end of the approximate course in which it is expected that the venison
  will run. Frosty was an old master of the art, not because he had had help
  before in doing the thing, but because he more than once had studied the
  devices of others of his kind from some high place, and had waited until the
  kill before he descended to rob the victors of their prize.</p>

  <p>There was nothing that Frosty liked so much as meat that had been warmed
  for him by the labors of others!</p>

  <p>Now he had a mate faster than himself on foot, though not so enduring,
  and, though she had not his brains, she was at least a good pupil and a
  faithful follower. So he took her down the valley, posted her, returned to
  the deer, and gave the animal a good flying start toward the she-wolf. That
  deer ran through the valley three miles like a raging wind. At the end of the
  three miles Whisper sprang up.</p>

  <p>She headed the deer right back up the valley, and the hunted beast, with
  not a doubt that it was the same wolf which, wing-footed, had managed to head
  her off, came hurling back up the valley, only to find big Frosty, fresh and
  well rested, all prepared for her.</p>

  <p>She knew then that she had been tricked, and broke straight up the valley
  slope to get to new ground; but six miles of sprinting will kill the heart of
  even a strong deer; she lasted another five miles or so, with Frosty at her
  heels. Then he cut her down, called Whisper, and would not taste a morsel
  until Whisper had come running up and been received by his red laugh of
  welcome.</p>

  <p>The deer was the beginning of a streak of good luck and astute hunting
  which kept their larder filled, and though Frosty kept thinking of the fat
  lowlands where the scent of game was crossed by the odor of man and steel, he
  refrained from leading his mate down on another expedition. Her eyes were
  still uneasy. In her sleep she moaned and twitched her legs, still fleeing
  from man in her dreams.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, there was no sight, or sound, or smell of the dog pack
  that had caught her once before, but on the seventh day after her escape the
  keen ear of Frosty, which was always studying the sounds of the mountains and
  dissolving them into their component parts, detected the baying of dogs.</p>

  <p>He knew the hateful chorus and leaped to his feet. His mate jumped to his
  side with her mane bristling. She held her head high, exactly like his, and
  then she made out the gloomy music in the distance once more.</p>

  <p>Her red length of tongue hung out. She began to pant, and with her
  shifting, bright eyes she searched for shelter. There would not be much run
  in her this time. Terror would freeze up the strength of her limbs quickly;
  fear would constrict her breathing.</p>

  <p>So Frosty headed for the best water hazard that he knew anything
  about.</p>

  <p>Wolves don't like water, but neither do dogs. Frosty headed straight for
  the Purchass River, whose valley splits the Blue Waters in a long knife
  stroke. What Frosty wanted to do was to enter the current and swim down it a
  considerable distance until he would reach a series of low sand bars that ran
  out from the farther shore. There he could land and wade ashore into thick
  brush.</p>

  <p>Twice before this he had shaken off persistent hunters after his scalp by
  the same maneuver, and though he was not one to duplicate his measures in
  times of need, he felt assured that this was the trick to get Whisper away
  from the dogs with the least expenditure of effort.</p>

  <p>So he jogged overland with her. On the high verge of the Purchass ravine
  he paused and looked over the ragged mountains through which they had just
  come, and listened to the hateful singing of the dog pack far away. Then he
  took Whisper zigzagging down the side of the canyon to the flat ground beside
  the water.</p>

  <p>The stream was high. It had swollen to such a degree that it was eating
  away the banks on both sides. Even as he watched, he saw a young willow tree
  topple, sink, and then whirl away down the creek.</p>

  <p>That was a bad sign. When things whirled in running water it meant that
  there are undertows, cross-currents, all sorts of things that will pull down
  a wolf, no matter how strong a swimmer he may be. Frosty had almost drowned
  one day in water that to the casual eye seemed almost perfectly calm. That
  had taught him to watch with care the movement of anything that floated on
  the face of a stream before he ventured into it.</p>

  <p>It had been his plan to take to the water almost at once, so as to make a
  greater gap between the point where he entered the creek and the place at
  which he left it.</p>

  <p>Now he hesitated so long that at last he heard the cry of the dog pack
  open on the heights above him. That started him forward again.</p>

  <p>He decided that he would run down around the bend where the creek was
  joined by two small tributaries and swelled out, at certain seasons of the
  year, into quite a river. So he headed forward with Whisper and turned the
  bend.</p>

  <p>He was troubled even before he came in sight of the new picture. The air
  trembled with noises such as he had never heard in this valley before. Was it
  merely sound that worked on him, or was there really a slight shuddering of
  the rocks over which he ran?</p>

  <p>Then he ran around the bend and had full view of a very strange picture
  indeed. The whole place was so changed that he could hardly recognize it. It
  filled him with fear to find such alteration. It was like dreaming a thing
  small and finding it big. The creek he had seen much swollen above its usual
  size, but it was nothing compared with the two tributaries which here joined
  the main channel. They came bounding out of their ravines like endless chains
  of wild horses, throwing heads and manes, and neighing all together on a deep
  note of thunder.</p>

  <p>Seven days of steady rain had turned the trick. And still there were great
  black clouds to the northwest sweeping down to hide the tops of the
  mountains, pouring continual floods out of the sky. To carry away those
  floods the courses of the creeks hardly sufficed. They were crowded. Old
  banks had been ripped away. Still the throats of the creeks were gorged. The
  booming and the dashing noises were something hardly to be believed.</p>

  <p>And the shallows where Frosty had trusted that he could land? Well, there
  was a good, big, fat-sided island below the junction a little distance, and
  now that island had been whittled away until it lifted a transparent streak
  of foliage only. Frosty could look right through the brush and the trees to
  the bright frothing of the water beyond.</p>

  <p>But the noise was worse than the alteration of the scene. The noise
  stunned him. However, it was no time for hesitation now. If he could not use
  the river as a water hazard, he would have to foot it down the valley as fast
  as he could run, and then cut back up the slope as soon as the sheer rock
  cliffs diminished to angles that he could climb. There was a cave that
  tunneled through half a mile of darkness in the bosom of Thunder Mountain,
  and offered one small exit on the other side of the peak. He would take
  Whisper there. In the narrows of the dark passage he could fight off the dogs
  for a time, at least, and after Whisper was rested, he could go on again with
  her.</p>

  <p>However, he was already very troubled as he turned down the stream once
  more, and it was then that danger rose up and struck against his eyes close
  by. For issuing out of a side pass a mile down the canyon came two riders,
  the sun flashing on their naked rifles!</p>

  <p>Frosty bared his teeth in a snarl as he understood. They had divined, with
  their crafty human brains, that he was heading across country toward the
  valley of the Purchass. Therefore they had divided their forces. The dog
  pack, which was now sending its cry right down the ravine toward the
  fugitives, had stuck close to the scent. The two riders had taken horse and
  rifle by a short way to the lower valley, hoping to head off the
  fugitives.</p>

  <p>And they had done it! On one side Frosty had the high, sheer face of the
  rock wall of the valley. Behind him came the dogs. Before him rode the
  riflemen.</p>

  <p>On the other side there was the deadly rush and swirling of the water!</p>

  <p>But the other three things meant certain death. The water was the least
  terrible choice of all. He hunched his shoulder against Whisper and forced
  her toward the brink of the stream. She flashed about at him, her eyes green
  with dangerous light, but in a moment she understood, and obediently, but
  trembling, stepped down into the stream.</p>

  <p>The water was not very cold&mdash;but what force it had! It was tugging
  and pulling as though in anger before Frosty was knee-deep. However, it had
  to be endured. He stuck out his head and hurled himself forward in a long
  skimming dive. The water closed over him. A trick of the current started him
  rolling. He came up, thoroughly soaked, half blinded, and saw Whisper still
  tumbling and struggling in the same cross-catch of the water.</p>

  <p>Now she righted, saw him, and tried to swim to him, with panic in her
  eyes. The currents caught her and thrust her away. She began to struggle
  blindly. So Frosty headed deliberately toward her, though she was closer to
  the shore; and up that shore came two riders, rifles ready, gesticulating.
  And from the head of the ravine ran the dog pack.</p>

  <p>Well, those hunters would never get their dogs into such water as
  this&mdash;not even when the prey was in full sight!</p>

  <p>Whisper, when Frosty was close to her, mastered her panic once more and
  struck out more steadily. They inched away from the bank. Sometimes the
  riffles of the water covered their heads. Sometimes the currents would catch
  at them and throw them bodily forward at great speed. Sometimes they tried to
  dodge as shooting logs, the wreckage from forest far back in the mountains,
  slid past them. Sometimes those logs were rolling rapidly. Sometimes the
  currents started Frosty rolling, too.</p>

  <p>They had rounded the bend. The two riflemen were riding the bank,
  watching. It was strange that the shooting had not started!</p>

  <p>It seemed certain that Frosty could not reach the head of the almost
  washed-out island. He would have to strike it somewhere on the flank.</p>

  <p>Then he found a streak of white water that rushed him straight down past
  the entire length of the island and left him floundering, very tired and
  breathless, in the middle of the stream below the island. He knew that he
  could not swim back to either shore from that position. But there was one
  sudden hope that appeared before his eyes. Right down the stream, a half mile
  away, loomed the broad forehead of another island, rather close to the left
  bank. He might be able to make that point.</p>

  <p>But another sight stunned and bewildered him a moment later. For on the
  left bank of the stream he saw two riders, and one of them sat on the back of
  a horse that shone like a statue of gold. Frosty was hemmed in on either
  side, before and behind. He felt that he had come at last to the day of his
  death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE VOICE OF MAN</h2>

  <p class="first">DESPAIR made Frosty stop swimming for a moment, and his
  mate, in that interval, moved past him with a steady stroke. She swam well,
  very well. She seemed to be less paralyzed with panic, when she was in the
  water, than she had been on the dry land. Frosty took heart at once and drew
  level with her.</p>

  <p>Guns were firing across the river. Bullets were chipping, now, at the
  water through which he progressed, as though the men of the dog pack realized
  that there was some ghost of a chance that Frosty might reach the island and
  escape through the brush and the trees.</p>

  <p>Other guns fired from the opposite bank, though none of those bullets
  struck the water.</p>

  <p>Then the gunfire continued, but not a single slug of lead touched Frosty
  or the river water about him.</p>

  <p>He discovered, when he raised his head for a glance around, that the men
  and the horses and the dogs all had disappeared behind shrubs or rocks on
  both sides of the river. The firing continued&mdash;but not at Frosty. Was it
  possible that the men were shooting at one another?</p>

  <p>The brain of Frosty could not quite understand. But what he did understand
  was that though his body and his struggling legs were very tired, it no
  longer seemed impossible to reach the island. Despair left him. If he had had
  to swim the distance, he would have been lost, he knew, but his swimming was
  only a small assistance to the strong current that drove him straight on
  toward the island. It was not big. It was very low of land. It was covered
  with straggling brush and a few small trees. But to Frosty it looked finer
  than any delightful hunting lands that ever he had traveled in his life.</p>

  <p>The shooting, whirling current that continually rolled him under was now a
  blessing. He was willing to submit to its buffeting, for it was throwing him
  toward his goal.</p>

  <p>His mate had begun to tire badly. Now and again she turned her head slowly
  toward him, her body slewing around a little. But there was not far to
  travel. The water shoaled suddenly away. Before them the current was curling
  against rocks and some half-drowned shrubs. As the firm bottom came under his
  feet, Frosty found himself so tired that he could hardly lift his weight. The
  water seemed a familiar and helpful element now, and the air was hostile,
  giving no support whatever.</p>

  <p>The she-wolf could hardly support herself. She went forward, wabbling and
  staggering, as bullets, in a sudden flight, sang through the air about them,
  bit the water, crackled through the brush, thudded against the rocks. The men
  from the dog pack had opened fire again!</p>

  <p>Whisper got into the safety of the low brush. Frosty leaped after her,
  gathering his strength desperately for the effort. It was while he was in the
  air that a bullet from Barry Christian's rifle struck him. The slug went
  right through his hind quarters. He fell forward, sprawling.</p>

  <p>There was not much pain. There was only a numbness, and his hind legs
  would not obey his will. They would not move. He lay in the brush bewildered.
  He turned his head and snapped at the air as though at a fly.</p>

  <p>Whisper came up to him, whimpering, smelled his blood, drew back, and sat
  down to howl.</p>

  <p>Then the pain began.</p>

  <p>It started with the wound and ran down in cold electric shudderings to his
  hind toes. It thrust upward in hot gripings into his entrails. He knew as
  well as a man could have known that something ought to be done, but he could
  not tell what.</p>

  <p>He wanted darkness, quiet, the stillness of a cave. So he dragged himself
  forward, working hard with his forelegs and pulling the weight of his body
  after him. He worked himself in this fashion through the brush and up a rise
  to the top of the only small eminence of land on the island.</p>

  <p>Through gaps in the brush and the trees he could see the river on both
  sides of him. The water was running with a great, foaming rush toward the
  side of the river from which he had swum. On the other side the extent of the
  river was almost as great, but it seemed shallower, and the currents did not
  thrust with such boiling force. That was the side of the man with the golden
  horse, the man who had been twice so close to Frosty that by closing his eyes
  and shrinking his sensitive nostrils a little the wolf could remember him
  perfectly.</p>

  <p>Whisper came and licked one of the wounds. She stood back, shaking her
  head like a doctor that gives up a case. For the blood kept on welling out.
  Frosty half closed his eyes and sniffed at the wound in his turn. The blood
  kept on coming. It had a hot smell. He knew the scent of his own blood, and
  that scent was sickening to him. It brought cold fear into his heart.</p>

  <p>He lay still. His heart was beating rapidly, shaking his body against the
  ground. And the pain was terrible. It ate at his nerves, corroded his
  strength and courage, made him want to howl the death song. But he kept the
  voice back. He had learned the value of silence.</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes shut. He wanted darkness, and felt that in the black of
  the night everything might be well for him.</p>

  <p>Then Whisper came, with a snarl humming in the back of her throat. She was
  stiff on her toes, her mane ruffing up; she looked exactly as though she were
  going to attack him, but then he followed the direction in which her head
  pointed, and he was able to see, through the brush, that the golden stallion
  had been ridden down into the river. It was swimming with powerful strokes
  toward the island, and the man was with it.</p>

  <p>Man was coming&mdash;and for Frosty there was no further flight! He lifted
  his fore quarters, but the agony that ran through his hind legs was so great
  that he had to lie down again. His red eyes commenced to blink, as though he
  were facing a powerful light; death was, in fact, what he was
  confronting.</p>

  <p>He lost sight of the swimmers when they were close to the island;
  presently Whisper, with a whimper, slunk away through the brush. Noises of
  cracklings through the shrubbery approached. The wind brought the odor of
  man, of the man. With it was the smell of the wet horse, of gunpowder, and of
  steel. Shudderings went through Frosty. He lifted his head, turned it toward
  the enemy, and waited. His short ears pricked up. There was nothing to tell
  that he was in a panic of terror. There was nobility in Frosty, and
  therefore, when the pinch came, he knew how to face death.</p>

  <p>And so, through the brush, came the image of the man, shadowy, broken
  across by the small branches, and at last standing in clear day before
  Frosty. Frosty locked his jaws.</p>

  <p>"A dead one!" said Jim Silver. Then he added: "Poor devil!"</p>

  <p>He walked around the great wolf, staring at the ground. Frosty disdained
  to turn his head to watch. He would not even strain to look out of the
  corners of his eyes. For, of course, the man would do what Frosty would have
  done&mdash;go behind and take a helpless enemy from the blind rear.</p>

  <p>It was better to lie like that, head up and neck rigid, pretending not to
  see or hear, pretending all was a pleasant daydream. Presently a gun would
  speak.</p>

  <p>"Where's your mate, Frosty?" said the voice of the man. "Has she run
  off?"</p>

  <p>It was a strange sound. The vibration of the human voice ran all through
  the body of Frosty, along with his pain. He had heard human voices many a
  time before, but never a voice with such a quality in it. There was in it
  something that he vaguely recognized as kindness. When his mother spoke in
  the cave in the ancient days, or when she had scolded and warned in the days
  of his cub hunting, there had been a touch of the same quality in the tone.
  Frosty recognized it only vaguely. There is no kindness from an enemy. For
  enemies one has a sharp tooth. It is the law of the wild. And no tooth is as
  sharp as the tooth of man, no mercy is so small as his.</p>

  <p>Well, the end was coming.</p>

  <p>"Bleeding very fast&mdash;bleeding to death!" said Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>He walked around to the front of Frosty, pulled out a revolver, and
  leveled it. Silver was wet and wringing with water. It coursed down him in
  small rivulets, and the sun, looking out from between a pair of clouds,
  turned him to a form of fire bright as the flame of a hearth, bright as the
  sun on still water.</p>

  <p>But Frosty did not blink his eyes at the brightness or at the death which
  was leveled at him. He kept his head high. His great heart was swelling in
  him. His jaws were locked. He had turned himself into steel to meet the
  end.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it," said Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>His voice had been like a hiss. He lowered the gun.</p>

  <p>Now, if Whisper had brains and courage together, she might steal out of
  the brush where she lurked and take the man from behind, cutting him down by
  the legs or striking at the back of the neck. But Whisper would not do
  that!</p>

  <p>It was strange to see the gun lower in the hand of the man. Perhaps, of
  course, man intended to play with him, prolonging the agonies of his
  death.</p>

  <p>Well, that was permitted, also. That was another law of the realm. And
  Frosty remained like a rock.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'll even fight," said Jim Silver. "I think the fight's
  out of you, because you won't make a fool of yourself in a lost cause."</p>

  <p>He walked around behind Frosty and came right up to his hind quarters.
  Frosty didn't move. He might wrench himself around with a great effort and
  strike with his fangs at the enemy, but it was likely to be a futile
  blow.</p>

  <p>He lay still. There was a rending sound, loud and sharp in the air. Jim
  Silver was tearing clothes into long strips for a bandage. Under a thick bush
  he found some deep, dry dust. He came back with some of the dust and crouched
  right over Frosty; and Frosty would not turn his head. Pain had nailed him to
  the ground&mdash;pain and helplessness. Oh, if the four feet were under him,
  how quickly he would have slashed for the softness of the throat of terrible
  man&mdash;and then how he would have rushed away for safety! How he would
  have whipped through the brush to rejoin Whisper, to plunge again into the
  water!</p>

  <p>But the voice of man kept on speaking. It was like the flowing of a
  stream. A strange kindness kept soaking out of it and into the mind and heart
  of Frosty. It was the caress before the death stroke, no doubt!</p>

  <p>Then a bandage was worked under Frosty's hind quarters. A handful of dust
  was laid over the mouth of one wound to clot the blood. The bandage was drawn
  tight and tighter. It was painful only in the first moment. After that the
  pressure was soothing. It pulled the lips of the wound together. And Frosty
  knew that the blood was no longer flowing from that open mouth, dribbling his
  life away.</p>

  <p>Then the wise hands of man turned him. Ah, that was an agony, to be sure.
  Frosty dropped his head suddenly and let it rest on his paws. The second
  bandage was passed under him, the second handful of dust was laid over the
  mouth of that more gaping wound where the bullet had issued from the flesh.
  The bandage drew tight with a pang that seemed to split the very heart of
  Frosty. His head whipped around like the head of a snake, at inescapable
  speed, and he caught the arm of Jim Silver in his teeth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; A PARTNER</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was that famous right hand of Silver that was endangered.
  But it was not yet lost. A wolf usually strikes with his teeth as a man
  strikes with a sword&mdash;a gashing blow with the point, or the edge. But
  something had checked Frosty in the last instant, and he only gripped the arm
  in a vice, without breaking the skin. Red hatred blurred his eyes, but still
  they could see clearly enough, and if Jim Silver had moved a hand or twitched
  so much as a muscle, the fangs of Frosty would have crunched against the
  bone. There would have been an end of Silver indeed, a crippled wreck that
  his enemies could have devoured soon with consummate ease.</p>

  <p>But all that Silver stirred was his voice, that kept on in the steady
  stream, and softened the fighting rage of Frosty, and sank again into his
  brain, into his heart.</p>

  <p>There was neither fear nor anger in the eyes of Jim Silver. Those were
  calm, all-watchful, brooding eyes, considering the wolf and understanding
  him.</p>

  <p>He was not even calling himself a fool for taking the chance. He had had
  no rope with him to tie down the brute, and unless something were done, the
  life would rapidly leak out of that great body.</p>

  <p>Why not let the life run away? Well, that would be an easy question to
  ask. It would have been easily answered, also, Jim Silver felt, by any man
  who had seen Frosty fighting for his mate, by any man who saw him waiting
  calmly, head high, for his death.</p>

  <p>Big shudders of weakness ran through the body of Frosty. Suddenly he
  relaxed his hold and let the right hand of Jim Silver go, but he kept his
  head turned and ready, and waiting to strike one of those wise hands to the
  bone.</p>

  <p>Yes, with a tooth he had scratched the skin, and not for the first time
  the taste of the blood of man was sweet in his mouth. A hot slaver overflowed
  the lips of Frosty and drooled down from his mouth. The green devil was
  bright in his eyes once more. Urges kept rushing over him in waves, and a
  thin thread was all that held him back. And the voice of man continued gently
  in the ears and in the brain of Frosty.</p>

  <p>The sound of it or the memory of it would never leave him. It would be
  present in his soul from that day forward, and make of the neighborly
  mountains a solitude for him where he had always reigned supreme as a
  king.</p>

  <p>But Frosty could not know that. Such things were working in him as never
  had troubled him before. And always there was the emotion that had never been
  in him since the days when his mother ran with her litter, giving them
  gentleness and care. But this? It was beyond all the laws of kind!</p>

  <p>The hands of man pressed the dust over the wound again slowly. The red
  blood soaked into it, clotted it, appeared through it as a thin stain. More
  dust was heaped on. It was incredibly soft on the raw flesh. As the bandages
  were drawn again there was, as before, one thrust of pain, and after that
  there followed such a release from torment that the breathing of Frosty began
  to make a steady sound, like snoring.</p>

  <p>The second bandage was drawn tight in that manner. The pain continued, but
  only a ghost of its old self. The bleeding had stopped. The life drain no
  longer carried away the strength of Frosty on a steady ebb.</p>

  <p>The hand of man moved out to him. He smelled it with a keenly critical
  nose. The scent of his own blood and hair and hide was thick on it. He had
  suddenly no desire to strike that hand.</p>

  <p>Good had been done him. He could not understand. He could only feel and
  know that good had flowed out to him from those hands. The gentleness of the
  voice was not a liar. There was other tenderness in this world than in the
  care of a mother wolf.</p>

  <p>The hand went straight on toward his eyes. Frosty snarled so that his
  entire body vibrated. The hand hung suspended in the air. He stopped
  snarling. The hand moved toward him again. Once more he snarled. A wild burst
  of savagery almost mastered him, weakened, ebbed away from its full tide.</p>

  <p>What is there to fear or hate in a thing that can be stopped by a mere
  growl?</p>

  <p>He let the hand touch him, and it rested with weight and with warmth on
  the top of his head.</p>

  <p>If it covered his eyes, he would rend the arm. He would catch it in the
  softness of the flesh beneath the elbow, and he would tear it. He would slash
  through the big blood vessels, and with his wrenching tug of head and
  shoulders he would jerk the man closer and then get at the tenderness of the
  throat.</p>

  <p>The whole body of man was tender, easily rent by teeth. Frosty could tell
  that. Jim Silver was naked to the waist now, after turning his clothes into
  bandages. The teeth of Frosty tingled with eagerness as he saw game so easy.
  And if his eyes were covered for an instant&mdash;</p>

  <p>He waited, teeth bared, silent. But his eyes were not covered. The hand
  passed down his head, softly, steadily. The voice went on, always running
  through the heart of Frosty as the sound of running water passes into the
  heart of a thirsty wolf on a summer's day.</p>

  <p>But the thirst which was beginning in Frosty on this day might never be
  assuaged.</p>

  <p>The voice of Jim Silver was saying softly: "Now that I've got my hand on
  your head you're mine. I'll have you coming to my voice, watching me at
  night, following my shadow, waiting for my step, listening for my voice. I'll
  make you mine from the tip of your tail to the light in your eyes. Frosty,
  you've found a partner. I'll belong to you from my toes to my brain. We'll
  work together, travel together, hunt together and fight the same enemies. Oh,
  it'll be a wise man who can keep his trail from me now. I won't have to trust
  my eyes, but your nose. I won't have to see in the dark, because I'll have
  you with me. You to show me the way, Parade to carry me&mdash;and Barry
  Christian has come very close to his last day!"</p>

  <p>He slipped his hand down the neck of the wolf to the collar and unbuckled
  it. As he was withdrawing the bright weight, impulse made Frosty grip the arm
  of the man again.</p>

  <p>But this time he retained his hold for only a moment. He let that arm go
  free, and saw the man stand up and away from him.</p>

  <p>Consider this with the brain of a wolf. All men in the world shoot bullets
  at wolves&mdash;all saving one.</p>

  <p>All men try to run them down with horses and catch them in ropes&mdash;all
  men save one.</p>

  <p>All men seed the earth with traps, so that the fleshless jaws may grip a
  wolf by the leg&mdash;all men save one.</p>

  <p>But from the hands of one man there comes the easing of pain, the sound of
  a voice that causes courage and confidence to course through the heart.</p>

  <p>Frosty lay still, with his head stretched on the ground. All that he was
  aware of it would be impossible to say, but most of all he knew that strange
  eyes had been on him, taking hold of his brain.</p>

  <p>Big Jim Silver had the little compartment of the collar open now. He took
  out a twist of stained, oiled silk. He spread out the paper that it contained
  and commenced reading:</p>

  <p>Thunder Mountain on the right; Chimney Peak on the left. I face Mount
  Wigwam. A ledge of black rock&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was blood on the paper. That was the blood of Bill Gary, and it was
  still red.</p>

  <p>Silver read the directions again, printed them deep in his mind. But in
  the meantime there was Alec Gary to be considered, for to him the gold should
  belong.</p>

  <p>He took from a pocket of his torn coat a bit of pencil and wrote beneath
  the sprawling writing of the dead man:</p>

  <p>Go and get men to help you. I inclose two hundred dollars to pay them
  their hire. Go to the spot that your uncle described, locate the mine, and
  register your claims. I am staying on here. Don't ask me why. I'll see you
  when I have a chance. Don't wait for me until the flood sinks. I'm not
  leaving this spot for a good many days.</p>

  <p>JIM SILVER.</p>

  <p>After he had written that, he got his water-soaked wallet, counted out the
  money, wrapped it with the note inside the oiled silk, and found that he was
  barely able to inclose the whole within the compartment in the collar.</p>

  <p>Then he walked down through the trees to the edge of the river and waved
  his hand. There was an instant signal from behind a rock on the farther
  shore, some thirty yards away. For here the secondary channel of the stream
  deepened and narrowed. It was Alec Gary who ventured to show himself, though
  cautiously. For the men of Barry Christian were beyond the island.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver took a step forward, swung his arm, and hurled the heavy collar
  high and far. It flattened out in the air. It spun around and around,
  flashing like a straight sword. And it fell actually beyond Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>Alec ran back to it, leaned over it.</p>

  <p>A moment later he was dancing like a madman, flinging up his arms.</p>

  <p>Silver, smiling a little, turned slowly back through the brush. He felt
  that the proper half was being fitted to that interrupted day which had been
  broken through by the death of Bill Gary. And once again fortune had evaded
  the skillfully grasping hands of Barry Christian.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; FLOOD WATERS</h2>

  <p class="first">SILVERcarried on his saddle a small hand ax with an
  adjustable and folding handle of steel tubing. He used that ax to fell some
  boughs and saplings. He made a deep bed, piled it beside the wounded wolf,
  leaned over Frosty, and lifted him onto the bed.</p>

  <p>That is one way of telling it.</p>

  <p>Another way is to admit that it took him twenty-four hours of persuading,
  stroking, talking, trying, before he was permitted to take the massive, loose
  weight of the big wolf in his arms and lift it onto the evergreen boughs.</p>

  <p>Once he had that bed under Frosty he had some assurance that the big
  fellow might get well eventually.</p>

  <p>In the meantime he had to get food. But that was not a hard task. There
  were plenty of rabbits on the island. Before flood time it was twenty times
  as large as the surface now above water, and therefore twenty times as much
  life as usual was crowded onto its face. There were plenty of rabbits. There
  were plenty of snakes, too. After he discovered the numbers of them, Silver
  dared not venture into the woods except by day, and then only with the very
  greatest care.</p>

  <p>But he got a rabbit for the wolf and another for himself the first
  day.</p>

  <p>The great Frosty would not even sniff at meat killed by another than
  himself. He merely turned his head and looked at the glorious figure of
  Parade, where the stallion grazed at the side of the clearing. This was the
  sort of fodder that Frosty had a taste for.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver brought up water in his hat. Frosty would not even glance at
  it, though terrible thirst burned him.</p>

  <p>So Silver waited another day. He understood the thing perfectly, but there
  was nothing to do about it.</p>

  <p>He waited three days before Frosty, lying faint and dying, deigned to
  accept water from the hat.</p>

  <p>He waited another whole day, though famine made the ribs of the wolf
  stare, before Frosty, with snarling, disgusted lips, bared his teeth and bit
  into a rabbit.</p>

  <p>But he ate one rabbit that day and two the next&mdash;rabbits freshly
  killed, warm with life still, as a proper wolf demands to have his food. And
  so he passed that important event&mdash;the taking of food which he had not
  killed with his own fangs.</p>

  <p>The days went on. The bandages were changed, re-changed, again and again.
  Water was heated in the hollow of a rock and the wounds washed. They were
  healing swiftly, but still Frosty was too wise to attempt to move, for deep
  inside him there were torn tendons, ripped flesh, and grazed bones. He lay
  still and accepted the attendance of the man.</p>

  <p>Silver used to come and put a hand on his head and look straight down into
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I serve you to-day, and you serve me to-morrow," he would say.</p>

  <p>But there was never much sign from Frosty. He had the forbidding exterior
  which is fitting for a king. It was a startling revelation to Jim Silver when
  the first token of affection was given.</p>

  <p>He had torn his hand on a thorn, a deep and ragged wound, and as he was
  offering the great wolf a freshly killed rabbit that day, Frosty turned from
  the meat to the raw wound on the hand of Silver and licked it carefully,
  gently, with his eyes half closed.</p>

  <p>Not until he seemed to think that that small hurt had received sufficient
  attention would Frosty start eating. To Silver it was like a miracle. He knew
  from that moment how strong his hold on the wolf had become.</p>

  <p>Then bad luck struck at them again. The storm no longer touched the island
  even with its outer fringe. There had been days of clear, open weather. But
  up in the higher mountains of the northwest, still the thick haze of the
  rains continued. A flood piled up, rushed out of the smaller canyons, and
  raised the Purchass River five feet in five minutes. That water sent down a
  solid wall that traveled as fast as a trotting horse. It hit the island and
  literally tore away the head of it. The big trees were ripped out by the
  roots with a sound like thunder-clouds tearing in two. And a shooting wave of
  water came up over the hillock on which Parade and Silver and the wounded
  wolf had been living.</p>

  <p>And Whisper crawled out from the brush, more afraid of the raging water
  than of man. She lay down at the side of Frosty, crouching herself small
  against him, and showing her needle-sharp teeth to Silver. She was not the
  only thing that came. Half a dozen rattlesnakes came sliding and slipping
  away from the flood, and never sounded the alarm once when they came to other
  living things.</p>

  <p>The water was deep, and had a current. Silver saddled Parade, got on him,
  and then hauled up Frosty to keep him from the wet. Silver would never forget
  that moment. For it was the real introduction of Parade to Frosty. The
  loathing between them was perfect. And now the wolf lay on the back of the
  stallion, snarling with hate, and shivering with the blood lust, while Parade
  quaked with horror under the weight of the beast of prey.</p>

  <p>The wall of water receded. It left the island pretty well ruined, and very
  much smaller. Whisper sneaked first of all away from the hillock to go back
  to her rabbit hunting, and her noisy mourning for the fellowship of Frosty by
  night. The rattlesnakes slithered away through the brush, and Silver was able
  to continue his life as before.</p>

  <p>There were no dull moments. It was true that Frosty could not move his
  hind quarters, but his head was free. He might never rise and walk again, but
  he was able to use his mind. And Silver worked it constantly. With all of
  Frosty's wisdom and savage cunning and myriad cruelties, he had the heart of
  a happy puppy. He liked a game as well as a murder.</p>

  <p>He learned to catch a rock or a stick. He got so that he could catch a
  ten-pound chunk of wood thrown from short range about as hard as Silver could
  fling it. Frosty's snaky head would dart out to meet the flying weight, and
  with a side twist of his head and his supple, strong neck, he would break the
  shock of the impact. He could catch the same lump when it was tossed high in
  the air above his head. He learned, also, a complicated vocabulary of signs
  and gestures and words and whistles.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, as Silver ran through their antics together, the eyes of Frosty
  would brighten and dance, his head went high, and he looked like a dog about
  to bark. But when his throat swelled and his body shook with the desire to
  utter some pleasant sound, all he could bring out was a horrifying growl.</p>

  <p>Frosty lay there for many long days before Silver saw him stand. There was
  no preparation; there was no warning, no elaborate approach to the feat. But
  Silver opened his eyes one morning and saw the great wolf on his feet and
  tottering toward the brush. He started as Silver stood up, and Frosty looked
  around at him green-eyed, with a hideous snarl.</p>

  <p>Silver merely laughed at him. He went up to Frosty and patted his head. He
  got to work on the hind legs and massaged them carefully. And in three more
  days Frosty was walking freely and easily. After that his strength came back
  to him with a rush.</p>

  <p>He was with Whisper at night, but all the day long he was with Silver. The
  reason was that there was always something to occupy his attention when he
  was with the man. There were endless games. Among the trees, high in the
  branches, or in some nest of rocks, Silver would hide himself and give the
  signal for the hunt with one thin whistle. And always Frosty worked out the
  most complicated trail problem in a few moments and sat down with his red
  laughter in front of his man.</p>

  <p>Frosty learned how to flush game, how to work through the brush to make
  the rabbits come scattering out before the gun of man, where they would
  surely fall. He learned how to take the reins of Parade and lead him, Parade
  shuddering with horror, and the wolf with fighting rage. He learned how to
  fetch and carry, how to hear a whisper and obey it.</p>

  <p>When Frosty seemed to have four strong legs under him at last, Jim Silver
  got on Parade and forded the river at the shallows, for the water had sunk
  far after the last flood. Frosty followed him over. Frosty followed him right
  on to the town of Blue Waters, and there he sat down on a hill and canted his
  head to one side as Silver continued into the place. Whisper came sneaking
  out and tried to draw her mate back into the woods, away from the fatal and
  strange trail of man, and Jim Silver, glancing over his Shoulder, saw her
  trying her wiles.</p>

  <p>But he let her have her way and went on into the town.</p>

  <p>The news of Alec Gary's gold strike would be in everybody's mouth, of
  course. There had been plenty of time for Alec to reach the mine, locate it,
  file his claim, and start taking out the dust from the rock. There had been
  plenty of time for Alec to do all of these things and finally to go back up
  the Purchass River to a certain island where he had last seen Jim
  Silver&mdash;the Jim Silver who had placed a fortune in his hands.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Alec would be glad to forget all about Jim Silver's aid. There was
  grim curiosity in the heart of Silver as he started to make inquiries.</p>

  <p>But in five minutes he was something more than curious. For Alec Gary had
  never got to the town of Blue Waters on the day when he left Jim Silver. Not
  a man in the town had seen him; certainly he had not appeared to hire men or
  to file a claim!</p>

  <p>What had become of him? Silver knew the answer. Barry Christian had
  blocked the way!</p>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE SEARCH</h2>

  <p class="first">SILVER went back to the hill where he had left Frosty, and
  found the great wolf lying exactly where he had been at first; off through
  the brush, with a thin sound of rustling, went Whisper.</p>

  <p>Silver, looking Frosty in the eye, wondered how long the charm would last.
  Wolves, most people said, could never be tamed. They would revert to the
  wild. But for the short time that this companionship might endure&mdash;so
  long, perhaps, as the memory of his recent wounds was fresh in the head of
  Frosty&mdash;it was a wonderful thing to Silver. And he sat there by the
  wolf, smoking a cigarette and working out his plan.</p>

  <p>Alec Gary had been in a frenzy of excitement when he received the words of
  his uncle. No doubt he had mounted his horse and ridden like mad straight for
  the town of Blue Waters. He could not have had any other destination. He
  would have gone on a straight line. And what would that straight line have
  been?</p>

  <p>Silver charted it in his mind, and then rode it on Parade, with Frosty
  running on ahead, hunting sights and sounds, reading the scents that traveled
  the wind.</p>

  <p>The way from Blue Waters to the island on the Purchass River cut straight
  across high land, and skirted the head of a box canyon where a creek tumbled
  noisily over a sheer wall of rock. Or if Gary were not familiar with the
  country, he might have cut straight across the canyon without skirting the
  head of it; the slopes on either side were not at all difficult. So Silver
  rode down into the canyon.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the little valley worth looking at except the
  scattered bones of a horse that were whitening in the sun. Silver would have
  ridden on, except that Frosty poked into a patch of thick shrubbery and
  turned back to eye his master until Silver came to the place.</p>

  <p>There he found something that was worth while indeed. It was the battered
  wreckage of a range saddle which was ripped and torn as if it had been passed
  through a mill. A mill with water in it, to judge by the way the sun had
  curled and warped the tattered fragments of the leather. But what mattered
  most to Jim Silver was the way some of the saddle strings had been knotted.
  By those knots, he knew that it was the saddle of Alec Gary that he was
  seeing!</p>

  <p>Those bones, then, were the bones of Alec's horse; and Alec
  himself?&mdash;well, his body could have been concealed anywhere about the
  valley. There were a thousand rock piles in any one of which he might have
  been buried, while Barry Christian, and Gregor, and Thurston, armed with the
  secret of the mine, went straight to their quarry!</p>

  <p>Silver went there, too. He spent a day getting to Thunder Mountain, and
  locating, by means of Chimney Peak and Mount Wigwam, the ledge of black
  stone. He found the broken place where Bill Gary had blasted away the outer
  part of the ledge. He saw the rich glistening of the gold itself, but there
  was no token that any one had been working the mine.</p>

  <p>Alec Gary might be as dead as his horse, but apparently Christian had not
  stolen his secret!</p>

  <p>Back to the ravine of the dead horse and the saddle went Jim Silver, and
  spent another day going over it from the bottom to the head. Frosty helped
  him hunt, not that Frosty knew what was wanted, but because it was plain to
  him that man was hunting; so, while Frosty worked here and there, calling
  attention to a dead bird here, and a nest of mice there, Whisper lurked on
  the edge of the horizon all day, and came close at night with mournful
  howlings.</p>

  <p>It was on the evening of the last day of the search that Frosty himself
  howled short and sharp from the head of the valley, and Silver saw him
  sitting on a ridge just under the waterfall. He climbed to the place. There
  was not much to be seen&mdash;just one spot staining the whiteness of the
  rock, and one little sparkling point of metal from which Frosty lifted the
  foot he had placed on it. Silver picked the thing up and started, for it was
  the rowel of a spur that had been broken from its wheel.</p>

  <p>That stain on the rock, to judge by the bristling of the wolf as he
  sniffed it, might be blood. Then, had horse and rider fallen here from the
  edge of the height above? Had the rider struck on the ledge while the horse,
  toppling farther out, had dashed down onto the boulders of the creek and been
  swept along in the water to the point where unknown hands had pulled it out
  from the stream, stripped off the saddle, and dropped the saddle for hiding
  into the brush?</p>

  <p>What people would have done those things? Who except Barry Christian and
  his crew; and might not their rifle bullets have been the cause of the fall
  in the first place?</p>

  <p>Frosty had run off down the ledge, sniffing here and there at a dabbling
  of other spots on the rock. Silver followed. The trail led up from the ledge
  to the level above, and worked a short distance over the gravel before Frosty
  had to give it up. After all, it was many days old.</p>

  <p>Silver could merely take the general direction and follow it. For perhaps
  Alec when he was hurt by his fall, had managed to get rid of the paper that
  contained the secret of the mine's position. Perhaps he had been picked up by
  Christian and carried to some spot where he could be properly "persuaded" to
  talk about the situation of the mine.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Silver rode a mile into the trees, paused, circled widely and
  vainly for sign, and then was forced to camp for the night. He was up with
  the dawn, and searching again. And in the bright, cool prime of the morning
  he came out into a clearing before a little trapper's shack and saw a
  grizzled old fellow seated in a chair that had been rudely fashioned out of
  the stump of a tree. He puffed at a clay pipe and greeted Silver with a
  grunt.</p>

  <p>He had seen nothing of any stranger, he said. He knew nothing. He wanted
  to know nothing.</p>

  <p>While he was still uttering his denials, a strained voice cried inside the
  shack: "Chimney Peak&mdash;I face Mount Wigwam&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's the man I want!" said Silver.</p>

  <p>The trapper stood up with a shotgun in his hands.</p>

  <p>"There's been some mean skunks on his trail, whoever he is," he said.
  "Maybe you're one of 'em. Back up, son. I ain't slaved over that kid all
  these days to chuck him away to the first gent that comes askin' for him. Who
  are you?"</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver," he answered.</p>

  <p>"The devil you are," said the trapper. "And I'm Napoleon, eh? Pull off
  your hat, if you're Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>His glance shifted, at the same moment, to the shining beauty of that
  famous horse, Parade. Then, as Silver obediently removed his hat, the trapper
  stared at the little gray spots above the temples, like incipient horns. And
  he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"By thunder, you are Jim Silver. Come on inside this place and see what we
  can do for the kid. He's better, but he ain't well!"</p>

  <p>Not well? No, he lay like a pale ghost of himself, all the upper part of
  his face bone-white and frightfully thin, and all the lower half of his face
  black with beard. But he heard the voice of Silver, and it made him sit up
  suddenly and throw out both hands in a great gesture of appeal. Silver took
  hold of one of those hands and sat down beside the bed. And there he remained
  day after day until the fever wore out of Alec Gary.</p>

  <p>When he could tell his story, it was very simple. He had, as Silver
  suspected, ridden like a madman, straight for Blue Waters to get good men and
  take them to the mine. And on the way, as he climbed his horse up the
  highlands, Barry Christian and Gregor had appeared in his rear, riding hard.
  Gary had fled. His mustang had held out well, but as he was passing near the
  head of the box canyon, a rifle bullet had knocked the mustang sprawling.
  Right over the edge of the cliff it had fallen, while Gary, with broken bones
  and torn body, lay by the grace of chance on the ledge close to the
  falls.</p>

  <p>Christian and Gregor, riding down into the valley, had dragged the body of
  the horse out of the stream; perhaps had taken for granted that the body of
  the rider had simply disappeared in the water, lodged under some projecting
  rock. Perhaps, like Jim Silver, they had not even seen the little cross-ledge
  near the falls.</p>

  <p>All that day, after his fall, Gary had not dared to move, though he felt
  himself dying. But in the night he had dragged himself up from the ledge and
  managed to get into the trees. There the trapper had found him, quite out of
  his wits with fever, the morning after.</p>

  <p>It had been a hard job to pull him through. But cracked ribs will mend;
  mountain air breathes strength into the blood; and it was not many days after
  that before Jim Silver sat on a fallen tree and looked down a great slope to
  the place where the black ledge crossed the mountain, and where men were now
  moiling and toiling with a great clangoring of single jacks and double jacks
  against the drill heads. Young Alec Gary was in charge, walking here and
  there, by far the happiest man in the world.</p>

  <p>Not that he claimed all the mine for himself. No; he wanted to give to Jim
  Silver half of the place, at least. Whatever Jim Silver would take was his.
  All of it, Gary swore, really should go to the only man in the world who
  could have checkmated Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>But Silver, staring down the mountainside, found himself not altogether
  pleased by the clamoring that broke the gigantic peace of the uplands.</p>

  <p>He whistled softly, and something stirred in the brush behind him. Without
  turning his head, he smiled. For he knew perfectly well that it was
  Frosty.</p>

  <p>He pulled an envelope from his pocket and scribbled on the back of it:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR ALEC: I'm going on. I have Frosty, and you have the
  mine. I can't take any part of it because there's blood on it&mdash;Bill
  Gary's blood. He died trying to pass the mine on to you, not to me. Now you
  have what he wanted you to have. It would only be bad luck for me, if I
  should take a slice.<br>
  <br>
  I'm saying good-by this way because otherwise I know that I'd have an
  argument with you. So long and good luck.<br>
  <br>
  JIM SILVER.</p>

  <p>He put the envelope on a rock, weighted it with a stone, and climbed on
  Parade. Frosty jumped out of the brush, and, with a meaning toss of the head,
  led the way across the mountain to a small clearing, where Jim Silver saw the
  bones of huge dogs, or wolves, scattered on the pine needles. There were
  several rusted traps, and the teeth of one still held the hind leg bone of
  one of the dead.</p>

  <p>Frosty, sitting down on the edge of the clearing, could not be persuaded
  even by all the coaxing of his master to put foot inside the place. So at
  last Silver rode on with Parade.</p>

  <p>His way led north and west, through those mountains from which the floods
  had been rolling down so steadily not long before. As he rode, the big wolf,
  Frosty, took the way before him and seemed to guess at the direction in which
  his master was traveling.</p>

  <p>Right through the day they journeyed, and in the evening, as they went
  down a valley, the voice of Whisper cried sadly from the height behind
  them.</p>

  <p>Frosty put himself right across the trail and faced Silver. And Silver
  understood in this an ultimatum&mdash;that the bounds of Frosty's range had
  been crossed; that his mate would not leave the right domain; that Jim
  Silver, if he wished to keep the wolf, must stay in the wolf's land.</p>

  <p>Silver understood, and without one word of persuasion, one call, one
  appeal, he rode Parade straight past Frosty and down into the thickening
  darkness of the lower valley.</p>

  <p>There he camped in a thicket of big trees, and it seemed to him for the
  first time in years that it was a lonely thing to live with a horse alone in
  the wilderness. It seemed to him, as he sat dozing by the small fire, his
  chin on his fist, that he would give a great deal to have the wise head and
  the hazel eyes of the wolf to look at again. However, he felt that it was
  better this way. The wolf could not leave his kind. And after all, to live
  with any man was to live in bondage.</p>

  <p>Then, lifting his heavy eyes, Silver saw a monstrous form sitting opposite
  him, with the firelight making a sheen of the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Frosty!" he exclaimed. "Have you left her, son? Have you come to me?"</p>

  <p>And Frosty looked up into the mysterious face of man and laughed his red
  laughter. For he was content.</p>
