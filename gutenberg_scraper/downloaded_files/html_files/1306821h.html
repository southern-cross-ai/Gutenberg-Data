     name="pre"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="first">A READER of history in its various epochs in different
  countries, comes upon eccentric individuals and extraordinary events, lightly
  passed over, may be, as not materially affecting the continuity of history,
  as not producing any seriously disturbing effect on its course. Such persons,
  such events have always awakened interest in myself, and when I have come on
  them, it has been my pleasure to obtain such details concerning them as were
  available, and which would be out of place in a general history as
  encumbering it with matter that is unimportant, or of insufficient importance
  to occupy much space. Two of the narratives contained in this work have
  appeared already in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, but I have considerably
  enlarged them by the addition of fresh material; some of the others came out
  in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and one in <i>Belgravia</i>. With only
  two of them&mdash;"Peter Nielsen" and "A Wax-and-Honey Moon"&mdash;are the
  authorities somewhat gone beyond and the facts slightly dressed to assume the
  shape of stories.<br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BATHURST</h2>

  <p class="first">THE mystery of the disappearance of Benjamin Bathurst on
  November 25, 1809, is one which can never with certainty be cleared up. At
  the time public opinion in England was convinced that he had been secretly
  murdered by order of Napoleon, and the <i>Times</i> in a leader on January
  23, 1810, so decisively asserted this, that the <i>Moniteur</i> of January 29
  ensuing, in sharp and indignant terms repudiated the charge. Nevertheless,
  not in England only, but in Germany, was the impression so strong that
  Napoleon had ordered the murder, if murder had been committed, that the
  Emperor saw fit, in the spring of the same year, solemnly to assure the wife
  of the vanished man, on his word of honour, that he knew nothing about the
  disappearance of her husband. Thirty years later Varnhagen von Ense, a
  well-known German author, reproduced the story and reiterated the accusation
  against Napoleon, or at all events against the French. Later still, the
  <i>Spectator</i>, in an article in 1862, gave a brief sketch of the
  disappearance of Bathurst, and again repeated the charge against French
  police agents or soldiers of having made away with the Englishman. At that
  time a skeleton was said to have been discovered in the citadel of Magdeburg
  with the hands bound, in an upright position, and the writer of the article
  sought to identify the skeleton with the lost man.[1]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1] The discovery of a skeleton as described was denied
  afterwards by the Magdeburg papers. It was a newspaper sensational paragraph,
  and unfounded.</p>

  <p>We shall see whether other discoveries do not upset this identification,
  and afford us another solution of the problem&mdash;What became of Benjamin
  Bathurst?</p>

  <p>Benjamin Bathurst was the third son of Dr. Henry Bathurst, Bishop of
  Norwich, Canon of Christchurch, and the Prebendary of Durham, by Grace,
  daughter of Charles Coote, Dean of Kilfenora, and sister of Lord Castlecoote.
  His eldest brother, Henry, was Archdeacon of Norwich; his next, Sir James,
  K.C.B., was in the army and was aide-de-camp to Lord Wellington in the
  Peninsula.</p>

  <p>Benjamin, the third son of the bishop, was born March 14, 1784,[2] and had
  been secretary of the Legation at Leghorn. In May, 1805, he married Phillida,
  daughter of Sir John Call, Bart., of Whiteford, in Cornwall, and sister of
  Sir William Pratt Call, the second baronet. Benjamin is a Christian name that
  occurs repeatedly in the Bathurst family after the founder of it, Sir
  Benjamin, Governor of the East India Company and of the Royal African
  Company. He died in 1703. The grandfather of the subject of our memoir was a
  Benjamin, brother of Allen, who was created Baron in 1711, and Earl in
  1772.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[2] Register of Baptisms, Christchurch, Oxford, 1784,
  March 14, Benjamin, s. of Henry Bathurst, Canon, and Grace his wife, born,
  and bap. April 19.</p>

  <p>Benjamin had three children: a son who died, some years after his father's
  disappearance, in consequence of a fall from a horse at a race in Rome; a
  daughter, who was drowned in the Tiber; and another who married the Earl of
  Castlestuart in 1830, and after his death married Signor Pistocchi.</p>

  <p>In 1809, early in the year, Benjamin was sent to Vienna by his kinsman,
  Earl Bathurst, who was in the ministry of Lord Castlereagh, and, in October,
  Secretary of State for the Foreign Department. He was sent on a secret
  embassy from the English Government to the Court of the Emperor Francis. The
  time was one of great and critical importance to Austria. Since the Peace of
  Pressburg she had been quiet; the Cabinet of Vienna had adhered with cautious
  prudence to a system of neutrality, but she only waited her time, and in 1808
  the government issued a decree by which a militia, raised by a conscription,
  under the name of the "<i>Landwehr</i>," was instituted, and this speedily
  reached the number of 300,000 men. Napoleon, who was harassed by the
  insurrection in the Peninsula, demanded angrily an explanation, which was
  evaded. To overawe Austria, he met the Emperor Alexander of Russia at
  Erfurth, and the latter when sounded by Austria refused to have any part in
  the confederation against Napoleon. England, in the meantime, was urging
  Austria to cast down the gauntlet. In pledge of amity, the port of Trieste
  was thrown open to the English and Spanish flags. In December, a declaration
  of the King of England openly alluded to the hostile preparations of Austria,
  but the Cabinet at Vienna were as yet undecided as to the course they would
  finally adopt. The extreme peril which the monarchy had undergone already in
  the wars with Napoleon made them hesitate. England was about to send fifty
  thousand men to the Peninsula, and desired the diversion of a war in the
  heart of Germany. Prussia resolved to remain neutral. Napoleon rapidly
  returned from Spain, and orders were despatched to Davoust to concentrate his
  immense corps at Bamberg; Massena was to repair to Strasburg, and press on to
  Ulm; Oudenot to move on Augsburg, and Bernadotte, at the head of the Saxons,
  was to menace Bohemia. It was at this juncture that Benjamin Bathurst hurried
  as Ambassador Extraordinary to Vienna, to assure the Cabinet there of the
  intentions of England to send a powerful contingent into Spain, and to do all
  in his power to urge Austria to declare war. Encouraged by England, the
  Cabinet of Vienna took the initiative, and on April 8 the Austrian troops
  crossed the frontier at once on the Inn, in Bohemia, in Tyrol, and in
  Italy.</p>

  <p>The irritation and exasperation of Napoleon were great; and Bathurst, who
  remained with the Court, laboured under the impression that the Emperor of
  the French bore him especial enmity, on account of his exertions to provoke
  the Austrian Ministry to declaration of war. Whether this opinion of his were
  well founded, or whether he had been warned that Napoleon would take the
  opportunity, if given him, of revenging himself, we do not know; but what is
  certain is, that Bathurst was prepossessed with the conviction that Napoleon
  regarded him with implacable hostility and would leave no stone unturned to
  compass his destruction.</p>

  <p>On July 6 came the battle of Wagram, then the humiliating armistice of
  Znaim, which was agreed to by the Emperor Francis at Komorn in spite of the
  urgency of Metternich and Lord Walpole, who sought to persuade him to reject
  the proposals. This armistice was the preliminary to a peace which was
  concluded at Schönbrun in October. With this, Bathurst's office at Vienna
  came to an end, and he set out on his way home. Now it was that he repeatedly
  spoke of the danger that menaced him, and of his fears lest Napoleon should
  arrest him on his journey to England. He hesitated for some time which road
  to take, and concluding that if he went by Trieste and Malta he might run the
  worst risks, he resolved to make his way to London by Berlin and the north of
  Germany. He took with him his private secretary and a valet; and, to evade
  observation, assumed the name of Koch, and pretended that he was a travelling
  merchant. His secretary was instructed to act as courier, and he passed under
  the name of Fisher. Benjamin Bathurst carried pistols about his person, and
  there were firearms in the back of the carriage.</p>

  <p>On November 25, 1809, about midday, he arrived at Perleberg, with
  post-horses, on the route from Berlin to Hamburg, halted at the post-house
  for refreshments, and ordered fresh horses to be harnessed to the carriage
  for the journey to Lenzen, which was the next station.</p>

  <p>Bathurst had come along the highway from Berlin to Schwerin, in
  Brandenburg, as far as the little town of Perleberg, which lies on the
  Stepnitz, that flows after a few miles into the Elbe at Wittenberge. He might
  have gone on to Ludwigslust, and thence to Hamburg, but this was a
  considerable détour, and he was anxious to be home. He had now before him a
  road that led along the Elbe close to the frontier of Saxony. The Elbe was
  about four miles distant. At Magdeburg were French troops. If he were in
  danger anywhere, it would be during the next few hours&mdash;that is, till he
  reached Dömitz. About a hundred paces from the post-house was an inn, the
  White Swan, the host of which was named Leger. By the side of the inn was the
  Parchimer gate of the town, furnished with a tower, and the road to Hamburg
  led through this gate, outside of which was a sort of suburb consisting of
  poor cottagers' and artisans' houses.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Bathurst went to the Swan and ordered an early dinner; the horses
  were not to be put in till he had dined. He wore a pair of grey trousers, a
  grey frogged short coat, and over it a handsome sable greatcoat lined with
  violet velvet. On his head was a fur cap to match. In his scarf was a diamond
  pin of some value.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had finished his meal, Bathurst inquired who was in command
  of the soldiers quartered in the town, and where he lodged. He was told that
  a squadron of the Brandenburg cuirassiers was there under Captain Klitzing,
  who was residing in a house behind the Town Hall. Mr. Bathurst then crossed
  the market place and called on the officer, who was at the time indisposed
  with a swollen neck. To Captain Klitzing he said that he was a traveller on
  his way to Hamburg, that he had strong and well-grounded suspicions that his
  person was endangered, and he requested that he might be given a guard in the
  inn, where he was staying. A lady who was present noticed that he seemed
  profoundly agitated, that he trembled as though ague-stricken, and was unable
  to raise a cup of tea that was offered him to his lips without spilling
  it.</p>

  <p>The captain laughed at his fears, but consented to let him have a couple
  of soldiers, and gave the requisite orders for their despatch; then Mr.
  Bathurst rose, resumed his sable overcoat, and, to account for his nervous
  difficulty in getting into his furs again, explained that he was much shaken
  by something that had alarmed him.</p>

  <p>Not long after the arrival of Mr. Bathurst at the Swan, two Jewish
  merchants arrived from Lenzen with post-horses, and left before
  nightfall.</p>

  <p>On Mr. Bathurst's return to the inn, he countermanded the horses; he said
  he would not start till night. He considered that it would be safer for him
  to spin along the dangerous portion of the route by night when Napoleon's
  spies would be less likely to be on the alert. He remained in the inn writing
  and burning papers. At seven o'clock he dismissed the soldiers on guard, and
  ordered the horses to be ready by nine. He stood outside the inn watching his
  portmanteau, which had been taken within, being replaced on the carriage,
  stepped round to the heads of the horses&mdash;<i>and was never seen
  again</i>.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that this was at the end of November. Darkness had
  closed in before 5 P.M., as the sun set at four. An oil lantern hung across
  the street, emitting a feeble light; the ostler had a horn lantern, wherewith
  he and the postillion adjusted the harness of the horses. The landlord was in
  the doorway talking to the secretary, who, as courier, was paying the
  account. No one particularly observed the movements of Mr. Bathurst at the
  moment. He had gone to the horses' heads, where the ostler's lantern had
  fallen on him. The horses were in, the postillion ready, the valet stood by
  the carriage door, the landlord had his cap in hand ready to wish the
  gentleman a "lucky journey;" the secretary was impatient, as the wind was
  cold. They waited; they sent up to the room which Mr. Bathurst had engaged;
  they called. All in vain. Suddenly, inexplicably, without a word, a cry, an
  alarm of any sort, he was gone&mdash;spirited away, and what really became of
  him will never be known with certainty.</p>

  <p>Whilst the whole house was in amazement and perplexity the Jewish
  merchants ordered their carriage to be got ready, and departed.</p>

  <p>Some little time elapsed before it was realised that the case was serious.
  Then it occurred to the secretary that Mr. Bathurst might have gone again to
  the captain in command to solicit guards to attend his carriage. He at once
  sent to the captain, but Mr. Bathurst was not with him. The moment, however,
  that Klitzing heard that the traveller had disappeared, he remembered the
  alarm expressed by the gentleman, and acted with great promptitude. He sent
  soldiers to seize the carriage and all the effects of the missing man. He
  went, in spite of his swollen neck, immediately to the Swan, ordered a
  chaise, and required the secretary to enter it; he placed a cuirassier and
  the valet on the box, and, stepping into the carriage, ordered it to be
  driven to the Golden Crown, an inn at the further end of the town, where he
  installed the companions of Bathurst, and placed a soldier in guard over
  them. A guard was also placed over the Swan, and next morning every possible
  search was made for the lost man. The river was dragged, outhouses, woods,
  marshes, ditches were examined, but not a trace of him could be found. That
  day was Sunday. Klitzing remained at Perleberg only till noon, to wait some
  discovery, and then, without delay, hurried to Kyritz, where was his
  commandant, Colonel Bismark, to lay the case before him, and solicit leave to
  hasten direct to Berlin, there to receive further instructions what was to be
  done.</p>

  <p>He was back on Monday with full authority to investigate the matter.</p>

  <p>Before he left he had gone over the effects of Mr. Bathurst, and had
  learned that the fur coat belonging to him was missing; he communicated this
  fact to the civil magistrate of the district, and whilst he was away search
  was instituted for this. It was the sable coat lined with violet velvet
  already mentioned, and this, along with another belonging to the secretary,
  Fisher was under the impression had been left in the post-house.</p>

  <p>The amazing part of the matter is that the city authorities&mdash;and,
  indeed, on his return, Captain Klitzing&mdash;for a while confined themselves
  to a search for the fur coat, and valuable time was lost by this means.
  Moreover, the city authorities, the police, and the military were all
  independent, and all jealous of each other. The military commander, Klitzing,
  and the burgomaster were in open quarrel, and sent up to headquarters charges
  against each other for interference in the matter beyond their rights. The
  head of the police was inert, a man afterwards dismissed for allowing
  defalcation in the monies entrusted to him. There was no system in the
  investigation, and the proper clues were not followed.</p>

  <p>On December 16th, two poor women went out of Perleberg to a little fir
  wood in the direction of Quitzow, to pick up broken sticks for fuel. There
  they found, a few paces from a path leading through the wood, spread out on
  the grass, a pair of trousers turned inside out. On turning them back they
  observed that they were stained on the outside, as if the man who had worn
  them had lain on the earth. In the pocket was a paper with writing on it;
  this, as well as the trousers, was sodden with water. Two bullet holes were
  in the trousers, but no traces of blood about them, which could hardly have
  been the case had the bullets struck a man wearing the trousers. The women
  took what they had found to the burgomaster. The trousers were certainly
  those of the missing man. The paper in the pocket was a half-finished letter
  from Mr. Bathurst to his wife, scratched in pencil, stating that he was
  afraid he would never reach England, and that his ruin would be the work of
  Count d'Entraigues, and he requested her not to marry again in the event of
  his not returning.</p>

  <p>The English Government offered £1,000 reward, and his family another
  £1,000; Prince Frederick of Prussia, who took a lively interest in the
  matter, offered in addition 100 Friedrichs d'or for the discovery of the
  body, or for information which might lead to the solution of the mystery, but
  no information to be depended upon ever transpired. Various rumours
  circulated; and Mrs. Thistlethwaite, the sister of Benjamin Bathurst, in her
  Memoirs of Dr. Henry Bathurst, Bishop of Norwich, published by Bentley in
  1853, gives them. He was said to have been lost at sea. Another report was
  that he was murdered by his valet, who took an open boat on the Elbe, and
  escaped. Another report again was that he had been lost in a vessel which was
  crossing to Sweden and which foundered about this time. These reports are all
  totally void of truth. Mrs. Thistlethwaite declares that Count d'Entraigues,
  who was afterwards so cruelly murdered along with his wife by their Italian
  servant, was heard to say that he could prove that Mr. Bathurst was murdered
  in the fortress of Magdeburg. In a letter to his wife, dated October 14,
  1809, Benjamin Bathurst said that he trusted to reach home by way of Colberg
  and Sweden. D'Entraigues had been a French spy in London; and Mrs.
  Thistlethwaite says that he himself told Mrs. Bathurst that her husband had
  been carried off by <i>douaniers-montés</i> from Perleberg to Magdeburg, and
  murdered there. This it is hard to believe.</p>

  <p>Thomas Richard Underwood, in a letter from Paris, November 24, 1816, says
  he was a prisoner of war in Paris in 1809, and that both the English and
  French there believed that the crime of his abduction and murder had been
  committed by the French Government.</p>

  <p>The <i>European Magazine</i> for January, 1810, says that he was
  apparently carried off by a party of French troops stationed at Lenzen, but
  this was not the case. No French troops were on that side of the Elbe. It
  further says, "The French Executive, with a view to ascertain by his papers
  the nature of the relations subsisting between this country and the Austrian
  Government, has added to the catalogue of its crimes by the seizure, or
  probably the murder, of this gentleman."</p>

  <p>If there had been French troops seen we should have known of it; but none
  were. Every effort was made by the civil and military authorities to trace
  Bathurst. Bloodhounds were employed to track the lost man, in vain. Every
  well was explored, the bed of the Stepnitz thoroughly searched. Every
  suspicious house in Perleberg was examined from attic to cellar, the gardens
  were turned up, the swamps sounded, but every effort to trace and discover
  him was in vain.</p>

  <p>On January 23, 1810, in a Hamburg paper, appeared a paragraph, which for
  the first time informed the people of Perleberg who the merchant Koch really
  was who had so mysteriously vanished. The paragraph was in the form of a
  letter, dated from London, January 6, 1810&mdash;that is, six weeks after the
  disappearance. It ran thus: "Sir Bathurst, Ambassador Extraordinary of
  England to the Court of Austria, concerning whom a German newspaper, under
  date of December 10, stated that he had committed suicide in a fit of
  insanity, is well in mind and body. His friends have received a letter from
  him dated December 13, which, therefore, must have been written after the
  date of his supposed death."</p>

  <p>Who inserted this, and for what purpose? It was absolutely untrue. Was it
  designed to cause the authorities to relax their efforts to probe the
  mystery, and perhaps to abandon them altogether?</p>

  <p>The Jewish merchants were examined, but were at once discharged; they were
  persons well-to-do, and generally respected.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that Mr. Bathurst had committed suicide? This was the view
  taken of his disappearance in France, where, in the <i>Moniteur</i> of
  December 12, 1809, a letter from the correspondent in Berlin stated: "Sir
  Bathurst on his way from Berlin showed signs of insanity, and destroyed
  himself in the neighbourhood of Perleberg." On January 23, 1810, as already
  said, the <i>Times</i> took the matter up, and not obscurely charged the
  Emperor Napoleon with having made away with Mr. Bathurst, who was peculiarly
  obnoxious to him.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, the fur coat had been found, hidden in the cellar of a
  family named Schmidt, behind some firewood. Frau Schmidt declared that it had
  been left at the post house, where she had found it; and had conveyed it
  away, and given it to her son Augustus, a fellow of notoriously bad
  character. Now, it is remarkable that one witness declared that she had seen
  the stranger who had disappeared go out of the square down the narrow lane in
  which the Schmidts lived, and where eventually the fur coat was found. When
  questioned, Augustus Schmidt said that "his mother had told him the stranger
  had two pistols, and had sent her to buy him some powder. He supposed
  therefore that the gentleman had shot himself." Unfortunately the conflict of
  authorities acted prejudicially at this point, and the questions how the
  Schmidts came to know anything about the pistols, whether Frau Schmidt really
  was sent for powder, and whether Bathurst was really seen entering the alley
  in which they lived, and at what hour, were never properly entered into.
  Whatever information Klitzing obtained, was forwarded to Berlin, and there
  his reports remain in the archives. They have not been examined.</p>

  <p>Fresh quarrels broke out between Klitzing and the Burgomaster, and
  Klitzing instead of pursuing the main investigations, set to work to
  investigate the proceedings of the Burgomaster. So more time was lost.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, November 30th, that is to say, five days after the
  disappearance of Bathurst, Captain Klitzing ordered the town magistrates; 1.
  To have all ditches and canals round the place examined; 2. To have the
  neighbourhood of the town explored by foresters with hounds; 3. To let off
  the river Stepnitz and examine the bed. Then he added, "as I have ascertained
  that Augustus Schmidt, who is now under arrest for the theft of the fur coat,
  was <i>not at home at the time that the stranger disappeared</i>, I require
  that this fact be taken into consideration, and investigated"&mdash;and this,
  as far as we can ascertain, was not done; it was just one of those valuable
  clues which were left untraced.</p>

  <p>The whole neighbourhood was searched, ditches, ponds, the river bed,
  drains, every cellar, and garden, and nothing found. The search went on to
  December 6, and proved wholly resultless. It was not till December 16 that
  the trousers were found. It is almost certain that they were laid in the
  Quitzow wood after the search had been given over, on December 6th.</p>

  <p>As nothing could be proved against the Schmidt family, except that they
  had taken the fur coat, Frau Schmidt and her son were sentenced to eight
  weeks' imprisonment.</p>

  <p>The matter of the pistols was not properly cleared up. That, again, was a
  point, and an important point that remained uninvestigated.</p>

  <p>The military authorities who examined the goods of Mr. Bathurst declared
  that nothing was missing except the fur cloak, which was afterwards
  recovered, and we suppose these pistols were included. If not, one may be
  sure that some notice would have been taken of the fact that he had gone off
  with his pistols, and had not returned. This would have lent colour to the
  opinion that he destroyed himself. Besides no shot was heard. A little way
  outside the gateway of the town beyond the Swan inn is a bridge over the
  small and sluggish stream of the Stepnitz. It was possible he might have shot
  himself there, and fallen into the water; but this theory will not bear
  looking closely into. A shot fired there would certainly have been heard at
  night in the cottages beside the road; the river was searched shortly after
  without a trace of him having been found, and his trousers with bullet holes
  made in them after they had been taken off him had been discovered in another
  direction.</p>

  <p>The <i>Moniteur</i> of January 29 said: "Among the civilised races,
  England is the only one that sets an example of having bandits[3] in pay, and
  inciting to crime. From information we have received from Berlin, we believe
  that Mr. Bathurst had gone off his head. It is the manner of the British
  Cabinet to commit diplomatic commissions to persons whom the whole nation
  knows are half fools. It is only the English diplomatic service which
  contains crazy people."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[3] When, in 1815, Napoleon was at St. Helena, on his
  first introduction to Sir Hudson Lowe, he addressed the governor with the
  insulting words, "Monsieur, vous avez commandé des brigands." He alluded to
  the Corsican rangers in the British service, which Lowe had commanded.</p>

  <p>This violent language was at the time attributed to Napoleon's dictation,
  stung with the charge made by the <i>Times</i>, a charge ranking him with
  "vulgar murderers," and which attributed to him two other and somewhat
  similar cases, that of Wagstaff, and that of Sir George Rumbold. It is very
  certain that the <i>Moniteur</i> would not have ventured on such insulting
  language without his permission.</p>

  <p>In April Mrs. Bathurst, along with some relatives, arrived in Perleberg.
  The poor lady was in great distress and anxiety to have the intolerable
  suspense alleviated by a discovery of some sort, and the most liberal offers
  were made and published to induce a disclosure of the secret. At this time a
  woman named Hacker, the wife of a peasant who lived in the shoe-market, was
  lying in the town gaol&mdash;the tower already mentioned, adjoining the White
  Swan. She was imprisoned for various fraudulent acts. She now offered to make
  a confession, and this was her statement:</p>

  <p class="quote">"A few weeks before Christmas I was on my way to Perleberg
  from a place in Holstein, where my husband had found work. In the little town
  of Seeberg, twelve miles from Hamburg, I met the shoemaker's assistant
  Goldberger, of Perleberg, whom I knew from having danced with him. He was
  well-dressed, and had from his fob hanging a hair-chain with gold seals. His
  knitted silk purse was stuffed with louis d'ors. When I asked him how he came
  by so much money, he said, 'Oh, I got 500 dollars and the watch as hush-money
  when the Englishman was murdered.' He told me no more particulars, except
  that one of the seals was engraved with a name, and he had had that altered
  in Hamburg."</p>

  <p>No credit was given to this story, and no inquiry was instituted into the
  whereabouts of Goldberger. It was suspected that the woman had concocted it
  in the hopes of getting Mrs. Bathurst to interest herself in obtaining her
  release, and of getting some of the money offered to informers.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bathurst did not return immediately to England; she appealed to
  Napoleon to grant her information, and he assured her through Cambacières,
  and on his word of honour, that he knew nothing of the matter beyond what he
  had seen in the papers.</p>

  <p>So the matter rested, an unsolved mystery.</p>

  <p>In Prussia, among the great bulk of the educated, in the higher and
  official classes, the prevailing conviction was that Napoleon had caused the
  disappearance of Bathurst, not out of personal feeling, but in political
  interests, for the purpose of getting hold of the dispatches which he was
  believed to be conveying to England from the Austrian Government. The murder
  was held to be an accident, or an unavoidable consequence. And in Perleberg
  itself this was the view taken of the matter as soon as it was known who the
  stranger was. But then, another opinion prevailed there, that Klitzing had
  secretly conveyed him over the frontier, so as to save him from the spies,
  and the pursuit which, as he and Bathurst knew, endangered the safety of the
  returning envoy.</p>

  <p>In Perleberg two opinions were formed, by such as conceived that he had
  been murdered, as to the manner in which he had been made away with.</p>

  <p>Not far from the post-house was at the time a low tavern kept by Hacker,
  who has been mentioned above; the man combined shoemaking with the sale of
  brandy. Augustus Schmidt spent a good deal of his time in this house. Now
  shortly after this affair, Hacker left Perleberg, and set up at Altona, where
  he showed himself possessed of a great deal of money. He was also said to
  have disposed of a gold repeater watch to a jeweller in Hamburg. This was
  never gone into; and how far it was true, or idle rumour, cannot be said. One
  view was that Bathurst had been robbed and murdered by Hacker and
  Schmidt.</p>

  <p>The other opinion was this. Opposite the post-house was a house occupied
  at the time by a fellow who was a paid French spy; a man who was tried for
  holding secret communication with the enemy of his Fatherland. He was a petty
  lawyer, who stirred up quarrels among the peasants, and lived by the result.
  He was a man of the worst possible character, capable of anything. The
  opinion of one section of the people of Perleberg was, that Bathurst, before
  entering the carriage, had gone across the square, and had entered into
  conversation with this man, who had persuaded him to enter his door, where he
  had strangled him, and buried him in his cellar. The widow of this man on her
  death-bed appeared anxious to confess something, but died before she could
  speak.</p>

  <p>In 1852 a discovery was made at Perleberg which may or may not give the
  requisite solution.</p>

  <p>We may state before mentioning this that Captain Klitzing never believed
  that Bathurst had been spirited away by French agents. He maintained that he
  had been murdered for his money.</p>

  <p>On April 15, 1852, a house on the Hamburg road that belonged to the mason
  Kiesewetter was being pulled down, when a human skeleton was discovered under
  the stone threshold of the stable. The skeleton lay stretched out, face
  upwards, on the black peat earth, covered with mortar and stone chips, the
  head embedded in walling-stones and mortar. In the back of the skull was a
  fracture, as if a blow of a heavy instrument had fallen on it. All the upper
  teeth were perfect, but one of the molars in the lower jaw was absent, and
  there were indications of its having been removed by a dentist. The house
  where these human remains were found had been purchased in 1834 by the mason
  Kiesewetter from Christian Mertens, who had inherited it from his father,
  which latter had bought it in 1803 of a shoemaker. <i>Mertens, the father,
  had been a serving man in the White Swan at the time of the disappearance of
  Mr. Bathurst.</i></p>

  <p>Inquiry was made into what was known of old Mertens. Everyone spoke highly
  of him as a saving, steady man, God-fearing; who had scraped together during
  his service in the Swan sufficient money to dower his two daughters with
  respectively £150 and £120. After a long illness he had died, generally
  respected.</p>

  <p>Information of the discovery was forwarded to the Bathurst family, and on
  August 23, Mrs. Thistlethwaite, sister of Benjamin, came to Perleberg,
  bringing with her a portrait of her brother, but she was quite unable to say
  that the skull that was shown her belonged to the missing man, whom she had
  not seen for forty-three years. And&mdash;no wonder! When Goethe was shown
  the skull of his intimate friend Schiller he could hardly trace any likeness
  to the head he remembered so well. Mrs. Thistlethwaite left, believing that
  the discovery had no connection with the mystery of her brother's
  disappearance, so ineradicably fixed in the convictions of the family was the
  belief that he had been carried away by French agents.</p>

  <p>However, let us consider this discovery a little closer, and perhaps we
  shall be led to another conclusion.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the skeleton was that of a man who had been murdered
  by a blow on the back of his head, which had fractured the skull. It had been
  stripped before being buried, for not a trace of clothing could be found.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the house of the Mertens family lay on the Hamburg road, on the
  way to Lenzen, outside the Parchimer Gate, only three hundred paces from the
  White Swan. In fact, it was separated from the White Swan only by the old
  town-gate and prison tower, and a small patch of garden ground.</p>

  <p>At the time of the disappearance of Mr. Bathurst it was inhabited by
  Christian Mertens, who was servant at the White Swan. No examination was made
  at the time of the loss of Bathurst into the whereabouts of Mertens, nor was
  his cottage searched. It was assumed that he was at the inn waiting for his
  "vale," like the ostler and the <i>Kellner</i>. It is quite possible that he
  may have been standing near the horses' heads, and that he may have gone on
  with Mr. Bathurst a few steps to show him the direction he was to go; or,
  with the pretence that he had important information to give him, he may have
  allured him into his cottage, and there murdered him, or, again, he may have
  drawn him on to where by pre-arrangement Goldberger was lying in wait with a
  hammer or hatchet to strike him down from behind. Considering how uneasy Mr.
  Bathurst was about the road, and how preoccupied with the idea that French
  spies and secret agents were on the look-out for him, he might easily have
  been induced by a servant of the inn where he was staying to go a few steps
  through the gate, beyond earshot of the post-boy and landlord and ostler, to
  hear something which the boots pretended was of importance to him. Goldberger
  or another may have lain in wait in the blackness of the shadow of the
  gateway but a short distance from the lights about the carriage, and by one
  stroke have silenced him. It is possible that Augustus Schmidt may have been
  mixed up in the matter, and that the sable coat was taken off Mr. Bathurst
  when dead.</p>

  <p>Again, Mertens was able on the marriage of his two daughters to give one
  150<i>l.</i> and the other 120<i>l.</i> This would mean that Mertens had
  saved as boots of the Swan at the least 300<i>l.</i>, for he would not give
  every penny to his children. Surely this was a considerable sum for a boots
  in a little inn to amass from his wage and from "vales."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thistlethwaite asserts in her Memoirs of Bishop Bathurst that shortly
  after the disappearance of her brother the ostler&mdash;can she mean
  Mertens?&mdash;also disappeared, ran away. But we do not know of any
  corroborating evidence.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the discovery of the trousers in the wood near Quitzow points to
  the traveller having been murdered in Perleberg; the murderers, whoever they
  were, finding that an investigation of houses, barns, gardens and stables was
  being made, took the garments of the unfortunate man, discharged a couple of
  shots through them to make believe he had been fired at by several persons
  lying in wait for him, and then exposed them in a place away from the road
  along which Mr. Bathurst was going. The man who carried these garments was
  afraid of being observed, and he probably did not go through the town with
  them, but made a circuit to the wood, and for the same reason did not take
  them very far. The road to Lenzen ran S.W. and that to Quitzow N.W. He placed
  the trousers near the latter, but did not venture to cross the highway. He
  could get to the wood over the fields unperceived.</p>

  <p>Supposing that this is the solution of the mystery, one thing remains to
  be accounted for&mdash;the paragraph in the Hamburg paper dated from London,
  announcing that Mr. Bathurst was alive and had been heard of since the
  disappearance.</p>

  <p>This, certainly, seems to have been inserted with a design to divert or
  allay suspicion, and it was generally held to have been sent from London by a
  French agent, on instruction from Paris. But it is possible that the London
  correspondent may have heard a coffee-house rumour that Bathurst was still
  alive, and at once reported it to the paper. Its falsehood was palpable, and
  would be demonstrated at once by the family of the lost man to the
  authorities at Perleberg. It could not answer the purpose of arresting
  inquiry and staying investigation.</p>

  <p>It remains only to inquire whether it was probable that Napoleon had any
  hand in the matter.</p>

  <p>What could induce him to lay hands on an envoy? He could not expect to
  find on the person of Mr. Bathurst any important dispatches, for the war was
  over, peace with Austria was concluded. He was doubtless angry at Austria
  having declared war, and angry at England having instigated her to do so, but
  Mr. Bathurst was very small game indeed on which to wreak his anger;
  moreover, the peace that had been concluded with Austria gave great
  advantages to France. He can have had no personal dislike to Bathurst, for he
  never saw him. When Napoleon entered Vienna, Bathurst was with the Emperor
  Francis in Hungary, at Komorn.</p>

  <p>And yet, he may have suspected that Austria was insincere, and was anxious
  to renew the conflict, if she could obtain assurance of assistance from
  England. He may have thought that by securing the papers carried to England
  by Bathurst, he would get at the real intentions of Austria, and so might be
  prepared for consequences. We cannot say. The discovery of the body in
  Mertens' house, under the threshold&mdash;supposing it to be that of
  Bathurst, does not by any means prove that the murder was a mere murder for
  the purpose of robbery.</p>

  <p>If Napoleon had given instructions for the capture of Bathurst, and the
  taking from him of his papers, it does not follow that he ordered his murder,
  on the contrary, he would have given instructions that he should be
  robbed&mdash;as if by highwaymen&mdash;and let go with his life. The murder
  was against his wishes, if he did give orders for him to be robbed.</p>

  <p>The Bathurst family never doubted that Benjamin had been murdered by the
  agents of Napoleon. It is certain that he was well aware that his safety was
  menaced, and menaced at Perleberg. That was why he at once on reaching the
  place asked for the protection of a guard. He had received warning from some
  one, and such warning shows that an attempt to rob him of his papers was in
  contemplation.</p>

  <p>That caution to be on his guard must have been given him, before he left
  Vienna. He probably received another before he reached Perleberg, for he
  appeared before the Commandant in a state of great alarm and agitation. That
  this was mere spiritual presage of evil is hardly credible. We cannot
  doubt&mdash;and his letter to his wife leads to this conviction&mdash;that he
  had been warned that spies in the pay of the French Government were on the
  look-out for him. Who the agents were that were employed to get hold of his
  papers, supposing that the French Government did attempt to waylay him, can
  never be determined, whether Mertens or Augustus Schmidt.</p>

  <p>In 1815 Earl Bathurst was Secretary of State for War and the Colonial
  Department. May we not suspect that there was some mingling of personal
  exultation along with political satisfaction, in being able to send to St.
  Helena the man who had not only been the scourge of Europe, and the terror of
  kings, but who, as he supposed&mdash;quite erroneously we believe&mdash;had
  inflicted on his own family an agony of suspense and doubt that was never to
  be wholly removed?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE DUCHESS OF KINGSTON</h2>

  <p class="first">ELIZABETH CHUDLEIGH, Countess of Bristol and Duchess of
  Kingston, who was tried for bigamy in Westminster Hall by the Peers in 1776,
  was, it can hardly be doubted, the original from whom Thackeray drew his
  detailed portrait of Beatrix Esmond, both as young Trix and as the old
  Baroness Bernstein; nor can one doubt that what he knew of his prototype was
  taken from that scandalous little book, "An Authentic Detail of Particulars
  relative to the late Duchess of Kingston," published by G. Kearsley in 1788.
  Thackeray not only reproduced some of the incidents of her life, but more
  especially caught the features of her character.</p>

  <p>Poor Trix! Who does not remember her coming down the great staircase at
  Walcote, candle in hand, in her red stockings and with a new cherry ribbon
  round her neck, her eyes like blue stars, her brown hair curling about her
  head, and not feel a lingering liking for the little coquette, trying to
  catch my Lord Mohun, and the Duke of Hamilton, and many another, and missing
  all? and for the naughty old baroness, with her scandalous stories, her
  tainted past, her love of cards, her complete unscrupulousness, and yet with
  one soft corner in the withered heart for the young Virginians?</p>

  <p>The famous, or infamous, Duchess has had hard measure dealt out to her,
  which she in part deserved; but some of the stories told of her are certainly
  not true, and one circumstance in her life, if true, goes far to palliate her
  naughtiness. Unfortunately, almost all we know of her is taken from
  unfriendly sources. The only really impartial source of information is the
  "Trial," published by order of the Peers, but that covers only one portion of
  her life, and one set of incidents.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Chudleigh was the daughter of Colonel Thomas Chudleigh, of
  Chelsea, and his wife Henrietta, who was his first cousin, the fourth
  daughter of Hugh Chudleigh, of Chalmington, in Dorset. Thomas was the only
  brother of Sir George Chudleigh, fourth baronet of Asheton, in Devon. As Sir
  George left only daughters, Thomas, the brother of Elizabeth, whose baptism
  in 1718 is recorded in the Chelsea registers, succeeded as fifth baronet in
  1738. Unfortunately the Chelsea registers do not give the baptism of
  Elizabeth, and we are not able to state her precise age, about which there is
  some difference. Her father had a post in Chelsea College, but apparently she
  was not born there. There can, however, be little doubt that she saw the
  light for the first time in 1726, and not in 1720, as is generally
  asserted.</p>

  <p>Her family was one of great antiquity in the county of Devon, and was
  connected by marriage with the first families of the west of England. The old
  seat, Asheton, lies in a pleasant coombe under the ridge of Haldon; some
  remains of the old mansion, and venerable trees of the park, linger on; and
  in the picturesque parish church, perched on a rock in the valley, are many
  family monuments and heraldic blazonings of the Chudleigh lions, gules on an
  ermine field. Elizabeth lost her father very early, and the widow was left on
  a poor pension to support and advance the prospects of her two children.
  Though narrowed in fortune, Mrs. Chudleigh had good connections, and she
  availed herself of these to push her way in the world. At the age of
  sixteen&mdash;that is, in 1743&mdash;Elizabeth was given the appointment of
  maid of honour to the Princess of Wales, through the favour of Mr. Pulteney,
  afterwards Earl of Bath, who had met her one day while out shooting. The old
  beau was taken with the vivacity, intelligence and beauty of the girl. She
  was then not only remarkable for her beauty, delicacy of complexion, and
  sparkling eyes, but also for the brilliancy of her wit and the liveliness of
  her humour. Even her rival, the Marquise de la Touche, of whom more
  hereafter, bears testimony to her charms. Pulteney, himself a witty, pungent,
  and convivial man, was delighted with the cleverness of the lovely girl, and
  amused himself with drawing it out. In after years, when she was asked the
  secret of her sparkling repartee, she replied, "I always aim to be short,
  clear, and surprising."</p>

  <p>The Princess of Wales, Augusta, daughter of Frederick of Saxe-Gotha, who
  with the Prince, Frederick Lewis, had their court at Leicester House, became
  greatly attached to her young maid of honour. The beautiful Miss Chudleigh
  was speedily surrounded by admirers, among whom was James, sixth Duke of
  Hamilton, born in 1724, and therefore two years her senior.</p>

  <p>According to the "Authentic Detail," the Duke obtained from her a solemn
  engagement that, on his return from a tour on the Continent which he was
  about to take, she would become his wife. Then he departed, having arranged
  for a mutual correspondence.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1744 she went on a visit to Lainston, near Winchester, to
  her maternal aunt, Anne Hanmer, who was then living at the house of Mr.
  Merrill, the son of another aunt, Susanna, who was dead.</p>

  <p>To understand the relationship of the parties, a look will suffice at the
  following pedigree.[4]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[4] In Col. Vivian's "Visitations of the County of
  Devon," the pedigree is not so complete. He was unaware who the wife of Thos.
  Chudleigh was, and he had not seen the will of the duchess.</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1306821h-images/Oddities1-01.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Mrs. Hanmer, a widow, kept house for her nephew, who was squire. At the
  Winchester races, to which she went with a party, Elizabeth met Lieutenant
  Hervey, second son of the late John, Lord Hervey, and grandson of the Earl of
  Bristol. Lieutenant Hervey, who was in the <i>Cornwall</i>, then lying at
  Portsmouth, a vessel in Sir John Danver's squadron, was born in 1724, and was
  therefore two years the senior of Elizabeth; indeed, at the time he was only
  just twenty. He was fascinated by the beautiful girl, and was invited by Mrs.
  Hanmer to Lainston. "To this gentleman," says the "Authentic Detail," "Mrs.
  Hanmer became so exceedingly partial that she favoured his views on her
  niece, and engaged her efforts to effect, if possible, a matrimonial
  connexion. There were two difficulties which would have been insurmountable
  if not opposed by the fertile genius of a female: Miss Chudleigh disliked
  Captain Hervey, and she was betrothed to the Duke of Hamilton. To render this
  last nugatory, the letters of his Grace were intercepted by Mrs. Hanmer, and
  his supposed silence giving offence to her niece, she worked so successfully
  on her pride as to induce her to abandon all thoughts of the lover, whose
  passion she had cherished with delight."</p>

  <p>Is this story true? It seems incredible that Mrs. Hanmer should have urged
  her niece to throw over such a splendid prospect of family advancement as
  that offered by marriage with the Duke of Hamilton, for the sake of an
  impecunious young sailor who was without the means of supporting his wife,
  and who, at that time, had not the faintest expectation of succeeding to the
  Earldom of Bristol.</p>

  <p>It is allowable to hope that the story of the engagement to the Duke of
  Hamilton, broken through the intrigues of the aunt, is true, as it forms some
  excuse for the after conduct of Elizabeth Chudleigh.</p>

  <p>It is more probable that the Duke of Hamilton had not said anything to
  Elizabeth, and did not write to her, at all events not till later. She may
  have entertained a liking for him, but not receiving any token that the
  liking was reciprocated, she allowed her aunt to engage and marry her to
  young Hervey. That the poor girl had no fancy for the young man is abundantly
  clear. The Attorney General, in the trial, said that Mrs. Hanmer urged on the
  match "as advantageous to her niece;" but advantageous it certainly was not,
  and gave no prospect of being.</p>

  <p>In August, Augustus John Hervey got leave from his ship and came to
  Lainston. The house, which had belonged to the Dawleys, had passed into the
  possession of the Merrills. In the grounds stands the parish church, but as
  the only house in the parish is the mansion, it came to be regarded very much
  as the private chapel of the manor house. The living went with Sparsholt.
  There was no parsonage attached, and though the Dawleys had their children
  baptized in Lainston, they were registered in the book of Sparsholt. The
  church is now an ivy-covered ruin, and the mansion is much reduced in size
  from what it was in the time when it belonged to the Merrills.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Lainston is a small parish, the value of the living being
  £15 a year; Mr. Merrill's the only house in it, and the parish church at the
  end of his garden. On the 4th August, 1744, Mr. Amis, the then rector, was
  appointed to be at the church, alone, late at night. At eleven o'clock Mr.
  Hervey and Miss Chudleigh went out, as if to walk in the garden, followed by
  Mrs. Hanmer, her servant&mdash;Anne Craddock, Mr. Merrill, and Mr. Mountenay,
  which last carried a taper to read the service by. They found Mr. Amis in the
  church, according to his appointment, and there the service was celebrated,
  Mr. Mountenay holding the taper in his hat. The ceremony being performed,
  Mrs. Hanmer's maid was despatched to see that the coast was clear, and they
  returned into the house without being observed by any of the servants."</p>

  <p>This is the account of the wedding given at the trial by the Attorney
  General, from the evidence of Anne Craddock, then the sole surviving
  witness.</p>

  <p>There was no signing of registers, Mr. Amis was left to make the proper
  entry in the Sparsholt book&mdash;and he forgot to do this. The happiness of
  the newly-married couple lasted but a few days&mdash;two, or at the outside,
  three; and then Lieutenant Hervey left to rejoin his vessel, and in November
  sailed for the West Indies. The "Authentic Detail" declares that a violent
  quarrel broke out immediately on marriage between the young people, and that
  Elizabeth declared her aversion, and vowed never to associate with him
  again.</p>

  <p>So little was the marriage to her present advantage that Elizabeth was
  unable to proclaim it, and thereby forfeit her situation as maid of honour to
  the Princess, with its pay and perquisites. Consequently, by her aunt's
  advice, she kept it concealed.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Miss Chudleigh, now Mrs. Hervey,&mdash;a maid in
  appearance, a wife in disguise,&mdash;seemed from those who judge from
  externals only, to be in an enviable situation. Of the higher circles she was
  the attractive centre, of gayer life the invigorating spirit. Her royal
  mistress not only smiled on, but actually approved her. A few friendships she
  cemented, and conquests she made in such abundance that, like Cæsar in a
  triumph, she had a train of captives at her heels. Her husband, quieted for a
  time, grew obstreperous as she became more the object of admiration. He felt
  his right, and was determined to assert it. She endeavoured by letter to
  negotiate him into peace, but her efforts succeeded not. He demanded a
  private interview, and, enforcing his demands by threats of exposure in case
  of refusal, she complied through compulsion."</p>

  <p>The Duke of Hamilton returned from the grand tour, and he at once sought
  Elizabeth to know why his letters had not been answered. Then the fraud that
  had been practised on her was discovered, and the Duke laid his coronet at
  her feet. She was unable to accept the offer, and unable also to explain the
  reasons of her refusal. Rage at having been duped, disappointment at having
  lost the strawberry leaves, embittered Elizabeth, and stifled the germs of
  good principle in her.</p>

  <p>This is the generally received story. It is that given by the author, or
  authoress, of the "Authentic Detail," usually well informed. But, as we have
  seen, it is hardly possible to suppose that Mrs. Hanmer can have suppressed
  the Duke's letters. No doubt she was a fool, and a woman, when a fool, is of
  abnormal folly, yet she never loses sight of her own interest; and it was not
  Mrs. Hanmer's interest to spoil the chances of her niece with the Duke.</p>

  <p>After the Duke of Hamilton had been refused, and his visits to her house
  in Conduit Street prohibited, the Duke of Ancaster, Lord Howe, and other
  nobles made offers, and experienced a fate similar to that of his Grace of
  Hamilton. This astonished the fashionable world, and Mrs. Chudleigh, her
  mother, who was a stranger to the private marriage of her daughter,
  reprehended her folly with warmth.[5] To be freed from her embarrassments,
  Elizabeth resolved to travel. She embarked for the Continent, and visited
  Dresden, where she became an attached friend of the Electress of Saxony.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[5] Mrs. Chudleigh died in 1756, and her will mentions
  her daughter by her maiden name.</p>

  <p>On her return to England she was subjected to annoyance from her husband.
  She could not forgive him the deception practised on her, though he was
  probably innocent of connivance in it.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Captain Hervey, like a perturbed spirit, was eternally
  crossing the path trodden by his wife. Was she in the rooms at Bath? he was
  sure to be there. At a rout, ridotto, or ball, there was this fell destroyer
  of peace, embittering every pleasure and blighting the fruit of happiness by
  the pestilential malignity of his presence. As a proof of his disposition to
  annoy, he menaced his wife with an intimation that he would disclose the
  marriage to the Princess of Wales. In this Miss Chudleigh anticipated him by
  being the first relater of the circumstance. Her royal mistress heard and
  pitied her. She continued her patronage to the hour of her death."</p>

  <p>In 1749, Elizabeth attended a masquerade ball in the dress, or rather
  undress, of the character of Iphigenia. In a letter of Mrs. Montague to her
  sister, she says, "Miss Chudleigh's dress, or rather undress, was remarkable,
  she was Iphigenia for the sacrifice, but so naked, the high priest might
  easily inspect the entrails of the victim. The Maids of Honour (not of maids
  the strictest) were so offended they would not speak to her." Horace Walpole
  says, "Miss Chudleigh was Iphigenia, but so naked that you would have taken
  her for Andromeda." It was of her that the witty remark was then first made
  that she resembled Eve in that she was "naked and not ashamed." On May 17th
  Walpole writes: "I told you we were to have another masquerade; there was one
  by the King's command for Miss Chudleigh, the Maid of Honour, with whom our
  gracious monarch has a mind to believe himself in love, so much in love, that
  at one of the booths he gave her a fairing for her watch, which cost him
  five-and-thirty guineas, actually disbursed out of his privy purse, and not
  charged on the civil list. I hope some future Holinshed or Speed will
  acquaint posterity that five-and-thirty guineas were an immense sum in those
  days."</p>

  <p>In December 1750, George II. gave the situation of Housekeeper at Windsor
  to Mrs. Chudleigh, Elizabeth's mother. Walpole says, "Two days ago, the
  gallant Orondates (the King) strode up to Miss Chudleigh, and told her he was
  glad to have the opportunity of obeying her commands, that he appointed her
  mother Housekeeper at Windsor, and hoped she would not think a kiss too great
  a reward&mdash;against all precedent he kissed her in the circle. He has had
  a hankering these two years. Her life, which is now of thirty years'
  standing, has been a little historic. Why should not experience and a
  charming face on her side, and near seventy years on his, produce a
  title?"</p>

  <p>In 1760 she gave a soirée on the Prince's birthday, which Horace Walpole
  describes: "Poor thing," he writes, "I fear she has thrown away above a
  quarter's salary!"</p>

  <p>The Duke of Kingston saw and was captivated by Elizabeth. Evelyn
  Pierrepoint, Duke of Kingston, Marquis of Dorchester, Earl of Kingston, and
  Viscount Newark, was born in 1711. Horace Walpole says of him that he was "a
  very weak man, of the greatest beauty and finest person in England."</p>

  <p>He had been to Paris along with Lord Scarborough, taking with him an
  entire horse as a present to the Duke of Bourbon, and was unable to do this
  without a special Act of Parliament to authorise him. The Duke of Bourbon, in
  return for the compliment, placed his palace at Paris, and his château of
  Chantilly at the disposal of the visitor.</p>

  <p>The Duke was handsome, young, wealthy and unmarried. A strong set was made
  at him by the young ladies of the French court; but of all the women he there
  met, none attracted his attentions and engaged his heart but the Marquise de
  la Touche, a lady who had been married for ten years and was the mother of
  three children. He finally persuaded her to elope with him to England, where,
  however, he grew cold towards her, and when he fell under the fascinations of
  Elizabeth Chudleigh he dismissed her. The Marquise returned to France, and
  was reconciled to her husband; there in 1786 she published her version of the
  story, and gave a history of her rival, whom naturally she paints in the
  blackest colours.</p>

  <p>Now follows an incident which is stated in the English accounts of the
  life of Elizabeth Chudleigh; but of which there is no mention in the trial,
  and which is of more than doubtful truth.</p>

  <p>She had become desperate, resolved at all hazard to break the miserable
  tie that bound her to Captain Hervey. She made a sudden descent on
  Lainston&mdash;so runs the tale&mdash;visited the parsonage, and whilst Mr.
  Amis was kept in conversation with one of her attendants, she tore out the
  leaf of the register book that contained the entry of her marriage.</p>

  <p>This story cannot possibly be true. As already said, Lainston has no
  parsonage, and never had. Lainston goes with Sparsholt, half-a-mile off. But
  Mr. Amis never held Sparsholt, but acted as curate there for a while in 1756
  and 1757. Lainston had no original register. What Elizabeth did was probably
  to convince herself that through inadvertence, her marriage had not been
  registered in the parish book of Sparsholt.</p>

  <p>In 1751 died John, Earl of Bristol, and was succeeded by his grandson,
  George William, who was unmarried. He was in delicate health; at one time
  seriously ill, and it was thought he would die. In that case Augustus John,
  Elizabeth's husband, would succeed to the Earldom of Bristol. She saw now
  that it was to her interest to establish her marriage. She accordingly took
  means to do so.</p>

  <p>She went at once to Winchester and sent for the wife of Mr. Amis, who had
  married her. She told Mrs. Amis that she wanted the register of her marriage
  to be made out. Mr. Amis then lay on his death-bed, but, nevertheless, she
  went to the rectory to obtain of him what she desired. What ensued shall be
  told in the words of Mrs. Amis at the trial.</p>

  <p class="quote">"I went up to Mr. Amis and told him her request. Then Mr.
  Merrill and the lady consulted together whom to send for, and they desired me
  to send for Mr. Spearing, the attorney. I did send for him, and during the
  time the messenger was gone the lady concealed herself in a closet; she said
  she did not care that Mr. Spearing should know that she was there. When Mr.
  Spearing came, Mr. Merrill produced a sheet of stamped paper that he brought
  to make the register upon. Mr. Spearing said it would not do; it must be a
  book, and that the lady must be at the making of it. Then I went to the
  closet and told the lady. Then the lady came to Mr. Spearing, and Mr.
  Spearing told the lady a sheet of stamped paper would not do, it must be a
  book. Then the lady desired Mr. Spearing to go and buy one. Mr. Spearing went
  and bought one, and when brought, the register was made. Then Mr. Amis
  delivered it to the lady; the lady thanked him, and said it might be an
  hundred thousand pounds in her way. Before Mr. Merrill and the lady left my
  house the lady sealed up the register and gave it to me, and desired I would
  take care of it until Mr. Amis's death, and then deliver it to Mr.
  Merrill."</p>

  <p>The entries made thus were those:</p>

  <p class="quote">"2 August, Mrs. Susanna Merrill, relict of John Merrill,
  Esq. buried.</p>

  <p class="quote">"4 August, 1744, married the Honourable Augustus Hervey,
  Esq., in the parish Church of Lainston, to Miss Elizabeth Chudleigh, daughter
  of Col. Thomas Chudleigh, late of Chelsea College, by me, Thos. Amis."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately this register book was taken up to Westminster at the trial
  of the Duchess and was never returned. Application was made to Elbrow
  Woodcock, solicitor in the trial, for the return of the book, by the then
  rector and patron of the living, but in vain; and in December, 1777, a new
  register book was purchased for the parish.</p>

  <p>The Earl recovered, and did not die till some years later, in 1775, when
  Augustus John did succeed to the earldom.</p>

  <p>In 1751, the Prince of Wales died, and this necessitated a rearrangement
  of the household of the Princess. Elizabeth was reappointed maid of honour to
  her, still in her maiden name. Soon after&mdash;that is, in 1752&mdash;the
  Duke of Hamilton married the beautiful Miss Gunning.</p>

  <p>In 1760 the king was dead. "Charles Townshend, receiving an account of the
  impression the king's death had made," writes Walpole, "was told Miss
  Chudleigh cried. 'What,' said he, 'oysters?'" "There is no keeping off age,"
  he writes in 1767, "as Miss Chudleigh does, by sticking roses and sweet peas
  in one's hair."</p>

  <p>Before this, in 1765, the Duke of Kingston's affection for her seeming to
  wane, Elizabeth, who was getting fat as well as old, started for Carlsbad to
  drink the waters. "She has no more wanted the Carlsbad waters than you did,"
  wrote Lord Chesterfield. "Is it to show the Duke of Kingston he can not live
  without her? A dangerous experiment, which may possibly convince him that he
  can. There is a trick, no doubt, in it, but what, I neither know nor care."
  "Is the fair, or, at least, the fat Miss Chudleigh with you still? It must be
  confessed she knows the arts of courts to be so received at Dresden and so
  connived at in Leicester Fields."</p>

  <p>At last the bonds of a marriage in which he was never allowed even to
  speak with his wife became intolerable to Captain Hervey; and some
  negotiations were entered into between them, whereby it was agreed that she
  should institute a suit in the Consistory Court of the Bishop of London for
  the jactitation of the marriage, and that he should not produce evidence to
  establish it. The case came on in the Michaelmas term, 1768, and was in form,
  proceedings to restrain the Hon. Augustus John Hervey from asserting that
  Elizabeth Chudleigh was his wife, "to the great danger of his soul's health,
  no small prejudice to the said Hon. Elizabeth Chudleigh, and pernicious
  example of others."</p>

  <p>There was a counter-suit of Captain Hervey against her, in which he
  asserted that in 1743 or 1744, being then a minor of the age of seventeen or
  eighteen, he had contracted himself in marriage to Elizabeth Chudleigh, and
  she to him; and that they had been married in the house of Mr. Merrill, on
  August 9, 1744, at eleven o'clock at night, by the Rev. Thomas Amis, since
  deceased, and in the presence of Mrs. Hanmer and Mr. Mountenay, both also
  deceased.</p>

  <p>As will be seen, the counter-libel was incorrectly drawn. The marriage had
  not taken place in the house, but in the church; Mr. Hervey was aged twenty,
  not seventeen or eighteen; and Anne Craddock, the sole surviving witness of
  the ceremony, was not mentioned. The register of the marriage was not
  produced,[6] and no serious attempt was made to establish it. Accordingly, on
  February 10, 1769, sentence was given, declaring the marriage form gone
  through in 1744 to have been null and void, and to restrain Mr. Hervey from
  asserting his claim to be husband to Miss Elizabeth Chudleigh, and condemning
  him in costs to the sum of one hundred pounds.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[6] Mr. John Merrill died February 1767, and his burial
  was entered in it. Mr. Bathurst, who had married his daughter, found the
  register book in the hall, and handed it over to the rector, Mr. Kinchin.
  Nevertheless it was not produced at the hearing of the case for jactitation
  in the Consistory Court.</p>

  <p>As the Attorney-General said at her subsequent trial, "a grosser artifice,
  I believe, than this suit was never fabricated."</p>

  <p>On March 8, 1769, the Duke of Kingston married Elizabeth Chudleigh by
  special licence from the Archbishop, the minister who performed it being the
  Rev. Samuel Harper, of the British Museum, and the Church, St. Margaret's,
  Westminster. The Prince and Princess of Wales wore favours on the
  occasion.</p>

  <p>No attempt was made during the lifetime of the Duke to dispute the
  legality of the marriage. Neither he nor Elizabeth had the least doubt that
  the former marriage had been legally dissolved. It was, no doubt, the case
  that Captain Hervey made no real attempt to prove his marriage, he was as
  impatient of the bond as was she. It can hardly be doubted that the sentence
  of the Ecclesiastical Court was just. Captain Hervey was a minor at the time,
  and the poor girl had been deluded into marrying him by her wretched aunt.
  Advantage had been taken of her&mdash;a mere girl&mdash;by the woman who was
  her natural guardian in the absence of her mother. Such a marriage would at
  once be annulled in the Court of the Church of Rome; it would be annulled in
  a modern English divorce court.</p>

  <p>The fortune of the Duke was not entailed; his Grace had, therefore, the
  option to bequeath it as seemed best to his inclination. His nearest of kin
  were his nephews, Evelyn and Charles Meadows, sons of Lady Francis
  Pierrepont; Charles was in 1806 created Earl Manners; he had previously
  changed his name to Pierrepont, and been created Baron Pierrepont and
  Viscount Newark in 1796.</p>

  <p>The Duke was and remained warmly attached to the Duchess. She made him
  happy. She had plenty of conversation, had her mind stored with gossip, and
  though old, oldened gracefully and pleasantly. Her bitter enemy&mdash;an old
  servant and confidant, who furnished the materials for the "Authentic
  Detail," says, "Contrarily gifted and disposed, they were frequently on
  discordant terms, but she had a strong hold on his mind."</p>

  <p>On September 23, 1773, the Duke died. The Duchess had anticipated his
  death. He had already made his will, bequeathing to her the entire income of
  his estates during her life, subject to the proviso that she remained in a
  state of widowhood. This did not at all please the Duchess, and directly she
  saw that her husband was dying she sent for a solicitor, a Mr. Field, to draw
  up a new will, omitting the obnoxious proviso; she was only by two years on
  the right side of fifty, and might marry again. When Mr. Field was introduced
  to the Duke, he saw that the dying man was not in a mental condition capable
  of executing a will, and he refused to have anything to do with an attempt to
  extort his signature from him. The Duchess was very angry; but the refusal of
  Mr. Field was most fortunate for her, as, had the will proposed been
  executed, it would most indubitably have been set aside.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Duke was dead the dowager Duchess determined to enjoy life.
  She had a pleasure yacht built, placed in command of it an officer who had
  served in the navy, fitted it up with every luxury, sailed for Italy, and
  visited Rome, where the Pope and the cardinals received her with great
  courtesy. Indeed, she was given up one of the palaces of the cardinals for
  her residence. Whilst she was amusing herself in Italy something happened in
  England that was destined to materially spoil her happiness. Anne Craddock
  was still alive, the sole witness of her marriage that survived. She was in
  bad circumstances, and applied to Mr. Field for pecuniary relief. He refused
  it, but the Duchess sent to offer her twenty guineas per annum. This Anne
  Craddock refused, and gave intimation to Mr. Evelyn Meadows that she had
  information of importance which she could divulge.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Meadows heard what Anne Craddock had to say, he set the machinery
  of the law in motion to obtain the prosecution of the Duchess, in the hopes
  of convicting her of bigamy, and then of upsetting the will of the late Duke
  in her favour. A bill of indictment for bigamy was preferred against her; the
  bill was found, Mr. Field had notice of the procedure, and the Duchess was
  advised to return instantly to England and appear to the indictment, to
  prevent an outlawry.</p>

  <p>At this time&mdash;that is, in 1775&mdash;the Earl of Bristol died without
  issue, and Augustus John, her first husband, succeeded to the title.</p>

  <p>The anxieties of the Duchess were not confined to the probable issue of
  the trial. Samuel Foote, the comedian, took a despicable advantage of her
  situation to attempt to extort money from her. He wrote a farce, entitled "A
  Trip to Calais," in which he introduced her Grace under the sobriquet of Lady
  Kitty Crocodile, and stuffed the piece with particulars relative to the
  private history of the Duchess, which he had obtained from Miss Penrose, a
  young lady who had been about her person for many years. When the piece was
  finished, he contrived to have it communicated to her Grace that the
  Haymarket Theatre would open with the entertainment in which she was held up
  to ridicule and scorn. She was alarmed, and sent for Foote. He attended with
  the piece in his pocket. She desired him to read a part of it. He obeyed; and
  had not read far before she could no longer control herself, but, starting up
  in a rage, exclaimed, "This is scandalous, Mr. Foote! Why, what a wretch you
  have made me!" After a few turns round the room, she composed herself to
  inquire on what terms he would suppress the play. Foote had the effrontery to
  demand two thousand pounds. She offered him fourteen, then sixteen hundred
  pounds; but he, grasping at too much, lost all. She consulted the Duke of
  Newcastle, and the Lord Chamberlain was apprised of the circumstances, and
  his interference solicited. He sent for the manuscript copy of the "Trip to
  Calais," perused, and censured it. In the event of its publication she
  threatened to prosecute Foote for libel. Public opinion ranged itself on the
  side of the Duchess, and Dr. Schomberg only expressed its opinion when he
  said that "Foote deserved to be run through the body for such an attempt. It
  was more ignoble than the conduct of a highwayman."</p>

  <p>On April 17, 1776, the trial of the Duchess came on in Westminster Hall,
  and lasted five days. The principal object argued was the admission, or not,
  of a sentence of the Spiritual Court, in a suit for jactitation of marriage,
  in an indictment for polygamy. As the judges decided against the admission of
  such a sentence in bar to evidence, the fact of the two marriages was most
  clearly proved, and a conviction of course followed. The Duchess was tried by
  the Peers, a hundred and nineteen of whom sat and passed judgment upon her,
  all declaring "Guilty, upon mine honour," except the Duke of Newcastle, who
  pronounced "Guilty, erroneously; but not intentionally, upon mine
  honour."</p>

  <p>No sooner did the Duchess see that her cause was lost than she determined
  to escape out of England. The penalty for bigamy was death, but she could
  escape this sentence by claiming the benefits of the statute 3 and 4 William
  and Mary, which left her in a condition to be burnt in the hand, or
  imprisoned; but she claimed the benefit of the peerage, and the Lord Chief
  Baron, having conferred with the rest of the judges, delivered their
  unanimous opinion that she ought "to be immediately discharged." However, her
  prosecutors prepared a writ "ne exeat regno," to obtain her arrest and the
  deprivation of her personal property. To escape this she fled to Dover, where
  her yacht was in waiting, and crossed to Calais, whilst amusing the public
  and her prosecutors by issuing invitations to a dinner at Kingston House, and
  causing her carriage to appear in the most fashionable quarters of the town.
  Mr. Meadows had carried his first point; she could no longer call herself
  Dowager Duchess of Kingston in England, but she was reinstated in her
  position of wife to Augustus John Hervey, and was therefore now Countess of
  Bristol. Mr. Meadows next proceeded to attack the will of the late Duke, but
  in this attempt he utterly failed. The will was confirmed, and Elizabeth,
  Countess of Bristol, was acknowledged as lawfully possessed of life interest
  in the property of the Duke so long as she remained unmarried. Mr. Meadows
  was completely ruined, and his sole gain was to keep the unhappy woman an
  exile from England.</p>

  <p>Abroad the Countess was still received as Duchess of Kingston. She lived
  in considerable state, and visited Italy, Russia, and France. Her visit to
  St. Petersburg was splendid, and to ensure a favourable reception by the
  Empress Catharine she sent her a present of some of the valuable paintings by
  old masters from Kingston House. When in Russia she purchased an estate near
  the capital, to which she gave the name of Chudleigh, and which cost her
  25,000<i>l.</i>[7] The Empress also gave her a property on the Neva. She had
  a corvette built of mahogany which was to be a present to the Empress, but
  the vessel stranded on the coast of Ingermanland. Eight of the cannons out of
  her are now at Chudleigh, almost the only things there that recall the
  Duchess. She gave magnificent entertainments; at one of these, to which the
  Empress was invited, a hundred and forty of her own servants attended in the
  Kingston livery of black turned up with red and silver.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[7] This place still bears the name. It is on the main
  road through Livland and Esthonia to St. Petersburg; about twenty miles from
  Narwa. It also goes by the name of Fockenhof. The present mansion is more
  modern, and belongs to the family of Von Wilcken.</p>

  <p>On her return from Russia she bought an estate at Montmartre, which cost
  her 9,000<i>l.</i>, and another that belonged to one of the French royal
  princes at Saint Assise, which cost her 55,000<i>l.</i> The château was so
  large that three hundred beds could be made up in it.</p>

  <p>She was getting on in years, but did not lose her energy, her vivacity,
  and her selfishness. Once in Rome, the story goes, she had been invited to
  visit some tombs that were famous. She replied with a touch of real feeling:
  "Ce n'est pas la peine de chercher des tombeaux, on en porte assez dans son
  coeur."</p>

  <p>The account of her death shall be given in the words of the author of
  "Authentic Detail."</p>

  <p class="quote">"She was at dinner, when her servants received intelligence
  of a sentence respecting the house near Paris having been awarded against
  her. She flew into a violent passion, and, in the agitation of her mind and
  body, burst an internal blood-vessel. Even this she appeared to have
  surmounted, until a few days afterwards, on the morning of the 26th August
  (1788), when about to rise from her bed, a servant who had long been with her
  endeavoured at dissuasion. The Duchess addressed her thus: 'I am not very
  well, but I <i>will</i> rise. At your peril disobey me; I will get up and
  walk about the room. Ring for the secretary to assist me.' She was obeyed,
  dressed, and the secretary entered the chamber. The Duchess then walked
  about, complained of thirst, and said, 'I could drink a glass of my fine
  Madeira and eat a slice of toasted bread; I shall be quite well afterwards;
  but let it be a large glass of wine.' The attendant reluctantly brought and
  the Duchess drank the wine. She then said, 'I knew the Madeira would do me
  good. My heart feels oddly; I will have another glass.' She then walked a
  little about the room, and afterwards said, 'I will lie on the couch.' She
  sat on the couch, a female having hold of each hand. In this situation she
  soon appeared to have fallen into a profound sleep, until the women found her
  hands colder than ordinary; other domestics were rung for, and the Duchess
  was found to have expired, as the wearied labourer sinks into the arms of
  rest."</p>

  <p>Was it a touch of final malice or of real regret that caused the old lady,
  by codicil to her will dated May 10, 1787, to leave pearl earrings and
  necklace to the Marquise de la Touche? Was it a token that she forgave her
  the cruel book, "Les aventures trop amoureuses; ou, Elizabeth Chudleigh,"
  which she wrote, or caused to be written, for the blackening of her rival,
  and the whitewashing of herself? Let us hope it was so. The proviso in the
  Duke's will saved her from herself; but for that she would have married an
  adventurer who called himself the Chevalier de Wortha, a man who obtained
  great influence over her, and finally died by his own hand.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Chudleigh's character and career have never been sketched by
  friends; her enemies, those jealous of her fascinations, angry at her
  success, discontented with not having been sufficiently considered in her
  will, have given us their impressions of her, have poured out all the evil
  they knew and imagined of her. She has been hardly used. The only perfectly
  reliable authority for her history is the report of her trial, and that
  covers only one portion of her story. The "Authentic Detail" published by G.
  Kearsley, London, in 1788, is anonymous. It is fairly reliable, but tinctured
  by animosity. The book "Les Aventures trop Amoureuses, ou, Elizabeth
  Chudleigh, ex-duchesse douairière de Kingston, aujourd'hui Comtesse de
  Bristol, et la Marquise de la Touche. Londres, aux depens des Interessez,
  1776," was composed for the justification of Madame de la Touche, and with
  all the venom of a discomfited and supplanted rival.</p>

  <p>An utterly worthless book, "Histoire de la vie et des Aventures de la
  Duchesse de Kingston, a Londres, et se trouve à Paris, Chez Quillot, 1789,"
  is fiction. It pretends to be based on family papers. At the commencement it
  gives a portion of the diary of Col. Thomas Chudleigh, in which, among other
  impossibilities, he records his having reduced the rents of his tenants on
  his estates twenty per cent. because the year was bad. As it happened, Col.
  Thomas Chudleigh neither possessed an acre of land, nor a tenant.</p>

  <p>In 1813 appeared "La Duchesse de Kingston, memoires rédigés par M. de
  Favolle," in two volumes; this is based solely on the preceding with rich
  additions from the imagination of the author. Not a statement in it can be
  trusted.</p>

  <p>Some little reliable information may be found in the "Memoires de la
  Baronne d'Oberkirch," Paris 1853.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; GENERAL MALLET</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the return of Napoleon to Paris from Moscow, he was
  depressed with news that troubled him more than the loss of his legions. The
  news that had reached him related to perhaps the most extraordinary
  conspiracy that was ever devised, and which was within an ace of complete
  success. It was the news of this conspiracy that induced him to desert the
  army in the snows of Russia and hasten to Paris. The thoughts of this
  conspiracy frustrated by an accident, as Alison says, "incessantly occupied
  his mind during his long and solitary journey."</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Napoleon, when the report of the conspiracy was read
  over to him, "we must no longer disbelieve in miracles."</p>

  <p>Claude François Mallet belonged to a noble family in the Franche Comté. He
  was born on June 28th, 1754, at Dole, and passed his early life in the army,
  where he commanded one of the first battalions of the Jura at the
  commencement of the Revolution. In May 1793, he was elevated to the rank of
  adjutant-General, and in August 1799, made General of Brigade, and commanded
  a division under Championnet. He was a man of enthusiastically Republican
  views, and viewed the progress of Napoleon with dissatisfaction mingled with
  envy. There can be no question as to what his opinions were at first; whether
  he changed them afterwards is not so certain. He was a reserved, hard, and
  bitter man, ambitious and restless. Envy of Napoleon, jealousy of his success
  seems to have been the ruling motive in his heart that made of him a
  conspirator, and not genuine disgust at Cæsarism.</p>

  <p>Bonaparte knew his political opinions; and though he did not fear the man,
  he did not trust him. He became implicated in some illegal exactions at
  Civita Vecchia, in the Roman States, and was in consequence deprived of his
  command, and sent before a commission of enquiry at Paris, in July 1807; and,
  in virtue of their sentence, he was confined for a short while, and then
  again set at liberty and reinstated. In 1808, when the war in the Peninsula
  broke out, Mallet entered at Dijon into a plot, along with some old
  anarchists, for the overthrow of the Emperor, among them the ex-General
  Guillaume, who betrayed the plot, and Mallet was arrested and imprisoned in
  La Force. Napoleon did not care that conspiracies against himself and his
  throne should be made public, and consequently he contented himself with the
  detention of Mallet alone.</p>

  <p>In prison, the General did not abandon his schemes, and he had the lack of
  prudence to commit them to paper. This fell into the hands of the Government.
  The minister regarded the scheme as chimerical and unimportant. The papers
  were shown to Napoleon, who apparently regarded the scheme or the man as
  really dangerous, and ordered him to perpetual detention in prison.</p>

  <p>Time passed, and Mallet and his schemes were forgotten. Who could suppose
  that a solitary prisoner, without means, without the opportunity of making
  confederates, could menace the safety of the Empire?</p>

  <p>Then came the Russian campaign, in 1812. Mallet saw what Napoleon did not;
  the inevitable failure that must attend it; and he immediately renewed his
  attempts to form a plot against the Emperor.</p>

  <p>But the prison of La Force was bad headquarters from which to work. He
  pretended to be ill, and he was removed to a hospital, that of the Doctor
  Belhomme near the Barrière du Trône. In this house were the two brothers
  Polignac, a M. de Puyvert, and the Abbé Lafon, who in 1814 wrote and
  published an account of this conspiracy of Mallet. These men were Royalists,
  and Mallet was a Republican. It did not matter so long as Napoleon could be
  overthrown, how divergent their views might be as to what form of Government
  was to take the place of the Empire.</p>

  <p>They came to discussion, and the Royalists supposed that they had
  succeeded in convincing Mallet. He, on his side, was content to dissemble his
  real views, and to make use of these men as his agents.</p>

  <p>The Polignac brothers were uneasy, they were afraid of the consequences,
  and they mistrusted the man who tried to draw them into his plot. Perhaps,
  also, they considered his scheme too daring to succeed. Accordingly they
  withdrew from the hospital, to be out of his reach. It was not so with the
  others. The Polignacs had been mixed up in the enterprise of Georges, and had
  no wish to be again involved. Whether there were many others in the plot we
  do not know, Lafon names only four, and it does not seem that M. de Puyvert
  took a very active part in it.</p>

  <p>Mallet's new scheme was identical with the old one that had been taken
  from him and shown to Napoleon. Napoleon had recognized its daring and
  ability, and had not despised it. That no further fear of Mallet was
  entertained is clear, or he would never have been transferred from the prison
  to a private hospital, where he would be under very little supervision.</p>

  <p>In his hospital, Mallet drew up the following report of a Session of the
  Senate, imagined by himself:</p>

  <p class="quote">"SÉNAT CONSERVATEUR</p>

  <p class="quote">"Session of 22 October, 1812.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Session was opened at 8 P.M., under the presidency of
  Senator Sieyes.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The occasion of this extraordinary Session was the receipt
  of the news of the death of the Emperor Napoleon, under the walls of Moscow,
  on the 8th of the month.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Senate, after mature consideration of the condition of
  affairs caused by this event, named a Commission to consider the danger of
  the situation, and to arrange for the maintenance of Government and order.
  After having received the report of this Commission, the following orders
  were passed by the Senate.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That as the Imperial Government has failed to satisfy the
  aspirations of the French people, and secure peace, it be decreed annulled
  forthwith.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That all such officers military and civil as shall use
  their authority prejudicially to the re-establishment of the Republic, shall
  be declared outlawed.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That a Provisional Government be established, to consist of
  13 members:&mdash;Moreau, President; Carnot, Vice-President; General
  Augereau, Bigonet, Destutt-Tracy, Florent Guyot, Frochot; Mathieu
  Montmorency, General Mallet, Noailles, Truguet; Volney, Garat.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That this Provisional Government be required to watch over
  the internal and external safety of the State, and to enter into negociations
  with the military powers for the re-establishment of peace.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That a constitution shall be drawn up and submitted to the
  General Assembly of the French realm.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That the National Guard be reconstituted as formerly.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That a general Amnesty be proclaimed for all political
  offences; that all emigrants, exiles, be permitted to return.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That the freedom of the Press be restored.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That the command of the army of the Centre, and which
  consists of 50,000 men, and is stationed near Paris, be given to General
  Lecombe.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That General Mallet replaces General Hulin as commandant of
  Paris, and in the first division. He will have the right to nominate the
  officers in the general staff that will surround him."</p><br>

  <p>There were many other orders, 19 in all, but these will suffice to
  indicate the tendency of the document. It was signed by the President and his
  Secretaries.</p>

  <p class="quote">President, SIEYES.</p>

  <p class="quote">Secretaries, LANJUINAIS, et GREGOIRE.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Approved, and compared with a similar paper in my own
  hands,</p>

  <p class="quote">Signed, MALLET, General of Division, Commandant of the main
  army of Paris, and of the forces of the First Division."</p><br>

  <p>This document, which was designed to be shown to the troops, to the
  officers and officials, was drawn up in a form so close to the genuine form,
  and the signatures and seals were so accurately imitated, that the document
  was not likely at the first glance to excite mistrust.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mallet had drawn up an order for the day, and a proclamation,
  which was printed in many thousand copies.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd October, 1812, at 10 o'clock at night, after he had been
  playing cards with great composure in the hospital, Mallet made his escape,
  along with four others, one was the Abbé Lafon, another a corporal named
  Rateau, whom he had named as his aide-de-camp. Mallet had just twelve francs
  in his pocket, and so furnished he embarked on his undertaking to upset the
  throne of the Emperor. He at once went to a Spanish monk, whose acquaintance
  he had made in prison; and in his rooms found his general's uniform which had
  been brought there by a woman the evening before. Uniforms and swords for his
  confederates were also ready. But it rained that night&mdash;it rained in
  torrents, and the streets of Paris ran with water. It has been remarked that
  rain in Paris has a very sobering effect on political agitations, and acts
  even better than bayonets in preventing a disturbance of the public
  peace.</p>

  <p>Mallet and his confederates could not leave their shelter till after
  midnight, and some of them did not appear at the place of rendezvous till 6
  o'clock in the morning. Indisputably this had much to do with the defeat of
  the plot.</p>

  <p>The success of the undertaking depended on darkness, on the sudden
  bewilderment of minds, and the paralysis of the government through the
  assassination of some of the ministers. About 2 A.M. Mallet appeared in his
  general's uniform, attended by some of his confederates also in uniform, at
  the Popincour barracks, and demanded to see the Commandant Soulier at once,
  giving his name as Lamothe. Soulier was in bed asleep. He was also unwell. He
  was roused from his slumbers, hastily dressed himself, and received a sealed
  letter, which he broke open, and read:</p>

  <p>"To the General of Division, Commandant-in-Chief of the troops under arms
  in Paris, and the troops of the First Division, Soulier, Commandant of the
  10th Cohort."</p>

  <p>"General Headquarters, "Place Vendôme. "23<i>rd</i> Oct., 1812, 10 o'clock
  a.m.</p>

  <p class="quote">"M. LE COMMANDANT,&mdash;I have given orders to the General
  Lamothe with a police commissioner to attend at your barracks, and to read
  before you and your Cohort the decree of the senate consequent on the receipt
  of the news of the death of the Emperor, and the cessation of the Imperial
  Government. The said general will communicate to you the Order for the Day,
  which you will be pleased to further to the General of Brigade. You are
  required to get the troops under arms with all possible despatch and
  quietness. By daybreak, the officers who are in barracks will be sent to the
  Place de Grève, there to await their companies, which will there assemble,
  after the instructions which General Lamothe will furnish have been carried
  out."</p>

  <p>Then ensued a series of dispositions for the troops, and the whole was
  signed by Mallet.</p>

  <p>When Soulier had read this letter, Mallet, who pretended to be General
  Lamothe, handed him the document already given, relating to the assembly of
  the Senate, and its decisions. Then he gave him the Order for the Day, for
  the 23rd and 24th October.</p>

  <p>Colonel Soulier, raised from sleep, out of health, bewildered, did not for
  a moment mistrust the messenger, or the documents handed to him. He hastened
  at once to put in execution the orders he had received.</p>

  <p>The same proceedings were gone through in the barracks of Les Minimes, and
  of Picpus; the decree of the Senate, the Order of the Day, and a
  Proclamation, were read by torchlight.</p>

  <p>Everywhere the same success. The officers had not the smallest doubt as to
  the authenticity of the papers presented to them. Everywhere also the
  Proclamation announcing the death of the Emperor, the cessation of the
  Empire, and the establishment of the Provisional Government was being
  placarded about.</p>

  <p>At 6 A.M., at the head of a troop, Mallet, still acting as General
  Lamothe, marched before the prison of La Force, and the Governor was ordered
  to open the gates. The Decree of the Senate and the Order of the Day were
  read to him, and he was required at once to discharge three state prisoners
  he held, General Guidal, Lahorie, and a Corsican, Bocchejampe, together with
  certain officers there confined. He did as required, and Mallet separated his
  troops into four detachments, keeping one under his own command, and placing
  the others under the orders of Guidal, Lahorie and Bocchejampe.</p>

  <p>Guidal and Lahorie, by his orders, now marched to the Ministry of Police,
  where they arrested Savary, Duke of Rovigo, Minister of Police. At the same
  time Boutreux, another confederate, had gone to the prefecture of the Paris
  police, had arrested the prefect, Pasquier, and sent him to be confined in La
  Force.</p>

  <p>Mallet, now at the head of 150 men, went to the État-Major de-la-place, to
  go through the same farce with the Commandant-de-place, and get him to
  subscribe the Order for the Day. Count Hullin refused. Mallet presented a
  pistol at his head, fired, and Hullin fell covered with blood to the ground.
  Mallet left him for dead, but fortunately only his jaw was broken. By means
  of a forged order addressed to the commandant of one of the regiments of the
  paid guard of Paris, he occupied the National Bank, in which, at the time,
  there was a considerable treasure in specie.</p>

  <p>The État-Major of Paris was a post of the highest importance, as it was
  the headquarters of the whole military authority in Paris. Before Mallet
  approached it, he sent a packet to the Adjutant-General Doucet, of a similar
  tenor to that given to Soulier and the other colonels, and containing his
  nomination as general of brigade, and a treasury order for a hundred thousand
  francs.</p>

  <p>Soulier, Colonel of the 10th Cohort, obeying the orders he had received,
  the authenticity of which he did not for a moment dispute, had in the
  meantime made himself master of the Hôtel-de-Ville, and had stationed a
  strong force in the square before the building. Frochot, Prefect of the
  Seine, was riding into Paris from his country house at half-past eight in the
  morning, when he was met by his servants, in great excitement, with a note
  from Mallet, on the outside of which were written the ominous words "Fuit
  Imperator." Now it so happened that no tidings of the Emperor had been
  received for twenty-five days, and much uneasiness was felt concerning him.
  When Frochot therefore received this notice, he believed it, and hurried to
  the Hôtel-de-Ville. There he received a despatch from Mallet, under the title
  of Governor of Paris, ordering him to make ready the principal apartment in
  the building for the use of the Provisional Government. Not for a moment did
  Frochot remember that&mdash;even if the Emperor were dead, there was the
  young Napoleon, to whom his allegiance was due; he at once obeyed the orders
  he had received, and began to make the Hôtel ready for the meeting of the
  Provisional Government. Afterwards when he was reminded that there was a son
  to Napoleon, and that his duty was to support him, Frochot answered, "Ah! I
  forgot that. I was distracted with the news."</p>

  <p>By means of the forged orders despatched everywhere, all the barriers of
  Paris had been seized and were closed, and positive orders were issued that
  no one was to be allowed to enter or leave Paris.</p>

  <p>Mallet now drew up before the État-Major-Général, still accompanied and
  obeyed by the officer and detachment. Nothing was wanting now but the command
  of the adjutant-general's office to give to Mallet the entire direction of
  the military force of Paris, with command of the telegraph, and with it of
  all France. With that, and with the treasury already seized, he would be
  master of the situation. In another ten minutes Paris would be in his hand,
  and with Paris the whole of France.</p>

  <p>An accident&mdash;an accident only&mdash;at that moment saved the throne
  of Napoleon. Doucet was a little suspicious about the orders&mdash;or allowed
  it afterwards to be supposed that he was. He read them, and stood in
  perplexity. He would have put what doubts presented themselves aside, had it
  not been for his aide-de-camp, Laborde. It happened that Laborde had had
  charge of Mallet in La Force, and had seen him there quite recently. He came
  down to enter the room where was Doucet, standing in doubt before Mallet.
  Mallet's guard was before the door, and would have prevented him from
  entering; however, he peremptorily called to them to suffer him to pass, and
  the men, accustomed to obey his voice, allowed him to enter. The moment he
  saw Mallet in his general's uniform, he recognised him and said,
  "But&mdash;how the devil!&mdash; That is my prisoner. How came he to escape?"
  Doucet still hesitated, and attempted to explain, when Laborde cut his
  superior officer short with, "There is something wrong here. Arrest the
  fellow, and I will go at once to the minister of police."</p>

  <p>Mallet put his hand in his pocket to draw out the pistol with which he had
  shot Hullin, when the gesture was observed in a mirror opposite, and before
  he had time to draw and cock the pistol, Doucet and Laborde were on him, and
  had disarmed him.</p>

  <p>Laborde, with great promptitude, threw open the door, and announced to the
  soldiers the deceit that had been practised on them, and assured them that
  the tidings of the death of the Emperor were false.</p>

  <p>The arrest of Mallet disconcerted the whole conspiracy. Had Generals
  Lahorie and Guidal been men of decision and resolution they might still have
  saved it, but this they were not; though at the head of considerable bodies
  of men, the moment they saw that their chief had met with a hitch in carrying
  out his plan, they concluded that all was lost, and made the best of their
  way from their posts to places of concealment.</p>

  <p>It was not till 8 o'clock that Saulnier, General Secretary of Police,
  heard of the arrest and imprisonment of his chief, Savary, Duke of Rovigo. He
  at once hastened to Cambaçérès, the President of the Ministry in the absence
  of the Emperor, and astonished and alarmed him with the tidings. Then
  Saulnier hastened to Hullin, whom he found weltering in his blood, and unable
  to speak.</p>

  <p>Baron Pasquier, released from La Force, attempted to return to his
  prefecture. The soldiers posted before it refused to admit him, and
  threatened to shoot him, believing that he had escaped from prison, and he
  was obliged to take refuge in an adjoining house. Laborde, who about noon
  came there, was arrested by the soldiers, and conducted by them as a prisoner
  to the État-Major-Gênéral, to deliver him over to General Mallet; and it was
  with difficulty that they could be persuaded that they had been deceived, and
  that Mallet was himself, at that moment, in irons.</p>

  <p>Savary, released from La Force, had Mallet and the rest of the
  conspirators brought before him. Soulier also, for having given too ready a
  credence to the forged orders, was also placed under arrest, to be tried
  along with the organisers and carriers out of the plot.</p>

  <p>Mallet confessed with great composure that he had planned the whole, but
  he peremptorily refused to say whether he had aiders or sympathisers
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Lahorie could not deny that he had taken an active part, but declared that
  it was against his will, his whole intention being to make a run for the
  United States, there to spend the rest of his days in tranquillity. He
  asserted that he had really believed that the Emperor was dead.</p>

  <p>Guidal tried to pass the whole off as a joke; but when he saw that he was
  being tried for his life, he became greatly and abjectly alarmed.</p>

  <p>Next day the generals and those in the army who were under charge were
  brought before a military commission. Saulnier had an interesting interview
  with Mallet that day. He passed through the hall where Mallet was dining,
  when the prisoner complained that he was not allowed the use of a knife.
  Saulnier at once ordered that he might be permitted one; and this
  consideration seems to have touched Mallet, for he spoke with more frankness
  to Saulnier than he did before his judges. When the General Secretary of
  Police asked him how he could dream of success attending such a mad
  enterprise, Mallet replied, "I had already three regiments of infantry on my
  side. Very shortly I would have been surrounded by the thousands who are
  weary of the Napoleonic yoke, and are longing for a change of order. Now, I
  was convinced that the moment the news of my success in Paris reached him,
  Napoleon would leave his army and fly home, I would have been prepared for
  him at Mayence, and have had him shot there. If it had not been for the
  cowardice of Guidal and Lahorie, my plot would have succeeded. I had resolved
  to collect 50,000 men at Chalons sur Marne to cover Paris. The promise I
  would have made to send all the conscripts to their homes, the moment the
  crisis was over, would have rallied all the soldiers to my side."</p>

  <p>On October 23, the prisoners to the number of twenty-four were tried, and
  fourteen were condemned to be shot, among these, Mallet, Guidai, Lahorie, and
  the unfortunate Soulier. Mallet at the trial behaved with great intrepidity.
  "Who are your accomplices?" asked the President. "The whole of France,"
  answered Mallet, "and if I had succeeded, you yourself at their head. One who
  openly attacks a government by force, if he fails, expects to die." When he
  was asked to make his defence, "Monsieur," he said, "a man who has
  constituted himself defender of the rights of his Fatherland, needs no
  defence."</p>

  <p>Soulier put in as an apology, that the news of the death of the Emperor
  had produced such a sudorific effect on him, that he had been obliged to
  change his shirt four times in a quarter of an hour. This was not considered
  sufficient to establish his attachment to the Imperial government.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon of the same day the fourteen were conveyed to the plain
  of Grenelle to be shot, when pardon was accorded by the Empress Regent to two
  of the condemned, the Corporal Rateau, and Colonel Rabbe. When the procession
  passed through the Rue Grenelle, Mallet saw a group of students looking on;
  "Young men," he called to them, "remember the 23rd October." Arrived on the
  place of execution, some of the condemned cried out, "Vive l'empereur!" only
  a few "Vive la République."</p>

  <p>Mallet requested that his eyes might not be bandaged, and maintained the
  utmost coolness. He received permission, at his own desire, to give the
  requisite orders to the soldiers drawn up to shoot him and his party.
  "Peloton! Present!" The soldiers, moved by the tragic catastrophe, obeyed,
  but not promptly. "That is bad!" called Mallet, "imagine you are before the
  foe. Once again&mdash;Attention!&mdash;Present!" This time it was better.
  "Not so bad this time, but still not well," said the General; "now pay
  attention, and mind, when I say Fire, that all your guns are discharged as
  one. It is a good lesson for you to see how brave men die. Now then, again,
  Attention!" For a quarter of an hour he put the men through their drill, till
  he observed that his comrades were in the most deplorable condition. Some had
  fainted, some were in convulsions. Then he gave the command: Fire! the guns
  rattled and the ten fell to the ground, never to rise again. Mallet alone
  reeled, for a moment or two maintaining his feet, and then he also fell over,
  without a sound, and was dead.</p>

  <p>"But for the singular accident," says Savary, "which caused the arrest of
  the Minister of War to fail, Mallet, in a few moments, would have been master
  of almost everything; and in a country so much influenced by the contagion of
  example, there is no saying where his success would have stopped. He would
  have had possession of the treasury, then extremely rich; the post office,
  the telegraph, and the command of the hundred cohorts of the National Guard.
  He would soon have learned the alarming situation in Russia; and nothing
  could have prevented him from making prisoner of the Emperor himself if he
  returned alone, or from marching to meet him, if he had come at the head of
  his shattered forces."</p>

  <p>As Alison says, "When the news reached Napoleon, one only idea took
  possession of his imagination&mdash;that in this crisis the succession of his
  son was, by common consent, set aside; one only truth was ever present to his
  mind&mdash;that the Imperial Crown rested on himself alone. The fatal truth
  was brought home to him that the Revolution had destroyed the foundations of
  hereditary succession; and that the greatest achievements by him who wore the
  diadem afforded no security that it would descend to his progeny. These
  reflections, which seem to have burst on Napoleon all at once, when the news
  of this extraordinary affair reached him in Russia, weighed him down more
  than all the disasters of the Moscow retreat."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; SCHWEINICHEN'S MEMOIRS</h2>

  <p class="first">MEMOIRS, says Addison, in the <i>Tatler</i>, are so
  untrustworthy, so stuffed with lies, that, "I do hereby give notice to all
  booksellers and translators whatsoever, that the word <i>memoir</i> is French
  for a novel; and to require of them, that they sell and translate it
  accordingly."</p>

  <p>There are, however, some memoirs that are trustworthy and dull, and
  others, again, that are conspicuously trustworthy, and yet are as
  entertaining as a novel, and to this latter category belong the memoirs of
  Hans von Schweinichen, the Silesian Knight, Marshal and Chamberlain to the
  Dukes of Liegnitz and Brieg at the close of the 16th century. Scherr, a well
  known writer on German Culture, and a scrupulous observer and annotator of
  all that is ugly and unseemly in the past, says of the diary of Schweinichen:
  "It carries us into a noble family at the end of the 16th century and reveals
  boorish meanness, coarseness and lack of culture." That is, in a measure,
  true, but, as is invariably the case with Scherr, he leaves out of sight all
  the redeeming elements, and there are many, that this transparently sincere
  diarist discloses.</p>

  <p>The MS. was first discovered and published in 1823, by Büsching; it was
  republished in 1878 at Breslau by Oesterley. The diary extends to the year
  1602, and Schweinichen begins with an account of his birth in 1552, and his
  childish years. But we are wrong in saying that he begins with his
  birth&mdash;characteristic of the protestant theological spirit of his times,
  he begins with a confession of his faith.</p>

  <p>As a picture of the manners and customs of the highest classes in the age
  just after the Reformation it is unrivalled for its minuteness, and for its
  interest. The writer, who had not an idea that his diary would be printed,
  wrote for his own amusement, and, without intending it, drew a perfect
  portraiture of himself, without exaggeration of his virtues and observation
  of his faults; indeed the virtues we admire in him, he hardly recognised as
  virtues, and scarcely considered as serious the faults we deplore. In reading
  his truthful record we are angry with him, and yet, he makes us love and
  respect him, and acknowledge what sterling goodness, integrity, fidelity and
  honour were in the man.</p>

  <p>Hans was son of George, Knight of Schweinichen and Mertschütz, and was
  born in the Castle of Gröditzberg belonging to the Dukes of Silesia, of which
  his father was castellan, and warden of the Ducal Estates thereabouts. The
  Schweinichens were a very ancient noble Silesian family, and Hans could prove
  his purity of blood through the sixteen descents, eight paternal and eight
  maternal.</p>

  <p>In 1559, Duke Frederick III. was summoned before the Emperor Ferdinand I.
  at Breslau, to answer the accusations of extravagance and oppression brought
  against him by the Silesian Estates, and was deposed, imprisoned, and his son
  Henry XI. given the Ducal crown instead. The deposition of the Duke obliged
  the father of our hero to leave Gröditzberg and retire to his own estates,
  where Hans was given the village notary as teacher in reading and writing for
  a couple of years, and was then sent, young noble though he was, to keep the
  geese for the family. However, as he played tricks with the geese, put spills
  into their beaks, pegging them open, the flock was then withdrawn from his
  charge. This reminds us of Grettir the Strong, the Icelandic hero, who also
  as a boy was sent to drive the family geese to pasture, and who maltreated
  his charge.</p>

  <p>His father sent Hans to be page to the imprisoned Duke Frederick at
  Liegnitz, where also he was to study with the Duke's younger son, afterwards
  Frederick IV. Hans tells us he did not get as many whippings as his
  companion, because he slipped his money-allowance into the tutor's palm, and
  so his delinquencies were passed over. As page, he had to serve the Duke at
  table. A certain measure of wine was allowed the imprisoned Duke daily by his
  son, the reigning Duke; what he did not drink every day, Hans was required to
  empty into a cask, and when the cask was full, the Duke invited some good
  topers to him, and they sat and drank the cask out, then rolled over on the
  floor. All night Hans had to sit or lie on the floor and watch the drunken
  Duke.</p>

  <p>Duke Frederick took a dislike to the chaplain, and scribbled a lampoon on
  him, which may be thus rendered, without injustice to the
  original:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"All the mischief ever done Twixt the old Duke and his
  son,<br>
  Comes from that curs't snuffy one Franconian Parson Cut-and-run."</p>

  <p>The Duke ordered Hans to pin this to the pulpit cushion, and he did so.
  When the pastor ascended the pulpit he saw the paper, and instead of a text
  read it out. The reigning Duke Henry was very angry, and Hans was made the
  scape-goat, and sent home in disgrace to his father.</p>

  <p>In 1564, Hans attended his father, himself as page, his father as Marshal,
  when Duke Henry and his Duchess visited Stuttgard and Dresden. Pages were not
  then allowed to sit astride a horse, they stood in a sort of stirrup slung to
  the pommel, to which they held. At Dresden old Schweinichen ran a tilt in a
  tournament with the elector Augustus and unhorsed him, but had sufficient
  courtesy to at once throw himself off his own horse, as though he also had
  been cast by the elector. This so gratified the latter, that he sent old
  Schweinichen a gold chain, and a double florin worth about 4 shillings to the
  young one.</p>

  <p>When Hans was fifteen, he went to the marriage of Duke Wenceslas of
  Teschen with the daughter of Duke Franz of Saxony, and received from his
  father a present of a sword, which, he tells us, cost his father a little
  under a pound. One of the interesting features of this diary is that Hans
  enters the value of everything. For instance, we are given the price of
  wheat, barley, rye, oats, meat, &amp;c., in 1562, and we learn from this that
  all kinds of grain cost one fifth or one sixth of what it costs now, and that
  meat&mdash;mutton, was one eighteenth or one twentieth the present cost. For
  a thaler, 3 shillings, in 1562 as much food could be purchased as would now
  cost from 25 to 30 shillings. Hans tells us what pocket money he received
  from his parents; he put a value on every present he was given, and tells
  what everything cost him which he give away.</p>

  <p>In the early spring of 1569 Duke Henry XI. went to Lublin in Poland to a
  diet. King Sigismund was old, and the Duke hoped to get elected to the
  kingdom of Poland on his death. This was a costly expedition, as the Duke had
  to make many presents, and to go in great state. Hans went with him, and
  gives an infinitely droll account of their reception, the miserable housing,
  his own dress, one leg black, the other yellow, and how many ells of ribbon
  went to make the bows on his jacket. His father and he, and a nobleman called
  Zedlitz and his son were put in a garret under the tiles in bitter
  frost&mdash;and "faith," says Hans, "our pigs at home are warmer in their
  styes."</p>

  <p>This expedition which led to no such result as the Duke hoped, exhausted
  his treasury, and exasperated the Silesian Estates. All the nobles had to
  stand surety for their Duke, Schweinichen and the rest to the amount
  of&mdash;in modern money £100,000.</p>

  <p>When Hans was aged eighteen he was drunk for the first time in his life,
  so drunk that he lay like a dead man for two days and two nights, and his
  life was in danger.</p>

  <p>Portia characterised the German as a drunkard, she liked him "very vilely
  in the morning, when he is sober; and most vilely in the afternoon, when he
  is drunk. Set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket: for, if
  the devil be within, and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I
  will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge."</p>

  <p>How true this characterisation was of the old German noble, Schweinichen's
  memoirs show; it is a record of drunken bouts at small intervals. There was
  no escape, he who would live at court must drink and get drunken.</p>

  <p>At the age of nineteen old Schweinichen made his son keep the accounts at
  home, and look after the mill; he had the charge of the fish-ponds, and
  attended to the thrashing of the corn, and the feeding of the horses and
  cattle.</p>

  <p>Once Hans was invited to a wedding, and met at it four sisters from
  Glogau, two were widows and two unmarried. Their maiden name was Von Schaben.
  Hans, aged twenty, danced with the youngest a good deal, and before leaving
  invited the four sisters to pay his father and him a visit. A friend of his
  called Eicholz galloped ahead to forewarn old Schweinichen. Some hours later
  up drove Hans in a waggon with the four sisters; but he did not dare to bring
  them in till he had seen his father, so he went into the house, and was at
  once saluted with a burst of laughter, and the shout, "Here comes the
  bridegroom," and Eicholz sang at the top of his voice an improvised
  verse:</p>

  <p class="verse">"Rosie von Schaben Hans er will haben."</p>

  <p>"Where are the ladies?" asked the old knight.</p>

  <p>"In the waggon outside," answered Hans.</p>

  <p>"Send for the fiddlers, bring them in. We will eat, drink, dance and be
  merry," said the old man.</p>

  <p>But Hans was offended at being boisterously saluted as bridegroom, and he
  now kept Rosie at a distance. Somewhat later, the Duke tried to get him to
  marry a charming young heiress called Hese von Promnitz, and very amusing is
  Hans' account of how he kept himself clear of engagement. When he first met
  her at court she was aged fourteen, and was passionately fond of sugar. Hans
  says he spent as much as £3 in our modern money on sweets for her, but he
  would make no proposal, because, as he concluded, she was too young to be
  able "to cook a bowl of soup." Two years passed, and then an old fellow
  called Geisler, "looking more like a Jew than a gentleman," who offered Hese
  a box of sweets every day, proposed for her. Hese would not answer till she
  knew the intentions of Hans, and she frankly asked him whether he meant to
  propose for her hand or not. "My heart's best love, Hese," answered
  Schweinichen, "at the right time, and when God wills I shall marry, but I do
  not think I can do that for three years. So follow your own desires, take the
  old Jew, or wait, as you like."</p>

  <p>Hese said she would wait any number of years for Hans. This made Hans the
  colder. The Duke determined that the matter should be settled one way or
  other at once, so he sent a crown of gold roses to Hans, and said it was to
  be Hese's bridal wreath, if he desired that she should wear it for him, he
  was to lay hold of it; Hans thereupon put his hands behind his back. Then he
  went to his Schweinichen coat-of-arms and painted under it the motto, "I bide
  my time, when the old man dies, I'll get the prize." This Geisler read,
  and&mdash;says Hans, didn't like.</p>

  <p>Hans was now installed as gentleman-in-waiting to the Duke, and was
  henceforth always about his person. He got for his service free bed and
  board, a gala coat that cost in our modern money about £36, and an every day
  livery costing £18. His father made him a small allowance, but pay in
  addition to liveries and keep he got none. The Duke's great amusement
  consisted in mumming. For a whole year he rambled about every evening in
  masquerade, dropping in on the burghers unexpectedly. Some were, we are told,
  pleased to see and entertain him, others objected to these impromptu visits.
  The special costume in which the Duke delighted to run about the town making
  these visits was that of a Nun. Hans admits that this was very distasteful to
  him, but he could not help himself, he was obliged to accommodate himself to
  the whims of his master. He made an effort to free himself from the service
  of the Duke, so as to go out of the country to some other court&mdash;he felt
  intuitively that this association would be fatal to his best interests, but
  the Duke at once took him by his better side, pleaded with him to remain and
  be faithful to him, his proper master and sovereign, and Hans with misgivings
  at heart consented.</p>

  <p>There was at Court an old lady, Frau von Kittlitz, who acted as
  stewardess, and exercised great influence over the Duke, whom she had known
  from a boy. The Duchess resented her managing ways, and interference, and was
  jealous of her influence. One day in 1575 she refused to come down from her
  room and dine with the Duke unless the old Kittlitz were sent to sit at the
  table below the dais. This led to words and hot blood on both sides. The
  Duchess used a gross expression in reference to the stewardess, and the Duke
  who had already some wine under his belt, struck the Duchess in the face,
  saying, "I'll teach you not to call people names they do not deserve." Hans,
  who was present, threw himself between the angry couple; the Duke stormed and
  struck about. Hans entreated the Duchess to retire, and then he stood in her
  door and prevented the Duke following, though he shouted, "She is my wife, I
  can serve her as I like. Who are you to poke yourself in between married
  folk?"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Duchess had locked herself in, Hans escaped and fled; but
  an hour after the Duke sent for him, and stormed at him again for his
  meddlesomeness. Hans entreated the Duke to be quiet and get reconciled to the
  Duchess, but he would not hear of it, and dismissed Schweinichen. A quarter
  of an hour later another messenger came from his master, and Hans returned to
  him, to find him in a better mood. "Hans," said his Highness, "try if you
  can't get my wife to come round and come down to table&mdash;all fun is at an
  end with this."</p>

  <p>Hans went up and was admitted. The Duchess, in a towering rage, had
  already written a letter to her brother the Margrave of Anspach, telling him
  how her husband had struck her in the face and given her a black eye, and she
  had already dispatched a messenger with the letter. After much arguing, Hans
  wrung from her her consent to come down, on two conditions, one that the Duke
  should visit her at once and beg her pardon, the other that the old Kittlitz
  should sit at the table with the pages. The Duke was now in a yielding mood
  and ate his leek humbly. The Duchess consented to tell the Court that she had
  got her black eye from striking her face against a lamp, and the Duke ordered
  ten trumpeters and a kettledrum to make all the noise they could to celebrate
  the reconciliation.</p>

  <p>The Duchess in an aside to Schweinichen admitted that she had been rash
  and unjust, and regretted having sent off that letter. An unlucky
  letter&mdash;says our author&mdash;for it cost the duchy untold gold and
  years of trouble.</p>

  <p>The Duke had made several visits to Poland, chasing that Jack o'
  lantern&mdash;the Polish crown, and it had cost him so much money that he had
  quarrelled with his Estates, bullied and oppressed his subjects to extort
  money, and at last the Estates appealed to the Emperor against him, as they
  had against his father; and the Emperor summoned him to Prague. The Duke had
  great difficulty in scraping together money enough to convey him so far; and
  on reaching Prague, he begged permission of the Kaiser to be allowed to visit
  the Electors and the Free Cities, and see whether he could not obtain from
  them some relief from his embarrassments, and money wherewith to pacify the
  angry Estates of the Silesian Duchy. The consent required was given, and then
  the Duke with his faithful Schweinichen, and several other retainers, started
  on a grand begging and borrowing round of the Empire. Hans was constituted
  treasurer, and he had in his purse about £400. The Duke took with him five
  squires, two pages, three serving men, a cook, and several kitchen boys, one
  carriage drawn by six horses, another by four. And not only was this train to
  make the round of the Empire, but also to visit Italy&mdash;and all on
  £400.</p>

  <p>The first visit was paid, three days' journey from Prague, at Theusing to
  a half-sister of the Duchess. She received him coolly, and lectured him on
  his conduct to his wife. When the Duke asked her to lend him money, she
  answered that she would pay his expenses home, if he chose to go back to
  Liegnitz, but not one penny otherwise should he have. Not content with this
  refusal, the Duke went on to Nurnberg, where he sent Hans to the town council
  to invite them to lend him money; he asked for 4,000 florins. The council
  declined the honour. The two daughters of the Duke were in the charge of the
  Margrave of Anspach, their mother's brother. The Duke sent Hans to Anspach to
  urge the Margrave to send the little girls to him, or invite him to visit
  Anspach to see them. He was shy of visiting his brother-in-law uninvited,
  because of the box in the ear and the black eye. He confided to Hans that if
  he got his children at Nurnberg, he would not return them to their uncle,
  without a loan or a honorarium.</p>

  <p>This shabby transaction was not to Schweinichen's taste, but he was
  obliged to undertake it. It proved unsuccessful, the Margrave refused to give
  up the children till the Duke returned to his wife and duchy and set a better
  example.</p>

  <p>Whilst Hans was away, the Duke won a large sum of money at play, enough to
  pay his own bill, but instead of doing this with it, he had it melted up and
  made into silver cups. When he came to leave Nurnberg he was unable to pay
  his inn bill, and obliged to leave in pawn with the taverner a valuable
  jewel. Then he and his suite went to Augsburg and settled into an inn till
  the town council could agree to lend him money.</p>

  <p>One day, whilst there, Hans was invited to a wedding. The Duke wanted to
  go also, but, as he was not invited, he went as Hans' servant, but got so
  drunk that Hans was obliged to carry him home to the tavern, after which he
  returned to the wedding. In the evening, when dancing began, the Duke
  reappeared, he had slept off his drunkenness and was fresh for more
  entertainment. He was now recognized, and according to etiquette, two town
  councillors, in robes of office and gold chains, danced solemnly before his
  Highness. Hans tells us that it was customary for all dances to be led by two
  persons habited in scarlet with white sleeves, and these called the dance and
  set the figures, no one might execute any figure or do anything which had not
  been done by the leaders. Now as Hans vows he never saw so many pretty girls
  anywhere as on that evening, he tipped the leaders with half a thaler to kiss
  each other, whereupon the two solemn dancing councillors had also to kiss
  each other, and the Duke, nothing loth, his partner, and Hans, with zest,
  his. That evening he gave plenty of kisses, and what with the many lights,
  and the music and the dancing and the pretty girls he thought himself in
  Paradise. Shortly after this, the Duke was invited to dine with Fugger, the
  merchant prince, who showed him his treasury, gold to the worth of a million,
  and one tower lined within from top half way down with nothing but silver
  thalers. The Duke's mouth watered, and he graciously invited Fugger to lend
  him £5,000; this the merchant declined, but made him a present of 200 crowns
  and a good horse. The town council consented to lend the Duke £1,200 on his
  I.O.U. for a year; and then to pay his host he melted up his silver mugs
  again, pawned his plate and gave him a promissory note for two months.</p>

  <p>From Augsburg the Duke went about the abbeys, trying to squeeze loans out
  of the abbots, but found that they had always the excuse ready, that they
  would not lend to Lutheran princes. Then he stuck on in the abbeys, eating up
  all their provisions and rioting in their guest-apartments, till the abbots
  were fain to make him a present to be rid of him.</p>

  <p>All at once an opening offered for the Duke to gain both renown and money.
  Henry I. of Condé was at the court of the Elector Palatine at Heidelsberg,
  soliciting assistance in behalf of the Huguenots against the King of France.
  The Elector agreed to send a force under his son John Casimir, and the Duke
  of Liegnitz offered his services, which were readily accepted. He was to lead
  the rearguard, and to receive a liberal pay for his services. Whilst he was
  collecting this force and getting underway, John Casimir and the Prince of
  Condé marched through Lorraine to Metz, and Hans went with John Casimir. He
  trusted he was now on his way to fortune. But it was not so to be. The Duke,
  his master, insisted that he should return to him, and Hans, on doing so,
  found him rioting and gambling away, at Frankfort and Nassau, the money paid
  him in advance for his useless services. Almost the first duty imposed on
  Hans, on his return, was to negociate a loan for £5,000 with the magistrates
  of Frankfort, which was peremptorily refused; whereupon the Duke went to
  Cologne and stayed there seven months, endeavouring to cajole the town
  council there into advancing him money.</p>

  <p>But we can not follow any further the miserable story of the degradation
  of the Silesian Duke, till at the beginning of the new year, 1577, the Duke
  ran away from the town of Emmerich, leaving his servants to pay his debts as
  best they could. Hans sold the horses and whatever was left, and then, not
  sorry to be quit of such a master, returned on foot to his Silesian home.</p>

  <p>It is, perhaps, worth while quoting Duke Henry's letter, which Hans found
  in the morning announcing his master's evasion.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Hans,&mdash;Here is a chain, do what you can with it.
  Weigh it and sell it, also the horses for ready money; I will not pillow my
  head in feathers till, by God's help, I have got some money, to enable me to
  clear out of this vile land, and away from these people. Good morning,
  best-loved Hans.</p>

  <p class="letter">"With mine own hand, HENRY, DUKE."</p><br>

  <p>As he neared home, sad news reached Hans. The Ducal creditors had come
  down on his father, who had made himself responsible, and had seized the
  family estates; whereat the old man's heart broke, and he had died in
  January. When Hans heard this, he sat for two hours on a stone beside the
  road, utterly unmanned, before he could recover himself sufficiently to
  pursue his journey.</p>

  <p>In the meantime an Imperial commission had sat on the Duke, deposed him,
  and appointed his brother Frederick duke in his room. Schweinichen's fidelity
  to Duke Henry ensured his disfavour with Duke Frederick, and he was not
  summoned to court, but was left quietly at Mertschütz to do his best along
  with his brother to bring the family affairs into some sort of order. His old
  master did not, however, allow him much rest. By the Imperial decision, he
  was to be provided with a daily allowance of money, food and wine. This drew
  Duke Henry home, and no sooner was he back in Silesia than he insisted on
  Hans returning to his service, and for some years more he led the faithful
  soul a troubled life, and involved him in miserable pecuniary perplexities.
  This was the more trying to Hans as he had now fallen in love with Margaret
  von Schellendorff, whom he married eventually. The tenderness and goodness of
  Schweinichen's heart break out whenever he speaks of his dear Margaretta, and
  of the children which came and were taken from him. His sorrows as he
  lingered over the sick-beds of his little ones, and the closeness with which
  he was drawn by domestic bereavements and pecuniary distresses, to his
  Margaretta, come out clearly in his narrative. The whole story is far too
  long to tell in its entirety. Hans was a voluminous diarist. His memoirs
  cease at the year 1602, when he was suffering from gout, but he lived on some
  years longer.</p>

  <p>In the church of S. John at Liegnitz was at one time his monument, with
  life-sized figure of Hans von Schweinichen, and above it his banner and an
  inscription stating that he died on the 23rd Aug., 1616. Alas! the hand of
  the destroyer has been there. The church and monument are destroyed, and we
  can no longer see what manner of face Hans wore; but of the inner man, of a
  good, faithful, God fearing, and loving soul, strong and true, he has himself
  left us the most accurate portrait in his precious memoirs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE LOCKSMITH GAMAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">AMONG the many episodes of the French Revolution there is
  one which deserves to be somewhat closely examined, because of the gravity of
  the accusation which it involves against the King and Queen, and because a
  good deal of controversy has raged round it. The episode is that of the
  locksmith Gamain, whom the King and Queen are charged with having attempted
  to poison.</p>

  <p>That the accusation was believed during "the Terror" goes without saying;
  the heated heads and angry hearts at that time were in no condition to sift
  evidence with impartiality. Afterwards, the charge was regarded as
  preposterous, till the late M. Paul Lacroix&mdash;better known as le
  Bibliophile Jacob&mdash;a student of history, very careful and diligent as a
  collector, gave it a new spell of life in 1836, when he reformulated the
  accusation in a <i>feuilleton</i> of the <i>Siècle</i>. Not content to let it
  sleep or die in the ephemeral pages of a newspaper, he republished the whole
  story in 1838, in his "Dissertations sur quelques points curieux de
  l'histoire de France." This he again reproduced in his "Curiosités de
  l'histoire de France," in 1858. M. Louis Blanc, convinced that the case was
  made out, has reasserted the charge in his work on the French Revolution, and
  it has since been accepted by popular writers&mdash;as
  Décembre-Alonnier&mdash;who seek to justify the execution of the King and
  Queen, and to glorify the Revolution.</p>

  <p>M. Thiers rejected the accusation; M. Eckard pointed out the
  improbabilities in the story in the "Biographie Universelle," and M.
  Mortimer-Ternaux has also shown its falsity in his "Histoire de la Terreur;"
  and finally, M. Le Roy, librarian of Versailles, in 1867, devoted his special
  attention to it, and completely disproved the poisoning of Gamain. But in
  spite of disproval the slanderous accusation does not die, and no doubt is
  still largely believed in Paris.</p>

  <p>So tenacious of life is a lie&mdash;like the bacteria that can be steeped
  in sulphuric acid without destroying their vitality&mdash;that the story has
  been again recently raked up, and given to the public, from Lacroix, in a
  number of the Cornhill Magazine (December, 1887); the writer of course knew
  only Lacroix' myth, and had never seen how it had been disproved. It is well
  now to review the whole story.</p>

  <p>François Gamain was born at Versailles on August 29, 1751. He belonged to
  an hereditary locksmith family. His father Nicolas had been in the same
  trade, and had charge of the locks in the royal palaces in Versailles and
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The love of Louis XVI. for mechanical works is well known. He had a little
  workshop at Versailles, where he amused himself making locks, assisted by
  François Gamain, to whom he was much attached, and with whom he spent many
  hours in projecting and executing mechanical contrivances. The story is told
  of the Intendant Thierry, that when one day the King showed him a lock he had
  made, he replied, "Sire, when kings occupy themselves with the works of the
  common people, the common people will assume the functions of kings," but the
  <i>mot</i> was probably made after the fact.</p>

  <p>After the terrible days of the 5th and 6th of October, 1789, the King was
  brought to Paris. Gamain remained at Versailles, which was his home, and
  retained the King's full confidence.</p>

  <p>When, later, the King was surrounded by enemies, and he felt the necessity
  for having some secret place where he could conceal papers of importance
  which might yet fall into the hands of the rabble if the palace was again
  invaded, as it had been at Versailles, he sent for Gamain to make for him an
  iron chest in a place of concealment, that could only be opened by one
  knowing the secret of the lock.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the man was not as trustworthy as Louis XVI. supposed.
  Surrounded by those who had adopted the principles of the Revolution, and
  being a man without strong mind, he followed the current, and in 1792 he was
  nominated member of the Council General of the Commune of Versailles, and on
  September 24 he was one of the commissioners appointed "to cause to disappear
  all such paintings, sculptures, and inscriptions from the monuments of the
  Commune as might serve to recall royalty and despotism."</p>

  <p>The records of the debates of the Communal Council show that Gamain
  attended regularly and took part in the discussions, which were often
  tumultuous.</p>

  <p>The Queen heard of Gamain's Jacobinism, and warned the King, who, however,
  could not believe that Gamain would betray him. Marie Antoinette insisted on
  the most important papers being removed from the iron chest, and they were
  confided to Mme. de Campan.</p>

  <p>When the trial of the King was begun, on November 20, Gamain went to
  Roland, Minister of the Interior, and told him the secret of the iron chest.
  Roland, alarmed at the consequences of such a discovery, hastened to consult
  his wife, who was in reality more minister than himself.</p>

  <p>From August 10, a commission had been appointed to collect all the papers
  found in the Tuileries; this commission, therefore, ought to be made
  acquainted with the discovery; but here lay the danger. Mme. Roland, as an
  instrument of the Girondins, feared that among the papers in the chest might
  be discovered some which would show in what close relations the Girondins
  stood to the Court. She decided that her husband should go to the Tuileries,
  accompanied by Gamain, an architect, and a servant. The chest was opened by
  the locksmith, Roland removed all the papers, tied them up in a napkin, and
  took them home. They were taken the same day to the Convention; and the
  commission charged the minister with having abstracted such papers as would
  have been inconvenient to him to deliver up.</p>

  <p>When Roland surrendered the papers he declared, without naming Gamain,
  that they had been discovered in a hole in the wall closed by an iron door,
  behind a wainscot panel, in so secret a place "that they could not have been
  found had not the secret been disclosed by the workman who had himself made
  the place of concealment."</p>

  <p>On December 24 following, Gamain was summoned to Paris by the Convention
  to give his evidence to prove that a key discovered in the desk of Thierry de
  Ville-d'Avray fitted the iron chest.</p>

  <p>After the execution of the King, on January 21, 1793, the Convention sent
  deputies into all the departments "to stimulate the authorities to act with
  the energy requisite under the circumstances." Crassous was sent into the
  department of Seine-et-Oise; and not finding the municipality of Versailles,
  of which Gamain was a member, "up to the requisite pitch," he discharged them
  from office; and by a law of September 17, all such discharged functionaries
  were declared to be "suspected persons," who were liable to be brought before
  the revolutionary tribunal on that charge alone.</p>

  <p>Thus, in spite of all the proofs he had given of his fidelity to the
  principles of the Revolution, Gamain was at any moment liable to arrest, and
  to being brought before that terrible tribunal from which the only exit was
  to the guillotine. Moreover, Gamain had lost his place and emoluments as
  Court locksmith; he had fallen into great poverty, was without work, and
  without health.</p>

  <p>On April 27, 1794, he presented a petition to the Convention which was
  supported by Musset, the deputy and constitutional curé. "It was not enough,"
  said Musset from the tribune, "that the last of our tyrants should have
  delivered over thousands of citizens to be slain by the sword of the enemy.
  You will see by the petition I am about to read that he was familiarised with
  the most refined cruelty, and that he himself administered poison to the
  father of a family, in the hopes thereby of destroying evidence of his
  perfidy. You will see that his ferocious mind had adopted the maxim that to a
  king everything is permissible."</p>

  <p>After this preamble Musset read the petition of Gamain, which is as
  follows:</p>

  <p class="quote">"François Gamain, locksmith to the cabinets and to the
  laboratory of the late King, and for three years member of the Council
  General of the Commune of Versailles, declares that at the beginning of May
  1792 he was ordered to go to Paris. On reaching it, Capet required him to
  make a cupboard in the thickness of one of the walls of his room, and to
  fasten it with an iron door; and he further states that he was thus engaged
  up to the 22nd of the said month, and that he worked in the King's presence.
  When the chest was completed, Capet himself offered citizen Gamain a large
  tumbler of wine, and asked him to drink it, as he, the said Gamain, was very
  hot.</p>

  <p class="quote">"<i>A few hours later</i> he was attacked by a violent
  colic, which did not abate till he had taken two spoonfuls of elixir, which
  made him vomit all he had eaten and drunk that day. This was the prelude to a
  terrible illness, which lasted fourteen months, during which he lost the use
  of his limbs, and which has left him at present without hope of recovering
  his full health, and of working so as to provide for the necessities of his
  family."</p><br>

  <p>After reading the petition Musset added: "I hold in my hands the
  certificate of the doctors, that testifies to the bad state of the health of
  the citizen petitioner.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Citizens! If wickedness is common to kings, generosity is
  the prerogative of the free people. I demand that this petition be referred
  to the Committee of Public Assistance to be promptly dealt with. I demand
  that after the request all the papers relating to it be deposed in the
  national archives, as a monument of the atrocity of tyrants, and be inserted
  in the bulletin, that all those who have supposed that Capet did evil only at
  the instigation of others may know that crime was rooted in his very
  heart."</p>

  <p>This proposition was decreed. On May 17, 1794, the representative Peyssard
  mounted the tribune, and read the report of the Committee, which we must
  condense.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Citizens! At the tribunal of liberty the crimes of the
  oppressors of the human race stand to be judged. To paint a king in all his
  hideousness I need name only Louis XVI. This name sums in itself all crimes;
  it recalls a prodigy of iniquity and of perfidy. Hardly escaped from infancy,
  the germs of the ferocious perversity which characterise a despot appeared in
  him. His earliest sports were with blood, and his brutality grew with his
  years, and he delighted in wreaking his ferocity on all the animals he met.
  He was known to be cruel, treacherous, and murderous. The object of this
  report is to exhibit him to France cold-bloodedly offering a cup of poison to
  the unhappy artist whom he had just employed to construct a cupboard in which
  to conceal the plots of tyranny. It was no stranger he marked as his victim,
  but a workman whom he had employed for five-and-twenty years, and the father
  of a family, his own instructor in the locksmith's art. Monsters who thus
  treat their chosen servants, how will they deal with the rest of
  men?"</p><br>

  <p>The National Convention thereupon ordered that "François Gamain, poisoned
  by Louis Capet on May 22, 1792, should enjoy an annual pension of the sum of
  1,200 livres, dating from the day on which he was poisoned."</p>

  <p>It will be noticed by the most careless reader that the evidence is
  <i>nil</i>. Gamain does not feel the colic till some hours after he has drunk
  the wine; he had eaten or drunk other things besides during the day; and
  finally the testimony of the doctors is, not that he was poisoned, but that,
  at the time of his presenting the petition, he was in a bad state of health.
  Accordingly, all reasonable historians, unblinded by party passion, have
  scouted the idea of an attempt on Gamain's life by the King. Thus the matter
  would have remained had not M. Paul Lacroix taken it up and propped the old
  slander on new legs. We will take his account, which he pretends to have
  received from several persons to whom Gamain related it repeatedly. This is
  his <i>mise en scène</i>.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The old inhabitants of Versailles will remember with pity
  the man whom they often encountered alone, bowed on his stick like one bent
  with years. Gamain was aged only fifty-eight when he died, but he bore all
  the marks of decrepitude."</p>

  <p>Here is a blunder, to begin with; he died, as the Versailles registers
  testify, on May 8, 1795, and was accordingly only forty-four years
  old,&mdash;that is, he died <i>one</i> year after the grant of the annuity.
  M. Parrott, in his article on Gamain in the "Dictionnaire de la Révolution
  Française," says that he died in 1799, five years after having received his
  pension; but the Versailles registers are explicit.</p>

  <p>M. Lacroix goes on: "His hair had fallen off, and the little that remained
  had turned white over a brow furrowed deeply; the loss of his teeth made his
  cheeks hollow; his dull eyes only glared with sombre fire when the name of
  Louis XVI was pronounced. Sometimes even tears then filled them. Gamain lived
  very quietly with his family on his humble pension, which, notwithstanding
  the many changes of government, was always accorded him. It was not
  suppressed, lest the reason of its being granted should again be raked up
  before the public."</p>

  <p>As we have seen, Gamain died under the Government which granted the
  pension. M. Lacroix goes on to say "that the old locksmith bore to his dying
  day an implacable hatred of Louis XVI., whom he accused of having been guilty
  of an abominable act of treachery."</p>

  <p class="quote">"This act of treachery was the fixed and sole idea in
  Gamain's head, he recurred to it incessantly, and poured forth a flood of
  bitter and savage recriminations against the King. It was Gamain who
  disclosed the secret of the iron chest in the Tuileries, and the papers it
  contained, which furnished the chief accusation against Louis XVI.; it was
  he, therefore, who had, so to speak, prepared the guillotine for the royal
  head; it was he, finally, who provoked the decree of the Convention which
  blackened the memory of the King as that of a vulgar murderer. But this did
  not suffice the hate of Gamain, who went about everywhere pursuing the dead
  beyond the tomb, with his charge of having attempted murder as payment of
  life-long and devoted service. Gamain ordinarily passed his evenings in a
  cafe at Versailles, the name of which I have been told, but which I do not
  divulge lest I should make a mistake. He was generally in the society of two
  old notaries, who are still alive (in 1836), and of the doctor Lameyran, who
  attended him when he was poisoned. These three persons were prepared to
  attest all the particulars of the poisoning which had been proved at the
  <i>procès verbal</i>. Gamain, indeed, lacked witnesses to establish the
  incidents of the 22nd May, 1792, at the Tuileries; but his air of veracity
  and expression of pain, his accent of conviction, his face full of suffering,
  his burning eyes, his pathetic pantomime, were the guarantees of good
  faith."</p>

  <p>These three men, the notaries and the doctor, which latter M. Lacroix
  hints was living when he wrote, were his authorities for what follows. The
  notaries he does not name, nor the café where they met. His account published
  in the <i>Siècle</i> at once attracted attention, and M. Lacroix was
  challenged to produce his witnesses. As for M. Lameyran, the doctor, he had
  died in 1811; consequently his testimony was not to be had in 1836. The other
  doctor who had attended Gamain was M. Voisin, who died in 1823, but M. Le Roy
  asserts positively that in 1813 M. Voisin told him, "Never was Gamain
  poisoned. Lameyran and I had long attended him for chronic malady of the
  stomach. This is all we testified to in our certificate, when he applied for
  a pension. In our certificate we stated that he was in weak health&mdash;not
  a word was in it about poisoning, which existed only in his fancy."</p>

  <p>These certificates are no longer in existence. They were not preserved in
  the archives of the Convention. Even this fact is taken as evidence in favour
  of the attempt. M. Emile Bonnet, in an article on Gamain in the
  "Intermédiaire des Chercheurs," declares that they have been substracted
  since the Restoration of Charles;[8] but there is no trace in the archives of
  them ever having been there. Moreover, we have M. Le Roy's word that M.
  Voisin assured him he had not testified to poisoning, and, what is more
  important, we have Musset's declaration before the Convention that the
  certificate of the doctors "asserted the ill-health of the claimant." If
  there had been a word about poison in it, he would assuredly have said
  so.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[8] Le Bibliophile Jacob says the same: "Les pièces
  détournées maladroitement par la Restauration."</p>

  <p>M. Lacroix was asked to name his authorities&mdash;the two advocates who,
  as M. Lameyran was dead, were alive and would testify to the fact that they
  had heard the story from the lips of Gamain. He remained silent. He would not
  even name the café where they met, and which might lead to the
  identification. M. Eckard, who wrote the notice on Gamain in the "Biographie
  Universelle," consulted the family of the locksmith on the case, and was
  assured by them that the bad health of Gamain was due to no other cause than
  disappointment at the loss of his fortune, the privations he underwent, and,
  above all, his terror for his life after his dismissal from the Communal
  Council.</p>

  <p>We will now continue M. Lacroix's account, which he proceeds, not a little
  disingenuously, to put into the mouth of Gamain himself, so that the
  accusation may not be charged on the author.</p>

  <p class="quote">"On May 21, 1792," says Gamain, according to the
  "Bibliophile Jacob," "whilst I was working in my shop, a horseman drew up at
  my door and called me out. His disguise as a carter did not prevent me from
  recognising Durey, the King's forge assistant. I refused. I congratulated
  myself that evening at having done so, as the rumour spread in Versailles
  that the Tuileries had been attacked by the mob, but this did not really take
  place till a month later. Next morning Durey returned and showed me a note in
  the King's own hand, entreating me to lend my assistance in a difficult job
  past his unaided powers. My pride was flattered. I embraced my wife and
  children, without telling them whither I was going, but I promised to return
  that night. It was not without anxiety that they saw me depart with a
  stranger for Paris."</p>

  <p>We need merely point out that Durey was no stranger to the family: he had
  been for years associated daily with Gamain.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Durey conducted me to the Tuileries, where the King was
  guarded as in a prison. We went at once to the royal workshop, where Durey
  left me, whilst he went to announce my arrival. Whilst I was alone, I
  observed an iron door, recently forged, a mortise lock, well executed, and a
  little iron box with a secret spring which I did not at once discover. Then
  in came Durey with the King. 'The times are bad,' said Louis XVI., 'and I do
  not know how matters will end.' Then he showed me the works I had noticed,
  and said, 'What do you say to my skill? It took me ten days to execute these
  things. I am your apprentice, Gamain.' I protested my entire devotion. Then
  the King assured me that he always had confidence in me, and that he did not
  scruple to trust the fate of himself and his family in my hands. Thereupon he
  conducted me into the dark passage that led from his room to the chamber of
  the Dauphin. Durey lit a taper, and removed a panel in the passage, behind
  which I perceived a round hole, about two feet in diameter, bored in the
  wall. The King told me he intended to secrete his money in it, and that
  Durey, who had helped to make it, threw the dust and chips into the river
  during the night. Then the King told me that he was unable to fit the iron
  door to the hole unassisted. I went to work immediately. I went over all the
  parts of the lock, and got them into working order; then I fashioned a key to
  the lock, then made hinges and fastened them into the wall as firmly as I
  could, without letting the hammering be heard. The King helped as well as he
  was able, entreating me every moment to strike with less noise, and to be
  quicker over my work. The key was put in the little iron casket, and this
  casket was concealed under a slab of pavement in the corridor."</p><br>

  <p>It will be seen that this story does not agree with the account in the
  petition made by Gamain to the Convention. In that he said he was summoned to
  Paris at the beginning of the month of May, and that "Capet ordered him to
  make a cupboard in the thickness of the wall of his apartment, and to close
  it with an iron door, the whole of which was not accomplished till the 22nd
  of the same month." He was three weeks over the job, not a few hours. "I had
  been working," continues Gamain, or M. Lacroix for him, "for eight
  consecutive hours. The sweat poured from my brow; I was impatient to repose,
  and faint with hunger, as I had eaten nothing since I got up."</p>

  <p>But, according to his account before the Convention, the elixir made him
  throw up "all he had eaten and drunk during the day."</p>

  <p class="quote">"I seated myself a moment in the King's chamber, and he
  asked me to count for him two thousand double louis and tie them up in four
  leather bags. Whilst so doing I observed that Durey was carrying some bundles
  of papers which I conjectured were destined for the secret closet; and,
  indeed, the money-counting was designed to distract my attention from what
  Durey was about."</p>

  <p>What a clumsy story! Why were not the papers hidden after Gamain was gone?
  Was it necessary that this should be done in his presence, and he set to
  count money, so as not to observe what was going on?</p>

  <p class="quote">"As I was about to leave, the Queen suddenly entered by a
  masked door at the foot of the King's bed, holding in her hands a plate, in
  which was a cake (brioche) and a glass of wine. She came up to me, and I
  saluted her with surprise, because the King had assured me that she knew
  nothing about the fabrication of the chest. 'My dear Gamain,' said she in a
  caressing tone, 'how hot you are! Drink this tumbler of wine and eat this
  cake, and they will sustain you on your journey home.' I thanked her,
  confounded by this consideration for a poor workman, and I emptied the
  tumbler to her health. I put the cake in my pocket, intending to take it home
  to my children."</p>

  <p>Here again is a discrepancy. In his petition Gamain says that the King
  gave him a glass of wine, and makes no mention of the Queen.</p>

  <p>On leaving the Tuileries, Gamain set out on foot for Versailles, but was
  attacked by a violent colic in the Champs Elysées. His agonies increased; he
  was no longer able to walk; he fell, and rolled on the ground, uttering cries
  and moans. A carriage that was passing stopped, and an English gentleman got
  out&mdash;wonderful to relate!&mdash;extraordinary coincidence!&mdash;a
  physician, and an acquaintance.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Englishman took me to his carriage, and ordered the
  coachman to drive at full gallop to an apothecary's shop. The conveyance
  halted at last before one in the Rue de Bac; the Englishman left me alone,
  whilst he prepared an elixir which might counteract the withering power of
  the poison. When I had swallowed this draught I ejected the venomous
  substances. An hour later nothing could have saved me. I recovered in part my
  sight and hearing; the cold that circulated in my veins was dissipated by
  degrees, and the Englishman judged that I might be safely removed to
  Versailles, which we reached at two o'clock in the morning. A physician, M.
  de Lameyran, and a surgeon, M. Voisin, were called in; they recognised the
  unequivocal tokens of poison.</p>

  <p class="quote">"After three days of fever, delirium, and inconceivable
  suffering, I triumphed over the poison, but suffered ever after from a
  paralysis almost complete, and a general inflammation of the digestive
  organs.</p>

  <p class="quote">"A few days after this catastrophe the servant maid, whilst
  cleaning my coat, which I had worn on the occasion of my accident, found my
  handkerchief, stained black, and the cake. She took a bite of the latter, and
  threw the rest into the yard, where a dog ate it and died. The girl, who had
  consumed only a morsel of the cake, fell dangerously ill. The dog was opened
  by M. Voisin, and a chemical analysis disclosed the presence of poison, both
  on my kerchief stained by my vomit, and in the cake. The cake alone contained
  enough corrosive sublimate to kill ten persons."</p><br>

  <p>So&mdash;the poison was found. But how is it that in Gamain's petition
  none of this occurs? According to that document, Gamain was offered a goblet
  of wine by the King himself. "A few hours later he was attacked by a violent
  colic. This was the prelude to a terrible illness." Only a vague hint as to
  poison, no specific statement that he had been poisoned, and that the kind of
  poison had been determined.</p>

  <p>Now, corrosive sublimate, when put in red wine, forms a violet
  precipitate, and alters the taste of the wine, giving it a characteristic
  metallic, harsh flavour, so disagreeable that it insures its immediate
  rejection. Gamain tasted nothing. Again, the action of corrosive sublimate is
  immediate or very nearly so; but Gamain was not affected till several hours
  after having drunk the wine.</p>

  <p>According to the petition, Gamain asserted that he was paralysed in all
  his limbs for fourteen months, from May 22, 1792; but the Communal registers
  of Versailles show that he attended a session of the Council and took part in
  the discussion on June 4 following, that is, less than a fortnight after;
  that he was present at the sessions of June 8, 17, 20, and on August 22, and
  that he was sufficiently hearty and active to be elected on the commission
  which was to obliterate the insignia of monarchy on September 24 following,
  which certainly would not have been the case had he been a sick man paralysed
  in all his members.</p>

  <p>Why, we may further inquire, did not Louis the XVI. or Queen Marie
  Antoinette attempt to poison Durey also, if they desired to make away with
  all those who knew the secret of the iron locker?</p>

  <p>Now, Durey was alive in 1800, and Eckard, who wrote the article on Gamain
  in the "Biographie Universelle," knew him and saw him at that date, and Durey
  told him that Gamain's story was a lie; the iron safe was made, not in 1792,
  but in May, 1791; and this is probable, as it would have been easier for the
  King to have the locker made before his escape to Varennes, than in 1792,
  when he was under the closest supervision.</p>

  <p>According to the version attributed to Gamain by M. Paul Lacroix, Gamain
  was paralysed for five months only. Why this change? Because either M.
  Lacroix or the locksmith had discovered that it was an anachronism for him to
  appear in November before Roland, and assist him in opening the case which he
  had made in May&mdash;five months before, and afterwards to declare that he
  was paralysed in all his members from May till the year following. We think
  this correction is due to the Bibliophile. But he was not acquainted with the
  Versailles archives proving him to have been at a session a few days after
  the pretended poisoning.</p>

  <p>There is not much difficulty in discovering Gamain's motive for
  formulating the accusation against the King. He betrayed his king, who
  trusted him, and then, to excuse his meanness, invented an odious calumny
  against him.</p>

  <p>But what was M. Lacroix's object in revivifying the base charge? We are
  not sure that he comes cleaner out of the slough than the despicable
  locksmith. He gave the story a new spell of life; he based his "facts" on
  testimonies, who, he said, were ready at any moment to vouch for the truth.
  When challenged to produce them he would not do so. His "facts" were proved
  again and again to be fables, and yet he dared to republish his slanderous
  story again and again, without a word of apology, explanation, or
  retractation. M. Lacroix died only a year or two ago, and it may seem
  ungenerous to attack a dead man, but one is forced to do this in defence of
  the honour of a dead Queen whom he grossly calumniated. The calumny was
  ingeniously put. M. Lacroix set it in the mouth of Gamain, thinking thereby
  to free himself from responsibility, but the responsibility sticks when he
  refuses to withdraw what has been demonstrated to be false.</p>

  <p>There is something offensive to the last degree in the pose of M. Lacroix
  as he opens his charge.</p>

  <p class="quote">"For some years I have kept by me, with a sort of terror,
  the materials for an historic revelation, without venturing to use them, and
  yet the fact, now almost unknown, on which I purpose casting a sinister
  light, is one that has been the object of my most active preoccupations. For
  long I condemned myself to silence and to fresh research, hitherto fruitless,
  hoping that the truth would come to light.... Well! now, at the moment of
  lifting the veil which covers a half-effaced page of history, with the
  documents I have consulted and the evidence I have gleaned lying before me,
  surrounded by a crowd of witnesses, one sustaining the testimony of the
  other, relying on my conscience and on my sentiments as a man of
  honour&mdash;still I hesitate to open my mouth and call up the remembrance of
  an event monstrous in itself, that has not found an echo even in the writings
  of the blindest partisans of a hideous epoch. Yes, I feel a certain
  repugnance in seeming to associate in thought, though not in act, with the
  enemies of Louis XVI. I have just re-read the sublime death of this unhappy
  political martyr; I have felt my eyes moisten with tears at the contemplation
  of the picture of the death inflicted by an inexorable state necessity, and I
  felt I must break my pen lest I should mix my ink with the yet warm blood of
  the innocent victim. Let my hand wither rather than rob Louis XVI. of the
  mantle of probity and goodness, which the outrages of '93 succeeded neither
  in staining nor in rending to rags."</p>

  <p>And so on&mdash;M. Lacroix is only acting under a high sense of the sacred
  duty of seeking the truth, "of forcing the disclosure of facts, before it be
  too late," which may establish the innocence of Louis XVI. Now, be it noted
  that M. Lacroix is the first to accuse the Queen of attempting the murder;
  his assault is on her as much as, more than, on the poor King&mdash;in the
  sacred interests of historic truth!</p>

  <p>What are his evidences, his crowd of witnesses, his documents that he has
  collected? What proof is there of his active preoccupations and fresh
  researches? He produced nothing that can be called proof, and refused the
  names of his witnesses when asked for them. We can quite understand that the
  Bibliophile Jacob may have heard some gossiping story such as he narrates,
  and may have believed it when he wrote the story; but then, where are the
  high sense of honour, the tender conscience, the enthusiasm for truth, when
  his story is proved to be a tissue of improbabilities and impossibilities,
  that permit him to republish, and again republish at intervals of years, this
  cruel and calumnious fabrication?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. ABRAM THE USURER.[9]</h2>

  <p class="footnote">[9] This account is taken from a sermon preached in the
  Church of St. Sophia at Constantinople on Orthodoxy Sunday, printed by
  Combefisius (Auctuarium novum, pars post. col. 644), from a MS. in the
  National Library at Paris. Another copy of the sermon is in the Library at
  Turin. The probable date of the composition is the tenth century. Orthodoxy
  Sunday was not instituted till 842.</p>

  <p class="first">IN the reign of Heraclius, when Sergius was patriarch of
  Constantinople, there lived in Byzantium a merchant named Theodore, a good
  man and just, fearing God, and serving him with all his heart. He went on a
  voyage to the ports of Syria and Palestine with his wares, in a large
  well-laden vessel, sold his goods to profit, and turned his ship's head
  homewards with a good lading of silks and spices, the former some of the
  produce of the looms of distant China, brought in caravans through Persia and
  Syria to the emporiums on the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>It was late in the year when Theodore began his voyage home, the
  equinoctial gales had begun to blow, and prudence would have suggested that
  he should winter in Cyprus; but he was eager to return to Byzantium to his
  beloved wife, and to prepare for another adventure in the ensuing spring.</p>

  <p>But he was overtaken by a storm as he was sailing up the Propontis, and to
  save the vessel he was obliged to throw all the lading overboard. He reached
  Constantinople in safety, but with the loss of his goods. His grief and
  despair were excessive. His wife was unable to console him. He declared that
  he was weary of the world, his loss was sent him as a warning from heaven not
  to set his heart on Mammon, and that he was resolved to enter a monastery,
  and spend the rest of his days in devotion.</p>

  <p>"Hasten, husband mine," said the wife, "put this scheme into execution at
  once; for if you delay you may change your mind."</p>

  <p>The manifest impatience of his wife to get rid of him somewhat cooled the
  ardour of Theodore for the monastic profession, and before taking the
  irrevocable step, he consulted a friend. "I think, dearest brother, nay, I am
  certain, that this misfortune came on me as the indication of the finger of
  Providence that I should give up merchandise and care only for the saving of
  my soul."</p>

  <p>"My friend," answered the other, "I do not see this in the same light as
  you. Every merchant must expect loss. It is one of the ordinary risks of
  sailors. It is absurd to despair. Go to your friends and borrow of them
  sufficient to load your vessel again, and try your luck once more. You are
  known as a merchant, and trusted as an honest man, and will have no
  difficulty in raising the sum requisite."</p>

  <p>Theodore rushed home, and announced to his wife that he had already
  changed his mind, and that he was going to borrow money.</p>

  <p>"Whatever pleases you is right in my eyes," said the lady.</p>

  <p>Theodore then went the round of his acquaintances, told them of his
  misfortune, and then asked them to lend him enough to restock his vessel,
  promising to pay them a good percentage on the money lent. But the autumn had
  been fatal to more vessels than that of Theodore, and he found that no one
  was disposed to advance him the large sum he required. He went from door to
  door, but a cold refusal met him everywhere. Disappointed, and sick at heart,
  distressed at finding friends so unfriendly, he returned home, and said to
  his wife, "Woman! the world is hard and heartless, I will have nothing more
  to do with it. I will become a monk."</p>

  <p>"Dearest husband, do so by all means, and I shall be well pleased,"
  answered the wife.</p>

  <p>Theodore tossed on his bed all night, unable to sleep; before dawn an idea
  struck him. There was a Jew named Abram who had often importuned him to trade
  with his money, but whom he had invariably refused. He would try this man as
  a last resource.</p>

  <p>So when morning came, Theodore rose and went to the shop of Abram. The
  Hebrew listened attentively to his story, and then said, smiling, "Master
  Theodore, when thou wast rich, I often asked thee to take my money and trade
  with it in foreign parts, so that I might turn it over with advantage. But I
  always met with refusal. And now that thou art poor, with only an empty ship,
  thou comest to me to ask for a loan. What if again tempest should fall on
  thee, and wreck and ruin be thy lot, where should I look for my money? Thou
  art poor. If I were to sell thy house it would not fetch much. Nay, if I am
  to lend thee money thou must provide a surety, to whom I may apply, and who
  will repay me, should accident befall thee. Go, find security, and I will
  find the money."</p>

  <p>So Theodore went to his best friend, and told him the circumstances, and
  asked him to stand surety for him to the Jew.</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," answered he, "I should be most happy to oblige you; but I
  am a poor man, I have not as much money in the world as would suffice. The
  Hebrew would not accept me as surety, he knows the state of my affairs too
  well. But I will do for you what little I can. We will go together to some
  merchants, and together beseech them to stand security for you to the
  Jew."</p>

  <p>So the two friends went to a rich merchant with whom they were acquainted,
  and told him what they wanted; but he blustered and turned red, and said,
  "Away with you, fellows; who ever heard of such insolence as that two needy
  beggars should ask a man of substance like me to go with them to the den of a
  cursed infidel Jew. God be thanked! I have no dealings with Jews. I never
  have spoken to one in my life, and never give them a greeting when I pass any
  in street or market-place. A man who goes to the Jews to-day, goes to the
  dogs to-morrow, and to the devil the day after."</p>

  <p>The friends visited other merchants, but with like ill-success. Theodore
  had spent the day fasting, and he went supperless to bed, very hopeless, and
  with the prospect growing more distinct of being obliged to put on the cowl
  of the monk, a prospect which somehow or other he did not relish.</p>

  <p>Next morning he started from home to tell Abram his failure. His way was
  through the great square called the Copper-Market before the Imperial palace.
  Now there stood there a porch consisting of four pillars, which supported a
  dome covered with brazen tiles, the whole surmounted by a cross, on the east
  side of which, looking down on the square, and across over the sparkling
  Bosphorus to the hills of Asia, was a large, solemn figure of the Crucified.
  This porch and cross had been set up by Constantine the Great,[10] and had
  been restored by Anastasius.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[10] This famous figure was cast down and broken by Leo
  the Isaurian in 730, a riot ensued, the market-women interfering with the
  soldiers, who were engaged on pulling down the figure, they shook the ladders
  and threw down one who was engaged in hacking the face of the figure. This
  led to the execution of ten persons, among them Gregory, head of the
  bodyguard, and Mary, a lady of the Imperial family. The Empress Irene set up
  a mosaic figure in its place. This was again destroyed by Leo the Armenian,
  and again restored after his death by Theophilus in 829.</p>

  <p>As Theodore sped through the Copper-Market in the morning, he looked up;
  the sky was of the deepest gentian blue. Against it, glittering like gold in
  the early sun, above the blazing, brazen tiles, stood the great cross with
  the holy form thereon. Theodore halted, in his desolation, doubt and despair,
  and looked up at the figure. It was in the old, grave Byzantine style, very
  solemn, without the pain expressed in Mediæval crucifixes, and like so many
  early figures of the sort was probably vested and crowned.</p>

  <p>A sudden inspiration took hold of the ruined man. He fell on his knees,
  stretched his hands towards the shining form, and cried, "Lord Jesus Christ!
  the hope of the whole earth, the only succour of all who are cast down, the
  sure confidence of those that look to Thee! All on whom I could lean have
  failed me. I have none on earth on whom I can call. Do Thou, Lord, be surety
  for me, though I am unworthy to ask it." Then filled with confidence he rose
  from his knees, and ran to the house of Abram, and bursting in on him said,
  "Be of good cheer, I have found a Surety very great and noble and mighty.
  Trust thy money, He will keep it safe."</p>

  <p>Abram answered, "Let the man come, and sign the deed and see the money
  paid over."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my brother," said Theodore; "come thou with me. I have hurried in
  thus to bring thee to him."</p>

  <p>Then Abram went with Theodore, who led him to the Copper-Market, and bade
  him be seated, and then raising his finger, he pointed to the sacred form
  hanging on the cross, and, full of confidence, said to the Hebrew, "There,
  friend, thou could'st not have a better security than the Lord of heaven and
  earth. I have besought Him to stand for me, and I know He is so good that He
  will not deny me."</p>

  <p>The Jew was perplexed. He said nothing for a moment or two, and then,
  wondering at the man's faith, answered, "Friend, dost thou not know the
  difference between the faith of a Christian and of a Hebrew? How can'st thou
  ask me to accept as thy surety, One whom thou believest my people to have
  rejected and crucified? However, I will trust thee, for thou art a
  God-fearing and an honest man, and I will risk my money."</p>

  <p>So they twain returned to the Jew's quarters, and Abram counted out fifty
  pounds of gold, in our money about £2,400. He tied the money up in bags, and
  bade his servants bear it after Theodore. And Abram and the glad merchant
  came to the Copper-Market, and then the Jew ordered that the money bags
  should be set down under the Tetrastyle where was the great crucifix. Then
  said the Hebrew usurer, "See, Theodore, I make over to thee the loan here
  before thy God." And there, in the face of the great image of his Saviour,
  Theodore received the loan, and swore to deal faithfully by the Jew, and to
  restore the money to him with usury.</p>

  <p>After this, the merchant bought a cargo for his vessel, and hired sailors,
  and set sail for Syria. He put into port at Tyre and Sidon, and traded with
  his goods, and bought in place of them many rich Oriental stuffs, with spices
  and gums, and when his ship was well laden, he sailed for Constantinople.</p>

  <p>But again misfortune befell him. A storm arose, and the sailors were
  constrained to throw the bales of silk, and bags of costly gums, and vessels
  of Oriental chasing into the greedy waves. But as the ship began to fill,
  they were obliged to get into the boat and escape to land. The ship keeled
  over and drifted into shallow water. When the storm abated they got to her,
  succeeded in floating her, and made the best of their way in the battered
  ship to Constantinople, thankful that they had preserved their lives. But
  Theodore was in sad distress, chiefly because he had lost Abram's money. "How
  shall I dare to face the man who dealt so generously by me?" he said to
  himself. "What shall I say, when he reproaches me? What answer can I make to
  my Surety for having lost the money entrusted to me?"</p>

  <p>Now when Abram heard that Theodore had arrived in Constantinople in his
  wrecked vessel with the loss of all his cargo, he went to him at once, and
  found the man prostrate in his chamber, the pavement wet with his tears of
  shame and disappointment. Abram laid his hand gently on his shoulder, and
  said, in a kind voice, "Rise, my brother, do not be downcast; give glory to
  God who rules all things as He wills, and follow me home. God will order all
  for the best."</p>

  <p>Then the merchant rose, and followed the Jew, but he would not lift his
  eyes from the ground, for he was ashamed to look him in the face. Abram was
  troubled at the distress of his friend, and he said to him, as he shut the
  door of his house, "Let not thy heart be broken with overmuch grief, dearest
  friend, for it is the mark of a wise man to bear all things with firm mind.
  See! I am ready again to lend thee fifty pounds of gold, and may better
  fortune attend thee this time. I trust that our God will bless the money and
  multiply it, so that in the end we shall lose nothing by our former
  misadventure."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Theodore, "Christ shall again stand security for me. Bring
  the money to the Tetrastyle."</p>

  <p>Therefore again the bags of gold were brought before the cross, and when
  they had then been made over to the merchant, Abram said, "Accept, Master
  Theodore, this sum of fifty pounds of gold, paid over to thee before thy
  Surety, and go in peace. And may the Lord God prosper thee on thy journey,
  and make plain the way before thee. And remember, that before this thy Surety
  thou art bound to me for a hundred pounds of gold."</p>

  <p>Having thus spoken, Abram returned home. Theodore repaired and reloaded
  his ship, engaged mariners and made ready to sail. But on the day that he was
  about to depart, he went into the Copper-Market, and kneeling down, with his
  face towards the cross, he prayed the Lord to be his companion and captain,
  and to guide him on his journey, and bring him safe through all perils with
  his goods back to Byzantium once more.</p>

  <p>Then he went on to the house of Abram to bid him farewell. And the Jew
  said to him, "Keep thyself safe, brother, and beware now of trusting thy ship
  to the sea at the time of equinoctial gales. Thou hast twice experienced the
  risk, run not into it again. Winter at the place whither thou goest, and that
  I may know how thou farest, if thou hast the opportunity, send me some of the
  money by a sure hand. Then there is less chance of total ruin, for if one
  portion fails, the other is likely to be secure."</p>

  <p>Theodore approved of this advice, and promised to follow it; so then the
  Jew and the Christian parted with much affection and mutual respect, for each
  knew the other to be a good and true man, fearing God, and seeking to do that
  which is right. This time Theodore turned his ship's head towards the West,
  intending to carry his wares to the markets of Spain. He passed safely
  through the Straits of Hercules, and sailed North. Then a succession of
  steady strong breezes blew from the South and swept him on so that he could
  not get into harbour till he reached Britain. He anchored in a bay on the
  rugged Cornish coast, in the very emporium of tin and lead, in the
  Cassiterides famed of old for supplying ore precious in the manufacture of
  bronze. He readily disposed of all his merchandise, and bought as much tin
  and lead as his ship would hold. His goods had sold so well, and tin and lead
  were so cheap that he found he had fifty pounds in gold in addition to the
  cargo.</p>

  <p>The voyage back from Britain to Byzantium was long and dangerous, and
  Theodore was uneasy. He found no other ships from Constantinople where he
  was, and no means presented themselves for sending back the money in part, as
  he had promised. He was a conscientious man, and he wished to keep his
  word.</p>

  <p>He set sail from Cornwall before the summer was over, passed safely
  through the straits into the Mediterranean, but saw no chance of reaching
  Constantinople before winter. He would not again risk his vessel in the gales
  of the equinox, and he resolved to winter in Sicily. He arrived too late in
  the year to be able to send a message and the money to Abram. His promise
  troubled him, and he cast about in his mind how to keep his word.</p>

  <p>At last, in the simple faith which coloured the whole life of the man, he
  made a very solid wooden box and tarred it well internally and externally.
  Then he inclosed in it the fifty pounds of gold he had made by his goods in
  Britain over and above his lading of lead and tin, and with the money he put
  a letter, couched in these terms:</p>

  <p>"In the name of my heir and God, my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who is
  also my Surety for a large sum of money, I, Theodore, humbly address my
  master Abram, who, with God, is my benefactor and creditor.</p>

  <p>"I would have thee know, Master Abram, that we all, by the mercy of God,
  are in good health. God has verily prospered us well and brought our
  merchandise to a good market. And now, see! I send thee fifty pounds of gold,
  which I commit to the care of my Surety, and He will convey the money safely
  to thy hands. Receive it from me and do not forget us. Farewell."</p>

  <p>Then he fastened up the box, and raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed to
  God, saying: "O Lord Jesus Christ, Mediator between God and Man, Who dwellest
  in Heaven, but hast respect unto the lowly; hear the voice of thy servant
  this day; because Thou hast proved Thyself to me a good and kind Surety, I
  trust to Thee to return to my benefactor and creditor, Abram, the money I
  promised to send him. Trusting in Thee, Lord, I commit this little box to the
  sea!"</p>

  <p>So saying he flung the case containing the gold and the letter into the
  waves; and standing on a cliff watched it floating on the waters, rising and
  falling on the glittering wavelets, gradually drifting further and further
  out to sea, till it was lost to his sight, and then, nothing doubting but
  that the Lord Christ would look after the little box and guide it over the
  waste of waters to its proper destination, he went back to his lodging, and
  told the ship pilot what he had done. The sailor remained silent wondering in
  his mind at the great faith of his master. Then his rough heart softened, and
  he knelt down and blessed and praised God.</p>

  <p>That night Theodore had a dream, and in the morning he told it to the
  pilot.</p>

  <p>"I thought," said he, "that I was back in Byzantium, and standing in the
  Copper-Market before the great cross with Christ on it. And I fancied in my
  dream that Abram was at my side. And I looked, and saw him hold up his hands,
  and receive the box in them, and the great figure of Christ said, 'See,
  Abram, I give thee what Theodore committed to my trust.' And, thereupon, I
  awoke trembling. So now I am quite satisfied that the gold is in safe
  keeping, and will infallibly reach its destination."</p>

  <p>The summer passed, the storms of autumn had swept over the grey sea, and
  torn away from the trees the last russet leaves; winter had set in; yet Abram
  had received no news of Theodore.</p>

  <p>He did not doubt the good faith of his friend, but he began to fear that
  ill-luck attended him. He had risked a large sum, and would feel the loss
  severely should this cargo be lost like the former one. He talked the matter
  over with his steward, and considered it from every imaginable point of view.
  His anxiety took him constantly to the shore to watch the ships that arrived,
  hoping to hear news by some of them, and to recover part of his money. He
  hardly expected the return of Theodore after the injunctions he had given him
  not to risk his vessel in a stormy season.</p>

  <p>One day he was walking with his steward by the sea-side, when the waves
  were more boisterous than usual. Not a ship was visible. All were in winter
  quarters. Abram drew off his sandals, and began to wash his feet in the sea
  water. Whilst so doing he observed something floating at a little distance.
  With the assistance of his steward he fished out a box black with tar, firmly
  fastened up, like a solid cube of wood. Moved by curiosity he carried the box
  home, and succeeded with a little difficulty in forcing it open. Inside he
  found a letter, not directed, but marked with three crosses, and a bag of
  gold. It need hardly be said that this was the box Theodore had entrusted to
  Christ, and his Surety had fulfilled His trust and conveyed it to the hands
  of the creditor.</p>

  <p>Next spring Theodore returned to Constantinople in safety. As soon as he
  had disembarked, he hastened to the house of Abram to tell him the results of
  his voyage.</p>

  <p>The Jewish usurer, wishing to prove him, feigned not to understand, when
  Theodore related how he had sent him fifty pounds of gold, and made as though
  he had not received the money. But the merchant was full of confidence, and
  he said, "I cannot understand this, brother, for I enclosed the money in a
  box along with a letter, and committed it to the custody of my Saviour
  Christ, Who has acted as Surety for me unworthy. But as thou sayest that thou
  hast not received it, come with me, and let us go together before the
  crucifix, and say before it that thou hast not had the money conveyed to
  thee, and then I will believe thy word."</p>

  <p>Abram promised to accompany his friend, and rising from their seats, they
  went together to the Copper-Market. And when they came to the Tetrastyle,
  Theodore raised his hands to the Crucified, and said, "My Saviour and Surety,
  didst Thou not restore the gold to Abram that I entrusted to Thee for that
  purpose?"</p>

  <p>There was something so wonderful, so beautiful, in the man's faith, that
  Abram was overpowered; and withal there was the evidence that it was not
  misplaced so clear to the Jew, that the light of conviction like a dazzling
  sunbeam darted into his soul, and Theodore saw the Hebrew usurer fall
  prostrate on the pavement, half fainting with the emotion which oppressed
  him.</p>

  <p>Theodore ran and fetched water in his hands and sprinkled his face, and
  brought the usurer round. And Abram said, "As God liveth, my friend, I will
  not enter into my house till I have taken thy Lord and Surety for my Master."
  A crowd began to gather, and it was bruited abroad that the Jewish usurer
  sought baptism. And when the story reached the ears of the Emperor Heraclius,
  he glorified God. So Abram was put under instruction, and was baptised by the
  patriarch Sergius.[11]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[11] Sergius was patriarch of Constantinople between 610
  and 638. He embraced the Monothelite heresy.</p>

  <p>And after seven days a solemn procession was instituted through the
  streets of Constantinople to the Copper-Market, in which walked the emperor
  and the patriarch, and all the clergy of the city; and the box which had
  contained the money was conveyed by them to the Tetrastyle and laid up, along
  with the gold and the letter before the image, to be a memorial of what had
  taken place to all generations. And thenceforth the crucifix received the
  common appellation of Antiphonetos, or the Surety.</p>

  <p>As for the tin and lead with which the vessel of Theodore was freighted,
  it sold for a great price, so that both he and Abram realised a large sum by
  the transaction. But neither would keep to himself any portion of it, but
  gave it all to the Church of S. Sophia, and therewith a part of the sanctuary
  was overlaid with silver. Then Theodore and his wife, with mutual consent,
  gave up the world and retired into monastic institutions.</p>

  <p>Abram afterwards built and endowed an oratory near the Tetrastyle, and
  Sergius ordained him priest and his two sons deacons.</p>

  <p>Thus ends this strange and very beautiful story, which I have merely
  condensed from the somewhat prolix narrative of the Byzantine preacher. The
  reader will probably agree with me that if sermons in the 19th century were
  as entertaining as this of the 10th, fewer people would be found to go to
  sleep during their delivery.</p>

  <p>I have told the tale as related by the preacher. But there are reasons
  which awaken suspicion that he somewhat erred as to his dates; but that,
  nevertheless the story is really not without a foundation of fact. Towards
  the close of the oration the preacher points to the ambone, and the
  thusiasterion, and bids his hearers remark how they are overlaid with silver,
  and this he says was the silver that Abram, the wealthy Jewish usurer, and
  Theodore, the merchant, gave to the Church of S. Sophia.</p>

  <p>Now it happens that we have got a contemporary record of this overlaying
  of the sanctuary with silver; we know from the pen of Procopius of Gaza that
  it took place in the reign of Justinian in A.D. 537.[12]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[12] Fabricius, Bibl. Græca, Ed. Harles, T.X. p. 124,
  125.</p>

  <p>This was preparatory to the dedication of the great Church, when the
  Emperor and the wealthy citizens of Byzantium were lavishly contributing to
  the adornment of the glorious building.</p>

  <p>We can quite understand how that the new convert and the grateful merchant
  were carried away by the current of the general enthusiasm, and gave all
  their silver to the plating of the sanctuary of the new Church. Procopius
  tells us that forty thousand pounds of silver were spent in this work. Not
  all of this, however, could have been given by Abram and Theodore.</p>

  <p>If this then were the date of the conversion of Abram, for Heraclius we
  must read Justinian, and for Sergius we must substitute Mennas. As the sermon
  was not preached till four hundred years after, the error can be accounted
  for, one imperial benefactor of the Church was mistaken for another.</p>

  <p>Now about the time of Justinian, we know from other sources that there was
  a converted Jew named Abram who founded and built a church and monastery in
  Constantinople, and which in after times was known as the Abramite Monastery.
  We are told this by John Moschus. We can not fix the exact date of the
  foundation, Moschus heard about A.D. 600 from the abbot John Rutilus, who had
  heard it from Stephen the Moabite, that the Monastery of the Abramites had
  been constructed by Abram who afterwards was raised to the metropolitan See
  of Ephesus. We may put then the foundation of the monastery at about A.D.
  540.</p>

  <p>Now Abram of Ephesus succeeded Procopius who was bishop in 560; and his
  successor was Rufinus in 597. The date of the elevation of Abram to the
  metropolitan throne of Ephesus is not known exactly, but it was probably
  about 565.</p>

  <p>There is, of course, much conjecture in thus identifying the usurer Abram
  with Abram, Bishop of Ephesus; but there is certainly a probability that they
  were identical; and if so, then one more pretty story of the good man
  survives. After having built the monastery in Constantinople, Moschus tells
  us that Abram went to Jerusalem, the home to which a Jewish heart naturally
  turns, and there he set to work to erect another monastery. Now there was
  among the workmen engaged on the building a mason who ate but sparingly,
  conversed with none, but worked diligently, and prayed much in his hours of
  relaxation from labour.</p>

  <p>Abram became interested in the man, and called him to him, and learned
  from him his story. It was this. The mason had been a monk in the Theodorian
  Monastery along with his brother. The brother weary of the life, had left and
  fallen into grave moral disorders. Then this one now acting as mason had gone
  after him, laid aside his cowl and undertaken the same daily toil as the
  erring brother, that he might be with him, waiting his time when by means of
  advice or example he might draw the young man from his life of sin. But
  though he had laid aside the outward emblems of his monastic profession, he
  kept the rule of life as closely as he was able, cultivating prayer and
  silence and fasting. Then Abram deeply moved, said to the monk-mason: "God
  will look on thy fraternal charity; be of good courage, He will give thee thy
  brother at thy petition."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; SOPHIE APITZSCH</h2>

  <p class="first">"SOME are born great," said Malvolio, strutting in yellow
  stockings, cross-gartered, before Olivia, "some achieve greatness," and with
  a smile, "some have greatness thrust upon them."</p>

  <p>Of the latter was Sophie Sabine Apitzsch. She was not born great, she was
  the daughter of an armourer. She hardly can be said to have achieved
  greatness, though she did attain to notoriety; what greatness she had was
  thrust on her, not altogether reluctant to receive it. But the greatness was
  not much, and was of an ambiguous description. She was treated for a while as
  a prince in disguise, and then became the theme of an opera, of a drama, and
  of a novel. For a hundred years her top-boots were preserved as historical
  relics in the archives of the House of Saxony, till in 1813 a Cossack of the
  Russian army passing through Augustenburg, saw, desired, tried on, and
  marched off with them; and her boots entered Paris with the Allies.</p>

  <p>About five-and-twenty miles from Dresden lived in 1714 a couple of landed
  proprietors, the one called Volkmar, and the other von Günther, who fumed
  with fiery hostility against each other, and the cause of disagreement was,
  that the latter wrote himself von Günther. Now, to get a <i>von</i> before
  the name makes a great deal of difference: it purifies, nay, it alters the
  colour of the blood, turning it from red to blue. No one in Germany can
  prefix <i>von</i> to his name as any one in England can append Esq. to his.
  He must receive authorisation by diploma of nobility from his sovereign.</p>

  <p>George von Günther had been, not long before, plain George Günther, but in
  1712 he had obtained from the Emperor Charles VI. a patent of nobility, or
  gentility, they are the same abroad, and the motive that moved his sacred
  apostolic majesty to grant the patent was&mdash;as set forth
  therein&mdash;that an ancestor of George Günther of the same name "had sat
  down to table with the elector John George II. of Saxony;" and it was
  inconceivable that a mere citizen could have been suffered to do this, unless
  there were some nobility in him. George von Günther possessed an estate which
  was a manor, a knight's fee, at Jägerhof, and he was moreover upper Forester
  and Master of the Fisheries to the King-elector of Saxony, and Sheriff of
  Chemnitz and Frankenberg. He managed to marry his daughters to men blessed
  with <i>von</i> before their names, one to von Bretschneider, Privy-
  Councillor of War, the other to a Major von Wöllner.</p>

  <p>Now, all this was gall and wormwood to Councillor-of-Agriculture, Daniel
  Volkmar, who lived on his paternal acres at Hetzdorf, of which he was
  hereditary chief magistrate by virtue of his lordship of the acres. This man
  had made vain efforts to be ennobled. He could not find that any ancestor of
  his had sat at table with an elector; and, perhaps, he could not scrape
  together sufficient money to induce his sacred apostolic majesty to overlook
  this defect. As he could not get his diploma, he sought how he might injure
  his more fortunate neighbour, and this he did by spying out his acts,
  watching for neglect of his duties to the fishes or the game, and reporting
  him anonymously to head-quarters. Günther knew well enough who it was that
  sought to injure him, and, as Volkmar believed, had invited some of the
  gamekeepers to shoot him; accordingly, Volkmar never rode or walked in the
  neighbourhood of the royal forests and fish-ponds unarmed, and without
  servants carrying loaded muskets.</p>

  <p>One day a brother magistrate, Pöckel by name, came over to see him about a
  matter that puzzled him. There had appeared in the district under his
  jurisdiction a young man, tall, well-built, handsome, but slightly
  small-pox-pitted, who had been arrested by the police for blowing a
  hunting-horn. Now ignoble lips might not touch a hunting-horn, and for any
  other than breath that issued out of noble lungs to sound a note on such a
  horn was against the laws.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Volkmar, "if he has done this, and is not a
  gentleman&mdash;lock him up. What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"He calls himself Karl Marbitz."</p>

  <p>"But I, even I, may not blow a blast on a horn&mdash;that scoundrel
  Günther may. Deal with the fellow Marbitz with the utmost severity."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;suppose he may have the necessary qualification?"</p>

  <p>"How can he without a von before his name?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose he be a nobleman, or something even higher, in disguise?"</p>

  <p>"What, in disguise? Travelling incognito? Our Crown Prince is not at
  Dresden."[13]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[13] Augustus the Strong was King of Poland and Elector
  of Saxony.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. All kinds of rumours are afloat concerning this young man, who
  is, indeed, about the Crown Prince's age; he has been lodging with a baker at
  Aue, and there blowing the horn."</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you and see him. I will stand bail for him. Let him come to
  me. Hah-hah! George von Günther, hah-hah!"</p>

  <p>So Volkmar, already more than half disposed to believe that the
  horn-blower was a prince in disguise, rode over to the place where he was in
  confinement, saw him, and lost what little doubt he had. The upright
  carriage, the aristocratic cast of features, the stand-off manners, all
  betokened the purest of blue blood&mdash;all were glimmerings of that halo
  which surrounds sovereignty.</p>

  <p>The Crown Prince of Saxony was away&mdash;it was alleged, in
  France&mdash;making the grand tour, but, was it not more likely that he was
  going the round of the duchy of Saxony, inquiring into the wants and wrongs
  of the people? If so, who could better assist him to the knowledge of these
  things, than he, Volkmar, and who could better open his eyes to the
  delinquencies of high-placed, high-salaried officials&mdash;notably of the
  fisheries and forests?</p>

  <p>"There is one thing shakes my faith," said Pöckel: "our Crown Prince is
  not small-pox marked."</p>

  <p>"That is nothing," answered Volkmar eagerly. "His Serenity has caught the
  infection in making his studies among the people."</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;he is so shabbily dressed."</p>

  <p>"That is nothing&mdash;it is the perfection of disguise."</p>

  <p>Volkmar carried off the young man to his house, and showed him the
  greatest respect, insisted on his sitting in the carriage facing the horses,
  and would on no account take a place at his side, but seated himself
  deferentially opposite him.</p>

  <p>On reaching Hetzdorf, Volkmar introduced his wife and his daughter Joanna
  to the distinguished prince, who behaved to them very graciously, and with
  the most courtly air expressed himself charmed with the room prepared for
  him.</p>

  <p>Dinner was served, and politics were discussed; the reserve with which the
  guest treated such subjects, the caution with which he expressed an opinion,
  served to deepen in Volkmar's mind the conviction that he had caught the
  Crown Prince travelling incog. After the servants had withdrawn, and when a
  good deal of wine&mdash;the best in the cellar&mdash;had been drunk, the host
  said confidentially in a whisper, "I see clearly enough what you are."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," answered the guest, "I can tell you what I am&mdash;by trade an
  armourer."</p>

  <p>"Ah, ha! but by birth&mdash;what?" said Volkmar, slyly, holding up his
  glass and winking over it.</p>

  <p>"Well," answered the guest, "I will admit this&mdash;I am not what I
  appear."</p>

  <p>"And may I further ask your&mdash;I mean you&mdash;where you are at
  home?"</p>

  <p>"I am a child of Saxony," was the answer.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, at the trial, the defendant insisted that this was exactly the
  reply made, whereas Volkmar asserted that the words were, "I am a child of
  the House of Saxony." But there can be no doubt that his imagination
  supplemented the actual words used with those he wished to hear.</p>

  <p>"The small-pox has altered you since you left home," said Volkmar.</p>

  <p>"Very likely. I have had the small-pox since I left my home."</p>

  <p>Volkmar at once placed his house, his servants, his purse, at the disposal
  of his guest, and his offer was readily accepted.</p>

  <p>It is now advisable to turn back and explain the situation, by relating
  the early history of this person, who passed under the name of Karl Marbitz,
  an armourer; but whom a good number of people suspected of being something
  other than what he gave himself out to be, though only Volkmar and Pöckel and
  one or two others supposed him to be the Crown Prince of Saxony.</p>

  <p>Sophie Sabine Apitzsch was born at Lunzenau in Saxony in 1692, was well
  brought up, kept to school, and learned to write orthographically, and to
  have a fair general knowledge of history and geography. When she left school
  she was employed by her father in his trade, which was that of an armourer.
  She was tall and handsome, somewhat masculine&mdash;in after years a Cossack
  got into her boots&mdash;had the small-pox, which, however, only slightly
  disfigured her. In 1710 she had a suitor, a gamekeeper, Melchior Leonhart.
  But Sophie entertained a rooted dislike to marriage, and she kept her lover
  off for three years, till her father peremptorily ordered her to marry
  Melchior, and fixed the day for the wedding. Then Sophie one night got out of
  her own clothing, stepped into her father's best suit, and walked away in the
  garments of a man, and shortly afterwards appeared in Anspach under a feigned
  name, as a barber's assistant. Here she got into difficulties with the
  police, as she had no papers of legitimation, and to escape them, enlisted.
  She carried a musket for a month only, deserted, and resumed her vagabond
  life in civil attire, as a barber's assistant, and came to Leipzig, where she
  lodged at the Golden Cock. How she acquired the art, and how those liked it
  on whose faces she made her experiments with the razor, we are not told.</p>

  <p>At the Golden Cock lodged an athletic lady of the name of Anna Franke,
  stout, muscular, and able to lift great weights with her teeth, and with a
  jerk throw them over her shoulders. Anna Franke gave daily exhibitions of her
  powers, and on the proceeds maintained herself and her daughter, a girl of
  seventeen. The stout and muscular lady also danced on a tight rope, which
  with her bounces acted like a taut bowstring, projecting the athlete high
  into the air.</p>

  <p>The Fräulein Franke very speedily fell in love with the fine young barber,
  and proposed to her mother that Herr Karl should be taken into the concern,
  as he would be useful to stretch the ropes, and go round for coppers. Sophie
  was nothing loth to have her inn bill paid on these terms, but when finally
  the bouncing mother announced that her daughter's hand was at the disposal of
  Karl, then the situation became even more embarrassing than that at home from
  which Sophie had run away. The barber maintained her place as long as she
  could, but at last, when the endearments of the daughter became oppressive,
  and the urgency of the mother for speedy nuptials became vexatious, she
  pretended that the father, who was represented as a well-to-do citizen of
  Hamburg, must first be consulted. On this plea Sophie borrowed of Mother
  Franke the requisite money for her journey and departed, promising to return
  in a few weeks. Instead of fulfilling her promise, Sophie wrote to ask for a
  further advance of money, and when this was refused, disappeared altogether
  from the knowledge of the athlete and her daughter.</p>

  <p>On this second flight from marriage, Sophie Apitzsch met with an armourer
  named Karl Marbitz, and by some means or other contrived to get possession of
  his pass, leaving him instead a paper of legitimation made out under the name
  of Karl Gottfried, which old Mother Franke had induced the police to grant to
  the young barber who was engaged to marry her daughter.</p>

  <p>In June 1714, under the name of Marbitz, Sophie appeared among the
  Erz-Gebirge, the chain of mountains that separate Saxony from Bohemia, and
  begged her way from place to place, pretending to be a schoolmaster out of
  employ. After rambling about for some time, she took up her quarters with a
  baker at Elterlein. Here it was that for the first time a suspicion was
  aroused that she was a person of greater consequence than she gave out. The
  rumour reached the nearest magistrate that there was a mysterious stranger
  there who wore a ribbon and star of some order, and he at once went to the
  place to make inquiries, but found that Sophie had neither ribbon nor order,
  and that her papers declared in proper form who and what she was. At this
  time she fell ill at the baker's house, and the man, perhaps moved by the
  reports abroad concerning her, was ready to advance her money to the amount
  of £6 or £7. When recovered, she left the village where she had been ill, and
  went to another one, where she took up her abode with another baker, named
  Fischer, whom she helped in his trade, or went about practising upon the
  huntsman's horn.</p>

  <p>This amusement it was which brought her into trouble. Possibly she may not
  have known that the horn was a reserved instrument that might not be played
  by the ignoble.</p>

  <p>At the time that Volkmar took her out of the lockup, and carried her off
  to his mansion in his carriage, she was absolutely without money, in
  threadbare black coat, stockings ill darned, and her hair very much in want
  of powder.</p>

  <p>Hitherto her associates had been of the lowest classes; she had been
  superior to them in education, in morals, and in character, and had to some
  extent imposed on them. They acknowledged in her an undefined dignity and
  quiet reserve, with unquestioned superiority in attainments and general tone
  of mind, and this they attributed to her belonging to a vastly higher class
  in society.</p>

  <p>Now, all at once she was translated into another condition of life, one in
  which she had never moved before; but she did not lose her head; she
  maintained the same caution and reserve in it, and never once exposed her
  ignorance so as to arouse suspicion that she was not what people insisted on
  believing her to be. She was sufficiently shrewd never by word to compromise
  herself, and afterwards, when brought to trial, she insisted that she had not
  once asserted that she was other than Karl Marbitz the armourer. Others had
  imagined she was a prince, but she had not encouraged them in their delusion
  by as much as a word. That, no doubt, was true, but she accepted the honours
  offered and presents made her under this erroneous impression, without an
  attempt to open the eyes of the deluded to their own folly.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this was more than could be expected of her. "Foolery," said the
  clown in "Twelfth Night," "does walk about the orb, like the sun; it shines
  everywhere"&mdash;and what are fools but the natural prey of the clever?</p>

  <p>Sophie had been ill, reduced to abject poverty, was in need of good food,
  new clothes, and shelter; all were offered, even forced upon her. Was she
  called upon to reject them? She thought not.</p>

  <p>Now that Volkmar had a supposed prince under his roof he threw open his
  house to the neighbourhood, and invited every gentleman he knew&mdash;except
  the von Günthers. He provided the prince with a coat of scarlet cloth frogged
  and laced with gold, with a new hat, gave him a horse, filled his purse, and
  provided him with those identical boots in which a century later a Cossack
  marched into Paris.</p>

  <p>She was addressed by her host and hostess as "Your Highness," and "Your
  Serenity," and they sought to kiss her hand, but she waived away these
  exhibitions of servility, saying, "Let be&mdash;we will regard each other as
  on a common level." Once Volkmar said slyly to her, "What would your august
  father say if he knew you were here?"</p>

  <p>"He would be surprised," was all the answer that could be drawn from her.
  One day the newspaper contained information of the Crown Prince's doings in
  Paris with his tutor and attendants. Volkmar pointed it out to her with a
  twinkle of the eye, saying, "Do not suppose I am to be hoodwinked by such
  attempts to deceive the public as that."</p>

  <p>In the mornings when the pseudo prince left the bedroom, outside the door
  stood Herr Volkmar, cap in hand, bowing. As he offered her a pinch of snuff
  from a gold <i>tabatière</i> one day, he saw her eyes rest on it; he at once
  said, "This belonged formerly to the Königsmark."</p>

  <p>"Then," she replied, "it will have the double initials on it. 'A' for
  Aurora."</p>

  <p>Now, argued Volkmar, how was it likely that his guest should know the
  scandalous story of Augustus I. and the fair Aurora of Königsmark, mother of
  the famous French marshal, unless he had belonged to the royal family of
  Saxony?[14] He left out of account that Court scandal is talked about
  everywhere, and is in the mouths of all. Then he presented her with the
  snuff-box. Next he purchased for her a set of silver plate for her cover, and
  ordered a ribbon and a star of diamonds, because it became one of such
  distinguished rank not to appear without a decoration! As the girl said
  afterwards at her trial, she had but to hint a desire for anything, and it
  was granted her at once. Her host somewhat bored her with political
  disquisitions; he was desirous of impressing on his illustrious guest what a
  political genius he was, and in his own mind had resolved to become prime
  minister of Saxony in the place of the fallen Beichlingen, who was said to
  have made so much money out of the State that he could buy a principality,
  and who, indeed, struck a medal with his arms on it surmounted by a princely
  crown.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[14] Aurora v. Königsmark went out of favour in
  1698&mdash;probably then sold the gold snuff-box. She died in 1728.</p>

  <p>But Volkmar's ambition went further. As already stated he had a
  daughter&mdash;the modest Joanna; what a splendid opportunity was in the
  hands of the scheming parents! If the young prince formed an attachment for
  Joanna, surely he might get the emperor to elevate her by diploma to the rank
  of a princess, and thus Volkmar would see his Joanna Queen of Poland and
  Electress of Saxony. He and Frau Volkmar were far too good people to scheme
  to get their daughter such a place as the old Königsmark had occupied with
  the reigning sovereign. Besides, Königsmark had been merely created a
  countess, and who would crave to be a countess when she might be Queen? and a
  favourite, when, by playing her cards well, she might become a legitimate
  wife?</p>

  <p>So the old couple threw Joanna at the head of their guest, and did their
  utmost to entangle him. In the meantime the von Günthers were flaming with
  envy and rage. They no more doubted that the Volkmars had got the Crown
  Prince living with them, than did the Volkmars themselves. The whole
  neighbourhood flowed to the entertainments given in his honour at Hetzdorf;
  only the von Günthers were shut out. But von Günther met the mysterious
  stranger at one or two of the return festivities given by the gentry who had
  been entertained at Hetzdorf, and he seized on one of these occasions boldly
  to invite his Highness to pay him also a visit at his "little place;" and
  what was more than he expected, the offer was accepted.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Apitzsch who had twice run away from matrimony, was becoming
  embarrassed again by the tenderness of Joanna and the ambition of the
  parents.</p>

  <p>The dismay of the Volkmars passes description when their guest informed
  them he was going to pay a visit to the hated rivals.</p>

  <p>Sophie was fetched away in the von Günther carriage, and by servants put
  into new liveries for the occasion, and was received and entertained with the
  best at Jägerhof. Here, also, presents were made; among others a silver cover
  for table was given her by the daughter of her host, who had married a major,
  and who hoped, in return, to see her husband advanced to be a general.</p>

  <p>She was taken to see the royal castle of Augustusburg, and here a little
  difference of testimony occurs as to the observation she made in the chapel,
  which was found to be without an organ. At her trial it was asserted that she
  had said, "I must order an organ," but she positively swore she had said, "An
  organ ought to be provided." She was taken also to the mansion of the Duke of
  Holstein at Weisenburg, where she purchased one of his horses&mdash;that is
  to say, agreed to take it, and let her hosts find the money.</p>

  <p>The visit to the von Günthers did not last ten days, and then she was back
  again with the Volkmars, to their exuberant delight. Why she remained so
  short a time at Jägerhof does not appear. Possibly she may have been there
  more in fear of detection than at Hetzdorf. Now that the Volkmars had her
  back they would not let her out of their sight. They gave her two servants in
  livery to attend her; they assured her that her absence had so affected
  Joanna that the girl had done nothing but weep, and had refused to eat. They
  began to press in their daughter's interest for a declaration of intentions,
  and that negotiations with the Emperor should be opened that a title of
  princess of the Holy Roman Empire might be obtained for her as preliminary to
  the nuptials.</p>

  <p>Sophie Apitzsch saw that she must again make a bolt to escape the marriage
  ring, and she looked about for an opportunity. But there was no evading the
  watch of the Volkmars, who were alarmed lest their guest should again go to
  the hated von Günthers.</p>

  <p>Well would it have been for the Volkmars had they kept the "prince" under
  less close surveillance, and allowed him to succeed in his attempts to get
  away. It would have been to their advantage in many ways.</p>

  <p>A fortnight or three weeks passed, and the horse bought of the Duke of
  Holstein had not been sent In fact the Duke, when the matter was communicated
  to him, was puzzled. He knew that the Crown Prince was in Paris, and could
  not have visited his stables, and promised to purchase his horse. So he
  instituted inquiries before he consented to part with the horse, and at once
  the bubble burst. Police arrived at Hetzdorf to arrest the pretender, and
  convey her to Augustusburg, where she was imprisoned, till her trial. This
  was in February, 1715. In her prison she had an apoplectic stroke, but
  recovered. Sentence was pronounced against her by the court at Leipzig in
  1716, that she should be publicly whipped out of the country. That is to say,
  sent from town to town, and whipped in the market-place of each, till she was
  sent over the frontier. In consideration of her having had a stroke, the king
  commuted the sentence to whipping in private, and imprisonment at his
  majesty's pleasure.</p>

  <p>She does not seem to have been harshly treated by the gaoler of Waldheim,
  the prison to which she was sent. She was given her own room, she dined at
  the table of the gaoler, continued to wear male clothes, and was cheerful,
  obedient, and contented. In 1717 both she and her father appealed to the king
  for further relaxation of her sentence, but this was refused. The prison
  authorities gave her the best testimony for good conduct whilst in their
  hands.</p>

  <p>In the same year, 1717, the unfortunate Volkmar made a claim for the
  scarlet coat&mdash;which he said the moths were likely to eat unless placed
  on some one's back&mdash;the gold snuff-box, the silver spoons, dishes,
  forks, the horse, the watch, and various other things he had given Sophie,
  being induced to do so by false representations. The horse as well as the
  plate, the star, the snuff-box, the coat and the boots had all been
  requisitioned as evidence before her trial. The question was a hard one to
  solve, whether Herr Volkmar could recover presents, and it had to be
  transmitted from one court to another. An order of court dated January, 1722,
  required further evidence to be produced before purse, coat, boots, &amp;c.,
  could be returned to Volkmar&mdash;that is, <i>seven</i> years after they had
  been taken into the custody of the Court. The horse must have eaten more than
  his cost by this time, and the coat must have lost all value through
  moth-eating. The cost of proceedings was heavy, and Volkmar then withdrew
  from his attempt to recover the objects given to the false prince.</p>

  <p>But already&mdash;long before, by decree of October 1717&mdash;Sophie
  Apitzsch had been liberated. She left prison in half male, half female
  costume, and in this dress took service with a baker at Waldheim; and we hear
  no more of her, whether she married, and when she died.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; PETER NIELSEN</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the 29th day of April in the year 1465, died Henry
  Strangebjerg, bishop of Ribe in Denmark, after having occupied the See for
  just ten years. For some days before his decease public, official prayer had
  been made for his recovery by the Cathedral Chapter, but in their hearts the
  Canons were impatient for his departure. Not, be it understood, that the
  Bishop was an unworthy occupant of the See of Liafdag the Martyr&mdash;on the
  contrary, he had been a man of exemplary conduct; nor because he was harsh in
  his rule&mdash;on the contrary, he had been a lenient prelate. The reason
  why, when official prayer was made for his recovery, it was neutralised by
  private intercession for his removal, was solely this&mdash;his removal
  opened a prospect of advancement.</p>

  <p>The Cathedral Chapter of Ribe consisted of fifteen Canons, and a Dean or
  Provost, all men of family, learning and morals. Before the doctors had
  shaken their heads over the sick bed of Henry Strangebjerg, it was known
  throughout Ribe that there would be four candidates for the vacant throne. It
  was, of course, impossible for more than one man to be elected; but as the
  election lay entirely and uncontrolledly in the hands of the Chapter, it was
  quite possible for a Canon to make a good thing out of an election without
  being himself elected. The bishops nominated to many benefices, and there
  existed then no law against pluralities. The newly chosen prelate, if he had
  a spark of gratitude, must reward those faithful men who had made him
  bishop.</p>

  <p>At 4 p.m. on April 29th the breath left the body of Henry Strangebjerg. At
  4.15 p.m. the Chapter were rubbing their hands and drawing sighs of relief.
  But Thomas Lange, the Dean, rubbed his hands and drew his sigh of relief ten
  minutes earlier, viz., at 4.5 p.m., for he stood by the bed of the dying
  bishop. At 3.25 p.m. Thomas Lange's nerves had received a great shock, for a
  flicker as of returning life had manifested itself in the sick man, and for a
  few minutes he really feared he might recover. At 4.10 p.m. Hartwig Juel, the
  Archdeacon, who had been standing outside the bishop's door, was seen running
  down the corridor with a flush in his cheeks. Through the keyhole he had
  heard the Dean exclaim: "Thank God!" and when he heard that pious
  ejaculation, he knew that all dread of the Bishop's restoration was over. It
  was not till so late as 4.20 p.m. that Olaf Petersen knew it. Olaf was
  kneeling in the Cathedral, in the Chapel of St. Lambert, the yellow chapel as
  it was called, absorbed in devotion, consequently the news did not reach him
  till five minutes after the Chapter, twenty minutes after the vacation of the
  See. Olaf Petersen was a very holy man; he was earnest and sincere. He was,
  above everything, desirous of the welfare of the Church and the advancement
  of religion. He was ascetic, denying himself in food, sleep and clothing, and
  was profuse in his alms and in his devotions. He saw the worldliness, the
  self-seeking, the greed of gain and honours that possessed his fellows, and
  he was convinced that one thing was necessary for the salvation of
  Christianity in Ribe, and that one thing was his own election to the See.</p>

  <p>The other candidates were moved by selfish interests. He cared only for
  true religion. Providence would do a manifest injustice if it did not take
  cognizance of his integrity and interfere to give him the mitre. He was
  resolved to use no unworthy means to secure it. He would make no promises,
  offer no bribes&mdash;that is, to his fellow Canons, but he promised a silver
  candlestick to St. Lambert, and bribed St. Gertrude to intervene with the
  assurance of a pilgrimage to her shrine.</p>

  <p>We have mentioned only three of the candidates. The fourth was Jep
  Mundelstrup, an old and amiable man, who had not thrust himself forward, but
  had been put forward by his friends, who considered him sufficiently
  malleable to be moulded to their purposes.</p>

  <p>Jep was, as has been said, old; he was so old that it was thought (and
  hoped), if chosen, his tenure of office would be but brief. Four or five
  years&mdash;under favourable circumstances, such as a changeable winter, a
  raw spring with east winds&mdash;he might drop off even sooner, and leave the
  mitre free for another scramble.</p>

  <p>The Kings of Denmark no longer nominated to the Sees, sent no <i>congé
  d'élire</i> to the Chapter. They did not even appoint to the Canonries.
  Consequently the Canons had everything pretty much their own way, and had
  only two things to consider, to guide their determination&mdash;the good of
  the Church and their own petty interests. The expression "good of the Church"
  demands comment. "The good of the Church" was the motive, the only recognised
  motive, on which the Chapter were supposed to act. Practically, however, it
  was non-existent as a motive. It was a mere figure of speech used to cloak
  selfish ambition.</p>

  <p>From this sweeping characterisation we must, however, exclude Olaf
  Petersen, who did indeed regard pre-eminently the good of the Church, but
  then that good was, in his mind, inextricably involved with his own fortunes.
  He was the man to make religion a living reality. He was the man to bring the
  Church back to primitive purity. He could not blind his eyes to the fact that
  not one of the Canons beside himself cared a farthing for spiritual matters;
  therefore he desired the mitre for his own brows.</p>

  <p>The conclave at which the election was to be made was fixed for the
  afternoon of the day on which Henry Strangebjerg was to be buried, and the
  burial was appointed to take place as soon as was consistent with
  decency.</p>

  <p>The whole of the time between the death and the funeral was taken up by
  the Canons with hurrying to and from each other's residences, canvassing for
  votes.</p>

  <p>Olaf Petersen alone refrained from canvassing, he spent his whole time in
  fasting and prayer, so anxious was he for the welfare of the Church and the
  advancement of true religion.</p>

  <p>At length&mdash;Boom! Boom! Boom! The great bell of the minster tower
  summoned the Chapter to the hall of conclave. Every Canon was in his place,
  fifteen Canons and the provost, sixteen in all. It was certain that the
  provost, although chairman, would claim his right to vote, and exercise it,
  voting for himself. It was ruled that all voting should be open, for two
  reasons&mdash;that the successful candidate might know who had given him
  their shoulders on which to mount, and so reward these shoulders by laying
  many benefices upon them, and secondly, that he might know who had been his
  adversaries, and so might exclude them from preferments. Every one believed
  he would be on the winning side, no one supposed the other alternative
  possible.</p>

  <p>The candidates, as already intimated, were four. Thomas Lange, the Dean,
  who belonged to a good, though not wealthy family. He had been in business
  before taking orders, and brought with him into the Church practical
  shrewdness and business habits. He had husbanded well the resources of the
  Chapter, and had even enlarged its revenue by the purchase of three farms and
  a manor.</p>

  <p>The second candidate, Hartwig Juel, was a member of a powerful noble
  family. His brother was at Court and highly regarded by King Christian. His
  election would gratify the king. Hartwig Juel was Archdeacon.</p>

  <p>The third candidate was the good old Jep Mundelstrup; and the fourth was
  the representative of the ascetic, religious party, which was also the party
  of reform, Olaf Petersen.</p>

  <p>The Dean was, naturally, chairman. Before taking the chair he announced
  his intention of voting. The four candidates were proposed, and the votes
  taken.</p>

  <p>The Dean numbered 4.</p>

  <p>Hartwig Juel numbered 4.</p>

  <p>Jep Mundelstrup numbered 4.</p>

  <p>Olaf Petersen numbered 4.</p>

  <p>Moreover, each candidate had voted for himself.</p>

  <p>What was to be done? The Chapter sat silent, looking about them in each
  others' faces.</p>

  <p>Then the venerable Jep Mundelstrup, assisted by those who sat by him,
  staggered to his feet, and leaning on his staff, he mumbled forth this
  address: "My reverend brothers, it was wholly without my desire and not in
  furtherance of any ambition of mine, that my name was put up as that of a
  candidate for the vacant mitre of the Holy See of Ribe. I am old and infirm.
  With the patriarch Jacob I may say, 'Few and evil have been the days of the
  years of my life.' and I am not worthy to receive so great an honour. Evil my
  days have been, because I have had only my Canonry and one sorry living to
  support me; and there are comforts I should desire in my old age which I
  cannot afford. My health is not sound. I shrink from the responsibilities and
  labours of a bishopric. If I withdraw my candidature, I feel confident that
  the successful candidate will not forget my infirmities, and the facility I
  have afforded for his election. I decline to stand, and at the same time,
  lest I should seem to pose in opposition to three of my excellent brethren, I
  decline also to vote." Then he sat down, amidst general applause.</p>

  <p>Here was an unexpected simplification of matters. The Dean and Hartwig
  Juel cast kindly, even affectionate glances at those who had previously voted
  for Jep, Olaf Petersen looked up to heaven and prayed.</p>

  <p>Again, the votes were taken, and again the chairman claimed his right to
  vote.</p>

  <p>When taken they stood thus:</p>

  <p>The Dean, 5.</p>

  <p>Hartwig Juel, 5.</p>

  <p>Olaf Petersen, 5.</p>

  <p>What was to be done? Again the Chapter sat silent, rubbing their chins,
  and casting furtive glances at each other. The Chapter was adjourned to the
  same hour on the morrow. The intervening hours were spent in negociations
  between the several parties, and attempts made by the two first in
  combination to force Olaf Petersen to resign his candidature. But Olaf was
  too conscientious a man to do this. He felt that the salvation of souls
  depended on his staying the plague like Phinehas with his censer.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The Cathedral bell again summoned the conclave to the
  Chapter House.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to business the Dean, as chairman, addressed the
  electors. He was an eloquent man, and he set in moving words before them the
  solemnity of the duty imposed on them, the importance of considering only the
  welfare of the Church, and the responsibility that would weigh on them should
  they choose an unworthy prelate. He conjured them in tones vibrating with
  pathos, to put far from them all self-seeking thoughts, and to be guided only
  by conscience. Then he sat down. The votes were again taken. Jep Mundelstrup
  again shaking his head, and refusing to vote. When counted, they stood
  thus.</p>

  <p>Thomas Lange, 5.</p>

  <p>Hartwig Juel, 5.</p>

  <p>Olaf Petersen, 5.</p>

  <p>Then up started the Dean, very red in the face, and said, "Really this is
  preposterous! Are we to continue this farce? Some of the brethren must yield
  for the general good. I would cheerfully withdraw my candidature, but for one
  consideration. You all know that the temporal affairs of the See have fallen
  into confusion. Our late excellent prelate was not a man of business, and
  there has been alienation, and underletting, and racking out of church lands,
  which I have marked with anxiety, and which I am desirous to remedy. You all
  know that I have this one good quality, I am a business man, understand
  account keeping, and look sharp after the pecuniary interests of the Chapter
  lands. It is essential that the lands of the See should be attended to by
  some practical man like myself, therefore I do not withdraw from my
  candidature, but therefore only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then up sprang Hartwig Juel, and said, "The very Reverend the Dean has
  well said, this farce must not continue. Some must yield if a bishop is to be
  elected. I would cheerfully withdraw from candidature but for one little
  matter. I hold in my hand a letter received this morning from my brother, who
  tells me that his most gracious majesty, King Christian, expressed himself to
  my brother in terms of hope that I should be elected. You, my reverend
  brothers, all know that we are living in a critical time when it is most
  necessary that a close relation, a cordial relation, should be maintained
  between the Church and the State. Therefore, in the political interests of
  the See, but only in these interests, I cannot withdraw my candidature."</p>

  <p>Then all eyes turned on Olaf Petersen. His face was pale, his lips set. He
  stood up, and leaning forward said firmly, "The pecuniary and the political
  interests of the See are as nothing to me, its spiritual interests are
  supreme. Heaven is my witness, I have no personal ambition to wear the mitre.
  I know it will cause exhausting labour and terrible responsibilities, from
  which I shrink. Nevertheless, seeing as I do that this is a period in the
  history of the Church when self-seeking and corruption have penetrated her
  veins and are poisoning her life-blood, seeing as I do that unless there be a
  revival of religion, and an attempt at reform be made within the Church,
  there will ensue such a convulsion as will overthrow her, therefore, and only
  therefore do I feel that I can not withdraw from my candidature."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the Dean in a crusty tone. "There is nothing for it but
  for us to vote again. Now at least we have clear issues before us, the
  temporal, the political, and the spiritual interests of the Church." The
  votes were again taken, and stood thus.</p>

  <p>The temporal interests, 5.</p>

  <p>The political interests, 5.</p>

  <p>The spiritual interests, 5.</p>

  <p>Here was a dead lock. It was clear that parties were exactly divided, and
  that none would yield.</p>

  <p>After a pause of ten minutes, Jep Mundelstrup was again helped to his
  feet. He looked round the Chapter with blinking eyes, and opened and shut his
  mouth several times before he came to speak. At last he said, in faltering
  tones, "My reverend brethren, it is clear to me that my resignation has
  complicated, rather than helped matters forward. Do not think I am about to
  renew my candidature, <i>that</i> I am not, but I am going to make a
  proposition to which I hope you will give attentive hearing. If we go on in
  this manner, we shall elect no one, and then his Majesty, whom God bless,
  will step in and nominate."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear!" from the adherents of Hartwig Juel.</p>

  <p>"I do not for a moment pretend that the nominee of his Majesty would not
  prove an excellent bishop, but I do fear that a nomination by the crown would
  be the establishment of a dangerous precedent."</p>

  <p>"Hear! hear!" from the adherents of Olaf Petersen.</p>

  <p>"At the same time it must be borne in mind that the temporal welfare of
  the See ought to be put in the hands of some one conversant with the
  condition into which they have been allowed to lapse."</p>

  <p>"Hear! hear!" from the adherents of Thomas Lange.</p>

  <p>"I would suggest, as we none of us can agree, that we refer the decision
  to an umpire."</p>

  <p>General commotion, and whispers, and looks of alarm.</p>

  <p>"How are we to obtain one at once conversant with the condition of the
  diocese, and not a partizan?" asked the Dean.</p>

  <p>"There is a wretched little village in the midst of the Roager Heath, cut
  off from communication with the world, in which lives a priest named Peter
  Nielsen on his cure, a man who is related to no one here, belongs, I believe,
  to no gentle family, and, therefore, would have no family interests one way
  or the other to bias him. He has the character of being a shrewd man of
  business, some of the estates of the Church are on the Roager Heath, and he
  knows how they have been treated, and I have always heard that he is a good
  preacher and an indefatigable parish priest. Let him be umpire. I can think
  of none other who would not be a partizan."</p>

  <p>The proposition was so extraordinary and unexpected that the Chapter, at
  first, did not know what to think of it. Who was this Peter Nielsen? No one
  knew of him anything more than what Jep Mundelstrup had said, and he, it was
  believed, had drawn largely on his imagination for his facts. Indeed, he was
  the least known man among the diocesan clergy. It was disputed whether he was
  a good preacher. Who had heard him? no one. Was it true that he was not a
  gentleman by birth? No one knew to what family he belonged. In default of any
  other solution to the dead lock in which the Chapter stood, it was agreed by
  all that the selection of a bishop for Ribe should be left to Peter Nielsen
  of Roager.</p>

  <p>That same day, indeed as soon after the dissolution of the meeting as was
  possible, one of the Canons mounted his horse, and rode away to the Roager
  Heath.</p>

  <p>The village of Ro or Raa-ager, literally the rough or barren field, lay in
  the dead flat of sandy heath that occupies so large a portion of the centre
  and west coast of Jutland, and which goes by various names, as Randböll Heath
  and Varde Moor. In many places it is mere fen, where the water lies and
  stagnates. In others it is a dry waste of sand strewn with coarse grass and a
  few scant bushes. The village itself consisted of one street of cottages
  thatched with turf, and with walls built of the same, heather and grass
  sprouting from the interstices of the blocks. The church was little more
  dignified than the hovels. It was without tower and bell. Near the church was
  the parsonage.</p>

  <p>The Canon descended from his cob; he had ridden faster than was his wont,
  and was hot. He drew his sleeve across his face and bald head, and then threw
  the bridle over the gate-post.</p>

  <p>In the door of the parsonage stood a short, stout, rosy-faced, dark-eyed
  woman, with two little children pulling at her skirts. This was Maren Grubbe,
  the housekeeper of the pastor, at least that was her official designation.
  She had been many years at Roager with Peter Nielsen, and was believed to
  manage him as well as the cattle and pigs and poultry of the glebe. From
  behind her peered a shock-headed boy of about eight years with a very dirty
  face and cunning eyes.</p>

  <p>The Canon stood and looked at the woman, then at the children, and the
  woman and children stood and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Is this the house of the priest, Peter Nielsen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, do you want him?" inquired the housekeeper.</p>

  <p>"I have come from Ribe to see him on diocesan business."</p>

  <p>"Step inside," said the housekeeper curtly. "His reverence is not in the
  house at this moment, he is in the church saying his offices."</p>

  <p>"That's lies!" shouted the dirty boy from behind. "Dada is in the pigstye
  setting a trap for the rats."</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue, Jens!" exclaimed the woman, giving the boy a cuff which
  knocked him over. Then to the Canon she said, "Take a seat and I will go to
  the church after him."</p>

  <p>She went out with the two smaller children staggering at her skirts,
  tumbling, picking themselves up, going head over heels, crowing and
  squealing.</p>

  <p>When she was outside the house, the dirty boy sat upright on the floor,
  winked at the Canon, crooked his fingers, and said, "Follow me, and I will
  show you Dada."</p>

  <p>The bald-headed ecclesiastic rose, and guided by the boy went into a back
  room, through a small window in which he saw into the pig-styes, and there,
  without his coat, in a pair of stained and patched breeches, and a blue
  worsted night-cap, over ankles in filth, was the parish priest engaged in
  setting a rat-trap. Outside, in the yard, the pigs were enjoying their
  freedom. Leisurely round the corner came the housekeeper with the satellites.
  "There, Peers!" said she, "There is a reverend gentleman from the cathedral
  come after thee."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the pastor, slowly rising, "do thou, Maren, keep out of
  sight, and especially be careful not to produce the brats. Their presence
  opens the door to misconstruction."</p>

  <p>The Canon stole back to his seat, mopped his brow and head, and thought to
  himself that the Chapter had put the selection of a chief pastor into very
  queer hands. The nasty little boy began to giggle and snuffle simultaneously.
  "Have you seen Dada? Dada saying his prayers in there."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked the ecclesiastic stiffly of the child.</p>

  <p>"I'm Jens," answered the boy.</p>

  <p>"I know you are Jens, I heard your mother call you so. I presume that
  person is your mother."</p>

  <p>"That is my mother, but Dada is not my dada."</p>

  <p>"O, Jens, boy, Jens! Truth above all things. Magna est veritas et
  prævalebit." The Reverend Peter Nielsen entered, clean, in a cassock, and
  with a shovel hat on his head.</p>

  <p>"The children whom you have seen," said Peter Nielsen, "are the nephews
  and nieces of my worthy housekeeper, Maria Grubbe. She is a charitable woman,
  and as her sister is very poor, and has a large family, my Maren, I mean my
  housekeeper, takes charge of some of the overflow."[15]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[15] In Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Iceland, clerical
  celibacy was never enforced before the Reformation. Now and then a formal
  prohibition was issued by the bishops, but it was generally ignored. The
  clergy were married, openly and undisguisedly.</p>

  <p>"It is a great burden to you," said the Canon.</p>

  <p>Peter Nielsen shrugged his shoulders. "To clothe the naked and give food
  to the hungry are deeds of mercy."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand, quite," said the Canon.</p>

  <p>"I only mentioned it," continued the parish priest, "lest you should
  suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," said the Canon, interrupting him, with a bow and a
  benignant smile.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Peter Nielsen, "I am at your service."</p>

  <p>Thereupon the Canon unfolded to his astonished hearer the nature of his
  mission. The pastor sat listening attentively with his head bowed, and his
  hands planted on his knees. Then, when his visitor had done speaking, he
  thrust his left hand into his trouser pocket and produced a palmful of
  carraway seed. He put some into his mouth, and began to chew it; whereupon
  the whole room became scented with carraway.</p>

  <p>"I am fond of this seed," said the priest composedly, whilst he turned
  over the grains in his hand with the five fingers of his right. "It is good
  for the stomach, and it clears the brain. So I understand that there are
  three parties?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly, there is that of Olaf Petersen, a narrow, uncompromising man,
  very sharp on the morals of the clergy; there is also that of the Dean,
  Thomas Lange, an ambitious and scheming ecclesiastic; and there is lastly
  that of the Archdeacon Hartwig Juel, one of the most amiable men in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"And you incline strongly to the latter?"</p>

  <p>"I do&mdash;how could you discover that? Juel is not a man to forget a
  friend who has done him a favour."</p>

  <p>"Now, see!" exclaimed Peter Nielsen, "See the advantage of chewing
  carraway seed. Three minutes ago I knew or recollected nothing about Hartwig
  Juel, but I do now remember that five years ago he passed through Roager, and
  did me the honour of partaking of such poor hospitality as I was able to
  give. I supplied him and his four attendants, and six horses, with
  refreshment. Bless my soul! the efficacy of carraway is prodigious! I can now
  recall all that took place. I recollect that I had only hogs' puddings to
  offer the Archdeacon, his chaplain, and servants, and they ate up all I had.
  I remember also that I had a little barrel of ale which I broached for them,
  and they drank the whole dry. To be sure!&mdash;I had a bin of oats, and the
  horses consumed every grain! I know that the Archdeacon regretted that I had
  no bell to my church, and that he promised to send me one. He also assured me
  he would not leave a stone unturned till he had secured for me a better and
  more lucrative cure. I even sent a side of bacon away with him as a
  present&mdash;but nothing came of the promises. I ought to have given him a
  bushel of carraway. You really have no notion of the poverty of this living.
  I cannot now offer you any other food than buck-wheat brose, as I have no
  meat in the house. I can only give you water to drink as I am without beer. I
  cannot even furnish you with butter and milk, as I have not a cow."</p>

  <p>"Not even a cow!" exclaimed the Canon. "I really am thankful for your
  having spoken so plainly to me. I had no conception that your cure was so
  poor. That the Archdeacon should not have fulfilled the promises he made you
  is due to forgetfulness. Indeed, I assure you, for the last five years I have
  repeatedly seen Hartwig Juel strike his brow and exclaim, 'Something troubles
  me. I have made a promise, and cannot recall it. This lies on my conscience,
  and I shall have no peace till I recollect and discharge it.' This is plain
  fact."</p>

  <p>"Take him a handful of carraway," urged the parish priest.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he will remember all when I speak to him, unaided by
  carraway."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I can offer you," said Peter Nielsen, "a mug of
  dill-water."</p>

  <p>"Dill-water! what is that?"</p>

  <p>"It is made from carraway. It is given to infants to enable them to retain
  their milk. It is good for adults to make them recollect their promises."</p>

  <p>"My dear good friend," said the Canon rising, "your requirements shall be
  complied with to-morrow. I see you have excellent pasture here for sheep.
  Have you any?"</p>

  <p>The parish priest shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That is a pity. That however can be rectified. Good-bye, rely on me.
  <i>Qui pacem habet, se primum pacat.</i>"</p>

  <p>When the Canon was gone, Peter Nielsen, who had attended him to the door,
  turned, and found Maren Grubbe behind him.</p>

  <p>"I say, Peers!" spoke the housekeeper, nudging him, "What is the meaning
  of all this? What was that Latin he said as he went away?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, good Maren," answered the priest, "he quoted a saying familiar
  to us clergy. At the altar is a little metal plate with a cross on it, and
  this is called the Pax, or Peace. During the mass the priest kisses it, and
  then hands it to his assistant, who kisses it in turn and passes it on so
  throughout the attendance. The Latin means this, 'Let him who has the Pax
  bless himself with it before giving it out of his hands,' and means nothing
  more than this: 'Charity begins at Home,' or&mdash;put more boldly still,
  'Look out for Number I.'"</p>

  <p>"Now, see here," said the housekeeper, "you have been too moderate, Peers,
  you have not looked out sufficiently for Number I. Leave the next comer to
  me. No doubt that the Dean will send to you, in like manner as the Archdeacon
  sent to-day."</p>

  <p>"As you like, Maren, but keep the children in the background. Charity that
  thinketh no ill, is an uncommon virtue."</p>

  <p>Next morning early there arrived at the parsonage a waggon laden with
  sides of bacon, smoked beef, a hogshead of prime ale, a barrel of claret, and
  several sacks of wheat. It had scarcely been unloaded when a couple of milch
  cows arrived; half an hour later came a drove of sheep. Peter Nielsen
  disposed of everything satisfactorily about the house and glebe. His eye
  twinkled, he rubbed his hands, and said to himself with a chuckle, "He who
  blesses, blesses first himself."</p>

  <p>In the course of the morning a rider drew up at the house door. Maren
  flattened her nose at the little window of the guest-room, and scrutinized
  the arrival before admitting him. Then she nodded her head, and whispered to
  the priest to disappear. A moment later she opened the door, and ushered a
  stout red-faced ecclesiastic into the room.</p>

  <p>"Is the Reverend Pastor at home?" he asked, bowing to Maren Grubbe; "I
  have come to see him on important business."</p>

  <p>"He is at the present moment engaged with a sick parishioner. He will be
  here in a quarter of an hour. He left word before going out, that should your
  reverence arrive before his return&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What! I was expected!"</p>

  <p>"The venerable the Archdeacon sent a deputation to see my master
  yesterday, and he thought it probable that a deputation from the very
  Reverend the Dean would arrive to-day."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! So Hartwig Juel has stolen a march on us."</p>

  <p>"Hartwig Juel had on a visit some little while ago made promises to my
  master of a couple of cows, a herd of sheep, some ale, wine, wheat, and so
  on, and he took advantage of the occasion to send all these things to
  us."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Hartwig Juel's practice is sharp."</p>

  <p>"Thomas Lange will make up no doubt for dilatoriness."</p>

  <p>"Humph! and Olaf Petersen, has he sent?"</p>

  <p>"His deputation will, doubtless, come to-morrow, or even this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>The Canon folded his hands over his ample paunch, and looked hard at Maren
  Grubbe. She was attired in her best. Her cheeks shone like quarendon apples,
  as red and glossy; full of health&mdash;with a threat of temper, just as a
  hot sky has in it indications of a tempest. Her eyes were dark as sloes, and
  looked as sharp. She was past middle age, but ripe and strong; for all
  that.</p>

  <p>The fat Canon sat looking at her, twirling his thumbs like a little
  windmill, over his paunch, without speaking. She also sat demurely with her
  hands flat on her knees, and looked him full and firm in the face.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking," said the Canon, "how well a set of silver chains
  would look about that neck, and pendant over that ample bosom."</p>

  <p>"Gold would look better," said Maren, and shut her mouth again.</p>

  <p>"And a crimson silk kerchief&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would do," interrupted the housekeeper, "for one who has not expectations
  of a crimson silk skirt."</p>

  <p>"Quite so." A pause, and the windmills recommenced working. Presently
  squeals were heard in the back premises. One of the children had fallen and
  hurt itself.</p>

  <p>"Cats?" asked the Canon.</p>

  <p>"Cats," answered Maren.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said the Canon. "I am fond of cats.'</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Maren.</p>

  <p>Then ensued an uproar. The door burst open, and in tumbled little Jens
  with one child in his arms, the other clinging to the seat of his pantaloons.
  These same articles of clothing had belonged to the Reverend Peter Nielsen,
  till worn out, when at the request of Maren, they had been given to her and
  cut down in length for Jens. In length they answered. The waistband was under
  the arms, indeed, but the legs were not too long. In breadth and capacity
  they were uncurtailed.</p>

  <p>"I cannot manage them, mother," said the boy. "It is of no use making me
  nurse. Besides, I want to see the stranger."</p>

  <p>"These children," said Maren, looking firmly in the face of the Canon,
  "call me mother, but they are the offspring of my sister, whose husband was
  lost last winter at sea. Poor thing, she was left with fourteen, and
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She put her apron to her eyes and wept.</p>

  <p>"O, noble charity!" said the fat priest enthusiastically. "You&mdash;I see
  it all&mdash;you took charge of the little orphans. You sacrifice your
  savings for them, your time is given to them. Emotion overcomes me. What is
  their name?"</p>

  <p>"Katts."</p>

  <p>"Cats?"</p>

  <p>"John Katts, and little Kristine and Sissely Katts."</p>

  <p>"And the worthy pastor assists in supporting these poor orphans?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in spite of his poverty. And now we are on this point, let me ask
  you if you have not been struck with the meanness of this parsonage house. I
  can assure you, there is not a decent room in it, upstairs the chambers are
  open to the rafters, unceiled."</p>

  <p>"My worthy woman," said the Canon, "I will see to this myself. Rely upon
  it, if the Dean becomes Bishop, he will see that the manses of his best
  clergy are put into thorough repair."</p>

  <p>"I should prefer to see the repairs begun at once," said Maren. "When the
  Dean becomes Bishop he will have so much to think about, that he might forget
  our parsonage house."</p>

  <p>"Madam," said the visitor, as he rose, "they shall be executed at once.
  When I see the charity shown in this humble dwelling, by pastor and
  housekeeper alike, I feel that it demands instantaneous acknowledgment."</p>

  <p>Then in came Peter Nielsen, and said, "I have not sufficient cattle-sheds.
  Sheep yards are also needed."</p>

  <p>"They shall be erected."</p>

  <p>Then the Canon caught up little Kirsten and little Sissel, and kissed
  their dirty faces. Maren's radiant countenance assured the Canon that the
  cause of Thomas Lange was won with Maren Grubbe.</p>

  <p>He took the parish priest by the hand, pressed it, and said in a low tone,
  "<i>Qui pacem habet, se primum pacat</i>. You understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," answered Peter Nielsen, with a smile.</p>

  <p>Next morning early there arrived at Roager a party of masons from Ribe,
  ready to pull down the old parsonage and build one more commodious and
  extensive. The pastor went over the plans with the master mason, suggested
  alterations and enlargements, and then, with a chuckle, he muttered to
  himself, "That is an excellent saying, <i>Qui pacem habet, se primum
  pacat</i>." Then looking up, he saw before him an ascetic, hollow-eyed,
  pale-faced priest.</p>

  <p>"I am Olaf Petersen," said the new comer. "I thought best to come over and
  see you myself; I think the true condition of the Church ought to be set
  before you, and that you should consider the spiritual welfare of the poor
  sheep in the Ribe fold, and give them a chief pastor who will care for the
  sheep and not for the wool."</p>

  <p>"I have got a flock of sheep already," said Peter Nielsen, coldly.
  "Hartwig Juel sent it me."</p>

  <p>"I think," continued Olaf, "that you should consider the edification of
  the spiritual building."</p>

  <p>"I am going to have a new parsonage erected," said Peter Nielsen, stiffly;
  "Thomas Lange has seen to that."</p>

  <p>"The Bishop needed for this diocese," Olaf Petersen went on, "should
  combine the harmlessness of the dove with the wisdom of the serpent."</p>

  <p>"If he does that," said Nielsen, roughly, "he will be half knave and half
  fool. Let us have the wisdom, that is what we want now; and one of the first
  maxims of wisdom in Church and State is, <i>Qui pacem habet, se primum
  pacat</i>. You take me?"</p>

  <p>Olaf sighed, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you see this plan," said Peter Nielsen. "I am going to have a byre
  fashioned on that, with room for a dozen oxen. I have but two cows; stables
  for two horses, I have not one; a waggon shed, I am without a wheeled
  conveyance. I shall have new rooms, and have no furniture to put in them.
  Now, to stock and furnish farm and parsonage will cost much money. I have not
  a hundred shillings in the world. What am I to do? The man who would be
  Bishop of Ribe should consider the welfare of one of the most influential,
  learned, and moral of the priests in the diocese, and do what he can to make
  him comfortable. Before we choose a cow we go over her, feel her, examine her
  parts; before we purchase a horse we look at the teeth and explore the hoofs,
  and try the wind. When we select a bishop we naturally try the stuff of which
  he is made, if liberal, generous, open-handed, amiable. You understand
  me?"</p>

  <p>Olaf sighed, and drops of cold perspiration stood on his brow. A contest
  was going on within. Simony was a mortal sin. Was there a savour of simony in
  offering a present to the man in whose hands the choice of a chief pastor
  lay? He feared so. But then&mdash;did not the end sometimes justify the
  means? As these questions rose in his mind and refused to be answered,
  something heavy fell at his feet. His hand had been plucking at his purse,
  and in his nervousness he had detached it from his girdle, and had let it
  slip through his fingers. He did not look down. He seemed not to notice his
  loss, but he moved away without another word, with bent head and troubled
  conscience. When he was gone, Peter Nielsen bowed himself, picked up the
  pouch, counted the gold coins in it, laughed, rubbed his hands, and said, "He
  who blesses, blesses first himself."</p>

  <p>Next day a litter stayed at the parsonage gate, and out of it, with great
  difficulty, supported on the arms of two servants, came the aged Jep
  Mundelstrup. He entered the guest-room and was accommodated with a seat. When
  he got his breath, he said, extending a roll of parchment to the incumbent of
  Roager, "You will not fail to remember that it was at <i>my</i> suggestion
  that the choice of a bishop was left with you. You are deeply indebted to me.
  But for me you would not have been visited and canvassed by the Dean, the
  Arch-deacon, and the Ascetic, either in person or by their representatives.
  You will please to remember that I was nominated, but seeing so many others
  proposed, I withdrew my name. I think you will allow that this exhibited
  great humility and shrinking from honour. In these worldly, self-seeking days
  such an example deserves notice and reward. I am old, and perhaps unequal to
  the labours of office, but I think I ought to be considered; although I did
  formally withdraw my candidature, I am not sure that I would refuse the mitre
  were it pressed on me. At all events it would be a compliment to offer it me
  and I might refuse it. <i>Qui pacem habet, se primum pacat.</i> You will not
  regret the return courtesy."</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The cathedral bell was summoning all Ribe to the minster
  to be present at the nomination of its bishop. All Ribe answered the
  summons.</p>

  <p>The cathedral stands on a hill called the Mount of Lilies, but the mount
  is of so slight an elevation that it does not protect the cathedral from
  overflow, and a spring tide with N.W. wind has been known to flood both town
  and minster and leave fishes on the sacred floor. The church is built of
  granite, brick and sandstone; originally the contrast may have been striking,
  but weather has smudged the colours together into an ugly brown-grey. The
  tower is lofty, narrow, and wanting a spire. It resembles a square ruler set
  up on end; it is too tall for its base. The church is stately, of early
  architecture with transepts, and the choir at their intersection with the
  nave, domed over, and a small semi-circular apse beyond, for the altar. The
  nave was crowded, the canons occupied the stalls in their purple tippets
  edged with crimson; purple, because the chapter of a cathedral; crimson
  edged, because the founder of the See was a martyr. Fifteen, and the Dean,
  sixteen in all, were in their places. On the altar steps, in the apse, in the
  centre, sat Peter Nielsen in his old, worn cassock, without surplice. On the
  left side of the altar stood the richly-sculptured Episcopal throne, and on
  the seat was placed the jewelled mitre, over the arm the cloth of gold cope
  was cast, and against the back leaned the pastoral crook of silver gilt,
  encrusted with precious stones.</p>

  <p>When the last note of the bell sounded, the Dean rose from his stall, and
  stepping up to the apse, made oath before heaven, the whole congregation and
  Peter Nielsen, that he was prepared to abide by the decision of this said
  Peter, son of Nicolas, parish priest of Roager. Amen. He was followed by the
  Archdeacon, then by each of the canons to the last.</p>

  <p>Then mass was said, during which the man in whose hands the fortunes of
  the See reposed, knelt with unimpassioned countenance and folded hands.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion he resumed his seat, the crucifix was brought forth and
  he kissed it.</p>

  <p>A moment of anxious silence. The moment for the decision had arrived. He
  remained for a short while seated, with his eyes fixed on the ground, then he
  turned them on the anxious face of the Dean, and after having allowed them to
  rest scrutinisingly there for a minute, he looked at Hartwig Juel, then at
  Olaf Petersen, who was deadly white, and whose frame shook like an aspen
  leaf. Then he looked long at Jep Mundelstrup and rose suddenly to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>The fall of a pin might have been heard in the cathedral at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>He said&mdash;and his voice was distinctly audible by every one
  present&mdash;"I have been summoned here from my barren heath, into this
  city, out of a poor hamlet, by these worthy and reverend fathers, to choose
  for them a prelate who shall be at once careful of the temporal and the
  spiritual welfare of the See. I have scrupulously considered the merits of
  all those who have been presented to me as candidates for the mitre. I find
  that in only one man are all the requisite qualities combined in proper
  proportion and degree&mdash;not in Thomas Lange," the Dean's head fell on his
  bosom, "nor in Hartwig Juel," the Archdeacon sank back in his stall; "nor in
  Olaf Petersen," the man designated uttered a faint cry and dropped on his
  knees, "nor in Jep Mundelstrup&mdash;but in myself. I therefore nominate
  Peter, son of Nicolas, commonly called Nielsen, Curate of Roager, to be
  Bishop of Ribe, twenty-ninth in descent from Liafdag the martyr. <i>Qui pacem
  habet, se primum pacat.</i> Amen. He who has to bless, blesses first
  himself."</p>

  <p>Then he sat down.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, and then a storm broke loose. Peter sat
  motionless, with his eyes fixed on the ground, motionless as a rock round
  which the waves toss and tear themselves to foam.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that the twenty-ninth bishop of Ribe was Peter
  Nielsen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE WONDER-WORKING PRINCE HOHENLOHE</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the year 1821, much interest was excited in Germany and,
  indeed, throughout Europe by the report that miracles of healing were being
  wrought by Prince Leopold Alexander of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst
  at Würzburg, Bamberg, and elsewhere. The wonders soon came to an end, for,
  after the ensuing year, no more was heard of his extraordinary powers.</p>

  <p>At the time, as might be expected, his claims to be a miracle-worker were
  hotly disputed, and as hotly asserted. Evidence was produced that some of his
  miracles were genuine; counter evidence was brought forward reducing them to
  nothing.</p>

  <p>The whole story of Prince Hohenlohe's sudden blaze into fame, and speedy
  extinction, is both curious and instructive. In the Baden village of
  Wittighausen, at the beginning of this century, lived a peasant named Martin
  Michel, owning a farm, and in fairly prosperous circumstances. His age,
  according to one authority, was fifty, according to another sixty-seven, when
  he became acquainted with Prince Hohenlohe. This peasant was unquestionably a
  devout, guileless man. He had been afflicted in youth with a rupture, but, in
  answer to continuous and earnest prayer, he asserted that he had been
  completely healed. Then, for some while he prayed over other afflicted
  persons, and it was rumoured that he had effected several miraculous cures.
  He emphatically and earnestly repudiated every claim to superior sanctity.
  The cures, he declared, depended on the faith of the patient, and on the
  power of the Almighty. The most solemn promises had been made in the gospel
  to those who asked in faith, and all he did was to act upon these evangelical
  promises.</p>

  <p>The Government speedily interfered, and Michel was forbidden by the police
  to work any more miracles by prayer or faith, or any other means except the
  recognised pharmacopoeia.</p>

  <p>He had received no payment for his cures in money or in kind, but he took
  occasion through them to impress on his patients the duty of prayer, and the
  efficacy of faith.</p>

  <p>By some means he met Prince Alexander Hohenlohe, and the prince was
  interested and excited by what he heard, and by the apparent sincerity of the
  man. A few days later the prince was in Würzburg, where he called on the
  Princess Mathilde Schwarzenberg, a young girl of seventeen who was a cripple,
  and who had already spent a year and a half at Würzburg, under the hands of
  the orthopædic physician Heine, and the surgeon Textor. She had been to the
  best medical men in Vienna and Paris, and the case had been given up as
  hopeless. Then Prince Schwarzenberg placed her under the treatment of Heine.
  She was so contracted, with her knees drawn up to her body, that she could
  neither stand nor walk.</p>

  <p>Prince Hohenlohe first met her at dinner, on June 18, 1821, and the sight
  of her distortion filled him with pity. He thought over her case, and
  communicated with Michel, who at his summons came to Würzburg. As Würzburg is
  in Bavaria, the orders of the Baden Government did not extend to it, and the
  peasant might freely conduct his experiments there.</p>

  <p>Prince Alexander called on the Princess at ten o'clock in the morning of
  June 20, taking with him Michel, but leaving him outside the house, in the
  court. Then Prince Hohenlohe began to speak to the suffering girl of the
  power of faith, and mentioned the wonders wrought by the prayers of Michel.
  She became interested, and the Prince asked her if she would like to put the
  powers of Michel to the test, warning her that the man could do nothing
  unless she had full and perfect belief in the mercy of God. The Princess
  expressed her eagerness to try the new remedy and assured her interrogator
  that she had the requisite faith. Thereupon he went to the window, and signed
  to the peasant to come up.</p>

  <p>What follows shall be given in the Princess's own words, from her account
  written a day or two later:&mdash;"The peasant knelt down and prayed in
  German aloud and distinctly, and, after his prayer, he said to me, 'In the
  Name of Jesus, stand up. You are whole, and can both stand and walk!' The
  peasant and the Prince then went into an adjoining room, and I rose from my
  couch, without assistance, in the name of God, well and sound, and so I have
  continued to this moment."</p>

  <p>A much fuller and minuter account of the proceedings was published,
  probably from the pen of the governess, who was present at the time; but as
  it is anonymous we need not concern ourselves with it.</p>

  <p>The news of the miraculous recovery spread through the town; Dr. Heine
  heard of it, and ran to the house, and stood silent and amazed at what he
  saw. The Princess descended the stone staircase towards the garden, but
  hesitated, and, instead of going into the garden, returned upstairs, leaning
  on the arm of Prince Hohenlohe.</p>

  <p>Next day was Corpus Christi. The excitement in the town was immense, when
  the poor cripple, who had been seen for more than a year carried into her
  carriage and carried out of it into church, walked to church, and thence
  strolled into the gardens of the palace.</p>

  <p>On the following day she visited the Julius Hospital, a noble institution
  founded by one of the bishops of Würzburg. On the 24th she called on the
  Princess Lichtenstein, the Duke of Aremberg, and the Prince of Baar, and
  moreover, attended a sermon preached by Prince Hohenlohe in the Haugh parish
  church. Her recovery was complete.</p>

  <p>Now, at first sight, nothing seems more satisfactorily established than
  this miracle. Let us, however, see what Dr. Heine, who had attended her for
  nineteen months, had to say on it. We cannot quote his account in its
  entirety, as it is long, but we will take the principal points in
  it:&mdash;"The Princess of Schwarzenberg came under my treatment at the end
  of October, 1819, afflicted with several abnormities of the thorax, with a
  twisted spine, ribs, &amp;c. Moreover, she could not rise to her feet from a
  sitting posture, nor endure to be so raised; but this was not in consequence
  of malformation or weakness of the system, for when sitting or lying down she
  could freely move her limbs. She complained of acute pain when placed in any
  other position, and when she was made to assume an angle of 100° her agony
  became so intense that her extremities were in a nervous quiver, and partial
  paralysis ensued, which, however, ceased when she was restored to her
  habitual contracted position.</p>

  <p>"The Princess lost her power of locomotion when she was three years old,
  and the contraction was the result of abscesses on the loins. She was taken
  to France and Italy, and got so far in Paris as to be able to hop about a
  room supported on crutches. But she suffered a relapse on her return to
  Vienna in 1813, and thenceforth was able neither to stand nor to move about.
  She was placed in my hands, and I contrived an apparatus by which the angle
  at which she rested was gradually extended, and her position gradually
  changed from horizontal to vertical. At the same time I manipulated her
  almost daily, and had the satisfaction by the end of last April to see her
  occupy an angle of 50°, without complaining of suffering. By the close of May
  further advance was made, and she was able to assume a vertical position,
  with her feet resting on the ground, but with her body supported, and to
  remain in this position for four or five hours. Moreover, in this situation I
  made her go through all the motions of walking. The extremities had, in every
  position, retained their natural muscular powers and movements, and the
  contraction was simply a nervous affection. I made no attempt to force her to
  walk unsupported, because I would not do this till I was well assured such a
  trial would not be injurious to her.</p>

  <p>"On the 30th of May I revisited her, after having been unable, on account
  of a slight indisposition, to see my patients for several days. Her governess
  then told me that the Princess had made great progress. She lay at an angle
  of 80°. The governess placed herself at the foot of the couch, held out her
  hands to the Princess, and drew her up into an upright position, and she told
  me that this had been done several times of late during my enforced absence.
  Whilst she was thus standing I made the Princess raise and depress her feet,
  and go through all the motions of walking. Immediately on my return home I
  set to work to construct a machine which might enable her to walk without
  risk of a fall and of hurting herself. On the 19th of June, in the evening, I
  told the Princess that the apparatus was nearly finished. Next day, a little
  after 10 A.M., I visited her. When I opened her door she rose up from a chair
  in which she was seated, and came towards me with short, somewhat uncertain
  steps. I bowed myself, in token of joy and thanks to God.</p>

  <p>"At that moment a gentleman I had never seen before entered the room and
  exclaimed, 'Mathilde! you have had faith in God!' The Princess replied, 'I
  have had, and I have now, entire faith.' The gentleman said, 'Your faith has
  saved and healed you. God has succoured you.' Then I began to suspect that
  some strange influence was at work, and that something had been going on of
  which I was not cognizant. I asked the gentleman what was the meaning of
  this. He raised his right hand to heaven, and replied that he had prayed and
  thought of the Princess that morning at mass, and that Prince Wallerstein was
  privy to the whole proceeding. I was puzzled and amazed. Then I asked the
  Princess to walk again. She did so, and shortly after I left, and only then
  did I learn that the stranger was the Prince of Hohenlohe.</p>

  <p>"Next month, on July 21, her aunt, the Princess Eleanor of Schwarzenberg,
  came with three of the sisters of Princess Mathilde to fetch her away and to
  take her back to her father. Her Highness did me the honour of visiting me
  along with the Princesses on the second day after their arrival, to thank me
  for the pains I had taken to cure the Princess Mathilde. Before they left,
  Dr. Schäfer, who had attended her at Ratisbon, Herr Textor, and myself were
  allowed to examine the Princess. Dr. Schäfer found that the condition of the
  thorax was mightily improved since she had been in my hands. I, however, saw
  that her condition had retrograded since I had last seen her on June 20, and
  it was agreed that the Princess was to occupy her extension-couch at night,
  and by day wear the steel apparatus for support I had contrived for her. At
  the same time Dr. Schäfer distinctly assured her and the Princess, her aunt,
  that under my management the patient had recovered the power of walking
  <i>before</i> the 19th of June."</p>

  <p>This account puts a different complexion on the cure, and shows that it
  was not in any way miraculous. The Prince and the peasant stepped in and
  snatched the credit of having cured the Princess from the doctor, to whom it
  rightly belonged.</p>

  <p>Before we proceed, it will be well to say a few words about this Prince
  Alexander Hohenlohe. The Hohenlohe family takes its name from a bare elevated
  plateau in Franconia. About the beginning of the 16th century it broke into
  two branches; the elder is Hohenlohe-Neuenstein, the younger is
  Hohenlohe-Waldenburg.</p>

  <p>The elder branch has its sub-ramifications&mdash;Hohenlohe-Langenburg,
  which possesses also the county of Gleichen; and the Hohenlohe-Oehringen and
  the Hohenlohe-Kirchberg sub-branches. The second main branch of
  Hohenlohe-Waldenburg has also its lateral branches, as those of
  Hohenlohe-Bartenstein and Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst; the last of these being
  Catholic.</p>

  <p>Prince Leopold Alexander was born in 1794 at Kupferzell, near Waldenburg,
  and was the eighteenth child of Prince Karl Albrecht and his wife Judith,
  Baroness Reviczky. His father never became reigning prince, from intellectual
  incapacity, and Alexander lost him when he was one year old. He was educated
  for the Church by the ex-Jesuit Riel, and went to school first in Vienna,
  then at Berne; in 1810 he entered the Episcopal seminary at Vienna, and
  finished his theological studies at Ellwangen in 1814. He was ordained priest
  in 1816, and went to Rome.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wolff, the father of Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, in his "Travels and
  Adventures," which is really his autobiography, says (vol i. p.
  31):&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wolff left the house of Count Stolberg on the 3rd April, 1815, and went
  to Ellwangen, and there met again an old pupil from Vienna, Prince Alexander
  Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, afterwards so celebrated for his miracles&mdash;to
  which so many men of the highest rank and intelligence have borne witness
  that Wolff dares not give a decided opinion about them. But Niebuhr relates
  that the Pope said to him himself, speaking about Hohenlohe in a sneering
  manner, '<i>Questo</i> far dei miracoli!' <i>This</i> fellow performing
  miracles!</p>

  <p>"It may be best to offer some slight sketch of Hohenlohe's life. His
  person was beautiful. He was placed under the direction of Vock, the Roman
  Catholic parish priest at Berne. One Sunday he was invited to dinner with
  Vock, his tutor, at the Spanish ambassador's. The next day there was a great
  noise in the Spanish embassy, because the mass-robe, with the silver chalice
  and all its appurtenances, had been stolen. It was advertised in the paper,
  but nothing could be discovered, until Vock took Prince Hohenlohe aside, and
  said to him, 'Prince, confess to me; have you not stolen the mass-robe?' He
  at once confessed it, and said that he made use of it every morning in
  practising the celebration of the mass in his room; which was true." (This
  was when Hohenlohe was twenty-one years old.) "He was afterwards sent to
  Tyrnau, to the ecclesiastical seminary in Hungary, whence he was expelled, on
  account of levity. But, being a Prince, the Chapter of Olmütz, in Moravia,
  elected him titulary canon of the cathedral; nevertheless, the Emperor
  Francis was too honest to confirm it. Wolff taught him Hebrew in Vienna. He
  had but little talent for languages, but his conversation on religion was
  sometimes very charming; and at other times he broke out into most indecent
  discourses. He was ordained priest, and Sailer[16] preached a sermon on the
  day of his ordination, which was published under the title of 'The Priest
  without Reproach.' On the same day money was collected for building a Roman
  Catholic Church at Zürich, and the money collected was given to Prince
  Hohenlohe, to be remitted to the parish priest of Zürich (Moritz Mayer); but
  the money never reached its destination. Wolff saw him once at the bed of the
  sick and dying, and his discourse, exhortations, and treatment of these sick
  people were wonderfully beautiful. When he mounted the pulpit to preach, one
  imagined one saw a saint of the Middle Ages. His devotion was penetrating,
  and commanded silence in a church where there were 4,000 people collected.
  Wolff one day called on him, when Hohenlohe said to him, 'I never read any
  other book than the Bible. I never look in a sermon-book by anybody else, not
  even at the sermons of Sailer.' But Wolff after this heard him preach, and
  the whole sermon was copied from one of Sailer's, which Wolff had read only
  the day before.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[16] Johann M. Sailer was a famous ex-Jesuit preacher, at
  this time Professor at the University of Landshut, afterwards Bishop of
  Ratisbon. He died, 1832.</p>

  <p>"With all his faults, Hohenlohe cannot be charged with avarice, for he
  give away every farthing he got, perhaps even that which he obtained
  dishonestly. They afterwards met at Rome, where Hohenlohe lodged with the
  Jesuits, and there it was said he composed a Latin poem. Wolff, knowing his
  incapacity to do such a thing, asked him boldly, 'Who is the author of this
  poem?' Hohenlohe confessed at once that it was written by a Jesuit priest. At
  that time Madame Schlegel wrote to Wolff: 'Prince Hohenlohe is a man who
  struggles with heaven and hell, and heaven will gain the victory with him.'
  Hohenlohe was on the point of being made a bishop at Rome, but, on the
  strength of his previous knowledge of him, Wolff protested against his
  consecration. Several princes, amongst them Kaunitz, the ambassador, took
  Hohenlohe's part on this occasion; but the matter was investigated, and
  Hohenlohe walked off from Rome without being made a bishop. In his protest
  against the man, Wolff stated that Hohenlohe's pretensions to being a canon
  of Olmütz were false; that he had been expelled the seminary of Tyrnau; that
  he sometimes spoke like a saint, and at others like a profligate."</p>

  <p>And now let us return to Würzburg, and see the result of the cure of
  Princess Schwarzenberg. The people who had seen the poor cripple one day
  carried into her carriage and into church, and a day or two after saw her
  walk to church and in the gardens, and who knew nothing of Dr. Heine's
  operations, concluded that this was a miracle, and gave the credit of it
  quite as much to Prince Hohenlohe as to the peasant Michel.</p>

  <p>The police at once sent an official letter to the Prince, requesting to be
  informed authoritatively what he had done, by what right he had interfered,
  and how he had acted. He replied that he had done nothing, faith and the
  Almighty had wrought the miracle. "The instantaneous cure of the Princess is
  a <i>fact</i>, which cannot be disputed; it was the result of a living faith.
  That is the truth. It happened to the Princess according to her faith." The
  peasant Michel now fell into the background, and was forgotten, and the
  Prince stood forward as the worker of miraculous cures. Immense excitement
  was caused by the restoration of the Princess Schwarzenberg, and patients
  streamed into Würzburg from all the country round, seeking health at the
  hands of Prince Alexander. The local papers published marvellous details of
  his successful cures. The blind saw, the lame walked, the deaf heard. Among
  the deaf who recovered was His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Bavaria,
  three years later King Ludwig I., grandfather of the late King of Bavaria.
  Unfortunately we have not exact details of this cure, but a letter of the
  Crown Prince written shortly after merely states that he heard
  <i>better</i>than before. Now the spring of 1821 was very raw and wet, and
  about June 20 there set in some dry hot weather. It is therefore quite
  possible that the change of weather may have had to do with this cure.
  However, we can say nothing for certain about it, as no data were published,
  merely the announcement that the Crown Prince had recovered his hearing at
  the prayer of Prince Hohenlohe. Here are some better-authenticated cases, as
  given by Herr Scharold, an eye-witness; he was city councillor and
  secretary.</p>

  <p>"The Prince had dined at midday with General von D&mdash;&mdash;. All the
  entrances to the house from two streets were blocked by hundreds of persons,
  and they said that he had already healed four individuals crippled with
  rheumatism in this house. I convinced myself on the spot that one of these
  cases was as said. The patient was the young wife of a fisherman, who was
  crippled in the right hand, so that she could not lift anything with it, or
  use it in any way; and all at once she was enabled to raise a heavy chair,
  with the hand hitherto powerless, and hold it aloft. She went home weeping
  tears of joy and thankfulness.</p>

  <p>"The Prince was then entreated to go to another house, at another end of
  the town, and he consented. There he found many paralysed persons. He began
  with a poor man whose left arm was quite useless and stiff. After he had
  asked him if he had perfect faith, and had received a satisfactory answer,
  the Prince prayed with folded hands and closed eyes. Then he raised the
  kneeling patient; and said, 'Move your arm.' Weeping and trembling in all his
  limbs the man did as he was bid; but as he said that he obeyed with
  difficulty, the Prince prayed again, and said, 'Now move your arm again.'
  This time the man easily moved his arm forwards, backwards, and raised it.
  The cure was complete. Equally successful was he with the next two cases. One
  was a tailor's wife, named Lanzamer. 'What do you want?' asked the Prince,
  who was bathed in perspiration. Answer: 'I have had a paralytic stroke, and
  have lost the use of one side of my body, so that I cannot walk unsupported.'
  'Kneel down!' But this could only be effected with difficulty, and it was
  rather a tumbling down of an inert body, painful to behold. I never saw a
  face more full of expression of faith in the strongly marked features. The
  Prince, deeply moved, prayed with great fervour, and then said, 'Stand up!'
  The good woman, much agitated, was unable to do so, in spite of all her
  efforts, without the assistance of her boy, who was by her, crying, and then
  her lame leg seemed to crack. When she had reached her feet, he said, 'Now
  walk the length of the room without pain.' She tried to do so, but succeeded
  with difficulty, yet with only a little suffering. Again he prayed, and the
  healing was complete; she walked lightly and painlessly up and down, and
  finally out of the room; and the boy, crying more than before, but now with
  joy, exclaimed, 'O my God! mother can walk, mother can walk!' Whilst this was
  going on, an old woman, called Siebert, wife of a bookbinder, who had been
  brought in a sedan-chair, was admitted to the room. She suffered from
  paralysis and incessant headaches that left her neither night nor day. The
  first attempt made to heal her failed. The second only brought on the
  paroxysm of headache worse than ever, so that the poor creature could hardly
  keep her feet or open her eyes. The Prince began to doubt her faith, but when
  she assured him of it, he prayed again with redoubled earnestness. And, all
  at once, she was cured. This woman left the room, conducted by her daughter,
  and all present were filled with astonishment." This account was written on
  June 26. On June 28 Herr Scharold wrote a further account of other cures he
  had witnessed; but those already given are sufficient. That this witness was
  convinced and sincere appears from his description, but how far valuable his
  evidence is we are not so well assured.</p>

  <p>A curious little pamphlet was published the same year at Darmstadt,
  entitled, "Das Mährchen vom Wunder," that professed to be the result of the
  observations of a medical man who attended one or two of these
  <i>séances</i>. Unfortunately the pamphlet is anonymous, and this deprives it
  of most of its authority. Another writer who attacked the genuineness of the
  miracles was Dr. Paulus, in his "Quintessenz aus den Wundercurversuchen durch
  Michel und Hohenlohe," Leipzig, 1822; but this author also wrote anonymously,
  and did not profess to have seen any of the cures. On the other hand,
  Scharold and a Dr. Onymus, and two or three priests published their
  testimonies as witnesses to their genuineness, and gave the names and
  particulars of those cured.</p>

  <p>Those who assailed the Prince and his cures dipped their pens in gall. It
  is only just to add that they cast on his character none of the reflections
  for honesty which Dr. Wolff flung on him.</p>

  <p>The author of the Darmstadt pamphlet, mentioned above, says that when he
  was present the Prince was attended by two sergeants of police, as the crowd
  thronging on him was so great that he needed protection from its pressure. He
  speaks sneeringly of him as spending his time in eating, smoking, and
  miracle-working, when not sleeping, and says he was plump and good-
  looking.</p>

  <p class="quote">"A girl of eighteen, who was paralysed in her limbs, was
  brought from a carriage to the feet of the prophet. After he had asked her if
  she believed, and he had prayed for about twelve seconds, he exclaimed in a
  threatening rather than gentle voice, 'You are healed!' But I observed that
  he had to thunder this thrice into the ear of the frightened girl, before she
  made an effort to move, which was painful and distressing; and, groaning and
  supported by others, she made her way to the rear. 'You will be better
  shortly&mdash;only believe!' he cried to her. I, who was looking on, observed
  her conveyed away as much a cripple as she came.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The next case was a peasant of fifty-eight, a cripple on
  crutches. Without his crutches he was doubled up, and could only shuffle with
  his feet on the ground. After the Prince had asked the usual questions and
  had prayed, he ordered the kneeling man to stand up, his crutches having been
  removed. As he was unable to do so, the miracle-worker seemed irritated, and
  repeated his order in an angry tone. One of the policemen at the side threw
  in 'Up! in the name of the Trinity,' and pulled him to his feet. The man
  seemed bewildered. He stood, indeed, but doubled as before, and the sweat
  streamed from his face, and he was not a ha'porth better than previously; but
  as he had come with crutches, and now stood without them, there arose a shout
  of 'A miracle!' and all pressed round to congratulate the poor wretch. His
  son helped him away. 'Have faith and courage!' cried to him the Prince; and
  the policeman added, 'Only believe, and rub in a little spirits of camphor!'
  Many pressed alms into the man's hand, and he smiled; this was regarded as a
  token of his perfect cure. I saw, however, that his knees were as stiff as
  before, and that the rogue cast longing eyes at his crutches, which had been
  taken away, but which he insisted on having back. No one thought of asking
  how it fared with the poor wretch later, and, as a fact, he died shortly
  after.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The next to come up was a deaf girl of eighteen. The
  wonder-worker was bathed in perspiration, and evidently exhausted with his
  continuous prayer night and day. After a few questions as to the duration of
  her infirmity, the Prince prayed, then signed a cross over the girl, and,
  stepping back from her, asked her questions, at each in succession somewhat
  lowering his tone; but she only heard those spoken as loudly as before the
  experiment was made, and she remained for the most part staring stupidly at
  the wonder-worker. To cut the matter short, he declared her healed. I took
  the mother aside soon after, and inquired what was the result. She assured me
  that the girl heard no better than before.</p>

  <p class="quote">"In her place came a stone-deaf man of twenty-five. The
  result was very similar; but as the Prince, when bidding him depart healed,
  made a sign of withdrawal with his hand, the man rose and departed, and this
  was taken as evidence that he had heard the command addressed to
  him."</p><br>

  <p>The author gives other cases that he witnessed, not one of which was other
  than a failure, though they were all declared to be cures.</p>

  <p>On June 29 the Prince practised his miracle-working at the palace, in the
  presence of the Crown Prince and of Prince Esterhazy, the Austrian ambassador
  who was on his way to London to attend the coronation of George IV. in July.
  The attempts were probably as great failures as those described in the
  Darmstadt pamphlet. The Prince was somewhat discouraged at the invitation of
  the physicians attached to the Julius Hospital; he had visited that
  institution the day before, and had experimented on twenty cases, and was
  unsuccessful in every one. Full particulars of these were published in the
  "Bamberger Briefe," Nos. 28-33. We will give only a very few:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"1. Barbara Uhlen, of Oberschleichach, aged 39, suffering
  from dropsy. The Prince said to her, 'Do you sincerely believe that you can
  be helped and are helped?' The sick woman replied, 'Yes. I had resolved to
  leave the hospital, where no good has been done to me, and to seek health
  from God and the Prince.' He raised his eyes to heaven and prayed; then
  assured the patient of her cure. Her case became worse rapidly, instead of
  better.</p>

  <p class="quote">"7. Margaretta Löhlein, of Randersacher, aged 56. Suffering
  from dropsy owing to disorganisation of the liver. Another failure. Shortly
  after the Prince left, she had to be operated on to save her from
  suffocation.</p>

  <p class="quote">"10. Susanna Söllnerin, servant maid of Aub, aged 22, had
  already been thirteen weeks in hospital, suffering from roaring noises in the
  head and deafness. The Prince, observing the fervour of her faith, cried out,
  'You shall see now how speedily she will be cured!' Prayers, blessing, as
  before, and&mdash;as before, no results.</p>

  <p class="quote">"11. George Forchheimer, butcher, suffering from rheumatism.
  One foot is immovable, and he can only walk with the assistance of a stick.
  During the prayer of the Prince the patient wept and sobbed, and was
  profoundly agitated. The Prince ordered him to stand up and go without his
  stick. His efforts to obey were unavailing; he fell several times on the
  ground, though the Prince repeated over him his prayers."</p><br>

  <p>These are sufficient as instances; not a single case in the hospital was
  more successfully treated by him.</p>

  <p>On July 5 Prince Hohenlohe went to Bamberg, where he was eagerly awaited
  by many sick and credulous persons. The Burgomaster Hornthal, however,
  interfered, and forbade the attempt at performing miracles till the
  authorities at Baireuth had been instructed of his arrival, and till a
  commission had been appointed of men of judgment, and physicians to take note
  of the previous condition of every patient who was submitted to him, and of
  the subsequent condition. Thus hampered the Prince could do nothing; he
  failed as signally as in the Julius Hospital at Würzburg, and the only cases
  of cures claimed to have been wrought were among a mixed crowd in the street
  to whom he gave a blessing from the balcony of his lodging.</p>

  <p>Finding that Bamberg was uncongenial, he accepted a call to the Baths of
  Brückenau, and thence news reached the incredulous of Bamberg and Würzburg
  that extraordinary cures had been wrought at the prayers of the Prince. As,
  however, we have no details respecting these, we may pass them over.</p>

  <p>Hohenlohe, who had no notion of hiding his light under a bushel, drew up a
  detailed account of over a hundred cures which he claimed to have worked, had
  them attested by witnesses, and sent this precious document to the Pope, who,
  with good sense, took no notice of it; at least no public notice, though it
  is probable that he administered a sharp private reprimand, for Hohenlohe
  collapsed very speedily.</p>

  <p>From Brückenau the Prince went to Vienna, but was not favourably received
  there, so he departed to Hungary, where his mother's relations lived. Though
  he was applied to by sick people who had heard of his fame, he did not make
  any more direct attempts to heal them. He, however, gave them cards on which
  a day and hour were fixed, and a prayer written, and exhorted them to pray
  for recovery earnestly on the day and at the hour indicated, and promised to
  pray for them at the same time. But this was also discontinued, having proved
  inefficacious, and Hohenlohe relapsed into a quiet unostentatious life. He
  was appointed, through family interest, Canon of Grosswardein, and in 1829
  advanced to be Provost of the Cathedral. His powers as a preacher long
  survived his powers of working miracles. He spent his time in good works, and
  in writing little manuals of devotion. In 1844 he was consecrated titular
  Bishop of Sardica <i>in partibus</i>, that is, without a See. He died at
  Vöslau, near Vienna, in 1849. That Hohenlohe was a conscious hypocrite we are
  far from supposing. He was clearly a man of small mental powers, very
  conceited, and wanting in judgment. We must not place too much reliance on
  the scandalous gossip of Dr. Wolff. Probably Hohenlohe's vanity received a
  severe check in 1821, when both the Roman See and the world united to
  discredit his miracles; and he had sufficient good sense to accept the
  verdict.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE SNAIL-TELEGRAPH</h2>

  <p class="first">THE writer well remembers, as a child, the sense of awe not
  unmixed with fear, with which he observed the mysterious movements of the
  telegraph erected on church towers in France along all the main roads.</p>

  <p>Many a beautiful tower was spoiled by these abominable erections. There
  were huge arms like those of a windmill, painted black, and jointed, so as to
  describe a great number of cabalistic signs in the air. Indeed, the movements
  were like the writhings of some monstrous spider.</p>

  <p>Glanvil who wrote in the middle of the 17th century says, "To those that
  come after us, it may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly into the
  remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey. <i>And to confer,
  at the distance of the Indies, by sympathetic conveyances</i>, may be as
  usual to future times as to us is literary correspondence." He further
  remarks, "Antiquity would not have believed the almost incredible force of
  our cannons, and would as coldly have entertained the wonders of the
  telescope. In these we all condemn antique incredulity. And it is likely
  posterity will have as much cause to pity ours. But those who are acquainted
  with the diligent and ingenious endeavours of true philosophers will despair
  of nothing."</p>

  <p>In 1633 the Marquis of Worcester suggested a scheme of telegraphing by
  means of signs. Another, but similar scheme, was mooted in 1660 by the
  Frenchman Amonton. In 1763 Mr. Edgeworth erected for his private use a
  telegraph between London and Newmarket. But it was in 1789 that the Optical
  Telegraph came into practical use in France&mdash;Claude Chappe was the
  inventor. When he was a boy, he contrived a means of communication by signals
  with his brothers at a distance of two or three miles. He laid down the first
  line between Lille and Paris at a cost of about two thousand pounds, and the
  first message sent along it was the announcement of the capture of Lille by
  Condé. This led to the construction of many similar lines communicating with
  each other by means of stations. Some idea of the celerity with which
  messages were sent may be gained from the fact that it took only two minutes
  to reproduce in Paris a sign given in Lille at a distance of 140 miles. On
  this line there were 22 stations. The objections to this system lay in its
  being useless at night and in rainy weather. The French system of telegraph
  consisted of one main beam&mdash;the regulator, at the end of which were two
  shorter wings, so that it formed a letter Z. The regulator and its flags
  could be turned about in various ways, making in all 196 signs. Sometimes the
  regulator stood horizontally, sometimes perpendicularly.</p>

  <p>Lord Murray introduced one of a different construction in England in 1795
  consisting of two rows of three octangular flags revolving on their axis.
  This gave 64 different signs, but was defective in the same point as that of
  Chappe. Poor Chappe was so troubled in mind because his claim to be the
  inventor of his telegraph was disputed, that he drowned himself in a well,
  1805.</p>

  <p>Besides the fact that the optical telegraph was paralysed by darkness and
  storm, it was very difficult to manage in mountainous and well-wooded
  country, and required there a great number of stations.</p>

  <p>After that Sömmering had discovered at Munich in 1808 the means of
  signalling through the galvanic current obtained by decomposition of water,
  and Schilling at Canstadt and Ampère in Paris (1820) had made further
  advances in the science of electrology, and Oersted had established the
  deflexion of the magnetic needle, it was felt that the day of the cumbrous
  and disfiguring optical telegraph was over. A new power had been discovered,
  though the extent and the applicability of this power were not known. Gauss
  and Weber in 1833 made the first attempt to set up an electric telegraph; in
  1837 Wheatstone and Morse utilised the needle and made the telegraph print
  its messages. In 1833 the telegraph of Gauss and Weber supplanted the optical
  contrivance on the line between Trèves and Berlin. The first line in America
  was laid from Washington to Baltimore in 1844. The first attempt at submarine
  telegraphy was made at Portsmouth in 1846, and in 1850 a cable was laid
  between England and France.</p>

  <p>It was precisely in this year when men's minds were excited over the
  wonderful powers of the galvanic current, and a wide prospect was opened of
  its future advantage to men, when, indeed, the general public understood very
  little about the principle and were in a condition of mind to accept almost
  any scientific marvel, that there appeared in Paris an adventurer, who
  undertook to open communications between all parts of the world without the
  expense and difficulty of laying cables of communication. The line laid
  across the channel in 1850 was not very successful; it broke several times,
  and had to be taken up again, and relaid in 1851. If it did not answer in
  conveying messages across so narrow a strip of water, was it likely to be
  utilized for Transatlantic telegraphy? The <i>Presse</i>, a respectable Paris
  paper, conducted by a journalist of note, M. de Girardin, answered
  emphatically, No. The means of communication was not to be sought in a chain.
  The gutta percha casing would decompose under the sea, and when the brine
  touched the wires, the cable would be useless. The Chappe telegraph was
  superseded by the electric telegraph which answered well on dry land, but
  fatal objections stood in the way of its answering for communication between
  places divided by belts of sea or oceans. Moreover, it was an intricate
  system. Now the tendency of science in modern times was towards
  simplification; and it was always found that the key to unlock difficulties
  which had puzzled the inventors of the past, lay at their hands. The electric
  telegraph was certainly more elaborate, complicated and expensive than the
  optical telegraph. Was it such a decided advance on it? Yes&mdash;in one way.
  It could be worked at all hours of night and day. But had the last word in
  telegraphy been spoken, when it was invented? Most assuredly not.</p>

  <p>Along with electricity and terrestrial magnetism, another power, vaguely
  perceived, the full utility of which was also unknown, had been
  recognised&mdash;animal magnetism. Why should not this force be used as a
  means for the conveyance of messages?</p>

  <p>M. Jules Allix after a long preamble in <i>La Presse</i>, in an article
  signed by himself, announced that a French inventor, M. Jacques Toussaint
  Benoît (de l'Hérault), and a fellow worker of Gallic origin, living in
  America, M. Biat-Chrétien, had hit on "a new system of universal
  intercommunication of thought, which operates instantaneously."</p>

  <p>After a long introduction in true French rhodomontade, tracing the
  progress of humanity from the publication of the Gospel to the 19th century,
  M. Allix continued, "The discovery of MM. Benoît and Biat depends on
  galvanism, terrestrial and animal magnetism, also on natural sympathy, that
  is to say, the base of communication is a sort of special sympathetic fluid
  which is composed of the union or blending of the galvanic, magnetic and
  sympathetic currents, by a process to be described shortly. And as the
  various fluids vary according to the organic or inorganic bodies whence they
  are derived, it is necessary further to state that the forces or fluids here
  married are: (<i>a</i>) The terrestrial-galvanic current, (<i>b</i>) the
  animal-sympathetic current, in this case derived from <i>snails</i>,
  (<i>c</i>) the adamic or human current, or animal-magnetic current in man.
  Consequently, to describe concisely the basis of the new system of
  intercommunication, we shall have to call the force, '<i>The
  galvano-terrestrial-magnetic-animal and adamic force!</i>'" Is not this
  something like a piece of Jules Verne's delicious scientific
  <i>hocus-pocus</i>? Will the reader believe that it was written in good
  faith? It was, there can be no question, written in perfect good faith. The
  character of <i>La Presse</i>, of the journalist, M. Jules Allix, would not
  allow of a hoax wilfully perpetrated on the public. We are quoting from the
  number for October 27th, 1850, of the paper.</p>

  <p class="quote">"According to the experiments made by MM. Benoît and Biat,
  it seems that snails which have once been put in contact, are always in
  sympathetic communication. When separated, there disengages itself from them
  a species of fluid of which the earth is the conductor, which develops and
  unrolls, so to speak, like the almost invisible thread of the spider, or that
  of the silk worm, which can be uncoiled and prolonged almost indefinitely in
  space without its breaking, but with this vital difference that the thread of
  the escargotic fluid is invisible as completely and the pulsation along it is
  as rapid as the electric fluid.</p>

  <p class="quote">"But, it may be objected with some plausibility, granted the
  existence in the snails of this sympathetic fluid, will it radiate from them
  in all directions, after the analogy of electric, galvanic and magnetic
  fluids, unless there be some conductor established between them? At first
  sight, this objection has some weight, but for all that it is more specious
  than serious."</p><br>

  <p>The solution of this difficulty is exquisitely absurd. We must
  summarise.</p>

  <p>At first the discoverers of the galvanic current thought it necessary to
  establish a return wire, to complete the circle, till it was found to be
  sufficient to carry the two ends of the wire in communication with the earth,
  when the earth itself completed the circle. There is no visible line between
  the ends underground, yet the current completes the circle through it.
  Moreover, it is impossible to think of two points without establishing, in
  idea, a line between them, indeed, according to Euclid's definition, a
  straight line is that which lies evenly between its extreme points, and a
  line is length without breadth or substance. So, if we conceive of two
  snails, we establish a line between them, an unsubstantial line, still a line
  along which the sympathetic current can travel. "Now MM. Benoît and Biat, by
  means of balloons in the atmosphere," had established beyond doubt that a
  visible tangible line of communication was only necessary when raised above
  the earth.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Consequently, there remains nothing more to be considered
  than the means, the apparatus, whereby the transmission of thought is
  effected.</p>

  <p class="quote">"This apparatus consists of a square box, in which is a
  Voltaic pile, of which the metallic plates, instead of being superposed, as
  in the pile of Volta, are disposed in order, attached in holes formed in a
  wheel or circular disc, that revolves about a steel axis. To these metallic
  plates used by Volta, MM. Benoît and Biat have substituted others in the
  shape of cups or circular basins, composed of zinc lined with cloth steeped
  in a solution of sulphate of copper maintained in place by a blade of copper
  riveted to the cup. At the bottom of each of these bowls, is fixed, by aid of
  a composition that shall be given presently, a living snail, whose
  sympathetic influence may unite and be woven with the galvanic current, when
  the wheel of the pile is set in motion and with it the snails that are
  adhering to it.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Each galvanic basin rests on a delicate spring, so that it
  may respond to every escargotic commotion. Now; it is obvious that such an
  apparatus requires a corresponding apparatus, disposed as has been described,
  and containing in it snails in sympathy with those in the other apparatus, so
  that the escargotic vibration may pass from one precise point in one of the
  piles to a precise point in the other and complementary pile. When these
  dispositions have been grasped the rest follows as a matter of course. MM.
  Benoît and Biat have fixed letters to the wheels, corresponding the one with
  the other, and at each sympathetic touch on one, the other is touched;
  consequently it is easy by this means, naturally and instantaneously, to
  communicate ideas at vast distances, by the indication of the letters touched
  by the snails. The apparatus described is in shape like a mariner's compass,
  and to distinguish it from that, it is termed the
  <i>pasilalinic&mdash;sympathetic compass</i>, as descriptive at once of its
  effects and the means of operation."</p><br>

  <p>But, who were these inventors, Benoît and Biat-Chrétien? We will begin
  with the latter. As Pontoppidon in his History of Norway heads a chapter, "Of
  Snakes," and says, "Of these there are none," so we may say of M.
  Biat-Chrétien; there was no such man; at least he never rose to the surface
  and was seen. Apparently his existence was as much a hallucination or
  creation of the fancy of M. Benoît, as was Mrs. Harris a creature of the
  imagination of Mrs. Betsy Gamp. Certainly no Biat-Chrétien was known in
  America as a discoverer.</p>

  <p>Jacques Toussaint Benoît (de l'Hérault) was a man who had been devoted
  since his youth to the secret sciences. His studies in magic and astrology,
  in mesmerism, and electricity, had turned his head. Together with real
  eagerness to pursue his studies, and real belief in them, was added a certain
  spice of rascality.</p>

  <p>One day Benoît, who had by some means made the acquaintance of M. Triat,
  founder and manager of a gymnasium in Paris for athletic exercises, came to
  Triat, and told him that he had made a discovery which would supersede
  electric telegraphy. The director was a man of common sense, but not of much
  education, certainly of no scientific acquirements. He was, therefore, quite
  unable to distinguish between true and false science. Benoît spoke with
  conviction, and carried away his hearer with his enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"What is needed for the construction of the machine?" asked M. Triat.</p>

  <p>"Only two or three bits of wood," replied Benoît.</p>

  <p>M. Triat took him into his carpenter's shop. "There, my friend," he said,
  "here you have wood, and a man to help you."</p>

  <p>M. Triat did more. The future inventor of the instantaneous communication
  of thought was house-less and hungry. The manager rented a lodging for him,
  and advanced him money for his entertainment. Benoît set to work. He used a
  great many bits of wood, and occupied the carpenter a good part of his time.
  Other things became necessary as well as wood, things that cost money, and
  the money was found by M. Triat. So passed a twelvemonth. At the end of that
  time, which had been spent at the cost of his protector, Benoît had arrived
  at no result. It was apparent that, in applying to M. Triat, he had sought,
  not so much to construct a machine already invented, as to devote himself to
  the pursuit of his favourite studies. The director became impatient. He
  declined to furnish further funds. Then Benoît declared that the machine was
  complete.</p>

  <p>This machine, for the construction of which he had asked for two or three
  pieces of wood, was an enormous scaffold formed of beams ten feet long,
  supporting the Voltaic pile described by M. Allix, ensconced in the bowls of
  which were the wretched snails stuck to the bottom of the basins by some sort
  of glue, at intervals. This was the Pasilalinic-sympathetic compass. It
  occupied one end of the apartment. At the other end was a second, exactly
  similar. Each contained twenty-four alphabetic-sympathetic snails. These poor
  beasts, glued to the bottom of the zinc cups with little dribbles of sulphate
  of copper trickling down the sides of the bowls from the saturated cloth
  placed on them, were uncomfortable, and naturally tried to get away. They
  thrust themselves from their shells and poked forth their horns groping for
  some congenial spot on which to crawl, and came in contact with the wood on
  which was painted the letters. But if they came across a drop of solution of
  sulphate of copper, they went precipitately back into their shells.</p>

  <p>Properly, the two machines should have been established in different
  rooms, but no second room was available on the flat where Benoît was lodged,
  so he was forced to erect both vis-à-vis. That, however, was a matter wholly
  immaterial, as he explained to those who visited the laboratory. Space was
  not considered by snails. Place one in Paris, the other at the antipodes, the
  transmission of thought along their sympathetic current was as complete,
  instantaneous and effective as in his room on the <i>troisième</i>. In proof
  of this, Benoît undertook to correspond with his friend and fellow-worker
  Biat-Chrétien in America, who had constructed a similar apparatus. He assured
  all who came to inspect his invention that he conversed daily by means of the
  snails with his absent friend. When the machine was complete, the inventor
  was in no hurry to show it in working order; however M. Triat urged
  performance on him. He said, and there was reason in what he said, that an
  exhibition of the pasilalinic telegraph before it was perfected, would be
  putting others on the track, who might, having more means at their command,
  forestall him, and so rob him of the fruit of his labours. At last he invited
  M. Triat and M. Allix, as representative of an influential journal, to
  witness the apparatus in working order, on October 2nd. He assured them that
  since September 30, he had been in constant correspondence with
  Biat-Chrétien, who, without crossing the sea, would assist at the experiments
  conducted at Paris on Wednesday, October 2nd, in the lodging of M.
  Benoît.</p>

  <p>On the appointed day, M. Triat and M. Allix were at the appointed place.
  The former at once objected to the position of the two compasses, but was
  constrained to be satisfied with the reason given by the operator. If they
  could not be in different rooms, at least a division should be made in the
  apartment by means of a curtain, so that the operator at one compass could
  not see him at the other. But there was insuperable difficulty in doing this,
  so M. Triat had to waive this objection also. M. Jules Allix was asked to
  attend one of the compasses, whilst the inventor stood on the scaffold
  managing the other. M. Allix was to send the message, by touching the snails
  which represented the letters forming the words to be transmitted, whereupon
  the corresponding snail on M. Benoît's apparatus was supposed to thrust forth
  his horns. But, under one pretext or another, the inventor ran from one
  apparatus to the other, the whole time, so that it was not very difficult,
  with a little management, to reproduce on his animated compass the letters
  transmitted by M. Jules Allix.</p>

  <p>The transmission, moreover, was not as exact as it ought to have been. M.
  Jules Allix had touched the snails in such order as to form the word
  <i>gymnase</i>; Benoît on his compass read the word <i>gymoate</i>. Then M.
  Triat, taking the place of the inventor, sent the words <i>lumiere divine</i>
  to M. Jules Allix, who read on his compass <i>lumhere divine</i>. Evidently
  the snails were bad in their orthography. The whole thing, moreover, was a
  farce, and the correspondence, such as it was, was due to the incessant
  voyages of the inventor from one compass to the other, under the pretext of
  supervising the mechanism of the two apparatuses.</p>

  <p>Benoît was then desired to place himself in communication with his
  American friend, planted before his compass on the other side of the
  Atlantic. He transmitted to him the signal to be on the alert. Then he
  touched with a live snail he held in his hand the four snails that
  corresponded to the letters of the name BIAT; then they awaited the reply
  from America. After a few moments, the poor glued snails began to poke out
  their horns in a desultory, irregular manner, and by putting the letters
  together, with some accommodation CESTBIEN was made out, which when divided,
  and the apostrophe added, made <i>C'est bien</i>.</p>

  <p>M. Triat was much disconcerted. He considered himself as hoaxed. Not so M.
  Allix. He was so completely satisfied, that on the 27th October, appeared the
  article from his pen which we have quoted. M. Triat then went to the inventor
  and told him point blank, that he withdrew his protection from him. Benoît
  entreated him not to throw up the matter, before the telegraph was
  perfected.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" said M. Triat; "nothing is easier than for you to make me
  change my intention. Let one of your compasses be set up in my gymnasium, and
  the other in the side apartment. If that seems too much, then let a simple
  screen be drawn between the two, and do you refrain from passing between them
  whilst the experiment is being carried on. If under these conditions you
  succeed in transmitting a single word from one apparatus to the other, I will
  give you a thousand francs a day whilst your experiments are successful."</p>

  <p>M. Triat then visited M. de Girardin who was interested in the matter,
  half believed in it, and had accordingly opened the columns of <i>La
  Presse</i> to the article of M. Allix. M. de Girardin wished to be present at
  the crucial experiment, and M. Triat gladly invited him to attend. He offered
  another thousand francs so long as the compasses worked. "My plan is this,"
  said M. de Girardin: "If Benoît's invention is a success, we will hire the
  <i>Jardin d'hiver</i> and make Benoît perform his experiments in public. That
  will bring us in a great deal more than two thousand francs a day."</p>

  <p>Benoît accepted all the conditions with apparent alacrity; but, before the
  day arrived for the experiment, after the removal of the two great scaffolds
  to the gymnasiums&mdash;he had disappeared. He was, however, seen afterwards
  several times in Paris, very thin, with eager restless eyes, apparently
  partly deranged. He died in 1852!</p>

  <p>Alas for Benoît. He died a few years too soon. A little later, and he
  might have become a personage of importance in the great invasion of the
  table-turning craze which shortly after inundated Europe, and turned many
  heads as well as tables.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE COUNTESS GOERLITZ</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE of the most strange and terrible tragedies of this
  century was the murder of the Countess Goerlitz; and it excited immense
  interest in Germany, both because of the high position of the unfortunate
  lady, the mystery attaching to her death, and because the charge of having
  murdered her rested on her husband, the Count Goerlitz, Chamberlain to the
  Grand-Duke of Hesse, Privy Councillor, a man of fortune as well as rank, and
  of unimpeachable character. There was another reason why the case excited
  general interest: the solution remained a mystery for three whole years, from
  1847 to 1850.</p>

  <p>The Count Goerlitz was a man of forty-six, a great favourite at the Court,
  and of fine appearance. He had married, in 1820, the daughter of the Privy
  Councillor, Plitt. They had no children. The Countess was aged forty-six when
  the terrible event occurred which we are about to relate.</p>

  <p>The Count and Countess lived in their mansion in the Neckarstrasse in
  Darmstadt&mdash;a large, palatial house, handsomely furnished. Although
  living under the same roof, husband and wife lived apart. She occupied the
  first floor, and he the parterre, or ground floor. They dined together. The
  cause of the unfriendly terms on which they lived was the fact that the
  Countess was wealthy, her family was of citizen origin, and had amassed a
  large fortune in trade. Her father had been ennobled by the Grand-Duke, and
  she had been his heiress. The Count, himself, had not much of his own, and
  his wife cast this fact in his teeth. She loved to talk of the "beggar
  nobility," who were obliged to look out for rich burghers' daughters to gild
  their coronets. The Count may have been hot of temper, and have aggravated
  matters by sharpness of repartee; but, according to all accounts, it was her
  miserliness and bitter tongue which caused the estrangement.</p>

  <p>There were but four servants in the house&mdash;the Count's valet, the
  coachman, a manservant of the Countess, and the cook.</p>

  <p>Every Sunday the Count Goerlitz dined at the palace. On Sunday, June 13,
  1847, he had dined at the Grand-Duke's table as usual. As we know from the
  letters of the Princess Alice, life was simple at that Court. Hours were, as
  usual in South Germany, early. The carriage took the Count to dinner at the
  palace at 3 P.M., and he returned home in it to the Neckar Street at
  half-past six. When he came in he asked the servant of the Countess, a man
  named John Stauff, whether his wife was at home, as he wanted to see her. As
  a matter of fact, he had brought away from the dinner-table at the palace
  some maccaroons and bonbons for her, as she had a sweet tooth, and he thought
  the attention might please her.</p>

  <p>As John Stauff told him the Countess was in, he ascended the stone
  staircase. A glass door led into the anteroom. He put his hand to it and
  found it fastened. Thinking that his wife was asleep, or did not want to be
  disturbed, he went downstairs to his own room, which was under her
  sitting-room. There he listened for her tread, intending, on hearing it, to
  reascend and present her with the bonbons. As he heard nothing, he went out
  for a walk. The time was half-past seven. A little before nine o'clock he
  returned from his stroll, drew on his dressing-gown and slippers, and asked
  for his supper, a light meal he was wont to take by himself in his own room,
  though not always, for the Countess frequently joined him. Her mood was
  capricious. As he had the bonbons in his pocket, and had not yet been able to
  present them, he sent her man Stauff to tell her ladyship that supper was
  served, and that it would give him great satisfaction if she would honour him
  with her presence. Stauff came back in a few moments to say that the Countess
  was not at home. "Nonsense!" said the husband, "of course she is at home. She
  may, however, be asleep. I will go myself and find her." Thereupon he
  ascended the stairs, and found, as before, the glass door to the anteroom
  fastened. He looked in, but saw nothing. He knocked, and received no answer.
  Then he went to the bedroom door, knocked, without result; listened, and
  heard no sound. The Count had a key to the dressing-room; he opened, and went
  in, and through that he passed into the bed-chamber. That was empty. The
  bed-clothes were turned down for the night, but were otherwise undisturbed.
  He had no key to the anteroom and drawing-room.</p>

  <p>Then the Count went upstairs to the laundry, which was on the highest
  storey, and where were also some rooms. The Countess was particular about her
  lace and linen, and often attended to them herself, getting up some of the
  collars and frills with her own hands. She was not in the laundry. Evidently
  she was, as Stauff had said, not at home. The Count questioned the
  manservant. Had his mistress intimated her intention of supping abroad? No,
  she had not. Nevertheless, it was possible she might have gone to intimate
  friends. Accordingly, he sent to the palace of Prince Wittgenstein, and to
  the house of Councillor von Storch, to inquire if she were at either. She had
  been seen at neither.</p>

  <p>The Count was puzzled, without, however, being seriously alarmed. He bade
  Stauff call the valet, Schiller, and the coachman, Schämbs, who slept out of
  the house, and then go for a locksmith. Stauff departed. Presently the valet
  and coachman arrived, and, after, Stauff, without the locksmith, who, he
  said, was ill, and his man was at the tavern. The Count was angry and
  scolded. Then the coachman went forth, and soon came back with the
  locksmith's apprentice, who was set at once to open the locked doors in the
  top storey. The Countess was not in them. At the same time the young man
  noticed a smell of burning, but whence it came they could not decide.
  Thinking that this smell came from the kitchen on the first storey&mdash;that
  is, the floor above where the Count lived&mdash;they attacked the door of the
  kitchen, which was also locked. She was not there. Then the Count led the way
  to the private sitting-room of the Countess. As yet only the young locksmith
  had noticed the fire, the others were uncertain whether they smelt anything
  unusual or not. The key of the apprentice would not fit the lock of the
  Countess' ante-room, so he ran home to get another. Then the Count went back
  to his own apartment, and on entering it, himself perceived the smell of
  burning. Accordingly, he went upstairs again, to find that the coachman had
  opened an iron stove door in the passage, and that a thick pungent smoke was
  pouring out of it. We must enter here into an explanation. In many cases the
  porcelain stove of a German house has no opening into the room. It is lighted
  outside through a door into the passage. Several stoves communicate with one
  chimney. The Count and his servants ran out into the courtyard to look at the
  chimney stack to see if smoke were issuing from it. None was. Then they
  returned to the house. The apprentice had not yet returned. Looking through
  the glass door, they saw that there was smoke in the room. It had been
  unperceived before, for it was evening and dusk. At once the Count's valet,
  Schiller, smashed the plate glass, and through the broken glass smoke rolled
  towards them.</p>

  <p>The hour was half-past ten. The search had occupied an hour and a half. It
  had not been prosecuted with great activity; but then, no suspicion of
  anything to cause alarm had been entertained. If the Countess were at home,
  she must be in the sitting-room. From this room the smoke must come which
  pervaded the ante-chamber. The fire must be within, and if the Countess were
  there, she must run the danger of suffocation. Consequently, as the keys were
  not at hand, the doors ought to be broken open at once. This was not done.
  Count Goerlitz sent the servants away. Stauff he bade run for a
  chimney-sweep, and Schiller for his medical man, Dr. Stegmayer. The coachman
  had lost his head and ran out into the street, yelling, "Fire! fire!" The
  wife of Schiller, who had come in, ran out to summon assistance.</p>

  <p>The Count was left alone outside the glass door; and there he remained
  passive till the arrival of the locksmith's man with the keys. More time was
  wasted. None of the keys would open the door, and still the smoke rolled out.
  Then the apprentice beat the door open with a stroke of his hammer. He did it
  of his own accord, without orders from the Count. That was remembered
  afterwards. At once a dense, black, sickly-smelling smoke poured forth, and
  prevented the entrance of those who stood without.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the coachman and others had put ladders against the wall,
  one to the window of the ante-room, the other to that of the parlour. Seitz,
  the apprentice, ran up the ladder, and peered in. The room was quite dark. He
  broke two panes in the window, and at once a blue flame danced up, caught the
  curtains, flushed yellow, and shot out a fiery tongue through the broken
  window. Seitz, who seems to have been the only man with presence of mind,
  boldly put his arm through and unfastened the valves, and, catching the
  burning curtains, tore them down and flung them into the street. Then he cast
  down two chairs which were flaming from the window. He did not venture in
  because of the smoke.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile the coachman had broken the window panes of the
  ante-room. This produced a draught through the room, as the glass door had
  been broken in by Seitz. The smoke cleared sufficiently to allow of admission
  to the parlour door. This door was also found to be locked, and not only
  locked, but with the key withdrawn from it, as had been from the ante-chamber
  door. This door was also burst open, and then it was seen that the
  writing-desk of the Countess was on fire. That was all that could be
  distinguished at the first glance. The room was full of smoke, and the heat
  was so great that no one could enter.</p>

  <p>Water was brought in jugs and pails, and thrown upon the floor. The
  current of air gradually dissipated the smoke, and something white was
  observed on the floor near the burning desk. "Good heavens!" exclaimed the
  Count, "there she lies!"</p>

  <p>The Countess lay on the floor beside her writing-desk; the white object
  was her stockings.</p>

  <p>Among those who entered was a smith called Wetzell; he dashed forward,
  flung a pail of water over the burning table, caught hold of the feet of the
  dead body, and dragged it into the ante-room. Then he sought to raise it, but
  it slipped through his hands. A second came to his assistance, with the same
  result. The corpse was like melted butter. When he seized it by the arm, the
  flesh came away from the bone.</p>

  <p>The body was laid on a mat, and so transported into a cabinet. The upper
  portion was burnt to coal; one hand was charred; on the left foot was a shoe,
  the other was found, later, in another room. More water was brought, and the
  fire in the parlour was completely quenched. Then only was it possible to
  examine the place. The fire had, apparently, originated at the writing-desk
  or secretaire of the Countess; the body had lain before the table, and near
  it was a chair, thrown over. From the drawing-room a door, which was found
  open, led into the boudoir. This boudoir had a window that looked into a side
  street. In the ante-room were no traces of fire. In the drawing-room only the
  secretaire and the floor beneath it had been burnt. On a chiffonier against
  the wall were candlesticks, the stearine candles in them had been melted by
  the heat of the room and run over the chiffonier.</p>

  <p>In this room was also a sofa, opposite the door leading from the
  ante-chamber, some way from the desk and the seat of the fire. In the middle
  of the sofa was a hole fourteen inches long by six inches broad, burnt
  through the cretonne cover, the canvas below, and into the horse hair
  beneath. A looking-glass hung against the wall above; this glass was broken
  and covered with a deposit as of smoke. It was apparent, therefore, that a
  flame had leaped up on the sofa sufficiently high and hot to snap the mirror
  and obscure it.</p>

  <p>Left of the entrance-door was a bell-rope, torn down and cast on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Beyond the parlour was the boudoir. It had a little corner divan. Its
  cover was burnt through in two places. The cushion at the back was also
  marked with holes burnt through. Above this seat against the wall hung an oil
  painting. It was blistered with heat. Near it was an étagère, on which were
  candles; these also were found melted completely away. In this boudoir was
  found the slipper from the right foot of the Countess.</p>

  <p>If the reader will consider what we have described, he will see that
  something very mysterious must have occurred. There were traces of burning in
  three distinct places&mdash;on the sofa, and at the secretaire in the
  parlour, and on the corner seat in the boudoir. It was clear also that the
  Countess had been in both rooms, for her one slipper was in the boudoir, the
  other on her foot in the drawing-room. Apparently, also, she had rung for
  assistance, and torn down the bell-rope.</p>

  <p>Another very significant and mysterious feature of the case was the fact
  that the two doors were found locked, and that the key was not found with the
  body, nor anywhere in the rooms. Consequently, the Countess had not locked
  herself in.</p>

  <p>Again:&mdash;the appearance of the corpse was peculiar. The head and face
  were burnt to cinder, especially the face, less so the back of the head. All
  the upper part of the body had been subjected to fire, as far as the lower
  ribs, and there the traces of burning ceased absolutely. Also, the floor was
  burnt in proximity to the corpse, but not where it lay. The body had
  protected the floor where it lay from fire.</p>

  <p>The police were at once informed of what had taken place, and the
  magistrates examined the scene and the witnesses. This was done in a
  reprehensibly inefficient manner. The first opinion entertained was that the
  Countess had been writing at her desk, and had set fire to herself, had run
  from room to room, tried to obtain assistance by ringing the bell, had
  failed, fallen, and died. Three medical men were called in to examine the
  body. One decided that this was a case of spontaneous combustion. The second
  that it was not a case of spontaneous combustion. The third simply stated
  that she had been burnt, but how the fire originated he was unable to say. No
  minute examination of the corpse was made. It was not even stripped of the
  half-burnt clothes upon it. It was not dissected. The family physician signed
  a certificate of "accidental death," and two days after the body was
  buried.</p>

  <p>Only three or, at the outside, four hypotheses could account for the death
  of the Countess.</p>

  <p>1. She had caught fire accidentally, whilst writing at her desk.</p>

  <p>2. She had died of spontaneous combustion.</p>

  <p>3. She had been murdered.</p>

  <p>There is, indeed, a fourth hypothesis&mdash;that she had committed
  suicide; but this was too improbable to be entertained. The manner of death
  was not one to be reconciled with the idea of suicide.</p>

  <p>The first idea was that in the minds of the magistrates. They were
  prepossessed with it. They saw nothing that could militate against it.
  Moreover, the Count was Chamberlain at Court, a favourite of the sovereign
  and much liked by the princes, also a man generally respected. Unquestionably
  this had something to do with the hasty and superficial manner in which the
  examination was gone through. The magistrates desired to have the tragedy
  hushed up.</p>

  <p>A little consideration shows that the theory of accident was untenable.
  The candles were on the chiffonier, and no traces of candlesticks were found
  on the spot where the fire had burned. Moreover, the appearance of the
  secretaire was against this theory. The writing-desk and table consisted of a
  falling flap, on which the Countess wrote, and which she could close and
  lock. Above this table were several small drawers which contained her
  letters, receipted bills, and her jewelry. Below it were larger drawers. The
  upper drawers were not completely burnt; on the other hand, the lower drawers
  were completely consumed, and their bottoms and contents had fallen in
  cinders on the floor beneath, which was also burnt through to the depth of an
  inch and a half to two inches. It was apparent, therefore, that the
  secretaire had been set on fire from below. Moreover, there was more charcoal
  found under it than could be accounted for, by supposing it had fallen from
  above. Now it will be remembered that only the upper portion of the body was
  consumed. The Countess had not set fire to herself whilst writing, and so set
  fire to the papers on the desk. That was impossible.</p>

  <p>The supposition that she had died of spontaneous combustion was also
  entertained by a good many. But no well-authenticated case of spontaneous
  combustion is known. Professor Liebig, when afterwards examined on this case,
  stated that spontaneous combustion of the human body was absolutely
  impossible, and such an idea must be relegated to the region of myths.</p>

  <p>There remained, therefore, no other conclusion at which it was possible
  for a rational person to arrive who weighed the circumstances than that the
  Countess had been murdered.</p>

  <p>The Magisterial Court of the city of Darmstadt had attempted to hush-up
  the case. The German press took it up. It excited great interest and
  indignation throughout the country. It was intimated pretty pointedly that
  the case had been scandalously slurred over, because of the rank of the Count
  and the intimate relation in which he stood to the royal family. The papers
  did not shrink from more than insinuating that this was a case of murder, and
  that the murderer was the husband of the unfortunate woman. Some suspicion
  that this was so seems to have crossed the minds of the servants of the
  house. They recollected his dilatoriness in entering the rooms of the
  Countess; the time that was protracted in idle sending for keys, and trying
  key after key, when a kick of the foot or a blow of the hammer would have
  sufficed to give admission to the room where she lay. It was well known that
  the couple did not live on the best terms. To maintain appearances before the
  world, they dined and occasionally supped together. They rarely met alone,
  and when they did fell into dispute, and high words passed which the servants
  heard.</p>

  <p>The Countess was mean and miserly, she grudged allowing her husband any of
  her money. She had, however, made her will the year before, leaving all her
  large fortune to her husband for life. Consequently her death released him
  from domestic and pecuniary annoyances. On the morning after the death he
  sent for the agent of the insurance company with whom the furniture and other
  effects were insured and made his claim. He claimed, in addition to the value
  of the furniture destroyed, the worth of a necklace of diamonds and pearls
  which had been so injured by the fire that it had lost the greater part of
  its value. The pearls were quite spoiled, and the diamonds reduced in worth
  by a half. The agent refused this claim, as he contended that the jewelry was
  not included in the insurance, and the Count abstained from pressing it.</p>

  <p>To the Count the situation became at length intolerable. He perceived a
  decline of cordiality in his reception at Court, his friends grew cold, and
  acquaintances cut him. He must clear himself of the charge which now weighed
  on him. The death of the Countess had occurred on June 13, 1847. On October
  6, that is four months later, Count Goerlitz appeared before the Grand-Ducal
  Criminal Court of Darmstadt, and produced a bundle of German newspapers
  charging him with having murdered his wife, and set fire to the room to
  conceal the evidence of his crime. He therefore asked to have the case
  re-opened, and the witnesses re-examined. Nothing followed. The Court
  hesitated to take up the case again, and throw discredit on the magistrates'
  decision in June. Again, on October 16, the Count renewed his request, and
  desired, if this were refused, that he and his solicitor might be allowed
  access to the minutes of the examination, that they might be enabled to take
  decided measures for the clearing of the Count's character, and the
  chastisement of those who charged him with an atrocious crime. On October 21,
  he received a reply, "that his request could not be granted, unless he
  produced such additional evidence as would show the Court that the former
  examination was defective."</p>

  <p>On October 25, the Count laid a mass of evidence before the Court which,
  he contended, would materially modify, if not absolutely upset the conclusion
  arrived at by the previous investigation.</p>

  <p>Then, at last, consent was given; but proceedings did not begin till
  November, and dragged on till the end of October in the following year, when
  a new law of criminal trial having been passed in the grand-duchy, the whole
  of what had gone before became invalid, save as preliminary investigation,
  and it was not till March 4, 1850&mdash;that is, not till <i>three
  years</i>after the death of the Countess&mdash;that the case was thoroughly
  sifted and settled. Before the promulgation of the law of October, 1848, all
  trials were private, then trial by jury, and in public, was introduced.</p>

  <p>However, something had been done. In August 1848&mdash;that is, over a
  year after the burial of the Countess&mdash;the body was exhumed and
  submitted to examination. Two facts were then revealed. The skull of the
  Countess had been fractured by some blunt instrument; and she had been
  strangled. The condition in which the tongue had been found when the body was
  first discovered had pointed to strangulation, the state of the jaws when
  exhumed proved it.</p>

  <p>So much, then, was made probable. A murderer had entered the room, struck
  the Countess on the head, and when that did not kill her, he had throttled
  her. Then, apparently, so it was argued, he had burnt the body, and next,
  before it was more than half consumed, had placed it near the secretaire,
  and, finally, had set fire to the secretaire.</p>

  <p>He had set fire to the writing-desk to lead to the supposition that the
  Countess had set fire to herself whilst writing at it; and this was the first
  conclusion formed.</p>

  <p>That a struggle had taken place appeared from several circumstances. The
  bell-rope was torn down. Probably no servant had been in the house that
  Sunday evening when the bell rang desperately for aid. The seat flung over
  seemed to point to her having been surprised at the desk. One shoe was in the
  boudoir. The struggle had been continued as she fled from the sitting-room
  into the inner apartment.</p>

  <p>Now, only, were the fire-marks on the divan and sofa explicable. The
  Countess had taken refuge first on one, then on the other, after having been
  wounded, and her blood had stained them. The murderer had burnt out the marks
  of blood.</p>

  <p>She had fled from the sitting-room to the boudoir, and thence had hoped to
  escape through the next door into a corner room, but the door of that room
  was locked.</p>

  <p>The next point to be determined was, where had her body been burnt.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1306821h-images/Oddities1-02.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>In the sitting-room, the boudoir, and a locked corner room were stoves.
  The walls of these rooms met, and in the angles were the stoves. They all
  communicated with one chimney. They were all heated from an opening in the
  anteroom, marked <i>a</i>, which closed with an iron door, and was covered
  with tapestry. The opening was large enough for a human being to be thrust
  through, and the fire-chamber amply large enough also for its
  consumption.</p>

  <p>Much time had passed since a serious examination was begun, and it was too
  late to think of finding evidence of the burning of the body in this place.
  The stoves had been used since, each winter. However, some new and surprising
  evidence did come to light. At five minutes past eight on the evening that
  the mysterious death took place, Colonel von Stockhausen was on the opposite
  side of the street talking to a lady, when his attention was arrested by a
  dense black smoke issuing suddenly from the chimney of the Count Goerlitz'
  palace. He continued looking at the column of smoke whilst conversing with
  the lady, uncertain whether the chimney were on fire or not, and whether he
  ought to give the alarm. When the lady left him, after about ten minutes, or
  a quarter of an hour, he saw that smoke ceased to issue from the chimney. He
  accordingly went his way without giving notice of the smoke.</p>

  <p>So far every piece of evidence went to show that the Countess had been
  murdered. The conclusion now arrived at was this: she had been struck on the
  head, chased from room to room bleeding, had been caught, strangled, then
  thrust into the fire-chamber of the stove over a fire which only half
  consumed her; taken out again and laid before the secretaire, and the
  secretaire deliberately set fire to, and all the blood-marks obliterated by
  fire. That something of this kind had taken place was evident. Who had done
  it was not so clear. The efforts of the Count to clear himself had
  established the fact that his wife was murdered, but did not establish his
  innocence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly&mdash;the case assumed a new aspect, through an incident wholly
  unexpected and extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The result of inquiry into the case of the death of the Countess Goerlitz
  was, that the decision that she had come to her end by accident, given by the
  city magistrates, was upset, and it was made abundantly clear that she had
  been murdered. By whom murdered was not so clear.</p>

  <p>Inquiry carried the conclusion still further. She had been robbed as well
  as murdered.</p>

  <p>We have already described the writing-desk of the Countess. There were
  drawers below the flap, and other smaller drawers concealed by it when
  closed. In the smaller drawers she kept her letters, her bills, her vouchers
  for investments, and her jewelry. Among the latter was the pearl and diamond
  necklace, which she desired by her will might be sold, and the money given to
  a charitable institution. The necklace was indeed discovered seriously
  injured; but what had become of her bracelets, brooches, rings, her other
  necklets, her earrings? She had also a chain of pearls, which was nowhere to
  be found. All these articles were gone. No trace of them had been found in
  the cinders under the secretaire; moreover, the drawers in which she
  preserved them were not among those burnt through. In the first excitement
  and bewilderment caused by her death, the Count had not observed the loss,
  and the magistrates had not thought fit to inquire whether any robbery had
  been committed.</p>

  <p>A very important fact was now determined. The Countess had been robbed,
  and murdered, probably for the sake of her jewels. Consequently the murderer
  was not likely to be the Count.</p>

  <p>When the case was re-opened, at Count Goerlitz's repeated demand, an
  "Inquirent" was appointed by the Count to examine the case&mdash;that is, an
  official investigator of all the circumstances; and on November 2, 1847, in
  the morning, notice was given to the Count that the "Inquirent" would visit
  his mansion on the morrow and examine both the scene of the murder and the
  servants. The Count at once convoked his domestics and bade them be in the
  house next day, ready for examination.</p>

  <p>That same afternoon the cook, Margaret Eyrich by name, was engaged in the
  kitchen preparing dinner for the master, who dined at 4 P.M. At three o'clock
  the servant-man, John Stauff, came into the kitchen and told the cook that
  her master wanted a fire lit in one of the upper rooms. She refused to go
  because she was busy at the stove. Stauff remained a quarter of an hour there
  talking to her. Then he said it was high time for him to lay the table for
  dinner, a remark to which she gave an assent, wondering in her own mind why
  he had delayed so long. He took up a soup dish, observed that it was not
  quite clean, and asked her to wash it. She was then engaged on some sauce
  over the fire.</p>

  <p>"I will wash it, if you will stir the sauce," she said. "If I leave the
  pan, the sauce will be burnt."</p>

  <p>Stauff consented, and she went with the dish to the sink. Whilst thus
  engaged, she turned her head, and was surprised to see that Stauff had a
  small phial in his hand, and was pouring its contents into the sauce.</p>

  <p>She asked him what he was about; he denied having done anything, and the
  woman, with great prudence, said nothing further, so as not to let him think
  that her suspicions were aroused. Directly, however, that he had left the
  kitchen, she examined the sauce, saw it was discoloured, and on trying it,
  that the taste was unpleasant. She called in the coachman and the
  housekeeper. On consultation they decided that this matter must be further
  investigated. The housekeeper took charge of the sauce, and carried it to Dr.
  Stegmayer, the family physician, who at once said that verdigris had been
  mixed with it, and desired that the police should be communicated with. This
  was done, the sauce was analysed, and found to contain 15½ grains of
  verdigris, enough to poison a man. Thereupon Stauff was arrested.</p>

  <p>We see now that an attempt had been made on the life of the Count, on the
  day on which he had announced that an official inquiry into the murder was to
  be made in his house and among his domestics.</p>

  <p>Stauff, then, was apparently desirous of putting the Count out of the way
  before that inquiry was made. At this very time a terrible tragedy had
  occurred in France, and was in all the papers. The Duke of Praslin had
  murdered his wife, and when he was about to be arrested, the duke had
  poisoned himself.</p>

  <p>Did Stauff wish that the Count should be found poisoned that night, in
  order that the public might come to the conclusion he had committed suicide
  to escape arrest? It would seem so.</p>

  <p>John Stauff's arrest took place on November 3, 1847, four months and a
  half after the death of the Countess. He was, however, only arrested on a
  charge of attempting to poison the Count, and the further charge of having
  murdered the Countess was not brought against him till August 28, 1848. The
  body of the murdered woman, it will be remembered, was not exhumed and
  examined till August 11, 1848&mdash;eight months after the re-opening of the
  investigation! It is really wonderful that the mystery should have been
  cleared and the Count's character satisfactorily vindicated, with such
  dilatoriness of proceeding. One more instance of the stupid way in which the
  whole thing was managed. Although John Stauff was charged with the attempt to
  poison on November 3, 1847, he was not questioned on the charge till January
  10, 1849, that is, till he had been fourteen months in prison.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that the bell-rope in the Countess's parlour was
  torn down. It would suggest itself to the meanest capacity that here was a
  point of departure for inquiry. If the bell had been torn down, it must have
  pealed its summons for help through the house. Who was in the house at the
  time? If anyone was, why did he not answer the appeal? Inconceivable was the
  neglect of the magistrates of Darmstadt in the first examination&mdash;they
  did not inquire. Only several months later was this matter subjected to
  investigation.</p>

  <p>In the house lived the Count and Countess, the cook, who also acted as
  chambermaid to the Countess, Schiller, the valet to the Count, Schämbs, the
  coachman, and the Countess's own servant-man, John Stauff. Of these Schiller
  and Schämbs did not sleep in the house.</p>

  <p>June 13, the day of the murder, was a Sunday. The Count went as usual to
  the grand-ducal palace in his coach at 3 P.M. The coachman drove him; Stauff
  sat on the box beside the coachman. They left the Count at the palace and
  returned home. They were ordered to return to the palace to fetch him at 6
  P.M. On Sundays, the Count usually spent his day in his own suite of
  apartments, and the Countess in hers. On the morning in question she had come
  downstairs to her husband with a bundle of coupons which she wanted him to
  cash for her on the morrow. He managed her fortune for her. The sum was
  small, only £30. At 2 P.M. she went to the kitchen to tell the cook she might
  go out for the afternoon, as she would not be wanted, and that she must
  return by 9 P.M.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock the cook left. The cook saw and spoke to her as she left.
  The Countess was then partially undressed, and the cook supposed she was
  changing her clothes. Shortly after this, Schiller, the Count's valet, saw
  and spoke with her. She was then upstairs in the laundry arranging the linen
  for the mangle. She was then in her morning cotton dress. Consequently she
  had not dressed herself to go out, as the cook supposed. At the same time the
  carriage left the court of the house for the palace. That was the last seen
  of her alive, except by John Stauff, and, if he was not the murderer, by one
  other.</p>

  <p>About a quarter past three the coach returned with Schämbs and Stauff on
  the box. The Count had been left at the palace. The coachman took out his
  horses, without unharnessing them, and left for his own house, at half-past
  three, to remain there till 5 o'clock, when he must return, put the horses
  in, and drive back to the palace to fetch the Count. A quarter of an hour
  after the coachman left, Schiller went out for a walk with his little
  boy.</p>

  <p>Consequently&mdash;none were in the house but the Countess and Stauff, and
  Stauff knew that the house was clear till 5 o'clock, when Schämbs would
  return to the stables. What happened during that time?</p>

  <p>At a quarter past four, the wife of Schiller came to the house with a
  little child, and a stocking she was knitting. She wanted to know if her
  husband had gone with the boy to Eberstadt, a place about four miles distant.
  She went to the back-door. It was not fastened, but on being opened rang a
  bell, like a shop door. Near it were two rooms, one occupied by Schiller, the
  other by Stauff. The wife went into her husband's room and found it empty.
  Then she went into that of Stauff. It also was empty. She returned into the
  entrance hall and listened. Everything was still in the house. She stood
  there some little while knitting and listening. Presently she heard steps
  descending the backstairs, and saw Stauff, with an apron about him, and a
  duster in his hand. She asked him if her husband had gone to Eberstadt, and
  he said that he had. Then she left the house. Stauff, however, called to her
  from the window to hold up the child to him, to kiss. She did so, and then
  departed.</p>

  <p>Shortly after five, Schämbs returned to the stable, put in the horses, and
  drove to the palace without seeing Stauff. He thought nothing of this, as
  Stauff usually followed on foot, in time to open the coach door for the
  Count. On this occasion, Stauff appeared at his post in livery, at a quarter
  to six. At half-past six both returned with their master to the house in
  Neckar Street.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, from half-past three to a quarter past four, and from
  half-past four to half-past five, Stauff was alone in the house with the
  Countess. But then, from a quarter to five to half-past five she was quite
  alone, and it was possible that the murder was committed at that time. The
  Count, it will be remembered, on his return, went upstairs and knocked at the
  door of the Countess' apartments, without meeting with a response. Probably,
  therefore, she was then dead.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock the coachman went away, and Stauff helped the Count to
  take off his court dining dress, and put on a light suit. He was with him
  till half-past seven, when the Count went out for a walk. The Count returned
  at half-past eight; during an hour, therefore, Stauff was alone in the house
  with the Countess, or&mdash;her corpse.</p>

  <p>What occurred during that hour? Here two independent pieces of evidence
  come in to assist us in determining what took place. At five minutes past
  eight, Colonel von Stockhausen had seen the column of black smoke issue from
  the chimney of the house; it ascended, he said, some fifteen feet above the
  chimney, and was so dense that it riveted his attention whilst he was talking
  to a lady.</p>

  <p>At about a quarter-past eight the smoke ceased.</p>

  <p>The reader may remember that the window of the inner boudoir did not look
  into the Neckar Street, but into a small side street. Immediately opposite
  lived a widow lady named Kekule. On the evening in question, her daughter,
  Augusta, a girl of eighteen, came in from a walk, and went upstairs to the
  room the window of which was exactly opposite, though at a somewhat higher
  level than the window of the boudoir. Looking out of her window, Augusta
  Kekule saw to her astonishment a flickering light like a lambent flame in the
  boudoir. A blind was down, so that she could see nothing distinctly. She was,
  however, alarmed, and called her brother Augustus, aged twenty years, and
  both watched the flames flashing in the room. They called their mother also,
  and all three saw it flare up high, then decrease, and go out. The time was
  8.15. On examination of the spot, it was seen that the window of Miss Kekule
  commanded the corner of the boudoir, where was the divan partly burnt through
  in several places.</p>

  <p>What was the meaning of these two appearances, the smoke and the flame?
  Apparently, from half-past seven to half-past eight the murderer was engaged
  in burning the body, and in effacing with fire the blood-stains on the sofas.
  During this time John Stauff was in the house, and, beside the Countess,
  alive or dead, John Stauff only.</p>

  <p>Stauff was now subjected to examination. He was required to account for
  his time on the afternoon and evening of Sunday, June 13.</p>

  <p>He said, that after his return from the palace, that is, about ten minutes
  past three, he went into his room on the basement, and ate bread and cheese.
  When told that the wife of Schiller stated she had seen him come downstairs,
  he admitted that he had run upstairs to fetch a duster, to brush away the
  bread crumbs from the table at which he had eaten. After the woman left,
  according to his own account, he remained in his room below till five
  o'clock, when the Countess came to the head of the stairs and called him. He
  went up and found her on the topmost landing; she went into the laundry, and
  he stood in the door whilst she spoke to him, and gave him some orders for
  the butcher and baker. She wore, he said, a black stuff gown. Whilst he was
  talking to her, Schämbs drove away to fetch the Count. He gave a correct
  account of what followed, up to the departure of the Count on his walk. After
  that, he said, he had written a letter to his sweetheart, and at eight went
  out to get his supper at an outdoor restaurant where he remained till
  half-past nine. He was unable to produce evidence of anyone who had seen him
  and spoken to him there; but, of course, much cannot be made of this, owing
  to the distance of time at which the evidence was taken from the event of the
  murder. According to his account, therefore, no one was in the house at the
  time when the smoke rose from the chimney, and the flame was seen in the
  boudoir.</p>

  <p>If we sum up the points determined concerning the murder of the Countess,
  we shall see how heavily the evidence told against Stauff.</p>

  <p>She had been attacked in her room, and after a desperate struggle, which
  went on in both parlour and boudoir, she had been killed.</p>

  <p>Her secretaire had been robbed.</p>

  <p>Her body had been burnt.</p>

  <p>The blood-stains had been effaced by fire.</p>

  <p>The secretaire had been set fire to; and, apparently, the body removed
  from where it had been partially consumed, and placed near it.</p>

  <p>Now all this must have taken time. It could only be done by one who knew
  that he had time in which to effect it undisturbed.</p>

  <p>John Stauff was at two separate times, in the afternoon and evening, alone
  in the house for an hour, knowing that during that time he would be
  undisturbed.</p>

  <p>If his account were true, the murder must have been committed during his
  brief absence with the coach, and the burning of the body, and setting fire
  to the room, done when he went out to get his supper. But&mdash;how could the
  murderer suppose he would leave the house open and unprotected at eight
  o'clock? Was it likely that a murderer and robber, after having killed the
  Countess and taken her jewels at six o'clock, would hang about till eight,
  waiting the chance of getting back to the scene of his crime unobserved, to
  attempt to disguise it? not knowing, moreover, how much time he would have
  for effecting his purpose?</p>

  <p>It was possible that this had been done, but it was not probable.</p>

  <p>Evidence was forthcoming from a new quarter that served to establish the
  guilt of Stauff.</p>

  <p>On October 6, 1847, an oilman, Henry Stauff, in Oberohmen, in Hesse
  Cassel, was arrested, because he was found to be disposing of several
  articles of jewelry, without being able to give a satisfactory account of
  where he got them. The jewelry consisted of a lump of molten gold, and some
  brooches, bracelets and rings.</p>

  <p>Henry Stauff had been a whitesmith in his youth, then he became a carrier,
  but in the last few years, since the death of his wife, he had sold knives,
  and been a knife-grinder. He was very poor, and had been unable to pay his
  rates. In July of 1847, however, his affairs seemed to have mended; he wore a
  silver watch, and took out a licence to deal in oil and seeds. When he
  applied for the patent, the burgomaster was surprised, and asked him how he
  could get stock to set up business, in his state of poverty. Thereupon, Henry
  Stauff opened his purse and showed that it contained a good amount of silver,
  and&mdash;with the coins was a gold ring with, apparently, a precious stone
  in it.</p>

  <p>The cause of his arrest was his offering the lump of gold to a silversmith
  in Cassel. It looked so much as if it was the melting up of jewelry, that the
  smith communicated with the police. On his arrest, Henry Stauff said he was
  the father of four children, two sons and two daughters; that his sons, one
  of whom was in the army, had sent him money, that his daughter in America had
  given him the jewelry, and that the gold he had had by him for several years,
  it had been given him by a widow, who was dead. The silver watch he had
  bought in Frankfort. Henry Stauff had a daughter at home, name Anna
  Margaretta, who often received letters from Darmstadt. One of these letters
  had not been stamped, and as she declined to pay double for it, it lay in the
  post-office till opened to be returned. Then it was found to be dated
  September 29, 1847, and to be from her brother, John Stauff. It simply
  contained an inclosure to her father; this was opened; it contained an angry
  remonstrance with him for not having done what he was required, and sent the
  money at once to the writer.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that this had reference to the disposal of the
  jewelry?</p>

  <p>On July 7, three weeks after the death of the Countess, Henry Stauff was
  at Darmstadt, where one son, Jacob, was in the army; the other, John, was in
  service with the Goerlitz family.</p>

  <p>This led the magistrates in Cassel to communicate with those in Darmstadt.
  On November 10, John Stauff was questioned with reference to his father. He
  said he had often sent him money. He was shown the jewelry, and asked if he
  recognised it. He denied having ever seen it, and having sent it to his
  father.</p>

  <p>The jewelry was shown to Count Goerlitz, and he immediately identified it
  as having belonged to his wife. A former lady's-maid of the Countess also
  identified the articles. The Count, and a maid, asserted that these articles
  had always been kept by the deceased lady in the small upper drawers of her
  secretaire. The Countess was vain and miserly, and often looked over her
  jewelry. She would, certainly, have missed her things had they been stolen
  before June 13.</p>

  <p>The articles had not been stolen since, found among the ashes, and carried
  off surreptitiously, for they showed no trace of fire.</p>

  <p>Here we must again remark on the extraordinary character of the
  proceedings in this case. The articles were identified and shown to John
  Stauff on November 10, 1847, but it was not till ten months after, on August
  28, 1848, that he was told that he was suspected of the murder of the
  Countess, and of having robbed her of these ornaments. Another of the
  eccentricities of the administration of justice in Darmstadt consisted in
  allowing the father Henry, and his son John, to have free private
  communication with each other, whilst the latter was in prison, and thus
  allowing them to concoct together a plausible account of their conduct, with
  which, however, we need not trouble ourselves.</p>

  <p>On September 1, 1848, on the fourth day after Stauff knew that he was
  charged with the murder of the Countess, he asked to make his statement of
  what really took place. This was the account he gave. It will be seen that,
  from the moment he knew the charge of murder was brought against him, he
  altered his defence.</p>

  <p>He said, "On June 20, 1847," (that is, a week after the murder), "about
  ten o'clock in the evening, after the Count had partaken of his supper and
  undressed, he brought me a box containing jewelry, and told me he would give
  it to me, as I was so poor, and that it would place my father and me in
  comfortable circumstances. I then told the Count that I did not know what to
  do with these jewels, whereupon he exhorted me to send them to my father, and
  get him to dispose of them. He told me that he required me solemnly to swear
  that I would not tell anyone about the jewels. I hid the box in a stocking
  and concealed it in some bushes on the Bessungen road. Later I told my
  brother Jacob where they were, and bade him give them to my father on his
  visit to Darmstadt."</p>

  <p>When Stauff was asked what reason he could assign for the Count giving him
  the jewels, he said that the Count saw that he, John Stauff, suspected him of
  the murder, and he named several circumstances, such as observing blood on
  the Count's handkerchief on the evening of the murder, which had led him to
  believe that the Count was guilty, and the Count was aware of his
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>On March 4, 1850, began the trial of John Stauff for the murder of the
  Countess, for robbery, for arson, and for attempt to poison the Count.</p>

  <p>At the same time his father, Henry Stauff, and his brother, Jacob Stauff,
  were tried for concealment of stolen goods. The trial came to an end on April
  11. As many as 118 witnesses were heard; among these was the Count Goerlitz,
  as to whose innocence no further doubts were entertained.</p>

  <p>John Stauff was at that time aged twenty-six, he was therefore twenty-four
  years old at the time of the murder. He had been at school at Oberohmen,
  where he had shown himself an apt and intelligent scholar. In 1844 he had
  entered the grand-ducal army, and in May 1846 had become servant in the
  Goerlitz house, as footman to the Countess. In his regiment he had behaved
  well; he had been accounted an excellent servant, and both his master and
  mistress placed confidence in him. Curiously enough, in the autumn of 1846,
  he had expressed a wish to a chambermaid of the Countess "that both the
  Countess and her pack of jewels, bracelets and all, might be burnt in one
  heap."</p>

  <p>When the maid heard of the death of the Countess in the following year,
  "Ah!" she said, "now Stauff's wish has been fulfilled to the letter."</p>

  <p>He was fond of talking of religion, and had the character among his
  fellow-servants of being pious. He was, however, deep in debt, and associated
  with women of bad character. Throughout the trial he maintained his
  composure, his lips closed, his colour pale, without token of agitation. But
  the man who could have stood by without showing emotion at the opening of the
  coffin of his mistress, at the sight of the half-burnt, half-decomposed
  remains of his victim, must have had powers of self-control of no ordinary
  description. During the trial he seemed determined to show that he was a man
  of some culture; he exhibited ease of manner and courtesy towards judges,
  jury, and lawyers. He never interrupted a witness, and when he questioned
  them, did so with intelligence and moderation. He often looked at the public,
  especially the women, who attended in great numbers, watching the effect of
  the evidence on their minds. When, as now and then happened, some ludicrous
  incident occurred, he laughed over it as heartily as the most innocent
  looker-on.</p>

  <p>The jury unanimously found him "guilty" on every count. They unanimously
  gave a verdict of "guilty" against his father and brother. Henry Stauff was
  sentenced to six months' imprisonment; Jacob Stauff to detention for three
  months, and John to imprisonment for life. At that time capital punishment
  could not be inflicted in Hesse.</p>

  <p>On June 3, he was taken to the convict prison of Marienschloss. On July 1,
  he appealed to the Grand-Duke to give him a free pardon, as he was innocent
  of the crimes for which he was sentenced. The appeal was rejected. Then he
  professed his intention of making full confession. He asked to see the Count.
  He professed himself a broken-hearted penitent, desirous of undoing, by a
  sincere confession, as much of the evil as was possible.</p>

  <p>We will give his confession in his own words.</p>

  <p class="quote">"When, at five o'clock, I went to announce to the Countess
  that I was about to go to the palace, I found both the glass door of the
  ante-room, and that into the sitting-room, open, and I walked in through
  them. I did not find the Countess in her parlour, of which the curtains were
  drawn. Nor was she in her boudoir. I saw the door into the little corner room
  ajar, so I presumed she was in there. The flap of her desk was down, so that
  I saw the little drawers, in which I knew she kept her valuables, accessible
  to my hand. Opportunity makes the thief. I was unable to resist the
  temptation to enrich myself by these precious articles. I opened one of the
  drawers, took out a gold bracelet, one of gold filigree, two of bronze, a
  pair of gold ear-rings, a gold brooch, and a triple chain of beads or Roman
  pearls; and pocketed these articles, which my father afterwards had, and, for
  the most part, melted up.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Most of these articles were in their cases. At that moment
  the Countess appeared on the threshold of her boudoir and rushed towards me.
  I do not remember what she exclaimed; fear for the consequences, and anxiety
  to prevent the Countess from making a noise and calling assistance, and
  thereby obtaining my arrest, prevailed in my mind, and I thought only how I
  might save myself. I grasped her by the neck, and pressed my thumbs into her
  throat. She struggled desperately. I was obliged to use all my strength to
  hold her. After a wrestle of between five and seven minutes, her eyes closed,
  her face became purple, and I felt her limbs relax.</p>

  <p class="quote">"When I saw she was dead I was overcome with terror. I let
  the body fall, whereby the head struck the corner of the left side of the
  secretaire, and this made a wound which began to bleed. Then I ran and locked
  both the doors, hid what I had taken in my bed, and left the house. On my way
  to the palace, I stepped into Frey's tavern and drank three glasses of wine.
  I was afraid I should arrive too late at the palace, where I appeared,
  however, at half-past five. The Count did not return till half-past six, as
  dinner that day lasted rather longer than usual.</p>

  <p class="quote">"When the Count went upstairs to see his wife and take her
  something good he had brought away with him from table, I was not uneasy at
  all, for I knew that he would knock and come away if he met with no response.
  So he did. He came down without being discomposed, and remarked that he
  fancied the Countess had gone out. At half-past seven he left the house. In
  the mean time I had been considering what to do, and had formed my plan. Now
  my opportunity had arrived, and I hastened to put it into execution. My plan
  was to efface every trace of my deed by fire, and to commit suicide if
  interrupted.</p>

  <p class="quote">"As the weather was chilly, the Count had some fire in his
  stove. I fetched the still glowing charcoal, collected splinters of firwood
  and other combustibles, and matches, and went upstairs with them. Only the
  wine sustained me through what I carried out. I took up the body. I put a
  chair before the open desk, seated the corpse on it, placed one arm on the
  desk, laid the head on the arm, so that the body reposed in a position of
  sleep, leaning on the flap of the desk. I threw the red hot charcoal down
  under the head, heaped matches, paper, and wood splinters over them; took one
  of the blazing bits of wood and threw it on the divan in the boudoir; locked
  both doors, and flung away the keys.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Then I went to my own room and lighted a fire in the stove,
  and put the jewel cases on the fire. The fire would not burn well, and thick
  smoke came into the room. Then I saw that the damper was closed. I opened
  that, and the smoke flew up the chimney; this is what Colonel von Stockhausen
  saw. There were a lot of empty match-boxes also in the stove, and these burnt
  with the rest."</p><br>

  <p>Such was the confession of Stauff. How far true, it is impossible to say.
  He said nothing about the bell-pull being torn down, nothing about the holes
  burnt in the sofa of the sitting-room. According to the opinion of some
  experimentalists, the way in which he pretended to have burnt the Countess
  would not account for the appearance of the corpse.</p>

  <p>His object was to represent himself as the victim of an over-mastering
  temptation&mdash;to show that the crime was wholly unpremeditated.</p>

  <p>This was the sole plea on which he could appeal for sympathy, and expect a
  relaxation of his sentence.</p>

  <p>That sentence was relaxed.</p>

  <p>In 1872 he obtained a free pardon from the Grand-Duke, on condition that
  he left the country and settled in America. Including his imprisonment before
  his trial, he had, therefore, undergone twenty-five years of
  incarceration.</p>

  <p>When released he went to America, where he probably still is.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; A WAX-AND-HONEY MOON</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the history of Selenography, John Henry Maedler holds a
  distinguished place. He was the very first to publish a large map of the
  lunar surface; and his map was a good one, very accurate, and beautifully
  executed, in four sheets (1834-6). For elucidation of this map he wrote a
  book concerning the moon, entitled "The Universal Selenography." Not content
  with this, he published a second map of the moon in 1837, embodying fresh
  discoveries. Indeed as an astronomer, Maedler was a specialist. Lord Dufferin
  when in Iceland met a German naturalist who had gone to that inclement island
  to look for one moth. It is of the nature of Teutonic scientific men not to
  diffuse their interests over many branches of natural history or other
  pursuits, but to focus them on a single point. Maedler was comparatively
  indifferent to the planets, cold towards the comets, and callous to the
  attractions of the nebulæ. On the subject of the moon, he was a sheer
  lunatic.</p>

  <p>He died at Hanover in 1874 at the age of eighty, a moon gazer to the last.
  Indeed, he appeared before the public as the historian of that science in a
  work published at Brunswick, the year previous to his death. The study of
  astronomy, more than any other,&mdash;even than theology&mdash;detaches a man
  from the world and its interests. Indeed theology as a study has a tendency
  to ruffle a man, and make him bark and snap at his fellow men who use other
  telescopes than himself; it is not so with astronomy. This science exercises
  a soothing influence on those who make it their study, so that an Adams and a
  Le Verrier can simultaneously discover a Neptune without flying at each
  other's noses.</p>

  <p>Astronomy is certainly an alluring science; set an astronomer before a
  telescope, and an overwhelming attraction draws his soul away through the
  tube up into heaven, and leaves his body without mundane interests. An
  astronomer is necessarily a mathematician, and mathematics are the hardest
  and most petrifying of studies. The "humane letters," as classic studies are
  called, draw out the human interests, they necessarily carry men among men,
  but mathematics draw men away from all the interests of their fellows. The
  last man one expects to find in love, the last man in whose life one looks
  for a romantic episode, is a mathematician and astronomer. But as even Cæsar
  nods, so an astronomer may lapse into spooning. The life of Professor Maedler
  does not contain much of animated interest; but it had its poetic incident.
  The curious story of his courtship and marriage may be related without
  indiscretion, now that the old Selenographer is no more.</p>

  <p>Even the most prosaic of men have their time of poetry. The swan is said
  to sing only once&mdash;just before it dies. The man of business&mdash;the
  stockbroker, the insurance-company manager, the solicitor, banker, the
  ironmonger, butcher, greengrocer, postman, have all passed through a
  "moment," as Hegel would call it, when the soul burst through its rind of
  common-place and vulgar routine, sang its nightingale song, and then was
  hushed for ever after. It is said that there are certain flowers which take
  many years coming to the point of bloom, they open, exhale a flood of
  incense, and in an hour wither. It is so with many. Even the astronomer has
  his blooming time. Then, after the honeymoon, the flower withers, the song
  ceases, the sunshine fades, and folds of the fog of common-place settle
  deeper than before.</p>

  <p>Ivan Turgenieff, the Russian novelist, says of love, "It is not an
  emotion, it is a malady, attacking soul and body. It is developed without
  rule, it cannot be reckoned with, it cannot be overreached. It lays hold of a
  man, without asking leave, like a fever or the cholera. It seizes on its prey
  as a falcon on a dove, and carries it, where it wills. There is no equality
  in love. The so-termed free inclination of souls towards each other is an
  idle dream of German professors, who have never loved. No! of two who love,
  one is the slave, the other is the lord, and not inaccurately have the poets
  told of the chains of love."</p>

  <p>But love when it does lay hold of a man assumes some features congruent to
  his natural habit. It is hardly tempestuous in a phlegmatic temperament, nor
  is a man of sanguine nature liable to be much influenced by calculations of
  material advantages. That calculations should form a constituent portion of
  the multiform web of a mathematician's passion is what we might
  anticipate.</p>

  <p>It will be interesting to see in a German professor devoted to the
  severest, most abstract and super-mundane of studies, the appearance, course,
  and dying away of the "malady" of love. We almost believe that this case is
  so easy of analysis that the very <i>bacillus</i> may be discovered.</p>

  <p>Before, however, we come to the story of Professor Maedler's love episode,
  we must say a word about his previous history.</p>

  <p>Maedler was born at Berlin on May 29th, 1794, in the very month of love,
  though at its extreme end. He began life as a schoolmaster, but soared in his
  leisure hours into a purer atmosphere than that of the schoolroom; he began
  to study the stars, and found them brighter and more interesting than the
  heads of his pupils.</p>

  <p>In 1828 William Beer, the Berlin banker, brother of the great composer,
  Meyerbeer, a Jew, built a small observatory in the suburbs of Berlin. He had
  made the acquaintance of Maedler, they had the same love of the stars, and
  they became close friends.</p>

  <p>The Beers were a gifted family, running out in different directions.
  Michael, a third brother, was a poet, and wrote tragedies, one or two of
  which occasionally reappear on the boards.</p>

  <p>The result of the nightly star gazings was an article on Mars when in
  opposition, with a drawing of the surface as it appeared to Beer and Maedler,
  through the telescope of the former.</p>

  <p>But Mars did not admit of much further scrutiny, it presented no more
  problems they were capable of solving, so they devoted themselves to the
  moon. A gourmand exists from dinner to dinner, that meal is the climax of his
  vitality, that past he lapses into inertness, indifference, quiescence. Full
  moon was the exciting moment of the periods in Maedler's life, which was
  divided, not like a gourmand's day, into periods of twenty-four hours, but
  into lunar months. When the moon began to show, Maedler began to live; his
  interest, the pulses of his life quickened as full moon approached, then
  declined and went to sleep when there was no lunar disc in the sky. From 1834
  to 1836 he issued his great map of the moon, and so made his name. But beyond
  that, in the summer of 1833 he was employed by the Russian Government on a
  chronometrical expedition in the Baltic.</p>

  <p>When his map came out, he was at once secured by the Prussian Government
  as assistant astronomer to the observatory at Berlin, recently erected. In
  1840 he became a professor, and was summoned to take charge of the
  observatory, and lecture on astronomy, in the Russian University of Dorpat.
  There he spent six uneventful years. He was unmarried, indifferent to female
  society, and as cold as his beloved moon. He was as solitary, as far removed
  from the ideas of love and matrimony, as the Man in the Moon.</p>

  <p>At last, one vacation time, he paid a long deferred visit to a friend, a
  Selenologist, at Gröningen, the University of the Kingdom of Hanover. Whilst
  smoking, drinking beer, and talking over the craters and luminous streaks in
  the moon, with his friend, who was also a professor, that gentleman drew his
  pipe from his mouth, blew a long spiral from between his lips, and then said
  slowly, "By the way, professor, are you aware that we have here, in this
  kingdom, not, indeed, in Gröningen, but in the town of Hanover, a lady, the
  wife of the Herr Councillor Witte, who is, like yourself, devoted to the
  moon; a lady, who spends entire nights on the roof of her house peering at
  the face of the moon through one end&mdash;the smaller&mdash;of her
  telescope, observing all the prominences, measuring their altitudes, and
  sounding all the cavities. Indeed, it is asserted that she studies the face
  and changes of the moon much more closely than the features and moods of her
  husband. Also, it is asserted, that when the moon is shining, the household
  duties are neglected, the dinners are bad, the maids&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"O dinners! maids! you need not consider them; there are always dinners
  and maids," said the Dorpat astronomer contemptuously, "but the moon is seen
  so comparatively rarely. The moon must be made much of when she shows.
  Everything must then be sacrificed to her."</p>

  <p>Dr. Maedler did not call the moon <i>she</i>, but <i>he</i>; however, we
  are writing in English, not in German, so we change the gender.</p>

  <p>The Astronomer Royal of the University of Gröningen went on, without
  noticing the interruption: "Frau von Witte has spent a good deal of her
  husband's money in getting the largest procurable telescope, and has built an
  observatory for it with a dome that revolves on cannon balls, on the top of
  her house. Whilst Herr von Witte slumbers and snores beneath, like a
  Philistine, his enlightened lady is aloft, studying the moon. The Frau
  Councilloress has done more than observe Luna, she has done more than you and
  Beer together, with your maps&mdash;she has modelled it."</p>

  <p>"Modelled it!&mdash;modelled the moon!&mdash;in what?"</p>

  <p>"In white wax."</p>

  <p>Professor Maedler's countenance fell. He had gained great renown, not in
  Germany only, but throughout Europe by his maps of the moon. Here was an
  unknown lady, as enthusiastic a devotee to the satellite as himself, who had
  surpassed him. "You see," continued the Hanoverian professor, "the idea is
  superb, the undertaking colossal. You have a fixed strong light, you make the
  wax moon to revolve on its axis, and you reproduce in the most surprising and
  exact manner, all the phases of the moon itself."</p>

  <p>This was indeed an idea. Maedler looked at his hands, his fingers. Would
  they be capable of modelling such a globe? Hardly, he had very broad coarse
  hands, and thick flat fingers, like paddles. He suddenly stood up.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter? Whither are you going?" asked his friend.</p>

  <p>"To Hanover, to Frau Witte, to see the wax moon." No persuasion would
  restrain him, he was in a selenological fever, he could not sleep, he could
  not eat, he could not read, he must see the wax moon.</p>

  <p>And now, pray observe the craft of Cupid. The professor was aged
  fifty-two. In vain had the damsels of Berlin and Dorpat set their caps at
  him. Not a blonde beauty of Saxon race with blue eyes had caught his fancy,
  not a dark Russian with large hazel eyes and thick black hair, had arrested
  his attention. His heart had been given to the cold, chaste Diana. It was,
  with him, the reverse of the tale of Endymion.</p>

  <p>He had written a treatise on the occultation of Mars, he had described the
  belts of Saturn, he had even measured his waist. Venus he had neglected, and
  now Cupid was about to avenge the slight passed on his mother. There was but
  one avenue by which access might be had to the professor's heart. The God of
  Love knew it, and resolved to storm the citadel through this avenue. Dr.
  Maedler packed his trunk himself in the way in which unmarried men and
  abstract thinkers do pack their portmanteaus. He bundled all his clothes in
  together, higglety-pigglety. The only bit of prudence he showed was to put
  the pomatum pot into a stocking. His collars he curled up in the legs of his
  boots. Copies of his astronomical pamphlets for presentation, lay in layers
  between his shirts. Then as the trunk would not close, the Professor of
  Astronomy sat down heavily on it, stood up, then sharply sat down on it
  again, and repeated this operation, till coats, trousers, linen, pamphlets,
  brushes and combs had been crushed together into one cohesive mass, and so
  the lock would fasten.</p>

  <p>No sooner was Dr. Maedler arrived at his inn in Hanover, and had dusted
  the collar of his coat, and revolved before the <i>garçon</i> who went over
  him with a clothes brush, revolved like the moon he loved, than he sallied
  forth in quest of the house of the Wittes. There was no mistaking
  it&mdash;with the domed observatory on the roof.</p>

  <p>Dr. Maedler stood in the square, looking up at it. The sight of an
  observatory touched him; and now, hard and dry as he was, moisture came into
  his eyes, as he thought that there, on that elevated station, an admirable
  woman spent her nights in the contemplation of the moon. What was Moses on
  Pisgah, viewing the Promised Land, what was Simeon Stylites braving storm and
  cold, to this spectacle?</p>

  <p>Never before had the astronomer met with one of the weaker sex who cared a
  button for the moon, <i>qua</i> moon, and not as a convenience for illumining
  lovers' meetings, or for an allusion in a valentine. Here was an heroic soul
  which surged, positively surged above the frivolities of her sex, one who
  aspired to be the rival of man in intelligence and love of scientific
  research.</p>

  <p>Professor Maedler sent in his card, and a letter of introduction from his
  friend at Gröningen, and was at once admitted. He had formed an ideal picture
  of the Selenographic lady, tall, worn with night watching, with an arched
  brow, large, clear eyes. He found her a fat little woman, with a face as
  round and as flat as that of the moon, not by any means pale, but red as the
  moon in a fog.</p>

  <p>The lady was delighted to make the acquaintance of so renowned an
  astronomer. She made him pretty speeches about his map, at the same time
  letting him understand that a map was all very well, but she knew of
  something better. Then she launched out into a criticism of his pamphlets on
  Mars and Saturn, on which, as it happened, he was then sitting. He had put a
  crumpled copy in each of his tail-coat pockets for an offering, and was now
  doubly crumpling them. Then she asked his opinion about the revolution and
  orbit of Biela's comet, which had been seen the preceding year. Next she
  carried him to Hencke's recently discovered planet, Astræa; after that she
  dashed away, away with him to the nebulæ, and sought to resolve them with his
  aid. Then down they whirled together through space to the sun, and the
  luminous red protuberances observable at an eclipse. Another step, and they
  were plunging down to earth, had reached it in safety, and were discussing
  Lord Rosse's recently erected telescope. It was like Dante and Beatrix, with
  this difference, that Maedler was not a poet, and Frau Witte was a married
  woman.</p>

  <p>The Professor was uneasy. Charming as is a telescope, delightful as is the
  sun, fascinating as Astræa may be, still, the moon, the moon was what he had
  come to discuss, and wax moon what he had come to see.</p>

  <p>So he exercised all his skill, and with great dialectic ability conducted
  his Beatrix away on another round. They gave the fixed stars a wide berth,
  dived in and out among the circling planets and planetoids without
  encountering one, avoided the comets, kept their feet off nebulous matter,
  and at last he planted his companion firmly on the moon, and when there,
  there he held her.</p>

  <p>To her words of commendation of his lunar map, he replied by expressing
  his astonishment at her knowledge of the several craters and so-called seas.
  Presently Frau Witte rose with a smile, and said, "Herr Professor, I may,
  perhaps, be allowed to exhibit a trifle on which I have been engaged for many
  years:&mdash;an independent work that I have compared with, but not copied
  from, your excellent selenic map."</p>

  <p>The doctor's heart fluttered; his eyes brightened; a hectic flush came
  into his cheeks.</p>

  <p>Frau Witte took a key and led the way to her study, where she threw open a
  mahogany cupboard, and exposed to view something very much like a meat cover.
  This also she removed, it was composed of the finest silk stretched on a
  frame, and exposed to view&mdash;the wax moon.</p>

  <p>The globe was composed of the purest white beeswax, it stood upon a steel
  needle that passed through it, and rested on pivots, so that the globe was
  held up and held firm, and could be easily made to revolve. Frau Witte closed
  the shutters, leaving open only one orifice through which the light could
  penetrate and fall on the wax ball.</p>

  <p>The doctor raised his hands in admiration. Never had he seen anything that
  so delighted him. The globe's surface had been most delicately manipulated.
  The mountains were pinched into peaks, the hollows indented to the requisite
  depth, the craters were rendered with extraordinary precision, the striæ
  being indicated by insertions of other tinted wax. A shadow hung sombre over
  the mysterious Sea of Storms.</p>

  <p>Professor Maedler returned to his hotel a prey to emotion. He inquired the
  address of a certain Rollmann, whom he had known in former years at Berlin,
  and who was now professor in the Polytechnic school at Hanover. Then he
  rushed off in quest of Rollmann. The Polytechnic Professor was delighted to
  see his friend, but disturbed at the condition of mind in which he found
  him.</p>

  <p>"What has brought you to Hanover, dear Professor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The moon! the moon! I have come after the moon."</p>

  <p>"The moon! How can that be? She shines over Dorpat as surely as over our
  roofs in Hanover."</p>

  <p>"I've just seen her."</p>

  <p>"Impossible. The moon is new. Besides, it is broad daylight."</p>

  <p>"New! of course she is new. Only made lately."</p>

  <p>Professor Rollman was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"The moon is certainly as old as the world, and even if we give the world
  so limited an age as four thousand years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was not allowed to touch her, scarcely to breathe near her,"
  interrupted Maedler.</p>

  <p>"My dear colleague, what is the matter with you? You are&mdash;what do you
  say, seen, touched, breathed on the moon? The distance of the moon from the
  earth is two hundred and forty thousand miles."</p>

  <p>"Not the old moon&mdash;I mean the other."</p>

  <p>"There is no other, that is, not another satellite to this world. I am
  well aware that Jupiter has four moons, two of which are smaller than the
  planet Mars. I know also that Mars&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Rollman, there is another&mdash;here in Hanover."</p>

  <p>"I give it up, I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>"Happy Hanover to possess such an unique treasure," continued the excited
  Maedler, "and such a woman as Frau Witte."</p>

  <p>"Oh! her wax moon!" said Rollmann, with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Of what else could I speak?"</p>

  <p>"So you have seen that. The old lady is very proud of her
  performance."</p>

  <p>"She has cause to be proud of it. It is simply superb."</p>

  <p>"And the sight of it has nearly sent you off your head!"</p>

  <p>"Rollmann! what will become of that model? Frau Councilloress Witte will
  not live for ever. She is old, puffy, and red, and might have apoplexy any
  day. Is her husband an astronomer?"</p>

  <p>"O dear no! he regards astronomy as as unprofitable a study as astrology.
  It is quite as expensive a pursuit, he says."</p>

  <p>"Merciful heavens! Suppose she were to predecease&mdash;he would have the
  moon, and be unable to appreciate it. He might let it get dusty, have the
  craters and seas choked; perhaps the mountain-tops knocked off. He must not
  have it."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be helped. The moon must take its chance."</p>

  <p>"It must not be. She <i>must</i> outlive the Councillor."</p>

  <p>"If you can manage that&mdash;well."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;supposing she does outlive him, she is not immortal. Some day
  she must die. Who will have the moon then?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose, her daughter."</p>

  <p>"What will the daughter do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Melt it up for waxing the floors."</p>

  <p>Professor Maedler uttered a cry of dismay.</p>

  <p>"The object is one of incalculable scientific value. Has the daughter no
  husband, a man of intelligence, to stay her hand?"</p>

  <p>"The daughter is unmarried. There was some talk of a theological
  candidate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A theological candidate! An embryo pastor! Just powers! These men are all
  obscurantists. He will melt up the moon thinking thereby to establish the
  authority of Moses."</p>

  <p>"That came to nothing. She is disengaged."</p>

  <p>Professor Maedler paced the room. Perspiration bedewed his brow. He wiped
  his forehead, more drops formed. Suddenly he stood still. "Rollmann," he
  said, in a hollow voice, "I must&mdash;I will have that moon, even if I have
  to marry the daughter to secure it."</p>

  <p>"By all means. Minna is a pleasant young lady."</p>

  <p>"Minna! Minna! is that her name?" asked the distracted professor; then,
  more coolly, "I do not care a rush what her name is. I want, not her, but the
  moon."</p>

  <p>"She is no longer in the bloom of early youth."</p>

  <p>"She is an exhausted world; a globe of volcanic cinder."</p>

  <p>"She is of real solid worth."</p>

  <p>"Solid&mdash;she is of solid wax&mdash;white beeswax."</p>

  <p>"If she becomes yours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will exhibit her at my lectures to the students."</p>

  <p>"As you are so much older, some provision will have to be made in the
  event of your death."</p>

  <p>"I will leave her to the Dorpat museum, with directions to the curator to
  keep the dust off her."</p>

  <p>"My dear Professor Maedler, I am speaking of the young lady, <i>you</i> of
  the moon."</p>

  <p>"Ah so! I had forgotten the incumbrance. Yes, I will marry the moon. I
  will carry her about with me, hug her in my arms, protect her most carefully
  from the fingers of the Custom House officers. I will procure an ukase from
  the Emperor to admit her unfingered over the frontier."</p>

  <p>"And Minna!"</p>

  <p>"What Minna?"</p>

  <p>"The young lady."</p>

  <p>"Ah so! She had slipped out of my reckoning. She shall watch the box
  whilst I sleep, and whilst she sleeps I will keep guard."</p>

  <p>"Be reasonable, Maedler. Do you mean, in sober earnest, to invite Minna
  Witte to be your wife?"</p>

  <p>"If I cannot get the moon any other way."</p>

  <p>"But you have not even seen her yet."</p>

  <p>"What does that matter? I have seen the moon."</p>

  <p>"And you are in earnest!"</p>

  <p>"I <i>will</i> have the moon."</p>

  <p>"Then, of course, you will have to propose."</p>

  <p>"I propose!"</p>

  <p>"And, of course, to make love."</p>

  <p>"I make love!"</p>

  <p>Professor Maedler's colour died away. He stood still before his friend,
  his pocket-handkerchief in hand, and stared.</p>

  <p>"I have not the remotest idea how to do it."</p>

  <p>"You must try."</p>

  <p>"I've had no experience. I am going on to fifty-three. As well ask me to
  dance on the trapeze. It is not proper. It is downright indecent."</p>

  <p>"Then you must do without the wax moon."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do without the wax moon."</p>

  <p>"Then, there is no help for it, you must make love to and propose to the
  fair Minna."</p>

  <p>"Friend," said the
  Russian-imperial-professor-of-astronomy-of-the-University-of-Dorpat, as he
  clasped Rollmann's hand. "You are experienced in the ways of the world. I
  have lived in an observatory, and associated only with fixed stars, revolving
  moons, and comets. Tell me how to do it, and I will obey as a lamb."</p>

  <p>"You will have to sigh."</p>

  <p>"O! I can do that."</p>

  <p>"And ogle the lady."</p>

  <p>"Ogle!&mdash;when going fifty-three!"</p>

  <p>"Learn a few lines of poetry."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Milton's Paradise Lost. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Tell the young lady that your heart is consumed with love."</p>

  <p>"Consumed with love, yes, go on."</p>

  <p>"Squeeze her hand."</p>

  <p>"I cannot! That I cannot!" gasped Professor Maedler. "Look at my whiskers.
  They are grey. There is a point beyond which I cannot go. Rollmann, why may I
  not settle it all with the mother, and let you court the young lady for me by
  proxy."</p>

  <p>"No, no, you must do it yourself."</p>

  <p>"I would not be jealous. Consider, I care nothing for the young girl. It
  is the moon I want. That you shall not touch or breathe on."</p>

  <p>"My dear Maedler, you and I are sure to be invited to dine with the family
  on Sunday. After dinner we will take a stroll in the garden. During dinner
  mind and be attentive to Miss Minna, and feed her with honeyed words. When we
  visit the garden I will tackle the mother, as Mephistopheles engages Martha,
  and you, you gay Faust, will have to be the gallant to Minna."</p>

  <p>"My good Rollmann! I dislike the simile. It offends me. Consider my age,
  my whiskers, my position at the Dorpat University, my map of the moon in four
  sheets, my paper on the occultation of Mars."</p>

  <p>"Pay attention to me, if you want your wax globe. Frau Witte, the
  Councillor and I will sit drinking coffee in the arbour. You ask Minna to
  show you the garden. When you are gone I will begin at once with the mother,
  praise you, and say how comfortably you are provided for at Dorpat, laud your
  good qualities, and bring her to understand that you are a suitor for the
  hand of her daughter. Meanwhile press your cause with ardour."</p>

  <p>"With ardour! I shall not be able to get up any warmth."</p>

  <p>"Think of the wax moon! direct your raptures to that."</p>

  <p>"This is all very well," said Maedler fretfully, "but you have forgotten
  the main thing. I know you will make a mistake. You have asked for the hand
  of the daughter, and said nothing about the moon."</p>

  <p>"Do not be concerned."</p>

  <p>"But I am concerned. It would be a pretty mischief if I got the daughter's
  hand instead of the face of the moon."</p>

  <p>"I will manage that you have what you want. But the moon must not rise
  over the matrimonial scene till the preliminaries are settled. I will
  represent to the old lady what credit will accrue to her if her moon be
  exhibited and lectured on at the Dorpat University by so distinguished an
  astronomer as yourself. Then, be well assured, she will give you the wax moon
  along with her daughter."</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will do what I can. Only, further, explain to me the whole
  process, that I may learn it by heart. It seems to me as knotty to a beginner
  as Euler's proof of the Binomial Theorem."</p>

  <p>"It is very easy. Pay attention. You must begin to talk about the
  fascination which a domestic life exerts on you; you then say that the sight
  of such an united household as that in which you find yourself influences you
  profoundly."</p>

  <p>"I see. Causes a deflection in my perihelion. That deflection is
  calculable, the force excited calculable, the position of the attractive body
  estimable. I direct my telescope in the direction, and discover&mdash;Minna.
  Put astronomically, I can understand it."</p>

  <p>"But you must <i>not</i> put it astronomically to her. Paint in glowing
  tints the charms of the domestic hearth&mdash;that is to say, of the stove.
  Touch sadly on your forlorn condition, your unloved heart&mdash;are you
  paying attention, or thinking of the moon?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I was thinking of myself, from a planetary point of
  view. I see, a wife is a satellite revolving round her man. I see it all now.
  Jupiter has four."</p>

  <p>"Sigh; let the corners of your mouth droop. Throw, if you can, an
  emotional vibration into your tones, and say that hitherto life has been to
  you a school, where you have been set hard tasks; not a home. Here shake your
  head slowly, drop a tear if you can, and say again, in a low and thrilling
  voice, 'Not a home!' Now for the poetry. Till now, you add, you have looked
  into the starry vault&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not a vault at all."</p>

  <p>"Never mind; say this. Till now you have looked into the starry vault for
  your heaven, and not dreamed that a heaven full of peaceful lights was
  twinkling invitingly about your feet. That is poetical, is it not? It must
  succeed."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, I should never have thought of it."</p>

  <p>"Then turn, and look into Miss Minna's eyes."</p>

  <p>"But suppose she is looking in another direction?"</p>

  <p>"She will not be. A lady is always ready to help a stumbling lover over
  the impediments in the way of a declaration. She will have her eyes at
  command, ready to meet yours."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"You will presently come to a rose tree. You must stop there and be
  silent. Then you must admire the roses, and beg Miss Minna to present you
  with one."</p>

  <p>"But I do not want any roses. What can I do with them? I am lodging at an
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, you <i>must</i> want one. When she has picked and offered
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But perhaps she will not."</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks! Of course she will. Then take the rose, press your lips to
  it, and burst forth into raptures."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, how am I to do the raptures?"</p>

  <p>"Think of the wax moon, man. Exclaim, 'Oh that I might take the fair
  Minna, fairer than this rose, to my heart, as I apply this flower to my
  buttonhole!'"</p>

  <p>"Shall I say nothing about the wax moon?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. Leave me to manage that."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"Then she will look down, confused, at the gravel, and stammer. Press her
  for a Yes or No. Promise to destroy yourself if she says No. Take her hand
  and squeeze it."</p>

  <p>"Must I squeeze it? About how much pressure to the square-foot should I
  apply?"</p>

  <p>"Then say, 'Come, let us go to your parents, and obtain their blessing.'
  The thing is done."</p>

  <p>"But suppose she were to say No?"</p>

  <p>Rollmann stamped with impatience. "I tell you she will not say No, now
  that the theological candidate has dropped through."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Professor Maedler, "I must go along with it, now I have made
  up my mind to it. But, on my word, as an exact reasoner, I had no idea of the
  difficulties men have to go through to get married. Why, the calculation of
  the deflections of the planets is nothing to it. And the Grand Turk, like
  Jupiter, has more satellites than one!"</p>

  <p>A few months after the incident above recorded Professor Maedler returned
  to Dorpat, not alone; with him was the Frau Professorinn&mdash;Minna.
  Everything had gone off in the garden as Rollmann had planned.</p>

  <p>The moon and Minna, or Minna and the moon, put it which way you will, were
  secured.</p>

  <p>When the Professor arrived at Dorpat with his wife, the students gave him
  an ovation after the German style, that is to say, they organized a
  Fackel-zug, or torch-light procession.</p>

  <p>Three hundred young men, some wearing white caps, some green caps, some
  red, and some purple, marched along the street headed by a band, bearing
  torches of twisted tow steeped in tar, blazing and smoking, or, to be more
  exact, smoking and blazing. Each corps was followed by a hired droschky, in
  which sat the captain and stewards of the white, red, green, or purple corps,
  with sashes of their respective colours. Behind the last corps followed the
  elephants, two and two. By elephants is not meant the greatest of quadrupeds,
  but the smallest esteemed of the students, those who belong to no corps.</p>

  <p>The whole procession gathered before the house of the Professor, and
  brandished their torches and cheered. Then the glass door opening on the
  balcony was thrown back, and the Professor John Henry Maedler appeared on the
  balcony leading forth his wife. The astronomer looked younger than he had
  been known to look for the last twenty years. His whiskers in the torchlight
  looked not grey, but red. The eyes, no longer blear with star-gazing, watered
  with sentiment. His expression was no longer that of a man troubled with
  integral calculus, but of a man in an ecstasy. He waved his hand. Instantly
  the cheers subsided. "My highly-worthy-and-ever-to-be-honoured sirs," began
  the Professor, "this is a moment never to be forgotten. It sends a
  <i>fackel-zug</i> of fiery emotion through every artery and vein.
  Highly-worthy-and-ever-to-be-honoured sirs, I am not so proud as to suppose
  that this reception is accorded to me alone. It is an ovation offered to my
  highly-beloved-and-evermore-to-be-beloved-and-respected consort, Frau Minna
  Maedler, born Witte, the daughter of a distinguished lady, who, like myself,
  has laboured on Selenography, and loved Selenology.
  Highly-worthy-and-ever-to-be-respected sirs, when I announce to you that I
  have returned to Dorpat to endow that
  most-eminent-and-ever-to-become-more-eminent-University with one of the most
  priceless treasures of art the world has ever seen, a monument of infinite
  patience and exact observation; I mean a wax moon; I am sure I need only
  allude to the fact to elicit your unbounded enthusiasm. But,
  highly-worthy-and-ever-to-be-honoured sirs, allow me to assure you that my
  expedition to Hanover has not resulted in a gain to the highly eminent
  University of Dorpat only, but to me, individually as well.</p>

  <p>"That highly-eminent-and-evermore-to-become-more-eminent University is now
  enriched through my agency with a moon of wax, but I&mdash;I,
  sirs&mdash;excuse my emotion, I have also been enriched with a moon, not of
  wax, but of honey. The wax moon, gentlemen, may it last undissolved as long
  as the very-eminent-and-evermore-to-become-more-eminent University of Dorpat
  lasts. The honey moon, gentlemen, with which I have been blessed, I feel
  assured will expand into a lifetime, at least will last also undissolved as
  long as Minna and I exist."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE ELECTRESS'S PLOT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony reigned only a few
  weeks, from October 5th to December 13, 1763; in his forty-first year he died
  of small-pox. He never had enjoyed rude health. The mother of the unfortunate
  prince, Marie Josepha of Austria, was an exceedingly ugly, but prolific lady,
  vastly proud of her Hapsburg descent. The three first children followed each
  other with considerable punctuality, but the two first, both sons, died
  early. Frederick Christian was the third. The Electress, a few months before
  his birth, was hunting, when a deer that had been struck, turned to her,
  dragging its broken legs behind it. This produced a powerful impression on
  her mind; and when her son was born, he was found to be a cripple in his
  legs. His head and arms were well formed, but his spine was twisted, and his
  knees, according to the English ambassador, Sir Charles Williams&mdash;were
  drawn up over his stomach. He could not stand, and had to be lifted about
  from place to place. At the age of five-and-twenty he had been married to
  Maria Antonia, daughter of the Elector of Bavaria, afterwards the Emperor
  Charles VII.</p>

  <p>His brother, Francis Xavier, was a sturdy fellow, like his father, and the
  Electress mother tried very hard to get Frederick Christian to resign his
  pretentions in favour of his brother, and take holy orders. This he refused
  to do, and was then married to Maria Antonia, aged twenty-three. Her mother
  had also been an Austrian princess, Amalia, and also remarkable for her
  ugliness. The choice was not happy, it brought about a marriage between
  cousins, and an union of blood that was afflicted with ugliness and infirmity
  of body.</p>

  <p>Maria Antonia had not only inherited her mother's ugliness, but was
  further disfigured with small-pox. She was small of stature, but of a
  resolute will, and of unbounded ambition. English tourists liked her, they
  said that she laid herself out to make the Court of Dresden agreeable to
  them. Wraxall tells a good story of her, which shows a certain frankness, not
  to say coarseness in her conversation&mdash;a story we will not
  reproduce.</p>

  <p>She had already made her personality felt at the Bavarian Court. Shortly
  after the death of her father, in imitation of Louisa Dorothea, Duchess of
  Gotha, she had founded an "Order of Friendship, or the Society of the Incas."
  The founding of the Order took place one fine spring day on a gondola in the
  canal at Nymphenburg. Her brother, the Elector of Bavaria, was instituted a
  member, the Prince of Fürstenberg was made chancellor, and was given the
  custody of the seal of the confraternity which had as its legend "La fidelité
  mêne." The badge of the Order was a gold ring on the little finger of the
  left hand, with the inscription, "L'ordre de l'amitié&mdash;Maria Antonia."
  Each member went by a name descriptive of his character, or of that virtue he
  or she was supposed to represent. Thus the chancellor was called "Le
  Solide."</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Williams says that on the very first night of her appearance
  in Dresden she made an attempt to force herself into a position for which she
  had no right; to the great annoyance of the King of Poland (Augustus, Elector
  of Saxony).</p>

  <p>At Dresden, she favoured the arts, especially music and painting. She
  became the patroness of the family Mengs. She sang, and played on the piano,
  and indeed composed a couple of operas, "Thalestris" and "Il trionfo della
  fidelita," and the former was actually put on the stage. Sir Charles Williams
  in 1747 wrote that, in spite of her profession that in her eyes no woman
  ought to meddle in the affairs of state, he ventured to prophecy, she would
  rule the whole land in the name of her unfortunate husband.</p>

  <p>Nor was he wrong. The moment that her father-in-law died, she put her hand
  on the reins. She was not likely to meet with resistance from her husband, he
  was not merely a cripple in body, but was contracted in his intellect; he was
  amiable, but weak and ignorant. Sir Charles Williams says that he once asked
  at table whether it was not possible to reach England by
  land&mdash;<i>although</i> it was an island.</p>

  <p>Frederick Christian began to reign on 5th October 1763, and immediately
  orders were given for the increase of the army to 50,000 men. Maria Antonia
  was bent on becoming a queen, and for this end she must get her husband
  proclaimed like his father, King of Poland. She was allied to all the Courts
  of Europe, her agreeable manners, her energy, gained her friends in all
  quarters. She felt herself quite capable of wearing a royal crown, and she
  wrote to all the courts to urge the claims of her husband, the Elector,
  when&mdash;the unfortunate cripple was attacked by small-pox, had a stroke,
  and died December 17th. Small-pox had carried off his ancestor John George
  IV., and in that same century it occasioned the death of his brother-in-law,
  Max Joseph of Bavaria, and of the Emperor Joseph I.</p>

  <p>He left behind him four sons, his successor, Frederick Augustus, and the
  three other princes, Charles, his mother's favourite, Anthony, and Maximilian
  Joseph, the third of whom died the same year as his father. He had also two
  daughters.</p>

  <p>The death of her husband was a severe blow to the ambition of the
  Electress; her eldest son, Frederick Augustus, was under age, and the reins
  of government were snatched from her hands and put into those of the uncle of
  the young Elector, Xavier, who had been his mother's favourite, and in favour
  of whom his elder brother had been urged to resign his pretensions. Xavier
  was appointed administrator of Saxony, and acted as such for five years.</p>

  <p>When, at the age of eighteen, Frederick Augustus III. assumed the power,
  he endeavoured to fulfil his duties with great diligence and
  conscientiousness, and allowed of no interference. He had, indeed, his
  advisers, but these were men whom he selected for himself from among those
  who had been well tried and who had proved themselves trusty.</p>

  <p>The Electress-mother had, during the administration of Prince Xavier,
  exercised some little authority; she now suddenly found herself deprived of
  every shred. Her son was too firm and self-determined to admit of her
  interference. Moody and dissatisfied, she left Dresden and went to Potsdam to
  Frederick II., in 1769, apparently to feel the way towards the execution of a
  plan that was already forming in her restless brain. She does not seem to
  have met with any encouragement, and she then started for Italy, where she
  visited Rome in 1772, and sought Mengs out, whose artistic talents had been
  fostered under her care.</p>

  <p>Under the administration of Prince Xavier, the Electress Dowager had
  received an income of sixty thousand dollars; after her son had mounted the
  throne, her appanage was doubled, more than doubled, for she was granted
  130,000 dollars, and in addition her son gave her a present of 500,000
  dollars. This did not satisfy her, for she had no notion of cutting her coat
  according to her cloth, she would everywhere maintain a splendid court.
  Moreover, she was bitten with the fever of speculation. The year before her
  son came of age and assumed the power, she had erected a great cotton factory
  at Grossenhain, but as it brought her in no revenue, and cost her money
  besides, she was glad to dispose of it in 1774. The visitor to Dresden almost
  certainly knows the Bavarian tavern at the end of the bridge leading into
  Little Dresden. It is a tavern now mediævalised, with panelled walls, bull's
  eye glass in the windows, old German glass and pottery&mdash;even an old
  German kalendar hanging from the walls, and with a couple of pretty Bavarian
  Kellnerins in costume, to wait on the visitor. There also in the evening
  Bavarian minstrels jodel, and play the zither.</p>

  <p>This Bavarian tavern was established by the Electress Mother, who thought
  that the Saxons did not drink good or enough beer, and must be supplied with
  that brewed in her native land.</p>

  <p>But this speculation also failed, and her capital of five hundred thousand
  dollars was swallowed up to the last farthing, and to meet her creditors she
  was obliged to pawn her diamond necklace and the rest of her jewels. This
  happened in Genoa. When her allowance came in again she redeemed her jewelry,
  but in 1775 had to pawn it again in Rome. Unable to pay her debts, and in
  distress for money, she appealed repeatedly, but in vain, to her son.</p>

  <p>Frederick Augustus was, like his father, of feeble constitution, and
  moreover, as he himself complained later on in life, had been at once spoiled
  and neglected in his youth; and he was unable through weakness to ascend a
  height. He did not walk or ride, but went about in a carriage. The January
  (1769) after he came to the Electoral crown, he married Amelia Augusta of
  Zweibrücken, sister of Max Joseph, afterwards first King of Bavaria. She was
  only seventeen at the time.</p>

  <p>The favourite son of his mother was Charles. This prince had been hearty
  and in full possession of his limbs in his early age, but when he reached the
  years of eleven or twelve, he became crippled and doubled up like his father.
  Wraxal says that beside him Scarron would have passed as a beauty. He was so
  feeble and paralysed that he could only be moved about on a wheeled chair. He
  died in 1781. His elder brother, the Elector, though not a vigorous man, was
  not a cripple.</p>

  <p>One of the attendant gentry on the Electress Mother, in Rome, was the
  Marquis Aloysius Peter d'Agdolo, son of the Saxon Consul in Venice, Colonel
  of the Lifeguard, and Adjutant General to Prince Xavier whilst he was
  Administrator.</p>

  <p>Agdolo advised the Electress Mother to raise money to meet her
  difficulties by selling to her son, the Elector, her claims on the Bavarian
  inheritance. Her brother, Maximilian Joseph, was without children; and the
  nearest male claimant to the Electoral Crown of Bavaria was the Count
  Palatine of Sulzbach, only remotely connected. It was, therefore, quite
  possible that Bavaria might fall to a sister. Now on the death of her
  brother, the Dowager Electress of Saxony certainly intended to advance her
  claims against any remote kinsman hailing through a common ancestor two
  centuries ago. But whether she would be able to enforce her claim was another
  matter. She might sell it to her son, who would have the means of advancing
  his claim by force of arms and gold. This was in 1776. Maria Antonia was
  delighted with the scheme and at once hastened to Munich to put it in
  execution, taking with her all her diamonds which she had managed to redeem
  from pawn.</p>

  <p>Whilst she was on her way to Munich, Agdolo was despatched to Dresden, to
  open the negociation with her son, not only for the transference of her
  rights on Bavaria, but also for the pawning of her diamonds, to her son.</p>

  <p>She had urgent need of money, and in her extremity she conceived an
  audacious scheme to enable her at the same time to get hold of the money, and
  to retain her rights on Bavaria. The plan was this:&mdash;As soon as she had
  got the full payment from the Elector for the resignation of her claims in
  his favour, she had resolved suddenly to proclaim to the world that he was no
  son at all of the late Elector Frederick Christian&mdash;that he was a
  bastard, smuggled into the palace and passed off as the son of the Elector,
  much as, according to Whig gossip, James the Pretender was smuggled into the
  palace of James II. in a warming pan, and passed off as of blood royal, when
  he was of base origin.</p>

  <p>Frederick Augustus thus declared to be no son of the House of Saxony, the
  Electoral crown would come to her favourite son Charles, who was a cripple.
  The Elector was not deformed&mdash;evidence against his origin; Charles was
  doubled up and distorted&mdash;he was certainly the true son of the late
  Elector, and the legitimate successor.</p>

  <p>If Maria Antonia should succeed&mdash;she would rule Saxony in the name,
  and over the head of her unfortunate son Charles, and her rights on Bavaria
  would not have been lost or made away with.</p>

  <p>Arrived in Munich, she confided the whole plan to her ladies-in-waiting.
  She told them her hopes, her confidence in Agdolo, who was gone to Dresden to
  negociate the sale, and who was thoroughly aware of her intentions.</p>

  <p>Agdolo, as all the ladies knew, was a great rascal. He had been pensioned
  by Prince Xavier with six hundred dollars per annum, and he had what he
  received from the Electress Mother as her gentleman-in-waiting. He was
  married to the Princess Lubomirska, widow of Count Rutowska, had quarrelled
  with her, and they lived separate, but he had no scruple to receive of an
  insulted wife an annual allowance. All these sources of income were
  insufficient to meet his expenses; and no one who knew him doubted for a
  moment that he would lend himself to any intrigue which would promise him
  wealth and position. The plot of the Dowager Electress was a risky
  one&mdash;but, should it succeed, his fortune was assured.</p>

  <p>At Dresden he was well received by the Elector; and Frederick Augustus at
  once accepted the proposition of his mother. He consented to purchase Maria
  Antonia's resignation in his favour of her claims on the allodial inheritance
  of the family on the extinction of the Bavarian Electoral house in the male
  line, and to pay all her debts, and to find a sum sufficient to redeem the
  diamonds, which were represented as still in pawn at Rome.</p>

  <p>Maria Antonia and her confidant appeared to be on the eve of success, when
  the plan was upset, from a quarter in which they had not dreamed of danger.
  Among the ladies of the court of the Dowager Electress was one whose name
  does not transpire, who seems to have entertained an ardent passion for
  Agdolo. He, however, disregarded her, and paid his attentions to another of
  the ladies. Rage and jealousy consumed the heart of this slighted beauty, and
  when the Electress Mother confided to her the plan she had formed, the
  lady-in-waiting saw that her opportunity had arrived for the destruction of
  the man who had slighted her charms. She managed to get hold of her mistress'
  keys and to make a transcript of her papers, wherein the whole plan was
  detailed, also of copies of her letters to Agdolo, and of the Marquis's
  letters to her. When she had these, she at once despatched them&mdash;not to
  the Elector of Saxony, but to Frederick II. at Berlin, who stood in close
  relations of friendship with the Elector of Saxony. She had reckoned aright.
  Such tidings, received through the Court of Prussia, would produce a far
  deeper impression on Frederick Augustus, than if received from her unknown
  and insignificant self. It is possible also that she may have known of her
  mistress having been at Berlin and there thrown out hints of something of the
  sort, so that Frederick II. would at once recognise in this matured plan the
  outcome of the vague hints of mischief poured out at Potsdam a few years
  before.</p>

  <p>All was going on well at Berlin. Adolphus von Zehmen, Electoral Treasurer,
  had already started for Munich, furnished with the requisite sums. He was
  empowered to receive the deed of relinquishment from the Dowager Electress,
  and also her diamond necklace, which, in the meantime, was to be brought by a
  special courier from Rome. Maria Antonia, on her side, had constituted
  Councillor Hewald her plenipotentiary; she wrote to say that he would
  transact all the requisite negociation with the Treasurer Zehmen, and that
  the diamond necklace had arrived and was in his hands.</p>

  <p>Agdolo received orders from the Electress Mother on no account to leave
  Dresden till the middle of September, 1776, lest his departure should arouse
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>The conduct of the Marquis was not in any way remarkable, he moved about
  among old friends with perfect openness, often appeared in Court, and was
  satisfied that he was perfectly safe. He was not in the least aware that all
  his proceedings were watched and reported on, not by order of the Elector,
  but of his own mistress, who received regular reports from this emissary as
  to the behaviour and proceedings of the Marquis, so that she was able to
  compare with this private report that sent her by Agdolo, and so satisfy
  herself whether he was acting in her interest, or playing a double game.</p>

  <p>This bit of cunning on her part, was not surprising, considering what a
  man Agdolo was, and, as we shall see, it proved of great advantage to her,
  but in a way she least expected.</p>

  <p>The Marchese d'Agdolo had paid his farewell visit to the Elector, and
  received leave to depart. Frederick Augustus had not the remotest suspicion
  that his mother was playing a crooked part, and he seemed heartily satisfied
  with the negociation, and made the Marquis a present.</p>

  <p>On September 15, 1776, Agdolo was intending to start from Dresden, on his
  return to Munich, and the evening before leaving he spent at the house of a
  friend, Ferber, playing cards. Little did he suspect that whilst he was
  winning one stake after another at the table, the greatest stake of all was
  lost. That evening, whilst he was playing cards, a courier arrived from
  Berlin, in all haste, and demanded to see the Elector in person, instantly,
  as he had a communication of the utmost importance to make from Frederick II.
  He was admitted without delay, and the whole of his mother's plot was
  detailed before the astonished Elector.</p>

  <p>"The originals of these transcripts," said the courier, "are in the hands
  of the Marchese d'Agdolo, let him be arrested, and a comparison of the
  documents made."</p>

  <p>The Privy Council was at once assembled, and the papers received from
  Frederick II. were laid before it. The members voted unanimously that the
  Marquis should be arrested, and General Schiebell was entrusted with the
  execution of the decree. No surprise was occasioned by the entry of General
  Schiebell into the house of Ferber. It was a place of resort of the best
  society in Dresden; but when the General announced that he had come to make
  an arrest, many cheeks lost their colour.</p>

  <p>"In the name of his Serene Highness the Elector," said the General, "I
  make this man my prisoner," and he laid his hand on the shoulder of Agdolo,
  who had served under him in the Seven Years' War. He was taken at once to his
  own lodgings, where his desks and boxes&mdash;already packed for
  departure&mdash;were opened, and all his papers removed. The same night,
  under a strong guard, he was transported at 10 o'clock, to Königstein. In
  that strong fortress and state prison, perched on an isolated limestone crag,
  the rest of his life was to be spent in confinement.</p>

  <p>But the Marchese, like a crafty Italian, had made his preparations against
  something of the sort; for among his papers was found a communication
  addressed by him to the Elector, revealing the whole plot. It was undated. If
  the search of his rooms and the discovery of his papers had been made
  earlier, the Elector might have believed that the man had really intended to
  betray his mistress, but, he had postponed the delivery of the communication
  too late.[17]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[17] This is supposed to have been the contents of the
  packet addressed to the Elector, the contents have never been revealed.</p>

  <p>A few days later, the Marchese received a sealed letter from the Elector;
  and he was treated in his prison without undue severity; his pension was not
  withdrawn; and the Elector seems never to have quite made up his mind whether
  Agdolo really intended to make him aware of the plot at the last minute, or
  to go on with the plan after his mistress's orders.</p>

  <p>After some years, when Agdolo began to suffer in his chest, he was allowed
  to go to the baths of Pirna, under a guard. His wife never visited him in
  prison. She died, however, only two years later, in 1778, at the age of
  fifty-six. Agdolo lived on for twenty-three years and a half, and died August
  27, 1800. All his papers were then sent to Frederick Augustus III., who read
  them, dissolved into tears, and burnt them.</p>

  <p>We must return for a moment to Munich. No sooner had the emissary of the
  Electress Mother heard of the news of the arrest of Agdolo, than he hastened
  to Munich with post horses as hard as he could fly over the roads. Maria
  Antonia, when she heard the news, at once made fresh dispositions. She sent
  word that same night to Hewald to make off, and in another half hour he had
  disappeared with the diamonds.</p>

  <p>Next day the completion of the resignation of claims was to be made. The
  Electress Mother requested the Treasurer Zehmen to go to the dwelling of her
  Councillor Hewald, who, as we can understand, was not to be found anywhere.
  Herr von Zehmen was much surprised and disconcerted, and the Dowager
  Electress affected extreme indignation and distress, charging her
  plenipotentiary with having robbed her of her diamonds, and bolted with them.
  Then she took to her bed, and pretended to be dangerously ill. Next day the
  news reached Zehmen of what had occurred at Dresden, and with the news came
  his recall. She saw the treasurer before his departure, and implored him to
  get both Agdolo and Hewald arrested and punished, because, as she declared,
  they had between them fabricated a wicked plot for her robbery and ruin.</p>

  <p>Hewald went to Frankfort with the jewels, where he was stopped and taken
  by an officer of Frederick Augustus, and brought on Jan. 27, 1777, to
  Dresden. He was sent to the Königstein, but was released in 1778.</p>

  <p>In 1777 died the Elector of Bavaria, but his sister was unable to obtain
  any recognition of her claims; and she died 23rd April, 1780, without any
  reconciliation with the eldest son. Next year died her favourite son, the
  cripple, Charles.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; SUESS OPPENHEIM</h2>

  <p class="first">ON December 16th, 1733, Charles Alexander, Duke of
  Würtemberg, entered Stuttgart in state. It was a brilliant though brief
  winter day. The sun streamed out of a cloudless heaven on the snowy roofs of
  the old town, and the castle park trees frosted as though covered with
  jewels. The streets were hung with tapestries, crimson drapery, and wreaths
  of artificial flowers. Peasants in their quaint costume poured in from all
  the country round to salute their new prince. From the old castle towers
  floated the banners of the Duchy and the Empire&mdash;for Würtemberg three
  stag-horns quartered with the Hohenstauffen black lions. The Duke was not
  young: he was hard on fifty&mdash;an age when a man has got the better of
  youthful impetuosity and regrets early indiscretions&mdash;an age at which,
  if a man has stuff in him, he is at his best.</p>

  <p>The land of Würtemberg is a favoured and smiling land. At the period of
  which we write, it was not so ample as the present kingdom, but fruitful,
  favoured, and called the Garden of the Empire. For twenty years this Duchy
  had been badly governed; the inhabitants had been cruelly oppressed by the
  incompetent Duke Eberhardt Ludwig, or rather by his favourites. The country
  was burdened with debt; the treasury was exhausted. It had, as it were, lain
  under winter frost for twenty years and more, and now though on a winter day
  laughed and bloomed with a promise of spring.</p>

  <p>And every good Würtemberger had a right to be glad and proud of the new
  duke, who had stormed Belgrade under Prince Eugene, and was held to be one of
  the bravest, noblest minded, and most generous of the German princes of his
  time.</p>

  <p>As he rode through the streets of Stuttgart all admired his stately form,
  his rich fair hair flowing over his shoulders, his bright commanding eye, and
  the pleasant smile on his lip; every Würtemberger waved his hat, and shouted,
  and leaped with enthusiasm. Now at last the Garden of Germany would blossom
  and be fruitful under so noble a duke.</p>

  <p>But in the same procession walked, not rode, another man whom none
  regarded&mdash;a handsome man with dark brown hair and keen olive eyes, a
  sallow complexion, and a finely moulded Greek nose. He had a broad forehead
  and well arched brows. He was tall, and had something noble and commanding in
  his person and manner. But his most remarkable feature was the
  eye&mdash;bright, eager, ever restless.</p>

  <p>This man, whom the Würtembergers did not observe, was destined to play a
  terrible and tragic part in their history&mdash;to be the evil genius of the
  duke and of the land. His name was Joseph Suess Oppenheim.</p>

  <p>Joseph's mother, Michaela, a Jewess, had been a woman of extraordinary
  beauty, the only child of the Rabbi Salomon of Frankfort. She had been
  married when quite young to the Rabbi Isachar Suess Oppenheim, a singer.
  Joseph was born at Heidelberg in 1692, and was her child by the Baron George
  of Heydersdorf, a soldier who had distinguished himself in the Turkish war,
  and with whom she carried on a guilty intrigue. From his father Joseph Suess
  derived a dignified, almost military bearing, and his personal beauty from
  his mother.</p>

  <p>The Baron's romance with the lovely Jewess came to an end in 1693, when he
  held the castle of Heidelberg against the French. He surrendered after a
  gallant defence; too soon, however, as the court-martial held on him decided;
  and he was sentenced to death, but was pardoned by the Emperor Leopold, with
  the loss of all his honours and offices, and he was banished the Empire.</p>

  <p>Suess had a sister who married a rich Jew of Vienna, but followed her
  mother in laxity of morals, and, after having wasted a good fortune in
  extravagance, fell back on her mother and brother for a maintenance. He had a
  brother who became a factor at the court of Darmstadt. They lived on bad
  terms with each other, and were engaged in repeated lawsuits with one
  another. This brother abjured Judaism, was baptised, and assumed the name of
  Tauffenberg. Joseph Suess was connected, or nominally connected, through
  Isachar, his reputed though not his real father, with the great and wealthy
  Jewish family of Oppenheim. The branch established in Vienna had become rich
  on contracts for the army, and had been ennobled. One member failed because
  the Emperor Leopold I. owed him many millions of dollars and was unable to
  pay. Joseph began life in the office of the court bankers and army
  contractors of his family at Vienna. Here it was that he obtained his first
  ideas of how money could be raised through lotteries, monopolies, and imposts
  of all kinds. But though Joseph was put on the road that led to wealth, in
  the Oppenheim house at Vienna, he missed his chance there, and was dismissed
  for some misconduct or other, the particulars of which we do not know.</p>

  <p>Then, in disgrace and distress, he came to Bavaria, where he served a
  while as barber's assistant. Probably through the influence of some of the
  Oppenheims, Joseph was introduced into the court of the family of Thurn and
  Taxis, which had acquired vast wealth through the monopoly of the
  post-office. Thence he made his way into an office of the palatine court at
  Mannheim.</p>

  <p>This was a period in which the German princes were possessed with the
  passion of imitating the splendour and extravagance of Louis XIV. Everyone
  must have his Versailles, must crowd his court with functionaries, and
  maintain armies in glittering and showy uniforms.</p>

  <p>Germany, to the present day, abounds in vast and magnificent palaces, for
  the most part in wretched repair, if not ruinous. The houses of our English
  nobility are nothing as compared in size with these palaces of petty princes,
  counts, and barons.</p>

  <p>To build these mansions, and when built to fill them with officials and
  servants, to keep up their armies, and to satisfy the greed of their
  mistresses, these German princes needed a good deal of money, and were ready
  to show favour to any man who could help them to obtain it&mdash;show where
  to bore to tap fresh financial springs. All kinds of new methods of taxation
  were had recourse to, arousing the bitter mockery of the oppressed. The
  tobacco monopoly was called the nose-tax; it was felt to be oppressive only
  by the snuff-takers and smokers; and perhaps the stamp on paper only by those
  who wrote; but the boot and shoe stamp imposed by one of the little princes
  touched everyone but those who went barefoot.</p>

  <p>Joseph Suess introduced the stamp on paper into the palatinate. He did not
  invent this duty, which had been imposed elsewhere; but he obtained the
  concession of the impost, and sold it to a subfactor for 12,000 florins, and
  with the money invested in a speculation in the coinage of Hesse-Darmstadt.
  All the little German princes at this time had their own coinage, down to
  trumpery little states of a few miles in diameter, as Waldeck, Fulda,
  Hechingen, and Montfort; and Germany was full to overflow of bad money, and
  barren of gold and silver. Suess, in his peregrinations, had obtained a
  thorough insight into the mysteries of this branch of business. He not only
  thoroughly understood the practical part of the matter&mdash;the
  coinage&mdash;but also where the cheapest markets were, in which to purchase
  the metals to be coined. Now that he had some money at his command, he
  undertook to farm the coinage of Hesse-Darmstadt; but almost immediately
  undersold it, with a profit to himself of 9,000 florins. He took other
  contracts for the courts, and soon realised a comfortable fortune. Even the
  Archbishop of Cologne called in his aid, and contributed to enrich him, in
  his efforts to get a little more for himself out of the subjects of his
  palatinate. In the summer of 1732 Joseph Suess visited the Blackforest baths
  of Wildbad, for the sake of the waters. At the same time Charles Alexander of
  Würtemberg and his wife were also undergoing the same cure. Oppenheim's
  pleasant manners, his handsome face, and his cleverness caught the fancy of
  Charles Alexander, and he appointed him his agent and steward; and as the
  Prince was then in want of money, Suess lent him a trifle of 2,000 florins.
  Charles Alexander had not at this time any assurance that he would ascend the
  ducal throne of Würtemberg, though it was probable.[18] The reigning Duke,
  Eberhardt Louis, had, indeed, just lost his only son; but it was not
  impossible that a posthumous grandson might be born. Charles Alexander was
  first-cousin of the Duke. It is said that Suess on this occasion foretold the
  future greatness of the Prince, and pretended to extract his prophecy from
  the Cabala. It is certain that Charles Alexander was very superstitious, and
  believed in astrology, and it is by no means improbable that Suess practised
  on his credulity. He had at his disposal plenty of means of learning whether
  the young Princess of Würtemberg was likely soon to become a mother&mdash;her
  husband had died in November&mdash;and he was very well aware that the old
  Duke was failing. The loan made by Suess came acceptably to Prince Charles
  Alexander just as a Jewish banker, Isaac Simon of Landau, with whom he had
  hitherto dealt, had declined to make further advances.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[18] There was some idea of a younger brother being
  elected.</p>

  <p>When the Prince returned to Belgrade, where he resided as stadtholder of
  Servia, under the Emperor, he was fully convinced that he had discovered in
  Suess an able, intelligent, and devoted servant. His wife was a princess of
  Thurn and Taxis, and it is possible that Suess, who had been for some time
  about that court at Ratisbon, had used her influence, and his acquaintance
  with her family affairs, to push his interests with the Prince, her
  husband.</p>

  <p>On October 31, 1733, died the old Duke Eberhardt Louis, and Charles
  Alexander at once hastened from Belgrade to Vienna, where, in an interview
  with the Emperor, without any consultation with the Estates, or consideration
  for the treasury of Würtemberg, he promised Leopold a contingent of 12,000
  men to aid in the war against France. Then he went on to Stuttgart.</p>

  <p>Poor Würtemberg groaned under the burdens that had been imposed on it; the
  favourites had been allowed to do with it what they liked; and Charles
  Alexander's first public declaration on entering his capital was: "From
  henceforth I will reign over you immediately, and myself see to the reform of
  every grievance, and put away from my people every burden which has galled
  its shoulders. If my people cry to me, my ears shall be open to hear their
  call. I will not endure the disorder which has penetrated everywhere, into
  every department of the State; my own hand shall sweep it away."</p>

  <p>And as a token of his sincerity he ordered every office-holder in Church
  and State to put on paper and present to him a schedule of every payment that
  had been made, by way of fee and bribe, to obtain his office. This was
  published on December 28, 1733. The older and wiser heads were shaken; the
  Duke, they said, was only heaping trouble on his shoulders; let the past be
  buried. He replied, "I must get to the bottom of all this iniquity. I must
  get inured to work."</p>

  <p>But the hero of Belgrade had all his life been more accustomed to the
  saddle than the desk, and to command in battle&mdash;a much simpler
  matter&mdash;than to rule in peace. The amount of grievances brought before
  him, the innumerable scandals, peculations, bewildered him. The people were
  wild with enthusiasm, but the entire bureaucracy was filled with sullen and
  dogged opposition.</p>

  <p>Würtemberg enjoyed a constitution more liberal than any other German
  principality. The old Duke Eberhardt with the Beard, who died in 1496, by his
  will contrived for the good government of his land by providing checks
  against despotic rule by the dukes his successors. On the strength of this
  testament the Estates deposed his successor. The provisions of this will were
  ratified in the Capitulation of Tübingen, in 1514, and every duke on assuming
  the reins of government was required to swear to observe the capitulation.
  Duke Charles Alexander took the oath without perhaps very closely examining
  it, and found out after it was taken that he was hampered in various ways,
  and was incapacitated from raising the body of men with which he had
  undertaken to furnish the Emperor, independent of the consent of the
  Parliament. It may here be said that there was no hereditary house of nobles
  in Würtemberg; the policy of the former dukes had been to drive the
  hereditary petty nobles out of the country, and to create in their place a
  clique of court officials absolutely dependent on themselves. By the
  constitution, no standing army was to be maintained, and no troops raised
  without the consent of the Estates; the tenure of property was guaranteed by
  the State, all serfage was abolished, and no taxes could be imposed or
  monopolies created without the consent of the Estates.</p>

  <p>The Estates consisted of fourteen prelates, pastors invested with
  dignities which entitled them to sit in the House, and seventy
  deputies&mdash;some elected by the constituencies, others holders of certain
  offices, who sat <i>ex officio</i>. The Estates had great power; indeed the
  Duke could do little but ask its consent to the measures he proposed, and to
  swallow humble pie at refusal. It not only imposed the taxes, but the
  collectors were directly responsible to the Estates for what was collected,
  and paid into its hands the sum gathered. Moreover, any agreement entered
  into between the Duke and another prince was invalid unless ratified by the
  Estates.</p>

  <p>When Duke Charles Alexander, who had been accustomed to the despotic
  command of an army as field-marshal, found how his hands were tied and how he
  was surrounded by impediments to free action on all sides, he was very angry,
  and quarrelled with the Ministers who had presented the capitulation to him
  for signature. He declared that the paper presented for him to sign had not
  been read to him in full, or had the obnoxious passages folded under that he
  should not see them, or that they had been added after his signature had been
  affixed.</p>

  <p>He became irritable, not knowing how to keep his promise with the Emperor,
  and disgusted to find himself a ruler without real authority.</p>

  <p>Now, as it was inconvenient to call the Assembly together on every
  occasion when something was wanted, a permanent committee sat in Stuttgart,
  consisting of two parts. This committee acted for the Estates and were
  responsible to it.</p>

  <p>Wanting advice and help, unwilling to seek that of the reliable
  Ministers&mdash;and there were some honest and patriotic&mdash;the Duke asked
  Joseph Suess to assist him, and Suess was only too delighted to show him a
  way out of his difficulties. The redress of grievances was thrust aside,
  abuses were left uncorrected, and the Duke's attention was turned towards two
  main objects&mdash;the establishment of a standing army, and the upsetting of
  the old constitution.</p>

  <p>Würtemberg was then a state whose limits were not very extensive, nor did
  they lie within a ring fence. The imperial cities of Reutlingen, Ulm,
  Heilsbronn, Weil, and Gmünd were free. It might not be convenient for the
  Emperor to pay with hard cash for the troops the Duke had promised to
  furnish, but he might allow of the incorporation of these independent and
  wealthy cities in the duchy. Moreover, it was a feature of the times for the
  princes to seek to conquer fresh districts and incorporate them. France had
  recently snatched away Mompelgard from Würtemberg, and Charles Alexander
  recovered it. The duchy had suffered so severely from having been overrun by
  French troops that the Estates acquiesced, though reluctantly, in the Duke's
  proposal that a standing army should be maintained. Having obtained this
  concession, Suess instructed him how to make it a means of acquiring money,
  by calling men to arms who would be thankful to purchase their discharge. The
  army soon numbered 18,000 soldiers. His general-in-chief was Remchingen, a
  man who had served with him in the Imperial army and was devoted to his
  interests. The Duke placed his army under officers who were none of them
  Würtembergers. At the head of an army officered by his own creatures, the
  Duke hoped to carry his next purpose&mdash;the abrogation of the
  capitulation, and the conversion of the State from a constitutional to a
  despotic monarchy. Suess now became the Duke's most confidential adviser,
  and, guided by him, Charles Alexander got rid of all his Ministers and
  courtiers who would not become the assistants in this policy, and filled
  their places with creatures of his own, chief of whom was a fellow named
  Hallwachs. In order to paralyse the Assembly the Duke did not summon it to
  meet, and managed to pack the committee with men in his interest; for,
  curiously enough, the committee was not elected by the delegates, but itself
  elected into the vacancies created in it. By means of the committee the Duke
  imposed on the country in 1736 a double tax, and the grant of a thirtieth of
  all the fruits; and this was to last "as long as the necessities of the case
  required it."</p>

  <p>Suess himself was careful to keep in the background. He accepted no office
  about court, became Minister of no branch of the State; but every Minister
  and officer was nominated by him and devoted to him. Towards these creatures
  of his own he behaved with rudeness and arrogance, so that they feared him
  almost more than the Duke. If the least opposition was manifested, Suess
  threatened the gallows or the block, forfeiture of goods, and banishment; and
  as the Duke subscribed every order Suess brought him, it was well known that
  his threats were not idle.</p>

  <p>Suess employed Weissensee, a pastor, the prelate of Hirsau, as his court
  spy. This worthless man brought to the favourite every whisper that passed
  within his hearing among the courtiers of the Duke, everything that was said
  in the committee, and advised whether the adhesion of this or that man was
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>Suess so completely enveloped the Duke in the threads of the web he spun
  about him, that Charles Alexander followed his advice blindly, and did
  nothing without consulting him.</p>

  <p>In 1734 Suess farmed the coinage of Würtemberg, with great profit to
  himself, and, having got it into his own hands, kept it there to the end. But
  there is this to be said for his coinage, that it was far better than that of
  all the other states of Germany; so that the Würtemberg silver was sought
  throughout Germany. There was nothing fraudulent in this transaction, and
  though at his trial the matter was closely investigated, no evidence of his
  having exceeded what was just could be produced against him.</p>

  <p>It was quite another matter with the "Land Commission," a well-intentioned
  institution with which the Duke began his reign. Charles Alexander was
  overwhelmed with the evidence sent in to him of bribery under the late Duke,
  and, unable to investigate the cases himself, he appointed commissioners to
  do so, and of course these commissioners were nominated by Suess. The
  commission not only examined into evidence of bribery in the purchase of
  offices, but also into peculation and neglect of duty in the discharge of
  offices. Those against whom evidence was strong were sentenced to pay a heavy
  fine, but were not necessarily deprived. Those, on the other hand, who had
  acquired their offices honourably and had discharged their functions
  conscientiously were harassed by repeated trials, terrified with threats, and
  were forced to purchase their discharge at a sum fixed according to an
  arbitrary tariff. Those who proved stubborn, or did not see at what the
  commissioners aimed, were subjected to false witnesses, found guilty, and
  fined. These fines amounted in some instances to £2,000.</p>

  <p>After the commission had exhausted the bureaucracy, and money was still
  needed, private individuals became the prey of their inquisitorial and
  extortive action.</p>

  <p>Any citizen who was reported to be rich was summoned before the tribunal
  to give an account of the manner in which he had obtained his wealth; his
  private affairs were investigated, his books examined, and his trial
  protracted till he was glad to purchase his dismissal for a sum calculated
  according to his income as revealed to the prying eyes of the
  inquisitors.</p>

  <p>But as this did not suffice to fill the empty treasury, recurrence was had
  to the old abuse which the Land Commission had been instituted to inquire
  into and correct. Every office was sold, and to increase the revenue from
  this source fresh offices were created, fresh titles invented, and all were
  sold for ready money. Every office in Church as well as State was bought;
  indeed, a sort of auction was held at every vacancy, and the office was
  knocked down to the highest bidder.</p>

  <p>This sort of commerce had been bad enough under the late Duke, but it
  became fourfold as bad now under the redresser of abuses, for what had before
  been inchoate was now organised by Suess into a system.</p>

  <p>Not only were the offices sold, but after they had been entered upon, the
  tenant was expected to pay a second sum, entitled the gratuity, which was to
  go, it was announced, towards a sustentation fund for widows and orphans and
  the aged. It is needless to say that none of this money ever reached widows,
  orphans, or aged.</p>

  <p>A special bureau of gratuities was organised by decree of the Duke, and
  filled with men appointed by Suess, who paid into his hands the sums
  received; and he, after having sifted them, and retained what he thought fit,
  shook the rest into the ducal treasury. This bureau was founded by ducal
  rescript in 1736.</p>

  <p>Side by side with the Office of Gratuities came the Fiscal Office into
  being, whose function it was to revise the magisterial and judicial
  proceedings of the courts of justice. This also was filled by Suess with his
  creatures. The ground given to the world for its establishment was the
  correction of judicial errors and injustices committed by the courts of law.
  It was the final court of revision, before which every decision went before
  it was carried into effect. Legal proceedings, moreover, were long and
  costly, and the Fiscal Court undertook to interfere when any suit threatened
  to be unduly protracted to the prejudice of justice. But the practical
  working of the Fiscal Court was something very different. It interfered with
  the course of justice, reversing judgments, not according to equity, but
  according to the bribes paid into the hands of the board. In a very short
  time the sources of justice were completely poisoned by it, and no crime,
  however great and however clearly established, led to chastisement if
  sufficient money were paid into the hands of the court of revision. The whole
  country was overrun with spies, who denounced as guilty of imaginary crimes
  those who were rich, and such never escaped without leaving some of their
  gold sticking to the hands of the fiscal counsellors.</p>

  <p>As usual with Joseph Suess, he endeavoured to keep officially clear of
  this court, as he had of the Office of Gratuities, and of all others. But the
  Duke nominated him assistant counsellor. Suess protested, and endeavoured to
  shirk the honour; but as the Duke refused to release him, he took care never
  once to attend the court, and when the proceedings and judgments were sent
  him for his signature he always sent them back unsigned; and he never was
  easy till relieved of the unacceptable title. For Suess was a clever rogue.
  In every transaction that was public, and of which documentary evidence was
  producible that he had been mixed up with it, he acted with integrity; but
  whenever he engaged on a proceeding which might render him liable to be tried
  in the event of his falling into disfavour, he kept himself in the background
  and acted through his agents; so that when, eventually, he was tried for his
  treasonable and fraudulent conduct, documentary evidence incriminating him
  was wholly wanting.</p>

  <p>After the death of the Duke, it was estimated from the records of the two
  courts that they had in the year 1736-7 squeezed sixty-five thousand pounds
  out of the small and poor duchy.</p>

  <p>Suess had constituted himself jeweller to the Duke, who had a fancy for
  precious stones, but knew nothing of their relative values. When Suess
  offered him a jewel he was unable to resist the temptation of buying it, and
  very little of the money of the Bureau of Gratuities ever reached him; he
  took the value out in stones at Suess' estimation. When some of his intimates
  ventured to suggest that the Jew was deceiving him as to the worth of the
  stones, Duke Charles Alexander shrugged his shoulders and said with a laugh,
  "It may be so, but I can't do without that coujon" (<i>cochon</i>).[19] At
  the beginning of 1736 a new edict for wards was issued by the Duke, probably
  on Suess' suggestion, whereby he constituted a chancery which should act as
  guardian to all orphans under age, managing their property for them, and was
  accountable to none but the Duke for the way in which it dealt with the
  trust. Then a commission was instituted to take charge of all charitable
  bequests in the duchy; and by this means Suess got the fingering of property
  to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds, for which the State paid to the
  Charities at the rate of three per cent.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[19] In three years Suess gained a profit of 20,000
  florins out of the sale of jewellery alone.</p>

  <p>Then came the imposition of duties and taxes. Salt was taxed,
  playing-cards, groceries, leather, tobacco, carriages, even the sweeping of
  chimneys. A gazette was issued containing decrees of the Duke and official
  appointments, and every officer and holder of any place, however
  insignificant, under Government was compelled to subscribe to this weekly
  paper, the profits of which came to the Duke and his adviser. Then came a
  property and income tax; then in quick succession one tormenting edict after
  another, irritating and disturbing the people, and all meaning one
  thing&mdash;money.</p>

  <p>Lotteries were established by order of the Duke. Suess paid the Duke £300
  for one, and pocketed the profits, which were considerable. At the court
  balls and masquerades Suess had his roulette tables in an adjoining room, and
  what fell to the <i>croupier</i> went into his pocket.[20]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[20] The Duke, at Suess's instigation, wrote to the
  Emperor to get the Jew factotum ennobled, but was refused.</p>

  <p>At last his sun declined. The Duke became more and more engrossed in his
  ideas of upsetting the constitution by means of his army, and listened more
  to his general, Remchingen, than to Suess. He entered into a compact with the
  elector of Bavaria and with the Bishops of Würzburg and Bamberg to send him
  troops to assist him in his great project, and, as a price for this
  assistance, promised to introduce the Roman Catholic religion into
  Würtemberg.</p>

  <p>The enemies of Suess, finding that he was losing hold of the Duke, took
  advantage of a precious stone which the Jew had sold him for a thousand
  pounds, and which proved to be worth only four hundred, to open the eyes of
  Charles Alexander to the character of the man who had exercised such
  unbounded influence over him. Suess, finding his power slipping from him,
  resolved to quit the country. The Duke stopped him. Suess offered five
  thousand pounds for permission to depart; it was refused. Charles Alexander
  was aware that Suess knew too many court secrets to be allowed to quit the
  country. Moreover, the necessities of the Duke made him feel that he might
  still need the ingenuity of Suess to help him to raise money. As a means of
  retaining him he granted him a so-called "absolutorium"&mdash;a rescript
  which made him responsible to no one for any of his actions in the past or in
  the future. Furnished with this document, the Jew consented to remain, and
  then the Duke required of him a loan of four thousand pounds for the expenses
  of a journey he meditated to Danzig to consult a physician about a foot from
  which he suffered. The "absolutorium" was signed in February 1737.</p>

  <p>On March 12 following, Charles Alexander started on his journey from
  Stuttgart, but went no farther than his palace at Ludwigsburg.</p>

  <p>Although the utmost secrecy had been maintained, it had nevertheless
  transpired that the constitution was to be upset as soon as the Duke had left
  the country. He had given sealed orders to his general, Remchingen, to this
  effect. The Bavarian and Würtemberg troops, to the number of 19,000 men, were
  already on the march. The Würtemberg army was entirely officered by the
  Duke's own men. Orders had been issued to forbid the Stuttgart Civil Guard
  from exercising and assembling, and ordering that a general disarmament of
  the Civil Guard and of the peasants and citizens should be enforced
  immediately the Duke had crossed the frontier. All the fortresses in the
  duchy had been provided with abundance of ammunition and ordnance.</p>

  <p>At Ludwigsburg the Duke halted to consult an astrologer as to the prospect
  of his undertaking. Suess laughed contemptuously at the pretences of this
  man, and, pointing to a cannon, said to Charles Alexander, "This is your best
  telescope."</p>

  <p>The sealed orders were to be opened on the 13th, and on that day the
  stroke was to be dealt. Already Ludwigsburg was full of Würzburg soldiers. A
  courier of the Duke with a letter had, in a drunken squabble, been deprived
  of the dispatch; this was opened and shown to the Assembly, which assembled
  in all haste and alarm. It revealed the plot. At once some of the notables
  hastened to Ludwigsburg to have an interview with their prince. He received
  them roughly, and dismissed them without disavowing his intentions. The
  consternation became general. The day was stormy; clouds were whirled across
  the sky, then came a drift of hail, then a gleam of sun. At Ludwigsburg, the
  wind blew in whole ranges of windows, shivering the glass. The alarm-bells
  rang in the church towers, for fire had broken out in the village of
  Eglosheim.</p>

  <p>The Assembly sent another deputation to Ludwigsburg, consisting of their
  oldest and most respected members. They did not arrive till late, and unable
  to obtain access through the front gates, crept round by the kitchen
  entrance, and presented themselves unexpectedly before the Duke at ten
  o'clock at night, as he was retiring to rest from a ball that had been given.
  Dancing was still going on in one of the wings, and the strains of music
  entered the chamber when the old notables of Würtemberg, men of venerable age
  and high character, forced their way into the Duke's presence.</p>

  <p>Charles Alexander had but just come away from the ball-room, seated
  himself in an arm-chair, and drunk a powerful medicine presented him by his
  chamberlain, Neuffer, in a silver bowl. Neuffer belonged to a family which
  had long been influential in Würtemberg, honourable and patriotic. Scarce had
  the Duke swallowed this draught when the deputation appeared. He became livid
  with fury, and though the interview took place with closed doors the servants
  without heard a violent altercation, and the Duke's voice raised as if he
  were vehemently excited. Presently the doors opened and the deputation came
  forth, greatly agitated, one of the old men in his hurry forgetting to take
  his cap away with him. Scarcely were they gone when Neuffer dismissed the
  servants, and himself went to a further wing of the palace.</p>

  <p>The Duke, still excited, suddenly felt himself unwell, ran into the
  antechamber, found no one there, staggered into a third, then a fourth room,
  tore open a window, and shouted into the great court for help; but his voice
  was drowned by the band in the illumined ball-room, playing a valse. Then
  giddiness came over the Duke, and he fell to the ground. The first to arrive
  was Neuffer, and he found him insensible. He drew his knife and lanced him.
  Blood flowed. The Duke opened his eyes and gasped, "What is the matter with
  me? I am dying!" He was placed in an armchair, and died instantly.</p>

  <p>That night not a window in Stuttgart had shown light. The town was as a
  city of the dead. Everyone was in alarm as to what would ensue on the morrow,
  but in secret arms were being distributed among the citizens and guilds. They
  would fight for their constitution. Suddenly, at midnight, the news spread
  that the Duke was dead. At once the streets were full of people, laughing,
  shouting, throwing themselves into each other's arms, and before another hour
  the windows were illuminated with countless candles.[21]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[21] On the following night a confectioner set up a
  transparency exhibiting the Devil carrying off the Duke.</p>

  <p>Not a moment was lost. Duke Charles Rudolf of Würtemberg-Neuenstadt was
  invested with the regency, and on March 19, General Remchingen was arrested
  and deprived of his office.</p>

  <p>For once Suess' cleverness failed him. Relying on his "absolutorium," he
  did not fly the country the moment he heard of the death of the Duke. He
  waited till he could place his valuables in safety. He waited just too long,
  for he was arrested and confined to his house. Then he did manage to escape,
  and got the start of his enemies by an hour, but was recognised and stopped
  by a Würtemberg officer, and reconducted to Stuttgart, where he was almost
  torn to pieces by the infuriated populace, and with difficulty rescued from
  their hands. On March 19, he was sent to the fortress of Hohenneuffen; but
  thence he almost succeeded in effecting his escape by bribing the guards with
  the diamonds he had secreted about his person.</p>

  <p>At first Suess bore his imprisonment with dignity. He was confident, in
  the first place, that the "absolutorium" would not be impeached, and in the
  second, that there was no documentary evidence discoverable which could
  incriminate him. But as his imprisonment was protracted, and as he saw that
  the country demanded a victim for the wrongs it had suffered, his confidence
  and self-respect left him. Nevertheless, it was not till the last that he was
  convinced that his life as well as his ill-gotten gains would be taken from
  him, and then he became a despicable figure, entreating mercy, and eagerly
  seeking to incriminate others in the hopes of saving his own wretched life
  thereby.</p>

  <p>There were plenty of others as guilty as Suess&mdash;nay, more so, for
  they were natives of Würtemberg, and he an alien in blood and religion. But
  these others had relations and friends to intercede for them, and all felt
  that Suess was the man to be made a scape-goat of, because he was
  friendless.</p>

  <p>The mode of his execution was barbarous. His trial had been protracted for
  eleven months; at length, on February 4, 1738, he was led forth to
  execution&mdash;to be hung in an iron cage. This cage had been made in 1596,
  and stood eight feet high, and was four feet in diameter. It was composed of
  seventeen bars and fourteen cross-bars, and was circular. The gallows was
  thirty-five feet high. The wretched man was first strangled in the cage, hung
  up in it like a dead bird, and then the cage with him in it was hoisted up to
  the full height of the gallows-tree. His wealth was confiscated.</p>

  <p>Hallwachs and the other rascals who had been confederated with him in
  plundering their country were banished, but were allowed to depart with all
  their plunder.</p>

  <p>Remchingen also escaped; when arrested, he managed to get rid of all
  compromising papers, which were given by him to a chimney-sweep sent to him
  down the chimney by some of the agents of the Bishop of Würzburg.</p>

  <p>Such is the tragic story of the life of Suess Oppenheim, a man of no
  ordinary abilities, remarkable shrewdness, but without a spark of principle.
  But the chief tragedy is to be found in the deterioration of the character of
  Duke Charles Alexander, who, as Austrian field-marshal and governor of
  Servia, had been the soul of honour, generous and beloved; who entered on his
  duchy not only promising good government, but heartily desiring to rule well
  for his people's good; and who in less than four years had forfeited the love
  and respect of his subjects, and died meditating an act which would have
  branded him as perjured&mdash;died without having executed one of his good
  purposes, and so hated by the people who had cheered him on his entry into
  the capital, that, by general consent, the mode of his death was not too
  curiously and closely inquired into.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; IGNATIUS FESSLER</h2>

  <p class="first">ON December 15th, 1839, in his eighty-fourth year, died
  Ignatius Fessler, Lutheran Bishop, at St. Petersburg, a man who had gone
  through several phases of religious belief and unbelief, a Hungarian by
  birth, a Roman Catholic by education, a Capuchin friar, then a deist, almost,
  if not quite, an atheist, professor of Oriental languages in the university
  of Lemberg, finally Lutheran Bishop in Finland.</p>

  <p>He was principally remarkable as having been largely instrumental in
  producing one of the most salutary reforms of the Emperor Joseph II.</p>

  <p>His autobiography published by him in 1824, when he was seventy years old,
  affords a curious picture of the way in which Joseph carried out those
  reforms, and enables us to see how it was that they roused so much
  opposition, and in so many cases failed to effect the good that was
  designed.</p>

  <p>Fessler, in his autobiography, paints himself in as bright colours as he
  can lay on, but it is impossible not to see that he was a man of little
  principle, selfish and heartless.</p>

  <p>The autobiography is so curious, and the experiences of Fessler so varied,
  the times in which he lived so eventful, and the book itself so little known,
  that a short account of his career may perhaps interest, and must be new to
  the generality of readers.</p>

  <p>Ignatius Fessler was the son of parents in a humble walk of life resident
  in Hungary, but Germans by extraction. Ignatius was born in the year 1754,
  and as the first child, was dedicated by his mother to God. It was usual at
  that time for such children to be dressed in ecclesiastical habits. Ignatius
  as soon as he could walk was invested in a black cassock. His earliest
  reading was in the lives of the saints and martyrs, but at his first
  Communion his mother gave him a Bible. That book and Thomas à Kempis were her
  only literature. Long-continued prayer, daily reading of religious books, and
  no others, moulded the opening mind of her child. Exactly the same process
  goes on in countless peasant houses in Catholic Austria and Germany and
  Switzerland at the present day. No such education, no such walling off of the
  mind from secular influences is possible in England or France. The first
  enthusiasm of the child was to become a saint, his highest ambition to be a
  hermit or a martyr. At the age of seven he was given to be instructed by a
  Jesuit father, and was shortly after admitted to communion. At the age of
  nine Ignatius could read and speak Latin, and then he read with avidity
  Cardinal Bona's <i>Manductio ad Coelum</i>. His education was in the hands of
  the Carmelites at Raab. Dr. Fessler records his affectionate remembrance of
  his master, Father Raphael. Ignatius lounged, and was lazy. "Boy!" said the
  Father, "have done with lounging or you will live to be no good, but the
  laughing stock of old women. Look at me aged seventy, full of life and
  vigour, that comes of not being a lounger when a boy." From the Carmelite
  school Ignatius passed into that of the Jesuits. His advance was rapid; but
  his reading was still in Mystical Theology and his aim the attainment of the
  contemplative, ecstatic life of devotion. So he reached his seventeenth
  year.</p>

  <p>Then his mother took him to Buda, to visit his uncle who was lecturer on
  Philosophy in the Capuchin Convent. The boy declared his desire to become a
  Franciscan. His mother and uncle gave their ready consent, and he entered on
  his noviciate, under the name of Francis Innocent. "The name Innocent became
  me well&mdash;really, at that time, I did not know the difference between the
  sexes."</p>

  <p>In 1774, when aged twenty, he took the oaths constituting him a friar. All
  the fathers in the convent approved, except one old man, Peregrinus, who
  remonstrated gravely, declaring that he foresaw that Fessler would bring
  trouble on the fraternity. Father Peregrinus was right, Fessler was one to
  whom the life and rules and aim of the Order could never be congenial. He had
  an eager, hungry mind, an insatiable craving for knowledge, and a passion for
  books. The Capuchins were, and still are, recruited from the lowest of the
  people, ignorant peasants with a traditional contempt for learning, and their
  teachers embued with the shallowest smattering of knowledge. Fessler, being
  devoid of means, could not enter one of the cultured Orders, the Benedictines
  or the Jesuits. Moreover, the Franciscan is, by his vow, without property, he
  must live by begging, a rule fatal to self-respect, and fostering idleness.
  S. Francis, the founder, was a scion of a mercantile class, and the beggary
  which he imposed on his Order, was due to his revolt against the money-greed
  of his class. But it has been a fruitful source of mischief. It deters men
  with any sense of personal dignity from entering the Order, and it invites
  into it the idle and the ignorant. The Franciscan Order has been a fruitful
  nursery of heresies, schisms and scandals. Now old Father Peregrinus had
  sufficient insight into human nature to see and judge that a man of pride,
  intellectual power, and culture of mind, would be as a fish on dry land in
  the Capuchin fraternity. He was not listened to. Fessler was too young to
  know himself, and the fathers too eager to secure a man of promise and
  ability.</p>

  <p>"The guardian, Coelestine, an amiable man, took a liking to me. He taught
  me to play chess, and he played more readily with me than with any of the
  rest, which, not a little, puffed up my self-esteem. The librarian, Leonidas,
  was an old, learned, obliging man, dearly loving his flowers. I fetched the
  water for him to his flower-beds, and he showed me his gratitude by letting
  me have the run of the library."</p>

  <p>The library was not extensive, the books nearly all theological, and the
  volume which Fessler was most attracted by was Barbanson's "Ways of Divine
  Love."</p>

  <p>In 1775, Fessler made the acquaintance of a Calvinist Baron, who lent him
  Fleury's "Ecclesiastical History." This opened the young man's eyes to the
  fact that the Church was not perfect, that the world outside the Church was
  not utterly graceless. He read his New Testament over seven times in that
  year. Then his Calvinist friend lent him Muratori's "Treatise on the Mystical
  Devotions of the Monks." His confidence was shaken. He no longer saw in the
  Church the ideal of purity and perfect infallibility; he saw that Mystical
  Theology was a geography of cloud castles. What profit was there in it? To
  what end did the friars live? To grow cabbages, make snuff-boxes, cardboard
  cases, which they painted&mdash;these were their practical labours; the rest
  of their time was spent in prayer and meditation.</p>

  <p>Then the young friar got hold of Hofmann-Waldau's poems, and the
  sensuousness of their pictures inflamed his imagination at the very time when
  religious ecstasy ceased to attract him.</p>

  <p>What the result might have been, Fessler says, he trembles to think, had
  he not been fortified by Seneca. It is curious to note, and characteristic of
  the man, that he was saved from demoralisation, not by the New Testament,
  which did not touch his heart, but by Seneca's moral axioms, which convinced
  his reason. The Franciscans are allowed great liberty. They run over the
  country collecting alms, they visit whom they will, and to a man without
  principle, such liberty offers dangerous occasions.</p>

  <p>Fessler now resolved to leave an Order which was odious to him. "Somewhat
  tranquillized by Seneca, I now determined to shake myself loose from the
  trammels of the cloister, without causing scandal. The most easy way to do
  this was for me to take Orders, and get a cure of souls or a chaplaincy to a
  nobleman." He had no vocation for the ministry; he looked to it merely as a
  means of escape from uncongenial surroundings. On signifying his desire to
  become a priest, he was transferred to Gross Wardein, there to pass the
  requisite course of studies. At Wardein he gained the favour of the bishop
  and some of the canons, who lent him books on the ecclesiastical and
  political history of his native land. He also made acquaintance with some
  families in the town, a lady with two daughters, with the elder of whom he
  fell in love. He had, however, sufficient decency not to declare his passion.
  It was otherwise with a young Calvinist tailor's widow, Sophie; she replied
  to his declaration very sensibly by a letter, which, he declares, produced a
  lasting effect upon him.</p>

  <p>In 1776 he was removed to Schwächat to go through a course of Moral
  Theology. His disgust at his enforced studies, which he regarded as the
  thrashing of empty husks, increased. He was angry at his removal from the
  friends he had made at Wardein. Vexation, irritation, doubt, threw him into a
  fever, and he was transferred to the convent in the suburbs of Vienna, where
  he could be under better medical care. The physician who attended him soon
  saw that his patient's malady was mental. Fessler opened his heart to him,
  and begged for the loan of books more feeding to the brain than the mystical
  rubbish in the convent library. The doctor advised him to visit him, when
  discharged as cured from the convent infirmary, instead of at once returning
  to Schwächat. This he did, and the doctor introduced him to two men of
  eminence and influence, Von Eybel and the prelate Rautenstrauch, a
  Benedictine abbot, the director of the Theological Faculties in the Austrian
  Monarchy. This latter promised Fessler to assist him in his studies, and
  urged him to study Greek and Hebrew, also to widen the circle of his reading,
  to make acquaintance with law, history, with natural science and geography,
  and undertook to provide him with the requisite books.</p>

  <p>On his return to Schwächat, Fessler appealed to the Provincial against his
  Master of Studies whom he pronounced to be an incompetent pedant. At his
  request he was moved to Wiener-Neustadt. There he found the lecturer on
  Ecclesiastical Studies as superficial as the man from whom he had escaped.
  This man did not object to Fessler pursuing his Greek and Hebrew studies, nor
  to his taking from the library what books he liked.</p>

  <p>The young candidate now borrowed and devoured deistical works, Hobbes,
  Tindal, Edelmann, and the Wolfenbüttel Fragments. He had to be careful not to
  let these books be seen, accordingly he hid them under the floor in the
  choir. After midnight, when matins had been sung, instead of returning to bed
  with the rest, he remained, on the plea of devotion, in the church, seated on
  the altar steps, reading deistical works by the light of the sanctuary lamp,
  which he pulled down to a proper level. He now completely lost his faith, not
  in Christianity only, but in natural religion as well. Nevertheless, he did
  not desist from his purpose of seeking orders. He was ordained deacon in
  1778, and priest in 1779. "On the Sunday after Corpus Christi, I celebrated
  without faith, without unction, my first mass, in the presence of my mother,
  her brother, and the rest of my family. They all received the communion from
  my hand, bathed in tears of emotion. I, who administered to them, was frozen
  in unbelief."</p>

  <p>The cure of souls he desired was not given him, no chaplaincy was offered
  him. His prospect of escape seemed no better than before. He became very
  impatient, and made himself troublesome in his convent. As might have been
  suspected, he became restive under the priestly obligations, as he had been
  under the monastic rule. It is curious that, late in life, when Fessler wrote
  his memoirs, he showed himself blind to the unworthiness of his conduct in
  taking on him the most sacred responsibilities to God and the Church, when he
  disbelieved in both. He is, however, careful to assure us that though without
  faith in his functions, he executed them punctually, hearing confessions,
  preaching and saying mass. But his conduct is so odious, his after
  callousness so conspicuous, that it is difficult to feel the smallest
  conviction of his conscientiousness at any time of his life.</p>

  <p>As he made himself disagreeable to his superiors at Neustadt, he was
  transferred to Mödling. There he made acquaintance with a Herr Von Molinari
  and was much at his house, where he met a young Countess Louise. "I cannot
  describe her stately form, her arching brows, the expression of her large
  blue eyes, the delicacy of her mouth, the music of her tones, the exquisite
  harmony that exists in all her movements, and what affects me more than
  all&mdash;she speaks Latin easily, and only reads serious books." So wrote
  Fessler in a letter at the time. He read Ovid's Metamorphoses with her in the
  morning, and walked with her in the evening. When, at the end of October, the
  family went to Vienna, "the absence of that noble soul," he wrote, "filled me
  with the most poignant grief." The Molinari family were bitten with
  Jansenism, and hoped to bring the young Capuchin to their views. Next year,
  in the spring of 1781, they returned to Mödling.</p>

  <p>"This year passed like the former; in the convent I was a model of
  obedience, in the school a master of scholastic theology: in Molinari's
  family a humble disciple of Jansen, in the morning a worshipper of the muse
  of Louise, in the evening an agreeable social companion,"&mdash;in
  heart&mdash;an unbeliever in Christianity.</p>

  <p>A letter written to an uncle on March 12th, 1782, must be quoted verbatim,
  containing as it does a startling discovery, which gave him the opportunity
  so long desired, of breaking with the Order:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Since the 23rd February, I sing without intermission after David, in my
  inmost heart, 'Praise and Glory be to God, who has delivered my enemies into
  my hand!' Listen to the wonderful way in which this has happened. On the
  night of the 23rd to 24th of February, after eleven o'clock, I was roused
  from sleep by a lay-brother. 'Take your crucifix,' said he 'and follow
  me.'</p>

  <p>"'Whither?' I asked, panic struck.</p>

  <p>"'Whither I am about to lead you.'</p>

  <p>"'What am I to do?'</p>

  <p>"'I will tell you, when you are on the spot.'</p>

  <p>"'Without knowing whither I go, and for what purpose, go I will not.'</p>

  <p>"'The Guardian has given the order; by virtue of holy obedience you are
  bound to follow whither I lead.'</p>

  <p>"As soon as holy obedience is involved, no resistance can be offered. Full
  of terror, I took my crucifix and followed the lay-brother, who went before
  with a dark lantern. Passing the cell of one of my fellow scholars, I slipped
  in, shook him out of sleep, and whispered in Latin twice in his ear, 'I am
  carried off, God knows whither. If I do not appear to-morrow, communicate
  with Rautenstrauch.'</p>

  <p>"Our way led through the kitchen, and beyond it through a couple of
  chambers; on opening the last, the brother said, 'Seven steps down.' My heart
  contracted, I thought I was doomed to see the last of day-light. We entered a
  narrow passage, in which I saw, half way down it, on the right, a little
  altar, on the left some doors fastened with padlocks. My guide unlocked one
  of these, and said, 'Here is a dying man, Brother Nicomede, a Hungarian, who
  knows little German, give him your spiritual assistance. I will wait here.
  When he is dead, call me.'</p>

  <p>"Before me lay an old man on his pallet, in a worn-out habit, on a straw
  palliasse, under a blanket; his hood covered his grey head, a snow-white
  beard reached to his girdle. Beside the bedstead was an old straw-covered
  chair, a dirty table, on which was a lamp burning. I spoke a few words to the
  dying man, who had almost lost his speech; he gave me a sign that he
  understood me. There was no possibility of a confession. I spoke to him about
  love to God, contrition for sin, and hope in the mercy of heaven; and when he
  squeezed my hand in token of inward emotion, I pronounced over him the
  General Absolution. The rest of the while I was with him, I uttered slowly,
  and at intervals, words of comfort and hope of eternal blessedness. About
  three o'clock, after a death agony of a quarter-of-an-hour, he had passed out
  of the reach of trouble.</p>

  <p>"Before I called the lay-brother, I looked round the prison, and then
  swore over the corpse to inform the Emperor of these horrors. Then I summoned
  the lay-brother, and said, coldly, 'Brother Nicomede is gone.'</p>

  <p>"'A good thing for him, too,' answered my guide, in a tone equally
  indifferent.</p>

  <p>"'How long has he been here?'</p>

  <p>"'Two and fifty years.'</p>

  <p>"'He has been severely punished for his fault.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, yes. He has never been ill before. He had a stroke yesterday, when
  I brought him his meal.'</p>

  <p>"'What is the altar for in the passage?'</p>

  <p>"'One of the fathers says mass there on all festivals for the lions, and
  communicates them. Do you see, there is a little window in each of the doors,
  which is then opened, and through it the lions make their confession, hear
  mass, and receive communion.'</p>

  <p>"'Have you many lions here?'</p>

  <p>"'Four, two priests and two lay-brothers to be attended on.'</p>

  <p>"'How long have they been here?'</p>

  <p>"'One for fifty, another for forty-two, the third for fifteen, and the
  last for nine years.'</p>

  <p>"'Why are they here?'</p>

  <p>"'I don't know.'</p>

  <p>"'Why are they called lions?'</p>

  <p>"'Because I am called the lion-ward.'</p>

  <p>"I deemed it expedient to ask no more questions. I got the lion-ward to
  light me to my cell, and there in calmness considered what to do.</p>

  <p>"Next day, or rather, that same day, Feb. 24th, I wrote in full all that
  had occurred, in a letter addressed to the Emperor, with my signature
  attached. Shortly after my arrival in Vienna I had made the acquaintance of a
  Bohemian secular student named Bokorny, a trusty man. On the morning of Feb.
  25th, I made him swear to give my letter to the Emperor, and keep silence as
  to my proceeding.</p>

  <p>"At 8 o'clock he was with my letter in the Couriers' lobby of the palace,
  where there is usually a crowd of persons with petitions awaiting the
  Emperor. Joseph took my paper from my messenger, glanced hastily at it, put
  it apart from the rest of the petitions, and let my messenger go, after he
  had cautioned him most seriously to hold his tongue.</p>

  <p>"The blow is fallen; what will be the result&mdash;whether anything will
  come of it, I do not yet know."</p>

  <p>For many months no notice was taken of the letter. It was not possible for
  the Emperor to take action at once, for a few days later Pius VI. arrived in
  Vienna on a visit to Joseph.</p>

  <p>Joseph II. was an enthusiastic reformer; he had the liveliest regard for
  Frederick the Great, and tried to copy him, but, as Frederick said, Joseph
  always began where he ought to leave off. He had no sooner become Emperor
  (1780) than he began a multitude of reforms, with headlong impetuosity. He
  supposed that every abuse was to be rooted up by an exercise of despotic
  power, and that his subjects would hail freedom and enlightenment with
  enthusiasm. Regardless of the power of hereditary association, he arbitrarily
  upset existing institutions, in the conviction that he was promoting the
  welfare of his subjects. He emancipated the Jews, and proclaimed liberty of
  worship to all religious bodies except the Deists, whom he condemned to
  receive five-and-twenty strokes of the cane. He abolished the use of torture,
  and reorganised the courts of justice.</p>

  <p>The Pope, alarmed at the reforming spirit of Joseph, and the innovations
  he was introducing into the management of the Church, crossed the Alps with
  the hope that in a personal interview he might moderate the Emperor's zeal.
  He arrived only a few days after Joseph had received the letter of Ignatius
  Fessler, which was calculated to spur him to enact still more sweeping
  reforms, and to steel his heart against the papal blandishments. Nothing
  could have come to his hands more opportunely.</p>

  <p>In Vienna, in St. Stephen's, the Pope held a pontifical mass. The Emperor
  did not honour it by his presence. By order of Joseph, the back door of the
  papal lodging was walled up, that Pius might receive no visitors unknown to
  the Emperor, and guards were placed at the entrance, to scrutinize those who
  sought the presence of the Pope. Joseph lost dignity by studied discourtesy;
  and Kaunitz, his minister, was allowed to be insulting. The latter received
  the Pope when he visited him, in his dressing-gown, and instead of kissing
  his hand, shook it heartily. Pius, after spending five weeks in Vienna
  without affecting anything, was constrained to depart.</p>

  <p>Fessler saw him thrice, once, when the Pope said mass in the Capuchin
  Church, he stood only three paces from him. "Never did faith and unbelief,
  Jansenism and Deism, struggle for the mastery in me more furiously than then;
  tears flowed from my eyes, excited by my emotion, and at the end of the mass,
  I felt convinced that I had seen either a man as full of the burning love of
  God as a seraph, or the most accomplished actor in the world." Of the
  sincerity and piety of Pius VI. there can be no question. He was a good man,
  but not an able man. "At the conclusion he turned to us young priests, asked
  of each his name, length of time in the Order, and priesthood, about our
  studies, and exhorted us, in a fatherly tone, to be stout stones in the wall
  of the house of Israel, in times of trouble present and to come."</p>

  <p>Before Pius departed, he gave his blessing to the people from the balcony
  of the Jesuit Church. "The Pope was seated on a throne under a
  gold-embroidered canopy. Fifty thousand persons must have been assembled
  below. Windows were full of heads, every roof crowded. The Pope wore his
  triple-crowned tiara, and was attended by three cardinals and two bishops in
  full pontificals. He intoned the form of absolution, in far-reaching voice,
  which was taken up by the court choir of four hundred voices. When this was
  done, Pius rose from his throne, the tiara was removed from his head, he
  stepped forward, raised eyes and arms to heaven, and in a pure ecstasy of
  devotion poured forth a fervent prayer. Only sighs and sobs broke
  occasionally the perfect silence which reigned among the vast throng of
  kneeling persons in the great square. The Pope seemed rather to be raised in
  ecstasy from his feet, than to stand. The prayer lasted long, and the bishops
  put their hands to stay up his arms; it was like Moses on the mountain top,
  with the rod of God in his hand, supported by Aaron and Hur, as he prayed for
  his people striving below with Amalek. At last this second Moses let his arms
  fall, he raised his right hand, and blessed the people in the name of the
  Triune God. At the Amen, the cannon of the Freiung boomed, and were answered
  by all the artillery on the fortifications of the city."</p>

  <p>The Pope was gone, and still no notice taken of the petition. Molinari
  spoke to Fessler, who was very hot about reform, and had drawn up a scheme
  for the readjustment of the Church in the Empire, which he sent to some of
  the ministers of the Emperor. "My friend," said Molinari, "to pull down and
  to rebuild, to destroy and to re-create, are serious matters, only to be
  taken in hand by one who has an earnest vocation, and not to be made a means
  for self-seeking."</p>

  <p>Fessler admits that there was truth in the reproach, he was desirous of
  pushing himself into notice, and he cared for the matter of "the lions," only
  because he thought they would serve his selfish purpose. Joseph now issued an
  order that no member of a monastic order was to be admitted to a benefice who
  had not passed an examination before the teachers of the Seminaries. The
  superiors of the Capuchins forbade their candidates going into these
  examinations. Fessler stirred up revolt, and he and some others, acting under
  his advice, demanded to be admitted to examination. His superior then
  informed him that he was not intended by the Order to take a cure of souls,
  he was about to be appointed lecturer on Philosophy in one of the convents in
  Hungary. In order to prevent his removal, and to force the Order to an open
  rupture with him, Fessler had recourse to a most unseemly and ungenerous act.
  Whilst in Vienna, he had made the acquaintance of an unmarried lady, the
  Baroness E. He had assisted her in her studies, giving her instructions
  usually by letter. His acquaintance, Von Eybel, had written a book or tract,
  which had made a great stir, entitled, "Who is the Pope?" Fessler wrote
  another, entitled, "Who is the Emperor?" He sent a copy to the publisher, but
  retained the original MS. Fessler now wrote under a feigned name, and in a
  disguised hand, a letter to Father Maximus, guardian of the convent, charging
  himself with carrying on a guilty correspondence with the Baroness E., and
  with the composition of an inflammatory and anti-religious pamphlet, "Who is
  the Emperor?" Maximus at once visited the Baroness, and showed her the
  letter. The lady in great indignation produced the entire correspondence, and
  handed the letters to him. Maximus put them in the hands of the Lector of the
  convent, who visited Fessler, and asked him if he acknowledged the authorship
  of "these scandalous letters."</p>

  <p>"Scandalous, they are not," answered Fessler.</p>

  <p>"<i>Impius, cum in profundum venerit, contemnit</i>," roared the friar.
  "They are not only scandalous, but impious. Look at this letter on platonic
  love. Is that a fit letter for such as you to write to a lady?"</p>

  <p>In consequence of these letters, and the MS. of the pamphlet being found
  upon him, Fessler was denounced to the Consistorial Court of the Archbishop.
  He was summoned before it at the beginning of August, when he was forced to
  admit he had been wont to kiss the lady to whom he wrote on platonic love,
  and the Consistory suspended him from the exercise of his priestly functions
  for a month.</p>

  <p>"I and the Lector returned to the convent silent, as if strangers. When we
  arrived, the friars were at table. I do not know how I got to my place; but
  after I had drunk my goblet of wine, all was clearer about me. I seemed to
  hear the voice of Horace calling to me from heaven, <i>Perfer et
  obdura!</i>and in a moment my self-respect revived, and I looked with scorn
  on the seventy friars hungrily eating their dinner."</p>

  <p>Of his own despicable conduct, that he had richly deserved his punishment,
  Fessler never seems to have arrived at the perception. He was, indeed, a very
  pitiful creature, arousing disgust and contempt in a well-ordered mind; and
  his Memoirs only deserve notice because of the curious insight they afford
  into the inner life of convents, and because he was the means of bringing
  great scandals to light, and in assisting Joseph II. in his work of
  reform.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of September, 1782, Fessler was the means of bringing a
  fresh scandal before the eyes of the Emperor. During the preceding year, a
  saddler in Schwächat had lost his wife, and was left, not only a widower, but
  childless. His niece now kept house for him, and was much afraid lest her
  uncle should marry again, and that thus she should not become his heir. She
  consulted a Capuchin, Father Brictius. Fessler had been in the Schwächat
  convent, and knew the man. Soon after, the niece assured her uncle that the
  ghost of her aunt had appeared to her, and told her she was suffering in
  Purgatory. For her release, she must have ten masses said, and some wax
  candles burnt. The saddler was content to have his old woman "laid" at this
  price. But, after the tenth mass, the niece declared she had seen her aunt
  again, and that the spirit had appeared to her in the presence of Father
  Brictius, and told her, that what troubled her most of all was the suspicion
  she was under, that her husband purposed marrying again; and she assured him,
  that were he so to do, he would lose his soul, in token whereof, she laid her
  hand on the cover of the niece's prayer-book, and left the impression burnt
  into it.</p>

  <p>Father Brictius carried the scorched book all round the neighbourhood, the
  marks of thumb and five fingers were clearly to be seen, burnt into the
  wooden cover. Great was the excitement, and on all sides masses for souls
  were in demand. Some foolish pastors even preached on the marvel.</p>

  <p>It happened that a Viennese boy was apprenticed to a tinker at Schwächat;
  and the boy came home every Saturday evening, to spend the day with his
  parents, at Vienna. He generally brought Fessler some little presents or
  messages from his friends at Schwächat. One day, the boy complained to
  Fessler that he had been severely beaten by his master. On being asked the
  reason, he replied, that he had been engaged with the tinker making an iron
  hand, and that he had spoiled it. Shortly after this, the rumour of the
  miraculous hand laid on the prayer-book, reached the convent. Fessler put the
  circumstances together, and suspected he was on the track of a fraud. He went
  at once to one of the ministers of the Emperor, and told him what he
  knew.</p>

  <p>An imperial commission was issued, the tinker, the saddler's niece, and
  Father Brictius, were arrested, cross-questioned, and finally, confessed the
  trick. The tinker was sent to prison for some months, the woman, for some
  weeks, and the Franciscan was first imprisoned, and then banished the
  country. An account of the fraud was issued, by Government authority, and
  every parish priest was ordered to read it to his parishioners from the
  pulpit.</p>

  <p>The Capuchins at Vienna, after this, were more impatient than before to
  send Fessler to Hungary, and he was forced to appeal to the Emperor to
  prevent his removal.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, quite unexpectedly, in the beginning of October&mdash;seven
  months after Fessler had sent the Emperor an account of the prison in the
  convent, and when he despaired of notice being taken of it&mdash;some
  imperial commissioners visited the convent, and demanded in the name of the
  Emperor to be shown all over it. At the head of the Commission was Hägelin,
  to whom Fessler had told his suspicions about the iron hand.</p>

  <p>The commissioners visited all the cells, and the infirmary, then asked the
  Guardian thrice on his honour, and in the name of the Emperor, whether there
  was a prison in the convent. Thrice the Guardian replied that there was not.
  "Let us now visit the kitchen," said Hägelin, and in spite of the protests
  and excuses of the Guardian, he insisted on being taken there. Beyond the
  kitchen was the wash-house. The commissioners went further, and found a small
  locked door. They insisted on its being opened. Then the Guardian turned pale
  and nearly fainted. The door was thrown open, the cells were unlocked, and
  the lay brothers ordered to bring the prisoners into the refectory. There the
  commissioners remained alone with the unfortunates to take down their
  depositions. It was found that three, Fathers Florentine, and Paternus, and
  the lay brother, Nemesian, were out of their minds. The "lion-ward" was
  summoned to answer for them. From his account, it transpired that Nemesian
  had gone out of his mind through religious enthusiasm; he was aged
  seventy-one, and had been fifty years in the dungeon. Father Florentine was
  aged seventy-three, he had been in confinement for forty-two years for boxing
  the Guardian's ears in a fit of temper. Father Paternus was locked up because
  he used to leave his convent without permission, and when rebuked would not
  give up his independent conduct. He had been fifteen years in prison. His
  confinement had bereft him of his senses. As the remaining two were in full
  possession of their faculties, the "lion-ward" was now dismissed. The lay
  brother Barnabas said he had been a shopkeeper's servant in Vienna, he had
  fallen in love with his master's daughter. As his master refused to have him
  as his son-in-law, out of despair he had gone into the Capuchin Order. During
  his noviciate, the master died; the master of the novices stopped the letter
  informing him of this, and he took the vows, to discover, when too late, that
  the girl loved him, and was ready to take him. In his mad rage, he flung his
  rosary at the feet of the Guardian, declaring he would never confess to, or
  receive the communion from the hands of a father of this accursed Order. He
  had been nine years in prison, and was thirty-eight years old.</p>

  <p>Father Thuribius had been caught reading Wieland, Gellert, Rabener,
  &amp;c.; they had been taken from him. He got hold of other copies, they were
  taken away a second time. A third time he procured them, and when discovered,
  fought with his fists for their retention. He had been repeatedly given the
  cat o' nine tails, and had been locked up five months and ten days. His age
  was twenty-eight.</p>

  <p>The commissioners at once suspended the Provincial and the Guardian till
  further notice, and the five unfortunates were handed over to the care of the
  Brothers of Charity.</p>

  <p>That same day, throughout the entire monarchy, every monastery and nunnery
  was visited by imperial commissioners.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Emperor Joseph issued an order that Fessler was on
  no account to be allowed to leave Vienna, and that he took him under his
  imperial protection against all the devices of his monastic enemies.</p>

  <p>"Now came the sentence on the Guardian and the Provincial from the
  Emperor. They were more severely punished than perhaps they really deserved.
  I felt for their sufferings more keenly, because I was well aware that I had
  been moved to report against them by any other motive rather than humanity;
  and even the consequences of my revelation, the setting at liberty of a not
  inconsiderable number of unfortunate monks and nuns throughout the Austrian
  Empire, could not set my conscience at rest. Only the orders made by the
  Emperor rendering it impossible to repeat such abuses, brought me any
  satisfaction. The monastic prisons were everywhere destroyed. Transgression
  of rules was henceforth to be punished only by short periods of seclusion,
  and cases of insanity were to be sent to the Brothers of Charity, who managed
  the asylums."</p>

  <p>If Joseph II. had but possessed commonsense as well as enthusiasm, he
  would have left his mark deeper on his country than he did.</p>

  <p>Fessler laid before him the schedule of studies in the Franciscan
  Convents. Joseph then issued an order (6th April, 1782), absolutely
  prohibiting the course of studies in the cloisters. When Fessler saw that the
  Guardian of his convent was transgressing the decree, he appealed against him
  to the Emperor, and had him dismissed. Next year Joseph required all the
  students of the Capuchin Order to enter the seminaries, and pass thence
  through the Universities. But, unfortunately, Joseph had taken a step to
  alienate from him the bishops and secular clergy, as well as the monks and
  friars. He arbitrarily closed all the diocesan seminaries, and created
  seminaries of his own for the candidates for Orders, to which he appointed
  the professors, thus entirely removing the education of the clergy from the
  hands of the Church. When the Bishop of Goritz expressed his dissatisfaction,
  Joseph suppressed his see and banished him. The professors he appointed to
  the universities, to the chairs which were attended by candidates for Orders,
  were in many cases free-thinkers and rationalists. The professor of Biblical
  Exegesis at Vienna was an ex-Jesuit, Monsperger, "His religious system," says
  Fessler, who attended his course, "was simply this,&mdash;a wise enjoyment of
  life, submission to the inevitable, and prudence of conduct. That was all. He
  had no other idea of Church than a reciprocal bond of rights and duties. In
  his lectures he whittled all the supernatural out of the Old Testament, and
  taught his pupils to regard the book as a collection of myths, romance, and
  contradictions. His lectures brought me back from my trifling with Jansenism
  to the point I had been at four years before under the teaching of Hobbes,
  Tindal, and the Wolfenbüttel Fragments. I resolved to doubt everything
  supernatural and divine, without actually denying such thing.&mdash;Strange!
  I resolved to disbelieve, when I never had believed."</p>

  <p>On Feb. 6th, 1784, he received the Emperor's appointment to the
  professorships of Biblical Exegesis and Oriental languages in the University
  of Lemberg. On the 20th Feb., on the eve of starting for Lemberg, for ever to
  cast off the hated habit of S. Francis, and to shake off, as much as he dare,
  the trammels of the priesthood, Fessler was in his cell at midnight, counting
  the money he had received for his journey. "To the right of me, on the table
  was a dagger, given me as a parting present by the court secretary,
  Grossinger. I was thinking of retiring to rest, when my cell door was burst
  open, and in rushed Father Sergius, a great meat-knife in his hand, shouting,
  <i>Moriere hoeretice!</i> he struck at my breast. In an instant I seized my
  dagger, parried the blow, and wounded my assailant in the hand. He let the
  knife fall and ran away. I roused the Guardian, told him what had occurred,
  and advised what was to be done. Sergius, armed with two similar knives, had
  locked himself into his cell. At the command of the Guardian six lay-brothers
  burst open the door, and beat the knives from his hands with sticks, then
  dragged him off to the punishment-cell, where they placed him under watch.
  Next morning I went with the Guardian, as I had advised, to the president of
  the Spiritual Commission, the Baron von Kresel, to inform him that Father
  Sergius had gone raving mad, and to ask that he might be committed to the
  custody of the Brothers of Mercy. This was at once granted; and I left the
  Guardian to instruct the fanatic how to comport himself in the hospital as a
  lunatic, so as not to bring his superiors into further difficulties."</p>

  <p>The first acquaintance Fessler made in Lemberg, was a renegade Franciscan
  friar, who had been appointed Professor of Physic, "He was a man of unbounded
  ambition and avarice, a political fanatic, and a complete atheist." Joseph
  afterwards appointed this man to be mitred abbot of Zazvár. He died on the
  scaffold in 1795, executed for high treason.</p>

  <p>The seminarists of the Catholic and of the Uniat Churches as well as the
  pupils from the religious Orders were obliged to attend Fessler's lectures.
  These were on the lines of these of Monsperger. Some of the clergy in charge
  of the Seminarists were so uneasy at Fessler's teaching that they stood up at
  his lectures and disputed his assertions; but Fessler boasts that after a
  couple of months he got the young men round to his views, and they groaned,
  hooted and stamped down the remonstrants. He published at this time two
  works, <i>Institutiones linguarum orientalium</i>, and a Hebrew anthology for
  the use of the students. In the latter he laid down certain canons for the
  interpretation of the Old Testament, by means of which everything miraculous
  might be explained away.</p>

  <p>It was really intolerable that the candidates for orders should be
  forcibly taught to disbelieve everything their Church required them to hold.
  In his inspection of the monasteries, in the suppression of many, Joseph
  acted with justice, and the conscience of the people approved, but in this
  matter of the education of the clergy he violated the principles of common
  justice, and the consequence was such wide-spread irritation, that Joseph for
  a moment seemed inclined to give way. That Joseph knew the rationalism of
  Fessler is certain. The latter gives a conversation he had with the Emperor,
  in which they discussed the "Ruah," the Spirit of God, which moved on the
  face of the waters, as said in the first chapter of Genesis. Fessler told him
  that he considered "the expression to be a Hebrew superlative, and to mean no
  more than that a violent gale was blowing. Possibly," he added, "Moses may
  have thought of the Schiva in the Hindoo Trimurti; for he was reared in all
  the wisdom of the Egyptians, who were an Ethiopic race, which was in turn an
  Indian colony." Dr. Fessler's Ethnology was faulty, whatever may be thought
  of his Theology.</p>

  <p>After having given this explanation to the Emperor, Fessler boldly asked
  him for a bishopric&mdash;he who loathed his priesthood and disbelieved in
  revealed religion!</p>

  <p>Joseph did not give him a mitre, but made him Professor of Doctrinal
  Theology and Catholic Polemics as well as of Biblical Exegesis. This did not
  satisfy the ambitious soul of Fessler, he was bent on a mitre. He waited with
  growing impatience. He sent his books to Joseph. He did his utmost to force
  himself into his notice. But the desired mitre did not come.</p>

  <p>Fessler complains that scandalous stories circulated about him whilst at
  Lemberg, and these possibly may have reached the imperial ears. He asserts,
  and no doubt with perfect truth, that these were unfounded. He had made
  himself bitter enemies, and they would not scruple to defame him. He boasts
  that at Lemberg he contracted no Platonic alliances; he had no
  <i>attachements de coeur</i> there at all.</p>

  <p>The Emperor seemed to have forgotten him, to have cast aside his useful
  tool. Filled with the bitterness of defeated ambition, in 1788 he wrote a
  drama, entitled James II., a covert attack on his protector, Joseph II., whom
  he represented as falling away in his enthusiasm for reform, and succumbing
  to the gathering hostility of Obscurantists and Jesuits.</p>

  <p>This was not the case, but Joseph was in trouble with his refractory
  subjects in the Low Countries, who would not have his seminaries and
  professors, who subscribed for the support of the ousted teachers, and rioted
  at the introduction of the new professors to the University of Louvain.</p>

  <p>The play was put into rehearsal, but the police interfered, and it was
  forbidden. Fessler either feared or was warned that he was about to be
  arrested, and he escaped over the frontier into Prussian Silesia. Joseph II.
  died in 1790, broken in spirit by his failures.</p>

  <p>Fessler, after his escape from Austria, became a salaried reader and
  secretary to the Count of Carolath, whose wife was a princess of
  Saxe-Meiningen.</p>

  <p>After a while he married a young woman of the middle class; he seems to
  have doubted whether they would be happy together, after he had proposed,
  accordingly he wrote her a long epistle, in the most pedantic and dictorial
  style, informing her of what his requirements were, and warning her to
  withdraw from the contemplated union, if she were not sure she would come up
  to the level of the perfect wife. The poor creature no doubt wondered at the
  marvellous love letter, but had no hesitation in saying she would do her duty
  up to her lights. The result was not happy. They led together a cat-and-dog
  life for ten years. She was a homely person without intellectual parts, and
  he was essentially a book-worm. He admits that he did not shine in society,
  and leaves it to be understood that the loss was on the side of
  inappreciative society, but we can not help suspecting that he was
  opinionated, sour, and uncouth. All these qualities were intensified in the
  narrow circle of home. After ten years of misery he divorced his wife on the
  ground of mutual incompatibility. For a livelihood he took up Freemasonry,
  and went about founding lodges. There were three rogues at that period who
  worked Freemasonry for their own ends, the Darmstadt Court Chaplain, Starck,
  a Baron von Hundt, and a certain Becker, who called himself Johnson, and
  pretended to be a delegate from the mysterious, unknown head of the Society
  in Aberdeen. They called themselves Masons of the Strict Observance, but were
  mere swindlers.</p>

  <p>After a while, Freemasonry lost its attractions for Fessler, probably it
  ceased to pay, and then he left Breslau, and wandered into Prussia. He wrote
  a novel called "Marcus Aurelius," glorifying that emperor, for whom he
  entertained great veneration, and did other literary work, which brought him
  in a little money. Then he married again, a young, beautiful and gifted
  woman, with a small property. He was very happy in his choice, but less happy
  in the speculation in which he invested her money and that of her sisters. It
  failed, and they were reduced to extreme poverty. What became of the sisters
  we do not know. Fessler with his wife and children went into Russia, and
  sponged for some time on the Moravian Brothers, who treated him with great
  kindness, and lent him money, "Which," he says, in his autobiography, "I have
  not yet been able to pay back altogether."</p>

  <p>He lost some of his children. Distress, pecuniary embarrassments, and
  sickness, softened his heart, and perhaps with that was combined a perception
  that if he could get a pastorate he would be provided for;[22] this led to a
  conversion, which looks very much as if it were copied from the famous
  conversion of St. Augustine. It possibly was, to some extent, sincere; he
  recovered faith in God, and joined the Lutheran community.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[22] He had, however, just received a pension from the
  Czar, so that he was relieved from abject poverty.</p>

  <p>Then he had his case and attainments brought under the notice of the Czar,
  who was, at the time, as Fessler probably knew, engaged in a scheme for
  organising the Lutheran bodies in Finland into a Church under Episcopal
  government. He chose Fessler to be bishop of Saratow, and had him consecrated
  by the Swedish bishops, "Who," says Fessler, "like the Anglican bishops, have
  preserved the Apostolic succession." He makes much of this point, a curious
  instance of the revival in his mind of old ideas imbibed in his time of
  Catholicity. . According to his own account, he was a bishop quite on the
  Apostolic model, and worked very hard to bring his diocese into order. His
  ordination was in 1820. In 1833, the Saratow consistory was dissolved, and he
  retired to St. Petersburg, where he was appointed general superintendent of
  the Lutheran community in the capital. He married a third time, but says very
  little of the last wife. He concludes with this estimate of his own
  character, which is hardly that at which a reader of his autobiography would
  arrive. "Earnestness and cheerfulness, rapid decision, and unbending
  determination, manly firmness and childlike trueheartedness&mdash;these are
  the ever recurring fundamental characteristics of my nature. Add to these a
  gentle mysticism, to surround the others with colour and unite them in
  harmony. Sometimes it may be that dissonances occur, it may be true that
  occasionally I thunder with powerful lungs in my house, as if I were about to
  wreck and shatter everything, but that is called forth only by what is wrong.
  In my inmost being calm, peace, and untroubled cheerfulness reign supreme.
  Discontent, wrath, venom and gall, have not embittered one moment of my
  life."[23]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[23] "Of myself," he says, "I must confess that I have
  heard great and famous preachers, true Bourdaloues, Massillons, Zollikofers,
  &amp;c, in Vienna, Carolath, Breslau, Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, Hanover, and
  have been pleased with the contents, arrangement, and delivery of their
  sermons; but never once have I felt my heart stirred with religious emotion.
  On the contrary, on the 25th March, 1782, when Pius VI. said mass in the
  Capuchin Church, and on the 31st March, when he blessed the people, I
  trembled on the edge of conviction and religious faith, and was only held
  back by my inability to distinguish between religion and the Church system.
  Still more now does the Sermon on the Mount move me, and for the last 23
  years the divine liturgical prayer in John xvii., does not fail to stir my
  very soul."</p>
