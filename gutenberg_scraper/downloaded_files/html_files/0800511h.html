  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; IN WHICH I MAKE DRUMMOND'S ACQUAINTANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Even now, after three months' calm thought, I sometimes feel
  that I must have dreamed the whole thing. I say to myself that this is
  England: that I am sitting at lunch in my club hoping that that gluttonous
  lawyer Seybourne will not take all the best part of the Stilton: that unless
  I get a move on I shall be very late at Lord's. I say all that just as I
  always used to say it&mdash;particularly about Seybourne. And then it
  suddenly comes over me&mdash;the events of those amazing days.</p>

  <p>I don't suppose anybody will believe me: I wouldn't believe the story
  myself if somebody else told it to me. As I say, I sometimes think it must be
  a dream. And then I turn back my left sleeve nearly to the elbow and look at
  a three-inch scar, still red and angry, though it's healing nicely now. And I
  know it was no dream.</p>

  <p>Was it a joke? If so, it was the grimmest and most desperate jest that has
  ever been cracked, and one wherein the humour was difficult to find.
  Moreover, it was a joke that would have brought the propounder of it to the
  gallows&mdash;had we but been able to catch her. For there was a woman at the
  bottom of it, and women can suffer the death penalty in England for
  murder.</p>

  <p>No it was no dream: no jest. It was grim, stern reality played for a stake
  sufficient to crack the nerve of the principal player on our side had he been
  possessed of nerves to crack. A game played against time: a game where one
  mistake might have proved fatal.</p>

  <p>Personally I am a peace-loving individual of mild appearance: I like my
  rubber of bridge at the club and my round of golf: I am not averse to letting
  people know that I was wounded in the leg in France. Moreover, I fail to see
  why I should gratuitously add the information that I was in the horse lines
  at the time, and Heaven alone knows where the bullet came from. I mention
  these points merely to show that I am just a very ordinary sort of person,
  and not at all of the type which seems to attract adventure. In fact, until
  that amazing Whitsun, the only thing in any way out of the ordinary which had
  ever happened to me was when I, on one occasion, tried to stop a runaway
  horse. And the annoying thing then was that the driver assured me he had the
  horse under control. Three weeks had elapsed, and I was still in hospital, so
  I didn't argue the point.</p>

  <p>The truth is that I am not one of those enviable men who are at their best
  when in a tight corner, or when confronted with the need for immediate
  action. If, as I read somewhere once, men consist of two classes&mdash;those
  who can stop a dog fight and those who can't&mdash;honesty compels me to
  admit that I belong to the latter. In fact, put in a nutshell, I am a
  rabbit.</p>

  <p>And yet I wouldn't have missed that adventure for anything. I can't
  flatter myself that I did very much: indeed, there were times when I fear I
  was merely in the way. For all that, never once did a single member of the
  extraordinary bunch of men who were playing on our side say any word of
  reproach or irritation. They never let me feel that I was a passenger even
  when the strain was greatest.</p>

  <p>However, enough of this preamble. I will start at the beginning. For many
  years it has been my custom to spend a few days round Whitsuntide with some
  old friends of mine called Tracey. They have a charming house not far from
  Pangbourne&mdash;Elizabethan, and standing in delightful grounds. There is
  generally a small party&mdash;perhaps a dozen in all&mdash;and I may say that
  the keyword to the atmosphere of the house is peace. It may be that I am a
  little old-fashioned, but the pleasure to be derived from what is sometimes
  described as an evening's jolly seems to me to be overrated.</p>

  <p>As usual I went to them this year, arriving on the Thursday before
  Whitsuntide. The motor met me at the station, and, having shaken Jenkins, the
  chauffeur, by the hand, I got in. Somewhat to my surprise, he did not at once
  drive off: he appeared to be waiting for someone else.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond, sir," he said to me, "who is stopping at the house,
  came down to get a paper."</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond, Jenkins," I mused. "Do I know him?"</p>

  <p>"I think not, sir," he answered, and it seemed to me that a very faint
  smile twitched round his lips. In fact, there was a sort of air of expectancy
  about Jenkins&mdash;excitement almost&mdash;that was most unusual. Jenkins I
  have always regarded as a model servant.</p>

  <p>"Five to one, my trusty lad. That's better than breaking your false teeth
  on a plum stone."</p>

  <p>I turned at this somewhat astounding utterance and regarded the speaker.
  He was still immersed in the paper, and for the moment I couldn't see his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Put anything on Moongazer?"</p>

  <p>"'Alf a dollar each way, sir," said Jenkins, so far forgetting himself as
  to suck his teeth in his excitement.</p>

  <p>"You'll get your money back. Second at fours. That's not so bad for the
  old firm."</p>

  <p>"Pity about cook, sir," said Jenkins earnestly. "She don't 'old with
  backing both ways. Moongazer&mdash;win only&mdash;she was." He consulted a
  small notebook, apparently to verify the statement.</p>

  <p>"That sheds a bit of gloom over the afternoon, Jenkins."</p>

  <p>Captain Drummond lowered the paper, and seemed to become aware of my
  existence for the first time. "Hullo! hullo! hullo!" he exclaimed. "The new
  arrival. Home, Jenkins&mdash;and for God's sake don't break it to the cook
  till after dinner."</p>

  <p>He got into the car, and it struck me that I had seldom seen a larger
  individual.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is quite wise to encourage the servants to bet?" I
  inquired a little pointedly as we started.</p>

  <p>"Encourage, old lad?" he boomed. "They don't want any encouragement. You
  have to keep 'em off it with a field gun."</p>

  <p>He waved a friendly hand at an extremely pretty girl on the pavement, and
  I took off my hat.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" he said, turning to me.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I answered. "I thought you waved at her."</p>

  <p>"But you took off your hat."</p>

  <p>"Because you waved at her."</p>

  <p>He pondered deeply.</p>

  <p>"I follow your reasoning," he conceded at length. "The false premise, if I
  may say so, is your conclusion that a friendly gesture of the right hand
  betokens previous acquaintance. I regret to say I do not know the lady: I
  probably never shall. Still, we have doubtless planted hope in her virginal
  bosom." He relapsed into silence, while I glanced at him out of the corner of
  my eye. A strange individual, I reflected: one, somehow, I could hardly place
  at the Traceys'. Now that he was sitting beside me he seemed larger than
  ever&mdash;evidently a very powerful man. Moreover, his face was rather of
  the type that one associates with pugilism. He certainly had no claims to
  good looks, and yet there was something very attractive about his
  expression.</p>

  <p>"The Cat and Custard Pot," he remarked suddenly, and Jenkins touched his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"It's nearly an hour," he said, turning to me, "since I lowered any ale.
  And I don't really know Bill Tracey well enough to reason with him about his.
  The damned stuff isn't fit to drink."</p>

  <p>The car pulled up outside a pub, and my companion descended. I refused his
  invitation to join him&mdash;ale is not a favourite beverage of
  mine&mdash;and remained sitting in the car. The afternoon was warm, the air
  heavy with the scent of flowers from a neighbouring garden. And in the
  distance one got a glimpse of the peaceful Thames. Peaceful&mdash;the mot
  juste: everything was peaceful in that charming corner of England. And with a
  feeling of drowsy contentment I lay back and half closed my eyes.</p>

  <p>I don't know what drew my attention to them first&mdash;the two men who
  were sitting at one of the little tables under a tree. Perhaps it was that
  they didn't seem quite to fit in with their surroundings. Foreigners, I
  decided, and yet it was more from the cut of their clothes than from their
  actual faces that I came to the conclusion. They weren't talking, but every
  now and then they stole a glance at the door by which Drummond had gone in.
  And then one of them turned suddenly and stared long and earnestly at me.</p>

  <p>"Who are those two men, Jenkins?" I said, leaning forward.</p>

  <p>"Never seen 'em before today, sir," he answered. "But they was 'ere when
  the Captain stopped for his pint on the way down. Lumme&mdash;look
  there."</p>

  <p>I looked, and I must admit that for a moment or too I began to have doubts
  as to Drummond's sanity. He had evidently come out by some other door, and he
  was now standing behind the trunk of the tree under which the men were
  sitting. They were obviously quite unaware of his presence, and if such a
  thing hadn't been inconceivable I should have said he was deliberately
  eavesdropping. Anyway, the fact remains that for nearly half a minute he
  stood there absolutely motionless, whilst I watched the scene in frank
  amazement. Then one of the two men happened to glance at me, and I suppose my
  face must have given something away. He nudged his companion, and the two of
  them rose to their feet just as Drummond stepped out from behind the
  tree.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, my pretties," he burbled genially. "Are we staying long
  in Pangbourne's happy clime&mdash;or are we not?"</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you, sir?" said one of the men, speaking perfect
  English, except for a slightly guttural accent.</p>

  <p>Drummond took out his case and selected a cigarette with care.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he remarked pleasantly, "your incompetence cannot be as
  astounding as all that. Tush! tush!&mdash;"; he lifted a hand like a leg of
  mutton as the man who had spoken started forward angrily. "I will push your
  face in later, if necessary, but just at the moment I would like a little
  chat. And since the appearance of you both is sufficient to shake any man to
  the foundations, let us not waste time over unnecessary questions."</p>

  <p>"Look here," snarled the other angrily, "do you want a rough house, young
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Rough house?" said Drummond mildly. "What is a rough house? Surely you
  cannot imagine for one minute that I would so far demean myself as to lift my
  hand in anger against my neighbour."</p>

  <p>And then the most extraordinary thing happened. I was watching the strange
  scene very closely, wondering really whether I ought not to
  interfere&mdash;yet even so I didn't see how it was done. It was so
  incredibly quick, and as far as I could tell, Drummond never moved.</p>

  <p>The two men seemed to close in on him suddenly with the idea obviously of
  hustling him out of the garden. And they didn't hustle him out of the garden.
  Far from it. There came a noise as of two hard bodies impinging together, and
  the gentleman who had not yet spoken recoiled a pace, holding his nose and
  cursing.</p>

  <p>I sympathized with him: it is a singularly painful thing to hit one's nose
  hard on somebody else's head. In fact, the only completely unmoved person was
  Drummond himself.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't kiss in public places, laddies," he remarked sadly. "It
  might make the barmaid jealous. And I do declare his little nosey-posey is
  beginning to bleed. If you ask the chauffeur nicely he might lend you a
  spanner to put down your back."</p>

  <p>The two men stood there glaring at him, and they were not a prepossessing
  pair. And then the one who had done the talking drew his friend of the
  damaged nose on one side, and spoke to him in a low tone. He seemed to be
  urging some course on the other which the latter was unwilling to accept.</p>

  <p>"My God, sir," muttered Jenkins to me, "the bloke with the bleeding nose
  has got a knife."</p>

  <p>"Look out. Captain Drummond," I called out. "That man has a knife."</p>

  <p>"I know, old lad," he answered. "He's been playing at pirates. Not going,
  surely? Why, we've never had our little chat."</p>

  <p>But without a backward glance, the two men passed through the gate and
  started walking rapidly down the road in the direction of the station. And
  after a time Drummond sauntered over to the car and got in.</p>

  <p>"After which breezy little interlude," he murmured, "the powerful car
  again swung forward, devouring mile after mile."</p>

  <p>"Would you very much mind explaining?" I remarked dazedly.</p>

  <p>"Explaining?" he said. "What is there to explain?"</p>

  <p>"Do you usually go about the country molesting perfect strangers? Who are
  those men?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," he answered. "But they knew me all right." He was staring at
  the road ahead and frowning. "It's impossible," he muttered at length. "And
  yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He relapsed into silence, while I still gazed at him in amazement. "But,"
  I cried, "it's astounding. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I couldn't
  have believed it possible."</p>

  <p>He grinned suddenly. "I suppose it was a bit disconcerting," he answered.
  "But we're moving in deep waters, laddie&mdash;or, rather, I am. And I tell
  you frankly I don't quite know where I am. Why should those two blokes have
  followed me down here?"</p>

  <p>"Then you have seen them before?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No. At least, I saw them when I stopped for some ale
  on the way down to the station. And they aren't very clever at it."</p>

  <p>"Clever at what?"</p>

  <p>"The little game of observing without being observed. Apart from their
  appearance, which made them stick out a mile when seen in an English country
  inn, the man whose nose suffered slightly positively hissed into the other's
  ear when he first saw me. In fact, I very nearly dealt with them then and
  there, only I was afraid I'd be late for your train."</p>

  <p>"But why should they follow you?" I persisted. "What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I knew," he answered gravely. "I don't think I'm losing my
  nerve, or anything of that sort&mdash;but I'm absolutely in the dark. Almost
  as much as you are, in fact. I loathe this waiting game."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I remarked resignedly, "I suppose I am not insane. I suppose
  there is some sense in all this, though at the moment I'm damned if I can see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Presumably you read Kipling?" he said suddenly. I stared at him in
  silence&mdash;speech was beyond me. "A month ago," he continued calmly, "I
  received this."</p>

  <p>From his breast pocket he took a slip of paper, and handed it to me. On it
  some lines were written in an obviously feminine hand.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:0; margin-left:25%"><i>When the Himalayan peasant meets
  the he-bear in his pride,</i><br>
  <i>He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside.</i><br>
  <i>But the she-bear, thus accosted, rends the peasant tooth and nail.</i><br>
  <i>And the point, I warn you, Drummond, is discovered in the tail.</i></p>

  <p>I handed the paper back to him.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It looks like a stupid joke," I said. "Do you know the writing?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; I don't. So you think it's a joke, do you?"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," I cried, "what else can it be? I confess that at the moment
  I forget the poem, but the first three lines are obviously Kipling. Equally
  obviously the fourth is not."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," he agreed with a faint smile. "I got as far as that myself.
  And so it was the fourth line that attracted my attention. It seemed to me
  that the message, if any, would be found in it. It was."</p>

  <p>"What is the fourth line?" I asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"'For the female of the species is more deadly than the male'" he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"But, surely," I cried in amazement, "you can't take a thing like that
  seriously. It's probably a foolish hoax sent you by some girl you cut at a
  night club."</p>

  <p>I laughed a little irritably: for a man to take such a message in earnest
  struck me as being childish to a degree. A stupid jest played by some silly
  girl, with a penchant for being mysterious. Undoubtedly, I reflected, the man
  was a fool. And, anyway, what had it got to do with the two men at the Cat
  and Custard Pot?</p>

  <p>"'The female of the species is more deadly than the male,'" he repeated,
  as if he hadn't heard my remark. "No hoax about it, old lad; no jest, believe
  you me. Just a plain and simple warning. And now the game has begun."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two I wondered if he was pulling my leg; but he was so
  deadly serious that I realized that he, at any rate, believed it was genuine.
  And my feeling of irritation grew. What an ass the man must be! "What game?"
  I asked sarcastically. "Playing peep-bo behind the trees?"</p>

  <p>He let out a sudden roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>"You probably think I'm bughouse, don't you?" he cried. "Doesn't matter.
  The only real tragedy of the day is that the cook didn't back Moongazer each
  way."</p>

  <p>Once again he relapsed into silence as the car rolled through the gates of
  the Traceys' house.</p>

  <p>"Good intelligence work," he said thoughtfully. "We only decided to come
  down here yesterday. But I wish to the Lord you'd learn to control your face.
  If you hadn't given a lifelike representation of a gargoyle in pain I might
  have heard something of interest from those two blighters."</p>

  <p>"Confound you!" I spluttered angrily.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't help it." He waved a vast hand, and beat me on the back. "I
  ought to have warned you. Must have looked a bit odd. But it's a
  pity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The car pulled up at the door, and he got out.</p>

  <p>"Little Willie wants a drink," he remarked to Tracey, who came out to
  greet us. "His nervous system has had a shock. By the way, where's
  Phyllis?"</p>

  <p>"Playing tennis," said our host, and Drummond strolled off in the
  direction of the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Look here. Bill," I cried when he was out of earshot, "is that man all
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Hugh Drummond all there?" he laughed. "Very few men in England more so.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if he hits me on the back again I shan't be. He's rammed my braces
  through my spine. But, honestly, I thought the man was mad. He's been talking
  the most appalling hot air on the way up, and he assaulted two complete
  strangers at the Cat and Custard Pot."</p>

  <p>Bill Tracey stared at me in surprise. "Assaulted two strangers at the Cat
  and Custard Pot!" he repeated. "What on earth did he do that for?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," I said irritably. "Two foreign-looking men."</p>

  <p>"That's funny," he remarked thoughtfully. "Rodgers&mdash;the
  gardener&mdash;was telling me only a few minutes ago that he had seen two
  foreign-looking men hanging round the house this morning, and had told them
  to clear off. I wonder if they were the same."</p>

  <p>"Probably," I said. "But the fact that they were hanging round here hardly
  seems an adequate reason for Captain Drummond's behaviour. In fact, my dear
  Bill&mdash;What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>He was staring over my shoulder in the direction of the lawn, and I swung
  round. Drummond was running towards us over the grass, and there was a
  peculiar strained look on his face. He passed us without a word, and went up
  the stairs two at a time. We heard a door flung open, and then we saw him
  leaning out of his bedroom window.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it, Algy," he said. "Not one little bit."</p>

  <p>A somewhat vacuous-looking individual with an eyeglass had joined us, whom
  the remark was obviously addressed to.</p>

  <p>"Ain't she there, old bean?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Not a trace," answered the other, disappearing from view.</p>

  <p>"Can't understand old Hugh," remarked the newcomer plaintively. "I've
  never seen him in this condition before. If I didn't think it was impossible
  I should say he'd got the wind up."</p>

  <p>"What's stung you all?" said Bill Tracey. "Isn't Mrs Drummond playing
  tennis?"</p>

  <p>"She was&mdash;after lunch," answered Algy. "Then she got a note. Your
  butler wallah brought it out to her on the court. It seemed to upset her a
  bit, for she stopped at once and came into the house."</p>

  <p>"Where," remarked Drummond, who had joined us, "she changed her clothes.
  It was a note, was it, Algy: not a letter? I mean, did you happen to notice
  if there was a stamp on the envelope?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, old lad, I particularly noticed there was not. I was
  sitting next her when she took it."</p>

  <p>The butler passed us at that moment, carrying the tea things.</p>

  <p>"Parker," said Drummond quietly, "you gave a note to Mrs Drummond this
  afternoon, I understand."</p>

  <p>"I did, sir," answered the butler.</p>

  <p>"Did you take it yourself at the front door?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir."</p>

  <p>"Who delivered it?"</p>

  <p>"A man, sir, who I did not know. A stranger to the neighbourhood, I
  gathered."</p>

  <p>"Why?" snapped Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Because, sir, he asked me the nearest way to the station."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Parker," said Drummond quietly. "Algy, it's quicker than I
  expected. Hullo! Jenkins, do you want me?"</p>

  <p>The chauffeur touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you know you asked me to adjust your carburettor for you. I
  was just wondering if you could tell me when the car will be back."</p>

  <p>"Be back?" said Drummond. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, the Bentley ain't in the garage. I thought as 'ow Mrs Drummond
  had probably taken it out."</p>

  <p>And if anything had been needed to confirm my opinion that this vast
  individual was a little peculiar, I got it then. He lifted his two enormous
  fists above his head and shook them at the sky. I could see the great muscles
  rippling under his sleeves, and instinctively I recoiled a step.</p>

  <p>The man looked positively dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Thrice and unutterably damned fool that I am," he muttered. "But how
  could I tell it would come so soon?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," said Bill Tracey, gazing at him apprehensively, "surely
  there is nothing to get excited about. Mrs Drummond is a very good
  driver."</p>

  <p>"Driver be jiggered," cried Drummond. "If it was only a question of
  driving I wouldn't mind. I'm afraid they've got her. For the Lord's sake,
  give me a pint of ale. Yours is pretty bad&mdash;but it's better than
  nothing."</p>

  <p>And then he suddenly turned on me of all people.</p>

  <p>"If only you could have kept your face in its place, little man, I might
  have heard something. Still, it can't be helped. God made you like it."</p>

  <p>"Really," I protested angrily, but this extraordinary individual had gone
  indoors again. "The man is positively insulting."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to what he can be if he dislikes you," said the being called Algy
  placidly. "He'll be all right after he's had his beer."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; IN WHICH I FIND A DESERTED MOTOR CAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now, in view of the fact that this is my first essay in
  literature, I realize that many of my relatives may feel it their bounden
  duty to buy the result. Several, I know, will borrow a copy from one another,
  or else will endeavour to touch me for one of the six free copies which, I am
  given to understand, the author receives on publication. But most of them, in
  one way or another, will read it. And I am particularly anxious, bearing in
  mind the really astounding situations in which I found myself later, that no
  misconception should exist in their minds as to my mood at the beginning.</p>

  <p>Particularly Uncle Percy&mdash;the Dean of Wolverhampton. He is, I am glad
  to say, a man of advanced years and considerable wealth. He is also
  unmarried, a fact which has never occasioned me great surprise. But few women
  exist who would be capable of dealing with his intellect or digestion, and so
  far he does not seem to have met one of them. For his benefit, then, and that
  of others who know me personally, I may state that when I saw Captain
  Drummond engaged in the operation, as he called it, of 'golluping his beer
  with zest', I was extremely angry. He, on the contrary, seemed to have
  recovered his spirits. No longer did he shake his fists in the air; on the
  contrary, a most depressing noise issued from his mouth as he put down the
  empty tankard on the table. He appeared to be singing, and, incredible though
  it may seem, to derive some pleasure from the operation. The words of his
  dirge seemed to imply that the more we were together the merrier we would
  be&mdash;a statement to which I took the gravest exception.</p>

  <p>I was to learn afterwards the amazing way in which this amazing individual
  could throw off a serious mood and become positively hilarious. For
  instance&mdash;on this occasion&mdash;having delivered himself of this
  deplorable sentiment, he advanced towards me. Fearing another blow on the
  back, I retreated rapidly, but he no longer meditated assault. He desired
  apparently to examine my cuff-links, a thing which did not strike me as being
  in the best of taste.</p>

  <p>"You approve, I trust?" I said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I feared as much," he remarked. "Or have you left 'em at home?" he added
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>I turned to Bill Tracey. "Have you turned this place into a private
  lunatic asylum?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>And all Bill did was to shout with laughter. "Cheer up, Joe," he said.
  "You'll learn our little ways soon."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," I remarked stiffly. "In the meantime I think I'll go and have
  some tea."</p>

  <p>I crossed the lawn to find several people I knew assembled in the
  summerhouse. And, having paid my respects to my hostess, and been introduced
  to two or three strangers, I sat down with a feeling of relief beside
  Tomkinson, a dear old friend of mine.</p>

  <p>"Really," I said to him under cover of the general conversation, "there
  seem to be some very extraordinary people in this party. Who and what is that
  enormous man who calls himself Drummond?"</p>

  <p>He laughed, and lit a cigarette. "He does strike one as a bit odd at
  first, doesn't he? But as a matter of fact, your adjective was right. He is
  an extraordinary man. He did some feats of strength for us last night that
  wouldn't have disgraced a professional strong man."</p>

  <p>"He nearly smashed my spine," I said grimly, "giving it a playful
  tap."</p>

  <p>"He is not communicative about himself," went on Tomkinson. "And what
  little I know about him I have learned from that fellow with the
  eyeglass&mdash;Algy Longworth&mdash;who incidentally regards him as only one
  degree lower than the Almighty. He has got a very charming wife."</p>

  <p>He glanced round the party.</p>

  <p>"You won't see her here," I remarked. "She has apparently taken his
  Bentley and gone out in it alone. Having discovered this fact, he first of
  all announces 'They've got her!' in blood-curdling tones, and then proceeds
  to lower inordinate quantities of ale. And his behaviour coming up from the
  station&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's that you said?"</p>

  <p>A man whose face was vaguely familiar turned and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"Why, surely you're Mr Darrell!" I cried. "You play for Middlesex?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I do&mdash;sometimes. But what's that you were saying about Drummond
  having said 'They've got her?'"</p>

  <p>"Just that&mdash;and nothing more," I answered. "As I was telling
  Tomkinson, Mrs Drummond has apparently gone out in his Bentley alone, and
  when he heard of it he said, 'They've got her.' But who 'they' are I can't
  tell you."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" His face had suddenly become grave. "There must be a mistake.
  And yet Hugh doesn't make mistakes."</p>

  <p>He made the last remark under his breath.</p>

  <p>"It all seems a little hard to follow," I murmured with mild sarcasm. But
  he paid no attention: he had glanced up quickly, and was staring over my
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What's this I hear about Phyllis, old boy?" he said.</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows, Peter." Drummond was standing there with a queer look on
  his face. "She got a note delivered here by a stranger. It came while I was
  at the station. And Algy said it seemed to upset her. Anyway, she went
  indoors and changed, and then went out alone in the Bentley."</p>

  <p>A silence had fallen on the party which was broken by our hostess. "But
  why should that worry you. Captain Drummond? Your wife often drives, she
  tells me."</p>

  <p>"She knows no one in this neighbourhood. Mrs Tracey, except your good
  selves," answered Drummond quietly. "So who could have sent a note here to be
  delivered by hand?"</p>

  <p>"Well, evidently somebody did," I remarked. "And when Mrs Drummond returns
  you'll find out who it was."</p>

  <p>I spoke somewhat coldly: the man was becoming a bore.</p>

  <p>"If she ever does return," he answered.</p>

  <p>I regret to state that I laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," I cried, "don't be absurd. You surely can't believe, or
  expect us to believe, that some evilly-disposed persons are abducting your
  wife in broad daylight and in the middle of England?"</p>

  <p>But he still stood there with that queer look on his face. "Peter," he
  said, "I want to have a bit of a talk with you."</p>

  <p>Darrell rose instantly, and the two of them strolled away together.
  "Really," I remarked irritably, when they were out of earshot, "the thing is
  perfectly preposterous. Is he doing it as a joke, or what?" Algy Longworth
  had joined them, and the three of them were standing in the middle of the
  lawn talking earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I must say it does all seem very funny," agreed our hostess. "And yet
  Captain Drummond isn't the sort of man to make stupid jokes of that
  sort."</p>

  <p>"You mean," I said incredulously, "that he really believes that someone
  may be abducting his wife? My dear Mary, don't be so ridiculous. Why should
  anyone abduct his wife?"</p>

  <p>"He's led a very strange life since the War," she answered. "I confess I
  don't know much about it myself&mdash;neither he nor his friends are very
  communicative. But I know he got mixed up with a gang of criminals."</p>

  <p>"I am not surprised," I murmured under my breath.</p>

  <p>"I'm not very clear about what happened," went on Mary Tracey. "But
  finally Captain Drummond was responsible somehow or other for the death of
  the leader of the gang. And a woman, who had been this man's mistress, was
  left behind."</p>

  <p>I stared at her: absurd, of course, but that bit of doggerel at the end of
  Kipling's verse came back to me. And then common-sense reasserted itself.
  This was England, not a country where secret societies nourished and strange
  vendettas took place. The whole thing was a mere coincidence. What connection
  could there possibly be between the two men at the Cat and Custard Pot and
  the fact that Mrs Drummond had gone out alone in a motor car?</p>

  <p>"It seems," Mary Tracey was speaking again, "from what Bill tells me, that
  this woman vowed vengeance on Captain Drummond. I know it sounds very
  fantastic, and I expect we shall all laugh about it when Phyllis gets back.
  And yet&mdash;" she hesitated for a moment. "Oh! I don't want to be silly,
  but I do wish she'd come back soon."</p>

  <p>"But, Mrs Tracey," said someone reassuringly, "there can be no danger.
  What could happen to her?"</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," I remarked. "If on every occasion a woman went out alone
  in a motor car her friends and relations panicked about her being abducted,
  life would become a hideous affair."</p>

  <p>And then by tacit consent the subject dropped, and we dispersed about our
  lawful occasions. I didn't see Drummond, but Darrell and Longworth were
  practising putting on the other side of the lawn. I strolled over and joined
  them.</p>

  <p>"Your large friend," I laughed, "seems to have put the wind up most of the
  ladies in the party fairly successfully."</p>

  <p>But they neither of them seemed to regard it as a subject for mirth.</p>

  <p>"Let us hope it will end at that," said Darrell gravely. "I confess that I
  have rarely been so uneasy in my life."</p>

  <p>And that, mark you, from a man who played for Middlesex! Really, I
  reflected, the thing was ceasing to be funny. And I was just getting a
  suitable remark ready, when Longworth suddenly straightened up and stared
  across the lawn. Bill Tracey was coming towards us, and at his side was a
  police sergeant. And Bill Tracey's face was serious.</p>

  <p>"Where's Drummond?" he called out.</p>

  <p>"He said he was going to stroll down to the river," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>He cupped his mouth with his hands and let out a shout that startled the
  rooks for miles around. And very faintly from the distance came an answering
  cry.</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," answered Bill uneasily. "Quite possibly it's capable of
  some simple explanation. Apparently the Bentley has been found empty.
  However, we'd better wait till Drummond comes, and then the sergeant can tell
  his story."</p>

  <p>I noticed Darrell glance significantly at Longworth; then he calmly
  resumed the study of a long putt. With a bang the ball went into the hole,
  and he straightened himself up.</p>

  <p>"My game, Algy. So Hugh was right: I was afraid of it. Here he comes."</p>

  <p>We watched him breasting the hill that led down to the river, running with
  the long, easy stride of the born athlete. And it's curious how little things
  strike one at times. I remember noticing as he came up that his breathing was
  as normal as my own, though he must have run the best part of a quarter of a
  mile.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" he said curtly, his eyes fixed on the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Are you Captain Drummond?" remarked the officer, producing a
  notebook.</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"Of 5a, Upper Brook Street?" He was reading these details from the book in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"You have a red Bentley car numbered ZZ 103?"</p>

  <p>"I have," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>With maddening deliberation the worthy sergeant replaced his notebook in
  his breast pocket. And another curious little thing struck me: though
  Drummond must have been on edge with suspense, no sign of impatience showed
  in his face.</p>

  <p>"Have you been out in that car today, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," said Drummond. "But my wife has."</p>

  <p>"Was she alone, sir?"</p>

  <p>"To the best of my belief she was," answered Drummond. "She left here when
  I was down at the station in Mr Tracey's car meeting this gentleman."</p>

  <p>The sergeant nodded his head portentously. "Well, sir, I have to report to
  you that your car has been found empty standing by the side of the road not
  far from the village of Tidmarsh."</p>

  <p>"How did you know I was here?" said Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>"The constable who found the car, sir, saw your name and address printed
  on a plate on the instrument board. So he went to the nearest telephone and
  rang up your house in London. And your servant told him you was stopping down
  here. So he rang up at the station in Pangbourne."</p>

  <p>"But why take all the trouble?" said Drummond even more quietly. "Surely
  there's nothing very extraordinary about an empty car beside the road?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," agreed the sergeant. "There ain't. That's true. But the
  constable further reported "&mdash;his voice was grave&mdash;"that he didn't
  like the look of the car. He said it struck him that there had been some sort
  of struggle."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Drummond. Quite calmly he turned to Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Peter&mdash;your Sunbeam, and hump yourself. Algy&mdash;ring up Ted and
  Toby, and tell 'em they're wanted. Put up at the hotel. Sergeant&mdash;you
  come with me. Tracey, ring up the railway station and find out if two
  foreign-looking men have been seen there this afternoon. If so, did they take
  tickets, and for what destination? Let's move."</p>

  <p>And we moved. Gone in a flash was the large and apparently brainless ass;
  in his place was a man accustomed to lead, and accustomed to instant
  obedience. Heaven knows why I got into the Sunbeam: presumably because I was
  the only person who had received no definite instructions. And Drummond
  evinced no surprise when he found me sitting beside him in the back seat. The
  sergeant, a little dazed at such rapidity of action, was in front with
  Darrell, and except for him none of us even had a hat.</p>

  <p>"Tell us the way. Sergeant," said Drummond, as we swung through the gates.
  "And let her out, Peter."</p>

  <p>And Peter let her out. The worthy policeman gasped feebly once or twice
  concerning speed limits, but no one took the faintest notice, so that after a
  time he resigned himself to the inevitable and concentrated on holding on his
  hat. And I, having no hat to hold on, concentrated on the man beside me.</p>

  <p>He seemed almost unaware of my existence. He sat there, motionless save
  for the swaying of the car, staring in front of him. His face was set and
  grave, and every now and then he shook his head as if he had arrived at an
  unpleasant conclusion in his train of thought.</p>

  <p>My own thoughts were frankly incoherent. Somehow or other I still couldn't
  believe that the matter was serious&mdash;certainly not as serious as
  Drummond seemed to think. And yet my former scepticism was shaken, I confess.
  If what the sergeant said was right: if there were signs of a struggle in the
  car, it was undoubtedly sufficiently serious to make it very unpleasant. But
  I still refused to believe that the whole thing was not capable of some
  simple solution. A tramp, perhaps, seeing that an approaching car contained a
  woman alone had stopped it by the simple expedient of standing in the middle
  of the road. Then he had attacked Mrs Drummond with the idea of getting her
  money.</p>

  <p>Unpleasant, as I say&mdash;very unpleasant. But quite ordinary. A very
  different matter to all this absurd twaddle about gangs of criminals and dead
  men's mistresses. Moreover, I reflected, with a certain amount of
  satisfaction, there was another thing that proved my theory. On Drummond's
  own showing he attached considerable importance to the two foreign-looking
  men at the Cat and Custard Pot. Now it was utterly impossible that they could
  have had anything to do with it since they were sitting there in the garden
  at the very time that Mrs Drummond must have left Tracey's house in the car.
  Which completely knocked Drummond's conclusion on the head. The whole thing
  was simply a coincidence, and I said as much to the man beside me. He
  listened in silence.</p>

  <p>"Ever been ratting?" he asked when I'd finished.</p>

  <p>Once more did I stare at this extraordinary individual in amazement. What
  on earth had that got to do with it?</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;have you?" he repeated when I didn't answer.</p>

  <p>"In the days of my youth I believe I did," I answered. "Though the exact
  bearing of a boyish pastime on the point at issue is a little obscure."</p>

  <p>"Then it oughtn't to be," he remarked curtly. "It's only obscure because
  your grey matter is torpid. When a party of you go ratting, you put a bloke
  at every hole you know of before you start to bolt your rats."</p>

  <p>He relapsed again into silence, and so did I. The confounded fellow seemed
  to have an answer for everything. And then just ahead of us we saw the
  deserted car.</p>

  <p>A constable was standing beside it, and a group of four or five children
  were looking on curiously. It stood some three or four feet from the left-
  hand side of the road, so that there was only just room for another car to
  pass. And the road itself at this point ran through a small wood&mdash;barely
  more than a copse.</p>

  <p>"You've moved nothing. Constable?" said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Just as I found it. Sergeant."</p>

  <p>We crowded round the car and looked inside. It was an ordinary open
  touring model, and it was obvious at once that there were signs which
  indicated a struggle. The rug, for instance, instead of being folded, was
  half over the front seat and half in the back of the car. A lady's
  handkerchief, crumpled up, was lying just behind the steering-wheel, and one
  of the covers which was fastened to the upholstery by means of press studs,
  was partially wrenched off. It was the cover for of the side doors, and
  underneath it was a pocket for maps and papers.</p>

  <p>"This is your car, sir?" asked the sergeant formally.</p>

  <p>"It is," said Drummond, and once more we fell silent.</p>

  <p>There was something sinister about that deserted car. One felt an insane
  longing that the rug could speak, that a thrush singing in the drowsy heat on
  a tree close by could tell us what had happened. Its head, of course, was
  pointed away from Pangbourne, and suddenly Drummond gave an exclamation. He
  was looking at the road some fifteen yards in front of the bonnet.</p>

  <p>At first I noticed nothing, though my sight is as good as most men's. And
  it wasn't until I got close to the place that I could see what had attracted
  his attention. Covered with dust was a pool of black lubricating
  oil&mdash;and covered so well that only the sharpest eye would have detected
  it.</p>

  <p>"That accounts for one thing, anyway," said Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>"What is that, sir?" remarked the sergeant, with considerable respect in
  his voice. I was evidently not the only one who had been impressed with the
  keenness of Drummond's sight.</p>

  <p>"I know my wife's driving better than anybody else," he answered, "and,
  under normal circumstances, if she pulled up, she would instinctively get
  into the side of the road. So the first question I asked myself was why she
  had stopped with the car where it is. She was either following another car
  which pulled up in front of her, or she came round the corner and found it
  stationary in the middle of the road, not leaving her room to pass. And the
  owners of the car that did not leave her room to pass wanted to conceal the
  fact that they had been here, if possible. So, finding they had leaked oil,
  they tried to cover it up. God! if only the Bentley could talk."</p>

  <p>It was over in a moment&mdash;that sudden, natural spasm of feeling, and
  he was the same cool, imperturbable man again. And I felt my admiration for
  him growing. Criminal gangs or no criminal gangs, it's a damnable thing to
  stand on the spot where an hour or two earlier your wife has been the victim
  of some dastardly outrage, and feel utterly impotent to do anything.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it's possible to track that car?" said Darrell. We walked
  along the road for a considerable distance, but it was soon obvious that the
  idea was impossible. Far too much traffic had been along previously, and
  since there had been no rain the chance of following some distinctive tyre
  marking had gone. "Hopeless," said Drummond heavily. "Absolutely hopeless.
  Hullo! one of those kids has found something."</p>

  <p>They were running towards us in a body led by a little boy who was waving
  some object in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Found this, governor, in the grass beside the road," he piped out.</p>

  <p>"My God!" said Drummond, staring at it with dilated eyes.</p>

  <p>For "this" was a large spanner, and one end was stained a dull red.
  Moreover, the red was still damp, and when he touched it, it came off on his
  finger. Blood. And the question which rose in all of our minds, and the
  question which none of us dared to answer was&mdash;Whose? I say, none of us
  dared to answer it out loud. I think we all of us had answered it to
  ourselves.</p>

  <p>"You don't recognize the spanner, I suppose, sir?" said the sergeant. "Is
  it one from your car or not?"</p>

  <p>"I do recognize it," answered Drummond. "It's the regular set spanner I
  keep in the pocket with the maps and papers and not in the toolbox, because
  it fits the nut of the petrol tank."</p>

  <p>"The pocket that was wrenched open," I put in, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Show us just where you found it, nipper," said the sergeant, and we all
  trooped back to the Bentley.</p>

  <p>"Here, sir," said the urchin. "Behind that there stone." He was pointing
  to a place just about level with the bonnet, and it required no keenness of
  vision such as had been necessary to spot the dust-covered pool of oil to see
  the next clue. From the stone where the spanner had been found to a point in
  the grass opposite where the other car must have stood, there stretched a
  continuous trail of ominous red spots. Some were big, and some were small,
  but the line was unbroken. Blood once again&mdash;and once again the same
  unspoken question.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the sergeant gravely, "it's obvious that there has been
  foul play. I think the best thing I can do is to get back to the station and
  phone Scotland Yard. We want a lookout kept all over the country for a
  motorcar containing a wounded lady."</p>

  <p>Drummond gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure of that, sergeant," he remarked. "It was only my wife
  who knew where that spanner was kept. I should be more inclined, if I were
  you, to keep a lookout for a motor containing a wounded man. Though I tell
  you candidly if this thing is what I think it is&mdash;or, rather, what I
  know it is&mdash;you're wasting your time."</p>

  <p>And not another word would he say.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; IN WHICH I GET IT IN THE NECK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was hopeless, of course, as I think we all realized from
  the beginning. But it was impossible to sit still and do nothing. And for the
  rest of that afternoon, until long past the time for dinner, we scoured the
  country. Drummond drove the Bentley alone&mdash;he was in no mood for
  talking&mdash;and I went with Darrell.</p>

  <p>It was in the course of that wearisome and fruitless search that I began
  to understand things a little more clearly. My companion amplified Mary
  Tracey's vague remarks, until I began to ask myself if I was dreaming. That
  this affair was the work of no ordinary person was obvious, but for a long
  time I believed that he must be exaggerating. Some of the things he told me
  sounded too incredible.</p>

  <p>They concerned a man called Carl Peterson, who, it appeared, had been the
  head of the gang our hostess had alluded to. This man was none other than
  Wilmot, of airship fame. I, naturally, remembered the name
  perfectly&mdash;just as I remembered the destruction of his airship,
  mercifully after all the passengers had disembarked. Wilmot himself was
  killed&mdash;burned to death, as were the rest of the crew.</p>

  <p>And here was Darrell, in the most calm and matter-of-fact way, stating
  something completely different.</p>

  <p>"I was one of the passengers that night," he said. "I know.
  Wilmot&mdash;or, rather Peterson, as we prefer to call him&mdash;was not
  burned to death. He was killed by Drummond."</p>

  <p>"Killed!" I gasped. "Good God! what for?"</p>

  <p>Darrell smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"It was long overdue," he answered. "But that was the first opportunity
  there had been of actually doing it."</p>

  <p>"And this woman knows that he killed him?" I said.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;and yes," he said. "She was not there at the time, but four days
  later she met Drummond by the wreckage of the airship. And she told him the
  exact hour when Peterson had died. I don't know how to account for it. Some
  form of telepathy, I suppose. She also told him that they would meet again.
  And this is the beginning of the meeting."</p>

  <p>"So that verse was sent by her, was it?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But it seems rather an extraordinary thing to do," I persisted. "Why go
  out of your way to warn a person?"</p>

  <p>"She is rather an extraordinary woman," he answered. "She is also a most
  terribly dangerous one. Like all women who have a kink, they are more extreme
  than men. And I don't mind telling you, Dixon, that I'm positively sick with
  anxiety over this show. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth&mdash;you
  know the old tag? I'm afraid it's going to be a life for a life."</p>

  <p>"You mean they may kill Mrs Drummond?" I cried in horror.</p>

  <p>"Just that and nothing more," he said gravely. "Drummond killed her lover:
  she will kill his wife. She would have no more scruples over so doing than
  you would have over treading on a wasp. The only thing is&mdash;does it suit
  her book? Is she going to try and get Drummond into her power by using his
  wife as a lever? And only time will tell us that."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a woman is she?" I said curiously.</p>

  <p>"To look at she is tall, dark, and very <i>soigne</i>. She's handsome
  rather than pretty, and I should think has some Southern blood in her." He
  smiled slightly. "But don't run away with the impression that she'd be likely
  to look like that if you met her. Far more probably would she be a wizened-up
  crone covered with spectacles, or a portly dame with creaking corsets. So
  much for her appearance. Her character is a thing to stand aghast at. She has
  the criminal instinct developed to its highest degree: she is absolutely
  without mercy: she is singularly able. How much, of course, was her and how
  much Carl Peterson in the old days is a thing I don't know. But even if it
  was him principally, to start with, she must have profited considerably by
  seeing him at work. And a final point which is just as important if not more
  so than those I've already given, she must be a very wealthy woman.
  Peterson's life was not a wasted one as far as other people's money was
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"It sounds a tough proposition," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"It is," he agreed gravely. "A damned tough proposition. In fact, Dixon,
  there is only one ray of sunshine that I can see in the whole business. To do
  them both justice, in the past they have never been crude in their methods.
  In their own peculiar way they had a sense of art. If that sense of art is
  stronger now with her than her primitive desire for revenge, there's
  hope."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow," I said.</p>

  <p>"She will play the fish&mdash;the fish being us. To kill Mrs Drummond
  offhand would be crude."</p>

  <p>"I fail to see much comfort," I remarked, "in being played if the result
  is going to be the same. It's only prolonging the agony."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he said quietly, "but is the result going to be the same?"</p>

  <p>A peculiar smile flickered for a moment round his lip.</p>

  <p>"You probably think I'm talking rot," he went on. "At least, that I'm
  exaggerating grossly."</p>

  <p>"Well," I admitted, "it's all a little hard to follow."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. You've never struck any of these people before. We have. We
  met them quite by accident at first, and since then we've almost become old
  friends. We know their ways: they know ours. Sometimes we've fought with the
  police on our side: sometimes we've fought a lone hand. And up to date on
  balance we have won hands down. That is why I cannot help feeling&mdash;at
  any rate hoping&mdash;that this woman would not regard the slate as being
  dean if she merely killed Mrs Drummond. It has been our wits against theirs
  up till now. She wants much fuller revenge than such a crude action as that
  would afford her."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you feel optimistic over the prospect," I murmured. "<i>Chacun
   son got</i>."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he went on thoughtfully, "I may be wrong. If so&mdash;it's
  hopeless from the start. They've got Drummond's wife: if they want to they
  can kill her right away. But somehow or other&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off, staring at the road ahead. The light was of that half-and-
  half description when headlamps are useless and driving is most
  difficult.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I'm afraid this is a pretty hopeless quest," I said. "We don't
  even know what sort of a car we are looking for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He touched the accelerator with his foot.</p>

  <p>"What's that dark thing there beside the road?" he said. "It's a car right
  enough, and you never can tell."</p>

  <p>We drew up beside it, and the first thing I noticed was a pool of
  lubricating oil in the road, under the back axle. Only a coincidence, of
  course, I reflected, but I felt a sudden tingle of excitement. Could it
  possibly be the car we were looking for?</p>

  <p>We got out and walked up to it. The car was empty&mdash;the blinds of the
  back windows drawn down. "We'd better be careful," I said a little nervously,
  "the owner may be in the field."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, he may not," said Darrell coolly, and opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>It was an ordinary standard limousine, and at first sight there seemed
  nothing out of the normal to be seen. There was no sign of disorder, as there
  had been in the Bentley: the rug on the seat was carefully folded. And it was
  almost mechanically that I opened one of the back doors, to stand nearly
  frozen with horror at what I saw. The covering of the front bucket seat
  beside the driver's was saturated with blood from the top right down to the
  floorboards.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I muttered, "look here."</p>

  <p>Darrell came and looked over my shoulder, and I heard him catch his breath
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"This evidently," he remarked, "is the car we are after. There's a torch
  in the pocket of the Sunbeam: get it, like a good fellow."</p>

  <p>By its light we examined the stain more closely. The average width was
  about six inches, though it narrowed off towards the bottom. But one very
  peculiar point about it was that near the top were a number of strange loops
  and smears, stretching away out of the main stream. They were the sort of
  smears that a child might make who had dipped its fingers in the blood, and
  had then started to draw patterns.</p>

  <p>"The person who sat in this seat must have bled like a pig," said Darrell
  gravely. "From a wound in the head obviously."</p>

  <p>Whose head? Who was it who had sat in the seat? Once again the same
  ghastly question, unasked and unanswered, save in our own minds. But I
  remember that to me all his hopes and ideas about crudeness and art suddenly
  became rather pitiful. To me there seemed no doubt who it was who had sat in
  that seat. And I felt thankful that Drummond wasn't there with us.</p>

  <p>One could picture the poor girl sitting there, probably unconscious, with
  the blood welling out from some terrible wound in her head, while the devil
  beside her drove remorselessly on. A hideous thought, but what alternative
  was there?</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Dixon?"</p>

  <p>Darrell's voice cut into my thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's pretty obvious," I said. "And I'm afraid it rather
  disposes of your hopes as to crudity and art. This is the crudest and most
  brutal attack on a woman, that's all."</p>

  <p>"You think so?" he said thoughtfully, "And yet it's all a little difficult
  to understand. Why did they stop here? What has become of them?"</p>

  <p>"It's a road without much traffic," I answered. "Probably they changed
  into another car to put people still more off the scent. Don't forget that if
  they had garaged this car anywhere for the night they would have had some
  pretty awkward questions to answer."</p>

  <p>"That's true," he agreed. "And yet it presupposes that the thing had been
  arranged beforehand."</p>

  <p>"It probably was," I pointed out. "They were anyway going to change cars,
  and the fact that the poor girl was so terribly wounded did not make them
  alter their plans."</p>

  <p>"But why mess up two cars?" he argued. "That's what I can't get at."</p>

  <p>He once more switched the torch on to the stained cover.</p>

  <p>"You know," he said, "those loops and smears puzzle me. What on earth can
  have caused them? What possible agency can have made that stream of blood
  divert itself like that? Hold the torch a moment, will you? I'm going to copy
  them into a notebook."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," I remarked, "what on earth is the use? Do it if you
  like, but I should say that the best thing we can do is to make tracks for
  the nearest police station and give them the number of this car. We want to
  find the owner."</p>

  <p>"It won't take a moment," he said, "and then we'll push off.
  There&mdash;is that about right?"</p>

  <p>He handed me his rough sketch: a copy of it is before me, as I write.</p>

  <p>[The book here includes a picture of a scrawled message]</p>

  <p>"Yes," I remarked, "that's pretty well how it looks. But I'm afraid it's
  not going to help us much."</p>

  <p>"You never can tell," he answered. "Those marks didn't come there
  accidentally&mdash;that I swear. It's a message of sorts: I'm certain of
  it."</p>

  <p>"It may be a message, but it's absolute gibberish," I retorted. "Now don't
  you think we'd better push on to a police station. I've got the number of
  this car&mdash;ZW 3214."</p>

  <p>He looked at me thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Can you drive my Sunbeam?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I blush to admit it," I answered, "but I'm one of those extraordinary
  people who have never driven a car in my life."</p>

  <p>"That's a pity," he remarked. "Because I was going to propose that I
  stopped here while you went. I think one of us ought to remain in case
  anything happens."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I said, "hasn't enough happened already? However, I don't mind
  staying. Only get a move on: I'm beginning to feel like dinner."</p>

  <p>"Stout fellow," he cried. "I'll be as quick as I possibly can."</p>

  <p>He got into his car, and in half a minute was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Now as I have already explained I am not one of those fortunate
  individuals to whom battle, murder, and sudden death come as the zest of
  life. And honesty compels me to admit that at no period of my career have I
  more bitterly regretted not having had lessons in driving. Moreover, I am
  essentially a town man: the country always seems to me to be so full of
  strange noises. Especially at night&mdash;and it was dark by now.</p>

  <p>I lit a cigarette&mdash;quite unaware of the horror with which Drummond
  would have viewed such a proceeding. To see and not be seen, to hear and not
  be heard, was a dictum of his I was to learn later.</p>

  <p>All sorts of weird whispering sounds came to my ears as I stood there
  beside the car. And once I gave a terrific start as a shrill scream came from
  the field close by.</p>

  <p>"An animal," I reflected angrily. "A. rabbit caught by a stoat. Don't be
  such a fool."</p>

  <p>I began pacing up and down the middle of the road, conscious of an absurd
  desire for someone to speak to, even if it was only an inebriated farm
  labourer. And then by way of forcing discipline on my mind, I made myself go
  over the whole amazing business from the beginning.</p>

  <p>What was the letter that had made Mrs Drummond leave the house? Where did
  the two men at the Cat and Custard Pot come in? Why had this car stopped here
  and what had happened after? And finally those strange smears. Were they
  indeed some message, and if so who had written it? Was it that poor girl
  trying to write some final communication as she felt her life slipping away
  from her?</p>

  <p>My thoughts turned to Drummond, and I felt most bitterly sorry for my
  earlier sarcasm. Still, there had been some excuse: I defy any ordinary
  person to have viewed his behaviour without feeling some doubts as to his
  sanity. The fact remained, however, that I owed him the most abject apology.
  Not that my apology would be much use to the poor devil in exchange for his
  wife.</p>

  <p>I ground my cigarette out with my heel, and stared down the road. Surely
  it was about time for Darrell to get back. And as I stood there leaning
  against the bonnet, a bird got up with a sharp cry from a point in the hedge
  some hundred yards away. It was the cry of sudden alarm from which a poacher
  might have read much, but I read nothing.</p>

  <p>And then a twig cracked: I heard it distinctly and stiffened.
  Another&mdash;and yet another, whilst I stood there motionless peering into
  the darkness. Did my eyes deceive me, or was there something dark moving
  cautiously along the grass beside the road, in the shadow of the hedge? I
  recalled times in France when strange things took shape in No-Man's-Land:
  when men became as bushes and bushes as men. And putting my hand to my
  forehead I found it was wet with sweat.</p>

  <p>I listened again: all was silent. The stealthy mover, if there was a
  mover, was moving no more. My imagination probably, and with a shaking hand I
  extracted my cigarette case. Damn it! what was there to be frightened at?</p>

  <p>"Lawks sakes&mdash;look at this 'ere!"</p>

  <p>The voice came from the hedge not ten yards away, and in my fright I
  dropped my case in the road. Then with an effort I pulled myself together: to
  be frightened at my time of life by a mere yokel was not good for one's
  pride.</p>

  <p>"Look 'e 'ere, mister."</p>

  <p>"Where are you?" I said. "I can't see you."</p>

  <p>The fellow gave a cackling laugh which made me think he was not quite
  right in his head. And then came another remark which caused me to start
  forward in horror.</p>

  <p>"A dead 'un."</p>

  <p>"Where?" I cried, moving towards him slowly. My mouth felt suddenly dry.
  It required all my will power to force myself to go. I knew what I was going
  to see: I knew that there in the darkness just ahead of me I would find some
  half-witted yokel staring inquisitively at the body of the unfortunate girl.
  There would be a terrible wound in her head, and at each step I took my
  reluctance increased. I loathed the thought of having definite proof: up to
  date there had been a doubt, however shadowy.</p>

  <p>"Where?" I said thickly, once again, and then I saw him just in front. His
  back was towards me, and he was bending over something that lay in the ditch
  close to the hedge. He was chuckling to himself in an idiotic way, and I
  heard a voice croak at him: "Shut up!" It was my own.</p>

  <p>I reached his side, and bent over, too. And for a moment or two I stood
  there staring, hardly able to believe my eyes. True, a body was there, lying
  in that peculiar twisted position which tells its own tale. True, there was a
  terrible wound in the head, dearly visible even in the darkness. But it was
  not a woman; it was a man. And the feeling of relief was stupendous.</p>

  <p>I turned to the yokel foolishly: turned and froze into immobility. The
  idiotic chuckling had ceased, and the face that was thrust near mine wore a
  sarcastic smile.</p>

  <p>"Too easy," he remarked.</p>

  <p>A pair of hands fastened on my throat, and I began to struggle
  desperately. Dimly I realized that it was a trap: that the man had been
  acting a part so as to draw me into an advantageous position in which to
  attack me. And then all other thoughts were blotted out by the appalling
  knowledge that as far as strength went I was a child in his hands. There was
  a roaring in my ears, a ghastly tightness in my throat. And I remember that
  my last coherent thought before I became unconscious was that if Drummond had
  been in my place the result would have been very different.</p>

  <p>It was fitting, therefore, that the first man I should see when I opened
  my eyes was Drummond himself. For a moment or two I couldn't remember what
  had happened, and I stared foolishly around. I was lying on the grass beside
  the road, and my head and coat were sopping wet. Drummond with Darrell and
  another man were standing close to me in the light of the headlamps of a
  car.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" I said feebly.</p>

  <p>They swung round.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! little man," said Drummond. "You gave us a nasty shock. What fun
  and laughter have you been engaged in?"</p>

  <p>"Where's the dead man?" I cried, sitting up.</p>

  <p>They all stared at me.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Drummond slowly. "A dead man, you say?"</p>

  <p>I struggled to my feet, and stood swaying dizzily.</p>

  <p>"Steady, old man," said Drummond. "Easy does it."</p>

  <p>"There was a dead man," I repeated, and then I stared round. "Where's the
  other car?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," agreed Drummond. "Where is it? It wasn't here when we
  arrived."</p>

  <p>"Not here," I repeated stupidly, "I don't understand. What's
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"That's easily told," said Drummond. "By mere chance I ran into Peter at
  the police station, and when I heard what you'd found I came along with him
  and this officer. We must have gone half a mile beyond here before he knew
  we'd gone too far. So we turned and came back. And the pool of oil told us
  where the car had been. Peter knew you couldn't drive, so we thought you must
  have been abducted in the car. And then quite by chance the officer found you
  in the ditch. You looked like a goner at first, but we sluiced you with cold
  water, and you'll be as fit as a trivet in a minute or two. When you do let's
  hear what happened to you."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right now," I said. "A bit dizzy, that's all. Let me sit down in
  the car for a little."</p>

  <p>It was quite true. My head was quite clear, and, except for a most
  infernally stiff neck, I felt none the worse for my experience. And I told
  them exactly what had taken place. They listened in silence, and it was only
  when I hesitated a little over saying who it was I had expected to find in
  the ditch that Drummond spoke.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said curtly. "Go on."</p>

  <p>I finished my story, and then he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"If any confirmation is needed," he remarked, "the ditch should supply it.
  Where was the body lying?"</p>

  <p>I got out of the car and led them to the spot. As he had said, the ditch
  did supply it. A great pool of blood showed up red and sinister in the light
  of Darrell's torch, but of the body of the man whose blood it was there was
  no trace.</p>

  <p>"So what happened," said Drummond thoughtfully, "is fairly easy to spot.
  But the reason for it is a little more obscure. The gentleman who caressed
  your windpipe had evidently been sent back to retrieve car and corpse.
  Finding you here he gave you the necessary medicine. Then he removed corpse
  in car. But if that was the great idea, why were car and corpse left here in
  the first place?"</p>

  <p>"Would you recognize the man who attacked you, sir?" said the police
  officer, speaking for the first time.</p>

  <p>"I think I'd recognise him," I said, "but I couldn't give you a
  description of him that would be the slightest help."</p>

  <p>"Well, there doesn't seem much use our standing here any more," remarked
  Drummond at length, and his voice was weary. "We know the number of the car,
  so the owner can be traced. But I shall be very much surprised if we find
  that helps us much."</p>

  <p>He sighed, and lit a cigarette. "Come on, Peter, we'd better be getting
  back. My stomach is flapping against my backbone for want of food, and we
  can't do any more good here."</p>

  <p>And I, for one, agreed with him fervently.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; IN WHICH WE GET THE SEMBLANCE OF A CLUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Looking back on it now after the lapse of time, I find it
  hard to recall my exact state of mind that night. I remember that amongst
  certain members of the house party I found myself in the position of a
  popular hero. To have been assaulted and left for dead conferred an air of
  distinction on me which I found rather grateful and comforting. The tacit
  assumption seemed to be that only abnormal strength of constitution on my
  part had saved my life.</p>

  <p>I also remember experiencing a distinct feeling of pique that amongst
  other members of the party my adventure seemed to cut no ice at all. They
  appeared to regard it as the most ordinary thing in the world. Two new
  arrivals had come&mdash;the two whom Longworth had been told to summon under
  the names of Ted and Toby. Their surnames were respectively Jerningham and
  Sinclair, and Tracey had managed to squeeze them into the house. And it was
  in describing the events of the afternoon and evening to these two that the
  point of view of this second section of the party became obvious. Not, I
  mean, that I wished it to be exaggerated in any way: at the same time I admit
  that I felt, when all was said and done, that whilst Drummond and Darrel had
  been in perfect safety at a police-station, I had had a murderous assault
  made on my life. And to have it described by Darrell as getting a clip over
  the earhole struck me as somewhat inadequate. The replies of the audience
  also left, I thought, a certain amount to be desired.</p>

  <p>Jerningham said: "Pity you didn't ladle the bloke one back."</p>

  <p>Sinclair said: "Splendid! So we know one of them by sight, anyway."</p>

  <p>Then they all dismissed the matter as trifling, and resumed the
  interminable discussion. Not that I minded, you understand&mdash;but it
  struck me that it showed a slight lack of a proper sense of proportion.</p>

  <p>However, I waived the matter: it was not my wife who had been forcibly
  dragged from her car in broad daylight. Had it been I should have been insane
  with worry. And that was the extraordinary thing about Drummond. Outwardly he
  seemed the most self-possessed of us all, and only the strained look in his
  eyes showed the mental condition he was in.</p>

  <p>Bill Tracey was absolutely beside himself. That such a thing should have
  happened in his house made him almost incoherent. And it was characteristic
  of Drummond that, in spite of his own agonising suspense, he should have gone
  out of his way to ease things for Bill.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said more than once, "please don't blame yourself.
  The fact that it happened to take place here is nothing whatever to do with
  you. They waited till they were ready and then they struck. That they
  happened to become ready when we were staying with you is just pure
  chance."</p>

  <p>Which, though perfectly true, did but little to alleviate his feelings of
  responsibility. It was his house, and the bald fact remained that one of his
  guests, and a woman at that, had been decoyed away from it and been made the
  victim of foul play. And apart from his natural grief at such a thing
  happening, the prospect of the notoriety involved concerned him, of course,
  more than any of us save Drummond himself. It was Jerningham who summarized
  the situation after a while.</p>

  <p>"Let's just see," he said, "that we've got this thing clear. Whilst
  playing tennis this afternoon Phyllis got a note delivered by hand of such
  importance that she stops playing and goes out alone in the Bentley. At that
  time Hugh was having a bit of back chat with the two foreign-looking
  blokes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who have not been traced at the railway station," put in Tracey.</p>

  <p>"Who have since disappeared," went on Jerningham. "But it is generally
  agreed that they had something to do with it, though what we don't know.
  Shortly after, the Bentley is found deserted, showing every sign of having
  been the scene of a struggle."</p>

  <p>"She dotted him one, Ted," said Drummond with certainty. "She dotted him
  good and hard with that spanner. In fact she killed him&mdash;glory be to
  Allah!"</p>

  <p>They pondered this point in silence for a while.</p>

  <p>"It stands to reason, old boy," went on Drummond, "that the man Dixon saw
  lying in the ditch is the same man whose trail we followed on the grass
  beside the Bentley."</p>

  <p>"Very well then," said Jerningham, "make it so. She dotted him one.
  Finding herself suddenly attacked she out with the spanner and slogged him
  good and hard. So then the other bloke&mdash;there must have been at least
  one more&mdash;bunged Phyllis into the back of the other car, stuffed his pal
  into the seat beside him, and pushed off."</p>

  <p>"It don't sound right to me, Ted," said Drummond slowly.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" demanded Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"All the last part. If you were driving a motorcar in broad daylight, and
  had to take with you a fellow who was bleeding like a pig from a wound in the
  head, would you put him on the seat beside you? Especially if you did not
  want to draw attention to yourself."</p>

  <p>He took a long gulp of beer.</p>

  <p>"Not so, old lad: you'd bung him on the floor at the back. And from
  Peter's description of the blood in the car that's what happened. If he'd
  been sitting in the seat beside the driver, the front of it would have been
  stained, too. It wasn't&mdash;only the back."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it matters much, anyway," I remarked. "Back or front the
  result is the same. Perhaps Mrs Drummond was beside the driver."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Drummond, sitting up and staring at me. "I hadn't
  thought of that. Perhaps she was."</p>

  <p>"What's stung you?" said Darrell, surprised, and we all looked at him
  curiously. He seemed strangely excited.</p>

  <p>"Supposing Phyllis was sitting in that seat," he remarked. "Supposing the
  man was bleeding to death behind. Supposing she managed to get her hand over
  the back of the seat, with the idea of getting some message through by
  dipping her finger in the blood and writing on the cover."</p>

  <p>His excitement infected us all though, for the life of me, I couldn't see
  what he was getting at.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;get on with it," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see that the writing would be upside down?" cried Drummond.
  "Where's your notebook, Peter? Turn the page the other way round."</p>

  <p>We crowded over his shoulder and stared at the rough sketch.</p>

  <p>"It is," shouted Drummond. "Smeared letters, or I'll eat my hat. There's a
  K there: two K's. And L: and E. What's that first word? Something KE... LUKE
  is it?</p>

  <p>"Like," I hazarded. "That first letter might be L."</p>

  <p>"Then it's LIKE LAK," said Drummond, and we stared at one another a little
  blankly. If that was the solution it didn't seem to advance us much. Like
  Lak. It was meaningless. Probably not realizing that it was useless the
  message had continued into the stream of blood where it had been obliterated.
  But that was no help.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," said Drummond quietly, "it proves one thing. She wasn't
  unconscious."</p>

  <p>He got up and went to the open window, where he stood with his back to us,
  staring out into the darkness. His shoulders were a little bowed: his hands
  were in his pockets. And, by Jove! I felt for the poor chap. Somewhere out
  under those same stars&mdash;perhaps twenty miles away, perhaps a
  hundred&mdash;his wife was in the hands of this infamous gang. Up-to-date,
  action had kept him going, even if it had only consisted of futile motoring
  up and down roads. Now the time of forced inaction had come. There was
  nothing to distract his thoughts, nothing to take his mind off the ghastly
  possibilities of the situation.</p>

  <p>There was no use sympathizing with him: the matter had passed beyond
  words. Besides, it struck me that he was of the brand that is apt to shy away
  from sympathy like a frightened colt. And so we sat on in silence, hardly
  daring to meet one another's eyes, with the same fear clutching at all our
  hearts. It didn't seem to matter very much whether or not Mrs Drummond had
  been conscious in the car. Was she conscious now? Was she even alive? It
  seemed too incredible to be sitting there in that peaceful room contemplating
  such an appalling thought. And yet what was there to be done? That was the
  maddening part of it. Literally the only clue in our possession was the
  number of the car&mdash;ZW 3214. It was true that I might recognize the man
  who had nearly throttled me, but even on that point I felt doubtful. And that
  wasn't going to be much use unless I saw him again.</p>

  <p>The same applied to the two men at the Cat and Custard Pot. Both Drummond
  and I would recognize them again&mdash;but where were they? And even if they
  were found they would probably prove to be only very minor characters in the
  caste. The telephone on Tracey's desk rang suddenly, sounding unnaturally
  loud in the silence, and we looked at it almost apprehensively. Was it some
  further complication, or was it news?</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Tracey, picking up the receiver. "Yes&mdash;speaking."</p>

  <p>Drummond had swung round, his hands still in his pockets. And he stood
  there, his face expressionless, while the metallic voice from the machine,
  punctuated by occasional grunts from our host, droned on. At last Tracey
  replaced the receiver, and shook his head gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I'm afraid," he said. "It was the police. They've traced the
  car, and it belongs to a man called Allbright in Reading. He's a retired
  grocer, and absolutely above suspicion. He is away from home at the moment,
  and the car must have been coolly stolen from his garage this morning. He has
  a deaf housekeeper, who is also above suspicion, and who was in complete
  ignorance that the car had gone until visited by the police this
  evening."</p>

  <p>Once more silence fell on the room, and Drummond, with the faintest
  perceptible shrug of his shoulders, again turned his back on us and stared
  into the darkness. Our only positive clue gone&mdash;or at any rate
  valueless, the outlook blacker, if possible, than before. The butler brought
  in a tray of drinks and Tracey waved his hand at it mechanically.</p>

  <p>"Help yourselves," he remarked, but nobody moved.</p>

  <p>And then at last Drummond spoke. His back was still towards us: his voice
  was perfectly quiet. "This situation is too impossible to continue," he said.
  "Something is bound to happen soon."</p>

  <p>And as if in answer to his remark the telephone bell jangled a second
  time.</p>

  <p>"I told you so," he said calmly. "This is news."</p>

  <p>Tracey had again taken the receiver: and again we watched him with a kind
  of feverish anxiety. Was Drummond right? Or was it some further futile
  communication from the police?</p>

  <p>"A lady wishes to speak to you, Drummond," said Tracey, and the tension
  suddenly became acute. "She won't give her name."</p>

  <p>Drummond went to the instrument, and we waited breathlessly. And if there
  is a more maddening proceeding during a time of suspense than having to
  listen to one end of a telephone conversation I have yet to experience it. We
  heard the metallic voice of the other speaker; we saw Drummond give an
  uncontrollable start, and then freeze into absolute immobility.</p>

  <p>"So it is you," he said in a low voice. "Where is Phyllis?"</p>

  <p>Again that metallic voice, and then quite clearly a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Damn you," said Drummond, still in the same quiet tone. "What have you
  done with her?"</p>

  <p>This time the voice went on for nearly a minute, and all we could do was
  to watch the changing expressions on his face and try to imagine what was
  causing them. Anger, bewilderment, and finally blank surprise were all
  registered, and it was the latter which remained when the voice ceased.</p>

  <p>"But look here!" he cried. "Are you there? Damn it&mdash;she's gone!"</p>

  <p>He rang the bell furiously for the Exchange.</p>

  <p>"Where did that last call come from?" he asked. "London. Can you possible
  get me the number?"</p>

  <p>We waited eagerly, only to see him lay down the receiver wearily.</p>

  <p>"The public callbox at Piccadilly Circus," he said.</p>

  <p>"It was Irma?" almost shouted Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it was."</p>

  <p>He stood there frowning, and we waited eagerly.</p>

  <p>"It was that she-cat right enough. I'd know her voice anywhere. And she's
  got some dirty game up her sleeve."</p>

  <p>"What did she say?" asked someone.</p>

  <p>"She first of all said that she was charmed to renew her acquaintance with
  Phyllis, and that it seemed quite like old times. She went on to say that so
  far she had only been able to have a very brief chat with her, but that she
  hoped for many more in the near future. She was sure I would like to know
  that she was unhurt, but how long that condition of affairs lasted depended
  on me entirely. That I should have a letter from her in the morning making
  things quite clear, and that all she could advise me to do for the present
  was to have a good night in. Then she rang off."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that's something," said Darrell. "We know she's unhurt."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I don't think she would lie," agreed Drummond. "But what's she
  getting at? How can it depend on me?"</p>

  <p>"That seems fairly obvious," said Jerningham gravely. "You're going to be
  put through it, old man, and if you don't play nicely Phyllis is going to
  suffer. There's no good not facing facts, and she's got you by the short
  hairs."</p>

  <p>Drummond sat down heavily.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," he said slowly. "I'll do anything&mdash;
  anything. I wanted to ask her tonight if she would take me instead of
  Phyllis, but she'd rung off."</p>

  <p>Darrell laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think the answer would have been very satisfactory even if she
  hadn't," he said. "You're not a very comfortable person to have about the
  house, old boy."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" said Drummond tersely.</p>

  <p>Then he stood up, and the expression on his face made me feel profoundly
  thankful that I was never likely to come up against him.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take one of your boats, Tracey," he remarked. "Don't wait up
  for me: I shan't go to bed tonight."</p>

  <p>The next moment he had vanished through the open window.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil," said Bill. "I'm sorry for him. But I don't see that there's
  anything to be done."</p>

  <p>"There isn't," said Darrell. "We can only wait for this letter tomorrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>He helped himself to a whiskey and soda, and I followed his example. That
  was all we could do&mdash;wait for the letter. But it was impossible to
  prevent oneself speculating on the contents. What test was Drummond going to
  be put to? Was he going to be told to commit some crime? Some robbery
  possibly with his wife's safety depending on his success? What a ghastly
  predicament to be in! To have to run the risk of a long term of imprisonment,
  or else to know that he was putting his wife in danger. And even if he ran
  the risk how could he be sure that the others would stick to their side of
  the bargain? Avowedly they were criminals of the worst type, so what reliance
  could possible be put on their word?</p>

  <p>The others had gone off to the billiard room, leaving Tracey and me alone.
  And suddenly the utter incredibility of the whole situation came over me in a
  wave. Not twelve hours ago had I been sitting peacefully in my club,
  earnestly discussing with the secretary whether the new brandy was as good as
  the last lot. He had said yes: I had disagreed. And it had seemed a very
  important matter.</p>

  <p>I laughed: and he looked up at me quickly. "I don't see anything very
  humorous in the situation," he remarked.</p>

  <p>I laughed again. "No more do I, Bill, not really. But it had just occurred
  to me that if I was suddenly transported to the smoking-room of the club, and
  I told the occupants that since I last saw them a lady had been kidnapped
  from your house, I had found a dead man in a ditch, and finally had been
  nearly murdered for my pains&mdash;they might not believe me."</p>

  <p>He grunted. "You're right," he said. "They might not. At times I hardly
  believe it myself. Damn this accursed woman Irma&mdash;or whatever she calls
  herself!" He mixed himself a drink savagely. "We're going to have hordes of
  newspaper men round the place, poking their confounded noses into everything.
  And, being Whitsuntide, they'll probably run special steamers to view the
  scene of the crime. I tell you, Joe, I wouldn't have had it happen for
  worlds. Of course I'm very sorry for Drummond&mdash;but I wish it had taken
  place somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," I agreed. "At the same time. Bill, don't forget that
  everything that happened did take place somewhere else. The dead man I found
  was twelve miles from here&mdash;and he has since disappeared. The car has
  disappeared, too. In fact there's nothing to connect the matter with this
  house."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he said. "Nothing to connect it with this house! What
  about Mrs. Drummond? Wasn't she staying here?"</p>

  <p>"She was&mdash;undoubtedly. But hasn't it occurred to you&mdash;mind you,
  I only put it forward as a possibility&mdash;that Drummond may be compelled
  by the gang who have got her to keep the fact of her disappearance
  quiet?"</p>

  <p>"But the police know it already," he cried.</p>

  <p>"They know she went out in a car, and that the car was found empty. That
  does not necessarily mean that she has disappeared. We know she has, but
  that's a very different matter. And if, as I surmise, Drummond is going to be
  ordered to commit a crime as the price for his wife's life&mdash;or at any
  rate safety&mdash;the first essential is that he should keep the police out
  of it as much as possible."</p>

  <p>"Commit a crime!" He stared at me for a moment or two and then put down
  his glass on the table. "You really think that that is going to be the next
  move?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know any more than you do," I said. "The whole thing is so
  absolutely amazing that no ordinary rules seem to apply. If they had murdered
  the poor girl outright as an act of revenge it would at any rate have been
  understandable. But this new development can only mean that they are going to
  put pressure on him through his wife."</p>

  <p>"Well, I must frankly admit," he said at length, "that the less that is
  known about this affair the better I shall be pleased. At the same time I'd
  hate to know that Drummond was running round the country robbing churches or
  something of that sort."</p>

  <p>He paused, struck by a sudden thought.</p>

  <p>"It might be a case, not of blackmail exactly, but of ransom. On the
  payment of a sum of money she will be returned."</p>

  <p>"Is he a wealthy man?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite well off. Do you think that's the solution, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"My dear old man," I cried, "ask me another. I don't think I've ever been
  so hopelessly at sea in my life. I shall put a cold compress round my neck,
  and go to bed. Presumably all our questions will be answered tomorrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>And to bed I went&mdash;but not to sleep. Try as I would I could not stop
  thinking about the affair. That last idea of Bill Tracey's had a good deal to
  be said for it. And what would happen if Drummond wouldn't pay&mdash;or
  couldn't? People of the type we were up against were not likely to ask a
  small sum.</p>

  <p>Would they go on keeping her a prisoner until he had scraped together the
  money? Or would they murder her? I shuddered at the thought: this was
  England, not a bandit-infested desert. They would never dare to run such an
  appalling risk. They might threaten, of course, but at that it would stop.
  And then as if to mock me I saw once again that evil face with its cynical
  smile, heard that voice: "Too easy," felt those vicelike hands on my throat.
  Would they stop at that?</p>

  <p>At last I could bear it no longer. I got up and lit a cigarette: then I
  went and sat down by the open window. A very faint breeze was stirring in the
  trees: from the other end of the lawn came the mournful cry of an owl. And
  somewhere out there in the darkness was that poor devil Drummond, on the rack
  with anxiety and worry.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the moon came out from behind a cloud, throwing fantastic shadows
  across the lawn&mdash;the clear-cut black and white shadows of the night. And
  after a while I began to imagine things, to see movement where there was no
  movement, to hear noises when there was no noise. Every board that creaked in
  the house seemed like the footsteps of a man, and once I started violently as
  a bat flitted past close to. In fact I came quite definitely to the
  conclusion that during the hours of darkness Piccadilly was good enough for
  me. With which profound reflection I got back into bed, and promptly fell
  asleep. But what the footman thought, I don't know. Because when a motor car
  with blood spouting from the radiator is on the point of knocking you down,
  and you see that it isn't really a radiator, but the face of a man with a
  cynical smile who continually says "Too easy," it is only natural that you
  should push that face. I did&mdash;and it was the footman's stomach. The only
  comfort was that he had already put down the tea.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; IN WHICH THE LETTER ARRIVES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And now I come to the beginning proper of the amazing
  adventure which was to occupy us for the next few days. The happenings of the
  preceding day were only the necessary preliminaries without which the
  adventure could not have started.</p>

  <p>As I have said, the two alternatives which I had in my mind as I went
  downstairs the next morning could be summed up in the two words&mdash;ransom
  or crime. And it was with a queer feeling of excitement that I saw Drummond
  standing in the hall holding a bulky letter in his hand. THE letter.</p>

  <p>"How's the neck?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"So so," I said. "You've heard from that woman?"</p>

  <p>He nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I have. And I'll be damned if I can make out if I'm mad or if she is. Go
  and hit a sausage, and then we'll have a council of war."</p>

  <p>I went into the dining-room, to find that the rest of his pals had nearly
  finished. None of the women were down yet, so conversation was non-existent.
  And ten minutes later we all duly assembled in Tracey's study.</p>

  <p>"I've read this letter twice," said Drummond, coming straight to the
  point, "and as I said to Dixon I don't know whether I'm mad or she is. He
  looked a bit fine-drawn, I thought, but much less worried than he had done
  the previous night.</p>

  <p>"I should think the best thing to do is for me to read it aloud to you,"
  he went on. "The postmark on the envelope is of no assistance. It was posted
  in London, and that doesn't help. Somewhat naturally also there is no
  address."</p>

  <p>He spread out the sheets and began.</p>

  <p>'MON AMI,</p>

  <p>'In case you have forgotten, I wish to recall to your memory the
  circumstances of our last meeting. A little more than six months ago you may
  remember we met beside the wreckage of the airship. And I told you then that
  I knew you had killed Carl. It matters not how I knew: some things are
  incapable of ordinary explanation. But if it is of any interest to you, I
  did, as a matter of fact, make further inquiries from people who had been on
  that last voyage. And from them I learned that I was right, and that you did
  kill him.</p>

  <p>'Six months ago, Drummond, and during those six months you have never been
  out of my thoughts for long. There was no hurry, and during a winter spent in
  Egypt I have been indulging in the luxury of anticipation. They say it is
  better than realization: the next few days should decide that point as far as
  this particular case is concerned. There was another reason also which
  necessitated a little delay. Various arrangements had to be made in
  England&mdash;arrangements which took time. These have now been made, and I
  trust that in the near future you will find them satisfactory.</p>

  <p>'However, I go too fast. The first thing I had to decide was what method I
  should adopt for punishing you adequately. My revenge, if I was to enjoy it
  to the full, had to be carefully thought out. I wanted nothing crude;' (I
  caught Darrell's eye at that moment) 'I wanted something artistic. And above
  all I wanted something long drawn out.</p>

  <p>'And so your brilliant intellect will at once perceive that no mere death
  coming suddenly out of the blue could fit into my ideas. You smile, perhaps:
  you recall that in the past you were frequently threatened with death and
  that you are very much alive today. Agreed, mon ami; but do not forget the
  little verse I sent you. Doubtless you have inspected the message contained
  in it, and it is up to me to prove that that message is no empty boast.</p>

  <p>'For example, it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have
  killed your dear Phyllis yesterday afternoon. And her positively murderous
  assault on one of my most trusted assistants really made me very angry for a
  while. The poor man is quite dead.</p>

  <p>'In parenthesis, mon cher, who on earth is the funny little man you left
  to guard the car when you found it? From the description I've heard he's a
  new one on me.'</p>

  <p>"Damn the woman!" I spluttered, and even Drummond grinned suddenly. Then
  he went on.</p>

  <p>'To return, however. It would have been very easy to have killed her, but
  so far from doing so the dear girl is sitting with me as I write. Not only
  easy&mdash;but just. We should have been all square. But I want more
  satisfaction than that, Drummond, much more. And so I will come down to my
  little scheme.</p>

  <p>'In the past your physical strength has always excited my warmest
  admiration. But I have never been quite so certain about your mental ability.
  Luck, I think, has entered a good deal into the matter, and though I should
  be the last person to belittle luck, yet it is apt to affect the issue
  somewhat unfairly.</p>

  <p>'And so on this occasion I propose to test your brain. Not unduly, I
  trust, but enough to afford me a certain amount of amusement. Do not be
  alarmed&mdash;your physical strength will be tested also. If you emerge
  triumphant your dear Phyllis will be restored to your bosom. If on the other
  hand you fail, then I shall claim my pound of flesh. In other words, what
  might have so easily been done yesterday afternoon will merely have been
  postponed.</p>

  <p>'The test is expressed simply by two words: Find Phyllis. You raise your
  eyebrows: that, you say, is somewhat naturally the test. But wait, mon ami,
  and I will explain a little further. You have doubtless heard of hidden
  treasure hunts: perhaps joined in one yourself. This is going to be run on
  the same rules. You will receive clues which you will interpret to the best
  of your ability. These clues will lead you to various places where further
  clues will await you. They will also lead you to various places where you may
  or may not enjoy yourself. Things will happen which you may or may not like.
  In fact, my dear Drummond, to put the matter in a nutshell, you may or may
  not pull through. As I said, I have made my arrangements with some care.</p>

  <p>One further word. This little matter is between you and me. I have no
  objection to your roping in your friends&mdash;in fact, the more the merrier.
  But I don't want the police butting in. You could not avoid it yesterday
  afternoon, I know, so you are forgiven for that. But get them out of it
  now&mdash;quickly. Another thing, too. I don't want Uncle Percival or
  whatever he calls himself asking absurd questions from any of the
  Broadcasting centres. If that should happen our little game would cease
  abruptly. So bear those two points in mind: no police, no broadcasting. And
  that, I think, is all. You will get your first clue today.'</p>

  <p>Drummond laid down the letter, and lit a cigarette. "What do you think of
  it?" he said.</p>

  <p>"The thing is a fantastic leg pull," cried Tracey.</p>

  <p>But Drummond shook his head doubtfully. "I wonder," he said. "What do you
  think, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"That she means every word of it, old boy," answered Darrell, positively.
  "That's no leg pull: it's damned grim earnest."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear," said Jerningham. "We're for the trail again."</p>

  <p>"You mean to tell me," spluttered Tracey, "that this woman has hidden your
  wife, and now expects you to go chasing round the country till you find her!
  Dash it&mdash;it's absurd."</p>

  <p>"Absurd or not absurd," said Drummond gravely, "that is exactly what this
  woman has done. And from what I know of her it's going to be some chase." He
  got up, and suddenly, to my amazement, an almost ecstatic grin spread over
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Gosh! boys," he said, "if it wasn't that it was Phyllis, what a glorious
  time we should have. Why did we never think of it before with Carl? We might
  have had two or three games in our spare time."</p>

  <p>Then he became serious again.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Tracey," he said: "and you, too, Dixon, may I rely on you not
  to say a word of this even to the ladies? The fewer people who know about it
  the better. If this came to the ears of a newspaper man we'd have the whole
  of Fleet Street on our heels. So&mdash;not a word to a soul."</p>

  <p>"A police sergeant to see you, sir."</p>

  <p>The butler was holding the door open.</p>

  <p>"Mind," said Drummond urgently, "not a word."</p>

  <p>The officer who had gone with us to the deserted Bentley the previous
  afternoon entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Good morning. Sergeant," said Drummond quietly. "Found Mr Allbright's car
  yet?"</p>

  <p>The policeman shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, sir," he said. "May I ask if you have any news of your
  wife?"</p>

  <p>Drummond frowned suddenly: then he gave a short laugh. "Yes&mdash;I have.
  Look here. Sergeant&mdash;you're a man of discretion."</p>

  <p>I looked at him covertly: what tale was he going to tell?</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the officer, with a slightly gratified smile, "they
  don't make you a sergeant for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Drummond. "Well&mdash;the fact of the matter is this. My
  wife has run away&mdash;bolted. With another man." He lit a cigarette with a
  sort of savage resignation. "I didn't say so yesterday, but I feared even
  then that that note that was brought her was from the swine who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly&mdash;words had failed him&mdash;and strode to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Hugh," said Sinclair sadly. "It's a devilish business. That
  dirty little sweep of all people, too."</p>

  <p>Drummond invoked the Deity twice, while the sergeant stared at him
  blankly.</p>

  <p>"But look here, sir," he said, "what about all that blood?"</p>

  <p>"That, Sergeant," remarked Drummond, "is the staggering part of the whole
  business. When my wife rang me up last night to tell me that she
  had&mdash;she had left me, she said 'I suppose you've found the Bentley by
  now.' I said to her, 'But what about the blood on the grass?' She said 'What
  on earth are you talking about? If it's a riddle I haven't got time to buy it
  now.' Then she rang off. She knew nothing about it, sergeant&mdash;absolutely
  nothing."</p>

  <p>The officer's face was blanker than before.</p>

  <p>"Since then," went on Drummond, "we've been trying to reconstruct what
  happened. And the only possible conclusion we can come to is this. The car
  belonging to Mr Allbright was stolen by two or three men. Driving along the
  road they came on the deserted Bentley. Well, if they'd steal one car, they'd
  steal another. So they decided to steal that too. And then they fell
  out&mdash;why. Heaven alone knows. Probably one of them was already at the
  wheel of the Bentley&mdash;and there was a struggle in which somebody got hit
  over the head with the spanner. Much harder than was intended. They all
  became frightened, and bundled the wounded man into the closed car. Of
  course," he continued modestly, "it's only crude amateur deduction: there are
  doubtless many objections to our theory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Many," agreed Darrell, staring out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Which your trained brain will spot," went on Drummond. "But the great
  point as far as we are concerned is this. As far as I am concerned, I should
  say. The whole thing is merely an amazing coincidence. The blood we saw on
  the road, the blood in Mr Allbright's car, has nothing to do with my wife's
  disappearance. And since I still have hopes that she will realize the error
  of her way and come back to me, the last thing I want is to run any risk of
  hardening her heart by worrying her with police inquiries."</p>

  <p>"You know my views, Hugh," said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"And I damned well don't want to hear them again," snapped Drummond.</p>

  <p>"A lounge lizard like that!" cried Jerningham scornfully. "How you can
  dream of forgiving her I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Lounge lizard, gentlemen?" said the bewildered policeman.</p>

  <p>"That's right, sergeant," Jerningham pointed an outraged finger at space.
  "A lounge lizard. A ballroom snake. What matter that his Black Bottom is the
  best in London."</p>

  <p>"My Gawd! sir," gasped the other. "His 'ow much?"</p>

  <p>"What matter, I say?" swept on Jerningham. "Is that a thing which should
  commend itself to reasonable decent men?"</p>

  <p>"I should 'ardly say so myself, sir," agreed the sergeant fervently.</p>

  <p>Jerningham paused to recover his breath.</p>

  <p>"What is the gent's name, sir," said the sergeant, producing his pencil
  and notebook.</p>

  <p>"Albert. Albert Prodnut," said Jerningham, and Drummond sat down
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"And his address?"</p>

  <p>"I wish we knew," answered Jerningham. "If we did, doubtless by this time
  Captain Drummond would have removed his liver with a rusty penknife. I speak
  metaphorically."</p>

  <p>"So you don't know where he is, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere on the Continent," said Drummond in a hollow voice.</p>

  <p>"And your wife, too?"</p>

  <p>Drummond groaned and hid his face in his hands, while Jerningham rose and
  took the sergeant by the arm.</p>

  <p>"No more now, sergeant," he whispered confidentially. "He is strung up to
  breaking point. In a week or two, perhaps. Or a month. And in the meantime
  you will treat what we have told you as absolutely confidential, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He propelled him gently towards the door.</p>

  <p>"It's all very strange, sir," he said in a worried voice.</p>

  <p>"If you knew Albert Prodnut you'd think it was a damned sight stranger,"
  said Jerningham feelingly. "One of those strange cases of mental aberration.
  Sergeant&mdash;almost I might say of psycho-sclerosis&mdash;which baffle the
  cleverest doctor. Leave him to us now."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind the harassed officer, and Jerningham held up his
  two thumbs.</p>

  <p>"Prodnut," said Drummond weakly. "Why Prodnut?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? It's very difficult to think of a name when you're suddenly
  asked for one. There is a ring of sincerity about Albert Prodnut that carries
  entire conviction."</p>

  <p>"Look here, you fellows," said Tracey seriously, "this is getting beyond a
  joke. You can't expect any man out of a lunatic asylum to believe that absurd
  rigmarole."</p>

  <p>"We had to say something," remarked Drummond. "Personally I think we told
  the tale rather well."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but what about me?" said Tracey. "It's a tissue of lies from
  beginning to end."</p>

  <p>"We can't tell the truth," answered Drummond gravely. "Look here, Tracey.
  I'm very sorry about this, and I quite appreciate the difficulties of your
  position. In the bottom of your mind you probably think that that woman's
  letter is a bluff. I know it isn't. We've got to keep the police out of this
  if we possibly can. And I really couldn't think of anything better on the
  spur of the moment."</p>

  <p>"You still mean," said Tracey amazed, "to take that woman at her word! To
  go hunting about all over England on clues she sends you which will probably
  lead you nowhere nearer your wife than you are at present!"</p>

  <p>"What else can I do?" cried Drummond. "She's in the position of being able
  to dictate terms."</p>

  <p>Once again the door opened and Parker came in, this time with a telegram
  on a salver. "For you, sir," he said, handing it to Drummond.</p>

  <p>He tore open the yellow envelope, and as he read the message a look of
  complete bewilderment spread over his face. "Well, I'm damned!" he muttered.
  "No answer, thank you, Parker. Listen here, you fellows," he went on as the
  butler left the room, "what in the name of fortune do you make of this?</p>

  <p>"My first a horse may draw or even two the rest is found at York and aids
  the view and when you've solved that bit by dint of trying an inn you'll find
  where fishermen are lying"</p>

  <p>"It's the first clue," said Jerningham excitedly. "She said you'd get it
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"But it's hopeless," cried Drummond in despair. "The simplest crossword
  reduces me to a jibbering wreck. If I've got to try and solve these damned
  things I'm done before I start."</p>

  <p>"There are half a dozen perfectly good people to help you, old boy," said
  Darrell. "Sling the paper over. Let's put it down as it's meant to
  be&mdash;in the form of a verse."</p>

  <p>He scribbled the words on a piece of paper while we leaned over his
  shoulder. And even Tracey seemed impressed by this sudden new
  development.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said Darrell, "does that make it any better?"</p>

  <p style="text-indent:0; margin-left:25%"><i>My first a horse may draw, or
  even two;</i><br>
  <i>The rest is found at York, and aids the view.</i><br>
  <i>And when you've solved that bit by dint of trying,</i><br>
  <i>An inn you'll find where fishermen are lying.</i></p>

  <p>"If line three is right," I said, "the first two are a complete clue in
  themselves."</p>

  <p>"That's so," agreed Tracey. "But what sort of a clue? Is it the name of a
  man or a town or what?"</p>

  <p>"Let's assume it's a town to start with," said Jerningham. "There's an inn
  mentioned in the last line."</p>

  <p>"What's found at York?" demanded Drummond gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Ham, dear old boy," burbled Algy Longworth.</p>

  <p>"And Archbishops," said Sinclair hopefully.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that it can be truthfully maintained," said Tracey mildly,
  "that either ham or Archbishops aid the view."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a bit," remarked Darrell. "Let's start at the beginning. 'My
  first a horse may draw, or even two.' Presumably that means two horses. So
  it's a horse-drawn vehicle suitable for one or two horses."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! Peter, you're a bunking marvel," cried Drummond. "Cart, cab,
  wagon."</p>

  <p>"You don't have a two-horse cab," objected Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"Wagon sounds possible," said Darrell. "There must be places beginning
  with Wagon. Got a map Tracey?"</p>

  <p>"Here's the Times Gazetteer," he answered. "By Jove! Wagonmound."</p>

  <p>"Got it!" shouted Drummond. "There's bound to be a mound at York."</p>

  <p>But Tracey was shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I spoke too soon. The darned place is in New Mexico. And that's
  the only place beginning with Wagon that's mentioned."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" said Drummond, and relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>"What about Dray," I remarked. "You speak of a one-horse dray and a two-
  horse dray."</p>

  <p>"Stout fellow," cried Drummond. "Look up Dray, Tracey."</p>

  <p>"There are about forty Draytons," he said. "Lots of Draycotts:
  Drayminster, Drayney."</p>

  <p>"Drayminster!" I yelled. "Minster, York Minster."</p>

  <p>"I believe you've got it," said Darrell. "It fits at any rate as far as
  the first two lines are concerned."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! you fellows," cried Jerningham. "Listen here. This is the AA
  handbook. Drayminster. Population 2231, Sussex. 55 miles to London. Now brace
  yourselves for it. Hotel&mdash;the Angler's Rest. We have got it."</p>

  <p>For a while we all stared at one another too excited to speak. Was there a
  mistake? Fishermen lying; Anglers' Rest. No one could say that York Minster
  was not an aid to the view: a dray could certainly be drawn by one or two
  horses. It fitted, every clue fitted.</p>

  <p>"Get packed, boys," cried Drummond. "We lunch at the Angler's Rest. Gosh!
  I feel better. We've started. Beer, Tracey old lad, pints of beer! And you
  and Dixon shall wish us good hunting."</p>

  <p>The beer arrived, and then Drummond raised his hand as for some solemn
  rite. Slowly he waved it to and fro, and once more did the words of his
  favourite refrain burst forth with vigour:</p>

  <p>"The more we are together&mdash;together&mdash;together: the more we are
  together the merrier we shall be."</p>

  <p>"A new music-hall song?" I inquired politely.</p>

  <p>And all they did was to roar with laughter.</p>

  <p>"When we start hunting, boys," he said, "that shall be the war-cry. Don't
  forget&mdash;once for the rally, twice for danger."</p>

  <p>I suppose it was foolish of me, but I really couldn't help it. There was
  something contagious about the spirits of this extraordinary gang which must
  have infected me.</p>

  <p>"I must learn the tune," I said. "For if you'll allow me I should very
  much like to join you in whatever is coming."</p>

  <p>They all stared at me, then, a little doubtfully, at one another.</p>

  <p>"Of course," I said stiffly, "if you'd prefer I didn't."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," interrupted Drummond. "Look here, Dixon, if you're going
  to come in on this thing you'd better be under no delusions. You got a taste
  last night of the sort of people we're going to be up against. And believe
  you me that's nothing to what we shall strike. I want you to understand quite
  clearly that if you do join us you'll be taking your life in your hands at
  most hours of the day and night. I mean it&mdash;quite literally. It's not
  going to be a question of merely solving little puzzles."</p>

  <p>"I'll chance it," I answered. "As a matter of fact I dislike most strongly
  the implication behind the phrase funny little man."</p>

  <p>Once more the whole lot burst out laughing. "Right," said Drummond. "That
  settles it. But don't say you weren't warned if you get your ear bitten
  badly."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI. &mdash; IN WHICH I GET THE SECOND CLUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The village of Drayminster is one of the beauty spots of
  England. Somewhat out of the beaten track, it is as yet unspoiled by motor
  coaches and hordes of trippers. The river Dray meanders on its peaceful way
  parallel to the main street, and in the very centre of the village stands the
  Angler's Rest. A strip of grass separates it from the water's edge, and
  moored to two stakes a punt stretches out into the stream from the end of
  which the energetic may fish for the wily roach and perch. A
  backwater&mdash;but what a pleasant backwater.</p>

  <p>"Your lady friend," I said to Drummond, "has undoubtedly an artistic eye."
  We were sitting on the lawn after lunch, and he grunted thoughtfully. The
  others had departed on a tour of exploration, and save for the motionless
  figure of the landlord's son at the end of the punt, we were alone.</p>

  <p>"If only I could be absolutely certain that we were right," he remarked.
  "That we aren't wasting our time sitting here."</p>

  <p>"Unless the whole thing is a stupid hoax," I said reassuringly, "I'm
  certain our solution was correct."</p>

  <p>It was the inaction that chafed him, I could see. I think he had expected
  to find another clue waiting for us on our arrival. But there had been
  nothing, and gradually his mood A of elation had left him. He had kept his
  eyes fixed so searchingly on an elderly parson and his daughter during lunch
  that the poor man had become quite hot and bothered. In fact, it wasn't until
  our host had assured him that the reverend gentleman had come to the hotel
  regularly for the last twenty years that he desisted.</p>

  <p>"It's not a hoax," he said doggedly. "So why the devil, if we're right,
  haven't we heard something more?"</p>

  <p>"Quite possibly that's all part of the game," I answered. "They may know
  that that is a method of rattling you."</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he cried, "I hadn't thought of that."</p>

  <p>He looked quite relieved at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing we might do," I went on. "It may not be any good, but
  it can't do any harm. Let's find out if there are any houses in the
  neighbourhood that have recently changed hands. If they are hiding your wife
  a house is the most likely place to do it in."</p>

  <p>"Dixon," he said, "you're the bright boy all right. My brain at the moment
  is refusing to function altogether. Hi! John&mdash;or whatever your name
  is&mdash;cease tormenting fish and come here a moment."</p>

  <p>Obediently the boy put down his rod and approached.</p>

  <p>"Now, you know all the big houses in the neighbourhood, don't you?"</p>

  <p>The boy nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"That's right, mister. There be the Old Manor&mdash;that be Squire
  Foley's. And there be Park House. That do belong to Sir James&mdash;but he be
  away now."</p>

  <p>"Has there been any house sold round about here recently," I put in.</p>

  <p>The boy scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"There be Widow Maybury's," he said. "She did sell her little cottage, and
  be gone to live with her darter near Lewes."</p>

  <p>"Who bought it," I cried.</p>

  <p>"They do say he be a writer from Lunnon, or sommat fulish like that. He
  just comes occasional like."</p>

  <p>"Is he here now," asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Ay," said the boy. "He come last night. There was a young leddy with
  him."</p>

  <p>I caught Drummond's eye, and it was blazing with excitement.</p>

  <p>"They come in a motor car," went on the boy.</p>

  <p>"Where is the cottage?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"End o' village," he replied. "'Lily Cottage,' it do be called."</p>

  <p>Drummond had already risen to his feet, and the boy looked at him
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"He be a terrible funny-tempered gentleman," he said. "He set about Luke
  Gurney with a stick, he did&mdash;two or three weeks ago. Had to pay Luke
  five pounds, he did, or old Gaffer Gurney would have had him up afore the
  beak."</p>

  <p>"My lad," said Drummond, "there is half a crown. You may now resume your
  occupation of catching fish."</p>

  <p>He turned to me. "Are you coming," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said a little doubtfully, "we'd better be careful, hadn't we?
  This fellow may be a perfectly harmless individual."</p>

  <p>"In which case we will withdraw gracefully," he cried. "Damn it, man, I
  believe we're on the scent. Why&mdash;Good God! Phyllis may be actually there
  now."</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;I'll come," I said. "Only&mdash;cautious does it." But
  for the moment Drummond was beyond caution. The thought that possibly his
  wife was within half a mile of him had sent him completely crazy, and it was
  only with the greatest difficulty that I restrained him from bursting
  straight into the house when we got there. "You can't, my dear fellow," I
  cried. "We must have some sort of excuse."</p>

  <p>It was a small cottage standing back a little from the road. A tiny patch
  of garden in front was bright with flowers, and two pigeons regarded us
  thoughtfully from a dovecot. "We'll ask if it's for sale," he said, and then
  suddenly he gripped my arm like a vice.</p>

  <p>"Look up at the top left-hand window," he muttered. I did so, and got a
  momentary glimpse of the saturnine, furious face of a man glaring at us. Then
  like a flash it was gone.</p>

  <p>"Dixon," he said hoarsely, "we've done it. She's in there. And I'm going
  through that house with a fine comb."</p>

  <p>A little dubiously I followed him up the path. Nothing that I could have
  done would have stopped him, but even before he knocked on the door I had a
  shrewd suspicion that he was making a blazing error. It seemed impossible
  that, after all the chat and bother there had been, the solution should prove
  so simple. And a blazing error it proved. The door was flung open and the man
  we had seen peering at us through the window appeared. And to put it mildly
  he was not amused.</p>

  <p>"What the&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Laddie," interrupted Drummond firmly, "something tells me that you and I
  will never be friends. Nevertheless I am going to honour your charming
  cottage with a call."</p>

  <p>He extended a vast hand and the other man disappeared into the hat-
  rack&mdash;an unstable structure. Drummond disappeared upstairs. And the
  scene that followed beggared description. The hat-rack, in falling, had
  pinned the owner underneath. Moreover, as far as I could see, one of the
  metal pegs was running straight into the small of his back. Then came a
  shrill feminine scream from above, and Drummond appeared at the top of the
  stairs looking pensive. He was still looking pensive when he joined me.</p>

  <p>"I fear," he murmured, "that someone has blundered."</p>

  <p>A rending crash from behind announced that the hat-rack was still in the
  picture, and we faded rapidly down the street.</p>

  <p>"A complete stranger," he remarked. "With very little on. Most
  embarrassing."</p>

  <p>I began to shake helplessly.</p>

  <p>"But I maintain," he went on, "that no man has a right to possess a face
  like that. It's enough to make anyone suspicious."</p>

  <p>A howl of rage from behind us announced that the battle of the hat-rack
  was over.</p>

  <p>"Pretend," said Drummond, "that I'm not all there."</p>

  <p>"Hi, you, sir," came a shout, and we paused.</p>

  <p>"You are addressing me, sir?" remarked Drummond majestically as the other
  approached.</p>

  <p>"You scoundrel," he spluttered. "How dare you force your way into my
  house?"</p>

  <p>"My Prime Minister will raise the point at the next meeting of
  Parliament," said Drummond. "Do you ever hit yourself hard on the head with a
  heavy spanner? Hard and often. You must try it. It's so wonderful when you
  stop. The audience is terminated."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel, and strode off down the street, whilst I touched my
  head significantly.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said the other. "Is he mad?"</p>

  <p>"Touched," I murmured. "Result of shell shock. He'll probably be quite all
  right in an hour or two when he'll have completely forgotten the whole
  incident."</p>

  <p>"But the cursed fellow ought to be locked up," he cried angrily.</p>

  <p>"His relatives don't want it to come to that if it can be avoided," I
  said. "I much regret the incident, sir&mdash;but..."</p>

  <p>"Bring me a mushroom omelette without..." Drummond had suddenly returned,
  and was staring fixedly at his late victim.</p>

  <p>"Without?" stammered the other nervously. "Without what?"</p>

  <p>"Without mushrooms, you fool. Damn it&mdash;the man's not right in his
  head. What else could it be without? Come, fellow, I would fain sleep."</p>

  <p>He seized me by the arm, and stalked off in the direction of the Angler's
  Rest, leaving the other standing speechless in the road.</p>

  <p>"Did we put it across him?" he said when we were out of hearing.</p>

  <p>"More or less," I answered. "He said you ought to be locked up."</p>

  <p>"I really don't blame him," he conceded. "She was a pretty girl, too," he
  continued irrelevantly as we arrived at the hotel. "Very pretty."</p>

  <p>Darrell and Jerningham were both on the lawn, but the others had evidently
  not yet returned.</p>

  <p>"Any luck?" they asked as we pulled up a couple of chairs.</p>

  <p>"Damn all," said Drummond moodily. "I pushed a bloke's face into a hat-
  rack, and contemplated a charming lady with very little on, but we never got
  the trace of a clue. What's worrying me, chaps, is whether we ought to sit
  still and wait, or run round in small circles and look."</p>

  <p>"After your recent entertainment," I remarked mildly, "I should suggest
  the former. At any rate for a time."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," he agreed resignedly. "All I hope is that it won't
  be for long."</p>

  <p>"But you don't imagine, do you, old boy," remarked Jerningham, "that
  Phyllis is likely to be round about here? Because I don't."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Drummond blankly.</p>

  <p>"This is but the beginning of the chase. And I don't think Mademoiselle
  Irma would have run the risk of bringing her to the place where all of us
  would certainly be, granted we solved the first clue. All we're going to get
  here is the second clue."</p>

  <p>"And probably have a darned sticky time getting it," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his legs and closed his eyes, and after a while I
  followed his example. The afternoon was drowsy, and if we were going to have
  a sticky time, sleep seemed as good a preparation for it as anything. And it
  seemed only a moment afterwards that a hand was laid on my shoulder, and I
  sat up with a start.</p>

  <p>The shadows had lengthened, and at first I saw no one. The landlord's son
  had ceased to fish: the chairs that the others had occupied were empty.</p>

  <p>"You will, I am sure, excuse me," came a pleasant voice from over my
  shoulder, "but your snores are a little disconcerting to the sensitive
  ear."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," I said stiffly as I rose. "Falling asleep when
  sitting up is always dangerous."</p>

  <p>He regarded me affably&mdash;a pleasant-faced little white-haired man.</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," he said. "I do to others as I would they should do to
  me. And I feared you might collect a crowd, who would misconstrue the reason
  of the uproar in view of the proximity of the Angler's Rest."</p>

  <p>He sat down in the seat recently occupied by Drummond.</p>

  <p>"You are staying long?" he inquired pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"That largely depends," I answered.</p>

  <p>"A charming village," he remarked. "A bit of old-world England, the like
  of which I regret to say is becoming all too rare. They tell me it was
  fifth&mdash;or was it sixth&mdash;in the competition for the most beautiful
  village."</p>

  <p>He frowned. "How annoying. Was it fifth or sixth?"</p>

  <p>"Does it," I murmured, "make very much difference?"</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he stared at me fixedly.</p>

  <p>"It might," he said gravely, "make a lot."</p>

  <p>Then he looked away, and I felt a sudden pricking feeling of excitement.
  Was he implying something? Was there a hidden meaning in his apparently
  harmless remark? Was he one of those people who really are worried by failing
  to remember some small, insignificant detail such as that&mdash;or was it the
  beginning of a new clue?</p>

  <p>"Only, I should imagine, to the lucky inhabitants," I said lightly. "For
  my own part I am content with it whatever place it occupied in the list of
  honour."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Perhaps so. It is certainly very lovely. And the inn is most
  comfortable. I always feel that in such a setting as this the old-time
  English beverage of ale tastes doubly good&mdash;a point of view which was
  shared, I think, by a very large individual who was sitting in this chair
  half an hour or so ago."</p>

  <p>"I know the man you mean," I answered. "He is a very capacious beer
  drinker."</p>

  <p>"He crooned some incantation which seemed to assist his digestion," he
  went on with an amused smile. "You are all one party, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact we are," I said politely, restraining a desire to ask
  what business it was of his. If there was anything to be got&mdash;I'd get
  it. "We are here," I added on the spur of the moment, "on a quest."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," he murmured. "How interesting! And how mysterious! Would it be
  indiscreet to inquire the nature of the quest?"</p>

  <p>"That I fear is a secret," I remarked. "But it concerns principally the
  large individual of whom you spoke."</p>

  <p>"My curiosity is aroused," he said. "It sounds as if a lady should be at
  the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"A lady is at the bottom of it," I answered.</p>

  <p>He shook his head with a whimsical smile.</p>

  <p>"What it is to be young! I, alas! can only say with the poet 'Sole-sitting
  by the shores of old romance.'" Once again did he give me a peculiar direct
  stare before looking away.</p>

  <p>"At the moment," I remarked, "the quotation eludes me."</p>

  <p>"It may perhaps return in time," he smiled. "And prove of assistance."</p>

  <p>"In what possible way can it prove of assistance?" I said quickly.</p>

  <p>"It is always an assistance to the mind when a forgotten tag is recalled,"
  he remarked easily.</p>

  <p>I said nothing: was I imagining things, or was I not? He seemed such a
  harmless old buffer, and yet...</p>

  <p>"As one grows older," he went on after a while, "one turns more and more
  to the solace of books. And yet what in reality are words worth? <i>'Si
  jeunesse savait: si vieillesse pouvait</i>.' The doctrine of life in a
  nutshell, my friend."</p>

  <p>Still I said nothing: why I know not, but the conviction was growing on me
  that there was a message underlying his remarks.</p>

  <p>"Words may be worth a lot," I said at length, "if one fully understands
  their meaning."</p>

  <p>For the third time he gave me a quick, penetrating stare.</p>

  <p>"To do that it is necessary to use one's brain," he murmured. "You will
  join me in a little gin and vermouth?"</p>

  <p>"Delighted," I said perfunctorily. Then&mdash;"May I ask you a perfectly
  straight question, sir?"</p>

  <p>He returned to his seat from ringing the bell.</p>

  <p>"But certainly," he said. "Whether I give you a perfectly straight answer,
  however, is a different matter."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," I agreed. "Do you know why we are here or do you not?"</p>

  <p>"You have already told me that you are in quest of a lady."</p>

  <p>He raised his glass to his lips.</p>

  <p>"<i>Votre sante, m'sieur</i>&mdash;and also to the success of your search.
  If any stray words of mine have assisted you I shall be doubly rewarded for
  having roused you from your slumbers."</p>

  <p>He replaced his glass on the table.</p>

  <p>"Exquisite, is it not&mdash;the gold and black of the colour scheme? But
  alas! the air grows a little chilly <i>pour la vieillesse</i>. You will
  pardon me, I trust&mdash;if I leave you. And once again&mdash;good
  hunting."</p>

  <p>He went indoors and I sat on, thinking. More and more strongly was the
  conviction growing on me that the second due lay in our conversation: less
  and less, could I see a ray of light. Was it contained in that quotation:
  'Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance?' He had said it might prove of
  assistance&mdash;and then had passed off his remark.</p>

  <p>Who had written it, anyway? It came back to me as a dimly remembered tag,
  but as to the author my mind was a blank. Had the well-known old French
  proverb any bearing on the case?</p>

  <p>His voice from a window above me cut into my reverie.</p>

  <p>"I feel sure that you are tormenting yourself over the author of my little
  quotation," he chuckled. "It has suddenly occurred to me that his name was
  actually mentioned in our conversation."</p>

  <p>The window closed, leaving me staring blankly at it. Mentioned in our
  conversation! No author's name had been mentioned: to that I could swear. And
  yet would he have said so if it was not the case? It seemed stupid and
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Once more I ran over it, trying to recall it word by word. It was
  maddening to think that I was now possibly in actual possession of the
  information we wanted, and yet that I couldn't get it.</p>

  <p>I ordered another gin and vermouth: perhaps, after all, I had been
  mistaken. An old gentleman in all probability with an impish delight in the
  mysterious who was deliberately playing a little joke on me. And then the
  window above me opened again.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, my friend. I am sorry to say that I have to leave this charming
  spot. And I trust for all your sakes that your brain will prove equal to my
  little problem."</p>

  <p>I got up quickly: surely that remark clinched the matter. He was one of
  the others, and I'd make him tell me more. A Ford was standing by the door,
  and a minute or two later I saw him getting into it. "Look here, sir," I
  said, "I must insist on your being more explicit. You do know why we are
  here; you have been giving me the second clue."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You have told me why you are here," he answered. "And as for the second
  clue, the phrase sounds most exciting. And as for me I have a train to catch.
  To the station, driver."</p>

  <p>The car started, leaving me standing there blankly. And then he put his
  head out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Good hunting."</p>

  <p>I suppose Drummond would have pulled him out of the car by the scruff of
  the neck: I wasn't Drummond. I watched the car disappear up the road, then I
  went back to my neglected gin and vermouth, swearing under my breath.</p>

  <p>"Who," I said to the landlord who came out at that moment, "is the old
  gentleman who had just driven off?"</p>

  <p>"He entered himself in the book, sir, as Mr Johnson of London. More than
  that I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>Evidently disposed for a chat he rambled on, whilst I pretended to listen.
  And suddenly&mdash;I don't know what the worthy man was talking about at the
  moment&mdash;I fired a question at him.</p>

  <p>"Have you got any books of poetry in the hotel?"</p>

  <p>It must have been a bit disconcerting, for he stared at me as if I had
  taken leave of my senses.</p>

  <p>"I believe the missus has," he said in an offended voice. "I don't hold
  with the stuff myself. I'll ask her."</p>

  <p>He went indoors to return in a few moments with the information that she
  had Longfellow, Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats. I cut short the catalogue with a
  yell, and this time the poor man looked really alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Wordsworth," I said. "Please ask her to lend me Wordsworth."</p>

  <p>He again went indoors, and I sat there marvelling at my denseness. "And
  yet what in reality are words worth?"</p>

  <p>At the time the phrasing had struck me as peculiar, a little pedantic. And
  there it had been sticking out right under my nose. Now there was nothing for
  it but to go clean through until I found the quotation, and then if my
  reasoning was right we should find the clue in the context.</p>

  <p>Mine host handed me the book with an air of hurt dignity, and retired once
  more indoors whilst I started on my lengthy task. In couples the others came
  back looking moody and disconsolate, and disinclined for conversation. They
  took no notice of me, and I, for fear I might raise false hopes, said
  nothing. Plenty of time to talk if I proved right.</p>

  <p>Dinner came, and over the steak and kidney pie, I found it.</p>

  <p><i>'Lady of the Mere, Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.'</i></p>

  <p>I stared at the page blankly. Lady of the Mere. What earthly good was
  that? Had all my time been wasted? Was the old man a harmless jester after
  all?</p>

  <p>"Everything to your satisfaction, gentlemen?" The landlord came up to our
  table, and a I drew a bow at a venture. "Tell me, landlord," I said, "is
  there in this neighbourhood any place called the Mere?"</p>

  <p>He stared at me for a moment or two without speaking. "There is," he
  answered at length, and his jovial expression had vanished. "May I ask why
  you want to know, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Curiosity," I said, hardly able to keep the excitement out of my voice.
  "Is it a pond&mdash;or what?"</p>

  <p>"It's a house," he said. "An old house. About three miles from here."</p>

  <p>"Who is the owner?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Owner!" he gave a short laugh. "There ain't been no owner, sir, for nigh
  on ten years. And there ain't never likely to be."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the place?"</p>

  <p>"I bain't a superstitious man, gentlemen," he said gravely, "but it would
  take more'n a bag of gold to get me across the threshold of the
  Mere&mdash;even by day. And by night, I wouldn't go&mdash;not for all the
  money in the Bank of England."</p>

  <p>"Haunted, is it?" I prompted.</p>

  <p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe not," he answered. "There be grim things, sir, black
  things go on in that house. Ten years ago the owner, old Farmer Jesson, were
  murdered there. A fierce man he was: used to keep the most awful savage dogs.
  And they do say that he found his young wife with a lad&mdash;a powerful-
  tempered boy. And they had a terrible quarrel. The lad, so the story
  goes&mdash;' e struck the old man and killed him after an awful struggle. And
  as he died he cursed the lad and his young wife. He cursed the house: he
  cursed everything he could think of. Certain it is that the lad and the lass
  disappeared: folks do say they died where they stood and then were
  mysteriously removed. As I say, I bain't superstitious, and I don't rightly
  hold with that story. But what I do know is that since then there be strange
  lights and noises that come from the old place&mdash;for I've seen 'em and
  heard 'em myself. And I do know that there come a young gentleman from London
  who heard the tales and didn't believe them. He went there one night, and
  they found him next day on the ground outside, lying on his back and staring
  at the sky&mdash;as mad as a hatter. No, no, gentlemen&mdash;take my advice
  and give the Mere a wide berth, or you'll regret it."</p>

  <p>He bustled off to attend to a new arrival.</p>

  <p>"How fearfully jolly," I remarked.</p>

  <p>The others were staring at me curiously.</p>

  <p>"Why this incursion into local superstition?" asked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"No particular reason," I answered on the spur of the moment. "As I said,
  just idle curiosity."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">VII. &mdash; IN WHICH WE COME TO THE MERE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I really don't know why I didn't tell them at once. Somehow
  or other the whole thing seemed so terribly thin as I ran over it in my mind.
  And told secondhand it would have sounded even thinner. A tag from
  Wordsworth: the coincidence of a name. And that was positively all.</p>

  <p>I felt that something more definite was wanted, and there seemed only one
  way of getting it. I would go there myself and reconnoitre. I admit that I
  didn't like the idea particularly: that bit about the man who was found on
  the ground outside, as mad as a hatter, was so wonderfully reassuring. At the
  same time I'd had three cocktails, and I was now having my second glass of
  port. And the suspicion that this cheery band regarded me as a rabbit
  rankled. Their opinion would change pretty rapidly if I came back with the
  next clue in my pocket.</p>

  <p>After all it was I who had solved the first one and spotted Drayminster,
  and though I might not be their equal in mere physical strength it was brain
  that was needed on a show like this. And in that department I ventured to
  think the boot was on the other leg.</p>

  <p>I ordered another glass of port. Just local superstition, of course: good
  enough for inebriated yokels wandering home at night. They would hear noises
  and see lights anywhere. But for an educated man to be put off by such an
  absurd story was nothing short of ridiculous. I'd borrow a bicycle after
  dinner, and have a look round the place. Only three miles mine host had said:
  I'd be back comfortably by eleven o'clock. And if I'd found nothing I would
  not mention my conversation of before dinner.</p>

  <p>The others had drifted away from the table, and were sitting in the lounge
  outside as I went through. They seemed bored and depressed, and with
  difficulty I repressed a smile as I thought of the change that would occur
  when I came back with the goods. I should have to solve it for them too in
  all probability: in fact it had been a very fortunate moment for them when I
  had decided to help them.</p>

  <p>The first thing to do was to get hold of a bicycle, and in that I was
  successful at once. The landlord's son would be only too pleased to lend me
  his, and after a few minutes it was brought round to the front door.</p>

  <p>"Be you going far, mister," he said, "because there bain't too much oil in
  the lamp."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the Mere," I answered as casually as possible. "Which is the
  way?"</p>

  <p>The boy's jaw dropped, and he stared at me speechlessly.</p>

  <p>"To the Mere," he stammered at length. "But you can't go to the Mere at
  night. It bain't safe."</p>

  <p>I smiled a little pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Rot, my good boy," I said. "Anyway, I'll chance it. Now, which is the
  way?"</p>

  <p>"Straight along the road," he answered, pointing up the street. "And when
  you get about two mile out of Drayminster, you'll find a turning going down
  to the right. Take that, and in about another half mile or so you'll see the
  house in front of you."</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment: then he burst out with a further warning.</p>

  <p>"It ain't safe, sir: it be a terrible place at night."</p>

  <p>"Light the lamp, my lad," I said. "Your bicycle will be quite safe,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>He fumbled with a match, and I glanced in through the open door. The
  others were still in the lounge, and just for a moment or two I hesitated.
  Should I tell them after all? When all was said and done it was their show
  more than mine, and the thought of Drummond beside me had much to commend it.
  And then I dismissed it: was I, a grown man, going to admit that I was
  frightened of a stupid story?</p>

  <p>"The lamp be lit, sir," said the boy. "But you be terribly foolish to
  go."</p>

  <p>He turned away and slouched in at the back door, while I got ready to
  mount. Foolish or not, I was going, and the sooner I started the sooner I'd
  be back.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful night, warm and without a breath of wind, and I was
  soon clear of the village. The moon had not yet risen, but there was no
  mistake about the road which ran for the first mile beside the river. Then it
  swung away to the left over some high ground. I found the turning the boy had
  spoken of without difficulty&mdash;one that evidently would lead back towards
  the river. The surface was poor&mdash;it was scarcely more than a lane, and
  little used at that&mdash;and very soon some high trees made the darkness so
  intense that the going was hard. In fact, after a short time I dismounted and
  pushed on on foot.</p>

  <p>Now I make no bones about it, but the fact remains that with every step I
  took I found myself wishing more heartily that I had listened to the boy's
  advice. Whether it was due to the effects of the port wearing off or whether
  the reality was worse than what I had anticipated is immaterial. But after
  I'd walked about fifty yards it was only by the greatest effort of will that
  I prevented myself turning and fleeing incontinently.</p>

  <p>There was a sort of dank feeling about that lane which got on my nerves,
  and the feeble little circle of light from the lamp dancing about in front of
  me as the bicycle jolted only seemed to make the surrounding darkness more
  impenetrable. And at last, acting on a sudden impulse, I blew it out, and
  left the bicycle standing against the hedge. If the landlord's three miles
  was right I must be very near my destination.</p>

  <p>Came a sudden jink in the lane, and there within fifty yards of me stood
  the house. I stopped instinctively: what a fearsome-looking place it was.
  Trees were all round it except on one side where a large pool of water lay
  stagnant and unruffled&mdash;doubtless the pool that had given the place its
  name. The house itself was a big one, and gave an impression of indescribable
  gloom. It seemed to squat there in its setting of trees like a dead thing. No
  gleam of light came from any window: no sound broke the absolute silence.</p>

  <p>I sat down on the bank beside the lane: some plan of action had to be
  decided on. Up till now I hadn't really thought what I was going to do when I
  got there: now it had to be faced. Obviously there was no use in sitting down
  and looking at the place: the clue, if my supposing was right, was not likely
  to be obtained that way. It would be inside the house, and if I wanted to get
  it that is where I should have to go. And the more I thought of it the less
  did I relish it.</p>

  <p>I tried to find excuse for myself. How, for instance, could I get in? The
  answer to that was obvious&mdash;I certainly couldn't tell unless I tried.
  Was it wise for a man to attempt such a thing single-handed? The answer to
  that consisted of one word&mdash;coward. Had I come all this way&mdash;made
  all this song and dance in my own mind&mdash;merely to run away when I
  arrived. I forced myself to view the matter from a common-sense point of
  view.</p>

  <p>"Here," I said out loud, "is an old untenanted house&mdash;set, it is
  true, in gloomy surroundings which look all the more gloomy because it
  happens to be dark. But it is merely a house consisting of bricks and mortar.
  You are a man of the world. Are you going to admit to yourself that you are
  afraid of exploring those bricks and mortar? Are you going to allow yourself
  to be influenced by an ancient story of something that happened ten years
  ago? At any rate go a bit closer and have a look."</p>

  <p>At that I compromised to start with. I would go a bit closer and have a
  look. Very likely I should find everything shut and barred: if so I should
  have no alternative but to go home. Skirting along the undergrowth I
  approached the house. Stone steps covered with weeds led up to the front
  door, which was overhung with trailing creepers and ivy. For a moment I
  hesitated: then I went up the steps and cautiously tried the handle of the
  door. To my great relief it was locked, and the feeling that honour was
  satisfied was very strong. I could now go back to the Angler's Rest in order
  to get something to open the door with. And even as I so decided I seemed to
  hear Drummond's voice saying&mdash;"What about the ground floor windows?
  Didn't you try them?"</p>

  <p>Right! I would. And then there would be no possibility of any back chat.
  Keeping close into the wall I skirted round the house. And I hadn't gone
  twenty yards before I was brought up standing. There in front of me was a
  wide-open window. All I had to do was to put my leg over the sill and I
  should be inside the house.</p>

  <p>I peered in doubtfully: dimly I saw a table, some chairs, and, on the
  other side of the room, an open door. The musty smell of long disuse was
  overpowering, and I knew that if I hesitated for long I should hesitate for
  good. I flung a leg over, and stepped on to the floor.</p>

  <p>The dust was thick everywhere. It rose in choking clouds, and deadened the
  sound of my feet as I crept towards the open door. It was almost like walking
  on a carpet, and it struck me that whatever might have happened in the past
  no one, could have been in the house for months, if not years. So what was
  the good of going on? I paused in the doorway to consider that new point. If
  no one had been in, the clue could not be in the house: it must, if I was on
  the right track, be in the garden outside.</p>

  <p>In front of me was the hall. I could just see the staircase to my right,
  and opposite me was a piece of furniture that looked like a hat-rack. I
  peered across at it: was it my imagination, or was there something white that
  was hanging on one of the pegs&mdash;something that might be a piece of
  paper? Was it possible that here was the actual clue I was searching for?</p>

  <p>I tiptoed across the hall: and almost trembling with excitement I struck a
  match. One word was written on it&mdash;Excelsior.</p>

  <p>The match burned out, and I did not light another. No need to rack one's
  brain to interpret that message. True, it proved I was on the right track,
  which was gratifying to my pride as a solver of conundrums, but it also
  indicated with painful clearness the next move. There was only one way to
  Excelsior in that house, and that was to go upstairs. And the thought of
  going upstairs left me chilled to the marrow.</p>

  <p>I stood staring at the dim outline of the staircase fading into utter
  blackness at the top. Where I was, a faint light did come from the open door
  by which I had entered. Above, the darkness was absolute. Should I, or should
  I not? And though I say it myself, I consider that a certain amount of credit
  was due to me for deciding in the affirmative. I'd go and have a look at the
  top of the stairs.</p>

  <p>Still on tiptoe I crossed the hall to the foot of them. A mouldering
  carpet existed in patches, and I began to ascend cautiously for fear of
  tripping up. But no care on my part could prevent the stairs creaking
  abominably, and in the silence of the house each step I took sounded like a
  pistol shot.</p>

  <p>At last I reached the top. Now that I was there the darkness was not quite
  so intense: a little of the light from the open door below managed to filter
  up. To my right and left ran a passage, and putting my hand in my pocket I
  counted the coins. Odd to the left: even to the right. There were seven, and
  I started feeling my way towards the left. And I can't have taken more than
  half a dozen steps when a strange creaking noise came from the hall, and at
  the same moment I realized it was getting darker. I stopped abruptly, and
  peered below. And what I saw froze me stiff with fright. The door by which I
  had entered was closing, and even as I looked at it, it shut with a bang.
  Then once more absolute silence.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two I gave way to blind panic. I rushed as I thought in
  the direction of the stairs, and hit a wall. I turned round and rushed
  another way, and hit another wall. Then I forced myself to stand still: I'd
  lost my bearings completely: I hadn't an idea where the stairs were. Like a
  fool that I was I had walked straight into the trap, and the trap had shut
  behind me.</p>

  <p>My first instinctive thought was to light a match&mdash;anything seemed
  better than this impenetrable blackness. And then prudence won. If there were
  people round me all I should do would be to give myself away. I was safer in
  the dark. At any rate we were on equal terms.</p>

  <p>I crouched against the wall with my heart going in sickening thumps, and
  listened. Not a sound. The silence was as complete as the darkness. And I
  began to wonder if there was anyone in the house&mdash;any human that is. Was
  it a material agency that had shut that door&mdash;or was it something
  supernatural? Would some ghastly thing suddenly hurl itself on me: something
  against which even Drummond with all his strength would be powerless? Every
  ghost story I'd ever heard of came back to me along with the comforting
  reflection that I had always ridiculed the idea that there were such things.
  But it is one thing to be sceptical in the smoking-room of your club, and
  quite another when you are crouching in inky darkness in a deserted house
  from which your line of escape has been cut off.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I started violently: an odd slithering noise had begun. It was
  rather as if a sack full of corn was being bumped on the floor, and it seemed
  to come from my left. I peered in what I thought was the right direction
  while the sweat ran off me in streams. Was it my imagination, or was there a
  faint luminosity in the darkness about three feet from the ground? I stared
  at it and it moved. With each bump it moved, and it was coming closer. Step
  by step I backed away from it: step by step it kept pace with me. And for the
  first time in my life I knew the meaning of the word terror. Frightened I had
  been many times: this was stark, raving horror. I was stiff and paralysed
  with fear. Was this the thing that had sent the other man mad?</p>

  <p>Then, as if a veil had suddenly been torn away, came the change. One
  instant there had been merely a faint lessening of the darkness: the next I
  found myself staring into a shining yellow face of such inconceivable
  malignity that I almost screamed. It was not two feet away, and about on a
  level with my chest. I hit at it blindly, and found my wrist caught in a grip
  of steel. Then I felt a hand creeping up my coat until it reached my throat,
  and I began to struggle wildly.</p>

  <p>I kicked into the darkness, and my foot hit something solid. There was a
  grunt of pain, and the grip on my throat tightened savagely. The face drew
  nearer, and there came a roaring in my ears. And I had just given myself up
  as finished when a thing happened so staggering that I could scarcely believe
  my eyes.</p>

  <p>Out of the darkness from behind the shining face there came a pair of
  hands. I could see them clearly&mdash;just the hands and nothing more, as if
  they were disembodied. There was a curious red scar on the middle finger of
  the right hand, and the left thumbnail was distorted. With the utmost
  deliberation they fastened on the throat of my assailant, and began to drag
  him backwards. For a while he resisted: then quite suddenly the grip on my
  throat relaxed. Half insensible I sank down on the floor and lay there
  watching. For the moment my only coherent thought was relief that I could
  breathe again, that the yellow face was going. Writhing furiously, its mouth
  twisted into a snarl of rage, it seemed to be borne backwards by those two
  detached hands. And even as I tried foolishly to understand what it all
  meant, there came from down below a well-known voice&mdash;"The more we are
  together." The relief was too much: I did another thing for the first time in
  my life. I fainted.</p>

  <p>I came to, to find the whole bunch regarding me by the light of half a
  dozen candles.</p>

  <p>"Look here, little man," said Drummond, "what merry jaunt have you been up
  to this time?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know I was here," I asked feebly.</p>

  <p>"The landlord's son told us you'd borrowed his bicycle," he answered. "And
  since they all seemed very alarmed at the pub we thought we'd come along and
  see. We found your machine outside, and then we found you here unconscious.
  What's the worry? have you seen a ghost?"</p>

  <p>"Seen and felt it," I said grimly. "A ghastly shining yellow face, with
  fingers like steel bars that got me by the throat. And he'd have killed me
  but for a pair of hands that came out of the darkness and got him by the
  throat as well."</p>

  <p>They looked at me suspiciously until Jerningham suddenly peered at my
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he said, "look at the marks on his throat."</p>

  <p>They crowded round, and I laughed irritably.</p>

  <p>"You don't imagine I dreamed it, do you. The thing that attacked me had a
  grip like a mantrap."</p>

  <p>"Tell us again exactly what happened," said Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>I told them, starting with my conversation with the old gentleman that
  afternoon. And when I'd finished he whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Dixon: well done! It was a damned sporting thing to come here
  alone. But, laddie don't do it again I beg of you. For unless I'm greatly
  mistaken, but for our happening to arrive when we did your only interest by
  this time would have been the site for your grave."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Phosphorous evidently on the man's face who attacked you. An old trick.
  Probably our headlights alarmed them, and the owner of the hands dragged him
  off. So that there are at least two unpleasing persons in this house beside
  us."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his hands gently together.</p>

  <p>"Splendid! At last we come to grips. Blow out those candles, boys: there's
  no good advertising our position too clearly. And then I think a little
  exploration of the old family mansion."</p>

  <p>Once more we were in darkness save for the beam of Drummond's torch. He
  had it focused on the floor, and after a while he stooped down and examined
  the marks in the dust.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary track," he remarked. "There doesn't seem to be any
  sign of footmarks. It's one broad smear."</p>

  <p>We crowded round, and it certainly was a most peculiar trail. In width
  about eighteen inches to two feet, it stretched down the middle of the
  passage as far as we could see. And suddenly Drummond turned to me with a
  queer look in his eyes. "You say this face seemed to be about on a level with
  your chest," he said.</p>

  <p>"Just about," I answered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because it strikes me that you've had even a narrower escape that we
  thought," he remarked. "The thing that attacked you hadn't got any legs. It
  was a monstrosity: some ghastly abnormality. The owner of the pair of hands
  dragged it after him, and that's the trail it left."</p>

  <p>"It is a jolly house," murmured Darrell. "What does A. do now?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you think," grunted Drummond. "A. follows the trail,
  and for the love of Mike don't get behind the light."</p>

  <p>Now I don't suppose I should ever have thought of that. I could see
  Drummond in front, his right arm fully extended, holding the torch, while he
  kept over to the left of the passage. Behind him, in single file, we all of
  us followed, and, once when I drifted over to the right, Sinclair, who was
  just behind me, pulled me back.</p>

  <p>"If anyone shoots," he muttered, "they shoot at the torch. Keep in
  line."</p>

  <p>And the words had hardly left his mouth when there came an angry phut from
  in front of us, and a splintering of wood from behind. Simultaneously
  Drummond switched off the light. Silence, save for our heavy
  breathing&mdash;and then once again did I hear that ominous slithering
  noise.</p>

  <p>"Look out," I cried. "That's the thing moving."</p>

  <p>Then came Drummond's voice, sharp and insistent. "Light. Give me light. My
  God! what is it?"</p>

  <p>And never to my dying day shall I forget the spectacle we saw when
  Darrell's torch focused and steadied on Drummond. The thing was on
  him&mdash;clawing at him: a thing that looked like a black sack. Its hands
  were fastened on his throat, and it was by his throat that it was supporting
  itself. Because it had no legs&mdash;only two stumps. It was mouthing and
  gibbering, and altogether dreadful. Some faint luminosity still remained on
  its face, but in the light of the torch it was hardly noticeable. And then I
  forgot everything in watching that ghastly struggle.</p>

  <p>The dust was rising in little eddies as Drummond moved, carrying the thing
  with him. Of its almost superhuman strength no one knew better than I, and in
  a few seconds the veins were standing out on Drummond's forehead. Then he
  braced himself against the wall, and gripped its wrists with his hands. I
  could see the muscles taut and bulging under the sleeves of his coat as he
  tried to wrench the thing's hands away from his throat. But in spite of his
  enormous strength, he told me afterwards that but for the knowledge of a
  certain ju-jitsu grip by which a man's fingers can be forced open, the thing
  would have throttled him unless we had helped. As it was, help was
  unnecessary: the murderous hold relaxed, and, with a heave, Drummond flung
  the thing away from him. It landed on the floor with a thud, and for a space
  it stood there balancing itself on its hands and glaring at us. Then, like
  some great misshapen ape, it disappeared up the passage, moving on its hands
  and stumps.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" grunted Drummond, "what a little pet."</p>

  <p>"Where's the gun, Hugh," said Darrell curtly. His torch was flashing on
  the empty passage. "Put it out, Peter," snapped Drummond. "I'm thinking that
  gun belonged to the other bloke. We'll follow up in darkness."</p>

  <p>And then, before we had gone two steps, there came from in front of us a
  loud crash, followed by a terrible scream. The scream was not repeated: only
  a low moaning noise could be heard, and after a while that also ceased. Once
  again the silence was absolute.</p>

  <p>"For the love of Heaven," came Drummond's hoarse whisper. "Keep your eyes
  skinned. Who is the last man?"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Jerningham. "Don't worry about this end." We crept forward,
  guided by momentary flashes of Drummond's torch. The trail was easy to
  follow. It led along the passage for about fifteen yards, and then turned to
  the right through an open door.</p>

  <p>"Stop here," said Drummond quietly. "I'm going in alone."</p>

  <p>And just as little details about him had struck me before, so on this
  occasion did the almost incredible swiftness and silence of his movements
  impress my mind. One instant he was there: the next he was not, but no sound
  had marked his going.</p>

  <p>We clustered round the open door waiting. Once a board creaked inside, and
  then suddenly we heard a startled exclamation, and Drummond rejoined us.</p>

  <p>"There's something pretty grim happened," he muttered. "Stand well away
  from the door. I'm going to switch on the torch."</p>

  <p>The beam flashed on, and outlined against it was the ominous silhouette of
  a revolver held in his other hand. And for a space the two remained
  motionless: then the revolver fell to his side.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" he muttered. "Poor brute!"</p>

  <p>The crash and the scream were accounted for: also the silence that had
  followed. Lying motionless on the floor close to the further wall was the
  thing that had attacked him. And it needed no second glance to see that it
  was dead. There was a dreadful wound in the head; in fact, it was split
  completely open. And further details are unnecessary.</p>

  <p>For a while we stared at it stupidly&mdash;the same thought in all our
  minds. How had it happened? Because save for the motionless figure on the
  floor the room was empty. What was it that had struck the poor brute this
  ghastly blow in the darkness. Nothing had come out of the door, and the only
  window was boarded up.</p>

  <p>It was a peculiar room with stone walls and a stone ceiling, and what it
  could have been used for in the past completely defeated me. Let into the
  wall near which the body was lying were six iron rings: except for them, the
  walls were absolutely bare. They were fixed in a straight line about a yard
  from the floor, and were three or four feet apart. And below each ring the
  boarding was worn away as if it had been gnawed by rats. "Didn't the landlord
  say that the farmer who was murdered kept savage dogs?" said Darrell. "He
  probably used those staples to chain them up."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he did," said Drummond grimly. "But there ain't any dogs here now,
  Peter, and what I want to know is what killed that poor brute."</p>

  <p>Once again we fell silent staring at the twisted body.</p>

  <p>"He looks as if he had been bashed over the head with a steam-hammer,"
  said Jerningham at length. "That crash we heard was it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, damn it!" cried Drummond. "But what caused the crash."</p>

  <p>He took a step or two towards the body, and even as he did so there came
  to me, out of the blue so to speak, an idea. What made me think of it I don't
  know: what made me suddenly remember my conversation with the old gentleman
  that afternoon, I can't say. But the fact remains that mercifully I did. It
  was the remark he had made to me that had first caused me to suspect him. I
  could see him, even as I stood there, giving me that strange, penetrating
  stare and saying "Was it fifth or sixth? It might make a lot of difference."
  And the dead thing was lying between the fifth and sixth ring.</p>

  <p>"I think I've got it," I said slowly. "It's part of the clue I was given
  this afternoon, and up till now I'd forgotten it."</p>

  <p>They listened while I told them, and when I'd finished Drummond nodded his
  head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You're probably right," he said. "Let's work on the assumption, at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>"That's all very fine and large," grunted Darrell. "But we don't want the
  same result, old boy. And it strikes me that if you make a mistake you won't
  make a second."</p>

  <p>"I've got to chance it, Peter," answered Drummond doggedly. "If Dixon is
  right, we're on the track of the next clue. And nothing matters except
  getting that. Let's think for a moment. What's the natural thing to do when
  you see a ring in a wall? Pull the blamed thing, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Probably what that poor brute was doing when he was killed," said
  Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Then I will pull it, too," announced Drummond calmly.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, man," cried Jerningham, "What's the use?"</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen," said Drummond. "But we're going to pull those
  rings&mdash;and we're going to pull 'em now. Toby, go back to the car with
  Algy. Keep close together going through the house. In the toolbox you'll find
  my towrope. Bring it. And don't forget that there is at least one
  unconsidered little trifle loose in the house."</p>

  <p>"If I'm right," he went on as they left the room, "the danger must lie
  close to the wall. That thing never moved with a wound like that in his head:
  he died on the spot where he was hit. Anyway, one must take a chance."</p>

  <p>And his hand as he lit a cigarette was as steady as a rock.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; IN WHICH WE EXPLORE THE MERE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is nervy work waiting. I know that my feelings were
  strongly reminiscent of those that I had experienced in France when the
  latest reports from the seats of the mighty indicated that enemy mining was
  proceeding underneath one's trench. To dangers seen and heard one can get
  tolerably used, but the unseen, silent horror of this room was making me
  jumpy. I felt I almost preferred my fight in the darkness with the thing that
  now lay dead.</p>

  <p>At last, after what seemed an interminable time, Sinclair and Longworth
  returned with the rope.</p>

  <p>"See anyone?" said Drummond casually.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. But I thought I saw a gleam of light from one of the top
  rooms," said Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Probably our friend of the gun. Give me the rope, and let's get on with
  it."</p>

  <p>"Look here, old man," said Darrell, "let's toss."</p>

  <p>"Go to hell," remarked Drummond tersely. "It's good of you, Peter, old
  lad, but this is my show. The only point is that in case anything happens I
  rely on you to carry on the good work."</p>

  <p>He walked across to the fifth ring and slipped the rope through it. Then
  he stepped back, and we breathed again. Nothing had happened so far.</p>

  <p>"Stand clear," he said. "I'm going to pull."</p>

  <p>He gave a tug on the rope, and the next instant it was wrenched out of his
  hand. Some huge object had flashed downwards through the beam of his torch
  and landed with a sickening thud on the dead man, tearing the rope out of his
  grasp as it fell. Instinctively he turned the light upwards. In the ceiling
  was a square, black hole, and we had a momentary glimpse of a face peering at
  us through it. Then it was gone, and we were left staring upwards
  foolishly.</p>

  <p>It was Drummond who recovered himself first.</p>

  <p>"A booby-trap that I like not the smell of," he said savagely. "Keep that
  hole in the ceiling covered, Ted, and shoot on sight."</p>

  <p>It must have weighed a couple of hundredweight&mdash;the slab that had
  come out of the ceiling. There was a staple let into the centre of it, with a
  wire rope attached, by which it had evidently been hoisted back into position
  the first time. One could see the faint outline of some sort of winding gear
  above the opening, but of the man who had operated it there was no sign.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I like not the smell of it," he repeated grimly. "It's
  murder&mdash;pure and simple. But if the swine think they're going to stop us
  they're wrong."</p>

  <p>"What's the next move?" said someone shakily.</p>

  <p>"See what happens when we pull the sixth ring," he said. "If what Dixon
  said is right, that's the other important one."</p>

  <p>"Probably the floor will give way this time." remarked Algy Longworth
  gloomily. "I feel I should like a mother's soothing comfort."</p>

  <p>We waited tensely while Drummond again adjusted the rope. He began to
  pull, and suddenly he gave a triumphant exclamation.</p>

  <p>"It's moving."</p>

  <p>It was: a crack was appearing in the wall. And then with a faint creak the
  whole block of stone swung round on a pivot, leaving an opening about three
  feet wide and six feet high.</p>

  <p>"The poor brute was looking for that, I suppose," said Drummond, "and in
  the darkness pulled the wrong ring."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room, and then stopped abruptly. He was staring at a piece
  of paper fastened to the back of the part that had moved.</p>

  <p>"Well done, little man," he read slowly. "Any casualties yet? But you've
  still got a long way to go, and I've got some far better jests for you before
  you've finished. Incidentally the charming gentleman without any legs is an
  impromptu turn as far as I am concerned. I found him on the premises when I
  arrived, and he struck me as being quite in keeping with the general
  character of the house. I rather think he must be the so-called ghost, and I
  do hope he's behaved himself. But if he hasn't don't blame me. His
  predilections seem quite delightfully murderous, and he resents any intrusion
  terribly. But doubtless somebody loves him. Phyllis is still quite well,
  though just a leetle bit off her food. Isn't this fun?"</p>

  <p>"Damn the woman," said Drummond angrily. Then he began to laugh. "Though,
  'pon my soul," he went on, "if it wasn't for Phyllis, I think I should agree
  with her."</p>

  <p>"Time enough for that, old boy, when we're through," said Jerningham.
  "Hasn't it struck you that at the moment we're in a rather bad strategical
  position? It's a sitting shot either from the ceiling or through that
  opening."</p>

  <p>"You've said a mouthful, Ted," agreed Drummond, "Back into the passage,
  and we'll have a council of war."</p>

  <p>The moon had risen, and an eerie half light was filtering through the
  dirty windows, making the place seem, if possible, more ghostly than
  before.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said Drummond, "let's get down to the meat juice. I should
  think that what our one and only Irma says is right, and that the poor devil
  dead in there has been responsible for all the stories about this place.
  Probably used that phosphorous trick to frighten people. Anyway, he's
  out."</p>

  <p>"Next man in is the bloke with the hands who let drive with his bundook,"
  said Darrell thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And any other little pals of his who may be lying about," went on
  Drummond. "But the thing to decide is where is the next clue?"</p>

  <p>"The betting is a pony to a dried pea that it's down that secret passage,"
  said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"Then down the passage we go, old son. But not all of us. If this was an
  ordinary house I wouldn't mind. But that booby-trap in there was specially
  prepared, and there are probably others. The question is how many of us go. I
  think three are enough. That leaves three to guard this end. You five do
  fingers out for it: two of you to come."</p>

  <p>"Let's all come in," said Sinclair. "You too, Hugh."</p>

  <p>"No," said Drummond decisively. "I'm going, anyway. Get a move on."</p>

  <p>"What are fingers out?" I asked mildly.</p>

  <p>"Laddie," said Drummond, "you may be a whale at conundrums, and I take off
  my hat to you over this evening's show. But your education is a bit
  deficient. At the word go, extend as many fingers as you like in front of
  you. One hand only: thumbs don't count. Go."</p>

  <p>I extended two: a complicated mathematical proceeding took place, and the
  winner appeared to be Sinclair. "Once again," said Drummond. "Only the four
  of you. Go."</p>

  <p>This time I extended three, and hoped for the best.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen in all, and we start with Dixon."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," I murmured: I didn't mind who he started with. The passage, in
  spite of the dust, was comfortable: and, as far as I could see, the ceiling
  was ordinary lath and plaster.</p>

  <p>"Come on then," said Drummond. "I'll go first, then Dixon, then Toby."</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes abruptly. I suppose I'm not very clever at that game. I
  appeared to have won, anyway, which was frightfully jolly and all that.</p>

  <p>"Just guard this end, you three," said Drummond. "And you'd better give us
  a couple of hours at least."</p>

  <p>He stepped back into the room, and flashed his torch up at the hole in the
  ceiling. No sign of anyone, and he led the way across the floor to the
  opening in the wall.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," he whispered urgently, "that anything may happen."</p>

  <p>"I won't," I assured him, and wondered if a ton of masonry on one's head
  was a comparatively painless death.</p>

  <p>The passage led downwards, and the walls and ceiling gradually grew damper
  and damper, until large drops of water splashed on my head at each step I
  took forward. Drummond was in front with his torch, and progress was slow as
  he tested every foothold he took before advancing. At length he paused, and
  waited for us to come up with him.</p>

  <p>"I believe we're under the mere," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Hooray!" I cried enthusiastically. "I've always wanted to drown."</p>

  <p>And suddenly he began to shake with laughter. "You priceless bird," he
  remarked. "Look here&mdash;you go back&mdash;you've done your fair share for
  tonight&mdash;and Toby and I will go on."</p>

  <p>"Be blowed for a yarn," I said. "Let's get on with it." Once more we crept
  forward, and at length the passage started to rise again. It seemed to be
  bending right-handed the whole time, and was getting drier and drier.
  Suddenly Drummond paused; we had come to a fork. To the right a flight of
  stone steps led upwards: to the left it continued on the level.</p>

  <p>"Shall we try the steps first," whispered Drummond, and the next instant
  he switched off his torch. For quite distinctly and from close to had come
  the sound of a woman's voice.</p>

  <p>"It can't be possible that we've found her," he breathed.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;your wife?" I muttered.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the other," he answered. "Supposing she didn't expect us to
  track her so quickly, and as a result we've caught her up."</p>

  <p>Once again came the voice, and this time a man spoke too.</p>

  <p>"It's up the steps," said Drummond. "Toby&mdash;you wait here: we may be
  putting our heads straight into it. If anything happens, sprint back to the
  others and tell them. Dixon&mdash;you come half way up as far as the
  bend."</p>

  <p>I crept up behind him, feeling with my fingers on the walls. And suddenly
  I found Drummond's hand on my arm.</p>

  <p>"Stay there," he whispered. "I'm going on alone."</p>

  <p>Not two yards in front of us a beam of light shone out from under a closed
  door.</p>

  <p>I waited tensely, crouched against the wall: could it be possible that we
  had run this woman to earth&mdash;that she was on the other side of the door?
  And, if so, how many men were likely to be with her? True, we had only heard
  one voice, but that meant nothing.</p>

  <p>With a crash Drummond flung open the door and stepped into the room. A man
  and a woman were sitting at a table on which the remains of a meal were
  lying. Two candles guttered in the sudden draught, and with a cry of fear the
  woman rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Keep your hands on the table&mdash;both of you," snapped Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" said the man in a surly voice, his eyes fixed on the
  revolver. "And what d'you want?"</p>

  <p>"A little conversation, my friend," said Drummond. "In the first
  place&mdash;who are you? And who is the lady?"</p>

  <p>He flashed his torch on her face, and stared at her intently. She was a
  haggard, unkempt woman. Her face was lined and wrinkled, her hair streaked
  with grey. And she looked most desperately ill.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind who we are," said the man angrily. "It ain't no blasted
  business of yours, is it? What are you doing in this house, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I admit," answered Drummond pleasantly, "that under normal circumstances
  you would have a certain amount of justification for your question. But you
  can hardly call this house normal, can you?"</p>

  <p>"Are you the police, mister?" said the woman, speaking for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>"I am not," said Drummond. "I've got nothing to do with them."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want," said the man again. "Are you one of the bunch
  who have been fooling round this house for the last few weeks."</p>

  <p>"We get warm," remarked Drummond. "No&mdash;I am not one of the bunch. At
  the same time, though not of them I am after them, if you get me. But for
  them I should not be here. Am I to take it, then, that you disown them
  also."</p>

  <p>The man cursed foully. "Disown them," he snarled. "For two pins I'd have
  murdered the lot."</p>

  <p>"Then it was not you who rigged up that pleasant little booby-trap?"</p>

  <p>"What booby-trap? Look here, mister, I'm getting fair sick of this. For
  God's sake clear out."</p>

  <p>The woman put a restraining hand on his arm, and whispered something in
  his ear. She seemed to be trying to pacify him, and after a time he shrugged
  his shoulders and stood up. "Sorry, sir, if I lost my temper. But if you
  ain't the police, and you ain't one of that bunch, then what do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"One moment," said Drummond. "Dixon," he called over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he whispered as I joined him, "would you recognize the hands
  of the man who dragged that thing away from you?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly should," I answered. "And it's not this bloke."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Good. That's one thing settled, anyway. Now," he resumed.
  "I'll tell you what we want. Hidden somewhere in this charming country
  mansion is a piece of paper or a letter or a message of some sort which I am
  looking for. Do you know where it is?"</p>

  <p>The man looked at the woman, and she looked at him. "I reckon I do," he
  said. "And it's in a place you'd never find if you looked for ten years."</p>

  <p>Drummond's eyes never left his face. "How do you know where it is?" he
  said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Because I saw one of them people put it there," answered the man.</p>

  <p>"Will you show me where it is?" continued Drummond.</p>

  <p>Once again the woman bent and whispered to him.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Look here, sir, I'll show you where it is if you'll
  give me your word that you won't tell a living soul you've seen us here."</p>

  <p>And suddenly the truth dawned on me.</p>

  <p>"I believe," I whispered to Drummond, "that this is the man who murdered
  the farmer ten years ago. They've been hiding here ever since."</p>

  <p>"Are you the man who murdered Farmer Jesson?" shot out Drummond
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>The woman gave a little scream, and clutched his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind who I am," he said angrily. "You've forced your way in
  here, and I've got to trust you. But unless you give me your word to say
  nothing, you can damned well look for that envelope yourself."</p>

  <p>"I give you my word," said Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>"What about your friend?"</p>

  <p>"I speak for all of us," said Drummond. "Now lead on. But you'd better
  understand one thing, my friend. Any monkey tricks, and you'll be for it good
  and strong."</p>

  <p>The man looked straight at him.</p>

  <p>"Why should there be any monkey tricks?" he remarked quietly. "All I want
  is to see the last of you as soon as possible. Follow me."</p>

  <p>He took a lantern off a nail in the wall and lit the candle inside. Then
  he led the way down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Who's this?" He stopped suspiciously as the light showed up Toby Sinclair
  still waiting in the passage.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine," said Drummond. "My promise covers him."</p>

  <p>"There's someone else about here, Hugh," said Toby in a low voice. "While
  you've been up there I've seen a gleam of light along the passage to the
  left, and I'm almost certain I heard movement."</p>

  <p>Drummond turned to the man.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear that?" he said curtly. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another. This place has been like a rabbit warren lately."</p>

  <p>"Which way do we go?"</p>

  <p>"Along there," he pointed, "where your friend says he saw the light. Don't
  you want to go? It doesn't matter to me."</p>

  <p>He stood there swinging his lantern. By its light I could see Drummond
  staring at him intently: was it or was it not a trap? The man's face was
  expressionless: he seemed completely indifferent as to whether we went or
  whether we didn't. And at last Drummond made up his mind.</p>

  <p>"Lead on," he ordered. "But don't forget I'm just behind you, and there
  will be no soft music to herald the hitting."</p>

  <p>Certainly there was no further gleam of light from in front, and the
  feeble flicker of the candle only seemed to intensify the surrounding
  darkness. The passage itself was opening out a little, and the roof was
  higher, so that walking was easy. And we must have gone about thirty yards
  when we came to a heavy wooden door. It was open, and our guide passed
  through without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"The note is in this room," he said, holding the lantern above his head.
  By its light we could see it was of a similar type to the one we had just
  left. There was a table and a couple of chairs, and the whole place smelt of
  disuse, and reeked of damp. Water dripped from the ceiling and the walls, and
  it struck me that wherever we had been before, we were now most certainly
  under the mere.</p>

  <p>"Well, get it," snapped Drummond. "This place stinks worse than a seaside
  boarding-house."</p>

  <p>"It isn't quite so easy to get it," said the man, and, even as he spoke, I
  knew we were trapped. A sudden look in his eyes; a scowl that was half a
  sneer&mdash;and then darkness. He had blown out the candle.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" roared Drummond, and from the door the man toughed.</p>

  <p>"You poor boobs," came his mocking voice. "You don't know enough to come
  in out of the wet."</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;perhaps that remark was worth it to him: perhaps it was not. It
  just gave Drummond time to switch on his torch. By its light we saw the door
  closing, and the fingers of the man's hand round it. And the next instant a
  shot rang out. For quickness of shooting combined with accuracy I would never
  have believed it possible. Drummond had plugged him through the fingers. A
  torrent of blasphemy came from the other side of the door as we sprang
  towards it: but we were just too late. The bolt clanged home as we got there:
  we were shut in. And from the other side of the door the blasphemy
  continued.</p>

  <p>At last it ceased, and Drummond bent and picked something off the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"I have here," he said, "the top joint of one of your fingers. The next
  time I see you, my friend, you shall have it served up as a savoury."</p>

  <p>We listened to the retreating footsteps, and he gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"On balance I think we win," he remarked. "Peter and Co. are bound to find
  us, and until they do we can think out a few choice methods of cooking
  fingers."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette thoughtfully, and then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Damn the fellow! And that fish-faced woman was in it, too, I suppose.
  They certainly fooled us all right."</p>

  <p>He flashed his torch round the room. There was no trace of a window, but
  of one thing there was more than a trace. It stared us straight in the
  face&mdash;a sheet of notepaper pinned in the centre of the wall opposite the
  door. We crowded round it, and in silence we read the message written in the
  handwriting we were getting to know so well.</p>

  <p>"Will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly? My dear friend,
  I grieve for you. This is not the old form at all. But then I always thought,
  little one, that your resemblance to a bull in a china shop was just a little
  too pronounced. And this time you've done it. Honestly I never thought the
  chase would end quite yet. In some ways I'm sorry: I had one or two beauties
  left for you. In fact the next clue is in tomorrow's Times, which I now fear
  you will never see.</p>

  <p>"How many of you are there in here, I wonder? That will be reported to me
  naturally in due course, but my woman's curiosity prompts me to put down the
  question now. Because I have taken steps to cover all tracks, and I fear your
  bodies will never be recovered.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, mon ami. What I shall do with Phyllis remains to be seen. Play
  with her a little longer, anyway, I think."</p>

  <p>We stared at one another speechlessly. What on earth did the woman
  mean&mdash;"bodies never recovered."</p>

  <p>"That's where she's made her blooming error," grunted Drummond. But his
  voice didn't carry much conviction. "Let's have a look at that door," he went
  on. "There must be some way out."</p>

  <p>But there wasn't; the door was as solid as the wall. And it was while we
  were examining the bolt that a faint hissing noise became audible. Drummond
  straightened up and stood listening.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce is that?" he muttered. "And where does it come from?"</p>

  <p>Once again his torch flashed round the room. The noise was increasing till
  it was almost a shrill whistle and we located it at once. It came from a
  small circular metal pipe that stuck out about three inches from the wall
  close by the door. I put my finger over it: the pressure was too great too
  keep it there. Some gas was being pumped into the room, and the same thought
  struck us all. There was no ventilation.</p>

  <p>"She would seem," said Drummond calmly, "to have won. Unless Peter arrives
  in time. Sorry, you chaps."</p>

  <p>"What's the gas," cried Toby Sinclair. "I used to know something about
  chemistry."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't," said Drummond. "And whatever it is it's not likely to be
  for the benefit of our health."</p>

  <p>"Keep the torch on the pipe, Hugh," said Toby quietly. He, too, put his
  finger on the end, then he tasted it and smelt it.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he muttered, and his voice was shaking a little. "No smell:
  practically no taste. Do you fellows mind if I take a chance."</p>

  <p>"We mind strongly if you don't," said Drummond calmly. "And do it darned
  quickly."</p>

  <p>Sinclair struck a match: came a sudden little pop and from the end of the
  pipe there shot out a long blue flame.</p>

  <p>"I was right," he said, wiping his forehead. "It's carbon monoxide.
  Another five minutes and she would have won. As it is if we take turns at
  breathing through the keyhole we ought to escape with only a head like the
  morning after."</p>

  <p>"Mother's bright boy," said Drummond lightly, but I saw his hand rest for
  a moment on Sinclair's shoulder. "Explain."</p>

  <p>"Carbon monoxide, old boy. Don't taste, or smell, and you can't see it.
  One of the most deadly poisonous gases known to science. If you light it it
  forms carbon dioxide which isn't poisonous, but only suffocates. So if as I
  say we breathe through the keyhole in turn, and Peter isn't too long, we
  ought to get away with it."</p>

  <p>It was a weird scene&mdash;almost fantastic. I remember thinking at the
  time that it simply couldn't be true; that it was some incredible nightmare
  from which I should shortly wake up. In turn we solemnly stooped down, put
  our mouths to the keyhole and sucked in the pure air from the other side of
  the door. One, two, three; one, two, three&mdash;for all the world like
  performing marionettes.</p>

  <p>It was Sinclair who noticed it first, and nudged us both to draw our
  attention because speaking was ill-advised. The flame was decreasing in size.
  Now it was burning fitfully. At times it shot out to its original length. At
  others it almost died away. And then suddenly it went out altogether.</p>

  <p>He took a piece of paper from his pocket and a pencil.</p>

  <p>"Go on at the keyhole," he wrote. "Don't speak unless it's essential. Room
  full of carbon dioxide, but no more coming now."</p>

  <p>One, two, three&mdash;suck; one, two, three&mdash;suck; till my back was
  aching and I cursed Darrell and the others for not coming. Surely to Heaven
  it must be at least three hours by now since we had left them. And then
  another ghastly thought struck me. Even when they did come how were they
  going to open the door without a key? And there was no key in the
  keyhole.</p>

  <p>One, two, three&mdash;suck: damn this confounded woman and all her works.
  I felt that I would willingly have given the whole of my extremely modest
  fortune and then some to have had the privilege of putting her in the room,
  and laughing at her from the other side of the door.</p>

  <p>One, two, three&mdash;suck; t was becoming utterly intolerable. Once I
  chanced it and took a breath in the room, and it felt as if an eiderdown had
  been pressed over my mouth. Carbon dioxide&mdash;used-up air. Old tags of
  chemistry came back to me in the intervals of one, two, three&mdash;suck.</p>

  <p>Suddenly we all of us paused instinctively: a key had been put in the
  keyhole. The bolt was turning, and with our heads feeling as if iron bands
  were fastened round them we stood and watched. Trying not to breathe, and
  with our lungs bursting for air we watched the door open. A hand came round
  the edge&mdash;a hand with a curious red scar on the middle finger. It was
  the man who had dragged the thing away from me earlier in the evening.</p>

  <p>I signed furiously to Drummond, but as he said afterwards it was a matter
  of complete indifference to him whose hand it was. All he wanted was air, and
  a grip on somebody's throat. He got both, and he was not feeling amused.</p>

  <p>He was a big man, the owner of the hand, and he was wearing some form of
  respirator. He was also a powerful man, but as I have said Drummond was not
  feeling amused. He shot across the room, did the owner of the hand, as if
  he'd been kicked from close quarters by a mule&mdash;whilst we shot into the
  passage. Then having locked the door and removed the key we sat down and just
  breathed. And if anybody is ever in doubt as to what is the most marvellous
  sensation in the world, they may take it from me that it consists of just
  breathing&mdash;under certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>From the other side of the door came the sound of furious blows. He seemed
  to be hurling himself against it with the whole weight of his body.</p>

  <p>"What about it, Hugh," said Toby. "The respirator he has on is only of use
  against carbon monoxide."</p>

  <p>"Then let him have a whack at breathing through the keyhole," said
  Drummond grimly. "Gosh! I wouldn't go through that last half hour again for
  twenty thousand quid. Besides I want my other little pal, and if I can find
  him he'll eat his finger here and now."</p>

  <p>But of neither the woman nor him was there any trace. The room was empty;
  the birds had flown. And as we stood in the passage at the foot of the stairs
  that led to the room they had been in, the only sound that broke the silence
  was the hoarse shouting of the man who was caught in the trap that had been
  laid for us.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll let the swab out," remarked Drummond thoughtfully. "We
  might get something out of him."</p>

  <p>And it is possible we might have, had not the last little effort in that
  pleasing country mansion taken place. It was purely accidental, and I was
  responsible for it. About a yard along the passage beyond the fork a steel
  bar was sticking out from the wall. It looked strong: it looked quite capable
  of bearing my weight. So I sat on it, and found it was not capable of bearing
  my weight. It collapsed under me, and I found myself on the floor. And even
  as I picked myself up there came from the room we had left a frenzied scream
  of fear, and a strange rushing noise.</p>

  <p>Stupidly we stared at the door, focusing our torches on it. From
  underneath it water was pouring through. From each side, getting higher and
  higher, it came trickling out, until it shot like a jet from a fountain
  through the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"Run," roared Drummond. "Run like hell. If that door gives we're done.
  We've let the lake in."</p>

  <p>It was true: the meaning of the phrase about the bodies not being
  recovered was clear at last. We raced wildly along the passage back towards
  the house. Would the door hold long enough? And it did&mdash;by about five
  seconds. We heard the crash as it gave when we were in the lowest part, and
  we pounded on up the rise. Behind us came the swish of the water now pouring
  unchecked through the open doorway. It came in a wall six feet high along the
  passage, and like a huge wave breaking on the shore it hurled itself after us
  two feet above the level of the mere, and then, angry and swirling, receded
  to its proper height.</p>

  <p>In front of us we could see the opening into the house: behind us, black
  and evil-looking, the water still eddied and heaved. A chair which had been
  swept along by the torrent bobbed up and down on the surface and then
  gradually became still. But of the man who had been in the room there was no
  trace. Hidden somewhere in that underground labyrinth his body still remains,
  and the waters of the mere have sealed his tomb.</p>

  <p>Slowly we climbed the last bit of the passage and stepped into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord," said Jerningham, "you're all right. We were just coming
  to find you, when the most extraordinary upheaval took place in the
  lake."</p>

  <p>Dawn had come, and we followed him to the window outside.</p>

  <p>"It's almost died away now," he went on. "But about five minutes ago,
  right out there in the centre, the water began to heave. Almost like a
  whirlpool. What's happened?"</p>

  <p>"An airy nothing," remarked Drummond. "They've tried to gas us, and
  they've tried to drown us, and&mdash;" He broke off suddenly staring across
  the mere. "It's a difficult light to see in," he said, "but isn't there
  someone moving over there in the undergrowth?" Personally I could see
  nothing, but after a moment or two he nodded. "There is. I see 'em. Two. Back
  from the window, boys: this matter requires thought. No one has come out this
  way, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Drummond to Sinclair and me, "those two on the other side are
  fish-faced Lizzie and her gentleman friend."</p>

  <p>"Shall we round 'em up?" remarked Toby.</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he said at length. "Look here&mdash;let us consider this
  matter because it seems to me that we have come to the parting of the ways. I
  suppose nobody has a bottle of Bass? Bad staff work. However, let us pull
  ourselves together, and get the grey matter to function."</p>

  <p>He sighed profoundly.</p>

  <p>"A ghastly hour to do so, but I have the glimmerings of an idea. Now,
  first of all there were in this house four individuals that we know of.
  First, the legless bird who got a brick on his head. Now it's possible that
  what she said in her note was right, and that he wasn't one of the party, but
  just went with the house. Anyway it doesn't matter, he is out of it."</p>

  <p>He held out an enormous finger.</p>

  <p>"That's one. Secondly, there's the bloke who pulled him off Dixon, and
  whose face we saw through the hole in the ceiling. He, dear little chap, is
  very dead down below there. He's drowned."</p>

  <p>Another finger joined the first.</p>

  <p>"And short of sending down a diver his body can never be recovered. Nor
  any other body that might be down there. Do you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," said Jerningham cheerfully. "Are there any more down
  below?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;and at the same time, yes," remarked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Lucid as ever," murmured Peter Darrell. "Hasn't anybody got any beer to
  give him?"</p>

  <p>Drummond grinned gently.</p>

  <p>"It does sound a bit involved," he agreed. "But it isn't really. The
  passage we went down runs under the mere. Moreover, since the good-looking
  lady and gentleman on whom we called did not come out this way they must
  either still be below, or they got out some other. If they are below they
  also are drowned: if, on the other hand, they got out..."</p>

  <p>"Then they're not," said Algy brightly.</p>

  <p>"Sit on his head," remarked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"There were two people moving on the other side of the mere," pursued
  Drummond. "So let us assume that the passage continues under the water and
  comes out in the undergrowth opposite. Further, that those two escaped. What
  then, my brave hearts&mdash;what then? What message of fun and laughter are
  they going to give to our little Irma?"</p>

  <p>He paused triumphantly, and Algy scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Dashed if I know," he burbled.</p>

  <p>"Sit on his head," repeated Darrell morosely.</p>

  <p>"The last thing they saw of us," went on Drummond, "was when we were
  locked in that confounded room with carbon something or other pouring into
  it. And if old Toby hadn't had a brain storm that is the last that anyone
  would ever have seen of us. Do you get me now? For the purposes of this
  little affair that is the last that anyone will see of us."</p>

  <p>We sat staring at him, realizing at length what he was driving at.</p>

  <p>"But look here," said Toby doubtfully, "if we're going on with the chase
  they're bound to find out."</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Drummond. "We've disguised ourselves pretty often before.
  Peter, Ted and Algy will carry on as before: you, Dixon, and I are dead.
  Drowned, laddie, in the cold, dark waters of the mere."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! Hugh," said Darrell thoughtfully, "I believe that is a
  thundering good idea."</p>

  <p>"I'm certain it is," said Drummond. "Look here," he went on gravely,
  "we've seen enough tonight to realize that this isn't a game of kiss-in-the-
  ring. I confess that I hadn't thought that she would go to quite the lengths
  she has done. It is by a sheer piece of luck only that one or all of us are
  not dead now. Don't let there be any mistake about that. She meant to kill
  us&mdash;or some of us. And that gives us a foretaste of what is to come. If
  she has gone to these lengths in the earlier stages of the hunt, we're going
  to have the devil's own time later. Well&mdash;what's she going to say to
  herself? She knows us of old. She knows that if we three had been killed, you
  three would not give up. She'll expect you after her."</p>

  <p>Darrell nodded. "Quite right."</p>

  <p>"So we'll have the hunter hunted," went on Drummond cheerfully. "You'll be
  chasing clues: they'll be chasing you and we'll be chasing them."</p>

  <p>"There's one small flaw in your otherwise excellent scheme," I put in.
  "How are they to know that the next clue is contained in this morning's
  Times? Only we three saw her message to that effect, and we're dead."</p>

  <p>"Damn the man," said Drummond. "He's quite right."</p>

  <p>"Let's wait until we see the message," remarked Jerningham. "It may be
  obviously intended for you, in which case we should naturally spot it. Or it
  may prove necessary for us all six to cover our traces. Let's leave that for
  a bit. The thing that must be done at once is for you three to go to ground
  here somewhere, and for us three to register alarm and despondency. We'll go
  and search the grounds, and if by any chance we run into your two pals, we'll
  pretend we're looking for you. Ask them to help, or if they've seen you."</p>

  <p>"You're right. Ted," said Drummond. "Go to it. We'll lie up here."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">IX. &mdash; IN WHICH WE GET THE SECOND CLUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And so began the second phase in this strange game. I know
  that I was feeling most infernally tired and yet sleep would not come. My
  brain was too busy with the amazing happenings of the previous night. Once
  again I saw that luminous face being dragged away from me through the
  darkness, and I fell to wondering what the poor brute had really been. Was
  the woman right in what she had written? Had this hideous, demented creature
  been the sole occupant of the house for years, and thus given it its bad
  reputation? Living by day in the secret passage under the mere, and coming
  out at night if it thought intruders were about. With a shudder I glanced
  through the open door where it still lay with the stone on top of it; anyway,
  death had been quick.</p>

  <p>And then my thoughts turned to the amazing brain that had planned it all.
  What manner of woman could this be who dealt out flippant notes and death
  alternately? The labour of preparing the mechanism for dropping that heavy
  stone and then pulling it up again must have been enormous.</p>

  <p>And suddenly Drummond spoke half to himself and half to me.</p>

  <p>"She means to get us all: nab the whole bunch. She won't rest till she
  does." Then he smiled a little grimly. "And you thought it was a joke."</p>

  <p>"Guilty," I acknowledged. "You must admit though that it's a little
  unusual."</p>

  <p>He laughed shortly, and then he began to frown. "I can stand anything on
  two legs or on four," he grunted, "but these mechanical devices don't give a
  fellow a chance. And I'm uneasy about those other three. Seems to me we're
  letting them bear the brunt from now on. She'll concentrate on them."</p>

  <p>He relapsed into a moody silence, and I said nothing. There seemed to be
  nothing to say. What he feared was quite correct, or so it appeared to me.
  Only the merest luck had saved several of our lives that night, and luck
  could not be expected to continue indefinitely. Any one of us might have
  pulled that fifth bolt instead of the wretched creature who now lay dead
  underneath it. And then, had there been time to wind it up, another might
  have been bagged as well.</p>

  <p>That was the devil of it all: we weren't confronting ordinary dangers and
  risks, but specially and cunningly prepared ones. It was a case of the German
  booby-traps over again, where the most harmless-looking objects hid delay-
  action mines.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens are we going to do with that body?" said Drummond
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why not put it into the water," said Sinclair, "and then close the
  passage up?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bad idea. Stoop as you pass the window, in case those two are still
  outside."</p>

  <p>And so we lifted the stone sufficiently to extricate it, and carried it
  down the passage to the water's edge. More wreckage had appeared to join the
  chair: the place smelt and felt like a charnel-house. We toppled the poor
  brute in, and beat it for the house: anything was better than that dank
  deathtrap. And then we pushed on the sixth ring and the secret door slipped
  back into position.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord that's over," said Toby with a sigh of relief. "And all I
  can say is that I hope in future she confines her activities to the open
  air."</p>

  <p>Footsteps on the stairs made us step back hurriedly, but it proved to be
  only the other three returning.</p>

  <p>"What luck?" cried Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I think we've done the trick, old boy," said Darrell. "We ran into them
  on the other side&mdash;a woman of repulsive aspect and a man with his hand
  bound up. We were running round in small circles pretending to look for you.
  Incidentally, what you thought was right: that passage comes out near a
  broken-down old ruin on the other side. There was a rusty iron door which
  they had presumably opened. And when we saw them we told 'em the tale. Asked
  them if they'd noticed the extraordinary upheaval in the lake, and inquired
  with the utmost agitation if they'd seen three men anywhere about. Said we'd
  been ghost-hunting. I don't know if they believed us or not, but I don't see
  that it matters very much if they did. We never let on by the quiver of an
  eyelid that we suspected them."</p>

  <p>"What did they say?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"'If your friends have been ghost-hunting,' the man said, 'I fear they've
  found a very substantial one. My wife and I were out for an early morning
  stroll, when we suddenly saw the upheaval in the lake. And if you will look
  down that passage'&mdash;he pointed through the opening&mdash;' you will see
  the water. I fear that your friends must have inadvertently found a most
  dangerous piece of mechanism, which I have heard of often but never believed
  to be really existent. Nothing more nor less, in fact, than a diabolical
  arrangement for flooding the whole of this underwater passage which comes out
  into the house on the other side. Doubtless you found the opening there.'</p>

  <p>"We did," I said, registering horror and despondency.</p>

  <p>"'Then if your friends have not come out that end, I very much fear they
  must all be drowned. For they certainly haven't come out this.'</p>

  <p>"'How dreadful!' said the woman, and Algy made hoarse noises presumably
  meant to indicate grief."</p>

  <p>"They were damned good," said Algy plaintively.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, you sounded like a cow with an alcoholic stomach cough,"
  said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"But what happened finally?" demanded Drummond.</p>

  <p>"They drifted off, and it seemed to us they were still on the lookout for
  something. And then it suddenly struck us what it was. It's the other bloke:
  the one who is drowned down below. So we sprinted back here in order to
  prevent them coming at any rate yet. As there seem to be only the two
  openings they're almost bound to come and examine this end as soon as we are
  gone. And it was going to mess things up a bit if they found all you three
  here. So what I suggest is this. You three must go to ground in real earnest
  somewhere. And you must wait until we give you the all clear&mdash;in a day
  or two or perhaps a week."</p>

  <p>"Go to blazes," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"We in the meanwhile will go and drown our sorrows in beer, and later on
  we'll bring you the corks to smell. We'll also get a copy of The Times, and
  then will come the problem of smuggling you out of this house unseen. We'll
  have to discuss that later."</p>

  <p>"Right you are, Peter," said Drummond. "You've about hit it. Incidentally,
  where shall we go to ground?"</p>

  <p>He glanced round, and finally stared at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"That seems to me to be the best spot," he remarked thoughtfully. "We know
  it can be inhabited because that bird was up there. And if those two come we
  might be able to hear something. Only how the deuce do we get up there? A
  chair on the top of the table and I might reach."</p>

  <p>He could&mdash;just&mdash;and in an instant he had swung himself through
  the hole and disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," His face reappeared through the hole. "Plenty of room for all
  three of us. Come along, Dixon&mdash;I'll pull you up."</p>

  <p>He got me by the wrists, and heaved me up beside him as easily as I would
  lift a child. And then Toby Sinclair followed.</p>

  <p>"Take away the chair and the table, Peter," he said. "And for the love of
  Allah bring back a dozen with you in your pockets. My mouth is like an
  asbestos washer."</p>

  <p>"We'll come back, old boy, as soon as we possibly can," said Darrell.
  "I'll drive your car and take Dixon's bicycle. And we shall say that you have
  been suddenly summoned to London for failing to pay the poor girl her weekly
  postal order if any questions are asked."</p>

  <p>"Say what you like," said Drummond resignedly. "But bring me beer."</p>

  <p>And so commenced a weary vigil. A passage, evidently communicating with
  the rest of the network, led out of our hiding-place, but there was no longer
  any incentive to explore. All we could do was to sit and wait until the
  others came back and told us the coast was clear. And that might not be for
  hours. In fact it seemed to me that anyway it would be unsafe to go before
  night if we were to succeed in getting away unseen. Which left us with the
  joyful prospect of spending fourteen or fifteen hours in the most acute
  discomfort.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Drummond sat up and put a finger to his lips. I had heard nothing
  myself, but as I had already discovered all his senses seemed twice as keenly
  developed as my own. And after a while I too heard a creak on the stairs
  outside, and then another.</p>

  <p>"Not a sound," he breathed. "But if they find us we've got to sock 'em.
  Keep back from the opening or they may see us."</p>

  <p>We drew back so that we could only just see the doorway, and waited. There
  was someone coming along the passage now, and a moment or two later our
  friend of the damaged hand put his head cautiously round the corner. Then he
  spoke to someone behind him.</p>

  <p>"All right," he called out. "Come on."</p>

  <p>The woman joined him.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" she said peevishly. "You're not going to find him
  here."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," he snarled. "If Jim was in the passage when the door gave
  with the water he may have escaped up this end and be waiting inside."</p>

  <p>He tugged on the sixth ring, and the secret door swung open once more.
  Then he disappeared down the passage while the woman leaned against the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Not a sign." He came back into the room and closed the door. "But those
  three guys have bunged that madman's body into the water."</p>

  <p>He stood in the centre of the room gnawing his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how much they knew," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter what they knew," said the woman. "Let's get out of
  this&mdash;I'm fed up."</p>

  <p>"You'll get a clip under the jaw in a minute," he remarked. "We're getting
  a couple of hundred of the best for this job, and you ain't likely ever to
  earn a couple of hundred pence with a face like yours."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it you want to know?" cried the woman irritably.</p>

  <p>"Whether those other three guys&mdash;the ones that came down to
  us&mdash;are really below there."</p>

  <p>"Heaven save the man, where else can they be?" She stamped her foot. "You
  got 'em in the room, didn't you? And you locked 'em in the room, didn't you?
  And you turned on the gas, didn't you? And they were still in the room twenty
  minutes after. Where else can they be now?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have seen 'em," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Well, since you ain't a ruddy fish, you can't," she remarked. "I'm going.
  I want some sleep."</p>

  <p>She paused in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Come on. Bill," she said in a milder voice. "It's clear enough what
  happened. When Jim pulled the lever he didn't get out quick enough. He got
  caught by the water, poor old stiff&mdash;and he's down there himself now.
  And so are the other three."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," he answered. "We'll push off."</p>

  <p>And then he glanced up towards the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"What about putting that stone back?"</p>

  <p>"Leave it," said the woman. "If anyone gets into trouble it's going to be
  those three who were fooling around outside. Nobody knows we've been here,
  and nobody ever will if you'll only get a move on instead of standing there
  like a dummy. Besides, you ought to have that hand of yours looked at."</p>

  <p>"Blast that big fellow," said the man venomously. "I'd give something to
  have a once over with him."</p>

  <p>The woman laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"You would," she said. "From what I saw of him you'd give up every hope of
  ever being recognized again. He'd eat you&mdash;with one hand. Come
  on&mdash;or I'll fall asleep where I stand. The telegraph office won't be
  open till nine, and there's nothing to be done till then. You've got her
  address, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've got the usual one," he answered, following her from the room.</p>

  <p>Their voices died away as they went along the passage, and I thought the
  unfortunate Drummond was going to have an apoplectic fit. "Just as we were
  getting something useful," he groaned. "An address. The address."</p>

  <p>"Probably only an accommodation one," said Toby sleepily. "Wake me if I
  snore, chaps, but I must have a bit of shut eye."</p>

  <p>And still sleep would not come to me. I got into every conceivable
  position I could think of: I counted innumerable sheep going through a gate:
  but at the end of an hour I was wider awake than ever. The other two were
  peacefully unconscious, and at last I gave up trying. It was as well, in any
  case, that one of us should remain on guard, and so I settled myself as
  comfortably as I could and waited for the time to pass. From below came the
  occasional crack of a board as the sun's warmth began to penetrate into the
  house, but except for that no sound broke the silence. Seven o'clock
  came&mdash;eight: in my imagination I could smell the smell of hot coffee and
  bacon and eggs. I could see racks of toast and marmalade disappearing down
  the throats of the other three thugs at the Angler's Rest. And I wondered why
  Heaven was treating me so. To the best of my belief I was no worse than other
  men. Within reasonable limits I had paid my just whack of Income Tax: I had,
  only recently, registered enjoyment over the acidulated beverage which my
  Aunt Jane fondly imagined to be port. And as a reward I found myself sitting
  in an attic, several inches of dust and a bad smell on a beautiful summer's
  morning. Moreover when I gazed into the vista of the future all I could see
  was myself disguised as a German tourist or the hind legs of a cow having fun
  and games in even more damnable spots than the one in which I was at present.
  Emphatically not what the doctor had ordered....</p>

  <p>I shifted my position so as to distribute the cramp more evenly throughout
  my anatomy, and in doing so I saw into the room below. Just the same except
  that the shadow thrown by the open door had moved as the sun got higher. A
  simple little problem in trigonometry, I reflected. If the door was eight
  feet high and the shadow was nine feet long what was the height of the sun
  above the horizon? Door over shadow was tangent of the angle. Or was it
  cosine? Anyway one would want a book of logarithms.... One would want...</p>

  <p>My tongue grew suddenly dry. The height of the sun above the horizon had
  nothing to do with the sudden eddy of dust that swirled up in the passage
  outside. Nor had it anything to do with another shadow that had just
  appeared&mdash;the shadow of a human being. Someone was outside: someone whom
  I could not see&mdash;yet.</p>

  <p>I glanced round at the other two. They were six or seven feet away: to
  wake them up would cause noise. Moreover they were sleeping silently, so it
  was best to leave them as they were.</p>

  <p>Once more I turned back to the room: the shadow had materialized. Standing
  in the doorway was a woman&mdash;one of the most beautiful women I have ever
  seen in my life. I put her age at about thirty, though it may have been two
  or three years more. She was, as far as my masculine eye could judge,
  perfectly dressed&mdash;but it was her face, or rather her expression, that
  held me spellbound. There was contempt in it, and hatred&mdash;and yet,
  mingled with them, a sort of pity and regret. Once her eyes travelled to the
  bolts in the wall, and she smiled&mdash;a lazy, almost Oriental smile. And
  then she did an extraordinary thing. Still standing motionless she glanced
  upwards. Not at me, not at the hole in the ceiling, but as a woman looks up
  in prayer. The whole expression of her face had changed: there was in it now
  a wonderful triumph. Her eyes were half-closed: her whole body seemed to
  relax into utter surrender. And suddenly she spoke:</p>

  <p>"I would have kept him till last, my loved one&mdash;but it was not to be.
  But there are still the other three&mdash;and her. After, I will come to
  you."</p>

  <p>And then it seemed to me that she took in her arms a head I could not
  see&mdash;and kissed lips that to her were real. Lingeringly, passionately as
  a woman kisses her lover. Gradually her arms fell to her side, and for a
  while she stood with her face transfigured and her eyes closed. Then she drew
  herself up: the vision had vanished. She gave one more glance round the room
  and was gone, leaving no trace of her visit save a faint, elusive scent.
  Jasmine, and yet not quite jasmine&mdash;something I had never smelt before,
  something I could never mistake in the future. Something unique, something in
  keeping with the woman herself. For she had seemed to me in that moment of
  self-revelation, when she spoke to the unseen, to be of the type for whom men
  will sacrifice their honour and even their lives.</p>

  <p>Stiffly, like a man waking from a dream, I moved over to Drummond and
  shook him by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he said, instantly awake.</p>

  <p>"Your friend Irma has been here," I answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"What!" he almost shouted. "Then why in hell..."</p>

  <p>He was standing up in his excitement, but with an effort he pulled himself
  together. "How do you know it was her? Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>He listened in perfect silence whilst I told him what I had seen.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't wake you without making a noise," I said when I had finished.
  "And I don't know," I added candidly, "that I could have wakened you anyway.
  I watched that woman almost as if I had been in a trance. But one thing is
  certain&mdash;she thinks you are dead. Another thing is certain&mdash;she is
  going for the other three. And your wife. And then she will commit
  suicide."</p>

  <p>"You think she's mad," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think that she's mad. I think she's more dangerous even than
  that. She's a woman with an obsession&mdash;a mission in life. That man she
  spoke to was real to her&mdash;as real as you are to me. He is still her
  lover though he is dead. And her mission is to revenge his death. She's got
  foreign blood in her, and if I wanted any more proof than I have had already
  as to the seriousness of this show I've got it now. This is a
  vendetta&mdash;and only your deaths will finish it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's as well he didn't wake you up, Hugh," said Toby
  thoughtfully. "You can bet she's covered her traces pretty effectually, and
  what could you have done if you had caught her? It wouldn't have helped you
  to find Phyllis. In addition you'd have given away the fact that you're not
  dead."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," agreed Drummond at length. "But, by Jove! I'd like to
  have seen her. You'd recognize her again, Dixon?"</p>

  <p>"In a million," I said. "And I'd recognize that scent."</p>

  <p>"Which is less likely to change than her appearance," he remarked shortly.
  And then he frowned suddenly. "You're quite certain, aren't you, that it was
  genuine&mdash;this performance of hers? I mean you don't think that she knew
  we were here and did it to bluff us."</p>

  <p>"If that show wasn't genuine," I said, "she is the most marvellous actress
  the world has ever seen. No: I'm certain it was pukka."</p>

  <p>He grunted thoughtfully and sat down again. "Perhaps so," he said after a
  while.</p>

  <p>"Besides," I went on, "what could be her object in doing it if she knew we
  were here?"</p>

  <p>"When you know the lady as well as I do," he answered, "you'll realize
  that she doesn't conform to ordinary rules."</p>

  <p>He relapsed into silence, his chin sunk on his chest, and for the first
  time the full realization of what we were engaged in came to me. Before, this
  woman had been a legendary figure, a writer of would-be flippant letters, a
  maker of skilfully devised deathtraps. Dangerous certainly&mdash;more than
  dangerous&mdash;but with at any rate some idea of making a sporting game of
  it. I had believed that if we did pull through, if we did follow the clues
  successfully, she intended to play the game and restore Drummond's wife to
  him. And I had believed that she proposed to give us a sporting chance of so
  doing. Now I believed it no longer.</p>

  <p>However much Drummond might doubt it I knew that what I had seen was
  genuine. The woman had ceased to be a legend and had become a reality&mdash;a
  reality ten times more dangerous than any legend. Gone was any hope of a
  sporting chance: she meant and always had meant to kill the lot of us. What
  strange jink in her brain had made her decide on this particular method of
  doing so was beside the point&mdash;probably the same jink that makes a cat
  play with a mouse before finishing it off. The cruelty that lies latent in
  the female. And she was gratifying that whilst pursuing her inexorable
  purpose. Letting us think we were playing a game, whilst all the time she had
  no intention of playing herself. Letting us think we had a chance of success,
  whilst all the time we had none.</p>

  <p>For what chance had we? True by the most marvellous fluke we had escaped
  the night before&mdash;but flukes cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or
  later she would have us, as she had always meant to have us. And the cellar
  below showed exactly the amount of mercy we should receive.</p>

  <p>What chance had Drummond against such an antagonist? I glanced at him,
  sunk in thought, his great fists clenched by his side. Let him get his hands
  on anything on two legs&mdash;well and good. God help the thing! But this
  wasn't a question of brute strength: this was a question of cunning and
  brain. This wasn't man to man: this was a human being against mechanical
  traps. Strength was of no avail against poison gas and specially prepared
  devices.</p>

  <p>I wondered if he was even now thinking out some plan of-campaign. To meet
  guile with guile was our only hope, and somehow he didn't strike me as being
  the right man for that. Something to hit hard and often and he won in a
  canter: but first find the thing to hit. "Gosh! I hope they've brought the
  beer."</p>

  <p>I sighed a little wearily: such was our leader's mentality. "Doubtless
  they will when they come," I assured him.</p>

  <p>"When they come!" he grunted. "You wouldn't hear a howitzer going off in
  the next room, laddie. They have come. That flat-footed blighter Algy has
  fallen over his own feet twice already. Cultivate the old ears, Dixon: in the
  dark they're worth more to you than your eyes."</p>

  <p>"Damn the man," I reflected, but a suitable reply eluded me. For I could
  hear absolutely nothing even then. "I wonder if they butted into little
  Pansy?" He got up and yawned prodigiously, and as he did so I heard cautious
  footsteps coming along the passage. The next moment Peter Darrell appeared in
  the door followed by the other two. "All right, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Thirsty, Peter&mdash;darned thirsty. Where's the ale?" He lowered himself
  though the hole and dropped to the floor.</p>

  <p>"We've got a dozen, old boy. Is that enough?"</p>

  <p>"Do you drink beer, Dixon?" asked Drummond, looking up.</p>

  <p>"Not usually at this hour of the morning," I answered. "Thank God for
  that," he said in a relieved voice. "It's a most deplorable habit, and I'm
  glad you don't suffer from it. Incidentally, chaps, you haven't run into Irma
  by any chance, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Well I'm damned!" Jerningham glanced at Darrell. "Why do you ask,
  Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Because according to Dixon the poppet has been here, holding spiritual
  converse with our late lamented Carl. Of course he doesn't know the darling
  by sight, and Toby and I were both asleep. But from his account of the
  interview it must have been her." He paused with his glass half way to his
  mouth. "Have you seen her?"</p>

  <p>"As we were leaving the village, old boy," said Jerningham, "a closed car,
  going fast, met us. And as we passed it a woman looked out of the window.
  Peter was driving, and Algy was in his usual condition of comatose
  imbecility, so it was only I who saw her. I just got a fleeting glimpse, but
  I thought it was Irma myself. I wasn't sure; but from what you say it must
  have been. I tried to get the number of the car, but the road is dusty and I
  couldn't see it. And then just as I was telling Peter, we went and punctured.
  Otherwise we could have followed. What did she come here for?"</p>

  <p>"To gloat over my corpse, Ted, and to assure Carl that you three weren't
  forgotten," said Drummond. "She's out for the lot of us."</p>

  <p>"Bless her little heart," remarked Peter. "But she'll have to be a bit
  more explicit as far as I'm concerned."</p>

  <p>He produced a copy of The Times from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Here's the invitation to the party: but Allah alone knows what it
  means."</p>

  <p>He pointed to two verses in the Personal Column. They were headed&mdash;To
  dear Hugh.</p>

  <p>A lily with the plural put before. A thing of beauty, but in this case,
  more Like the fair lady whom you met last night. When found, at any rate,
  you'll start quite right. Dipped in the river Styx one part alone stayed dry.
  Leave out the next, but take the cry Of every schoolboy. That should give a
  man. And now, you poor fish, find it if you can.</p>

  <p>"Does anyone know the story of the girl who went to a fancy dress ball
  dressed as a lily," said Algy hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Sit on his head," groaned Peter. "What the hell does it mean?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; IN WHICH THE THIRD CLUE IS SOLVED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I have said earlier that this is my first essay in writing,
  but I should imagine that one of the rules must be to refrain as far as
  possible from boring the misguided optimists who are endeavouring to wade
  through the completed effort. And, therefore, I will refrain from giving any
  description of the rest of that day. It had been unanimously decided that it
  would be unsafe for Drummond, Sinclair and me to leave before nightfall if we
  were to avoid any risk of being spotted. And so beyond mentioning that the
  beer expired shortly after midday, that Toby Sinclair revoked twice at bridge
  and was soundly beaten by Drummond for his pains, and that I got an acute
  attack of the hiccoughs due to ale on an empty stomach, I will draw a veil
  over our doings. Quiet reigned on the Western Front, broken only by the
  curses of the particular individual who was, at the moment, wrestling with
  the doggerel in The Times.</p>

  <p>Drummond from the outset gave it up. With a graceful movement of the hand
  he waved it from him, as a child might wave a plate of prunes and semolina
  pudding, Algy Longworth having at last got his story about the lily off his
  chest was found guilty of telling the world's hoariest chestnut, and having
  been thrown into the passage refused to play any more. So it was left to the
  rest of us to try and solve it. And honesty compels me to admit that we
  failed&mdash;utterly. It seemed completely meaningless.</p>

  <p>'A lily with the plural put before.'</p>

  <p>That seemed to give Slily. Toby Sinclair insisted that there was a loch of
  that name somewhere in the Hebrides, but on being pressed was not quite sure
  it wasn't an island off the coast of Cork. And that was about as far as we
  got. Except for Achilles: I got that.</p>

  <p>'Dipped in the river Styx one part alone stayed dry.'</p>

  <p>That seemed to point to the Achilles Statue, an unsuitable spot, as
  Drummond pointed out moodily, for erecting a booby-trap. And we were all
  somewhat moody when we left at ten that night for his house in London.
  Concealment was necessary and personally I was hidden under a rug at the back
  of the first car. Before that I had always felt a certain contempt for
  individuals who endeavour to evade paying for a railway ticket by travelling
  under the seat. Now I regard them with nothing short of admiration. To walk
  is a far, far better thing.</p>

  <p>But we arrived at length, and having got Algy Longworth's shoe out of my
  mouth we crept through two dustbins to the back door. It was a risk coming to
  his house at all but it had to be run, since all his props for makeup were
  there. And after a short pause the door was opened by a manservant, who
  evinced not the slightest surprise at the sight of the procession.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen any one loitering about the house, Denny?" said Drummond as
  the door closed behind us.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. But a man called this afternoon and asked for you."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man?"</p>

  <p>"A stranger, sir. And I am inclined to think, not an Englishman."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"The truth, sir. I said you were away from home."</p>

  <p>Drummond looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Peter&mdash;we've got to try and ride them off. I'm tolerably
  certain we weren't spotted coming in here, but it looks as if they were
  watching the front. Go with Ted and drive up openly to the house. Ring the
  bell. When Denny comes&mdash;tell him the news in a voice broken with grief.
  Tell him I'm dead. Tell him twice if you think the blighter outside hasn't
  heard. Denny&mdash;you will clutch the door, turn pale with anguish and sob
  out&mdash;' No man had ever a better master.' And for God's sake don't
  breathe port all over the street. After that, Peter, you three go off to your
  rooms and wait for further orders. Somehow or other we've got to solve this
  confounded thing."</p>

  <p>"Right-ho, old boy, I'll pitch Denny the tale. And then we'll wait to hear
  further from you."</p>

  <p>And it was while we were waiting for them to come that I had an idea. Old
  Tom Jenkinson. If any man in London could solve it he could. A former
  schoolmaster of mine now retired, and a member of my club. He still appeared
  to regard me as a dirty and inkstained schoolboy. But over acrostics, riddles
  or crosswords he was a perfect genius. I said as much to Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," he remarked. "Is he likely to be at the club now?"</p>

  <p>"Never leaves it before midnight."</p>

  <p>"Then go and scribble a line to him, old boy, explaining what we
  want&mdash;and I'll send it round by Denny. You'll find paper in that room up
  there, but see that the curtains are pulled tight before you switch on the
  light."</p>

  <p><i>Dear Mr Jenkinson,</i> (I wrote)</p>

  <p><i>I would be deeply obliged to you if you would send me the solution of
  the enclosed rhyme. It represents a town or locality or place of some sort,
  presumably in the British Isles. It is a matter of urgent importance that I
  should get the answer as soon as possible. Knowing you I feel sure that you
  can solve it at once, and the bearer of this note will wait for a reply. I
  hope Mrs Jenkinson is in the best of health.</i></p>

  <p><i>Yours sincerely,</i></p>

  <p><i>JOE DIXON</i></p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Drummond. "Peter has been, and according to Denny there
  was a man loitering by the railings who overheard what was said. Moreover,
  he's gone now, so it may have done some good. Anyway we'll send Denny round
  with that note at once."</p>

  <p>"Go out by the back door," he said as his servant came in, "and take this
  to the Junior Reform. Wait for an answer. And don't forget&mdash;if anyone
  asks you&mdash;I'm dead."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said the man impassively. "There is a new cask, sir,
  behind the door."</p>

  <p>"A good fellow," remarked Drummond. "And improved considerably since the
  death of his wife. She was a muscular woman and a martyr to indigestion, and
  the result left much to be desired."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and began pacing up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"Lord! but I hope this old buster of yours solves it," he said once or
  twice.</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't, it's insolvable," I assured him. "But there's just a
  chance, of course, that he may not be in London."</p>

  <p>And the instant I'd said it I regretted having spoken. His face fell, and
  he stared at me blankly.</p>

  <p>"If so," I hastened to add, "we can always get him through, the club.
  Letters will be forwarded."</p>

  <p>"But it means delay," he muttered. "More hanging about."</p>

  <p>An hour passed, and two, and suddenly he lifted his head listening.</p>

  <p>"Denny's back," he said. "Now we shall know."</p>

  <p>His voice was quiet, but there was a strained look in his eyes as he
  watched the door. Should we have the answer, or did it mean further waiting?
  And mercifully it was the former, his servant had brought an answer. I opened
  it, and the others listened breathlessly.</p>

  <p>'Dear Dixon, (it ran)</p>

  <p>'Before giving you the solution of your ridiculous little problem there
  are one or two points to which I would draw your attention. In days gone by,
  when you went, if memory serves me aright, by the name of Stinkhound, I
  endeavoured, for my sins, to teach you the rudiments of English composition.
  Why then do you offend my eyes, and give me further proof, if such were
  needed, of my complete failure, by using the word 'would' twice in the first
  sentence. 'I should be,' not 'I would be,' is the correct opening to your
  ill-written missive. Again, if the matter is of urgent importance, obviously
  you require the answer as soon as possible&mdash;a clear case of tautology.
  Lastly, your interest in Mrs Jenkinson's health, though doubtless well meant,
  is a little tardy. She died some five years ago.</p>

  <p>'However&mdash;to your problem. My opinion of your intellect was always
  microscopic: even so, it is incredible that any one out of an asylum could
  have failed to solve it at sight&mdash;knowing that it was meant to represent
  a place. Let us take the first stanza. Clearly the last line has nothing to
  do with it: it is put in to cheer you on when you have interpreted the other
  three. Now, of course, I do not know the nature of the lady you met last
  night: your repellent habits are, I am glad to say, a closed book to me. But
  in this case she was obviously not a thing of beauty. Ergo&mdash;she was ugly
  or plain. But few places contain the letters UGLY: whereas there are many
  Plains in the British Isles. One in particular leaps to the
  mind&mdash;Salisbury Plain.</p>

  <p>'You may at this point ask what relation Salisbury has to a lily with the
  plural put before. Knowing your abysmal ignorance of everything remotely
  approaching to culture you probably will. The ancient name for Salisbury, my
  dear Dixon, was Sarum. To this day you will see the word written on many of
  the milestones around the town. Well, I suppose even you have heard of an
  Arum Lily. And therefore the first stanza is solved and gives
  us&mdash;Salisbury Plain, a large area&mdash;comprising as it does a
  considerable portion of the County of Wiltshire.</p>

  <p>'The second stanza is clearly designed to narrow our field. It
  does&mdash;to a remarkable degree. The first line could, of course, be solved
  by a child of six. But as Ruff's Guide to the Turf is doubtless more familiar
  to you than Homer's Iliad I shall assume that your mind has not even reached
  that infantile standard. Achilles was the son of Peleus by Thetis, one of the
  Nereids. And ancient mythology tells us that to make him invulnerable she
  dipped him in the Styx, holding him by the heel. Hence the phrase, the heel
  of Achilles which was the only part that remained dry. The first line
  therefore gives us Heel.</p>

  <p>'The cry of every schoolboy.'</p>

  <p>'What the repulsive little horrors call it now I do not know&mdash;but
  when you were one of them, what word rose most often to your lips? What was
  your moan&mdash;your everlasting bleat? Tuck. You gorged your bellies on
  tuck, and slept, as a result, in school&mdash;making disgusting noises. Tuck,
  Stinkhound&mdash;tuck.</p>

  <p>'That should give a man.'</p>

  <p>'Have you never read 'Ivanhoe'? Have you never heard of Robin Hood, and
  the fat and jovial Friar Tuck, his constant companion and father
  confessor?</p>

  <p>'And so we have Heel, Tuck and Friar. A glance at the verse will show us
  that Tuck is to be left out&mdash;and that reduces us to Heel and Friar.</p>

  <p>'On Salisbury Plain is an ancient Druidical temple known as Stonehenge.
  Outside the main circle is a great stone&mdash;the sun-stone. This is the
  point where a spectator, centrally placed within the temple, would see the
  sun rise on Midsummer Day. And the common name for the sun-stone is the
  Friar's Heel.</p>

  <p>'Wherefore, the solution of your childish effusion is the monolith known
  as the Friar's Heel at Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain. And in conclusion I can
  only endorse most wholeheartedly the terse and apt description of you given
  in the middle of the last line.</p>

  <p>'Faithfully yours,</p>

  <p>'THOMAS JENKINSON.</p>

  <p>'PS&mdash;I have often wanted to know one thing. Were you or were you not
  the miserable little boy who first nicknamed me Wart Hog and the late Mrs
  Jenkinson Slab Face? A nickname&mdash;like a caricature&mdash;should bear
  some relation to the truth, Dixon, if it is to be considered clever. And to
  call me a Wart Hog is positively stupid.'</p>

  <p>"I got Achilles at any rate, confound the old ass," I remarked, as I put
  the letter down. "Well&mdash;there you are. Now we know."</p>

  <p>"Stonehenge," said Drummond. "Close to Amesbury."</p>

  <p>"With cantonments all round it," put in Toby Sinclair. "I motored past it
  last summer."</p>

  <p>"How far away?" Drummond looked at him thoughtfully. "I haven't been there
  since I was a kid, and there was nothing built then."</p>

  <p>"I suppose about a mile to the nearest," said Sinclair. "Perhaps less. And
  there's another thing, too. By day there are hordes of trippers all over the
  place&mdash;guides and all that sort of stunt. You've got to pay to go
  in."</p>

  <p>"So nothing can happen by day. And by night&mdash;with troops as close as
  that&mdash;they will have to be careful."</p>

  <p>He went to the telephone, and gave a number.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he said as soon as he got through, "come round at once&mdash;all
  of you. Back door, as before."</p>

  <p>He sat down and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what is the best rig for you," he pondered. "In a way, you're
  the least important as only the man and the woman of last night know
  you."</p>

  <p>"And our venerable friend of the Angler's Rest," I reminded him.</p>

  <p>"True. I'd forgotten him. Still a moustache, a pair of spectacles and the
  earnest air of a tourist should meet the case. And if you see any of those
  three, efface yourself. Toby&mdash;I've got a very good line in elderly
  professors for you. Butterflies, I think. You can gambol lightly over
  Salisbury Plain making a noise like a killing-bottle."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, dear old boy," said Sinclair. "What are you going to be?"</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen," answered Drummond with an enigmatic smile.
  "I've got two or three half formed ideas."</p>

  <p>The smile faded slowly from his face.</p>

  <p>"But whatever it is, I'm thinking that the sooner we begin to put the fear
  of God into this bunch the better."</p>

  <p>And I realized suddenly how he had earned the sobriquet of Bulldog.</p>

  <p>A minute or so later Peter Darrell and the other two came in.</p>

  <p>"You've solved it?" asked Jerningham eagerly.</p>

  <p>"A pal of Dixon's has," said Drummond. "A stone called the Friar's Heel at
  Stonehenge. You can read the letter later."</p>

  <p>"And you can read this one now," said Darrell. "Delivered by hand."</p>

  <p>It consisted of one line.</p>

  <p>'Read today's Times. Personal column.'</p>

  <p>"So she really does think we're dead, Peter." Drummond rubbed his hands
  together. "Excellent. However, let's get down to it. In the first place, from
  now on you three have got to run this show alone. Officially, that's to say.
  And, dash it all, I don't like it."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out, you ass," laughed Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"It's all very fine and large, Ted&mdash;but they mean business. And I
  don't want any casualties. I believe that what Dixon said is absolutely
  right. Whether she is insane or not is beside the point: there's not much
  sign of insanity about her plans up to date. But from what he heard her say
  this morning we are all for it, and Phyllis as well, before she goes to join
  Peterson. She was never remarkable, was she, for the quality of mercy. And
  now that she's obsessed with this idea, she will be utterly merciless. It's
  revenge run mad. So for the love of Heaven be careful. I'd never forgive
  myself if one of you took it in the neck."</p>

  <p>"We'll be careful all right, old boy," said Darrell quietly. "But Phyllis
  has got to be found, hasn't she?"</p>

  <p>"I know that. But I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better for you three to
  chuck it and leave it to me."</p>

  <p>"We have but little desire for a rough house," said Jerningham, "but
  there's going to be one in a moment unless you cease talking tripe."</p>

  <p>"Well, well; so be it," grinned Drummond. "But I thought I'd just mention
  it. So as I said before&mdash;let's get down to it. From what Toby says, the
  place is stiff with people all the day. So by day there can't be any risk.
  Now, it's possible that all we are going to get there is another
  clue&mdash;in fact, it's probable. I really don't see how they can rig up
  anything in a public place like that which can be dangerous&mdash;even at
  night. And so as I see it&mdash;there's just one thing to fear, and that can
  only happen at night."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Common or garden murder, Peter," said Drummond gravely. "There may be a
  clue; on the other hand, it may be a trap."</p>

  <p>"Murder," I said doubtfully. "In a place like that."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Drummond coolly. "What leads in nine cases out of ten to
  the discovery of a murder? Motive. And what possible known motive is there
  for killing any of them. We know the motive: who else does? If we told this
  story to the police we'd be laughed out of court."</p>

  <p>"And Phyllis would pay the price," said Jerningham gravely.</p>

  <p>"We know they are utterly unscrupulous: we know that they intend to kill
  them. What more likely than that they'll have a dip at it at the Friar's
  Heel. And that is a thing I do not propose to risk unless it is absolutely
  essential. No, Peter, my mind is made up, old boy&mdash;so there's no use
  your looking like that. I promise you that when it is necessary, I'll send
  for you."</p>

  <p>"What is your suggestion, Hugh?" said Jerningham after a whale.</p>

  <p>"This, Ted. From what Dixon overheard Irma say, this little show will not
  be concluded until they've got you&mdash;all three. I may be wrong, but I
  don't think they will try for you in London: in her own distorted way she is
  going to play this game through to the end in the way she intended. And,
  therefore, nothing further will take place until you come to the Friar's
  Heel. Now my proposal is this. But for this freak pal of Dixon's, Heaven
  alone knows when we should have solved that last clue. So there will be
  nothing surprising about it if you take at least a couple of days over
  finding the answer. And during those two days&mdash;or until I wire for
  you&mdash;you will remain in London, ready to leave the instant you hear from
  me."</p>

  <p>"And you three?" asked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"We'll go down in disguise and spy out the land. Maybe we shall find
  nothing; maybe the clue, if there is one at the Friar's Heel, will only be
  given to one of you. If so, I'll wire you. But it's possible that we shall
  find the clue, and get a short cut to what we want."</p>

  <p>"I don't like it, Hugh," said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"Ted, old boy, it's best from every point of view. I don't want one of you
  killed&mdash;or the lot. And, my dear old lad, they mean business. Supposing
  you were all killed, from another point of view altogether&mdash;where should
  we be? Ignorant of where Phyllis is, with the game over as far as they are
  concerned. The whole bunch of us wiped out. The only person left then to
  finish off is Phyllis. There are such things as silencers for guns, laddie,
  as we know only too well. No, no: it's absolutely obvious. We'll go first and
  see what we can find out. If we find out nothing&mdash;then you come in. If,
  on the contrary, we get on their tracks&mdash;then you still come in, but in
  a far sounder strategical position than if you went down now. Because when
  you arrive they will think the Friar's Heel is your objective, whereas in
  reality it won't be. They will lie up for you there, and you will
  short-circuit them."</p>

  <p>"He's right, Ted; perfectly right," said Darrell unwillingly. "I wish he
  wasn't; but he is."</p>

  <p>"So I shall rig up Toby and Dixon tomorrow, and they will go to some pub
  in Amesbury."</p>

  <p>"What's your own game, Hugh," said Algy.</p>

  <p>"That, old boy, you will know in due course. For the time being I think
  it's best that none of you should know. It's going to be touch and
  go&mdash;this show&mdash;and I'd sooner have an absolutely free hand. And
  finally, don't forget the old Froth Blower's dirge. Twice for danger."</p>

  <p>"Froth Blower's?" I asked. "Is that the thing I've heard you singing?"</p>

  <p>"Laddie," laughed Drummond, "you can't be real. When peace comes your
  education shall be taken in hand. Now is all clear?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Then a long night in, chaps. We'll want all we can get in the sleep line.
  And one other thing. If you want to get me, drop a line to John Bright at the
  Post Office, Amesbury."</p>

  <p>They went casually with a nod and a grin&mdash;did the other three;
  demonstrativeness was not a characteristic of this crowd. But when they'd
  gone, Drummond sat for some time staring in front of him with his beer
  untasted on the table at his side. And at last he rose with a grunt. "Come
  on; bed. I hope to Heaven they'll be all right in London."</p>

  <p>He showed me to my room, where a pair of his pyjamas had been laid
  out.</p>

  <p>"Hope they won't be too small," he said with a grin. Then he paused by the
  door. "Deuced good of you and all that, Dixon, to mix yourself up in this
  show. Though, 'pon my soul, I don't know what we'd have done without
  you."</p>

  <p>And, astounding though it may seem, I can recall no remark made to me in
  my life that has occasioned me greater pleasure. Whether it had anything to
  do with it, I don't know, but certain it is that no sooner had my head
  touched the pillow than I was asleep. And the next thing I knew was his
  servant shaking me by the shoulder the next morning.</p>

  <p>"Nine o'clock, sir," he said. "And the Captain would like you to come
  along to the music-room as soon as you've had your bath."</p>

  <p>The music-room appeared to be so-called because there was no trace of any
  musical instrument in it. It resembled nothing so much as an old clothes
  shop. Suits of all sorts and descriptions littered the floor; wigs, false
  hair and the usual makeup appliances were on the table. Drummond was standing
  in the middle with two complete strangers by him. One of them was obviously
  of the hairdresser type; the other was an elderly man of scholastic
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Dixon," said Drummond. "Now, Albert, there you are. What are we
  to do with him? A minimum on his face, because he's not used to it."</p>

  <p>The hairdresser man eyed me critically.</p>

  <p>"I thought a moustache," went on Drummond. "And glasses. For Mr Seymour.
  Don't forget, Dixon&mdash;Fred Seymour."</p>

  <p>"Can't we dispense with the moustache?" I said. "It's certain to fall off
  at the wrong moment."</p>

  <p>"Not as I shall fix it, sir," said the hairdresser in a pained voice.
  "Will you kindly take a seat here?"</p>

  <p>"Who is the old bloke?" I whispered to Drummond as I passed him.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he cried, "excuse me. I quite forgot. This is a very old
  friend of mine&mdash;Professor Stanton&mdash;Mr Dixon. He's come to give Toby
  some advice on butterflies."</p>

  <p>"A fascinating hobby, Mr Dixon," remarked the Professor, and I stared at
  him in amazement. Surely I knew that voice.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott," I muttered. "It's you, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>They all laughed.</p>

  <p>"What an amazing disguise," I cried. "But for your voice I'd never have
  known you."</p>

  <p>"And under the ministrations of the excellent Albert the result will be
  the same in your case," remarked Drummond. "The whole essence of disguise,
  Dixon, is to make it as simple as possible, and therefore as
  unnoticeable."</p>

  <p>He was watching Albert's efforts as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Most people are extraordinarily unobservant," he went on. "If you wear
  different clothes to usual, alter your walk a little, and put on a pair of
  dark spectacles, you'll pass nine people out of ten that you know in the
  street without being recognized. Whereas if you wear a large red nose and
  fungus all over your face you may not be recognized, but you'll certainly be
  noticed. And once you're noticed the danger begins. Albert, I think a
  respectable bank clerk of about thirty-five is what we want."</p>

  <p>He began rummaging in the pile of clothes.</p>

  <p>"We'll give you a rather badly cut suit of plus fours, and a cap. Horn
  rimmed spectacles, Albert. Now let's have a look at him."</p>

  <p>The three of them stared at me critically.</p>

  <p>"Get into these clothes," said Drummond. "I can't be sure till you're out
  of that dressing-gown."</p>

  <p>I contemplated the garments with distaste. "I suppose there are people who
  wear things like that," I remarked, "or nobody would make them."</p>

  <p>"It's a misfit," he said. "I bought a dozen of 'em once, and that's about
  the last. Don't mind if your stockings come down a bit; it helps the effect.
  Yes, Albert: that will do."</p>

  <p>"I think so, sir," said Albert complacently, and at that moment I saw
  myself in the glass.</p>

  <p>The shock was ghastly, but at the same time I was forced to admit that the
  result was amazing. I do not look at my face more often than necessary as a
  general rule, it shakes me too badly to see it. But the reflection that
  confronted me as I stood there was that of a complete stranger. Moreover, it
  was true to type. I had seen hundreds of similar examples at the seaside
  during August, or on char-a-banc trips.</p>

  <p>"Then that's finished," said Drummond. "Now the only pub, as far as I can
  make out, is the Amesbury Castle. I think you'd better arrive separately, and
  you can strike up an acquaintance afterwards."</p>

  <p>He smiled suddenly and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dixon; I'll take charge of that."</p>

  <p>"Charge of what?" I said blankly.</p>

  <p>"Blokes dressed like you, old boy, do not use expensive gold and platinum
  cigarette cases with Asprey written all over 'em. We'll put that in my safe,
  and here is a tasty little thing in leather. Nor, laddie, do most bank clerks
  smoke Balkan Sobranies. I suggest the perfectly good yellow packet...."</p>

  <p>"I loathe Virginian cigarettes," I groaned.</p>

  <p>"Well," he conceded, "you may smoke cheap Turkish if you like. But a
  Balkan Sobranie would shout aloud to heaven. Anything more, Toby?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I think, Hugh. We aren't to know you, are we?"</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled. "You won't know me, Toby," he said quietly. "All you've
  got to do is to keep your mouths shut, and your eyes open&mdash;and if you
  want me, John Bright at the Post Office finds me. If I want you I'll let you
  know."</p>

  <p>He grinned again. "So long, boys. Leave the house by the back door
  separately, and for Heaven's sake, Dixon, try not to appear self-conscious.
  Be a city clerk: don't only look it."</p>

  <p>Which was a policy of excellence, but not quite so easy as it sounded. As
  I walked along Berkeley Street I felt that everybody was looking at me. And
  when I ran straight into a woman I knew opposite the Ritz, I instinctively
  lifted my cap. She stared at me in blank surprise, and I dodged down
  Arlington Street to recover. Ass that I was&mdash;giving myself away at the
  very first moment. But after a while confidence began to return. I realized
  that though Joe Dixon would have caused a mild sensation garbed as I
  was&mdash;Fred Seymour caused none at all. And I further realized that if I
  as Joe Dixon had met me as Fred Seymour, I should have paid no attention to
  me. Fred Seymour was just one of a numerous type&mdash;no more conspicuous
  than any other individual of that type. The truth of Drummond's remark about
  the red nose was obvious. I was just an inconspicuous unit amongst thousands
  of others.</p>

  <p>And so, as I say, gradually my confidence returned. I walked normally, and
  to test myself I determined to pass the commissionaire outside my club. I
  looked him straight in the face: he returned the look without a sign of
  recognition. And he on an average must see me five hundred times a year.</p>

  <p>A sudden thought struck me: I had no baggage. For a while I debated
  between the rival merits of a rucksack and a handbag, deciding finally on the
  former. Then I bought a couple of shirts and some socks, and thus equipped, I
  made my way to Paddington. The last phase of the game, though I little knew
  it, had begun.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; IN WHICH I GO TO FRIAR'S HEEL BY DAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Up to this point the telling of my story has been easy, even
  if the manner of the telling has been crude and poor. But from now on it
  becomes more difficult. Things happened quickly, and we were all of us
  scattered in a way we had not been before. In fact, for the greater part of
  the time, the only member of the bunch who I was able to talk to was Toby
  Sinclair. But I will do my best to make clear the happenings that led up to
  that last astounding <i>dnouement</i>, which even now seems like some
  fantastic nightmare to me. And if some of those happenings are boring I can
  only crave pardon, and assure my readers that it is necessary to write of
  them for the proper understanding of what is to follow.</p>

  <p>I arrived then, at the Amesbury Castle in time for a late lunch. It was a
  typical hotel of the English country town, relying more, I should imagine, on
  lunches and dinners to pay its way than on people taking a bed. The food was
  of that grim nature which one associates with hotels of the type&mdash;plain
  and tough. An aged waiter, with most of yesterday's ration on his shirt
  front, presided over the dining-room, and looked at me in a pained way as I
  came in.</p>

  <p>"Very late, sir," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"And I am very hungry," I answered cheerfully. He polished a menu card
  morosely on his trousers.</p>

  <p>"Mutton hoff," he said. "Beef, 'am, tongue&mdash;and pertaters. Been a run
  on the mutton today," he added confidentially.</p>

  <p>I gazed at the flies making a run on the beef and decided on ham and
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"Many people staying here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Full up for lunch," he said. "And the hotel be fairly full, too. A bunch
  of people came last night. Lumme! 'ere's another."</p>

  <p>I glanced at the doer to see Toby Sinclair coming in.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," he cried, in a high voice that nearly made me laugh. "Food,
  waiter, for the inner man, and then to resume my search. Tell me, have you
  seen a Phragmatobia fuliginosa?"</p>

  <p>The waiter recoiled a step.</p>

  <p>"A'ow much," he demanded. "There's beef, 'am, tongue and pertaters."</p>

  <p>"And only this morning," went on Toby, "I am convinced I perceived a
  Psecadia pusiella. Members, my dear sir," he said to me, "of the great family
  of lepidoptera. In other words butterflies."</p>

  <p>"Beef, 'am or tongue," said the waiter resignedly. "The mutton's
  hoff."</p>

  <p>"Ham, waiter, with a fragment of chutney. You are, sir," he turned again
  to me, "on a walking tour perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"That is my idea," I said. "But I propose to make this hotel my
  headquarters."</p>

  <p>"You may possibly care to come out with me once or twice. My name is
  Stanton&mdash;Professor Stanton."</p>

  <p>"Mine is Seymour," I told him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr Seymour&mdash;" He broke off suddenly. "Waiter, I asked for ham
  and chutney, not the mummified sole of a shoe covered with glue."</p>

  <p>"The tongue is worse," said the waiter drearily. "And that there chutney
  has been here two years to my certain knowledge."</p>

  <p>"As far as I am concerned it will remain for another two years. Give me
  some bread and cheese. Dixon," he said to me urgently, as the waiter left the
  room, "there's a man in the lounge outside I want you to have a look at. I
  only got a glimpse of him that night at the Mere, but I believe it's the
  bloke who was with the woman. Anyway he's got his hand bandaged up. No Mr
  Seymour, a lifetime is all too short for my entrancing hobby. Bless me!
  waiter, I think this cheese must have been here for two years also. Get me a
  pint of ale, will you? Yes, sir&mdash;a lifetime is too short. Nevertheless I
  hope to capture the Cyligramma fluctuosa before I die. Are you doing anything
  this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of going over to Stonehenge," I remarked.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "We'll go over to Stonehenge. I wonder if one can hire a
  car."</p>

  <p>And at that moment a man passed through the lounge. He looked in at the
  door, gave us both a casual glance and then disappeared.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly our friend of the Mere," I said. "I'd know him anywhere.
  Now what the devil is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he be here?" said Toby. "This is the centre of activity at
  the moment."</p>

  <p>"It may be," I agreed. "But don't forget that Darrell and Co. know him
  just as well as we do, and they might come at any moment as far as the enemy
  knows."</p>

  <p>"That's true," he said. "Still, their intelligence work is probably good.
  We've got to watch him, Dixon. Waiter," he called out, "is it possible to
  hire a motor car? Mr Seymour and I were thinking of visiting Stonehenge."</p>

  <p>"There be a Ford down at the garage," answered the waiter. "You might be
  able to get 'old of that if no one eke ain't already. Be you staying 'ere or
  do you want the bill?"</p>

  <p>"Staying," said Toby. "Room 23. Well, Mr Seymour, shall we go and see
  about this Ford? I have an idea that I might perhaps see a Cerostoma
  asperella if my luck is in. Ah! pardon, sir&mdash;pardon."</p>

  <p>He had bumped into a man just outside the door&mdash;the man we had both
  recognized.</p>

  <p>"I trust I have not hurt your hand at all," he went on earnestly. "So
  clumsy of me."</p>

  <p>The man muttered something and sheered off, whilst I followed Sinclair
  into the street.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman was suspiciously close to the door, Dixon," he said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Still, I don't think he suspected us," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Not as us, perhaps. But I think the whole bunch of them suspect
  everybody. When you boil down to it, they're tackling a pretty dangerous
  proposition. If the police did get hold of them, abduction and attempted
  murder form a nasty charge."</p>

  <p>"That is the very point that has occurred once or twice to me," I said.
  "One can understand the lady risking it: she has the best of
  motives&mdash;revenge. But I'm blowed if I see where these other fellows come
  in. There's no question of revenge with them. So what the devil are they
  doing it for?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Money. I'm told that in Chicago you can hire a gunman for a dollar. And I
  haven't the very smallest doubt that you can do the same in England if you
  know where to look. We heard that bloke at the Mere mention two hundred
  pounds. And there are scores of swine who would murder their mothers for
  that. Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>His voice changed suddenly to that of the Professor.</p>

  <p>"And so, my dear Seymour, if we can get this car I will try and show you
  some of those beauties of nature which I feel sure are as yet quite
  unsuspected by you."</p>

  <p>A man brushed past, favouring us both with a penetrating stare.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" I said, when he was out of earshot.</p>

  <p>"Just for a moment I thought the dead had come to life," said Sinclair.
  "You saw that man who passed us?"</p>

  <p>"That thin-lipped blighter who stared? Yes: I saw him. Is he one of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't a notion," he remarked. "Look here, I'm just going to drop a
  line to Hugh, and I'll tell you the rest when we get in the car. Here's the
  garage."</p>

  <p>The Ford turned out to be available, and I got in and waited for Sinclair,
  who was scribbling a note in the office.</p>

  <p>"We'll post it in some pillarbox as we go out," he said as he joined me.
  "Better than leaving it at the main post office. Stonehenge, please,
  driver."</p>

  <p>"What did you say," I asked, when we'd started.</p>

  <p>"I told him about the man at the pub," he answered. "And also about that
  other bloke. Of course there may be nothing in it, but the likeness is really
  so astounding to a man we once had dealings with and who was one of the
  leaders of this very gang, that for a moment I thought it was him."</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason why it shouldn't be?"</p>

  <p>"Every reason. He died most substantially three or four years ago. Hugh
  killed him."</p>

  <p>He grinned suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Of course this is all Greek to you, so I'll tell you about it. When we
  first bumped into Carl Peterson&mdash;now defunct&mdash;and the lady you saw
  at the Mere, it was at the instigation of Mrs Drummond&mdash;before she was
  Mrs Drummond. It's altogether too long a story to tell you the whole thing;
  but in a nutshell, they were engaged in a foul criminal plot. Assisting them
  was one of the biggest swine it has ever been my misfortune to run
  into&mdash;a man called Henry Lakington. He was a mixture of chemist, doctor,
  thief, murderer and utter blackguard. But clever&mdash;damned clever. He
  wasn't as big a man as Peterson because he hadn't got the vision&mdash;but he
  was a far more ineffable swab. Peterson, at any rate, at times had the saving
  sense of humour: this man had none. And in the course of our little contest
  Drummond fought him and killed him. It was one or the other, and that's a bit
  dangerous for the other, if the one is Hugh. Now that man who passed us is
  the living spit of Henry Lakington; he might be&mdash;and for all I know
  is&mdash;his twin brother. And the coincidence struck me as so peculiar that
  I thought I'd mention it to Hugh. Of course, there's probably nothing in
  it."</p>

  <p>"You are convinced," I said, "that this man Lakington was killed."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain of it," he answered. "On that point there's not a
  shadow of doubt. But if there's anything in the theory that certain types of
  mentality have certain types of faces that man would steal the bird seed from
  a pet canary's beak. Hullo! here we are."</p>

  <p>It was years since I had been to Stonehenge, and emphatically the
  impressiveness of the ruin had not been increased by the military buildings
  that had sprung up around it. Equally emphatically the difficulty of playing
  any monkey tricks there either by day or night had considerably
  increased.</p>

  <p>At the time we arrived several empty char-a-bancs were standing on the
  road, and crowds of trippers were wandering round the huge stones escorted by
  guides. And having paid our modest entrance fee we joined a group.</p>

  <p>"There, ladies and gentlemen, you have the slaughter stone on which the
  victim was sacrificed as the first rays of the sun, rising over the Friar's
  Heel, touched his body. Inside you perceive the altar stone...."</p>

  <p>The guide droned on, but I paid scant attention. My thoughts were
  concerned with the present, and not with the past. Was Drummond right in his
  surmise, was this place&mdash;the scene of so much death in the dawn of
  history&mdash;to be the setting for murder as merciless as anything of old?
  What he had said was correct in one respect certainly; if Darrell, or any of
  them, were done to death it would be, to the world at large, a crime without
  motive. And the instant those three were disposed of, the end would come for
  Mrs Drummond.</p>

  <p>It had been sound generalship on his part, leaving them in London. But the
  crux of the whole matter was whether, if there really was a clue to be
  obtained, we should get it. True, that we saved them the risk of being
  murdered, but did we not also prevent any possibility of getting information?
  Granted that our disguises held, what reason was there for us being told
  anything? To get a short cut to our goal, as Drummond hoped, presupposed our
  obtaining the necessary clue. And as far as I could see at the moment, the
  only connecting link we possessed was the man with the wounded hand.</p>

  <p>To the other who, Toby Sinclair said, was like this dead man Lakington, I
  attached no importance whatever. Chance likenesses are frequent, and the mere
  fact that he bore a striking resemblance to a dead criminal was no proof that
  he was a criminal himself. No, the man with the damaged finger was our only
  link, and I began to wonder if we hadn't been foolish in losing sight of
  him.</p>

  <p>I glanced round: Toby Sinclair had wandered off and joined another group.
  And it suddenly occurred to me that it could do no harm to make a closer
  inspection of the Friar's Heel. It was a perfectly ordinary and normal thing
  to do, and would not cause any suspicion even if our opponents had spies in
  the crowd. And there was always the bare possibility of finding a clue.</p>

  <p>I wandered over to it, to find a big man in rough seafaring clothes
  staring at it curiously.</p>

  <p>"Rum old pile this, guv'nor, ain't it? I've seen the same sort of thing at
  Stornoway up in Lewis. Though I reckons the stones there ain't as big. This
  Friar's Heel as they call it is a big 'un all right."</p>

  <p>"You've been to the Hebrides," I said casually.</p>

  <p>"Been there! Lor' bless you, there's not many parts of this little old
  globe that I ain't been to. And with it all I guess there are as curious
  things and as beautiful things in England as anywhere else. Only people don't
  know it, or else they're too lazy to go and look."</p>

  <p>I looked at him curiously out of the corner of my eye. Could this be
  another clue? If it was it meant we had been spotted. And then I took a pull
  at myself: I was beginning to suspect everybody and everything.</p>

  <p>"Stopping in these parts?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"For a few days," I said.</p>

  <p>"Funny sort of country," he remarked. "Good for the soldiers, I suppose,
  but it's a bit too bare for me. I like it with a few more woods and trees.
  Still&mdash;it's fine, especially at night. I reckon that these pebbles would
  look grand with the moonlight shining on them."</p>

  <p>Once again I stared at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, one could imagine all sorts of terrible things happening here at
  night," I said quietly. "Ghosts of old Britons who had been sacrificed: and
  violent deaths, and&mdash;murder."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "You ain't half got an imagination, guv'nor, have you? But I
  take it you're one of the townbred lot&mdash;meaning no offence. Put you down
  in the country at night and you begin to see things that ain't
  there&mdash;and hear things that ain't real. Murder! Who's going to murder
  anyone here?" He laughed again. "I don't suppose anyone ever comes to a place
  like this at night," he went on. "And yet it's a rum thing. I was bicycling
  along that road late last night&mdash;been seeing some friends of
  mine&mdash;and it seemed to me as if there was something moving about the
  place. Round this very stone. Of course it was dark and I may have been
  mistaken, but there ain't generally much wrong with my sight."</p>

  <p>Last night, I reflected. Had the clue been guessed at once, Darrell and
  the other two could have been at the Friar's Heel by then. Had there been
  someone here in readiness? To give them a further clue, or to deal with
  them&mdash;otherwise?</p>

  <p>"You didn't investigate?" I asked casually. "See if you were right?"</p>

  <p>"Not me, guv'nor. None o' my business. And one of Ben Harker's rules in
  life has always been to mind his own business."</p>

  <p>He produced a well-used old briar from his pocket, and proceeded to fill
  it from a weatherbeaten leather pouch.</p>

  <p>"Have a fill?" he said. "Ship's tobacco; the best in the world."</p>

  <p>"A bit strong for me, I'm afraid, Mr Harker," I thanked him. "We miserable
  city clerks are hardly used to that sort of smoke."</p>

  <p>"You prefer them damned fags, I suppose," he grunted. "Ah! well, everyone
  to his own taste. Personally..."</p>

  <p>He paused, and I glanced at him. His fingers had ceased filling his pipe,
  and he was standing absolutely motionless staring over my shoulder. Only for
  the briefest fraction of time did it last, and then he continued his
  interrupted sentence.</p>

  <p>"Personally, I can't ever get any taste out of a cigarette."</p>

  <p>As I say the pause was only for a fraction of a second&mdash;a pause which
  I might quite easily have missed had I not happened to have been watching his
  hands. But I hadn't missed it, and I knew that he had seen somebody or
  something behind me that had caused it.</p>

  <p>"A match at any rate, I can offer you," I said, and as I spoke I turned
  round casually. Coming slowly towards us was the thin-lipped man who
  resembled Lakington.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he answered, lighting his pipe in the unmistakable method of a
  man used to the wind. Then he handed me back the box. "Well, good day to
  you," he said. "Maybe if you're staying in these parts we shall meet
  again."</p>

  <p>He strolled off with the slight roll of the seaman, and I lit a cigarette.
  Certainly nothing he had done or said connected him in the slightest degree
  with the game, and yet I wasn't quite sure. Why that sudden pause in the
  middle of a sentence? And then it struck me that there was nothing to connect
  the man who had caused it with the game either except a resemblance to a dead
  criminal.</p>

  <p>I sat down on the ground, and proceeded to study the huge stone, acutely
  conscious that the thin-lipped man was standing just behind me.</p>

  <p>"You are interested in this sort of thing?" he remarked politely.</p>

  <p>"As much as a bank clerk who knows nothing about it can be," I
  answered.</p>

  <p>"It has always been a hobby of mine," he said. "The past is so infinitely
  more interesting than the present. One admits of imagination; the other is
  bare and brutal fact. These motor cars; this crowd of terrible people peering
  in their asinine way at the scene of age-old mysteries. Doing the place at
  high pressure, instead of steeping themselves in the romance of it."</p>

  <p>He talked on, and there was no denying that he could talk. His voice was
  pleasant and well modulated, and after a while I began to listen entranced.
  Evidently a widely travelled and well-read man, with the rare gift of
  imparting information without becoming a bore. And after a while I began to
  keep up my end of the conversation.</p>

  <p>It was when he happened to mention the Zimbabwe Ruins in Mashonaland,
  ruins that I had broken my journey at Fort Victoria in order to see; rams, as
  many believe, of a vanished civilization, which had fascinated me at the
  time, that I became really interested.</p>

  <p>He, too, knew them, and we started an argument. I maintained that they
  were an ancient legacy from some civilized people dating back, perhaps, to
  before the days of Solomon: he inclined to the theory that they were only the
  work of local natives and, at most, mediaeval.</p>

  <p>"Evidently," he said at length, "you have studied the matter more closely
  than I have. Did you spend long there?"</p>

  <p>"I was actually in South Africa for about six months," I told him. "And I
  used to collect opinions from those qualified to express them."</p>

  <p>"A fascinating country. Though perhaps for any big scheme of emigration
  which would cover all classes of our countrymen Australia is more
  suitable."</p>

  <p>"I've never been there," I said. "As a matter of fact I'm thinking of
  going next year. And to New Zealand."</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said affably, after we had chatted for another ten
  minutes or so, "if you are staying in this neighbourhood you might care to
  have a look at my collection of curios. Though I say it myself I think I may
  say there are few finer in the country. And a man of taste like yourself
  would appreciate them."</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you," I remarked, "and I should greatly like to see
  them."</p>

  <p>He had risen, and I stood up also.</p>

  <p>"Where is your house?"</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I have my car here," he said, "and if you can spare an hour I could run
  you over and show them to you. Then my car can take you back to your
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"There is only one small difficulty," I said, "I came over from Amesbury
  with a gentleman I happened to meet at lunch. I see him over there&mdash;
  Professor Stanton. An enthusiast on butterflies."</p>

  <p>"Professor Stanton," he cried. "Not the Professor Stanton."</p>

  <p>"I really don't know," I murmured. "I met him quite by chance at lunch
  today."</p>

  <p>"But," he exclaimed excitedly, "if it's Professor John Stanton his
  reputation is worldwide."</p>

  <p>I suppressed a slight smile; whatever Toby Sinclair's reputation might be
  in certain purlieus of London, it could hardly be described as worldwide.</p>

  <p>"He's coming to join us," I remarked, "and you can ask him."</p>

  <p>"But it is him," he cried, as Toby approached. "What stupendous luck. My
  dear Professor," he advanced with outstretched hand, "you remember me. What a
  fool I was not to recognize you in Amesbury when I passed you."</p>

  <p>Sinclair stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"I fear you have the advantage of me, sir," he remarked.</p>

  <p>The other waved a deprecating hand. "Ah! but, of course, you would not
  recall me. I am merely one of the thousands who have sat at your feet. It was
  presumption on my part to imagine that my face would be familiar to you. But
  how entranced I was at that lecture you gave on the habits of Pieris
  Rapae."</p>

  <p>"You must be making some mistake, sir," said Toby coldly. "I am not the
  gentleman you think."</p>

  <p>"Modesty, Professor, modesty. Tell me have you discovered a specimen of it
  yet? You told us, if you remember, that it was to be your life work."</p>

  <p>"Though you are making a mistake, sir, as to my identity&mdash;yet I can
  well imagine that it would have been the life work of the man I resemble. The
  rarest of all the species, perhaps. But I have seen today a marvellous
  specimen of the Opsiphanes syme."</p>

  <p>"Stupendous," said the other admiringly. "What eyesight: what wonderful
  eyesight. Well, I mustn't detain a public character. Good day sir, good day.
  And if you care to join your friend in a little visit he has promised to make
  to my humble abode, I shall be delighted to show you my amateur
  collection."</p>

  <p>He bowed courteously and walked off, leaving Sinclair and me staring at
  one another.</p>

  <p>"I say, old boy," said Sinclair, "I hope this is all right. I wonder who
  the hell Professor Stanton really is. Hugh's made a bit of a bloomer there.
  He oughtn't to have given me the name of a pukka character. Anyway, I think I
  pulled the jargon on him all right. I must consult my list of names
  again."</p>

  <p>And it was as he was pulling it out of his pocket that a strange noise
  close by drew our attention. It appeared to come from a little man of
  astonishing aspect, whose fake teeth were clicking together in his
  excitement. He also seemed to be trying to speak. We waited. By this time I
  was prepared for anything.</p>

  <p>"Are you acting for the films," he spluttered at length. "Or are you being
  more stupid than you look for some purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Explain yourself, little man," said Toby with interest.</p>

  <p>"Lying, sir&mdash;lying offensively on a subject which is sacred to some
  of us." His teeth nearly fell out, but he pushed them back with the care of
  long practice. "Using words, sir, which betray you as an impostor. How, sir,
  did you see a specimen of Opsiphanes syme?"</p>

  <p>"With the jolly old peepers, laddie," said Toby soothingly.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" cried the little man. "Are you so profoundly ignorant of the
  subject you desecrate that you do not know that only in the swamps of Brazil
  is that beautiful butterfly found?"</p>

  <p>"No wonder he said my eyesight was good," said Toby thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And further, sir&mdash;do you see that?" He pointed a shaking finger at
  two Cabbage Whites chasing one another nearby. "The rarest of all the
  species, you called them. Pieris Rapae, sir. Bah! you make me sick. You
  should be prosecuted, sir; you should be prosecuted."</p>

  <p>"Look here, you'll swallow your teeth in a minute," said Toby, but the
  astounding little creature had already departed, waving his fists in the
  air.</p>

  <p>"Takes all sorts to make a world, gents," came a laughing voice from
  behind us. "But you do certainly seem to have said the wrong thing." We swung
  round: the man who looked like a sailor was standing there. "Don't you know
  anything about butterflies&mdash;or is he talking through his hat?" He gave
  Toby a penetrating stare. "Dangerous thing, sir, pretending to know more than
  you do. Or be what you ain't."</p>

  <p>He strolled away, and once again we looked at one another. "He's one of
  'em," I said. "For a certainty. That's torn it."</p>

  <p>"Hell," he remarked. "And again, hell. What about Lakington the second? Is
  he one, too?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; IN WHICH I WRITE MY MIND TO DRUMMOND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Toby Sinclair was thoroughly despondent. "I looked up a
  bunch of Latin names in an encyclopaedia," he said morosely. "How the dickens
  was I to know that the damned thing only lived in Brazil?" We were sitting in
  his room at the hotel. "And the devil of it is, Dixon," he went on, "that if
  Lakington is not one of them we've still given the show away to that sailor
  bloke. You could see his suspicions sticking out a yard."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a moment," I said. "You say we've given it away."</p>

  <p>"Well then&mdash;I have, if you like that better," he said sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Don't get huffy, old man," I laughed. "I'm not trying to pretend that I
  should have done any better than you if I'd been the Professor. But as luck
  would have it I was only a clerk."</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at?" He looked at me curiously.</p>

  <p>"Simply this. Up to date I have not given myself away&mdash;either to the
  sailor or to the man you call Lakington. I think I may say that I have been
  the bank clerk on holiday to the life."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but they know you know me," he objected.</p>

  <p>"They know&mdash;and if they choose to take the trouble to ask it will be
  corroborated&mdash;that you and I met casually in the coffee room at lunch
  today. If you are an impostor, which unfortunately they must know by now,
  there is still no reason whatever why I should have known it earlier."</p>

  <p>"But you know it now as well as they do."</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;yes," I agreed. "But the fact that I went to Stonehenge with
  you throws no suspicion on me. I didn't know it then."</p>

  <p>"I'm hanged if I get you," he said.</p>

  <p>"You've got to clear out," I remarked. "Vamoose. Hop it. Disappear from
  this place for good."</p>

  <p>"I'm blowed if I do," he said.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow&mdash;you must. If we're to do any good and help Drummond
  in any way, it's impossible that you should stay on. They know you're an
  impostor; they know I know you're an impostor. Well, how can we both stop on
  here? Am I to cut you dead? Or am I to continue talking to you realizing that
  you are an impostor? Don't you see that it's sufficient to bring suspicion on
  me at once? Besides&mdash;I'm going to speak quite frankly. Your value to the
  side at the moment is nil. In fact, old man, you're a positive source of
  weakness."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," he agreed reluctantly. "Well&mdash;what do you
  suggest?"</p>

  <p>"That you tell them downstairs that you've changed your mind and will not
  require your room. Then you hop it, and I'm sorry to say, as far as I can
  see, you fade out of the picture. I shall stay on, and without being blatant
  about it, I shall drop an occasional remark about your extraordinary idea of
  a holiday. The strange sort of kink that makes a man pretend to be what he
  isn't&mdash;that line of gup. Form of conceit&mdash;you know. I can easily
  cough it up. And by doing that I shall remove any small half-formed suspicion
  they may have about me. I am just an ordinary bank clerk taken in by you, as
  anyone else might have been."</p>

  <p>He grunted and rose to his feet. "You're right. I'll go. Drop a note to
  Hugh explaining things&mdash;and tell him I'm eating mud." And then he
  suddenly paused. "But, good Lord! Dixon&mdash;it's no good. The damage is
  done. If they've got a line on me they'll know Hugh and you and I aren't
  dead."</p>

  <p>"They haven't got a line on you as yourself," I said. "You might be
  somebody else rigged out like that&mdash;Algy Longworth for instance. Clear
  out and clear out quick. For unless you do, if I'm not greatly mistaken
  you'll be for it. They will think you're just another member of Drummond's
  bunch, and as such require to be exterminated. I'm going down now into the
  bar; if I happen to see you before you go I shall be pretty terse in my
  remarks."</p>

  <p>"What sickening luck," he muttered. "Damn that blinking butterfly."</p>

  <p>"It's bad luck," I said, "but I'm sure it's the only thing to do. Look out
  into the passage and see if there's anyone about. Then I'll make a bolt for
  it."</p>

  <p>He opened his door, and gave me the all clear. And a few moments later I
  strolled into the bar. A little to my surprise the seafaring man was there,
  seated in a corner. He was talking earnestly to someone, and as I saw who his
  companion was, my pulse beat a little quicker. It was our friend of the Mere,
  the man with the damaged hand. Proof&mdash;absolute and definite.</p>

  <p>I ordered a pint of ale and sat down near them. And the instant he saw me
  the sailor leaned across and beckoned me to join them. "Draw up, mate," he
  cried. "You know it's none o' my business, but what was your friend's great
  idea this afternoon. I've just been telling this gentleman about it. Your
  butterfly pal, I mean, who knew nothing about butterflies."</p>

  <p>"I assure you," I said a little stiffly, "he's no friend of mine. He's the
  most casual acquaintance. He happened to be lunching late at the same time as
  I was, and I gathered that he was a Professor Stanton, and an authority on
  butterflies. And he suggested we should go to Stonehenge together."</p>

  <p>"Can't understand it," said the sailor man. "Now, if one of you started to
  talk to me about seafaring matters, I guess I'd spot in two shakes how much
  you know about the sea. And what's the good, anyway, of pretending you know
  what you don't know? You look such a blazing fool when you're found out."</p>

  <p>"I think the explanation is very simple," I remarked. "It's merely a
  peculiar form of conceit. That man probably knows a smattering about
  butterflies, and for some reason or other likes to pose as an expert. He got
  it in the neck all right from that little man with the false teeth."</p>

  <p>The sailor slapped his thigh with a blow like a pistol shot and roared
  with laughter. "Got it in the neck! Not half he didn't. Well, it will teach
  him a lesson. And butterflies&mdash;of all things. Look out&mdash;here he
  is."</p>

  <p>Tony Sinclair came fussing in, and as soon as he saw me he crossed to our
  table.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Mr Seymour," he said, "our little trip tomorrow must be cancelled, I
  fear. I have been unexpectedly called back to London, to my annoyance."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear that&mdash;er&mdash;Professor," I said a little
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Going to catch Opsi&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;in Trafalgar Square,"
  chuckled the sailor.</p>

  <p>"I quite fail to understand you, sir," said Toby, drawing himself up.
  "Well&mdash;goodbye." He turned to me and held out his hand. "I trust you
  will enjoy the remainder of your holiday."</p>

  <p>He went out into the lounge, and I watched him paying his bill.</p>

  <p>"Really an extraordinary case," I said thoughtfully. "He's the last man in
  the world I should have thought would do anything so foolish. Even now I
  can't help thinking there must be some explanation. Though I suppose it's
  really a very unimportant matter."</p>

  <p>"You never can tell," said the sailor darkly. "It may be that you're well
  clear of him, mate. Blokes don't masquerade like that unless they've got to.
  And they haven't got to unless there's something wrong somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," said the man with the damaged finger, speaking for the
  first time. "And as I happen to be a member of the police, I think I'll just
  keep an eye on the gentleman."</p>

  <p>He finished his drink and left the room, and the sailor whistled under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the bloke has done," he said. "Or whether it's what you
  said&mdash;just a form of conceit. Anyway&mdash;have another."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two I sat there undecided. Only too well did I know that
  the man with the damaged hand was not a member of the police, only too well
  did I know what he was a member of.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I said perfunctorily. "The same again, please." Should I, too,
  follow and tell Toby? But if I did, the sailor would in all probability begin
  to suspect me. He was a member of the gang, too, and it was vital that I
  should be thought genuine. At the same time, how could I possibly let
  Sinclair run into some trap? He'd been a fool to come over and speak to me,
  seeing who I was with. Still, I couldn't let him down. He must be warned.</p>

  <p>"I think, after all, I won't have another at the moment," I said. "I shall
  go out for a bit of a stroll. I'll go on up and get my hat."</p>

  <p>"Right ho! mate. You might see the Professor getting more
  butterflies."</p>

  <p>I left the bar and went upstairs to my room. Was I doing the right thing
  or was I not? After all, nothing much could happen in Amesbury in the middle
  of the afternoon, and Toby was quite capable of tackling the man with the
  damaged finger single-handed. If he knew about him&mdash;that was the
  point.</p>

  <p>I went down slowly into the lounge, trying to decide. The sailor was still
  sitting in his corner of the bar: he evidently regarded the rest of the
  half-section as preferable to a walk.</p>

  <p>"A note for you, sir." The girl called to me out of the office.</p>

  <p>"For me?" I said, staring at her.</p>

  <p>She was holding it out, and I glanced at it. It was addressed to F.
  Seymour, and the unfamiliar name almost caught me napping.</p>

  <p>"That's not&mdash;" I began, and then I remembered and took it. "Thank
  you," I said. "Who left it?"</p>

  <p>"I really don't know, sir," she said. "I've been out of the office for a
  few minutes and I found it lying here when I got back."</p>

  <p>Who on earth could it be from? No one knew me: and then, of course, I got
  it. Toby had left it on his way out. I slit open the envelope, and for a
  moment I stared at the contents uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>'Do not follow Toby&mdash;H. D.'</p>

  <p>H.D. Drummond! but where was he? How on earth did he know I had intended
  to follow Toby? And even as I racked my brains for an answer, a thickset man
  in plus-fours crossed the lounge and entered the bar. He had a short, clipped
  beard, flecked with grey, and his hair was thinning a little over the
  temples.</p>

  <p>With an immense feeling of relief I followed him. Thank Heaven! He had
  arrived on the scene. Naturally I was not going to pretend to know him, but I
  couldn't resist throwing him a casual glance as I passed. By the mere fact
  that I was there he would know that I had carried out his orders so that it
  was unnecessary for me to do more. And I had the satisfaction of getting a
  quick look of approval.</p>

  <p>"Changed your mind, mate, after all," called out the sailor. "However,
  better late than never, and good beer tastes none the worse for the
  waiting."</p>

  <p>"It looked so infernally hot in the street," I said. "And even the chance
  of seeing our butterfly expert arrested for bigamy wasn't a sufficient
  inducement to go out."</p>

  <p>I purposely spoke in a loud voice so that Drummond should hear.</p>

  <p>"Bigamy; that's good," chuckled the sailor. "With a face like his I should
  think he'd be lucky to get one. Say "&mdash;he lowered his voice
  confidentially&mdash;"what do you make of the bloke in the corner. The one
  with the grouse moor on his face?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," I said. "Why? You don't think he's another criminal, do
  you? Seems a perfectly ordinary sort of bird."</p>

  <p>And then it suddenly occurred to me that it would be a good thing to let
  Drummond know that this man I was talking to was one of the enemy.</p>

  <p>"By the way," I said casually, "seeing that you're a beer drinker, I
  suppose you're a Froth Blower."</p>

  <p>The sailor shook his head. "I've heard of it," he remarked. "But I ain't a
  member. What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they've got a sort of anthem," I said, conscious that Drummond was
  looking in our direction, "by which they recognize one another. It goes
  something like this."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" said the sailor after I'd finished. "Does it? You've got a
  funny sort of voice, haven't you, mate? Or is that really the tune?"</p>

  <p>"It should under certain circumstances be sung twice," I remarked. "This
  is one of them."</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it," he said urgently. "I don't want to be rude,
  guv'nor, but your voice is one of them things when a little goes a long way.
  Have another gargle?"</p>

  <p>I declined his offer, and a little later I made my way into the lounge.
  Drummond had left the hotel, and it was fairly obvious that the only interest
  that the seafaring gentleman could have in me was one of curiosity. Though we
  had done our best to allay suspicion, Toby Sinclair's mistake had greatly
  increased my difficulties. To be associated, however innocently, with a man
  who has been found out as a fraud is bound to make one conspicuous. And that
  is exactly what I had no desire to be.</p>

  <p>The saving point in the situation up to date had been&mdash;though I said
  it myself&mdash;my own acting. And as I sat in the lounge, idly scanning a
  local paper, I confess I felt a little amused. Drummond's absolute assurance
  that we should not recognize him struck me as being distinctly funny. Seldom
  had I seen a more obvious disguise than the one he had adopted. Of course, I
  realized that he had definitely given himself away to me by writing the note,
  but even without that I should have known him anywhere. The beard was so very
  obviously false. In fact, I made up my mind that when I dropped him a line to
  tell him exactly what had happened over Toby Sinclair I would warn him about
  that beard. It looked the sort that might fall off in the soup. And one thing
  was certain. If any of the enemy who had known him in days gone by&mdash;the
  woman herself, for instance&mdash;should chance to see him, he would be
  spotted for a certainty.</p>

  <p>It surprised me, I confess. In one way and another I had heard so much of
  his resource and daring that it seemed all the more amazing that he should be
  so crude. To do him justice, the results he had obtained with Sinclair and
  myself were extremely good. Why, then, did he fail so dismally over himself?
  Could it be that he was so self-confident that he had become careless? Or was
  it merely that he was relying absolutely on the fact that the other side
  thought we were dead?</p>

  <p>A very strong asset, doubtless&mdash;immensely strong&mdash;for just so
  long as they continued to think so. And that was where the great danger of
  Toby Sinclair's mistake lay. Supposing they got him and stripped off his
  disguise. He had been a member of Drummond's gang all through: he would be
  recognized at once by the woman. And the instant he was recognized it would
  be obvious to the meanest capacity that we had not been drowned. If he had
  escaped we must all have escaped. And once that fact was known, suspicion
  would be bound to fall on me in spite of anything I might do. As for Drummond
  with his beard, a child would spot him at the other end of the street. Had
  not the sailor himself been suspicious the instant he saw him? And did it not
  prove, if further proof was necessary, that up to date I was entirely
  unsuspected? Otherwise would he have spoken as he did to me?</p>

  <p>It certainly gave me a feeling of confidence, but just as certainly it
  increased my responsibility. As far as I could make out, I was the only
  person who with any degree of safety could carry on. Sinclair was out of it;
  and I found myself hoping to Heaven that Drummond would stop out too. Of
  course, I knew he wouldn't, but with his extremely conspicuous appearance he
  would do far mere harm than good. In fact, as I continued to think over it I
  began to feel thoroughly irritable. This wasn't a game of Hunt the Slipper,
  or Kiss in the Ring, It was a game in which, as we knew to our cost, any
  false step might prove fatal. And it wasn't playing fair to any of us to come
  into the thick of it with an appearance that called to high heaven&mdash;this
  is a disguise. Toby Sinclair's mistake had been foolish, perhaps, but that I
  had managed to rectify by acting promptly. But nothing I could do would
  rectify Drummond's. He, once he was seen, was beyond hope.</p>

  <p>I crossed to a writing-table: something must be done. He might be our
  leader and all that, but I failed to see the slightest reason why I should
  run a considerably increased risk of getting it in the neck.</p>

  <p>"Surely," I began, "it is nothing short of insane to come here with such a
  blatantly false beard on. The thing shrieks at one. The man who looks like a
  sailor, and who, as I told you by signal in the bar, is one of them,
  suspected you at once. I rode him off, of course&mdash;but if the woman
  should see you, you're done for. We all are. Would it not be wiser, in view
  especially of Sinclair's bad mistake this afternoon, for you to leave this
  thing in my hands for the moment. I am the only one who is unknown to the
  other side. I obeyed your instructions, and did not go after him when he left
  the hotel, but are you aware that he was followed by the man whose finger you
  shot off. What is going to happen if they catch him? Don't you see that the
  whole show is up? They will realize at once that none of us were drowned. And
  what then? Once that occurs, you will forgive my blunt speaking, but you
  won't last a minute. You will be spotted immediately. And because of my
  association with Sinclair they will even suspect me.</p>

  <p>"Would it not, therefore, be better if, as I said before, you lie low for
  a bit? I will keep my eyes open, and find out what I can&mdash;notifying you
  at once of any developments. My principal hope lies in the sailor, and in the
  man with the damaged hand. The latter we know is one of them: the former I am
  equally certain is one also. Not, of course, absolutely so: but his whole
  demeanour at Stonehenge this afternoon was most suspicious. In fact, only the
  certainty of my perfect disguise prevents me from thinking that he was giving
  me the next clue. And if he was, it is Stornoway, in the island of Lewis. But
  of this I am not sure. Why should he waste a clue on an inoffensive bank
  clerk? Let us hope, at any rate, that I am wrong. Our difficulties in
  crossing undiscovered to such a sparsely populated locality as the Hebrides
  will be great.</p>

  <p>"Then there is another man about whom I think Sinclair wrote to you. He
  resembles apparently a man you killed some years ago called Lakington. We met
  him in the street here before starting for Stonehenge; and we again met him
  at the Friar's Heel itself. I had a long talk with him first, and found him a
  most delightful and cultivated individual. In fact, I cannot believe that he
  is one of the enemy. Then Sinclair joined us, and committed his terrible
  gaffe. He told him he had actually seen a butterfly which, as we subsequently
  gathered, only grows in Brazil! Now whether this man, who for purposes of
  reference I will call Lakington, actually spotted this mistake, or whether he
  didn't, I cannot say with any degree of certainty. But the point is really
  immaterial. Because the man who looks like a sailor most certainly did. After
  Lakington had left us, an odd little man, who obviously knew what he was
  talking about, though he acted as if he wasn't all there, told Sinclair to
  his face that he was an impostor. And the sailor, who was close by, heard.
  Now do you see the danger we are in? Sinclair is spotted: you, I'm afraid,
  are spotted also, so that only I am left. And if by any chance they begin to
  suspect me&mdash;which is not likely, but at the same time is a possibility
  we must reckon with&mdash;the coincidence would be too marked to escape their
  notice. One newcomer in disguise might be anybody: three&mdash;one of whom is
  a big man&mdash;tapes us unerringly. We shall have lost the priceless asset
  of secrecy.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore I beg of you lie low. Hide, if necessary, in whatever room you
  may have taken, and wait for information from me. I am repeating myself, I
  know, but frankly, my dear fellow, it never even dawned on me that you would
  appear quite as you are. I venture to think it would almost have been better
  if you had come as yourself. However, the mischief is done now&mdash;and all
  that we can try to do is to rectify it.</p>

  <p>"You may rely implicitly on me; but please do not make my task any harder
  than it is already."</p>

  <p>I read through what I had written. Strong, perhaps&mdash;but not one whit
  too strong. He must be made to understand the enormity of his offence. And if
  he didn't: if he persisted in going about the place as he was, I should have
  to consider very seriously whether or not I would throw the thing up. Where
  would they have been without me up to date? I had more than half solved the
  first clue: I had completely solved the second: and, through old Jenkinson, I
  had given them the answer to the third. Which entitled me to express my
  opinion pretty tersely. And if Drummond didn't like it, he could damned well
  lump it.</p>

  <p>I addressed an envelope to John Bright, and called for a stamp. And it was
  while I was waiting for it to be brought that a trick of memory brought to my
  mind an incident in some detective story I had read years ago. A man had
  given himself away by leaving behind him a piece of blotting-paper which he
  had just used. And the blotting-paper, when held up to a looking-glass,
  revealed exactly what he had written.</p>

  <p>Just one of those little things, I reflected, where brain counts. One of
  those small details where the blundering type of fellow is apt to get caught.
  So I took the blotting-paper, tore it into small pieces, and dropped them in
  the paper-basket. "Bit extravagant, aren't you, mate?" With a feeling of
  annoyance, I turned round in my chair. Standing by the door of the bar was
  the sailor, and with him was the man with the damaged hand. And they were
  both staring at me.</p>

  <p>For a moment I was tempted to ask him angrily what the devil it had to do
  with him, but I instantly suppressed the impulse. After all, it was a very
  harmless remark&mdash;one, moreover, which I was quick enough to see gave me
  an excellent opportunity of consolidating my position.</p>

  <p>"A habit we clerks get into in a bank," I said. "Clean blotting-paper
  always after finishing a job."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he remarked. "What a good idea." I rose and crossed to the
  front door&mdash;I had no wish to post the letter in the hotel. And it was as
  I was actually stepping on to the pavement that a sudden awful thought struck
  me. Supposing&mdash;what was to prevent them, as soon as I was gone, from
  getting the torn-up pieces out of the basket and fitting them together.</p>

  <p>At all costs I must prevent that, and the question was how. The sailor was
  still by the door, though the other man had disappeared. There was only one
  thing to be done: get back to the table, write another letter, and in some
  way or other retrieve those incriminating pieces.</p>

  <p>I wrote another letter, and still he stood there. But at last he went, and
  I made a dive for the basket. The bits were all together, but mixed up to a
  certain extent with old cigarette ends and two used pipe-cleaners. However,
  there was no time to worry over trifles: it was imperative that I should get
  that blotting-paper. I grabbed the lot, including the pipe-cleaners, and some
  soft, wet object, and crammed everything into my pocket. Then, breathing
  freely, I once more stood up, only to see that confounded sailor pop out
  again like a jack-in-the-box from the bar.</p>

  <p>"Lumme, mate!" he cried, "what have you got on your coat? It looks like
  something out of a dustbin."</p>

  <p>I glanced down, just as the soft, wet object fell with a flop on the
  carpet.</p>

  <p>"Why," he said with interest, "that's the rotten plum I threw away an hour
  ago. You don't half have funny habits at your bank, old man, do you?"</p>

  <p>The situation was undeniably difficult, and the only thing to do was to
  carry it off lightly.</p>

  <p>"I threw away an important paper by mistake," I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, you must have had St Vitus's dance in your fingers when you picked
  it up again," he said. "You've got an old bootlace and two toothpicks on your
  coat, sticking in the plum juice."</p>

  <p>He retired into the bar again leaving me fuming inwardly. The man was
  absolutely ubiquitous: it seemed impossible to get rid of him. Moreover, it
  was one of those stupid little things that have the power of irritating one
  profoundly. To be seen by anybody grabbing rotten plums out of a wastepaper
  basket is annoying: in this case it might have been worse but for the cool
  way I had ridden him off.</p>

  <p>However, there was only one thing to be done&mdash;dismiss the matter as
  unimportant. I had retrieved the blotting-paper which was the main point: the
  next item on the programme was to post my letter to Drummond. And then the
  real business would begin.</p>

  <p>I strolled along the street, thinking out the best means of tackling the
  problem. The whole thing boiled down to a question of subtlety and brain: of
  meeting cunning with cunning. Once I had obtained the next clue, or located
  our opponents' main even if only temporary headquarters&mdash;strength would
  doubtless be required. And then Drummond could shed his ridiculous beard and
  emerge from seclusion. But until then&mdash;well, my letter was concise on
  that point.</p>

  <p>My eyes suddenly narrowed: surely there was Drummond himself&mdash;beard
  and all&mdash;going into the Post Office. I quickened my steps. I felt that
  my letter was so vitally important that it would be worth while running some
  small risk to obtain immediate delivery. Every additional moment that he was
  at large in that absurd and obvious get-up increased our danger.</p>

  <p>He was leaning over the counter as I entered, and I went and stood next to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Are there any letters here for Bright?" he asked the girl "John
  Bright."</p>

  <p>She turned round to look, and I nudged his arm gently, showing him at the
  same time the letter I held in my hand. Then I dropped it on the floor.</p>

  <p>"One just come," said the girl handing over Toby Sinclair's note.</p>

  <p>Drummond took it, and then, as she attended to me, he stooped down and
  picked up mine. I bought some stamps, and stayed chatting with the girl for a
  few moments to give him time to get away. Then with a feeling of relief that
  my warning had reached him safely I followed at a reasonable distance. That
  vital matter was settled anyway.</p>

  <p>Once more I returned to the problem. Two main lines of action presented
  themselves, so it seemed to me. The first lay in shadowing the sailor, or the
  man with the damaged finger, or possibly both: the second entailed a further
  visit or visits to the Friar's Heel, and both courses involved certain
  obvious difficulties.</p>

  <p>It was true that up till now I had successfully avoided suspicion, but if
  I proceeded to attach myself permanently to either of the two men, how long
  should I continue avoiding it? If I tried to stalk them at a distance I was
  at once confronted with the fact that Salisbury Plain is not a very populous
  spot, and that I was almost certain to be discovered. On the other hand, if I
  went to the Friar's Heel, what chance should I have of obtaining any clue?
  Why should anything be said to an inoffensive bank clerk?</p>

  <p>The best course I decided would probably be a mixture of the two. I could
  cultivate the sailor's acquaintance, and if I kept my ears open I might learn
  something of value either from him or the man with the damaged hand. But I
  would confine my dealings with them to the bar, or at any rate the hotel,
  unless some opportunity presented itself to accompany them anywhere outside.
  In addition I would pay a further visit to the Friar's Heel, and see if I
  could pick up anything there.</p>

  <p>And that was the conclusion I had reached as I turned into the lounge.
  Prudent, and at the same time calculated to give the maximum of result. The
  sailor was in his usual corner of the bar, and he waved a cheerful hand at me
  as I entered.</p>

  <p>"Been picking up any more plums?" he inquired. "Anyway, what about that
  gargle you wouldn't have before?"</p>

  <p>"My shout this time," I said genially as I sat down. "Just been having a
  stroll through the town. What is it?"</p>

  <p>He was leaning towards me, and signing me to put my head close. "I
  believe," he said in a hoarse whisper, "that that man's beard is false."</p>

  <p>"What man?" I asked bewildered.</p>

  <p>And then, to my rage and fury I saw that Drummond had just entered the
  bar. For a moment or two I could scarcely speak, so angry did I feel. After
  my urgent letter, after my imperative warning, for the triple distilled fool
  to parade himself again in the hotel of all places was too maddening.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," I managed to get out after a while. "Why should a man
  wear a false beard?"</p>

  <p>"Why should a man pretend to know about butterflies when he doesn't?" he
  remarked. "Why should a man pick rotten plums and toothpicks out of a
  wastepaper basket?"</p>

  <p>"I trust," I said stiffly, "that you don't think there is anything
  mysterious about me."</p>

  <p>"Lumme! no, mate," he laughed. "There ain't nothing mysterious about you."
  He was staring covertly at Drummond all the time. "It is false," he affirmed.
  "It waggles."</p>

  <p>"Confound him and his beard," I cried. "Let's have that drink."</p>

  <p>And even as I beckoned to the waiter, what little self-control that I
  still had after Drummond's colossal idiocy very nearly left me. Who should be
  crossing the lounge and heading straight for the bar but Algy Longworth?</p>

  <p>He came drifting in and I stared at him speechlessly. Had everybody gone
  mad I wondered. That he should come here at all must be due to Drummond. And
  that Drummond should have sent him knowing that the man with the damaged hand
  was in the hotel could only be explained by the fact that our much vaunted
  leader's brain had failed.</p>

  <p>True they took no notice of one another, and after a time, Longworth came
  over and sat down at the next table to ours. He, of course, did not know me,
  and I therefore judged it safe to address a casual remark to him. It might
  perhaps enable him to clear out.</p>

  <p>"Motoring through?" I said casually.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Jolly place, isn't it?" he remarked. "I always love dear old Salisbury
  Plain, ever since I spent six months on it at the beginning of the war. But I
  don't know this end very well: I was up Ludgershall way. Is it far from here
  to Stonehenge?"</p>

  <p>"Stonehenge," repeated the sailor. "About three miles, I suppose. This
  gentleman and I were there this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"I thought of going tonight," said Algy, and I felt I could have
  cheerfully murdered him.</p>

  <p>"Did you?" remarked the sailor, staring at him thoughtfully. "Well, it's
  an interesting place, ain't it, mate?"</p>

  <p>He turned to me.</p>

  <p>"What did they call that stone where we were talking? The Friar's Heel,
  wasn't it?" And as he said it he deliberately raised his voice. I had a
  momentary glimpse of the man with the damaged hand standing in the door
  staring at Algy. Then he disappeared, and I saw him leave the hotel quickly.
  The damage was done: the message had been given.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; IN WHICH I GO TO FRIAR'S HEEL BY
     NIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I don't mind confessing that I very nearly chucked in my
  hand. The whole thing was too disheartening. It was worse than
  disheartening&mdash;it was suicidal. I realized, of course, that my letter
  had not reached Drummond in time for him to warn Longworth that the sailor
  was one of the other side, but even so Algy should have known better than to
  discuss his plans with two complete strangers. And now the thing was what to
  do.</p>

  <p>Drummond had left the bar shortly after, and up till dinner time I had no
  chance of a private word with Longworth. I made him one or two covert signs
  when the sailor was not looking, but he missed them all. In fact he seemed to
  me to be wilfully dense. He must know that I was about somewhere, even if he
  didn't actually recognize me.</p>

  <p>At dinner it was just the same. I came in to find him sitting at the long
  table between an elderly lady and a man who looked like a prosperous farmer.
  And not once did he even glance in my direction though I tried to catch his
  eye on several occasions.</p>

  <p>The sailor had beckoned to me as I came in to sit at his table, but I had
  pretended not to see. I wanted peace and quiet to think out this new
  development. If Algy went to the Friar's Heel that night he was for it. That
  much was obvious. Unless, of course, Drummond proposed to be there, too, and
  bring the matter down to brute force. But even if he did, surely he must
  realize that it was very unlikely it would help us to find his wife's hiding
  place.</p>

  <p>Or did Drummond intend to lie hidden in the hope of getting a clue, and to
  use Longworth as a decoy without whom the clue would not be given? That, of
  course, was possible. But what the damned fool seemed to fail utterly to
  realize even now was the folly of doing such a thing in his present disguise.
  Already the sailor suspected him: once let him be discovered at the Friar's
  Heel, even if his great strength did enable him to get away, suspicion would
  become certainty. Then they would either move Mrs Drummond, or finish her off
  right away, and we should be in a far worse position than we were now.</p>

  <p>If only he would leave the thing to me. It seemed such an obvious solution
  to the whole matter. Instead of which, here they were blundering round,
  suspected by everybody and finding out nothing.</p>

  <p>At length I finished my dinner, and went into the lounge. I had seen
  Longworth go out previously, but there was no sign of him as I sat down. And
  as I tried to drink some of the concoction that passes in the average English
  hotel for coffee, the sailor went by towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Goodnight, mate," he called out.</p>

  <p>"Where are you off to?" I asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Going to see some friends out Netheravon way," he answered with a wink.
  "At least&mdash;a friend."</p>

  <p>He went out under the pleasing delusion that he had deceived me, and I sat
  on. Where was Algy?</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour passed: a half, and at length I could stand it no
  longer. I would chance it and go to his room. I got up and strolled over
  casually to the office. There was the entry in the book right enough&mdash;A.
  Longworth, Room 15. I went upstairs; the room was facing me. And after a
  quick glance round to see that no one was about I opened the door and went
  in.</p>

  <p>The room was empty, and I stood there wondering what to do next. It seemed
  obvious that he must have left the hotel, and if so he was probably on his
  way to Stonehenge by now. And the only thing to do as far as I could see was
  to follow him. After all, who knew what he might be up against, and even if
  Drummond was there a third person would do no harm.</p>

  <p>I decided that I would walk. The night was fine though dark, and an hour,
  I calculated, would just about see me there. Then I would lie concealed
  unless my help was wanted, and find out what I could.</p>

  <p>It was just about eleven when I reached the slight hill that passes the
  monument. I was walking on the grass beside the road to deaden the sound of
  my footsteps, and when I got level with the great stones I sat down for a
  while to reconnoitre. I could see them dimly outlined in the darkness some
  hundred yards away, and I craned my eyes to see if I could make out any sign
  of movement. There was nothing: all was silent and motionless, until after a
  while I began to imagine things.</p>

  <p>I recalled that vigil of the other night by the stranded motorcar, and
  realized that unless I did something soon my nerves would begin to go. And
  one thing was obvious: if I did want to find out anything I would have to go
  nearer.</p>

  <p>I put a leg through the wire fence, and even as I did so I heard a sound
  that froze me into immobility and brought me out in a cold sweat. It was a
  shrill scream of fear, and the voice was the voice of a man.</p>

  <p>It came from the direction of Stonehenge, and I crouched there listening
  with every sense alert. The scream was not repeated, though it seemed to me
  that I heard a hoarse worrying noise for a time. Then utter silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I became aware of something else. I was still standing half
  straddled over the fence, when I felt by the faintest movement of my legs
  that someone else was touching the wires. And not very far away either.</p>

  <p>I peered into the darkness: was that the dark outline of a man&mdash;or
  was it only a little mound? It was moving, I could swear it was moving. But
  it was moving away from the road and towards Stonehenge.</p>

  <p>Then came the next unexpected development. This time there was no mistake
  about it: someone was scrambling through the fence without taking any
  precautions whatever. The wires literally twanged, and once again I crouched
  down waiting. Well for me that I did so: well for me that I was not still in
  the place where I had sat down first.</p>

  <p>For a moment later a man, bent almost double, came swiftly past right over
  the spot from which I had only just moved. The fence was between us but even
  so, he was so close that I could have touched him, and how he missed seeing
  me I do not know. But I saw him, and long after he had vanished into the
  darkness I sat there motionless, trying to puzzle out this new development.
  Even without the momentary glimpse I had got of his face, another sense would
  have proclaimed the truth. The man was a coal-black negro.</p>

  <p>I looked round again: the mound was no longer there, and after a little
  hesitation I too started to crawl cautiously towards Stonehenge. Whether I
  liked it or not, the reason of that dreadful scream had got to be
  discovered.</p>

  <p>Foot by foot I wormed my way forward, peering ahead at every step to try
  and see the other man who I knew must be somewhere in front of me. Suddenly
  from about twenty yards away came the faint glow of a screened electric
  torch. I stopped instantly: without realizing it I had almost reached one of
  the great stones. And for a space I stared at the terrible spectacle the
  light revealed.</p>

  <p>Lying on his back, his legs sprawling drunkenly, was a man, and it only
  needed one glance to see that he was dead. There were ghastly marks round his
  throat, and his head lolled sideways. The poor brute had been throttled by a
  man of immense strength, and it looked to me as if his neck had been
  broken.</p>

  <p>It was not Algy Longworth: the dead man was a complete stranger. But who
  was the man who held the torch? His face was in shadow: I could not see the
  outline of his body. Was it the sailor? Or was it the man with the damaged
  hand? I craned forward, and as I did so the torch was extinguished. I had a
  blurred impression of movement, and then silence. The man, whoever he was,
  had gone. I was alone with the dead body. And even as I realized it and began
  to wonder what I should do next, I heard the faint thrumming of a motor car
  from the road. Then came the slight squeak of a brake and the sound of a door
  being opened. I looked round. Whoever it was was running without lights.</p>

  <p>Very cautiously I backed away from the murdered man. An unlighted car
  stopping where this one had seemed too suspicious for my liking. And having
  gone what I thought was a safe distance I lay down and waited: waited until
  the next thing happened, a thing which almost made me throw caution to the
  winds.</p>

  <p>"To the right," came the voice of a man, speaking low. "You have your
  torch?" came the answer, and the man grunted assent.</p>

  <p>And the second speaker was a woman. I could see them dimly outlined
  against the darkness not five yards away. But it wasn't that that filled me
  with a wild excitement: it was the smell of a scent like jasmine&mdash;and
  yet not quite jasmine. It was the woman herself&mdash;Irma&mdash;our arch-
  enemy. They moved away, and I wormed after them. "Here he is," said the man's
  voice. "I'll switch on the torch for a second."</p>

  <p>Once more came the faint glow, and then a sharp exclamation from her.
  "This isn't one of them. I've never seen this man before in my life."</p>

  <p>The torch was extinguished. "Darling&mdash;Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm sure," she said fiercely. "I know the whole brood by sight.
  That is no more Longworth than you are."</p>

  <p>"Then what on earth was he doing here?" muttered the man.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" she answered. "That fool Pedro has killed the wrong
  man."</p>

  <p>"Unless this man is a new member of their gang," said her companion.</p>

  <p>She almost spat at him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not concerned with new members. I want the old lot."</p>

  <p>"My beloved," came his voice, vibrant with love and passion, "can't you
  chuck it? This is all such a ghastly risk. Drummond is dead already: you've
  got his wife. Isn't that enough?"</p>

  <p>"It is not," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are we going to do about this body?" he asked wearily. "Every
  moment we're here increases our danger."</p>

  <p>"Are those sheds over there empty?"</p>

  <p>"But the risk, cherie. It is bound to be discovered."</p>

  <p>"Not until we have finished," she said in a peculiar voice. "Send Pedro
  back from the car to carry it there."</p>

  <p>They were moving away, back towards the road. And to my mind there
  returned those strange words of hers&mdash;"After, I will come to you." And
  her voice as she said the word "Finished," had been the same. What was in
  this strange woman's brain? What dark, hideous plan had she conceived?
  Because the conviction was growing on me that she was not only a woman
  obsessed with an idea&mdash;she was mad.</p>

  <p>And who was this man, her companion, who evidently loved her? Where did he
  come in? Did he hope for reward after her plans were fulfilled&mdash;did he
  hope for her? What wouldn't I have given for the due to the events of the
  night. Who was the dead man? Who was the man who had first examined him and
  then disappeared into the darkness?</p>

  <p>And then the noise of the car starting recalled me to the present. Pedro
  must be the black man I had seen dodging past me down the road, and I had no
  wish to meet Pedro whatever. Crouching low, I dodged away from the place
  where the body lay. I had seen enough. I would go back to the hotel and think
  things over tomorrow.</p>

  <p>I reached the railings, and cautiously crawled through them. Then I
  started on my three-mile walk. From behind me came the harsh cry of a night
  bird, and once I paused and listened. It seemed to me that I heard a strange,
  worrying noise, followed by a sharp shout that was instantly suppressed. With
  an involuntary shudder I walked on till the dim outline of the giant stones
  were hidden by the hill. Nothing would have induced me to return to the place
  again. But I couldn't help wondering what further horror had happened there.
  Had the negro suddenly encountered the other wanderer by night? And who was
  it who had shouted?</p>

  <p>One ray of light, and one ray only shone in the general fog. They had
  intended to kill Algy Longworth that night: they therefore intended to kill
  Darrell and Jerningham. The last lingering doubt that this woman intended to
  play the game had been dispelled. And it was therefore imperative that they
  should be warned. They must at all costs be kept away from the place. Once
  they were caught, the end would come at once: nothing could save Drummond's
  wife. This woman Irma would imagine that we were all accounted for, and no
  further reason would exist for delay. So Algy would have to be sent away as
  soon as possible, and told to stop away until at any rate I had discovered
  the headquarters of our enemy.</p>

  <p>It ought not to be difficult, I reflected. Surely someone in the
  neighbourhood must have seen the negro. He would be a conspicuous figure in a
  locality like this. And once he was identified the house was identified. And
  once that was done, there was one thing on which I was absolutely determined.
  The police must be informed. If Drummond wouldn't do it, then I would. It was
  essential: the house must be completely surrounded by a cordon of men. The
  time for fooling with matters was past: things were altogether too serious.
  We were up against a mad woman and a man who was infatuated with her. And
  they would have to be put under restraint, or else exterminated.</p>

  <p>Then another thought struck me. What if I informed the police at once or
  first thing next morning of what I had seen? Told them that in one of those
  old disused military sheds they would find the dead body of a man, and that
  the murderer was a negro. That would take them direct to the place and settle
  things. As a foreigner, I took it, he would have to be registered: his
  address would, therefore, be known. The only trouble was that my own doings
  might require a little explanation. Why was I masquerading about in a
  disguise? Why had I entered my name in the hotel books as Seymour when it was
  really Dixon? Well&mdash;I should have to tell them everything, that was all,
  though I frankly did not relish the idea of trying to make a stolid local
  police officer believe me. The whole thing sounded too much like a nightmare
  induced by a surfeit of lobster.</p>

  <p>I paused to light a cigarette, and as I did so I saw a red light on the
  road ahead of me. It was the tail-light of a car, and it was stationary. It
  seemed to be about a hundred yards away, and for a moment or two I stared at
  it thoughtfully. True, there was nothing inherently suspicious about a
  stationary motor car, but tonight I was in a mood to suspect anything.</p>

  <p>I crept cautiously a little nearer. Something had evidently gone wrong, I
  could see the outline of the chauffeur as he peered into the bonnet. Another
  man was standing beside him holding an electric torch in his hands, and the
  chauffeur was tinkering with a spanner.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the man holding the light turned it for a moment on to the
  chauffeur's face, and I stopped abruptly. For the chauffeur was the man who
  had sprung at me out of the ditch three nights before, and whose hands I
  could still feel on my throat. No doubt about it now: the car in front of me
  belonged to the enemy. And surely, unless it was a very amazing coincidence,
  it must be the same car that had stopped by Stonehenge earlier.</p>

  <p>I crawled into the hedge and tried to decide on a line of action. There in
  front of me lay the means of running the gang to earth if only I could seize
  it. But how? Once the defect was put right the car would be off, and
  manifestly I couldn't follow it on foot. I cursed myself for not having come
  on a bicycle: then I might have had some chance. Now it was hopeless. And yet
  I knew that if I could but track that car to its destination our problem was
  solved.</p>

  <p>I crept a little nearer, and suddenly an idea dawned on me. The luggage
  grid was down at the back. Suppose I managed to get on that! It would have to
  be done with the utmost care: the exact psychological moment would have to be
  seized. Just as he let in his gear would be the time. And if I was spotted, I
  would pretend that I was trying to jump a ride. Disguised as I was, the
  chauffeur would not recognize me: the woman, anyway, did not know me, and the
  only danger was the other man of whose identity I was still in ignorance.
  Still, it was worth the risk: the information, if I could get it, would be so
  invaluable.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur was closing the bonnet. The man who had been holding the
  light opened the door and got in. The moment had come. Stooping low, I ran
  the few yards to the back of the car, just as I heard the noise of the self-
  starter. Then the engine was raced for a few seconds, and I gripped the grid
  with both hands, and swung myself on to it. We were off.</p>

  <p>A wild feeling of triumph swept over me: so far, I had not been spotted.
  But it didn't last long, and if the road had not been good, it would have
  lasted an even shorter time. For sheer discomfort commend me to a ride on the
  luggage grid of a fast car. Several times I was nearly shot off as we went
  over bumps. In addition, the car was over lubricated, and emitted a dense
  cloud of blue smoke from just underneath me. But for all that, I felt it was
  worth it: I'd done the trick. I'd succeeded where, at any rate up to date,
  the others had failed. All that was necessary now was to hang on until we
  reached our destination, drop off as the car slowed down, and escape into the
  darkness. And in spite of my extreme agony, I almost laughed as I pictured
  Drummond's face the next morning when he heard the news.</p>

  <p>I felt the brakes being applied and heaved a sigh of relief. And then the
  car swung right-handed, and turned through a gate. I could tell by the
  scrunch of gravel under the tyres that we were in a drive, and suddenly a
  light inside the car was switched on. That was a complication I had not
  thought of, for now the ground behind the car was illuminated through the
  back window. And if either of the occupants happened to look out they were
  bound to see me when I dropped off. I hesitated, squeezing myself as close as
  possible to the car. Should I chance it? And while I was trying to make up my
  mind, the car stopped at the front door.</p>

  <p>Now I thought detection was certain, but still my luck held. The man and
  the woman passed into the house: the door closed behind them. And the next
  instant the car moved on. Once again did I get ready to jump off, when the
  noise of the gravel ceased and I realized we were in the garage. Moreover, it
  was a big garage, and the chauffeur had driven the car in as far as it would
  go so that I had at least ten yards to cover before reaching the door. I
  heard him get down and start fiddling with some tools on a bench. Should I
  make a dart for it now? Then the lights were switched off, and he yawned
  prodigiously. He had evidently finished for the night, and I only just had
  time to dodge to one side of the car as he came by on the other.</p>

  <p>He heaved on the sliding doors, and they met with a clang. A key turned:
  his footsteps died away. And I couldn't help it&mdash;I laughed. The
  situation really had its humorous side. Without doubt I had successfully
  tracked the tiger to its lair&mdash;so successfully that I was inside while
  the tiger was out. And as my position came home to me I stopped laughing. The
  humour of the situation lay with the tiger.</p>

  <p>I started to make a tour of inspection. The main doors were locked: there
  was nothing to be hoped for in that quarter. And a brief survey of the
  windows showed that none of them were made to open. Cautiously I felt my way
  along to the further end. A wooden bench littered with spanners and things
  filled three-quarters of it: in the other quarter, and my hopes rose as I saw
  it, was a second door. I tried the handle. It was locked. That finished it. I
  was caught like a rat in a trap. With the arrival of the chauffeur next
  morning I must be discovered. Nothing could prevent it.</p>

  <p>What a drivelling idiot I had been! I had accomplished absolutely nothing.
  I didn't even know where I was, which would have been some recompense. Then,
  even if they kept me a prisoner, I might have found an opportunity of
  communicating with Drummond. As it was, all that I had succeeded in doing was
  to get locked up in a unknown place.</p>

  <p>What about breaking one of the windows? It gave me a possibility of escape
  whereas if I waited there was none. But I soon realized the difficulty of the
  idea. The panes were small&mdash;far too small for me to squeeze through. It
  would mean smashing wood and everything, and there, not ten yards away, was
  the house. Still, it was a possibility. I was bound to be heard but in the
  general confusion I might escape. And even as I was turning the matter over
  in my mind I stiffened into sudden rigidity. A light was shining below the
  bottom of the second door, and I could hear footsteps approaching.</p>

  <p>The key turned, and I dodged behind the car. A man came in, and I could
  hear him cursing under his breath. He had an electric torch in his hand, and
  he appeared to be searching for some tool on the bench. His back was towards
  me, and for a moment I had the wild idea of hurling myself on him and taking
  him unawares. I think if I had had any weapon in my hand I would have done so
  and chanced it.</p>

  <p>He found what he wanted, and left the garage. My opportunity, if it ever
  really had been an opportunity, had gone. But had it? For he had left the
  door wide open.</p>

  <p>Light streamed in, and I crept a little nearer. He was walking along a
  short passage, and a further door at the other end was open. It led into a
  room, and it was from the room that the light came. The passage was evidently
  to enable one to reach the garage from the house under cover, but it was not
  of such prosaic details that I was thinking. It was the brief glimpse I had
  obtained of the interior of the room that made me rub my eyes and wonder if I
  was dreaming.</p>

  <p>The entire furniture appeared to consist of big stones. I had seen no
  chair, no table, only square and oblong stones. At least, I thought they were
  stones: they certainly looked like stones&mdash;stones about three or four
  feet long and a foot thick. And if they were stones, what in the name of
  fortune were they there for? Had I come to a private lunatic asylum? Was the
  whole place bughouse?</p>

  <p>He had half closed the second door behind him so that I could no longer
  see anything from the garage. But I could still hear, and the noise was the
  noise a stonemason makes when chipping with a cold chisel.</p>

  <p>I crept even nearer. Confound the risk, I thought; I was caught, anyway.
  And by this time my curiosity was so intense that it banished fear. At last I
  got near enough to see into the room, or, rather, into a part of it. And what
  I saw confirmed my opinion. They were bughouse: the whole darned lot of
  them.</p>

  <p>The room was a big one, and the first impression that it gave was that it
  had been specially prepared for some mystical religious ceremony. The walls
  were completely concealed with black curtains, and a thick black carpet
  covered the floor. On this carpet, in the portion of the room that I could
  see, big greyish-white stones were lying about apparently haphazard. Some
  were on their sides: others stood endways. Some lay isolated: others were
  arranged as a child might arrange bricks. One particular group that I could
  see consisted of four stones on end and spaced at intervals of about a foot,
  with a fifth laid flat across their tops. In short, the whole effect was that
  of a stonemason's yard arranged by its owner when under the influence of
  alcohol.</p>

  <p>Through the black curtains the lights stuck out&mdash;big, white, frosted
  lights that seemed to hang unsupported in the air. And after a while, as I
  looked at the one opposite me, it began to have the most extraordinary effect
  on my brain. First it would diminish in size, receding into the distance
  until it was only the size of a pin's head; then it would come rushing
  towards me, blazing bigger and bigger till it seemed to fill the whole room.
  I found myself swaying, and with a monstrous effort I looked away. Almost had
  I walked towards that light, self-hypnotized.</p>

  <p>I forced myself to think of other things, and after a while the influence
  waned. What on earth was this extraordinary room? What was the man doing on
  the other side of the door? I could not see him, but steadily, monotonously,
  the chip, chip, chip went on. And then it suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>I glanced up only to shrink back against the wall of the passage. Where
  she had come from I did not know, but there, standing in the middle of the
  room, was the woman. It was the first time I had seen her without a hat, and
  for a while I could only gaze at her speechlessly.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in some sort of loose white robe, and as she stood there
  outlined against the black background, a hand resting lightly on one of the
  big stones, she seemed like the priestess of some ancient cult. Her beauty
  was almost unearthly: her whole appearance utterly virginal. In her eyes
  there glowed a strange light&mdash;a light such as might have shone in the
  eyes of a martyr. And I felt that her soul was all the depth and height of
  space away.</p>

  <p>It was incredible to think ill of such a woman&mdash;to believe her
  capable of evil. Almost did I believe that she was someone else&mdash;someone
  I had not seen before. To think that it was she who had planned the death
  trap at the Mere; to think it was her I had heard talking coarsely and
  brutally at Stonehenge not two hours ago seemed unbelievable. And then it
  came once more, that faint scent like jasmine&mdash;and yet not quite
  jasmine.</p>

  <p>"Have you finished?"</p>

  <p>She spoke quietly, and now her voice was a delight to hear. And then she
  stiffened and drew herself up. Into her face there came a look of disgusted
  contempt. But the poor fool kneeling at her feet, with his arms round her
  knees, was oblivious of it. He was stammering wild words of love, was the man
  who looked like Lakington; and so engrossed was I in the scene that the fact
  of my unknown man being the man who looked like Lakington seemed almost
  trivial. What did it matter who he was, poor devil: he was just an actor in
  the game that is age-old.</p>

  <p>"When, my beloved, are you coming to me?"</p>

  <p>Again and again he said it, his voice shaking, his hands trembling. And
  she just stood there, utterly aloof: to her he was non-existent. Her eyes
  were fixed in front of her, and once her lips moved as if she was speaking to
  someone no earthly vision could see. Even as I had seen her speak at the
  Mere. "Have you finished?"</p>

  <p>With a sigh of utter weariness the man rose to his feet. "Yes," he said.
  "I have."</p>

  <p>She smiled, and held out her hand. "Good. For now there must be no delay,
  my friend. Pedro's mistake has forced our hand. By the way, is he back?"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know. Probably by this time."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I have written a letter which must be delivered to one of the
  three tomorrow morning. We know that Longworth is here, so he will therefore
  be the one. Listen, I will read it to you:</p>

  <p>"'My friends, the game has begun to pall. My revenge is sufficient. If you
  will follow the bearer of this you will come to your destination. And the
  widow shall be handed over to you. If you don't: if you are afraid to come,
  you will still be quite safe. No further steps will be taken against you. You
  will not be worth it. But Phyllis Drummond will die. So take your choice. Her
  life lies in your hands.</p>

  <p>"'But let me repeat the warning given to your late lamented leader. My
  information is good, so no police. Otherwise Phyllis Drummond will die before
  you get here.'"</p>

  <p>"But, carissima," cried the man, "will they come on that? It seems such an
  obvious trap."</p>

  <p>"Quite clearly, Paul," she said, "you have much to learn concerning the
  mentality of Englishmen of their type. They will come, even if a cordon of
  machine-gunners stood in their way. And we shall be ready for them."</p>

  <p>"And then? After it is over?" He stared at her hungrily as if trying to
  read her very soul.</p>

  <p>"After it is over," she repeated coolly. "Why, then, my dear Paul, we
  shall see."</p>

  <p>"But you promised," he muttered. "You promised by all you held sacred.
  Beloved "&mdash;his voice grew urgent and pleading&mdash;"for nearly a year I
  have worked unceasingly to give you your revenge. Worked without reward: at
  times without thanks. Only hope has kept me going, carissima&mdash;the hope
  that when all was over you would come to me. And now you say, 'We shall see.'
  Never have I kissed your lips during all these long months. Irma&mdash;say to
  me, promise me again&mdash;that I have not worked in vain."</p>

  <p>"No, mon ami," she said. "You have not worked in vain."</p>

  <p>With a cry of joy he snatched one of her hands and smothered it with
  kisses. And over his bent head I saw her face. She was shaking with hideous,
  silent laughter. I craned forward fascinated: that such a change could take
  place in any human being's expression seemed impossible. No longer a
  priestess of unearthly beauty, but evil incarnate that made one shudder to
  look at.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the man straightened up, and instantly her face became a mask.
  Even did she go so far as to smile encouragingly at the poor fish.</p>

  <p>"No, Paul," she repeated. "You have not worked in vain. Tomorrow
  night..."</p>

  <p>The sentence was never finished, too late I realized that in my absorption
  I had stepped into the light. For a moment or two she stared at me in
  silence. Then&mdash;"Who is that man?"</p>

  <p>Like a flash her companion swung round. "Why," he said softly, "it's the
  bank clerk. Have you come to see my collection?" He was moving towards me as
  he spoke, and in his right hand there gleamed a wicked-looking automatic.
  "Come in, bank clerk," he said, still in the same deadly soft voice. "I am
  honoured indeed, even if the hour is a little unconventional."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; IN WHICH I MEET MRS DRUMMOND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The situation was undeniably awkward. The fact that I had
  realized all along that detection was inevitable made it none the less
  unpleasant when it came. And I liked neither the look of the automatic nor
  that on the man's face. I stepped into the room.</p>

  <p>"I fear it must seem a little strange," I began, making a valiant
  endeavour to keep my voice steady.</p>

  <p>"It does," he agreed suavely. "May we be favoured with an
  explanation?"</p>

  <p>I plunged desperately. "To tell you the truth," I said, "I lost my way. I
  went out for a long walk tonight, and after taking one or two turnings I
  realized I hadn't the faintest idea where I was. Passing along the road I saw
  this house, and I came up to see if someone could put me right. I couldn't
  get any answer, but I saw your garage door was open. So I went in, meaning to
  ask when the car returned. And I suppose I must have fallen asleep, for when
  I woke up the car was back and the door locked."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the man. "It seems a pity that such a big discrepancy exists
  between the first few words of your explanation and the rest."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you mean," I remarked, uncomfortably conscious
  that a pulse was hammering in my throat.</p>

  <p>"You prefaced your interesting little story," he explained, "by the five
  words, 'To tell you the truth.' Why not do so?"</p>

  <p>With a faint feeling of relief, I saw that the automatic was no longer in
  his hand. "I am not accustomed&mdash;" I began haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Be silent," said the woman imperiously. "Do I understand you know this
  man, Paul?"</p>

  <p>"I met him at Stonehenge yesterday afternoon, my dear," he remarked. "A
  bank clerk with lengthy holidays. South Africa last year, Australia next. I
  must apply for a position in that bank."</p>

  <p>His eyes were boring into me, and I could have kicked myself with
  mortification. I, who had thought that my playing of the part had been
  perfect&mdash;that I alone was unsuspected. I tried another bluff.</p>

  <p>"You are very clever, sir," I said coldly. "But not quite clever enough.
  My father keeps one of the few remaining private banks in which I am a clerk.
  But, as you will understand, not an ordinary clerk. And to broaden my mind he
  has allowed me to travel extensively."</p>

  <p>"Most interesting," he answered. "And most considerate of your father.
  Anyway, that's better than the one before. You're improving."</p>

  <p>"Stop all this nonsense," said the woman harshly. "Why wasn't I told about
  this man?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said pleadingly, "what was the use?"</p>

  <p>"On your own showing," she snapped, "you suspected him. Why wasn't I
  told?" Her voice was vibrating with anger. She swung round on me. "Who are
  you, you little rat?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Seymour," I stammered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her mood changed, and she lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Put him in one of the seats," she ordered quietly.</p>

  <p>"This way, Mr Seymour," said the man.</p>

  <p>"And what if I refuse," I blustered.</p>

  <p>For a moment he stared at me&mdash;thin lipped and motionless. "Just
  this," he said gently, "I will blow out your brains where you stand."</p>

  <p>"A messy proceeding." I strove to speak jauntily. "But may I
  ask&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He whipped out his revolver and covered me. "Move," he snarled. "And move
  damned quick. Come here."</p>

  <p>He crossed to one of the stones. So did I. The more I saw of that man, the
  less I liked him.</p>

  <p>I found that the stone at which he was pointing had been fashioned into a
  sort of rough seat. "Sit down, and put your arms where I tell you.
  There&mdash;and there."</p>

  <p>I obeyed: there didn't seem anything else to do. And then there came a
  sudden click, and I felt two thin steel bars close over my wrists. I tugged
  and he laughed quietly. "I wouldn't waste your time," he remarked. "You're as
  much a part of the furniture now as the stone you are sitting on."</p>

  <p>"Look here, sir," I said, "this is going beyond a joke. I admit that I had
  no right whatever to be in your garage, but that doesn't afford you any
  justification for treating me like this."</p>

  <p>He took no notice. He was speaking in low tones to the woman. And suddenly
  she nodded and came towards me. For a time she stood in front of me staring
  into my eyes, and then she spoke. "Do you know Hugh Drummond?"</p>

  <p>Now subconsciously, I suppose, I had been expecting that question, and on
  that one little effort of mine I do flatter myself.</p>

  <p>"Hugh Drummond." I looked at her blankly. "I've never heard of the man in
  my life."</p>

  <p>Still she stared at me, but my face gave nothing away. And at last she
  turned and spoke to the man.</p>

  <p>"Well," I heard him say, "we might try."</p>

  <p>She crossed to a door hidden in the curtains and disappeared, leaving me
  alone with the man.</p>

  <p>"What has happened," he said suddenly, "to that egregious fraud who was
  pretending to collect butterflies?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't any idea," I answered. "He left the hotel before dinner."</p>

  <p>"Say nothing about him," he said curtly. "It will pay you not to."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't proposing to," I remarked. "I fail to see the slightest reason
  for discussing a casual hotel acquaintance, or what bearing he has on my
  present position."</p>

  <p>"If you hadn't been a damned fool you wouldn't be in your present
  position. Now the truth, my friend. Who are you, and how did you come
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to add to what I have already said," I answered.</p>

  <p>He stared at me moodily, and I grew more and more puzzled. Try as I would
  I couldn't get a line on his mental attitude. If, as I now knew, he had
  spotted Toby Sinclair as a fraud, and me also, one would have expected him to
  show signs of gratification, even of triumph at having caught one of us so
  easily. Instead of which he seemed positively annoyed at my presence. True I
  had interrupted him in the middle of his love-making, but I felt that didn't
  account for it.</p>

  <p>"You must be one of them," he said half to himself. "And that butterfly
  fool as well. Damn it! you swarm like rabbits."</p>

  <p>I said nothing. Light was beginning to dawn on the situation. Our thin
  lipped friend wanted the lady, and wanted her quickly. But before he got her
  he had, in the vernacular, to do a job of work. And that job had consisted up
  till now of disposing of the six of us. He believed that three were accounted
  for: the others were to be settled in the near future. And now he was
  confronted as he thought with further additions to the party, and therefore
  further delay in obtaining his purpose.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you get here?" he repeated angrily.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to add to what I have already said," I repeated with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Damn you," he snarled. "You'll smile the other side of your face before
  long. It may amuse you to know that you'll never leave this room alive."</p>

  <p>"That," I remarked with a confidence I was very far from feeling, "remains
  to be seen."</p>

  <p>He took out his cigarette case savagely and started pacing up and down.
  And I for the first time since I had come into the room began to examine it
  more thoroughly. And the more I examined it the more amazing did it become.
  The whole of it was in keeping with the part I had seen from the passage.
  Stones and yet more stones, placed apparently indiscriminately. And yet, were
  they? Was there not some definite design? And as I stared round trying to
  find the solution I noticed a thing which gave me a queer little thrill.
  There were other roughly shaped seats beside the one I was sitting
  in&mdash;five others, making six in all. And each one was fitted with the
  same steel bars that encircled my own wrists. Six chairs, and six of us. What
  fantastic scheme had been evolved in that woman's deranged brain? Time, I
  reflected grimly, and time alone would tell.</p>

  <p>The sound of a door opening made me turn my head. Irma had returned. But
  now another woman was with her&mdash;a woman who was blindfolded. And with a
  sudden quickening of my pulse I realized that this must be Phyllis Drummond
  herself.</p>

  <p>She had evidently been awakened from sleep. Her bare feet were thrust into
  slippers, and she had slipped a peignoir over her pyjamas. Her face under the
  handkerchief that covered her eyes was pale but absolutely determined. Guided
  by her captor's hand on her arm she walked firmly and without hesitation
  until she was halted in front of my chair.</p>

  <p>"What new foolery is this?" she asked scornfully, and I metaphorically
  took off my hat to her. Captivity had not broken her spirit.</p>

  <p>"No foolery at all, my dear, but a very pleasant surprise for you."</p>

  <p>Mrs Drummond's hands clenched convulsively. "You don't mean that Hugh has
  found me?" A faint smile passed over Irma's face, the news of Drummond's
  supposed death had evidently been suppressed. "Not quite that," answered the
  other, "but one of his friends has."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mrs Drummond breathlessly, "he has succeeded. And so I am
  free to go. Who is it? Is it you, Peter?"</p>

  <p>With a quick movement Irma whipped off the handkerchief and for a while
  Drummond's wife stared at me blankly. Then she turned wearily to her captor.
  "Why torment me?" she said. "What's the good? You know Hugh's friends. I've
  never seen this man before in my life."</p>

  <p>And Irma who had been watching her intently relaxed and turned to the man.
  "That's genuine," she said briefly.</p>

  <p>"Is this by any chance," I remarked ponderously, "a private lunatic
  asylum?"</p>

  <p>"You may well ask, sir," said Mrs Drummond. "I don't know who you are, or
  how you came here, but there is at any rate one mad person present. And that
  is this woman."</p>

  <p>Irma laughed, and lit a cigarette. "Dear little Phyllis," she murmured.
  "Always so direct and positive, aren't you? And now that you've been
  introduced to this room a little sooner than I had intended, tell me what you
  think of it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Drummond looked about her, a look of complete bewilderment spreading
  gradually over her face.</p>

  <p>"What on earth does it all mean," she said at length. "What are all these
  stones for?"</p>

  <p>"A model, my dear," answered the other gently, "that it has taken Paul
  much labour and trouble to construct. A model that is accurate in every
  detail."</p>

  <p>"A model of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of Stonehenge. One or two of the stones have been left out, but all the
  important ones are here. There for instance you see the Friar's Heel, and
  that one is the altar stone. You know the legend, of course. Some authorities
  do not believe in it, but it's a very pretty fairy story anyway. It runs that
  when the first rays of the rising sun on Midsummer Day shining over the
  Friar's Heel strike this third stone, the name of which I have not yet told
  you, the ceremony begins."</p>

  <p>Her voice was soft and almost caressing, nevertheless my lips were dry.
  For I knew what the third stone was.</p>

  <p>"It must have been an interesting ceremony, Phyllis. Can't you see those
  wild-eyed priests clad in fantastic garments? Can't you see that great
  rolling plain and the waiting multitude of savages&mdash;waiting in the hush
  that comes before the dawn for the first gleam of the sun above the
  horizon?"</p>

  <p>I was staring at her fascinated: her eyes were glittering
  feverishly&mdash;her cigarette was forgotten.</p>

  <p>"A minute more&mdash;and a sigh runs round the spectators. A few seconds,
  and the excitement grows. You can feel it&mdash;hear it like wind rustling in
  the trees.</p>

  <p>"Inside the sacred circle stand the priests&mdash;some by the altar stone,
  some by this third stone here. All eyes are turned towards the east to greet
  the arrival of their god. This is the day on which he vouchsafes them his
  visible presence longest: this is the day on which it is meet and proper that
  he should be propitiated and thanked. An offering must be made: a sacrifice
  given.</p>

  <p>"And on this third stone, waiting, too, for that first ray to strike her,
  lies the sacrifice. For those around her, for the hushed multitude outside,
  the moment that is just coming means life&mdash;the continuation of the
  benefits their god has bestowed on them since last Midsummer Day. For her it
  means&mdash;death: the stone on which she lies is the Slaughter Stone."</p>

  <p>She fell silent, and I glanced at Mrs Drummond. She was staring at the
  speaker with a dawning horror in her eyes, and suddenly she bit the back
  other hand to keep back a cry. She knew&mdash;and I knew. But after a moment
  she pulled herself together with a great effort.</p>

  <p>"Most interesting," she remarked steadily. "And did you have all these
  stones put up so that you could play charades on them?"</p>

  <p>Slowly the madness faded from the other's face, and she flicked the ash
  from her cigarette on to the carpet. "That's it," she smiled. "A little game
  of let's-pretend. We shall be playing it tomorrow, my dear&mdash;or rather
  tonight. What part would you like to take?"</p>

  <p>The silence grew unbearable, and yet once again did I take off my hat to
  that poor girl. She was powerless: she was trapped&mdash;but she was white
  clean through.</p>

  <p>"I am not very good at acting," she said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Yours will be a passive&mdash;even if a very important role," returned
  the other. "No histrionic ability will be required."</p>

  <p>"And may I ask," I remarked politely, "if I am to be privileged with a
  part. I must say I don't think much of the comfort of your stalls."</p>

  <p>For the moment at any rate my role was clear: I must remain the outsider
  who had blundered into a madhouse. Slowly the woman turned and stared at
  me.</p>

  <p>"I think you will look nice as a dead-head," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand that the rest of the audience will have paid for their
  seats?"</p>

  <p>"They will at any rate have worked hard," she returned. "But I can assure
  you there will be no jealousy on that account. The unexpected guest is always
  welcome."</p>

  <p>"Charming," I said cheerfully. "At the same time, if it is all the same to
  you, I would rather like to know the hour the show starts so that until then
  I can enjoy my very short holiday in the manner I had intended to. Frankly
  this seat is giving me cramp."</p>

  <p>I winked ostentatiously at Mrs Drummond: obviously this female must be
  humoured. But there was no response from her: somewhat naturally she accepted
  my role at its face value.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman knows nothing about your wicked game," she burst out.
  "It's unfair, it's unjust to keep him here."</p>

  <p>"To know nothing about the play is always an advantage," returned the
  other. "However, I grow weary. We will retire, my dear Phyllis&mdash;so that
  we shall both be fresh for the performance."</p>

  <p>She led the way to the door, and I was left alone with the man.</p>

  <p>"Look here, sir," I said angrily, "this has gone far enough. I admit that
  what I told you sounds a bit fishy: nevertheless it happens to be the truth.
  And I insist upon being allowed to go. Or if you wish to give me in charge
  then send for the police. But this is preposterous. You now know that I am
  not one of them, whoever 'they' may be."</p>

  <p>"And you," he retorted calmly, "now know altogether too much. So for the
  purposes of this entertainment&mdash;positively for one night only&mdash;I
  fear you will have to be treated as if you were one of them."</p>

  <p>He strolled through the door leading to the garage, and I heard the chink
  of metal against metal as he put the tools back on the bench. My last hope
  had gone, my last bluff had failed. When Mrs Drummond had failed to recognize
  me, and Irma herself had said "that's genuine," there had seemed for a while
  a possibility of escape. Now there was none. Now everything must depend on
  Drummond. He would follow the other three, of course, but without any idea of
  the strength he was walking into.</p>

  <p>I counted them up in my mind. There was the man called Paul, the
  chauffeur, the man with the damaged hand; the sailor&mdash;and last but not
  least the negro. So many I knew of personally; how many more there were
  remained to be seen. And what chance had Drummond against a bunch like that?
  If only I could have got away I could have warned him. I began to tug
  desperately at the steel bars until a woman's laugh made me look up suddenly.
  Irma had returned.</p>

  <p>"You can save yourself the trouble, bank clerk," she said mockingly, and
  at the sound other voice Paul returned.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we had better gag him, my dear," he remarked, and she nodded
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "Gag him&mdash;and then go."</p>

  <p>"This is an outrage," I spluttered, and the next instant he had deftly
  slipped a gag into my mouth, and then wrapped a handkerchief round me.</p>

  <p>"If I hear a sound," he said quietly, "I shall come down and finish you
  off on the spot. Carissima, you must be tired." He crossed to the woman.
  "Won't you come to bed?"</p>

  <p>"Go," she said curtly. "I shall come in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>He went unwillingly, and for a while the woman stood motionless staring in
  front of her. The strange look had returned to her eyes: she had forgotten my
  existence. Noiselessly she moved about on the thick black carpet, the
  incarnation of grace and beauty. First to one stone, and then to another she
  glided, as a hostess might move round her drawing-room, giving it the
  finishing touches before the arrival of her guests.</p>

  <p>And then at last she paused before the altar stone. She knelt down and ran
  her fingers along underneath it searching for something. At length she found
  it and pulled it out. It was the photograph of a man.</p>

  <p>Fascinated I watched her as she kissed it passionately: then she placed it
  on the altar in front of her, and bowed her head as if in prayer. I heard the
  murmur of the other voice, but the actual words I could not distinguish. And
  after a while I began to feel drowsy. The gleaming white light opposite
  seemed to be growing bigger and bigger my head lolled back. And on the
  instant I was wide awake again.</p>

  <p>Part of the roof was glassed in, like the roof of a racquet court, and
  some of the panes were open for ventilation. And staring through one of the
  openings was a man. His eyes were fixed on the kneeling woman: his face was
  inscrutable. Then he glanced at me, and for a brief second our eyes met. In
  am instant he had disappeared, and I was left trying to fit this new
  development into the jigsaw. For the man who had been staring through the
  skylight was the sailor.</p>

  <p>Still her voice droned on musically, but I paid no attention. It
  confirmed, of course, my knowledge that the sailor was one of them, but why
  should he be on the roof? Spying, presumably: spying on the woman. And when
  he realized that I had seen him he had disappeared at once for fear I might
  say something.</p>

  <p>"My lover! My god!"</p>

  <p>Her words, clear at last, came through the silent room, and once again I
  looked at her. With her hands clasped together she was rocking to and fro on
  her knees in front of the photograph.</p>

  <p>"Tonight, I come to you, my beloved."</p>

  <p>And the lights shone on, gleaming like great stars against the black
  curtains. And the carpet seemed to glisten like some dark mountain pool deep
  hidden in the rocks. And the great white stones that rose from it took unto
  themselves life, and joined in a mighty chorus&mdash;"My beloved."</p>

  <p>I closed my eyes: I was dreaming. It was some dreadful nightmare.</p>

  <p>"My beloved, I come to you."</p>

  <p>The sailor was shouting it: the man who had sprung at me out of the ditch
  was shouting it: Paul, his face a seething mass of black passion, was
  shouting it. I was shouting it, too&mdash;shouting it better than
  anyone&mdash;shouting it so well and so loudly that the woman herself, Irma,
  looked into my eyes and praised me. I could feel her fingers on my eyelids,
  from a great distance she nodded as if satisfied. Then came darkness. I
  slept.</p>

  <p>It was daylight when I woke, cramped and stiff in every limb. There was a
  foul taste in my mouth, and I wondered if I had been drugged. I had noticed
  nothing peculiar on the handkerchief, but only on that supposition could I
  account for my condition. My head ached, my eyes felt bleary, and I'd have
  given most of my worldly possessions for a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>By a stupendous feat of contortion I twisted my head so that I could see
  my wrist watch, only to find that the damned thing had stopped. Not, I
  reflected, that it mattered very much what the time was: an odd hour or two
  this way or that was of little account situated as I was. And after a while I
  began to curse myself bitterly for having been such an utter fool. If only I
  hadn't shown myself in the passage: if only...</p>

  <p>But what was the use? I hadn't slipped off the car: I had shown myself in
  the passage. And here I was caught without, as far as I could see, a chance
  of getting away. What made it more bitter still was the knowledge I
  possessed, the invaluable knowledge, if only I could have passed it on. Why,
  if Hugh Drummond only knew, he, with his marvellous shooting ability, could
  dominate the whole scene from the roof. But he didn't know, and all he would
  do would be to walk straight into the trap after the other three.</p>

  <p>After a while my thoughts turned in another direction&mdash;even less
  pleasant than the first. What was in store for us? Was it all some grim,
  fantastic jest, or was it a revenge so terrible that the mere thought of it
  made me almost sick? Could it be conceivably possible that this foul woman
  intended to kill Mrs Drummond in front of us all? And afterwards deal with
  us?</p>

  <p>It seemed inconceivable, and yet the trap at the Mere was just as
  dastardly. It was no good judging her by ordinary standards: therein lay the
  crux. She was mad, and to a mad woman everything is conceivable. Anyhow the
  present was bad enough without worrying over the future.</p>

  <p>Faintly through the wall I heard the self-starter being used, and then the
  car leave the garage. That must be the note going to Darrell and Co. Would
  they walk into it blindly, or would they take some rudimentary precautions?
  Would they believe that this woman did really intend to set Mrs Drummond free
  if they came?</p>

  <p>From every angle I turned the thing over in my mind only to arrive at the
  same brick wall each time. Whatever they did do or didn't do, I was out of
  the picture. I was powerless to help them in any way so there wasn't much use
  worrying.</p>

  <p>"Have we slept well?" came a sardonic voice from the door.</p>

  <p>Paul, with a sneering smile on his thin lips, was standing there looking
  at me. Then he came over and removed the handkerchief and the gag. For a time
  I could only move my jaws stiffly up and down, and make hoarse grunting
  noises&mdash;a thing which seemed to cause him unbounded amusement.</p>

  <p>"Damn you," I croaked at last, "did you dope me last night?"</p>

  <p>"A very efficacious and but little known narcotic, Mr Seymour," he
  remarked suavely, "was on the handkerchief I put round your mouth. Was your
  sleep dreamless and refreshing?"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake," I muttered, "give me something to drink. My tongue feels
  like a fungoidal growth."</p>

  <p>"A defect, I admit," he said, "in that particular drug. It leaves an
  unpleasant taste. And so I have much pleasure in telling you that it is on
  the matter of breakfast that I have come."</p>

  <p>"Breakfast," I shuddered. "If I saw an egg I'd be sick."</p>

  <p>There came a little click from behind my chair, and the steel bars slipped
  off my wrists.</p>

  <p>"Stand up," he said. "At the moment the warning is unnecessary, I know.
  But bear in mind that freedom from your late position does not imply any
  further concession. So&mdash;no monkey tricks."</p>

  <p>He was right: at the moment&mdash;and for a considerable number of
  moments&mdash;the warning was unnecessary. Both my arms had gone to sleep:
  and as soon as I got up I was attacked by the most agonizing cramp in my left
  leg. But at last I managed to regain some semblance of normality.</p>

  <p>"Where's that drink?" I muttered.</p>

  <p>"All in due course," he returned. "Owing to the fact that certain small
  preparations have to be made here for our little entertainment tonight we
  have to find other accommodation for you today. It would be a great pity if
  the element of surprise was lacking. And so you will come with me, Mr
  Seymour: and you will bear in mind that I have a revolver in my hand, Mr
  Seymour, and that my finger is on the trigger, Mr Seymour. And that should
  you give me the slightest trouble, you wretched interfering little busybody,
  that finger will connect with the trigger and the result will connect with
  you. So, hump yourself."</p>

  <p>I could feel the muzzle of his gun in the small of my back as he pushed me
  towards the door. But I didn't care: anything was better than the atrocious
  discomfort of that stone seat. Moreover a drink appeared to be looming on the
  horizon.</p>

  <p>The door led into the hall. No one was about, and still in the same
  positions we reached the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Up," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>At a turn in the staircase stood a grandfather clock, and I saw it was
  half past nine. So I reckoned I must have slept for five or six hours.</p>

  <p>"Through that door," he ordered.</p>

  <p>A man I had never seen before rose as we came in. But I didn't care about
  him: my eyes were riveted on a teapot.</p>

  <p>"Charles will be your companion for today," he remarked. "And you had
  better look at Charles." I did: then I returned to the teapot. As an object
  to contemplate Charles did not appeal to me.</p>

  <p>"Charles has orders," continued the other, "to deal faithfully with you in
  the event of the slightest trouble. That is so, isn't it, Charles?"</p>

  <p>"I'll deal with 'im faithfully, guv'nor," he chuckled. "'E won't try
  nothing on twice, I gives yer my word. Why, I'd eat a little mess like
  that."</p>

  <p>He emitted a whistling noise through a gap in his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Paint the wall wiv 'is faice, I will," he continued morosely.</p>

  <p>"A character is Charles," said Paul to me. "Equally handy with his fists
  or a knife. So be careful, Mr Seymour&mdash;very careful."</p>

  <p>I gulped down my cup of tea and began to feel better. "I am sure I shall
  find him a most entertaining companion," I murmured. "Now don't let me detain
  you any more, little man. Run away and have your children's hour with the
  bricks downstairs. Or are you going to play puffers in the passage?"</p>

  <p>And, astounding to relate, it got home. For a moment I thought he was
  going to hit me. His face was white with rage, his fists were
  clenched&mdash;evidently a gentleman without the saving grace of humour. But
  he controlled himself and went out slamming the door behind him, and I began
  to feel better still.</p>

  <p>Anyway my limbs were free, and I'd had something to drink. Moreover there
  were cigarettes in my pocket. "Charles," I said, "will you smoke?"</p>

  <p>Charles said&mdash;"Yus," and I began to take close stock of Charles. And
  one thing was quite obvious at first glance. He was perfectly capable of
  painting the wall with my face if it came to a trial of strength. So that if
  I was going to turn the change of quarters to my advantage it would have to
  be a question of brain and cunning and not force. And the first and most
  obvious method seemed bribery.</p>

  <p>I led up to it tactfully, but diplomacy was wasted on Charles. At the
  mention of the word money his face became quite intelligent.</p>

  <p>"'Ow much 'ave you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"About thirty pounds," I answered. "It's yours here and now if you'll let
  me go, and then there's nothing to prevent you clearing out yourself."</p>

  <p>"Let's see the colour of it," he said, and with a wild hope surging up in
  me I pulled out my pocket book. If I got away at once I'd be in time.</p>

  <p>"There you are," I cried. "Twenty-eight pounds."</p>

  <p>"Looks good to me," he remarked. "Though I ain't partial to fivers myself.
  Some suspicious blokes takes the numbers. You ain't suspicious are you,
  matey?"</p>

  <p>He slipped the bundle into his pocket, and I stood up.</p>

  <p>"Is it safe now," I said eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Is wot safe now?"</p>

  <p>"For me to go, damn it."</p>

  <p>"Go where?"</p>

  <p>"Out of the house, as you promised."</p>

  <p>"Naughty, naughty," he said reproachfully. "Do you mean to say that that
  there money was hintended as a bribe?"</p>

  <p>I stared at him speechlessly.</p>

  <p>"And I thort as 'ow it was just a little return for the pleasure of
  be'olding my faice."</p>

  <p>"You confounded scoundrel," I spluttered. "Give me back my notes."</p>

  <p>Charles became convulsed with an internal upheaval that apparently
  indicated laughter.</p>

  <p>"Yer know, matey," he said when he could at last speak, "I didn't know
  that they let things like you out of a 'ome."</p>

  <p>Once more the convulsion seized him, and a dull overmastering rage began
  to rise within me. The limit of my endurance had been reached. I felt I
  didn't care what happened. Damn Drummond and all his works: damn the moment
  I'd ever let myself in for this fool show. Above all, damn this great hulking
  blackguard who had pinched my money, and now sat there nearly rolling off his
  chair with laughter.</p>

  <p>And suddenly I saw red. I sprang at him and hit him with all my force in
  the face. Then while he was still too surprised to move I got in a real
  purler with the teapot over his right eye. And after that I frankly admit I
  don't remember much more. I recall that he did not remain too surprised to
  move for long. I recall seeing something that gleamed in his hand, and
  feeling a searing, burning pain in my forearm. I also recall that an object
  which felt like a steam hammer hit my jaw. Then&mdash;a blank.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; IN WHICH SOME OF THE OTHERS JOIN ME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When I came to myself I was back in the room below, fastened
  to the same seat as before. The filthy taste was in my mouth again, so I
  guessed they had used the narcotic on me once more. But this time that wasn't
  my only trouble. My jaw felt as if it had been broken: and my arm, which some
  one had bound up roughly, ached intolerably.</p>

  <p>For a while I sat there motionless. I was feeling dazed and drowsy. I'd
  almost come to the end of my tether. A sort of dull apathy had told of me. I
  felt I didn't care what happened as long as it happened quickly.</p>

  <p>The room was absolutely silent, and after a time I forced my brain to
  work. I was alone: I was ungagged. Supposing I shouted for help. There was a
  bare chance that I might be heard by some stray passer-by. Anyway it was
  worth trying.</p>

  <p>"Help!" I roared at the pitch of my lungs. "Help!"</p>

  <p>I listened: still no sound. Very good: I'd try again. I opened my mouth: I
  shut it. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say it shut itself.</p>

  <p>A huge black hand had suddenly materialized from nowhere&mdash;a hand with
  the fingers curved like a bird's talon. I stared at it fascinated, as it
  moved gently towards my throat. There was no hurry, but the utmost
  deliberation in the whole action. And this time I nearly screamed in sheer
  terror.</p>

  <p>The fingers closed round my throat, and began playing with it. Still quite
  gently. No force was used; but every touch of those fingers gave its own
  message of warning.</p>

  <p>As suddenly as it had appeared, it went, and I sat there sweating and
  silent. So I was not alone: somewhere behind me, out of sight, was that
  cursed nigger Pedro. The hand that had closed on my throat was the actual
  hand that had murdered that poor devil the night before. And as if he had
  read my thoughts there came from above my head a hideous throaty chuckle.
  Then silence once again.</p>

  <p>Gradually I grew calmer, though the thought of that great black brute
  lurking behind me was horrible. If only I could see the devil it would be
  better. But he remained out of sight, and after a time I began to think he
  must have gone. Into the garage perhaps&mdash;the passage leading to it was
  behind me. Whether he had or whether he hadn't, however, I dismissed the idea
  of calling for help.</p>

  <p>To distract my mind, I studied the room with closer attention. I could see
  more than half, and I wondered what the small preparations were that Paul had
  spoken of. As far as I could see nothing was changed: the same stones, the
  same carpet. And then it struck me that on one of the stone seats was what
  looked like a block of wood. It was about the size of a box of a hundred
  cigarettes, and a cord stuck out from one end on to the carpet.</p>

  <p>I looked at the other seats. A similar block was on each one of them, and
  by pushing myself backwards in my own, I could feel the sharp edge against my
  spine.</p>

  <p>By twisting my head I could just see the cord attached to it. It was a
  long one, and I followed it idly with my eyes across the carpet until it
  disappeared behind the next stone. Part of the preparations evidently, but
  with what purpose was beyond me. Just as everything else was beyond me. Time
  alone would show.</p>

  <p>But that fact didn't stop one thinking. Round and round in my head ran the
  ceaseless question&mdash;what was going to happen that night? From every
  angle I studied it till my brain grew muzzy with the effort. What was going
  to be done to us? Did that woman really mean all she had implied, or had it
  been a jest made to frighten Mrs Drummond?</p>

  <p>After a while I dozed off, only to wake up sweating from an appalling
  dream in which two of the great stones were being used to crush my head by
  the nigger. Looking back now I suppose I was a little light-headed, but at
  the time I wasn't conscious of it. I had lost a good deal of blood from the
  wound in my arm though I didn't know it then. And as the day wore on, and the
  room gradually grew darker and darker, I sank into a sort of stupor. Vaguely
  I heard odd sounds, the car in the garage, a man's voice in the hall, but
  they seemed to come from a long way off. And the only real things in my
  mental outlook were those cursed white stones.</p>

  <p>They moved after a while, passing me in a ceaseless procession. They
  heaved and dipped and formed fours till I cursed them foolishly. And
  something else moved, too&mdash;a great black form that flitted between them
  peering and examining. Twice did I see it, and the second time I forced
  myself back to reality.</p>

  <p>It was the negro, and he seemed intensely interested in
  everything&mdash;almost childishly so. He touched stone after stone with his
  fingers. Then he picked up one of the little blocks that I had noticed, and
  examined it closely, grunting under his breath.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he straightened up and stood listening. Then with a quick
  movement he replaced the block, and vanished behind me just as the door into
  the hall opened and Paul came in. He crossed to my stone and stood looking
  down at me, while I feigned sleep. And after a time he too began to stroll
  round amongst the other stones.</p>

  <p>He examined each of the blocks, and the cords that ran from them. And as I
  watched him out of the corner of my eye I noticed a thing I had missed
  before. On the altar stone was a little black box, and all the cords appeared
  to lead to it. He seemed particularly interested in that box, but in the bad
  light I couldn't see what he was doing. At length, however, he put it down,
  and lighting a cigarette once more came and stood in front of me. I looked up
  at him dully.</p>

  <p>"You really are the most congenital ass I've ever met, Mr Seymour," he
  said pleasantly. "Did you honestly think Charles would let you go?"</p>

  <p>"I've given up trying to think in this mad house," I retorted. "When is
  this ridiculous farce going to end?"</p>

  <p>He made no reply for a while, but just stood staring at me thoughtfully.
  "I really am rather interested in you," he said at length. "It would be most
  devilish funny if you really have got nothing to do with them."</p>

  <p>"I've already told you that I don't know what you are talking about," I
  cried. "You're making a fearful mistake. I don't know who you mean by
  them."</p>

  <p>He began to chuckle. "'Pon my soul," he said, "I'm almost beginning to
  think that you don't. Which makes the jest excessively rich."</p>

  <p>"A positive scream," I agreed sarcastically. "Would it be too much to hope
  that I might be permitted to share it?"</p>

  <p>"I fear," he answered, "that you might not quite appreciate it."</p>

  <p>He continued to chuckle immoderately.</p>

  <p>"You will in time, I promise you," he went on. "And then you will see how
  terribly funny it all is. I must say," he continued seriously, almost more to
  himself than to me, "I did think yesterday that you and the butterfly
  gentleman were mixed up in it."</p>

  <p>"I wish to Heaven," I said wearily, "that you would realize that I haven't
  the remotest idea what you're talking about. And I further wish you to be
  under no delusions as to what I'm going to do when I do manage to get out of
  this place."</p>

  <p>He started laughing again. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "Don't, I
  beg of you, terrify me too much!"</p>

  <p>I stuck to it good and hard. Useless it might be, but at any rate it was
  better than nothing. "I shall go straight to the police," I said, "and lodge
  a summons against you for assault and battery. And as for that cursed ruffian
  upstairs..."</p>

  <p>"Poor Charles," he remarked. "You dotted him one with the teapot all
  right. Well, thank you for your kindly warning. You'll have some other
  privileged spectators coming to join you soon&mdash;three of them." He
  strolled to the door, and looked back as he reached it. "I can keep no
  secrets from you, bank clerk," he said. "You have an indefinable attraction
  for me. Do you see those little blocks in the seats?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said.</p>

  <p>"There is one in yours, just behind you."</p>

  <p>"I've felt it already," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, be very careful how you feel it," he said gently. "Do nothing rough
  with it. Treat it as a mother treats a sickly child&mdash;gently and
  tenderly. Because it happens to be gun-cotton. Admittedly a safe
  explosive&mdash;but one never knows."</p>

  <p>For a moment I was absolutely speechless.</p>

  <p>"Gun-cotton," I stammered at length. "Good God! man&mdash;are you
  joking?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it," he said. "But I can assure you that there's no chance of it
  going off&mdash;yet." He smiled genially. "The fact of the matter is, bank
  clerk, that you have butted your head into some rather dirty work. I don't
  mind admitting that there are moments when I think it is almost too dirty.
  But "&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"when the ladies get ideas in
  their charming heads, who are we to gainsay them?"</p>

  <p>"If by the ladies you allude to that partially demented female who was
  talking such infernal rot last night," I said grimly, "I'll tell you one idea
  that she has got wedged in hers. She's got about as much use for you as a
  Cockney has for a haggis."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," he said softly, but I noticed that, of a sudden,
  he was standing very still.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll make myself clearer," I remarked. "You cut no ice with her,
  Paul: she loathes the sight of your face. I watched her last night when you
  were pulling out the knee clutching business, and her expression was that of
  one who contemplates a bad egg from close range."</p>

  <p>"You are pleased to be insolent, Mr Seymour." He was still standing
  motionless by the door.</p>

  <p>"I am pleased to be nothing, you flat-headed skate," I answered. It struck
  me that a little of Drummond's vocabulary might assist. "But if you imagine
  that after you've done whatever fool tricks you are going to do you're then
  going to land the beauteous lady you're making the deuce of an error. Nothing
  doing, Paul: you can take my word for it."</p>

  <p>"But for the fact," he remarked after a time, "that the death you are
  going to die is such a particular choice one, I would strangle you here and
  now for those words."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't alter the fact that she loathes the sight of your face, laddie,"
  I mocked. "And I certainly don't blame her."</p>

  <p>He sprang across the room towards me, and I don't think I have ever seen
  such a look of demoniacal rage on any man's face before. In fact, but for the
  interruption, I believe he would have carried out his threat. As it was he
  managed to control himself with a monstrous effort as the door opened and the
  woman herself came in.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Paul," she cried. "They are coming&mdash;the three of them.
  Where's Pedro? Charles is here but we want the nigger. And gag that fool of a
  clerk."</p>

  <p>He stuffed a gag into my mouth, and glared at me. "One sound, and I'll
  knife you," he muttered. "Pedro!" He looked over my shoulder. "Where is the
  damned fool?" he said irritably. "I've hardly seen him the whole day?
  Pedro!"</p>

  <p>There was a guttural grunt, and then the huge nigger shambled past me. His
  head was down, and in the dim light he looked a terrifying sight.</p>

  <p>"Get behind the curtains, Pedro. And don't kill. We want them alive in the
  chairs. Charles&mdash;get the other side of the door."</p>

  <p>Sick with anxiety I waited. Could nothing be done to warn them? They were
  walking straight into the trap, and suddenly the full realization of our
  position seemed to strike me. All very well to gain a little cheap
  satisfaction by taunting the man over his love affair, but it didn't alter
  the fact that once these three men were caught the odds against us were
  wellnigh hopeless. Drummond couldn't fight half a dozen men, especially when
  two of them had the strength of the negro and the one called Charles.</p>

  <p>The woman had left the room: the three men were hiding behind the
  curtains, so to all appearances except for myself it was empty. And then I
  heard Darrell's voice in the hall.</p>

  <p>"So we meet again, madame," he said gravely. "As you probably know we have
  come without informing any one, trusting that you will keep your side of the
  bargain."</p>

  <p>"Quite like old times seeing you," she answered. "And Mr Jerningham and Mr
  Longworth, too."</p>

  <p>"Shall we cut the conversation, madame?" he remarked. "At your instigation
  three men&mdash;one of whom was Hugh himself&mdash;have been foully murdered.
  So you will pardon me if I say that the sooner you hand Mrs Drummond over to
  us the better I shall be pleased. In your letter you said that your revenge
  was sufficient. Let us then be done with it."</p>

  <p>"We seem much milder than of yore," she mocked.</p>

  <p>"You have Mrs Drummond in your power," he said simply. "We have no
  alternative. Well, madame, we are waiting."</p>

  <p>"Yes, mes amis, you are right," she answered after a pause. "We will be
  done with it. You shall have Phyllis. And believe me I am almost sorry now
  that I ever started it. Moods change. A few weeks ago there was nothing I
  desired more than the deaths of all of you. Today I regret the Mere. Come
  this way."</p>

  <p>"One moment, madame. Does she know that her husband is dead?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she does not. Mr Darrell, it is easy to say, I know, but I wish
  he were not."</p>

  <p>"A pity you didn't think of that a little earlier, madame," he said
  grimly. "Where are we to go? Why cannot Mrs Drummond be handed over to us in
  this hall?"</p>

  <p>"You will soon see why," she answered, appearing in the door. "Besides I
  particularly want to show you all this room."</p>

  <p>I gave an agonized guttural choke but it was no good. As she had doubtless
  anticipated they paused inside the door, completely taken off their guard by
  the strangeness of their surroundings.</p>

  <p>"What on earth," began Jerningham, and even as he spoke the three hidden
  men sprang on them.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds it was all over. Paul had a revolver in Jerningham's
  neck. Charles gave the same attention to Darrell. And poor little Algy
  Longworth was the negro's share. He was merely picked up like a kicking baby
  and deposited in a seat. Then the steel bars were turned and he sat there
  glowering.</p>

  <p>"You damned dirty nigger," he shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>"Silence, you little rat," said Irma. "Get the other two fixed. Shoot,
  Paul, if they give any trouble."</p>

  <p>But the muzzle of a revolver in the nape of a man's neck is a good
  preventer of trouble, and soon the four of us were sitting there like trussed
  birds.</p>

  <p>"So it was a trick, was it?" said Darrell quietly.</p>

  <p>The woman began to shake with laughter.</p>

  <p>"You fools," she cried, "you brainless fools. Did you really imagine that
  I was going to hand Phyllis over to you and let you walk out of the house.
  You must be mad."</p>

  <p>She turned on Charles and the nigger.</p>

  <p>"Go! Get out! But be around in case I want you. Paul&mdash;you can ungag
  the bank clerk."</p>

  <p>Her glance roved from one to the other of us.</p>

  <p>"Four," she said musingly. "And there should have been six. You see,
  Darrell, that there are six seats prepared for your reception."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were beginning to glitter feverishly, and as she stood in the
  centre of the room her body swayed gracefully from side to side as if she was
  dancing. To me it was not unexpected, but the other three were staring at her
  in amazement. As yet they had not seen one of her outbursts.</p>

  <p>"Still we must make do with four, I suppose," she went on. "Unless, Paul,
  we sent out for two more. No&mdash;better not. Let us keep our final meeting
  as intimate as possible. And we already have one stranger."</p>

  <p>"Where is Phyllis Drummond?" said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at him dreamily.</p>

  <p>"Phyllis is waiting." she answered. "For days she has been waiting for you
  to come, and now very soon she will join you."</p>

  <p>"And what then," snapped Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Why then, mon ami, you shall all go on a journey together. A long
  journey. Ah! if only Hugh was here: if only my circle was complete. Then
  indeed the reunion would be a wonderful one."</p>

  <p>And now the crazy glitter in her eyes grew more pronounced till I
  marvelled that the man called Paul could ever have hoped for any return for
  his love. The woman was frankly crazy, and stealing a glance at him I saw
  that he was staring at her with a dawning horror in his face.</p>

  <p>"Carissima," he muttered. "I beseech of you, do not excite yourself."</p>

  <p>"But as it is we shall have to make do with four." Her voice had risen.
  "Four instead of six. And the principal guest not here. Why&mdash;the whole
  lot of you could go if only Drummond was here. But I did my best,
  Carl&mdash;I did my best."</p>

  <p>She had turned to the altar stone, and was speaking to it.</p>

  <p>"I did my best, beloved&mdash;I did my best. And his end was not unworthy.
  Gassed&mdash;and drowned like a rat in a trap."</p>

  <p>She threw herself across the stone, her arms outstretched, and for a space
  there was silence in the darkening room. Then abruptly she rose and swept to
  the door.</p>

  <p>"At nine o'clock, Paul, we will begin."</p>

  <p>"Look here," I said when she had gone, "Paul&mdash;or whatever your name
  is&mdash;what is the good of going on with this?"</p>

  <p>He stared at me dully.</p>

  <p>"The woman is clean plumb crazy. She is as mad as a hatter. So what are
  you going to get out of it? You can't marry a mad woman: you can't even make
  love to her."</p>

  <p>He muttered something unintelligible under his breath.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, man," I went on urgently, "pull yourself together. Set us
  free, and let us go."</p>

  <p>"She'll be all right&mdash;after," he said at length. "Quite all
  right&mdash;after." He turned towards the door, and in desperation I played
  my last card.</p>

  <p>"You poor ass," I cried, "there isn't going to be an after for her. When
  she has finished us, she's going to commit suicide. And whatever you choose
  to do with a lunatic, you're stung good and strong with a corpse."</p>

  <p>It was no good. He opened the door and went out. In fact I doubt if he
  even heard what I said, and with a feeling of sick despair I looked at the
  others.</p>

  <p>"So they haven't spotted you, Dixon," said Darrell in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," I answered. "I don't think it ever dawned on them that I was
  one of the three they think were drowned at the Mere. But, for a while they
  suspected me of being another member of the bunch&mdash;a new one. Then Mrs
  Drummond rode them off."</p>

  <p>"You've seen her?" said Jerningham eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Last night," I said. "She was brought down here blindfolded and suddenly
  confronted with me. And there was no mistake about her failure to identify me
  being genuine. Not that it matters much," I went on gloomily. "We're
  hopelessly for it unless Drummond can do something. Why in Heaven's name did
  you fellows walk into it so easily?"</p>

  <p>"Because he told us to," answered Darrell calmly.</p>

  <p>"Told you to," I echoed in amazement.</p>

  <p>"A short note," he said. "Just&mdash;Follow the messenger&mdash;all three
  of you. Be surprised at nothing. And tell Dixon that he must not reveal my
  identity until he hears the Anthem whistled once."</p>

  <p>"He knows I'm here?" I cried. "But I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Frankly&mdash;no more do I," said Algy. "What's this damned stone
  quarry?"</p>

  <p>"It's a model," I said, "of Stonehenge. Look here, you fellows, I'll tell
  you all I know. I can pretend that we are strangers if anyone comes in. But
  there is no reason why we shouldn't talk in view of the position we are
  in&mdash;its most damnably serious."</p>

  <p>"Fire ahead," said Jerningham quietly.</p>

  <p>I told them everything; what I knew, and what I only suspected. I told
  them of the dead man at Stonehenge, and the scene of the night before. And
  they listened with consternation growing on their faces.</p>

  <p>"It was our last hope," I said, "trying to make that man realize she was
  mad. But he's wild about her&mdash;absolutely wild."</p>

  <p>"You really think she's going to commit suicide," said Darrell
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I do," I answered. "Though the point is of academic interest only as far
  as we are concerned. She is going to do all of us in first."</p>

  <p>"Man&mdash;but it's a fearful risk." said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," I cried, "that she doesn't care a damn about the risk.
  What does the risk matter to her if she's going to join Carl, as she thinks,
  after? And that poor fish, Paul, is so infatuated with her that he is
  prepared to run any risk to get her."</p>

  <p>We argued it from every angle whilst the room grew darker and darker. To
  them the only thing that mattered was that Drummond had told them to come:
  that Drummond had something up his sleeve. But try as I would, I couldn't
  share their optimism. What could he do alone&mdash;or at best with Toby
  Sinclair to help him? The odds were altogether too heavy. Had we all been
  free it would have been different. Then we could have put up a good show. As
  it was the thing seemed hopeless to me. And yet he had deliberately told
  these three to walk into the trap. It was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>It appeared that they had not seen him, but had only received the note.
  And the previous night Algy Longworth had also got a note which explained his
  movements to me. It had contained instructions to the effect that he was to
  announce publicly his intention of going to Stonehenge after dinner, that as
  he valued his life he was not to go but was to take a walk in the opposite
  direction.</p>

  <p>"If I had gone," he said, "I suppose I should have shared the fate of the
  poor devil you saw dead. I wonder who he was."</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," I remarked. "He was a complete stranger to me. But he
  was undoubtedly murdered by that foul brute of a nigger."</p>

  <p>Conversation became desultory. All our nerves were getting frayed. The
  light had almost gone; we were just vague shapes to one another as we sat
  there fastened to those fantastic stones, waiting for nine o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it," burst out Jerningham once. "Damn it&mdash;it's like
  a nightmare."</p>

  <p>No one answered; only the throaty chuckle that I had heard before came
  from somewhere behind me. "It's the nigger," grunted Darrell. "Get out, you
  filthy brute."</p>

  <p>He chuckled again, and then like some monstrous misshapen animal he began
  to shamble round the room. I could just see him in the darkness peering first
  at one thing and then at another. He went to the two unoccupied seats and
  began fiddling with the mechanism that moved the two curved steel bars. He
  worked it several times, chuckling to himself like a child, and suddenly came
  Jerningham's voice strained and tense.</p>

  <p>"Come and do that to my chair, nigger. I'll give you some cigarettes and
  money if you do."</p>

  <p>But the black man took no notice. He had transferred his attentions now to
  the black box that lay upon the altar stone. That occupied him for a long
  while, and all the time the throaty chuckling continued. Every now and then
  came the chink of tin on stone: then, as silently as he had come, he vanished
  again.</p>

  <p>It was the suspense of waiting that was so appalling, and I began to long
  for nine o'clock. A mood of dull resignation had come over me. I felt I
  simply didn't care. Anything&mdash;so long as they got on with it. And as if
  in answer to my thoughts the door leading into the hall slowly opened, and a
  clock outside began to chime.</p>

  <p>"Nine," muttered somebody.</p>

  <p>The final act was about to begin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; IN WHICH WE HAVE A REHEARSAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I think my main feeling was one of intense curiosity. There
  was no light in the hall, but a faint lessening of the general darkness
  marked the door. For a time nothing happened, then something white appeared
  in the opening, and the room was flooded with light.</p>

  <p>The woman Irma was standing there clad in the same white garment she had
  worn the preceding night. Behind her hovered Paul&mdash;his face more
  saturnine than ever, but it was on her that all our attention was
  concentrated. In her hands she held some largish object which was covered
  with a silken cloth, and after a while she advanced to the altar stone and
  placed it there reverently. Then she removed the wrap, and I saw that it was
  a full size plaster cast of a man's head.</p>

  <p>"Dashed if it isn't our late lamented Carl," muttered Darrell.</p>

  <p>The woman took no notice, she was staring intently at the cast. Once or
  twice her lips moved, but I heard no words, and for a time her hands were
  clasped in front of her as if in prayer. Then quite suddenly she turned her
  back on the altar and began to speak, whilst we watched her fascinated.</p>

  <p>"A few months ago," she said, "I stood beside the wreckage of Wilmot's
  giant airship, and over the charred body of my man I swore an oath. That oath
  will be finally fulfilled tonight."</p>

  <p>Her voice was quiet and conversational.</p>

  <p>"But for an accident last night&mdash;a mistake on the part of one of my
  servants&mdash;I should not have sent you three the note I did. But Pedro,
  whom you have doubtless seen, killed a man at Stonehenge, and that
  necessitated a hastening in my plans. Why did you not go to Stonehenge,
  Longworth?"</p>

  <p>"Got hiccoughs after dinner, darling," said Algy cheerfully. "Tell me, my
  poppet, is that a new line in nightdresses?"</p>

  <p>And just as Paul became livid with rage when I had jeered at him that
  morning, so now did the woman turn white to the lips with passion.</p>

  <p>"You dog," she screamed. "How dare you? Strike him, Paul&mdash;strike him
  across the face."</p>

  <p>Then she controlled herself.</p>

  <p>"Stay," she said in a calmer voice. "He is not worth it. I will
  continue&mdash;for there is much to say. But for that accident, I
  might&mdash;in fact I think I would&mdash;have given you one further clue.
  And yet I do not know: the game in very truth had begun to pall since
  Drummond died. You were only the puppies that followed your master. He was
  the one I wanted&mdash;not you. However, it was not to be, and because the
  finish comes tonight I thought that Phyllis should have you with her as she
  cannot have her husband. As yet she does not know that you are here: she does
  not even know her husband is dead. That she shall learn later&mdash;just
  before the end."</p>

  <p>She paused, and I saw that Darrell was moistening his lips with his
  tongue, and that Jerningham's face was white. There was something far more
  terrifying in this calm matter of fact voice than if she had ranted and
  raved.</p>

  <p>"This fourth man," she continued, "this bank clerk presented a conundrum.
  Believe me, sir," she turned to me, "I have no enmity against you. It is a
  sheer misfortune that you should be here, but since you are, you've got to
  stay."</p>

  <p>"Please don't apologize," I said sarcastically. "Your treatment of your
  guest has left nothing to be desired."</p>

  <p>But she seemed to have forgotten my existence: her real audience consisted
  of the other three.</p>

  <p>"The Friar's Heel," she remarked. "You solved that quicker than I thought
  you would. And here you are. This gentleman has doubtless already told you
  that these stones form a model of Stonehenge. And you wonder why I should
  have taken so much trouble. I will tell you.</p>

  <p>"Revenge is sweet, but to taste of its joys to the utmost, to extract from
  it the last drop of satisfaction, it must be as carefully planned as any
  other entertainment. That is why I regret so bitterly that it was Drummond
  himself who died at the Mere. I like to think of him struggling in that
  room&mdash;struggling to breathe&mdash;and knowing all the time that it was I
  who had done it. But I would far sooner have had him here; because he has
  escaped the supreme thing I planned for him."</p>

  <p>With one hand outstretched she stood facing the other three.</p>

  <p>"He killed my man. You know it. You cannot deny it."</p>

  <p>"If by that you mean he killed Carl Peterson, I do not deny it," said
  Darrell calmly. "And no man ever deserved death more richly."</p>

  <p>"Deserved death!" Her voice rose. "Who are you, you dogs, to pronounce
  judgment on such a man?" With an effort she controlled herself. "However, we
  will not bandy words. He killed my man&mdash;even as I shall shortly kill his
  woman."</p>

  <p>She fell silent for a while staring at the plaster cast, and I saw
  Darrell's anxious eyes roving round the room. They met mine for a moment, and
  he shrugged his shoulders helplessly. It was out now: there was no bluff
  about it. Death was in sight, and the manner of it seemed of but little
  account. Death&mdash;unless...</p>

  <p>Feverishly I stared around. Death, unless Drummond intervened. I looked up
  at the roof, remembering the sailor of the night before. But this time it was
  empty. And all the time the man called Paul stood watching the woman with
  sombre eyes.</p>

  <p>"It has not been very easy, Darrell." She was speaking again. "My servants
  have blundered. Mistakes have been made. But from the moment she fell into my
  hands the final issue has never been in doubt. I might have had to forego
  this. I might even have had to forego getting the lot of you. But her life
  has been forfeit since that moment. I have played with her at times, letting
  her think that she would be free if you found her, and she, stupid little
  fool, has believed me. Free!" She laughed. "There have been times when only
  the greatest restraint has prevented me killing her with my own hands. And
  now I am glad, for I would like you to see her die."</p>

  <p>"Carissima," said the man called Paul, "is it wise to delay? All has gone
  so well up to now, and I fear something may happen."</p>

  <p>"What can happen," she said calmly, "who can interrupt us? The time has
  passed when there was danger of surprise. Your police, Darrell, are stickers.
  And although I did not think you would enlist their aid, there was the little
  matter of the blood in the ditch. I felicitated dear Phyllis on that. Paul
  tells me that she practically killed him with one blow of that heavy
  spanner&mdash;naughty girl."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake get on with it, woman," said Jerningham harshly.</p>

  <p>"The essence of satisfactory revenge, my friend," she remarked, "is not to
  hurry. The night is yet young."</p>

  <p>I closed my eyes. The powerful gleaming lights against the black made me
  drowsy. It was a dream all this&mdash;it must be. In a few moments I should
  awake, and see my own familiar room.</p>

  <p>"What think you of the setting of my revenge?" From a great distance her
  voice came to me, and I forced myself back to reality again.
  "Stonehenge&mdash;in miniature. Theatrical&mdash;perhaps. But the story
  fascinates me. And because in this year of grace the real place cannot be
  used it was necessary to make a model." With brooding eyes she stared in
  front of her. "We will rehearse it once, Paul. I am in the mood. Turn out the
  lights."</p>

  <p>"Carissima," he protested, "is it wise?"</p>

  <p>"Turn out the lights," she said curtly, and with a muttered oath he
  obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I am in a strange mood tonight," Her voice&mdash;low and
  throbbing&mdash;came to us out of the darkness. "It is true that I have
  rehearsed it before, that I know exactly every effect. But I would postpone
  it awhile. Besides it may be that you, who will watch the real performance,
  can suggest something at the rehearsal. Think well, you watchers: use your
  imagination, for only thus will you appreciate my plan.</p>

  <p>"Night. Darkness such as this. Around us on the grass a multitude who
  wait."</p>

  <p>I sat up stiffly: was it imagination or had something passed close to my
  chair?</p>

  <p>"They wait in silence, whispering perhaps amongst themselves of what is
  about to happen. They have seen it before&mdash;many times, but the mystery
  of what they are about to see and the wonder of it never palls.</p>

  <p>"Darkness&mdash;and then in the east the faint light that comes before the
  dawn. Look!"</p>

  <p>It was clever&mdash;damnably clever. How the lights had been arranged to
  give the effect I cannot say, but at the end of the room behind the Friar's
  Heel there came a faint luminosity. It was more a general lessening of the
  darkness than anything else, and one could just see the outlines of the
  stones against it.</p>

  <p>"A murmur like a wave beating on the shore&mdash;then silence once again.
  A gentle breeze, faint scented with the smell of country kisses their faces,
  and is gone, whilst all the time the dawn comes nearer: the tense expectancy
  increases."</p>

  <p>I couldn't help it. I was fascinated in spite of myself. My reason told me
  that all these elaborate preparations were nothing more nor less than the
  preliminaries to cold-blooded murder. And yet, theatrical though they might
  be, and were, they were also artistically impressive. I remember that I found
  myself thinking what a marvellous stage effect it would be.</p>

  <p>Gradually the light behind the Friar's Heel increased, and then the woman
  began to sing. Her voice was small but true, and she sang in a tongue I did
  not know. It was a wild barbaric thing that sounded like one of those bizarre
  Magyar folk songs. And the effect was incredible. I found myself sweating
  with sheer excitement, all danger forgotten; and the others said after they
  had felt the same. The light grew brighter: her song wilder and more
  triumphant. And then suddenly she ceased.</p>

  <p>"It comes," she cried. "The god comes. And as the first rays fall on the
  slaughter stone, and the woman who lies there, the sacrifice is made."</p>

  <p>Out of the lessening darkness came a rim of golden light. It appeared
  behind the Friar's Heel, and gradually grew larger and larger, even as the
  sun appears above the horizon, a yellow ball of electric light being raised
  slowly on a winding gear. So said reason. But imagination saw the scene of
  countless centuries ago.</p>

  <p>"The shadows shorten," she whispered. "Soon they will reach the slaughter
  stone and pass it by. This time there is no victim&mdash;but next.... My God!
  What's that?"</p>

  <p>Her voice rose to a sudden shrill cry, and for a while we all stared
  stupidly. For now the slaughter stone was bathed in light, and on its smooth
  surface was a gruesome object. One end was red with dried up blood, and the
  other had a nail.</p>

  <p>The man called Paul moved slowly towards it.</p>

  <p>"It's a man's finger," he muttered, and his voice was shaking.</p>

  <p>"A man's finger," repeated the woman. "But how did it get there? How did
  it get there?" she screamed. "How did it get there, you fool?"</p>

  <p>And Paul could give no answer.</p>

  <p>"A man's finger," she said once more, and glancing at her I saw that every
  drop of blood had drained from her face. "Where is Grant?"</p>

  <p>"Grant," said Paul stupidly. "Why do you want Grant?"</p>

  <p>"Drummond shot his finger off," she answered. "In the room below the Mere.
  Get him. Get him, you wretched fool, at once."</p>

  <p>"But will you be all right," he began, and again from behind me came a
  throaty chuckle. "Great Scott! the butterfly man."</p>

  <p>I turned round. Sure enough there was Toby Sinclair, powerless in the
  hands of the negro. The mystery of the finger was explained.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" he cried, "this is an outrage."</p>

  <p>"Put him in a seat, Pedro," said the woman, and Toby was forced into the
  chair next to mine.</p>

  <p>"If it isn't Mr Seymour," he fumed angrily. "Are these people mad? Is this
  place a lunatic asylum?"</p>

  <p>He subsided into angry mutterings, and I said nothing. For now I was too
  excited to speak. It was evident that the game was beginning in grim
  earnest.</p>

  <p>"Get Grant," said the woman, and Paul left the room.</p>

  <p>She stood motionless leaning against the altar stone whilst that damnable
  nigger shambled round the room and then disappeared again. Toby Sinclair
  still continued to curse audibly, and the other three stared in front of them
  with eyes bright with anticipation. What was going to happen next? Once
  Sinclair stole a glance at me and winked, and I must confess that wink
  heartened me considerably. Because even now I saw very little light in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and Paul came in followed by the man with the damaged
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Grant," said the woman quietly, "is that your finger?"</p>

  <p>He gave a violent start: then he picked it up with a trembling hand. "It
  is," he muttered foolishly. "At least, I&mdash;I think it is. It must
  be."</p>

  <p>"Do you recognize any of these men?" she went on.</p>

  <p>"I recognize those three," he stammered, and Darrell nodded
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"A little morning exercise by the waters of the Mere," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"And what of the others?" she said.</p>

  <p>He looked at Toby and me, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've seen them," he said. "At Amesbury. And I thought "&mdash;he looked
  sideways at Paul&mdash;"I thought. The boss," he went on sullenly, "said that
  I was to say nothing about them."</p>

  <p>For a moment she stared at Paul with a look of such concentrated cold fury
  that I almost felt sorry for the man. After all, swine though he was, he did
  love her, and had only embarked on this affair for her sake. But what she was
  going to say to him we shall never know, for at that moment there came a
  diversion.</p>

  <p>The man with the damaged hand had suddenly come very close to me and was
  peering into my face. Then with a quick movement he seized my moustache and
  tore it off.</p>

  <p>"God in Heavens!" he muttered, "it's one of them. One of the three that
  were drowned."</p>

  <p>A dead silence settled on the room, which was at last broken by Toby.
  "What about Opsiphanes syme?" he burbled genially.</p>

  <p>Another dead silence, broken this time by the woman. "So Drummond is not
  dead," she said softly. "How very interesting."</p>

  <p>"I seem to recall," drawled Jerningham pleasantly, "in those dear days of
  long ago, that our lamented friend whose repulsive visage adorns the altar
  had frequent necessity to remark the same thing."</p>

  <p>And then Paul spoke with sudden fear in his voice. "It's a trap. An
  obvious trap. He's probably got the police with him."</p>

  <p>"There wasn't a soul outside when I came in," said Grant. "There hasn't
  been a thing past the gate since eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Go out," said the woman, "and mount guard again. Paul&mdash;fetch
  Phyllis."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he seemed on the point of arguing with her: then he
  thought better of it and both of them left the room.</p>

  <p>"So you are Sinclair," she said, coming over to Toby.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, sweet girl of mine," he answered. "And how have we been
  keeping since our last merry meeting?"</p>

  <p>"All of you except Drummond." She was talking half to herself. "Helpless:
  at my mercy."</p>

  <p>A triumphant smile was on her lips, and as it seemed to me with justice.
  It exactly expressed the situation, and now that the momentary excitement of
  the finger episode had worn off I began to feel gloomier than ever. It was
  all very well for the others to be flippant, but unless they were completely
  blind to obvious realities it could only be due to bravado. We were
  absolutely in this woman's power, there was no other way of looking at it.
  That their mood might be due to a blind unquestioning faith in Drummond's
  ability was also possible, but unless he came with four or five exceptionally
  powerful men to help him, this was going to be a case of the pitcher going to
  the well once too often. For what none of them seemed to realize was the fact
  that this woman was careless of her own life. There lay the incredible
  danger. Discovery meant nothing to her provided her revenge had come
  first.</p>

  <p>I came out of my reverie to find Darrell's eyes fixed on me. "Learnt that
  tune yet, Dixon?" he said.</p>

  <p>Toby Sinclair was humming the Froth Blower's Anthem, and I nodded. I was
  free now to give Drummond away, but what earthly good it was going to be
  heaven alone knew.</p>

  <p>"A new recruit, dear Irma," went on Darrell. "You will be pleased to know
  that it was he who solved most of your clues."</p>

  <p>She turned her strange brooding eyes on me. "How did you get out of the
  Mere," she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"A little substitution," I remarked. "The gentleman you left below arrived
  too soon, and then I sat on the water handle by mistake."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," she said. "The audience will now be complete."</p>

  <p>"Think so," said Jerningham mockingly. "One seat, and a rather important
  one, still remains to be occupied."</p>

  <p>"It is possible that it may remain unoccupied," she said enigmatically.
  "Good evening, Phyllis. Your husband's friends have all arrived, as you
  see."</p>

  <p>Mrs Drummond stared round with a wan little smile. "Hullo! chaps," she
  said. "Where's Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows, Phyllis," answered Darrell. "We don't."</p>

  <p>"He will come," said Mrs Drummond calmly. "Don't worry."</p>

  <p>"You think so," answered Irma. "Good. And anyway why should you worry.
  Whether he comes, or whether he doesn't, the result as far as you are
  concerned will be the same. In fact I am not sure that my revenge would not
  be all the sweeter if he didn't come&mdash;until too late." Once more she was
  leaning against the altar stone, with one hand resting on the bust of Carl
  Peterson. "Imagine his feelings for the rest of his life if he arrived to
  find you all dead, knowing that at last he had failed you."</p>

  <p>"May I remind you once again of the number of times we have heard remarks
  of a similar nature from your late lamented&mdash;er&mdash;husband&mdash;"
  said Jerningham with a yawn.</p>

  <p>"And may I remind you," she answered, "of my original little verse to
  Drummond concerning the Female of the Species. I shall wait a little, and
  then we will proceed. Should he come in the interval I shall be delighted for
  him to participate in our little ceremony. Should he fail to appear he will
  not. He will merely find the results. And should he be so injudicious as not
  to come alone he will encounter two locked doors, doors which will take even
  him some time to knock down. He will hear you screaming for help inside
  here&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice rose: her breast heaved: she was tasting of her triumph in
  advance.</p>

  <p>"Bonzo's meat cubes are highly recommended for preserving a placid
  disposition," said Algy brightly. "You'll split a stay lace, my angel woman,
  unless you're careful."</p>

  <p>"Why do we delay, dear one?" said Paul anxiously. "Let us be done with it
  now, and leave him to find what he will find."</p>

  <p>But she shook her head. "No: we will give him half an hour. And if he is
  not here by then..."</p>

  <p>I thought furiously: every moment gained might be an advantage. "How is he
  to know anything about it," I said. "If he is where I last saw him, he is in
  Amesbury. And it will take more than half an hour get a messenger to him and
  for him to reach here."</p>

  <p>She looked at me thoughtfully. "Is he also disguised like you and
  Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"He is," I said shortly. "He has a large black beard...."</p>

  <p>"You fool," howled Sinclair. "You damned treacherous fool. My God! We're
  done."</p>

  <p>I stared at him stupidly, and a sudden deadly sick feeling came over me.
  "But," I stammered, "I thought..."</p>

  <p>I looked across helplessly at Darrell. What had I said? Surely the message
  was clear, to say who he was after I heard the anthem once.</p>

  <p>"I could kill you where you sit, you cur," went on Sinclair idly, "if only
  I had my hands free."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have said the wrong thing, Mr Dixon," said Irma pleasantly.
  "So dear Hugh is disguised in a large black beard, is he? I don't think I
  should like Hugh in a black beard. Well, well! I wonder what little amusement
  he has in store for us. We will certainly wait, Paul, until he arrives. I
  couldn't bear to miss him in a black beard."</p>

  <p>"He had a scheme," said Sinclair furiously to the other three. "An
  absolute winner. But everything depended on his disguise. You fool, Dixon:
  you fool."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Toby," said Mrs Drummond peremptorily. "I'm sure Mr Dixon didn't
  mean to do any harm, and anyway&mdash;" she turned to me&mdash;"thank you a
  hundred times for all you've been through on my behalf."</p>

  <p>I looked at her gratefully, though I was too much upset to speak. I simply
  couldn't understand the thing. Evidently Drummond had altered his plans since
  he'd sent the message through Darrell. But if so&mdash;and he didn't want me
  to comply with his first instructions&mdash;why hadn't he sent countermanding
  orders through Sinclair? And after a while I began to feel angry: the man was
  a damned fool. From beginning to end he had bungled every single thing. It
  was I who had borne the burden and heat of the whole show. And what possible
  hope had he got of deceiving anybody with that absurd false beard?</p>

  <p>"And have you any idea if our friend is coming soon?" pursued Irma
  sweetly. "Or shall we send a note to Amesbury, addressed to Mr
  Blackbeard?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry," said Sinclair sullenly. "He's coming all right."</p>

  <p>He glowered vindictively at me, and I glowered back at him. I was
  absolutely fed up&mdash;so fed up that I almost forgot what was in store for
  us. Of all the bungling, incompetent set of fools that I had ever known this
  much vaunted gang won in a canter. And their so-called leader was the worst
  of the lot.</p>

  <p>My mind went back to Bill Tracey's remarks about him and the extraordinary
  things he had done. I'd tell Bill the truth when I next saw him. I'd put him
  wise. And then my stomach gave a sick heave: I should never see Bill again.
  The sweat poured down me. My anger had gone&mdash;reality had returned. In a
  short while this astounding farce would be over, and I should be dead.</p>

  <p>The room swam before me. I could only see the faces of the others through
  a mist. Dead! We should all be dead. By a monstrous effort I bit back a wild
  desire to shout and rave. That would be the unforgivable sin in front of this
  crowd. They might lack brains, but they didn't lack courage. I pulled myself
  together and stared at them. Boredom was the only emotion they
  displayed&mdash;boredom and contempt. This foul woman could kill them all
  right: she could never make them whimper. "I'm damned sorry," I said
  suddenly. "But for God's sake don't think it was treachery."</p>

  <p>For a moment no one spoke. Then&mdash;"Sorry I said that," said Toby
  gruffly. "Withdraw it and all that sort of rot."</p>

  <p>Silence fell again: the only movement was Paul's restless fidgeting. The
  woman still leaned gracefully against the altar stone. Mrs Drummond sat
  motionless, staring at the door.</p>

  <p>"He will probably be coming soon, Paul," said Irma suddenly. "And it would
  be better not to give him any warning. Gag them."</p>

  <p>"What about the girl?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Gag her as well, and put her in the vacant chair for a time."</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me you foul swine," said Mrs Drummond coldly. "I will go
  there."</p>

  <p>"And then when dear Hugh comes," said Irma, "he shall take your place,
  Phyllis. Whilst you will be placed elsewhere."</p>

  <p>She clenched her hands, and for a moment the feverish glitter returned to
  her eyes. Then she grew calm again.</p>

  <p>"Now turn out all the lights except the one at the end."</p>

  <p>And so for perhaps ten minutes we sat there waiting. Once I heard Pedro's
  throaty chuckle that seemed to come from the passage leading to the garage:
  and once I thought I heard the sound of a car on the road outside. Otherwise
  the silence was absolute.</p>

  <p>Through the open skylight I could see the stars, and I began wondering
  what had become of the sailor. Somewhere about the house I supposed: one of
  the infamous gang. And then I started to wonder how Drummond would come.</p>

  <p>Should I suddenly see his bearded face peering through at us&mdash;
  covering the woman with a revolver? But the stars still shone undimmed by any
  shadow, and after a while my brain refused to act. My arm was throbbing
  abominably. My thoughts began to wander.</p>

  <p>I was back in my club, and the woman Irma was the Wine Steward. It was
  absurd that I couldn't get a drink before eleven o'clock in the morning in my
  own club. A fatuous wartime regulation that should be repealed. I'd write to
  my MP about it. Everybody ought to write to their MP about it. Here was that
  doddering ass old Axminster coming in. Thought he owned the place because he
  was a peer.... What was he saying? I listened&mdash;and suddenly my thoughts
  ceased to wander.</p>

  <p>It wasn't Axminster: it was the man with the damaged hand. "A big bloke
  with a black beard is dodging through the bushes towards the house," he said.
  "What are we to do?"</p>

  <p>The woman stretched out her arms ecstatically. "Let him come," she cried
  triumphantly. "Pedro." Came another throaty chuckle from behind me. "Come
  into the room after him, Pedro. Don't let him see you. Then I leave him to
  you. But don't kill him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; IN WHICH THE CURTAIN RINGS DOWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As long as I live I shall never forget the tension of the
  next few minutes. The light was so dim that the faces of the others were only
  blurs. Paul had joined the woman, and they were standing side by side against
  the altar stone. The door in the hall was ajar, and the hall itself was in
  darkness so that it was impossible to see anything distinctly.</p>

  <p>"He had a scheme: an absolute winner."</p>

  <p>Sinclair's words came back to me, and I wondered what it was. Had I really
  done the whole lot of us in by my indiscretion? But at last the period of
  waiting was over. Drummond's voice could be heard in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Very little light in this house."</p>

  <p>The woman by the altar stiffened. "His voice," she said exultingly.
  "Drummond at last."</p>

  <p>And then, or was it my imagination, there seemed to come a funny sort of
  hissing noise from the hall. Had the negro got him already? But no, he was
  speaking again. "I am a police inspector, and I wish to see the lady of the
  house on a very important matter."</p>

  <p>In the dim light I could just see Darrell's expression of blank amazement,
  and I sympathized with him. Was this the brilliant scheme? If so, was a more
  utterly fatuous one ever thought of. Why, his voice gave him away.</p>

  <p>"A very serious matter. I may say that I have two plain clothes men
  outside. What is that door at the end there? Don't attempt to detain me. Oh!
  I see&mdash;you're leading the way, are you."</p>

  <p>The door opened, and there stood Drummond. I could just see his black
  beard, but it wasn't at him that I looked for long. He took a couple of steps
  into the room, and like a shadow the negro slipped in&mdash;dodging behind
  the curtain. I heard hoarse gurgling noises coming from the others as they
  strove to warn him, but Paul had done his work too well.</p>

  <p>With a swift movement he stepped back and shut the door, so that Pedro was
  not more than a yard from him.</p>

  <p>"Good evening. Inspector. Your voice is very familiar."</p>

  <p>"A little ruse, my poppet," said Drummond pleasantly, "for getting into
  the august presence. May I say that I have a revolver in my hand, in case you
  can't see it in this light? And will you and your gentleman friend put your
  hands up. I've dealt with one of your myrmidons outside in the hall, and my
  temper is a bit ragged."</p>

  <p>With a faint smile the woman raised her hands, and Paul followed suit.</p>

  <p>"How are you, mon ami," she said. "We only required you to complete the
  family circle. In fact I was desolated when I thought you'd succumbed at the
  Mere."</p>

  <p>I worked madly at the handkerchief with my jaws. Why didn't he come
  further into the room? At any second the negro might spring on him.</p>

  <p>"And what is this ridiculous entertainment?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Specially staged for you, Hugh," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you've wasted your time," he said shortly. "A truce to this
  fooling. I've had enough of it. You and the swine with you are for it
  now."</p>

  <p>"Are we?" she mocked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you are. Come here, you swab. I don't know your name, and I
  don't want to, but hump yourself."</p>

  <p>"And if I refuse," said Paul easily.</p>

  <p>"I'll plug you where you stand," answered Drummond. "I don't know how my
  wife and friends are secured, but set them free. And no monkey tricks."</p>

  <p>And then, with a superhuman effort, I got the handkerchief half off my
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"Look out behind," I croaked, and even as I spoke the gleaming white teeth
  of the negro showed over his shoulder. That was all I could see at that
  distance, but I could hear.</p>

  <p>There came a startled grunt from Drummond, that foul throaty chuckle from
  the black man, and the fight commenced. And what a fight it was in the semi-
  darkness. I forgot our own peril, forgot what depended on the issue in the
  thrill of the issue itself. Dimly I could see them swaying to and fro, each
  man putting forward every atom of strength he possessed, whilst Irma swayed
  backwards and forwards in her excitement, and the man Paul went towards the
  struggling pair in case he was wanted.</p>

  <p>"Leave them, Paul," she cried tensely. "Let Drummond have his last
  fight."</p>

  <p>And then Darrell got his gag free. "Go it, Hugh; go it, old man," he
  shouted.</p>

  <p>I heard someone croaking hoarse sounds of encouragement and suddenly
  realized it was myself. And then gradually the sounds ceased, and my mouth
  got strangely dry. For Drummond was losing.</p>

  <p>From a great distance I heard Darrell muttering "My God!" over and over
  again to himself, and from somewhere else came pitiful little muffled cries
  as Mrs Drummond realized the ghastly truth. Her husband was losing.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to see the details, but of the main broad fact there was
  no doubt. At long last, Drummond had met his match. The nigger's chuckles
  were ceaseless and triumphant, though Drummond fought mute. But slowly and
  inexorably he was being worn down. And then step by step the black man forced
  him towards the chair where his wife was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Take Phyllis out, Paul," cried Irma suddenly. "Take her out."</p>

  <p>Foot by foot, faster and faster the pair swayed towards the empty seat.
  Drummond was weakening obviously, and suddenly with a groan he gave in and
  crumpled. And then in a couple of seconds it was over. He was flung into the
  chair, and with a click the steel bars closed over his wrists. He was a
  prisoner, the family circle was complete.</p>

  <p>With a heart broken little cry his wife, who had torn off her gag, flung
  her arms around him and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Darling boy," she cried in an agony. Then abruptly she straightened up
  and stood facing her enemy. And if her voice when she spoke was not quite
  steady, who could be surprised?</p>

  <p>"You foul devil," she said. "Get it over quickly."</p>

  <p>And Pedro's evil chuckle was the only answer. I glanced at Irma, and for
  the time she was beyond speech. Never have I seen such utter and complete
  triumph expressed on any human being's face. She was in an ecstasy. Standing
  in front of the bust of Peterson, she was crooning to it in a sort of frenzy.
  The madness was on her again.</p>

  <p>"My love, my King: he has been beaten. Do you realize it, my adored one?
  Drummond has been beaten. You are here, my Carl: your spirit is here. Do you
  see him&mdash;the man who killed you&mdash;powerless in my hands?"</p>

  <p>Gradually she grew calmer, and at length Paul spoke.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason for more delay now, Carissima," he said urgently. "Let
  us finish."</p>

  <p>She stared at him broodingly. "Finish&mdash;yes. All will be finished
  soon, Paul. But for a few minutes I will enjoy my triumph. Then we will stage
  our play."</p>

  <p>She looked at each of us in turn&mdash;a look of mingled triumph and
  contempt. "Ungag them, Paul, and Pedro&mdash;you attend to the white woman
  should she give trouble."</p>

  <p>She waited till Paul had obeyed her, gloating over us, and the full
  realization of our position came sweeping over me. Great though the odds
  against him had been, some vestige of hope had remained while Drummond was
  still free. Now our last chance had gone: we were finished&mdash;outwitted by
  this woman. And though nothing could have been more utterly futile and
  fatuous than Drummond's behaviour, I felt terribly sorry for him.</p>

  <p>Still breathing heavily after his fight, he sat there with his chin sunk
  on his chest looking the picture of despondency. And I realized what he must
  be going through. Beaten, and knowing that the result of that beating meant
  death to us all and to his wife. And yet&mdash;angry irritation surged up in
  me again&mdash;how on earth could he have expected anything else? If ever a
  man had asked for trouble he had. Now he'd got it, and so had we.</p>

  <p>All the fight seemed to have gone out of him: he was broken. And when I
  looked at the others they seemed broken too&mdash;stunned with the incredible
  thing that had happened. That Drummond, the invincible, should have met his
  match at last&mdash;should be sitting there as a helpless prisoner&mdash;had
  shattered them. It was as if the Bank of England had suddenly become
  insolvent. And it was like Peter Darrell to try and comfort him.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, old son," he said lightly. "If that nigger hadn't caught you
  unawares from behind, you'd have done him." And Drummond's only reply was a
  groan of despair, whilst his wife stroked his hair with her hand, and Pedro,
  like a great black shadow, hovered behind her.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," answered Irma. "That 'if' should be a great comfort to you all
  during the next half hour."</p>

  <p>"All is ready," said Paul. "Let us start."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we will start. But, as this is our last meeting, are there any
  little points you would like cleared up or explained? You, my dear Drummond,
  seem strangely silent. It's not surprising, I admit; complete defeat is
  always unpleasant. But, honestly, I can't congratulate you on your handling
  of the show. You haven't been very clever, have you? In fact, you've been
  thoroughly disappointing. I had hoped at any rate, for some semblance of the
  old form, certainly at the end, but instead of that you have given no sport
  at all. And now&mdash;it is over."</p>

  <p>She fell silent, that strange brooding look on her face, until at length
  Paul went up to her. "For Heaven's sake, Carissima," he said urgently, "do
  not let us delay any longer. I tell you I fear a trap."</p>

  <p>"Why do you fear a trap?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"They have come into our power too easily," he said doggedly. "They have
  walked in with their eyes open, it seems to me."</p>

  <p>"All that matters is that they have walked in," she answered. "And now,
  whatever happens, they will never walk out again. Do you hear that, Drummond,
  I said&mdash;whatever happens."</p>

  <p>He made no answer until the negro, with a snarl of rage, thrust his evil
  face close to him.</p>

  <p>"I hear," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"It matters not," she cried triumphantly, "if a cordon of police surround
  the house; it matters not if they batter at the doors&mdash;they will be too
  late. Too late!" She breathed the words deliriously; the madness was coming
  on her again.</p>

  <p>"But," stammered Paul, "how shall we get away?"</p>

  <p>She waved him from her imperiously. "Be silent; you bore me," Once more
  she turned to the plaster cast. "Do you realize, my Carl, what has happened?
  They are all here&mdash;all of them. Drummond and his wife are here; the
  others are here waiting to expiate their crime. Their lives for yours, my
  King; I have arranged that. Is it your will that I delay no longer?" She
  stared at the bust as if seeking an answer, and somebody&mdash;I think it was
  Algy&mdash;gave a short, high-pitched laugh. Nerves were beginning to crack;
  only Mrs Drummond still stood cool and disdainful, stroking her husband's
  hair.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the wild futility of the whole thing came home to me, so that I
  writhed and tugged and cursed. Seven of us were going to be killed at the
  whim of a mad woman! Murdered in cold blood! God! it was impossible&mdash;
  inconceivable.... Why didn't somebody do something? What fools they
  were&mdash;what utter fools!</p>

  <p>I raved at them incoherently, and told them what I thought of their
  brains, their mentality, and the complete absence of justification for their
  existence at all.</p>

  <p>"I told you she meant to kill us," I shouted, "and you five damned idiots
  come walking into the most obvious trap that has ever been laid."</p>

  <p>"Shut that man's mouth," said Irma quietly, and for the second time
  Pedro's huge black hand crept round my throat, squeezing, throttling, so
  that, half choked, I fell silent. After all, what was the use? Mad she might
  be and undoubtedly was, but as she had said to Drummond, we were finished,
  whatever happened. And it was more dignified to face it in silence.</p>

  <p>"We will begin," she said suddenly. "Paul, get Phyllis."</p>

  <p>With a little cry, Mrs Drummond flung her arms round her husband's neck.
  "Goodbye, my darling," she cried, kissing him again and again. But he was
  beyond speech, and at length the negro seized her and dragged her away.</p>

  <p>"Let me go, you foul brute," she said furiously, and Paul, who was
  standing by the stone of sacrifice, beckoned to her to come. Proudly, without
  faltering, she walked towards him.</p>

  <p>"Lie down," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Get it accurate, Paul," cried Irma anxiously. "Be certain that it is
  accurate."</p>

  <p>"I will be certain," he answered.</p>

  <p>And then for the first time I realized that there were ropes made fast to
  rings in the stone. She was going to be lashed down. She didn't struggle even
  when Pedro, chuckling in his excitement, helped to make her fast. And on her
  face was an expression of such unutterable contempt that it seemed to
  infuriate the other woman. "You may sneer, my dear Phyllis," she stormed.
  "But look above you, you little fool; look above you."</p>

  <p>With one accord we all looked up, and at the same moment a small light was
  turned on in the ceiling. And when he had seen what it illuminated Ted
  Jerningham began to shout and bellow like a madman. "Stop it, you devil," he
  roared. "Let one of us go there instead other. My God! Hugh. Do you see?"</p>

  <p>But Drummond was still silent, and after a while Jerningham relapsed into
  silence too. And as for me, I was conscious only of a deadly feeling of
  nausea. Hanging from a rafter was a huge, pointed knife. It was of an
  uncommon Oriental design, and it looked the most deadly weapon.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Hugh&mdash;do you see?" cried Irma mockingly. "Do you see what it is
  that hangs directly above your wife's heart? It has been tested, not once,
  but many times, and when I release the spring it will fall, Hugh. And it will
  fall straight." And still Drummond sat silent and cowed. "But I shall not
  release it yet: that I promise you. There is a little ceremony to be gone
  through before our finale. The rest of them have seen it, Drummond, but to
  you as my principal guest it will come as a surprise. And after it is over,
  and the knife that you see up there is buried in Phyllis's heart, your turn
  will come."</p>

  <p>She was rocking to and fro in her mad excitement.</p>

  <p>"Paul has arranged it," she cried exultingly. "Clever Paul. Behind each
  one of you is enough explosive to shatter you to pieces. But Paul has so
  arranged it that even as Phyllis waits and waits for death to come&mdash;so
  will you all wait. You will see it creeping closer and closer, and be
  powerless to do anything to save yourselves. I shall light the fuse, and you
  will see the flame burning slowly towards this little box. And when it
  reaches that box&mdash;suddenly, with the speed of light, the flame will dart
  to the gun-cotton behind your backs. For the fuse that connects the
  gun-cotton to the box is of a different brand to the one I shall light. Paul
  knows all these things: Paul is clever."</p>

  <p>And now the madness was on her in earnest. She walked to and fro in front
  of the altar stone, her arms outstretched, worshipping the plaster cast of
  Peterson. "Is my revenge worthy, my King?" she cried again and again. "Does
  it meet with your approval? First she shall be killed before their eyes, and
  then they will wait for their own death. They will see it coming closer every
  second, until, at last..."</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens! man," shouted Darrell to Paul, "you can't let her go on.
  The woman is mad."</p>

  <p>But he took no notice. His eyes were fixed on the woman who had now become
  silent. She seemed to be listening to a voice we could not hear, and
  something told me that we were very near the end. "Put out the lights, Paul,"
  she said gravely.</p>

  <p>I took one last look round the room; at Mrs Drummond, lying bound, with
  the black man gloating over her; at Irma, standing triumphant by the altar
  stone; and finally at Drummond. Even now I could hardly believe that it was
  the finish, and that he had nothing up his sleeve. But there he still sat
  with his head sunk on his breast, the personification of desolate defeat. And
  then the lights went out.</p>

  <p>Once again we were plunged in darkness that could be felt, but this time
  it was not a rehearsal. In a few minutes that knife would fall from the
  ceiling, and the poor girl would be dead. And we should see it actually
  happen. The sweat poured off me in streams as the full horror of it came
  home. I scarcely thought of what was going to be the fate of the rest of us
  afterwards. To be lying there bound, knowing that at any moment the knife
  might fall, was enough to send her crazy. More merciful if it did.</p>

  <p>"A model of Stonehenge, Drummond. You have realized that?"</p>

  <p>At last he seemed to have recovered the use of his tongue. "Yes, I have
  realized that." His voice was perfectly steady, and I wondered if even now he
  realized what was coming.</p>

  <p>"And the stone on which Phyllis lies is the stone of sacrifice. Do you
  think she is a worthy offering?"</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean to do this monstrous thing, Irma Peterson?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Should I have gone to all this trouble," she mocked, "if I didn't?"</p>

  <p>"And yet, when on one occasion you asked me, I spared Carl's life. Do you
  remember?"</p>

  <p>"Only to kill him later," she cried fiercely. "Go on, Drummond: beg for
  her life. I'd like to hear you whining."</p>

  <p>"You won't do that," he answered. "If I ask you to spare her it is for a
  different reason altogether. It is to show that you have left in you some
  shred of humanity."</p>

  <p>"As far as you are concerned I have none," she said. "As I say, should I
  have done all this for nothing? Listen, Drummond.</p>

  <p>"It was in Egypt, as I told you in my first letter, that the idea came to
  me. By the irony of fate, it was suggested to me by a man who knows you well,
  Drummond. You and dear Phyllis had been staying at the same house with him,
  and he was so interested to find out that I also knew you. He told me about
  this splendid game of hidden treasure, and it appeared that you had won. I
  asked him the rules, and he said they were exceedingly simple. Everything
  depended on having good clues. I trust that mine have been up to
  standard."</p>

  <p>She paused, and no one spoke.</p>

  <p>"From the game, as you played it then, to the game as you have played it
  now, was but a short step. Preparation was necessary, it is true; but the
  main idea was the same. I would give you a hidden-treasure hunt, where the
  prize was not a box of cigarettes, but something a little more valuable. And
  I would leave you to think "&mdash;her voice rose suddenly&mdash;"you poor
  fool, that if you succeeded you would get the prize."</p>

  <p>She laughed, and it had an ugly sound.</p>

  <p>"However, of that later. Having made my preparations, the next thing was
  to obtain the prize. That proved easier than I expected. Twice, but for one
  of those little accidents which no one could foresee, Phyllis would have got
  into a special taxi in London&mdash;a taxi prepared by me. But I could afford
  to wait. For weeks you were watched, Drummond&mdash;and then you went to
  Pangbourne where you began to realize that I was after you. And then came the
  opportunity. A hastily scrawled note in your handwriting&mdash;Paul is an
  adept at that, and I had several specimens of your writing&mdash;and the
  thing was done.</p>

  <p>"'Bring the Bentley at once to Tidmarsh, old girl. A most amazing thing
  has happened.&mdash;H.' Do you remember the note, Phyllis? I don't blame you
  for falling into the trap: it said neither too much nor too little, that
  note. And so I got the prize at a trifling cost. It was naughty of you to hit
  him so hard, my dear, as I've told you before. Paul said it was a positively
  wicked blow."</p>

  <p>Once again that mocking laugh rang through the room, but I hardly heard
  it. With every sense alert, I was listening to another sound&mdash;the sound
  of heavy breathing near me. Something was happening close by&mdash;but what?
  Then came a groan, and silence. "What was that? Who groaned?" Her words came
  sharp and insistent.</p>

  <p>"Who, indeed?" answered Drummond's voice. "Why don't you continue, Irma
  Peterson? We are waiting for the theatrical display."</p>

  <p>"Pedro! Pedro! Is Drummond still in his chair?" Came that same throaty
  chuckle, followed by Drummond's voice again: "Take your hands off me, you
  foul swab."</p>

  <p>"It is well," she said, and there was relief in her voice. "I should not
  like a mistake to occur now. And, with you, Drummond&mdash;one never
  knows."</p>

  <p>"True," said he, "one never knows. Even now, Irma&mdash;there is time for
  you to change your mind. I warn you that it will be better for you if you
  do."</p>

  <p>"Thank you a thousand times," she sneered. "Instead, however, of following
  your advice, we will begin. The sacrifice is ready; we have delayed enough."
  Once more I became conscious of movement near me, and my pulses began to
  tingle. "Just for the fraction of a second, Drummond, will you again see
  Phyllis alive: then the knife will fall."</p>

  <p>The faint light was beginning behind the Friar's Heel, in a couple of
  minutes it would be all over. Unless... unless... My heart was pounding; my
  tongue was dry. Was it the end, or were strange things taking place?</p>

  <p>"The dawn," she cried. "You see the dawn, Drummond. Soon the sun will
  rise, the rays will creep nearer and nearer to Phyllis. And then... See...
  the rim is already there. It is coming, Drummond, coming. Have you any last
  message, you poor damned fool, for her? If so speak now for my hand is on the
  lever of the knife."</p>

  <p>"Just one," said Drummond lightly, and to my amazement his voice did not
  come from the chair in which he was imprisoned. "Every beard is not false,
  but every nigger smells. That beard ain't false, dearie, and dis nigger don't
  smell. So I'm thinking there's something wrong somewhere."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's dead silence, then she gave a little choking gasp.
  Came a streak of light as the knife shot down, a crash, and on the stone of
  sacrifice lay the bust of Carl Peterson, shattered in a hundred pieces. For a
  while I couldn't grasp it. I stared stupidly at the woman who was cowering
  back against the altar stone; at the crumpled figure of Paul lying on the
  ground close by me. And then I looked at the nigger, and he was grinning
  broadly.</p>

  <p>"So it ain't poor dear Drummond in dat chair," he chuckled. "That is my
  very good friend John Perkins, and when you thought John was talking, it was
  really dis nigger what spoke, so you see you weren't quite as clever as you
  thought, my poppet."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she began to scream hysterically, and Drummond raced round the
  chairs setting us free.</p>

  <p>"Guard Phyllis," he shouted, as the door opened and Charles followed by
  the chauffeur came rushing in. It lasted about five seconds&mdash;the
  scrap&mdash;but that five seconds was enough. For when it was over and we
  looked round for Irma she had gone. Whether there was some secret door which
  we didn't discover, or whether she fled through the passage into the garage
  we shall never know. But from that day to this there has been no trace seen
  of her. And I don't even know the ultimate fate of the various men of the
  house party. Having caught the lot, including Charles, we put them in our
  chairs. And then Drummond lit the fuse and we left them bellowing for
  mercy.</p>

  <p>"Let 'em sweat for ten minutes," he remarked. "I've disconnected at the
  junction box, but they don't know that I have. Now then, boys, once
  again&mdash;and all together&mdash;Froth Blowers for ever."</p>

  <p>We stood in the road and we yelled at the tops of our voices. And it was
  only when we'd finished that I suddenly remembered the sailor.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, old boy," laughed Drummond. "Been retrieving any more
  bad plums out of waste paper baskets lately?"</p>

  <p>And so the game ended, and I know that that night I was too tired even to
  think about the strangeness of it, much less ask. It wasn't till lunch next
  day that Drummond cleared up the loose ends. I can see him now, lolling at
  the end of the table with a lazy grin on his face, and a tankard of beer
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"You'll probably curse my neck off, chaps," he said, "for keeping you in
  the dark, but honestly, it seemed the only way. It was touch and go, mark
  you&mdash;especially for Phyllis, and that was where the difficulty came
  in!"</p>

  <p>"For the Lord's sake start at the beginning," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, I wasn't too sure that they really did think we'd
  been killed at the Mere. And so it became absolutely vital that I should not
  be caught. But how to arrange it, and at the same time lull her suspicions,
  and make her think she'd got me, was the problem. Obviously by providing
  myself with a double, which is where dear old John came in. He acts for the
  movies, and he'd grown that awful fungus for a part he has to play shortly.
  When it is removed, however, he really does look rather like me; moreover
  he's the same build. So off we set&mdash;me as a sailor, him as
  me&mdash;without the smell of an idea as to what we were going to slosh into
  down here.</p>

  <p>"Then came an amazing piece of luck. We motored down&mdash;John and
  I&mdash;and we passed the house of last night. There was of course nothing
  suspicious about it&mdash;nothing to mark it as the spot we wanted. Except
  one thing, and therein lay the luck. As we went past the drive another car
  coming towards us slowed up, evidently with the intention of turning in. And
  sitting beside the driver in the front seat was the gent called Paul. That
  settled it."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't be expected to know," he answered, "but I should have
  thought old Toby's grey matter would have heaved to it, especially as he
  spotted the astounding likeness to the late lamented Lakington. Don't you
  remember the message Phyllis scrawled with her finger, in the blood at the
  back of her seat? LIKE LAK. It couldn't mean anything else, unless it was the
  most astounding coincidence. So we were a bit on the way, but not far. We'd
  found a house connected with them, but whether Phyllis was inside or not I
  hadn't an idea. However, being a bit of an adept at exploring houses at
  night, I intended to do so until you two bung-faced swabs went and made fools
  of yourselves at Stonehenge that afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Never," he grinned cheerfully, "in the course of a long and earnest
  career have I heard two people give themselves away so utterly and so often
  as Toby and Dixon did that afternoon. It was staggering, it was monumental.
  And the man they deliberately selected to be the recipient of their maidenly
  confidence was Paul himself. Beer&mdash;more beer&mdash;much more beer."</p>

  <p>"Damn it, Hugh," cried Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"My dear lad," Drummond silenced him with a wave of his hand, "you were
  the finest example of congenital idiocy it has ever been my misfortune to
  witness. The stones of Stonehenge are little pebbles compared to the bricks
  you dropped, but I forgive you. I even forgive jolly old Dixon's scavenging
  propensities in waste paper baskets. Such is my nature&mdash;beautiful,
  earnest and pure. But you assuredly caused me a lot of trouble: I had to
  change my plans completely.</p>

  <p>"Paul obviously suspected you. No man out of a lunatic asylum could
  possibly avoid doing so. And as I had no possible means of knowing that all
  he wanted to do was to get on with the job, I had to assume that he would
  pass on his suspicions to Irma, and proceed to rope the pair of you in. Time
  had become an urgent factor. So I wired Algy, and when he arrived, I told him
  by letter what to do. He was to announce loudly that he proposed to go to the
  Friar's Heel by night, but as he valued his life, he wasn't to do anything of
  the sort."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair, and looked at me with twinkling eyes. "You
  may be a damned idiot, Joe," he said, "but I looks towards you and I raise my
  glass. Had it remotely dawned on me that you were going there yourself, I'd
  have given you the same warning. But it didn't."</p>

  <p>"You knew I was there?" I stammered.</p>

  <p>"Laddie," he remarked, "hast ever listened to a vast herd of elephants
  crashing their way through primeval forest? Hast ever heard the scaly
  rhinoceros and young gambolling playfully on a shingly shore whilst they
  assuage their thirst? Thus and more so, was your progress that night. Like a
  tank with open exhaust you came into action. Like a battalion of panting men
  you lay about, in the most obvious places you could find, and breathed hard.
  You were, and I say it advisedly, the most conspicuous object in the whole of
  Wiltshire."</p>

  <p>He frowned suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You know what we found there, the others don't. Some poor devil who
  looked like a clerk&mdash;stone dead. What he was doing there we shall never
  know, but it was perfectly obvious that he had been mistaken for Algy. The
  nigger had blundered, and it was a blunder which might prove awkward. You
  heard them talking, Joe&mdash;Paul and Irma: but it didn't require that
  confirmation to see how the land lay. All along I had realized that Phyllis
  and I were the principal quarry. If she got you so much the better, but we
  came first. And what I was so terribly frightened of, as soon as I saw that
  body, was that Irma would get nervous, and believing I was already dead,
  would go back, finish off Phyllis straight away, and then clear out. I still
  had no definite scheme; I didn't even have a definite scheme after I'd
  functioned with the nigger. In fact I didn't really intend to fight him at
  all.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he must have smelt me or something, at any rate he came for me.
  And by the Lord Harry, it was touch and go. However "&mdash;he shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;"I pasted him good and hearty in the mazzard, and that was
  that. In fact he is in an awkward predicament that nigger. I dragged him into
  one of those disused sheds, and handcuffed him to a steel girder. Then I put
  his victim beside him. And he will find explanations a little difficult.</p>

  <p>"The trouble was that all this had delayed me. I hadn't got a car, only a
  bicycle&mdash;and that house had to be explored at once. My hat! laddie," he
  said to me, "I didn't expect to find you as part of the furniture. How on
  earth did you get there?"</p>

  <p>"On the luggage grid of their car," I said.</p>

  <p>"The devil you did," he grinned. "The devil you did! Joe&mdash;you are a
  worthy recruit, though when I saw you through the skylight I consigned you to
  the deepest pit of hell. But, thank Heavens! you didn't give away the fact
  that you'd seen me."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were one of them," I said.</p>

  <p>"I know you did, old boy," he laughed, "What we'd have done without your
  thoughts during this show I don't know. They have all been so inconceivably
  wide of the mark that they've been invaluable."</p>

  <p>"Don't pay any attention to him, Mr Dixon," said his wife.</p>

  <p>"My darling," he protested, "I mean it. Joe has been invaluable. The air
  of complete certainty with which he proclaimed the exact opposite to the
  truth has saved the situation. I've been able to bank on it. And once I
  realized what that foul female intended to do I wanted every bit of
  assistance I could get.</p>

  <p>"The first alternative was to try and get you out of the house single-
  handed, but I dismissed that as impossible. I didn't know your room, the
  house was stiff with men, and&mdash;most important of all&mdash;that woman
  would have shot on sight.</p>

  <p>"The second alternative was to get all the bunch into the house without
  arousing her suspicions. And when I heard her reading the letter she was
  sending Algy I realized we were getting on. John and Toby could be brought in
  at a suitable time, and there only remained the problem of what I was going
  to do. I confess I didn't think of it. John suggested the nigger. It was a
  risk, but it proved easier than I thought."</p>

  <p>"Damn it, Hugh," cried Darrell, "why didn't you say who you were in the
  afternoon? You were alone with us, and if you'd set us free then we could
  have tackled the whole bunch."</p>

  <p>"Because, Peter," said Drummond gravely, "it would have taken us some
  minutes to tackle them. It would have taken Irma half a second to kill
  Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Jerningham, "you might have let us know. Jove! old
  boy, I never want to go through twenty minutes like that again."</p>

  <p>"I know, chaps&mdash;and I'm sorry. I'd have spared you that if I'd
  thought it safe. But then you would all of you have been acting, and I wanted
  the real thing. I knew that Dixon thought John was me, and would tell you so,
  too. And I wanted you all to carry on as if you thought so. The rest you
  know. It was easy for me to talk every time instead of John, with the room in
  semi-darkness as it was. And I think you'll admit we staged a damned good
  fight."</p>

  <p>"When did you spot it, Phyllis?" said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"When I kissed John," she laughed.</p>

  <p>"And very nice too," grinned that worthy. "Unrehearsed effects are always
  best."</p>

  <p>Drummond rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"All over, chaps, all over. Back to the dreary round. Algernon," he hailed
  a passing waiter, "bring, my stouthearted fellow, eight of those pale pink
  concoctions that the sweet thing in the bar fondly imagines are Martinis. I
  would fain propose a toast. But first&mdash;a small formality. Mr Joseph
  Dixon will place his hand in his pocket and extract there from coins to the
  value of five shillings. I will then present him here and now with the
  insignia of the Ancient Order, feeling that he has well merited that high
  honour. Our anthem he knows; he has already sung it twice in his cracked
  falsetto. The privileges attendant to our Order you will find enumerated in
  this small book, Mr Dixon, and they should be studied in the solitude of your
  chamber when alone with your thoughts. Especially our great insurance treble
  which guards your dog from rabies, your cook from babies, and yourself from
  scabies. Great words, my masters, great words, I perceive that Algernon,
  panting and exhausted after his ten-yard walk, is with us again, carrying the
  raspberry juice with all his well-known flair. Lady and Gentlemen&mdash;to
  our new Froth Blower. And may I inquire which of you bat-faced sons of Belial
  has pinched the five bob?"</p>
