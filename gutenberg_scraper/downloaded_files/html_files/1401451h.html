  <h3>A NARRATIVE OF THE TIME OF NERO</h3>

  <h3>TRANSLATED FROM THE POLISH BY JEREMIAH CURTIN</h3>

  <h3>WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE 1898 US EDITION<br>
  AND PAINTINGS BY ULPIANO CHECA (1860-1916)</h3>

  <h3>First UK edition: J.M. Dent &amp; Co., London, 1896<br>

  <h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

  <p class="intro">In the trilogy &ldquo;With Fire and Sword,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
  Deluge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pan Michael,&rdquo; Sienkiewicz has given pictures
  of a great and decisive epoch in modern history. The results of the struggle
  begun under Bogdan Hmelnitski have been felt for more than two centuries, and
  they are growing daily in importance. The Russia which rose out of that
  struggle has become a power not only of European but of world-wide
  significance, and, to all human seeming, she is yet in an early stage of her
  career.</p>

  <p class="intro">In &ldquo;Quo Vadis&rdquo; the author gives us pictures of
  opening scenes in the conflict of moral ideas with the Roman Empire,&mdash;a
  conflict from which Christianity issued as the leading force in history.</p>

  <p class="intro">The Slavs are not so well known to Western Europe or to us
  as they are sure to be in the near future; hence the trilogy, with all its
  popularity and merit, is not appreciated yet as it will be.</p>

  <p class="intro">The conflict described in &ldquo;Quo Vadis&rdquo; is of
  supreme interest to a vast number of persons reading English; and this book
  will rouse, I think, more attention at first than anything written by
  Sienkiewicz hitherto.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch01"
     name="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Petronius woke only about midday, and as usual greatly
  wearied. The evening before he had been at one of Nero&rsquo;s feasts, which
  was prolonged till late at night. For some time his health had been failing.
  He said himself that he woke up benumbed, as it were, and without power of
  collecting his thoughts. But the morning bath and careful kneading of the
  body by trained slaves hastened gradually the course of his slothful blood,
  roused him, quickened him, restored his strength, so that he issued from the
  elæothesium, that is, the last division of the bath, as if he had risen from
  the dead, with eyes gleaming from wit and gladness, rejuvenated, filled with
  life, exquisite, so unapproachable that Otho himself could not compare with
  him, and was really that which he had been called,&mdash;arbiter
  elegantiarum.</p>

  <p>He visited the public baths rarely, only when some rhetor happened there
  who roused admiration and who was spoken of in the city, or when in the
  ephebias there were combats of exceptional interest. Moreover, he had in his
  own &ldquo;insula&rdquo; private baths which Celer, the famous contemporary
  of Severus, had extended for him, reconstructed and arranged with such
  uncommon taste that Nero himself acknowledged their excellence over those of
  the Emperor, though the imperial baths were more extensive and finished with
  incomparably greater luxury.</p>

  <p>After that feast, at which he was bored by the jesting of Vatinius with
  Nero, Lucan, and Seneca, he took part in a diatribe as to whether woman has a
  soul. Rising late, he used, as was his custom, the baths. Two enormous
  balneatores laid him on a cypress table covered with snow-white Egyptian
  byssus, and with hands dipped in perfumed olive oil began to rub his shapely
  body; and he waited with closed eyes till the heat of the laconicum and the
  heat of their hands passed through him and expelled weariness.</p>

  <p>But after a certain time he spoke, and opened his eyes; he inquired about
  the weather, and then about gems which the jeweller Idomeneus had promised to
  send him for examination that day. It appeared that the weather was
  beautiful, with a light breeze from the Alban hills, and that the gems had
  not been brought. Petronius closed his eyes again, and had given command to
  bear him to the tepidarium, when from behind the curtain the nomenclator
  looked in, announcing that young Marcus Vinicius, recently returned from Asia
  Minor, had come to visit him.</p>

  <p>Petronius ordered to admit the guest to the tepidarium, to which he was
  borne himself. Vinicius was the son of his oldest sister, who years before
  had married Marcus Vinicius, a man of consular dignity from the time of
  Tiberius. The young man was serving then under Corbulo against the Parthians,
  and at the close of the war had returned to the city. Petronius had for him a
  certain weakness bordering on attachment, for Marcus was beautiful and
  athletic, a young man who knew how to preserve a certain aesthetic measure in
  his profligacy; this, Petronius prized above everything.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A greeting to Petronius,&rdquo; said the young man, entering the
  tepidarium with a springy step. &ldquo;May all the gods grant thee success,
  but especially Asklepios and Kypris, for under their double protection
  nothing evil can meet one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I greet thee in Rome, and may thy rest be sweet after war,&rdquo;
  replied Petronius, extending his hand from between the folds of soft karbas
  stuff in which he was wrapped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be heard in Armenia; or
  since thou wert in Asia, didst thou not stumble into Bithynia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius on a time had been proconsul in Bithynia, and, what is more, he
  had governed with energy and justice. This was a marvellous contrast in the
  character of a man noted for effeminacy and love of luxury; hence he was fond
  of mentioning those times, as they were a proof of what he had been, and of
  what he might have become had it pleased him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I happened to visit Heraklea,&rdquo; answered Vinicius.
  &ldquo;Corbulo sent me there with an order to assemble
  reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Heraklea! I knew at Heraklea a certain maiden from Colchis, for
  whom I would have given all the divorced women of this city, not excluding
  Poppæa. But these are old stories. Tell me now, rather, what is to be heard
  from the Parthian boundary. It is true that they weary me every Vologeses of
  them, and Tiridates and Tigranes,&mdash;those barbarians who, as young
  Arulenus insists, walk on all fours at home, and pretend to be human only
  when in our presence. But now people in Rome speak much of them, if only for
  the reason that it is dangerous to speak of aught else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The war is going badly, and but for Corbulo might be turned to
  defeat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Corbulo! by Bacchus! a real god of war, a genuine Mars, a great
  leader, at the same time quick-tempered, honest, and dull. I love him, even
  for this,&mdash;that Nero is afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Corbulo is not a dull man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps thou art right, but for that matter it is all one. Dulness,
  as Pyrrho says, is in no way worse than wisdom, and differs from it in
  nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius began to talk of the war; but when Petronius closed his eyes
  again, the young man, seeing his uncle&rsquo;s tired and somewhat emaciated
  face, changed the conversation, and inquired with a certain interest about
  his health.</p>

  <p>Petronius opened his eyes again.</p>

  <p>Health!&mdash;No. He did not feel well. He had not gone so far yet, it is
  true, as young Sissena, who had lost sensation to such a degree that when he
  was brought to the bath in the morning he inquired, &ldquo;Am I
  sitting?&rdquo; But he was not well. Vinicius had just committed him to the
  care of Asklepios and Kypris. But he, Petronius, did not believe in
  Asklepios. It was not known even whose son that Asklepios was, the son of
  Arsinoe or Koronis; and if the mother was doubtful, what was to be said of
  the father? Who, in that time, could be sure who his own father was?</p>

  <p>Hereupon Petronius began to laugh; then he continued,&mdash;&ldquo;Two
  years ago, it is true, I sent to Epidaurus three dozen live blackbirds and a
  goblet of gold; but dost thou know why? I said to myself, &rsquo;Whether this
  helps or not, it will do me no harm.&rsquo; Though people make offerings to
  the gods yet, I believe that all think as I do,&mdash;all, with the
  exception, perhaps, of mule-drivers hired at the Porta Capena by travellers.
  Besides Asklepios, I have had dealings with sons of Asklepios. When I was
  troubled a little last year in the bladder, they performed an incubation for
  me. I saw that they were tricksters, but I said to myself: &rsquo;What harm!
  The world stands on deceit, and life is an illusion. The soul is an illusion
  too. But one must have reason enough to distinguish pleasant from painful
  illusions.&rsquo; I shall give command to burn in my hypocaustum, cedar-wood
  sprinkled with ambergris, for during life I prefer perfumes to stenches. As
  to Kypris, to whom thou hast also confided me, I have known her guardianship
  to the extent that I have twinges in my right foot. But as to the rest she is
  a good goddess! I suppose that thou wilt bear sooner or later white doves to
  her altar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Vinicius. &ldquo;The arrows of the Parthians
  have not reached my body, but a dart of Amor has struck
  me&mdash;unexpectedly, a few stadia from a gate of this city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the white knees of the Graces! thou wilt tell me of this at a
  leisure hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come purposely to get thy advice,&rdquo; answered
  Marcus.</p>

  <p>But at that moment the epilatores came, and occupied themselves with
  Petronius. Marcus, throwing aside his tunic, entered a bath of tepid water,
  for Petronius invited him to a plunge bath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I have not even asked whether thy feeling is
  reciprocated,&rdquo; said Petronius, looking at the youthful body of Marcus,
  which was as if cut out of marble. &ldquo;Had Lysippos seen thee, thou
  wouldst be ornamenting now the gate leading to the Palatine, as a statue of
  Hercules in youth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man smiled with satisfaction, and began to sink in the bath,
  splashing warm water abundantly on the mosaic which represented Hera at the
  moment when she was imploring Sleep to lull Zeus to rest. Petronius looked at
  him with the satisfied eye of an artist.</p>

  <p>When Vinicius had finished and yielded himself in turn to the epilatores,
  a lector came in with a bronze tube at his breast and rolls of paper in the
  tube.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost wish to listen?&rdquo; asked Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it is thy creation, gladly!&rdquo; answered the young tribune;
  &ldquo;if not, I prefer conversation. Poets seize people at present on every
  street corner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course they do. Thou wilt not pass any basilica, bath, library,
  or book-shop without seeing a poet gesticulating like a monkey. Agrippa, on
  coming here from the East, mistook them for madmen. And it is just such a
  time now. Cæsar writes verses; hence all follow in his steps. Only it is not
  permitted to write better verses than Cæsar, and for that reason I fear a
  little for Lucan. But I write prose, with which, however, I do not honor
  myself or others. What the lector has to read are codicilli of that poor
  Fabricius Veiento.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why &rsquo;poor&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because it has been communicated to him that he must dwell in
  Odyssa and not return to his domestic hearth till he receives a new command.
  That Odyssey will be easier for him than for Ulysses, since his wife is no
  Penelope. I need not tell thee, for that matter, that he acted stupidly. But
  here no one takes things otherwise than superficially. His is rather a
  wretched and dull little book, which people have begun to read passionately
  only when the author is banished. Now one hears on every side,
  &lsquo;Scandala! scandala!&rsquo; and it may be that Veiento invented some
  things; but I, who know the city, know our patres and our women, assure thee
  that it is all paler than reality. Meanwhile every man is searching in the
  book,&mdash;for himself with alarm, for his acquaintances with delight. At
  the book-shop of Avirnus a hundred copyists are writing at dictation, and its
  success is assured.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are not thy affairs in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are; but the author is mistaken, for I am at once worse and
  less flat than he represents me. Seest thou we have lost long since the
  feeling of what is worthy or unworthy,&mdash;and to me even it seems that in
  real truth there is no difference between them, though Seneca, Musonius, and
  Trasca pretend that they see it. To me it is all one! By Hercules, I say what
  I think! I have preserved loftiness, however, because I know what is deformed
  and what is beautiful; but our poet, Bronzebeard, for example, the
  charioteer, the singer, the actor, does not understand this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, however, for Fabricius! He is a good
  companion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vanity ruined the man. Every one suspected him, no one knew
  certainly; but he could not contain himself, and told the secret on all sides
  in confidence. Hast heard the history of Rufinus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then come to the frigidarium to cool; there I will tell
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They passed to the frigidarium, in the middle of which played a fountain
  of bright rose-color, emitting the odor of violets. There they sat in niches
  which were covered with velvet, and began to cool themselves. Silence reigned
  for a time. Vinicius looked awhile thoughtfully at a bronze faun which,
  bending over the arm of a nymph, was seeking her lips eagerly with his
  lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;That is what is best
  in life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More or less! But besides this thou lovest war, for which I have no
  liking, since under tents one&rsquo;s finger-nails break and cease to be
  rosy. For that matter, every man has his preferences. Bronzebeard loves song,
  especially his own; and old Scaurus his Corinthian vase, which stands near
  his bed at night, and which he kisses when he cannot sleep. He has kissed the
  edge off already. Tell me, dost thou not write verses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I have never composed a single hexameter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And dost thou not play on the lute and sing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And dost thou drive a chariot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tried once in Antioch, but unsuccessfully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am at rest concerning thee. And to what party in the
  hippodrome dost thou belong?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the Greens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I am perfectly at rest, especially since thou hast a large
  property indeed, though thou art not so rich as Pallas or Seneca. For seest
  thou, with us at present it is well to write verses, to sing to a lute, to
  declaim, and to compete in the Circus; but better, and especially safer, not
  to write verses, not to play, not to sing, and not to compete in the Circus.
  Best of all, is it to know how to admire when Bronzebeard admires. Thou art a
  comely young man; hence Poppæa may fall in love with thee. This is thy only
  peril. But no, she is too experienced; she cares for something else. She has
  had enough of love with her two husbands; with the third she has other views.
  Dost thou know that that stupid Otho loves her yet to distraction? He walks
  on the cliffs of Spain, and sighs; he has so lost his former habits, and so
  ceased to care for his person, that three hours each day suffice him to dress
  his hair. Who could have expected this of Otho?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand him,&rdquo; answered Vinicius; &ldquo;but in his place
  I should have done something else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, namely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should have enrolled faithful legions of mountaineers of that
  country. They are good soldiers,&mdash;those Iberians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius! Vinicius! I almost wish to tell thee that thou wouldst
  not have been capable of that. And knowest why? Such things are done, but
  they are not mentioned even conditionally. As to me, in his place, I should
  have laughed at Poppæa, laughed at Bronzebeard, and formed for myself
  legions, not of Iberian men, however, but Iberian women. And what is more, I
  should have written epigrams which I should not have read to any
  one,&mdash;not like that poor Rufinus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert to tell me his history.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell it in the unctorium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But in the unctorium the attention of Vinicius was turned to other
  objects; namely, to wonderful slave women who were waiting for the bathers.
  Two of them, Africans, resembling noble statues of ebony, began to anoint
  their bodies with delicate perfumes from Arabia; others, Phrygians, skilled
  in hairdressing, held in their hands, which were bending and flexible as
  serpents, combs and mirrors of polished steel; two Grecian maidens from Kos,
  who were simply like deities, waited as vestiplicæ, till the moment should
  come to put statuesque folds in the togas of the lords.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the cloud-scattering Zeus!&rdquo; said Marcus Vinicius,
  &ldquo;what a choice thou hast!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I prefer choice to numbers,&rdquo; answered Petronius. &ldquo;My
  whole &lsquo;familia&rsquo; [household servants] in Rome does not exceed four
  hundred, and I judge that for personal attendance only upstarts need a
  greater number of people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More beautiful bodies even Bronzebeard does not possess,&rdquo;
  said Vinicius, distending his nostrils.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art my relative,&rdquo; answered Petronius, with a certain
  friendly indifference, &ldquo;and I am neither so misanthropic as Barsus nor
  such a pedant as Aulus Plautius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Vinicius heard this last name, he forgot the maidens from Kos for a
  moment, and, raising his head vivaciously, inquired,&mdash;&ldquo;Whence did
  Aulus Plautius come to thy mind? Dost thou know that after I had disjointed
  my arm outside the city, I passed a number of days in his house? It happened
  that Plautius came up at the moment when the accident happened, and, seeing
  that I was suffering greatly, he took me to his house; there a slave of his,
  the physician Merion, restored me to health. I wished to speak with thee
  touching this very matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? Is it because thou hast fallen in love with Pomponia
  perchance? In that case I pity thee; she is not young, and she is virtuous! I
  cannot imagine a worse combination. Brr!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not with Pomponia&mdash;eheu!&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With whom, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I knew myself with whom? But I do not know to a certainty her
  name even,&mdash;Lygia or Callina? They call her Lygia in the house, for she
  comes of the Lygian nation; but she has her own barbarian name, Callina. It
  is a wonderful house,&mdash;that of those Plautiuses. There are many people
  in it; but it is quiet there as in the groves of Subiacum. For a number of
  days I did not know that a divinity dwelt in the house. Once about daybreak I
  saw her bathing in the garden fountain; and I swear to thee by that foam from
  which Aphrodite rose, that the rays of the dawn passed right through her
  body. I thought that when the sun rose she would vanish before me in the
  light, as the twilight of morning does. Since then, I have seen her twice;
  and since then, too, I know not what rest is, I know not what other desires
  are, I have no wish to know what the city can give me. I want neither women,
  nor gold, nor Corinthian bronze, nor amber, nor pearls, nor wine, nor feasts;
  I want only Lygia. I am yearning for her, in sincerity I tell thee,
  Petronius, as that Dream who is imaged on the Mosaic of thy tepidarium
  yearned for Paisythea,&mdash;whole days and night do I yearn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she is a slave, then purchase her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is not a slave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is she? A freed woman of Plautius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never having been a slave, she could not be a freed
  woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not,&mdash;a king&rsquo;s daughter, or something of that
  sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou dost rouse my curiosity, Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if thou wish to listen, I will satisfy thy curiosity
  straightway. Her story is not a long one. Thou art acquainted, perhaps
  personally, with Vannius, king of the Suevi, who, expelled from his country,
  spent a long time here in Rome, and became even famous for his skilful play
  with dice, and his good driving of chariots. Drusus put him on the throne
  again. Vannius, who was really a strong man, ruled well at first, and warred
  with success; afterward, however, he began to skin not only his neighbors,
  but his own Suevi, too much. Thereupon Vangio and Sido, two sister&rsquo;s
  sons of his, and the sons of Vibilius, king of the Hermunduri, determined to
  force him to Rome again&mdash;to try his luck there at dice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember; that is of recent Claudian times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! War broke out. Vannius summoned to his aid the Yazygi; his
  dear nephews called in the Lygians, who, hearing of the riches of Vannius,
  and enticed by the hope of booty, came in such numbers that Cæsar himself,
  Claudius, began to fear for the safety of the boundary. Claudius did not wish
  to interfere in a war among barbarians, but he wrote to Atelius Hister, who
  commanded the legions of the Danube, to turn a watchful eye on the course of
  the war, and not permit them to disturb our peace. Hister required, then, of
  the Lygians a promise not to cross the boundary; to this they not only
  agreed, but gave hostages, among whom were the wife and daughter of their
  leader. It is known to thee that barbarians take their wives and children to
  war with them. My Lygia is the daughter of that leader.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whence dost thou know all this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus Plautius told it himself. The Lygians did not cross the
  boundary, indeed; but barbarians come and go like a tempest. So did the
  Lygians vanish with their wild-ox horns on their heads. They killed
  Vannius&rsquo;s Suevi and Yazygi; but their own king fell. They disappeared
  with their booty then, and the hostages remained in Hister&rsquo;s hands. The
  mother died soon after, and Hister, not knowing what to do with the daughter,
  sent her to Pomponius, the governor of all Germany. He, at the close of the
  war with the Catti, returned to Rome, where Claudius, as is known to thee,
  permitted him to have a triumph. The maiden on that occasion walked after the
  car of the conqueror; but, at the end of the solemnity,&mdash;since hostages
  cannot be considered captives, and since Pomponius did not know what to do
  with her definitely&mdash;he gave her to his sister Pomponia Græcina, the
  wife of Plautius. In that house where all&mdash;beginning with the masters
  and ending with the poultry in the hen-house&mdash;are virtuous, that maiden
  grew up as virtuous, alas! as Græcina herself, and so beautiful that even
  Poppæa, if near her, would seem like an autumn fig near an apple of the
  Hesperides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I repeat to thee that from the moment when I saw how the sun-
  rays at that fountain passed through her body, I fell in love to
  distraction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is as transparent as a lamprey eel, then, or a youthful
  sardine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jest not, Petronius; but if the freedom with which I speak of my
  desire misleads thee, know this,&mdash;that bright garments frequently cover
  deep wounds. I must tell thee, too, that, while returning from Asia, I slept
  one night in the temple of Mopsus to have a prophetic dream. Well, Mopsus
  appeared in a dream to me, and declared that, through love, a great change in
  my life would take place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pliny declares, as I hear, that he does not believe in the gods,
  but he believes in dreams; and perhaps he is right. My jests do not prevent
  me from thinking at times that in truth there is only one deity, eternal,
  creative, all-powerful, Venus Genetrix. She brings souls together; she unites
  bodies and things. Eros called the world out of chaos. Whether he did well is
  another question; but, since he did so, we should recognize his might, though
  we are free not to bless it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! Petronius, it is easier to find philosophy in the world than
  wise counsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, what is thy wish specially?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to have Lygia. I wish that these arms of mine, which now
  embrace only air, might embrace Lygia and press her to my bosom. I wish to
  breathe with her breath. Were she a slave, I would give Aulus for her one
  hundred maidens with feet whitened with lime as a sign that they were
  exhibited on sale for the first time. I wish to have her in my house till my
  head is as white as the top of Soracte in winter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is not a slave, but she belongs to the &lsquo;family&rsquo; of
  Plautius; and since she is a deserted maiden, she may be considered an
  &lsquo;alumna.&rsquo; Plautius might yield her to thee if he
  wished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then it seems that thou knowest not Pomponia Græcina. Both have
  become as much attached to her as if she were their own daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pomponia I know,&mdash;a real cypress. If she were not the wife of
  Aulus, she might be engaged as a mourner. Since the death of Julius she has
  not thrown aside dark robes; and in general she looks as if, while still
  alive, she were walking on the asphodel meadow. She is, moreover, a
  &lsquo;one-man woman&rsquo;; hence, among our ladies of four and five
  divorces, she is straightway a phoenix. But! hast thou heard that in Upper
  Egypt the phoenix has just been hatched out, as &rsquo;tis said?&mdash;an
  event which happens not oftener than once in five centuries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius! Petronius! Let us talk of the phoenix some other
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What shall I tell thee, my Marcus? I know Aulus Plautius, who,
  though he blames my mode of life, has for me a certain weakness, and even
  respects me, perhaps, more than others, for he knows that I have never been
  an informer like Domitius Afer, Tigellinus, and a whole rabble of
  Ahenobarbus&rsquo;s intimates [Nero&rsquo;s name was originally L. Domitius
  Ahenobarbus]. Without pretending to be a stoic, I have been offended more
  than once at acts of Nero, which Seneca and Burrus looked at through their
  fingers. If it is thy thought that I might do something for thee with Aulus,
  I am at thy command.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I judge that thou hast the power. Thou hast influence over him;
  and, besides, thy mind possesses inexhaustible resources. If thou wert to
  survey the position and speak with Plautius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast too great an idea of my influence and wit; but if that is
  the only question, I will talk with Plautius as soon as they return to the
  city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They returned two days since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case let us go to the triclinium, where a meal is now
  ready, and when we have refreshed ourselves, let us give command to bear us
  to Plautius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast ever been kind to me,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, with
  vivacity; &ldquo;but now I shall give command to rear thy statue among my
  lares,&mdash;just such a beauty as this one,&mdash;and I will place offerings
  before it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he turned toward the statues which ornamented one entire wall of the
  perfumed chamber, and pointing to the one which represented Petronius as
  Hermes with a staff in his hand, he added,&mdash;&ldquo;By the light of
  Helios! if the &lsquo;godlike&rsquo; Alexander resembled thee, I do not
  wonder at Helen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And in that exclamation there was as much sincerity as flattery; for
  Petronius, though older and less athletic, was more beautiful than even
  Vinicius. The women of Rome admired not only his pliant mind and his taste,
  which gained for him the title Arbiter elegantiæ, but also his body. This
  admiration was evident even on the faces of those maidens from Kos who were
  arranging the folds of his toga; and one of whom, whose name was Eunice,
  loving him in secret, looked him in the eyes with submission and rapture. But
  he did not even notice this; and, smiling at Vinicius, he quoted in answer an
  expression of Seneca about woman,&mdash;Animal impudens, <i>etc</i>. And
  then, placing an arm on the shoulders of his nephew, he conducted him to the
  triclinium.</p>

  <p>In the unctorium the two Grecian maidens, the Phrygians, and the two
  Ethiopians began to put away the vessels with perfumes. But at that moment,
  and beyond the curtain of the frigidarium, appeared the heads of the
  balneatores, and a low &ldquo;Psst!&rdquo; was heard. At that call one of the
  Grecians, the Phrygians, and the Ethiopians sprang up quickly, and vanished
  in a twinkle behind the curtain. In the baths began a moment of license which
  the inspector did not prevent, for he took frequent part in such frolics
  himself. Petronius suspected that they took place; but, as a prudent man, and
  one who did not like to punish, he looked at them through his fingers.</p>

  <p>In the unctorium only Eunice remained. She listened for a short time to
  the voices and laughter which retreated in the direction of the laconicum. At
  last she took the stool inlaid with amber and ivory, on which Petronius had
  been sitting a short time before, and put it carefully at his statue. The
  unctorium was full of sunlight and the hues which came from the many-colored
  marbles with which the wall was faced. Eunice stood on the stool, and,
  finding herself at the level of the statue, cast her arms suddenly around its
  neck; then, throwing back her golden hair, and pressing her rosy body to the
  white marble, she pressed her lips with ecstasy to the cold lips of
  Petronius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After a refreshment, which was called the morning meal and
  to which the two friends sat down at an hour when common mortals were already
  long past their midday prandium, Petronius proposed a light doze. According
  to him, it was too early for visits yet. &ldquo;There are, it is true,&rdquo;
  said he, &ldquo;people who begin to visit their acquaintances about sunrise,
  thinking that custom an old Roman one, but I look on this as barbarous. The
  afternoon hours are most proper,&mdash;not earlier, however, than that one
  when the sun passes to the side of Jove&rsquo;s temple on the Capitol and
  begins to look slantwise on the Forum. In autumn it is still hot, and people
  are glad to sleep after eating. At the same time it is pleasant to hear the
  noise of the fountain in the atrium, and, after the obligatory thousand
  steps, to doze in the red light which filters in through the purple
  half-drawn velarium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius recognized the justice of these words; and the two men began to
  walk, speaking in a careless manner of what was to be heard on the Palatine
  and in the city, and philosophizing a little upon life. Petronius withdrew
  then to the cubiculum, but did not sleep long. In half an hour he came out,
  and, having given command to bring verbena, he inhaled the perfume and rubbed
  his hands and temples with it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt not believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how it enlivens and
  freshens one. Now I am ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The litter was waiting long since; hence they took their places, and
  Petronius gave command to bear them to the Vicus Patricius, to the house of
  Aulus. Petronius&rsquo;s &ldquo;insula&rdquo; lay on the southern slope of
  the Palatine, near the so-called Carinæ; their nearest way, therefore, was
  below the Forum; but since Petronius wished to step in on the way to see the
  jeweller Idomeneus, he gave the direction to carry them along the Vicus
  Apollinis and the Forum in the direction of the Vicus Sceleratus, on the
  corner of which were many tabernæ of every kind.</p>

  <p>Gigantic Africans bore the litter and moved on, preceded by slaves called
  pedisequii. Petronius, after some time, raised to his nostrils in silence his
  palm odorous with verbena, and seemed to be meditating on something.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It occurs to me,&rdquo; said he after a while, &ldquo;that if thy
  forest goddess is not a slave she might leave the house of Plautius, and
  transfer herself to thine. Thou wouldst surround her with love and cover her
  with wealth, as I do my adored Chrysothemis, of whom, speaking between us, I
  have quite as nearly enough as she has of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marcus shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; inquired Petronius. &ldquo;In the worst event, the case
  would be left with Cæsar, and thou mayst be certain that, thanks even to my
  influence, our Bronzebeard would be on thy side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou knowest not Lygia,&rdquo; replied Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then permit me to ask if thou know her otherwise than by sight?
  Hast spoken with her? hast confessed thy love to her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw her first at the fountain; since then I have met her twice.
  Remember that during my stay in the house of Aulus, I dwelt in a separate
  villa, intended for guests, and, having a disjointed arm, I could not sit at
  the common table. Only on the eve of the day for which I announced my
  departure did I meet Lygia at supper, but I could not say a word to her. I
  had to listen to Aulus and his account of victories gained by him in Britain,
  and then of the fall of small states in Italy, which Licinius Stolo strove to
  prevent. In general I do not know whether Aulus will be able to speak of
  aught else, and do not think that we shall escape this history unless it be
  thy wish to hear about the effeminacy of these days. They have pheasants in
  their preserves, but they do not eat them, setting out from the principle
  that every pheasant eaten brings nearer the end of Roman power. I met her a
  second time at the garden cistern, with a freshly plucked reed in her hand,
  the top of which she dipped in the water and sprinkled the irises growing
  around. Look at my knees. By the shield of Hercules, I tell thee that they
  did not tremble when clouds of Parthians advanced on our maniples with howls,
  but they trembled before the cistern. And, confused as a youth who still
  wears a bulla on his neck, I merely begged pity with my eyes, not being able
  to utter a word for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at him, as if with a certain envy. &ldquo;Happy
  man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though the world and life were the worst
  possible, one thing in them will remain eternally
  good,&mdash;youth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a while he inquired: &ldquo;And hast thou not spoken to
  her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I had recovered somewhat, I told her that I was returning from
  Asia, that I had disjointed my arm near the city, and had suffered severely,
  but at the moment of leaving that hospitable house I saw that suffering in it
  was more to be wished for than delight in another place, that sickness there
  was better than health somewhere else. Confused too on her part, she listened
  to my words with bent head while drawing something with the reed on the
  saffron-colored sand. Afterward she raised her eyes, then looked down at the
  marks drawn already; once more she looked at me, as if to ask about
  something, and then fled on a sudden like a hamadryad before a dull
  faun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She must have beautiful eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As the sea&mdash;and I was drowned in them, as in the sea. Believe
  me that the archipelago is less blue. After a while a little son of Plautius
  ran up with a question. But I did not understand what he wanted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Athene!&rdquo; exclaimed Petronius, &ldquo;remove from the eyes
  of this youth the bandage with which Eros has bound them; if not, he will
  break his head against the columns of Venus&rsquo;s temple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O thou spring bud on the tree of life,&rdquo; said he, turning to
  Vinicius, &ldquo;thou first green shoot of the vine! Instead of taking thee
  to the Plautiuses, I ought to give command to bear thee to the house of
  Gelocius, where there is a school for youths unacquainted with
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou wish in particular?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what did she write on the sand? Was it not the name of Amor, or
  a heart pierced with his dart, or something of such sort, that one might know
  from it that the satyrs had whispered to the ear of that nymph various
  secrets of life? How couldst thou help looking on those marks?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is longer since I have put on the toga than seems to
  thee,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;and before little Aulus ran up, I looked
  carefully at those marks, for I know that frequently maidens in Greece and in
  Rome draw on the sand a confession which their lips will not utter. But guess
  what she drew!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it is other than I supposed, I shall not guess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, a fish. What did that mean,&mdash;that cold blood is flowing
  in her veins? So far I do not know; but thou, who hast called me a spring bud
  on the tree of life, wilt be able to understand the sign
  certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Carissime! ask such a thing of Pliny. He knows fish. If old Apicius
  were alive, he could tell thee something, for in the course of his life he
  ate more fish than could find place at one time in the bay of
  Naples.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Further conversation was interrupted, since they were borne into crowded
  streets where the noise of people hindered them.</p>

  <p>From the Vicus Apollinis they turned to the Boarium, and then entered the
  Forum Romanum, where on clear days, before sunset, crowds of idle people
  assembled to stroll among the columns, to tell and hear news, to see noted
  people borne past in litters, and finally to look in at the jewellery-shops,
  the book-shops, the arches where coin was changed, shops for silk, bronze,
  and all other articles with which the buildings covering that part of the
  market placed opposite the Capitol were filled.</p>

  <p>One-half of the Forum, immediately under the rock of the Capitol, was
  buried already in shade; but the columns of the temples, placed higher,
  seemed golden in the sunshine and the blue. Those lying lower cast lengthened
  shadows on marble slabs. The place was so filled with columns everywhere that
  the eye was lost in them as in a forest.</p>

  <p>Those buildings and columns seemed huddled together. They towered some
  above others, they stretched toward the right and the left, they climbed
  toward the height, and they clung to the wall of the Capitol, or some of them
  clung to others, like greater and smaller, thicker and thinner, white or gold
  colored tree-trunks, now blooming under architraves, flowers of the acanthus,
  now surrounded with Ionic corners, now finished with a simple Doric
  quadrangle. Above that forest gleamed colored triglyphs; from tympans stood
  forth the sculptured forms of gods; from the summits winged golden quadrigæ
  seemed ready to fly away through space into the blue dome, fixed serenely
  above that crowded place of temples. Through the middle of the market and
  along the edges of it flowed a river of people; crowds passed under the
  arches of the basilica of Julius Cæsar; crowds were sitting on the steps of
  Castor and Pollux, or walking around the temple of Vesta, resembling on that
  great marble background many-colored swarms of butterflies or beetles. Down
  immense steps, from the side of the temple on the Capitol dedicated to
  Jupiter Optimus Maximus, came new waves; at the rostra people listened to
  chance orators; in one place and another rose the shouts of hawkers selling
  fruit, wine, or water mixed with fig-juice; of tricksters; of venders of
  marvellous medicines; of soothsayers; of discoverers of hidden treasures; of
  interpreters of dreams. Here and there, in the tumult of conversations and
  cries, were mingled sounds of the Egyptian sistra, of the sambuké, or of
  Grecian flutes. Here and there the sick, the pious, or the afflicted were
  bearing offerings to the temples. In the midst of the people, on the stone
  flags, gathered flocks of doves, eager for the grain given them, and like
  movable many-colored and dark spots, now rising for a moment with a loud
  sound of wings, now dropping down again to places left vacant by people. From
  time to time the crowds opened before litters in which were visible the
  affected faces of women, or the heads of senators and knights, with features,
  as it were, rigid and exhausted from living. The many-tongued population
  repeated aloud their names, with the addition of some term of praise or
  ridicule. Among the unordered groups pushed from time to time, advancing with
  measured tread, parties of soldiers, or watchers, preserving order on the
  streets. Around about, the Greek language was heard as often as Latin.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who had not been in the city for a long time, looked with a
  certain curiosity on that swarm of people and on that Forum Romanum, which
  both dominated the sea of the world and was flooded by it, so that Petronius,
  who divined the thoughts of his companion, called it &ldquo;the nest of the
  Quirites&mdash;without the Quirites.&rdquo; In truth, the local element was
  well-nigh lost in that crowd, composed of all races and nations. There
  appeared Ethiopians, gigantic light-haired people from the distant north,
  Britons, Gauls, Germans, sloping-eyed dwellers of Lericum; people from the
  Euphrates and from the Indus, with beards dyed brick color; Syrians from the
  banks of the Orontes, with black and mild eyes; dwellers in the deserts of
  Arabia, dried up as a bone; Jews, with their flat breasts; Egyptians, with
  the eternal, indifferent smile on their faces; Numidians and Africans; Greeks
  from Hellas, who equally with the Romans commanded the city, but commanded
  through science, art, wisdom, and deceit; Greeks from the islands, from Asia
  Minor, from Egypt, from Italy, from Narbonic Gaul. In the throng of slaves,
  with pierced ears, were not lacking also freemen,&mdash;an idle population,
  which Cæsar amused, supported, even clothed,&mdash;and free visitors, whom
  the ease of life and the prospects of fortune enticed to the gigantic city;
  there was no lack of venal persons. There were priests of Serapis, with palm
  branches in their hands; priests of Isis, to whose altar more offerings were
  brought than to the temple of the Capitoline Jove; priests of Cybele, bearing
  in their hands golden ears of rice; and priests of nomad divinities; and
  dancers of the East with bright head-dresses, and dealers in amulets, and
  snake-tamers, and Chaldean seers; and, finally, people without any occupation
  whatever, who applied for grain every week at the storehouses on the Tiber,
  who fought for lottery-tickets to the Circus, who spent their nights in
  rickety houses of districts beyond the Tiber, and sunny and warm days under
  covered porticos, and in foul eating-houses of the Subura, on the Milvian
  bridge, or before the &ldquo;insulæ&rdquo; of the great, where from time to
  time remnants from the tables of slaves were thrown out to them.</p>

  <p>Petronius was well known to those crowds. Vinicius&rsquo;s ears were
  struck continually by &ldquo;Hic est!&rdquo; (Here he is). They loved him for
  his munificence; and his peculiar popularity increased from the time when
  they learned that he had spoken before Cæsar in opposition to the sentence of
  death issued against the whole &ldquo;familia,&rdquo; that is, against all
  the slaves of the prefect Pedanius Secundus, without distinction of sex or
  age, because one of them had killed that monster in a moment of despair.
  Petronius repeated in public, it is true, that it was all one to him, and
  that he had spoken to Cæsar only privately, as the arbiter elegantiarum whose
  æsthetic taste was offended by a barbarous slaughter befitting Scythians and
  not Romans. Nevertheless, people who were indignant because of the slaughter
  loved Petronius from that moment forth. But he did not care for their love.
  He remembered that that crowd of people had loved also Britannicus, poisoned
  by Nero; and Agrippina, killed at his command; and Octavia, smothered in hot
  steam at the Pandataria, after her veins had been opened previously; and
  Rubelius Plautus, who had been banished; and Thrasea, to whom any morning
  might bring a death sentence. The love of the mob might be considered rather
  of ill omen; and the sceptical Petronius was superstitious also. He had a
  twofold contempt for the multitude,&mdash;as an aristocrat and an æsthetic
  person. Men with the odor of roast beans, which they carried in their bosoms,
  and who besides were eternally hoarse and sweating from playing mora on the
  street-corners and peristyles, did not in his eyes deserve the term
  &ldquo;human.&rdquo; Hence he gave no answer whatever to the applause, or the
  kisses sent from lips here and there to him. He was relating to Marcus the
  case of Pedanius, reviling meanwhile the fickleness of that rabble which,
  next morning after the terrible butchery, applauded Nero on his way to the
  temple of Jupiter Stator. But he gave command to halt before the book-shop of
  Avirnus, and, descending from the litter, purchased an ornamented manuscript,
  which he gave to Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here is a gift for thee,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; answered Vinicius. Then, looking at the title, he
  inquired, &ldquo;&lsquo;Satyricon&rsquo;? Is this something new? Whose is
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine. But I do not wish to go in the road of Rufinus, whose history
  I was to tell thee, nor of Fabricius Veiento; hence no one knows of this, and
  do thou mention it to no man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast said that thou art no writer of verses,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius, looking at the middle of the manuscript; &ldquo;but here I see
  prose thickly interwoven with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When thou art reading, turn attention to Trimalchion&rsquo;s feast.
  As to verses, they have disgusted me, since Nero is writing an epic.
  Vitelius, when he wishes to relieve himself, uses ivory fingers to thrust
  down his throat; others serve themselves with flamingo feathers steeped in
  olive oil or in a decoction of wild thyme. I read Nero&rsquo;s poetry, and
  the result is immediate. Straightway I am able to praise it, if not with a
  clear conscience, at least with a clear stomach.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he stopped the litter again before the shop of
  Idomeneus the goldsmith, and, having settled the affair of the gems, gave
  command to bear the litter directly to Aulus&rsquo;s mansion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the road I will tell thee the story of Rufinus,&rdquo; said he,
  &ldquo;as proof of what vanity in an author may be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But before he had begun, they turned in to the Vicus Patricius, and soon
  found themselves before the dwelling of Aulus. A young and sturdy
  &ldquo;janitor&rdquo; opened the door leading to the ostium, over which a
  magpie confined in a cage greeted them noisily with the word,
  &ldquo;Salve!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the way from the second antechamber, called the ostium, to the atrium
  itself, Vinicius said,&mdash;&ldquo;Hast noticed that thee doorkeepers are
  without chains?&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a wonderful house,&rdquo; answered
  Petronius, in an undertone. &ldquo;Of course it is known to thee that
  Pomponia Græcina is suspected of entertaining that Eastern superstition which
  consists in honoring a certain Chrestos. It seems that Crispinilla rendered
  her this service,&mdash;she who cannot forgive Pomponia because one husband
  has sufficed her for a lifetime. A one-man Woman! To-day, in Rome, it is
  easier to get a half-plate of fresh mushrooms from Noricum than to find such.
  They tried her before a domestic court&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To thy judgment this is a wonderful house. Later on I will tell
  thee what I heard and saw in it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile they had entered the atrium. The slave appointed to it, called
  atriensis, sent a nomenclator to announce the guests; and Petronius, who,
  imagining that eternal sadness reigned in this severe house, had never been
  in it, looked around with astonishment, and as it were with a feeling of
  disappointment, for the atrium produced rather an impression of cheerfulness.
  A sheaf of bright light falling from above through a large opening broke into
  a thousand sparks on a fountain in a quadrangular little basin, called the
  impluvium, which was in the middle to receive rain falling through the
  opening during bad weather; this was surrounded by anemones and lilies. In
  that house a special love for lilies was evident, for there were whole clumps
  of them, both white and red; and, finally, sapphire irises, whose delicate
  leaves were as if silvered from the spray of the fountain. Among the moist
  mosses, in which lily-pots were hidden, and among the bunches of lilies were
  little bronze statues representing children and water-birds. In one corner a
  bronze fawn, as if wishing to drink, was inclining its greenish head,
  grizzled, too, by dampness. The floor of the atrium was of mosaic; the walls,
  faced partly with red marble and partly with wood, on which were painted
  fish, birds, and griffins, attracted the eye by the play of colors. From the
  door to the side chamber they were ornamented with tortoise-shell or even
  ivory; at the walls between the doors were statues of Aulus&rsquo;s
  ancestors. Everywhere calm plenty was evident, remote from excess, but noble
  and self-trusting.</p>

  <p>Petronius, who lived with incomparably greater show and elegance, could
  find nothing which offended his taste; and had just turned to Vinicius with
  that remark, when a slave, the velarius, pushed aside the curtain separating
  the atrium from the tablinum, and in the depth of the building appeared Aulus
  Plautius approaching hurriedly.</p>

  <p>He was a man nearing the evening of life, with a head whitened by hoar
  frost, but fresh, with an energetic face, a trifle too short, but still
  somewhat eagle-like. This time there was expressed on it a certain
  astonishment, and even alarm, because of the unexpected arrival of
  Nero&rsquo;s friend, companion, and suggester.</p>

  <p>Petronius was too much a man of the world and too quick not to notice
  this; hence, after the first greetings, he announced with all the eloquence
  and ease at his command that he had come to give thanks for the care which
  his sister&rsquo;s son had found in that house, and that gratitude alone was
  the cause of the visit, to which, moreover, he was emboldened by his old
  acquaintance with Aulus.</p>

  <p>Aulus assured him that he was a welcome guest; and as to gratitude, he
  declared that he had that feeling himself, though surely Petronius did not
  divine the cause of it.</p>

  <p>In fact, Petronius did not divine it. In vain did he raise his hazel eyes,
  endeavoring to remember the least service rendered to Aulus or to any one. He
  recalled none, unless it might be that which he intended to show Vinicius.
  Some such thing, it is true, might have happened involuntarily, but only
  involuntarily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have great love and esteem for Vespasian, whose life thou didst
  save,&rdquo; said Aulus, &ldquo;when he had the misfortune to doze while
  listening to Nero&rsquo;s verses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was fortunate,&rdquo; replied Petronius, &ldquo;for he did not
  hear them; but I will not deny that the matter might have ended with
  misfortune. Bronzebeard wished absolutely to send a centurion to him with the
  friendly advice to open his veins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou, Petronius, laughed him out of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is true, or rather it is not true. I told Nero that if Orpheus
  put wild beasts to sleep with song, his triumph was equal, since he had put
  Vespasian to sleep. Ahenobarbus may be blamed on condition that to a small
  criticism a great flattery be added. Our gracious Augusta, Poppæa,
  understands this to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! such are the times,&rdquo; answered Aulus. &ldquo;I lack two
  front teeth, knocked out by a stone from the hand of a Briton, I speak with a
  hiss; still my happiest days were passed in Britain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because they were days of victory,&rdquo; added Vinicius.</p>

  <p>But Petronius, alarmed lest the old general might begin a narrative of his
  former wars, changed the conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the neighborhood of Præneste country
  people found a dead wolf whelp with two heads; and during a storm about that
  time lightning struck off an angle of the temple of Luna,&mdash;a thing
  unparalleled, because of the late autumn. A certain Cotta, too, who had told
  this, added, while telling it, that the priests of that temple prophesied the
  fall of the city or, at least, the ruin of a great house,&mdash;ruin to be
  averted only by uncommon sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Aulus, when he had heard the narrative, expressed the opinion that such
  signs should not be neglected; that the gods might be angered by an over-
  measure of wickedness. In this there was nothing wonderful; and in such an
  event expiatory sacrifices were perfectly in order.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy house, Plautius, is not too large,&rdquo; answered Petronius,
  &ldquo;though a great man lives in it. Mine is indeed too large for such a
  wretched owner, though equally small. But if it is a question of the ruin of
  something as great, for example, as the domus transitoria, would it be worth
  while for us to bring offerings to avert that ruin?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Plautius did not answer that question,&mdash;a carefulness which touched
  even Petronius somewhat, for, with all his inability to feel the difference
  between good and evil, he had never been an informer; and it was possible to
  talk with him in perfect safety. He changed the conversation again,
  therefore, and began to praise Plautius&rsquo;s dwelling and the good taste
  which reigned in the house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is an ancient seat,&rdquo; said Plautius, &ldquo;in which
  nothing has been changed since I inherited it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After the curtain was pushed aside which divided the atrium from the
  tablinum, the house was open from end to end, so that through the tablinum
  and the following peristyle and the hall lying beyond it which was called the
  oecus, the glance extended to the garden, which seemed from a distance like a
  bright image set in a dark frame. Joyous, childlike laughter came from it to
  the atrium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, general!&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;permit us to listen from
  near by to that glad laughter which is of a kind heard so rarely in these
  days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; answered Plautius, rising; &ldquo;that is my
  little Aulus and Lygia, playing ball. But as to laughter, I think, Petronius,
  that our whole life is spent in it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Life deserves laughter, hence people laugh at it,&rdquo; answered
  Petronius, &ldquo;but laughter here has another sound.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius does not laugh for days in succession,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius; &ldquo;but then he laughs entire nights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus conversing, they passed through the length of the house and reached
  the garden, where Lygia and little Aulus were playing with balls, which
  slaves, appointed to that game exclusively and called spheristæ, picked up
  and placed in their hands. Petronius cast a quick passing glance at Lygia;
  little Aulus, seeing Vinicius, ran to greet him; but the young tribune, going
  forward, bent his head before the beautiful maiden, who stood with a ball in
  her hand, her hair blown apart a little. She was somewhat out of breath, and
  flushed.</p>

  <p>In the garden triclinium, shaded by ivy, grapes, and woodbine, sat
  Pomponia Græcina; hence they went to salute her. She was known to Petronius,
  though he did not visit Plautius, for he had seen her at the house of
  Antistia, the daughter of Rubelius Plautus, and besides at the house of
  Seneca and Polion. He could not resist a certain admiration with which he was
  filled by her face, pensive but mild, by the dignity of her bearing, by her
  movements, by her words. Pomponia disturbed his understanding of women to
  such a degree that that man, corrupted to the marrow of his bones, and self-
  confident as no one in Rome, not only felt for her a kind of esteem, but even
  lost his previous self-confidence. And now, thanking her for her care of
  Vinicius, he thrust in, as it were involuntarily, &ldquo;domina,&rdquo; which
  never occurred to him when speaking, for example, to Calvia Crispinilla,
  Scribonia, Veleria, Solina, and other women of high society. After he had
  greeted her and returned thanks, he began to complain that he saw her so
  rarely, that it was not possible to meet her either in the Circus or the
  Amphitheatre; to which she answered calmly, laying her hand on the hand of
  her husband:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are growing old, and love our domestic quiet more and more, both
  of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius wished to oppose; but Aulus Plautius added in his hissing
  voice,&mdash;&ldquo;And we feel stranger and stranger among people who give
  Greek names to our Roman divinities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods have become for some time mere figures of rhetoric,&rdquo;
  replied Petronius, carelessly. &ldquo;But since Greek rhetoricians taught us,
  it is easier for me even to say Hera than Juno.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned his eyes then to Pomponia, as if to signify that in presence of
  her no other divinity could come to his mind: and then he began to contradict
  what she had said touching old age.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People grow old quickly, it is true; but there are some who live
  another life entirely, and there are faces moreover which Saturn seems to
  forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius said this with a certain sincerity even, for Pomponia Græcina,
  though descending from the midday of life, had preserved an uncommon
  freshness of face; and since she had a small head and delicate features, she
  produced at times, despite her dark robes, despite her solemnity and sadness,
  the impression of a woman quite young.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile little Aulus, who had become uncommonly friendly with Vinicius
  during his former stay in the house, approached the young man and entreated
  him to play ball. Lygia herself entered the triclinium after the little boy.
  Under the climbing ivy, with the light quivering on her face, she seemed to
  Petronius more beautiful than at the first glance, and really like some
  nymph. As he had not spoken to her thus far, he rose, inclined his head, and,
  instead of the usual expressions of greeting, quoted the words with which
  Ulysses greeted Nausikaa,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I supplicate thee, O queen, whether thou art some goddess or a
  mortal! If thou art one of the daughters of men who dwell on earth, thrice
  blessed are thy father and thy lady mother, and thrice blessed thy
  brethren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The exquisite politeness of this man of the world pleased even Pomponia.
  As to Lygia, she listened, confused and flushed, without boldness to raise
  her eyes. But a wayward smile began to quiver at the corners of her lips, and
  on her face a struggle was evident between the timidity of a maiden and the
  wish to answer; but clearly the wish was victorious, for, looking quickly at
  Petronius, she answered him all at once with the words of that same Nausikaa,
  quoting them at one breath, and a little like a lesson learned,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stranger, thou seemest no evil man nor foolish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then she turned and ran out as a frightened bird runs.</p>

  <p>This time the turn for astonishment came to Petronius, for he had not
  expected to hear verses of Homer from the lips of a maiden of whose barbarian
  extraction he had heard previously from Vinicius. Hence he looked with an
  inquiring glance at Pomponia; but she could not give him an answer, for she
  was looking at that moment, with a smile, at the pride reflected on the face
  of her husband.</p>

  <p>He was not able to conceal that pride. First, he had become attached to
  Lygia as to his own daughter; and second, in spite of his old Roman
  prejudices, which commanded him to thunder against Greek and the spread of
  the language, he considered it as the summit of social polish. He himself had
  never been able to learn it well; over this he suffered in secret. He was
  glad, therefore, that an answer was given in the language and poetry of Homer
  to this exquisite man both of fashion and letters, who was ready to consider
  Plautius&rsquo;s house as barbarian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have in the house a pedagogue, a Greek,&rdquo; said he, turning
  to Petronius, &ldquo;who teaches our boy, and the maiden overhears the
  lessons. She is a wagtail yet, but a dear one, to which we have both grown
  attached.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius looked through the branches of woodbine into the garden, and at
  the three persons who were playing there. Vinicius had thrown aside his toga,
  and, wearing only his tunic, was striking the ball, which Lygia, standing
  opposite, with raised arms was trying to catch. The maiden did not make a
  great impression on Petronius at the first glance; she seemed to him too
  slender. But from the moment when he saw her more nearly in the triclinium he
  thought to himself that Aurora might look like her; and as a judge he
  understood that in her there was something uncommon. He considered everything
  and estimated everything; hence her face, rosy and clear, her fresh lips, as
  if set for a kiss, her eyes blue as the azure of the sea, the alabaster
  whiteness of her forehead, the wealth of her dark hair, with the reflection
  of amber or Corinthian bronze gleaming in its folds, her slender neck, the
  divine slope of her shoulders, the whole posture, flexible, slender, young
  with the youth of May and of freshly opened flowers. The artist was roused in
  him, and the worshipper of beauty, who felt that beneath a statue of that
  maiden one might write &ldquo;Spring.&rdquo; All at once he remembered
  Chrysothemis, and pure laughter seized him. Chrysothemis seemed to him, with
  golden powder on her hair and darkened brows, to be fabulously
  faded,&mdash;something in the nature of a yellowed rose-tree shedding its
  leaves. But still Rome envied him that Chrysothemis. Then he recalled Poppæa;
  and that most famous Poppæa also seemed to him soulless, a waxen mask. In
  that maiden with Tanagrian outlines there was not only spring, but a radiant
  soul, which shone through her rosy body as a flame through a lamp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius is right,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and my Chrysothemis is
  old, old!&mdash;as Troy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Pomponia Græcina, and, pointing to the garden,
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;I understand now, domina, why thou and thy husband prefer
  this house to the Circus and to feasts on the Palatine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered she, turning her eyes in the direction of
  little Aulus and Lygia.</p>

  <p>But the old general began to relate the history of the maiden, and what he
  had heard years before from Atelius Hister about the Lygian people who lived
  in the gloom of the North.</p>

  <p>The three outside had finished playing ball, and for some time had been
  walking along the sand of the garden, appearing against the dark background
  of myrtles and cypresses like three white statues. Lygia held little Aulus by
  the hand. After they had walked a while they sat on a bench near the
  fish-pond, which occupied the middle of the garden. After a time Aulus sprang
  up to frighten the fish in the transparent water, but Vinicius continued the
  conversation begun during the walk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, in a low, quivering voice, scarcely audible;
  &ldquo;barely had I cast aside the pretexta, when I was sent to the legions
  in Asia. I had not become acquainted with the city, nor with life, nor with
  love. I know a small bit of Anacreon by heart, and Horace; but I cannot like
  Petronius quote verses, when reason is dumb from admiration and unable to
  find its own words. While a youth I went to school to Musonius, who told me
  that happiness consists in wishing what the gods wish, and therefore depends
  on our will. I think, however, that it is something else,&mdash;something
  greater and more precious, which depends not on the will, for love only can
  give it. The gods themselves seek that happiness; hence I too, O Lygia, who
  have not known love thus far, follow in their footsteps. I also seek her who
  would give me happiness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was silent&mdash;and for a time there was nothing to be heard save the
  light plash of the water into which little Aulus was throwing pebbles to
  frighten the fish; but after a while Vinicius began again in a voice still
  softer and lower,&mdash;&ldquo;But thou knowest of Vespasian&rsquo;s son
  Titus? They say that he had scarcely ceased to be a youth when he so loved
  Berenice that grief almost drew the life out of him. So could I too love, O
  Lygia! Riches, glory, power are mere smoke, vanity! The rich man will find a
  richer than himself; the greater glory of another will eclipse a man who is
  famous; a strong man will be conquered by a stronger. But can Cæsar himself,
  can any god even, experience greater delight or be happier than a simple
  mortal at the moment when at his breast there is breathing another dear
  breast, or when he kisses beloved lips? Hence love makes us equal to the
  gods, O Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>And she listened with alarm, with astonishment, and at the same time as if
  she were listening to the sound of a Grecian flute or a cithara. It seemed to
  her at moments that Vinicius was singing a kind of wonderful song, which was
  instilling itself into her ears, moving the blood in her, and penetrating her
  heart with a faintness, a fear, and a kind of uncomprehended delight. It
  seemed to her also that he was telling something which was in her before, but
  of which she could not give account to herself. She felt that he was rousing
  in her something which had been sleeping hitherto, and that in that moment a
  hazy dream was changing into a form more and more definite, more pleasing,
  more beautiful.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sun had passed the Tiber long since, and had sunk low over
  the Janiculum. On the motionless cypresses ruddy light was falling, and the
  whole atmosphere was filled with it. Lygia raised on Vinicius her blue eyes
  as if roused from sleep; and he, bending over her with a prayer quivering in
  his eyes, seemed on a sudden, in the reflections of evening, more beautiful
  than all men, than all Greek and Roman gods whose statues she had seen on the
  façades of temples. And with his fingers he clasped her arm lightly just
  above the wrist and asked,&mdash;&ldquo;Dost thou not divine what I say to
  thee, Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; whispered she as answer, in a voice so low that Vinicius
  barely heard it.</p>

  <p>But he did not believe her, and, drawing her hand toward him more
  vigorously, he would have drawn it to his heart, which, under the influence
  of desire roused by the marvellous maiden, was beating like a hammer, and
  would have addressed burning words to her directly had not old Aulus appeared
  on a path set in a frame of myrtles, who said, while approaching
  them,&mdash;&ldquo;The sun is setting; so beware of the evening coolness, and
  do not trifle with Libitina.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Vinicius; &ldquo;I have not put on my toga yet,
  and I do not feel the cold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But see, barely half the sun&rsquo;s shield is looking from behind
  the hill. That is a sweet climate of Sicily, where people gather on the
  square before sunset and take farewell of disappearing Phoebus with a choral
  song.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And, forgetting that a moment earlier he had warned them against Libitina,
  he began to tell about Sicily, where he had estates and large cultivated
  fields which he loved. He stated also that it had come to his mind more than
  once to remove to Sicily, and live out his life there in quietness. &ldquo;He
  whose head winters have whitened has bad enough of hoar frost. Leaves are not
  falling from the trees yet, and the sky smiles on the city lovingly; but when
  the grapevines grow yellow-leaved, when snow falls on the Alban hills, and
  the gods visit the Campania with piercing wind, who knows but I may remove
  with my entire household to my quiet country-seat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wouldst thou leave Rome?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius, with sudden
  alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have wished to do so this long time, for it is quieter in Sicily
  and safer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And again he fell to praising his gardens, his herds, his house hidden in
  green, and the hills grown over with thyme and savory, among which were
  swarms of buzzing bees. But Vinicius paid no heed to that bucolic note; and
  from thinking only of this, that he might lose Lygia, he looked toward
  Petronius as if expecting salvation from him alone.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Petronius, sitting near Pomponia, was admiring the view of the
  setting sun, the garden, and the people standing near the fish-pond. Their
  white garments on the dark background of the myrtles gleamed like gold from
  the evening rays. On the sky the evening light had begun to assume purple and
  violet hues, and to change like an opal. A strip of the sky became lily-
  colored. The dark silhouettes of the cypresses grew still more pronounced
  than during bright daylight. In the people, in the trees, in the whole garden
  there reigned an evening calm.</p>

  <p>That calm struck Petronius, and it struck him especially in the people. In
  the faces of Pomponia, old Aulus, their son, and Lygia there was something
  such as he did not see in the faces which surrounded him every day, or rather
  every night. There was a certain light, a certain repose, a certain serenity,
  flowing directly from the life which all lived there. And with a species of
  astonishment he thought that a beauty and sweetness might exist which he, who
  chased after beauty and sweetness continually, had not known. He could not
  hide the thought in himself, and said, turning to Pomponia,&mdash;&ldquo;I am
  considering in my soul how different this world of yours is from the world
  which our Nero rules.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her delicate face toward the evening light, and said with
  simplicity,&mdash;&ldquo;Not Nero, but God, rules the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed. Near the triclinium were heard in the alley,
  the steps of the old general, Vinicius, Lygia, and little Aulus; but before
  they arrived, Petronius had put another question&mdash;&ldquo;But believest
  thou in the gods, then, Pomponia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe in God, who is one, just, and all-powerful,&rdquo;
  answered the wife of Aulus Plautius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch03"
     name="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;She believes in God who is one, all-powerful, and
  just,&rdquo; said Petronius, when he found himself again in the litter with
  Vinicius. &ldquo;If her God is all-powerful, He controls life and death; and
  if He is just, He sends death justly. Why, then, does Pomponia wear mourning
  for Julius? In mourning for Julius she blames her God. I must repeat this
  reasoning to our Bronzebeard, the monkey, since I consider that in dialectics
  I am the equal of Socrates. As to women, I agree that each has three or four
  souls, but none of them a reasoning one. Let Pomponia meditate with Seneca or
  Cornutus over the question of what their great Logos is. Let them summon at
  once the shades of Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, and Plato, who are as much
  wearied there in Cimmerian regions as a finch in a cage. I wished to talk
  with her and with Plautius about something else. By the holy stomach of the
  Egyptian Isis! If I had told them right out directly why we came, I suppose
  that their virtue would have made as much noise as a bronze shield under the
  blow of a club. And I did not dare to tell! Wilt thou believe, Vinicius, I
  did not dare! Peacocks are beautiful birds, but they have too shrill a cry. I
  feared an outburst. But I must praise thy choice. A real &rsquo;rosy-fingered
  Aurora.&rsquo; And knowest thou what she reminded me of too?&mdash;Spring!
  not our spring in Italy, where an apple-tree merely puts forth a blossom here
  and there, and olive groves grow gray, just as they were gray before, but the
  spring which I saw once in Helvetia,&mdash;young, fresh, bright green. By
  that pale moon, I do not wonder at thee, Marcus; but know that thou art
  loving Diana, because Aulus and Pomponia are ready to tear thee to pieces, as
  the dogs once tore Actæon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was silent a time without raising his head; then he began to
  speak with a voice broken by passion,&mdash;&ldquo;I desired her before, but
  now I desire her still more. When I caught her arm, flame embraced me. I must
  have her. Were I Zeus, I would surround her with a cloud, as he surrounded
  Io, or I would fall on her in rain, as he fell on Danaë; I would kiss her
  lips till it pained! I would hear her scream in my arms. I would kill Aulus
  and Pomponia, and bear her home in my arms. I will not sleep to-night. I will
  give command to flog one of my slaves, and listen to his
  groans&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Calm thyself,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;Thou hast the longing
  of a carpenter from the Subura.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All one to me what thou sayst. I must have her. I have turned to
  thee for aid; but if thou wilt not find it, I shall find it myself. Aulus
  considers Lygia as a daughter; why should I look on her as a slave? And since
  there is no other way, let her ornament the door of my house, let her anoint
  it with wolf&rsquo;s fat, and let her sit at my hearth as wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Calm thyself, mad descendant of consuls. We do not lead in
  barbarians bound behind our cars, to make wives of their daughters. Beware of
  extremes. Exhaust simple, honorable methods, and give thyself and me time for
  meditation. Chrysothemis seemed to me too a daughter of Jove, and still I did
  not marry her, just as Nero did not marry Acte, though they called her a
  daughter of King Attalus. Calm thyself! Think that if she wishes to leave
  Aulus for thee, he will have no right to detain her. Know also that thou art
  not burning alone, for Eros has roused in her the flame too. I saw that, and
  it is well to believe me. Have patience. There is a way to do everything, but
  to-day I have thought too much already, and it tires me. But I promise that
  to-morrow I will think of thy love, and unless Petronius is not Petronius, he
  will discover some method.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were both silent again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee,&rdquo; said Vinicius at last. &ldquo;May Fortune be
  bountiful to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be patient.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither hast thou given command to bear us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Chrysothemis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art happy in possessing her whom thou lovest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I? Dost thou know what amuses me yet in Chrysothemis? This, that
  she is false to me with my freedman Theokles, and thinks that I do not notice
  it. Once I loved her, but now she amuses me with her lying and stupidity.
  Come with me to her. Should she begin to flirt with thee, and write letters
  on the table with her fingers steeped in wine, know that I shall not be
  jealous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he gave command to bear them both to Chrysothemis.</p>

  <p>But in the entrance Petronius put his hand on Vinicius&rsquo;s shoulder,
  and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Wait; it seems to me that I have discovered a
  plan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May all the gods reward thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have it! I judge that this plan is infallible. Knowest what,
  Marcus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I listen to thee, my wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, in a few days the divine Lygia will partake of
  Demeter&rsquo;s grain in thy house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art greater than Cæsar!&rdquo; exclaimed Vinicius with
  enthusiasm.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In fact, Petronius kept his promise. He slept all the day
  following his visit to Chrysothemis, it is true; but in the evening he gave
  command to bear him to the Palatine, where he had a confidential conversation
  with Nero; in consequence of this, on the third day a centurion, at the head
  of some tens of pretorian soldiers, appeared before the house of
  Plautius.</p>

  <p>The period was uncertain and terrible. Messengers of this kind were more
  frequently heralds of death. So when the centurion struck the hammer at
  Aulus&rsquo;s door, and when the guard of the atrium announced that there
  were soldiers in the anteroom, terror rose through the whole house. The
  family surrounded the old general at once, for no one doubted that danger
  hung over him above all. Pomponia, embracing his neck with her arms, clung to
  him with all her strength, and her blue lips moved quickly while uttering
  some whispered phrase. Lygia, with a face pale as linen, kissed his hand;
  little Aulus clung to his toga. From the corridor, from chambers in the lower
  story intended for servant-women and attendants, from the bath, from the
  arches of lower dwellings, from the whole house, crowds of slaves began to
  hurry out, and the cries of &ldquo;Heu! heu, me miserum!&rdquo; were heard.
  The women broke into great weeping; some scratched their cheeks, or covered
  their heads with kerchiefs.</p>

  <p>Only the old general himself, accustomed for years to look death straight
  in the eye, remained calm, and his short eagle face became as rigid as if
  chiselled from stone. After a while, when he had silenced the uproar, and
  commanded the attendants to disappear, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Let me go,
  Pomponia. If my end has come, we shall have time to take leave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he pushed her aside gently; but she said,&mdash;&ldquo;God grant thy
  fate and mine to be one, O Aulus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, failing on her knees, she began to pray with that force which fear
  for some dear one alone can give.</p>

  <p>Aulus passed out to the atrium, where the centurion was waiting for him.
  It was old Caius Hasta, his former subordinate and companion in British
  wars.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I greet thee, general,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I bring a command,
  and the greeting of Cæsar; here are the tablets and the signet to show that I
  come in his name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am thankful to Cæsar for the greeting, and I shall obey the
  command,&rdquo; answered Aulus. &ldquo;Be welcome, Hasta, and say what
  command thou hast brought.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus Plautius,&rdquo; began Hasta, &ldquo;Cæsar has learned that
  in thy house is dwelling the daughter of the king of the Lygians, whom that
  king during the life of the divine Claudius gave into the hands of the Romans
  as a pledge that the boundaries of the empire would never be violated by the
  Lygians. The divine Nero is grateful to thee, O general, because thou hast
  given her hospitality in thy house for so many years; but, not wishing to
  burden thee longer, and considering also that the maiden as a hostage should
  be under the guardianship of Cæsar and the senate, he commands thee to give
  her into my hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Aulus was too much a soldier and too much a veteran to permit himself
  regret in view of an order, or vain words, or complaint. A slight wrinkle of
  sudden anger and pain, however, appeared on his forehead. Before that frown
  legions in Britain had trembled on a time, and even at that moment fear was
  evident on the face of Hasta. But in view of the order, Aulus Plautius felt
  defenceless. He looked for some time at the tablets and the signet; then
  raising his eyes to the old centurion, he said calmly,&mdash;&ldquo;Wait,
  Hasta, in the atrium till the hostage is delivered to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After these words he passed to the other end of the house, to the hall
  called oecus, where Pomponia Græcina, Lygia, and little Aulus were waiting
  for him in fear and alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Death threatens no one, nor banishment to distant islands,&rdquo;
  said he; &ldquo;still Cæsar&rsquo;s messenger is a herald of misfortune. It
  is a question of thee, Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of Lygia?&rdquo; exclaimed Pomponia, with astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Aulus.</p>

  <p>And turning to the maiden, he began: &ldquo;Lygia, thou wert reared in our
  house as our own child; I and Pomponia love thee as our daughter. But know
  this, that thou art not our daughter. Thou art a hostage, given by thy people
  to Rome, and guardianship over thee belongs to Cæsar. Now Cæsar takes thee
  from our house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The general spoke calmly, but with a certain strange, unusual voice. Lygia
  listened to his words, blinking, as if not understanding what the question
  was. Pomponia&rsquo;s cheeks became pallid. In the doors leading from the
  corridor to the oecus, terrified faces of slaves began to show themselves a
  second time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The will of Cæsar must be accomplished,&rdquo; said Aulus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus!&rdquo; exclaimed Pomponia, embracing the maiden with her
  arms, as if wishing to defend her, &ldquo;it would be better for her to
  die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia, nestling up to her breast, repeated, &ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo;
  unable in her sobbing to find other words.</p>

  <p>On Aulus&rsquo;s face anger and pain were reflected again. &ldquo;If I
  were alone in the world,&rdquo; said he, gloomily, &ldquo;I would not
  surrender her alive, and my relatives might give offerings this day to
  &lsquo;Jupiter Liberator.&rsquo; But I have not the right to kill thee and
  our child, who may live to happier times. I will go to Cæsar this day, and
  implore him to change his command. Whether he will hear me, I know not.
  Meanwhile, farewell, Lygia, and know that I and Pomponia ever bless the day
  in which thou didst take thy seat at our hearth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he placed his hand on her head; but though he strove to
  preserve his calmness, when Lygia turned to him eyes filled with tears, and
  seizing his hand pressed it to her lips, his voice was filled with deep
  fatherly sorrow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, our joy, and the light of our eyes,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>And he went to the atrium quickly, so as not to let himself be conquered
  by emotion unworthy of a Roman and a general.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Pomponia, when she had conducted Lygia to the cubiculum, began
  to comfort, console, and encourage her, uttering words meanwhile which
  sounded strangely in that house, where near them in an adjoining chamber the
  lararium remained yet, and where the hearth was on which Aulus Plautius,
  faithful to ancient usage, made offerings to the household divinities. Now
  the hour of trial had come. On a time Virginius had pierced the bosom of his
  own daughter to save her from the hands of Appius; still earlier Lucretia had
  redeemed her shame with her life. The house of Cæsar is a den of infamy, of
  evil, of crime. But we, Lygia, know why we have not the right to raise hands
  on ourselves! Yes! The law under which we both live is another, a greater, a
  holier, but it gives permission to defend oneself from evil and shame even
  should it happen to pay for that defence with life and torment. Whoso goes
  forth pure from the dwelling of corruption has the greater merit thereby. The
  earth is that dwelling; but fortunately life is one twinkle of the eye, and
  resurrection is only from the grave; beyond that not Nero, but Mercy bears
  rule, and there instead of pain is delight, there instead of tears is
  rejoicing.</p>

  <p>Next she began to speak of herself. Yes! she was calm; but in her breast
  there was no lack of painful wounds. For example, Aulus was a cataract on her
  eye; the fountain of light had not flowed to him yet. Neither was it
  permitted her to rear her son in Truth. When she thought, therefore, that it
  might be thus to the end of her life, and that for them a moment of
  separation might come which would be a hundred times more grievous and
  terrible than that temporary one over which they were both suffering then,
  she could not so much as understand how she might be happy even in heaven
  without them. And she had wept many nights through already, she had passed
  many nights in prayer, imploring grace and mercy. But she offered her
  suffering to God, and waited and trusted. And now, when a new blow struck
  her, when the tyrant&rsquo;s command took from her a dear one,&mdash;the one
  whom Aulus had called the light of their eyes,&mdash;she trusted yet,
  believing that there was a power greater than Nero&rsquo;s and a mercy
  mightier than his anger.</p>

  <p>And she pressed the maiden&rsquo;s head to her bosom still more firmly.
  Lygia dropped to her knees after a while, and, covering her eyes in the folds
  of Pomponia&rsquo;s peplus, she remained thus a long time in silence; but
  when she stood up again, some calmness was evident on her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I grieve for thee, mother, and for father and for my brother; but I
  know that resistance is useless, and would destroy all of us. I promise thee
  that in the house of Cæsar I will never forget thy words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once more she threw her arms around Pomponia&rsquo;s neck; then both went
  out to the oecus, and she took farewell of little Aulus, of the old Greek
  their teacher, of the dressing-maid who had been her nurse, and of all the
  slaves. One of these, a tall and broad-shouldered Lygian, called Ursus in the
  house, who with other servants had in his time gone with Lygia&rsquo;s mother
  and her to the camp of the Romans, fell now at her feet, and then bent down
  to the knees of Pomponia, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;O domina! permit me to go with
  my lady, to serve her and watch over her in the house of Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art not our servant, but Lygia&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered
  Pomponia; &ldquo;but if they admit thee through Cæsar&rsquo;s doors, in what
  way wilt thou be able to watch over her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not, domina; I know only that iron breaks in my hands just
  as wood does.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Aulus, who came up at that moment, had heard what the question was,
  not only did he not oppose the wishes of Ursus, but he declared that he had
  not even the right to detain him. They were sending away Lygia as a hostage
  whom Cæsar had claimed, and they were obliged in the same way to send her
  retinue, which passed with her to the control of Cæsar. Here he whispered to
  Pomponia that under the form of an escort she could add as many slaves as she
  thought proper, for the centurion could not refuse to receive them.</p>

  <p>There was a certain comfort for Lygia in this. Pomponia also was glad that
  she could surround her with servants of her own choice. Therefore, besides
  Ursus, she appointed to her the old tire-woman, two maidens from Cyprus well
  skilled in hair-dressing, and two German maidens for the bath. Her choice
  fell exclusively on adherents of the new faith; Ursus, too, had professed it
  for a number of years. Pomponia could count on the faithfulness of those
  servants, and at the same time consoled herself with the thought that soon
  grains of truth would be in Cæsar&rsquo;s house.</p>

  <p>She wrote a few words also, committing care over Lygia to Nero&rsquo;s
  freedwoman, Acte. Pomponia had not seen her, it is true, at meetings of
  confessors of the new faith; but she had heard from them that Acte had never
  refused them a service, and that she read the letters of Paul of Tarsus
  eagerly. It was known to her also that the young freedwoman lived in
  melancholy, that she was a person different from all other women of
  Nero&rsquo;s house, and that in general she was the good spirit of the
  palace.</p>

  <p>Hasta engaged to deliver the letter himself to Acte. Considering it
  natural that the daughter of a king should have a retinue of her own
  servants, he did not raise the least difficulty in taking them to the palace,
  but wondered rather that there should be so few. He begged haste, however,
  fearing lest he might be suspected of want of zeal in carrying out
  orders.</p>

  <p>The moment of parting came. The eyes of Pomponia and Lygia were filled
  with fresh tears; Aulus placed his hand on her head again, and after a while
  the soldiers, followed by the cry of little Aulus, who in defence of his
  sister threatened the centurion with his small fists, conducted Lygia to
  Cæsar&rsquo;s house.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Abduction.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The old general gave command to prepare his litter at once; meanwhile,
  shutting himself up with Pomponia in the pinacotheca adjoining the oecus, he
  said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;Listen to me, Pomponia. I will go to Cæsar, though
  I judge that my visit will be useless; and though Seneca&rsquo;s word means
  nothing with Nero now, I will go also to Seneca. To-day Sophonius,
  Tigellinus, Petronius, or Vatinius have more influence. As to Cæsar, perhaps
  he has never even heard of the Lygian people; and if he has demanded the
  delivery of Lygia, the hostage, he has done so because some one persuaded him
  to it,&mdash;it is easy to guess who could do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to him quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it Petronius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed; then the general continued,&mdash;&ldquo;See
  what it is to admit over the threshold any of those people without conscience
  or honor. Cursed be the moment in which Vinicius entered our house, for he
  brought Petronius. Woe to Lygia, since those men are not seeking a hostage,
  but a concubine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And his speech became more hissing than usual, because of helpless rage
  and of sorrow for his adopted daughter. He struggled with himself some time,
  and only his clenched fists showed how severe was the struggle within
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have revered the gods so far,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but at this
  moment I think that not they are over the world, but one mad, malicious
  monster named Nero.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus,&rdquo; said Pomponia. &ldquo;Nero is only a handful of
  rotten dust before God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Aulus began to walk with long steps over the mosaic of the
  pinacotheca. In his life there had been great deeds, but no great
  misfortunes; hence he was unused to them. The old soldier had grown more
  attached to Lygia than he himself had been aware of, and now he could not be
  reconciled to the thought that he had lost her. Besides, he felt humiliated.
  A hand was weighing on him which he despised, and at the same time he felt
  that before its power his power was as nothing.</p>

  <p>But when at last he stifled in himself the anger which disturbed his
  thoughts, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;I judge that Petronius has not taken her from
  us for Cæsar, since he would not offend Poppæa. Therefore he took her either
  for himself or Vinicius. Today I will discover this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And after a while the litter bore him in the direction of the Palatine.
  Pomponia, when left alone, went to little Aulus, who did not cease crying for
  his sister, or threatening Cæsar.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Aulus had judged rightly that he would not be admitted to
  Nero&rsquo;s presence. They told him that Cæsar was occupied in singing with
  the lute-player, Terpnos, and that in general he did not receive those whom
  he himself had not summoned. In other words, that Aulus must not attempt in
  future to see him.</p>

  <p>Seneca, though ill with a fever, received the old general with due honor;
  but when he had heard what the question was, he laughed bitterly, and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;I can render thee only one service, noble Plautius, not to
  show Cæsar at any time that my heart feels thy pain, or that I should like to
  aid thee; for should Cæsar have the least suspicion on this head, know that
  he would not give thee back Lygia, though for no other reason than to spite
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not advise him, either, to go to Tigellinus or Vatinius or
  Vitelius. It might be possible to do something with them through money;
  perhaps, also, they would like to do evil to Petronius, whose influence they
  were trying to undermine, but most likely they would disclose before Nero how
  dear Lygia was to Plautius, and then Nero would all the more resolve not to
  yield her to him. Here the old sage began to speak with a biting irony, which
  he turned against himself: &ldquo;Thou hast been silent, Plautius, thou hast
  been silent for whole years, and Cæsar does not like those who are silent.
  How couldst thou help being carried away by his beauty, his virtue, his
  singing, his declamation, his chariot-driving, and his verses? Why didst thou
  not glorify the death of Britannicus, and repeat panegyrics in honor of the
  mother-slayer, and not offer congratulations after the stifling of Octavia?
  Thou art lacking in foresight, Aulus, which we who live happily at the court
  possess in proper measure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he raised a goblet which he carried at his belt, took water
  from a fountain at the impluvium, freshened his burning lips, and
  continued,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, Nero has a grateful heart. He loves thee because
  thou hast served Rome and glorified its name at the ends of the earth; he
  loves me because I was his master in youth. Therefore, seest thou, I know
  that this water is not poisoned, and I drink it in peace. Wine in my own
  house would be less reliable. If thou art thirsty, drink boldly of this
  water. The aqueducts bring it from beyond the Alban hills, and any one
  wishing to poison it would have to poison every fountain in Rome. As thou
  seest, it is possible yet to be safe in this world and to have a quiet old
  age. I am sick, it is true, but rather in soul than in body.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was true. Seneca lacked the strength of soul which Cornutus
  possessed, for example, or Thrasea; hence his life was a series of
  concessions to crime. He felt this himself; he understood that an adherent of
  the principles of Zeno, of Citium, should go by another road, and he suffered
  more from that cause than from the fear of death itself.</p>

  <p>But the general interrupted these reflections full of grief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble Annæus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know how Cæsar rewarded thee
  for the care with which thou didst surround his years of youth. But the
  author of the removal of Lygia is Petronius. Indicate to me a method against
  him, indicate the influences to which he yields, and use besides with him all
  the eloquence with which friendship for me of long standing can inspire
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius and I,&rdquo; answered Seneca, &ldquo;are men of two
  opposite camps; I know of no method against him, he yields to no man&rsquo;s
  influence. Perhaps with all his corruption he is worthier than those
  scoundrels with whom Nero surrounds himself at present. But to show him that
  he has done an evil deed is to lose time simply. Petronius has lost long
  since that faculty which distinguishes good from evil. Show him that his act
  is ugly, he will be ashamed of it. When I see him, I will say, &rsquo;Thy act
  is worthy of a freedman.&rsquo; If that will not help thee, nothing
  can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks for that, even,&rdquo; answered the general.</p>

  <p>Then he gave command to carry him to the house of Vinicius, whom he found
  at sword practice with his domestic trainer. Aulus was borne away by terrible
  anger at sight of the young man occupied calmly with fencing during the
  attack on Lygia; and barely had the curtain dropped behind the trainer when
  this anger burst forth in a torrent of bitter reproaches and injuries. But
  Vinicius, when he learned that Lygia had been carried away, grew so terribly
  pale that Aulus could not for even an instant suspect him of sharing in the
  deed. The young man&rsquo;s forehead was covered with sweat; the blood, which
  had rushed to his heart for a moment, returned to his face in a burning wave;
  his eyes began to shoot sparks, his mouth to hurl disconnected questions.
  Jealousy and rage tossed him in turn, like a tempest. It seemed to him that
  Lygia, once she had crossed the threshold of Cæsar&rsquo;s house, was lost to
  him absolutely. When Aulus pronounced the name of Petronius, suspicion flew
  like a lightning flash through the young soldier&rsquo;s mind, that Petronius
  had made sport of him, and either wanted to win new favor from Nero by the
  gift of Lygia, or keep her for himself. That any one who had seen Lygia would
  not desire her at once, did not find a place in his head. Impetuousness,
  inherited in his family, carried him away like a wild horse, and took from
  him presence of mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;General,&rdquo; said he, with a broken voice, &ldquo;return home
  and wait for me. Know that if Petronius were my own father, I would avenge on
  him the wrong done to Lygia. Return home and wait for me. Neither Petronius
  nor Cæsar will have her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he went with clinched fists to the waxed masks standing clothed in
  the atrium, and burst out,&mdash;&ldquo;By those mortal masks! I would rather
  kill her and myself.&rdquo; When he had said this, he sent another
  &ldquo;Wait for me&rdquo; after Aulus, then ran forth like a madman from the
  atrium, and flew to Petronius&rsquo;s house, thrusting pedestrians aside on
  the way.</p>

  <p>Aulus returned home with a certain encouragement. He judged that if
  Petronius had persuaded Cæsar to take Lygia to give her to Vinicius, Vinicius
  would bring her to their house. Finally, the thought was no little
  consolation to him, that should Lygia not be rescued she would be avenged and
  protected by death from disgrace. He believed that Vinicius would do
  everything that he had promised. He had seen his rage, and he knew the
  excitability innate in the whole family. He himself, though he loved Lygia as
  her own father, would rather kill her than give her to Cæsar; and had he not
  regarded his son, the last descendant of his stock, he would doubtless have
  done so. Aulus was a soldier; he had hardly heard of the Stoics, but in
  character he was not far from their ideas,&mdash;death was more acceptable to
  his pride than disgrace.</p>

  <p>When he returned home, he pacified Pomponia, gave her the consolation that
  he had, and both began to await news from Vinicius. At moments when the steps
  of some of the slaves were heard in the atrium, they thought that perhaps
  Vinicius was bringing their beloved child to them, and they were ready in the
  depth of their souls to bless both. Time passed, however, and no news came.
  Only in the evening was the hammer heard on the gate.</p>

  <p>After a while a slave entered and handed Aulus a letter. The old general,
  though he liked to show command over himself, took it with a somewhat
  trembling hand, and began to read as hastily as if it were a question of his
  whole house.</p>

  <p>All at once his face darkened, as if a shadow from a passing cloud had
  fallen on it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read,&rdquo; said he, turning to Pomponia.</p>

  <p>Pomponia took the letter and read as follows:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Marcus Vinicius to Aulus Plautius greeting. What has
  happened, has happened by the will of Cæsar, before which incline your heads,
  as I and Petronius incline ours.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>A long silence followed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch06"
     name="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Petronius was at home. The doorkeeper did not dare to stop
  Vinicius, who burst into the atrium like a storm, and, learning that the
  master of the house was in the library, he rushed into the library with the
  same impetus. Finding Petronius writing, he snatched the reed from his hand,
  broke it, trampled the reed on the floor, then fixed his fingers into his
  shoulder, and, approaching his face to that of his uncle, asked, with a
  hoarse voice,&mdash;&ldquo;What hast thou done with her? Where is
  she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly an amazing thing happened. That slender and effeminate Petronius
  seized the hand of the youthful athlete, which was grasping his shoulder,
  then seized the other, and, holding them both in his one hand with the grip
  of an iron vice, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;I am incapable only in the morning; in
  the evening I regain my former strength. Try to escape. A weaver must have
  taught thee gymnastics, and a blacksmith thy manners.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On his face not even anger was evident, but in his eyes there was a
  certain pale reflection of energy and daring. After a while he let the hands
  of Vinicius drop. Vinicius stood before him shamefaced and enraged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast a steel hand,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but if thou hast
  betrayed me, I swear, by all the infernal gods, that I will thrust a knife
  into thy body, though thou be in the chambers of Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us talk calmly,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;Steel is
  stronger, as thou seest, than iron; hence, though out of one of thy arms two
  as large as mine might be made, I have no need to fear thee. On the contrary,
  I grieve over thy rudeness, and if the ingratitude of men could astonish me
  yet, I should be astonished at thy ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a brothel,&mdash;that is, in the house of Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Calm thyself, and be seated. I asked Cæsar for two things, which he
  promised me,&mdash;first, to take Lygia from the house of Aulus, and second
  to give her to thee. Hast thou not a knife there under the folds of thy toga?
  Perhaps thou wilt stab me! But I advise thee to wait a couple of days, for
  thou wouldst be taken to prison, and meanwhile Lygia would be wearied in thy
  house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence followed. Vinicius looked for some time with astonished eyes on
  Petronius; then he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Pardon me; I love her, and love is
  disturbing my faculties.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at me, Marcus. The day before yesterday I spoke to Cæsar as
  follows: &rsquo;My sister&rsquo;s son, Vinicius, has so fallen in love with a
  lean little girl who is being reared with the Auluses that his house is
  turned into a steambath from sighs. Neither thou, O Cæsar, nor I&mdash;we who
  know, each of us, what true beauty is&mdash;would give a thousand sesterces
  for her; but that lad has ever been as dull as a tripod, and now he has lost
  all the wit that was in him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thou understand not that I said this to insure Lygia&rsquo;s
  safety, I am ready to believe that I told the truth. I persuaded Bronzebeard
  that a man of his æsthetic nature could not consider such a girl beautiful;
  and Nero, who so far has not dared to look otherwise than through my eyes,
  will not find in her beauty, and, not finding it, will not desire her. It was
  necessary to insure ourselves against the monkey and take him on a rope. Not
  he, but Poppæa, will value Lygia now; and Poppæa will strive, of course, to
  send the girl out of the palace at the earliest. I said further to
  Bronzebeard, in passing: &rsquo;Take Lygia and give her to Vinicius! Thou
  hast the right to do so, for she is a hostage; and if thou take her, thou
  wilt inflict pain on Aulus.&rsquo; He agreed; he had not the least reason not
  to agree, all the more since I gave him a chance to annoy decent people. They
  will make thee official guardian of the hostage, and give into thy hands that
  Lygian treasure; thou, as a friend of the valiant Lygians, and also a
  faithful servant of Cæsar, wilt not waste any of the treasure, but wilt
  strive to increase it. Cæsar, to preserve appearances, will keep her a few
  days in his house, and then send her to thy insula. Lucky man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this true? Does nothing threaten her there in Cæsar&rsquo;s
  house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she had to live there permanently, Poppæa would talk about her
  to Locusta, but for a few days there is no danger. Ten thousand people live
  in it. Nero will not see her, perhaps, all the more since he left everything
  to me, to the degree that just now the centurion was here with information
  that he had conducted the maiden to the palace and committed her to Acte. She
  is a good soul, that Acte; hence I gave command to deliver Lygia to her.
  Clearly Pomponia Græcina is of that opinion too, for she wrote to Acte.
  To-morrow there is a feast at Nero&rsquo;s. I have requested a place for thee
  at the side of Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Caius, my hastiness. I judged that thou hadst given
  command to take her for thyself or for Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can forgive thy hastiness; but it is more difficult to forgive
  rude gestures, vulgar shouts, and a voice reminding one of players at mora. I
  do not like that style, Marcus, and do thou guard against it. Know that
  Tigellinus is Cæsar&rsquo;s pander; but know also that if I wanted the girl
  for myself now, looking thee straight in the eyes, I would say,
  &rsquo;Vinicius! I take Lygia from thee and I will keep her till I am tired
  of her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he began to look with his hazel eyes straight into the eyes
  of Vinicius with a cold and insolent stare. The young man lost himself
  completely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fault is mine,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Thou art kind and worthy.
  I thank thee from my whole soul. Permit me only to put one more question: Why
  didst thou not have Lygia sent directly to my house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because Cæsar wishes to preserve appearances. People in Rome will
  talk about this,&mdash;that we removed Lygia as a hostage. While they are
  talking, she will remain in Cæsar&rsquo;s palace. Afterward she will be
  removed quietly to thy house, and that will be the end. Bronzebeard is a
  cowardly cur. He knows that his power is unlimited, and still he tries to
  give specious appearances to every act. Hast thou recovered to the degree of
  being able to philosophize a little? More than once have I thought, Why does
  crime, even when as powerful as Cæsar, and assured of being beyond
  punishment, strive always for the appearances of truth, justice, and virtue?
  Why does it take the trouble? I consider that to murder a brother, a mother,
  a wife, is a thing worthy of some petty Asiatic king, not a Roman Cæsar; but
  if that position were mine, I should not write justifying letters to the
  Senate. But Nero writes. Nero is looking for appearances, for Nero is a
  coward. But Tiberius was not a coward; still he justified every step he took.
  Why is this? What a marvellous, involuntary homage paid to virtue by evil!
  And knowest thou what strikes me? This, that it is done because transgression
  is ugly and virtue is beautiful. Therefore a man of genuine æsthetic feeling
  is also a virtuous man. Hence I am virtuous. To-day I must pour out a little
  wine to the shades of Protagoras, Prodicus, and Gorgias. It seems that
  sophists too can be of service. Listen, for I am speaking yet. I took Lygia
  from Aulus to give her to thee. Well. But Lysippus would have made wonderful
  groups of her and thee. Ye are both beautiful; therefore my act is beautiful,
  and being beautiful it cannot be bad. Marcus, here sitting before thee is
  virtue incarnate in Caius Petronius! If Aristides were living, it would be
  his duty to come to me and offer a hundred minæ for a short treatise on
  virtue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius, as a man more concerned with reality than with treatises on
  virtue, replied,&mdash;&ldquo;To-morrow I shall see Lygia, and then have her
  in my house daily, always, and till death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt have Lygia, and I shall have Aulus on my head. He will
  summon the vengeance of all the infernal gods against me. And if the beast
  would take at least a preliminary lesson in good declamation! He will blame
  me, however, as my former doorkeeper blamed my clients but him I sent to
  prison in the country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus has been at my house. I promised to give him news of
  Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Write to him that the will of the &lsquo;divine&rsquo; Cæsar is the
  highest law, and that thy first son will bear the name Aulus. It is necessary
  that the old man should have some consolation. I am ready to pray Bronzebeard
  to invite him to-morrow to the feast. Let him see thee in the triclinium next
  to Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not do that. I am sorry for them, especially for
  Pomponia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he sat down to write that letter which took from the old general the
  remnant of his hope.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch07"
     name="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Once the highest heads in Rome inclined before Acte, the
  former favorite of Nero. But even at that period she showed no desire to
  interfere in public questions, and if on any occasion she used her influence
  over the young ruler, it was only to implore mercy for some one. Quiet and
  unassuming, she won the gratitude of many, and made no one her enemy. Even
  Octavia was unable to hate her. To those who envied her she seemed
  exceedingly harmless. It was known that she continued to love Nero with a sad
  and pained love, which lived not in hope, but only in memories of the time in
  which that Nero was not only younger and loving, but better. It was known
  that she could not tear her thoughts and soul from those memories, but
  expected nothing; since there was no real fear that Nero would return to her,
  she was looked upon as a person wholly inoffensive, and hence was left in
  peace. Poppæa considered her merely as a quiet servant, so harmless that she
  did not even try to drive her from the palace.</p>

  <p>But since Cæsar had loved her once and dropped her without offence in a
  quiet and to some extent friendly manner, a certain respect was retained for
  her. Nero, when he had freed her, let her live in the palace, and gave her
  special apartments with a few servants. And as in their time Pallas and
  Narcissus, though freedmen of Claudius, not only sat at feasts with Claudius,
  but also held places of honor as powerful ministers, so she too was invited
  at times to Cæsar&rsquo;s table. This was done perhaps because her beautiful
  form was a real ornament to a feast. Cæsar for that matter had long since
  ceased to count with any appearances in his choice of company. At his table
  the most varied medley of people of every position and calling found places.
  Among them were senators, but mainly those who were content to be jesters as
  well. There were patricians, old and young, eager for luxury, excess, and
  enjoyment. There were women with great names, who did not hesitate to put on
  a yellow wig of an evening and seek adventures on dark streets for
  amusement&rsquo;s sake. There were also high officials, and priests who at
  full goblets were willing to jeer at their own gods. At the side of these was
  a rabble of every sort: singers, mimes, musicians, dancers of both sexes;
  poets who, while declaiming, were thinking of the sesterces which might fall
  to them for praise of Cæsar&rsquo;s verses; hungry philosophers following the
  dishes with eager eyes; finally, noted charioteers, tricksters,
  miracle-wrights, tale-tellers, jesters, and the most varied adventurers
  brought through fashion or folly to a few days&rsquo; notoriety. Among these
  were not lacking even men who covered with long hair their ears pierced in
  sign of slavery.</p>

  <p>The most noted sat directly at the tables; the lesser served to amuse in
  time of eating, and waited for the moment in which the servants would permit
  them to rush at the remnants of food and drink. Guests of this sort were
  furnished by Tigellinus, Vatinius, and Vitelius; for these guests they were
  forced more than once to find clothing befitting the chambers of Cæsar, who,
  however, liked their society, through feeling most free in it. The luxury of
  the court gilded everything, and covered all things with glitter. High and
  low, the descendants of great families, and the needy from the pavements of
  the city, great artists, and vile scrapings of talent, thronged to the palace
  to sate their dazzled eyes with a splendor almost surpassing human estimate,
  and to approach the giver of every favor, wealth, and property,&mdash;whose
  single glance might abase, it is true, but might also exalt beyond
  measure.</p>

  <p>That day Lygia too had to take part in such a feast. Fear, uncertainty,
  and a dazed feeling, not to be wondered at after the sudden change, were
  struggling in her with a wish to resist. She feared Nero; she feared the
  people and the palace whose uproar deprived her of presence of mind; she
  feared the feasts of whose shamelessness she had heard from Aulus, Pomponia
  Græcina, and their friends. Though young, she was not without knowledge, for
  knowledge of evil in those times reached even children&rsquo;s ears early.
  She knew, therefore, that ruin was threatening her in the palace. Pomponia,
  moreover, had warned her of this at the moment of parting. But having a
  youthful spirit, unacquainted with corruption, and confessing a lofty faith,
  implanted in her by her foster mother, she had promised to defend herself
  against that ruin; she had promised her mother, herself and also that Divine
  Teacher in whom she not only believed, but whom she had come to love with her
  half-childlike heart for the sweetness of his doctrine, the bitterness of his
  death, and the glory of his resurrection.</p>

  <p>She was confident too that now neither Aulus nor Pomponia would be
  answerable for her actions; she was thinking therefore whether it would not
  be better to resist and not go to the feast. On the one hand fear and alarm
  spoke audibly in her soul; on the other the wish rose in her to show courage
  in suffering, in exposure to torture and death. The Divine Teacher had
  commanded to act thus. He had given the example himself. Pomponia had told
  her that the most earnest among the adherents desire with all their souls
  such a test, and pray for it. And Lygia, when still in the house of Aulus,
  had been mastered at moments by a similar desire. She had seen herself as a
  martyr, with wounds on her feet and hands, white as snow, beautiful with a
  beauty not of earth, and borne by equally white angels into the azure sky;
  and her imagination admired such a vision. There was in it much childish
  brooding, but there was in it also something of delight in herself, which
  Pomponia had reprimanded. But now, when opposition to Cæsar&rsquo;s will
  might draw after it some terrible punishment, and the martyrdom scene of
  imagination become a reality, there was added to the beautiful visions and to
  the delight a kind of curiosity mingled with dread, as to how they would
  punish her, and what kind of torments they would provide. And her soul, half
  childish yet, was hesitating on two sides. But Acte, hearing of these
  hesitations, looked at her with astonishment as if the maiden were talking in
  a fever. To oppose Cæsar&rsquo;s will, expose oneself from the first moment
  to his anger? To act thus one would need to be a child that knows not what it
  says. From Lygia&rsquo;s own words it appears that she is, properly speaking,
  not really a hostage, but a maiden forgotten by her own people. No law of
  nations protects her; and even if it did, Cæsar is powerful enough to trample
  on it in a moment of anger. It has pleased Cæsar to take her, and he will
  dispose of her. Thenceforth she is at his will, above which there is not
  another on earth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; continued Acte. &ldquo;I too have read the letters
  of Paul of Tarsus, and I know that above the earth is God, and the Son of
  God, who rose from the dead; but on the earth there is only Cæsar. Think of
  this, Lygia. I know too that thy doctrine does not permit thee to be what I
  was, and that to you as to the Stoics,&mdash;of whom Epictetus has told
  me,&mdash;when it comes to a choice between shame and death, it is permitted
  to choose only death. But canst thou say that death awaits thee and not shame
  too? Hast thou heard of the daughter of Sejanus, a young maiden, who at
  command of Tiberius had to pass through shame before her death, so as to
  respect a law which prohibits the punishment of virgins with death? Lygia,
  Lygia, do not irritate Cæsar. If the decisive moment comes when thou must
  choose between disgrace and death, thou wilt act as thy faith commands; but
  seek not destruction thyself, and do not irritate for a trivial cause an
  earthly and at the same time a cruel divinity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Acte spoke with great compassion, and even with enthusiasm; and being a
  little short-sighted, she pushed her sweet face up to Lygia&rsquo;s as if
  wishing to see surely the effect of her words.</p>

  <p>But Lygia threw her arms around Acte&rsquo;s neck with childish
  trustfulness and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art kind, Acte.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Acte, pleased by the praise and confidence, pressed her to her heart; and
  then disengaging herself from the arms of the maiden,
  answered,&mdash;&ldquo;My happiness has passed and my joy is gone, but I am
  not wicked.&rdquo; Then she began to walk with quick steps through the room
  and to speak to herself, as if in despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! And he was not wicked. He thought himself good at that time,
  and he wished to be good. I know that best. All his change came later, when
  he ceased to love. Others made him what he is&mdash;yes, others&mdash;and
  Poppæa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here her eyelids filled with tears. Lygia followed her for some time with
  her blue eyes, and asked at last,&mdash;&ldquo;Art thou sorry for him,
  Acte?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry for him!&rdquo; answered the Grecian, with a low voice.
  And again she began to walk, her hands clinched as if in pain, and her face
  without hope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou love him yet, Acte?&rdquo; asked Lygia, timidly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And after a while she added,&mdash;&ldquo;No one loves him but
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence followed, during which Acte strove to recover her calmness,
  disturbed by memories; and when at length her face resumed its usual look of
  calm sorrow, she said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us speak of thee, Lygia. Do not even think of opposing Cæsar;
  that would be madness. And be calm. I know this house well, and I judge that
  on Cæsar&rsquo;s part nothing threatens thee. If Nero had given command to
  take thee away for himself, he would not have brought thee to the Palatine.
  Here Poppæa rules; and Nero, since she bore him a daughter, is more than ever
  under her influence. No, Nero gave command, it is true, that thou shouldst be
  at the feast, but he has not seen thee yet; he has not inquired about thee,
  hence he does not care about thee. Maybe he took thee from Aulus and Pomponia
  only through anger at them. Petronius wrote me to have care of thee; and
  since Pomponia too wrote, as thou knowest, maybe they had an understanding.
  Maybe he did that at her request. If this be true, if he at the request of
  Pomponia will occupy himself with thee, nothing threatens thee; and who knows
  if Nero may not send thee back to Aulus at his persuasion? I know not whether
  Nero loves him over much, but I know that rarely has he the courage to be of
  an opinion opposite to his.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Acte!&rdquo; answered Lygia; &ldquo;Petronius was with us
  before they took me, and my mother was convinced that Nero demanded my
  surrender at his instigation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That would be bad,&rdquo; said Acte. But she stopped for a while,
  and then said,&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps Petronius only said, in Nero&rsquo;s
  presence at some supper, that he saw a hostage of the Lygians at
  Aulus&rsquo;s, and Nero, who is jealous of his own power, demanded thee only
  because hostages belong to Cæsar. But he does not like Aulus and Pomponia.
  No! it does not seem to me that if Petronius wished to take thee from Aulus
  he would use such a method. I do not know whether Petronius is better than
  others of Cæsar&rsquo;s court, but he is different. Maybe too thou wilt find
  some one else who would be willing to intercede for thee. Hast thou not seen
  at Aulus&rsquo;s some one who is near Cæsar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seen Vespasian and Titus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar does not like them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Seneca.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If Seneca advised something, that would be enough to make Nero act
  otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bright face of Lygia was covered with a blush. &ldquo;And Vinicius-
  &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a relative of Petronius, and returned not long since from
  Armenia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou think that Nero likes him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All like Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And would he intercede for thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Acte smiled tenderly, and said, &ldquo;Then thou wilt see him surely at
  the feast. Thou must be there, first, because thou must,&mdash;only such a
  child as thou could think otherwise. Second, if thou wish to return to the
  house of Aulus, thou wilt find means of beseeching Petronius and Vinicius to
  gain for thee by their influence the right to return. If they were here, both
  would tell thee as I do, that it would be madness and ruin to try resistance.
  Cæsar might not notice thy absence, it is true; but if he noticed it and
  thought that thou hadst the daring to oppose his will, here would be no
  salvation for thee. Go, Lygia! Dost thou hear the noise in the palace? The
  sun is near setting; guests will begin to arrive soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; answered Lygia, &ldquo;and I will follow thy
  advice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How much desire to see Vinicius and Petronius there was in this resolve,
  how much of woman&rsquo;s curiosity there was to see such a feast once in
  life, and to see at it Cæsar, the court, the renowned Poppæa and other
  beauties, and all that unheard-of splendor, of which wonders were narrated in
  Rome, Lygia could not give account to herself of a certainty. But Acte was
  right, and Lygia felt this distinctly. There was need to go; therefore, when
  necessity and simple reason supported the hidden temptation, she ceased to
  hesitate.</p>

  <p>Acte conducted her to her own unctorium to anoint and dress her; and
  though there was no lack of slave women in Cæsar&rsquo;s house, and Acte had
  enough of them for her personal service, still, through sympathy for the
  maiden whose beauty and innocence had caught her heart, she resolved to dress
  her herself. It became clear at once that in the young Grecian, in spite of
  her sadness and her perusal of the letters of Paul of Tarsus, there was yet
  much of the ancient Hellenic spirit, to which physical beauty spoke with more
  eloquence than aught else on earth. When she had undressed Lygia, she could
  not restrain an exclamation of wonder at sight of her form, at once slender
  and full, created, as it were, from pearl and roses; and stepping back a few
  paces, she looked with delight on that matchless, spring-like form.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia,&rdquo; exclaimed she at last, &ldquo;thou art a hundred
  times more beautiful than Poppæa!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But, reared in the strict house of Pomponia, where modesty was observed,
  even when women were by themselves, the maiden, wonderful as a wonderful
  dream, harmonious as a work of Praxiteles or as a song, stood alarmed,
  blushing from modesty, with knees pressed together, with her hands on her
  bosom, and downcast eyes. At last, raising her arms with sudden movement, she
  removed the pins which held her hair, and in one moment, with one shake of
  her head, she covered herself with it as with a mantle.</p>

  <p>Acte, approaching her and touching her dark tresses, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what hair thou hast! I will not sprinkle golden powder on it;
  it gleams of itself in one place and another with gold, where it waves. I
  will add, perhaps, barely a sprinkle here and there; but lightly, lightly, as
  if a sun ray had freshened it. Wonderful must thy Lygian country be where
  such maidens are born!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not remember it,&rdquo; answered Lygia; &ldquo;but Ursus has
  told me that with us it is forests, forests, and forests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But flowers bloom in those forests,&rdquo; said Acte, dipping her
  hand in a vase filled with verbena, and moistening Lygia&rsquo;s hair with
  it. When she had finished this work, Acte anointed her body lightly with
  odoriferous oils from Arabia, and then dressed her in a soft gold-colored
  tunic without sleeves, over which was to be put a snow-white peplus. But
  since she had to dress Lygia&rsquo;s hair first, she put on her meanwhile a
  kind of roomy dress called synthesis, and, seating her in an armchair, gave
  her for a time into the hands of slave women, so as to stand at a distance
  herself and follow the hairdressing. Two other slave women put on
  Lygia&rsquo;s feet white sandals, embroidered with purple, fastening them to
  her alabaster ankles with golden lacings drawn crosswise. When at last the
  hair-dressing was finished, they put a peplus on her in very beautiful, light
  folds; then Acte fastened pearls to her neck, and touching her hair at the
  folds with gold dust, gave command to the women to dress her, following Lygia
  with delighted eyes meanwhile.</p>

  <p>But she was ready soon; and when the first litters began to appear before
  the main gate, both entered the side portico from which were visible the
  chief entrance, the interior galleries, and the courtyard surrounded by a
  colonnade of Numidian marble.</p>

  <p>Gradually people passed in greater and greater numbers under the lofty
  arch of the entrance, over which the splendid quadrigæ of Lysias seemed to
  bear Apollo and Diana into space. Lygia&rsquo;s eyes were struck by that
  magnificence, of which the modest house of Aulus could not have given her the
  slightest idea. It was sunset; the last rays were falling on the yellow
  Numidian marble of the columns, which shone like gold in those gleams and
  changed into rose color also. Among the columns, at the side of white statues
  of the Danaides and others, representing gods or heroes, crowds of people
  flowed past,&mdash;men and women; resembling statues also, for they were
  draped in togas, pepluses, and robes, falling with grace and beauty toward
  the earth in soft folds, on which the rays of the setting sun were expiring.
  A gigantic Hercules, with head in the light yet, from the breast down sunk in
  shadow cast by the columns, looked from above on that throng. Acte showed
  Lygia senators in wide-bordered togas, in colored tunics, in sandals with
  crescents on them, and knights, and famed artists; she showed her Roman
  ladies, in Roman, in Grecian, in fantastic Oriental costume, with hair
  dressed in towers or pyramids, or dressed like that of the statues of
  goddesses, low on the head, and adorned with flowers. Many men and women did
  Acte call by name, adding to their names histories, brief and sometimes
  terrible, which pierced Lygia with fear, amazement, and wonder. For her this
  was a strange world, whose beauty intoxicated her eyes, but whose contrasts
  her girlish understanding could not grasp. In those twilights of the sky, in
  those rows of motionless columns vanishing in the distance, and in those
  statuesque people, there was a certain lofty repose. It seemed that in the
  midst of those marbles of simple lines demigods might live free of care, at
  peace and in happiness. Meanwhile the low voice of Acte disclosed, time after
  time, a new and dreadful secret of that palace and those people. See, there
  at a distance is the covered portico on whose columns and floor are still
  visible red stains from the blood with which Caligula sprinkled the white
  marble when he fell beneath the knife of Cassius Chærea; there his wife was
  slain; there his child was dashed against a stone; under that wing is the
  dungeon in which the younger Drusus gnawed his hands from hunger; there the
  elder Drusus was poisoned; there Gemellus quivered in terror, and Claudius in
  convulsions; there Germanicus suffered,&mdash;everywhere those walls had
  heard the groans and death-rattle of the dying; and those people hurrying now
  to the feast in togas, in colored tunics, in flowers, and in jewels, may be
  the condemned of to-morrow; on more than one face, perhaps, a smile conceals
  terror, alarm, the uncertainty of the next day; perhaps feverishness, greed,
  envy are gnawing at this moment into the hearts of those crowned demigods,
  who in appearance are free of care. Lygia&rsquo;s frightened thoughts could
  not keep pace with Acte&rsquo;s words; and when that wonderful world
  attracted her eyes with increasing force, her heart contracted within her
  from fear, and in her soul she struggled with an immense, inexpressible
  yearning for the beloved Pomponia Græcina, and the calm house of Aulus, in
  which love, and not crime, was the ruling power.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile new waves of guests were flowing in from the Vicus Apollinis.
  From beyond the gates came the uproar and shouts of clients, escorting their
  patrons. The courtyard and the colonnades were swarming with the multitude of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s slaves, of both sexes, small boys, and pretorian soldiers, who
  kept guard in the palace. Here and there among dark or swarthy visages was
  the black face of a Numidian, in a feathered helmet, and with large gold
  rings in his ears. Some were bearing lutes and citharas, hand lamps of gold,
  silver, and bronze, and bunches of flowers, reared artificially despite the
  late autumn season. Louder and louder the sound of conversation was mingled
  with the splashing of the fountain, the rosy streams of which fell from above
  on the marble and were broken, as if in sobs.</p>

  <p>Acte had stopped her narration; but Lygia gazed at the throng, as if
  searching for some one. All at once her face was covered with a blush, and
  from among the columns came forth Vinicius with Petronius. They went to the
  great triclinium, beautiful, calm, like white gods, in their togas. It seemed
  to Lygia, when she saw those two known and friendly faces among strange
  people, and especially when she saw Vinicius, that a great weight had fallen
  from her heart. She felt less alone. That measureless yearning for Pomponia
  and the house of Aulus, which had broken out in her a little while before,
  ceased at once to be painful. The desire to see Vinicius and to talk with him
  drowned in her other voices. In vain did she remember all the evil which she
  had heard of the house of Cæsar, the words of Acte, the warnings of Pomponia;
  in spite of those words and warnings, she felt all at once that not only must
  she be at that feast, but that she wished to be there. At the thought that
  soon she would hear that dear and pleasant voice, which had spoken of love to
  her and of happiness worthy of the gods, and which was sounding like a song
  in her ears yet, delight seized her straightway.</p>

  <p>But the next moment she feared that delight. It seemed to her that she
  would be false to the pure teaching in which she had been reared, false to
  Pomponia, and false to herself. It is one thing to go by constraint, and
  another to delight in such a necessity. She felt guilty, unworthy, and
  ruined.</p>

    <p class="caption">Nero's Banquet.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Despair swept her away, and she wanted to weep. Had she been alone, she
  would have knelt down and beaten her breast, saying, &ldquo;Mea culpa! mea
  culpa!&rdquo; Acte, taking her hand at that moment, led her through the
  interior apartments to the grand triclinium, where the feast was to be.
  Darkness was in her eyes, and a roaring in her ears from internal emotion;
  the beating of her heart stopped her breath. As in a dream, she saw thousands
  of lamps gleaming on the tables and on the walls; as in a dream, she heard
  the shout with which the guests greeted Cæsar; as through a mist, she saw
  Cæsar himself. The shout deafened her, the glitter dazzled, the odors
  intoxicated; and, losing the remnant of her consciousness, she was barely
  able to recognize Acte, who seated her at the table and took a place at her
  side.</p>

  <p>But after a while a low and known voice was heard at the other
  side,&mdash;&ldquo;A greeting, most beautiful of maidens on earth and of
  stars in heaven. A greeting to thee, divine Callina!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia, having recovered somewhat, looked up; at her side was Vinicius. He
  was without a toga, for convenience and custom had enjoined to cast aside the
  toga at feasts. His body was covered with only a sleeveless scarlet tunic
  embroidered in silver palms. His bare arms were ornamented in Eastern fashion
  with two broad golden bands fastened above the elbow; below they were
  carefully stripped of hair. They were smooth, but too muscular,&mdash;real
  arms of a soldier, they were made for the sword and the shield. On his head
  was a garland of roses. With brows joining above the nose, with splendid eyes
  and a dark complexion, he was the impersonation of youth and strength, as it
  were. To Lygia he seemed so beautiful that though her first amazement had
  passed, she was barely able to answer,&mdash;&ldquo;A greeting,
  Marcus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Happy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are my eyes, which see thee; happy my
  ears, which hear thy voice, dearer to me than the sound of lutes or citharas.
  Were it commanded me to choose who was to rest here by my side at this feast,
  thou, Lygia, or Venus, I would choose thee, divine one!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he looked at the maiden as if he wished to sate himself with the sight
  of her, to burn her eyes with his eyes. His glance slipped from her face to
  her neck and bare arms, fondled her shapely outlines, admired her, embraced
  her, devoured her; but besides desire, there was gleaming in him happiness,
  admiration, and ecstasy beyond limit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew that I should see thee in Cæsar&rsquo;s house,&rdquo;
  continued he; &ldquo;but still, when I saw thee, such delight shook my whole
  soul, as if a happiness entirely unexpected had met me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia, having recovered herself and feeling that in that throng and in
  that house he was the only being who was near to her, began to converse with
  him, and ask about everything which she did not understand and which filled
  her with fear. Whence did he know that he would find her in Cæsar&rsquo;s
  house? Why is she there? Why did Cæsar take her from Pomponia? She is full of
  fear where she is, and wishes to return to Pomponia. She would die from alarm
  and grief were it not for the hope that Petronius and he will intercede for
  her before Cæsar.</p>

  <p>Vinicius explained that he learned from Aulus himself that she had been
  taken. Why she is there, he knows not. Cæsar gives account to no one of his
  orders and commands. But let her not fear. He, Vinicius, is near her and will
  stay near her. He would rather lose his eyes than not see her; he would
  rather lose his life than desert her. She is his soul, and hence he will
  guard her as his soul. In his house he will build to her, as to a divinity,
  an altar on which he will offer myrrh and aloes, and in spring saffron and
  apple-blossoms; and since she has a dread of Cæsar&rsquo;s house, he promises
  that she shall not stay in it.</p>

  <p>And though he spoke evasively and at times invented, truth was to be felt
  in his voice, because his feelings were real. Genuine pity possessed him,
  too, and her words went to his soul so thoroughly that when she began to
  thank him and assure him that Pomponia would love him for his goodness, and
  that she herself would be grateful to him all her life, he could not master
  his emotion, and it seemed to him that he would never be able in life to
  resist her prayer. The heart began to melt in him. Her beauty intoxicated his
  senses, and he desired her; but at the same time he felt that she was very
  dear to him, and that in truth he might do homage to her, as to a divinity;
  he felt also irresistible need of speaking of her beauty and of his own
  homage. As the noise at the feast increased, he drew nearer to her, whispered
  kind, sweet words flowing from the depth of his soul, words as resonant as
  music and intoxicating as wine.</p>

  <p>And he intoxicated her. Amid those strange people he seemed to her ever
  nearer, ever dearer, altogether true, and devoted with his whole soul. He
  pacified her; he promised to rescue her from the house of Cæsar; he promised
  not to desert her, and said that he would serve her. Besides, he had spoken
  before at Aulus&rsquo;s only in general about love and the happiness which it
  can give; but now he said directly that he loved her, and that she was dear
  and most precious to him. Lygia heard such words from a man&rsquo;s lips for
  the first time; and as she heard them it seemed to her that something was
  wakening in her as from a sleep, that some species of happiness was embracing
  her in which immense delight was mingled with immense alarm. Her cheeks began
  to burn, her heart to beat, her mouth opened as in wonder. She was seized
  with fear because she was listening to such things, still she did not wish
  for any cause on earth to lose one word. At moments she dropped her eyes;
  then again she raised her clear glance to Vinicius, timid and also inquiring,
  as if she wished to say to him, &ldquo;Speak on!&rdquo; The sound of the
  music, the odor of flowers and of Arabian perfumes, began to daze her. In
  Rome it was the custom to recline at banquets, but at home Lygia occupied a
  place between Pomponia and little Aulus. Now Vinicius was reclining near her,
  youthful, immense, in love, burning; and she, feeling the heat that issued
  from him, felt both delight and shame. A kind of sweet weakness, a kind of
  faintness and forgetfulness seized her; it was as if drowsiness tortured
  her.</p>

  <p>But her nearness to him began to act on Vinicius also. His nostrils
  dilated, like those of an Eastern steed. The beating of his heart with
  unusual throb was evident under his scarlet tunic; his breathing grew short,
  and the expressions that fell from his lips were broken. For the first time,
  too, he was so near her. His thoughts grew disturbed; he felt a flame in his
  veins which he tried in vain to quench with wine. Not wine, but her
  marvellous face, her bare arms, her maiden breast heaving under the golden
  tunic, and her form hidden in the white folds of the peplus, intoxicated him
  more and more. Finally, he seized her arm above the wrist, as he had done
  once at Aulus&rsquo;s, and drawing her toward him whispered, with trembling
  lips,&mdash;&ldquo;I love thee, Callina,&mdash;divine one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me go, Marcus,&rdquo; said Lygia.</p>

  <p>But he continued, his eyes mist-covered, &ldquo;Love me, my
  goddess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But at that moment was heard the voice of Acte, who was reclining on the
  other side of Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar is looking at you both.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was carried away by sudden anger at Cæsar and at Acte. Her words
  had broken the charm of his intoxication. To the young man even a friendly
  voice would have seemed repulsive at such a moment, but he judged that Acte
  wished purposely to interrupt his conversation with Lygia. So, raising his
  head and looking over the shoulder of Lygia at the young freedwoman, he said
  with malice:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hour has passed, Acte, when thou didst recline near
  Cæsar&rsquo;s side at banquets, and they say that blindness is threatening
  thee; how then canst thou see him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But she answered as if in sadness: &ldquo;Still I see him. He, too, has
  short sight, and is looking at thee through an emerald.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Everything that Nero did roused attention, even in those nearest him;
  hence Vinicius was alarmed. He regained self-control, and began imperceptibly
  to look toward Cæsar. Lygia, who, embarrassed at the beginning of the
  banquet, had seen Nero as in a mist, and afterward, occupied by the presence
  and conversation of Vinicius, had not looked at him at all, turned to him
  eyes at once curious and terrified.</p>

  <p>Acte spoke truly. Cæsar had bent over the table, half-closed one eye, and
  holding before the other a round polished emerald, which he used, was looking
  at them. For a moment his glance met Lygia&rsquo;s eyes, and the heart of the
  maiden was straitened with terror. When still a child on Aulus&rsquo;s
  Sicilian estate, an old Egyptian slave had told her of dragons which occupied
  dens in the mountains, and it seemed to her now that all at once the greenish
  eye of such a monster was gazing at her. She caught at Vinicius&rsquo;s hand
  as a frightened child would, and disconnected, quick impressions pressed into
  her head: Was not that he, the terrible, the all-powerful? She had not seen
  him hitherto, and she thought that he looked differently. She had imagined
  some kind of ghastly face, with malignity petrified in its features; now she
  saw a great head, fixed on a thick neck, terrible, it is true, but almost
  ridiculous, for from a distance it resembled the head of a child. A tunic of
  amethyst color, forbidden to ordinary mortals, cast a bluish tinge on his
  broad and short face. He had dark hair, dressed, in the fashion introduced by
  Otho, in four curls.</p>

  <p>He had no beard, because he had sacrificed it recently to Jove,&mdash;for
  which all Rome gave him thanks, though people whispered to each other that he
  had sacrificed it because his beard, like that of his whole family, was red.
  In his forehead, projecting strongly above his brows, there remained
  something Olympian. In his contracted brows the consciousness of supreme
  power was evident; but under that forehead of a demigod was the face of a
  monkey, a drunkard, and a comedian,&mdash;vain, full of changing desires,
  swollen with fat, notwithstanding his youth; besides, it was sickly and foul.
  To Lygia he seemed ominous, but above all repulsive.</p>

  <p>After a while he laid down the emerald and ceased to look at her. Then she
  saw his prominent blue eyes, blinking before the excess of light, glassy,
  without thought, resembling the eyes of the dead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that the hostage with whom Vinicius is in love?&rdquo; asked he,
  turning to Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is she,&rdquo; answered Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are her people called?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Lygians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does Vinicius think her beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Array a rotten olive trunk in the peplus of a woman, and Vinicius
  will declare it beautiful. But on thy countenance, incomparable judge, I read
  her sentence already. Thou hast no need to pronounce it! The sentence is
  true: she is too dry, thin, a mere blossom on a slender stalk; and thou, O
  divine æsthete, esteemest the stalk in a woman. Thrice and four times art
  thou right! The face alone does not signify. I have learned much in thy
  company, but even now I have not a perfect cast of the eye. But I am ready to
  lay a wager with Tullius Senecio concerning his mistress, that, although at a
  feast, when all are reclining, it is difficult to judge the whole form, thou
  hast said in thy mind already, &rsquo;Too narrow in the
  hips.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too narrow in the hips,&rdquo; answered Nero, blinking.</p>

  <p>On Petronius&rsquo;s lips appeared a scarcely perceptible smile; but
  Tullius Senecio, who till that moment was occupied in conversing with
  Vestinius, or rather in reviling dreams, while Vestinius believed in them,
  turned to Petronius, and though he had not the least idea touching that of
  which they were talking, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art mistaken! I hold with
  Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Petronius. &ldquo;I have just maintained
  that thou hast a glimmer of understanding, but Cæsar insists that thou art an
  ass pure and simple.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Habet!&rdquo; said Cæsar, laughing, and turning down the thumb, as
  was done in the Circus, in sign that the gladiator had received a blow and
  was to be finished.</p>

  <p>But Vestinius, thinking that the question was of dreams,
  exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;But I believe in dreams, and Seneca told me on a time
  that he believes too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Last night I dreamt that I had become a vestal virgin,&rdquo; said
  Calvia Crispinilla, bending over the table.</p>

  <p>At this Nero clapped his hands, other followed, and in a moment clapping
  of hands was heard all around,&mdash;for Crispinilla had been divorced a
  number of times, and was known throughout Rome for her fabulous
  debauchery.</p>

  <p>But she, not disconcerted in the least, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Well! They are
  all old and ugly. Rubria alone has a human semblance, and so there would be
  two of us, though Rubria gets freckles in summer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But admit, purest Calvia,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;that thou
  couldst become a vestal only in dreams.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if Cæsar commanded?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should believe that even the most impossible dreams might come
  true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But they do come true,&rdquo; said Vestinius. &ldquo;I understand
  those who do not believe in the gods, but how is it possible not to believe
  in dreams?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But predictions?&rdquo; inquired Nero. &ldquo;It was predicted once
  to me, that Rome would cease to exist, and that I should rule the whole
  Orient.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Predictions and dreams are connected,&rdquo; said Vestinius.
  &ldquo;Once a certain proconsul, a great disbeliever, sent a slave to the
  temple of Mopsus with a sealed letter which he would not let any one open; he
  did this to try if the god could answer the question contained in the letter.
  The slave slept a night in the temple to have a prophetic dream; he returned
  then and said: &rsquo;I saw a youth in my dreams; he was as bright as the
  sun, and spoke only one word, &ldquo;Black."&rsquo; The proconsul, when he
  heard this, grew pale, and turning to his guests, disbelievers like himself,
  said: &lsquo;Do ye know what was in the letter?&rsquo;&rdquo; Here Vestinius
  stopped, and, raising his goblet with wine, began to drink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was in the letter?&rdquo; asked Senecio.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the letter was the question: &rsquo;What is the color of the
  bull which I am to sacrifice: white or black?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the interest roused by the narrative was interrupted by Vitelius, who,
  drunk when he came to the feast, burst forth on a sudden and without cause in
  senseless laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that keg of tallow laughing at?&rdquo; asked Nero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Laughter distinguishes men from animals,&rdquo; said Petronius,
  &ldquo;and he has no other proof that he is not a wild boar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vitelius stopped half-way in his laughter, and smacking his lips, shining
  from fat and sauces, looked at those present with as much astonishment as if
  he had never seen them before; then he raised his two hands, which were like
  cushions, and said in a hoarse voice,&mdash;&ldquo;The ring of a knight has
  fallen from my finger, and it was inherited from my father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was a tailor,&rdquo; added Nero.</p>

  <p>But Vitelius burst forth again in unexpected laughter, and began to search
  for his ring in the peplus of Calvia Crispinilla.</p>

  <p>Hereupon Vestinius fell to imitating the cries of a frightened woman.
  Nigidia, a friend of Calvia,&mdash;a young widow with the face of a child and
  the eyes of a wanton,&mdash;said aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;He is seeking what he
  has not lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And which will be useless to him if he finds it,&rdquo; finished
  the poet Lucan.</p>

  <p>The feast grew more animated. Crowds of slaves bore around successive
  courses; from great vases filled with snow and garlanded with ivy, smaller
  vessels with various kinds of wine were brought forth unceasingly. All drank
  freely. On the guests, roses fell from the ceiling at intervals.</p>

  <p>Petronius entreated Nero to dignify the feast with his song before the
  guests drank too deeply. A chorus of voices supported his words, but Nero
  refused at first. It was not a question of courage alone, he said, though
  that failed him always. The gods knew what efforts every success cost him. He
  did not avoid them, however, for it was needful to do something for art; and
  besides, if Apollo had gifted him with a certain voice, it was not proper to
  let divine gifts be wasted. He understood, even, that it was his duty to the
  State not to let them be wasted. But that day he was really hoarse. In the
  night he had placed leaden weights on his chest, but that had not helped in
  any way. He was thinking even to go to Antium, to breathe the sea air.</p>

  <p>Lucan implored him in the name of art and humanity. All knew that the
  divine poet and singer had composed a new hymn to Venus, compared with which
  Lucretius&rsquo;s hymn was as the howl of a yearling wolf. Let that feast be
  a genuine feast. So kind a ruler should not cause such tortures to his
  subjects. &ldquo;Be not cruel, O Cæsar!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be not cruel!&rdquo; repeated all who were sitting near.</p>

  <p>Nero spread his hands in sign that he had to yield. All faces assumed then
  an expression of gratitude, and all eyes were turned to him; but he gave
  command first to announce to Poppæa that he would sing; he informed those
  present that she had not come to the feast, because she did not feel in good
  health; but since no medicine gave her such relief as his singing, he would
  be sorry to deprive her of this opportunity.</p>

  <p>In fact, Poppæa came soon. Hitherto she had ruled Nero as if he had been
  her subject, but she knew that when his vanity as a singer, a charioteer, or
  a poet was involved, there was danger in provoking it. She came in therefore,
  beautiful as a divinity, arrayed, like Nero, in robes of amethyst color, and
  wearing a necklace of immense pearls, stolen on a time from Massinissa; she
  was golden-haired, sweet, and though divorced from two husbands she had the
  face and the look of a virgin.</p>

  <p>She was greeted with shouts, and the appellation &ldquo;Divine
  Augusta.&rdquo; Lygia had never seen any one so beautiful, and she could not
  believe her own eyes, for she knew that Poppæa Sabina was one of the vilest
  women on earth. She knew from Pomponia that she had brought Cæsar to murder
  his mother and his wife; she knew her from accounts given by Aulus&rsquo;s
  guests and the servants; she had heard that statues to her had been thrown
  down at night in the city; she had heard of inscriptions, the writers of
  which had been condemned to severest punishment, but which still appeared on
  the city walls every morning. Yet at sight of the notorious Poppæa,
  considered by the confessors of Christ as crime and evil incarnate, it seemed
  to her that angels or spirits of heaven might look like her. She was unable
  simply to take her eyes from Poppæa; and from her lips was wrested
  involuntarily the question,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, Marcus, can it be
  possible?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he, roused by wine, and as it were impatient that so many things had
  scattered her attention, and taken her from him and his words,
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, she is beautiful, but thou art a hundred times more
  beautiful. Thou dost not know thyself, or thou wouldst be in love with
  thyself, as Narcissus was; she bathes in asses&rsquo; milk, but Venus bathed
  thee in her own milk. Thou dost not know thyself, Ocelle mi! Look not at her.
  Turn thy eyes to me, Ocelle mi! Touch this goblet of wine with thy lips, and
  I will put mine on the same place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he pushed up nearer and nearer, and she began to withdraw toward Acte.
  But at that moment silence was enjoined because Cæsar had risen. The singer
  Diodorus had given him a lute of the kind called delta; another singer named
  Terpnos, who had to accompany him in playing, approached with an instrument
  called the nablium. Nero, resting the delta on the table, raised his eyes;
  and for a moment silence reigned in the triclinium, broken only by a rustle,
  as roses fell from the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Then he began to chant, or rather to declaim, singingly and rhythmically,
  to the accompaniment of the two lutes, his own hymn to Venus. Neither the
  voice, though somewhat injured, nor the verses were bad, so that reproaches
  of conscience took possession of Lygia again; for the hymn, though glorifying
  the impure pagan Venus, seemed to her more than beautiful, and Cæsar himself,
  with a laurel crown on his head and uplifted eyes, nobler, much less
  terrible, and less repulsive than at the beginning of the feast.</p>

  <p>The guests answered with a thunder of applause. Cries of, &ldquo;Oh,
  heavenly voice!&rdquo; were heard round about; some of the women raised their
  hands, and held them thus, as a sign of delight, even after the end of the
  hymn; others wiped their tearful eyes; the whole hall was seething as in a
  beehive. Poppæa, bending her golden-haired head, raised Nero&rsquo;s hand to
  her lips, and held it long in silence. Pythagoras, a young Greek of
  marvellous beauty,&mdash;the same to whom later the half-insane Nero
  commanded the flamens to marry him, with the observance of all
  rites,&mdash;knelt now at his feet.</p>

  <p>But Nero looked carefully at Petronius, whose praises were desired by him
  always before every other, and who said,&mdash;&ldquo;If it is a question of
  music, Orpheus must at this moment be as yellow from envy as Lucan, who is
  here present; and as to the verses, I am sorry that they are not worse; if
  they were I might find proper words to praise them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lucan did not take the mention of envy evil of him; on the contrary, he
  looked at Petronius with gratitude, and, affecting ill-humor, began to
  murmur,&mdash;&ldquo;Cursed fate, which commanded me to live contemporary
  with such a poet. One might have a place in the memory of man, and on
  Parnassus; but now one will quench, as a candle in sunlight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius, who had an amazing memory, began to repeat extracts from the
  hymn and cite single verses, exalt, and analyze the more beautiful
  expressions. Lucan, forgetting as it were his envy before the charm of the
  poetry, joined his ecstasy to Petronius&rsquo;s words. On Nero&rsquo;s face
  were reflected delight and fathomless vanity, not only nearing stupidity, but
  reaching it perfectly. He indicated to them verses which he considered the
  most beautiful; and finally he began to comfort Lucan, and tell him not to
  lose heart, for though whatever a man is born that he is, the honor which
  people give Jove does not exclude respect for other divinities.</p>

  <p>Then he rose to conduct Poppæa, who, being really in ill health, wished to
  withdraw. But he commanded the guests who remained to occupy their places
  anew, and promised to return, In fact, he returned a little later, to stupefy
  himself with the smoke of incense, and gaze at further spectacles which he
  himself, Petronius, or Tigellinus had prepared for the feast.</p>

  <p>Again verses were read or dialogues listened to in which extravagance took
  the place of wit. After that Paris, the celebrated mime, represented the
  adventures of Io, the daughter of Inachus. To the guests, and especially to
  Lygia, unaccustomed to such scenes, it seemed that they were gazing at
  miracles and enchantment. Paris, with motions of his hands and body, was able
  to express things apparently impossible in a dance. His hands dimmed the air,
  creating a cloud, bright, living, quivering, voluptuous, surrounding the
  half-fainting form of a maiden shaken by a spasm of delight. That was a
  picture, not a dance; an expressive picture, disclosing the secrets of love,
  bewitching and shameless; and when at the end of it Corybantes rushed in and
  began a bacchic dance with girls of Syria to the sounds of cithara, lutes,
  drums, and cymbals,&mdash;a dance filled with wild shouts and still wilder
  license,&mdash;it seemed to Lygia that living fire was burning her, and that
  a thunderbolt ought to strike that house, or the ceiling fall on the heads of
  those feasting there.</p>

  <p>But from the golden net fastened to the ceiling only roses fell, and the
  now half-drunken Vinicius said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;I saw thee in the house
  of Aulus, at the fountain. It was daylight, and thou didst think that no one
  saw thee; but I saw thee. And I see thee thus yet, though that peplus hides
  thee. Cast aside the peplus, like Crispinilla. See, gods and men seek love.
  There is nothing in the world but love. Lay thy head on my breast and close
  thy eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The pulse beat oppressively in Lygia&rsquo;s hands and temples. A feeling
  seized her that she was flying into some abyss, and that Vinicius, who before
  had seemed so near and so trustworthy, instead of saving was drawing her
  toward it. And she felt sorry for him. She began again to dread the feast and
  him and herself. Some voice, like that of Pomponia, was calling yet in her
  soul, &ldquo;O Lygia, save thyself!&rdquo; But something told her also that
  it was too late; that the one whom such a flame had embraced as that which
  had embraced her, the one who had seen what was done at that feast and whose
  heart had beaten as hers had on hearing the words of Vinicius, the one
  through whom such a shiver had passed as had passed through her when he
  approached, was lost beyond recovery. She grew weak. It seemed at moments to
  her that she would faint, and then something terrible would happen. She knew
  that, under penalty of Cæsar&rsquo;s anger, it was not permitted any one to
  rise till Cæsar rose; but even were that not the case, she had not strength
  now to rise.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile it was far to the end of the feast yet. Slaves brought new
  courses, and filled the goblets unceasingly with wine; before the table, on a
  platform open at one side, appeared two athletes to give the guests a
  spectacle of wrestling.</p>

  <p>They began the struggle at once, and the powerful bodies, shining from
  olive oil, formed one mass; bones cracked in their iron arms, and from their
  set jaws came an ominous gritting of teeth. At moments was heard the quick,
  dull thump of their feet on the platform strewn with saffron; again they were
  motionless, silent, and it seemed to the spectators that they had before them
  a group chiselled out of stone. Roman eyes followed with delight the movement
  of tremendously exerted backs, thighs, and arms. But the struggle was not too
  prolonged; for Croton, a master, and the founder of a school of gladiators,
  did not pass in vain for the strongest man in the empire. His opponent began
  to breathe more and more quickly: next a rattle was heard in his throat; then
  his face grew blue; finally he threw blood from his mouth and fell.</p>

  <p>A thunder of applause greeted the end of the struggle, and Croton, resting
  his foot on the breast of his opponent, crossed his gigantic arms on his
  breast, and cast the eyes of a victor around the hall.</p>

  <p>Next appeared men who mimicked beasts and their voices, ball-players and
  buffoons. Only a few persons looked at them, however, since wine had darkened
  the eyes of the audience. The feast passed by degrees into a drunken revel
  and a dissolute orgy. The Syrian damsels, who appeared at first in the
  bacchic dance, mingled now with the guests. The music changed into a
  disordered and wild outburst of citharas, lutes, Armenian cymbals, Egyptian
  sistra, trumpets, and horns. As some of the guests wished to talk, they
  shouted at the musicians to disappear. The air, filled with the odor of
  flowers and the perfume of oils with which beautiful boys had sprinkled the
  feet of the guests during the feast, permeated with saffron and the
  exhalations of people, became stifling; lamps burned with a dim flame; the
  wreaths dropped sidewise on the heads of guests; faces grew pale and were
  covered with sweat. Vitelius rolled under the table. Nigidia, stripping
  herself to the waist, dropped her drunken childlike head on the breast of
  Lucan, who, drunk in like degree, fell to blowing the golden powder from her
  hair, and raising his eyes with immense delight. Vestinius, with the
  stubbornness of intoxication, repeated for the tenth time the answer of
  Mopsus to the sealed letter of the proconsul. Tullius, who reviled the gods,
  said, with a drawling voice broken by hiccoughs,&mdash;&ldquo;If the spheros
  of Xenophanes is round, then consider, such a god might be pushed along
  before one with the foot, like a barrel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Domitius Afer, a hardened criminal and informer, was indignant at the
  discourse, and through indignation spilled Falernian over his whole tunic. He
  had always believed in the gods. People say that Rome will perish, and there
  are some even who contend that it is perishing already. And surely! But if
  that should come, it is because the youth are without faith, and without
  faith there can be no virtue. People have abandoned also the strict habits of
  former days, and it never occurs to them that Epicureans will not stand
  against barbarians. As for him, he&mdash;As for him, he was sorry that he had
  lived to such times, and that he must seek in pleasures a refuge against
  griefs which, if not met, would soon kill him.</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he drew toward him a Syrian dancer, and kissed her
  neck and shoulders with his toothless mouth. Seeing this, the consul Memmius
  Regulus laughed, and, raising his bald head with wreath awry,
  exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;Who says that Rome is perishing? What folly! I, a
  consul, know better. Videant consules! Thirty legions are guarding our pax
  romana!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he put his fists to his temples and shouted, in a voice heard
  throughout the triclinium,&mdash;&ldquo;Thirty legions! thirty legions! from
  Britain to the Parthian boundaries!&rdquo; But he stopped on a sudden, and,
  putting a finger to his forehead, said,&mdash;&ldquo;As I live, I think there
  are thirty-two.&rdquo; He rolled under the table, and began soon to send
  forth flamingo tongues, roast and chilled mushrooms, locusts in honey, fish,
  meat, and everything which he had eaten or drunk.</p>

  <p>But the number of the legions guarding Roman peace did not pacify
  Domitius.</p>

  <p>No, no! Rome must perish; for faith in the gods was lost, and so were
  strict habits! Rome must perish; and it was a pity, for still life was
  pleasant there. Cæsar was gracious, wine was good! Oh, what a pity!</p>

  <p>And hiding his head on the arm of a Syrian bacchanal, he burst into tears.
  &ldquo;What is a future life! Achilles was right,&mdash;better be a slave in
  the world beneath the sun than a king in Cimmerian regions. And still the
  question whether there are any gods&mdash;since it is unbelief&mdash;is
  destroying the youth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lucan meanwhile had blown all the gold powder from Nigidia&rsquo;s hair,
  and she being drunk had fallen asleep. Next he took wreaths of ivy from the
  vase before him, put them on the sleeping woman, and when he had finished
  looked at those present with a delighted and inquiring glance. He arrayed
  himself in ivy too, repeating, in a voice of deep conviction, &ldquo;I am not
  a man at all, but a faun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius was not drunk; but Nero, who drank little at first, out of
  regard for his &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; voice, emptied goblet after goblet
  toward the end, and was drunk. He wanted even to sing more of his
  verses,&mdash;this time in Greek,&mdash;but he had forgotten them, and by
  mistake sang an ode of Anacreon. Pythagoras, Diodorus, and Terpnos
  accompanied him; but failing to keep time, they stopped. Nero as a judge and
  an æsthete was enchanted with the beauty of Pythagoras, and fell to kissing
  his hands in ecstasy. &ldquo;Such beautiful hands I have seen only once, and
  whose were they?&rdquo; Then placing his palm on his moist forehead, he tried
  to remember. After a while terror was reflected on his face.</p>

  <p>Ah! His mother&rsquo;s&mdash;Agrippina&rsquo;s!</p>

  <p>And a gloomy vision seized him forthwith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that she wanders by moonlight on
  the sea around Baiæ and Bauli. She merely walks,&mdash;walks as if seeking
  for something. When she comes near a boat, she looks at it and goes away; but
  the fisherman on whom she has fixed her eye dies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bad theme,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>But Vestinius, stretching his neck like a stork, whispered
  mysteriously,&mdash;&ldquo;I do not believe in the gods; but I believe in
  spirits&mdash;Oi!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero paid no attention to their words, and continued,&mdash;&ldquo;I
  celebrated the Lemuria, and have no wish to see her. This is the fifth
  year&mdash;I had to condemn her, for she sent assassins against me; and, had
  I not been quicker than she, ye would not be listening to-night to my
  song.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks be to Cæsar, in the name of the city and the world!&rdquo;
  cried Domitius Afer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wine! and let them strike the tympans!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The uproar began anew. Lucan, all in ivy, wishing to outshout him, rose
  and cried,&mdash;&ldquo;I am not a man, but a faun; and I dwell in the
  forest. Eho-o-o-oo!&rdquo; Cæsar drank himself drunk at last; men were drunk,
  and women were drunk. Vinicius was not less drunk than others; and in
  addition there was roused in him, besides desire, a wish to quarrel, which
  happened always when he passed the measure. His dark face became paler, and
  his tongue stuttered when he spoke, in a voice now loud and
  commanding,&mdash;&ldquo;Give me thy lips! To-day, to-morrow, it is all one!
  Enough of this!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar took thee from Aulus to give thee to me, dost understand?
  To-morrow, about dusk, I will send for thee, dost understand? Cæsar promised
  thee to me before he took thee. Thou must be mine! Give me thy lips! I will
  not wait for to-morrow,&mdash;give thy lips quickly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he moved to embrace her; but Acte began to defend her, and she
  defended herself with the remnant of her strength, for she felt that she was
  perishing. But in vain did she struggle with both hands to remove his
  hairless arm; in vain, with a voice in which terror and grief were quivering,
  did she implore him not to be what he was, and to have pity on her. Sated
  with wine, his breath blew around her nearer and nearer, and his face was
  there near her face. He was no longer the former kind Vinicius, almost dear
  to her soul; he was a drunken, wicked satyr, who filled her with repulsion
  and terror. But her strength deserted her more and more. In vain did she bend
  and turn away her face to escape his kisses. He rose to his feet, caught her
  in both arms, and drawing her head to his breast, began, panting, to press
  her pale lips with his.</p>

  <p>But at this instant a tremendous power removed his arms from her neck with
  as much ease as if they had been the arms of a child, and pushed him aside,
  like a dried limb or a withered leaf. What had happened? Vinicius rubbed his
  astonished eyes, and saw before him the gigantic figure of the Lygian, called
  Ursus, whom he had seen at the house of Aulus.</p>

  <p>Ursus stood calmly, but looked at Vinicius so strangely with his blue eyes
  that the blood stiffened in the veins of the young man; then the giant took
  his queen on his arm, and walked out of the triclinium with an even, quiet
  step.</p>

  <p>Acte in that moment went after him.</p>

  <p>Vinicius sat for the twinkle of an eye as if petrified; then he sprang up
  and ran toward the entrance crying,&mdash;&ldquo;Lygia! Lygia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But desire, astonishment, rage, and wine cut the legs from under him. He
  staggered once and a second time, seized the naked arm of one of the
  bacchanals, and began to inquire, with blinking eyes, what had happened. She,
  taking a goblet of wine, gave it to him with a smile in her mist-covered
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; said she.</p>

  <p>Vinicius drank, and fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>The greater number of the guests were lying under the table; others were
  walking with tottering tread through the triclinium, while others were
  sleeping on couches at the table, snoring, or giving forth the excess of
  wine. Meanwhile, from the golden network, roses were dropping and dropping on
  those drunken consuls and senators, on those drunken knights, philosophers,
  and poets, on those drunken dancing damsels and patrician ladies, on that
  society all dominant as yet but with the soul gone from it, on that society
  garlanded and ungirdled but perishing.</p>

  <p>Dawn had begun out of doors.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch08"
     name="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No one stopped Ursus, no one inquired even what he was
  doing. Those guests who were not under the table had not kept their own
  places; hence the servants, seeing a giant carrying a guest on his arm,
  thought him some slave bearing out his intoxicated mistress. Moreover, Acte
  was with them, and her presence removed all suspicion.</p>

  <p>In this way they went from the triclinium to the adjoining chamber, and
  thence to the gallery leading to Acte&rsquo;s apartments. To such a degree
  had her strength deserted Lygia, that she hung as if dead on the arm of
  Ursus. But when the cool, pure breeze of morning beat around her, she opened
  her eyes. It was growing clearer and clearer in the open air. After they had
  passed along the colonnade awhile, they turned to a side portico, coming out,
  not in the courtyard, but the palace gardens, where the tops of the pines and
  cypresses were growing ruddy from the light of morning. That part of the
  building was empty, so that echoes of music and sounds of the feast came with
  decreasing distinctness. It seemed to Lygia that she had been rescued from
  hell, and borne into God&rsquo;s bright world outside. There was something,
  then, besides that disgusting triclinium. There was the sky, the dawn, light,
  and peace. Sudden weeping seized the maiden, and, taking shelter on the arm
  of the giant, she repeated, with sobbing,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us go home, Ursus!
  home, to the house of Aulus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go!&rdquo; answered Ursus.</p>

  <p>They found themselves now in the small atrium of Acte&rsquo;s apartments.
  Ursus placed Lygia on a marble bench at a distance from the fountain. Acte
  strove to pacify her; she urged her to sleep, and declared that for the
  moment there was no danger,&mdash;after the feast the drunken guests would
  sleep till evening. For a long time Lygia could not calm herself, and,
  pressing her temples with both hands, she repeated like a
  child,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us go home, to the house of Aulus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus was ready. At the gates stood pretorians, it is true, but he would
  pass them. The soldiers would not stop out-going people. The space before the
  arch was crowded with litters. Guests were beginning to go forth in throngs.
  No one would detain them. They would pass with the crowd and go home
  directly. For that matter, what does he care? As the queen commands, so must
  it be. He is there to carry out her orders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Ursus,&rdquo; said Lygia, &ldquo;let us go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Acte was forced to find reason for both. They would pass out, true; no one
  would stop them. But it is not permitted to flee from the house of Cæsar;
  whoso does that offends Cæsar&rsquo;s majesty. They may go; but in the
  evening a centurion at the head of soldiers will take a death sentence to
  Aulus and Pomponia Græcina; they will bring Lygia to the palace again, and
  then there will be no rescue for her. Should Aulus and his wife receive her
  under their roof, death awaits them to a certainty.</p>

  <p>Lygia&rsquo;s arms dropped. There was no other outcome. She must choose
  her own ruin or that of Plautius. In going to the feast, she had hoped that
  Vinicius and Petronius would win her from Cæsar, and return her to Pomponia;
  now she knew that it was they who had brought Cæsar to remove her from the
  house of Aulus. There was no help. Only a miracle could save her from the
  abyss,&mdash;a miracle and the might of God.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Acte,&rdquo; said she, in despair, &ldquo;didst thou hear Vinicius
  say that Cæsar had given me to him, and that he will send slaves here this
  evening to take me to his house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered Acte; and, raising her arms from her side,
  she was silent. The despair with which Lygia spoke found in her no echo. She
  herself had been Nero&rsquo;s favorite. Her heart, though good, could not
  feel clearly the shame of such a relation. A former slave, she had grown too
  much inured to the law of slavery; and, besides, she loved Nero yet. If he
  returned to her, she would stretch her arms to him, as to happiness.
  Comprehending clearly that Lygia must become the mistress of the youthful and
  stately Vinicius, or expose Aulus and Pomponia to ruin, she failed to
  understand how the girl could hesitate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Cæsar&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said she, after a while, &ldquo;it
  would not be safer for thee than in that of Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And it did not occur to her that, though she told the truth, her words
  meant, &ldquo;Be resigned to fate and become the concubine of
  Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As to Lygia, who felt on her lips yet his kisses, burning as coals and
  full of beastly desire, the blood rushed to her face with shame at the mere
  thought of them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; cried she, with an outburst, &ldquo;will I remain
  here, or at the house of Vinicius,&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; inquired Acte, &ldquo;is Vinicius hateful to
  thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia was unable to answer, for weeping seized her anew. Acte gathered the
  maiden to her bosom, and strove to calm her excitement. Ursus breathed
  heavily, and balled his giant fists; for, loving his queen with the devotion
  of a dog, he could not bear the sight of her tears. In his half-wild Lygian
  heart was the wish to return to the triclinium, choke Vinicius, and, should
  the need come, Cæsar himself; but he feared to sacrifice thereby his
  mistress, and was not certain that such an act, which to him seemed very
  simple, would befit a confessor of the Crucified Lamb.</p>

  <p>But Acte, while caressing Lygia, asked again, &ldquo;Is he so hateful to
  thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lygia; &ldquo;it is not permitted me to hate, for I
  am a Christian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, Lygia. I know also from the letters of Paul of Tarsus, that
  it is not permitted to defile one&rsquo;s self, nor to fear death more than
  sin; but tell me if thy teaching permits one person to cause the death of
  others?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then how canst thou bring Cæsar&rsquo;s vengeance on the house of
  Aulus?&rdquo; A moment of silence followed. A bottomless abyss yawned before
  Lygia again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ask,&rdquo; continued the young freedwoman, &ldquo;for I have
  compassion on thee&mdash;and I have compassion on the good Pomponia and
  Aulus, and on their child. It is long since I began to live in this house,
  and I know what Cæsar&rsquo;s anger is. No! thou art not at liberty to flee
  from here. One way remains to thee: implore Vinicius to return thee to
  Pomponia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Lygia dropped on her knees to implore some one else. Ursus knelt down
  after a while, too, and both began to pray in Cæsar&rsquo;s house at the
  morning dawn.</p>

  <p>Acte witnessed such a prayer for the first time, and could not take her
  eyes from Lygia, who, seen by her in profile, with raised hands, and face
  turned heavenward, seemed to implore rescue. The dawn, casting light on her
  dark hair and white peplus, was reflected in her eyes. Entirely in the light,
  she seemed herself like light. In that pale face, in those parted lips, in
  those raised hands and eyes, a kind of superhuman exaltation was evident.
  Acte understood then why Lygia could not become the concubine of any man.
  Before the face of Nero&rsquo;s former favorite was drawn aside, as it were,
  a corner of that veil which hides a world altogether different from that to
  which she was accustomed. She was astonished by prayer in that abode of crime
  and infamy. A moment earlier it had seemed to her that there was no rescue
  for Lygia; now she began to think that something uncommon would happen, that
  some aid would come,&mdash;aid so mighty that Cæsar himself would be
  powerless to resist it; that some winged army would descend from the sky to
  help that maiden, or that the sun would spread its rays beneath her feet and
  draw her up to itself. She had heard of many miracles among Christians, and
  she thought now that everything said of them was true, since Lygia was
  praying.</p>

  <p>Lygia rose at last, with a face serene with hope. Ursus rose too, and,
  holding to the bench, looked at his mistress, waiting for her words.</p>

  <p>But it grew dark in her eyes, and after a time two great tears rolled down
  her checks slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May God bless Pomponia and Aulus,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is not
  permitted me to bring ruin on them; therefore I shall never see them
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then turning to Ursus she said that he alone remained to her in the world;
  that he must be to her as a protector and a father. They could not seek
  refuge in the house of Aulus, for they would bring on it the anger of Cæsar.
  But neither could she remain in the house of Cæsar or that of Vinicius. Let
  Ursus take her then; let him conduct her out of the city; let him conceal her
  in some place where neither Vinicius nor his servants could find her. She
  would follow Ursus anywhere, even beyond the sea, even beyond the mountains,
  to the barbarians, where the Roman name was not heard, and whither the power
  of Cæsar did not reach. Let him take her and save her, for he alone had
  remained to her.</p>

  <p>The Lygian was ready, and in sign of obedience he bent to her feet and
  embraced them. But on the face of Acte, who had been expecting a miracle,
  disappointment was evident. Had the prayer effected only that much? To flee
  from the house of Cæsar is to commit an offence against majesty which must be
  avenged; and even if Lygia succeeded in hiding, Cæsar would avenge himself on
  Aulus and Pomponia. If she wishes to escape, let her escape from the house of
  Vinicius. Then Cæsar, who does not like to occupy himself with the affairs of
  others, may not wish even to aid Vinicius in the pursuit; in every case it
  will not be a crime against majesty.</p>

  <p>But Lygia&rsquo;s thoughts were just the following: Aulus would not even
  know where she was; Pomponia herself would not know. She would escape not
  from the house of Vinicius, however, but while on the way to it. When drunk,
  Vinicius had said that he would send his slaves for her in the evening.
  Beyond doubt he had told the truth, which he would not have done had he been
  sober. Evidently he himself, or perhaps he and Petronius, had seen Cæsar
  before the feast, and won from him the promise to give her on the following
  evening. And if they forgot that day, they would send for her on the morrow.
  But Ursus will save her. He will come; he will bear her out of the litter as
  he bore her out of the triclinium, and they will go into the world. No one
  could resist Ursus, not even that terrible athlete who wrestled at the feast
  yesterday. But as Vinicius might send a great number of slaves, Ursus would
  go at once to Bishop Linus for aid and counsel. The bishop will take
  compassion on her, will not leave her in the hands of Vinicius; he will
  command Christians to go with Ursus to rescue her. They will seize her and
  bear her away; then Ursus can take her out of the city and hide her from the
  power of Rome.</p>

  <p>And her face began to flush and smile. Consolation entered her anew, as if
  the hope of rescue had turned to reality. She threw herself on Acte&rsquo;s
  neck suddenly, and, putting her beautiful lips to Acte&rsquo;s cheek, she
  whispered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt not betray, Acte, wilt thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the shade of my mother,&rdquo; answered the freedwoman, &ldquo;I
  will not; but pray to thy God that Ursus be able to bear thee
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The blue, childlike eyes of the giant were gleaming with happiness. He had
  not been able to frame any plan, though he had been breaking his poor head;
  but a thing like this he could do,&mdash;and whether in the day or in the
  night it was all one to him! He would go to the bishop, for the bishop can
  read in the sky what is needed and what is not. Besides, he could assemble
  Christians himself. Are his acquaintances few among slaves, gladiators, and
  free people, both in the Subura and beyond the bridges? He can collect a
  couple of thousand of them. He will rescue his lady, and take her outside the
  city, and he can go with her. They will go to the end of the world, even to
  that place from which they had come, where no one has heard of Rome.</p>

  <p>Here he began to look forward, as if to see things in the future and very
  distant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the forest? Ai, what a forest, what a forest!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But after a while he shook himself out of his visions. Well, he will go to
  the bishop at once, and in the evening will wait with something like a
  hundred men for the litter. And let not slaves, but even pretorians, take her
  from him! Better for any man not to come under his fist, even though in iron
  armor,&mdash;for is iron so strong? When he strikes iron earnestly, the head
  underneath will not survive.</p>

  <p>But Lygia raised her finger with great and also childlike seriousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ursus, do not kill,&rdquo; said she.</p>

  <p>Ursus put his fist, which was like a maul, to the back of his head, and,
  rubbing his neck with great seriousness, began to mutter. But he must rescue
  &ldquo;his light.&rdquo; She herself had said that his turn had come. He will
  try all he can. But if something happens in spite of him? In every case he
  must save her. But should anything happen, he will repent, and so entreat the
  Innocent Lamb that the Crucified Lamb will have mercy on him, poor fellow. He
  has no wish to offend the Lamb; but then his hands are so heavy.</p>

  <p>Great tenderness was expressed on his face; but wishing to hide it, he
  bowed and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Now I will go to the holy bishop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Acte put her arms around Lygia&rsquo;s neck, and began to weep. Once more
  the freedwoman understood that there was a world in which greater happiness
  existed, even in suffering, than in all the excesses and luxury of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s house. Once more a kind of door to the light was opened a
  little before her, but she felt at once that she was unworthy to pass through
  it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch09"
     name="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lygia was grieved to lose Pomponia Græcina, whom she loved
  with her whole soul, and she grieved for the household of Aulus; still her
  despair passed away. She felt a certain delight even in the thought that she
  was sacrificing plenty and comfort for her Truth, and was entering on an
  unknown and wandering existence. Perhaps there was in this a little also of
  childish curiosity as to what that life would be, off somewhere in remote
  regions, among wild beasts and barbarians. But there was still more a deep
  and trusting faith, that by acting thus she was doing as the Divine Master
  had commanded, and that henceforth He Himself would watch over her, as over
  an obedient and faithful child. In such a case what harm could meet her? If
  sufferings come, she will endure them in His name. If sudden death comes, He
  will take her; and some time, when Pomponia dies, they will be together for
  all eternity. More than once when she was in the house of Aulus, she tortured
  her childish head because she, a Christian, could do nothing for that
  Crucified, of whom Ursus spoke with such tenderness. But now the moment had
  come. Lygia felt almost happy, and began to speak of her happiness to Acte,
  who could not understand her, however. To leave everything,&mdash;to leave
  house, wealth, the city, gardens, temples, porticos, everything that is
  beautiful; leave a sunny land and people near to one&mdash;and for what
  purpose? To hide from the love of a young and stately knight. In Acte&rsquo;s
  head these things could not find place. At times she felt that Lygia&rsquo;s
  action was right, that there must be some immense mysterious happiness in it;
  but she could not give a clear account to herself of the matter, especially
  since an adventure was before Lygia which might have an evil ending,&mdash;an
  adventure in which she might lose her life simply. Acte was timid by nature,
  and she thought with dread of what the coming evening might bring. But she
  was loath to mention her fears to Lygia; meanwhile, as the day was clear and
  the sun looked into the atrium, she began to persuade her to take the rest
  needed after a night without sleep. Lygia did not refuse; and both went to
  the cubiculum, which was spacious and furnished with luxury because of
  Acte&rsquo;s former relations with Cæsar. There they lay down side by side,
  but in spite of her weariness Acte could not sleep. For a long time she had
  been sad and unhappy, but now she was seized by a certain uneasiness which
  she had never felt before. So far life had seemed to her simply grievous and
  deprived of a morrow; now all at once it seemed to her dishonorable.</p>

  <p>Increasing chaos rose in her head. Again the door to light began to open
  and close. But in the moment when it opened, that light so dazzled her that
  she could see nothing distinctly. She divined, merely, that in that light
  there was happiness of some kind, happiness beyond measure, in presence of
  which every other was nothing, to such a degree that if Cæsar, for example,
  were to set aside Poppæa, and love her, Acte, again, it would be vanity.
  Suddenly the thought came to her that that Cæsar whom she loved, whom she
  held involuntarily as a kind of demigod, was as pitiful as any slave, and
  that palace, with columns of Numidian marble, no better than a heap of
  stones. At last, however, those feelings which she had not power to define
  began to torment her; she wanted to sleep, but being tortured by alarm she
  could not. Thinking that Lygia, threatened by so many perils and
  uncertainties, was not sleeping either, she turned to her to speak of her
  flight in the evening. But Lygia was sleeping calmly. Into the dark
  cubiculum, past the curtain which was not closely drawn, came a few bright
  rays, in which golden dust-motes were playing. By the light of these rays
  Acte saw her delicate face, resting on her bare arm, her closed eyes, and her
  mouth slightly open. She was breathing regularly, but as people breathe while
  asleep.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She sleeps,&mdash;she is able to sleep,&rdquo; thought Acte.
  &ldquo;She is a child yet.&rdquo; Still, after a while it came to her mind
  that that child chose to flee rather than remain the beloved of Vinicius; she
  preferred want to shame, wandering to a lordly house, to robes, jewels, and
  feasts, to the sound of lutes and citharas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And she gazed at Lygia, as if to find an answer in her sleeping face. She
  looked at her clear forehead, at the calm arch of her brows, at her dark
  tresses, at her parted lips, at her virgin bosom moved by calm breathing;
  then she thought again,&mdash;&ldquo;How different from me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia seemed to her a miracle, a sort of divine vision, something beloved
  of the gods, a hundred times more beautiful than all the flowers in
  Cæsar&rsquo;s garden, than all the statues in his palace. But in the Greek
  woman&rsquo;s heart there was no envy. On the contrary, at thought of the
  dangers which threatened the girl, great pity seized her. A certain motherly
  feeling rose in the woman. Lygia seemed to her not only as beautiful as a
  beautiful vision, but also very dear, and, putting her lips to her dark hair,
  she kissed it.</p>

  <p>But Lygia slept on calmly, as if at home, under the care of Pomponia
  Græcina. And she slept rather long. Midday had passed when she opened her
  blue eyes and looked around the cubiculum in astonishment. Evidently she
  wondered that she was not in the house of Aulus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is thou, Acte?&rdquo; said she at last, seeing in the darkness
  the face of the Greek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I, Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it evening?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, child; but midday has passed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And has Ursus not returned?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ursus did not say that he would return; he said that he would watch
  in the evening, with Christians, for the litter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then they left the cubiculum and went to the bath, where Acte bathed
  Lygia; then she took her to breakfast and afterward to the gardens of the
  palace, in which no dangerous meeting might be feared, since Cæsar and his
  principal courtiers were sleeping yet. For the first time in her life Lygia
  saw those magnificent gardens, full of pines, cypresses, oaks, olives, and
  myrtles, among which appeared white here and there a whole population of
  statues. The mirror of ponds gleamed quietly; groves of roses were blooming,
  watered with the spray of fountains; entrances to charming grottos were
  encircled with a growth of ivy or woodbine; silver-colored swans were sailing
  on the water; amidst statues and trees wandered tame gazelles from the
  deserts of Africa, and rich-colored birds from all known countries on
  earth.</p>

  <p>The gardens were empty; but here and there slaves were working, spade in
  hand, singing in an undertone; others, to whom was granted a moment of rest,
  were sitting by ponds or in the shade of groves, in trembling light produced
  by sun-rays breaking in between leaves; others were watering roses or the
  pale lily-colored blossoms of the saffron. Acte and Lygia walked rather long,
  looking at all the wonders of the gardens; and though Lygia&rsquo;s mind was
  not at rest, she was too much a child yet to resist pleasure, curiosity, and
  wonder. It occurred to her, even, that if Cæsar were good, he might be very
  happy in such a palace, in such gardens.</p>

  <p>But at last, tired somewhat, the two women sat down on a bench hidden
  almost entirely by dense cypresses and began to talk of that which weighed on
  their hearts most,&mdash;that is, of Lygia&rsquo;s escape in the evening.
  Acte was far less at rest than Lygia touching its success. At times it seemed
  to her even a mad project, which could not succeed. She felt a growing pity
  for Lygia. It seemed to her that it would be a hundred times safer to try to
  act on Vinicius. After a while she inquired of Lygia how long she had known
  him, and whether she did not think that he would let himself be persuaded to
  return her to Pomponia.</p>

  <p>But Lygia shook her dark head in sadness. &ldquo;No. In Aulus&rsquo;s
  house, Vinicius had been different, he had been very kind, but since
  yesterday&rsquo;s feast she feared him, and would rather flee to the
  Lygians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But in Aulus&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; inquired Acte, &ldquo;he was
  dear to thee, was he not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; answered Lygia, inclining her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou wert not a slave, as I was,&rdquo; said Acte, after a
  moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Vinicius might marry thee. Thou art a hostage,
  and a daughter of the Lygian king. Aulus and Pomponia love thee as their own
  child; I am sure that they are ready to adopt thee. Vinicius might marry
  thee, Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Lygia answered calmly, and with still greater sadness, &ldquo;I would
  rather flee to the Lygians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia, dost thou wish me to go directly to Vinicius, rouse him, if
  he is sleeping, and tell him what I have told thee? Yes, my precious one, I
  will go to him and say, &rsquo;Vinicius, this is a king&rsquo;s daughter, and
  a dear child of the famous Aulus; if thou love her, return her to Aulus and
  Pomponia, and take her as wife from their house.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the maiden answered with a voice so low that Acte could barely hear
  it,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would rather flee to the Lygians.&rdquo; And two tears were
  hanging on her drooping lids.</p>

  <p>Further conversation was stopped by the rustle of approaching steps, and
  before Acte had time to see who was coming, Poppæa Sabina appeared in front
  of the bench with a small retinue of slave women. Two of them held over her
  head bunches of ostrich feathers fixed to golden wires; with these they
  fanned her lightly, and at the same time protected her from the autumn sun,
  which was hot yet. Before her a woman from Egypt, black as ebony, and with
  bosom swollen as if from milk, bore in her arms an infant wrapped in purple
  fringed with gold. Acte and Lygia rose, thinking that Poppæa would pass the
  bench without turning attention to either; but she halted before them and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Acte, the bells sent by thee for the doll were badly
  fastened; the child tore off one and put it to her mouth; luckily Lilith saw
  it in season.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon, divinity,&rdquo; answered Acte, crossing her arms on her
  breast and bending her head.</p>

  <p>But Poppæa began to gaze at Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What slave is this?&rdquo; asked she, after a pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is not a slave, divine Augusta, but a foster child of Pomponia
  Græcina, and a daughter of the Lygian king given by him as hostage to
  Rome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And has she come to visit thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Augusta. She is dwelling in the palace since the day before
  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was she at the feast last night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She was, Augusta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At whose command?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At Cæsar&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Poppæa looked still more attentively at Lygia, who stood with bowed head,
  now raising her bright eyes to her with curiosity, now covering them with
  their lids. Suddenly a frown appeared between the brows of the Augusta.
  Jealous of her own beauty and power, she lived in continual alarm lest at
  some time a fortunate rival might ruin her, as she had ruined Octavia. Hence
  every beautiful face in the palace roused her suspicion. With the eye of a
  critic she took in at once every part of Lygia&rsquo;s form, estimated every
  detail of her face, and was frightened. &ldquo;That is simply a nymph,&rdquo;
  thought she, &ldquo;and &rsquo;twas Venus who gave birth to her.&rdquo; On a
  sudden this came to her mind which had never come before at sight of any
  beauty,&mdash;that she herself had grown notably older! Wounded vanity
  quivered in Poppæa, alarm seized her, and various fears shot through her
  head. &ldquo;Perhaps Nero has not seen the girl, or, seeing her through the
  emerald, has not appreciated her. But what would happen should he meet such a
  marvel in the daytime, in sunlight? Moreover she is not a slave, she is the
  daughter of a king,&mdash;a king of barbarians, it is true, but a king.
  Immortal gods! she is as beautiful as I am, but younger!&rdquo; The wrinkle
  between her brows increased, and her eyes began to shine under their golden
  lashes with a cold gleam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou spoken with Cæsar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Augusta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou choose to be here rather than in the house of
  Aulus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not choose, lady. Petronius persuaded Cæsar to take me from
  Pomponia. I am here against my will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And wouldst thou return to Pomponia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This last question Poppæa gave with a softer and milder voice; hence a
  sudden hope rose in Lygia&rsquo;s heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said she, extending her hand to her, &ldquo;Cæsar
  promised to give me as a slave to Vinicius, but do thou intercede and return
  me to Pomponia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then Petronius persuaded Cæsar to take thee from Aulus, and give
  thee to Vinicius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, lady. Vinicius is to send for me to-day, but thou art good,
  have compassion on me.&rdquo; When she had said this, she inclined, and,
  seizing the border of Poppæa&rsquo;s robe, waited for her word with beating
  heart. Poppæa looked at her for a while, with a face lighted by an evil
  smile, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Then I promise that thou wilt become the slave
  of Vinicius this day.&rdquo; And she went on, beautiful as a vision, but
  evil. To the ears of Lygia and Acte came only the wail of the infant, which
  began to cry, it was unknown for what reason.</p>

  <p>Lygia&rsquo;s eyes too were filled with tears; but after a while she took
  Acte&rsquo;s hand and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us return. Help is to be looked
  for only whence it can come.&rdquo; And they returned to the atrium, which
  they did not leave till evening.</p>

  <p>When darkness had come and slaves brought in tapers with great flames,
  both women were very pale. Their conversation failed every moment. Both were
  listening to hear if some one were coming. Lygia repeated again and again
  that, though grieved to leave Acte, she preferred that all should take place
  that day, as Ursus must be waiting in the dark for her then. But her
  breathing grew quicker from emotion, and louder. Acte collected feverishly
  such jewels as she could, and, fastening them in a corner of Lygia&rsquo;s
  peplus, implored her not to reject that gift and means of escape. At moments
  came a deep silence full of deceptions for the ear. It seemed to both that
  they heard at one time a whisper beyond the curtain, at another the distant
  weeping of a child, at another the barking of dogs.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the curtain of the entrance moved without noise, and a tall, dark
  man, his face marked with small-pox, appeared like a spirit in the atrium. In
  one moment Lygia recognized Atacinus, a freedman of Vinicius, who had visited
  the house of Aulus.</p>

  <p>Acte screamed; but Atacinus bent low and said,&mdash;&ldquo;A greeting,
  divine Lygia, from Marcus Vinicius, who awaits thee with a feast in his house
  which is decked in green.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lips of the maiden grew pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; said she.</p>

  <p>Then she threw her arms around Acte&rsquo;s neck in farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The house of Vinicius was indeed decked in the green of
  myrtle and ivy, which had been hung on the walls and over the doors. The
  columns were wreathed with grape vine. In the atrium, which was closed above
  by a purple woollen cloth as protection from the night cold, it was as clear
  as in daylight. Eight and twelve flamed lamps were burning; these were like
  vessels, trees, animals, birds, or statues, holding cups filled with perfumed
  olive oil, lamps of alabaster, marble, or gilded Corinthian bronze, not so
  wonderful as that famed candlestick used by Nero and taken from the temple of
  Apollo, but beautiful and made by famous masters. Some of the lights were
  shaded by Alexandrian glass, or transparent stuffs from the Indus, of red,
  blue, yellow, or violet color, so that the whole atrium was filled with many
  colored rays. Everywhere was given out the odor of nard, to which Vinicius
  had grown used, and which he had learned to love in the Orient. The depths of
  the house, in which the forms of male and female slaves were moving, gleamed
  also with light. In the triclinium a table was laid for four persons. At the
  feast were to sit, besides Vinicius and Lygia, Petronius and Chrysothemis.
  Vinicius had followed in everything the words of Petronius, who advised him
  not to go for Lygia, but to send Atacinus with the permission obtained from
  Cæsar, to receive her himself in the house, receive her with friendliness and
  even with marks of honor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert drunk yesterday,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I saw thee. Thou
  didst act with her like a quarryman from the Alban Hills. Be not over-
  insistent, and remember that one should drink good wine slowly. Know too that
  it is sweet to desire, but sweeter to be desired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chrysothemis had her own and a somewhat different opinion on this point;
  but Petronius, calling her his vestal and his dove, began to explain the
  difference which must exist between a trained charioteer of the Circus and
  the youth who sits on the quadriga for the first time. Then, turning to
  Vinicius, he continued,&mdash;&ldquo;Win her confidence, make her joyful, be
  magnanimous. I have no wish to see a gloomy feast. Swear to her, by Hades
  even, that thou wilt return her to Pomponia, and it will be thy affair that
  to-morrow she prefers to stay with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then pointing to Chrysothemis, he added,&mdash;&ldquo;For five years I
  have acted thus more or less with this timid dove, and I cannot complain of
  her harshness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chrysothemis struck him with her fan of peacock feathers, and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;But I did not resist, thou satyr!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out of consideration for my predecessor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But wert thou not at my feet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; to put rings on thy toes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chrysothemis looked involuntarily at her feet, on the toes of which
  diamonds were really glittering; and she and Petronius began to laugh. But
  Vinicius did not give ear to their bantering. His heart was beating unquietly
  under the robes of a Syrian priest, in which he had arrayed himself to
  receive Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They must have left the palace,&rdquo; said he, as if in a
  monologue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They must,&rdquo; answered Petronius. &ldquo;Meanwhile I may
  mention the predictions of Apollonius of Tyana, or that history of Rufinus
  which I have not finished, I do not remember why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius cared no more for Apollonius of Tyana than for the history of
  Rufinus. His mind was with Lygia; and though he felt that it was more
  appropriate to receive her at home than to go in the rôle of a myrmidon to
  the palace, he was sorry at moments that he had not gone, for the single
  reason that he might have seen her sooner, and sat near her in the dark, in
  the double litter.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile slaves brought in a tripod ornamented with rams&rsquo; heads,
  bronze dishes with coals, on which they sprinkled bits of myrrh and nard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now they are turning toward the Carinæ,&rdquo; said Vinicius,
  again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He cannot wait; he will run to meet the litter, and is likely to
  miss them!&rdquo; exclaimed Chrysothemis.</p>

  <p>Vinicius smiled without thinking, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;On the contrary,
  I will wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he distended his nostrils and panted; seeing which, Petronius shrugged
  his shoulders, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;There is not in him a philosopher to
  the value of one sestertium, and I shall never make a man of that son of
  Mars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are now in the Carinæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact, they were turning toward the Carinæ. The slaves called lampadarii
  were in front; others called pedisequii, were on both sides of the litter.
  Atacinus was right behind, overseeing the advance. But they moved slowly, for
  lamps showed the way badly in a place not lighted at all. The streets near
  the palace were empty; here and there only some man moved forward with a
  lantern, but farther on the place was uncommonly crowded. From almost every
  alley people were pushing out in threes and fours, all without lamps, all in
  dark mantles. Some walked on with the procession, mingling with the slaves;
  others in greater numbers came from the opposite direction. Some staggered as
  if drunk. At moments the advance grew so difficult that the lampadarii
  cried,&mdash;&ldquo;Give way to the noble tribune, Marcus
  Vinicius!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia saw those dark crowds through the curtains which were pushed aside,
  and trembled with emotion. She was carried away at one moment by hope, at
  another by fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is he!&mdash;that is Ursus and the Christians! Now it will
  happen quickly,&rdquo; said she, with trembling lips. &ldquo;O Christ, aid! O
  Christ, save!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Atacinus himself, who at first did not notice the uncommon animation of
  the street, began at last to be alarmed. There was something strange in this.
  The lampadarii had to cry oftener and oftener, &ldquo;Give way to the litter
  of the noble tribune!&rdquo; From the sides unknown people crowded up to the
  litter so much that Atacinus commanded the slaves to repulse them with
  clubs.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a cry was heard in front of the procession. In one instant all
  the lights were extinguished. Around the litter came a rush, an uproar, a
  struggle.</p>

  <p>Atacinus saw that this was simply an attack; and when he saw it he was
  frightened. It was known to all that Cæsar with a crowd of attendants made
  attacks frequently for amusement in the Subura and in other parts of the
  city. It was known that even at times he brought out of these night
  adventures black and blue spots; but whoso defended himself went to his
  death, even if a senator. The house of the guards, whose duty it was to watch
  over the city, was not very far; but during such attacks the guards feigned
  to be deaf and blind.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile there was an uproar around the litter; people struck, struggled,
  threw, and trampled one another. The thought flashed on Atacinus to save
  Lygia and himself, above all, and leave the rest to their fate. So, drawing
  her out of the litter, he took her in his arms and strove to escape in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>But Lygia called, &ldquo;Ursus! Ursus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was dressed in white; hence it was easy to see her. Atacinus, with his
  other arm, which was free, was throwing his own mantle over her hastily, when
  terrible claws seized his neck, and on his head a gigantic, crushing mass
  fell like a stone.</p>

  <p>He dropped in one instant, as an ox felled by the back of an axe before
  the altar of Jove.</p>

  <p>The slaves for the greater part were either lying on the ground, or had
  saved themselves by scattering in the thick darkness, around the turns of the
  walls. On the spot remained only the litter, broken in the onset. Ursus bore
  away Lygia to the Subura; his comrades followed him, dispersing gradually
  along the way.</p>

  <p>The slaves assembled before the house of Vinicius, and took counsel. They
  had not courage to enter. After a short deliberation they returned to the
  place of conflict, where they found a few corpses, and among them Atacinus.
  He was quivering yet; but, after a moment of more violent convulsion, he
  stretched and was motionless.</p>

  <p>They took him then, and, returning, stopped before the gate a second time.
  But they must declare to their lord what had happened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let Gulo declare it,&rdquo; whispered some voices; &ldquo;blood is
  flowing from his face as from ours; and the master loves him; it is safer for
  Gulo than for others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gulo, a German, an old slave, who had nursed Vinicius, and was inherited
  by him from his mother, the sister of Petronius, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell him; but do ye all come. Do not let his anger fall on
  my head alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was growing thoroughly impatient. Petronius and Chrysothemis were
  laughing; but he walked with quick step up and down the atrium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They ought to be here! They ought to be here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He wished to go out to meet the litter, but Petronius and Chrysothemis
  detained him.</p>

  <p>Steps were heard suddenly in the entrance; the slaves rushed into the
  atrium in a crowd, and, halting quickly at the wall, raised their hands, and
  began to repeat with groaning,&mdash;&ldquo;Aaaa!&mdash;aa!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius sprang toward them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Lygia?&rdquo; cried he, with a terrible and changed
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aaaa!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Gulo pushed forward with his bloody face, and exclaimed, in haste and
  pitifully,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See our blood, lord! We fought! See our blood! See our
  blood!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he had not finished when Vinicius seized a bronze lamp, and with one
  blow shattered the skull of the slave; then, seizing his own head with both
  hands, he drove his fingers into his hair, repeating
  hoarsely,&mdash;&ldquo;Me miserum! me miserum!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face became blue, his eyes turned in his head, foam came out on his
  lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whips!&rdquo; roared he at last, with an unearthly voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord! Aaaa! Take pity!&rdquo; groaned the slaves.</p>

  <p>Petronius stood up with an expression of disgust on his face. &ldquo;Come,
  Chrysothemis!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If &rsquo;tis thy wish to look on raw
  flesh, I will give command to open a butcher&rsquo;s stall on the
  Carinæ!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he walked out of the atrium. But through the whole house, ornamented
  in the green of ivy and prepared for a feast, were heard, from moment to
  moment, groans and the whistling of whips, which lasted almost till
  morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Vinicius did not lie down that night. Some time after the
  departure of Petronius, when the groans of his flogged slaves could allay
  neither his rage nor his pain, he collected a crowd of other servants, and,
  though the night was far advanced, rushed forth at the head of these to look
  for Lygia. He visited the district of the Esquiline, then the Subura, Vicus
  Sceleratus, and all the adjoining alleys. Passing next around the Capitol, he
  went to the island over the bridge of Fabricius; after that he passed through
  a part of the Trans-Tiber. But that was a pursuit without object, for he
  himself had no hope of finding Lygia, and if he sought her it was mainly to
  fill out with something a terrible night. In fact he returned home about
  daybreak, when the carts and mules of dealers in vegetables began to appear
  in the city, and when bakers were opening their shops.</p>

  <p>On returning he gave command to put away Gulo&rsquo;s corpse, which no one
  had ventured to touch. The slaves from whom Lygia had been taken he sent to
  rural prisons,&mdash;a punishment almost more dreadful than death. Throwing
  himself at last on a couch in the atrium, he began to think confusedly of how
  he was to find and seize Lygia.</p>

  <p>To resign her, to lose her, not to see her again, seemed to him
  impossible; and at this thought alone frenzy took hold of him. For the first
  time in life the imperious nature of the youthful soldier met resistance, met
  another unbending will, and he could not understand simply how any one could
  have the daring to thwart his wishes. Vinicius would have chosen to see the
  world and the city sink in ruins rather than fail of his purpose. The cup of
  delight had been snatched from before his lips almost; hence it seemed to him
  that something unheard of had happened, something crying to divine and human
  laws for vengeance.</p>

  <p>But, first of all, he was unwilling and unable to be reconciled with fate,
  for never in life had he so desired anything as Lygia. It seemed to him that
  he could not exist without her. He could not tell himself what he was to do
  without her on the morrow, how he was to survive the days following. At
  moments he was transported by a rage against her, which approached madness.
  He wanted to have her, to beat her, to drag her by the hair to the cubiculum,
  and gloat over her; then, again, he was carried away by a terrible yearning
  for her voice, her form, her eyes, and he felt that he would be ready to lie
  at her feet. He called to her, gnawed his fingers, clasped his head with his
  hands. He strove with all his might to think calmly about searching for
  her,&mdash;and was unable. A thousand methods and means flew through his
  head, but one wilder than another. At last the thought flashed on him that no
  one else had intercepted her but Aulus, that in every case Aulus must know
  where she was hiding. And he sprang up to run to the house of Aulus.</p>

  <p>If they will not yield her to him, if they have no fear of his threats, he
  will go to Cæsar, accuse the old general of disobedience, and obtain a
  sentence of death against him; but before that, he will gain from them a
  confession of where Lygia is. If they give her, even willingly, he will be
  revenged. They received him, it is true, in their house and nursed
  him,&mdash;but that is nothing! With this one injustice they have freed him
  from every debt of gratitude. Here his vengeful and stubborn soul began to
  take pleasure at the despair of Pomponia Græcina, when the centurion would
  bring the death sentence to old Aulus. He was almost certain that he would
  get it. Petronius would assist him. Moreover, Cæsar never denies anything to
  his intimates, the Augustians, unless personal dislike or desire enjoins a
  refusal.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his heart almost died within him, under the influence of this
  terrible supposition,&mdash;&ldquo;But if Cæsar himself has taken
  Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All knew that Nero from tedium sought recreation in night attacks. Even
  Petronius took part in these amusements. Their main object was to seize women
  and toss each on a soldier&rsquo;s mantle till she fainted. Even Nero himself
  on occasions called these expeditions &ldquo;pearl hunts,&rdquo; for it
  happened that in the depth of districts occupied by a numerous and needy
  population they caught a real pearl of youth and beauty sometimes. Then the
  &ldquo;sagatio,&rdquo; as they termed the tossing, was changed into a genuine
  carrying away, and the pearl was sent either to the Palatine or to one of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s numberless villas, or finally Cæsar yielded it to one of his
  intimates. So might it happen also with Lygia. Cæsar had seen her during the
  feast; and Vinicius doubted not for an instant that she must have seemed to
  him the most beautiful woman he had seen yet. How could it be otherwise? It
  is true that Lygia had been in Nero&rsquo;s own house on the Palatine, and he
  might have kept her openly. But, as Petronius said truly, Cæsar had no
  courage in crime, and, with power to act openly, he chose to act always in
  secret. This time fear of Poppæa might incline him also to secrecy. It
  occurred now to the young soldier that Aulus would not have dared, perhaps,
  to carry off forcibly a girl given him, Vinicius, by Cæsar. Besides, who
  would dare? Would that gigantic blue-eyed Lygian, who had the courage to
  enter the triclinium and carry her from the feast on his arm? But where could
  he hide with her; whither could he take her? No! a slave would not have
  ventured that far. Hence no one had done the deed except Cæsar.</p>

  <p>At this thought it grew dark in his eyes, and drops of sweat covered his
  forehead. In that case Lygia was lost to him forever. It was possible to
  wrest her from the hands of any one else, but not from the hands of Cæsar.
  Now, with greater truth than ever, could he exclaim, &ldquo;Væ misero
  mihi!&rdquo; His imagination represented Lygia in Nero&rsquo;s arms, and, for
  the first time in life, he understood that there are thoughts which are
  simply beyond man&rsquo;s endurance. He knew then, for the first time, how he
  loved her. As his whole life flashes through the memory of a drowning man, so
  Lygia began to pass through his. He saw her, heard every word of
  hers,&mdash;saw her at the fountain, saw her at the house of Aulus, and at
  the feast; felt her near him, felt the odor of her hair, the warmth of her
  body, the delight of the kisses which at the feast he had pressed on her
  innocent lips. She seemed to him a hundred times sweeter, more beautiful,
  more desired than ever,&mdash;a hundred times more the only one, the one
  chosen from among all mortals and divinities. And when he thought that all
  this which had become so fixed in his heart, which had become his blood and
  life, might be possessed by Nero, a pain seized him, which was purely
  physical, and so piercing that he wanted to beat his head against the wall of
  the atrium, until he should break it. He felt that he might go mad; and he
  would have gone mad beyond doubt, had not vengeance remained to him. But as
  hitherto he had thought that he could not live unless he got Lygia, he
  thought now that he would not die till he had avenged her. This gave him a
  certain kind of comfort. &ldquo;I will be thy Cassius Chærea!&rdquo; [The
  slayer of Caligula] said he to himself in thinking of Nero. After a while,
  seizing earth in his hands from the flower vases surrounding the impluvium,
  he made a dreadful vow to Erebus, Hecate, and his own household lares, that
  he would have vengeance.</p>

  <p>And he received a sort of consolation. He had at least something to live
  for and something with which to fill his nights and days. Then, dropping his
  idea of visiting Aulus, he gave command to bear him to the Palatine. Along
  the way he concluded that if they would not admit him to Cæsar, or if they
  should try to find weapons on his person, it would be a proof that Cæsar had
  taken Lygia. He had no weapons with him. He had lost presence of mind in
  general; but as is usual with persons possessed by a single idea, he
  preserved it in that which concerned his revenge. He did not wish his desire
  of revenge to fall away prematurely. He wished above all to see Acte, for he
  expected to learn the truth from her. At moments the hope flashed on him that
  he might see Lygia also, and at that thought he began to tremble. For if
  Cæsar had carried her away without knowledge of whom he was taking, he might
  return her that day. But after a while he cast aside this supposition. Had
  there been a wish to return her to him, she would have been sent yesterday.
  Acte was the only person who could explain everything, and there was need to
  see her before others.</p>

  <p>Convinced of this, he commanded the slaves to hasten; and along the road
  he thought without order, now of Lygia, now of revenge. He had heard that
  Egyptian priests of the goddess Pasht could bring disease on whomever they
  wished, and he determined to learn the means of doing this. In the Orient
  they had told him, too, that Jews have certain invocations by which they
  cover their enemies&rsquo; bodies with ulcers. He had a number of Jews among
  his domestic slaves; hence he promised himself to torture them on his return
  till they divulged the secret. He found most delight, however, in thinking of
  the short Roman sword which lets out a stream of blood such as had gushed
  from Caius Caligula and made ineffaceable stains on the columns of the
  portico. He was ready to exterminate all Rome; and had vengeful gods promised
  that all people should die except him and Lygia, he would have accepted the
  promise.</p>

  <p>In front of the arch he regained presence of mind, and thought when he saw
  the pretorian guard, &ldquo;If they make the least difficulty in admitting
  me, they will prove that Lygia is in the palace by the will of
  Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the chief centurion smiled at him in a friendly manner, then advanced
  a number of steps, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;A greeting, noble tribune. If thou
  desire to give an obeisance to Cæsar, thou hast found an unfortunate moment.
  I do not think that thou wilt be able to see him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The infant Augusta fell ill yesterday on a sudden. Cæsar and the
  august Poppæa are attending her, with physicians whom they have summoned from
  the whole city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was an important event. When that daughter was born to him, Cæsar was
  simply wild from delight, and received her with extra humanum gaudium.
  Previously the senate had committed the womb of Poppæa to the gods with the
  utmost solemnity. A votive offering was made at Antium, where the delivery
  took place; splendid games were celebrated, and besides a temple was erected
  to the two Fortunes. Nero, unable to be moderate in anything, loved the
  infant beyond measure; to Poppæa the child was dear also, even for this, that
  it strengthened her position and made her influence irresistible.</p>

  <p>The fate of the whole empire might depend on the health and life of the
  infant Augusta; but Vinicius was so occupied with himself, his own case and
  his love, that without paying attention to the news of the centurion he
  answered, &ldquo;I only wish to see Acte.&rdquo; And he passed in.</p>

  <p>But Acte was occupied also near the child, and he had to wait a long time
  to see her. She came only about midday, with a face pale and wearied, which
  grew paler still at sight of Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Acte!&rdquo; cried Vinicius, seizing her hand and drawing her to
  the middle of the atrium, &ldquo;where is Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask thee touching that,&rdquo; answered she, looking
  him in the eyes with reproach.</p>

  <p>But though he had promised himself to inquire of her calmly, he pressed
  his head with his hands again, and said, with a face distorted by pain and
  anger,&mdash;&ldquo;She is gone. She was taken from me on the way!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a while, however, he recovered, and thrusting his face up to
  Acte&rsquo;s, said through his set teeth,&mdash;&ldquo;Acte! If life be dear
  to thee, if thou wish not to cause misfortunes which thou are unable even to
  imagine, answer me truly. Did Cæsar take her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar did not leave the palace yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the shade of thy mother, by all the gods, is she not in the
  palace?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the shade of my mother, Marcus, she is not in the palace, and
  Cæsar did not intercept her. The infant Augusta is ill since yesterday, and
  Nero has not left her cradle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius drew breath. That which had seemed the most terrible ceased to
  threaten him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; said he, sitting on the bench and clinching his
  fists, &ldquo;Aulus intercepted her, and in that case woe to him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus Plautius was here this morning. He could not see me, for I
  was occupied with the child; but he inquired of Epaphroditus, and others of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s servants, touching Lygia, and told them that he would come
  again to see me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He wished to turn suspicion from himself. If he knew not what
  happened, he would have come to seek Lygia in my house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He left a few words on a tablet, from which thou wilt see that,
  knowing Lygia to have been taken from his house by Cæsar, at thy request and
  that of Petronius, he expected that she would be sent to thee, and this
  morning early he was at thy house, where they told him what had
  happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When she had said this, she went to the cubiculum and returned soon with
  the tablet which Aulus had left.</p>

  <p>Vinicius read the tablet, and was silent; Acte seemed to read the thoughts
  on his gloomy face, for she said after a while,&mdash;&ldquo;No, Marcus. That
  has happened which Lygia herself wished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was known to thee that she wished to flee!&rdquo; burst out
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew that she would not become thy concubine.&rdquo; And she
  looked at him with her misty eyes almost sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou,&mdash;what hast thou been all thy life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was a slave, first of all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius did not cease to be enraged. Cæsar had given him Lygia; hence
  he had no need to inquire what she had been before. He would find her, even
  under the earth, and he would do what he liked with her. He would indeed! She
  should be his concubine. He would give command to flog her as often as he
  pleased. If she grew distasteful to him, he would give her to the lowest of
  his slaves, or he would command her to turn a handmill on his lands in
  Africa. He would seek her out now, and find her only to bend her, to trample
  on her, and conquer her.</p>

  <p>And, growing more and more excited, he lost every sense of measure, to the
  degree that even Acte saw that he was promising more than he could execute;
  that he was talking because of pain and anger. She might have had even
  compassion on him, but his extravagance exhausted her patience, and at last
  she inquired why he had come to her.</p>

  <p>Vinicius did not find an answer immediately. He had come to her because he
  wished to come, because he judged that she would give him information; but
  really he had come to Cæsar, and, not being able to see him, he came to her.
  Lygia, by fleeing, opposed the will of Cæsar; hence he would implore him to
  give an order to search for her throughout the city and the empire, even if
  it came to using for that purpose all the legions, and to ransacking in turn
  every house within Roman dominion. Petronius would support his prayer, and
  the search would begin from that day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a care,&rdquo; answered Acte, &ldquo;lest thou lose her
  forever the moment she is found, at command of Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius wrinkled his brows. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; inquired
  he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Marcus. Yesterday Lygia and I were in the gardens
  here, and we met Poppæa, with the infant Augusta, borne by an African woman,
  Lilith. In the evening the child fell ill, and Lilith insists that she was
  bewitched; that that foreign woman whom they met in the garden bewitched her.
  Should the child recover, they will forget this, but in the opposite case
  Poppæa will be the first to accuse Lygia of witchcraft, and wherever she is
  found there will be no rescue for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed; then Vinicius said,&mdash;&ldquo;But perhaps
  she did bewitch her, and has bewitched me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lilith repeats that the child began to cry the moment she carried
  her past us. And really the child did begin to cry. It is certain that she
  was sick when they took her out of the garden. Marcus, seek for Lygia
  whenever it may please thee, but till the infant Augusta recovers, speak not
  of her to Cæsar, or thou wilt bring on her Poppæa&rsquo;s vengeance. Her eyes
  have wept enough because of thee already, and may all the gods guard her poor
  head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou love her, Acte?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius, gloomily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I love her.&rdquo; And tears glittered in the eyes of the
  freedwoman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou lovest her because she has not repaid thee with hatred, as she
  has me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Acte looked at him for a time as if hesitating, or as if wishing to learn
  if he spoke sincerely; then she said,&mdash;&ldquo;O blind and passionate
  man&mdash;she loved thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius sprang up under the influence of those words, as if possessed.
  &ldquo;It is not true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hated him. How could Acte know? Would Lygia make a confession to her
  after one day&rsquo;s acquaintance? What love is that which prefers
  wandering, the disgrace of poverty, the uncertainty of to-morrow, or a
  shameful death even, to a wreath-bedecked house, in which a lover is waiting
  with a feast? It is better for him not to hear such things, for he is ready
  to go mad. He would not have given that girl for all Cæsar&rsquo;s treasures,
  and she fled. What kind of love is that which dreads delight and gives pain?
  Who can understand it? Who can fathom it? Were it not for the hope that he
  should find her, he would sink a sword in himself. Love surrenders; it does
  not take away. There were moments at the house of Aulus when he himself
  believed in near happiness, but now he knows that she hated him, that she
  hates him, and will die with hatred in her heart.</p>

  <p>But Acte, usually mild and timid, burst forth in her turn with
  indignation. How had he tried to win Lygia? Instead of bowing before Aulus
  and Pomponia to get her, he took the child away from her parents by
  stratagem. He wanted to make, not a wife, but a concubine of her, the foster
  daughter of an honorable house, and the daughter of a king. He had her
  brought to this abode of crime and infamy; he defiled her innocent eyes with
  the sight of a shameful feast; he acted with her as with a wanton. Had he
  forgotten the house of Aulus and Pomponia Græcina, who had reared Lygia? Had
  he not sense enough to understand that there are women different from Nigidia
  or Calvia Crispinilla or Poppæa, and from all those whom he meets in
  Cæsar&rsquo;s house? Did he not understand at once on seeing Lygia that she
  is an honest maiden, who prefers death to infamy? Whence does he know what
  kind of gods she worships, and whether they are not purer and better than the
  wanton Venus, or than Isis, worshipped by the profligate women of Rome? No!
  Lygia had made no confession to her, but she had said that she looked for
  rescue to him, to Vinicius: she had hoped that he would obtain for her
  permission from Cæsar to return home, that he would restore her to Pomponia.
  And while speaking of this, Lygia blushed like a maiden who loves and trusts.
  Lygia&rsquo;s heart beat for him; but he, Vinicius, had terrified and
  offended her; had made her indignant; let him seek her now with the aid of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s soldiers, but let him know that should Poppæa&rsquo;s child
  die, suspicion will fall on Lygia, whose destruction will then be
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>Emotion began to force its way through the anger and pain of Vinicius. The
  information that he was loved by Lygia shook him to the depth of his soul. He
  remembered her in Aulus&rsquo;s garden, when she was listening to his words
  with blushes on her face and her eyes full of light. It seemed to him then
  that she had begun to love him; and all at once, at that thought, a feeling
  of certain happiness embraced him, a hundred times greater than that which he
  desired. He thought that he might have won her gradually, and besides as one
  loving him. She would have wreathed his door, rubbed it with wolf&rsquo;s
  fat, and then sat as his wife by his hearth on the sheepskin. He would have
  heard from her mouth the sacramental: &ldquo;Where thou art, Caius, there am
  I, Caia.&rdquo; And she would have been his forever. Why did he not act thus?
  True, he had been ready so to act. But now she is gone, and it may be
  impossible to find her; and should he find her, perhaps he will cause her
  death, and should he not cause her death, neither she nor Aulus nor Pomponia
  Græcina will favor him. Here anger raised the hair on his head again; but his
  anger turned now, not against the house of Aulus, or Lygia, but against
  Petronius. Petronius was to blame for everything. Had it not been for him
  Lygia would not have been forced to wander; she would be his betrothed, and
  no danger would be hanging over her dear head. But now all is past, and it is
  too late to correct the evil which will not yield to correction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; And it seemed to him that a gulf had opened before
  his feet. He did not know what to begin, how to proceed, whither to betake
  himself. Acte repeated as an echo the words, &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; which
  from another&rsquo;s mouth sounded like a death sentence. He understood one
  thing, however, that he must find Lygia, or something evil would happen to
  him.</p>

  <p>And wrapping himself mechanically in his toga, he was about to depart
  without taking farewell even of Acte, when suddenly the curtain separating
  the entrance from the atrium was pushed aside, and he saw before him the
  pensive figure of Pomponia Græcina.</p>

  <p>Evidently she too had heard of the disappearance of Lygia, and, judging
  that she could see Acte more easily than Aulus, had come for news to her.</p>

  <p>But, seeing Vinicius, she turned her pale, delicate face to him, and said,
  after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;May God forgive thee the wrong, Marcus, which
  thou hast done to us and to Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood with drooping head, with a feeling of misfortune and guilt, not
  understanding what God was to forgive him or could forgive him. Pomponia had
  no cause to mention forgiveness; she ought to have spoken of revenge.</p>

  <p>At last he went out with a head devoid of counsel, full of grievous
  thoughts, immense care, and amazement.</p>

  <p>In the court and under the gallery were crowds of anxious people. Among
  slaves of the palace were knights and senators who had come to inquire about
  the health of the infant, and at the same time to show themselves in the
  palace, and exhibit a proof of their anxiety, even in presence of
  Nero&rsquo;s slaves. News of the illness of the &ldquo;divine&rdquo; had
  spread quickly it was evident, for new forms appeared in the gateway every
  moment, and through the opening of the arcade whole crowds were visible. Some
  of the newly arrived, seeing that Vinicius was coming from the palace,
  attacked him for news; but he hurried on without answering their questions,
  till Petronius, who had come for news too, almost struck his breast and
  stopped him.</p>

  <p>Beyond doubt Vinicius would have become enraged at sight of Petronius, and
  let himself do some lawless act in Cæsar&rsquo;s palace, had it not been that
  when he had left Acte he was so crushed, so weighed down and exhausted, that
  for the moment even his innate irascibility had left him. He pushed Petronius
  aside and wished to pass; but the other detained him, by force almost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is the divine infant?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>But this constraint angered Vinicius a second time, and roused his
  indignation in an instant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Hades swallow her and all this house!&rdquo; said he, gritting
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, hapless man!&rdquo; said Petronius, and looking around he
  added hurriedly,&mdash;&ldquo;If thou wish to know something of Lygia, come
  with me; I will tell nothing here! Come with me; I will tell my thoughts in
  the litter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And putting his arm around the young tribune, he conducted him from the
  palace as quickly as possible. That was his main concern, for he had no news
  whatever; but being a man of resources, and having, in spite of his
  indignation of yesterday, much sympathy for Vinicius, and finally feeling
  responsible for all that had happened, he had undertaken something already,
  and when they entered the litter he said,&mdash;&ldquo;I have commanded my
  slaves to watch at every gate. I gave them an accurate description of the
  girl, and that giant who bore her from the feast at Cæsar&rsquo;s,&mdash;for
  he is the man, beyond doubt, who intercepted her. Listen to me: Perhaps Aulus
  and Pomponia wish to secrete her in some estate of theirs; in that case we
  shall learn the direction in which they took her. If my slaves do not see her
  at some gate, we shall know that she is in the city yet, and shall begin this
  very day to search in Rome for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aulus does not know where she is,&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou sure of that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw Pomponia. She too is looking for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She could not leave the city yesterday, for the gates are closed at
  night. Two of my people are watching at each gate. One is to follow Lygia and
  the giant, the other to return at once and inform me. If she is in the city,
  we shall find her, for that Lygian is easily recognized, even by his stature
  and his shoulders. Thou art lucky that it was not Cæsar who took her, and I
  can assure thee that he did not, for there are no secrets from me on the
  Palatine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius burst forth in sorrow still more than in anger, and in a
  voice broken by emotion told Petronius what he had heard from Acte, and what
  new dangers were threatening Lygia,&mdash;dangers so dreadful that because of
  them there would be need to hide her from Poppæa most carefully, in case they
  discovered her. Then he reproached Petronius bitterly for his counsel. Had it
  not been for him, everything would have gone differently. Lygia would have
  been at the house of Aulus, and he, Vinicius, might have seen her every day,
  and he would have been happier at that moment than Cæsar. And carried away as
  he went on with his narrative, he yielded more and more to emotion, till at
  last tears of sorrow and rage began to fall from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Petronius, who had not even thought that the young man could love and
  desire to such a degree, when he saw the tears of despair said to himself,
  with a certain astonishment,&mdash;&ldquo;O mighty Lady of Cyprus, thou alone
  art ruler of gods and men!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When they alighted in front of the arbiter&rsquo;s house,
  the chief of the atrium answered them that of slaves sent to the gates none
  had returned yet. The atriensis had given orders to take food to them, and a
  new command, that under penalty of rods they were to watch carefully all who
  left the city.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou seest,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;that they are in Rome,
  beyond doubt, and in that case we shall find them. But command thy people
  also to watch at the gates,&mdash;those, namely, who were sent for Lygia, as
  they will recognize her easily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have given orders to send them to rural prisons,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius, &ldquo;but I will recall the orders at once, and let them go to the
  gates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And writing a few words on a wax-covered tablet, he handed it to
  Petronius, who gave directions to send it at once to the house of Vinicius.
  Then they passed into the interior portico, and, sitting on a marble bench,
  began to talk. The golden-haired Eunice and Iras pushed bronze footstools
  under their feet, and poured wine for them into goblets, out of wonderful
  narrow-necked pitchers from Volaterræ and Cæcina.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou among thy people any one who knows that giant
  Lygian?&rdquo; asked Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Atacinus and Gulo knew him; but Atacinus fell yesterday at the
  litter, and Gulo I killed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry for him,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;He carried not
  only thee, but me, in his arms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I intended to free him,&rdquo; answered Vinicius; &ldquo;but do not
  mention him. Let us speak of Lygia. Rome is a sea-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A sea is just the place where men fish for pearls. Of course we
  shall not find her to-day, or to-morrow, but we shall find her surely. Thou
  hast accused me just now of giving thee this method; but the method was good
  in itself, and became bad only when turned to bad. Thou hast heard from Aulus
  himself, that he intends to go to Sicily with his whole family. In that case
  the girl would be far from thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should follow them,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;and in every
  case she would be out of danger; but now, if that child dies, Poppæa will
  believe, and will persuade Cæsar, that she died because of Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True; that alarmed me, too. But that little doll may recover.
  Should she die, we shall find some way of escape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here Petronius meditated a while and added,&mdash;&ldquo;Poppæa, it is
  said, follows the religion of the Jews, and believes in evil spirits. Cæsar
  is superstitious. If we spread the report that evil spirits carried off
  Lygia, the news will find belief, especially as neither Cæsar nor Aulus
  Plautius intercepted her; her escape was really mysterious. The Lygian could
  not have effected it alone; he must have had help. And where could a slave
  find so many people in the course of one day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slaves help one another in Rome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some person pays for that with blood at times. True, they support
  one another, but not some against others. In this case it was known that
  responsibility and punishment would fall on thy people. If thou give thy
  people the idea of evil spirits, they will say at once that they saw such
  with their own eyes, because that will justify them in thy sight. Ask one of
  them, as a test, if he did not see spirits carrying off Lygia through the
  air, he will swear at once by the ægis of Zeus that he saw them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who was superstitious also, looked at Petronius with sudden and
  great fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If Ursus could not have men to help him, and was not able to take
  her alone, who could take her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius began to laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they will believe, since thou art half
  a believer thyself. Such is our society, which ridicules the gods. They, too,
  will believe, and they will not look for her. Meanwhile we shall put her away
  somewhere far off from the city, in some villa of mine or thine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But who could help her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her co-religionists,&rdquo; answered Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are they? What deity does she worship? I ought to know that
  better than thou.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nearly every woman in Rome honors a different one. It is almost
  beyond doubt that Pomponia reared her in the religion of that deity which she
  herself worships; what one she worships I know not. One thing is certain,
  that no person has seen her make an offering to our gods in any temple. They
  have accused her even of being a Christian; but that is not possible; a
  domestic tribunal cleared her of the charge. They say that Christians not
  only worship an ass&rsquo;s head, but are enemies of the human race, and
  permit the foulest crimes. Pomponia cannot be a Christian, as her virtue is
  known, and an enemy of the human race could not treat slaves as she
  does.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In no house are they treated as at Aulus&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
  interrupted Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Pomponia mentioned to me some god, who must be one powerful and
  merciful. Where she has put away all the others is her affair; it is enough
  that that Logos of hers cannot be very mighty, or rather he must be a very
  weak god, since he has had only two adherents,&mdash;Pomponia and
  Lygia,&mdash;and Ursus in addition. It must be that there are more of those
  adherents, and that they assisted Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That faith commands forgiveness,&rdquo; said Vinicius. &ldquo;At
  Acte&rsquo;s I met Pomponia, who said to me: &rsquo;May God forgive thee the
  evil which thou hast done to us and to Lygia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evidently their God is some curator who is very mild. Ha! let him
  forgive thee, and in sign of forgiveness return thee the maiden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would offer him a hecatomb to-morrow! I have no wish for food, or
  the bath, or sleep. I will take a dark lantern and wander through the city.
  Perhaps I shall find her in disguise. I am sick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at him with commiseration. In fact, there was blue under
  his eyes, his pupils were gleaming with fever, his unshaven beard indicated a
  dark strip on his firmly outlined jaws, his hair was in disorder, and he was
  really like a sick man. Iras and the golden-haired Eunice looked at him also
  with sympathy; but he seemed not to see them, and he and Petronius took no
  notice whatever of the slave women, just as they would not have noticed dogs
  moving around them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fever is tormenting thee,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then listen to me. I know not what the doctor has prescribed to
  thee, but I know how I should act in thy place. Till this lost one is found I
  should seek in another that which for the moment has gone from me with her. I
  saw splendid forms at thy villa. Do not contradict me. I know what love is;
  and I know that when one is desired another cannot take her place. But in a
  beautiful slave it is possible to find even momentary distraction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not need it,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>But Petronius, who had for him a real weakness, and who wished to soften
  his pain, began to meditate how he might do so.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps thine have not for thee the charm of novelty,&rdquo; said
  he, after a while (and here he began to look in turn at Iras and Eunice, and
  finally he placed his palm on the hip of the golden-haired Eunice).
  &ldquo;Look at this grace! for whom some days since Fonteius Capiton the
  younger offered three wonderful boys from Clazomene. A more beautiful figure
  than hers even Skopas himself has not chiselled. I myself cannot tell why I
  have remained indifferent to her thus far, since thoughts of Chrysothemis
  have not restrained me. Well, I give her to thee; take her for
  thyself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When the golden-haired Eunice heard this, she grew pale in one moment,
  and, looking with frightened eyes on Vinicius, seemed to wait for his answer
  without breath in her breast.</p>

  <p>But he sprang up suddenly, and, pressing his temples with his hands, said
  quickly, like a man who is tortured by disease, and will not hear
  anything,&mdash;&ldquo;No, no! I care not for her! I care not for others! I
  thank thee, but I do not want her. I will seek that one through the city.
  Give command to bring me a Gallic cloak with a hood. I will go beyond the
  Tiber&mdash;if I could see even Ursus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he hurried away. Petronius, seeing that he could not remain in one
  place, did not try to detain him. Taking, however, his refusal as a temporary
  dislike for all women save Lygia, and not wishing his own magnanimity to go
  for naught, he said, turning to the slave,&mdash;&ldquo;Eunice, thou wilt
  bathe and anoint thyself, then dress: after that thou wilt go to the house of
  Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But she dropped before him on her knees, and with joined palms implored
  him not to remove her from the house. She would not go to Vinicius, she said.
  She would rather carry fuel to the hypocaustum in his house than be chief
  servant in that of Vinicius. She would not, she could not go; and she begged
  him to have pity on her. Let him give command to flog her daily, only not
  send her away.</p>

  <p>And trembling like a leaf with fear and excitement, she stretched her
  hands to him, while he listened with amazement. A slave who ventured to beg
  relief from the fulfilment of a command, who said &ldquo;I will not and I
  cannot,&rdquo; was something so unheard-of in Rome that Petronius could not
  believe his own ears at first. Finally he frowned. He was too refined to be
  cruel. His slaves, especially in the department of pleasure, were freer than
  others, on condition of performing their service in an exemplary manner, and
  honoring the will of their master, like that of a god. In case they failed in
  these two respects, he was able not to spare punishment, to which, according
  to general custom, they were subject. Since, besides this, he could not
  endure opposition, nor anything which ruffled his calmness, he looked for a
  while at the kneeling girl, and then said,&mdash;&ldquo;Call Tiresias, and
  return with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eunice rose, trembling, with tears in her eyes, and went out; after a time
  she returned with the chief of the atrium, Tiresias, a Cretan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt take Eunice,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;and give her
  five-and-twenty lashes, in such fashion, however, as not to harm her
  skin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he passed into the library, and, sitting down at a
  table of rose-colored marble, began to work on his &ldquo;Feast of
  Trimalchion.&rdquo; But the flight of Lygia and the illness of the infant
  Augusta had disturbed his mind so much that he could not work long. That
  illness, above all, was important. It occurred to Petronius that were Cæsar
  to believe that Lygia had cast spells on the infant, the responsibility might
  fall on him also, for the girl had been brought at his request to the palace.
  But he could reckon on this, that at the first interview with Cæsar he would
  be able in some way to show the utter absurdity of such an idea; he counted a
  little, too, on a certain weakness which Poppæa had for him,&mdash;a weakness
  hidden carefully, it is true, but not so carefully that he could not divine
  it. After a while he shrugged his shoulders at these fears, and decided to go
  to the triclinium to strengthen himself, and then order the litter to bear
  him once more to the palace, after that to the Campus Martius, and then to
  Chrysothemis.</p>

  <p>But on the way to the triclinium at the entrance to the corridor assigned
  to servants, he saw unexpectedly the slender form of Eunice standing, among
  other slaves, at the wall; and forgetting that he had given Tiresias no order
  beyond flogging her, he wrinkled his brow again, and looked around for the
  atriensis. Not seeing him among the servants, he turned to Eunice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou received the lashes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She cast herself at his feet a second time, pressed the border of his toga
  to her lips, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, yes, lord, I have received them! Oh,
  yes, lord!&rdquo; In her voice were heard, as it were, joy and gratitude. It
  was clear that she looked on the lashes as a substitute for her removal from
  the house, and that now she might stay there. Petronius, who understood this,
  wondered at the passionate resistance of the girl; but he was too deeply
  versed in human nature not to know that love alone could call forth such
  resistance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou love some one in this house?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>She raised her blue, tearful eyes to him, and answered, in a voice so low
  that it was hardly possible to hear her,&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And with those eyes, with that golden hair thrown back, with fear and hope
  in her face, she was so beautiful, she looked at him so entreatingly, that
  Petronius, who, as a philosopher, had proclaimed the might of love, and who,
  as a man of æsthetic nature, had given homage to all beauty, felt for her a
  certain species of compassion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whom of those dost thou love?&rdquo; inquired he, indicating the
  servants with his head.</p>

  <p>There was no answer to that question. Eunice inclined her head to his feet
  and remained motionless.</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at the slaves, among whom were beautiful and stately
  youths. He could read nothing on any face; on the contrary, all had certain
  strange smiles. He looked then for a while on Eunice lying at his feet, and
  went in silence to the triclinium.</p>

  <p>After he had eaten, he gave command to bear him to the palace, and then to
  Chrysothemis, with whom he remained till late at night. But when he returned,
  he gave command to call Tiresias.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did Eunice receive the flogging?&rdquo; inquired he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She did, lord. Thou didst not let the skin be cut,
  however.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I give no other command touching her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord,&rdquo; answered the atriensis with alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is well. Whom of the slaves does she love?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou know of her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tiresias began to speak in a somewhat uncertain voice:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At night Eunice never leaves the cubiculum in which she lives with
  old Acrisiona and Ifida; after thou art dressed she never goes to the bath-
  rooms. Other slaves ridicule her, and call her Diana.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;My relative, Vinicius, to
  whom I offered her to-day, did not accept her; hence she may stay in the
  house. Thou art free to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it permitted me to speak more of Eunice, lord?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have commanded thee to say all thou knowest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The whole familia are speaking of the flight of the maiden who was
  to dwell in the house of the noble Vinicius. After thy departure, Eunice came
  to me and said that she knew a man who could find her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! What kind of man is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not, lord; but I thought that I ought to inform thee of this
  matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is well. Let that man wait to-morrow in my house for the
  arrival of the tribune, whom thou wilt request in my name to meet me
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The atriensis bowed and went out. But Petronius began to think of Eunice.
  At first it seemed clear to him that the young slave wished Vinicius to find
  Lygia for this reason only, that she would not be forced from his house.
  Afterward, however, it occurred to him that the man whom Eunice was pushing
  forward might be her lover, and all at once that thought seemed to him
  disagreeable. There was, it is true, a simple way of learning the truth, for
  it was enough to summon Eunice; but the hour was late, Petronius felt tired
  after his long visit with Chrysothemis, and was in a hurry to sleep. But on
  the way to the cubiculum he remembered&mdash;it is unknown why&mdash;that he
  had noticed wrinkles, that day, in the corners of Chrysothemis&rsquo;s eyes.
  He thought, also, that her beauty was more celebrated in Rome than it
  deserved; and that Fonteius Capiton, who had offered him three boys from
  Clazomene for Eunice, wanted to buy her too cheaply.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Next morning, Petronius had barely finished dressing in the
  unctorium when Vinicius came, called by Tiresias. He knew that no news had
  come from the gates. This information, instead of comforting him, as a proof
  that Lygia was still in Rome, weighed him down still more, for he began to
  think that Ursus might have conducted her out of the city immediately after
  her seizure, and hence before Petronius&rsquo;s slaves had begun to keep
  watch at the gates. It is true that in autumn, when the days become shorter,
  the gates are closed rather early; but it is true, also, that they are opened
  for persons going out, and the number of these is considerable. It was
  possible, also, to pass the walls by other ways, well known, for instance, to
  slaves who wish to escape from the city. Vinicius had sent out his people to
  all roads leading to the provinces, to watchmen in the smaller towns,
  proclaiming a pair of fugitive slaves, with a detailed description of Ursus
  and Lygia, coupled with the offer of a reward for seizing them. But it was
  doubtful whether that pursuit would reach the fugitives; and even should it
  reach them, whether the local authorities would feel justified in making the
  arrest at the private instance of Vinicius, without the support of a pretor.
  Indeed, there had not been time to obtain such support. Vinicius himself,
  disguised as a slave, had sought Lygia the whole day before, through every
  corner of the city, but had been unable to find the least indication or trace
  of her. He had seen Aulus&rsquo;s servants, it is true; but they seemed to be
  seeking something also, and that confirmed him in the belief that it was not
  Aulus who had intercepted the maiden, and that the old general did not know
  what had happened to her.</p>

  <p>When Tiresias announced to him, then, that there was a man who would
  undertake to find Lygia, he hurried with all speed to the house of Petronius;
  and barely had he finished saluting his uncle, when he inquired for the
  man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see him at once, Eunice knows him,&rdquo; said Petronius.
  &ldquo;She will come this moment to arrange the folds of my toga, and will
  give nearer information concerning him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! she whom thou hadst the wish to bestow on me
  yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The one whom thou didst reject; for which I am grateful, for she is
  the best vestiplica in the whole city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact, the vestiplica came in before he had finished speaking, and
  taking the toga, laid on a chair inlaid with pearl, she opened the garment to
  throw it on Petronius&rsquo;s shoulder. Her face was clear and calm; joy was
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at her. She seemed to him very beautiful. After a while,
  when she had covered him with the toga, she began to arrange it, bending at
  times to lengthen the folds. He noticed that her arms had a marvellous pale
  rose-color, and her bosom and shoulders the transparent reflections of pearl
  or alabaster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eunice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has the man come to Tiresias whom
  thou didst mention yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo Chilonides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A physician, a sage, a soothsayer, who knows how to read
  people&rsquo;s fates and predict the future.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he predicted the future to thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eunice was covered with a blush which gave a rosy color to her ears and
  her neck even.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has he predicted?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That pain and happiness would meet me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pain met thee yesterday at the hands of Tiresias; hence happiness
  also should come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has come, lord, already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remain,&rdquo; said she in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Petronius put his hand on her golden head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast arranged the folds well to-day, and I am satisfied with
  thee, Eunice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Under that touch her eyes were mist-covered in one instant from happiness,
  and her bosom began to heave quickly.</p>

  <p>Petronius and Vinicius passed into the atrium, where Chilo Chilonides was
  waiting. When he saw them, he made a low bow. A smile came to the lips of
  Petronius at thought of his suspicion of yesterday, that this man might be
  Eunice&rsquo;s lover. The man who was standing before him could not be any
  one&rsquo;s lover. In that marvellous figure there was something both foul
  and ridiculous. He was not old; in his dirty beard and curly locks a gray
  hair shone here and there. He had a lank stomach and stooping shoulders, so
  that at the first cast of the eye he appeared to be hunchbacked; above that
  hump rose a large head, with the face of a monkey and also of a fox; the eye
  was penetrating. His yellowish complexion was varied with pimples; and his
  nose, covered with them completely, might indicate too great a love for the
  bottle. His neglected apparel, composed of a dark tunic of goat&rsquo;s wool
  and a mantle of similar material with holes in it, showed real or simulated
  poverty. At sight of him, Homer&rsquo;s Thersites came to the mind of
  Petronius. Hence, answering with a wave of the hand to his bow, he
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A greeting, divine Thersites! How are the lumps which Ulysses gave
  thee at Troy, and what is he doing himself in the Elysian Fields?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble lord,&rdquo; answered Chilo Chilonides, &ldquo;Ulysses, the
  wisest of the dead, sends a greeting through me to Petronius, the wisest of
  the living, and the request to cover my lumps with a new mantle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Hecate Triformis!&rdquo; exclaimed Petronius, &ldquo;the answer
  deserves a new mantle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But further conversation was interrupted by the impatient Vinicius, who
  inquired directly,&mdash;&ldquo;Dost thou know clearly what thou art
  undertaking?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When two households in two lordly mansions speak of naught else,
  and when half Rome is repeating the news, it is not difficult to know,&rdquo;
  answered Chilo. &ldquo;The night before last a maiden named Lygia, but
  specially Callina, and reared in the house of Aulus Plautius, was
  intercepted. Thy slaves were conducting her, O lord, from Cæsar&rsquo;s
  palace to thy &lsquo;insula,&rsquo; and I undertake to find her in the city,
  or, if she has left the city&mdash;which is little likely&mdash;to indicate
  to thee, noble tribune, whither she has fled and where she has
  hidden.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="caption">Chilo undertakes to find Lygia.<br>

  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said Vinicius, who was pleased with the
  precision of the answer. &ldquo;What means hast thou to do this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo smiled cunningly. &ldquo;Thou hast the means, lord; I have the wit
  only.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius smiled also, for he was perfectly satisfied with his guest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That man can find the maiden,&rdquo; thought he. Meanwhile Vinicius
  wrinkled his joined brows, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Wretch, in case thou
  deceive me for gain, I will give command to beat thee with clubs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a philosopher, lord, and a philosopher cannot be greedy of
  gain, especially of such as thou hast just offered magnanimously.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, art thou a philosopher?&rdquo; inquired Petronius.
  &ldquo;Eunice told me that thou art a physician and a soothsayer. Whence
  knowest thou Eunice?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She came to me for aid, for my fame struck her ears.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What aid did she want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aid in love, lord. She wanted to be cured of unrequited
  love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didst thou cure her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did more, lord. I gave her an amulet which secures mutuality. In
  Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, is a temple, O lord, in which is preserved a
  zone of Venus. I gave her two threads from that zone, enclosed in an almond
  shell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And didst thou make her pay well for them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One can never pay enough for mutuality, and I, who lack two fingers
  on my right hand, am collecting money to buy a slave copyist to write down my
  thoughts, and preserve my wisdom for mankind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of what school art thou, divine sage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a Cynic, lord, because I wear a tattered mantle; I am a Stoic,
  because I bear poverty patiently; I am a Peripatetic, for, not owning a
  litter, I go on foot from one wine-shop to another, and on the way teach
  those who promise to pay for a pitcher of wine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And at the pitcher thou dost become a rhetor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heraclitus declares that &lsquo;all is fluid,&rsquo; and canst thou
  deny, lord, that wine is fluid?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he declared that fire is a divinity; divinity, therefore, is
  blushing in thy nose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the divine Diogenes from Apollonia declared that air is the
  essence of things, and the warmer the air the more perfect the beings it
  makes, and from the warmest come the souls of sages. And since the autumns
  are cold, a genuine sage should warm his soul with wine; and wouldst thou
  hinder, O lord, a pitcher of even the stuff produced in Capua or Telesia from
  bearing heat to all the bones of a perishable human body?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo Chilonides, where is thy birthplace?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the Euxine Pontus. I come from Mesembria.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Chilo, thou art great!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And unrecognized,&rdquo; said the sage, pensively.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius was impatient again. In view of the hope which had gleamed
  before him, he wished Chilo to set out at once on his work; hence the whole
  conversation seemed to him simply a vain loss of time, and he was angry at
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When wilt thou begin the search?&rdquo; asked he, turning to the
  Greek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have begun it already,&rdquo; answered Chilo. &ldquo;And since I
  am here, and answering thy affable question, I am searching yet. Only have
  confidence, honored tribune, and know that if thou wert to lose the string of
  thy sandal I should find it, or him who picked it up on the
  street.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou been employed in similar services?&rdquo; asked
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>The Greek raised his eyes. &ldquo;To-day men esteem virtue and wisdom too
  low, for a philosopher not to be forced to seek other means of
  living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are thy means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To know everything, and to serve those with news who are in need of
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And who pay for it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, lord, I need to buy a copyist. Otherwise my wisdom will perish
  with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thou hast not collected enough yet to buy a sound mantle, thy
  services cannot be very famous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Modesty hinders me. But remember, lord, that to-day there are not
  such benefactors as were numerous formerly; and for whom it was as pleasant
  to cover service with gold as to swallow an oyster from Puteoli. No; my
  services are not small, but the gratitude of mankind is small. At times, when
  a valued slave escapes, who will find him, if not the only son of my father?
  When on the walls there are inscriptions against the divine Poppæa, who will
  indicate those who composed them? Who will discover at the book-stalls verses
  against Cæsar? Who will declare what is said in the houses of knights and
  senators? Who will carry letters which the writers will not intrust to
  slaves? Who will listen to news at the doors of barbers? For whom have
  wine-shops and bake-shops no secret? In whom do slaves trust? Who can see
  through every house, from the atrium to the garden? Who knows every street,
  every alley and hiding-place? Who knows what they say in the baths, in the
  Circus, in the markets, in the fencing-schools, in slave-dealers&rsquo;
  sheds, and even in the arenas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the gods! enough, noble sage!&rdquo; cried Petronius; &ldquo;we
  are drowning in thy services, thy virtue, thy wisdom, and thy eloquence.
  Enough! We wanted to know who thou art, and we know!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius was glad, for he thought that this man, like a hound, once
  put on the trail, would not stop till he had found out the hiding-place.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;dost thou need indications?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I need arms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of what kind?&rdquo; asked Vinicius, with astonishment.</p>

  <p>The Greek stretched out one hand; with the other he made the gesture of
  counting money.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such are the times, lord,&rdquo; said he, with a sigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt be the ass, then,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;to win
  the fortress with bags of gold?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am only a poor philosopher,&rdquo; answered Chilo, with humility;
  &ldquo;ye have the gold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius tossed him a purse, which the Greek caught in the air, though two
  fingers were lacking on his right hand.</p>

  <p>He raised his head then, and said: &ldquo;I know more than thou thinkest.
  I have not come empty-handed. I know that Aulus did not intercept the maiden,
  for I have spoken with his slaves. I know that she is not on the Palatine,
  for all are occupied with the infant Augusta; and perhaps I may even divine
  why ye prefer to search for the maiden with my help rather than that of the
  city guards and Cæsar&rsquo;s soldiers. I know that her escape was effected
  by a servant,&mdash;a slave coming from the same country as she. He could not
  find assistance among slaves, for slaves all stand together, and would not
  act against thy slaves. Only a co-religionist would help him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear, Vinicius?&rdquo; broke in Petronius. &ldquo;Have I not
  said the same, word for word, to thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is an honor for me,&rdquo; said Chilo. &ldquo;The maiden,
  lord,&rdquo; continued he, turning again to Vinicius, &ldquo;worships beyond
  a doubt the same divinity as that most virtuous of Roman ladies, that genuine
  matron, Pomponia. I have heard this, too, that Pomponia was tried in her own
  house for worshipping some kind of foreign god, but I could not learn from
  her slaves what god that is, or what his worshippers are called. If I could
  learn that, I should go to them, become the most devoted among them, and gain
  their confidence. But thou, lord, who hast passed, as I know too, a number of
  days in the house of the noble Aulus, canst thou not give me some information
  thereon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye have asked me long about various things, noble lords, and I have
  answered the questions; permit me now to give one. Hast thou not seen,
  honored tribune, some statuette, some offering, some token, some amulet on
  Pomponia or thy divine Lygia? Hast thou not seen them making signs to each
  other, intelligible to them alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Signs? Wait! Yes; I saw once that Lygia made a fish on the
  sand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fish? A-a! O-o-o! Did she do that once, or a number of
  times?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And art thou certain, lord, that she outlined a fish? O-
  o?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, with roused curiosity. &ldquo;Dost
  thou divine what that means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I divine!&rdquo; exclaimed Chilo. And bowing in sign of
  farewell, he added: &ldquo;May Fortune scatter on you both equally all gifts,
  worthy lords!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give command to bring thee a mantle,&rdquo; said Petronius to him
  at parting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ulysses gives thee thanks for Thersites,&rdquo; said the Greek; and
  bowing a second time, he walked out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What wilt thou say of that noble sage?&rdquo; inquired
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This, that he will find Lygia,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, with
  delight; &ldquo;but I will say, too, that were there a kingdom of rogues he
  might be the king of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most certainly. I shall make a nearer acquaintance with this stoic;
  meanwhile I must give command to perfume the atrium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Chilo Chilonides, wrapping his new mantle about him, threw up on his
  palm, under its folds, the purse received from Vinicius, and admired both its
  weight and its jingle. Walking on slowly, and looking around to see if they
  were not looking at him from the house, he passed the portico of Livia, and,
  reaching the corner of the Clivus Virbius, turned toward the Subura.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must go to Sporus,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;and pour out
  a little wine to Fortuna. I have found at last what I have been seeking this
  long time. He is young, irascible, bounteous as mines in Cyprus, and ready to
  give half his fortune for that Lygian linnet. Just such a man have I been
  seeking this long time. It is needful, however, to be on one&rsquo;s guard
  with him, for the wrinkling of his brow forebodes no good. Ah! the
  wolf-whelps lord it over the world to-day! I should fear that Petronius less.
  O gods! but the trade of procurer pays better at present than virtue. Ah! she
  drew a fish on the sand! If I know what that means, may I choke myself with a
  piece of goat&rsquo;s cheese! But I shall know. Fish live under water, and
  searching under water is more difficult than on land, ergo he will pay me
  separately for this fish. Another such purse and I might cast aside the
  beggar&rsquo;s wallet and buy myself a slave. But what wouldst thou say,
  Chilo, were I to advise thee to buy not a male but a female slave? I know
  thee; I know that thou wouldst consent. If she were beautiful, like Eunice,
  for instance, thou thyself wouldst grow young near her, and at the same time
  wouldst have from her a good and certain income. I sold to that poor Eunice
  two threads from my old mantle. She is dull; but if Petronius were to give
  her to me, I would take her. Yes, yes, Chilo Chilonides, thou hast lost
  father and mother, thou art an orphan; therefore buy to console thee even a
  female slave. She must indeed live somewhere, therefore Vinicius will hire
  her a dwelling, in which thou too mayest find shelter; she must dress, hence
  Vinicius will pay for the dress; and must eat, hence he will support her.
  Och! what a hard life! Where are the times in which for an obolus a man could
  buy as much pork and beans as he could hold in both hands, or a piece of
  goat&rsquo;s entrails as long as the arm of a boy twelve years old, and
  filled with blood? But here is that villain Sporus! In the wine-shop it will
  be easier to learn something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus conversing, he entered the wine-shop and ordered a pitcher of
  &ldquo;dark&rdquo; for himself. Seeing the sceptical look of the shopkeeper,
  he took a gold coin from his purse, and, putting it on the table,
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Sporus, I toiled to-day with Seneca from dawn till midday,
  and this is what my friend gave me at parting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The plump eyes of Sporus became plumper still at this sight, and the wine
  was soon before Chilo. Moistening his fingers in it, he drew a fish on the
  table, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Knowest what that means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fish? Well, a fish,&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s a fish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art dull; though thou dost add so much water to the wine that
  thou mightst find a fish in it. This is a symbol which, in the language of
  philosophers, means &lsquo;the smile of fortune.&rsquo; If thou hadst divined
  it, thou too mightst have made a fortune. Honor philosophy, I tell thee, or I
  shall change my wine-shop,&mdash;an act to which Petronius, my personal
  friend, has been urging me this long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a number of days after the interview, Chilo did not show
  himself anywhere. Vinicius, since he had learned from Acte that Lygia loved
  him, was a hundred times more eager to find her, and began himself to search.
  He was unwilling, and also unable, to ask aid of Cæsar, who was in great fear
  because of the illness of the infant Augusta.</p>

  <p>Sacrifices in the temples did not help, neither did prayers and offerings,
  nor the art of physicians, nor all the means of enchantment to which they
  turned finally. In a week the child died. Mourning fell upon the court and
  Rome. Cæsar, who at the birth of the infant was wild with delight, was wild
  now from despair, and, confining himself in his apartments, refused food for
  two days; and though the palace was swarming with senators and Augustians,
  who hastened with marks of sorrow and sympathy, he denied audience to every
  one. The senate assembled in an extraordinary session, at which the dead
  child was pronounced divine. It was decided to rear to her a temple and
  appoint a special priest to her service. New sacrifices were offered in other
  temples in honor of the deceased; statues of her were cast from precious
  metals; and her funeral was one immense solemnity, during which the people
  wondered at the unrestrained marks of grief which Cæsar exhibited; they wept
  with him, stretched out their hands for gifts, and above all amused
  themselves with the unparalleled spectacle.</p>

  <p>That death alarmed Petronius. All knew in Rome that Poppæa ascribed it to
  enchantment. The physicians, who were thus enabled to explain the vanity of
  their efforts, supported her; the priests, whose sacrifices proved powerless,
  did the same, as well as the sorcerers, who were trembling for their lives,
  and also the people. Petronius was glad now that Lygia had fled; for he
  wished no evil to Aulus and Pomponia, and he wished good to himself and
  Vinicius; therefore when the cypress, set out before the Palatine as a sign
  of mourning, was removed, he went to the reception appointed for the senators
  and Augustians to learn how far Nero had lent ear to reports of spells, and
  to neutralize results which might come from his belief.</p>

  <p>Knowing Nero, he thought, too, that though he did not believe in charms,
  he would feign belief, so as to magnify his own suffering, and take vengeance
  on some one, finally, to escape the suspicion that the gods had begun to
  punish him for crimes. Petronius did not think that Cæsar could love really
  and deeply even his own child; though he loved her passionately, he felt
  certain, however, that he would exaggerate his suffering. He was not
  mistaken. Nero listened, with stony face and fixed eyes, to the consolation
  offered by knights and senators. It was evident that, even if he suffered, he
  was thinking of this: What impression would his suffering make upon others?
  He was posing as a Niobe, and giving an exhibition of parental sorrow, as an
  actor would give it on the stage. He had not the power even then to endure in
  his silent and as it were petrified sorrow, for at moments he made a gesture
  as if to cast the dust of the earth on his head, and at moments he groaned
  deeply; but seeing Petronius, he sprang up and cried in a tragic voice, so
  that all present could hear him,&mdash;&ldquo;Eheu! And thou art guilty of
  her death! At thy advice the evil spirit entered these walls,&mdash;the evil
  spirit which, with one look, drew the life from her breast! Woe is me! Would
  that my eyes had not seen the light of Helios! Woe is me! Eheu!
  eheu!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And raising his voice still more, he passed into a despairing shout; but
  Petronius resolved at that moment to put everything on one cast of the dice;
  hence, stretching out his hand, he seized the silk kerchief which Nero wore
  around his neck always, and, placing it on the mouth of the Imperator, said
  solemnly,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, Rome and the world are benumbed with pain; but
  do thou preserve thy voice for us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Those present were amazed; Nero himself was amazed for a moment. Petronius
  alone was unmoved; he knew too well what he was doing. He remembered,
  besides, that Terpnos and Diodorus had a direct order to close Cæsar&rsquo;s
  mouth whenever he raised his voice too much and exposed it to danger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Cæsar!&rdquo; continued he, with the same seriousness and sorrow,
  &ldquo;we have suffered an immeasurable loss; let even this treasure of
  consolation remain to us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero&rsquo;s face quivered, and after a while tears came from his eyes.
  All at once he rested his hands on Petronius&rsquo;s shoulders, and, dropping
  his head on his breast, began to repeat, amid sobs,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou alone of all thought of this,&mdash;thou alone, O Petronius!
  thou alone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus grew yellow from envy; but Petronius continued,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to Antium! there she came to the world, there joy flowed in on
  thee, there solace will come to thee. Let the sea air freshen thy divine
  throat; let thy breast breathe the salt dampness. We, thy devoted ones, will
  follow thee everywhere; and when we assuage thy pain with friendship, thou
  wilt comfort us with song.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; answered Nero, sadly, &ldquo;I will write a hymn in
  her honor, and compose music for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then thou wilt find the warm sun in Baiæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And afterward&mdash;forgetfulness in Greece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the birthplace of poetry and song.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And his stony, gloomy state of mind passed away gradually, as clouds pass
  that are covering the sun; and then a conversation began which, though full
  of sadness, yet was full of plans for the future,&mdash;touching a journey,
  artistic exhibitions, and even the receptions required at the promised coming
  of Tiridates, King of Armenia. Tigellinus tried, it is true, to bring forward
  again the enchantment; but Petronius, sure now of victory, took up the
  challenge directly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tigellinus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;dost thou think that
  enchantments can injure the gods?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar himself has mentioned them,&rdquo; answered the courtier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pain was speaking, not Cæsar; but thou&mdash;what is thy opinion of
  the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods are too mighty to be subject to charms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then wouldst thou deny divinity to Cæsar and his family?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peractum est!&rdquo; muttered Eprius Marcellus, standing near,
  repeating that shout which the people gave always when a gladiator in the
  arena received such a blow that he needed no other.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus gnawed his own anger. Between him and Petronius there had long
  existed a rivalry touching Nero. Tigellinus had this superiority, that Nero
  acted with less ceremony, or rather with none whatever in his presence; while
  thus far Petronius overcame Tigellinus at every encounter with wit and
  intellect.</p>

  <p>So it happened now. Tigellinus was silent, and simply recorded in his
  memory those senators and knights who, when Petronius withdrew to the depth
  of the chamber, surrounded him straightway, supposing that after this
  incident he would surely be Cæsar&rsquo;s first favorite.</p>

  <p>Petronius, on leaving the palace, betook himself to Vinicius, and
  described his encounter with Cæsar and Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not only have I turned away danger,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from
  Aulus Plautius, Pomponia, and us, but even from Lygia, whom they will not
  seek, even for this reason, that I have persuaded Bronzebeard, the monkey, to
  go to Antium, and thence to Naples or Baiæ and he will go. I know that he has
  not ventured yet to appear in the theatre publicly; I have known this long
  time that he intends to do so at Naples. He is dreaming, moreover, of Greece,
  where he wants to sing in all the more prominent cities, and then make a
  triumphal entry into Rome, with all the crowns which the
  &lsquo;Græculi&rsquo; will bestow on him. During that time we shall be able
  to seek Lygia unhindered and secrete her in safety. But has not our noble
  philosopher been here yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy noble philosopher is a cheat. No; he has not shown himself, and
  he will not show himself again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I have a better understanding, if not of his honesty, of his
  wit. He has drawn blood once from thy purse, and will come even for this, to
  draw it a second time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him beware lest I draw his own blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Draw it not; have patience till thou art convinced surely of his
  deceit. Do not give him more money, but promise a liberal reward if he brings
  thee certain information. Wilt thou thyself undertake something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My two freedmen, Nymphidius and Demas, are searching for her with
  sixty men. Freedom is promised the slave who finds her. Besides I have sent
  out special persons by all roads leading from Rome to inquire at every inn
  for the Lygian and the maiden. I course through the city myself day and
  night, counting on a chance meeting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whenever thou hast tidings let me know, for I must go to
  Antium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if thou wake up some morning and say, &rsquo;It is not worth
  while to torment myself for one girl, and take so much trouble because of
  her,&rsquo; come to Antium. There will be no lack of women there, or
  amusement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius began to walk with quick steps. Petronius looked for some time at
  him, and said at last,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me sincerely, not as a mad head, who
  talks something into his brain and excites himself, but as a man of judgment
  who is answering a friend: Art thou concerned as much as ever about this
  Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius stopped a moment, and looked at Petronius as if he had not seen
  him before; then he began to walk again. It was evident that he was
  restraining an outburst. At last, from a feeling of helplessness, sorrow,
  anger, and invincible yearning, two tears gathered in his eyes, which spoke
  with greater power to Petronius than the most eloquent words.</p>

  <p>Then, meditating for a moment, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;It is not Atlas who
  carries the world on his shoulders, but woman; and sometimes she plays with
  it as with a ball.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>And they began to take farewell of each other. But at that moment a slave
  announced that Chilo Chilonides was waiting in the antechamber, and begged to
  be admitted to the presence of the lord.</p>

  <p>Vinicius gave command to admit him immediately, and Petronius
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! have I not told thee? By Hercules! keep thy calmness;
  or he will command thee, not thou him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A greeting and honor to the noble tribune of the army, and to thee,
  lord,&rdquo; said Chilo, entering. &ldquo;May your happiness be equal to your
  fame, and may your fame course through the world from the pillars of Hercules
  to the boundaries of the Arsacidæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A greeting, O lawgiver of virtue and wisdom,&rdquo; answered
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius inquired with affected calmness, &ldquo;What dost thou
  bring?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The first time I came I brought thee hope, O lord; at present, I
  bring certainty that the maiden will be found.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That means that thou hast not found her yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, lord; but I have found what that sign means which she made. I
  know who the people are who rescued her, and I know the God among whose
  worshippers to seek her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius wished to spring from the chair in which he was sitting; but
  Petronius placed his hand on his shoulder, and turning to Chilo
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Speak on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou perfectly certain, lord, that she drew a fish on the
  sand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; burst out Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then she is a Christian and Christians carried her away.&rdquo; A
  moment of silence followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Chilo,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;My relative has
  predestined to thee a considerable sum of money for finding the girl, but a
  no less considerable number of rods if thou deceive him. In the first case
  thou wilt purchase not one, but three scribes; in the second, the philosophy
  of all the seven sages, with the addition of thy own, will not suffice to get
  thee ointment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The maiden is a Christian, lord,&rdquo; cried the Greek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Chilo. Thou art not a dull man. We know that Junia and Calvia
  Crispinilla accused Pomponia Græcina of confessing the Christian
  superstition; but we know too, that a domestic court acquitted her. Wouldst
  thou raise this again? Wouldst thou persuade us that Pomponia, and with her
  Lygia, could belong to the enemies of the human race, to the poisoners of
  wells and fountains, to the worshippers of an ass&rsquo;s head, to people who
  murder infants and give themselves up to the foulest license? Think, Chilo,
  if that thesis which thou art announcing to us will not rebound as an
  antithesis on thy own back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo spread out his arms in sign that that was not his fault, and then
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, utter in Greek the following sentence: Jesus Christ,
  Son of God, Saviour.&rdquo; [Iesous Christos, Theou Uios, Soter.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I have uttered it. What comes of that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now take the first letters of each of those words and put them into
  one word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fish!&rdquo; said Petronius with astonishment. [Ichthus, the Greek
  word for &ldquo;fish.&rdquo;]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, that is why fish has become the watchword of the
  Christians,&rdquo; answered Chilo, proudly.</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed. But there was something so striking in the
  conclusions of the Greek that the two friends could not guard themselves from
  amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius, art thou not mistaken?&rdquo; asked Petronius. &ldquo;Did
  Lygia really draw a fish for thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all the infernal gods, one might go mad!&rdquo; cried the young
  man, with excitement. &ldquo;If she had drawn a bird for me, I should have
  said a bird.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Therefore she is a Christian,&rdquo; repeated Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This signifies,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;that Pomponia and
  Lygia poison wells, murder children caught on the street, and give themselves
  up to dissoluteness! Folly! Thou, Vinicius, wert at their house for a time, I
  was there a little while; but I know Pomponia and Aulus enough, I know even
  Lygia enough, to say monstrous and foolish! If a fish is the symbol of the
  Christians, which it is difficult really to deny, and if those women are
  Christians, then, by Proserpina! evidently Christians are not what we hold
  them to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou speakest like Socrates, lord,&rdquo; answered Chilo.
  &ldquo;Who has ever examined a Christian? Who has learned their religion?
  When I was travelling three years ago from Naples hither to Rome (oh, why did
  I not stay in Naples!), a man joined me, whose name was Glaucus, of whom
  people said that he was a Christian; but in spite of that I convinced myself
  that he was a good and virtuous man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was it not from that virtuous man that thou hast learned now what
  the fish means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, lord, on the way, at an inn, some one thrust a knife
  into that honorable old man; and his wife and child were carried away by
  slave-dealers. I lost in their defence these two fingers; since, as people
  say, there is no lack among Christians of miracles, I hope that the fingers
  will grow out on my hand again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that? Hast thou become a Christian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since yesterday, lord, since yesterday! The fish made me a
  Christian. But see what a power there is in it. For some days I shall be the
  most zealous of the zealous, so that they may admit me to all their secrets;
  and when they admit me to their secrets, I shall know where the maiden is
  hiding. Perhaps then my Christianity will pay me better than my philosophy. I
  have made a vow also to Mercury, that if he helps me to find the maiden, I
  will sacrifice to him two heifers of the same size and color and will gild
  their horns.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then thy Christianity of yesterday and thy philosophy of long
  standing permit thee to believe in Mercury?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe always in that in which I need to believe; that is my
  philosophy, which ought to please Mercury. Unfortunately (ye know, worthy
  lords, what a suspicious god he is), he does not trust the promises even of
  blameless philosophers, and prefers the heifers in advance; meanwhile this
  outlay is immense. Not every one is a Seneca, and I cannot afford the
  sacrifice; should the noble Vinicius, however, wish to give something, on
  account of that sum which he promised&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not an obolus, Chilo!&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;not an obolus.
  The bounty of Vinicius will surpass thy expectations, but only when Lygia is
  found,&mdash;that is, when thou shalt indicate to us her hiding-place.
  Mercury must trust thee for the two heifers, though I am not astonished at
  him for not wishing to do so; in this I recognize his acuteness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, worthy lords. The discovery which I have made is
  great; for though I have not found the maiden yet, I have found the way in
  which I must seek her. Ye have sent freedmen and slaves throughout the city
  and into the country; has any one given you a clew? No! I alone have given
  one. I tell you more. Among your slaves there may be Christians, of whom ye
  have no knowledge, for this superstition has spread everywhere; and they,
  instead of aiding, will betray you. It is unfortunate that they see me here;
  do thou therefore, noble Petronius, enjoin silence on Eunice; and thou too,
  noble Vinicius, spread a report that I sell thee an ointment which insures
  victory in the Circus to horses rubbed with it. I alone will search for her,
  and single-handed I will find the fugitives; and do ye trust in me, and know
  that whatever I receive in advance will be for me simply an encouragement,
  for I shall hope always for more, and shall feel the greater certainty that
  the promised reward will not fail me. Ah, it is true! As a philosopher I
  despise money, though neither Seneca, nor even Musonius, nor Cornutus
  despises it, though they have not lost fingers in any one&rsquo;s defence,
  and are able themselves to write and leave their names to posterity. But,
  aside from the slave, whom I intend to buy, and besides Mercury, to whom I
  have promised the heifers,&mdash;and ye know how dear cattle have become in
  these times,&mdash;the searching itself involves much outlay. Only listen to
  me patiently. Well, for the last few days my feet are wounded from continual
  walking. I have gone to wine-shops to talk with people, to bakeries, to
  butcher-shops, to dealers in olive oil, and to fishermen. I have run through
  every street and alley; I have been in the hiding places of fugitive slaves;
  I have lost money, nearly a hundred ases, in playing mora; I have been in
  laundries, in drying-sheds, in cheap kitchens; I have seen mule-drivers and
  carvers; I have seen people who cure bladder complaints and pull teeth; I
  have talked with dealers in dried figs; I have been at cemeteries; and do ye
  know why? This is why; so as to outline a fish everywhere, look people in the
  eyes, and hear what they would say of that sign. For a long time I was unable
  to learn anything, till at last I saw an old slave at a fountain. He was
  drawing water with a bucket, and weeping. Approaching him, I asked the cause
  of his tears. When we had sat down on the steps of the fountain, he answered
  that all his life he had been collecting sestertium after sestertium, to
  redeem his beloved son; but his master, a certain Pansa, when the money was
  delivered to him, took it, but kept the son in slavery. &lsquo;And so I am
  weeping,&rsquo; said the old man, &rsquo;for though I repeat, Let the will of
  God be done, I, poor sinner, am not able to keep down my tears.&rsquo; Then,
  as if penetrated by a forewarning, I moistened my finger in the water and
  drew a fish for him. To this he answered, &rsquo;My hope, too, is in
  Christ.&rsquo; I asked him then, &rsquo;Hast thou confessed to me by that
  sign?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;and peace be with
  thee.&rsquo; I began then to draw him out, and the honest old man told me
  everything. His master, that Pansa, is himself a freedman of the great Pansa;
  and he brings stones by the Tiber to Rome, where slaves and hired persons
  unload them from the boats, and carry them to buildings in the night time, so
  as not to obstruct movement in the streets during daylight. Among these
  people many Christians work, and also his son; as the work is beyond his
  son&rsquo;s strength, he wished to redeem him. But Pansa preferred to keep
  both the money and the slave. While telling me this, he began again to weep;
  and I mingled my tears with his,&mdash;tears came to me easily because of my
  kind heart, and the pain in my feet, which I got from walking excessively. I
  began also to lament that as I had come from Naples only a few days since, I
  knew no one of the brotherhood, and did not know where they assembled for
  prayer. He wondered that Christians in Naples had not given me letters to
  their brethren in Rome; but I explained to him that the letters were stolen
  from me on the road. Then he told me to come to the river at night, and he
  would acquaint me with brethren who would conduct me to houses of prayer and
  to elders who govern the Christian community. When I heard this, I was so
  delighted that I gave him the sum needed to redeem his son, in the hope that
  the lordly Vinicius would return it to me twofold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo,&rdquo; interrupted Petronius, &ldquo;in thy narrative
  falsehood appears on the surface of truth, as oil does on water. Thou hast
  brought important information; I do not deny that. I assert, even, that a
  great step is made toward finding Lygia; but do not cover thy news with
  falsehood. What is the name of that old man from whom thou hast learned that
  the Christians recognize each other through the sign of a fish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Euricius. A poor, unfortunate old man! He reminded me of Glaucus,
  whom I defended from murderers, and he touched me mainly by this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe that thou didst discover him, and wilt be able to make
  use of the acquaintance; but thou hast given him no money. Thou hast not
  given him an as; dost understand me? Thou hast not given anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I helped him to lift the bucket, and I spoke of his son with
  the greatest sympathy. Yes, lord, what can hide before the penetration of
  Petronius? Well, I did not give him money, or rather, I gave it to him, but
  only in spirit, in intention, which, had he been a real philosopher, should
  have sufficed him. I gave it to him because I saw that such an act was
  indispensable and useful; for think, lord, how this act has won all the
  Christians at once to me, what access to them it has opened, and what
  confidence it has roused in them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;and it was thy duty to do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For this very reason I have come to get the means to do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius turned to Vinicius,&mdash;&ldquo;Give command to count out to
  him five thousand sestertia, but in spirit, in intention.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will give thee a young man,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;who will
  take the sum necessary; thou wilt say to Euricius that the youth is thy
  slave, and thou wilt count out to the old man, in the youth&rsquo;s presence,
  this money. Since thou hast brought important tidings, thou wilt receive the
  same amount for thyself. Come for the youth and the money this
  evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a real Cæsar!&rdquo; said Chilo. &ldquo;Permit me, lord,
  to dedicate my work to thee; but permit also that this evening I come only
  for the money, since Euricius told me that all the boats had been unloaded,
  and that new ones would come from Ostia only after some days. Peace be with
  you! Thus do Christians take farewell of one another. I will buy myself a
  slave woman,&mdash;that is, I wanted to say a slave man. Fish are caught with
  a bait, and Christians with fish. Fax vobiscum! pax! pax! pax!&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Petronius</i> to <i>Vinicius</i>:</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I send to thee from Antium, by a trusty slave, this
letter, to
  which, though thy hand is more accustomed to the sword and the javelin than
  the pen, I think that thou wilt answer through the same messenger without
  needless delay. I left thee on a good trail, and full of hope; hence I trust
  that thou hast either satisfied thy pleasant desires in the embraces of
  Lygia, or wilt satisfy them before the real wintry wind from the summits of
  Soracte shall blow on the Campania. Oh, my Vinicius! may thy preceptress be
  the golden goddess of Cyprus; be thou, on thy part, the preceptor of that
  Lygian Aurora, who is fleeing before the sun of love. And remember always
  that marble, though most precious, is nothing of itself, and acquires real
  value only when the sculptor&rsquo;s hand turns it into a masterpiece. Be
  thou such a sculptor, carissime! To love is not sufficient; one must know how
  to love; one must know how to teach love. Though the plebs, too, and even
  animals, experience pleasure, a genuine man differs from them in this
  especially, that he makes love in some way a noble art, and, admiring it,
  knows all its divine value, makes it present in his mind, thus satisfying not
  his body merely, but his soul. More than once, when I think here of the
  emptiness, the uncertainty, the dreariness of life, it occurs to me that
  perhaps thou hast chosen better, and that not Cæsar&rsquo;s court, but war
  and love, are the only objects for which it is worth while to be born and to
  live.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert fortunate in war, be fortunate also in love; and if thou
  art curious as to what men are doing at the court of Cæsar, I will inform
  thee from time to time. We are living here at Antium, and nursing our
  heavenly voice; we continue to cherish the same hatred of Rome, and think of
  betaking ourselves to Baiæ for the winter, to appear in public at Naples,
  whose inhabitants, being Greeks, will appreciate us better than that wolf
  brood on the banks of the Tiber. People will hasten thither from Baiæ, from
  Pompeii, Puteoli, Cumæ, and Stabia; neither applause nor crowns will be
  lacking, and that will be an encouragement for the proposed expedition to
  Achæa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the memory of the infant Augusta? Yes! we are bewailing her
  yet. We are singing hymns of our own composition, so wonderful that the
  sirens have been hiding from envy in Amphitrite&rsquo;s deepest caves. But
  the dolphins would listen to us, were they not prevented by the sound of the
  sea. Our suffering is not allayed yet; hence we will exhibit it to the world
  in every form which sculpture can employ, and observe carefully if we are
  beautiful in our suffering and if people recognize this beauty. Oh, my dear!
  we shall die buffoons and comedians!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the Augustians are here, male and female, not counting ten
  thousand servants, and five hundred she asses, in whose milk Poppæa bathes.
  At times even it is cheerful here. Calvia Crispinilla is growing old. It is
  said that she has begged Poppæa to let her take the bath immediately after
  herself. Lucan slapped Nigidia on the face, because he suspected her of
  relations with a gladiator. Sporus lost his wife at dice to Senecio.
  Torquatus Silanus has offered me for Eunice four chestnut horses, which this
  year will win the prize beyond doubt. I would not accept! Thanks to thee,
  also, that thou didst not take her. As to Torquatus Silanus, the poor man
  does not even suspect that he is already more a shade than a man. His death
  is decided. And knowest what his crime is? He is the great-grandson of the
  deified Augustus. There is no rescue for him. Such is our world.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As is known to thee, we have been expecting Tiridates here;
  meanwhile Vologeses has written an offensive letter. Because he has conquered
  Armenia, he asks that it be left to him for Tiridates; if not, he will not
  yield it in any case. Pure comedy! So we have decided on war. Corbulo will
  receive power such as Pompeius Magnus received in the war with pirates. There
  was a moment, however, when Nero hesitated. He seems afraid of the glory
  which Corbulo will win in case of victory. It was even thought to offer the
  chief command to our Aulus. This was opposed by Poppæa, for whom evidently
  Pomponia&rsquo;s virtue is as salt in the eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vatinius described to us a remarkable fight of gladiators, which is
  to take place in Beneventum. See to what cobblers rise in our time, in spite
  of the saying, &lsquo;Ne sutor ultra crepidam!&rsquo; Vitelius is the
  descendant of a cobbler; but Vatinius is the son of one! Perhaps he drew
  thread himself! The actor Aliturus represented Oedipus yesterday wonderfully.
  I asked him, by the way, as a Jew, if Christians and Jews were the same. He
  answered that the Jews have an eternal religion, but that Christians are a
  new sect risen recently in Judea; that in the time of Tiberius the Jews
  crucified a certain man, whose adherents increase daily, and that the
  Christians consider him as God. They refuse, it seems, to recognize other
  gods, ours especially. I cannot understand what harm it would do them to
  recognize these gods.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tigellinus shows me open enmity now. So far he is unequal to me;
  but he is, superior in this, that he cares more for life, and is at the same
  time a greater scoundrel, which brings him nearer Ahenobarbus. These two will
  understand each other earlier or later, and then my turn will come. I know
  not when it will come; but I know this, that as things are it must come;
  hence let time pass. Meanwhile we must amuse ourselves. Life of itself would
  not be bad were it not for Bronzebeard. Thanks to him, a man at times is
  disgusted with himself. It is not correct to consider the struggle for his
  favor as a kind of rivalry in a circus,&mdash;as a kind of game, as a
  struggle, in which victory flatters vanity. True, I explain it to myself in
  that way frequently; but still it seems to me sometimes that I am like Chilo,
  and better in nothing than he. When he ceases to be needful to thee, send him
  to me. I have taken a fancy to his edifying conversation. A greeting from me
  to thy divine Christian, or rather beg her in my name not to be a fish to
  thee. Inform me of thy health, inform me of thy love, know how to love, teach
  how to love, and farewell.&rdquo;</p>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><i>Vinicius</i> to <i>Petronius</i>:</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Lygia is not found yet! Were it not for the hope
that I shall find
  her soon, thou wouldst not receive an answer; for when a man is disgusted
  with life, he has no wish to write letters. I wanted to learn whether Chilo
  was not deceiving me; and at night when he came to get the money for
  Euricius, I threw on a military mantle, and unobserved followed him and the
  slave whom I sent with him. When they reached the place, I watched from a
  distance, hidden behind a portico pillar, and convinced myself that Euricius
  was not invented. Below, a number of tens of people were unloading stones
  from a spacious barge, and piling them up on the bank. I saw Chilo approach
  them, and begin to talk with some old man, who after a while fell at his
  feet. Others surrounded them with shouts of admiration. Before my eyes the
  boy gave a purse to Euricius, who on seizing it began to pray with upraised
  hands, while at his side some second person was kneeling, evidently his son.
  Chilo said something which I could not hear, and blessed the two who were
  kneeling, as well as others, making in the air signs in the form of a cross,
  which they honor apparently, for all bent their knees. The desire seized me
  to go among them, and promise three such purses to him who would deliver to
  me Lygia; but I feared to spoil Chilo&rsquo;s work, and after hesitating a
  moment went home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This happened at least twelve days after thy departure. Since then
  Chilo has been a number of times with me. He says that he has gained great
  significance among the Christians; that if he has not found Lygia so far, it
  is because the Christians in Rome are innumerable, hence all are not
  acquainted with each person in their community, and cannot know everything
  that is done in it. They are cautious, too, and in general reticent. He gives
  assurance, however, that when he reaches the elders, who are called
  presbyters, he will learn every secret. He has made the acquaintance of a
  number of these already, and has begun to inquire of them, though carefully,
  so as not to rouse suspicion by haste, and not to make the work still more
  difficult. Though it is hard to wait, though patience fails, I feel that he
  is right, and I wait.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He learned, too, that they have places of meeting for prayer,
  frequently outside the city, in empty houses and even in sand-pits. There
  they worship Christ, sing hymns, and have feasts. There are many such places.
  Chilo supposes that Lygia goes purposely to different ones from Pomponia, so
  that the latter, in case of legal proceedings or an examination, might swear
  boldly that she knew nothing of Lygia&rsquo;s hiding place. It may be that
  the presbyters have advised caution. When Chilo discovers those places, I
  will go with him; and if the gods let me see Lygia, I swear to thee by
  Jupiter that she will not escape my hands this time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am thinking continually of those places of prayer. Chilo is
  unwilling that I should go with him; he is afraid. But I cannot stay at home.
  I should know her at once, even in disguise or if veiled. They assemble in
  the night, but I should recognize her in the night even. I should know her
  voice and motions anywhere. I will go myself in disguise, and look at every
  person who goes in or out. I am thinking of her always, and shall recognize
  her. Chilo is to come to-morrow, and we shall go. I will take arms. Some of
  my slaves sent to the provinces have returned empty-handed. But I am certain
  now that she is in the city, perhaps not far away even. I myself have visited
  many houses under pretext of renting them. She will fare better with me a
  hundred times; where she is, whole legions of poor people dwell. Besides, I
  shall spare nothing for her sake. Thou writest that I have chosen well. I
  have chosen suffering and sorrow. We shall go first to those houses which are
  in the city, then beyond the gates. Hope looks for something every morning,
  otherwise life would be impossible. Thou sayest that one should know how to
  love. I knew how to talk of love to Lygia. But now I only yearn; I do nothing
  but wait for Chilo. Life to me is unendurable in my own house.
  Farewell!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But Chilo did not appear for some time, and Vinicius knew
  not at last what to think of his absence. In vain he repeated to himself that
  searching, if continued to a certain and successful issue, must be gradual.
  His blood and impulsive nature rebelled against the voice of judgment. To do
  nothing, to wait, to sit with folded arms, was so repulsive to him that he
  could not be reconciled to it in any way. To search the alleys of the city in
  the dark garb of a slave, through this alone, that it was useless, seemed to
  him merely a mask for his own inefficiency, and could give no satisfaction.
  His freedmen, persons of experience, whom he commanded to search
  independently, turned out a hundred times less expert than Chilo. Meanwhile
  there rose in him, besides his love for Lygia, the stubbornness of a player
  resolved to win. Vinicius had been always a person of this kind. From
  earliest youth he had accomplished what he desired with the passionateness of
  one who does not understand failure, or the need of yielding something. For a
  time military discipline had put his self-will within bounds, but also it had
  engrafted into him the conviction that every command of his to subordinates
  must be fulfilled; his prolonged stay in the Orient, among people pliant and
  inured to slavish obedience, confirmed in him the faith that for his &ldquo;I
  wish&rdquo; there were no limits. At present his vanity, too, was wounded
  painfully. There was, besides, in Lygia&rsquo;s opposition and resistance,
  and in her flight itself, which was to him incomprehensible, a kind of
  riddle. In trying to solve this riddle he racked his head terribly. He felt
  that Acte had told the truth, and that Lygia was not indifferent. But if this
  were true, why had she preferred wandering and misery to his love, his
  tenderness, and a residence in his splendid mansion? To this question he
  found no answer, and arrived only at a kind of dim understanding that between
  him and Lygia, between their ideas, between the world which belonged to him
  and Petronius, and the world of Lygia and Pomponia, there existed some sort
  of difference, some kind of misunderstanding as deep as an abyss, which
  nothing could fill up or make even. It seemed to him, then, that he must lose
  Lygia; and at this thought he lost the remnant of balance which Petronius
  wished to preserve in him. There were moments in which he did not know
  whether he loved Lygia or hated her; he understood only that he must find
  her, and he would rather that the earth swallowed her than that he should not
  see and possess her. By the power of imagination he saw her as clearly at
  times as if she had been before his face. He recalled every word which he had
  spoken to her; every word which he had heard from her. He felt her near; felt
  her on his bosom, in his arms; and then desire embraced him like a flame. He
  loved her and called to her.</p>

  <p>And when he thought that he was loved, that she might do with willingness
  all that he wished of her, sore and endless sorrow seized him, and a kind of
  deep tenderness flooded his heart, like a mighty wave. But there were
  moments, too, in which he grew pale from rage, and delighted in thoughts of
  the humiliation and tortures which he would inflict on Lygia when he found
  her. He wanted not only to have her, but to have her as a trampled slave. At
  the same time he felt that if the choice were left him, to be her slave or
  not to see her in life again, he would rather be her slave. There were days
  in which he thought of the marks which the lash would leave on her rosy body,
  and at the same time he wanted to kiss those marks. It came to his head also
  that he would be happy if he could kill her.</p>

  <p>In this torture, torment, uncertainty, and suffering, he lost health, and
  even beauty. He became a cruel and incomprehensible master. His slaves, and
  even his freedmen, approached him with trembling; and when punishments fell
  on them causelessly,&mdash;punishments as merciless as undeserved,&mdash;they
  began to hate him in secret; while he, feeling this, and feeling his own
  isolation, took revenge all the more on them. He restrained himself with
  Chilo alone, fearing lest he might cease his searches; the Greek, noting
  this, began to gain control of him, and grew more and more exacting. At first
  he assured Vinicius at each visit that the affair would proceed easily and
  quickly; now he began to discover difficulties, and without ceasing, it is
  true, to guarantee the undoubted success of the searches, he did not hide the
  fact that they must continue yet for a good while.</p>

  <p>At last he came, after long days of waiting, with a face so gloomy that
  the young man grew pale at sight of him, and springing up had barely strength
  to ask,&mdash;&ldquo;Is she not among the Christians?&rdquo; &ldquo;She is,
  lord,&rdquo; answered Chilo; &ldquo;but I found Glaucus among them.&rdquo;
  &ldquo;Of what art thou speaking, and who is Glaucus?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou hast
  forgotten, lord, it seems, that old man with whom I journeyed from Naples to
  Rome, and in whose defence I lost these two fingers,&mdash;a loss which
  prevents me from writing. Robbers, who bore away his wife and child, stabbed
  him with a knife. I left him dying at an inn in Minturna, and bewailed him
  long. Alas! I have convinced myself that he is alive yet, and belongs in Rome
  to the Christian community.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who could not understand what the question was, understood only
  that Glaucus was becoming a hindrance to the discovery of Lygia; hence he
  suppressed his rising anger, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;If thou didst defend him,
  he should be thankful and help thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! worthy tribune, even gods are not always grateful, and what
  must the case be with men? True, he should be thankful. But, unhappily, he is
  an old man, of a mind weak and darkened by age and disappointment; for which
  reason, not only is he not grateful, but, as I learned from his co-
  religionists, he accuses me of having conspired with the robbers, and says
  that I am the cause of his misfortunes. That is the recompense for my
  fingers!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scoundrel! I am certain that it was as he says,&rdquo; replied
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then thou knowest more than he does, lord, for he only surmises
  that it was so; which, however, would not prevent him from summoning the
  Christians, and from revenging himself on me cruelly. He would have done that
  undoubtedly, and others, with equal certainty, would have helped him; but
  fortunately he does not know my name, and in the house of prayer where we
  met, he did not notice me. I, however, knew him at once, and at the first
  moment wished to throw myself on his neck. Wisdom, however, and the habit of
  thinking before every step which I intend to take, restrained me. Therefore,
  on issuing from the house of prayer, I inquired concerning him, and those who
  knew him declared that he was the man who had been betrayed by his comrade on
  the journey from Naples. Otherwise I should not have known that he gives out
  such a story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How does this concern me? Tell what thou sawest in the house of
  prayer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does not concern thee, lord, but it concerns me just as much as
  my life. Since I wish that my wisdom should survive me, I would rather
  renounce the reward which thou hast offered, than expose my life for empty
  lucre; without which, I as a true philosopher shall be able to live and seek
  divine wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius approached him with an ominous countenance, and began in a
  suppressed voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Who told thee that death would meet thee
  sooner at the hands of Glaucus than at mine? Whence knowest thou, dog, that I
  will not have thee buried right away in my garden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo, who was a coward, looked at Vinicius, and in the twinkle of an eye
  understood that one more unguarded word and he was lost beyond
  redemption.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will search for her, lord, and I will find her!&rdquo; cried he,
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Silence followed, during which were heard the quick breathing of Vinicius,
  and the distant song of slaves at work in the garden.</p>

  <p>Only after a while did the Greek resume his speech, when he noticed that
  the young patrician was somewhat pacified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Death passed me, but I looked on it with the calmness of Socrates.
  No, lord, I have not said that I refuse to search for the maiden; I desired
  merely to tell thee that search for her is connected now with great peril to
  me. On a time thou didst doubt that there was a certain Euricius in the
  world, and though thou wert convinced by thine own eyes that the son of my
  father told the truth to thee, thou hast suspicions now that I have invented
  Glaucus. Ah! would that he were only a fiction, that I might go among the
  Christians with perfect safety, as I went some time since; I would give up
  for that the poor old slave woman whom I bought, three days since, to care
  for my advanced age and maimed condition. But Glaucus is living, lord; and if
  he had seen me once, thou wouldst not have seen me again, and in that case
  who would find the maiden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he was silent again, and began to dry his tears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But while Glaucus lives,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;how can I
  search for her?&mdash;for I may meet him at any step; and if I meet him I
  shall perish, and with me will cease all my searching.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What art thou aiming at? What help is there? What dost thou wish to
  undertake?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aristotle teaches us, lord, that less things should be sacrificed
  for greater, and King Priam said frequently that old age was a grievous
  burden. Indeed, the burden of old age and misfortune weighs upon Glaucus this
  long time, and so heavily that death would be to him a benefit. For what is
  death, according to Seneca, but liberation?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Play the fool with Petronius, not with me! Tell what thy desire
  is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If virtue is folly, may the gods permit me to be a fool all my
  life. I desire, lord, to set aside Glaucus, for while he is living my life
  and searches are in continual peril.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hire men to beat him to death with clubs; I will pay
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They will rob thee, lord, and afterward make profit of the secret.
  There are as many ruffians in Rome as grains of sand in the arena, but thou
  wilt not believe how dear they are when an honest man needs to employ their
  villainy. No, worthy tribune! But if watchmen catch the murderers in the act?
  They would tell, beyond doubt, who hired them, and then thou wouldst have
  trouble. They will not point to me, for I shall not give my name. Thou art
  doing ill not to trust in me, for, setting aside my keenness, remember that
  there is a question of two other things,&mdash;of my life, and the reward
  which thou has promised me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much dost thou need?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A thousand sestertia, for turn attention to this, that I must find
  honest ruffians, men who when they have received earnest money, will not take
  it off without a trace. For good work there must be good pay! Something might
  be added, too, for my sake, to wipe away the tears which I shall shed out of
  pity for Glaucus. I take the gods to witness how I love him. If I receive a
  thousand sestertia to-day, two days hence his soul will be in Hades; and
  then, if souls preserve memory and the gift of thought, he will know for the
  first time how I loved him. I will find people this very day, and tell them
  that for each day of the life of Glaucus I will withhold one hundred
  sestertia. I have, besides, a certain idea, which seems to me
  infallible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius promised him once more the desired sum, forbidding him to mention
  Glaucus again; but asked what other news he brought, where he had been all
  the time, what he had seen, and what he had discovered. But Chilo was not
  able to tell much. He had been in two more houses of prayer,&mdash;had
  observed each person carefully, especially the women,&mdash;but had seen no
  one who resembled Lygia: the Christians, however, looked on him as one of
  their own sect, and, since he redeemed the son of Euricius, they honored him
  as a man following in the steps of &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; He had learned from
  them, also, that a great lawgiver of theirs, a certain Paul of Tarsus, was in
  Rome, imprisoned because of charges preferred by the Jews, and with this man
  he had resolved to become acquainted. But most of all was he pleased by
  this,&mdash;that the supreme priest of the whole sect, who had been
  Christ&rsquo;s disciple, and to whom Christ had confided government over the
  whole world of Christians, might arrive in Rome any moment. All the
  Christians desired evidently to see him, and hear his teachings. Some great
  meetings would follow, at which he, Chilo, would be present; and what is
  more, since it is easy to hide in the crowd, he would take Vinicius to those
  meetings. Then they would find Lygia certainly. If Glaucus were once set
  aside, it would not be connected even with great danger. As to revenge, the
  Christians, too, would revenge but in general they were peaceful people.</p>

  <p>Here Chilo began to relate, with a certain surprise, that he had never
  seen that they gave themselves up to debauchery, that they poisoned wells or
  fountains, that they were enemies of the human race, worshipped an ass, or
  ate the flesh of children. No; he had seen nothing of that sort. Certainly he
  would find among them even people who would hide away Glaucus for money; but
  their religion, as far as he knew, did not incite to crime,&mdash;on the
  contrary, it enjoined forgiveness of offences.</p>

  <p>Vinicius remembered what Pomponia had said to him at Acte&rsquo;s, and in
  general he listened to Chilo&rsquo;s words with pleasure. Though his feeling
  for Lygia assumed at times the seeming of hatred, he felt a relief when he
  heard that the religion which she and Pomponia confessed was neither criminal
  nor repulsive. But a species of undefined feeling rose in him that it was
  just that reverence for Christ, unknown and mysterious, which created the
  difference between himself and Lygia; hence he began at once to fear that
  religion and to hate it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For Chilo, it was really important to set aside Glaucus,
  who, though advanced in years, was by no means decrepit. There was
  considerable truth in what Chilo had narrated to Vinicius. He had known
  Glaucus on a time, he had betrayed him, sold him to robbers, deprived him of
  family, of property, and delivered him to murder. But he bore the memory of
  these events easily, for he had thrown the man aside dying, not at an inn,
  but in a field near Minturna. This one thing he had not foreseen, that
  Glaucus would be cured of his wounds and come to Rome. When he saw him,
  therefore, in the house of prayer, he was in truth terrified, and at the
  first moment wished to discontinue the search for Lygia. But on the other
  hand, Vinicius terrified him still more. He understood that he must choose
  between the fear of Glaucus, and the pursuit and vengeance of a powerful
  patrician, to whose aid would come, beyond doubt, another and still greater,
  Petronius. In view of this, Chilo ceased to hesitate. He thought it better to
  have small enemies than great ones, and, though his cowardly nature trembled
  somewhat at bloody methods, he saw the need of killing Glaucus through the
  aid of other hands.</p>

  <p>At present the only question with him was the choice of people, and to
  this he was turning that thought of which he had made mention to Vinicius.
  Spending his nights in wine-shops most frequently, and lodging in them, among
  men without a roof, without faith or honor, he could find persons easily to
  undertake any task, and still more easily others who, if they sniffed coin on
  his person, would begin, but when they had received earnest money, would
  extort the whole sum by threatening to deliver him to justice. Besides, for a
  certain time past Chilo had felt a repulsion for nakedness, for those
  disgusting and terrible figures lurking about suspected houses in the Subura
  or in the Trans-Tiber. Measuring everything with his own measure, and not
  having fathomed sufficiently the Christians or their religion, he judged that
  among them, too, he could find willing tools. Since they seemed more reliable
  than others, he resolved to turn to them and present the affair in such
  fashion that they would undertake it, not for money&rsquo;s sake merely, but
  through devotion.</p>

  <p>In view of this, he went in the evening to Euricius, whom he knew as
  devoted with whole soul to his person, and who, he was sure, would do all in
  his power to assist him. Naturally cautious, Chilo did not even dream of
  revealing his real intentions, which would be in clear opposition, moreover,
  to the faith which the old man had in his piety and virtue. He wished to find
  people who were ready for anything, and to talk with them of the affair only
  in such a way that, out of regard to themselves, they would guard it as an
  eternal secret.</p>

  <p>The old man Euricius, after the redemption of his son, hired one of those
  little shops so numerous near the Circus Maximus, in which were sold olives,
  beans, unleavened paste, and water sweetened with honey, to spectators coming
  to the Circus. Chilo found him at home arranging his shop; and when he had
  greeted him in Christ&rsquo;s name, he began to speak of the affair which had
  brought him. Since he had rendered them a service, he considered that they
  would pay him with gratitude. He needed two or three strong and courageous
  men, to ward off danger threatening not only him, but all Christians. He was
  poor, it was true, since he had given to Euricius almost all that he owned;
  still he would pay such men for their services if they would trust him and
  perform faithfully what he commanded.</p>

  <p>Euricius and his son Quartus listened to him as their benefactor almost on
  their knees. Both declared that they were ready themselves to do all that he
  asked of them, believing that a man so holy could not ask for deeds
  inconsistent with the teaching of Christ.</p>

  <p>Chilo assured them that that was true, and, raising his eyes to heaven, he
  seemed to be praying; in fact, he was thinking whether it would not be well
  to accept their proposal, which might save him a thousand sestertia. But
  after a moment of thought he rejected it. Euricius was an old man, perhaps
  not so much weighted by years as weakened by care and disease. Quartus was
  sixteen years of age. Chilo needed dexterous, and, above all, stalwart men.
  As to the thousand sestertia, he considered that&mdash;thanks to the plan
  which he had invented&mdash;he would be able in every case to spare a large
  part of it.</p>

  <p>They insisted for some time, but when he refused decisively they
  yielded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know the baker Demas,&rdquo; said Quartus, &ldquo;in whose mills
  slaves and hired men are employed. One of those hired men is so strong that
  he would take the place, not of two, but of four. I myself have seen him lift
  stones from the ground which four men could not stir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If that is a God-fearing man, who can sacrifice himself for the
  brotherhood, make me acquainted with him,&rdquo; said Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a Christian, lord,&rdquo; answered Quartus; &ldquo;nearly all
  who work for Demas are Christians. He has night as well as day laborers; this
  man is of the night laborers. Were we to go now to the mill, we should find
  them at supper, and thou mightest speak to him freely. Demas lives near the
  Emporium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo consented most willingly. The Emporium was at the foot of the
  Aventine, hence not very far from the Circus Maximus. It was possible,
  without going around the hill, to pass along the river through the Porticus
  Æmilia, which would shorten the road considerably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am old,&rdquo; said Chilo, when they went under the Colonnade;
  &ldquo;at times I suffer effacement of memory. Yes, though our Christ was
  betrayed by one of his disciples, the name of the traitor I cannot recall at
  this moment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Judas, lord, who hanged himself,&rdquo; answered Quartus, wondering
  a little in his soul how it was possible to forget that name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;Judas! I thank thee,&rdquo; said Chilo.</p>

  <p>And they went on some time in silence. When they came to the Emporium,
  which was closed, they passed it, and going around the storehouse, from which
  grain was distributed to the populace, they turned toward the left, to houses
  which stretched along the Via Ostiensis, up to the Mons Testaceus and the
  Forum Pistorium. There they halted before a wooden building, from the
  interior of which came the noise of millstones. Quartus went in; but Chilo,
  who did not like to show himself to large numbers of people, and was in
  continual dread that some fate might bring him to meet Glaucus, remained
  outside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am curious about that Hercules who serves in a mill,&rdquo; said
  he to himself, looking at the brightly shining moon. &ldquo;If he is a
  scoundrel and a wise man, he will cost me something; if a virtuous Christian
  and dull, he will do what I want without money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Further meditation was interrupted by the return of Quartus, who issued
  from the building with a second man, wearing only a tunic called
  &ldquo;exomis,&rdquo; cut in such fashion that the right arm and right breast
  were exposed. Such garments, since they left perfect freedom of movement,
  were used especially by laborers. Chilo, when he saw the man coming, drew a
  breath of satisfaction, for he had not seen in his life such an arm and such
  a breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here, lord,&rdquo; said Quartus, &ldquo;is the brother whom it was
  thy wish to see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May the peace of Christ be with thee!&rdquo; answered Chilo.
  &ldquo;Do thou, Quartus, tell this brother whether I deserve faith and trust,
  and then return in the name of God; for there is no need that thy gray-haired
  father should be left in loneliness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a holy man,&rdquo; said Quartus, &ldquo;who gave all his
  property to redeem me from slavery,&mdash;me, a man unknown to him. May our
  Lord the Saviour prepare him a heavenly reward therefor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The gigantic laborer, hearing this, bent down and kissed Chilo&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is thy name, brother?&rdquo; inquired the Greek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At holy baptism, father, the name Urban was given me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Urban, my brother, hast thou time to talk with me
  freely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our work begins at midnight, and only now are they preparing our
  supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there is time sufficient. Let us go to the river; there thou
  wilt hear my words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went, and sat on the embankment, in a silence broken only by the
  distant sound of the millstones and the plash of the onflowing river. Chilo
  looked into the face of the laborer, which, notwithstanding a somewhat severe
  and sad expression, such as was usual on faces of barbarians living in Rome,
  seemed to him kind and honest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a good-natured, dull man who will kill Glaucus for
  nothing,&rdquo; thought Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Urban,&rdquo; inquired he then, &ldquo;dost thou love
  Christ?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love him from the soul of my heart,&rdquo; said the laborer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thy brethren and sisters, and those who taught thee truth and
  faith in Christ?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love them, too, father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then may peace be with thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And with thee, father!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again silence set in, but in the distance the millstones were roaring, and
  the river was plashing below the two men.</p>

  <p>Chilo looked with fixed gaze into the clear moonlight, and with a slow,
  restrained voice began to speak of Christ&rsquo;s death. He seemed not as
  speaking to Urban, but as if recalling to himself that death, or some secret
  which he was confiding to the drowsy city. There was in this, too, something
  touching as well as impressive. The laborer wept; and when Chilo began to
  groan and complain that in the moment of the Saviour&rsquo;s passion there
  was no one to defend him, if not from crucifixion, at least from the insults
  of Jews and soldiers, the gigantic fists of the barbarian began to squeeze
  from pity and suppressed rage. The death only moved him; but at thought of
  that rabble reviling the Lamb nailed to the cross, the simple soul in him was
  indignant, and a wild desire of vengeance seized the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Urban, dost thou know who Judas was?&rdquo; asked Chilo,
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&mdash;but he hanged himself!&rdquo; exclaimed the
  laborer.</p>

  <p>And in his voice there was a kind of sorrow that the traitor had meted out
  punishment to himself, and that Judas could not fall into his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if he had not hanged himself,&rdquo; continued Chilo,
  &ldquo;and if some Christian were to meet him on land or on sea, would it not
  be the duty of that Christian to take revenge for the torment, the blood, and
  the death of the Saviour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is there who would not take revenge, father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace be with thee, faithful servant of the Lamb! True, it is
  permitted to forgive wrongs done ourselves; but who has the right to forgive
  a wrong done to God? But as a serpent engenders a serpent, as malice breeds
  malice, and treason breeds treason, so from the poison of Judas another
  traitor has come; and as that one delivered to Jews and Roman soldiers the
  Saviour, so this man who lives among us intends to give Christ&rsquo;s sheep
  to the wolves; and if no one will anticipate the treason, if no one will
  crush the head of the serpent in time, destruction is waiting for us all, and
  with us will perish the honor of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The laborer looked at Chilo with immense alarm, as if not understanding
  what he had heard. But the Greek, covering his head with a corner of his
  mantle, began to repeat, with a voice coming as if from beneath the
  earth,&mdash;&ldquo;Woe to you, servants of the true God! woe to you,
  Christian men and Christian women!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And again came silence, again were heard only the roar of the millstones,
  the deep song of the millers, and the sound of the river.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; asked the laborer at last, &ldquo;what kind of
  traitor is that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo dropped his head. &ldquo;What kind of traitor? A son of Judas, a son
  of his poison, a man who pretends to be a Christian, and goes to houses of
  prayer only to complain of the brotherhood to Cæsar,&mdash;declaring that
  they will not recognize Cæsar as a god; that they poison fountains, murder
  children, and wish to destroy the city, so that one stone may not remain on
  another. Behold! in a few days a command will be given to the pretorians to
  cast old men, women, and children into prison, and lead them to death, just
  as they led to death the slaves of Pedanius Secundus. All this has been done
  by that second Judas. But if no one punished the first Judas, if no one took
  vengeance on him, if no one defended Christ in the hour of torment, who will
  punish this one, who will destroy the serpent before Cæsar hears him, who
  will destroy him, who will defend from destruction our brothers in the faith
  of Christ?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Urban, who had been sitting thus far on a stone, stood up on a sudden, and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;I will, father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo rose also; he looked for a while on the face of the laborer, lighted
  up by the shining of the moon, then, stretching his arm, he put his hand
  slowly on his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go among Christians,&rdquo; said he, with solemnity; &ldquo;go to
  the houses of prayer, and ask the brethren about Glaucus; and when they show
  him to thee, slay him at once in Christ&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About Glaucus?&rdquo; repeated the laborer, as if wishing to fix
  that name in his memory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I do not. There are thousands of Christians in Rome, and they
  are not all known to one another. But to-morrow, in Ostrianum, brethren and
  sisters will assemble in the night to the last soul, because a great apostle
  of Christ has come, who will teach them, and the brethren will point out to
  me Glaucus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Ostrianum?&rdquo; inquired Chilo. &ldquo;But that is outside the
  city gates! The brethren and all the sisters,&mdash;at night? Outside the
  city gates, in Ostrianum?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father; that is our cemetery, between the Viæ Salaria and
  Nomentana. Is it not known to thee that the Great Apostle will teach
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been two days from home, hence I did not receive his
  epistle; and I do not know where Ostrianum is, for I came here not long since
  from Corinth, where I govern a Christian community. But it is as thou
  sayest,&mdash;there thou wilt find Glaucus among the brethren, and thou wilt
  slay him on the way home to the city. For this all thy sins will be forgiven.
  And now peace be with thee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I listen to thee, servant of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the laborer&rsquo;s face perplexity was evident. Not long before he had
  killed a man, and perhaps two, but the teaching of Christ forbids killing. He
  had not killed them in his own defence, for even that is not permitted. He
  had not killed them, Christ preserve! for profit. The bishop himself had
  given him brethren to assist, but had not permitted him to kill; he had
  killed inadvertently, for God had punished him with too much strength. And
  now he was doing grievous penance. Others sing when the millstones are
  grinding; but he, hapless man, is thinking of his sin, of his offence against
  the Lamb. How much has he prayed already and wept? How much has he implored
  the Lamb? And he feels that he has not done penance enough yet! But now he
  has promised again to kill a traitor,&mdash;and done well! He is permitted to
  pardon only offences against himself; hence he will kill Glaucus, even before
  the eyes of all the brethren and sisters, in Ostrianum to-morrow. But let
  Glaucus be condemned previously by the elders among the brethren, by the
  bishop, or by the Apostle. To kill is not a great thing; to kill a traitor is
  even as pleasant as to kill a bear or a wolf. But suppose Glaucus to perish
  innocently? How take on his conscience a new murder, a new sin, a new offence
  against the Lamb?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no time for a trial, my son,&rdquo; said Chilo. &ldquo;The
  traitor will hurry from Ostrianum straightway to Cæsar in Antium, or hide in
  the house of a certain patrician whom he is serving. I will give thee a sign;
  if thou show it after the death of Glaucus, the bishop and the Great Apostle
  will bless thy deed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Saying this, he took out a small coin, and began to search for a knife at
  his belt; having found it, he scratched with the point on the sestertium the
  sign of the cross; this coin he gave to the laborer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here is the sentence of Glaucus, and a sign for thee. If thou show
  this to the bishop after the death of Glaucus, he will forgive thee the
  killing which thou hast done without wishing it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The laborer stretched out his hand involuntarily for the coin; but having
  the first murder too freshly in his memory just then, he experienced a
  feeling of terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he with a voice almost of entreaty, &ldquo;dost
  thou take this deed on thy conscience, and hast thou thyself heard Glaucus
  betraying his brethren?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo understood that he must give proofs, mention names, otherwise doubt
  might creep into the heart of the giant. All at once a happy thought flashed
  through his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Urban,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I dwell in Corinth, but I
  came from Kos; and here in Rome I instruct in the religion of Christ a
  certain serving maiden named Eunice. She serves as vestiplica in the house of
  a friend of Cæsar, a certain Petronius. In that house I have heard how
  Glaucus has undertaken to betray all the Christians; and, besides, he has
  promised another informer of Cæsar&rsquo;s, Vinicius, to find a certain
  maiden for him among the Christians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he stopped and looked with amazement at the laborer, whose eyes
  blazed suddenly like the eyes of a wild beast, and his face took on an
  expression of mad rage and threat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter with thee?&rdquo; asked Chilo, almost in
  fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, father; to-morrow I will kill Glaucus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek was silent. After a while he took the arm of the laborer, turned
  him so that the light of the moon struck his face squarely, and examined him
  with care. It was evident that he was wavering in spirit whether to inquire
  further and bring everything out with clearness, or for that time to stop
  with what he had learned or surmised.</p>

  <p>At last, however, his innate caution prevailed. He breathed deeply once
  and a second time; then, placing his hand on the laborer&rsquo;s head again,
  he asked, in an emphatic and solemn voice,&mdash;&ldquo;But in holy baptism
  the name Urban was given thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was, father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then peace be with thee, Urban!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Petronius</i> to <i>Vinicius</i>:</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Thy case is a bad one, carissime. It is clear that
Venus has
  disturbed thy mind, deprived thee of reason and memory, as well as the power
  to think of aught else except love. Read some time thy answer to my letter,
  and thou wilt see how indifferent thy mind is to all except Lygia; how
  exclusively it is occupied with her, how it returns to her always, and
  circles above her, as a falcon above chosen prey. By Pollux! find her
  quickly, or that of thee which fire has not turned into ashes will become an
  Egyptian sphinx, which, enamored, as &rsquo;tis said, of pale Isis, grew deaf
  and indifferent to all things, waiting only for night, so as to gaze with
  stony eyes at the loved one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Run disguised through the city in the evening, even honor Christian
  houses of prayer in thy philosopher&rsquo;s company. Whatever excites hope
  and kills time is praiseworthy. But for my friendship&rsquo;s sake do this
  one thing: Ursus, Lygia&rsquo;s slave, is a man of uncommon strength very
  likely; hire Croton, and go out three together; that will be safer and wiser.
  The Christians, since Pomponia and Lygia belong to them, are surely not such
  scoundrels as most people imagine. But when a lamb of their flock is in
  question they are no triflers, as they have shown by carrying away Lygia.
  When thou seest Lygia thou wilt not restrain thyself, I am sure, and wilt try
  to bear her away on the spot. But how wilt thou and Chilonides do it? Croton
  would take care of himself, even though ten like Ursus defended the maiden.
  Be not plundered by Chilo, but be not sparing of money on Croton. Of all
  counsels which I can give this is the best one.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Here they have ceased to speak of the infant Augusta, or to say
  that she perished through witchcraft. Poppæa mentions her at times yet; but
  Cæsar&rsquo;s mind is stuffed with something else. Moreover, if it be true
  that the divine Augusta is in a changed state again, the memory of that child
  will be blown away without trace. We have been in Naples for some days, or
  rather in Baiæ. If thou art capable of any thought, echoes of our life must
  strike thy ear, for surely Rome talks of naught else. We went directly to
  Baiæ, where at first memories of the mother attacked us, and reproaches of
  conscience. But dost thou know to what Ahenobarbus has gone already? To this,
  that for him even the murder of his mother is a mere theme for verses, and a
  reason for buffoonish tragic scenes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Formerly he felt real reproaches only in so far as he was a coward;
  now, when he is convinced that the earth is under his feet as before, and
  that no god is taking vengeance, he feigns them only to move people by his
  fate. He springs up at night sometimes declaring that the Furies are hunting
  him; he rouses us, looks around, assumes the posture of an actor playing the
  role of Orestes, and the posture of a bad actor too; he declaims Greek
  verses, and looks to see if we are admiring him. We admire him apparently;
  and instead of saying to him, Go to sleep, thou buffoon! we bring ourselves
  also to the tone of tragedy, and protect the great artist from the Furies. By
  Castor! this news at least must have reached thee, that he has appeared in
  public at Naples. They drove in from the city and the surrounding towns all
  the Greek ruffians, who filled the arena with such a vile odor of sweat and
  garlic that I thank the gods that, instead of sitting in the first rows with
  the Augustians, I was behind the scenes with Ahenobarbus. And wilt thou
  believe it, he was afraid really! He took my hand and put it to his heart,
  which was beating with increased pulsation; his breath was short; and at the
  moment when he had to appear he grew as pale as a parchment, and his forehead
  was covered with drops of sweat. Still he saw that in every row of seats were
  pretorians, armed with clubs, to rouse enthusiasm if the need came. But there
  was no need. No herd of monkeys from the environs of Carthage could howl as
  did this rabble. I tell thee that the smell of garlic came to the stage; but
  Nero bowed, pressed his hand to his heart, sent kisses from his lips, and
  shed tears. Then he rushed in among us, who were waiting behind the scenes,
  like a drunken man, crying, &rsquo;What were the triumphs of Julius compared
  with this triumph of mine?&rsquo; But the rabble was howling yet and
  applauding, knowing that it would applaud to itself favors, gifts, banquets,
  lottery tickets, and a fresh exhibition by the Imperial buffoon. I do not
  wonder that they applauded, for such a sight had not been seen till that
  evening. And every moment he repeated: &lsquo;See what the Greeks are! see
  what the Greeks are!&rsquo; From that evening it has seemed to me that his
  hatred for Rome is increasing. Meanwhile special couriers were hurried to
  Rome announcing the triumph, and we expect thanks from the Senate one of
  these days. Immediately after Nero&rsquo;s first exhibition, a strange event
  happened here. The theatre fell in on a sudden, but just after the audience
  had gone. I was there, and did not see even one corpse taken from the ruins.
  Many, even among the Greeks, see in this event the anger of the gods, because
  the dignity of Cæsar was disgraced; he, on the contrary, finds in it favor of
  the gods, who have his song, and those who listen to it, under their evident
  protection. Hence there are offerings in all the temples, and great thanks.
  For Nero it is a great encouragement to make the journey to Achæa. A few days
  since he told me, however, that he had doubts as to what the Roman people
  might say; that they might revolt out of love for him, and fear touching the
  distribution of grain and touching the games, which might fail them in case
  of his prolonged absence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are going, however, to Beneventum to look at the cobbler
  magnificence which Vatinius will exhibit, and thence to Greece, under the
  protection of the divine brothers of Helen. As to me, I have noted one thing,
  that when a man is among the mad he grows mad himself, and, what is more,
  finds a certain charm in mad pranks. Greece and the journey in a thousand
  ships; a kind of triumphal advance of Bacchus among nymphs and bacchantes
  crowned with myrtle, vine, and honeysuckle; there will be women in tiger
  skins harnessed to chariots; flowers, thyrses, garlands, shouts of
  &lsquo;Evoe!&rsquo; music, poetry, and applauding Hellas. All this is well;
  but we cherish besides more daring projects. We wish to create a species of
  Oriental Imperium,&mdash;an empire of palm-trees, sunshine, poetry, and
  reality turned into a dream, reality turned into the delight of life only. We
  want to forget Rome; to fix the balancing point of the world somewhere
  between Greece, Asia, and Egypt; to live the life not of men but of gods; not
  to know what commonness is; to wander in golden galleys under the shadow of
  purple sails along the Archipelago; to be Apollo, Osiris, and Baal in one
  person; to be rosy with the dawn, golden with the sun, silver with the moon;
  to command, to sing, to dream. And wilt thou believe that I, who have still
  sound judgment to the value of a sestertium, and sense to the value of an as,
  let myself be borne away by these fantasies, and I do this for the reason
  that, if they are not possible, they are at least grandiose and uncommon?
  Such a fabulous empire would be a thing which, some time or other, after long
  ages, would seem a dream to mankind. Except when Venus takes the form of
  Lygia, or even of a slave Eunice, or when art beautifies it, life itself is
  empty, and many a time it has the face of a monkey. But Bronzebeard will not
  realize his plans, even for this cause, that in his fabulous kingdom of
  poetry and the Orient no place is given to treason, meanness, and death; and
  that in him with the poses of a poet sits a wretched comedian, a dull
  charioteer, and a frivolous tyrant. Meanwhile we are killing people whenever
  they displease us in any way. Poor Torquatus Silanus is now a shade; he
  opened his veins a few days since. Lecanius and Licinus will enter on the
  consulate with terror. Old Thrasea will not escape death, for he dares to be
  honest. Tigellinus is not able yet to frame a command for me to open my
  veins. I am still needed not only as elegantiæ arbiter, but as a man without
  whose counsel and taste the expedition to Achæa might fail. More than once,
  however, I think that sooner or later it must end in opening my veins; and
  knowest thou what the question will be then with me?&mdash;that Bronzebeard
  should not get my goblet, which thou knowest and admirest. Shouldst thou be
  near at the moment of my death, I will give it to thee; shouldst thou be at a
  distance, I will break it. But meanwhile I have before me yet Beneventum of
  the cobblers and Olympian Greece; I have Fate too, which, unknown and
  unforeseen, points out the road to every one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be well, and engage Croton; otherwise they will snatch Lygia from
  thee a second time. When Chilonides ceases to be needful, send him to me
  wherever I may be. Perhaps I shall make him a second Vatinius, and consuls
  and senators may tremble before him yet, as they trembled before that knight
  Dratevka. It would be worth while to live to see such a spectacle. When thou
  hast found Lygia, let me know, so that I may offer for you both a pair of
  swans and a pair of doves in the round temple of Venus here. Once I saw Lygia
  in a dream, sitting on thy knee, seeking thy kisses. Try to make that dream
  prophetic. May there be no clouds on thy sky; or if there be, let them have
  the color and the odor of roses! Be in good health; and farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="first">Barely had Vinicius finished reading when Chilo pushed

  <p>Chilo raised his head and said, &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young patrician was so excited that for a long time he could not utter
  a word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou seen her?&rdquo; asked he, at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seen Ursus, lord, and have spoken with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know where they are secreted?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord. Another, through boastfulness, would have let the Lygian
  know that he divined who he was; another would have tried to extort from him
  the knowledge of where he lived, and would have received either a stroke of
  the fist,&mdash;after which all earthly affairs would have become indifferent
  to him,&mdash;or he would have roused the suspicion of the giant and caused
  this,&mdash;that a new hiding-place would be found for the girl, this very
  night perhaps. I did not act thus. It suffices me to know that Ursus works
  near the Emporium, for a miller named Demas, the same name as that borne by
  thy freedman; now any trusted slave of thine may go in the morning on his
  track, and discover their hiding place. I bring thee merely the assurance
  that, since Ursus is here, the divine Lygia also is in Rome, and a second
  news that she will be in Ostrianum to-night, almost
  certainly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Ostrianum? Where is that?&rdquo; interrupted Vinicius, wishing
  evidently to run to the place indicated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An old hypogeum between the Viæ Salaria and Nomentana. That
  pontifex maximus of the Christians, of whom I spoke to thee, and whom they
  expected somewhat later, has come, and to-night he will teach and baptize in
  that cemetery. They hide their religion, for, though there are no edicts to
  prohibit it as yet, the people hate them, so they must be careful. Ursus
  himself told me that all, to the last soul, would be in Ostrianum to-night,
  for every one wishes to see and hear him who was the foremost disciple of
  Christ, and whom they call Apostle. Since among them women hear instruction
  as well as men, Pomponia alone perhaps of women will not be there; she could
  not explain to Aulus, a worshipper of the ancient gods, her absence from home
  at night. But Lygia, lord, who is under the care of Ursus and the Christian
  elders, will go undoubtedly with other women.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who had lived hitherto in a fever, and upheld as it were, by
  hope alone, now that his hope seemed fulfilled felt all at once the weakness
  that a man feels after a journey which has proved beyond his strength. Chilo
  noticed this, and resolved to make use of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gates are watched, it is true, by thy people, and the
  Christians must know that. But they do not need gates. The Tiber, too, does
  not need them; and though it is far from the river to those roads, it is
  worth while to walk one road more to see the &lsquo;Great Apostle.&rsquo;
  Moreover they may have a thousand ways of going beyond the walls, and I know
  that they have. In Ostrianum thou wilt find Lygia; and even should she not be
  there, which I will not admit, Ursus will be there, for he has promised to
  kill Glaucus. He told me himself that he would be there, and that he would
  kill him. Dost hear, noble tribune? Either thou wilt follow Ursus and learn
  where Lygia dwells, or thou wilt command thy people to seize him as a
  murderer, and, having him in thy hand, thou wilt make him confess where he
  has hidden Lygia. I have done my best! Another would have told thee that he
  had drunk ten cantars of the best wine with Ursus before he wormed the secret
  out of him; another would have told thee that he had lost a thousand
  sestertia to him in scriptoe duodecim, or that he had bought the intelligence
  for two thousand; I know that thou wouldst repay me doubly, but in spite of
  that, once in my life&mdash;I mean, as always in my life&mdash;I shall be
  honest, for I think, as the magnanimous Petronius says, that thy bounty
  exceeds all my hopes and expectations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who was a soldier and accustomed not only to take counsel of
  himself in all cases, but to act, was overcome by a momentary weakness and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou wilt not deceive thyself as to my liberality, but
  first thou wilt go with me to Ostrianum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I, to Ostrianum?&rdquo; inquired Chilo, who had not the least wish
  to go there. &ldquo;I, noble tribune, promised thee to point out Lygia, but I
  did not promise to take her away for thee. Think, lord, what would happen to
  me if that Lygian bear, when he had torn Glaucus to pieces, should convince
  himself straightway that he had torn him not altogether justly? Would he not
  look on me (of course without reason) as the cause of the accomplished
  murder? Remember, lord, that the greater philosopher a man is, the more
  difficult it is for him to answer the foolish questions of common people;
  what should I answer him were he to ask me why I calumniated Glaucus? But if
  thou suspect that I deceive thee, I say, pay me only when I point out the
  house in which Lygia lives; show me to-day only a part of thy liberality, so
  that if thou, lord (which may all the gods ward from thee), succumb to some
  accident, I shall not be entirely without recompense. Thy heart could not
  endure that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius went to a casket called &ldquo;area,&rdquo; standing on a marble
  pedestal, and, taking out a purse, threw it to Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are scrupula,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;when Lygia shall be in
  my house, thou wilt get the same full of aurei.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Chilo.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt receive food here,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;then thou
  mayest rest. Thou wilt not leave this house till evening, and when night
  falls thou wilt go with me to Ostrianum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fear and hesitation were reflected on the Greek&rsquo;s face for a time;
  but afterward he grew calm, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Who can oppose thee, lord!
  Receive these my words as of good omen, just as our great hero received words
  like them in the temple of Ammon. As to me, these
  &lsquo;scruples&rsquo;&rdquo; (here he shook the purse) &ldquo;have
  outweighed mine, not to mention thy society, which for me is delight and
  happiness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius interrupted him impatiently, and asked for details of his
  conversation with Ursus. From them it seemed clear that either Lygia&rsquo;s
  hiding-place would be discovered that night, or he would be able to seize her
  on the road back from Ostrianum. At thought of this, Vinicius was borne away
  by wild delight. Now, when he felt clearly sure of finding Lygia, his anger
  against her, and his feeling of offence almost vanished. In return for that
  delight he forgave her every fault. He thought of her only as dear and
  desired, and he had the same impression as if she were returning after a long
  journey. He wished to summon his slaves and command them to deck the house
  with garlands. In that hour he had not a complaint against Ursus, even. He
  was ready to forgive all people everything. Chilo, for whom, in spite of his
  services, he had felt hitherto a certain repulsion, seemed to him for the
  first time an amusing and also an uncommon person. His house grew radiant;
  his eyes and his face became bright. He began again to feel youth and the
  pleasure of life. His former gloomy suffering had not given him yet a
  sufficient measure of how he loved Lygia. He understood this now for the
  first time, when he hoped to possess her. His desires woke in him, as the
  earth, warmed by the sun, wakes in spring; but his desires this time were
  less blind and wild, as it were, and more joyous and tender. He felt also
  within himself energy without bounds, and was convinced that should he but
  see Lygia with his own eyes, all the Christians on earth could not take her
  from him, nor could Cæsar himself.</p>

  <p>Chilo, emboldened by the young tribune&rsquo;s delight, regained power of
  speech and began to give advice. According to him, it behooved Vinicius not
  to look on the affair as won, and to observe the greatest caution, without
  which all their work might end in nothing. He implored Vinicius not to carry
  off Lygia from Ostrianum. They ought to go there with hoods on their heads,
  with their faces hidden, and restrict themselves to looking at all who were
  present from some dark corner. When they saw Lygia, it would be safest to
  follow her at a distance, see what house she entered, surround it next
  morning at daybreak, and take her away in open daylight. Since she was a
  hostage and belonged specially to Cæsar, they might do that without fear of
  law. In the event of not finding her in Ostrianum they could follow Ursus,
  and the result would be the same. To go to the cemetery with a crowd of
  attendants was impracticable,&mdash;that might draw attention to them easily;
  then the Christians need only put out the lights, as they did when she was
  intercepted, and scatter in the darkness, or betake themselves to places
  known to them only. But Vinicius and he should arm, and, still better, take a
  couple of strong, trusty men to defend them in case of need.</p>

  <p>Vinicius saw the perfect truth of what he said, and, recalling
  Petronius&rsquo;s counsel, commanded his slaves to bring Croton. Chilo, who
  knew every one in Rome, was set at rest notably when he heard the name of the
  famous athlete, whose superhuman strength in the arena he had wondered at
  more than once, and he declared that he would go to Ostrianum. The purse
  filled with great aurei seemed to him much easier of acquisition through the
  aid of Croton.</p>

  <p>Hence he sat down in good spirits at the table to which, after a time, he
  was called by the chief of the atrium.</p>

  </div>

  <p>While eating, he told the slaves that he had obtained for their master a
  miraculous ointment. The worst horse, if rubbed on the hoofs with it, would
  leave every other far behind. A certain Christian had taught him how to
  prepare that ointment, for the Christian elders were far more skilled in
  enchantment and miracles than even the Thessalians, though Thessaly was
  renowned for its witches. The Christians had immense confidence in
  him&mdash;why, any one easily understands who knows what a fish means. While
  speaking he looked sharply at the eyes of the slaves, in the hope of
  discovering a Christian among them and informing Vinicius. But when the hope
  failed him, he fell to eating and drinking uncommon quantities, not sparing
  praises on the cook, and declaring that he would endeavor to buy him of
  Vinicius. His joyfulness was dimmed only by the thought that at night he must
  go to Ostrianum. He comforted himself, however, as he would go in disguise,
  in darkness, and in the company of two men, one of whom was so strong that he
  was the idol of Rome; the other a patrician, a man of high dignity in the
  army. &ldquo;Even should they discover Vinicius,&rdquo; said he to himself,
  &ldquo;they will not dare to raise a hand on him; as to me, they will be wise
  if they see the tip of my nose even.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He fell then to recalling his conversation with the laborer; and the
  recollection of that filled him again with delight. He had not the least
  doubt that that laborer was Ursus. He knew of the uncommon strength of the
  man, from the narratives of Vinicius, and those who had brought Lygia from
  Cæsar&rsquo;s palace. When he inquired of Euricius touching men of
  exceptional strength, there was nothing remarkable in this, that they pointed
  out Ursus. Then the confusion and rage of the laborer at mention of Vinicius
  and Lygia left him no doubt that those persons concerned him particularly;
  the laborer had mentioned also his penance for killing a man,&mdash;Ursus had
  killed Atacinus; finally, the appearance of the laborer answered perfectly to
  the account which Vinicius had given of the Lygian. The change of name was
  all that could provoke doubt, but Chilo knew that frequently Christians took
  new names at baptism.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Should Ursus kill Glaucus,&rdquo; said Chilo to himself,
  &ldquo;that will be better still; but should he not kill him, that will be a
  good sign, for it will show how difficult it is for Christians to murder. I
  described Glaucus as a real son of Judas, and a traitor to all Christians; I
  was so eloquent that a stone would have been moved, and would have promised
  to fall on the head of Glaucus. Still I hardly moved that Lygian bear to put
  his paw on him. He hesitated, was unwilling, spoke of his penance and
  compunction. Evidently murder is not common among them. Offences against
  one&rsquo;s self must be forgiven, and there is not much freedom in taking
  revenge for others. Ergo, stop! think, Chilo, what can threaten thee? Glaucus
  is not free to avenge himself on thee. If Ursus will not kill Glaucus for
  such a great crime as the betrayal of all Christians, so much the more will
  he not kill thee for the small offence of betraying one Christian. Moreover,
  when I have once pointed out to this ardent wood-pigeon the nest of that
  turtle-dove, I will wash my hands of everything, and transfer myself to
  Naples. The Christians talk, also, of a kind of washing of the hands; that is
  evidently a method by which, if a man has an affair with them, he may finish
  it decisively. What good people these Christians are, and how ill men speak
  of them! O God! such is the justice of this world. But I love that religion,
  since it does not permit killing; but if it does not permit killing, it
  certainly does not permit stealing, deceit, or false testimony; hence I will
  not say that it is easy. It teaches, evidently, not only to die honestly, as
  the Stoics teach, but to live honestly also. If ever I have property and a
  house, like this, and slaves in such numbers as Vinicius, perhaps I shall be
  a Christian as long as may be convenient. For a rich man can permit himself
  everything, even virtue. This is a religion for the rich; hence I do not
  understand how there are so many poor among its adherents. What good is it
  for them, and why do they let virtue tie their hands? I must think over this
  sometime. Meanwhile praise to thee, Hermes! for helping me discover this
  badger. But if thou hast done so for the two white yearling heifers with
  gilded horns, I know thee not. Be ashamed, O slayer of Argos! such a wise god
  as thou, and not foresee that thou wilt get nothing! I will offer thee my
  gratitude; and if thou prefer two beasts to it, thou art the third beast
  thyself, and in the best event thou shouldst be a shepherd, not a god. Have a
  care, too, lest I, as a philosopher, prove to men that thou art non-
  existent, and then all will cease to bring thee offerings. It is safer to be
  on good terms with philosophers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Speaking thus to himself and to Hermes, he stretched on the sofa, put his
  mantle under his head, and was sleeping when the slave removed the dishes. He
  woke,&mdash;or rather they roused him,&mdash;only at the coming of Croton. He
  went to the atrium, then, and began to examine with pleasure the form of the
  trainer, an ex-gladiator, who seemed to fill the whole place with his
  immensity. Croton had stipulated as to the price of the trip, and was just
  speaking to Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Hercules! it is well, lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that thou
  hast sent to-day for me, since I shall start to-morrow for Beneventum,
  whither the noble Vatinius has summoned me to make a trial, in presence of
  Cæsar, of a certain Syphax, the most powerful negro that Africa has ever
  produced. Dost thou imagine, lord, how his spinal column will crack in my
  arms, or how besides I shall break his black jaw with my fist?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Pollux! Croton, I am sure that thou wilt do that,&rdquo;
  answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou wilt act excellently,&rdquo; added Chilo. &ldquo;Yes, to
  break his jaw, besides! That&rsquo;s a good idea, and a deed which befits
  thee. But rub thy limbs with olive oil to-day, my Hercules, and gird thyself,
  for know this, you mayst meet a real Cacus. The man who is guarding that girl
  in whom the worthy Vinicius takes interest, has exceptional strength very
  likely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo spoke thus only to rouse Croton&rsquo;s ambition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Vinicius; &ldquo;I have not seen him, but
  they tell me that he can take a bull by the horns and drag him wherever he
  pleases.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oi!&rdquo; exclaimed Chilo, who had not imagined that Ursus was so
  strong. But Croton laughed, from contempt. &ldquo;I undertake, worthy
  lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to bear away with this hand whomever thou shalt
  point out to me, and with this other defend myself against seven such
  Lygians, and bring the maiden to thy dwelling though all the Christians in
  Rome were pursuing me like Calabrian wolves. If not, I will let myself be
  beaten with clubs in this impluvium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not permit that, lord,&rdquo; cried Chilo. &ldquo;They will hurl
  stones at us, and what could his strength effect? Is it not better to take
  the girl from the house,&mdash;not expose thyself or her to
  destruction?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is true, Croton,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I receive thy money, I do thy will! But remember, lord, that to-
  morrow I go to Beneventum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have five hundred slaves in the city,&rdquo; answered
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>He gave them a sign to withdraw, went to the library himself, and sitting
  down wrote the following words to Petronius,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Lygian has been found by Chilo. I go this evening with him and
  Croton to Ostrianum, and shall carry her off from the house to-night or to-
  morrow. May the gods pour down on thee everything favorable. Be well, O
  carissime! for joy will not let me write further.&rdquo;</p>

  </div>

  <p>Laying aside the reed then, he began to walk with quick step; for besides
  delight, which was overflowing his soul, he was tormented with fever. He said
  to himself that to-morrow Lygia would be in that house. He did not know how
  to act with her, but felt that if she would love him he would be her servant.
  He recalled Acte&rsquo;s assurance that he had been loved, and that moved him
  to the uttermost. Hence it would be merely a question of conquering a certain
  maiden modesty, and a question of certain ceremonies which Christian teaching
  evidently commanded. But if that were true, Lygia, when once in his house,
  would yield to persuasion or superior force; she would have to say to
  herself, &ldquo;It has happened!&rdquo; and then she would be amiable and
  loving.</p>

  <p>But Chilo appeared and interrupted the course of these pleasant thoughts.
  &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the Greek, &ldquo;this is what has come to my head.
  Have not the Christians signs, &lsquo;passwords,&rsquo; without which no one
  will be admitted to Ostrianum? I know that it is so in houses of prayer, and
  I have received those passwords from Euricius; permit me then to go to him,
  lord, to ask precisely, and receive the needful signs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, noble sage,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, gladly; &ldquo;thou
  speakest as a man of forethought, and for that praise belongs to thee. Thou
  wit go, then, to Euricius, or whithersoever it may please thee; but as
  security thou wilt leave on this table here that purse which thou hast
  received from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo, who always parted with money unwillingly, squirmed; still he obeyed
  the command and went out. From the Carinæ to the Circus, near which was the
  little shop of Euricius, it was not very far; hence he returned considerably
  before evening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here are the signs, lord. Without them they would not admit us. I
  have inquired carefully about the road. I told Euricius that I needed the
  signs only for my friends; that I would not go myself, since it was too far
  for my advanced age; that, moreover, I should see the Great Apostle myself
  to-morrow, and he would repeat to me the choicest parts of his
  sermon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How! Thou wilt not be there? Thou must go!&rdquo; said
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that I must; but I will go well hooded, and I advise thee to
  go in like manner, or we may frighten the birds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact they began soon to prepare, for darkness had come on the world.
  They put on Gallic cloaks with hoods, and took lanterns; Vinicius, besides,
  armed himself and his companions with short, curved knives; Chilo put on a
  wig, which he obtained on the way from the old man&rsquo;s shop, and they
  went out, hurrying so as to reach the distant Nomentan Gate before it was
  closed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They went through the Vicus Patricius, along the Viminal to
  the former Viminal gate, near the plain on which Diocletian afterward built
  splendid baths. They passed the remains of the wall of Servius Tullius, and
  through places more and more deserted they reached the Via Nomentana; there,
  turning to the left, towards the Via Salaria, they found themselves among
  hills full of sand-pits, and here and there they found graveyards.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile it had grown dark completely, and since the moon had not risen
  yet, it would have been rather difficult for them to find the road were it
  not that the Christians themselves indicated it, as Chilo foresaw.</p>

  <p>In fact, on the right, on the left, and in front, dark forms were evident,
  making their way carefully toward sandy hollows. Some of these people carried
  lanterns,&mdash;covering them, however, as far as possible with mantles;
  others, knowing the road better, went in the dark. The trained military eye
  of Vinicius distinguished, by their movements, younger men from old ones, who
  walked with canes, and from women, wrapped carefully in long mantles. The
  highway police, and villagers leaving the city, took those night wanderers,
  evidently, for laborers, going to sand-pits; or grave-diggers, who at times
  celebrated ceremonies of their own in the night-time. In proportion, however,
  as the young patrician and his attendants pushed forward, more and more
  lanterns gleamed, and the number of persons grew greater. Some of them sang
  songs in low voices, which to Vinicius seemed filled with sadness. At moments
  a separate word or a phrase of the song struck his ear, as, for instance,
  &ldquo;Awake, thou that sleepest,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rise from the dead&rdquo;;
  at times, again, the name of Christ was repeated by men and women.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius turned slight attention to the words, for it came to his head
  that one of those dark forms might be Lygia. Some, passing near, said,
  &ldquo;Peace be with thee!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Glory be to Christ!&rdquo; but
  disquiet seized him, and his heart began to beat with more life, for it
  seemed to him that he heard Lygia&rsquo;s voice. Forms or movements like hers
  deceived him in the darkness every moment, and only when he had corrected
  mistakes made repeatedly did he begin to distrust his own eyes.</p>

  <p>The way seemed long to him. He knew the neighborhood exactly, but could
  not fix places in the darkness. Every moment they came to some narrow
  passage, or piece of wall, or booths, which he did not remember as being in
  the vicinity of the city. Finally the edge of the moon appeared from behind a
  mass of clouds, and lighted the place better than dim lanterns. Something
  from afar began at last to glimmer like a fire, or the flame of a torch.
  Vinicius turned to Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that Ostrianum?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>Chilo, on whom night, distance from the city, and those ghostlike forms
  made a deep impression, replied in a voice somewhat uncertain,&mdash;&ldquo;I
  know not, lord; I have never been in Ostrianum. But they might praise God in
  some spot nearer the city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a while, feeling the need of conversation, and of strengthening his
  courage, he added,&mdash;&ldquo;They come together like murderers; still they
  are not permitted to murder, unless that Lygian has deceived me
  shamefully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who was thinking of Lygia, was astonished also by the caution
  and mysteriousness with which her co-religionists assembled to hear their
  highest priest; hence he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Like all religions, this has its
  adherents in the midst of us; but the Christians are a Jewish sect. Why do
  they assemble here, when in the Trans-Tiber there are temples to which the
  Jews take their offerings in daylight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Jews, lord, are their bitterest enemies. I have heard that,
  before the present Cæsar&rsquo;s time, it came to war, almost, between Jews
  and Christians. Those outbreaks forced Claudius Cæsar to expell all the Jews,
  but at present that edict is abolished. The Christians, however, hide
  themselves from Jews, and from the populace, who, as is known to thee, accuse
  them of crimes and hate them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They walked on some time in silence, till Chilo, whose fear increased as
  he receded from the gates, said,&mdash;&ldquo;When returning from the shop of
  Euricius, I borrowed a wig from a barber, and have put two beans in my
  nostrils. They must not recognize me; but if they do, they will not kill me.
  They are not malignant! They are even very honest. I esteem and love
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not win them to thyself by premature praises,&rdquo; retorted
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>They went now into a narrow depression, closed, as it were, by two ditches
  on the side, over which an aqueduct was thrown in one place. The moon came
  out from behind clouds, and at the end of the depression they saw a wall,
  covered thickly with ivy, which looked silvery in the moonlight. That was
  Ostrianum.</p>

  <p>Vinicius&rsquo;s heart began to beat now with more vigor. At the gate two
  quarryrnen took the signs from them. In a moment Vinicius and his attendants
  were in a rather spacious place enclosed on all sides by a wall. Here and
  there were separate monuments, and in the centre was the entrance to the
  hypogeum itself, or crypt. In the lower part of the crypt, beneath the earth,
  were graves; before the entrance a fountain was playing. But it was evident
  that no very large number of persons could find room in the hypogeum; hence
  Vinicius divined without difficulty that the ceremony would take place
  outside, in the space where a very numerous throng was soon gathered.</p>

  <p>As far as the eye could reach, lantern gleamed near lantern, but many of
  those who came had no light whatever. With the exception of a few uncovered
  heads, all were hooded, from fear of treason or the cold; and the young
  patrician thought with alarm that, should they remain thus, he would not be
  able to recognize Lygia in that crowd and in the dim light.</p>

  <p>But all at once, near the crypt, some pitch torches were ignited and put
  into a little pile. There was more light. After a while the crowd began to
  sing a certain strange hymn, at first in a low voice, and then louder.
  Vinicius had never heard such a hymn before. The same yearning which had
  struck him in the hymns murmured by separate persons on the way to the
  cemetery, was heard now in that, but with far more distinctness and power;
  and at last it became as penetrating and immense as if together with the
  people, the whole cemetery, the hills, the pits, and the region about, had
  begun to yearn. It might seem, also, that there was in it a certain calling
  in the night, a certain humble prayer for rescue in wandering and
  darkness.</p>

  <p>Eyes turned upward seemed to see some one far above, there on high, and
  outstretched hands seemed to implore him to descend. When the hymn ceased,
  there followed a moment as it were of suspense,&mdash;so impressive that
  Vinicius and his companions looked unwittingly toward the stars, as if in
  dread that something uncommon would happen, and that some one would really
  descend to them.</p>

  <p>Vinicius had seen a multitude of temples of most various structure in Asia
  Minor, in Egypt, and in Rome itself; he had become acquainted with a
  multitude of religions, most varied in character, and had heard many hymns;
  but here, for the first time, he saw people calling on a divinity with
  hymns,&mdash;not to carry out a fixed ritual, but calling from the bottom of
  the heart, with the genuine yearning which children might feel for a father
  or a mother. One had to be blind not to see that those people not merely
  honored their God, but loved him with the whole soul. Vinicius had not seen
  the like, so far, in any land, during any ceremony, in any sanctuary; for in
  Rome and in Greece those who still rendered honor to the gods did so to gain
  aid for themselves or through fear; but it had not even entered any
  one&rsquo;s head to love those divinities.</p>

  <p>Though his mind was occupied with Lygia, and his attention with seeking
  her in the crowd, he could not avoid seeing those uncommon and wonderful
  things which were happening around him. Meanwhile a few more torches were
  thrown on the fire, which filled the cemetery with ruddy light and darkened
  the gleam of the lanterns. That moment an old man, wearing a hooded mantle
  but with a bare head, issued from the hypogeum. This man mounted a stone
  which lay near the fire.</p>

  <p>The crowd swayed before him. Voices near Vinicius whispered, &ldquo;Peter!
  Peter!&rdquo; Some knelt, others extended their hands toward him. There
  followed a silence so deep that one heard every charred particle that dropped
  from the torches, the distant rattle of wheels on the Via Nomentana, and the
  sound of wind through the few pines which grew close to the cemetery.</p>

  <p>Chilo bent toward Vinicius and whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;This is he! The
  foremost disciple of Christ-a fisherman!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man raised his hand, and with the sign of the cross blessed those
  present, who fell on their knees simultaneously. Vinicius and his attendants,
  not wishing to betray themselves, followed the example of others. The young
  man could not seize his impressions immediately, for it seemed to him that
  the form which he saw there before him was both simple and uncommon, and,
  what was more, the uncommonness flowed just from the simplicity. The old man
  had no mitre on his head, no garland of oak-leaves on his temples, no palm in
  his hand, no golden tablet on his breast, he wore no white robe embroidered
  with stars; in a word, he bore no insignia of the kind worn by
  priests&mdash;Oriental, Egyptian, or Greek&mdash;or by Roman flamens. And
  Vinicius was struck by that same difference again which he felt when
  listening to the Christian hymns; for that &ldquo;fisherman,&rdquo; too,
  seemed to him, not like some high priest skilled in ceremonial, but as it
  were a witness, simple, aged, and immensely venerable, who had journeyed from
  afar to relate a truth which he had seen, which he had touched, which he
  believed as he believed in existence, and he had come to love this truth
  precisely because he believed it. There was in his face, therefore, such a
  power of convincing as truth itself has. And Vinicius, who had been a
  sceptic, who did not wish to yield to the charm of the old man, yielded,
  however, to a certain feverish curiosity to know what would flow from the
  lips of that companion of the mysterious &ldquo;Christus,&rdquo; and what
  that teaching was of which Lygia and Pomponia Græcina were followers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Peter began to speak, and he spoke from the beginning like a
  father instructing his children and teaching them how to live. He enjoined on
  them to renounce excess and luxury, to love poverty, purity of life, and
  truth, to endure wrongs and persecutions patiently, to obey the government
  and those placed above them, to guard against treason, deceit, and calumny;
  finally, to give an example in their own society to each other, and even to
  pagans.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, for whom good was only that which could bring back to him Lygia,
  and evil everything which stood as a barrier between them, was touched and
  angered by certain of those counsels. It seemed to him that by enjoining
  purity and a struggle with desires the old man dared, not only to condemn his
  love, but to rouse Lygia against him and confirm her in opposition. He
  understood that if she were in the assembly listening to those words, and if
  she took them to heart, she must think of him as an enemy of that teaching
  and an outcast.</p>

  <p>Anger seized him at this thought. &ldquo;What have I heard that is
  new?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Is this the new religion? Every one knows
  this, every one has heard it. The Cynics enjoined poverty and a restriction
  of necessities; Socrates enjoined virtue as an old thing and a good one; the
  first Stoic one meets, even such a one as Seneca, who has five hundred tables
  of lemon-wood, praises moderation, enjoins truth, patience in adversity,
  endurance in misfortune,&mdash;and all that is like stale, mouse-eaten grain;
  but people do not wish to eat it because it smells of age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And besides anger, he had a feeling of disappointment, for he expected the
  discovery of unknown, magic secrets of some kind, and thought that at least
  he would hear a rhetor astonishing by his eloquence; meanwhile he heard only
  words which were immensely simple, devoid of every ornament. He was
  astonished only by the mute attention with which the crowd listened.</p>

  <p>But the old man spoke on to those people sunk in listening,&mdash;told
  them to be kind, poor, peaceful, just, and pure; not that they might have
  peace during life, but that they might live eternally with Christ after
  death, in such joy and such glory, in such health and delight, as no one on
  earth had attained at any time. And here Vinicius, though predisposed
  unfavorably, could not but notice that still there was a difference between
  the teaching of the old man and that of the Cynics, Stoics, and other
  philosophers; for they enjoin good and virtue as reasonable, and the only
  thing practical in life, while he promised immortality, and that not some
  kind of hapless immortality beneath the earth, in wretchedness, emptiness,
  and want, but a magnificent life, equal to that of the gods almost. He spoke
  meanwhile of it as of a thing perfectly certain; hence, in view of such a
  faith, virtue acquired a value simply measureless, and the misfortunes of
  this life became incomparably trivial. To suffer temporally for inexhaustible
  happiness is a thing absolutely different from suffering because such is the
  order of nature. But the old man said further that virtue and truth should be
  loved for themselves, since the highest eternal good and the virtue existing
  before ages is God; whoso therefore loves them loves God, and by that same
  becomes a cherished child of His.</p>

  <p>Vinicius did not understand this well, but he knew previously, from words
  spoken by Pomponia Græcina to Petronius, that, according to the belief of
  Christians, God was one and almighty; when, therefore, he heard now again
  that He is all good and all just, he thought involuntarily that, in presence
  of such a demiurge, Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, Juno, Vesta, and Venus would
  seem like some vain and noisy rabble, in which all were interfering at once,
  and each on his or her own account.</p>

  <p>But the greatest astonishment seized him when the old man declared that
  God was universal love also; hence he who loves man fulfils God&rsquo;s
  supreme command. But it is not enough to love men of one&rsquo;s own nation,
  for the God-man shed his blood for all, and found among pagans such elect of
  his as Cornelius the Centurion; it is not enough either to love those who do
  good to us, for Christ forgave the Jews who delivered him to death, and the
  Roman soldiers who nailed him to the cross, we should not only forgive but
  love those who injure us, and return them good for evil; it is not enough to
  love the good, we must love the wicked also, since by love alone is it
  possible to expel from them evil.</p>

  <p>Chilo at these words thought to himself that his work had gone for
  nothing, that never in the world would Ursus dare to kill Glaucus, either
  that night or any other night. But he comforted himself at once by another
  inference from the teaching of the old man; namely, that neither would
  Glaucus kill him, though he should discover and recognize him.</p>

  <p>Vinicius did not think now that there was nothing new in the words of the
  old man, but with amazement he asked himself: &ldquo;What kind of God is
  this, what kind of religion is this, and what kind of people are
  these?&rdquo; All that he had just heard could not find place in his head
  simply. For him all was an unheard-of medley of ideas. He felt that if he
  wished, for example, to follow that teaching, he would have to place on a
  burning pile all his thoughts, habits, and character, his whole nature up to
  that moment, burn them into ashes, and then fill himself with a life
  altogether different, and an entirely new soul. To him the science or the
  religion which commanded a Roman to love Parthians, Syrians, Greeks,
  Egyptians, Gauls, and Britons, to forgive enemies, to return them good for
  evil, and to love them, seemed madness. At the same time he had a feeling
  that in that madness itself there was something mightier than all
  philosophies so far. He thought that because of its madness it was
  impracticable, but because of its impracticability it was divine. In his soul
  he rejected it; but he felt that he was parting as if from a field full of
  spikenard, a kind of intoxicating incense; when a man has once breathed of
  this he must, as in the land of the lotus-eaters, forget all things else ever
  after, and yearn for it only.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that there was nothing real in that religion, but that
  reality in presence of it was so paltry that it deserved not the time for
  thought. Expanses of some kind, of which hitherto he had not had a suspicion,
  surrounded him,&mdash;certain immensities, certain clouds. That cemetery
  began to produce on him the impression of a meeting-place for madmen, but
  also of a place mysterious and awful, in which, as on a mystic bed, something
  was in progress of birth the like of which had not been in the world so far.
  He brought before his mind all that, which from the first moment of his
  speech, the old man had said touching life, truth, love, God; and his
  thoughts were dazed from the brightness, as the eyes are blinded from
  lightning flashes which follow each other unceasingly.</p>

  <p>As is usual with people for whom life has been turned into one single
  passion, Vinicius thought of all this through the medium of his love for
  Lygia; and in the light of those flashes he saw one thing distinctly, that if
  Lygia was in the cemetery, if she confessed that religion, obeyed and felt
  it, she never could and never would be his mistress.</p>

    Pompeii.</p>
  </div>

  <p>For the first time, then, since he had made her acquaintance at
  Aulus&rsquo;s, Vinicius felt that though now he had found her he would not
  get her. Nothing similar had come to his head so far, and he could not
  explain it to himself then, for that was not so much an express understanding
  as a dim feeling of irreparable loss and misfortune. There rose in him an
  alarm, which was turned soon into a storm of anger against the Christians in
  general, and against the old man in particular. That fisherman, whom at the
  first cast of the eye he considered a peasant, now filled him with fear
  almost, and seemed some mysterious power deciding his fate inexorably and
  therefore tragically.</p>

  <p>The quarrymen again, unobserved, added torches to the fire; the wind
  ceased to sound in the pines; the flame rose evenly, with a slender point
  toward the stars, which were twinkling in a clear sky. Having mentioned the
  death of Christ, the old man talked now of Him only. All held the breath in
  their breasts, and a silence set in which was deeper than the preceding one,
  so that it was possible almost to hear the beating of hearts. That man had
  seen! and he narrated as one in whose memory every moment had been fixed in
  such a way that were he to close his eyes he would see yet. He told,
  therefore, how on their return from the Cross he and John had sat two days
  and nights in the supper-chamber, neither sleeping nor eating, in suffering,
  in sorrow, in doubt, in alarm, holding their heads in their hands, and
  thinking that He had died. Oh, how grievous, how grievous that was! The third
  day had dawned and the light whitened the walls, but he and John were sitting
  in the chamber, without hope or comfort. How desire for sleep tortured them
  (for they had spent the night before the Passion without sleep)! They roused
  themselves then, and began again to lament. But barely had the sun risen when
  Mary of Magdala, panting, her hair dishevelled, rushed in with the cry,
  &ldquo;They have taken away the Lord!&rdquo; When they heard this, he and
  John sprang up and ran toward the sepulchre. But John, being younger, arrived
  first; he saw the place empty, and dared not enter. Only when there were
  three at the entrance did he, the person now speaking to them, enter, and
  find on the stone a shirt with a winding sheet; but the body he found
  not.</p>

  <p>Fear fell on them then, because they thought that the priests had borne
  away Christ, and both returned home in greater grief still. Other disciples
  came later and raised a lament, now in company, so that the Lord of Hosts
  might hear them more easily, and now separately and in turn. The spirit died
  within them, for they had hoped that the Master would redeem Israel, and it
  was now the third day since his death; hence they did not understand why the
  Father had deserted the Son, and they preferred not to look at the daylight,
  but to die, so grievous was the burden.</p>

  <p>The remembrance of those terrible moments pressed even then from the eyes
  of the old man two tears, which were visible by the light of the fire,
  coursing down his gray beard. His hairless and aged head was shaking, and the
  voice died in his breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That man is speaking the truth and is weeping over it,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius in his soul. Sorrow seized by the throat the simple-hearted
  listeners also. They had heard more than once of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings,
  and it was known to them that joy succeeded sorrow; but since an apostle who
  had seen it told this, they wrung their hands under the impression, and
  sobbed or beat their breasts.</p>

  <p>But they calmed themselves gradually, for the wish to hear more gained the
  mastery. The old man closed his eyes, as if to see distant things more
  distinctly in his soul, and continued,&mdash;&ldquo;When the disciples had
  lamented in this way, Mary of Magdala rushed in a second time, crying that
  she had seen the Lord. Unable to recognize him, she thought him the gardener:
  but He said, &lsquo;Mary!&rsquo; She cried &lsquo;Rabboni!&rsquo; and fell at
  his feet. He commanded her to go to the disciples, and vanished. But they,
  the disciples, did not believe her; and when she wept for joy, some upbraided
  her, some thought that sorrow had disturbed her mind, for she said, too, that
  she had seen angels at the grave, but they, running thither a second time,
  saw the grave empty. Later in the evening appeared Cleopas, who had come with
  another from Emmaus, and they returned quickly, saying: &lsquo;The Lord has
  indeed risen!&rsquo; And they discussed with closed doors, out of fear of the
  Jews. Meanwhile He stood among them, though the doors had made no sound, and
  when they feared, He said, &lsquo;Peace be with you!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I saw Him, as did all, and He was like light, and like the
  happiness of our hearts, for we believed that He had risen from the dead, and
  that the seas will dry and the mountains turn to dust, but His glory will not
  pass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After eight days Thomas Didymus put his finger in the Lord&rsquo;s
  wounds and touched His side; Thomas fell at His feet then, and cried,
  &rsquo;My Lord and my God!&rsquo; &rsquo;Because thou hast seen me thou hast
  believed; blessed are they who have not seen and have believed!&rsquo; said
  the Lord. And we heard those words, and our eyes looked at Him, for He was
  among us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius listened, and something wonderful took place in him. He forgot
  for a moment where he was; he began to lose the feeling of reality, of
  measure, of judgment. He stood in the presence of two impossibilities. He
  could not believe what the old man said; and he felt that it would be
  necessary either to be blind or renounce one&rsquo;s own reason, to admit
  that that man who said &ldquo;I saw&rdquo; was lying. There was something in
  his movements, in his tears, in his whole figure, and in the details of the
  events which he narrated, which made every suspicion impossible. To Vinicius
  it seemed at moments that he was dreaming. But round about he saw the silent
  throng; the odor of lanterns came to his nostrils; at a distance the torches
  were blazing; and before him on the stone stood an aged man near the grave,
  with a head trembling somewhat, who, while bearing witness, repeated,
  &ldquo;I saw!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he narrated to them everything up to the Ascension into heaven. At
  moments he rested, for he spoke very circumstantially; but it could be felt
  that each minute detail had fixed itself in his memory, as a thing is fixed
  in a stone into which it has been engraved. Those who listened to him were
  seized by ecstasy. They threw back their hoods to hear him better, and not
  lose a word of those which for them were priceless. It seemed to them that
  some superhuman power had borne them to Galilee; that they were walking with
  the disciples through those groves and on those waters; that the cemetery was
  turned into the lake of Tiberius; that on the bank, in the mist of morning,
  stood Christ, as he stood when John, looking from the boat, said, &ldquo;It
  is the Lord,&rdquo; and Peter cast himself in to swim, so as to fall the more
  quickly at the beloved feet. In the faces of those present were evident
  enthusiasm beyond bounds, oblivion of life, happiness, and love immeasurable.
  It was clear that during Peter&rsquo;s long narrative some of them had
  visions. When he began to tell how, at the moment of Ascension, the clouds
  closed in under the feet of the Saviour, covered Him, and hid Him from the
  eyes of the Apostles, all heads were raised toward the sky unconsciously, and
  a moment followed as it were of expectation, as if those people hoped to see
  Him or as if they hoped that He would descend again from the fields of
  heaven, and see how the old Apostle was feeding the sheep confided to him,
  and bless both the flock and him.</p>

  <p>Rome did not exist for those people, nor did the man Cæsar; there were no
  temples of pagan gods; there was only Christ, who filled the land, the sea,
  the heavens, and the world.</p>

  <p>At the houses scattered here and there along the Via Nomentana, the cocks
  began to crow, announcing midnight. At that moment Chilo pulled the corner of
  Vinicius&rsquo;s mantle and whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, I see Urban over
  there, not far from the old man, and with him is a maiden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius shook himself, as if out of a dream, and, turning in the
  direction indicated by the Greek, he saw Lygia.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Every drop of blood quivered in the young patrician at sight
  of her. He forgot the crowd, the old man, his own astonishment at the
  incomprehensible things which he had heard,&mdash;he saw only her. At last,
  after all his efforts, after long days of alarm, trouble, and suffering, he
  had found her! For the first time he realized that joy might rush at the
  heart, like a wild beast, and squeeze it till breath was lost. He, who had
  supposed hitherto that on &ldquo;Fortuna&rdquo; had been imposed a kind of
  duty to accomplish all his wishes, hardly believed his own eyes now and his
  own happiness. Were it not for that disbelief, his passionate nature might
  have urged him to some unconsidered step; but he wished to convince himself
  first that that was not the continuation of those miracles with which his
  head was filled, and that he was not dreaming. But there was no
  doubt,&mdash;he saw Lygia, and an interval of barely a few steps divided
  them. She stood in perfect light, so that he could rejoice in the sight of
  her as much as he liked. The hood had fallen from her head and dishevelled
  her hair; her mouth was open slightly, her eyes raised toward the Apostle,
  her face fixed in listening and delighted. She was dressed in a dark woollen
  mantle, like a daughter of the people, but never had Vinicius seen her more
  beautiful; and notwithstanding all the disorder which had risen in him, he
  was struck by the nobility of that wonderful patrician head in distinction to
  the dress, almost that of a slave. Love flew over him like a flame, immense,
  mixed with a marvellous feeling of yearning, homage, honor, and desire. He
  felt the delight which the sight of her caused him; he drank of her as of
  life-giving water after long thirst. Standing near the gigantic Lygian, she
  seemed to him smaller than before, almost a child; he noticed, too, that she
  had grown more slender. Her complexion had become almost transparent; she
  made on him the impression of a flower, and a spirit. But all the more did he
  desire to possess that woman, so different from all women whom he had seen or
  possessed in Rome or the Orient. He felt that for her he would have given
  them all, and with them Rome and the world in addition.</p>

  <p>He would have lost himself in gazing, and forgotten himself altogether,
  had it not been for Chilo, who pulled the corner of his mantle, out of fear
  that he might do something to expose them to danger. Meanwhile the Christians
  began to pray and sing. After a while Maranatha thundered forth, and then the
  Great Apostle baptized with water from the fountain those whom the presbyters
  presented as ready for baptism. It seemed to Vinicius that that night would
  never end. He wished now to follow Lygia as soon as possible, and seize her
  on the road or at her house.</p>

  <p>At last some began to leave the cemetery, and Chilo
  whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us go out before the gate, lord, we have not
  removed our hoods, and people look at us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Such was the case, for during the discourse of the Apostle all had cast
  aside their hoods so as to hear better, and they had not followed the general
  example. Chilo&rsquo;s advice seemed wise, therefore. Standing before the
  gate, they could look at all who passed; Ursus it was easy to recognize by
  his form and size.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us follow them,&rdquo; said Chilo; &ldquo;we shall see to what
  house they go. To-morrow, or rather to-day, thou wilt surround the entrances
  with slaves and take her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou wish to do, lord?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will follow her to the house and take her now, if thou wilt
  undertake that task, Croton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Croton, &ldquo;and I will give myself to
  thee as a slave if I do not break the back of that bison who is guarding
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Chilo fell to dissuading and entreating them by all the gods not to do
  so. Croton was taken only for defence against attack in case they were
  recognized, not to carry off the girl. To take her when there were only two
  of them was to expose themselves to death, and, what was worse, they might
  let her out of their hands, and then she would hide in another place or leave
  Rome. And what could they do? Why not act with certainty? Why expose
  themselves to destruction and the whole undertaking to failure?</p>

  <p>Though Vinicius restrained himself with the greatest effort from seizing
  Lygia in his arms at once, right there in the cemetery, he felt that the
  Greek was right, and would have lent ear, perhaps, to his counsels, had it
  not been for Croton, to whom reward was the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, command that old goat to be silent,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or
  let me drop my fist on his head. Once in Buxentum, whither Lucius Saturnius
  took me to a play, seven drunken gladiators fell on me at an inn, and none of
  them escaped with sound ribs. I do not say to take the girl now from the
  crowd, for they might throw stones before our feet, but once she is at home I
  will seize her, carry her away, and take her whithersoever thou shalt
  indicate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was pleased to hear those words, and answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Thus
  let it be, by Hercules! To-morrow we may not find her at home; if we surprise
  them they will remove the girl surely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This Lygian seems tremendously strong!&rdquo; groaned Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one will ask thee to hold his hands,&rdquo; answered Croton.</p>

  <p>But they had to wait long yet, and the cocks had begun to crow before dawn
  when they saw Ursus coming through the gate, and with him Lygia. They were
  accompanied by a number of other persons. It seemed to Chilo that he
  recognized among them the Great Apostle; next to him walked another old man,
  considerably lower in stature, two women who were not young, and a boy, who
  lighted the way with a lantern. After that handful followed a crowd, about
  two hundred in number; Vinicius, Chilo, and Croton walked with these
  people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, lord,&rdquo; said Chilo, &ldquo;thy maiden is under powerful
  protection. That is the Great Apostle with her, for see how passing people
  kneel to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>People did in fact kneel before him, but Vinicius did not look at them. He
  did not lose Lygia from his eyes for a moment; he thought only of bearing her
  away and, accustomed as he had been in wars to stratagems of all sorts, he
  arranged in his head the whole plan of seizure with soldierly precision. He
  felt that the step on which he had decided was bold, but he knew well that
  bold attacks give success generally.</p>

  <p>The way was long; hence at moments he thought too of the gulf which that
  wonderful religion had dug between him and Lygia. Now he understood
  everything that had happened in the past, and why it had happened. He was
  sufficiently penetrating for that. Lygia he had not known hitherto. He had
  seen in her a maiden wonderful beyond others, a maiden toward whom his
  feelings were inflamed: he knew now that her religion made her different from
  other women, and his hope that feeling, desire, wealth, luxury, would attract
  her he knew now to be a vain illusion. Finally he understood this, which he
  and Petronius had not understood, that the new religion ingrafted into the
  soul something unknown to that world in which he lived, and that Lygia, even
  if she loved him, would not sacrifice any of her Christian truths for his
  sake, and that, if pleasure existed for her, it was a pleasure different
  altogether from that which he and Petronius and Cæsar&rsquo;s court and all
  Rome were pursuing. Every other woman whom he knew might become his mistress,
  but that Christian would become only his victim. And when he thought of this,
  he felt anger and burning pain, for he felt that his anger was powerless. To
  carry off Lygia seemed to him possible; he was almost sure that he could take
  her, but he was equally sure that, in view of her religion, he himself with
  his bravery was nothing, that his power was nothing, and that through it he
  could effect nothing. That Roman military tribune, convinced that the power
  of the sword and the fist which had conquered the world, would command it
  forever, saw for the first time in life that beyond that power there might be
  something else; hence he asked himself with amazement what it was. And he
  could not answer distinctly; through his head flew merely pictures of the
  cemetery, the assembled crowd, and Lygia, listening with her whole soul to
  the words of the old man, as he narrated the passion, death, and resurrection
  of the God-man, who had redeemed the world, and promised it happiness on the
  other shore of the Styx.</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, chaos rose in his head. But he was brought out of
  this chaos by Chilo, who fell to lamenting his own fate. He had agreed to
  find Lygia. He had sought for her in peril of his life, and he had pointed
  her out. But what more do they want? Had he offered to carry the maiden away?
  Who could ask anything like this of a maimed man deprived of two fingers, an
  old man, devoted to meditation, to science, and virtue? What would happen
  were a lord of such dignity as Vinicius to meet some mishap while bearing the
  maiden away? It is true that the gods are bound to watch over their chosen
  ones,&mdash;but have not such things happened more than once, as if the gods
  were playing games instead of watching what was passing in the world? Fortune
  is blindfold, as is well known, and does not see even in daylight; what must
  the case be at night? Let something happen,&mdash;let that Lygian bear hurl a
  millstone at the noble Vinicius, or a keg of wine, or, still worse,
  water,&mdash;who will give assurance that instead of a reward blame will not
  fall on the hapless Chilo? He, the poor sage, has attached himself to the
  noble Vinicius as Aristotle to Alexander of Macedon. If the noble lord should
  give him at least that purse which he had thrust into his girdle before
  leaving home, there would be something with which to invoke aid in case of
  need, or to influence the Christians. Oh, why not listen to the counsels of
  an old man, counsels dictated by experience and prudence?</p>

  <p>Vinicius, hearing this, took the purse from his belt, and threw it to the
  fingers of Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast it; be silent!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek felt that it was unusually heavy, and gained confidence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My whole hope is in this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that Hercules or
  Theseus performed deeds still more arduous; what is my personal, nearest
  friend, Croton, if not Hercules? Thee, worthy lord, I will not call a
  demigod, for thou art a full god, and in future thou wilt not forget a poor,
  faithful servant, whose needs it will be necessary to provide for from time
  to time, for once he is sunk in books, he thinks of nothing else; some few
  stadia of garden land and a little house, even with the smallest portico, for
  coolness in summer, would befit such a donor. Meanwhile I shall admire thy
  heroic deeds from afar, and invoke Jove to befriend thee, and if need be I
  will make such an outcry that half Rome will be roused to thy assistance.
  What a wretched, rough road! The olive oil is burned out in the lantern; and
  if Croton, who is as noble as he is strong, would bear me to the gate in his
  arms, he would learn, to begin with, whether he will carry the maiden easily;
  second, he would act like Æneas, and win all the good gods to such a degree
  that touching the result of the enterprise I should be thoroughly
  satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should rather carry a sheep which died of mange a month
  ago,&rdquo; answered the gladiator; &ldquo;but give that purse, bestowed by
  the worthy tribune, and I will bear thee to the gate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mayst thou knock the great toe from thy foot,&rdquo; replied the
  Greek; &ldquo;what profit hast thou from the teachings of that worthy old
  man, who described poverty and charity as the two foremost virtues? Has he
  not commanded thee expressly to love me? Never shall I make thee, I see, even
  a poor Christian; it would be easier for the sun to pierce the walls of the
  Mamertine prison than for truth to penetrate thy skull of a
  hippopotamus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never fear!&rdquo; said Croton, who with the strength of a beast
  had no human feeling. &ldquo;I shall not be a Christian! I have no wish to
  lose my bread.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if thou knew even the rudiments of philosophy, thou wouldst
  know that gold is vanity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come to me with thy philosophy. I will give thee one blow of my
  head in the stomach; we shall see then who wins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An ox might have said the same to Aristotle,&rdquo; retorted
  Chilo.</p>

    <p class="caption">A Roman Maiden Waiting for Her Lover.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>It was growing gray in the world. The dawn covered with pale light the
  outlines of the walls. The trees along the wayside, the buildings, and the
  gravestones scattered here and there began to issue from the shade. The road
  was no longer quite empty. Marketmen were moving toward the gates, leading
  asses and mules laden with vegetables; here and there moved creaking carts in
  which game was conveyed. On the road and along both sides of it was a light
  mist at the very earth, which promised good weather. People at some distance
  seemed like apparitions in that mist. Vinicius stared at the slender form of
  Lygia, which became more silvery as the light increased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Chilo, &ldquo;I should offend thee were I to
  foresee the end of thy bounty, but now, when thou hast paid me, I may not be
  suspected of speaking for my own interest only. I advise thee once more to go
  home for slaves and a litter, when thou hast learned in what house the divine
  Lygia dwells; listen not to that elephant trunk, Croton, who undertakes to
  carry off the maiden only to squeeze thy purse as if it were a bag of
  curds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a blow of the fist to be struck between the shoulders, which
  means that thou wilt perish,&rdquo; said Croton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a cask of Cephalonian wine, which means that I shall be
  well,&rdquo; answered Chilo.</p>

  <p>Vinicius made no answer, for he approached the gate, at which a wonderful
  sight struck his eyes. Two soldiers knelt when the Apostle was passing; Peter
  placed his hand on their iron helmets for a moment, and then made the sign of
  the cross on them. It had never occurred to the patrician before that there
  could be Christians in the army; with astonishment he thought that as fire in
  a burning city takes in more and more houses, so to all appearances that
  doctrine embraces new souls every day, and extends itself over all human
  understandings. This struck him also with reference to Lygia, for he was
  convinced that, had she wished to flee from the city, there would be guards
  willing to facilitate her flight. He thanked the gods then that this had not
  happened.</p>

  <p>After they had passed vacant places beyond the wall, the Christians began
  to scatter. There was need, therefore, to follow Lygia more from a distance,
  and more carefully, so as not to rouse attention. Chilo fell to complaining
  of wounds, of pains in his legs, and dropped more and more to the rear.
  Vinicius did not oppose this, judging that the cowardly and incompetent Greek
  would not be needed. He would even have permitted him to depart, had he
  wished; but the worthy sage was detained by circumspection. Curiosity pressed
  him evidently, since he continued behind, and at moments even approached with
  his previous counsels; he thought too that the old man accompanying the
  Apostle might be Glaucus, were it not for his rather low stature.</p>

  <p>They walked a good while before reaching the Trans-Tiber, and the sun was
  near rising when the group surrounding Lygia dispersed. The Apostle, an old
  woman, and a boy went up the river; the old man of lower stature, Ursus, and
  Lygia entered a narrow vicus, and, advancing still about a hundred yards,
  went into a house in which were two shops,&mdash;one for the sale of olives,
  the other for poultry.</p>

  <p>Chilo, who walked about fifty yards behind Vinicius and Croton, halted all
  at once, as if fixed to the earth, and, squeezing up to the wall, began to
  hiss at them to turn.</p>

  <p>They did so, for they needed to take counsel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go, Chilo,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;and see if this house
  fronts on another street.&rdquo; Chilo, though he had complained of wounds in
  his feet, sprang away as quickly as if he had had the wings of Mercury on his
  ankles, and returned in a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is but one entrance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, putting his hands together, he said, &ldquo;I implore thee, lord, by
  Jupiter, Apollo, Vesta, Cybele, Isis, Osiris, Mithra Baal, and all the gods
  of the Orient and the Occident to drop this plan. Listen to
  me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he stopped on a sudden, for he saw that Vinicius&rsquo;s face was pale
  from emotion, and that his eyes were glittering like the eyes of a wolf. It
  was enough to look at him to understand that nothing in the world would
  restrain him from the undertaking. Croton began to draw air into his
  herculean breast, and to sway his undeveloped skull from side to side as
  bears do when confined in a cage, but on his face not the least fear was
  evident.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go in first,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt follow me,&rdquo; said Vinicius, in commanding tones.</p>

  <p>And after a while both vanished in the dark entrance.</p>

  <p>Chilo sprang to the corner of the nearest alley and watched from behind
  it, waiting for what would happen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Only inside the entrance did Vinicius comprehend the whole
  difficulty of the undertaking. The house was large, of several stories, one
  of the kind of which thousands were built in Rome, in view of profit from
  rent; hence, as a rule, they were built so hurriedly and badly that scarcely
  a year passed in which numbers of them did not fall on the heads of tenants.
  Real hives, too high and too narrow, full of chambers and little dens, in
  which poor people fixed themselves too numerously. In a city where many
  streets had no names, those houses had no numbers; the owners committed the
  collection of rent to slaves, who, not obliged by the city government to give
  names of occupants, were ignorant themselves of them frequently. To find some
  one by inquiry in such a house was often very difficult, especially when
  there was no gate- keeper.</p>

  <p>Vinicius and Croton came to a narrow, corridor-like passage walled in on
  four sides, forming a kind of common atrium for the whole house, with a
  fountain in the middle whose stream fell into a stone basin fixed in the
  ground. At all the walls were internal stairways, some of stone, some of
  wood, leading to galleries from which there were entrances to lodgings. There
  were lodgings on the ground, also; some provided with wooden doors, others
  separated from the yard by woollen screens only. These, for the greater part,
  were worn, rent, or patched.</p>

  <p>The hour was early, and there was not a living soul in the yard. It was
  evident that all were asleep in the house except those who had returned from
  Ostrianum.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What shall we do, lord?&rdquo; asked Croton, halting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us wait here; some one may appear,&rdquo; replied Vinicius.
  &ldquo;We should not be seen in the yard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this moment, he thought Chilo&rsquo;s counsel practical. If there were
  some tens of slaves present, it would be easy to occupy the gate, which
  seemed the only exit, search all the lodgings simultaneously, and thus come
  to Lygia&rsquo;s; otherwise Christians, who surely were not lacking in that
  house, might give notice that people were seeking her. In view of this, there
  was risk in inquiring of strangers. Vinicius stopped to think whether it
  would not be better to go for his slaves. Just then, from behind a screen
  hiding a remoter lodging, came a man with a sieve in his hand, and approached
  the fountain.</p>

  <p>At the first glance the young tribune recognized Ursus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is the Lygian!&rdquo; whispered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I to break his bones now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait awhile!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus did not notice the two men, as they were in the shadow of the
  entrance, and he began quietly to sink in water vegetables which filled the
  sieve. It was evident that, after a whole night spent in the cemetery, he
  intended to prepare a meal. After a while the washing was finished; he took
  the wet sieve and disappeared behind the screen. Croton and Vinicius followed
  him, thinking that they would come directly to Lygia&rsquo;s lodgings. Their
  astonishment was great when they saw that the screen divided from the court,
  not lodgings, but another dark corridor, at the end of which was a little
  garden containing a few cypresses, some myrtle bushes, and a small house
  fixed to the windowless stone wall of another stone building.</p>

  <p>Both understood at once that this was for them a favoring circumstance. In
  the courtyard all the tenants might assemble; the seclusion of the little
  house facilitated the enterprise. They would set aside defenders, or rather
  Ursus, quickly, and would reach the street just as quickly with the captured
  Lygia; and there they would help themselves. It was likely that no one would
  attack them; if attacked, they would say that a hostage was fleeing from
  Cæsar. Vinicius would declare himself then to the guards, and summon their
  assistance.</p>

  <p>Ursus was almost entering the little house, when the sound of steps
  attracted his attention; he halted, and, seeing two persons, put his sieve on
  the balustrade and turned to them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do ye want here?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thee!&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Then, turning to Croton, he said in a low, hurried voice:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kill!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Croton rushed at him like a tiger, and in one moment, before the Lygian
  was able to think or to recognize his enemies, Croton had caught him in his
  arms of steel.</p>

  <p>Vinicius was too confident in the man&rsquo;s preternatural strength to
  wait for the end of the struggle. He passed the two, sprang to the door of
  the little house, pushed it open and found himself in a room a trifle dark,
  lighted, however, by a fire burning in the chimney. A gleam of this fire fell
  on Lygia&rsquo;s face directly. A second person, sitting at the fire, was
  that old man who had accompanied the young girl and Ursus on the road from
  Ostrianum.</p>

  <p>Vinicius rushed in so suddenly that before Lygia could recognize him he
  had seized her by the waist, and, raising her, rushed toward the door again.
  The old man barred the way, it is true; but pressing the girl with one arm to
  his breast, Vinicius pushed him aside with the other, which was free. The
  hood fell from his head, and at sight of that face, which was known to her
  and which at that moment was terrible, the blood grew cold in Lygia from
  fright, and the voice died in her throat. She wished to summon aid, but had
  not the power. Equally vain was her wish to grasp the door, to resist. Her
  fingers slipped along the stone, and she would have fainted but for the
  terrible picture which struck her eyes when Vinicius rushed into the
  garden.</p>

  <p>Ursus was holding in his arms some man doubled back completely, with
  hanging head and mouth filled with blood. When he saw them, he struck the
  head once more with his fist, and in the twinkle of an eye sprang toward
  Vinicius like a raging wild beast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Death!&rdquo; thought the young patrician.</p>

  <p>Then he heard, as through a dream, the scream of Lygia, &ldquo;Kill
  not!&rdquo; He felt that something, as it were a thunderbolt, opened the arms
  with which he held Lygia; then the earth turned round with him, and the light
  of day died in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Chilo, hidden behind the angle of the corner house, was waiting for what
  would happen, since curiosity was struggling with fear in him. He thought
  that if they succeeded in carrying off Lygia, he would fare well near
  Vinicius. He feared Urban no longer, for he also felt certain that Croton
  would kill him. And he calculated that in case a gathering should begin on
  the streets, which so far were empty,&mdash;if Christians, or people of any
  kind, should offer resistance,&mdash;he, Chilo, would speak to them as one
  representing authority, as an executor of Cæsar&rsquo;s will, and if need
  came, call the guards to aid the young patrician against the street
  rabble&mdash;thus winning to himself fresh favor. In his soul he judged yet
  that the young tribune&rsquo;s method was unwise; considering, however,
  Croton&rsquo;s terrible strength, he admitted that it might succeed, and
  thought, &ldquo;If it go hard with him, Vinicius can carry the girl, and
  Croton clear the way.&rdquo; Delay grew wearisome, however; the silence of
  the entrance which he watched alarmed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they do not hit upon her hiding-place, and make an uproar, they
  will frighten her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But this thought was not disagreeable; for Chilo understood that in that
  event he would be necessary again to Vinicius, and could squeeze afresh a
  goodly number of sestertia from the tribune.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whatever they do,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;they will work
  for me, though no one divines that. O gods! O gods! only permit
  me-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he stopped suddenly, for it seemed to him that some one was bending
  forward through the entrance; then, squeezing up to the wall, he began to
  look, holding the breath in his breast.</p>

  <p>And he had not deceived himself, for a head thrust itself half out of the
  entrance and looked around. After a while, however, it vanished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is Vinicius, or Croton,&rdquo; thought Chilo; &ldquo;but if
  they have taken the girl, why does she not scream, and why are they looking
  out to the street? They must meet people anyhow, for before they reach the
  Carinæ there will be movement in the city&mdash;What is that? By the immortal
  gods!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And suddenly the remnant of his hair stood on end.</p>

  <p>In the door appeared Ursus, with the body of Croton hanging on his arm,
  and looking around once more, he began to run, bearing it along the empty
  street toward the river.</p>

  <p>Chilo made himself as flat against the wall as a bit of mud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am lost if he sees me!&rdquo; thought he.</p>

  <p>But Ursus ran past the corner quickly, and disappeared beyond the
  neighboring house. Chilo, without further waiting, his teeth chattering from
  terror, ran along the cross street with a speed which even in a young man
  might have roused admiration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he sees me from a distance when he is returning, he will catch
  and kill me,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;Save me, Zeus; save me,
  Apollo; save me, Hermes; save me, O God of the Christians! I will leave Rome,
  I will return to Mesembria, but save me from the hands of that
  demon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And that Lygian who had killed Croton seemed to him at that moment some
  superhuman being. While running, he thought that he might be some god who had
  taken the form of a barbarian. At that moment he believed in all the gods of
  the world, and in all myths, at which he jeered usually. It flew through his
  head, too, that it might be the God of the Christians who had killed Croton;
  and his hair stood on end again at the thought that he was in conflict with
  such a power.</p>

  <p>Only when he had run through a number of alleys, and saw some workmen
  coming toward him from a distance, was he calmed somewhat. Breath failed in
  his breast; so he sat on the threshold of a house and began to wipe, with a
  corner of his mantle, his sweat-covered forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am old, and need calm,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>The people coming toward him turned into some little side street, and
  again the place round about was empty. The city was sleeping yet. In the
  morning movement began earlier in the wealthier parts of the city, where the
  slaves of rich houses were forced to rise before daylight; in portions
  inhabited by a free population, supported at the cost of the State, hence
  unoccupied, they woke rather late, especially in winter. Chilo, after he had
  sat some time on the threshold, felt a piercing cold; so he rose, and,
  convincing himself that he had not lost the purse received from Vinicius,
  turned toward the river with a step now much slower.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I may see Croton&rsquo;s body somewhere,&rdquo; said he to himself.
  &ldquo;O gods! that Lygian, if he is a man, might make millions of sestertia
  in the course of one year; for if he choked Croton, like a whelp, who can
  resist him? They would give for his every appearance in the arena as much
  gold as he himself weighs. He guards that maiden better than Cerberus does
  Hades. But may Hades swallow him, for all that! I will have nothing to do
  with him. He is too bony. But where shall I begin in this case? A dreadful
  thing has happened. If he has broken the bones of such a man as Croton,
  beyond a doubt the soul of Vinicius is puling above that cursed house now,
  awaiting his burial. By Castor! but he is a patrician, a friend of Cæsar, a
  relative of Petronius, a man known in all Rome, a military tribune. His death
  cannot pass without punishment. Suppose I were to go to the pretorian camp,
  or the guards of the city, for instance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he stopped and began to think, but said after a
  while,&mdash;&ldquo;Woe is me! Who took him to that house if not I? His
  freedmen and his slaves know that I came to his house, and some of them know
  with what object. What will happen if they suspect me of having pointed out
  to him purposely the house in which his death met him? Though it appear
  afterward, in the court, that I did not wish his death, they will say that I
  was the cause of it. Besides, he is a patrician; hence in no event can I
  avoid punishment. But if I leave Rome in silence, and go far away somewhere,
  I shall place myself under still greater suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was bad in every case. The only question was to choose the less evil.
  Rome was immense; still Chilo felt that it might become too small for him.
  Any other man might go directly to the prefect of the city guards and tell
  what had happened, and, though some suspicion might fall on him, await the
  issue calmly. But Chilo&rsquo;s whole past was of such character that every
  closer acquaintance with the prefect of the city or the prefect of the guard
  must cause him very serious trouble, and confirm also every suspicion which
  might enter the heads of officials.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, to flee would be to confirm Petronius in the opinion
  that Vinicius had been betrayed and murdered through conspiracy. Petronius
  was a powerful man, who could command the police of the whole Empire, and who
  beyond doubt would try to find the guilty parties even at the ends of the
  earth. Still, Chilo thought to go straight to him, and tell what had
  happened. Yes; that was the best plan. Petronius was calm, and Chilo might be
  sure of this, at least, that he would hear him to the end. Petronius, who
  knew the affair from its inception, would believe in Chilo&rsquo;s innocence
  more easily than would the prefects.</p>

  <p>But to go to him, it was needful to know with certainty what had happened
  to Vinicius. Chilo did not know that. He had seen, it is true, the Lygian
  stealing with Croton&rsquo;s body to the river, but nothing more. Vinicius
  might be killed; but he might be wounded or detained. Now it occurred to
  Chilo for the first time, that surely the Christians would not dare to kill a
  man so powerful,&mdash;a friend of Cæsar, and a high military
  official,&mdash;for that kind of act might draw on them a general
  persecution. It was more likely that they had detained him by superior force,
  to give Lygia means to hide herself a second time.</p>

  <p>This thought filled Chilo with hope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If that Lygian dragon has not torn him to pieces at the first
  attack, he is alive, and if he is alive he himself will testify that I have
  not betrayed him; and then not only does nothing threaten me, but&mdash;O
  Hermes, count again on two heifers&mdash;a fresh field is opening. I can
  inform one of the freedmen where to seek his lord; and whether he goes to the
  prefect or not is his affair, the only point being that I should not go.
  Also, I can go to Petronius, and count on a reward. I have found Lygia; now I
  shall find Vinicius, and then again Lygia. It is needful to know first
  whether Vinicius is dead or living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here it occurred to him that he might go in the night to the baker Demas
  and inquire about Ursus. But he rejected that thought immediately. He
  preferred to have nothing to do with Ursus. He might suppose, justly, that if
  Ursus had not killed Glaucus he had been warned, evidently, by the Christian
  elder to whom he had confessed his design,&mdash;warned that the affair was
  an unclean one, to which some traitor had persuaded him. In every case, at
  the mere recollection of Ursus, a shiver ran through Chilo&rsquo;s whole
  body. But he thought that in the evening he would send Euricius for news to
  that house in which the thing had happened. Meanwhile he needed refreshment,
  a bath, and rest. The sleepless night, the journey to Ostrianum, the flight
  from the Trans-Tiber, had wearied him exceedingly.</p>

  <p>One thing gave him permanent comfort: he had on his person two
  purses,&mdash;that which Vinicius had given him at home, and that which he
  had thrown him on the way from the cemetery. In view of this happy
  circumstance, and of all the excitement through which he had passed, he
  resolved to eat abundantly, and drink better wine than he drank usually.</p>

  <p>When the hour for opening the wine-shop came at last, he did so in such a
  marked measure that he forgot the bath; he wished to sleep, above all, and
  drowsiness overcame his strength so that he returned with tottering step to
  his dwelling in the Subura, where a slave woman, purchased with money
  obtained from Vinicius, was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>When he had entered a sleeping-room, as dark as the den of a fox, he threw
  himself on the bed, and fell asleep in one instant. He woke only in the
  evening, or rather he was roused by the slave woman, who called him to rise,
  for some one was inquiring, and wished to see him on urgent business.</p>

  <p>The watchful Chilo came to himself in one moment, threw on his hooded
  mantle hastily, and, commanding the slave woman to stand aside, looked out
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>And he was benumbed! for he saw before the door of the sleeping-room the
  gigantic form of Ursus.</p>

  <p>At that sight he felt his feet and head grow icy-cold, the heart ceased to
  beat in his bosom, and shivers were creeping along his back. For a time he
  was unable to speak; then with chattering teeth he said, or rather
  groaned,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Syra&mdash;I am not at home&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
  that&mdash;good man-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told him that thou wert at home, but asleep, lord,&rdquo;
  answered the girl; &ldquo;he asked to rouse thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O gods! I will command that thou&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Ursus, as if impatient of delay, approached the door of the sleeping-
  room, and, bending, thrust in his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Chilo Chilonides!&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pax tecum! pax! pax!&rdquo; answered Chilo. &ldquo;O best of
  Christians! Yes, I am Chilo; but this is a mistake,&mdash;I do not know
  thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo Chilonides,&rdquo; repeated Ursus, &ldquo;thy lord, Vinicius,
  summons thee to go with me to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A piercing pain roused Vinicius. At the first moment he
  could not understand where he was, nor what was happening. He felt a roaring
  in his head, and his eyes were covered as if with mist. Gradually, however,
  his consciousness returned, and at last he beheld through that mist three
  persons bending over him. Two he recognized: one was Ursus, the other the old
  man whom he had thrust aside when carrying off Lygia. The third, an utter
  stranger, was holding his left arm, and feeling it from the elbow upward as
  far as the shoulder-blade. This caused so terrible a pain that Vinicius,
  thinking it a kind of revenge which they were taking, said through his set
  teeth, &ldquo;Kill me!&rdquo; But they paid no apparent heed to his words,
  just as though they heard them not, or considered them the usual groans of
  suffering. Ursus, with his anxious and also threatening face of a barbarian,
  held a bundle of white cloth torn in long strips. The old man spoke to the
  person who was pressing the arm of Vinicius,&mdash;&ldquo;Glaucus, art thou
  certain that the wound in the head is not mortal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, worthy Crispus,&rdquo; answered Glaucus. &ldquo;While serving
  in the fleet as a slave, and afterward while living at Naples, I cured many
  wounds, and with the pay which came to me from that occupation I freed myself
  and my relatives at last. The wound in the head is slight. When this one
  [here he pointed to Ursus with his head] took the girl from the young man, he
  pushed him against the wall; the young man while falling put out his arm,
  evidently to save himself; he broke and disjointed it, but by so doing saved
  his head and his life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast had more than one of the brotherhood in thy care,&rdquo;
  added Crispus, &ldquo;and hast the repute of a skilful physician; therefore I
  sent Ursus to bring thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ursus, who on the road confessed that yesterday he was ready to
  kill me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He confessed his intention earlier to me than to thee; but I, who
  know thee and thy love for Christ, explained to him that the traitor is not
  thou, but the unknown, who tried to persuade him to murder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was an evil spirit, but I took him for an angel,&rdquo; said
  Ursus, with a sigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some other time thou wilt tell me, but now we must think of this
  wounded man.&rdquo; Thus speaking, he began to set the arm. Though Crispus
  sprinkled water on his face, Vinicius fainted repeatedly from suffering; that
  was, however, a fortunate circumstance, since he did not feel the pain of
  putting his arm into joint, nor of setting it. Glaucus fixed the limb between
  two strips of wood, which he bound quickly and firmly, so as to keep the arm
  motionless. When the operation was over, Vinicius recovered consciousness
  again and saw Lygia above him. She stood there at the bed holding a brass
  basin with water, in which from time to time Glaucus dipped a sponge and
  moistened the head of his patient.</p>

  <p>Vinicius gazed and could not believe his eyes. What he saw seemed a dream,
  or the pleasant vision brought by fever, and only after a long time could he
  whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;Lygia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The basin trembled in her hand at that sound, but she turned on him eyes
  full of sadness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace be with thee!&rdquo; answered she, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She stood there with extended arms, her face full of pity and sorrow. But
  he gazed, as if to fill his sight with her, so that after his lids were
  closed the picture might remain under them. He looked at her face, paler and
  smaller than it had been, at the tresses of dark hair, at the poor dress of a
  laboring woman; he looked so intently that her snowy forehead began to grow
  rose-colored under the influence of his look. And first he thought that he
  would love her always; and second, that that paleness of hers and that
  poverty were his work,&mdash;that it was he who had driven her from a house
  where she was loved, and surrounded with plenty and comfort, and thrust her
  into that squalid room, and clothed her in that poor robe of dark wool.</p>

  <p>He would have arrayed her in the costliest brocade, in all the jewels of
  the earth; hence astonishment, alarm, and pity seized him, and sorrow so
  great that he would have fallen at her feet had he been able to move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou didst not permit my
  death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May God return health to thee,&rdquo; she answered, with
  sweetness.</p>

  <p>For Vinicius, who had a feeling both of those wrongs which he had
  inflicted on her formerly, and those which he had wished to inflict on her
  recently, there was a real balsam in Lygia&rsquo;s words. He forgot at the
  moment that through her mouth Christian teaching might speak; he felt only
  that a beloved woman was speaking, and that in her answer there was a special
  tenderness, a goodness simply preterhuman, which shook him to the depth of
  his soul. As just before he had grown weak from pain, so now he grew weak
  from emotion. A certain faintness came on him, at once immense and agreeable.
  He felt as if falling into some abyss, but he felt that to fall was pleasant,
  and that he was happy. He thought at that moment of weakness that a divinity
  was standing above him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Glaucus had finished washing the wound in his head, and had
  applied a healing ointment. Ursus took the brass basin from Lygia&rsquo;s
  hands; she brought a cup of water and wine which stood ready on the table,
  and put it to the wounded man&rsquo;s lips. Vinicius drank eagerly, and felt
  great relief. After the operation the pain had almost passed; the wound and
  contusion began to grow firm; perfect consciousness returned to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me another drink,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>Lygia took the empty cup to the next room; meanwhile Crispus, after a few
  words with Glaucus, approached the bed saying,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God has not permitted thee, Vinicius, to accomplish an evil deed,
  and has preserved thee in life so that thou shouldst come to thy mind. He,
  before whom man is but dust, delivered thee defenceless into our hands; but
  Christ, in whom we believe, commanded us to love even our enemies. Therefore
  we have dressed thy wounds, and, as Lygia has said, we will implore God to
  restore thy health, but we cannot watch over thee longer. Be in peace, then,
  and think whether it beseems thee to continue thy pursuit of Lygia. Thou hast
  deprived her of guardians, and us of a roof, though we return thee good for
  evil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do ye wish to leave me? inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We wish to leave this house, in which prosecution by the prefect of
  the city may reach us. Thy companion was killed; thou, who art powerful among
  thy own people, art wounded. This did not happen through our fault, but the
  anger of the law might fall on us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear of prosecution,&rdquo; replied Vinicius; &ldquo;I will
  protect you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Crispus did not like to tell him that with them it was not only a question
  of the prefect and the police, but of him; they wished to secure Lygia from
  his further pursuit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thy right arm is well. Here are
  tablets and a stilus; write to thy servants to bring a litter this evening
  and bear thee to thy own house, where thou wilt have more comfort than in our
  poverty. We dwell here with a poor widow, who will return soon with her son,
  and this youth will take thy letter; as to us, we must all find another
  hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius grew pale, for he understood that they wished to separate him
  from Lygia, and that if he lost her now he might never see her in life again.
  He knew indeed that things of great import had come between him and her, in
  virtue of which, if he wished to possess her, he must seek some new methods
  which he had not had time yet to think over. He understood too that whatever
  he might tell these people, though he should swear that he would return Lygia
  to Pomponia Græcina, they would not believe him, and were justified in
  refusing belief. Moreover, he might have done that before. Instead of hunting
  for Lygia, he might have gone to Pomponia and sworn to her that he renounced
  pursuit, and in that case Pomponia herself would have found Lygia and brought
  her home. No; he felt that such promises would not restrain them, and no
  solemn oath would be received, the more since, not being a Christian, he
  could swear only by the immortal gods, in whom he did not himself believe
  greatly, and whom they considered evil spirits.</p>

  <p>He desired desperately to influence Lygia and her guardians in some way,
  but for that there was need of time. For him it was all-important to see her,
  to look at her for a few days even. As every fragment of a plank or an oar
  seems salvation to a drowning man, so to him it seemed that during those few
  days he might say something to bring him nearer to her, that he might think
  out something, that something favorable might happen. Hence he collected his
  thoughts and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Christians. Yesterday I was with you in Ostrianum,
  and I heard your teaching; but though I did not know it, your deeds have
  convinced me that you are honest and good people. Tell that widow who
  occupies this house to stay in it, stay in it yourselves, and let me stay.
  Let this man [here he turned to Glaucus], who is a physician, or at least
  understands the care of wounds, tell whether it is possible to carry me from
  here to-day. I am sick, I have a broken arm, which must remain immovable for
  a few days even; therefore I declare to you that I will not leave this house
  unless you bear me hence by force!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he stopped, for breath failed in his breast, and Crispus
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;We will use no force against thee, lord; we will only take
  away our own heads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this the young man, unused to resistance, frowned and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Permit me to recover breath&rdquo;; and after a time he
  began again to speak,&mdash;&ldquo;Of Croton, whom Ursus killed, no one will
  inquire. He had to go to-day to Beneventum, whither he was summoned by
  Vatinius, therefore all will think that he has gone there. When I entered
  this house in company with Croton, no one saw us except a Greek who was with
  us in Ostrianum. I will indicate to you his lodgings; bring that man to me.
  On him I will enjoin silence; he is paid by me. I will send a letter to my
  own house stating that I too went to Beneventum. If the Greek has informed
  the prefect already, I will declare that I myself killed Croton, and that it
  was he who broke my arm. I will do this, by my father&rsquo;s shade and by my
  mother&rsquo;s! Ye may remain in safety here; not a hair will fall from the
  head of one of you. Bring hither, and bring in haste, the Greek whose name is
  Chilo Chilonides!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then Glaucus will remain with thee,&rdquo; said Crispus, &ldquo;and
  the widow will nurse thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Consider, old man, what I say,&rdquo; said Vinicius, who frowned
  still more. &ldquo;I owe thee gratitude, and thou seemest good and honest;
  but thou dost not tell me what thou hast in the bottom of thy soul. Thou art
  afraid lest I summon my slaves and command them to take Lygia. Is this
  true?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Crispus, with sternness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then remember this, I shall speak before all to Chilo, and write a
  letter home that I have gone to Beneventum. I shall have no messengers
  hereafter but you. Remember this, and do not irritate me longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he was indignant, and his face was contorted with anger. Afterward he
  began to speak excitedly,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou thought that I would deny that I wish to stay here to see
  her? A fool would have divined that, even had I denied it. But I will not try
  to take her by force any longer. I will tell thee more: if she will not stay
  here, I will tear the bandages with this sound hand from my arm, will take
  neither food nor drink; let my death fall on thee and thy brethren. Why hast
  thou nursed me? Why hast thou not commanded to kill me?&rdquo; He grew pale
  from weakness and anger.</p>

  <p>Lygia, who had heard all from the other room and who was certain that
  Vinicius would do what he promised, was terrified. She would not have him die
  for anything. Wounded and defenceless, he roused in her compassion, not fear.
  Living from the time of her flight among people in continual religious
  enthusiasm, thinking only of sacrifices, offerings, and boundless charity,
  she had grown so excited herself through that new inspiration, that for her
  it took the place of house, family, lost happiness, and made her one of those
  Christian maidens who, later on, changed the former soul of the world.
  Vinicius had been too important in her fate, had been thrust too much on her,
  to let her forget him. She had thought of him whole days, and more than once
  had begged God for the moment in which, following the inspiration of
  religion, she might return good for his evil, mercy for his persecution,
  break him, win him to Christ, save him. And now it seemed to her that
  precisely that moment had come, and that her prayers had been heard.</p>

  <p>She approached Crispus therefore with a face as if inspired, and addressed
  him as though some other voice spoke through her,&mdash;&ldquo;Let him stay
  among us, Crispus, and we will stay with him till Christ gives him
  health.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old presbyter, accustomed to seek in all things the inspiration of
  God, beholding her exaltation, thought at once that perhaps a higher power
  was speaking through her, and, fearing in his heart, he bent his gray head,
  saying,&mdash;&ldquo;Let it be as thou sayest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On Vinicius, who the whole time had not taken his eyes from her, this
  ready obedience of Crispus produced a wonderful and pervading impression. It
  seemed to him that among the Christians Lygia was a kind of sibyl or
  priestess whom they surrounded with obedience and honor; and he yielded
  himself also to that honor. To the love which he felt was joined now a
  certain awe, in presence of which love itself became something almost
  insolent. He could not familiarize himself, however, with the thought that
  their relations had changed: that now not she was dependent on his will, but
  he on hers; that he was lying there sick and broken; that he had ceased to be
  an attacking, a conquering force; that he was like a defenceless child in her
  care. For his proud and commanding nature such relations with any other
  person would have been humiliating; now, however, not only did he not feel
  humiliated, but he was thankful to her as to his sovereign. In him those were
  feelings unheard-of, feelings which he could not have entertained the day
  before, and which would have amazed him even on that day had he been able to
  analyze them clearly. But he did not inquire at the moment why it was so,
  just as if the position had been perfectly natural; he merely felt happy
  because he remained there.</p>

  <p>And he wished to thank her with gratefulness, and still with a kind of
  feeling unknown to him in such a degree that he knew not what to call it, for
  it was simply submission. His previous excitement had so exhausted him that
  he could not speak, and he thanked her only with his eyes, which were
  gleaming from delight because he remained near her, and would be able to see
  her&mdash;to-morrow, next day, perhaps a long time. That delight was
  diminished only by the dread that he might lose what he had gained. So great
  was this dread that when Lygia gave him water a second time, and the wish
  seized him to take her hand, he feared to do so. He feared!&mdash;he, that
  Vinicius who at Cæsar&rsquo;s feast had kissed her lips in spite of her! he,
  that Vinicius who after her flight had promised himself to drag her by the
  hair to the cubiculum, or give command to flog her!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But he began also to fear that some outside force might
  disturb his delight. Chilo might give notice of his disappearance to the
  prefect of the city, or to his freedmen at home; and in such an event an
  invasion of the house by the city guards was likely. Through his head flew
  the thought, it is true, that in that event he might give command to seize
  Lygia and shut her up in his house, but he felt that he ought not to do so,
  and he was not capable of acting thus. He was tyrannical, insolent, and
  corrupt enough, if need be he was inexorable, but he was not Tigellinus or
  Nero. Military life had left in him a certain feeling of justice, and
  religion, and a conscience to understand that such a deed would be
  monstrously mean. He would have been capable, perhaps, of committing such a
  deed during an access of anger and while in possession of his strength, but
  at that moment he was filled with tenderness, and was sick. The only question
  for Vinicius at that time was that no one should stand between him and
  Lygia.</p>

  <p>He noticed, too, with astonishment, that from the moment when Lygia had
  taken his part, neither she herself nor Crispus asked from him any
  assurances, just as if they felt confident that, in case of need, some
  superhuman power would defend them. The young tribune, in whose head the
  distinction between things possible and impossible had grown involved and
  faint since the discourse of the Apostle in Ostrianum, was also not too far
  from supposing that that might take place. But considering things more
  soberly, he remembered what he had said of the Greek, and asked again that
  Chilo be brought to him.</p>

  <p>Crispus agreed, and they decided to send Ursus. Vinicius, who in recent
  days, before his visit to Ostrianum, had sent slaves frequently to Chilo,
  though without result, indicated his lodgings accurately to the Lygian; then
  writing a few words on the tablet, he said, turning to
  Crispus,&mdash;&ldquo;I give a tablet, for this man is suspicious and
  cunning. Frequently when summoned by me, he gave directions to answer my
  people that he was not at home; he did so always when he had no good news for
  me, and feared my anger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I find him, I will bring him, willing or unwilling,&rdquo; said
  Ursus. Then, taking his mantle, he went out hurriedly.</p>

  <p>To find any one in Rome was not easy, even with the most accurate
  directions; but in those cases the instinct of a hunter aided Ursus, and also
  his great knowledge of the city. After a certain time, therefore, he found
  himself at Chilo&rsquo;s lodgings.</p>

  <p>He did not recognize Chilo, however. He had seen him but once in his life
  before, and moreover, in the night. Besides, that lofty and confident old man
  who had persuaded him to murder Glaucus was so unlike the Greek, bent double
  from terror, that no one could suppose the two to be one person. Chilo,
  noticing that Ursus looked at him as a perfect stranger, recovered from his
  first fear. The sight of the tablet, with the writing of Vinicius, calmed him
  still more. At least the suspicion that he would take him into an ambush
  purposely did not trouble him. He thought, besides, that the Christians had
  not killed Vinicius, evidently because they had not dared to raise hands on
  so noted a person.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then Vinicius will protect me in case of need,&rdquo; thought
  he; &ldquo;of course he does not send to deliver me to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Summoning some courage, therefore, he said: &ldquo;My good man, has not my
  friend the noble Vinicius sent a litter? My feet are swollen; I cannot walk
  so far.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has not,&rdquo; answered Ursus; &ldquo;we shall go on
  foot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if I refuse?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not, for thou wilt have to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I will go, but of my own will. No one could force me, for I am
  a free man, and a friend of the prefect of the city. As a sage, I have also
  means to overcome others, and I know how to turn people into trees and wild
  beasts. But I will go, I will go! I will only put on a mantle somewhat
  warmer, and a hood, lest the slaves of that quarter might recognize me; they
  would stop me every moment to kiss my hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put on a new mantle then, and let down a broad Gallic hood, lest Ursus
  might recognize his features on coming into clearer light.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where wilt thou take me?&rdquo; asked he on the road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the Trans-Tiber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not long in Rome, and I have never been there, but there too,
  of course, live men who love virtue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Ursus, who was a simple man, and had heard Vinicius say that the Greek
  had been with him in Ostrianum, and had seen him with Croton enter the house
  in which Lygia lived, stopped for a moment and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Speak no
  untruth, old man, for to-day thou wert with Vinicius in Ostrianum and under
  our gate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Chilo, &ldquo;then is your house in the Trans-
  Tiber? I have not been long in Rome, and know not how the different parts are
  named. That is true, friend; I was under the gate, and implored Vinicius in
  the name of virtue not to enter. I was in Ostrianum, and dost thou know why?
  I am working for a certain time over the conversion of Vinicius, and wished
  him to hear the chief of the Apostles. May the light penetrate his soul and
  thine! But thou art a Christian, and wishest truth to overcome
  falsehood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; answered Ursus, with humility.</p>

  <p>Courage returned to Chilo completely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius is a powerful lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and a friend of
  Cæsar. He listens often yet to the whisperings of the evil spirit; but if
  even a hair should fall from his head, Cæsar would take vengeance on all the
  Christians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A higher power is protecting us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely, surely! But what do ye intend to do with Vinicius?&rdquo;
  inquired Chilo, with fresh alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not. Christ commands mercy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast answered excellently. Think of this always, or thou wilt
  fry in hell like a sausage in a frying-pan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus sighed, and Chilo thought that he could always do what he liked with
  that man, who was terrible at the moment of his first outburst. So, wishing
  to know what happened at the seizing of Lygia, he asked further, in the voice
  of a stern judge,&mdash;&ldquo;How did ye treat Croton? Speak, and do not
  prevaricate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus sighed a second time. &ldquo;Vinicius will tell thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That means that thou didst stab him with a knife, or kill him with
  a club.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was without arms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek could not resist amazement at the superhuman strength of the
  barbarian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Pluto&mdash;that is to say, may Christ pardon thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went on for some time in silence; then Chilo said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not betray thee; but have a care of the watches.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear Christ, not the watches.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that is proper. There is no more grievous crime than murder. I
  will pray for thee; but I know not if even my prayer can be effective, unless
  thou make a vow never to touch any one in life with a finger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As it is, I have not killed purposely,&rdquo; answered Ursus.</p>

  <p>But Chilo, who desired to secure himself in every case, did not cease to
  condemn murder, and urge Ursus to make the vow. He inquired also about
  Vinicius; but the Lygian answered his inquiries unwillingly, repeating that
  from Vinicius himself he would hear what he needed. Speaking in this way,
  they passed at last the long road which separated the lodgings of the Greek
  from the Trans-Tiber, and found themselves before the house. Chilo&rsquo;s
  heart began to beat again unquietly. From dread it seemed to him that Ursus
  was beginning to look at him with a kind of greedy expression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is small consolation to me,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;if
  he kills me unwillingly. I prefer in every case that paralysis should strike
  him, and with him all the Lygians,&mdash;which do thou effect, O Zeus, if
  thou art able.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus meditating, he wrapped himself more closely in his Gallic mantle,
  repeating that he feared the cold. Finally, when they had passed the entrance
  and the first court, and found themselves in the corridor leading to the
  garden of the little house, he halted suddenly and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Let me
  draw breath, or I shall not be able to speak with Vinicius and give him
  saving advice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He halted; for though he said to himself that no danger threatened, still
  his legs trembled under him at the thought that he was among those mysterious
  people whom he had seen in Ostrianum.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a hymn came to their ears from the little house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou sayest that thou art a Christian, and knowest not that among
  us it is the custom after every meal to glorify our Saviour with
  singing,&rdquo; answered Ursus. &ldquo;Miriam and her son must have returned,
  and perhaps the Apostle is with them, for he visits the widow and Crispus
  every day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Conduct me directly to Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius is in the same room with all, for that is the only large
  one; the others are very small chambers, to which we go only to sleep. Come
  in; thou wilt rest there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They entered. It was rather dark in the room; the evening was cloudy and
  cold, the flames of a few candles did not dispel the darkness altogether.
  Vinicius divined rather than recognized Chilo in the hooded man. Chilo,
  seeing the bed in the corner of the room, and on it Vinicius, moved toward
  him directly, not looking at the others, as if with the conviction that it
  would be safest near him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, lord, why didst thou not listen to my counsels?&rdquo;
  exclaimed he, putting his hands together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;and listen!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he looked sharply into Chilo&rsquo;s eyes, and spoke slowly with
  emphasis, as if wishing the Greek to understand every word of his as a
  command, and to keep it forever in memory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Croton threw himself on me to kill and rob me, dost understand? I
  killed him then, and these people dressed the wounds which I received in the
  struggle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo understood in a moment that if Vinicius spoke in this way it must be
  in virtue of some agreement with the Christians, and in that case he wished
  people to believe him. He saw this, too, from his face; hence in one moment,
  without showing doubt or astonishment, he raised his eyes and
  exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;That was a faith-breaking ruffian! But I warned thee,
  lord, not to trust him; my teachings bounded from his head as do peas when
  thrown against a wall. In all Hades there are not torments enough for him. He
  who cannot be honest must be a rogue; what is more difficult than for a rogue
  to become honest? But to fall on his benefactor, a lord so
  magnanimous&mdash;O gods!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he remembered that he had represented himself to Ursus on the way as
  a Christian, and stopped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were it not for the &lsquo;sica,&rsquo; which I brought, he would
  have slain me,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bless the moment in which I advised thee to take a knife
  even.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius turned an inquiring glance on the Greek, and
  asked,&mdash;&ldquo;What hast thou done to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How? What! have I not told thee, lord, that I made a vow for thy
  health?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was just preparing to visit thee, when this good man came and
  said that thou hadst sent for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here is a tablet. Thou wilt go with it to my house; thou wilt find
  my freedman and give it to him. It is written on the tablet that I have gone
  to Beneventum. Thou wilt tell Demas from thyself that I went this morning,
  summoned by an urgent letter from Petronius.&rdquo; Here he repeated with
  emphasis: &ldquo;I have gone to Beneventum, dost understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou has gone, lord. This morning I took leave of thee at the Porta
  Capena, and from the time of thy departure such sadness possesses me that if
  thy magnanimity will not soften it, I shall cry myself to death, like the
  unhappy wife of Zethos [Aedon turned into a nightingale] in grief for
  Itylos.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, though sick and accustomed to the Greek&rsquo;s suppleness,
  could not repress a smile. He was glad, moreover, that Chilo understood in a
  flash; hence he said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Therefore I will write that thy tears be wiped away. Give me the
  candle.&rdquo; Chilo, now pacified perfectly, rose, and, advancing a few
  steps toward the chimney, took one of the candles which was burning at the
  wall. But while he was doing this, the hood slipped from his head, and the
  light fell directly on his face. Glaucus sprang from his seat and, coming up
  quickly, stood before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou not recognize me, Cephas?&rdquo; asked he. In his voice
  there was something so terrible that a shiver ran through all present.</p>

  <p>Chilo raised the candle, and dropped it to the earth almost the same
  instant; then he bent nearly double and began to groan,&mdash;&ldquo;I am not
  he&mdash;I am not he! Mercy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucus turned toward the faithful, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;This is the man
  who betrayed&mdash;who ruined me and my family!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That history was known to all the Christians and to Vinicius, who had not
  guessed who that Glaucus was,&mdash;for this reason only, that he fainted
  repeatedly from pain during the dressing of his wound, and had not heard his
  name. But for Ursus that short moment, with the words of Glaucus, was like a
  lightning-flash in darkness. Recognizing Chilo, he was at his side with one
  spring, and, seizing his arm, bent it back, exclaiming,&mdash;&ldquo;This is
  the man who persuaded me to kill Glaucus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; groaned Chilo. &ldquo;I will give you&mdash;O
  lord!&rdquo; exclaimed he, turning his head to Vinicius, &ldquo;save me! I
  trusted in thee, take my part. Thy letter&mdash;I will deliver it. O lord,
  lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius, who looked with more indifference than any one at what was
  passing, first because all the affairs of the Greek were more or less known
  to him, and second because his heart knew not what pity was,
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Bury him in the garden; some one else will take the
  letter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It seemed to Chilo that those words were his final sentence. His bones
  were shaking in the terrible hands of Ursus; his eyes were filled with tears
  from pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By your God, pity!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I am a Christian! Pax
  vobiscum! I am a Christian; and if ye do not believe me, baptize me again,
  baptize me twice, ten times! Glaucus, that is a mistake! Let me speak, make
  me a slave! Do not kill me! Have mercy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His voice, stifled with pain, was growing weaker and weaker, when the
  Apostle Peter rose at the table; for a moment his white head shook, drooping
  toward his breast, and his eyes were closed; but he opened them then, and
  said amid silence,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Saviour said this to us: &rsquo;If thy brother has sinned
  against thee, chastise him; but if he is repentant, forgive him. And if he
  has offended seven times in the day against thee, and has turned to thee
  seven times, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me!&rdquo; forgive
  him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then came a still deeper silence. Glaucus remained a long time with his
  hands covering his face; at last he removed them and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Cephas, may God forgive thy offences, as I forgive them in
  the name of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus, letting go the arms of the Greek, added at once:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May the Saviour be merciful to thee as I forgive thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo dropped to the ground, and, supported on it with his hands, turned
  his head like a wild beast caught in a snare, looking around to see whence
  death might come. He did not trust his eyes and ears yet, and dared not hope
  for forgiveness. Consciousness returned to him slowly; his blue lips were
  still trembling from terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Depart in peace!&rdquo; said the Apostle, meanwhile.</p>

  <p>Chilo rose, but could not speak. He approached the bed of Vinicius, as if
  seeking protection in it still; for he had not time yet to think that that
  man, though he had used his services and was still his accomplice, condemned
  him, while those against whom he had acted forgave. This thought was to come
  to him later. At present simply astonishment and incredulity were evident in
  his look. Though he had seen that they forgave him, he wished to bear away
  his head at the earliest from among these incomprehensible people, whose
  kindness terrified him almost as much as their cruelty would have terrified.
  It seemed to him that should he remain longer, something unexpected would
  happen again; hence, standing above Vinicius, he said with a broken
  voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give the letter, lord,&mdash;give the letter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And snatching the tablet which Vinicius handed him, he made one obeisance
  to the Christians, another to the sick man, pushed along sidewise by the very
  wall, and hurried out through the door. In the garden, when darkness
  surrounded him, fear raised the hair on his head again, for he felt sure that
  Ursus would rush out and kill him in the night. He would have run with all
  his might, but his legs would not move; next moment they were perfectly
  uncontrollable, for Ursus stood near him really.</p>

  <p>Chilo fell with his face to the earth, and began to groan:
  &ldquo;Urban&mdash;in<br>
  Christ&rsquo;s name&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

  <p>But Urban said: &ldquo;Fear not. The Apostle commanded me to lead thee out
  beyond the gate, lest thou might go astray in the darkness, and, if strength
  failed thee, to conduct thee home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou say?&rdquo; asked Chilo, raising his face.
  &ldquo;What? Thou wilt not kill me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I will not; and if I seized thee too roughly and harmed a bone
  in thee, pardon me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help me to rise,&rdquo; said the Greek. &ldquo;Thou wilt not kill
  me? Thou wilt not? Take me to the Street; I will go farther alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus raised him as he might a feather, and placed him on his feet; then
  he conducted him through the dark corridor to the second court. From there
  was a passage to the entrance and the street. In the corridor Chilo repeated
  again in his soul, &ldquo;It is all over with me!&rdquo; Only when he found
  himself on the street did he recover and say, &ldquo;I can go on
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace be with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And with thee! and with thee! Let me draw breath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And after Ursus had gone, he breathed with a full breast. He felt his
  waist and hips, as if to convince himself that he was living, and then moved
  forward with hurried step.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why did they not kill me?&rdquo; And in spite of all his talk
  with Euricius about Christian teaching, in spite of his conversation at the
  river with Urban, and in spite of all that he had heard in Ostrianum, he
  could find no answer to that question.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Neither could Vinicius discover the cause of what had
  happened; and in the bottom of his soul he was almost as much astonished as
  Chilo. That those people should treat him as they had, and, instead of
  avenging his attack, dress his wounds carefully, he ascribed partly to the
  doctrine which they confessed, more to Lygia, and a little, also, to his
  great significance. But their conduct with Chilo simply went beyond his
  understanding of man&rsquo;s power of forgiveness. And the question thrust
  itself into his mind: Why did they not kill the Greek? They might have killed
  him with impunity. Ursus would have buried him in the garden, or borne him in
  the dark to the Tiber, which during that period of night-murders, committed
  by Cæsar himself even, cast up human bodies so frequently in the morning that
  no one inquired whence they came. To his thinking, the Christians had not
  only the power, but the right to kill Chilo. True, pity was not entirely a
  stranger to that world to which the young patrician belonged. The Athenians
  raised an altar to pity, and opposed for a long time the introduction of
  gladiatorial combats into Athens. In Rome itself the conquered received
  pardon sometimes, as, for instance, Calicratus, king of the Britons, who,
  taken prisoner in the time of Claudius, and provided for by him bountifully,
  dwelt in the city in freedom. But vengeance for a personal wrong seemed to
  Vinicius, as to all, proper and justified. The neglect of it was entirely
  opposed to his spirit. True, he had heard in Ostrianum that one should love
  even enemies; that, however, he considered as a kind of theory without
  application in life. And now this passed through his head: that perhaps they
  had not killed Chilo because the day was among festivals, or was in some
  period of the moon during which it was not proper for Christians to kill a
  man. He had heard that there are days among various nations on which it is
  not permitted to begin war even. But why, in such a case, did they not
  deliver the Greek up to justice? Why did the Apostle say that if a man
  offended seven times, it was necessary to forgive him seven times; and why
  did Glaucus say to Chilo, &ldquo;May God forgive thee, as I forgive
  thee&rdquo;?</p>

  <p>Chilo had done him the most terrible wrong that one man could do another.
  At the very thought of how he would act with a man who killed Lygia, for
  instance, the heart of Vinicius seethed up, as does water in a caldron; there
  were no torments which he would not inflict in his vengeance! But Glaucus had
  forgiven; Ursus, too, had forgiven,&mdash;Ursus, who might in fact kill
  whomever he wished in Rome with perfect impunity, for all he needed was to
  kill the king of the grove in Nemi, and take his place. Could the gladiator
  holding that office to which he had succeeded only by killing the previous
  &ldquo;king,&rdquo; resist the man whom Croton could not resist? There was
  only one answer to all these questions: that they refrained from killing him
  through a goodness so great that the like of it had not been in the world up
  to that time, and through an unbounded love of man, which commands to forget
  one&rsquo;s self, one&rsquo;s wrongs, one&rsquo;s happiness and misfortune,
  and live for others. What reward those people were to receive for this,
  Vinicius heard in Ostrianum, but he could not understand it. He felt,
  however, that the earthly life connected with the duty of renouncing
  everything good and rich for the benefit of others must be wretched. So in
  what he thought of the Christians at that moment, besides the greatest
  astonishment, there was pity, and as it were a shade of contempt. It seemed
  to him that they were sheep which earlier or later must be eaten by wolves;
  his Roman nature could yield no recognition to people who let themselves be
  devoured. This one thing struck him, however,&mdash;that after Chilo&rsquo;s
  departure the faces of all were bright with a certain deep joy. The Apostle
  approached Glaucus, placed his hand on his head, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;In
  thee Christ has triumphed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other raised his eyes, which were full of hope, and as bright with joy
  as if some great unexpected happiness had been poured on him. Vinicius, who
  could understand only joy or delight born of vengeance, looked on him with
  eyes staring from fever, and somewhat as he would on a madman. He saw,
  however, and saw not without internal indignation, that Lygia pressed her
  lips of a queen to the hand of that man, who had the appearance of a slave;
  and it seemed to him that the order of the world was inverted utterly. Next
  Ursus told how he had conducted Chilo to the street, and had asked
  forgiveness for the harm which he might have done his bones; for this the
  Apostle blessed him also. Crispus declared that it was a day of great
  victory. Hearing of this victory, Vinicius lost the thread of his thought
  altogether.</p>

  <p>But when Lygia gave him a cooling draught again, he held her hand for a
  moment, and asked,&mdash;&ldquo;Then must thou also forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are Christians; it is not permitted us to keep anger in the
  heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whoever thy God is, I honor Him only
  because He is thine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt honor Him in thy heart when thou lovest Him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only because He is thine,&rdquo; repeated Vinicius, in a fainter
  voice; and he closed his eyes, for weakness had mastered him again.</p>

  <p>Lygia went out, but returned after a time, and bent over him to learn if
  he were sleeping. Vinicius, feeling that she was near, opened his eyes and
  smiled. She placed her hand over them lightly, as if to incline him to
  slumber. A great sweetness seized him then; but soon he felt more grievously
  ill than before, and was very ill in reality. Night had come, and with it a
  more violent fever. He could not sleep, and followed Lygia with his eyes
  wherever she went.</p>

  <p>At times he fell into a kind of doze, in which he saw and heard everything
  which happened around him, but in which reality was mingled with feverish
  dreams. It seemed to him that in some old, deserted cemetery stood a temple,
  in the form of a tower, in which Lygia was priestess. He did not take his
  eyes from her, but saw her on the summit of the tower, with a lute in her
  hands, all in the light, like those priestesses who in the night-time sing
  hymns in honor of the moon, and whom he had seen in the Orient. He himself
  was climbing up winding steps, with great effort, to bear her away with him.
  Behind was creeping up Chilo, with teeth chattering from terror, and
  repeating, &ldquo;Do not do that, lord; she is a priestess, for whom He will
  take vengeance.&rdquo; Vinicius did not know who that He was, but he
  understood that he himself was going to commit some sacrilege, and he felt a
  boundless fear also. But when he went to the balustrade surrounding the
  summit of the tower, the Apostle with his silvery beard stood at
  Lygia&rsquo;s side on a sudden, and said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not raise a hand; she belongs to me.&rdquo; Then he moved
  forward with her, on a path formed by rays from the moon, as if on a path
  made to heaven. He stretched his hands toward them, and begged both to take
  him into their company.</p>

  <p>Here he woke, became conscious, and looked before him. The lamp on the
  tall staff shone more dimly, but still cast a light sufficiently clear. All
  were sitting in front of the fire warming themselves, for the night was
  chilly, and the chamber rather cold. Vinicius saw the breath coming as steam
  from their lips. In the midst of them sat the Apostle; at his knees, on a low
  footstool, was Lygia; farther on, Glaucus, Crispus, Miriam, and at the edge,
  on one side Ursus, on the other Miriam&rsquo;s son Nazarius, a youth with a
  handsome face, and long, dark hair reaching down to his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Lygia listened with eyes raised to the Apostle, and every head was turned
  toward him, while he told something in an undertone. Vinicius gazed at Peter
  with a certain superstitious awe, hardly inferior to that terror which he
  felt during the fever dream. The thought passed through his mind that that
  dream had touched truth; that the gray-haired man there, freshly come from
  distant shores, would take Lygia from him really, and take her somewhere away
  by unknown paths. He felt sure also that the old man was speaking of him,
  perhaps telling how to separate him from Lygia, for it seemed to him
  impossible that any one could speak of aught else. Hence, collecting all his
  presence of mind, he listened to Peter&rsquo;s words.</p>

  <p>But he was mistaken altogether, for the Apostle was speaking of Christ
  again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They live only through that name,&rdquo; thought Vinicius.</p>

  <p>The old man was describing the seizure of Christ. &ldquo;A company came,
  and servants of the priest to seize Him. When the Saviour asked whom they
  were seeking, they answered, &lsquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rsquo; But when He
  said to them, &lsquo;I am He,&rsquo; they fell on the ground, and dared not
  raise a hand on Him. Only after the second inquiry did they seize
  Him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here the Apostle stopped, stretched his hands toward the fire and
  continued:&mdash;&ldquo;The night was cold, like this one, but the heart in
  me was seething; so, drawing a sword to defend Him, I cut an ear from the
  servant of the high-priest. I would have defended Him more than my own life
  had He not said to me, &rsquo;Put thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my
  Father has given me, shall I not drink it?&rsquo; Then they seized and bound
  Him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had spoken thus far, Peter placed his palm on his forehead, and
  was silent, wishing before he went further to stop the crowd of his
  recollections. But Ursus, unable to restrain himself, sprang to his feet,
  trimmed the light on the staff till the sparks scattered in golden rain and
  the flame shot up with more vigor. Then he sat down, and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No matter what happened. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, for Lygia had put her finger to her lips. But he
  breathed loudly, and it was clear that a storm was in his soul; and though he
  was ready at all times to kiss the feet of the Apostle, that act was one he
  could not accept; if some one in his presence had raised hands on the
  Redeemer, if he had been with Him on that night&mdash;Oi! splinters would
  have shot from the soldiers, the servants of the priest, and the officials.
  Tears came to his eyes at the very thought of this, and because of his sorrow
  and mental struggle; for on the one hand he thought that he would not only
  have defended the Redeemer, but would have called Lygians to his
  aid,&mdash;splendid fellows,&mdash;and on the other, if he had acted thus he
  would have disobeyed the Redeemer, and hindered the salvation of man. For
  this reason he could not keep back his tears.</p>

  <p>After a while Peter took his palm from his forehead, and resumed the
  narrative. But Vinicius was overpowered by a new feverish, waking dream. What
  he heard now was in his mind mixed up with what the Apostle had told the
  night previous in Ostrianum, of that day in which Christ appeared on the
  shore of the sea of Tiberius. He saw a sheet of water broadly spread out; on
  it the boat of a fisherman, and in the boat Peter and Lygia. He himself was
  moving with all his might after that boat, but pain in his broken arm
  prevented him from reaching it. The wind hurled waves in his eyes, he began
  to sink, and called with entreating voice for rescue. Lygia knelt down then
  before the Apostle, who turned his boat, and reached an oar, which Vinicius
  seized: with their assistance he entered the boat and fell on the bottom of
  it.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him, then, that he stood up, and saw a multitude of people
  sailing after them. Waves covered their heads with foam; in the whirl only
  the hands of a few could be seen; but Peter saved the drowning time after
  time, and gathered them into his boat, which grew larger, as if by a miracle.
  Soon crowds filled it, as numerous as those which were collected in
  Ostrianum, and then still greater crowds. Vinicius wondered how they could
  find place there, and he was afraid that they would sink to the bottom. But
  Lygia pacified him by showing him a light on the distant shore toward which
  they were sailing. These dream pictures of Vinicius were blended again with
  descriptions which he had heard in Ostrianum, from the lips of the Apostle,
  as to how Christ had appeared on the lake once. So that he saw now in that
  light on the shore a certain form toward which Peter was steering, and as he
  approached it the weather grew calmer, the water grew smoother, the light
  became greater. The crowd began to sing sweet hymns; the air was filled with
  the odor of nard; the play of water formed a rainbow, as if from the bottom
  of the lake lilies and roses were looking, and at last the boat struck its
  breast safely against the sand. Lygia took his hand then, and said,
  &ldquo;Come, I will lead thee!&rdquo; and she led him to the light.</p>

  <p>Vinicius woke again; but his dreaming ceased slowly, and he did not
  recover at once the sense of reality. It seemed for a time to him that he was
  still on the lake, and surrounded by crowds, among which, not knowing the
  reason himself, he began to look for Petronius, and was astonished not to
  find him. The bright light from the chimney, at which there was no one at
  that time, brought him completely to his senses. Olive sticks were burning
  slowly under the rosy ashes; but the splinters of pine, which evidently had
  been put there some moments before, shot up a bright flame, and in the light
  of this, Vinicius saw Lygia, sitting not far from his bedside.</p>

  <p>The sight of her touched him to the depth of his soul. He remembered that
  she had spent the night before in Ostrianum, and had busied herself the whole
  day in nursing him, and now when all had gone to rest, she was the only one
  watching. It was easy to divine that she must be wearied, for while sitting
  motionless her eyes were closed. Vinicius knew not whether she was sleeping
  or sunk in thought. He looked at her profile, at her drooping lashes, at her
  hands lying on her knees; and in his pagan head the idea began to hatch with
  difficulty that at the side of naked beauty, confident, and proud of Greek
  and Roman symmetry, there is another in the world, new, immensely pure, in
  which a soul has its dwelling.</p>

  <p>He could not bring himself so far as to call it Christian, but, thinking
  of Lygia, he could not separate her from the religion which she confessed. He
  understood, even, that if all the others had gone to rest, and she alone were
  watching, she whom he had injured, it was because her religion commanded her
  to watch. But that thought, which filled him with wonder for the religion,
  was disagreeable to him. He would rather that Lygia acted thus out of love
  for him, his face, his eyes, his statuesque form,&mdash;in a word for reasons
  because of which more than once snow-white Grecian and Roman arms had been
  wound around his neck.</p>

  <p>Still he felt all at once, that, were she like other women, something
  would be lacking in her. He was amazed, and knew not what was happening in
  him; for he saw that new feelings of some kind were rising in him, new
  likings, strange to the world in which he had lived hitherto.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes then, and, seeing that Vinicius was gazing at her, she
  approached him and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I am with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw thy soul in a dream,&rdquo; replied he.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Next morning he woke up weak, but with a cool head and free
  of fever. It seemed to him that a whispered conversation had roused him; but
  when he opened his eyes, Lygia was not there. Ursus, stooping before the
  chimney, was raking apart the gray ashes, and seeking live coals beneath
  them. When he found some, he began to blow, not with his mouth, but as it
  were with the bellows of a blacksmith. Vinicius, remembering how that man had
  crushed Croton the day before, examined with attention befitting a lover of
  the arena his gigantic back, which resembled the back of a Cyclops, and his
  limbs strong as columns.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to Mercury that my neck was not broken by him,&rdquo;
  thought Vinicius. &ldquo;By Pollux! if the other Lygians are like this one,
  the Danubian legions will have heavy work some time!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But aloud he said, &ldquo;Hei, slave!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus drew his head out of the chimney, and, smiling in a manner almost
  friendly, said,&mdash;&ldquo;God give thee a good day, lord, and good health;
  but I am a free man, not a slave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On Vinicius who wished to question Ursus touching Lygia&rsquo;s
  birthplace, these words produced a certain pleasant impression; for discourse
  with a free though a common man was less disagreeable to his Roman and
  patrician pride, than with a slave, in whom neither law nor custom recognized
  human nature.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then thou dost not belong to Aulus?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord, I serve Callina, as I served her mother, of my own
  will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he hid his head again in the chimney, to blow the coals, on which he
  had placed some wood. When he had finished, he took it out and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;With us there are no slaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Lygia?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has gone out, and I am to cook food for thee. She watched over
  thee the whole night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didst thou not relieve her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because she wished to watch, and it is for me to obey.&rdquo; Here
  his eyes grew gloomy, and after a while he added:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I had disobeyed her, thou wouldst not be living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou sorry for not having killed me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord. Christ has not commanded us to kill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Atacinus and Croton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could not do otherwise,&rdquo; muttered Ursus. And he looked with
  regret on his hands, which had remained pagan evidently, though his soul had
  accepted the cross. Then he put a pot on the crane, and fixed his thoughtful
  eyes on the fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was thy fault, lord,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;Why didst
  thou raise thy hand against her, a king&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Pride boiled up, at the first moment, in Vinicius, because a common man
  and a barbarian had not merely dared to speak to him thus familiarly, but to
  blame him in addition. To those uncommon and improbable things which had met
  him since yesterday, was added another. But being weak and without his
  slaves, he restrained himself, especially since a wish to learn some details
  of Lygia&rsquo;s life gained the upper hand in him.</p>

  <p>When he had calmed himself, therefore, he inquired about the war of the
  Lygians against Vannius and the Suevi. Ursus was glad to converse, but could
  not add much that was new to what in his time Aulus Plautius had told. Ursus
  had not been in battle, for he had attended the hostages to the camp of
  Atelius Hister. He knew only that the Lygians had beaten the Suevi and the
  Yazygi, but that their leader and king had fallen from the arrows of the
  Yazygi. Immediately after they received news that the Semnones had set fire
  to forests on their boundaries, they returned in haste to avenge the wrong,
  and the hostages remained with Atelius, who ordered at first to give them
  kingly honors. Afterward Lygia&rsquo;s mother died. The Roman commander knew
  not what to do with the child. Ursus wished to return with her to their own
  country, but the road was unsafe because of wild beasts and wild tribes. When
  news came that an embassy of Lygians had visited Pomponius, offering him aid
  against the Marcomani, Hister sent him with Lygia to Pomponius. When they
  came to him they learned, however, that no ambassadors had been there, and in
  that way they remained in the camp; whence Pomponius took them to Rome, and
  at the conclusion of his triumph he gave the king&rsquo;s daughter to
  Pomponia Græcina.</p>

  <p>Though only certain small details of this narrative had been unknown to
  Vinicius, he listened with pleasure, for his enormous pride of family was
  pleased that an eye-witness had confirmed Lygia&rsquo;s royal descent. As a
  king&rsquo;s daughter she might occupy a position at Cæsar&rsquo;s court
  equal to the daughters of the very first families, all the more since the
  nation whose ruler her father had been, had not warred with Rome so far, and,
  though barbarian, it might become terrible; for, according to Atelius Hister
  himself, it possessed an immense force of warriors. Ursus, moreover,
  confirmed this completely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We live in the woods,&rdquo; said he, in answer to Vinicius,
  &ldquo;but we have so much land that no man knows where the end is, and there
  are many people on it. There are also wooden towns in the forest, in which
  there is great plenty; for what the Semnones, the Marcomani, the Vandals, and
  the Quadi plunder through the world, we take from them. They dare not come to
  us; but when the wind blows from their side, they burn our forests. We fear
  neither them nor the Roman Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods gave Rome dominion over the earth,&rdquo; said Vinicius
  severely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods are evil spirits,&rdquo; replied Ursus, with simplicity,
  &ldquo;and where there are no Romans, there is no supremacy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he fixed the fire, and said, as if to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;When
  Cæsar took Callina to the palace, and I thought that harm might meet her, I
  wanted to go to the forest and bring Lygians to help the king&rsquo;s
  daughter. And Lygians would have moved toward the Danube, for they are
  virtuous people though pagan. There I should have given them &lsquo;good
  tidings.&rsquo; But as it is, if ever Callina returns to Pomponia Græcina I
  will bow down to her for permission to go to them; for Christus was born far
  away, and they have not even heard of Him. He knew better than I where He
  should be born; but if He had come to the world with us, in the forests, we
  would not have tortured Him to death, that is certain. We would have taken
  care of the Child, and guarded Him, so that never should He want for game,
  mushrooms, beaver-skins, or amber. And what we plundered from the Suevi and
  the Marcomani we would have given Him, so that He might have comfort and
  plenty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he put near the fire the vessel with food for Vinicius, and
  was silent. His thoughts wandered evidently, for a time yet, through the
  Lygian wildernesses, till the liquid began to boil; then he poured it into a
  shallow plate, and, cooling it properly, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Glaucus advises
  thee, lord, to move even thy sound arm as little as possible; Callina has
  commanded me to give thee food.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia commanded! There was no answer to that. It did not even come to
  Vinicius&rsquo;s head to oppose her will, just as if she had been the
  daughter of Cæsar or a goddess. He uttered not a word, therefore; and Ursus,
  sitting near his bed, took out the liquid with a small cup, and put it to his
  mouth. He did this so carefully, and with such a kindly smile, that Vinicius
  could not believe his own eyes, could not think him the same terrible Titan
  who the day before had crushed Croton, and, rushing on him like a storm,
  would have torn him to pieces but for Lygia&rsquo;s pity. The young
  patrician, for the first time in life, began to ponder over this: What can
  take place in the breast of a simple man, a barbarian, and a servant?</p>

  <p>But Ursus proved to be a nurse as awkward as painstaking; the cup was lost
  among his herculean fingers so completely that there was no place left for
  the mouth of the sick man. After a few fruitless efforts the giant was
  troubled greatly, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Li! it would be easier to lead an
  aurochs out of a snare.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The anxiety of the Lygian amused Vinicius, but his remark did not interest
  him less. He had seen in circuses the terrible urus, brought from
  wildernesses of the north, against which the most daring bestiarii went with
  dread, and which yielded only to elephants in size and strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou tried to take such beasts by the horns?&rdquo; inquired
  he, with astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till the twentieth winter passed over me, I was afraid,&rdquo;
  answered Ursus; &ldquo;but after that it happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he began to feed Vinicius still more awkwardly than before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must ask Miriam or Nazarius,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>But now Lygia&rsquo;s pale face appeared from behind the curtain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will assist directly,&rdquo; said she. And after a while she came
  from the cubiculum, in which she had been preparing to sleep, as it seemed,
  for she was in a single close tunic, called by the ancients capitium,
  covering the breast completely, and her hair was unbound. Vinicius, whose
  heart beat with more quickness at sight of her, began to upbraid her for not
  thinking of sleep yet; but she answered joyously,&mdash;&ldquo;I was just
  preparing to sleep, but first I will take the place of Ursus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took the cup, and, sitting on the edge of the bed, began to give food
  to Vinicius, who felt at once overcome and delighted. When she inclined
  toward him, the warmth of her body struck him, and her unbound hair fell on
  his breast. He grew pale from the impression; but in the confusion and
  impulse of desires he felt also that that was a head dear above all and
  magnified above all, in comparison with which the whole world was nothing. At
  first he had desired her; now he began to love her with a full breast. Before
  that, as generally in life and in feeling, he had been, like all people of
  that time, a blind, unconditional egotist, who thought only of himself; at
  present he began to think of her.</p>

  <p>After a while, therefore, he refused further nourishment; and though he
  found inexhaustible delight in her presence and in looking at her, he
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Enough! Go to rest, my divine one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not address me in that way,&rdquo; answered Lygia; &ldquo;it is
  not proper for me to hear such words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled at him, however, and said that sleep had fled from her, that
  she felt no toil, that she would not go to rest till Glaucus came. He
  listened to her words as to music; his heart rose with increasing delight,
  increasing gratitude, and his thought was struggling to show her that
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia,&rdquo; said he, after a moment of silence, &ldquo;I did not
  know thee hitherto. But I know now that I wished to attain thee by a false
  way; hence I say, return to Pomponia Græcina, and be assured that in future
  no hand will be raised against thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her face became sad on a sudden. &ldquo;I should be happy,&rdquo; answered
  she, &ldquo;could I look at her, even from a distance; but I cannot return to
  her now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius, with astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We Christians know, through Acte, what is done on the Palatine.
  Hast thou not heard that Cæsar, soon after my flight and before his departure
  for Naples, summoned Aulus and Pomponia, and, thinking that they had helped
  me, threatened them with his anger? Fortunately Aulus was able to say to him,
  &rsquo;Thou knowest, lord, that a lie has never passed my lips; I swear to
  thee now that we did not help her to escape, and we do not know, as thou dost
  not, what has happened to her.&rsquo; Cæsar believed, and afterward forgot.
  By the advice of the elders I have never written to mother where I am, so
  that she might take an oath boldly at all times that she has no knowledge of
  me. Thou wilt not understand this, perhaps, O Vinicius; but it is not
  permitted us to lie, even in a question involving life. Such is the religion
  on which we fashion our hearts; therefore I have not seen Pomponia from the
  hour when I left her house. From time to time distant echoes barely reach her
  that I am alive and not in danger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here a longing seized Lygia, and her eyes were moist with tears; but she
  calmed herself quickly, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I know that Pomponia, too,
  yearns for me; but we have consolation which others have not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, &ldquo;Christ is your consolation,
  but I do not understand that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at us! For us there are no partings, no pains, no sufferings;
  or if they come they are turned into pleasure. And death itself, which for
  you is the end of life, is for us merely its beginning,&mdash;the exchange of
  a lower for a higher happiness, a happiness less calm for one calmer and
  eternal. Consider what must a religion be which enjoins on us love even for
  our enemies, forbids falsehood, purifies our souls from hatred, and promises
  happiness inexhaustible after death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard those teachings in Ostrianum, and I have seen how ye acted
  with me and with Chilo; when I remember your deeds, they are like a dream,
  and it seems to me that I ought not to believe my ears or eyes. But answer me
  this question: Art thou happy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered Lygia. &ldquo;One who confesses Christ cannot
  be unhappy.&rdquo; Vinicius looked at her, as though what she said passed
  every measure of human understanding.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And hast thou no wish to return to Pomponia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like, from my whole soul, to return to her; and shall
  return, if such be God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say to thee, therefore, return; and I swear by my lares that I
  will not raise a hand against thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia thought for a moment, and answered,&mdash;&ldquo;No, I cannot expose
  those near me to danger. Cæsar does not like the Plautiuses. Should I
  return&mdash;thou knowest how every news is spread throughout Rome by
  slaves&mdash;my return would be noised about in the city. Nero would hear of
  it surely through his slaves, and punish Aulus and Pomponia,&mdash;at least
  take me from them a second time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, frowning, &ldquo;that would be
  possible. He would do so, even to show that his will must be obeyed. It is
  true that he only forgot thee, or would remember thee, because the loss was
  not his, but mine. Perhaps, if he took thee from Aulus and Pomponia, he would
  send thee to me and I could give thee back to them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius, wouldst thou see me again on the Palatine?&rdquo;
  inquired Lygia.</p>

  <p>He set his teeth, and answered,&mdash;&ldquo;No. Thou art right. I spoke
  like a fool! No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And all at once he saw before him a precipice, as it were without bottom.
  He was a patrician, a military tribune, a powerful man; but above every power
  of that world to which he belonged was a madman whose will and malignity it
  was impossible to foresee. Only such people as the Christians might cease to
  reckon with Nero or fear him,&mdash;people for whom this whole world, with
  its separations and sufferings, was as nothing; people for whom death itself
  was as nothing. All others had to tremble before him. The terrors of the time
  in which they lived showed themselves to Vinicius in all their monstrous
  extent. He could not return Lygia to Aulus and Pomponia, then, through fear
  that the monster would remember her, and turn on her his anger; for the very
  same reason, if he should take her as wife, he might expose her, himself, and
  Aulus. A moment of ill-humor was enough to ruin all. Vinicius felt, for the
  first time in life, that either the world must change and be transformed, or
  life would become impossible altogether. He understood also this, which a
  moment before had been dark to him, that in such times only Christians could
  be happy.</p>

  <p>But above all, sorrow seized him, for he understood, too, that it was he
  who had so involved his own life and Lygia&rsquo;s that out of the
  complication there was scarcely an outcome. And under the influence of that
  sorrow he began to speak:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know that thou art happier than I? Thou art in poverty,
  and in this one chamber, among simple people, thou hast thy religion and thy
  Christ; but I have only thee, and when I lacked thee I was like a beggar
  without a roof above him and without bread. Thou art dearer to me than the
  whole world. I sought thee, for I could not live without thee. I wished
  neither feasts nor sleep. Had it not been for the hope of finding thee, I
  should have cast myself on a sword. But I fear death, for if dead I could not
  see thee. I speak the pure truth in saying that I shall not be able to live
  without thee. I have lived so far only in the hope of finding and beholding
  thee. Dost thou remember our conversations at the house of Aulus? Once thou
  didst draw a fish for me on the sand, and I knew not what its meaning was.
  Dost thou remember how we played ball? I loved thee then above life, and thou
  hadst begun already to divine that I loved thee. Aulus came, frightened us
  with Libitina, and interrupted our talk. Pomponia, at parting, told Petronius
  that God is one, all-mighty and all-merciful, but it did not even occur to us
  that Christ was thy God and hers. Let Him give thee to me and I will love
  Him, though He seems to me a god of slaves, foreigners, and beggars. Thou
  sittest near me, and thinkest of Him only. Think of me too, or I shall hate
  Him. For me thou alone art a divinity. Blessed be thy father and mother;
  blessed the land which produced thee! I should wish to embrace thy feet and
  pray to thee, give thee honor, homage, offerings, thou thrice divine! Thou
  knowest not, or canst not know, how I love thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he placed his hand on his pale forehead and closed his
  eyes. His nature never knew bounds in love or anger. He spoke with
  enthusiasm, like a man who, having lost self-control, has no wish to observe
  any measure in words or feelings. But he spoke from the depth of his soul,
  and sincerely. It was to be felt that the pain, ecstasy, desire, and homage
  accumulated in his breast had burst forth at last in an irresistible torrent
  of words. To Lygia his words appeared blasphemous, but still her heart began
  to beat as if it would tear the tunic enclosing her bosom. She could not
  resist pity for him and his suffering. She was moved by the homage with which
  he spoke to her. She felt beloved and deified without bounds; she felt that
  that unbending and dangerous man belonged to her now, soul and body, like a
  slave; and that feeling of his submission and her own power filled her with
  happiness. Her recollections revived in one moment. He was for her again that
  splendid Vinicius, beautiful as a pagan god; he, who in the house of Aulus
  had spoken to her of love, and roused as if from sleep her heart half
  childlike at that time; he from whose embraces Ursus had wrested her on the
  Palatine, as he might have wrested her from flames. But at present, with
  ecstasy, and at the same time with pain in his eagle face, with pale forehead
  and imploring eyes,&mdash;wounded, broken by love, loving, full of homage and
  submissive,&mdash;he seemed to her such as she would have wished him, and
  such as she would have loved with her whole soul, therefore dearer than he
  had ever been before.</p>

  <p>All at once she understood that a moment might come in which his love
  would seize her and bear her away, as a whirlwind; and when she felt this,
  she had the same impression that he had a moment before,&mdash;that she was
  standing on the edge of a precipice. Was it for this that she had left the
  house of Aulus? Was it for this that she had saved herself by flight? Was it
  for this that she had hidden so long in wretched parts of the city? Who was
  that Vinicius? An Augustian, a soldier, a courtier of Nero! Moreover he took
  part in his profligacy and madness, as was shown by that feast, which she
  could not forget; and he went with others to the temples, and made offerings
  to vile gods, in whom he did not believe, perhaps, but still he gave them
  official honor. Still more he had pursued her to make her his slave and
  mistress, and at the same time to thrust her into that terrible world of
  excess, luxury, crime, and dishonor which calls for the anger and vengeance
  of God. He seemed changed, it is true, but still he had just said to her that
  if she would think more of Christ than of him, he was ready to hate Christ.
  It seemed to Lygia that the very idea of any other love than the love of
  Christ was a sin against Him and against religion. When she saw then that
  other feelings and desires might be roused in the depth of her soul, she was
  seized by alarm for her own future and her own heart.</p>

  <p>At this moment of internal struggle appeared Glaucus, who had come to care
  for the patient and study his health. In the twinkle of an eye, anger and
  impatience were reflected on the face of Vinicius. He was angry that his
  conversation with Lygia had been interrupted; and when Glaucus questioned
  him, he answered with contempt almost. It is true that he moderated himself
  quickly; but if Lygia had any illusions as to this,&mdash;that what he had
  heard in Ostrianum might have acted on his unyielding nature,&mdash;those
  illusions must vanish. He had changed only for her; but beyond that single
  feeling there remained in his breast the former harsh and selfish heart,
  truly Roman and wolfish, incapable not only of the sweet sentiment of
  Christian teaching but even of gratitude.</p>

  <p>She went away at last filled with internal care and anxiety. Formerly in
  her prayers she had offered to Christ a heart calm, and really pure as a
  tear. Now that calmness was disturbed. To the interior of the flower a
  poisonous insect had come and began to buzz. Even sleep, in spite of the two
  nights passed without sleep, brought her no relief. She dreamed that at
  Ostrianum Nero, at the head of a whole band of Augustians, bacchantes,
  corybantes, and gladiators, was trampling crowds of Christians with his
  chariot wreathed in roses; and Vinicius seized her by the arm, drew her to
  the quadriga, and, pressing her to his bosom, whispered &ldquo;Come with
  us.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">From that moment Lygia showed herself more rarely in the
  common chamber, and approached his couch less frequently. But peace did not
  return to her. She saw that Vinicius followed her with imploring glance; that
  he was waiting for every word of hers, as for a favor; that he suffered and
  dared not complain, lest he might turn her away from him; that she alone was
  his health and delight. And then her heart swelled with compassion. Soon she
  observed, too, that the more she tried to avoid him, the more compassion she
  had for him; and by this itself the more tender were the feelings which rose
  in her. Peace left her. At times she said to herself that it was her special
  duty to be near him always, first, because the religion of God commands
  return of good for evil; second, that by conversing with him, she might
  attract him to the faith. But at the same time conscience told her that she
  was tempting herself; that only love for him and the charm which he exerted
  were attracting her, nothing else. Thus she lived in a ceaseless struggle,
  which was intensified daily. At times it seemed that a kind of net surrounded
  her, and that in trying to break through it she entangled herself more and
  more. She had also to confess that for her the sight of him was becoming more
  needful, his voice was becoming dearer, and that she had to struggle with all
  her might against the wish to sit at his bedside. When she approached him,
  and he grew radiant, delight filled her heart. On a certain day she noticed
  traces of tears on his eyelids, and for the first time in life the thought
  came to her, to dry them with kisses. Terrified by that thought, and full of
  self-contempt, she wept all the night following.</p>

  <p>He was as enduring as if he had made a vow of patience. When at moments
  his eyes flashed with petulance, self-will, and anger, he restrained those
  flashes promptly, and looked with alarm at her, as if to implore pardon. This
  acted still more on her. Never had she such a feeling of being greatly loved
  as then; and when she thought of this, she felt at once guilty and happy.
  Vinicius, too, had changed essentially. In his conversations with Glaucus
  there was less pride. It occurred to him frequently that even that poor slave
  physician and that foreign woman, old Miriam, who surrounded him with
  attention, and Crispus, whom he saw absorbed in continual prayer, were still
  human. He was astonished at such thoughts, but he had them. After a time he
  conceived a liking for Ursus, with whom he conversed entire days; for with
  him he could talk about Lygia. The giant, on his part, was inexhaustible in
  narrative, and while performing the most simple services for the sick man, he
  began to show him also some attachment. For Vinicius, Lygia had been at all
  times a being of another order, higher a hundred times than those around her:
  nevertheless, he began to observe simple and poor people,&mdash;a thing which
  he had never done before,&mdash;and he discovered in them various traits the
  existence of which he had never suspected.</p>

  <p>Nazarius, however, he could not endure, for it seemed to him that the
  young lad had dared to fall in love with Lygia. He had restrained his
  aversion for a long time, it is true; but once when he brought her two
  quails, which he had bought in the market with his own earned money, the
  descendant of the Quirites spoke out in Vinicius, for whom one who had
  wandered in from a strange people had less worth than the meanest worm. When
  he heard Lygia&rsquo;s thanks, he grew terribly pale; and when Nazarius went
  out to get water for the birds, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Lygia, canst thou
  endure that he should give thee gifts? Dost thou not know that the Greeks
  call people of his nation Jewish dogs?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know what the Greeks call them; but I know that Nazarius
  is a Christian and my brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When she had said this she looked at Vinicius with astonishment and
  regret, for he had disaccustomed her to similar outbursts; and he set his
  teeth, so as not to tell her that he would have given command to beat such a
  brother with sticks, or would have sent him as a compeditus [A man who labors
  with chained feet] to dig earth in his Sicilian vineyards. He restrained
  himself, however, throttled the anger within him, and only after a while did
  he say,&mdash;&ldquo;Pardon me, Lygia. For me thou art the daughter of a king
  and the adopted child of Plautius.&rdquo; And he subdued himself to that
  degree that when Nazarius appeared in the chamber again, he promised him, on
  returning to his villa, the gift of a pair of peacocks or flamingoes, of
  which he had a garden full.</p>

  <p>Lygia understood what such victories over himself must have cost him; but
  the oftener he gained them the more her heart turned to him. His merit with
  regard to Nazarius was less, however, than she supposed. Vinicius might be
  indignant for a moment, but he could not be jealous of him. In fact the son
  of Miriam did not, in his eyes, mean much more than a dog; besides, he was a
  child yet, who, if he loved Lygia, loved her unconsciously and servilely.
  Greater struggles must the young tribune have with himself to submit, even in
  silence, to that honor with which among those people the name of Christ and
  His religion was surrounded. In this regard wonderful things took place in
  Vinicius. That was in every case a religion which Lygia believed; hence for
  that single reason he was ready to receive it. Afterward, the more he
  returned to health, the more he remembered the whole series of events which
  had happened since that night at Ostrianum, and the whole series of thoughts
  which had come to his head from that time, the more he was astonished at the
  superhuman power of that religion which changed the souls of men to their
  foundations. He understood that in it there was something uncommon, something
  which had not been on earth before, and he felt that could it embrace the
  whole world, could it ingraft on the world its love and charity, an epoch
  would come recalling that in which not Jupiter, but Saturn had ruled. He did
  not dare either to doubt the supernatural origin of Christ, or His
  resurrection, or the other miracles. The eye-witnesses who spoke of them were
  too trustworthy and despised falsehood too much to let him suppose that they
  were telling things that had not happened. Finally, Roman scepticism
  permitted disbelief in the gods, but believed in miracles. Vinicius,
  therefore, stood before a kind of marvellous puzzle which he could not solve.
  On the other hand, however, that religion seemed to him opposed to the
  existing state of things, impossible of practice, and mad in a degree beyond
  all others. According to him, people in Rome and in the whole world might be
  bad, but the order of things was good. Had Cæsar, for example, been an honest
  man, had the Senate been composed, not of insignificant libertines, but of
  men like Thrasea, what more could one wish? Nay, Roman peace and supremacy
  were good; distinction among people just and proper. But that religion,
  according to the understanding of Vinicius, would destroy all order, all
  supremacy, every distinction. What would happen then to the dominion and
  lordship of Rome? Could the Romans cease to rule, or could they recognize a
  whole herd of conquered nations as equal to themselves? That was a thought
  which could find no place in the head of a patrician. As regarded him
  personally, that religion was opposed to all his ideas and habits, his whole
  character and understanding of life. He was simply unable to imagine how he
  could exist were he to accept it. He feared and admired it; but as to
  accepting it, his nature shuddered at that. He understood, finally, that
  nothing save that religion separated him from Lygia; and when he thought of
  this, he hated it with all the powers of his soul.</p>

  <p>Still he acknowledged to himself that it had adorned Lygia with that
  exceptional, unexplained beauty which in his heart had produced, besides
  love, respect, besides desire, homage, and had made of that same Lygia a
  being dear to him beyond all others in the world. And then he wished anew to
  love Christ. And he understood clearly that he must either love or hate Him;
  he could not remain indifferent. Meanwhile two opposing currents were as if
  driving him: he hesitated in thoughts, in feelings; he knew not how to
  choose, he bowed his head, however, to that God by him uncomprehended, and
  paid silent honor for this sole reason, that He was Lygia&rsquo;s God.</p>

  <p>Lygia saw what was happening in him; she saw how he was breaking himself,
  how his nature was rejecting that religion; and though this mortified her to
  the death, compassion, pity, and gratitude for the silent respect which he
  showed Christ inclined her heart to him with irresistible force. She recalled
  Pomponia Græcina and Aulus. For Pomponia a source of ceaseless sorrow and
  tears that never dried was the thought that beyond the grave she would not
  find Aulus. Lygia began now to understand better that pain, that bitterness.
  She too had found a being dear to her, and she was threatened by eternal
  separation from this dear one.</p>

  <p>At times, it is true, she was self-deceived, thinking that his soul would
  open itself to Christ&rsquo;s teaching; but these illusions could not remain.
  She knew and understood him too well. Vinicius a Christian!&mdash;These two
  ideas could find no place together in her unenlightened head. If the
  thoughtful, discreet Aulus had not become a Christian under the influence of
  the wise and perfect Pomponia, how could Vinicius become one? To this there
  was no answer, or rather there was only one,&mdash;that for him there was
  neither hope nor salvation.</p>

  <p>But Lygia saw with terror that that sentence of condemnation which hung
  over him instead of making him repulsive made him still dearer simply through
  compassion. At moments the wish seized her to speak to him of his dark
  future; but once, when she had sat near him and told him that outside
  Christian truth there was no life, he, having grown stronger at that time,
  rose on his sound arm and placed his head on her knees suddenly. &ldquo;Thou
  art life!&rdquo; said he. And that moment breath failed in her breast,
  presence of mind left her, a certain quiver of ecstasy rushed over her from
  head to feet. Seizing his temples with her hands, she tried to raise him, but
  bent the while so that her lips touched his hair; and for a moment both were
  overcome with delight, with themselves, and with love, which urged them the
  one to the other.</p>

  <p>Lygia rose at last and rushed away, with a flame in her veins and a
  giddiness in her head; but that was the drop which overflowed the cup filled
  already to the brim. Vinicius did not divine how dearly he would have to pay
  for that happy moment, but Lygia understood that now she herself needed
  rescue. She spent the night after that evening without sleep, in tears and in
  prayer, with the feeling that she was unworthy to pray and could not be
  heard. Next morning she went from the cubiculum early, and, calling Crispus
  to the garden summer-house, covered with ivy and withered vines, opened her
  whole soul to him, imploring him at the same time to let her leave
  Miriam&rsquo;s house, since she could not trust herself longer, and could not
  overcome her heart&rsquo;s love for Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Crispus, an old man, severe and absorbed in endless enthusiasm, consented
  to the plan of leaving Miriam&rsquo;s house, but he had no words of
  forgiveness for that love, to his thinking sinful. His heart swelled with
  indignation at the very thought that Lygia, whom he had guarded since the
  time of her flight, whom he had loved, whom he had confirmed in the faith,
  and on whom he looked now as a white lily grown up on the field of Christian
  teaching undefiled by any earthly breath, could have found a place in her
  soul for love other than heavenly. He had believed hitherto that nowhere in
  the world did there beat a heart more purely devoted to the glory of Christ.
  He wanted to offer her to Him as a pearl, a jewel, the precious work of his
  own hands; hence the disappointment which he felt filled him with grief and
  amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go and beg God to forgive thy fault,&rdquo; said he, gloomily.
  &ldquo;Flee before the evil spirit who involved thee bring thee to utter
  fall, and before thou oppose the Saviour. God died on the cross to redeem thy
  soul with His blood, but thou hast preferred to love him who wished to make
  thee his concubine. God saved thee by a miracle of His own hands, but thou
  hast opened thy heart to impure desire, and hast loved the son of darkness.
  Who is he? The friend and servant of Antichrist, his copartner in crime and
  profligacy. Whither will he lead thee, if not to that abyss and to that Sodom
  in which he himself is living, but which God will destroy with the flame of
  His anger? But I say to thee, would thou hadst died, would the walls of this
  house had fallen on thy head before that serpent had crept into thy bosom and
  beslimed it with the poison of iniquity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he was borne away more and more, for Lygia&rsquo;s fault filled him
  not only with anger but with loathing and contempt for human nature in
  general, and in particular for women, whom even Christian truth could not
  save from Eve&rsquo;s weakness. To him it seemed nothing that the maiden had
  remained pure, that she wished to flee from that love, that she had confessed
  it with compunction and penitence. Crispus had wished to transform her into
  an angel, to raise her to heights where love for Christ alone existed, and
  she had fallen in love with an Augustian. The very thought of that filled his
  heart with horror, strengthened by a feeling of disillusion and
  disappointment. No, no, he could not forgive her. Words of horror burned his
  lips like glowing coals; he struggled still with himself not to utter them,
  but he shook his emaciated hands over the terrified girl. Lygia felt guilty,
  but not to that degree. She had judged even that withdrawal from
  Miriam&rsquo;s house would be her victory over temptation, and would lessen
  her fault. Crispus rubbed her into the dust; showed her all the misery and
  insignificance of her soul, which she had not suspected hitherto. She had
  judged even that the old presbyter, who from the moment of her flight from
  the Palatine had been to her as a father, would show some compassion, console
  her, give her courage, and strengthen her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I offer my pain and disappointment to God,&rdquo; said he,
  &ldquo;but thou hast deceived the Saviour also, for thou hast gone as it were
  to a quagmire which has poisoned thy soul with its miasma. Thou mightst have
  offered it to Christ as a costly vessel, and said to Him, &rsquo;Fill it with
  grace, O Lord!&rsquo; but thou hast preferred to offer it to the servant of
  the evil one. May God forgive thee and have mercy on thee; for till thou cast
  out the serpent, I who held thee as chosen-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he ceased suddenly to speak, for he saw that they were not alone.
  Through the withered vines and the ivy, which was green alike in summer and
  winter, he saw two men, one of whom was Peter the Apostle. The other he was
  unable to recognize at once, for a mantle of coarse woollen stuff, called
  cilicium, concealed a part of his face. It seemed to Crispus for a moment
  that that was Chilo.</p>

  <p>They, hearing the loud voice of Crispus, entered the summer-house and sat
  on a stone bench. Peter&rsquo;s companion had an emaciated face; his head,
  which was growing bald, was covered at the sides with curly hair; he had
  reddened eyelids and a crooked nose; in the face, ugly and at the same time
  inspired, Crispus recognized the features of Paul of Tarsus.</p>

  <p>Lygia, casting herself on her knees, embraced Peter&rsquo;s feet, as if
  from despair, and, sheltering her tortured head in the fold of his mantle,
  remained thus in silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace to your souls!&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

  <p>And seeing the child at his feet he asked what had happened. Crispus began
  then to narrate all that Lygia had confessed to him,&mdash;her sinful love,
  her desire to flee from Miriam&rsquo;s house,&mdash;and his sorrow that a
  soul which he had thought to offer to Christ pure as a tear had defiled
  itself with earthly feelings for a sharer in all those crimes into which the
  pagan world had sunk, and which called for God&rsquo;s vengeance.</p>

  <p>Lygia during his speech embraced with increasing force the feet of the
  Apostle, as if wishing to seek refuge near them, and to beg even a little
  compassion.</p>

  <p>But the Apostle, when he had listened to the end, bent down and placed his
  aged hand on her head; then he raised his eyes to the old presbyter, and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Crispus, hast thou not heard that our beloved Master was
  in Cana, at a wedding, and blessed love between man and woman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Crispus&rsquo;s hands dropped, and he looked with astonishment on the
  speaker, without power to utter one word. After a moment&rsquo;s silence
  Peter asked again,&mdash;&ldquo;Crispus, dost thou think that Christ, who
  permitted Mary of Magdala to lie at his feet, and who forgave the public
  sinner, would turn from this maiden, who is as pure as a lily of the
  field?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia nestled up more urgently to the feet of Peter, with sobbing,
  understanding that she had not sought refuge in vain. The Apostle raised her
  face, which was covered with tears, and said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;While the
  eyes of him whom thou lovest are not open to the light of truth, avoid him,
  lest he bring thee to sin, but pray for him, and know that there is no sin in
  thy love. And since it is thy wish to avoid temptation, this will be
  accounted to thee as a merit. Do not suffer, and do not weep; for I tell thee
  that the grace of the Redeemer has not deserted thee, and that thy prayers
  will be heard; after sorrow will come days of gladness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he placed both hands on her head, and, raising his
  eyes, blessed her. From his face there shone a goodness beyond that of
  earth.</p>

  <p>The penitent Crispus began humbly to explain himself; &ldquo;I have sinned
  against mercy,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I thought that by admitting to her
  heart an earthly love she had denied Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I denied Him thrice,&rdquo; answered Peter, &ldquo;and still He
  forgave me, and commanded me to feed His sheep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And because,&rdquo; concluded Crispus, &ldquo;Vinicius is an
  Augustian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ softened harder hearts than his,&rdquo; replied Peter.</p>

  <p>Then Paul of Tarsus, who had been silent so far, placed his finger on his
  breast, pointing to himself, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I am he who persecuted
  and hurried servants of Christ to their death; I am he who during the stoning
  of Stephen kept the garments of those who stoned him; I am he who wished to
  root out the truth in every part of the inhabited earth, and yet the Lord
  predestined me to declare it in every land. I have declared it in Judea, in
  Greece, on the Islands, and in this godless city, where first I resided as a
  prisoner. And now when Peter, my superior, has summoned me, I enter this
  house to bend that proud head to the feet of Christ, and cast a grain of seed
  in that stony field, which the Lord will fertilize, so that it may bring
  forth a bountiful harvest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he rose. To Crispus that diminutive hunchback seemed then that which
  he was in reality,&mdash;a giant, who was to stir the world to its
  foundations and gather in lands and nations.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Petronius</i> to <i>Vinicius</i></p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Have pity,
  carissime; imitate not in thy letters the Lacedemonians or Julius Cæsar!
  Couldst thou, like Julius, write Veni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I
  conquered), I might understand thy brevity. But thy letter means absolutely
  Veni, vidi, fugi (I came, I saw, I fled). Since such a conclusion of the
  affair is directly opposed to thy nature, since thou art wounded, and since,
  finally, uncommon things are happening to thee, thy letter needs explanation.
  I could not believe my eyes when I read that the Lygian giant killed Croton
  as easily as a Caledonian dog would kill a wolf in the defiles of Hibernia.
  That man is worth as much gold as he himself weighs, and it depends on him
  alone to become a favorite of Cæsar. When I return to the city, I must gain a
  nearer acquaintance with that Lygian, and have a bronze statue of him made
  for myself. Ahenobarbus will burst from curiosity, when I tell him that it is
  from nature. Bodies really athletic are becoming rarer in Italy and in
  Greece; of the Orient no mention need be made; the Germans, though large,
  have muscles covered with fat, and are greater in bulk than in strength.
  Learn from the Lygian if he is an exception, or if in his country there are
  more men like him. Should it happen sometime to thee or me to organize games
  officially, it would be well to know where to seek for the best bodies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But praise to the gods of the Orient and the Occident that thou
  hast come out of such hands alive. Thou hast escaped, of course, because thou
  art a patrician, and the son of a consul; but everything which has happened
  astonishes me in the highest degree,&mdash;that cemetery where thou wert
  among the Christians, they, their treatment of thee, the subsequent flight of
  Lygia; finally, that peculiar sadness and disquiet which breathes from thy
  short letter. Explain, for there are many points which I cannot understand;
  and if thou wish the truth, I will tell thee plainly, that I understand
  neither the Christians nor thee nor Lygia. Wonder not that I, who care for
  few things on earth except my own person, inquire of thee so eagerly. I have
  contributed to all this affair of thine; hence it is my affair so far. Write
  soon, for I cannot foresee surely when we may meet. In Bronzebeard&rsquo;s
  head plans change, as winds do in autumn. At present, while tarrying in
  Beneventum, he has the wish to go straightway to Greece, without returning to
  Rome. Tigellinus, however, advises him to visit the city even for a time,
  since the people, yearning overmuch for his person (read &lsquo;for games and
  bread&rsquo;) may revolt. So I cannot tell how it will be. Should Achæa
  overbalance, we may want to see Egypt. I should insist with all my might on
  thy coming, for I think that in thy state of mind travelling and our
  amusements would be a medicine, but thou mightst not find us. Consider, then,
  whether in that case repose in thy Sicilian estates would not be preferable
  to remaining in Rome. Write me minutely of thyself, and farewell. I add no
  wish this time, except health; for, by Pollux! I know not what to wish
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, on receiving this letter, felt at first no desire to reply. He
  had a kind of feeling that it was not worth while to reply, that an answer
  would benefit no one in any way, that it would explain nothing. Discontent,
  and a feeling of the vanity of life, possessed him. He thought, moreover,
  that Petronius would not comprehend him in any case, and that something had
  happened which would remove them from each other. He could not come to an
  agreement with himself, even. When he returned from the Trans-Tiber to his
  splendid &ldquo;insula,&rdquo; he was exhausted, and found for the first days
  a certain satisfaction in rest and in the comfort and abundance about him.
  That satisfaction lasted but a short time, however. He felt soon that he was
  living in vanity; that all which so far had formed the interest of his life
  either had ceased to exist for him or had shrunk to proportions barely
  perceptible. He had a feeling as if those ties which hitherto had connected
  him with life had been cut in his soul, and that no new ones had been formed.
  At the thought that he might go to Beneventum and thence to Achæa, to swim in
  a life of luxury and wild excess, he had a feeling of emptiness. &ldquo;To
  what end? What shall I gain from it?&rdquo; These were the first questions
  which passed through his head. And for the first time in life, also, he
  thought that if he went, the conversation of Petronius, his wit, his
  quickness, his exquisite outlining of thought, and his choice of apt phrases
  for every idea might annoy him.</p>

  <p>But solitude, too, had begun to annoy him. All his acquaintances were with
  Cæsar in Beneventum; so he had to stay at home alone, with a head full of
  thoughts, and a heart full of feelings which he could not analyze. He had
  moments, however, in which he judged that if he could converse with some one
  about everything that took place in him, perhaps he might be able to grasp it
  all somehow, bring it to order, and estimate it better. Under the influence
  of this hope, and after some days of hesitation, he decided to answer
  Petronius; and, though not certain that he would send the answer, he wrote it
  in the following words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is thy wish that I write more minutely, agreed then; whether I
  shall be able to do it more clearly, I cannot tell, for there are many knots
  which I know not myself how to loosen. I described to thee my stay among the
  Christians, and their treatment of enemies, among whom they had a right to
  count both me and Chilo; finally, of the kindness with which they nursed me,
  and of the disappearance of Lygia. No, my dear friend, I was not spared
  because of being the son of a consul. Such considerations do not exist for
  them, since they forgave even Chilo, though I urged them to bury him in the
  garden. Those are people such as the world has not seen hitherto, and their
  teaching is of a kind that the world has not heard up to this time. I can say
  nothing else, and he errs who measures them with our measure. I tell thee
  that, if I had been lying with a broken arm in my own house, and if my own
  peoples, even my own family, had nursed me, I should have had more comforts,
  of course, but I should not have received half the care which I found among
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know this, too, that Lygia is like the others. Had she been my
  sister or my wife, she could not have nursed me more tenderly. Delight filled
  my heart more than once, for I judged that love alone could inspire the like
  tenderness. More than once I saw love in her look, in her face; and, wilt
  thou believe me? among those simple people then in that poor chamber, which
  was at once a culina and a triclinium, I felt happier than ever before. No;
  she was not indifferent to me&mdash;and to-day even I cannot think that she
  was. Still that same Lygia left Miriam&rsquo;s dwelling in secret because of
  me. I sit now whole days with my head on my hands, and think, Why did she do
  so? Have I written thee that I volunteered to restore her to Aulus? True, she
  declared that to be impossible at present, because Aulus and Pomponia had
  gone to Sicily, and because news of her return going from house to house,
  through slaves, would reach the Palatine, and Cæsar might take her from Aulus
  again. But she knew that I would not pursue her longer; that I had left the
  way of violence; that, unable to cease loving her or to live without her, I
  would bring her into my house through a wreathed door, and seat her on a
  sacred skin at my hearth. Still she fled! Why? Nothing was threatening her.
  Did she not love me, she might have rejected me. The day before her flight, I
  made the acquaintance of a wonderful man, a certain Paul of Tarsus, who spoke
  to me of Christ and His teachings, and spoke with such power that every word
  of his, without his willing it, turns all the foundations of our society into
  ashes. That same man visited me after her flight, and said: &rsquo;If God
  open thy eyes to the light, and take the beam from them as He took it from
  mine, thou wilt feel that she acted properly; and then, perhaps, thou wilt
  find her.&rsquo; And now I am breaking my head over these words, as if I had
  heard them from the mouth of the Pythoness at Delphi. I seem to understand
  something. Though they love people, the Christians are enemies of our life,
  our gods, and our crimes; hence she fled from me, as from a man who belongs
  to our society, and with whom she would have to share a life counted criminal
  by Christians. Thou wilt say that since she might reject me, she had no need
  to withdraw. But if she loved me? In that case she desired to flee from love.
  At the very thought of this I wish to send slaves into every alley in Rome,
  and command them to cry throughout the houses, &lsquo;Return, Lygia!&rsquo;
  But I cease to understand why she fled. I should not have stopped her from
  believing in her Christ, and would myself have reared an altar to Him in the
  atrium. What harm could one more god do me? Why might I not believe in
  him,&mdash;I who do not believe overmuch in the old gods? I know with full
  certainty that the Christians do not lie; and they say that he rose from the
  dead. A man cannot rise from the dead. That Paul of Tarsus, who is a Roman
  citizen, but who, as a Jew, knows the old Hebrew writings, told me that the
  coming of Christ was promised by prophets for whole thousands of years. All
  these are uncommon things, but does not the uncommon surround us on every
  side? People have not ceased talking yet of Apollonius of Tyana. Paul&rsquo;s
  statement that there is one God, not a whole assembly of them, seems sound to
  me. Perhaps Seneca is of this opinion, and before him many others. Christ
  lived, gave Himself to be crucified for the salvation of the world, and rose
  from the dead. All this is perfectly certain. I do not see, therefore, a
  reason why I should insist on an opposite opinion, or why I should not rear
  to Him an altar, if I am ready to rear one to Serapis, for instance. It would
  not be difficult for me even to renounce other gods, for no reasoning mind
  believes in them at present. But it seems that all this is not enough yet for
  the Christians. It is not enough to honor Christ, one must also live
  according to His teachings; and here thou art on the shore of a sea which
  they command thee to wade through.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I promised to do so, they themselves would feel that the promise
  was an empty sound of words. Paul told me so openly. Thou knowest how I love
  Lygia, and knowest that there is nothing that I would not do for her. Still,
  even at her wish, I cannot raise Soracte or Vesuvius on my shoulders, or
  place Thrasymene Lake on the palm of my hand, or from black make my eyes
  blue, like those of the Lygians. If she so desired, I could have the wish,
  but the change does not lie in my power. I am not a philosopher, but also I
  am not so dull as I have seemed, perhaps, more than once to thee. I will
  state now the following: I know not how the Christians order their own lives,
  but I know that where their religion begins, Roman rule ends, Rome itself
  ends, our mode of life ends, the distinction between conquered and conqueror,
  between rich and poor, lord and slave, ends, government ends, Cæsar ends, law
  and all the order of the world ends; and in place of those appear Christ,
  with a certain mercy not existent hitherto, and kindness, opposed to human
  and our Roman instincts. It is true that Lygia is more to me than all Rome
  and its lordship; and I would let society vanish could I have her in my
  house. But that is another thing. Agreement in words does not satisfy the
  Christians; a man must feel that their teaching is truth, and not have aught
  else in his soul. But that, the gods are my witnesses, is beyond me. Dost
  understand what that means? There is something in my nature which shudders at
  this religion; and were my lips to glorify it, were I to conform to its
  precepts, my soul and my reason would say that I do so through love for
  Lygia, and that apart from her there is to me nothing on earth more
  repulsive. And, a strange thing, Paul of Tarsus understands this, and so does
  that old theurgus Peter, who in spite of all his simplicity and low origin is
  the highest among them, and was the disciple of Christ. And dost thou know
  what they are doing? They are praying for me, and calling down something
  which they call grace; but nothing descends on me, save disquiet, and a
  greater yearning for Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have written thee that she went away secretly; but when going she
  left me a cross which she put together from twigs of boxwood. When I woke up,
  I found it near my bed. I have it now in the lararium, and I approach it yet,
  I cannot tell why, as if there were something divine in it,&mdash;that is,
  with awe and reverence. I love it because her hand bound it, and I hate it
  because it divides us. At times it seems to me that there are enchantments of
  some kind in all this affair, and that the theurgus, Peter, though he
  declares himself to be a simple shepherd, is greater than Apollonius, and all
  who preceded him, and that he has involved us all&mdash;Lygia, Pomponia, and
  me&mdash;with them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast written that in my previous letter disquiet and sadness
  are visible. Sadness there must be, for I have lost her again, and there is
  disquiet because something has changed in me. I tell thee sincerely, that
  nothing is more repugnant to my nature than that religion, and still I cannot
  recognize myself since I met Lygia. Is it enchantment, or love? Circe changed
  people&rsquo;s bodies by touching them, but my soul has been changed. No one
  but Lygia could have done that, or rather Lygia through that wonderful
  religion which she professes. When I returned to my house from the
  Christians, no one was waiting for me. The slaves thought that I was in
  Beneventum, and would not return soon; hence there was disorder in the house.
  I found the slaves drunk, and a feast, which they were giving themselves, in
  my triclinium. They had more thought of seeing death than me, and would have
  been less terrified by it. Thou knowest with what a firm hand I hold my
  house; all to the last one dropped on their knees, and some fainted from
  terror. But dost thou know how I acted? At the first moment I wished to call
  for rods and hot iron, but immediately a kind of shame seized me, and, wilt
  thou lend belief? a species of pity for those wretched people. Among them are
  old slaves whom my grandfather, Marcus Vinicius, brought from the Rhine in
  the time of Augustus. I shut myself up alone in the library, and there came
  stranger thoughts still to my head; namely, that after what I had heard and
  seen among the Christians, it did not become me to act with slaves as I had
  acted hitherto&mdash;that they too were people. For a number of days they
  moved about in mortal terror, in the belief that I was delaying so as to
  invent punishment the more cruel, but I did not punish, and did not punish
  because I was not able. Summoning them on the third day, I said, &rsquo;I
  forgive you; strive then with earnest service to correct your fault!&rsquo;
  They fell on their knees, covering their faces with tears, stretching forth
  their hands with groans, and called me lord and father; but I&mdash;with
  shame do I write this&mdash;was equally moved. It seemed to me that at that
  moment I was looking at the sweet face of Lygia, and her eyes filled with
  tears, thanking me for that act. And, proh pudor! I felt that my lips too
  were moist. Dost know what I will confess to thee? This&mdash;that I cannot
  do without her, that it is ill for me alone, that I am simply unhappy, and
  that my sadness is greater than thou wilt admit. But, as to my slaves, one
  thing arrested my attention. The forgiveness which they received not only did
  not make them insolent, not only did not weaken discipline, but never had
  fear roused them to such ready service as has gratitude. Not only do they
  serve, but they seem to vie with one another to divine my wishes. I mention
  this to thee because, when, the day before I left the Christians, I told Paul
  that society would fall apart because of his religion, as a cask without
  hoops, he answered, &lsquo;Love is a stronger hoop than fear.&rsquo; And now
  I see that in certain cases his opinion may be right. I have verified it also
  with references to clients, who, learning of my return, hurried to salute me.
  Thou knowest that I have never been penurious with them; but my father acted
  haughtily with clients on principle, and taught me to treat them in like
  manner. But when I saw their worn mantles and hungry faces, I had a feeling
  something like compassion. I gave command to bring them food, and conversed
  besides with them,&mdash;called some by name, some I asked about their wives
  and children,&mdash;and again in the eyes before me I saw tears; again it
  seemed to me that Lygia saw what I was doing, that she praised and was
  delighted. Is my mind beginning to wander, or is love confusing my feelings?
  I cannot tell. But this I do know; I have a continual feeling that she is
  looking at me from a distance, and I am afraid to do aught that might trouble
  or offend her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it is, Caius! but they have changed my soul, and sometimes I
  feel well for that reason. At times again I am tormented with the thought,
  for I fear that my manhood and energy are taken from me; that, perhaps, I am
  useless, not only for counsel, for judgment, for feasts, but for war even.
  These are undoubted enchantments! And to such a degree am I changed that I
  tell thee this, too, which came to my head when I lay wounded: that if Lygia
  were like Nigidia, Poppæa, Crispinilla, and our divorced women, if she were
  as vile, as pitiless, and as cheap as they, I should not love her as I do at
  present. But since I love her for that which divides us, thou wilt divine
  what a chaos is rising in my soul, in what darkness I live, how it is that I
  cannot see certain roads before me, and how far I am from knowing what to
  begin. If life may be compared to a spring, in my spring disquiet flows
  instead of water. I live through the hope that I shall see her, perhaps, and
  sometimes it seems to me that I shall see her surely. But what will happen to
  me in a year or two years, I know not, and cannot divine. I shall not leave
  Rome. I could not endure the society of the Augustians; and besides, the one
  solace in my sadness and disquiet is the thought that I am near Lygia, that
  through Glaucus the physician, who promised to visit me, or through Paul of
  Tarsus, I can learn something of her at times. No; I would not leave Rome,
  even were ye to offer me the government of Egypt. Know also, that I have
  ordered the sculptor to make a stone monument for Gulo, whom I slew in anger.
  Too late did it come to my mind that he had carried me in his arms, and was
  the first to teach me how to put an arrow on a bow. I know not why it was
  that a recollection of him rose in me which was sorrow and reproach. If what
  I write astonish thee, I reply that it astonishes me no less, but I write
  pure truth.&mdash;Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">VINICUS received no answer to this letter. Petronius did not
  write, thinking evidently that Cæsar might command a return to Rome any day.
  In fact, news of it was spread in the city, and roused great delight in the
  hearts of the rabble, eager for games with gifts of grain and olives, great
  supplies of which had been accumulated in Ostia. Helius, Nero&rsquo;s
  freedman, announced at last the return in the Senate. But Nero, having
  embarked with his court on ships at Misenum, returned slowly, disembarking at
  coast towns for rest, or exhibitions in theatres. He remained between ten and
  twenty days in Minturna, and even thought to return to Naples and wait there
  for spring, which was earlier than usual, and warm. During all this time
  Vinicius lived shut up in his house, thinking of Lygia, and all those new
  things which occupied his soul, and brought to it ideas and feelings foreign
  to it thus far. He saw, from time to time, only Glaucus the physician, every
  one of whose visits delighted him, for he could converse with the man about
  Lygia. Glaucus knew not, it is true, where she had found refuge, but he gave
  assurance that the elders were protecting her with watchful care. Once too,
  when moved by the sadness of Vinicius, he told him that Peter had blamed
  Crispus for reproaching Lygia with her love. The young patrician, hearing
  this, grew pale from emotion. He had thought more than once that Lygia was
  not indifferent to him, but he fell into frequent doubt and uncertainty. Now
  for the first time he heard the confirmation of his desires and hopes from
  strange lips, and, besides, those of a Christian. At the first moment of
  gratitude he wished to run to Peter. When he learned, however, that he was
  not in the city, but teaching in the neighborhood, he implored Glaucus to
  accompany him thither, promising to make liberal gifts to the poor community.
  It seemed to him, too, that if Lygia loved him, all obstacles were thereby
  set aside, as he was ready at any moment to honor Christ. Glaucus, though he
  urged him persistently to receive baptism, would not venture to assure him
  that he would gain Lygia at once, and said that it was necessary to desire
  the religion for its own sake, through love of Christ, not for other objects.
  &ldquo;One must have a Christian soul, too,&rdquo; said he. And Vinicius,
  though every obstacle angered him, had begun to understand that Glaucus, as a
  Christian, said what he ought to say. He had not become clearly conscious
  that one of the deepest changes in his nature was this,&mdash;that formerly
  he had measured people and things only by his own selfishness, but now he was
  accustoming himself gradually to the thought that other eyes might see
  differently, other hearts feel differently, and that justice did not mean
  always the same as personal profit.</p>

  <p>He wished often to see Paul of Tarsus, whose discourse made him curious
  and disturbed him. He arranged in his mind arguments to overthrow his
  teaching, he resisted him in thought; still he wished to see him and to hear
  him. Paul, however, had gone to Aricium, and, since the visits of Glaucus had
  become rarer, Vinicius was in perfect solitude. He began again to run through
  back streets adjoining the Subura, and narrow lanes of the Trans-Tiber, in
  the hope that even from a distance he might see Lygia. When even that hope
  failed him, weariness and impatience began to rise in his heart. At last the
  time came when his former nature was felt again mightily, like that onrush of
  a wave to the shore from which it had receded. It seemed to him that he had
  been a fool to no purpose, that he had stuffed his head with things which
  brought sadness, that he ought to accept from life what it gives. He resolved
  to forget Lygia, or at least to seek pleasure and the use of things aside
  from her. He felt that this trial, however, was the last, and he threw
  himself into it with all the blind energy of impulse peculiar to him. Life
  itself seemed to urge him to this course.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Appian Way. From a painting by G. Boulanger.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The city, torpid and depopulated by winter, began to revive with hope of
  the near coming of Cæsar. A solemn reception was in waiting for him.
  Meanwhile spring was there; the snow on the Alban Hills had vanished under
  the breath of winds from Africa. Grass-plots in the gardens were covered with
  violets. The Forums and the Campus Martius were filled with people warmed by
  a sun of growing heat. Along the Appian Way, the usual place for drives
  outside the city, a movement of richly ornamented chariots had begun.
  Excursions were made to the Alban Hills. Youthful women, under pretext of
  worshipping Juno in Lanuvium, or Diana in Aricia, left home to seek
  adventures, society, meetings, and pleasure beyond the city. Here Vinicius
  saw one day among lordly chariots the splendid car of Chrysothemis, preceded
  by two Molossian dogs; it was surrounded by a crowd of young men and by old
  senators, whose position detained them in the city. Chrysothemis, driving
  four Corsican ponies herself, scattered smiles round about, and light strokes
  of a golden whip; but when she saw Vinicius she reined in her horses, took
  him into her car, and then to a feast at her house, which lasted all night.
  At that feast Vinicius drank so much that he did not remember when they took
  him home; he recollected, however, that when Chrysothemis mentioned Lygia he
  was offended, and, being drunk, emptied a goblet of Falernian on her head.
  When he thought of this in soberness, he was angrier still. But a day later
  Chrysothemis, forgetting evidently the injury, visited him at his house, and
  took him to the Appian Way a second time. Then she supped at his house, and
  confessed that not only Petronius, but his lute-player, had grown tedious to
  her long since, and that her heart was free now. They appeared together for a
  week, but the relation did not promise permanence. After the Falernian
  incident, however, Lygia&rsquo;s name was never mentioned, but Vinicius could
  not free himself from thoughts of her. He had the feeling always that her
  eyes were looking at his face, and that feeling filled him, as it were, with
  fear. He suffered, and could not escape the thought that he was saddening
  Lygia, or the regret which that thought roused in him. After the first scene
  of jealousy which Chrysothemis made because of two Syrian damsels whom he
  purchased, he let her go in rude fashion. He did not cease at once from
  pleasure and license, it is true, but he followed them out of spite, as it
  were, toward Lygia. At last he saw that the thought of her did not leave him
  for an instant; that she was the one cause of his evil activity as well as
  his good; and that really nothing in the world occupied him except her.
  Disgust, and then weariness, mastered him. Pleasure had grown loathsome, and
  left mere reproaches. It seemed to him that he was wretched, and this last
  feeling filled him with measureless astonishment, for formerly he recognized
  as good everything which pleased him. Finally, he lost freedom,
  self-confidence, and fell into perfect torpidity, from which even the news of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s coming could not rouse him. Nothing touched him, and he did not
  visit Petronius till the latter sent an invitation and his litter.</p>

  <p>On seeing his uncle, though greeted with gladness, he replied to his
  questions unwillingly; but his feelings and thoughts, repressed for a long
  time, burst forth at last, and flowed from his mouth in a torrent of words.
  Once more he told in detail the history of his search for Lygia, his life
  among the Christians, everything which he had heard and seen there,
  everything which had passed through his head and heart; and finally he
  complained that he had fallen into a chaos, in which were lost composure and
  the gift of distinguishing and judging. Nothing, he said, attracted him,
  nothing was pleasing; he did not know what to hold to, nor how to act. He was
  ready both to honor and persecute Christ; he understood the loftiness of His
  teaching, but he felt also an irresistible repugnance to it. He understood
  that, even should he possess Lygia, he would not possess her completely, for
  he would have to share her with Christ. Finally, he was living as if not
  living,&mdash;without hope, without a morrow, without belief in happiness;
  around him was darkness in which he was groping for an exit, and could not
  find it.</p>

  <p>Petronius, during this narrative, looked at his changed face, at his
  hands, which while speaking he stretched forth in a strange manner, as if
  actually seeking a road in the darkness, and he fell to thinking. All at once
  he rose, and, approaching Vinicius, caught with his fingers the hair above
  his ear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost know,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;that thou hast gray hairs on thy
  temple?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have,&rdquo; answered Vinicius; &ldquo;I should not be
  astonished were all my hair to grow white soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence followed. Petronius was a man of sense, and more than once he
  meditated on the soul of man and on life. In general, life, in the society in
  which they both lived, might be happy or unhappy externally, but internally
  it was at rest. Just as a thunderbolt or an earthquake might overturn a
  temple, so might misfortune crush a life. In itself, however, it was composed
  of simple and harmonious lines, free of complication. But there was something
  else in the words of Vinicius, and Petronius stood for the first time before
  a series of spiritual snarls which no one had straightened out hitherto. He
  was sufficiently a man of reason to feel their importance, but with all his
  quickness he could not answer the questions put to him. After a long silence,
  he said at last,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These must be enchantments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I too have thought so,&rdquo; answered Vinicius; &ldquo;more than
  once it seemed to me that we were enchanted, both of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if thou,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;were to go, for example,
  to the priests of Serapis? Among them, as among priests in general, there are
  many deceivers, no doubt; but there are others who have reached wonderful
  secrets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said this, however, without conviction and with an uncertain voice, for
  he himself felt how empty and even ridiculous that counsel must seem on his
  lips.</p>

  <p>Vinicius rubbed his forehead, and said: &ldquo;Enchantments! I have seen
  sorcerers who employed unknown and subterranean powers to their personal
  profit; I have seen those who used them to the harm of their enemies. But
  these Christians live in poverty, forgive their enemies, preach submission,
  virtue, and mercy; what profit could they get from enchantments, and why
  should they use them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius was angry that his acuteness could find no reply; not wishing,
  however, to acknowledge this, he said, so as to offer an answer of some
  kind,&mdash;&ldquo;That is a new sect.&rdquo; After a while he added:
  &ldquo;By the divine dweller in Paphian groves, how all that injures life!
  Thou wilt admire the goodness and virtue of those people; but I tell thee
  that they are bad, for they are enemies of life, as are diseases, and death
  itself. As things are, we have enough of these enemies; we do not need the
  Christians in addition. Just count them: diseases, Cæsar, Tigellinus,
  Cæsar&rsquo;s poetry, cobblers who govern the descendants of ancient
  Quirites, freedmen who sit in the Senate. By Castor! there is enough of this.
  That is a destructive and disgusting sect. Hast thou tried to shake thyself
  out of this sadness, and make some little use of life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have tried,&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, traitor!&rdquo; said Petronius, laughing; &ldquo;news spreads
  quickly through slaves; thou hast seduced from me Chrysothemis!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius waved his hand in disgust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In every case I thank thee,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;I will
  send her a pair of slippers embroidered with pearls. In my language of a
  lover that means, &lsquo;Walk away.&rsquo; I owe thee a double
  gratitude,&mdash;first, thou didst not accept Eunice; second, thou hast freed
  me from Chrysothemis. Listen to me! Thou seest before thee a man who has
  risen early, bathed, feasted, possessed Chrysothemis, written satires, and
  even at times interwoven prose with verses, but who has been as wearied as
  Cæsar, and often unable to unfetter himself from gloomy thoughts. And dost
  thou know why that was so? It was because I sought at a distance that which
  was near. A beautiful woman is worth her weight always in gold; but if she
  loves in addition, she has simply no price. Such a one thou wilt not buy with
  the riches of Verres. I say now to myself as follows: I will fill my life
  with happiness, as a goblet with the foremost wine which the earth has
  produced, and I will drink till my hand becomes powerless and my lips grow
  pale. What will come, I care not; and this is my latest
  philosophy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast proclaimed it always; there is nothing new in
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is substance, which was lacking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he called Eunice, who entered dressed in white
  drapery,&mdash;the former slave no longer, but as it were a goddess of love
  and happiness.</p>

  <p>Petronius opened his arms to her, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this she ran up to him, and, sitting on his knee, surrounded his neck
  with her arms, and placed her head on his breast. Vinicius saw how a
  reflection of purple began to cover her cheeks, how her eyes melted gradually
  in mist. They formed a wonderful group of love and happiness. Petronius
  stretched his hand to a flat vase standing at one side on a table, and,
  taking a whole handful of violets, covered with them the head, bosom, and
  robe of Eunice; then he pushed the tunic from her arms, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Happy he who, like me, has found love enclosed in such a form! At
  times it seems to me that we are a pair of gods. Look thyself! Has
  Praxiteles, or Miron, or Skopas, or Lysias even, created more wonderful
  lines? Or does there exist in Paros or in Pentelicus such marble as
  this,&mdash;warm, rosy, and full of love? There are people who kiss off the
  edges of vases, but I prefer to look for pleasure where it may be found
  really.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He began to pass his lips along her shoulders and neck. She was penetrated
  with a quivering; her eyes now closed, now opened, with an expression of
  unspeakable delight. Petronius after a while raised her exquisite head, and
  said, turning to Vinicius,&mdash;&ldquo;But think now, what are thy gloomy
  Christians in comparison with this? And if thou understand not the
  difference, go thy way to them. But this sight will cure thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius distended his nostrils, through which entered the odor of
  violets, which filled the whole chamber, and he grew pale; for he thought
  that if he could have passed his lips along Lygia&rsquo;s shoulders in that
  way, it would have been a kind of sacrilegious delight so great that let the
  world vanish afterward! But accustomed now to a quick perception of that
  which took place in him, he noticed that at that moment he was thinking of
  Lygia, and of her only.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eunice,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;give command, thou divine
  one, to prepare garlands for our heads and a meal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When she had gone out he turned to Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I offered to make her free, but knowest thou what she
  answered?&mdash;&rsquo;I would rather be thy slave than Cæsar&rsquo;s
  wife!&rsquo; And she would not consent. I freed her then without her
  knowledge. The pretor favored me by not requiring her presence. But she does
  not know that she is free, as also she does not know that this house and all
  my jewels, excepting the gems, will belong to her in case of my death.&rdquo;
  He rose and walked through the room, and said: &ldquo;Love changes some more,
  others less, but it has changed even me. Once I loved the odor of verbenas;
  but as Eunice prefers violets, I like them now beyond all other flowers, and
  since spring came we breathe only violets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he stopped before Vinicius and inquired,&mdash;&ldquo;But as to thee,
  dost thou keep always to nard?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me peace!&rdquo; answered the young man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wished thee to see Eunice, and I mentioned her to thee, because
  thou, perhaps, art seeking also at a distance that which is near. Maybe for
  thee too is beating, somewhere in the chambers of thy slaves, a true and
  simple heart. Apply such a balsam to thy wounds. Thou sayest that Lygia loves
  thee? Perhaps she does. But what kind of love is that which abdicates? Is not
  the meaning this,&mdash;that there is another force stronger than her love?
  No, my dear, Lygia is not Eunice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All is one torment merely,&rdquo; answered Vinicius. &ldquo;I saw
  thee kissing Eunice&rsquo;s shoulders, and I thought then that if Lygia would
  lay hers bare to me I should not care if the ground opened under us next
  moment. But at the very thought of such an act a certain dread seized me, as
  if I had attacked some vestal or wished to defile a divinity. Lygia is not
  Eunice, but I understand the difference not in thy way. Love has changed thy
  nostrils, and thou preferrest violets to verbenas; but it has changed my
  soul: hence, in spite of my misery and desire, I prefer Lygia to be what she
  is rather than to be like others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case no injustice is done thee. But I do not understand the
  position.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; answered Vinicius, feverishly. &ldquo;We
  understand each other no longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Another moment of silence followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Hades swallow thy Christians!&rdquo; exclaimed Petronius.
  &ldquo;They have filled thee with disquiet, and destroyed thy sense of life.
  May Hades devour them! Thou art mistaken in thinking that their religion is
  good, for good is what gives people happiness, namely, beauty, love, power;
  but these they call vanity. Thou art mistaken in this, that they are just;
  for if we pay good for evil, what shall we pay for good? And besides, if we
  pay the same for one and the other, why are people to be good?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, the pay is not the same; but according to their teaching it
  begins in a future life, which is without limit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not enter into that question, for we shall see hereafter if it
  be possible to see anything without eyes. Meanwhile they are simply
  incompetents. Ursus strangled Croton because he has limbs of bronze; but
  these are mopes, and the future cannot belong to mopes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For them life begins with death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which is as if one were to say, &lsquo;Day begins with
  night.&rsquo; Hast thou the intent to carry off Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I cannot pay her evil for good, and I swore that I would
  not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou intend to accept the religion of Christ?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to do so, but my nature cannot endure it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But wilt thou be able to forget Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then travel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment the slaves announced that the repast was ready; but
  Petronius, to whom it seemed that he had fallen on a good thought, said, on
  the way to the triclinium,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou has ridden over a part of the
  world, but only as a soldier hastening to his place of destination, and
  without halting by the way. Go with us to Achæa. Cæsar has not given up the
  journey. He will stop everywhere on the way, sing, receive crowns, plunder
  temples, and return as a triumphator to Italy. That will resemble somewhat a
  journey of Bacchus and Apollo in one person. Augustians, male and female, a
  thousand citharæ. By Castor! that will be worth witnessing, for hitherto the
  world has not seen anything like it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he placed himself on the couch before the table, by the side of
  Eunice; and when the slaves put a wreath of anemones on his head, he
  continued,&mdash;&ldquo;What hast thou seen in Corbulo&rsquo;s service?
  Nothing. Hast thou seen the Grecian temples thoroughly, as I have,&mdash;I
  who was passing more than two years from the hands of one guide to those of
  another? Hast thou been in Rhodes to examine the site of the Colossus? Hast
  thou seen in Panopeus, in Phocis, the clay from which Prometheus shaped man;
  or in Sparta the eggs laid by Leda; or in Athens the famous Sarmatian armor
  made of horse-hoofs; or in Euboea the ship of Agamemnon; or the cup for whose
  pattern the left breast of Helen served? Hast thou seen Alexandria, Memphis,
  the Pyramids, the hair which Isis tore from her head in grief for Osiris?
  Hast thou heard the shout of Memnon? The world is wide; everything does not
  end at the Trans-Tiber! I will accompany Cæsar, and when he returns I will
  leave him and go to Cyprus; for it is the wish of this golden-haired goddess
  of mine that we offer doves together to the divinity in Paphos, and thou must
  know that whatever she wishes must happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am thy slave,&rdquo; said Eunice.</p>

  <p>He rested his garlanded head on her bosom, and said with a
  smile,&mdash;&ldquo;Then I am the slave of a slave. I admire thee, divine
  one, from feet to head!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he said to Vinicius: &ldquo;Come with us to Cyprus. But first
  remember that thou must see Cæsar. It is bad that thou hast not been with him
  yet; Tigellinus is ready to use this to thy disadvantage. He has no personal
  hatred for thee, it is true; but he cannot love thee, even because thou art
  my sister&rsquo;s son. We shall say that thou wert sick. We must think over
  what thou art to answer should he ask thee about Lygia. It will be best to
  wave thy hand and say that she was with thee till she wearied thee. He will
  understand that. Tell him also that sickness kept thee at home; that thy
  fever was increased by disappointment at not being able to visit Naples and
  hear his song; that thou wert assisted to health only by the hope of hearing
  him. Fear no exaggeration. Tigellinus promises to invent, not only something
  great for Cæsar, but something enormous. I am afraid that he will undermine
  me; I am afraid too of thy disposition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;that there are people
  who have no fear of Cæsar, and who live as calmly as if he were non-
  existent?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know whom thou hast in mind&mdash;the Christians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; they alone. But our life,&mdash;what is it if not unbroken
  terror?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not mention thy Christians. They fear not Cæsar, because he has
  not even heard of them perhaps; and in every case he knows nothing of them,
  and they concern him as much as withered leaves. But I tell thee that they
  are incompetents. Thou feelest this thyself; if thy nature is repugnant to
  their teaching, it is just because thou feelest their incompetence. Thou art
  a man of other clay; so trouble not thyself or me with them. We shall be able
  to live and die, and what more they will be able to do is unknown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These words struck Vinicius; and when he returned home, he began to think
  that in truth, perhaps, the goodness and charity of Christians was a proof of
  their incompetience of soul. It seemed to him that people of strength and
  temper could not forgive thus. It came to his head that this must be the real
  cause of the repulsion which his Roman soul felt toward their teaching.
  &ldquo;We shall be able to live and die!&rdquo; said Petronius. As to them,
  they know only how to forgive, and understand neither true love nor true
  hatred.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Cæsar, on returning to Rome, was angry because he had
  returned, and after some days was filled anew with a wish to visit Achæa. He
  even issued an edict in which he declared that his absence would be short,
  and that public affairs would not be exposed to detriment because of it. In
  company with Augustians, among whom was Vinicius, he repaired to the Capitol
  to make offerings to the gods for an auspicious journey. But on the second
  day, when he visited the temple of Vesta, an event took place which changed
  all his projects. Nero feared the gods, though he did not believe in them; he
  feared especially the mysterious Vesta, who filled him with such awe that at
  sight of the divinity and the sacred fire his hair rose on a sudden from
  terror, his teeth chattered, a shiver ran through his limbs, and he dropped
  into the arms of Vinicius, who happened there behind him. He was borne out of
  the temple at once, and conveyed to the Palatine, where he recovered soon,
  but did not leave the bed for that day. He declared, moreover, to the great
  astonishment of those present, that he deferred his journey, since the
  divinity had warned him secretly against haste. An hour later it was
  announced throughout Rome that Cæsar, seeing the gloomy faces of the
  citizens, and moved by love for them, as a father for his children, would
  remain to share their lot and their pleasures. The people, rejoiced at this
  decision, and certain also that they would not miss games and a distribution
  of wheat, assembled in crowds before the gates of the Palatine, and raised
  shouts in honor of the divine Cæsar, who interrupted the play at dice with
  which he was amusing himself with Augustians, and said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there was need to defer the journey. Egypt, and predicted
  dominion over the Orient, cannot escape me; hence Achæa, too, will not be
  lost. I will give command to cut through the isthmus of Corinth; I will rear
  such monuments in Egypt that the pyramids will seem childish toys in
  comparison; I will have a sphinx built seven times greater than that which is
  gazing into the desert outside Memphis; but I will command that it have my
  face. Coming ages will speak only of that monument and of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With thy verses thou hast reared a monument to thyself already, not
  seven, but thrice seven, times greater than the pyramid of Cheops,&rdquo;
  said Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But with my song?&rdquo; inquired Nero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! if men could only build for thee a statue, like that of Memnon,
  to call with thy voice at sunrise! For all ages to come the seas adjoining
  Egypt would swarm with ships in which crowds from the three parts of the
  world would be lost in listening to thy song.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! who can do that?&rdquo; said Nero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou canst give command to cut out of basalt thyself driving a
  quadriga.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True! I will do that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt bestow a gift on humanity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Egypt I will marry the Moon, who is now a widow, and I shall be
  a god really.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou wilt give us stars for wives; we will make a new
  constellation, which will be called the constellation of Nero. But do thou
  marry Vitelius to the Nile, so that he may beget hippopotamuses. Give the
  desert to Tigellinus, he will be king of the jackals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what dost thou predestine to me?&rdquo; inquired Vatinius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apis bless thee! Thou didst arrange such splendid games in
  Beneventum that I cannot wish thee ill. Make a pair of boots for the sphinx,
  whose paws must grow numb during night-dews; after that thou will make
  sandals for the Colossi which form the alleys before the temples. Each one
  will find there a fitting occupation. Domitius Afer, for example, will be
  treasurer, since he is known for his honesty. I am glad, Cæsar, when thou art
  dreaming of Egypt, and I am saddened because thou hast deferred thy plan of a
  journey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy mortal eyes saw nothing, for the deity becomes invisible to
  whomever it wishes,&rdquo; said Nero. &ldquo;Know that when I was in the
  temple of Vesta she herself stood near me, and whispered in my ear,
  &rsquo;Defer the journey.&rsquo; That happened so unexpectedly that I was
  terrified, though for such an evident care of the gods for me I should be
  thankful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We were all terrified,&rdquo; said Tigellinus, &ldquo;and the
  vestal Rubria fainted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubria!&rdquo; said Nero; &ldquo;what a snowy neck she
  has!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But she blushed at sight of the divine Cæsar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True! I noticed that myself. That is wonderful. There is something
  divine in every vestal, and Rubria is very beautiful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said he, after a moment&rsquo;s meditation,
  &ldquo;why people fear Vesta more than other gods. What does this mean?
  Though I am the chief priest, fear seized me to-day. I remember only that I
  was falling back, and should have dropped to the ground had not some one
  supported me. Who was it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, thou &lsquo;stern Mars&rsquo;! Why wert thou not in Beneventum?
  They told me that thou wert ill, and indeed thy face is changed. But I heard
  that Croton wished to kill thee? Is that true?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is, and he broke my arm; but I defended myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With a broken arm?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A certain barbarian helped me; he was stronger than
  Croton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero looked at him with astonishment. &ldquo;Stronger than Croton? Art
  thou jesting? Croton was the strongest of men, but now here is Syphax from
  Ethiopia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell thee, Cæsar, what I saw with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is that pearl? Has he not become king of Nemi?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell, Cæsar. I lost sight of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou knowest not even of what people he is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had a broken arm, and could not inquire for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seek him, and find him for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will occupy myself with that,&rdquo; said Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>But Nero spoke further to Vinicius: &ldquo;I thank thee for having
  supported me; I might have broken my head by a fall. On a time thou wert a
  good companion, but campaigning and service with Corbulo have made thee wild
  in some way; I see thee rarely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that maiden too narrow in the hips, with whom thou wert in
  love,&rdquo; asked he after a while, &ldquo;and whom I took from Aulus for
  thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was confused, but Petronius came to his aid at that moment.
  &ldquo;I will lay a wager, lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that he has
  forgotten. Dost thou see his confusion? Ask him how many of them there were
  since that time, and I will not give assurance of his power to answer. The
  Vinicius are good soldiers, but still better gamecocks. They need whole
  flocks. Punish him for that, lord, by not inviting him to the feast which
  Tigellinus promises to arrange in thy honor on the pond of
  Agrippa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not do that. I trust, Tigellinus, that flocks of beauty will
  not be lacking there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could the Graces be absent where Amor will be present?&rdquo;
  answered Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weariness tortures me,&rdquo; said Nero. &ldquo;I have remained in
  Rome at the will of the goddess, but I cannot endure the city. I will go to
  Antium. I am stifled in these narrow streets, amid these tumble-down houses,
  amid these alleys. Foul air flies even here to my house and my gardens. Oh,
  if an earthquake would destroy Rome, if some angry god would level it to the
  earth! I would show how a city should be built, which is the head of the
  world and my capital.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar,&rdquo; answered Tigellinus, &ldquo;thou sayest, &rsquo;If
  some angry god would destroy the city,&rsquo;&mdash;is it so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is! What then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But art thou not a god?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero waved his hand with an expression of weariness, and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;We shall see thy work on the pond of Agrippa. Afterward I
  go to Antium. Ye are all little, hence do not understand that I need immense
  things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he closed his eyes, giving to understand in that way that he needed
  rest. In fact, the Augustians were beginning to depart. Petronius went out
  with Vinicius, and said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art invited, then, to share
  in the amusement. Bronzebeard has renounced the journey, but he will be
  madder than ever; he has fixed himself in the city as in his own house. Try
  thou, too, to find in these madnesses amusement and forgetfulness. Well! we
  have conquered the world, and have a right to amuse ourselves. Thou, Marcus,
  art a very comely fellow, and to that I ascribe in part the weakness which I
  have for thee. By the Ephesian Diana! if thou couldst see thy joined brows,
  and thy face in which the ancient blood of the Quirites is evident! Others
  near thee looked like freedmen. True! were it not for that mad religion,
  Lygia would be in thy house to-day. Attempt once more to prove to me that
  they are not enemies of life and mankind. They have acted well toward thee,
  hence thou mayst be grateful to them; but in thy place I should detest that
  religion, and seek pleasure where I could find it. Thou art a comely fellow,
  I repeat, and Rome is swarming with divorced women.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder only that all this does not torture thee yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who has told thee that it does not? It tortures me this long time,
  but I am not of thy years. Besides, I have other attachments which are
  lacking thee. I love books, thou hast no love for them; I love poetry, which
  annoys thee; I love pottery, gems, a multitude of things, at which thou dost
  not look; I have a pain in my loins, which thou hast not; and, finally, I
  have found Eunice, but thou hast found nothing similar. For me, it is
  pleasant in my house, among masterpieces; of thee I can never make a man of
  æsthetic feeling. I know that in life I shall never find anything beyond what
  I have found; thou thyself knowest not that thou art hoping yet continually,
  and seeking. If death were to visit thee, with all thy courage and sadness,
  thou wouldst die with astonishment that it was necessary to leave the world;
  but I should accept death as a necessity, with the conviction that there is
  no fruit in the world which I have not tasted. I do not hurry, neither shall
  I loiter; I shall try merely to be joyful to the end. There are cheerful
  sceptics in the world. For me, the Stoics are fools; but stoicism tempers
  men, at least, while thy Christians bring sadness into the world, which in
  life is the same as rain in nature. Dost thou know what I have learned? That
  during the festivities which Tigellinus will arrange at the pond of Agrippa,
  there will be lupanaria, and in them women from the first houses of Rome.
  Will there be not even one sufficiently beautiful to console thee? There will
  be maidens, too, appearing in society for the first time&mdash;as nymphs.
  Such is our Roman Cæsardom! The air is mild already; the midday breeze will
  warm the water and not bring pimples on naked bodies. And thou, Narcissus,
  know this, that there will not be one to refuse thee,&mdash;not one, even
  though she be a vestal virgin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius began to strike his head with his palm, like a man occupied
  eternally with one thought.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should need luck to find such a one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And who did this for thee, if not the Christians? But people whose
  standard is a cross cannot be different. Listen to me: Greece was beautiful,
  and created wisdom; we created power; and what, to thy thinking, can this
  teaching create? If thou know, explain; for, by Pollux! I cannot divine
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art afraid, it seems, lest I become a Christian,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that thou hast spoiled life for thyself. If thou canst
  not be a Grecian, be a Roman; possess and enjoy. Our madnesses have a certain
  sense, for there is in them a kind of thought of our own. I despise
  Bronzebeard, because he is a Greek buffoon. If he held himself a Roman, I
  should recognize that he was right in permitting himself madness. Promise me
  that if thou find some Christian on returning home, thou wilt show thy tongue
  to him. If he be Glaucus the physician, he will not wonder.&mdash;Till we
  meet on the pond of Agrippa.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Pretorians surrounded the groves on the banks of the pond of
  Agrippa, lest over-numerous throngs of spectators might annoy Cæsar and his
  guests; though it was said that everything in Rome distinguished for wealth,
  beauty, or intellect was present at that feast, which had no equal in the
  history of the city. Tigellinus wished to recompense Cæsar for the deferred
  journey to Achæa, to surpass all who had ever feasted Nero, and prove that no
  man could entertain as he could. With this object in view, while with Cæsar
  in Naples, and later in Beneventum, he had made preparations and sent orders
  to bring from the remotest regions of the earth beasts, birds, rare fish, and
  plants, not omitting vessels and cloths, which were to enhance the splendor
  of the feast. The revenues of whole provinces went to satisfy mad projects;
  but the powerful favorite had no need to hesitate. His influence grew daily.
  Tigellinus was not dearer than others to Nero yet, perhaps, but he was
  becoming more and more indispensable. Petronius surpassed him infinitely in
  polish, intellect, wit; in conversation he knew better how to amuse Cæsar:
  but to his misfortune he surpassed in conversation Cæsar himself, hence he
  roused his jealousy; moreover he could not be an obedient instrument in
  everything, and Cæsar feared his opinion when there were questions in matters
  of taste. But before Tigellinus, Nero never felt any restraint. The very
  title, Arbiter Elegantiarum, which had been given to Petronius, annoyed
  Nero&rsquo;s vanity, for who had the right to bear that title but himself?
  Tigellinus had sense enough to know his own deficiencies; and seeing that he
  could not compete with Petronius, Lucan, or others distinguished by birth,
  talents, or learning, he resolved to extinguish them by the suppleness of his
  services, and above all by such a magnificence that the imagination of Nero
  himself would be struck by it. He had arranged to give the feast on a
  gigantic raft, framed of gilded timbers. The borders of this raft were decked
  with splendid shells found in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, shells
  brilliant with the colors of pearls and the rainbow. The banks of the pond
  were covered with groups of palm, with groves of lotus, and blooming roses.
  In the midst of these were hidden fountains of perfumed water, statues of
  gods and goddesses, and gold or silver cages filled with birds of various
  colors. In the centre of the raft rose an immense tent, or rather, not to
  hide the feasters, only the roof of a tent, made of Syrian purple, resting on
  silver columns; under it were gleaming, like suns, tables prepared for the
  guests, loaded with Alexandrian glass, crystal, and vessels simply beyond
  price,&mdash;the plunder of Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor. The raft, which
  because of plants accumulated on it had the appearance of an island and a
  garden, was joined by cords of gold and purple to boats shaped like fish,
  swans, mews, and flamingoes, in which sat at painted oars naked rowers of
  both sexes, with forms and features of marvellous beauty, their hair dressed
  in Oriental fashion, or gathered in golden nets. When Nero arrived at the
  main raft with Poppæa and the Augustians, and sat beneath the purple
  tent-roof, the oars struck the water, the boats moved, the golden cords
  stretched, and the raft with the feast and the guests began to move and
  describe circles on the pond. Other boats surrounded it, and other smaller
  rafts, filled with women playing on citharæ and harps, women whose rosy
  bodies on the blue background of the sky and the water and in the reflections
  from golden instruments seemed to absorb that blue and those reflections, and
  to change and bloom like flowers.</p>

  <p>From the groves at the banks, from fantastic buildings reared for that day
  and hidden among thickets, were heard music and song. The neighborhood
  resounded, the groves resounded; echoes bore around the voices of horns and
  trumpets. Cæsar himself, with Poppæa on one side of him, and Pythagoras on
  the other, was amazed; and more especially when among the boats young slave
  maidens appeared as sirens, and were covered with green network in imitation
  of scales, he did not spare praises on Tigellinus. But he looked at Petronius
  from habit, wishing to learn the opinion of the &ldquo;arbiter,&rdquo; who
  seemed indifferent for a long time, and only when questioned outright,
  answered,&mdash;&ldquo;I judge, lord, that ten thousand naked maidens make
  less impression than one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the &ldquo;floating feast&rdquo; pleased Cæsar, for it was something
  new. Besides, such exquisite dishes were served that the imagination of
  Apicius would have failed at sight of them, and wines of so many kinds that
  Otho, who used to serve eighty, would have hidden under water with shame,
  could he have witnessed the luxury of that feast. Besides women, the
  Augustians sat down at the table, among whom Vinicius excelled all with his
  beauty. Formerly his figure and face indicated too clearly the soldier by
  profession; now mental suffering and the physical pain through which he had
  passed had chiselled his features, as if the delicate hand of a master had
  passed over them. His complexion had lost its former swarthiness, but the
  yellowish gleam of Numidian marble remained on it. His eyes had grown larger
  and more pensive. His body had retained its former powerful outlines, as if
  created for armor; but above the body of a legionary was seen the head of a
  Grecian god, or at least of a refined patrician, at once subtle and splendid.
  Petronius, in saying that none of the ladies of Cæsar&rsquo;s court would be
  able or willing to resist Vinicius, spoke like a man of experience. All gazed
  at him now, not excepting Poppæa, or the vestal virgin Rubria, whom Cæsar
  wished to see at the feast.</p>

  <p>Wines, cooled in mountain snow, soon warmed the hearts and heads of the
  guests. Boats shaped as grasshoppers or butterflies shot forth from the
  bushes at the shore every moment. The blue surface of the pond seemed
  occupied by butterflies. Above the boats here and there flew doves, and other
  birds from India and Africa, fastened with silver and blue threads or
  strings. The sun had passed the greater part of the sky, but the day was warm
  and even hot, though in the beginning of May. The pond heaved from the
  strokes of oars, which beat the water in time with music; but in the air
  there was not the least breath of wind; the groves were motionless, as if
  lost in listening and in gazing at that which was happening on the water. The
  raft circled continually on the pond, bearing guests who were increasingly
  drunk and boisterous.</p>

  <p>The feast had not run half its course yet, when the order in which all sat
  at the table was observed no longer. Cæsar gave the example, for, rising
  himself, he commanded Vinicius, who sat next to Rubria the vestal, to move.
  Nero occupied the place, and began to whisper something in Rubria&rsquo;s
  ear. Vinicius found himself next to Poppæa, who extended her arm and begged
  him to fasten her loosened bracelet. When he did so, with hands trembling
  somewhat, she cast at him from beneath her long lashes a glance as it were of
  modesty, and shook her golden head as if in resistance.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sun, growing larger, ruddier, sank slowly behind the tops of
  the grove; the guests were for the greater part thoroughly intoxicated. The
  raft circled now nearer the shore, on which, among bunches of trees and
  flowers, were seen groups of people, disguised as fauns or satyrs, playing on
  flutes, bagpipes, and drums, with groups of maidens representing nymphs,
  dryads, and hamadryads. Darkness fell at last amid drunken shouts from the
  tent, shouts raised in honor of Luna. Meanwhile the groves were lighted with
  a thousand lamps. From the lupanaria on the shores shone swarms of lights; on
  the terraces appeared new naked groups, formed of the wives and daughters of
  the first Roman houses. These with voice and unrestrained manner began to
  lure partners. The raft touched the shore at last. Cæsar and the Augustians
  vanished in the groves, scattered in lupanaria, in tents hidden in thickets,
  in grottos artificially arranged among fountains and springs. Madness seized
  all; no one knew whither Cæsar had gone; no one knew who was a senator, who a
  knight, who a dancer, who a musician. Satyrs and fauns fell to chasing nymphs
  with shouting. They struck lamps with thyrses to quench them. Darkness
  covered certain parts of the grove. Everywhere, however, laughter and shouts
  were heard, and whispers, and panting breaths. In fact Rome had not seen
  anything like that before.</p>

  <p>Vinicius was not drunk, as he had been at the feast in Nero&rsquo;s
  palace, when Lygia was present; but he was roused and intoxicated by the
  sight of everything done round about, and at last the fever of pleasure
  seized him. Rushing into the forest, he ran, with others, examining who of
  the dryads seemed most beautiful. New flocks of these raced around him every
  moment with shouts and with songs; these flocks were pursued by fauns,
  satyrs, senators, knights, and by sounds of music. Seeing at last a band of
  maidens led by one arrayed as Diana, he sprang to it, intending to examine
  the goddess more closely. All at once the heart sank in his bosom, for he
  thought that in that goddess, with the moon on her forehead, he recognized
  Lygia.</p>

  <p>They encircled him with a mad whirl, and, wishing evidently to incline him
  to follow, rushed away the next moment like a herd of deer. But he stood on
  the spot with beating heart, breathless; for though he saw that the Diana was
  not Lygia, and that at close sight she was not even like her, the too
  powerful impression deprived him of strength. Straightway he was seized by
  such yearning as he had never felt before, and love for Lygia rushed to his
  breast in a new, immense wave. Never had she seemed so dear, pure, and
  beloved as in that forest of madness and frenzied excess. A moment before, he
  himself wished to drink of that cup, and share in that shameless letting
  loose of the senses; now disgust and repugnance possessed him. He felt that
  infamy was stifling him; that his breast needed air and the stars which were
  hidden by the thickets of that dreadful grove. He determined to flee; but
  barely had he moved when before him stood some veiled figure, which placed
  its hands on his shoulders and whispered, flooding his face with burning
  breath, &ldquo;I love thee! Come! no one will see us, hasten!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was roused, as if from a dream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But she leaned her breast on him and insisted,&mdash;&ldquo;Hurry! See how
  lonely it is here, and I love thee! Come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; repeated Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As she said this, she pressed her lips to his through the veil, drawing
  toward her his head at the same time, till at last breath failed the woman
  and she tore her face from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Night of love! night of madness!&rdquo; said she, catching the air
  quickly. &ldquo;Today is free! Thou hast me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But that kiss burned Vinicius; it filled him with disquiet. His soul and
  heart were elsewhere; in the whole world nothing existed for him except
  Lygia. So, pushing back the veiled figure, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whoever thou be, I love another, I do not wish thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remove the veil,&rdquo; said she, lowering her head toward him.</p>

  <p>At that moment the leaves of the nearest myrtle began to rustle; the
  veiled woman vanished like a dream vision, but from a distance her laugh was
  heard, strange in some way, and ominous.</p>

  <p>Petronius stood before Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard and seen,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go from this place,&rdquo; replied Vinicius.</p>

  <p>And they went. They passed the lupanaria gleaming with light, the grove,
  the line of mounted pretorians, and found the litters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go with thee,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>They sat down together. On the road both were silent, and only in the
  atrium of Vinicius&rsquo;s house did Petronius ask,&mdash;&ldquo;Dost thou
  know who that was?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was it Rubria?&rdquo; asked Vinicius, repulsed at the very thought
  that Rubria was a vestal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius lowered his voice. &ldquo;The fire of Vesta was defiled, for
  Rubria was with Cæsar. But with thee was speaking&rdquo;&mdash;and he
  finished in a still lower voice, &ldquo;the divine Augusta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;was unable to hide from Poppæa
  his desire for Rubria; therefore she wished, perhaps, to avenge herself. But
  I hindered you both. Hadst thou recognized the Augusta and refused her, thou
  wouldst have been ruined beyond rescue,&mdash;thou, Lygia, and I,
  perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have enough of Rome, Cæsar, feasts, the Augusta, Tigellinus, and
  all of you!&rdquo; burst out Vinicius. &ldquo;I am stifling. I cannot live
  thus; I cannot. Dost understand me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius, thou art losing sense, judgment, moderation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love only her in this world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This, that I wish no other love. I have no wish for your life, your
  feasts, your shamelessness, your crimes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is taking place in thee? Art thou a Christian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man seized his head with both hands, and repeated, as if in
  despair,&mdash;&ldquo;Not yet! not yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Petronius went home shrugging his shoulders and greatly
  dissatisfied. It was evident to him that he and Vinicius had ceased to
  understand each other, that their souls had separated entirely. Once
  Petronius had immense influence over the young soldier. He had been for him a
  model in everything, and frequently a few ironical words of his sufficed to
  restrain Vinicius or urge him to something. At present there remained nothing
  of that; such was the change that Petronius did not try his former methods,
  feeling that his wit and irony would slip without effect along the new
  principles which love and contact with the uncomprehended society of
  Christians had put in the soul of Vinicius. The veteran sceptic understood
  that he had lost the key to that soul. This knowledge filled him with
  dissatisfaction and even with fear, which was heightened by the events of
  that night. &ldquo;If on the part of the Augusta it is not a passing whim but
  a more enduring desire,&rdquo; thought Petronius, &ldquo;one of two things
  will happen,&mdash;either Vinicius will not resist her, and he may be ruined
  by any accident, or, what is like him to-day, he will resist, and in that
  event he will be ruined certainly, and perhaps I with him, even because I am
  his relative, and because the Augusta, having included a whole family in her
  hatred, will throw the weight of her influence on the side of Tigellinus. In
  this way and that it is bad.&rdquo; Petronius was a man of courage and felt
  no dread of death; but since he hoped nothing from it, he had no wish to
  invite it. After long meditation, he decided at last that it would be better
  and safer to send Vinicius from Rome on a journey. Ah! but if in addition he
  could give him Lygia for the road, he would do so with pleasure. But he hoped
  that it would not be too difficult to persuade him to the journey without
  her. He would spread a report on the Palatine then of Vinicius&rsquo;s
  illness, and remove danger as well from his nephew as himself. The Augusta
  did not know whether she was recognized by Vinicius; she might suppose that
  she was not, hence her vanity had not suffered much so far. But it might be
  different in the future, and it was necessary to avoid peril. Petronius
  wished to gain time, above all; for he understood that once Cæsar set out for
  Achæa, Tigellinus, who comprehended nothing in the domain of art, would
  descend to the second place and lose his influence. In Greece Petronius was
  sure of victory over every opponent.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he determined to watch over Vinicius, and urge him to the
  journey. For a number of days he was ever thinking over this, that if he
  obtained an edict from Cæsar expelling the Christians from Rome, Lygia would
  leave it with the other confessors of Christ, and after her Vinicius too.
  Then there would be no need to persuade him. The thing itself was possible.
  In fact it was not so long since, when the Jews began disturbances out of
  hatred to the Christians, Claudius, unable to distinguish one from the other,
  expelled the Jews. Why should not Nero expel the Christians? There would be
  more room in Rome without them. After that &ldquo;floating feast&rdquo;
  Petronius saw Nero daily, both on the Palatine and in other houses. To
  suggest such an idea was easy, for Nero never opposed suggestions which
  brought harm or ruin to any one. After mature decision Petronius framed a
  whole plan for himself. He would prepare a feast in his own house, and at
  this feast persuade Cæsar to issue an edict. He had even a hope, which was
  not barren, that Cæsar would confide the execution of the edict to him. He
  would send out Lygia with all the consideration proper to the mistress of
  Vinicius to Baiæ, for instance, and let them love and amuse themselves there
  with Christianity as much as they liked.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he visited Vinicius frequently, first, because he could not,
  despite all his Roman selfishness, rid himself of attachment to the young
  tribune, and second, because he wished to persuade him to the journey.
  Vinicius feigned sickness, and did not show himself on the Palatine, where
  new plans appeared every day. At last Petronius heard from Cæsar&rsquo;s own
  lips that three days from then he would go to Antium without fail. Next
  morning he went straightway to inform Vinicius, who showed him a list of
  persons invited to Antium, which list one of Cæsar&rsquo;s freedmen had
  brought him that morning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is on it; so is thine,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Thou wilt
  find the same at thy house on returning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were I not among the invited,&rdquo; replied Petronius, &ldquo;it
  would mean that I must die; I do not expect that to happen before the journey
  to Achæa. I shall be too useful to Nero. Barely have we come to Rome,&rdquo;
  said he, on looking at the list, &ldquo;when we must leave again, and drag
  over the road to Antium. But we must go, for this is not merely an
  invitation, it is a command as well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if some one would not obey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He would be invited in another style to go on a journey notably
  longer,&mdash;one from which people do not return. What a pity that thou hast
  not obeyed my counsel and left Rome in season! Now thou must go to
  Antium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must go to Antium. See in what times we live and what vile slaves
  we are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou noticed that only to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But thou hast explained to me that Christian teaching is an
  enemy of life, since it shackles it. But can their shackles be stronger than
  those which we carry? Thou hast said, &rsquo;Greece created wisdom and
  beauty, and Rome power.&rsquo; Where is our power?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Call Chilo and talk with him. I have no desire to-day to
  philosophize. By Hercules! I did not create these times, and I do not answer
  for them. Let us speak of Antium. Know that great danger is awaiting thee,
  and it would be better, perhaps, to measure strength with that Ursus who
  choked Croton than to go there, but still thou canst not refuse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius waved his hand carelessly, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Danger! We are
  all wandering in the shadow of death, and every moment some head sinks in its
  darkness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I to enumerate all who had a little sense, and therefore, in
  spite of the times of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, lived eighty
  and ninety years? Let even such a man as Domitius Afer serve thee as an
  example. He has grown old quietly, though all his life he has been a criminal
  and a villain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps for that very reason!&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Then he began to glance over the list and read: &ldquo;Tigellinus,
  Vatinius, Sextus Africanus, Aquilinus Regulus, Suilius Nerulinus, Eprius
  Marcellus, and so on! What an assembly of ruffians and scoundrels! And to say
  that they govern the world! Would it not become them better to exhibit an
  Egyptian or Syrian divinity through villages, jingle sistra, and earn their
  bread by telling fortunes or dancing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or exhibiting learned monkeys, calculating dogs, or a flute-
  playing ass,&rdquo; added Petronius. &ldquo;That is true, but let us speak of
  something more important. Summon thy attention and listen. I have said on the
  Palatine that thou art ill, unable to leave the house; still thy name is on
  the list, which proves that some one does not credit my stories and has seen
  to this purposely. Nero cares nothing for the matter, since for him thou art
  a soldier, who has no conception of poetry or music, and with whom at the
  very highest he can talk only about races in the circus. So Poppæa must have
  seen to putting down thy name, which means that her desire for thee was not a
  passing whim, and that she wants to win thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is a daring Augusta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed she is daring, for she may ruin herself beyond redemption.
  May Venus inspire her, however, with another love as soon as possible; but
  since she desires thee thou must observe the very greatest caution. She has
  begun to weary Bronzebeard already; he prefers Rubria now, or Pythagoras,
  but, through consideration of self, he would wreak the most horrible
  vengeance on us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the grove I knew not that she was speaking to me; but thou wert
  listening. I said that I loved another, and did not wish her. Thou knowest
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I implore thee, by all the infernal gods, lose not the remnant of
  reason which the Christians have left in thee. How is it possible to
  hesitate, having a choice between probable and certain destruction? Have I
  not said already that if thou hadst wounded the Augusta&rsquo;s vanity, there
  would have been no rescue for thee? By Hades! if life has grown hateful to
  thee, better open thy veins at once, or cast thyself on a sword, for shouldst
  thou offend Poppæa, a less easy death may meet thee. It was easier once to
  converse with thee. What concerns thee specially? Would this affair cause
  thee loss, or hinder thee from loving thy Lygia? Remember, besides, that
  Poppæa saw her on the Palatine. It will not be difficult for her to guess why
  thou art rejecting such lofty favor, and she will get Lygia even from under
  the earth. Thou wilt ruin not only thyself, but Lygia too. Dost
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius listened as if thinking of something else, and at last he
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must see her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who? Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know where she is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then thou wilt begin anew to search for her in old cemeteries and
  beyond the Tiber?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not, but I must see her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, though she is a Christian, it may turn out that she has more
  judgment than thou; and it will certainly, unless she wishes thy
  ruin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;She saved me from the hands of
  Ursus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then hurry, for Bronzebeard will not postpone his departure.
  Sentences of death may be issued in Antium also.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius did not hear. One thought alone occupied him, an interview
  with Lygia; hence he began to think over methods.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile something intervened which might set aside every difficulty.
  Chilo came to his house unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>He entered wretched and worn, with signs of hunger on his face and in
  rags; but the servants, who had the former command to admit him at all hours
  of the day or night, did not dare to detain him, so he went straight to the
  atrium, and standing before Vinicius said,&mdash;&ldquo;May the gods give
  thee immortality, and share with thee dominion over the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius at the first moment wished to give the order to throw him out of
  doors; but the thought came to him that the Greek perhaps knew something of
  Lygia, and curiosity overcame his disgust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that thou?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;What has happened to
  thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evil, O son of Jove,&rdquo; answered Chilo. &ldquo;Real virtue is a
  ware for which no one inquires now, and a genuine sage must be glad of this
  even, that once in five days he has something with which to buy from the
  butcher a sheep&rsquo;s head, to gnaw in a garret, washing it down with his
  tears. Ah, lord! What thou didst give me I paid Atractus for books, and
  afterward I was robbed and ruined. The slave who was to write down my wisdom
  fled, taking the remnant of what thy generosity bestowed on me. I am in
  misery, but I thought to myself: To whom can I go, if not to thee, O Serapis,
  whom I love and deify, for whom I have exposed my life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why hast thou come, and what dost thou bring?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I come for aid, O Baal, and I bring my misery, my tears, my love,
  and finally the information which through love for thee I have collected.
  Thou rememberest, lord, I told thee once how I had given a slave of the
  divine Petronius one thread from the girdle of the Paphian Venus? I know now
  that it helped her, and thou, O descendant of the Sun, who knowest what is
  happening in that house, knowest also what Eunice is there. I have another
  such thread. I have preserved it for thee, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he stopped, on noticing the anger which was gathering on the brows of
  Vinicius, and said quickly, so as to anticipate the outburst,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know where the divine Lygia is living; I will show thee the
  street and the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius repressed the emotion with which that news filled him, and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With Linus, the elder priest of the Christians. She is there with
  Ursus, who goes as before to the miller, a namesake of thy dispensator Demas.
  Yes, Demas! Ursus works in the night; so if thou surround the house at night,
  thou wilt not find him. Linus is old, and besides him there are only two aged
  women in the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whence dost thou know all this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou rememberest, lord, that the Christians had me in their hands,
  and spared me. True, Glaucus was mistaken in thinking that I was the cause of
  his misfortunes; but he believed that I was, poor man, and he believes so
  yet. Still they spared me. Then be not astonished, lord, that gratitude
  filled my heart. I am a man of former, of better times. This was my thought:
  Am I to desert friends and benefactors? Would I not have been hard-hearted
  not to inquire about them, not to learn what was happening to them, how
  health was serving them, and where they were living? By the Pessinian Cybele!
  I am not capable of such conduct. At first I was restrained by fear that they
  might interpret my wishes incorrectly. But the love which I bore them proved
  greater than my fear, and the ease with which they forgive every injustice
  lent me special courage. But above all I was thinking of thee, lord. Our last
  attempt ended in defeat; but can such a son of Fortune be reconciled with
  defeat? So I prepared victory for thee. The house stands apart. Thou mayst
  give command to thy slaves to surround it so that not a mouse could escape.
  My lord, on thee alone it depends to have that magnanimous king&rsquo;s
  daughter in thy house this very night. But should that happen, remember that
  the cause of it is the very poor and hungry son of my father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The blood rushed to Vinicius&rsquo;s head. Temptation shook all his being
  again. Yes; that was the method, and this time a certain one. Once he has
  Lygia in his house, who can take her? Once he makes Lygia his mistress, what
  will be left to her, unless to remain so forever? And let all religions
  perish! What will the Christians mean to him then, with their mercy and
  forbidding faith? Is it not time to shake himself free of all that? Is it not
  time to live as all live? What will Lygia do later, save to reconcile her
  fate with the religion which she professes? That, too, is a question of
  inferior significance. Those are matters devoid of importance. First of all,
  she will be his,&mdash;and his this very day. And it is a question, too,
  whether that religion will hold out in her soul against the world which is
  new to her, against luxury, and excitements to which she must yield. All may
  happen to-day. He needs only to detain Chilo, and give an order at dark. And
  then delight without end! &ldquo;What has my life been?&rdquo; thought
  Vinicius; &ldquo;suffering, unsatisfied desire, and an endless propounding of
  problems without answer.&rdquo; In this way all will be cut short and ended.
  He recollected, it is true, that he had promised not to raise a hand against
  her. But by what had he sworn? Not by the gods, for he did not believe in
  them; not by Christ, for he did not believe in him yet. Finally, if she feels
  injured, he will marry her, and thus repair the wrong. Yes; to that he feels
  bound, for to her he is indebted for life. Here he recalled the day in which
  with Croton he had attacked her retreat; he remembered the Lygian&rsquo;s
  fist raised above him, and all that had happened later. He saw her again bent
  over his couch, dressed in the garb of a slave, beautiful as a divinity, a
  benefactress kind and glorified. His eyes passed to the lararium
  unconsciously, and to the little cross which she left him before going. Will
  he pay for all that by a new attack? Will he drag her by the hair as a slave
  to his cubiculum? And how will he be able to do so, since he not only desires
  but loves her, and he loves her specially because she is as she is? All at
  once he felt that it was not enough for him to have her in the house, it was
  not enough to seize her in his arms by superior force; he felt that his love
  needed something more,&mdash;her consent, her loves and her soul. Blessed
  that roof, if she come under it willingly; blessed the moment, blessed the
  day, blessed his life. Then the happiness of both will be as inexhaustible as
  the ocean, as the sun. But to seize her by violence would be to destroy that
  happiness forever, and at the same time to destroy, and defile that which is
  most precious and alone beloved in life. Terror seized him now at the very
  thought of this. He glanced at Chilo, who, while watching him, pushed his
  hands under his rags and scratched himself uneasily. That instant, disgust
  unspeakable took possession of Vinicius, and a wish to trample that former
  assistant of his, as he would a foul worm or venomous serpent. In an instant
  he knew what to do. But knowing no measure in anything, and following the
  impulse of his stern Roman nature, he turned toward Chilo and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not do what thou advisest, but, lest thou go without just
  reward, I will command to give thee three hundred stripes in the domestic
  prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo grew pale. There was so much cold resolution in the beautiful face
  of Vinicius that he could not deceive himself for a moment with the hope that
  the promised reward was no more than a cruel jest.</p>

  <p>Hence he threw himself on his knees in one instant, and bending double
  began to groan in a broken voice,&mdash;&ldquo;How, O king of Persia?
  Why?&mdash;O pyramid of kindness! Colossus of mercy! For what?&mdash;I am
  old, hungry, unfortunate&mdash;I have served thee&mdash;dost thou repay in
  this manner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As thou didst the Christians,&rdquo; said Vinicius. And he called
  the dispensator.</p>

  <p>But Chilo sprang toward his feet, and, embracing them convulsively,
  talked, while his face was covered with deathly pallor,&mdash;&ldquo;O lord,
  O lord! I am old! Fifty, not three hundred stripes. Fifty are enough! A
  hundred, not three hundred! Oh, mercy, mercy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius thrust him away with his foot, and gave the order. In the twinkle
  of an eye two powerful Quadi followed the dispensator, and, seizing Chilo by
  the remnant of his hair, tied his own rags around his neck and dragged him to
  the prison.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the name of Christ!&rdquo; called the Greek, at the exit of the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Vinicius was left alone. The order just issued roused and enlivened him.
  He endeavored to collect his scattered thoughts, and bring them to order. He
  felt great relief, and the victory which he had gained over himself filled
  him with comfort. He thought that he had made some great approach toward
  Lygia, and that some high reward should be given him. At the first moment it
  did not even occur to him that he had done a grievous wrong to Chilo, and had
  him flogged for the very acts for which he had rewarded him previously. He
  was too much of a Roman yet to be pained by another man&rsquo;s suffering,
  and to occupy his attention with one wretched Greek. Had he even thought of
  Chilo&rsquo;s suffering he would have considered that he had acted properly
  in giving command to punish such a villain. But he was thinking of Lygia, and
  said to her: I will not pay thee with evil for good; and when thou shalt
  learn how I acted with him who strove to persuade me to raise hands against
  thee, thou wilt be grateful. But here he stopped at this thought: Would Lygia
  praise his treatment of Chilo? The religion which she professes commands
  forgiveness; nay, the Christians forgave the villain, though they had greater
  reasons for revenge. Then for the first time was heard in his soul the cry:
  &ldquo;In the name of Christ!&rdquo; He remembered then that Chilo had
  ransomed himself from the hands of Ursus with such a cry, and he determined
  to remit the remainder of the punishment.</p>

  <p>With that object he was going to summon the dispensator, when that person
  stood before him, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, the old man has fainted, and
  perhaps he is dead. Am I to command further flogging?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Revive him and bring him before me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief of the atrium vanished behind the curtain, but the revival could
  not have been easy, for Vinicius waited a long time and was growing
  impatient, when the slaves brought in Chilo, and disappeared at a signal.</p>

  <p>Chilo was as pale as linen, and down his legs threads of blood were
  flowing to the mosaic pavement of the atrium. He was conscious, however, and,
  falling on his knees, began to speak, with extended
  hands,&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks to thee, lord. Thou art great and
  merciful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;know that I forgave thee because
  of that Christ to whom I owe my own life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O lord, I will serve Him and thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be silent and listen. Rise! Thou wilt go and show me the house in
  which Lygia dwells.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo sprang up; but he was barely on his feet when he grew more deathly
  pale yet, and said in a failing voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, I am really
  hungry&mdash;I will go, lord, I will go! but I have not the strength. Command
  to give me even remnants from the plate of thy dog, and I will go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius commanded to give him food, a piece of gold, and a mantle. But
  Chilo, weakened by stripes and hunger, could not go to take food, though
  terror raised the hair on his head, lest Vinicius might mistake his weakness
  for stubbornness and command to flog him anew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only let wine warm me,&rdquo; repeated he, with chattering teeth,
  &ldquo;I shall be able to go at once, even to Magna Græcia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He regained some strength after a time, and they went out.</p>

  <p>The way was long, for, like the majority of Christians, Linus dwelt in the
  Trans-Tiber, and not far from Miriam. At last Chilo showed Vinicius a small
  house, standing apart, surrounded by a wall covered entirely with ivy, and
  said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here it is, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;go thy way now, but listen first
  to what I tell thee. Forget that thou hast served me; forget where Miriam,
  Peter, and Glaucus dwell; forget also this house, and all Christians. Thou
  wilt come every month to my house, where Demas, my freedman, will pay thee
  two pieces of gold. But shouldst thou spy further after Christians, I will
  have thee flogged, or delivered into the hands of the prefect of the
  city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo bowed down, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I will forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But when Vinicius vanished beyond the corner of the street, he stretched
  his hands after him, and, threatening with his fists,
  exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;By Ate and the Furies! I will not forget!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he grew faint again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Vinicius went directly to the house in which Miriam lived.
  Before the gate he met Nazarius, who was confused at sight of him; but
  greeting the lad cordially, he asked to be conducted to his mother&rsquo;s
  lodgings.</p>

  <p>Besides Miriam, Vinicius found Peter, Glaucus, Crispus, and Paul of
  Tarsus, who had returned recently from Fregellæ. At sight of the young
  tribune, astonishment was reflected on all faces; but he said,&mdash;&ldquo;I
  greet you in the name of Christ, whom ye honor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May His name be glorified forever!&rdquo; answered they.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seen your virtue and experienced your kindness, hence I come
  as a friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And we greet thee as a friend,&rdquo; answered Peter. &ldquo;Sit
  down, lord, and partake of our refreshment, as a guest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will sit down and share your repast; but first listen to me, thou
  Peter, and thou Paul of Tarsus, so that ye may know my sincerity. I know
  where Lygia is. I have returned from before the house of Linus, which is near
  this dwelling. I have a right to her given me by Cæsar. I have at my houses
  in the city nearly five hundred slaves. I might surround her hiding- place
  and seize her; still I have not done so, and will not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For this reason the blessing of the Lord will be upon thee, and thy
  heart will be purified,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee. But listen to me further: I have not done so, though
  I am living in suffering and sadness. Before I knew you, I should have taken
  her undoubtedly, and held her by force; but your virtue and your religion,
  though I do not profess it, have changed something in my soul, so that I do
  not venture on violence. I know not myself why this is so, but it is so;
  hence I come to you, for ye take the place of Lygia&rsquo;s father and
  mother, and I say to you: Give her to me as wife, and I swear that not only
  will I not forbid her to confess Christ, but I will begin myself to learn His
  religion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He spoke with head erect and decisively; but still he was moved, and his
  legs trembled beneath his mantle. When silence followed his words, he
  continued, as if wishing to anticipate an unfavorable answer,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know what obstacles exist, but I love her as my own eyes; and
  though I am not a Christian yet, I am neither your enemy nor Christ&rsquo;s.
  I wish to be sincere, so that you may trust me. At this moment it is a
  question of life with me, still I tell you the truth. Another might say,
  Baptize me; I say, Enlighten me. I believe that Christ rose from the dead,
  for people say so who love the truth, and who saw Him after death. I believe,
  for I have seen myself, that your religion produces virtue, justice, and
  mercy,&mdash;not crime, which is laid to your charge. I have not known your
  religion much so far. A little from you, a little from your works, a little
  from Lygia, a little from conversations with you. Still I repeat that it has
  made some change in me. Formerly I held my servants with an iron hand; I
  cannot do so now. I knew no pity; I know it now. I was fond of pleasure; the
  other night I fled from the pond of Agrippa, for the breath was taken from me
  through disgust. Formerly I believed in superior force; now I have abandoned
  it. Know ye that I do not recognize myself. I am disgusted by feasts, wine,
  singing, citharæ, garlands, the court of Cæsar, naked bodies, and every
  crime. When I think that Lygia is like snow in the mountains, I love her the
  more; and when I think that she is what she is through your religion, I love
  and desire that religion. But since I understand it not, since I know not
  whether I shall be able to live according to it, nor whether my nature can
  endure it, I am in uncertainty and suffering, as if I were in
  prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here his brows met in wrinkle of pain, and a flush appeared on his cheeks;
  after that he spoke on with growing haste and greater emotion,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As ye see, I am tortured from love and uncertainty. Men tell me
  that in your religion there is no place for life, or human joy, or happiness,
  or law, or order, or authority, or Roman dominion. Is this true? Men tell me
  that ye are madmen; but tell me yourselves what ye bring. Is it a sin to
  love, a sin to feel joy, a sin to want happiness? Are ye enemies of life?
  Must a Christian be wretched? Must I renounce Lygia? What is truth in your
  view? Your deeds and words are like transparent water, but what is under that
  water? Ye see that I am sincere. Scatter the darkness. Men say this to me
  also: Greece created beauty and wisdom, Rome created power; but
  they&mdash;what do they bring? Tell, then, what ye bring. If there is
  brightness beyond your doors, open them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We bring love,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

  <p>And Paul of Tarsus added,&mdash;&ldquo;If I speak with the tongues of men
  and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the heart of the old Apostle was stirred by that soul in suffering,
  which, like a bird in a cage, was struggling toward air and the sun; hence,
  stretching his hand to Vinicius, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Whoso knocketh, to him
  will be opened. The favor and grace of God is upon thee; for this reason I
  bless thee, thy soul and thy love, in the name of the Redeemer of
  mankind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who had spoken with enthusiasm already, sprang toward Peter on
  hearing this blessing, and an uncommon thing happened. That descendant of
  Quirites, who till recently had not recognized humanity in a foreigner,
  seized the hand of the old Galilean, and pressed it in gratitude to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>Peter was pleased; for he understood that his sowing had fallen on an
  additional field, that his fishing-net had gathered in a new soul.</p>

  <p>Those present, not less pleased by that evident expression of honor for
  the Apostle of God, exclaimed in one voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Praise to the Lord
  in the highest!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius rose with a radiant face, and began,&mdash;&ldquo;I see that
  happiness may dwell among you, for I feel happy, and I think that ye can
  convince me of other things in the same way. But I will add that this cannot
  happen in Rome. Cæsar is going to Antium and I must go with him, for I have
  the order. Ye know that not to obey is death. But if I have found favor in
  your eyes, go with me to teach your truth. It will be safer for you than for
  me. Even in that great throng of people, ye can announce your truth in the
  very court of Cæsar. They say that Acte is a Christian; and there are
  Christians among pretorians even, for I myself have seen soldiers kneeling
  before thee, Peter, at the Nomentan gate. In Antium I have a villa where we
  shall assemble to hear your teaching, at the side of Nero. Glaucus told me
  that ye are ready to go to the end of the earth for one soul; so do for me
  what ye have done for those for whose sake ye have come from Judea,&mdash;do
  it, and desert not my soul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hearing this, they began to take counsel, thinking with delight of the
  victory of their religion, and of the significance for the pagan world which
  the conversion of an Augustian, and a descendant of one of the oldest Roman
  families, would have. They were ready, indeed, to wander to the end of the
  earth for one human soul, and since the death of the Master they had, in
  fact, done nothing else; hence a negative answer did not even come to their
  minds. Peter was at that moment the pastor of a whole multitude, hence he
  could not go; but Paul of Tarsus, who had been in Aricium and Fregellæ not
  long before, and who was preparing for a long journey to the East to visit
  churches there and freshen them with a new spirit of zeal, consented to
  accompany the young tribune to Antium. It was easy to find a ship there going
  to Grecian waters.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, though sad because Peter, to whom he owed so much, could not
  visit Antium, thanked him with gratitude, and then turned to the old Apostle
  with his last request,&mdash;&ldquo;Knowing Lygia&rsquo;s dwelling,&rdquo;
  said he, &ldquo;I might have gone to her and asked, as is proper, whether she
  would take me as husband should my soul become Christian, but I prefer to ask
  thee, O Apostle! Permit me to see her, or take me thyself to her. I know not
  how long I shall be in Antium; and remember that near Cæsar no one is sure of
  to-morrow. Petronius himself told me that I should not be altogether safe
  there. Let me see her before I go; let me delight my eyes with her; and let
  me ask her if she will forget my evil and return good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Peter smiled kindly and said,&mdash;&ldquo;But who could refuse thee a
  proper joy, my son?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius stooped again to Peter&rsquo;s hands, for he could not in any way
  restrain his overflowing heart. The Apostle took him by the temples and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Have no fear of Cæsar, for I tell thee that a hair will
  not fall from thy head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sent Miriam for Lygia, telling her not to say who was with them, so as
  to give the maiden more delight.</p>

  <p>It was not far; so after a short time those in the chamber saw among the
  myrtles of the garden Miriam leading Lygia by the hand.</p>

  <p>Vinicius wished to run forth to meet her; but at sight of that beloved
  form happiness took his strength, and he stood with beating heart,
  breathless, barely able to keep his feet, a hundred times more excited than
  when for the first time in life he heard the Parthian arrows whizzing round
  his head.</p>

  <p>She ran in, unsuspecting; but at sight of him she halted as if fixed to
  the earth. Her face flushed, and then became very pale; she looked with
  astonished and frightened eyes on those present.</p>

  <p>But round about she saw clear glances, full of kindness. The Apostle Peter
  approached her and asked,&mdash;&ldquo;Lygia, dost thou love him as
  ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed. Her lips began to quiver like those of a
  child who is preparing to cry, who feels that it is guilty, but sees that it
  must confess the guilt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Answer,&rdquo; said the Apostle.</p>

  <p>Then, with humility, obedience, and fear in her voice, she whispered,
  kneeling at the knees of Peter,&mdash;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In one moment Vinicius knelt at her side. Peter placed his hands on their
  heads, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Love each other in the Lord and to His glory,
  for there is no sin in your love.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While walking with Lygia through the garden, Vinicius
  described briefly, in words from the depth of his heart, that which a short
  time before he had confessed to the Apostles,&mdash;that is, the alarm of his
  soul, the changes which had taken place in him, and, finally, that immense
  yearning which had veiled life from him, beginning with the hour when he left
  Miriam&rsquo;s dwelling. He confessed to Lygia that he had tried to forget
  her, but was not able. He thought whole days and nights of her. That little
  cross of boxwood twigs which she had left reminded him of her,&mdash;that
  cross, which he had placed in the lararium and revered involuntarily as
  something divine. And he yearned more and more every moment, for love was
  stronger than he, and had seized his soul altogether, even when he was at the
  house of Aulus. The Parcæ weave the thread of life for others; but love,
  yearning, and melancholy had woven it for him. His acts had been evil, but
  they had their origin in love. He had loved her when she was in the house of
  Aulus, when she was on the Palatine, when he saw her in Ostrianum listening
  to Peter&rsquo;s words, when he went with Croton to carry her away, when she
  watched at his bedside, and when she deserted him. Then came Chilo, who
  discovered her dwelling, and advised him to seize her a second time; but he
  chose to punish Chilo, and go to the Apostles to ask for truth and for her.
  And blessed be that moment in which such a thought came to his head, for now
  he is at her side, and she will not flee from him, as the last time she fled
  from the house of Miriam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not flee from thee,&rdquo; said Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why didst thou go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her iris-colored eyes to him, and, bending her blushing face,
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou knowest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was silent for a moment from excess of happiness, and began again
  to speak, as his eyes were opened gradually to this,&mdash;that she was
  different utterly from Roman women, and resembled Pomponia alone. Besides, he
  could not explain this to her clearly, for he could not define his
  feeling,&mdash;that beauty of a new kind altogether was coming to the world
  in her, such beauty as had not been in it thus far; beauty which is not
  merely a statue, but a spirit. He told her something, however, which filled
  her with delight,&mdash;that he loved her just because she had fled from him,
  and that she would be sacred to him at his hearth. Then, seizing her hand, he
  could not continue; he merely gazed on her with rapture as on his
  life&rsquo;s happiness which he had won, and repeated her name, as if to
  assure himself that he had found her and was near her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lygia, Lygia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At last he inquired what had taken place in her mind, and she confessed
  that she had loved him while in the house of Aulus, and that if he had taken
  her back to them from the Palatine she would have told them of her love and
  tried to soften their anger against him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I swear to thee,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;that it had not even
  risen in my mind to take thee from Aulus. Petronius will tell thee sometime
  that I told him then how I loved and wished to marry thee. &rsquo;Let her
  anoint my door with wolf fat, and let her sit at my hearth,&rsquo; said I to
  him. But he ridiculed me, and gave Cæsar the idea of demanding thee as a
  hostage and giving thee to me. How often in my sorrow have I cursed him; but
  perhaps fate ordained thus, for otherwise I should not have known the
  Christians, and should not have understood thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Believe me, Marcus,&rdquo; replied Lygia, &ldquo;it was Christ who
  led thee to Himself by design.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius raised his head with a certain astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered he, with animation. &ldquo;Everything fixed
  itself so marvellously that in seeking thee I met the Christians. In
  Ostrianum I listened to the Apostle with wonder, for I had never heard such
  words. And there thou didst pray for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered Lygia.</p>

  <p>They passed near the summer-house covered with thick ivy, and approached
  the place where Ursus, after stifling Croton, threw himself upon
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I should have perished but
  for thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not mention that,&rdquo; answered Lygia, &ldquo;and do not speak
  of it to Ursus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could I be revenged on him for defending thee? Had he been a slave,
  I should have given him freedom straightway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had he been a slave, Aulus would have freed him long
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember,&rdquo; asked Vinicius, &ldquo;that I wished to
  take thee back to Aulus, but the answer was, that Cæsar might hear of it and
  take revenge on Aulus and Pomponia? Think of this: thou mayst see them now as
  often as thou wishest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How, Marcus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say &lsquo;now,&rsquo; and I think that thou wilt be able to see
  them without danger, when thou art mine. For should Cæsar hear of this, and
  ask what I did with the hostage whom he gave me, I should say &rsquo;I
  married her, and she visits the house of Aulus with my consent.&rsquo; He
  will not remain long in Antium, for he wishes to go to Achæa; and even should
  he remain, I shall not need to see him daily. When Paul of Tarsus teaches me
  your faith, I will receive baptism at once, I will come here, gain the
  friendship of Aulus and Pomponia, who will return to the city by that time,
  and there will be no further hindrance, I will seat thee at my hearth. Oh,
  carissima! carissima!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he stretched forth his hand, as if taking Heaven as witness of his
  love; and Lygia, raising her clear eyes to him, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then I shall say, &lsquo;Wherever thou art, Caius, there am I,
  Caia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Lygia,&rdquo; cried Vinicius, &ldquo;I swear to thee that never
  has woman been so honored in the house of her husband as thou shalt be in
  mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a time they walked on in silence, without being able to take in with
  their breasts their happiness, in love with each other, like two deities, and
  as beautiful as if spring had given them to the world with the flowers.</p>

  <p>They halted at last under the cypress growing near the entrance of the
  house. Lygia leaned against his breast, and Vinicius began to entreat again
  with a trembling voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell Ursus to go to the house of Aulus
  for thy furniture and playthings of childhood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But she, blushing like a rose or like the dawn,
  answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Custom commands otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that. The pronuba [The matron who accompanies the bride and
  explains to her the duties of a wife] usually brings them behind the bride,
  but do this for me. I will take them to my villa in Antium, and they will
  remind me of thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he placed his hands together and repeated, like a child who is
  begging for something,&mdash;&ldquo;It will be some days before Pomponia
  returns; so do this, diva, do this, carissima.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Pomponia will do as she likes,&rdquo; answered Lygia, blushing
  still more deeply at mention of the pronuba.</p>

  <p>And again they were silent, for love had begun to stop the breath in their
  breasts. Lygia stood with shoulders leaning against the cypress, her face
  whitening in the shadow, like a flower, her eyes drooping, her bosom heaving
  with more and more life. Vinicius changed in the face, and grew pale. In the
  silence of the afternoon they only heard the beating of their hearts, and in
  their mutual ecstasy that cypress, the myrtle bushes, and the ivy of the
  summer-house became for them a paradise of love. But Miriam appeared in the
  door, and invited them to the afternoon meal. They sat down then with the
  Apostles, who gazed at them with pleasure, as on the young generation which
  after their death would preserve and sow still further the seed of the new
  faith. Peter broke and blessed bread. There was calm on all faces, and a
  certain immense happiness seemed to overflow the whole house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Paul at last, turning to Vinicius, &ldquo;are we
  enemies of life and happiness?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know how that is,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, &ldquo;for never have
  I been so happy as among you.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the evening of that day Vinicius, while returning home
  through the Forum, saw at the entrance to the Vicus Tuscus the gilded litter
  of Petronius, carried by eight stalwart Bithynians, and, stopping it with a
  sign of his hand, he approached the curtains.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast had a pleasant dream, I trust, and a happy one!&rdquo;
  cried he, laughing at sight of the slumbering Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, is it thou?&rdquo; said Petronius, waking up. &ldquo;Yes; I
  dropped asleep for a moment, as I passed the night at the Palatine. I have
  come out to buy something to read on the road to Antium. What is the
  news?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou visiting the book-shops?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do not like to bring disorder into my library, so I am
  collecting a special supply for the journey. It is likely that some new
  things of Musonius and Seneca have come out. I am looking also for Persius,
  and a certain edition of the Eclogues of Vergilius, which I do not possess.
  Oh, how tired I am; and how my hands ache from covers and rings! For when a
  man is once in a book-shop curiosity seizes him to look here and there. I was
  at the shop of Avirnus, and at that of Atractus on the Argiletum, and with
  the Sozii on Vicus Sandalarius. By Castor! how I want to sleep!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert on the Palatine? Then I would ask thee what is it to be
  heard there? Or, knowest what?&mdash;send home the litter and the tubes with
  books, and come to my house. We will talk of Antium, and of something
  else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; answered Petronius, coming out of the litter.
  &ldquo;Thou must know, besides, that we start for Antium the day after to-
  morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whence should I know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In what world art thou living? Well, I shall be the first to
  announce the news to thee. Yes; be ready for the day after to-morrow in the
  morning. Peas in olive oil have not helped, a cloth around his thick neck has
  not helped, and Bronzebeard is hoarse. In view of this, delay is not to be
  mentioned. He curses Rome and its atmosphere, with what the world stands on;
  he would be glad to level it to the earth or to destroy it with fire, and he
  longs for the sea at the earliest. He says that the smells which the wind
  brings from the narrow streets are driving him into the grave. To-day great
  sacrifices were offered in all the temples to restore his voice; and woe to
  Rome, but especially to the Senate, should it not return quickly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there would be no reason for his visit to Achæa?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But is that the only talent possessed by our divine Cæsar?&rdquo;
  asked Petronius, smiling. &ldquo;He would appear in the Olympic games, as a
  poet, with his &lsquo;Burning of Troy&rsquo;; as a charioteer, as a musician,
  as an athlete,&mdash;nay, even as a dancer, and would receive in every case
  all the crowns intended for victors. Dost know why that monkey grew hoarse?
  Yesterday he wanted to equal our Paris in dancing, and danced for us the
  adventures of Leda, during which he sweated and caught cold. He was as wet
  and slippery as an eel freshly taken from water. He changed masks one after
  another, whirled like a spindle, waved his hands like a drunken sailor, till
  disgust seized me while looking at that great stomach and those slim legs.
  Paris taught him during two weeks; but imagine to thyself Ahenobarbus as Leda
  or as the divine swan. That was a swan!&mdash;there is no use in denying it.
  But he wants to appear before the public in that pantomime,&mdash;first in
  Antium, and then in Rome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People are offended already because he sang in public; but to think
  that a Roman Cæsar will appear as a mime! No; even Rome will not endure
  that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear friend, Rome will endure anything; the Senate will pass a
  vote of thanks to the &lsquo;Father of his country.&rsquo; And the rabble
  will be elated because Cæsar is its buffoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say thyself, is it possible to be more debased?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Thou art living by thyself at
  home, and meditating, now about Lygia, now about Christians, so thou knowest
  not, perhaps, what happened two days since. Nero married, in public,
  Pythagoras, who appeared as a bride. That passed the measure of madness, it
  would seem, would it not? And what wilt thou say? the flamens, who were
  summoned, came and performed the ceremony with solemnity. I was present. I
  can endure much; still I thought, I confess, that the gods, if there be any,
  should give a sign. But Cæsar does not believe in the gods, and he is
  right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So he is in one person chief priest, a god, and an atheist,&rdquo;
  said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Petronius, beginning to laugh. &ldquo;That had
  not entered my head; but the combination is such as the world has not
  seen.&rdquo; Then, stopping a moment, he said: &ldquo;One should add that
  this chief priest who does not believe in the gods, and this god who reviles
  the gods, fears them in his character of atheist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The proof of this is what happened in the temple of Vesta.&rdquo;
  &ldquo;What a society!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As the society is, so is Cæsar. But this will not last
  long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus conversing, they entered the house of Vinicius, who called for supper
  joyously; then, turning to Petronius he said,&mdash;&ldquo;No, my dear,
  society must be renewed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall not renew it,&rdquo; answered Petronius, &ldquo;even for
  the reason that in Nero&rsquo;s time man is like a butterfly,&mdash;he lives
  in the sunshine of favor, and at the first cold wind he perishes, even
  against his will. By the son of Maia! more than once have I given myself this
  question: By what miracle has such a man as Lucius Saturninus been able to
  reach the age of ninety-three, to survive Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius? But
  never mind. Wilt thou permit me to send thy litter for Eunice? My wish to
  sleep has gone, somehow, and I should like to be joyous. Give command to
  cithara players to come to the supper, and afterward we will talk of Antium.
  It is needful to think of it, especially for thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius gave the order to send for Eunice, but declared that he had no
  thought of breaking his head over the stay in Antium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let those break their heads who cannot live otherwise than in the
  rays of Cæsar&rsquo;s favor. The world does not end on the Palatine,
  especially for those who have something else in their hearts and
  souls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said this so carelessly and with such animation and gladness that his
  whole manner struck Petronius; hence, looking for a time at him, he
  asked,&mdash;&ldquo;What is taking place in thee? Thou art to-day as thou
  wert when wearing the golden bulla on thy neck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; answered Vinicius. &ldquo;I have invited thee
  purposely to tell thee so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something which I would not give for the Roman Empire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he sat down, and, leaning on the arm of the chair, rested his head on
  his hand, and asked,&mdash;&ldquo;Dost remember how we were at the house of
  Aulus Plautius, and there thou didst see for the first time the godlike
  maiden called by thee &lsquo;the dawn and the spring&rsquo;? Dost remember
  that Psyche, that incomparable, that one more beautiful than our maidens and
  our goddesses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at him with astonishment, as if he wished to make sure
  that his head was right.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of whom art thou speaking?&rdquo; asked he at last.
  &ldquo;Evidently I remember Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am her betrothed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius sprang up and called his dispensator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let the slaves stand before me to the last soul,
  quickly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou her betrothed?&rdquo; repeated Petronius.</p>

  <p>But before he recovered from his astonishment the immense atrium was
  swarming with people. Panting old men ran in, men in the vigor of life,
  women, boys, and girls. With each moment the atrium was filled more and more;
  in corridors, called &ldquo;fauces,&rdquo; voices were heard calling in
  various languages. Finally, all took their places in rows at the walls and
  among the columns. Vinicius, standing near the impluvium, turned to Demas,
  the freedman, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those who have served twenty years in my house are to appear
  tomorrow before the pretor, where they will receive freedom; those who have
  not served out the time will receive three pieces of gold and double rations
  for a week. Send an order to the village prisons to remit punishment, strike
  the fetters from people&rsquo;s feet, and feed them sufficiently. Know that a
  happy day has come to me, and I wish rejoicing in the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment they stood in silence, as if not believing their ears; then
  all hands were raised at once, and all mouths cried,&mdash;&ldquo;A-a! lord!
  a-a-a!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius dismissed them with a wave of his hand. Though they desired to
  thank him and to fall at his feet, they went away hurriedly, filling the
  house with happiness from cellar to roof.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;I will command them to meet
  again in the garden, and to make such signs on the ground as they choose.
  Lygia will free those who draw a fish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius, who never wondered long at anything, had grown indifferent, and
  asked,&mdash;&ldquo;A fish, is it? Ah, ha! According to Chilo, that is the
  sign of a Christian, I remember.&rdquo; Then he extended his hand to
  Vinicius, and said: &ldquo;Happiness is always where a man sees it. May Flora
  strew flowers under thy feet for long years. I wish thee everything which
  thou wishest thyself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee, for I thought that thou wouldst dissuade me, and
  that, as thou seest, would be time lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I? Dissuade? By no means. On the contrary, I tell thee that thou
  art doing well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha, traitor!&rdquo; answered Vinicius, joyfully; &ldquo;hast
  forgotten what thou didst tell me once when we were leaving the house of
  Pomponia Græcina?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Petronius, with cool blood; &ldquo;but I have
  changed my opinion. My dear,&rdquo; added he after a while, &ldquo;in Rome
  everything changes. Husbands change wives, wives change husbands; why should
  not I change opinions? It lacked little of Nero&rsquo;s marrying Acte, whom
  for his sake they represented as the descendant of a kingly line. Well, he
  would have had an honest wife, and we an honest Augusta. By Proteus and his
  barren spaces in the sea! I shall change my opinion as often as I find it
  appropriate or profitable. As to Lygia, her royal descent is more certain
  than Acte&rsquo;s. But in Antium be on thy guard against Poppæa, who is
  revengeful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think of doing so. A hair will not fall from my head in
  Antium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thou think to astonish me a second time, thou art mistaken; but
  whence hast thou that certainty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Apostle Peter told me so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, the Apostle Peter told thee! Against that there is no argument;
  permit me, however, to take certain measures of precaution even to this end,
  that the Apostle Peter may not turn out a false prophet; for, should the
  Apostle be mistaken, perchance he might lose thy confidence, which certainly
  will be of use to him in the future.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do what may please thee, but I believe him. And if thou think to
  turn me against him by repeating his name with irony, thou art
  mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But one question more. Hast thou become a Christian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet; but Paul of Tarsus will travel with me to explain the
  teachings of Christ, and afterward I will receive baptism; for thy statement
  that they are enemies of life and pleasantness is not true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the better for thee and Lygia,&rdquo; answered Petronius; then,
  shrugging his shoulders, he said, as if to himself, &ldquo;But it is
  astonishing how skilled those people are in gaining adherents, and how that
  sect is extending.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, with as much warmth as if he had
  been baptized already; &ldquo;there are thousands and tens of thousands of
  them in Rome, in the cities of Italy, in Greece and Asia. There are
  Christians among the legions and among the pretorians; they are in the palace
  of Cæsar itself. Slaves and citizens, poor and rich, plebeian and patrician,
  confess that faith. Dost thou know that the Cornelii are Christians, that
  Pomponia Græcina is a Christian, that likely Octavia was, and Acte is? Yes,
  that teaching will embrace the world, and it alone is able to renew it. Do
  not shrug thy shoulders, for who knows whether in a month or a year thou wilt
  not receive it thyself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;No, by the son of Leto! I will not
  receive it; even if the truth and wisdom of gods and men were contained in
  it. That would require labor, and I have no fondness for labor. Labor demands
  self-denial, and I will not deny myself anything. With thy nature, which is
  like fire and boiling water, something like this may happen any time. But I?
  I have my gems, my cameos, my vases, my Eunice. I do not believe in Olympus,
  but I arrange it on earth for myself; and I shall flourish till the arrows of
  the divine archer pierce me, or till Cæsar commands me to open my veins. I
  love the odor of violets too much, and a comfortable triclinium. I love even
  our gods, as rhetorical figures, and Achæa, to which I am preparing to go
  with our fat, thin-legged, incomparable, godlike Cæsar, the august
  period-compelling Hercules, Nero.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he was joyous at the very supposition that he could accept the
  teaching of Galilean fishermen, and began to sing in an undertone,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will entwine my bright sword in myrtle, After the example of
  Harmodius and Aristogiton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he stopped, for the arrival of Eunice was announced. Immediately after
  her coming supper was served, during which songs were sung by the cithara
  players; Vinicius told of Chilo&rsquo;s visit, and also how that visit had
  given the idea of going to the Apostles directly,&mdash;an idea which came to
  him while they were flogging Chilo.</p>

  <p>At mention of this, Petronius, who began to be drowsy, placed his hand on
  his forehead, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;The thought was good, since the object
  was good. But as to Chilo, I should have given him five pieces of gold; but
  as it was thy will to flog him, it was better to flog him, for who knows but
  in time senators will bow to him, as to-day they are bowing to our
  cobbler-knight, Vatinius. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And, removing his wreath, he, with Eunice, prepared for home. When they
  had gone, Vinicius went to his library and wrote to Lygia as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When thou openest thy beautiful eyes, I wish this letter to say
  Good-day! to thee. Hence I write now, though I shall see thee tomorrow. Cæsar
  will go to Antium after to-morrow,&mdash;and I, eheu! must go with him. I
  have told thee already that not to obey would be to risk life&mdash;and at
  present I could not find courage to die. But if thou wish me not to go, write
  one word, and I will stay. Petronius will turn away danger from me with a
  speech. To-day, in the hour of my delight, I gave rewards to all my slaves;
  those who have served in the house twenty years I shall take to the pretor
  to-morrow and free. Thou, my dear, shouldst praise me, since this act as I
  think will be in accord with that mild religion of thine; secondly, I do this
  for thy sake. They are to thank thee for their freedom. I shall tell them so
  to-morrow, so that they may be grateful to thee and praise thy name. I give
  myself in bondage to happiness and thee. God grant that I never see
  liberation. May Antium be cursed, and the journey of Ahenobarbus! Thrice and
  four times happy am I in not being so wise as Petronius; if I were, I should
  be forced to go to Greece perhaps. Meanwhile the moment of separation will
  sweeten my memory of thee. Whenever I can tear myself away, I shall sit on a
  horse, and rush back to Rome, to gladden my eyes with sight of thee, and my
  ears with thy voice. When I cannot come I shall send a slave with a letter,
  and an inquiry about thee. I salute thee, divine one, and embrace thy feet.
  Be not angry that I call thee divine. If thou forbid, I shall obey, but
  to-day I cannot call thee otherwise. I congratulate thee on thy future house
  with my whole soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was known in Rome that Cæsar wished to see Ostia on the
  journey, or rather the largest ship in the world, which had brought wheat
  recently from Alexandria, and from Ostia to go by the Via Littoralis to
  Antium. Orders had been given a number of days earlier; hence at the Porta
  Ostiensis, from early morning, crowds made up of the local rabble and of all
  nations of the earth had collected to feast their eyes with the sight of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s retinue, on which the Roman population could never gaze
  sufficiently. The road to Antium was neither difficult nor long. In the place
  itself, which was composed of palaces and villas built and furnished in a
  lordly manner, it was possible to find everything demanded by comfort, and
  even the most exquisite luxury of the period. Cæsar had the habit, however,
  of taking with him on a journey every object in which he found delight,
  beginning with musical instruments and domestic furniture, and ending with
  statues and mosaics, which were taken even when he wished to remain on the
  road merely a short time for rest or recreation. He was accompanied,
  therefore, on every expedition by whole legions of servants, without
  reckoning divisions of pretorian guards, and Augustians; of the latter each
  had a personal retinue of slaves.</p>

  <p>Early on the morning of that day herdsmen from the Campania, with sunburnt
  faces, wearing goat-skins on their legs, drove forth five hundred she-asses
  through the gates, so that Poppæa on the morrow of her arrival at Antium
  might have her bath in their milk. The rabble gazed with delight and ridicule
  at the long ears swaying amid clouds of dust, and listened with pleasure to
  the whistling of whips and the wild shouts of the herdsmen. After the asses
  had gone by, crowds of youth rushed forth, swept the road carefully, and
  covered it with flowers and needles from pine-trees. In the crowds people
  whispered to each other, with a certain feeling of pride, that the whole road
  to Antium would be strewn in that way with flowers taken from private gardens
  round about, or bought at high prices from dealers at the Porta Mugionis. As
  the morning hours passed, the throng increased every moment. Some had brought
  their whole families, and, lest the time might seem tedious, they spread
  provisions on stones intended for the new temple of Ceres, and ate their
  prandium beneath the open sky. Here and there were groups, in which the lead
  was taken by persons who had travelled; they talked of Cæsar&rsquo;s present
  trip, of his future journeys, and journeys in general. Sailors and old
  soldiers narrated wonders which during distant campaigns they had heard about
  countries which a Roman foot had never touched. Home-stayers, who had never
  gone beyond the Appian Way, listened with amazement to marvellous tales of
  India, of Arabia, of archipelagos surrounding Britain in which, on a small
  island inhabited by spirits, Briareus had imprisoned the sleeping Saturn.
  They heard of hyperborean regions of stiffened seas, of the hisses and roars
  which the ocean gives forth when the sun plunges into his bath. Stories of
  this kind found ready credence among the rabble, stories believed by such men
  even as Tacitus and Pliny. They spoke also of that ship which Cæsar was to
  look at,&mdash;a ship which had brought wheat to last for two years, without
  reckoning four hundred passengers, an equal number of soldiers, and a
  multitude of wild beasts to be used during the summer games. This produced
  general good feeling toward Cæsar, who not only nourished the populace, but
  amused it. Hence a greeting full of enthusiasm was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile came a detachment of Numidian horse, who belonged to the
  pretorian guard. They wore yellow uniforms, red girdles, and great earrings,
  which cast a golden gleam on their black faces. The points of their bamboo
  spears glittered like flames, in the sun. After they had passed, a
  procession-like movement began. The throng crowded forward to look at it more
  nearly; but divisions of pretorian foot were there, and, forming in line on
  both sides of the gate, prevented approach to the road. In advance moved
  wagons carrying tents, purple, red, and violet, and tents of byssus woven
  from threads as white as snow; and oriental carpets, and tables of citrus,
  and pieces of mosaic, and kitchen utensils, and cages with birds from the
  East, North, and West, birds whose tongues or brains were to go to
  Cæsar&rsquo;s table, and vessels with wine and baskets with fruit. But
  objects not to be exposed to bruising or breaking in vehicles were borne by
  slaves. Hence hundreds of people were seen on foot, carrying vessels, and
  statues of Corinthian bronze. There were companies appointed specially to
  Etruscan vases; others to Grecian; others to golden or silver vessels, or
  vessels of Alexandrian glass. These were guarded by small detachments of
  pretorian infantry and cavalry; over each division of slaves were
  taskmasters, holding whips armed at the end with lumps of lead or iron,
  instead of snappers. The procession, formed of men bearing with importance
  and attention various objects, seemed like some solemn religious procession;
  and the resemblance grew still more striking when the musical instruments of
  Cæsar and the court were borne past. There were seen harps, Grecian lutes,
  lutes of the Hebrews and Egyptians, lyres, formingas, citharas, flutes, long,
  winding buffalo horns and cymbals. While looking at that sea of instruments,
  gleaming beneath the sun in gold, bronze, precious stones, and pearls, it
  might be imagined that Apollo and Bacchus had set out on a journey through
  the world. After the instruments came rich chariots filled with acrobats,
  dancers male and female, grouped artistically, with wands in their hands.
  After them followed slaves intended, not for service, but excess; so there
  were boys and little girls, selected from all Greece and Asia Minor, with
  long hair, or with winding curls arranged in golden nets, children resembling
  Cupids, with wonderful faces, but faces covered completely with a thick
  coating of cosmetics, lest the wind of the Campania might tan their delicate
  complexions.</p>

  <p>And again appeared a pretorian cohort of gigantic Sicambrians, blue-eyed,
  bearded, blond and red haired. In front of them Roman eagles were carried by
  banner-bearers called &ldquo;imaginarii,&rdquo; tablets with inscriptions,
  statues of German and Roman gods, and finally statues and busts of Cæsar.
  From under the skins and armor of the soldier appeared limbs sunburnt and
  mighty, looking like military engines capable of wielding the heavy weapons
  with which guards of that kind were furnished. The earth seemed to bend
  beneath their measured and weighty tread. As if conscious of strength which
  they could use against Cæsar himself, they looked with contempt on the rabble
  of the street, forgetting, it was evident, that many of themselves had come
  to that city in manacles. But they were insignificant in numbers, for the
  pretorian force had remained in camp specially to guard the city and hold it
  within bounds. When they had marched past, Nero&rsquo;s chained lions and
  tigers were led by, so that, should the wish come to him of imitating
  Dionysus, he would have them to attach to his chariots. They were led in
  chains of steel by Arabs and Hindoos, but the chains were so entwined with
  garlands that the beasts seemed led with flowers. The lions and tigers, tamed
  by skilled trainers, looked at the crowds with green and seemingly sleepy
  eyes; but at moments they raised their giant heads, and breathed through
  wheezing nostrils the exhalations of the multitude, licking their jaws the
  while with spiny tongues.</p>

  <p>Now came Cæsar&rsquo;s vehicles and litters, great and small, gold or
  purple, inlaid with ivory or pearls, or glittering with diamonds; after them
  came another small cohort of pretorians in Roman armor, pretorians composed
  of Italian volunteers only;* then crowds of select slave servants, and boys;
  and at last came Cæsar himself, whose approach was heralded from afar by the
  shouts of thousands.</p>

  <p>[* The inhabitants of Italy were freed from military service by Augustus,
  in consequence of which the so-called cohors Italica, stationed generally in
  Asia, was composed of volunteers. The pretorian guards, in so far as they
  were not composed of foreigners, were made up of volunteers.]</p>

  <p>In the crowd was the Apostle Peter, who wished to see Cæsar once in life.
  He was accompanied by Lygia, whose face was hidden by a thick veil, and
  Ursus, whose strength formed the surest defence of the young girl in the wild
  and boisterous crowd. The Lygian seized a stone to be used in building the
  temple, and brought it to the Apostle, so that by standing on it he might see
  better than others.</p>

  <p>The crowd muttered when Ursus pushed it apart, as a ship pushes waves; but
  when he carried the stone, which four of the strongest men could not raise,
  the muttering was turned into wonderment, and cries of &ldquo;Macte!&rdquo;
  were heard round about.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cæsar appeared. He was sitting in a chariot drawn by six white
  Idumean stallions shod with gold. The chariot had the form of a tent with
  sides open, purposely, so that the crowds could see Cæsar. A number of
  persons might have found place in the chariot; but Nero, desiring that
  attention should be fixed on him exclusively, passed through the city alone,
  having at his feet merely two deformed dwarfs. He wore a white tunic, and a
  toga of amethyst color, which cast a bluish tinge on his face. On his head
  was a laurel wreath. Since his departure from Naples he had increased notably
  in body. His face had grown wide; under his lower jaw hung a double chin, by
  which his mouth, always too near his nose, seemed to touch his nostrils. His
  bulky neck was protected, as usual, by a silk kerchief, which he arranged
  from moment to moment with a white and fat hand grown over with red hair,
  forming as it were bloody stains; he would not permit epilatores to pluck out
  this hair, since he had been told that to do so would bring trembling of the
  fingers and injure his lute-playing. Measureless vanity was depicted then, as
  at all times, on his face, together with tedium and suffering. On the whole,
  it was a face both terrible and trivial. While advancing he turned his head
  from side to side, blinking at times, and listening carefully to the manner
  in which the multitude greeted him. He was met by a storm of shouts and
  applause: &ldquo;Hail, divine Cæsar! Imperator, hail, conqueror! hail,
  incomparable!&mdash;Son of Apollo, Apollo himself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he heard these words, he smiled; but at moments a cloud, as it were,
  passed over his face, for the Roman rabble was satirical and keen in
  reckoning, and let itself criticise even great triumphators, even men whom it
  loved and respected. It was known that on a time they shouted during the
  entrance to Rome of Julius Cæsar: &ldquo;Citizens, hide your wives; the old
  libertine is coming!&rdquo; But Nero&rsquo;s monstrous vanity could not
  endure the least blame or criticism; meanwhile in the throng, amid shouts of
  applause were heard cries of &ldquo;Ahenobarbus, Ahenobarbus! Where hast thou
  put thy flaming beard? Dost thou fear that Rome might catch fire from
  it?&rdquo; And those who cried out in that fashion knew not that their jest
  concealed a dreadful prophecy.</p>

  <p>These voices did not anger Cæsar overmuch, since he did not wear a beard,
  for long before he had devoted it in a golden cylinder to Jupiter
  Capitolinus. But other persons, hidden behind piles of stones and the corners
  of temples, shouted: &ldquo;Matricide! Nero! Orestes! Alcmæon!&rdquo; and
  still others: &ldquo;Where is Octavia?&rdquo; &ldquo;Surrender the
  purple!&rdquo; At Poppæa, who came directly after him, they shouted,
  &ldquo;Flava coma (yellow hair)!!&rdquo; with which name they indicated a
  street-walker. Cæsar&rsquo;s musical ear caught these exclamations also, and
  he raised the polished emerald to his eyes as if to see and remember those
  who uttered them. While looking thus, his glance rested on the Apostle
  standing on the stone.</p>

  <p>For a while those two men looked at each other. It occurred to no one in
  that brilliant retinue, and to no one in that immense throng, that at that
  moment two powers of the earth were looking at each other, one of which would
  vanish quickly as a bloody dream, and the other, dressed in simple garments,
  would seize in eternal possession the world and the city.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cæsar had passed; and immediately after him eight Africans bore
  a magnificent litter, in which sat Poppæa, who was detested by the people.
  Arrayed, as was Nero, in amethyst color, with a thick application of
  cosmetics on her face, immovable, thoughtful, indifferent, she looked like
  some beautiful and wicked divinity carried in procession. In her wake
  followed a whole court of servants, male and female, next a line of wagons
  bearing materials of dress and use. The sun had sunk sensibly from midday
  when the passage of Augustians began,&mdash;a brilliant glittering line
  gleaming like an endless serpent. The indolent Petronius, greeted kindly by
  the multitude, had given command to bear him and his godlike slave in a
  litter. Tigellinus went in a chariot drawn by ponies ornamented with white
  and purple feathers, They saw him as he rose in the chariot repeatedly, and
  stretched his neck to see if Cæsar was preparing to give him the sign to go
  his chariot. Among others the crowd greeted Licinianus with applause,
  Vitelius with laughter, Vatinius with hissing. Towards Licinus and Lecanius
  the consuls they were indifferent, but Tullius Senecio they loved, it was
  unknown why, and Vestinius received applause.</p>

  <p>The court was innumerable. It seemed that all that was richest, most
  brilliant and noted in Rome, was migrating to Antium. Nero never travelled
  otherwise than with thousands of vehicles; the society which accompanied him
  almost always exceeded the number of soldiers in a legion. [In the time of
  the Cæsars a legion was always 12,000 men.] Hence Domitius Afer appeared, and
  the decrepit Lucius Saturninus; and Vespasian, who had not gone yet on his
  expedition to Judea, from which he returned for the crown of Cæsar, and his
  sons, and young Nerva, and Lucan, and Annius Gallo, and Quintianus, and a
  multitude of women renowned for wealth, beauty, luxury, and vice.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the multitude were turned to the harness, the chariots, the
  horses, the strange livery of the servants, made up of all peoples of the
  earth. In that procession of pride and grandeur one hardly knew what to look
  at; and not only the eye, but the mind, was dazzled by such gleaming of gold,
  purple, and violet, by the flashing of precious stones, the glitter of
  brocade, pearls, and ivory. It seemed that the very rays of the sun were
  dissolving in that abyss of brilliancy. And though wretched people were not
  lacking in that throng, people with sunken stomachs, and with hunger in their
  eyes, that spectacle inflamed not only their desire of enjoyment and their
  envy, but filled them with delight and pride, because it gave a feeling of
  the might and invincibility of Rome, to which the world contributed, and
  before which the world knelt. Indeed there was not on earth any one who
  ventured to think that that power would not endure through all ages, and
  outlive all nations, or that there was anything in existence that had
  strength to oppose it.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, riding at the end of the retinue, sprang out of his chariot at
  sight of the Apostle and Lygia, whom he had not expected to see, and,
  greeting them with a radiant face, spoke with hurried voice, like a man who
  has no time to spare,&mdash;&ldquo;Hast thou come? I know not how to thank
  thee, O Lygia! God could not have sent me a better omen. I greet thee even
  while taking farewell, but not farewell for a long time. On the road I shall
  dispose relays of horses, and every free day I shall come to thee till I get
  leave to return.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, Marcus!&rdquo; answered Lygia; then she added in a lower
  voice: &ldquo;May Christ go with thee, and open thy soul to Paul&rsquo;s
  word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was glad at heart that she was concerned about his becoming a Christian
  soon; hence he answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ocelle mi! let it be as thou sayest. Paul prefers to travel with my
  people, but he is with me, and will be to me a companion and master. Draw
  aside thy veil, my delight, let me see thee before my journey. Why art thou
  thus hidden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised the veil, and showed him her bright face and her wonderfully
  smiling eyes, inquiring,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is the veil bad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And her smile had in it a little of maiden opposition; but Vinicius, while
  looking at her with delight, answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad for my eyes, which till death would look on thee
  only.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Ursus and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ursus, guard her as the sight in thy eye, for she is my domina as
  well as thine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seizing her hand then, he pressed it with his lips, to the great
  astonishment of the crowd, who could not understand signs of such honor from
  a brilliant Augustian to a maiden arrayed in simple garments, almost those of
  a slave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he departed quickly, for Cæsar&rsquo;s whole retinue had pushed
  forward considerably. The Apostle Peter blessed him with a slight sign of the
  cross; but the kindly Ursus began at once to glorify him, glad that his young
  mistress listened eagerly and was grateful to him for those praises.</p>

  <p>The retinue moved on and hid itself in clouds of golden dust; they gazed
  long after it, however, till Demas the miller approached, he for whom Ursus
  worked in the night-time. When he had kissed the Apostle&rsquo;s hand, he
  entreated them to enter his dwelling for refreshment, saying that it was near
  the Emporium, that they must be hungry and wearied since they had spent the
  greater part of the day at the gate.</p>

  <p>They went with him, and, after rest and refreshment in his house, returned
  to the Trans-Tiber only toward evening. Intending to cross the river by the
  Æmilian bridge, they passed through the Clivus Publicus, going over the
  Aventine, between the temples of Diana and Mercury. From that height the
  Apostle looked on the edifices about him, and on those vanishing in the
  distance. Sunk in silence he meditated on the immensity and dominion of that
  city, to which he had come to announce the word of God. Hitherto he had seen
  the rule of Rome and its legions in various lands through which he had
  wandered, but they were single members as it were of the power, which that
  day for the first time he had seen impersonated in the form of Nero. That
  city, immense, predatory, ravenous, unrestrained, rotten to the marrow of its
  bones, and unassailable in its preterhuman power; that Cæsar, a fratricide, a
  matricide, a wife-slayer, after him dragged a retinue of bloody spectres no
  less in number than his court. That profligate, that buffoon, but also lord
  of thirty legions, and through them of the whole earth; those courtiers
  covered with gold and scarlet, uncertain of the morrow, but mightier
  meanwhile than kings,&mdash;all this together seemed a species of hellish
  kingdom of wrong and evil. In his simple heart he marvelled that God could
  give such inconceivable almightiness to Satan, that He could yield the earth
  to him to knead, overturn, and trample it, to squeeze blood and tears from
  it, to twist it like a whirlwind, to storm it like a tempest, to consume it
  like a flame. And his Apostle-heart was alarmed by those thoughts, and in
  spirit he spoke to the Master: &ldquo;O Lord, how shall I begin in this city,
  to which Thou hast sent me? To it belong seas and lands, the beasts of the
  field, and the creatures of the water; it owns other kingdoms and cities, and
  thirty legions which guard them; but I, O Lord, am a fisherman from a lake!
  How shall I begin, and how shall I conquer its malice?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking he raised his gray, trembling head toward heaven, praying
  and exclaiming from the depth of his heart to his Divine Master, himself full
  of sadness and fear.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile his prayer was interrupted by Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The whole city is as if on fire,&rdquo; said she.</p>

  <p>In fact the sun went down that day in a marvellous manner. Its immense
  shield had sunk half-way behind the Janiculum, the whole expanse of heaven
  was filled with a red gleam. From the place on which they were standing,
  Peter&rsquo;s glance embraced large expanses. Somewhat to the right they saw
  the long extending walls of the Circus Maximus; above it the towering palaces
  of the Palatine; and directly in front of them, beyond the Forum Boarium and
  the Velabrum, the summit of the Capitol, with the temple of Jupiter. But the
  walls and the columns and the summits of the temples were as if sunk in that
  golden and purple gleam. The parts of the river visible from afar flowed as
  if in blood; and as the sun sank moment after moment behind the mountain, the
  gleam became redder and redder, more and more like a conflagration, and it
  increased and extended till finally it embraced the seven hills, from which
  it extended to the whole region about.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The whole city seems on fire!&rdquo; repeated Lygia.</p>

  <p>Peter shaded his eyes with his hand, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The wrath of God is upon it.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Vincius</i> to <i>Lygia</i>:</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;The slave Phlegon, by whom I send this letter, is a
Christian;
  hence he will be one of those to receive freedom from thy hands, my dearest.
  He is an old servant of our house; so I can write to thee with full
  confidence, and without fear that the letter will fall into other hands than
  thine. I write from Laurentum, where we have halted because of heat. Otho
  owned here a lordly villa, which on a time he presented to Poppæa; and she,
  though divorced from him, saw fit to retain the magnificent present. When I
  think of the women who surround me now and of thee, it seems to me that from
  the stones hurled by Deucalion there must have risen people of various kinds,
  altogether unlike one another, and that thou art of those born of
  crystal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I admire and love thee from my whole soul, and wish to speak only
  of thee; hence I am forced to constrain myself to write of our journey, of
  that which happens to me, and of news of the court. Well, Cæsar was the guest
  of Poppæa, who prepared for him secretly a magnificent reception. She invited
  only a few of his favorites, but Petronius and I were among them. After
  dinner we sailed in golden boats over the sea, which was as calm as if it had
  been sleeping, and as blue as thy eyes, O divine one. We ourselves rowed, for
  evidently it flattered the Augusta that men of consular dignity, or their
  sons, were rowing for her. Cæsar, sitting at the rudder in a purple toga,
  sang a hymn in honor of the sea; this hymn he had composed the night before,
  and with Diodorus had arranged music to it. In other boats he was accompanied
  by slaves from India who knew how to play on sea-shells while round about
  appeared numerous dolphins, as if really enticed from Amphitrite&rsquo;s
  depths by music. Dost thou know what I was doing? I was thinking of thee, and
  yearning. I wanted to gather in that sea, that calm, and that music, and give
  the whole to thee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou wish that we should live in some place at the seashore
  far from Rome, my Augusta? I have land in Sicily, on which there is an almond
  forest which has rose-colored blossoms in spring, and this forest goes down
  so near the sea that the tips of the branches almost touch the water. There I
  will love thee and magnify Paul&rsquo;s teaching, for I know now that it will
  not be opposed to love and happiness. Dost thou wish?&mdash;But before I hear
  thy answer I will write further of what happened on the boat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soon the shore was far behind. We saw a sail before us in the
  distance, and all at once a dispute rose as to whether it was a common
  fishing-boat or a great ship from Ostia. I was the first to discover what it
  was, and then the Augusta said that for my eyes evidently nothing was hidden,
  and, dropping the veil over her face on a sudden, she inquired if I could
  recognize her thus. Petronius answered immediately that it was not possible
  to see even the sun behind a cloud; but she said, as if in jest, that love
  alone could blind such a piercing glance as mine, and, naming various women
  of the court, she fell to inquiring and guessing which one I loved. I
  answered calmly, but at last she mentioned thy name. Speaking of thee, she
  uncovered her face again, and looked at me with evil and inquiring eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feel real gratitude to Petronius, who turned the boat at that
  moment, through which general attention was taken from me; for had I heard
  hostile or sneering words touching thee, I should not have been able to hide
  my anger, and should have had to struggle with the wish to break the head of
  that wicked, malicious woman with my oar. Thou rememberest the incident at
  the pond of Agrippa about which I told thee at the house of Linus on the eve
  of my departure. Petronius is alarmed on my account, and to-day again he
  implored me not to offend the Augusta&rsquo;s vanity. But Petronius does not
  understand me, and does not realize that, apart from thee, I know no pleasure
  or beauty or love, and that for Poppæa I feel only disgust and contempt. Thou
  hast changed my soul greatly,&mdash;so greatly that I should not wish now to
  return to my former life. But have no fear that harm may reach me here.
  Poppæa does not love me, for she cannot love any one, and her desires arise
  only from anger at Cæsar, who is under her influence yet, and who is even
  capable of loving her yet; still, he does not spare her, and does not hide
  from her his transgressions and shamelessness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell thee, besides, something which should pacify thee.
  Peter told me in parting not to fear Cæsar, since a hair would not fall from
  my head; and I believe him. Some voice in my soul says that every word of his
  must be accomplished; that since he blessed our love, neither Cæsar, nor all
  the powers of Hades, nor predestination itself, could take thee from me, O
  Lygia. When I think of this I am as happy as if I were in heaven, which alone
  is calm and happy. But what I say of heaven and predestination may offend
  thee, a Christian. Christ has not washed me yet, but my heart is like an
  empty chalice, which Paul of Tarsus is to fill with the sweet doctrine
  professed by thee,&mdash;the sweeter for me that it is thine. Thou, divine
  one, count even this as a merit to me that I have emptied it of the liquid
  with which I had filled it before, and that I do not withdraw it, but hold it
  forth as a thirsty man standing at a pure spring. Let me find favor in thy
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Antium my days and nights will pass in listening to Paul, who
  acquired such influence among my people on the first day that they surround
  him continually, seeing in him not only a wonder-worker, but a being almost
  supernatural. Yesterday I saw gladness on his face, and when I asked what he
  was doing, he answered, &lsquo;I am sowing!&rsquo; Petronius knows that he is
  among my people, and wishes to see him, as does Seneca also, who heard of him
  from Gallo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the stars are growing pale, O Lygia, and &lsquo;Lucifer&rsquo;
  of the morning is bright with growing force. Soon the dawn will make the sea
  ruddy; all is sleeping round about, but I am thinking of thee and loving
  thee. Be greeted together with the morning dawn, sponsa mea!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38">CHAPTER XXXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Vincius</i> to <i>Lygia</i>:</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Hast thou ever been in Antium, my dear one, with
Aulus and
  Pomponia? If not, I shall be happy when I show this place to thee. All the
  way from Laurentum there is a line of villas along the seashore; and Antium
  itself is an endless succession of palaces and porticos, whose columns in
  fair weather see themselves in the water. I, too, have a residence here right
  over the sea, with an olive garden and a forest of cypresses behind the
  villa, and when I think that the place will sometime be thine, its marble
  seems whiter to me, its groves more shady, and the sea bluer. Oh, Lygia, how
  good it is to live and love! Old Menikles, who manages the villa, planted
  irises on the ground under myrtles, and at sight of them the house of Aulus,
  the impluvium, and the garden in which I sat near thee, came to my mind. The
  irises will remind thee, too, of thy childhood&rsquo;s home; therefore I am
  certain that thou wilt love Antium and this villa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Immediately after our arrival I talked long with Paul at dinner. We
  spoke of thee, and afterward he taught. I listened long, and I say only this,
  that even could I write like Petronius, I should not have power to explain
  everything which passed through my soul and my mind. I had not supposed that
  there could be such happiness in this world, such beauty and peace of which
  hitherto people had no knowledge. But I retain all this for conversation with
  thee, for at the first free moment I shall be in Rome.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could the earth find place at once for the Apostle Peter, Paul
  of Tarsus, and Cæsar? Tell me this. I ask because I passed the evening after
  Paul&rsquo;s teaching with Nero, and dost thou know what I heard there? Well,
  to begin with, he read his poem on the destruction of Troy, and complained
  that never had he seen a burning city. He envied Priam, and called him happy
  just for this, that he saw the conflagration and ruin of his birthplace.
  Whereupon Tigellinus said, &rsquo;Speak a word, O divinity, I will take a
  torch, and before the night passes thou shalt see blazing Antium.&rsquo; But
  Cæsar called him a fool. &lsquo;Where,&rsquo; asked he, &rsquo;should I go to
  breathe the sea air, and preserve the voice with which the gods have gifted
  me, and which men say I should preserve for the benefit of mankind? Is it not
  Rome that injures me; is it not the exhalations of the Subura and the
  Esquiline which add to my hoarseness? Would not the palaces of Rome present a
  spectacle a hundredfold more tragic and magnificent than Antium?&rsquo; Here
  all began to talk, and to say what an unheard tragedy the picture of a city
  like that would be, a city which had conquered the world turned now into a
  heap of gray ashes. Cæsar declared that then his poem would surpass the songs
  of Homer, and he began to describe how he would rebuild the city, and how
  coming ages would admire his achievements, in presence of which all other
  human works would be petty. &lsquo;Do that! do that!&rsquo; exclaimed the
  drunken company. &lsquo;I must have more faithful and more devoted
  friends,&rsquo; answered he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I confess that I was alarmed at once when I heard this, for thou
  art in Rome, carissima. I laugh now at that alarm, and I think that Cæsar and
  his friends, though mad, would not dare to permit such insanity. Still, see
  how a man fears for his love; I should prefer that the house of Linus were
  not in that narrow Trans-Tiber alley, and in a part occupied by common
  people, who are less considered in such a case. For me, the very palaces on
  the Palatine would not be a residence fit for thee; hence I should wish also
  that nothing were lacking thee of those ornaments and comforts to which thou
  art accustomed from childhood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to the house of Aulus, my Lygia. I have thought much here over
  this matter. If Cæsar were in Rome, news of thy return might reach the
  Palatine through slaves, turn attention to thee, and bring persecution,
  because thou didst dare to act against the will of Cæsar. But he will remain
  long in Antium, and before he returns slaves will have ceased to speak of
  thee. Linus and Ursus can be with thee. Besides, I live in hope that before
  Palatine sees Cæsar, thou, my goddess, shalt be dwelling in thy own house on
  the Carinæ. Blessed be the day, hour, and moment in which thou shalt cross my
  threshold; and if Christ, whom I am learning to accept, effects this, may His
  name be blessed also. I shall serve Him, and give life and blood for Him. I
  speak incorrectly; we shall serve Him, both of us, as long as the threads of
  life hold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love thee and salute thee with my whole soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39">CHAPTER XXXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Unsus was taking water from a cistern, and while drawing up
  a double amphora, with a rope, was singing a strange Lygian song in an
  undertone, looking meanwhile with delighted eyes at Lygia and Vinicius, who,
  among the cypresses in Linus&rsquo;s garden, seemed as white as two statues.
  Their clothing was not moved by the least breeze. A golden and lily-colored
  twilight was sinking on the world while they were conversing in the calm of
  evening, each holding the other by the hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May not some evil meet thee, Marcus, because thou hast left Antium
  without Cæsar&rsquo;s knowledge?&rdquo; asked Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; answered Vinicius. &ldquo;Cæsar announced that
  he would shut himself in for two days with Terpnos, and compose new songs. He
  acts thus frequently, and at such times neither knows nor remembers aught
  else. Moreover, what is Cæsar to me since I am near thee and am looking at
  thee? I have yearned too much already, and these last nights sleep has left
  me. More than once, when I dozed from weariness, I woke on a sudden, with a
  feeling that danger was hanging over thee; at times I dreamed that the relays
  of horses which were to bear me from Antium to Rome were stolen,&mdash;horses
  with which I passed that road more swiftly than any of Cæsar&rsquo;s
  couriers. Besides, I could not live longer without thee; I love thee too much
  for that, my dearest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew that thou wert coming. Twice Ursus ran out, at my request,
  to the Carinæ, and inquired for thee at thy house. Linus laughed at me, and
  Ursus also.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, evident that she had expected him; for instead of her
  usual dark dress, she wore a soft white stola, out of whose beautiful folds
  her arms and head emerged like primroses out of snow. A few ruddy anemones
  ornamented her hair.</p>

  <p>Vinicius pressed his lips to her hands; then they sat on the stone bench
  amidst wild grapevines, and inclining toward each other, were silent, looking
  at the twilight whose last gleams were reflected in their eyes.</p>

  <p>The charm of the quiet evening mastered them completely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How calm it is here, and how beautiful the world is,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius, in a lowered voice. &ldquo;The night is wonderfully still. I feel
  happier than ever in life before. Tell me, Lygia, what is this? Never have I
  thought that there could be such love. I thought that love was merely fire in
  the blood and desire; but now for the first time I see that it is possible to
  love with every drop of one&rsquo;s blood and every breath, and feel
  therewith such sweet and immeasurable calm as if Sleep and Death had put the
  soul to rest. For me this is something new. I look on this calmness of the
  trees, and it seems to be within me. Now I understand for the first time that
  there may be happiness of which people have not known thus far. Now I begin
  to understand why thou and Pomponia Græcina have such peace. Yes! Christ
  gives it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment Lygia placed her beautiful face on his shoulder and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Marcus&mdash;&rdquo; But she was unable to
  continue. Joy, gratitude, and the feeling that at last she was free to love
  deprived her of voice, and her eyes were filled with tears of emotion.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, embracing her slender form with his arm, drew her toward him and
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;Lygia! May the moment be blessed in which I heard His name
  for the first time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love thee, Marcus,&rdquo; said she then in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Both were silent again, unable to bring words from their overcharged
  breasts. The last lily reflections had died on the cypresses, and the garden
  began to be silver-like from the crescent of the moon. After a while Vinicius
  said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. Barely had I entered here, barely had I kissed thy dear
  hands, when I read in thy eyes the question whether I had received the divine
  doctrine to which thou art attached, and whether I was baptized. No, I am not
  baptized yet; but knowest thou, my flower, why? Paul said to me: &rsquo;I
  have convinced thee that God came into the world and gave Himself to be
  crucified for its salvation; but let Peter wash thee in the fountain of
  grace, he who first stretched his hands over thee and blessed thee.&rsquo;
  And I, my dearest, wish thee to witness my baptism, and I wish Pomponia to be
  my godmother. This is why I am not baptized yet, though I believe in the
  Saviour and in his teaching. Paul has convinced me, has converted me; and
  could it be otherwise? How was I not to believe that Christ came into the
  world, since he, who was His disciple, says so, and Paul, to whom He
  appeared? How was I not to believe that He was God, since He rose from the
  dead? Others saw Him in the city and on the lake and on the mountain; people
  saw Him whose lips have not known a lie. I began to believe this the first
  time I heard Peter in Ostrianum, for I said to myself even then: In the whole
  world any other man might lie rather than this one who says, &lsquo;I
  saw.&rsquo; But I feared thy religion. It seemed to me that thy religion
  would take thee from me. I thought that there was neither wisdom nor beauty
  nor happiness in it. But to-day, when I know it, what kind of man should I be
  were I not to wish truth to rule the world instead of falsehood, love instead
  of hatred, virtue instead of crime, faithfulness instead of unfaithfulness,
  mercy instead of vengeance? What sort of man would he be who would not choose
  and wish the same? But your religion teaches this. Others desire justice
  also; but thy religion is the only one which makes man&rsquo;s heart just,
  and besides makes it pure, like thine and Pomponia&rsquo;s, makes it
  faithful, like thine and Pomponia&rsquo;s. I should be blind were I not to
  see this. But if in addition Christ God has promised eternal life, and has
  promised happiness as immeasurable as the all-might of God can give, what
  more can one wish? Were I to ask Seneca why he enjoins virtue, if wickedness
  brings more happiness, he would not be able to say anything sensible. But I
  know now that I ought to be virtuous, because virtue and love flow from
  Christ, and because, when death closes my eyes, I shall find life and
  happiness, I shall find myself and thee. Why not love and accept a religion
  which both speaks the truth and destroys death? Who would not prefer good to
  evil? I thought thy religion opposed to happiness; meanwhile Paul has
  convinced me that not only does it not take away, but that it gives. All this
  hardly finds a place in my head; but I feel that it is true, for I have never
  been so happy, neither could I be, had I taken thee by force and possessed
  thee in my house. Just see, thou hast said a moment since, &lsquo;I love
  thee,&rsquo; and I could not have won these words from thy lips with all the
  might of Rome. O Lygia! Reason declares this religion divine, and the best;
  the heart feels it, and who can resist two such forces?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia listened, fixing on him her blue eyes, which in the light of the
  moon were like mystic flowers, and bedewed like flowers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Marcus, that is true!&rdquo; said she, nestling her head more
  closely to his shoulder.</p>

  <p>And at that moment they felt immensely happy, for they understood that
  besides love they were united by another power, at once sweet and
  irresistible, by which love itself becomes endless, not subject to change,
  deceit, treason, or even death. Their hearts were filled with perfect
  certainty that, no matter what might happen, they would not cease to love and
  belong to each other. For that reason an unspeakable repose flowed in on
  their souls. Vinicius felt, besides, that that love was not merely profound
  and pure, but altogether new,&mdash;such as the world had not known and could
  not give. In his head all was combined in this love,&mdash;Lygia, the
  teaching of Christ, the light of the moon resting calmly on the cypresses,
  and the still night,&mdash;so that to him the whole universe seemed filled
  with it.</p>

  <p>After a while he said with a lowered and quivering voice: &ldquo;Thou wilt
  be the soul of my soul, and the dearest in the world to me. Our hearts will
  beat together, we shall have one prayer and one gratitude to Christ. O my
  dear! To live together, to honor together the sweet God, and to know that
  when death comes our eyes will open again, as after a pleasant sleep, to a
  new light,&mdash;what better could be imagined? I only marvel that I did not
  understand this at first. And knowest thou what occurs to me now? That no one
  can resist this religion. In two hundred or three hundred years the whole
  world will accept it. People will forget Jupiter, and there will be no God
  except Christ, and no other temples but Christian. Who would not wish his own
  happiness? Ah! but I heard Paul&rsquo;s conversation with Petronius and dost
  thou know what Petronius said at the end? &lsquo;That is not for me&rsquo;;
  but he could give no other answer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Repeat Paul&rsquo;s words to me,&rdquo; said Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was at my house one evening. Petronius began to speak playfully
  and to banter, as he does usually, whereupon Paul said to him: &rsquo;How
  canst thou deny, O wise Petronius, that Christ existed and rose from the
  dead, since thou wert not in the world at that time, but Peter and John saw
  Him, and I saw Him on the road to Damascus? Let thy wisdom show, first of
  all, then, that we are liars, and then only deny our testimony.&rsquo;
  Petronius answered that he had no thought of denying, for he knew that many
  incomprehensible things were done, which trustworthy people affirmed.
  &lsquo;But the discovery of some new foreign god is one thing,&rsquo; said
  he, &rsquo;and the reception of his teaching another. I have no wish to know
  anything which may deform life and mar its beauty. Never mind whether our
  gods are true or not; they are beautiful, their rule is pleasant for us, and
  we live without care.&rsquo; &rsquo;Thou art willing to reject the religion
  of love, justice, and mercy through dread of the cares of life,&rsquo;
  replied Paul; &rsquo;but think, Petronius, is thy life really free from
  anxieties? Behold, neither thou nor any man among the richest and most
  powerful knows when he falls asleep at night that he may not wake to a death
  sentence. But tell me, if Cæsar professed this religion, which enjoins love
  and justice, would not thy happiness be more assured? Thou art alarmed about
  thy delight, but would not life be more joyous then? As to life&rsquo;s
  beauty and ornaments, if ye have reared so many beautiful temples and statues
  to evil, revengeful, adulterous, and faithless divinities, what would ye not
  do in honor of one God of truth and mercy? Thou art ready to praise thy lot,
  because thou art wealthy and living in luxury; but it was possible even in
  thy case to be poor and deserted, though coming of a great house, and then in
  truth it would have been better for thee if people confessed Christ. In Rome
  even wealthy parents, unwilling to toil at rearing children, cast them out of
  the house frequently; those children are called alumni. And chance might have
  made thee an alumnus, like one of those. But if parents live according to our
  religion, this cannot happen. And hadst thou, at manhood&rsquo;s years,
  married a woman of thy love, thy wish would be to see her faithful till
  death. Meanwhile look around, what happens among you, what vileness, what
  shame, what bartering in the faith of wives! Nay, ye yourselves are
  astonished when a woman appears whom ye call &ldquo;univira&rdquo; (of one
  husband). But I tell thee that those women who carry Christ in their hearts
  will not break faith with their husbands, just as Christian husbands will
  keep faith with their wives. But ye are neither sure of rulers nor fathers
  nor wives nor children nor servants. The whole world is trembling before you,
  and ye are trembling before your own slaves, for ye know that any hour may
  raise an awful war against your oppression, such a war as has been raised
  more than once. Though rich, thou art not sure that the command may not come
  to thee to-morrow to leave thy wealth; thou art young, but to-morrow it may
  be necessary for thee to die. Thou lovest, but treason is in wait for thee;
  thou art enamoured of villas and statues, but to-morrow power may thrust thee
  forth into the empty places of the Pandataria; thou hast thousands of
  servants, but to-morrow these servants may let thy blood flow. And if that be
  the case, how canst thou be calm and happy, how canst thou live in delight?
  But I proclaim love, and I proclaim a religion which commands rulers to love
  their subjects, masters their slaves, slaves to serve with love, to do
  justice and be merciful; and at last it promises happiness boundless as a sea
  without end. How, then, Petronius, canst thou say that that religion spoils
  life, since it corrects, and since thou thyself wouldst be a hundred times
  happier and more secure were it to embrace the world as Rome&rsquo;s dominion
  has embraced it?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thus discussed Paul, and then Petronius said, &lsquo;That is not
  for me.&rsquo; Feigning drowsiness, he went out, and when going added:
  &rsquo;I prefer my Eunice, O little Jew, but I should not wish to struggle
  with thee on the platform.&rsquo; I listened to Paul&rsquo;s words with my
  whole soul, and when he spoke of our women, I magnified with all my heart
  that religion from which thou hast sprung as a lily from a rich field in
  springtime. And I thought then: There is Poppæa, who cast aside two husbands
  for Nero, there is Calvia Crispinilla, there is Nigidia, there are almost all
  whom I know, save only Pomponia; they trafficked with faith and with oaths,
  but she and my own one will not desert, will not deceive, and will not quench
  the fire, even though all in whom I place trust should desert and deceive me.
  Hence I said to thee in my soul, How can I show gratitude to thee, if not
  with love and honor? Didst thou feel that in Antium I spoke and conversed
  with thee all the time as if thou hadst been at my side? I love thee a
  hundred times more for having escaped me from Cæsar&rsquo;s house. Neither do
  I care for Cæsar&rsquo;s house any longer; I wish not its luxury and music, I
  wish only thee. Say a word, we will leave Rome to settle somewhere at a
  distance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without removing her head from his shoulder, Lygia, as if meditating,
  raised her eyes to the silver tops of the cypresses, and
  answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Very well, Marcus. Thou hast written to me of Sicily,
  where Aulus wishes to settle in old age.&rdquo; And Vinieius interrupted her
  with delight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, my dear! Our lands are adjacent. That is a wonderful coast,
  where the climate is sweeter and the nights still brighter than in Rome,
  odoriferous and transparent. There life and happiness are almost one and the
  same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he began then to dream of the future.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There we may forget anxieties. In groves, among olive-trees, we
  shall walk and rest in the shade. O Lygia! what a life to love and cherish
  each other, to look at the sea together, to look at the sky together, to
  honor together a kind God, to do in peace what is just and true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both were silent, looking into the future; only he drew her more firmly
  toward him, and the knight&rsquo;s ring on his finger glittered meanwhile in
  the rays of the moon. In the part occupied by the poor toiling people, all
  were sleeping; no murmur broke the silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wilt thou permit me to see Pomponia?&rdquo; asked Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear one. We will invite them to our house, or go to them
  ourselves. If thou wish, we can take Peter the Apostle. He is bowed down with
  age and work. Paul will visit us also,&mdash;he will convert Aulus Plautius;
  and as soldiers found colonies in distant lands, so we will found a colony of
  Christians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia raised her hand and, taking his palm, wished to press it to her
  lips; but he whispered, as if fearing to frighten happiness,&mdash;&ldquo;No,
  Lygia, no! It is I who honor thee and exalt thee; give me thy
  hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had pressed his lips to her hands, white as jessamine, and for a time
  they heard only the beating of their own hearts. There was not the slightest
  movement in the air; the cypresses stood as motionless as if they too were
  holding breath in their breasts.</p>

  <p>All at once the silence was broken by an unexpected thunder, deep, and as
  if coming from under the earth. A shiver ran through Lygia&rsquo;s body.
  Vinicius stood up, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Lions are roaring in the
  vivarium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both began to listen. Now the first thunder was answered by a second, a
  third, a tenth, from all sides and divisions of the city. In Rome several
  thousand lions were quartered at times in various arenas, and frequently in
  the night-time they approached the grating, and, leaning their gigantic heads
  against it, gave utterance to their yearning for freedom and the desert. Thus
  they began on this occasion, and, answering one another in the stillness of
  night, they filled the whole city with roaring. There was something so
  indescribably gloomy and terrible in those roars that Lygia, whose bright and
  calm visions of the future were scattered, listened with a straitened heart
  and with wonderful fear and sadness.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius encircled her with his arm, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not,
  dear one. The games are at hand, and all the vivaria are crowded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then both entered the house of Linus, accompanied by the thunder of lions,
  growing louder and louder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40">CHAPTER XL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In Antium, meanwhile, Petronius gained new victories almost
  daily over courtiers vying with him for the favor of Cæsar. The influence of
  Tigellinus had fallen completely. In Rome, when there was occasion to set
  aside men who seemed dangerous, to plunder their property or to settle
  political cases, to give spectacles astounding by their luxury and bad taste,
  or finally to satisfy the monstrous whims of Cæsar, Tigellinus, as adroit, as
  he was ready for anything, became indispensable. But in Antium, among palaces
  reflected in the azure of the sea, Cæsar led a Hellenic existence. From
  morning till evening Nero and his attendants read verses, discoursed on their
  structure and finish, were delighted with happy turns of expression, were
  occupied with music, the theatre,&mdash;in a word, exclusively with that
  which Grecian genius had invented, and with which it had beautified life.
  Under these conditions Petronius, incomparably more refined than Tigellinus
  and the other courtiers,&mdash;witty, eloquent, full of subtile feelings and
  tastes,&mdash;obtained pre-eminence of necessity. Cæsar sought his society,
  took his opinion, asked for advice when he composed, and showed a more lively
  friendship than at any other time whatever. It seemed to courtiers that his
  influence had won a supreme triumph at last, that friendship between him and
  Cæsar had entered on a period of certainty which would last for years. Even
  those who had shown dislike previously to the exquisite Epicurean, began now
  to crowd around him and vie for his favor. More than one was even sincerely
  glad in his soul that preponderance had come to a man who knew really what to
  think of a given person, who received with a sceptical smile the flattery of
  his enemies of yesterday, but who, either through indolence or culture, was
  not vengeful, and did not use his power to the detriment or destruction of
  others. There were moments when he might have destroyed even Tigellinus, but
  he preferred to ridicule him, and expose his vulgarity and want of
  refinement. In Rome the Senate drew breath, for no death sentence had been
  issued for a month and a half. It is true that in Antium and the city people
  told wonders of the refinement which the profligacy of Cæsar and his favorite
  had reached, but every one preferred a refined Cæsar to one brutalized in the
  hands of Tigellinus. Tigellinus himself lost his head, and hesitated whether
  or not to yield as conquered, for Cæsar had said repeatedly that in all Rome
  and in his court there were only two spirits capable of understanding each
  other, two real Hellenes,&mdash;he and Petronius.</p>

  <p>The amazing dexterity of Petronius confirmed people in the conviction that
  his influence would outlive every other. They did not see how Cæsar could
  dispense with him,&mdash;with whom could he converse touching poetry, music,
  and comparative excellence; in whose eyes could he look to learn whether his
  creation was indeed perfect? Petronius, with his habitual indifference,
  seemed to attach no importance to his position. As usual, he was remiss,
  slothful, sceptical, and witty. He produced on people frequently the
  impression of a man who made light of them, of himself, of Cæsar, of the
  whole world. At moments he ventured to criticise Cæsar to his face, and when
  others judged that he was going too far, or simply preparing his own ruin, he
  was able to turn the criticism suddenly in such a way that it came out to his
  profit; he roused amazement in those present, and the conviction that there
  was no position from which he could not issue in triumph.</p>

  <p>About a week after the return of Vinicius from Rome, Cæsar read in a small
  circle an extract from his Troyad; when he had finished and the shouts of
  rapture had ended, Petronius, interrogated by a glance from Cæsar,
  replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Common verses, fit for the fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The hearts of those present stopped beating from terror. Since the years
  of his childhood Nero had never heard such a sentence from any man. The face
  of Tigellinus was radiant with delight. But Vinicius grew pale, thinking that
  Petronius, who thus far had never been drunk, was drunk this time.</p>

  <p>Nero, however, inquired in a honeyed voice, in which more or less deeply
  wounded vanity was quivering,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What defect dost thou find in them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not believe them,&rdquo; said Petronius, attacking him, and
  pointing to those present; &ldquo;they understand nothing. Thou hast asked
  what defect there is in thy verses. If thou desire truth, I will tell thee.
  Thy verses would be worthy of Virgil, of Ovid, even of Homer, but they are
  not worthy of thee. Thou art not free to write such. The conflagration
  described by thee does not blaze enough; thy fire is not hot enough. Listen
  not to Lucan&rsquo;s flatteries. Had he written those verses, I should
  acknowledge him a genius, but thy case is different. And knowest thou why?
  Thou art greater than they. From him who is gifted of the gods as thou art,
  more is demanded. But thou art slothful,&mdash;thou wouldst rather sleep
  after dinner than sit to wrinkles. Thou canst create a work such as the world
  has not heard of to this day; hence I tell thee to thy eyes, write
  better!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he said this carelessly, as if bantering and also chiding; but
  Cæsar&rsquo;s eyes were mist-covered from delight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods have given me a little talent,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
  they have given me something greater, a true judge and friend, the only man
  able to speak the truth to my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he stretched his fat hand, grown over with reddish hair, to a golden
  candelabrum plundered from Delphi, to burn the verses. But Petronius seized
  them before the flame touched the paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;even thus they belong to mankind.
  Leave them to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In such case let me send them to thee in a cylinder of my own
  invention,&rdquo; answered Nero, embracing Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True; thou art right,&rdquo; said he, after a while. &ldquo;My
  conflagration of Troy does not blaze enough; my fire is not hot enough. But I
  thought it sufficient to equal Homer. A certain timidity and low estimate of
  my power have fettered me always. Thou hast opened my eyes. But knowest why
  it is, as thou sayest? When a sculptor makes the statue of a god, he seeks a
  model; but never have I had a model. I never have seen a burning city; hence
  there is a lack of truth in my description.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I will say that only a great artist understands
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero grew thoughtful, and after a while he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Answer one
  question, Petronius. Dost thou regret the burning of Troy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I regret? By the lame consort of Venus, not in the least! And I
  will tell thee the reason. Troy would not have been consumed if Prometheus
  had not given fire to man, and the Greeks made war on Priam. Æschylus would
  not have written his Prometheus had there been no fire, just as Homer would
  not have written the Iliad had there been no Trojan war. I think it better to
  have Prometheus and the Iliad than a small and shabby city, which was
  unclean, I think, and wretched, and in which at best there would be now some
  procurator annoying thee through quarrels with the local
  areopagus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is what we call speaking with sound reason,&rdquo; said Nero.
  &ldquo;For art and poetry it is permitted, and it is right, to sacrifice
  everything. Happy were the Achæans who furnished Homer with the substance of
  the Iliad, and happy Priam who beheld the ruin of his birthplace. As to me, I
  have never seen a burning city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A time of silence followed, which was broken at last by Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I have said to thee, Cæsar, already, command and I will burn
  Antium; or dost thou know what? If thou art sorry for these villas and
  palaces, give command to burn the ships in Ostia; or I will build a wooden
  city on the Alban Hills, into which thou shalt hurl the fire thyself. Dost
  thou wish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I to gaze on the burning of wooden sheds?&rdquo; asked Nero,
  casting a look of contempt on him. &ldquo;Thy mind has grown utterly barren,
  Tigellinus. And I see, besides, that thou dost set no great value on my
  talent or my Troyad, since thou judgest that any sacrifice would be too great
  for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus was confused; but Nero, as if wishing to change the
  conversation, added after a while,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Summer is passing. Oh, what a stench there must be in that Rome
  now! And still we must return for the summer games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When thou dismissest the Augustians, O Cæsar, permit me to remain
  with thee a moment,&rdquo; said Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>An hour later Vinicius, returning with Petronius from Cæsar&rsquo;s villa,
  said,&mdash;&ldquo;I was a trifle alarmed for thee. I judged that while drunk
  thou hadst ruined thyself beyond redemption. Remember that thou art playing
  with death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my arena,&rdquo; answered Petronius, carelessly; &ldquo;and
  the feeling that I am the best gladiator in it amuses me. See how it ended.
  My influence has increased this evening. He will send me his verses in a
  cylinder which&mdash;dost wish to lay a wager?&mdash;will be immensely rich
  and in immensely bad taste. I shall command my physician to keep physic in
  it. I did this for another reason,&mdash;because Tigellinus, seeing how such
  things succeed, will wish surely to imitate me, and I imagine what will
  happen. The moment he starts a witticism, it will be as if a bear of the
  Pyrenees were rope-walking. I shall laugh like Democritus. If I wished I
  could destroy Tigellinus perhaps, and become pretorian prefect in his place,
  and have Ahenobarbus himself in my hands. But I am indolent; I prefer my
  present life and even Cæsar&rsquo;s verses to trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dexterity to be able to turn even blame into flattery! But are
  those verses really so bad? I am no judge in those matters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The verses are not worse than others. Lucan has more talent in one
  finger, but in Bronzebeard too there is something. He has, above all, an
  immense love for poetry and music. In two days we are to be with him to hear
  the music of his hymn to Aphrodite, which he will finish to-day or to-morrow.
  We shall be in a small circle,&mdash;only I, thou, Tullius Senecio, and young
  Nerva. But as to what I said touching Nero&rsquo;s verses, that I use them
  after feasting as Vitelius does flamingo feathers, is not true. At times they
  are eloquent. Hecuba&rsquo;s words are touching. She complains of the pangs
  of birth, and Nero was able to find happy expressions,&mdash;for this reason,
  perhaps, that he gives birth to every verse in torment. At times I am sorry
  for him. By Pollux, what a marvellous mixture! The fifth stave was lacking in
  Caligula, but still he never did such strange things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who can foresee to what the madness of Ahenobarbus will go?&rdquo;
  asked Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No man whatever. Such things may happen yet that the hair will
  stand on men&rsquo;s heads for whole centuries at thought of them. But it is
  that precisely which interests me; and though I am bored more than once, like
  Jupiter Ammon in the desert, I believe that under another Cæsar I should be
  bored a hundred times more. Paul, thy little Jew, is eloquent,&mdash;that I
  accord to him; and if people like him proclaim that religion, our gods must
  defend themselves seriously, lest in time they be led away captive. It is
  true that if Cæsar, for example, were a Christian, all would feel safer. But
  thy prophet of Tarsus, in applying proofs to me, did not think, seest thou,
  that for me this uncertainty becomes the charm of life. Whoso does not play
  at dice will not lose property, but still people play at dice. There is in
  that a certain delight and destruction of the present. I have known sons of
  knights and senators to become gladiators of their own will. I play with
  life, thou sayest, and that is true, but I play because it pleases me; while
  Christian virtues would bore me in a day, as do the discourses of Seneca.
  Because of this, Paul&rsquo;s eloquence is exerted in vain. He should
  understand that people like me will never accept his religion. With thy
  disposition thou mightst either hate the name Christian, or become a
  Christian immediately. I recognize, while yawning, the truth of what they
  say. We are mad. We are hastening to the precipice, something unknown is
  coming toward us out of the future, something is breaking beneath us,
  something is dying around us,&mdash;agreed! But we shall succeed in dying;
  meanwhile we have no wish to burden life, and serve death before it takes us.
  Life exists for itself alone, not for death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I pity thee, Petronius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not pity me more than I pity myself. Formerly thou wert glad
  among us; while campaigning in Armenia, thou wert longing for
  Rome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now I am longing for Rome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True; for thou art in love with a Christian vestal, who sits in the
  Trans-Tiber. I neither wonder at this, nor do I blame thee. I wonder more,
  that in spite of a religion described by thee as a sea of happiness, and in
  spite of a love which is soon to be crowned, sadness has not left thy face.
  Pomponia Græcina is eternally pensive; from the time of thy becoming a
  Christian thou hast ceased to laugh. Do not try to persuade me that this
  religion is cheerful. Thou hast returned from Rome sadder than ever. If
  Christians love in this way, by the bright curls of Bacchus! I shall not
  imitate them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is another thing,&rdquo; answered Vinicius. &ldquo;I swear to
  thee, not by the curls of Bachus, but by the soul of my father, that never in
  times past have I experienced even a foretaste of such happiness as I breathe
  to-day. But I yearn greatly; and what is stranger, when I am far from Lygia,
  I think that danger is threatening her. I know not what danger, nor whence it
  may come; but I feel it, as one feels a coming tempest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In two days I will try to obtain for thee permission to leave
  Antium, for as long a time as may please thee. Poppæa is somewhat more quiet;
  and, as far as I know, no danger from her threatens thee or Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This very day she asked me what I was doing in Rome, though my
  departure was secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she gave command to set spies on thee. Now, however, even
  she must count with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paul told me,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;that God forewarns
  sometimes, but does not permit us to believe in omens; hence I guard myself
  against this belief, but I cannot ward it off. I will tell thee what
  happened, so as to cast the weight from my heart. Lygia and I were sitting
  side by side on a night as calm as this, and planning our future. I cannot
  tell thee how happy and calm we were. All at once lions began to roar. That
  is common in Rome, but since then I have no rest. It seems to me that in that
  roaring there was a threat, an announcement as it were of misfortune. Thou
  knowest that I am not frightened easily; that night, however, something
  happened which filled all the darkness with terror. It came so strangely and
  unexpectedly that I have those sounds in my ears yet, and unbroken fear in my
  heart, as if Lygia were asking my protection from something
  dreadful,&mdash;even from those same lions. I am in torture. Obtain for me
  permission to leave Antium, or I shall go without it. I cannot remain. I
  repeat to thee, I cannot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sons of consuls or their wives are not given to lions yet in the
  arenas,&rdquo; said Petronius, laughing. &ldquo;Any other death may meet thee
  but that. Who knows, besides, that they were lions? German bisons roar with
  no less gentleness than lions. As to me, I ridicule omens and fates. Last
  night was warm and I saw stars falling like rain. Many a man has an evil
  foreboding at such a sight; but I thought, &rsquo;If among these is my star
  too, I shall not lack society at least!&rsquo;&rdquo; Then he was silent, but
  added after a moment&rsquo;s thought,&mdash;&ldquo;If your Christ has risen
  from the dead, He may perhaps protect you both from death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He may,&rdquo; answered Vinicius, looking at the heavens filled
  with stars.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41">CHAPTER XLI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nero played and sang, in honor of the &ldquo;Lady of
  Cyprus,&rdquo; a hymn the verses and music of which were composed by himself.
  That day he was in voice, and felt that his music really captivated those
  present. That feeling added such power to the sounds produced and roused his
  own soul so much that he seemed inspired. At last he grew pale from genuine
  emotion. This was surely the first time that he had no desire to hear praises
  from others. He sat for a time with his hands on the cithara and with bowed
  head; then, rising suddenly, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am tired and need air, Meanwhile ye will tune the
  citharæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He covered his throat then with a silk kerchief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye will go with me,&rdquo; said he, turning to Petronius and
  Vinicius, who were sitting in a corner of the hall. &ldquo;Give me thy arm,
  Vinicius, for strength fails me; Petronius will talk to me of
  music.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went out on the terrace, which was paved with alabaster and sprinkled
  with saffron.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here one can breathe more freely,&rdquo; said Nero. &ldquo;My soul
  is moved and sad, though I see that with what I have sung to thee on trial
  just now I may appear in public, and my triumph will be such as no Roman has
  ever achieved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou mayst appear here, in Rome, in Achæa. I admire thee with my
  whole heart and mind, divinity,&rdquo; answered Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. Thou art too slothful to force thyself to flattery, and
  thou art as sincere as Tullius Senecio, but thou hast more knowledge than he.
  Tell me, what is thy judgment on music?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I listen to poetry, when I look at a quadriga directed by thee
  in the Circus, when I look at a beautiful statue, temple, or picture, I feel
  that I comprehend perfectly what I see, that my enthusiasm takes in all that
  these can give. But when I listen to music, especially thy music, new
  delights and beauties open before me every instant. I pursue them, I try to
  seize them; but before I can take them to myself, new and newer ones flow in,
  just like waves of the sea, which roll on from infinity. Hence I tell thee
  that music is like the sea. We stand on one shore and gaze at remoteness, but
  we cannot see the other shore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, what deep knowledge thou hast!&rdquo; said Nero; and they
  walked on for a moment, only the slight sound of the saffron leaves under
  their feet being heard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast expressed my idea,&rdquo; said Nero at last; &ldquo;hence
  I say now, as ever, in all Rome thou art the only man able to understand me.
  Thus it is, my judgment of music is the same as thine. When I play and sing,
  I see things which I did not know as existing in my dominions or in the
  world. I am Cæsar, and the world is mine. I can do everything. But music
  opens new kingdoms to me, new mountains, new seas, new delights unknown
  before. Most frequently I cannot name them or grasp them; I only feel them. I
  feel the gods, I see Olympus. Some kind of breeze from beyond the earth blows
  in on me; I behold, as in a mist, certain immeasurable greatnesses, but calm
  and bright as sunshine. The whole Spheros plays around me; and I declare to
  thee&rdquo; (here Nero&rsquo;s voice quivered with genuine wonder)
  &ldquo;that I, Cæsar and god, feel at such times as diminutive as dust. Wilt
  thou believe this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will. Only great artists have power to feel small in the presence
  of art.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a night of sincerity; hence I open my soul to thee as to a
  friend, and I will say more: dost thou consider that I am blind or deprived
  of reason? Dost thou think that I am ignorant of this, that people in Rome
  write insults on the walls against me, call me a matricide, a wife-murderer,
  hold me a monster and a tyrant, because Tigellinus obtained a few sentences
  of death against my enemies? Yes, my dear, they hold me a monster, and I know
  it. They have talked cruelty on me to that degree that at times I put the
  question to myself, &rsquo;Am I not cruel?&rsquo; But they do not understand
  this, that a man&rsquo;s deeds may be cruel at times while he himself is not
  cruel. Ah, no one will believe, and perhaps even thou, my dear, wilt not
  believe, that at moments when music caresses my soul I feel as kind as a
  child in the cradle. I swear by those stars which shine above us, that I
  speak the pure truth to thee. People do not know how much goodness lies in
  this heart, and what treasures I see in it when music opens the door to
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius, who had not the least doubt that Nero was speaking sincerely at
  that moment, and that music might bring out various more noble inclinations
  of his soul, which were overwhelmed by mountains of egotism, profligacy, and
  crime, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Men should know thee as nearly as I do; Rome has
  never been able to appreciate thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar leaned more heavily on Vinicius&rsquo;s arm, as if he were bending
  under the weight of injustice, and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tigellinus has told me that in the Senate they whisper into one
  another&rsquo;s ears that Diodorus and Terpnos play on the cithara better
  than I. They refuse me even that! But tell me, thou who art truthful always,
  do they play better, or as well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By no means. Thy touch is finer, and has greater power. In thee the
  artist is evident, in them the expert. The man who hears their music first
  understands better what thou art.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If that be true, let them live. They will never imagine what a
  service thou hast rendered them in this moment. For that matter, if I had
  condemned those two, I should have had to take others in place of
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And people would say, besides, that out of love for music thou
  destroyest music in thy dominions. Never kill art for art&rsquo;s sake, O
  divinity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How different thou art from Tigellinus!&rdquo; answered Nero.
  &ldquo;But seest thou, I am an artist in everything; and since music opens
  for me spaces the existence of which I had not divined, regions which I do
  not possess, delight and happiness which I do not know, I cannot live a
  common life. Music tells me that the uncommon exists, so I seek it with all
  the power of dominion which the gods have placed in my hands. At times it
  seems to me that to reach those Olympian worlds I must do something which no
  man has done hitherto,&mdash;I must surpass the stature of man in good or
  evil. I know that people declare me mad. But I am not mad, I am only seeking.
  And if I am going mad, it is out of disgust and impatience that I cannot
  find. I am seeking! Dost understand me? And therefore I wish to be greater
  than man, for only in that way can I be the greatest as an artist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he lowered his voice so that Vinicius could not hear him, and,
  putting his mouth to the ear of Petronius, he whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;Dost
  know that I condemned my mother and wife to death mainly because I wished to
  lay at the gate of an unknown world the greatest sacrifice that man could put
  there? I thought that afterward something would happen, that doors would be
  opened beyond which I should see something unknown. Let it be wonderful or
  awful, surpassing human conception, if only great and uncommon. But that
  sacrifice was not sufficient. To open the empyrean doors it is evident that
  something greater is needed, and let it be given as the Fates
  desire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou intend to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou shalt see sooner than thou thinkest. Meanwhile be assured that
  there are two Neros,&mdash;one such as people know, the other an artist, whom
  thou alone knowest, and if he slays as does death, or is in frenzy like
  Bacchus, it is only because the flatness and misery of common life stifle
  him; and I should like to destroy them, though I had to use fire or iron. Oh,
  how flat this world will be when I am gone from it! No man has suspected yet,
  not thou even, what an artist I am. But precisely because of this I suffer,
  and sincerely do I tell thee that the soul in me is as gloomy as those
  cypresses which stand dark there in front of us. It is grievous for a man to
  bear at once the weight of supreme power and the highest talents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sympathize with thee, O Cæsar; and with me earth and sea, not
  counting Vinicius, who deifies thee in his soul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He, too, has always been dear to me,&rdquo; said Cæsar,
  &ldquo;though he serves Mars, not the Muses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He serves Aphrodite first of all,&rdquo; answered Petronius. And
  suddenly he determined to settle the affair of his nephew at a blow, and at
  the same time to eliminate every danger which might threaten him. &ldquo;He
  is in love, as was Troilus with Cressida. Permit him, lord, to visit Rome,
  for he is dying on my hands. Dost thou know that that Lygian hostage whom
  thou gavest him has been found, and Vinicius, when leaving for Antium, left
  her in care of a certain Linus? I did not mention this to thee, for thou wert
  composing thy hymn, and that was more important than all besides. Vinicius
  wanted her as a mistress; but when she turned out to be as virtuous as
  Lucretia, he fell in love with her virtue, and now his desire is to marry
  her. She is a king&rsquo;s daughter, hence she will cause him no detriment;
  but he is a real soldier: he sighs and withers and groans, but he is waiting
  for the permission of his Imperator.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Imperator does not choose wives for his soldiers. What good is
  my permission to Vinicius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have told thee, O lord, that he deifies thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the more may he be certain of permission. That is a comely
  maiden, but too narrow in the hips. The Augusta Poppæa has complained to me
  that she enchanted our child in the gardens of the Palatine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I told Tigellinus that the gods are not subject to evil charms.
  Thou rememberest, divinity, his confusion and thy exclamation,
  &lsquo;Habet!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he turned to Vinicius,&mdash;&ldquo;Dost thou love her, as Petronius
  says?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love her, lord,&rdquo; replied Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I command thee to set out for Rome to-morrow, and marry her.
  Appear not again before my eyes without the marriage ring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee, lord, from my heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, how pleasant it is to make people happy!&rdquo; said Nero.
  &ldquo;Would that I might do nothing else all my life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grant us one favor more, O divinity,&rdquo; said Petronius:
  &ldquo;declare thy will in this matter before the Augusta. Vinicius would
  never venture to wed a woman displeasing to the Augusta; thou wilt dissipate
  her prejudice, O lord, with a word, by declaring that thou hast commanded
  this marriage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I could refuse nothing to
  thee or Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned toward the villa, and they followed. Their hearts were filled
  with delight over the victory; and Vinicius had to use self-restraint to
  avoid throwing himself on the neck of Petronius, for it seemed now that all
  dangers and obstacles were removed.</p>

  <p>In the atrium of the villa young Nerva and Tullius Senecio were
  entertaining the Augusta with conversation. Terpnos and Diodorus were tuning
  citharæ.</p>

  <p>Nero entered, sat in an armchair inlaid with tortoise-shell, whispered
  something in the ear of a Greek slave near his side, and waited.</p>

  <p>The page returned soon with a golden casket. Nero opened it and took out a
  necklace of great opals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These are jewels worthy of this evening,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The light of Aurora is playing in them,&rdquo; answered Poppæa,
  convinced that the necklace was for her.</p>

  <p>Cæsar, now raising, now lowering the rosy stones, said at
  last,&mdash;&ldquo;Vinicius, thou wilt give, from me, this necklace to her
  whom I command thee to marry, the youthful daughter of the Lygian
  king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Poppæa&rsquo;s glance, filled with anger and sudden amazement, passed from
  Cæsar to Vinicius. At last it rested on Petronius. But he, leaning carelessly
  over the arm of the chair, passed his hand along the back of the harp as if
  to fix its form firmly in his mind.</p>

  <p>Vinicius gave thanks for the gift, approached Petronius, and
  asked,&mdash;&ldquo;How shall I thank thee for what thou hast done this day
  for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sacrifice a pair of swans to Euterpe,&rdquo; replied Petronius,
  &ldquo;praise Cæsar&rsquo;s songs, and laugh at omens. Henceforth the roaring
  of lions will not disturb thy sleep, I trust, nor that of thy Lygian
  lily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Vinicius; &ldquo;now I am perfectly at
  rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Fortune favor thee! But be careful, for Cæsar is taking his
  lute again. Hold thy breath, listen, and shed tears.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact Cæsar had taken the lute and raised his eyes. In the hall
  conversation had stopped, and people were as still as if petrified. Terpnos
  and Diodorus, who had to accompany Cæsar, were on the alert, looking now at
  each other and now at his lips, waiting for the first tones of the song.</p>

  <p>Just then a movement and noise began in the entrance; and after a moment
  Cæsar&rsquo;s freedman, Phaon, appeared from beyond the curtain. Close behind
  him was the consul Lecanius.</p>

  <p>Nero frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon, divine Imperator,&rdquo; said Phaon, with panting voice,
  &ldquo;there is a conflagration in Rome! The greater part of the city is in
  flames!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this news all sprang from their seats.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O gods! I shall see a burning city and finish the Troyad,&rdquo;
  said Nero, setting aside his lute.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the consul,&mdash;&ldquo;If I go at once, shall I see
  the fire?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; answered Lecanius, as pale as a wall, &ldquo;the whole
  city is one sea of flame; smoke is suffocating the inhabitants, and people
  faint, or cast themselves into the fire from delirium. Rome is perishing,
  lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed, which was broken by the cry of
  Vinicius,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Væ misero mihi!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the young man, casting his toga aside, rushed forth in his tunic. Nero
  raised his hands and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe to thee, sacred city of Priam!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42">CHAPTER XLII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Vinicius had barely time to command a few slaves to follow
  him; then, springing on his horse, he rushed forth in the deep night along
  the empty streets toward Laurentum. Through the influence of the dreadful
  news he had fallen as it were into frenzy and mental distraction. At moments
  he did not know clearly what was happening in his mind; he had merely the
  feeling that misfortune was on the horse with him, sitting behind his
  shoulders, and shouting in his ears, &ldquo;Rome is burning!&rdquo; that it
  was lashing his horse and him, urging them toward the fire. Laying his bare
  head on the beast&rsquo;s neck, he rushed on, in his single tunic, alone, at
  random, not looking ahead, and taking no note of obstacles against which he
  might perchance dash himself.</p>

  <p>In silence and in that calm night, the rider and the horse, covered with
  gleams of the moon, seemed like dream visions. The Idumean stallion, dropping
  his ears and stretching his neck, shot on like an arrow past the motionless
  cypresses and the white villas hidden among them. The sound of hoofs on the
  stone flags roused dogs here and there; these followed the strange vision
  with their barking; afterward, excited by its suddenness, they fell to
  howling, and raised their jaws toward the moon. The slaves hastening after
  Vinicius soon dropped behind, as their horses were greatly inferior. When he
  had rushed like a storm through sleeping Laurentum, he turned toward Ardea,
  in which, as in Aricia, Bovillæ, and Ustrinum, he had kept relays of horses
  from the day of his coming to Antium, so as to pass in the shortest time
  possible the interval between Rome and him. Remembering these relays, he
  forced all the strength from his horse.</p>

  <p>Beyond Ardea it seemed to him that the sky on the northeast was covered
  with a rosy reflection. That might be the dawn, for the hour was late, and in
  July daybreak came early. But Vinicius could not keep down a cry of rage and
  despair, for it seemed to him that that was the glare of the conflagration.
  He remembered the consul&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;The whole city is one sea of
  flame,&rdquo; and for a while he felt that madness was threatening him
  really, for he had lost utterly all hope that he could save Lygia, or even
  reach the city before it was turned into one heap of ashes. His thoughts were
  quicker now than the rush of the stallion, they flew on ahead like a flock of
  birds, black, monstrous, and rousing despair. He knew not, it is true, in
  what part of the city the fire had begun; but he supposed that the
  Trans-Tiber division, as it was packed with tenements, timber-yards,
  storehouses, and wooden sheds serving as slave marts, might have become the
  first food of the flames.</p>

  <p>In Rome fires happened frequently enough; during these fires, as
  frequently, deeds of violence and robbery were committed, especially in the
  parts occupied by a needy and half-barbarous population. What might happen,
  therefore, in a place like the Trans-Tiber, which was the retreat of a rabble
  collected from all parts of the earth? Here the thought of Ursus with his
  preterhuman power flashed into Vinicius&rsquo;s head; but what could be done
  by a man, even were he a Titan, against the destructive force of fire?</p>

  <p>The fear of servile rebellion was like a nightmare, which had stifled Rome
  for whole years. It was said that hundreds of thousands of those people were
  thinking of the times of Spartacus, and merely waiting for a favorable moment
  to seize arms against their oppressors and Rome. Now the moment had come!
  Perhaps war and slaughter were raging in the city together with fire. It was
  possible even that the pretorians had hurled themselves on the city, and were
  slaughtering at command of Cæsar.</p>

  <p>And that moment the hair rose from terror on his head. He recalled all the
  conversations about burning cities, which for some time had been repeated at
  Cæsar&rsquo;s court with wonderful persistence; he recalled Cæsar&rsquo;s
  complaints that he was forced to describe a burning city without having seen
  a real fire; his contemptuous answer to Tigellinus, who offered to burn
  Antium or an artificial wooden city; finally, his complaints against Rome,
  and the pestilential alleys of the Subura. Yes; Cæsar has commanded the
  burning of the city! He alone could give such a command, as Tigellinus alone
  could accomplish it. But if Rome is burning at command of Cæsar, who can be
  sure that the population will not be slaughtered at his command also? The
  monster is capable even of such a deed. Conflagration, a servile revolt, and
  slaughter! What a horrible chaos, what a letting loose of destructive
  elements and popular frenzy! And in all this is Lygia.</p>

  <p>The groans of Vinicius were mingled with the snorting and groans of his
  horse; the beast, running on a road which rose continually toward Aricia, was
  using the last of its breath. Who will snatch her from the burning city; who
  can save her? Here Vinicius, stretching himself entirely on the horse, thrust
  his fingers into his own hair, ready to gnaw the beast&rsquo;s neck from
  pain.</p>

  <p>At that moment a horseman, rushing also like a whirlwind, but in the
  opposite direction, toward Antium, shouted as he raced past, &ldquo;Rome is
  perishing!&rdquo; and on he went. To the ears of Vinicius came only one more
  expression: &ldquo;Gods!&rdquo; the rest was drowned by the thunder of hoofs.
  But that expression sobered him,&mdash;&ldquo;Gods!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius raised his head suddenly, and, stretching his arms toward the sky
  filled with stars, began to pray.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not to you do I call whose temples are burning, but to Thee! Thou
  Thyself hast suffered. Thou alone art merciful! Thou alone hast understood
  people&rsquo;s pain; Thou didst come to this world to teach pity to mankind;
  then show it now. If Thou art what Peter and Paul declare, save for me Lygia,
  take her in Thy arms, bear her out of the flames. Thou hast the power to do
  that! Give her to me, and I will give Thee my blood. But if Thou art
  unwilling to do this for me, do it for her. She loves Thee and trusts in
  Thee. Thou dost promise life and happiness after death, but happiness after
  death will not pass away, and she does not wish to die yet. Let her live.
  Take her in Thy arms, bear her out of Rome. Thou canst do so, unless Thou art
  unwilling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he stopped, for he felt that further prayer might turn to a threat; he
  feared to offend Divinity at the moment when he needed favor and mercy most.
  He was terrified at the very thought of that, and, so as not to admit to his
  head a shade even of threat, he began to lash his horse again, especially
  since the white walls of Aricia, which lay midway to Rome, gleamed up before
  him in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>After a time he rushed at full speed past the temple of Mercury, which
  stood in a grove before the city. Evidently people knew of the catastrophe,
  for there was an uncommon movement in front of the temple. While passing,
  Vinicius saw crowds on the steps and between the columns. These people
  holding torches were hastening to put themselves under protection of the
  deity. Moreover the road was not so empty or free as beyond Ardea. Crowds
  were hurrying, it is true, to the grove by side-paths, but on the main road
  were groups which pushed aside hurriedly before the on-rushing horseman. From
  the town came the sound of voices. Vinicius rode into Aricia like a
  whirlwind, overturning and trampling a number of persons on the way. He was
  surrounded by shouts of &ldquo;Rome is burning!&rdquo; &ldquo;Rome is on
  fire!&rdquo; &ldquo;May the gods rescue Rome!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The horse stumbled, but, reined in by a powerful hand, rose on his
  haunches before the inn, where Vinicius had another beast in relay. Slaves,
  as if waiting for the arrival of their master, stood before the inn, and at
  his command ran one before the other to lead out a fresh horse. Vinicius,
  seeing a detachment of ten mounted pretorians, going evidently with news from
  the city to Antium, sprang toward them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What part of the city is on fire?&rdquo; inquired he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked the decurion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius, a tribune of the army, an Augustian. Answer on thy
  head!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fire broke out in the shops near the Circus Maximus. When we
  were despatched, the centre of the city was on fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the Trans-Tiber?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fire has not reached the Trans-Tiber yet, but it is seizing new
  parts every moment with a force which nothing can stop. People are perishing
  from heat and smoke; all rescue is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this moment they brought the fresh horse. The young tribune sprang to
  his back and rushed on. He was riding now toward Albanum, leaving Alba Longa
  and its splendid lake on the right. The road from Aricia lay at the foot of
  the mountain, which hid the horizon completely, and Albanum lying on the
  other side of it. But Vinicius knew that on reaching the top he should see,
  not only Bovillæ and Ustrinum, where fresh horses were ready for him, but
  Rome as well: for beyond Albanum the low level Campania stretched on both
  sides of the Appian Way, along which only the arches of the aqueducts ran
  toward the city, and nothing obstructed the view.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From the top I shall see the flames,&rdquo; said he; and he began
  to lash his horse anew. But before he had reached the top of the mountain he
  felt the wind on his face, and with it came the odor of smoke to his
  nostrils. At the same time the summit of the height was becoming gilded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fire!&rdquo; thought Vinicius.</p>

  <p>The night had paled long since, the dawn had passed into light, and on all
  the nearer summits golden and rosy gleams were shining, which might come
  either from burning Rome or the rising daylight. Vinicius touched the summit
  at last, and then a terrible sight struck his eyes.</p>

  <p>The whole lower region was covered with smoke, forming as it were one
  gigantic cloud lying close to the earth. In this cloud towns, aqueducts,
  villas, trees, disappeared; but beyond this gray ghastly plain the city was
  burning on the hills.</p>

  <p>The conflagration had not the form of a pillar of fire, as happens when a
  single building is burning, even when of the greatest size. That was a long
  belt, rather, shaped like the belt of dawn. Above this belt rose a wave of
  smoke, in places entirely black, in places looking rose-colored, in places
  like blood, in places turning in on itself, in some places inflated, in
  others squeezed and squirming, like a serpent which is unwinding and
  extending. That monstrous wave seemed at times to cover even the belt of
  fire, which became then as narrow as a ribbon; but later this ribbon
  illuminated the smoke from beneath, changing its lower rolls into waves of
  flame. The two extended from one side of the sky to the other, hiding its
  lower part, as at times a stretch of forest hides the horizon. The Sabine
  hills were not visible in the least.</p>

  <p>To Vinicius it seemed at the first glance of the eye that not only the
  city was burning, but the whole world, and that no living being could save
  itself from that ocean of flame and smoke.</p>

  <p>The wind blew with growing strength from the region of the fire, bringing
  the smell of burnt things and of smoke, which began to hide even nearer
  objects. Clear daylight had come, and the sun lighted up the summits
  surrounding the Alban Lake. But the bright golden rays of the morning
  appeared as it were reddish and sickly through the haze. Vinicius, while
  descending toward Albanum, entered smoke which was denser, less and less
  transparent. The town itself was buried in it thoroughly. The alarmed
  citizens had moved out to the street. It was a terror to think of what might
  be in Rome, when it was difficult to breathe in Albanum.</p>

  <p>Despair seized Vinicius anew, and terror began to raise the hair on his
  head. But he tried to fortify himself as best he might. &ldquo;It is
  impossible,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that a city should begin to burn in all
  places at once. The wind is blowing from the north and bears smoke in this
  direction only. On the other side there is none. But in every case it will be
  enough for Ursus to go through the Janiculum gate with Lygia, to save himself
  and her. It is equally impossible that a whole population should perish, and
  the world-ruling city be swept from the face of the earth with its
  inhabitants. Even in captured places, where fire and slaughter rage together,
  some people survive in all cases; why, then, should Lygia perish of a
  certainty? On the contrary, God watches over her, He who Himself, conquered
  death.&rdquo; Thus reasoning, he began to pray again, and, yielding to fixed
  habit, he made great vows to Christ, with promises of gifts and sacrifices.
  After he had hurried through Albanum, nearly all of whose inhabitants were on
  roofs and on trees to look at Rome, he grew somewhat calm, and regained his
  cool blood. He remembered, too, that Lygia was protected not only by Ursus
  and Linus, but by the Apostle Peter. At the mere remembrance of this, fresh
  solace entered his heart. For him Peter was an incomprehensible, an almost
  superhuman being. From the time when he heard him at Ostrianum, a wonderful
  impression clung to him, touching which he had written to Lygia at the
  beginning of his stay in Antium,&mdash;that every word of the old man was
  true, or would show its truth hereafter. The nearer acquaintance which during
  his illness he had formed with the Apostle heightened the impression, which
  was turned afterward into fixed faith. Since Peter had blessed his love and
  promised him Lygia, Lygia could not perish in the flames. The city might
  burn, but no spark from the fire would fall on her garments. Under the
  influence of a sleepless night, mad riding, and impressions, a wonderful
  exaltation possessed the young tribune; in this exaltation all things seemed
  possible: Peter speaks to the flame, opens it with a word, and they pass
  uninjured through an alley of fire. Moreover, Peter saw future events; hence,
  beyond doubt, he foresaw the fire, and in that ease how could he fail to warn
  and lead forth the Christians from the city, and among others Lygia, whom he
  loved, as he might his own child? And a hope, which was strengthening every
  moment, entered the heart of Vinicius. If they were fleeing from the city, he
  might find them in Bovillæ, or meet them on the road. The beloved face might
  appear any moment from out the smoke, which was stretching more widely over
  all the Campania.</p>

  <p>This seemed to him more likely, since he met increasing numbers of people,
  who had deserted the city and were going to the Alban Hills; they had escaped
  the fire, and wished to go beyond the line of smoke. Before he had reached
  Ustrinum he had to slacken his pace because of the throng. Besides
  pedestrians with bundles on their backs, he met horses with packs, mules and
  vehicles laden with effects, and finally litters in which slaves were bearing
  the wealthier citizens. Ustrinum was so thronged with fugitives from Rome
  that it was difficult to push through the crowd. On the market square, under
  temple porticos, and on the streets were swarms of fugitives. Here and there
  people were erecting tents under which whole families were to find shelter.
  Others settled down under the naked sky, shouting, calling on the gods, or
  cursing the fates. In the general terror it was difficult to inquire about
  anything. People to whom Vinicius applied either did not answer, or with eyes
  half bewildered from terror answered that the city and the world were
  perishing. New crowds of men, women, and children arrived from the direction
  of Rome every moment; these increased the disorder and outcry. Some, gone
  astray in the throng, sought desperately those whom they had lost; others
  fought for a camping-place. Half-wild shepherds from the Campania crowded to
  the town to hear news, or find profit in plunder made easy by the uproar.
  Here and there crowds of slaves of every nationality and gladiators fell to
  robbing houses and villas in the town, and to fighting with the soldiers who
  appeared in defence of the citizens.</p>

  <p>Junius, a senator, whom Vinicius saw at the inn surrounded by a detachment
  of Batavian slaves, was the first to give more detailed news of the
  conflagration. The fire had begun at the Circus Maximus, in the part which
  touches the Palatine and the Cælian Hill, but extended with incomprehensible
  rapidity and seized the whole centre of the city. Never since the time of
  Brennus had such an awful catastrophe come upon Rome. &ldquo;The entire
  Circus has burnt, as well as the shops and houses surrounding it,&rdquo; said
  Junius; &ldquo;the Aventine and Cælian Hills are on fire. The flames
  surrounding the Palatine have reached the Carinæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here Junius, who possessed on the Carinæ a magnificent
  &ldquo;insula,&rdquo; filled with works of art which he loved, seized a
  handful of foul dust, and, scattering it on his head, began to groan
  despairingly.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius shook him by the shoulder: &ldquo;My house too is on the
  Carinæ,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but when everything is perishing, let it
  perish also.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then recollecting that at his advice Lygia might have gone to the house of
  Aulus, he inquired,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the Vicus Patricius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On fire!&rdquo; replied Junius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Trans-Tiber?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Junius looked at him with amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind the Trans-Tiber,&rdquo; said he, pressing his aching
  temples with his palms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Trans-Tiber is more important to me than all other parts of
  Rome,&rdquo; cried Vinicius, with vehemence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The way is through the Via Portuensis, near the Aventine; but the
  heat will stifle thee. The Trans-Tiber? I know not. The fire had not reached
  it; but whether it is not there at this moment the gods alone know.&rdquo;
  Here Junius hesitated a moment, then said in a low voice: &ldquo;I know that
  thou wilt not betray me, so I will tell thee that this is no common fire.
  People were not permitted to save the Circus. When houses began to burn in
  every direction, I myself heard thousands of voices exclaiming, &lsquo;Death
  to those who save!&rsquo; Certain people ran through the city and hurled
  burning torches into buildings. On the other hand people are revolting, and
  crying that the city is burning at command. I can say nothing more. Woe to
  the city, woe to us all, and to me! The tongue of man cannot tell what is
  happening there. People are perishing in flames or slaying one another in the
  throng. This is the end of Rome!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And again he fell to repeating, &ldquo;Woe! Woe to the city and to
  us!&rdquo; Vinicius sprang to his horse, and hurried forward along the Appian
  Way. But now it was rather a struggling through the midst of a river of
  people and vehicles, which was flowing from the city. The city, embraced by a
  monstrous conflagration, lay before Vinicius as a thing on the palm of his
  hand. From the sea of fire and smoke came a terrible heat, and the uproar of
  people could not drown the roar and the hissing of flames.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As Vinicius approached the walls, he found it easier to
  reach Rome than penetrate to the middle of the city. It was difficult to push
  along the Appian Way, because of the throng of people. Houses, fields,
  cemeteries, gardens, and temples, lying on both sides of it, were turned into
  camping places. In the temple of Mars, which stood near the Porta Appia, the
  crowd had thrown down the doors, so as to find a refuge within during
  night-hours. In the cemeteries the larger monuments were seized, and battles
  fought in defence of them, which were carried to bloodshed. Ustrinum with its
  disorder gave barely a slight foretaste of that which was happening beneath
  the walls of the capital. All regard for the dignity of law, for family ties,
  for difference of position, had ceased. Gladiators drunk with wine seized in
  the Emporium gathered in crowds, ran with wild shouts through the neighboring
  squares, scattering, trampling, and robbing the people. A multitude of
  barbarians, exposed for sale in the city, escaped from the booths. For them
  the burning and ruin of Rome was at once the end of slavery and the hour of
  revenge; so that when the permanent inhabitants, who had lost all they owned
  in the fire, stretched their hands to the gods in despair, calling for
  rescue, these slaves with howls of delight scattered the crowds, dragged
  clothing from people&rsquo;s backs, and bore away the younger women. They
  were joined by slaves serving in the city from of old, wretches who had
  nothing on their bodies save woollen girdles around their hips, dreadful
  figures from the alleys, who were hardly ever seen on the streets in the
  daytime, and whose existence in Rome it was difficult to suspect. Men of this
  wild and unrestrained crowd, Asiatics, Africans, Greeks, Thracians, Germans,
  Britons, howling in every language of the earth, raged, thinking that the
  hour had come in which they were free to reward themselves for years of
  misery and suffering. In the midst of that surging throng of humanity, in the
  glitter of day and of fire, shone the helmets of pretorians, under whose
  protection the more peaceable population had taken refuge, and who in
  hand-to-hand battle had to meet the raging multitude in many places. Vinicius
  had seen captured cities, but never had his eyes beheld a spectacle in which
  despair, tears, pain, groans, wild delight, madness, rage, and license were
  mingled together in such immeasurable chaos. Above this heaving, mad human
  multitude roared the fire, surging up to the hill-tops of the greatest city
  on earth, sending into the whirling throng its fiery breath, and covering it
  with smoke, through which it was impossible to see the blue sky. The young
  tribune with supreme effort, and exposing his life every moment, forced his
  way at last to the Appian Gate; but there he saw that he could not reach the
  city through the division of the Porta Capena, not merely because of the
  throng, but also because of the terrible heat from which the whole atmosphere
  was quivering inside the gate. Besides, the bridge at the Porta Trigenia,
  opposite the temple of the Bona Dea, did not exist yet, hence whoso wished to
  go beyond the Tiber had to push through to the Pons Sublicius, that is, to
  pass around the Aventine through a part of the city covered now with one sea
  of flame. That was an impossibility. Vinicius understood that he must return
  toward Ustrinum, turn from the Appian Way, cross the river below the city,
  and go to the Via Portuensis, which led straight to the Trans-Tiber. That was
  not easy because of the increasing disorder on the Appian Way. He must open a
  passage for himself there, even with the sword. Vinicius had no weapons; he
  had left Antium just as the news of the fire had reached him in Cæsar&rsquo;s
  villa. At the fountain of Mercury, however, he saw a centurion who was known
  to him. This man, at the head of a few tens of soldiers, was defending the
  precinct of the temple; he commanded him to follow. Recognizing a tribune and
  an Augustian, the centurion did not dare to disobey the order.</p>

  <p>Vinicius took command of the detachment himself, and, forgetting for that
  moment the teaching of Paul touching love for one&rsquo;s neighbor, he
  pressed and cut the throng in front with a haste that was fatal to many who
  could not push aside in season. He and his men were followed by curses and a
  shower of stones; but to these he gave no heed, caring only to reach freer
  spaces at the earliest. Still he advanced with the greatest effort. People
  who had encamped would not move, and heaped loud curses on Cæsar and the
  pretorians. The throng assumed in places a threatening aspect. Vinicius heard
  voices accusing Nero of burning the city. He and Poppæa were threatened with
  death. Shouts of &ldquo;Sanio,&rdquo; &ldquo;Histrio&rdquo; (buffoon, actor),
  &ldquo;Matricide!&rdquo; were heard round about. Some shouted to drag him to
  the Tiber; others that Rome had shown patience enough. It was clear that were
  a leader found, these threats could be changed into open rebellion which
  might break out any moment. Meanwhile the rage and despair of the crowd
  turned against the pretorians, who for another reason could not make their
  way out of the crowd: the road was blocked by piles of goods, borne from the
  fire previously, boxes, barrels of provisions, furniture the most costly,
  vessels, infants&rsquo; cradles, beds, carts, hand-packs. Here and there they
  fought hand to hand; but the pretorians conquered the weaponless multitude
  easily. After they had ridden with difficulty across the Viæ Latina, Numitia,
  Ardea, Lavinia, and Ostia, and passed around villas, gardens, cemeteries, and
  temples, Vinicius reached at last a village called Vicus Alexandri, beyond
  which he crossed the Tiber. There was more open space at this spot, and less
  smoke. From fugitives, of whom there was no lack even there, he learned that
  only certain alleys of the Trans-Tiber were burning, but that surely nothing
  could resist the fury of the conflagration, since people were spreading the
  fire purposely, and permitted no one to quench it, declaring that they acted
  at command. The young tribune had not the least doubt then that Cæsar had
  given command to burn Rome; and the vengeance which people demanded seemed to
  him just and proper. What more could Mithridates or any of Rome&rsquo;s most
  inveterate enemies have done? The measure had been exceeded; his madness had
  grown to be too enormous, and the existence of people too difficult because
  of him. Vinicius believed that Nero&rsquo;s hour had struck, that those ruins
  into which the city was falling should and must overwhelm the monstrous
  buffoon together with all those crimes of his. Should a man be found of
  courage sufficient to stand at the head of the despairing people, that might
  happen in a few hours. Here vengeful and daring thoughts began to fly through
  his head. But if he should do that? The house of Vinicius, which till recent
  times counted a whole series of consuls, was known throughout Rome. The
  crowds needed only a name. Once, when four hundred slaves of the prefect
  Pedanius Secundus were sentenced, Rome reached the verge of rebellion and
  civil war. What would happen to-day in view of a dreadful calamity surpassing
  almost everything which Rome had undergone in the course of eight centuries?
  Whoso calls the Quirites to arms, thought Vinicius, will overthrow Nero
  undoubtedly, and clothe himself in purple. And why should he not do this? He
  was firmer, more active, younger than other Augustians. True, Nero commanded
  thirty legions stationed on the borders of the Empire; but would not those
  legions and their leaders rise up at news of the burning of Rome and its
  temples? And in that case Vinicius might become Cæsar. It was even whispered
  among the Augustians that a soothsayer had predicted the purple to Otho. In
  what way was he inferior to Otho? Perhaps Christ Himself would assist him
  with His divine power; maybe that inspiration was His? &ldquo;Oh, would that
  it were!&rdquo; exclaimed Vinicius, in spirit. He would take vengeance on
  Nero for the danger of Lygia and his own fear; he would begin the reign of
  truth and justice, he would extend Christ&rsquo;s religion from the Euphrates
  to the misty shores of Britain; he would array Lygia in the purple, and make
  her mistress of the world.</p>

  <p>But these thoughts which had burst forth in his head like a bunch of
  sparks from a blazing house, died away like sparks. First of all was the need
  to save Lygia. He looked now on the catastrophe from near by; hence fear
  seized him again, and before that sea of flame and smoke, before the touch of
  dreadful reality, that confidence with which he believed that Peter would
  rescue Lygia died in his heart altogether. Despair seized him a second time
  when he had come out on the Via Portuensis, which led directly to the
  Trans-Tiber. He did not recover till he came to the gate, where people
  repeated what fugitives had said before, that the greater part of that
  division of the city was not seized by the flames yet, but that fire had
  crossed the river in a number of places.</p>

  <p>Still the Trans-Tiber was full of smoke, and crowds of fugitives made it
  more difficult to reach the interior of the place, since people, having more
  time there, had saved greater quantities of goods. The main street itself was
  in many parts filled completely, and around the Naumachia Augusta great heaps
  were piled up. Narrow alleys, in which smoke had collected more densely, were
  simply impassable. The inhabitants were fleeing in thousands. On the way
  Vinicius saw wonderful sights. More than once two rivers of people, flowing
  in opposite directions, met in a narrow passage, stopped each other, men
  fought hand to hand, struck and trampled one another. Families lost one
  another in the uproar; mothers called on their children despairingly. The
  young tribune&rsquo;s hair stood on end at thought of what must happen nearer
  the fire. Amid shouts and howls it was difficult to inquire about anything or
  understand what was said. At times new columns of smoke from beyond the river
  rolled toward them, smoke black and so heavy that it moved near the ground,
  hiding houses, people, and every object, just as night does. But the wind
  caused by the conflagration blew it away again, and then Vinicius pushed
  forward farther toward the alley in which stood the house of Linus. The
  fervor of a July day, increased by the heat of the burning parts of the city,
  became unendurable. Smoke pained the eyes; breath failed in men&rsquo;s
  breasts. Even the inhabitants who, hoping that the fire would not cross the
  river, had remained in their houses so far, began to leave them; and the
  throng increased hourly. The pretorians accompanying Vinicius remained in the
  rear. In the crush some one wounded his horse with a hammer; the beast threw
  up its bloody head, reared, and refused obedience. The crowd recognized in
  Vinicius an Augustian by his rich tunic, and at once cries were raised round
  about: &ldquo;Death to Nero and his incendiaries!&rdquo; This was a moment of
  terrible danger; hundreds of hands were stretched toward Vinicius; but his
  frightened horse bore him away, trampling people as he went, and the next
  moment a new wave of black smoke rolled in and filled the street with
  darkness. Vinicius, seeing that he could not ride past, sprang to the earth
  and rushed forward on foot, slipping along walls, and at times waiting till
  the fleeing multitude passed him. He said to himself in spirit that these
  were vain efforts. Lygia might not be in the city; she might have saved
  herself by flight. It was easier to find a pin on the seashore than her in
  that crowd and chaos. Still he wished to reach the house of Linus, even at
  the cost of his own life. At times he stopped and rubbed his eyes. Tearing
  off the edge of his tunic, he covered his nose and mouth with it and ran on.
  As he approached the river, the heat increased terribly. Vinicius, knowing
  that the fire had begun at the Circus Maximus, thought at first that that
  heat came from its cinders and from the Forum Boarium and the Velabrum,
  which, situated near by, must be also in flames. But the heat was growing
  unendurable. One old man on crutches and fleeing, the last whom Vinicius
  noticed, cried: &ldquo;Go not near the bridge of Cestius! The whole island is
  on fire!&rdquo; It was, indeed, impossible to be deceived any longer. At the
  turn toward the Vicus Judæorum, on which stood the house of Linus, the young
  tribune saw flames amid clouds of smoke. Not only the island was burning, but
  the Trans-Tiber, or at least the other end of the street on which Lygia
  dwelt.</p>

  <p>Vinicius remembered that the house of Linus was surrounded by a garden;
  between the garden and the Tiber was an unoccupied field of no great size.
  This thought consoled him. The fire might stop at the vacant place. In that
  hope he ran forward, though every breeze brought not only smoke, but sparks
  in thousands, which might raise a fire at the other end of the alley and cut
  off his return.</p>

  <p>At last he saw through the smoky curtain the cypresses in Linus&rsquo;s
  garden.</p>

  <p>The houses beyond the unoccupied field were burning already like piles of
  fuel, but Linus&rsquo;s little &ldquo;insula&rdquo; stood untouched yet.
  Vinicius glanced heavenward with thankfulness, and sprang toward the house
  though the very air began to burn him. The door was closed, but he pushed it
  open and rushed in.</p>

  <p>There was not a living soul in the garden, and the house seemed quite
  empty. &ldquo;Perhaps they have fainted from smoke and heat,&rdquo; thought
  Vinicius. He began to call,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia! Lygia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence answered him. Nothing could be heard in the stillness there save
  the roar of the distant fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly his ear was struck by that gloomy sound which he had heard before
  in that garden. Evidently the vivarium near the temple of Esculapius, on the
  neighboring island, had caught fire. In this vivarium every kind of wild
  beast, and among others lions, began to roar from affright. A shiver ran
  through Vinicius from foot to head. Now, a second time, at a moment when his
  whole being was concentrated in Lygia, these terrible voices answered, as a
  herald of misfortune, as a marvellous prophecy of an ominous future.</p>

  <p>But this was a brief impression, for the thunder of the flames, more
  terrible yet than the roaring of wild beasts, commanded him to think of
  something else. Lygia did not answer his calls; but she might be in a faint
  or stifled in that threatened building. Vinicius sprang to the interior. The
  little atrium was empty, and dark with smoke. Feeling for the door which led
  to the sleeping-rooms, he saw the gleaming flame of a small lamp, and
  approaching it saw the lararium in which was a cross instead of lares. Under
  the cross a taper was burning. Through the head of the young catechumen, the
  thought passed with lightning speed that that cross sent him the taper with
  which he could find Lygia; hence he took the taper and searched for the
  sleeping-rooms. He found one, pushed aside the curtains, and, holding the
  taper, looked around.</p>

  <p>There was no one there, either. Vinicius was sure that he had found
  Lygia&rsquo;s sleeping-room, for her clothing was on nails in the wall, and
  on the bed lay a capitium, or close garment worn by women next the body.
  Vinicius seized that, pressed it to his lips, and taking it on his arm went
  farther. The house was small, so that he examined every room, and even the
  cellar quickly. Nowhere could he find a living soul. It was evident that
  Lygia, Linus, and Ursus, with other inhabitants of that part, must have
  sought safety in flight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must seek them among the crowd beyond the gates of the
  city,&rdquo; thought Vinicius.</p>

  <p>He was not astonished greatly at not meeting them on the Via Portuensis,
  for they might have left the Trans-Tiber through the opposite side along the
  Vatican Hill. In every case they were safe from fire at least. A stone fell
  from his breast. He saw, it is true, the terrible danger with which the
  flight was connected, but he was comforted at thought of the preterhuman
  strength of Ursus. &ldquo;I must flee now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and reach
  the gardens of Agrippina through the gardens of Domitius, where I shall find
  them. The smoke is not so terrible there, since the wind blows from the
  Sabine Hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The hour had come now in which he must think of his own safety, for the
  river of fire was flowing nearer and nearer from the direction of the island,
  and rolls of smoke covered the alley almost completely. The taper, which had
  lighted him in the house, was quenched from the current of air. Vinicius
  rushed to the street, and ran at full speed toward the Via Portuensis, whence
  he had come; the fire seemed to pursue him with burning breath, now
  surrounding him with fresh clouds of smoke, now covering him with sparks,
  which fell on his hair, neck, and clothing. The tunic began to smoulder on
  him in places; he cared not, but ran forward lest he might be stifled from
  smoke. He had the taste of soot and burning in his mouth; his throat and
  lungs were as if on fire. The blood rushed to his head, and at moments all
  things, even the smoke itself, seemed red to him. Then he thought:
  &ldquo;This is living fire! Better cast myself on the ground and
  perish.&rdquo; The running tortured him more and more. His head, neck, and
  shoulders were streaming with sweat, which scalded like boiling water. Had it
  not been for Lygia&rsquo;s name, repeated by him in thought, had it not been
  for her capitium, which he wound across his mouth, he would have fallen. Some
  moments later he failed to recognize the street along which he ran.
  Consciousness was leaving him gradually; he remembered only that he must
  flee, for in the open field beyond waited Lygia, whom Peter had promised him.
  And all at once he was seized by a certain wonderful conviction, half
  feverish, like a vision before death, that he must see her, marry her, and
  then die.</p>

  <p>But he ran on as if drunk, staggering from one side of the street to the
  other. Meanwhile something changed in that monstrous conflagration which had
  embraced the giant city. Everything which till then had only glimmered, burst
  forth visibly into one sea of flame; the wind had ceased to bring smoke. That
  smoke which had collected in the streets was borne away by a mad whirl of
  heated air. That whirl drove with it millions of sparks, so that Vinicius was
  running in a fiery cloud as it were. But he was able to see before him all
  the better, and in a moment, almost when he was ready to fall, he saw the end
  of the street. That sight gave him fresh strength. Passing the corner, he
  found himself in a street which led to the Via Portuensis and the Codetan
  Field. The sparks ceased to drive him. He understood that if he could run to
  the Via Portuensis he was safe, even were he to faint on it.</p>

  <p>At the end of the street he saw again a cloud, as it seemed, which stopped
  the exit. &ldquo;If that is smoke,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I cannot
  pass.&rdquo; He ran with the remnant of his strength. On the way he threw off
  his tunic, which, on fire from the sparks, was burning him like the shirt of
  Nessus, having only Lygia&rsquo;s capitium around his head and before his
  mouth. When he had run farther, he saw that what he had taken for smoke was
  dust, from which rose a multitude of cries and voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The rabble are plundering houses,&rdquo; thought Vinicius. But he
  ran toward the voices. In every case people were there; they might assist
  him. In this hope he shouted for aid with all his might before he reached
  them. But this was his last effort. It grew redder still in his eyes, breath
  failed his lungs, strength failed his bones; he fell.</p>

  <p>They heard him, however, or rather saw him. Two men ran with gourds full
  of water. Vinicius, who had fallen from exhaustion but had not lost
  consciousness, seized a gourd with both hands, and emptied one-half of
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;place me on my feet, I can walk on
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other laborer poured water on his head; the two not only placed him on
  his feet, but raised him from the ground, and carried him to the others, who
  surrounded him and asked if he had suffered seriously. This tenderness
  astonished Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People, who are ye?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are breaking down houses, so that the fire may not reach the Via
  Portuensis,&rdquo; answered one of the laborers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye came to my aid when I had fallen. Thanks to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are not permitted to refuse aid,&rdquo; answered a number of
  voices.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who from early morning had seen brutal crowds, slaying and
  robbing, looked with more attention on the faces around him, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Christ reward you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Praise to His name!&rdquo; exclaimed a whole chorus of voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Linus?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>But he could not finish the question or hear the answer, for he fainted
  from emotion and over-exertion. He recovered only in the Codetan Field in a
  garden, surrounded by a number of men and women. The first words which he
  uttered were,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Linus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a while there was no answer; then some voice, known to Vinicius, said
  all at once,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He went out by the Nomentan Gate to Ostrianum two days ago. Peace
  be with thee, O king of Persia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius rose to a sitting posture, and saw Chilo before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy house is burned surely, O lord,&rdquo; said the Greek,
  &ldquo;for the Carinæ is in flames; but thou wilt be always as rich as Midas.
  Oh, what a misfortune! The Christians, O son of Serapis, have predicted this
  long time that fire would destroy the city. But Linus, with the daughter of
  Jove, is in Ostrianum. Oh, what a misfortune for the city!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius became weak again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou seen them?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw them, O lord. May Christ and all the gods be thanked that I
  am able to pay for thy benefactions with good news. But, O Cyrus, I shall pay
  thee still more, I swear by this burning Rome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was evening, but in the garden one could see as in daylight, for the
  conflagration had increased. It seemed that not single parts of the city were
  burning, but the whole city through the length and the breadth of it. The sky
  was red as far as the eye could see it, and that night in the world was a red
  night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44">CHAPTER XLIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Light from the burning city filled the sky as far as human
  eye could reach. The moon rose large and full from behind the mountains, and
  inflamed at once by the glare took on the color of heated brass. It seemed to
  look with amazement on the world-ruling city which was perishing. In the
  rose-colored abysses of heaven rose-colored stars were glittering; but in
  distinction from usual nights the earth was brighter than the heavens. Rome,
  like a giant pile, illuminated the whole Campania. In the bloody light were
  seen distant mountains, towns, villas, temples, mountains, and the aqueducts
  stretching toward the city from all the adjacent hills; on the aqueducts were
  swarms of people, who had gathered there for safety or to gaze at the
  burning.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the dreadful element was embracing new divisions of the city. It
  was impossible to doubt that criminal hands were spreading the fire, since
  new conflagrations were breaking out all the time in places remote from the
  principal fire. From the heights on which Rome was founded the flames flowed
  like waves of the sea into the valleys densely occupied by
  houses,&mdash;houses of five and six stories, full of shops, booths, movable
  wooden amphitheatres, built to accommodate various spectacles; and finally
  storehouses of wood, olives, grain, nuts, pine cones, the kernels of which
  nourished the more needy population, and clothing, which through
  Cæsar&rsquo;s favor was distributed from time to time among the rabble
  huddled into narrow alleys. In those places the fire, finding abundance of
  inflammable materials, became almost a series of explosions, and took
  possession of whole streets with unheard-of rapidity. People encamping
  outside the city, or standing on the aqueducts knew from the color of the
  flame what was burning. The furious power of the wind carried forth from the
  fiery gulf thousands and millions of burning shells of walnuts and almonds,
  which, shooting suddenly into the sky, like countless flocks of bright
  butterflies, burst with a crackling, or, driven by the wind, fell in other
  parts of the city, on aqueducts, and fields beyond Rome. All thought of
  rescue seemed out of place; confusion increased every moment, for on one side
  the population of the city was fleeing through every gate to places outside;
  on the other the fire had lured in thousands of people from the neighborhood,
  such as dwellers in small towns, peasants, and half-wild shepherds of the
  Campania, brought in by hope of plunder. The shout, &ldquo;Rome is
  perishing!&rdquo; did not leave the lips of the crowd; the ruin of the city
  seemed at that time to end every rule, and loosen all bonds which hitherto
  had joined people in a single integrity. The mob, in which slaves were more
  numerous, cared nothing for the lordship of Rome. Destruction of the city
  could only free them; hence here and there they assumed a threatening
  attitude. Violence and robbery were extending. It seemed that only the
  spectacle of the perishing city arrested attention, and restrained for the
  moment an outburst of slaughter, which would begin as soon as the city was
  turned into ruins. Hundreds of thousands of slaves, forgetting that Rome,
  besides temples and walls, possessed some tens of legions in all parts of the
  world, appeared merely waiting for a watchword and a leader. People began to
  mention the name of Spartacus, but Spartacus was not alive. Meanwhile
  citizens assembled, and armed themselves each with what he could. The most
  monstrous reports were current at all the gates. Some declared that Vulcan,
  commanded by Jupiter, was destroying the city with fire from beneath the
  earth; others that Vesta was taking vengeance for Rubria. People with these
  convictions did not care to save anything, but, besieging the temples,
  implored mercy of the gods. It was repeated most generally, however, that
  Cæsar had given command to burn Rome, so as to free himself from odors which
  rose from the Subura, and build a new city under the name of Neronia. Rage
  seized the populace at thought of this; and if, as Vinicius believed, a
  leader had taken advantage of that outburst of hatred, Nero&rsquo;s hour
  would have struck whole years before it did.</p>

  <p>It was said also that Cæsar had gone mad, that he would command pretorians
  and gladiators to fall upon the people and make a general slaughter. Others
  swore by the gods that wild beasts had been let out of all the vivaria at
  Bronzebeard&rsquo;s command. Men had seen on the streets lions with burning
  manes, and mad elephants and bisons, trampling down people in crowds. There
  was even some truth in this; for in certain places elephants, at sight of the
  approaching fire, had burst the vivaria, and, gaining their freedom, rushed
  away from the fire in wild fright, destroying everything before them like a
  tempest. Public report estimated at tens of thousands the number of persons
  who had perished in the conflagration. In truth a great number had perished.
  There were people who, losing all their property, or those dearest their
  hearts, threw themselves willingly into the flames, from despair. Others were
  suffocated by smoke. In the middle of the city, between the Capitol, on one
  side, and the Quirinal, the Viminal, and the Esquiline on the other, as also
  between the Palatine and the Cælian Hill, where the streets were most densely
  occupied, the fire began in so many places at once that whole crowds of
  people, while fleeing in one direction, struck unexpectedly on a new wall of
  fire in front of them, and died a dreadful death in a deluge of flame.</p>

  <p>In terror, in distraction, and bewilderment, people knew not where to
  flee. The streets were obstructed with goods, and in many narrow places were
  simply closed. Those who took refuge in those markets and squares of the
  city, where the Flavian Amphitheatre stood afterward, near the temple of the
  Earth, near the Portico of Silvia, and higher up, at the temples of Juno and
  Lucinia, between the Clivus Virbius and the old Esquiline Gate, perished from
  heat, surrounded by a sea of fire. In places not reached by the flames were
  found afterward hundreds of bodies burned to a crisp, though here and there
  unfortunates tore up flat stones and half buried themselves in defence
  against the heat. Hardly a family inhabiting the centre of the city survived
  in full; hence along the walls, at the gates, on all roads were heard howls
  of despairing women, calling on the dear names of those who had perished in
  the throng or the fire.</p>

  <p>And so, while some were imploring the gods, others blasphemed them because
  of this awful catastrophe. Old men were seen coming from the temple of
  Jupiter Liberator, stretching forth their hands, and crying, &ldquo;If thou
  be a liberator, save thy altars and the city!&rdquo; But despair turned
  mainly against the old Roman gods, who, in the minds of the populace, were
  bound to watch over the city more carefully than others. They had proved
  themselves powerless; hence were insulted. On the other hand it happened on
  the Via Asinaria that when a company of Egyptian priests appeared conducting
  a statue of Isis, which they had saved from the temple near the Porta
  Cælimontana, a crowd of people rushed among the priests, attached themselves
  to the chariot, which they drew to the Appian Gate, and seizing the statue
  placed it in the temple of Mars, overwhelming the priests of that deity who
  dared to resist them. In other places people invoked Serapis, Baal, or
  Jehovah, whose adherents, swarming out of the alleys in the neighborhood of
  the Subura and the Trans-Tiber, filled with shouts and uproar the fields near
  the walls. In their cries were heard tones as if of triumph; when, therefore,
  some of the citizens joined the chorus and glorified &ldquo;the Lord of the
  World,&rdquo; others, indignant at this glad shouting, strove to repress it
  by violence. Here and there hymns were heard, sung by men in the bloom of
  life, by old men, by women and children,&mdash;hymns wonderful and solemn,
  whose meaning they understood not, but in which were repeated from moment to
  moment the words, &ldquo;Behold the Judge cometh in the day of wrath and
  disaster.&rdquo; Thus this deluge of restless and sleepless people encircled
  the burning city, like a tempest-driven sea.</p>

  <p>But neither despair nor blasphemy nor hymn helped in any way. The
  destruction seemed as irresistible, perfect, and pitiless as Predestination
  itself. Around Pompey&rsquo;s Amphitheatre stores of hemp caught fire, and
  ropes used in circuses, arenas, and every kind of machine at the games, and
  with them the adjoining buildings containing barrels of pitch with which
  ropes were smeared. In a few hours all that part of the city, beyond which
  lay the Campus Martius, was so lighted by bright yellow flames that for a
  time it seemed to the spectators, only half conscious from terror, that in
  the general ruin the order of night and day had been lost, and that they were
  looking at sunshine. But later a monstrous bloody gleam extinguished all
  other colors of flame. From the sea of fire shot up to the heated sky
  gigantic fountains, and pillars of flame spreading at their summits into
  fiery branches and feathers; then the wind bore them away, turned them into
  golden threads, into hair, into sparks, and swept them on over the Campania
  toward the Alban Hills. The night became brighter; the air itself seemed
  penetrated, not only with light, but with flame. The Tiber flowed on as
  living fire. The hapless city was turned into one pandemonium. The
  conflagration seized more and more space, took hills by storm, flooded level
  places, drowned valleys, raged, roared, and thundered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45">CHAPTER XLV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Macrinus, a weaver, to whose house Vinicius was carried,
  washed him, and gave him clothing and food. When the young tribune had
  recovered his strength altogether, he declared that he would search further
  for Linus that very night. Macrinus, who was a Christian, confirmed
  Chilo&rsquo;s report, that Linus, with Clement the chief priest, had gone to
  Ostrianum, where Peter was to baptize a whole company of confessors of the
  new faith. In that division of the city it was known to Christians that Linus
  had confided the care of his house two days before to a certain Gaius. For
  Vinicius this was a proof that neither Lygia nor Ursus had remained in the
  house, and that they also must have gone to Ostrianum.</p>

  <p>This thought gave him great comfort. Linus was an old man, for whom it
  would be difficult to walk daily to the distant Nomentan Gate, and back to
  the Trans-Tiber; hence it was likely that he lodged those few days with some
  co-religionist beyond the walls, and with him also Lygia and Ursus. Thus they
  escaped the fire, which in general had not reached the other slope of the
  Esquiline. Vinicius saw in all this a dispensation of Christ, whose care he
  felt above him, and his heart was filled more than ever with love; he swore
  in his soul to pay with his whole life for those clear marks of favor.</p>

  <p>But all the more did he hurry to Ostrianum. He would find Lygia, find
  Linus and Peter; he would take them to a distance, to some of his lands, even
  to Sicily. Let Rome burn; in a few days it would be a mere heap of ashes. Why
  remain in the face of disaster and a mad rabble? In his lands troops of
  obedient slaves would protect them, they would be surrounded by the calm of
  the country, and live in peace under Christ&rsquo;s wings blessed by Peter.
  Oh, if he could find them!</p>

  <p>That was no easy thing. Vinicius remembered the difficulty with which he
  had passed from the Appian Way to the Trans-Tiber, and how he must circle
  around to reach the Via Portuensis. He resolved, therefore, to go around the
  city this time in the opposite direction. Going by the Via Triumphatoris, it
  was possible to reach the Æmilian bridge by going along the river, thence
  passing the Pincian Hill, all the Campus Martius, outside the gardens of
  Pompey, Lucullus, and Sallust, to make a push forward to the Via Nomentana.
  That was the shortest way; but Macrinus and Chilo advised him not to take it.
  The fire had not touched that part of the city, it is true; but all the
  market squares and streets might be packed densely with people and their
  goods. Chilo advised him to go through the Ager Vaticanus to the Porta
  Flaminia, cross the river at that point, and push on outside the walls beyond
  the gardens of Acilius to the Porta Salaria. Vinicius, after a moment&rsquo;s
  hesitation, took this advice.</p>

  <p>Macrinus had to remain in care of his house; but he provided two mules,
  which would serve Lygia also in a further journey. He wished to give a slave,
  too; but Vinicius refused, judging that the first detachment of pretorians he
  met on the road would pass under his orders.</p>

  <p>Soon he and Chilo moved on through the Pagus Janiculensis to the Triumphal
  Way. There were vehicles there, too, in open places; but they pushed between
  them with less difficulty, as the inhabitants had fled for the greater part
  by the Via Portuensis toward the sea. Beyond the Septimian Gate they rode
  between the river and the splendid gardens of Domitius; the mighty cypresses
  were red from the conflagration, as if from evening sunshine. The road became
  freer; at times they had to struggle merely with the current of incoming
  rustics. Vinicius urged his mule forward as much as possible; but Chilo,
  riding closely in the rear, talked to himself almost the whole way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we have left the fire behind, and now it is heating our
  shoulders. Never yet has there been so much light on this road in the night-
  time. O Zeus! if thou wilt not send torrents of rain on that fire, thou hast
  no love for Rome, surely. The power of man will not quench those flames. Such
  a city,&mdash;a city which Greece and the whole world was serving! And now
  the first Greek who comes along may roast beans in its ashes. Who could have
  looked for this? And now there will be no longer a Rome, nor Roman rulers.
  Whoso wants to walk on the ashes, when they grow cold, and whistle over them,
  may whistle without danger. O gods! to whistle over such a world-ruling city!
  What Greek, or even barbarian, could have hoped for this? And still one may
  whistle; for a heap of ashes, whether left after a shepherd&rsquo;s fire or a
  burnt city, is mere ashes, which the wind will blow away sooner or
  later.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus talking, he turned from moment to moment toward the conflagration,
  and looked at the waves of flame with a face filled at once with delight and
  malice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will perish! It will perish!&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and
  will never be on earth again. Whither will the world send its wheat now, its
  olives, and its money? Who will squeeze gold and tears from it? Marble does
  not burn, but it crumbles in fire. The Capitol will turn into dust, and the
  Palatine into dust. O Zeus! Rome was like a shepherd, and other nations like
  sheep. When the shepherd was hungry, he slaughtered a sheep, ate the flesh,
  and to thee, O father of the gods, he made an offering of the skin. Who, O
  Cloud-compeller, will do the slaughtering now, and into whose hand wilt thou
  put the shepherd&rsquo;s whip? For Rome is burning, O father, as truly as if
  thou hadst fired it with thy thunderbolt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; urged Vinicius; &ldquo;what art thou doing
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am weeping over Rome, lord,&mdash;Jove&rsquo;s city!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a time they rode on in silence, listening to the roar of the burning,
  and the sound of birds&rsquo; wings. Doves, a multitude of which had their
  nests about villas and in small towns of the Campania, and also every kind of
  field-bird from near the sea and the surrounding mountains, mistaking
  evidently the gleam of the conflagration for sunlight, were flying, whole
  flocks of them, blindly into the fire. Vinicius broke the silence
  first,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where wert thou when the fire burst out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was going to my friend Euricius, lord, who kept a shop near the
  Circus Maximus, and I was just meditating on the teaching of Christ, when men
  began to shout: &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; People gathered around the Circus for
  safety, and through curiosity; but when the flames seized the whole Circus,
  and began to appear in other places also, each had to think of his own
  safety.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didst thou see people throwing torches into houses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have I not seen, O grandson of Æneas! I saw people making a
  way for themselves through the crowd with swords; I have seen battles, the
  entrails of people trampled on the pavement. Ah, if thou hadst seen that,
  thou wouldst have thought that barbarians had captured the city, and were
  putting it to the sword. People round about cried that the end of the world
  had come. Some lost their heads altogether, and, forgetting to flee, waited
  stupidly till the flames seized them. Some fell into bewilderment, others
  howled in despair; I saw some also who howled from delight. O lord, there are
  many bad people in the world who know not how to value the benefactions of
  your mild rule, and those just laws in virtue of which ye take from all what
  they have and give it to yourselves. People will not be reconciled to the
  will of God!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the irony
  quivering in Chilo&rsquo;s words. A shudder of terror seized him at the
  simple thought that Lygia might be in the midst of that chaos on those
  terrible streets where people&rsquo;s entrails were trampled on. Hence,
  though he had asked at least ten times of Chilo touching all which the old
  man could know, he turned to him once again,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But hast thou seen them in Ostrianum with thy own eyes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw them, O son of Venus; I saw the maiden, the good Lygian, holy
  Linus, and the Apostle Peter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before the fire?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before the fire, O Mithra!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But a doubt rose in the soul of Vinicius whether Chilo was not lying;
  hence, reining his mule in, he looked threateningly at the old Greek and
  inquired,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What wert thou doing there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo was confused. True, it seemed to him, as to many, that with the
  destruction of Rome would come the end also of Roman dominion. But he was
  face to face with Vinicius; he remembered that the young soldier had
  prohibited him, under a terrible threat, from watching the Christians, and
  especially Linus and Lygia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why dost thou not believe that I love
  them? I do. I was in Ostrianum, for I am half a Christian. Pyrrho has taught
  me to esteem virtue more than philosophy; hence I cleave more and more to
  virtuous people. And, besides, I am poor; and when thou, O Jove, wert at
  Antium, I suffered hunger frequently over my books; therefore I sat at the
  wall of Ostrianum, for the Christians, though poor, distribute more alms than
  all other inhabitants of Rome taken together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This reason seemed sufficient to Vinicius, and he inquired less
  severely,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And dost thou not know where Linus is dwelling at this
  moment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst punish me sharply on a time for curiosity,&rdquo;
  replied the Greek.</p>

  <p>Vinicius ceased talking and rode on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O lord,&rdquo; said Chilo, after a while, &ldquo;thou wouldst not
  have found the maiden but for me, and if we find her now, thou wilt not
  forget the needy sage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt receive a house with a vineyard at Ameriola.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee, O Hercules! With a vineyard? Thanks to thee! Oh,
  yes, with a vineyard!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were passing the Vatican Hill now, which was ruddy from the fire; but
  beyond the Naumachia they turned to the right, so that when they had passed
  the Vatican Field they would reach the river, and, crossing it, go to the
  Flaminian Gate. Suddenly Chilo reined in his mule, and said,&mdash;</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Chilo Accuses the Christians of Burning Rome.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;A good thought has come to my head, lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between the Janiculum and the Vatican Hill, beyond the gardens of
  Agrippina, are excavations from which stones and sand were taken to build the
  Circus of Nero. Hear me, lord. Recently the Jews, of whom, as thou knowest,
  there is a multitude in Trans-Tiber, have begun to persecute Christians
  cruelly. Thou hast in mind that in the time of the divine Claudius there were
  such disturbances that Cæsar was forced to expel them from Rome. Now, when
  they have returned, and when, thanks to the protection of the Augusta, they
  feel safe, they annoy Christians more insolently. I know this; I have seen
  it. No edict against Christians has been issued; but the Jews complain to the
  prefect of the city that Christians murder infants, worship an ass, and
  preach a religion not recognized by the Senate; they beat them, and attack
  their houses of prayer so fiercely that the Christians are forced to
  hide.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou wish to say?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This, lord, that synagogues exist openly in the Trans-Tiber; but
  that Christians, in their wish to avoid persecution, are forced to pray in
  secret and assemble in ruined sheds outside the city or in sand-pits. Those
  who dwell in the Trans-Tiber have chosen just that place which was excavated
  for the building of the Circus and various houses along the Tiber. Now, when
  the city is perishing, the adherents of Christ are praying. Beyond doubt we
  shall find a countless number of them in the excavation; so my advice is to
  go in there along the road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou hast said that Linus has gone to Ostrianum,&rdquo; cried
  Vinicius impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou has promised me a house with a vineyard at
  Ameriola,&rdquo; answered Chilo; &ldquo;for that reason I wish to seek the
  maiden wherever I hope to find her. They might have returned to the
  Trans-Tiber after the outbreak of the fire. They might have gone around
  outside the city, as we are doing at this moment. Linus has a house, perhaps
  he wished to be nearer his house to see if the fire had seized that part of
  the city also. If they have returned, I swear to thee, by Persephone, that we
  shall find them at prayer in the excavation; in the worst event, we shall get
  tidings of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art right; lead on!&rdquo; said the tribune.</p>

  <p>Chilo, without hesitation, turned to the left toward the hill.</p>

  <p>For a while the slope of the hill concealed the conflagration, so that,
  though the neighboring heights were in the light, the two men were in the
  shade. When they had passed the Circus, they turned still to the left, and
  entered a kind of passage completely dark. But in that darkness Vinicius saw
  swarms of gleaming lanterns.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are there,&rdquo; said Chilo. &ldquo;There will be more of
  them to-day than ever, for other houses of prayer are burnt or are filled
  with smoke, as is the whole Trans-Tiber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;I hear singing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact, the voices of people singing reached the hill from the dark
  opening, and the lanterns vanished in it one after the other. But from side
  passages new forms appeared continually, so that after some time Vinicius and
  Chilo found themselves amid a whole assemblage of people.</p>

  <p>Chilo slipped from his mule, and, beckoning to a youth who sat near, said
  to him,&mdash;&ldquo;I am a priest of Christ and a bishop. Hold the mules for
  us; thou wilt receive my blessing and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, without waiting for an answer, he thrust the reins into his hands,
  and, in company with Vinicius, joined the advancing throng.</p>

  <p>They entered the excavation after a while, and pushed on through the dark
  passage by the dim light of lanterns till they reached a spacious cave, from
  which stone had been taken evidently, for the walls were formed of fresh
  fragments.</p>

  <p>It was brighter there than in the corridor, for, in addition to tapers and
  lanterns, torches were burning. By the light of these Vinicius saw a whole
  throng of kneeling people with upraised hands. He could not see Lygia, the
  Apostle Peter, or Linus, but he was surrounded by faces solemn and full of
  emotion. On some of them expectation or alarm was evident; on some, hope.
  Light was reflected in the whites of their upraised eyes; perspiration was
  flowing along their foreheads, pale as chalk; some were singing hymns, others
  were repeating feverishly the name of Jesus, some were beating their breasts.
  It was apparent that they expected something uncommon at any moment.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the hymn ceased, and above the assembly, in a niche formed by
  the removal of an immense stone, appeared Crispus, the acquaintance of
  Vinicius, with a face as it were half delirious, pale, stern, and fanatical.
  All eyes were turned to him, as though waiting for words of consolation and
  hope. After he had blessed the assembly, he began in hurried, almost shouting
  tones,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bewail your sins, for the hour has come! Behold the Lord has sent
  down destroying flames on Babylon, on the city of profligacy and crime. The
  hour of judgment has struck, the hour of wrath and dissolution. The Lord has
  promised to come, and soon you will see Him. He will not come as the Lamb,
  who offered His blood for your sins, but as an awful judge, who in His
  justice will hurl sinners and unbelievers into the pit. Woe to the world, woe
  to sinners! there will be no mercy for them. I see Thee, O Christ! Stars are
  falling to the earth in showers, the sun is darkened, the earth opens in
  yawning gulfs, the dead rise from their graves, but Thou art moving amid the
  sound of trumpets and legions of angels, amid thunders and lightnings. I see
  Thee, I hear Thee, O Christ!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he was silent, and, raising his eyes, seemed to gaze into something
  distant and dreadful. That moment a dull roar was heard in the
  cave,&mdash;once, twice, a tenth time, in the burning city whole streets of
  partly consumed houses began to fall with a crash. But most Christians took
  those sounds as a visible sign that the dreadful hour was approaching; belief
  in the early second coming of Christ and in the end of the world was
  universal among them, now the destruction of the city had strengthened it.
  Terror seized the assembly. Many voices repeated, &ldquo;The day of judgment!
  Behold, it is coming!&rdquo; Some covered their faces with their hands,
  believing that the earth would be shaken to its foundation, that beasts of
  hell would rush out through its openings and hurl themselves on sinners.
  Others cried, &ldquo;Christ have mercy on us!&rdquo; &ldquo;Redeemer, be
  pitiful!&rdquo; Some confessed their sins aloud; others cast themselves into
  the arms of friends, so as to have some near heart with them in the hour of
  dismay.</p>

  <p>But there were faces which seemed rapt into heaven, faces with smiles not
  of earth; these showed no fear. In some places were heard voices; those were
  of people who in religious excitement had begun to cry out unknown words in
  strange languages. Some person in a dark corner cried, &ldquo;Wake thou that
  sleepest!&rdquo; Above all rose the shout of Crispus, &ldquo;Watch ye! watch
  ye!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At moments, however, silence came, as if all were holding the breath in
  their breasts, and waiting for what would come. And then was heard the
  distant thunder of parts of the city falling into ruins, after which were
  heard again groans and cries,&mdash;&ldquo;Renounce earthly riches, for soon
  there will be no earth beneath your feet! Renounce earthly loves, for the
  Lord will condemn those who love wife or child more than Him. Woe to the one
  who loves the creature more than the Creator! Woe to the rich! woe to the
  luxurious! woe to the dissolute! woe to husband, wife, and child!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly a roar louder than any which had preceded shook the quarry. All
  fell to the earth, stretching their arms in cross form to ward away evil
  spirits by that figure. Silence followed, in which was heard only panting
  breath, whispers full of terror, &ldquo;Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!&rdquo; and in
  places the weeping of children. At that moment a certain calm voice spoke
  above that prostrate multitude,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace be with you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was the voice of Peter the Apostle, who had entered the cave a moment
  earlier. At the sound of his voice terror passed at once, as it passes from a
  flock in which the shepherd has appeared. People rose from the earth; those
  who were nearer gathered at his knees, as if seeking protection under his
  wings. He stretched his hands over them and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why are ye troubled in heart? Who of you can tell what will happen
  before the hour cometh? The Lord has punished Babylon with fire; but His
  mercy will be on those whom baptism has purified, and ye whose sins are
  redeemed by the blood of the Lamb will die with His name on your lips. Peace
  be with you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After the terrible and merciless words of Crispus, those of Peter fell
  like a balm on all present. Instead of fear of God, the love of God took
  possession of their spirits. Those people found the Christ whom they had
  learned to love from the Apostle&rsquo;s narratives; hence not a merciless
  judge, but a mild and patient Lamb, whose mercy surpasses man&rsquo;s
  wickedness a hundredfold. A feeling of solace possessed the whole assembly;
  and comfort, with thankfulness to the Apostle, filled their hearts, Voices
  from various sides began to cry, &ldquo;We are thy sheep, feed us!&rdquo;
  Those nearer said, &ldquo;Desert us not in the day of disaster!&rdquo; And
  they knelt at his knees; seeing which Vinicius approached, seized the edge of
  Peter&rsquo;s mantle, and, inclining, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save me, lord. I have sought her in the smoke of the burning and in
  the throng of people; nowhere could I find her, but I believe that thou canst
  restore her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Peter placed his hand on the tribune&rsquo;s head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have trust,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46">CHAPTER XLVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The city burned on. The Circus Maximus had fallen in ruins.
  Entire streets and alleys in parts which began to burn first were falling in
  turn. After every fall pillars of flame rose for a time to the very sky. The
  wind had changed, and blew now with mighty force from the sea, bearing toward
  the Cælian, the Esquiline, and the Viminal rivers of flame, brands, and
  cinders. Still the authorities provided for rescue. At command of Tigellinus,
  who had hastened from Antium the third day before, houses on the Esquiline
  were torn down so that the fire, reaching empty spaces, died of itself. That
  was, however, undertaken solely to save a remnant of the city; to save that
  which was burning was not to be thought of. There was need also to guard
  against further results of the ruin. Incalculable wealth had perished in
  Rome; all the property of its citizens had vanished; hundreds of thousands of
  people were wandering in utter want outside the walls. Hunger had begun to
  pinch this throng the second day, for the immense stores of provisions in the
  city had burned with it. In the universal disorder and in the destruction of
  authority no one had thought of furnishing new supplies. Only after the
  arrival of Tigellinus were proper orders sent to Ostia; but meanwhile the
  people had grown more threatening.</p>

  <p>The house at Aqua Appia, in which Tigellinus lodged for the moment, was
  surrounded by crowds of women, who from morning till late at night cried,
  &ldquo;Bread and a roof!&rdquo; Vainly did pretorians, brought from the great
  camp between the Via Salaria and the Nomentana, strive to maintain order of
  some kind. Here and there they were met by open, armed resistance. In places
  weaponless crowds pointed to the burning city, and shouted, &ldquo;Kill us in
  view of that fire!&rdquo; They abused Cæsar, the Augustians, the pretorians;
  excitement rose every moment, so that Tigellinus, looking at night on the
  thousands of fires around the city, said to himself that those were fires in
  hostile camps.</p>

  <p>Besides flour, as much baked bread as possible was brought at his command,
  not only from Ostia, but from all towns and neighboring villages. When the
  first instalment came at night to the Emporium, the people broke the chief
  gate toward the Aventine, seized all supplies in the twinkle of an eye, and
  caused terrible disturbance. In the light of the conflagration they fought
  for loaves, and trampled many of them into the earth. Flour from torn bags
  whitened like snow the whole space from the granary to the arches of Drusus
  and Germanicus. The uproar continued till soldiers seized the building and
  dispersed the crowd with arrows and missiles.</p>

  <p>Never since the invasion by the Gauls under Brennus had Rome beheld such
  disaster. People in despair compared the two conflagrations. But in the time
  of Brennus the Capitol remained. Now the Capitol was encircled by a dreadful
  wreath of flame. The marbles, it is true, were not blazing; but at night,
  when the wind swept the flames aside for a moment, rows of columns in the
  lofty sanctuary of Jove were visible, red as glowing coals. In the days of
  Brennus, moreover, Rome had a disciplined integral people, attached to the
  city and its altars; but now crowds of a many-tongued populace roamed
  nomad-like around the walls of burning Rome,&mdash;people composed for the
  greater part of slaves and freedmen, excited, disorderly, and ready, under
  the pressure of want, to turn against authority and the city.</p>

  <p>But the very immensity of the fire, which terrified every heart, disarmed
  the crowd in a certain measure. After the fire might come famine and disease;
  and to complete the misfortune the terrible heat of July had appeared. It was
  impossible to breathe air inflamed both by fire and the sun. Night brought no
  relief, on the contrary it presented a hell. During daylight an awful and
  ominous spectacle met the eye. In the centre a giant city on heights was
  turned into a roaring volcano; round about as far as the Alban Hills was one
  boundless camp, formed of sheds, tents, huts, vehicles, bales, packs, stands,
  fires, all covered with smoke and dust, lighted by sun-rays reddened by
  passing through smoke,&mdash;everything filled with roars, shouts, threats,
  hatred and terror, a monstrous swarm of men, women, and children. Mingled
  with Quirites were Greeks, shaggy men from the North with blue eyes,
  Africans, and Asiatics; among citizens were slaves, freedmen, gladiators,
  merchants, mechanics, servants, and soldiers,&mdash;a real sea of people,
  flowing around the island of fire.</p>

  <p>Various reports moved this sea as wind does a real one. These reports were
  favorable and unfavorable. People told of immense supplies of wheat and
  clothing to be brought to the Emporium and distributed gratis. It was said,
  too, that provinces in Asia and Africa would be stripped of their wealth at
  Cæsar&rsquo;s command, and the treasures thus gained be given to the
  inhabitants of Rome, so that each man might build his own dwelling. But it
  was noised about also that water in the aqueducts had been poisoned; that
  Nero intended to annihilate the city, destroy the inhabitants to the last
  person, then move to Greece or to Egypt, and rule the world from a new place.
  Each report ran with lightning speed, and each found belief among the rabble,
  causing outbursts of hope, anger, terror, or rage. Finally a kind of fever
  mastered those nomadic thousands. The belief of Christians that the end of
  the world by fire was at hand, spread even among adherents of the gods, and
  extended daily. People fell into torpor or madness. In clouds lighted by the
  burning, gods were seen gazing down on the ruin; hands were stretched toward
  those gods then to implore pity or send them curses.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile soldiers, aided by a certain number of inhabitants, continued to
  tear down houses on the Esquiline and the Cælian, as also in the Trans-
  Tiber; these divisions were saved therefore in considerable part. But in the
  city itself were destroyed incalculable treasures accumulated through
  centuries of conquest; priceless works of art, splendid temples, the most
  precious monuments of Rome&rsquo;s past, and Rome&rsquo;s glory. They foresaw
  that of all Rome there would remain barely a few parts on the edges, and that
  hundreds of thousands of people would be without a roof. Some spread reports
  that the soldiers were tearing down houses not to stop the fire, but to
  prevent any part of the city from being saved. Tigellinus sent courier after
  courier to Antium, imploring Cæsar in each letter to come and calm the
  despairing people with his presence. But Nero moved only when fire had seized
  the &ldquo;domus transitoria,&rdquo; and he hurried so as not to miss the
  moment in which the conflagration should be at its highest.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile fire had reached the Via Nomentana, but turned from it at once
  with a change of wind toward the Via Lata and the Tiber. It surrounded the
  Capitol, spread along the Forum Boarium, destroyed everything which it had
  spared before, and approached the Palatine a second time.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus, assembling all the pretorian forces, despatched courier after
  courier to Cæsar with an announcement that he would lose nothing of the
  grandeur of the spectacle, for the fire had increased.</p>

  <p>But Nero, who was on the road, wished to come at night, so as to sate
  himself all the better with a view of the perishing capital. Therefore he
  halted, in the neighborhood of Aqua Albana, and, summoning to his tent the
  tragedian Aliturus, decided with his aid on posture, look, and expression;
  learned fitting gestures, disputing with the actor stubbornly whether at the
  words &ldquo;O sacred city, which seemed more enduring than Ida,&rdquo; he
  was to raise both hands, or, holding in one the forminga, drop it by his side
  and raise only the other. This question seemed to him then more important
  than all others. Starting at last about nightfall, he took counsel of
  Petronius also whether to the lines describing the catastrophe he might add a
  few magnificent blasphemies against the gods, and whether, considered from
  the standpoint of art, they would not have rushed spontaneously from the
  mouth of a man in such a position, a man who was losing his birthplace.</p>

  <p>At length he approached the walls about midnight with his numerous court,
  composed of whole detachments of nobles, senators, knights, freedmen, slaves,
  women, and children. Sixteen thousand pretorians, arranged in line of battle
  along the road, guarded the peace and safety of his entrance, and held the
  excited populace at a proper distance. The people cursed, shouted, and hissed
  on seeing the retinue, but dared not attack it. In many places, however,
  applause was given by the rabble, which, owning nothing, had lost nothing in
  the fire, and which hoped for a more bountiful distribution than usual of
  wheat, olives, clothing, and money. Finally, shouts, hissing, and applause
  were drowned in the blare of horns and trumpets, which Tigellinus had caused
  to be sounded.</p>

  <p>Nero, on arriving at the Ostian Gate, halted, and said, &ldquo;Houseless
  ruler of a houseless people, where shall I lay my unfortunate head for the
  night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After he had passed the Clivus Delphini, he ascended the Appian aqueduct
  on steps prepared purposely. After him followed the Augustians and a choir of
  singers, bearing citharæ, lutes, and other musical instruments.</p>

  <p>And all held the breath in their breasts, waiting to learn if he would say
  some great words, which for their own safety they ought to remember. But he
  stood solemn, silent, in a purple mantle, and a wreath of golden laurels,
  gazing at the raging might of the flames. When Terpnos gave him a golden
  lute, he raised his eyes to the sky, filled with the conflagration, as if he
  were waiting for inspiration.</p>

  <p>The people pointed at him from afar as he stood in the bloody gleam. In
  the distance fiery serpents were hissing. The ancient and most sacred
  edifices were in flames: the temple of Hercules, reared by Evander, was
  burning; the temple of Jupiter Stator was burning, the temple of Luna, built
  by Servius Tullius, the house of Numa Pompilius, the sanctuary of Vesta with
  the penates of the Roman people; through waving flames the Capitol appeared
  at intervals; the past and the spirit of Rome was burning. But he, Cæsar, was
  there with a lute in his hand and a theatrical expression on his face, not
  thinking of his perishing country, but of his posture and the prophetic words
  with which he might describe best the greatness of the catastrophe, rouse
  most admiration, and receive the warmest plaudits. He detested that city, he
  detested its inhabitants, beloved only his own songs and verses; hence he
  rejoiced in heart that at last he saw a tragedy like that which he was
  writing. The verse-maker was happy, the declaimer felt inspired, the seeker
  for emotions was delighted at the awful sight, and thought with rapture that
  even the destruction of Troy was as nothing if compared with the destruction
  of that giant city. What more could he desire? There was world-ruling Rome in
  flames, and he, standing on the arches of the aqueduct with a golden lute,
  conspicuous, purple, admired, magnificent, poetic. Down below, somewhere in
  the darkness, the people are muttering and storming. But let them mutter!
  Ages will pass, thousands of years will go by, but mankind will remember and
  glorify the poet, who in that night sang the fall and the burning of Troy.
  What was Homer compared with him? What Apollo himself with his hollowed-out
  lute?</p>

  <p>Here he raised his hands and, striking the strings, pronounced the words
  of Priam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O nest of my fathers, O dear cradle!&rdquo; His voice in the open
  air, with the roar of the conflagration, and the distant murmur of crowding
  thousands, seemed marvellously weak, uncertain, and low, and the sound of the
  accompaniment like the buzzing of insects. But senators, dignitaries, and
  Augustians, assembled on the aqueduct, bowed their heads and listened in
  silent rapture. He sang long, and his motive was ever sadder. At moments,
  when he stopped to catch breath, the chorus of singers repeated the last
  verse; then Nero cast the tragic &ldquo;syrma&rdquo; [A robe with train, worn
  especially by tragic actors] from his shoulder with a gesture learned from
  Aliturus, struck the lute, and sang on. When at last he had finished the
  lines composed, he improvised, seeking grandiose comparisons in the spectacle
  unfolded before him. His face began to change. He was not moved, it is true,
  by the destruction of his country&rsquo;s capital; but he was delighted and
  moved with the pathos of his own words to such a degree that his eyes filled
  with tears on a sudden. At last he dropped the lute to his feet with a
  clatter, and, wrapping himself in the &ldquo;syrma,&rdquo; stood as if
  petrified, like one of those statues of Niobe which ornamented the courtyard
  of the Palatine.</p>

  <p>Soon a storm of applause broke the silence. But in the distance this was
  answered by the howling of multitudes. No one doubted then that Cæsar had
  given command to burn the city, so as to afford himself a spectacle and sing
  a song at it. Nero, when he heard that cry from hundreds of thousands, turned
  to the Augustians with the sad, resigned smile of a man who is suffering from
  injustice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how the Quirites value poetry and
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scoundrels!&rdquo; answered Vatinius. &ldquo;Command the
  pretorians, lord, to fall on them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero turned to Tigellinus,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I count on the loyalty of the soldiers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, divinity,&rdquo; answered the prefect.</p>

  <p>But Petronius shrugged his shoulders, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On their loyalty, yes, but not on their numbers. Remain meanwhile
  where thou art, for here it is safest; but there is need to pacify the
  people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seneca was of this opinion also, as was Licinus the consul. Meanwhile the
  excitement below was increasing. The people were arming with stones, tent-
  poles, sticks from the wagons, planks, and various pieces of iron. After a
  while some of the pretorian leaders came, declaring that the cohorts, pressed
  by the multitude, kept the line of battle with extreme difficulty, and, being
  without orders to attack, they knew not what to do.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O gods,&rdquo; said Nero, &ldquo;what a night!&rdquo; On one side a
  fire, on the other a raging sea of people. And he fell to seeking expressions
  the most splendid to describe the danger of the moment, but, seeing around
  him alarmed looks and pale faces, he was frightened, with the others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me my dark mantle with a hood!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;must it
  come really to battle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Tigellinus, in an uncertain voice, &ldquo;I have
  done what I could, but danger is threatening. Speak, O lord, to the people,
  and make them promises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall Cæsar speak to the rabble? Let another do that in my name.
  Who will undertake it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; answered Petronius, calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go, my friend; thou art most faithful to me in every necessity. Go,
  and spare no promises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius turned to the retinue with a careless, sarcastic
  expression,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Senators here present, also Piso, Nerva, and Senecio, follow
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he descended the aqueduct slowly. Those whom he had summoned
  followed, not without hesitation, but with a certain confidence which his
  calmness had given them. Petronius, halting at the foot of the arches, gave
  command to bring him a white horse, and, mounting, rode on, at the head of
  the cavalcade, between the deep ranks of pretorians, to the black, howling
  multitude; he was unarmed, having only a slender ivory cane which he carried
  habitually.</p>

  <p>When he had ridden up, he pushed his horse into the throng. All around,
  visible in the light of the burning, were upraised hands, armed with every
  manner of weapon, inflamed eyes, sweating faces, bellowing and foaming lips.
  A mad sea of people surrounded him and his attendants; round about was a sea
  of heads, moving, roaring, dreadful.</p>

  <p>The outbursts increased and became an unearthly roar; poles, forks, and
  even swords were brandished above Petronius; grasping hands were stretched
  toward his horse&rsquo;s reins and toward him, but he rode farther; cool,
  indifferent, contemptuous. At moments he struck the most insolent heads with
  his cane, as if clearing a road for himself in an ordinary crowd; and that
  confidence of his, that calmness, amazed the raging rabble. They recognized
  him at length, and numerous voices began to shout,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius! Arbiter Elegantiarum! Petronius! Petronius!&rdquo; was
  heard on all sides. And as that name was repeated, the faces about became
  less terrible, the uproar less savage: for that exquisite patrician, though
  he had never striven for the favor of the populace, was still their favorite.
  He passed for a humane and magnanimous man; and his popularity had increased,
  especially since the affair of Pedanius Secundus, when he spoke in favor of
  mitigating the cruel sentence condemning all the slaves of that prefect to
  death. The slaves more especially loved him thenceforward with that unbounded
  love which the oppressed or unfortunate are accustomed to give those who show
  them even small sympathy. Besides, in that moment was added curiosity as to
  what Cæsar&rsquo;s envoy would say, for no one doubted that Cæsar had sent
  him.</p>

  <p>He removed his white toga, bordered with scarlet, raised it in the air,
  and waved it above his head, in sign that he wished to speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence! Silence!&rdquo; cried the people on all sides.</p>

  <p>After a while there was silence. Then he straightened himself on the horse
  and said in a clear, firm voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Citizens, let those who hear me repeat my words to those who are
  more distant, and bear yourselves, all of you, like men, not like beasts in
  the arena.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will, we will!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then listen. The city will be rebuilt. The gardens of Lucullus,
  Mæcenas, Cæsar, and Agrippina will be opened to you. To-morrow will begin the
  distribution of wheat, wine, and olives, so that every man may be full to the
  throat. Then Cæsar will have games for you, such as the world has not seen
  yet; during these games banquets and gifts will be given you. Ye will be
  richer after the fire than before it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A murmur answered him which spread from the centre in every direction, as
  a wave rises on water in which a stone has been cast. Those nearer repeated
  his words to those more distant. Afterward were heard here and there shouts
  of anger or applause, which turned at length into one universal call of
  &ldquo;Panem et circenses!!!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius wrapped himself in his toga and listened for a time without
  moving, resembling in his white garment a marble statue. The uproar
  increased, drowned the roar of the fire, was answered from every side and
  from ever-increasing distances. But evidently the envoy had something to add,
  for he waited. Finally, commanding silence anew, he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;I
  promised you panem et circenses; and now give a shout in honor of Cæsar, who
  feeds and clothes you; then go to sleep, dear populace, for the dawn will
  begin before long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned his horse then, and, tapping lightly with his cane the heads and
  faces of those who stood in his way, he rode slowly to the pretorian ranks.
  Soon he was under the aqueduct. He found almost a panic above, where they had
  not understood the shout &ldquo;Panem et circenses,&rdquo; and supposed it to
  be a new outburst of rage. They had not even expected that Petronius would
  save himself; so Nero, when he saw him, ran to the steps, and with face pale
  from emotion, inquired,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what are they doing? Is there a battle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius drew air into his lungs, breathed deeply, and
  answered,&mdash;&ldquo;By Pollux! they are sweating! and such a stench! Will
  some one give me an epilimma?&mdash;for I am faint.&rdquo; Then he turned to
  Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I promised them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;wheat, olives, the opening
  of the gardens, and games. They worship thee anew, and are howling in thy
  honor. Gods, what a foul odor those plebeians have!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had pretorians ready,&rdquo; cried Tigellinus; &ldquo;and hadst
  thou not quieted them, the shouters would have been silenced forever. It is a
  pity, Cæsar, that thou didst not let me use force.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at him, shrugged his shoulders, and added,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The chance is not lost. Thou mayst have to use it to-
  morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Cæsar, &ldquo;I will give command to open the
  gardens to them, and distribute wheat. Thanks to thee, Petronius, I will have
  games; and that song, which I sang to-day, I will sing publicly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he placed his hands on the arbiter&rsquo;s shoulder, was silent a
  moment, and starting up at last inquired,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me sincerely, how did I seem to thee while I was
  singing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert worthy of the spectacle, and the spectacle was worthy of
  thee,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But let us look at it again,&rdquo; said he, turning to the fire,
  &ldquo;and bid farewell to ancient Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47">CHAPTER XLVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Apostle&rsquo;s words put confidence in the souls of the
  Christians. The end of the world seemed ever near to them, but they began to
  think that the day of judgment would not come immediately, that first they
  would see the end of Nero&rsquo;s reign, which they looked on as the reign of
  Satan, and the punishment of God for Cæsar&rsquo;s crimes, which were crying
  for vengeance. Strengthened in heart, they dispersed, after the prayer, to
  their temporary dwellings, and even to the Trans-Tiber; for news had come
  that the fire, set there in a number of places, had, with the change of wind,
  turned back toward the river, and, after devouring what it could here and
  there, had ceased to extend.</p>

  <p>The Apostle, with Vinicius and Chilo, who followed him, left the
  excavation also. The young tribune did not venture to interrupt his prayers;
  hence he walked on in silence, merely imploring pity with his eyes, and
  trembling from alarm. Many approached to kiss Peter&rsquo;s hands, and the
  hem of his mantle; mothers held out their children to him; some knelt in the
  dark, long passage, and, holding up tapers, begged a blessing; others, going
  alongside, sang: so there was no chance for question or answer. Thus it was
  in the narrow passage. Only when they came out to broader spaces, from which
  the burning city was in view, did the Apostle bless them three times, and
  say, turning to Vinicius,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fear not. The hut of the quarryman is near; in it we shall find
  Linus, and Lygia, with her faithful servant. Christ, who predestined her to
  thee, has preserved her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius tottered, and placed his hand against the cliff. The road from
  Antium, the events at the wall, the search for Lygia amidst burning houses,
  sleeplessness, and his terrible alarm had exhausted him; and the news that
  the dearest person in the world was near by, and that soon he would see her,
  took the remnant of his strength from him. So great a weakness possessed him
  on a sudden that he dropped to the Apostle&rsquo;s feet, and, embracing his
  knees, remained thus, without power to say a word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not to me, not to me, but to Christ,&rdquo; said the Apostle, who
  warded off thanks and honor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a good God!&rdquo; said the voice of Chilo from behind,
  &ldquo;but what shall I do with the mules that are waiting down
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rise and come with me,&rdquo; said Peter to the young man.</p>

  <p>Vinicius rose. By the light of the burning, tears were visible on his
  face, which was pale from emotion. His lips moved, as if in prayer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>But Chilo repeated again: &ldquo;Lord, what shall I do with the mules that
  are waiting? Perhaps this worthy prophet prefers riding to
  walking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius did not know himself what to answer; but hearing from Peter that
  the quarryman&rsquo;s hut was near by, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the mules to Macrinus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, lord, if I mention the house in Ameriola. In view of
  such an awful fire, it is easy to forget a thing so paltry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt get it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O grandson of Numa Pompilius, I have always been sure, but now,
  when this magnanimous prophet also has heard the promise, I will not remind
  thee even of this, that thou hast promised me a vineyard. Pax vobiscum. I
  shall find thee, lord. Pax vobiscum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They answered, &ldquo;And peace with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then both turned to the right toward the hills. Along the road Vinicius
  said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, wash me with the water of baptism, so that I may call myself
  a real confessor of Christ, for I love Him with all the power of my soul.
  Wash me quickly, for I am ready in heart. And what thou commandest I will do,
  but tell me, so that I may do it in addition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Love men as thy own brothers,&rdquo; answered the Apostle,
  &ldquo;for only with love mayst thou serve Him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand and feel that. When a child I believed in the
  Roman gods, though I did not love them. But I so love Him the One God that I
  would give my life for Him gladly.&rdquo; And he looked toward the sky,
  repeating with exaltation: &ldquo;For He is one, for He alone is kind and
  merciful; hence, let not only this city perish, but the whole world, Him
  alone will I confess and recognize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And He will bless thee and thy house,&rdquo; concluded the
  Apostle.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile they turned into another ravine, at the end of which a faint
  light was visible. Peter pointed to it and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is the hut of the quarryman who gave us a refuge when, on the
  way from Ostrianum with the sick Linus, we could not go to the Trans-
  Tiber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a while they arrived. The hut was rather a cave rounded Out in an
  indentation of the hill, and was faced outside with a wall made of reeds. The
  door was closed, but through an opening, which served for a window, the
  interior was visible, lighted by a fire. Some dark giant figure rose up to
  meet them, and inquired,&mdash;&ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Servants of Christ,&rdquo; answered Peter. &ldquo;Peace be with
  thee, Ursus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ursus bent to the Apostle&rsquo;s feet; then, recognizing Vinicius, seized
  his hand by the wrist, and raised it to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou, lord,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Blessed be the name of the
  Lamb, for the joy which thou wilt bring to Callina.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened the door then, and entered. Linus was lying on a bundle of
  straw, with an emaciated face and a forehead as yellow as ivory. Near the
  fire sat Lygia with a string of small fish, intended evidently for supper.
  Occupied in removing the fish from the string, and thinking that it was Ursus
  who had entered, she did not raise her eyes. But Vinicius approached, and,
  pronouncing her name, stretched his hand to her. She sprang up quickly then;
  a flash of astonishment and delight shot across her face. Without a word,
  like a child who after days of fear and sorrow had found father or mother,
  she threw herself into his open arms.</p>

  <p>He embraced her, pressed her to his bosom for some time with such ecstasy
  as if she had been saved by a miracle. Then, withdrawing his arms, he took
  her temples between his hands, kissed her forehead and her eyes, embraced her
  again, repeated her name, bent to her knees, to her palms, greeted her, did
  her homage, honored her. His delight had no bounds; neither had his love and
  happiness.</p>

  <p>At last he told her how he had rushed in from Antium; had searched for her
  at the walls, in the smoke at the house of Linus; how he had suffered and was
  terrified; how much he had endured before the Apostle had shown him her
  retreat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I have found thee, I will not
  leave thee near fire and raging crowds. People are slaying one another under
  the walls, slaves are revolting and plundering. God alone knows what miseries
  may fall yet on Rome. But I will save thee and all of you. Oh, my dear, let
  us go to Antium; we will take a ship there and sail to Sicily. My land is thy
  land, my houses are thy houses. Listen to me! In Sicily we shall find Aulus.
  I will give thee back to Pomponia, and take thee from her hands afterward.
  But, O carissima, have no further fear of me. Christ has not washed me yet,
  but ask Peter if on the way hither I have not told him my wish to be a real
  confessor of Christ, and begged him to baptize me, even in this hut of a
  quarryman. Believe, and let all believe me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lygia heard these words with radiant face. The Christians formerly,
  because of Jewish persecutions, and then because of the fire and disturbance
  caused by the disaster, lived in fear and uncertainty. A journey to quiet
  Sicily would put an end to all danger, and open a new epoch of happiness in
  their lives. If Vinicius had wished to take only Lygia, she would have
  resisted the temptation surely, as she did not wish to leave Peter and Linus;
  but Vinicius said to them, &ldquo;Come with me; my lands are your lands, my
  houses your houses.&rdquo; At this Lygia inclined to kiss his hand, in sign
  of obedience, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where thou art, Caius, there am I, Caia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then confused that she had spoken words which by Roman custom were
  repeated only at marriage, she blushed deeply, and stood in the light of the
  fire, with drooping head, in doubt lest he might take them ill of her. But in
  his face boundless homage alone was depicted. He turned then to Peter, and
  continued,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rome is burning at command of Cæsar. In Antium he complained that
  he had never seen a great fire. And if he has not hesitated at such a crime,
  think what may happen yet. Who knows that he may not bring in troops, and
  command a slaughter? Who knows what proscriptions may come; who knows whether
  after the fire, civil war, murder, and famine may not come?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hide yourselves, therefore, and let us hide Lygia. There ye can
  wait till the storm passes, and when it is over return to sow your grain
  anew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Outside, from the direction of the Vatican Field, as if to confirm his
  fears, distant cries were heard full of rage and terror. At that moment the
  quarryman entered, the master of the hut, and, shutting the door hastily, he
  cried,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People are killing one another near the Circus of Nero. Slaves and
  gladiators have attacked the citizens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do ye hear?&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The measure is full,&rdquo; said the Apostle; &ldquo;and disasters
  will come, like a boundless sea.&rdquo; Then he turned, and, pointing to
  Lygia, said, &ldquo;Take the maiden, whom God has predestined to thee, and
  save her, and let Linus, who is sick, and Ursus go with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius, who had come to love the Apostle with all the power of his
  impetuous soul, exclaimed: &ldquo;I swear, my teacher, that I will not leave
  thee here to destruction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Lord bless thee for thy wish,&rdquo; answered Peter; &ldquo;but
  hast thou not heard that Christ repeated thrice on the lake to me,
  &rsquo;Feed my lambs&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thou, to whom no one has confided care over me, sayest that thou
  wilt not leave me to destruction, how canst thou wish me to leave my flock in
  the day of disaster? When there was a storm on the lake, and we were
  terrified in heart, He did not desert us; why should I, a servant, not follow
  my Master&rsquo;s example?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Linus raised his emaciated face and inquired,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O viceregent of the Lord, why should I not follow thy
  example?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius began to pass his hand over his head, as if struggling with
  himself or fighting with his thoughts; then, seizing Lygia by the hand, he
  said, in a voice in which the energy of a Roman soldier was
  quivering,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear me, Peter, Linus, and thou, Lygia! I spoke as my human reason
  dictated; but ye have another reason, which regards, not your own danger, but
  the commands of the Redeemer. True, I did not understand this, and I erred,
  for the beam is not taken from my eyes yet, and the former nature is heard in
  me. But since I love Christ, and wish to be His servant, though it is a
  question for me of something more than my own life, I kneel here before thee,
  and swear that I will accomplish the command of love, and will not leave my
  brethren in the day of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he knelt, and enthusiasm possessed him; raising his hands and eyes,
  he cried: &ldquo;Do I understand Thee, O Christ? Am I worthy of
  Thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His hands trembled; his eyes glistened with tears; his body trembled with
  faith and love. Peter took an earthen vessel with water, and, bringing it
  near him, said with solemnity,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behold, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
  Ghost. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then a religious ecstasy seized all present. They thought that some light
  from beyond this world had filled the hut, that they heard some superhuman
  music, that the cliffs had opened above their heads, that choirs of angels
  were floating down from heaven, and far up there they saw a cross, and
  pierced hands blessing them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the shouts of fighting were heard outside, and the roar of
  flames in the burning city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48">CHAPTER XLVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CAMPS of people were disposed in the lordly gardens of
  Cæsar, formerly gardens of Domitius and Agrippina; they were disposed also on
  the Campus Martius, in the gardens of Pompey, Sallust, and Mæcenas, in
  porticos, tennis-courts, splendid summer-houses, and buildings erected for
  wild beasts. Peacocks, flamingoes, swans, ostriches, gazelles, African
  antelopes, and deer, which had served as ornaments to those gardens, went
  under the knives of the rabble. Provisions began to come in now from Ostria
  so abundantly that one might walk, as on a bridge, over ships, boats, and
  barges from one bank of the Tiber to the other. Wheat was sold at the
  unheard-of low price of three sestertia, and was given gratis to the
  indigent. Immense supplies of wine, olives, and chestnuts were brought to the
  city; sheep and cattle were driven in every day from the mountains. Wretches
  who before the fire had been hiding in alleys of the Subura, and were
  perishing of hunger in ordinary times, had a more pleasant life now. The
  danger of famine was averted completely, but it was more difficult to
  suppress robbery, murder, and abuses. A nomadic life insured impunity to
  thieves; the more easily since they proclaimed themselves admirers of Cæsar,
  and were unsparing of plaudits wherever he appeared. Moreover, when, by the
  pressure of events, the authorities were in abeyance, and there was a lack of
  armed force to quell insolence in a city inhabited by the dregs of
  contemporary mankind, deeds were done which passed human imagination. Every
  night there were battles and murders; every night boys and women were
  snatched away. At the Porta Mugionis, where there was a halting-place for
  herds driven in from the Campania, it come to engagements in which people
  perished by hundreds. Every morning the banks of the Tiber were covered with
  drowned bodies, which no one collected; these decayed quickly because of heat
  heightened by fire, and filled the air with foul odors. Sickness broke out on
  the camping-grounds, and the more timorous foresaw a great pestilence.</p>

  <p>But the city burned on unceasingly. Only on the sixth day, when the fire
  reached empty spaces on the Esquiline, where an enormous number of houses had
  been demolished purposely, did it weaken. But the piles of burning cinders
  gave such strong light yet that people would not believe that the end of the
  catastrophe had come. In fact the fire burst forth with fresh force on the
  seventh night in the buildings of Tigellinus, but had short duration for lack
  of fuel. Burnt houses, however, fell here and there, and threw up towers of
  flame and pillars of sparks. But the glowing ruins began to grow black on the
  surface. After sunset the heavens ceased to gleam with bloody light, and only
  after dark did blue tongues quiver above the extended black waste, tongues
  which rose from piles of cinders.</p>

  <p>Of the fourteen divisions of Rome there remained only four, including the
  Trans-Tiber. Flames had consumed all the others. When at last the piles of
  cinders had been turned into ashes, an immense space was visible from the
  Tiber to the Esquiline, gray, gloomy, dead. In this space stood rows of
  chimneys, like columns over graves in a cemetery. Among these columns gloomy
  crowds of people moved about in the daytime, some seeking for precious
  objects, others for the bones of those dear to them. In the night dogs howled
  above the ashes and ruins of former dwellings.</p>

  <p>All the bounty and aid shown by Cæsar to the populace did not restrain
  evil speech and indignation. Only the herd of robbers, criminals, and
  homeless ruffians, who could eat, drink, and rob enough, were contented.
  People who had lost all their property and their nearest relatives were not
  won over by the opening of gardens, the distribution of bread, or the promise
  of games and gifts. The catastrophe had been too great and unparalleled.
  Others, in whom was hidden yet some spark of love for the city and their
  birthplace, were brought to despair by news that the old name
  &ldquo;Roma&rdquo; was to vanish, and that from the ashes of the capital
  Cæsar would erect a new city called Neropolis. A flood of hatred rose and
  swelled every day, despite the flatteries of the Augustians and the calumnies
  of Tigellinus. Nero, more sensitive than any former Cæsar to the favor of the
  populace, thought with alarm that in the sullen and mortal struggle which he
  was waging with patricians in the Senate, he might lack support. The
  Augustians themselves were not less alarmed, for any morning might bring them
  destruction. Tigellinus thought of summoning certain legions from Asia Minor.
  Vatinius, who laughed even when slapped on the face, lost his humor; Vitelius
  lost his appetite.</p>

  <p>Others were taking counsel among themselves how to avert the danger, for
  it was no secret that were an outburst to carry off Cæsar, not one of the
  Augustians would escape, except, perhaps, Petronius. To their influence were
  ascribed the madnesses of Nero, to their suggestions all the crimes which he
  committed. Hatred for them almost surpassed that for Nero. Hence some began
  to make efforts to rid themselves of responsibility for the burning of the
  city. But to free themselves they must clear Cæsar also from suspicion, or no
  one would believe that they had not caused the catastrophe. Tigellinus took
  counsel on this subject with Domitius Afer, and even with Seneca, though he
  hated him. Poppæa, who understood that the ruin of Nero would be her own
  sentence, took the opinion of her confidants and of Hebrew priests, for it
  had been admitted for years that she held the faith of Jehovah. Nero found
  his own methods, which, frequently terrible, were more frequently foolish,
  and fell now into terror, now into childish delight, but above all he
  complained.</p>

  <p>On a time a long and fruitless consultation was held in the house of
  Tiberius, which had survived the fire. Petronius thought it best to leave
  troubles, go to Greece, thence to Egypt and Asia Minor. The journey had been
  planned long before; why defer it, when in Rome were sadness and danger?</p>

  <p>Cæsar accepted the counsel with eagerness; but Seneca when he had thought
  awhile, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is easy to go, but it would be more difficult to
  return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Heracles!&rdquo; replied Petronius, &ldquo;we may return at the
  head of Asiatic legions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This will I do!&rdquo; exclaimed Nero.</p>

  <p>But Tigellinus opposed. He could discover nothing himself, and if the
  arbiter&rsquo;s idea had come to his own head he would beyond doubt have
  declared it the saving one; but with him the question was that Petronius
  might not be a second time the only man who in difficult moments could rescue
  all and every one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear me, divinity,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this advice is
  destructive! Before thou art at Ostia a civil war will break out; who knows
  but one of the surviving collateral descendants of the divine Augustus will
  declare himself Cæsar, and what shall we do if the legions take his
  side?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall try,&rdquo; answered Nero, &ldquo;that there be no
  descendants of Augustus. There are not many now; hence it is easy to rid
  ourselves of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is possible to do so, but is it a question of them alone? No
  longer ago than yesterday my people heard in the crowd that a man like
  Thrasea should be Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero bit his lips. After a while he raised his eyes and said:
  &ldquo;Insatiable and thankless. They have grain enough, and they have coal
  on which to bake cakes; what more do they want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vengeance!&rdquo; replied Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>Silence followed. Cæsar rose on a sudden, extended his hand, and began to
  declaim,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hearts call for vengeance, and vengeance wants a victim.&rdquo;
  Then, forgetting everything, he said, with radiant face: &ldquo;Give me the
  tablet and stilus to write this line. Never could Lucan have composed the
  like. Have ye noticed that I found it in a twinkle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O incomparable!&rdquo; exclaimed a number of voices. Nero wrote
  down the line, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, vengeance wants a victim.&rdquo; Then he cast a glance on
  those around him. &ldquo;But if we spread the report that Vatinius gave
  command to burn the city, and devote him to the anger of the
  people?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O divinity! Who am I?&rdquo; exclaimed Vatmius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True! One more important than thou is demanded. Is it
  Vitelius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vitelius grew pale, but began to laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My fat,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;might start the fire
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Nero had something else on his mind; in his soul he was looking for a
  victim who might really satisfy the people&rsquo;s anger, and he found
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tigellinus,&rdquo; said he after a while, &ldquo;it was thou who
  didst burn Rome!&rdquo; A shiver ran through those present. They understood
  that Cæsar had ceased to jest this time, and that a moment had come which was
  pregnant with events.</p>

  <p>The face of Tigellinus was wrinkled, like the lips of a dog about to
  bite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I burnt Rome at thy command!&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>And the two glared at each other like a pair of devils. Such silence
  followed that the buzzing of flies was heard as they flew through the
  atrium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tigellinus,&rdquo; said Nero, &ldquo;dost thou love me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou knowest, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sacrifice thyself for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O divine Cæsar,&rdquo; answered Tigellinus, &ldquo;why present the
  sweet cup which I may not raise to my lips? The people are muttering and
  rising; dost thou wish the pretorians also to rise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A feeling of terror pressed the hearts of those present. Tigellinus was
  pretorian prefect, and his words had the direct meaning of a threat. Nero
  himself understood this, and his face became pallid.</p>

  <p>At that moment Epaphroditus, Cæsar&rsquo;s freedman, entered, announcing
  that the divine Augusta wished to see Tigellinus, as there were people in her
  apartments whom the prefect ought to hear.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus bowed to Cæsar, and went out with a face calm and contemptuous.
  Now, when they had wished to strike him, he had shown his teeth; he had made
  them understand who he was, and, knowing Nero&rsquo;s cowardice, he was
  confident that that ruler of the world would never dare to raise a hand
  against him.</p>

  <p>Nero sat in silence for a moment; then, seeing that those present expected
  some answer, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have reared a serpent in my bosom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius shrugged his shoulders, as if to say that it was not difficult
  to pluck the head from such a serpent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What wilt thou say? Speak, advise!&rdquo; exclaimed Nero, noticing
  this motion. &ldquo;I trust in thee alone, for thou hast more sense than all
  of them, and thou lovest me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius had the following on his lips: &ldquo;Make me pretorian prefect,
  I will deliver Tigellinus to the people, and pacify the city in a day.&rdquo;
  But his innate slothfulness prevailed. To be prefect meant to bear on his
  shoulder&rsquo;s Cæsar&rsquo;s person and also thousands of public affairs.
  And why should he perform that labor? Was it not better to read poetry in his
  splendid library, look at vases and statues, or hold to his breast the divine
  body of Eunice, twining her golden hair through his fingers, and inclining
  his lips to her coral mouth? Hence he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I advise the journey to Achæa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; answered Nero, &ldquo;I looked for something more from
  thee. The Senate hates me. If I depart, who will guarantee that it will not
  revolt and proclaim some one else Cæsar? The people have been faithful to me
  so far, but now they will follow the Senate. By Hades! if that Senate and
  that people had one head!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Permit me to say, O divinity, that if thou desire to save Rome,
  there is need to save even a few Romans,&rdquo; remarked Petronius, with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What care I for Rome and Romans?&rdquo; complained Nero. &ldquo;I
  should be obeyed in Achæa. Here only treason surrounds me. All desert me, and
  ye are making ready for treason. I know it, I know it. Ye do not even imagine
  what future ages will say of you if ye desert such an artist as I
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he tapped his forehead on a sudden, and cried,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True! Amid these cares even I forget who I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Petronius with a radiant face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the people murmur; but if I take
  my lute and go to the Campus Martius, if I sing that song to them which I
  sang during the conflagration, dost thou not think that I will move them, as
  Orpheus moved wild beasts?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To this Tullius Senecio, who was impatient to return to his slave women
  brought in from Antium, and who had been impatient a long time,
  replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beyond doubt, O Cæsar, if they permit thee to begin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go to Hellas!&rdquo; cried Nero, with disgust.</p>

  <p>But at that moment Poppæa appeared, and with her Tigellinis. The eyes of
  those present turned to him unconsciously, for never had triumphator ascended
  the Capitol with pride such as his when he stood before Cæsar. He began to
  speak slowly and with emphasis, in tones through which the bite of iron, as
  it were, was heard,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen. O Cæsar, for I can say: I have found! The people want
  vengeance, they want not one victim, but hundreds, thousands. Hast heard,
  lord, who Christos was,&mdash;he who was crucified by Pontius Pilate? And
  knowest thou who the Christians are? Have I not told thee of their crimes and
  foul ceremonies, of their predictions that fire would cause the end of the
  world? People hate and suspect them. No one has seen them in a temple at any
  time, for they consider our gods evil spirits; they are not in the Stadium,
  for they despise horse races. Never have the hands of a Christian done thee
  honor with plaudits. Never has one of them recognized thee as god. They are
  enemies of the human race, of the city, and of thee. The people murmur
  against thee; but thou hast given me no command to burn Rome, and I did not
  burn it. The people want vengeance; let them have it. The people want blood
  and games; let them have them. The people suspect thee; let their suspicion
  turn in another direction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero listened with amazement at first; but as Tigellinus proceeded, his
  actor&rsquo;s face changed, and assumed in succession expressions of anger,
  sorrow, sympathy, indignation. Suddenly he rose, and, casting off the toga,
  which dropped at his feet, he raised both hands and stood silent for a time.
  At last he said, in the tones of a tragedian,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Zeus, Apollo, Here, Athene, Persephone, and all ye immortals! why
  did ye not come to aid us? What has this hapless city done to those cruel
  wretches that they burnt it so inhumanly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are enemies of mankind and of thee,&rdquo; said Poppæa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do justice!&rdquo; cried others. &ldquo;Punish the incendiaries!
  The gods themselves call for vengeance!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero sat down, dropped his head to his breast, and was silent a second
  time, as if stunned by the wickedness of which he had heard. But after a
  while he shook his hands, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What punishments, what tortures befit such a crime? But the gods
  will inspire me, and, aided by the powers of Tartarus, I will give my poor
  people such a spectacle that they will remember me for ages with
  gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The forehead of Petronius was covered with a sudden cloud. He thought of
  the danger hanging over Lygia and over Vinicius, whom he loved, and over all
  those people whose religion he rejected, but of whose innocence he was
  certain. He thought also that one of those bloody orgies would begin which
  his eyes, those of an æsthetic man, could not suffer. But above all he
  thought: &ldquo;I must save Vinicius, who will go mad if that maiden
  perishes&rdquo;; and this consideration outweighed every other, for Petronius
  understood well that he was beginning a game far more perilous than any in
  his life. He began, however, to speak freely and carelessly, as his wont was
  when criticising or ridiculing plans of Cæsar and the Augustians that were
  not sufficiently æsthetic,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye have found victims! That is true. Ye may send them to the arena,
  or array them in &lsquo;painful tunics.&rsquo; That is true also. But hear
  me! Ye have authority, ye have pretorians, ye have power; then be sincere, at
  least, when no one is listening! Deceive the people, but deceive not one
  another. Give the Christians to the populace, condemn them to any torture ye
  like; but have courage to say to yourselves that it was not they who burnt
  Rome. Phy! Ye call me &lsquo;arbiter elegantiarum&rsquo;; hence I declare to
  you that I cannot endure wretched comedies! Phy! how all this reminds me of
  the theatrical booths near the Porta Asinaria, in which actors play the parts
  of gods and kings to amuse the suburban rabble, and when the play is over
  wash down onions with sour wine, or get blows of clubs! Be gods and kings in
  reality; for I say that ye can permit yourselves the position! As to thee, O
  Cæsar, thou hast threatened us with the sentence of coming ages; but think,
  those ages will utter judgment concerning thee also. By the divine Clio!
  Nero, ruler of the world, Nero, a god, burnt Rome, because he was as powerful
  on earth as Zeus on Olympus,&mdash;Nero the poet loved poetry so much that he
  sacrificed to it his country! From the beginning of the world no one did the
  like, no one ventured on the like. I beseech thee in the name of the
  double-crowned Libethrides, renounce not such glory, for songs of thee will
  sound to the end of ages! What will Priam be when compared with thee; what
  Agamenmon; what Achilles; what the gods themselves? We need not say that the
  burning of Rome was good, but it was colossal and uncommon. I tell thee,
  besides, that the people will raise no hand against thee! It is not true that
  they will. Have courage; guard thyself against acts unworthy of
  thee,&mdash;for this alone threatens thee, that future ages may say,
  &rsquo;Nero burned Rome; but as a timid Cæsar and a timid poet he denied the
  great deed out of fear, and cast the blame of it on the
  innocent!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The arbiter&rsquo;s words produced the usual deep impression on Nero; but
  Petronius was not deceived as to this, that what he had said was a desperate
  means which in a fortunate event might save the Christians, it is true, but
  might still more easily destroy himself. He had not hesitated, however, for
  it was a question at once of Vinicius whom he loved, and of hazard with which
  he amused himself. &ldquo;The dice are thrown,&rdquo; said he to himself,
  &ldquo;and we shall see how far fear for his own life outweighs in the monkey
  his love of glory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And in his soul he had no doubt that fear would outweigh.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile silence fell after his words. Poppæa and all present were
  looking at Nero&rsquo;s eyes as at a rainbow. He began to raise his lips,
  drawing them to his very nostrils, as was his custom when he knew not what to
  do; at last disgust and trouble were evident on his features.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; cried Tigellinus, on noting this, &ldquo;permit me to
  go; for when people wish to expose thy person to destruction, and call thee,
  besides, a cowardly Cæsar, a cowardly poet, an incendiary, and a comedian, my
  ears cannot suffer such expressions!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have lost,&rdquo; thought Petronius. But turning to Tigellinus,
  he measured him with a glance in which was that contempt for a ruffian which
  is felt by a great lord who is an exquisite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tigellinus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was thou whom I called a
  comedian; for thou art one at this very moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it because I will not listen to thy insults?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is because thou art feigning boundless love for
  Cæsar,&mdash;thou who a short while since wert threatening him with
  pretorians, which we all understood as did he!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus, who had not thought Petronius sufficiently daring to throw
  dice such as those on the table, turned pale, lost his head, and was
  speechless. This was, however, the last victory of the arbiter over his
  rival, for that moment Poppæa said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, how permit that such a thought should even pass through the
  head of any one, and all the more that any one should venture to express it
  aloud in thy presence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Punish the insolent!&rdquo; exclaimed Vitelius.</p>

  <p>Nero raised his lips again to his nostrils, and, turning his near-
  sighted, glassy eyes on Petronius, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this the way thou payest me for the friendship which I had for
  thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I am mistaken, show me my error,&rdquo; said Petronius;
  &ldquo;but know that I speak that which love for thee dictates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Punish the insolent!&rdquo; repeated Vitelius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Punish!&rdquo; called a number of voices.</p>

  <p>In the atrium there was a murmur and a movement, for people began to
  withdraw from Petronius. Even Tullius Senecio, his constant companion at the
  court, pushed away, as did young Nerva, who had shown him hitherto the
  greatest friendship. After a while Petronius was alone on the left side of
  the atrium, with a smile on his lips; and gathering with his hands the folds
  of his toga, he waited yet for what Cæsar would say or do.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye wish me to punish him&rdquo; said Cæsar; &ldquo;but he is my
  friend and comrade. Though he has wounded my heart, let him know that for
  friends this heart has naught but forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have lost, and am ruined,&rdquo; thought Petronius.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cæsar rose, and the consultation was ended.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49">CHAPTER XLIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Petronius went home. Nero and Tigellinus went to
  Poppæa&rsquo;s atrium, where they were expected by people with whom the
  prefect had spoken already.</p>

  <p>There were two Trans-Tiber rabbis in long solemn robes and mitred, a young
  copyist, their assistant, together with Chilo. At sight of Cæsar the priests
  grew pale from emotion, and, raising their hands an arm&rsquo;s length, bent
  their heads to his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be greeted, O ruler of the earth, guardian of the chosen people,
  and Cæsar, lion among men, whose reign is like sunlight, like the cedar of
  Lebanon, like a spring, like a palm, like the balsam of Jericho.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do ye refuse to call me god?&rdquo; inquired Nero.</p>

  <p>The priests grew still paler. The chief one spoke again,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy words, O lord, are as sweet as a cluster of grapes, as a ripe
  fig,&mdash;for Jehovah filled thy heart with goodness! Thy father&rsquo;s
  predecessor, Cæsar Caius, was stern; still our envoys did not call him god,
  preferring death itself to violation of the law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And did not Caligula give command to throw them to the
  lions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord; Cæsar Caius feared Jehovah&rsquo;s anger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And they raised their heads, for the name of the powerful Jehovah gave
  them courage; confident in his might, they looked into Nero&rsquo;s eyes with
  more boldness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do ye accuse the Christians of burning Rome?&rdquo; inquired Cæsar.
  &ldquo;We, lord, accuse them of this alone,&mdash;that they are enemies of
  the law, of the human race, of Rome, and of thee; that long since they have
  threatened the city and the world with fire! The rest will be told thee by
  this man, whose lips are unstained by a lie, for in his mother&rsquo;s veins
  flowed the blood of the chosen people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero turned to Chilo: &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One who honors thee, O Cyrus; and, besides, a poor
  Stoic-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate the Stoics,&rdquo; said Nero. &ldquo;I hate Thrasea; I hate
  Musonius and Cornutus. Their speech is repulsive to me; their contempt for
  art, their voluntary squalor and filth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O lord, thy master Seneca has one thousand tables of citrus wood.
  At thy wish I will have twice as many. I am a Stoic from necessity. Dress my
  stoicism, O Radiant One, in a garland of roses, put a pitcher of wine before
  it; it will sing Anacreon in such strains as to deafen every
  Epicurean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero, who was pleased by the title &ldquo;Radiant,&rdquo; smiled and
  said,-"Thou dost please me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This man is worth his weight in gold!&rdquo; cried Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put thy liberality with my weight,&rdquo; answered Chilo, &ldquo;or
  the wind will blow my reward away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He would not outweigh Vitelius,&rdquo; put in Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eheu! Silver-bowed, my wit is not of lead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see that thy faith does not hinder thee from calling me a
  god.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Immortal! My faith is in thee; the Christians blaspheme against
  that faith, and I hate them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou know of the Christians?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wilt thou permit me to weep, O divinity?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Nero; &ldquo;weeping annoys me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art triply right, for eyes that have seen thee should be free
  of tears forever. O lord, defend me against my enemies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak of the Christians,&rdquo; said Poppæa, with a shade of
  impatience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will be at thy command, O Isis,&rdquo; answered Chilo.
  &ldquo;From youth I devoted myself to philosophy, and sought truth. I sought
  it among the ancient divine sages, in the Academy at Athens, and in the
  Serapeum at Alexandria. When I heard of the Christians, I judged that they
  formed some new school in which I could find certain kernels of truth; and to
  my misfortune I made their acquaintance. The first Christian whom evil fate
  brought near me was one Glaucus, a physician of Naples. From him I learned in
  time that they worship a certain Chrestos, who promised to exterminate all
  people and destroy every city on earth, but to spare them if they helped him
  to exterminate the children of Deucalion. For this reason, O lady, they hate
  men, and poison fountains; for this reason in their assemblies they shower
  curses on Rome, and on all temples in which our gods are honored. Chrestos
  was crucified; but he promised that when Rome was destroyed by fire, he would
  come again and give Christians dominion over the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People will understand now why Rome was destroyed,&rdquo;
  interrupted Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many understand that already, O lord, for I go about in the
  gardens, I go to the Campus Martius, and teach. But if ye listen to the end,
  ye will know my reasons for vengeance. Glaucus the physician did not reveal
  to me at first that their religion taught hatred. On the contrary, he told me
  that Chrestos was a good divinity, that the basis of their religion was love.
  My sensitive heart could not resist such a truth; hence I took to loving
  Glaucus, I trusted him, I shared every morsel of bread with him, every copper
  coin, and dost thou know, lady, how he repaid me? On the road from Naples to
  Rome he thrust a knife into my body, and my wife, the beautiful and youthful
  Berenice, he sold to a slave-merchant. If Sophocles knew my history&mdash;but
  what do I say? One better than Sophocles is listening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said Poppæa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whoso has seen the face of Aphrodite is not poor, lady; and I see
  it at this moment. But then I sought consolation in philosophy. When I came
  to Rome, I tried to meet Christian elders to obtain justice against Glaucus.
  I thought that they would force him to yield up my wife. I became acquainted
  with their chief priest; I became acquainted with another, named Paul, who
  was in prison in this city, but was liberated afterward; I became acquainted
  with the son of Zebedee, with Linus and Clitus and many others. I know where
  they lived before the fire, I know where they meet. I can point out one
  excavation in the Vatican Hill and a cemetery beyond the Nomentan Gate, where
  they celebrate their shameless ceremonies. I saw the Apostle Peter. I saw how
  Glaucus killed children, so that the Apostle might have something to sprinkle
  on the heads of those present; and I saw Lygia, the foster-child of Pomponia
  Græcina, who boasted that though unable to bring the blood of an infant, she
  brought the death of an infant, for she bewitched the little Augusta, thy
  daughter, O Cyrus, and thine, O Isis!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear, Cæsar?&rdquo; asked Poppæa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can that be!&rdquo; exclaimed Nero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could forgive wrongs done myself,&rdquo; continued Chilo,
  &ldquo;but when I heard of yours, I wanted to stab her. Unfortunately I was
  stopped by the noble Vinicius, who loves her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius? But did she not flee from him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She fled, but he made search for her; he could not exist without
  her. For wretched pay I helped him in the search, and it was I who pointed
  out to him the house in which she lived among the Christians in the
  Trans-Tiber. We went there together, and with us thy wrestler Croton, whom
  the noble Vinicius hired to protect him. But Ursus, Lygia&rsquo;s slave,
  crushed Croton. That is a man of dreadful strength, O Lord, who can break a
  bull&rsquo;s neck as easily as another might a poppy stalk. Aulus and
  Pomponia loved him because of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Hercules,&rdquo; said Nero, &ldquo;the mortal who crushed Croton
  deserves a statue in the Forum. But, old man, thou art mistaken or art
  inventing, for Vinicius killed Croton with a knife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is how people calumniate the gods. O lord, I myself saw
  Croton&rsquo;s ribs breaking in the arms of Ursus, who rushed then on
  Vinicius and would have killed him but for Lygia. Vinicius was ill for a long
  time after that but they nursed him in the hope that through love he would
  become a Christian. In fact, he did become a Christian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And, perhaps, Petronius too?&rdquo; inquired Tigellinus,
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Chilo squirmed, rubbed his hands, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I admire thy penetration, O lord. He may have become one! He may
  very well have become one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I understand why he defended the Christians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero laughed: &ldquo;Petronius a Christian! Petronius an enemy of life and
  luxury! Be not foolish; do not ask me to believe that, since I am ready not
  to believe anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the noble Vinicius became a Christian, lord. I swear by that
  radiance which comes from thee that I speak the truth, and that nothing
  pierces me with such disgust as lying. Pomponia Græcina is a Christian,
  little Aulus is a Christian, Lygia is a Christian, and so is Vinicius. I
  served him faithfully, and in return, at the desire of Glaucus the physician,
  he gave command to flog me, though I am old and was sick and hungry. And I
  have sworn by Hades that I will not forget that for him. O lord, avenge my
  wrongs on them, and I will deliver to thee Peter the Apostle and Linus and
  Clitus and Glaucus and Crispus, the highest ones, and Lygia and Ursus. I will
  point out hundreds of them to you, thousands; I will indicate their houses of
  prayer, the cemeteries, all thy prisons will not hold them! Without me ye
  could not find them. In misfortunes I have sought consolation; hitherto in
  philosophy alone, now I will find it in favors that will descend on me. I am
  old, and have not known life; let me begin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is thy wish to be a Stoic before a full plate,&rdquo; said
  Nero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whoso renders service to thee will fill it by that same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art not mistaken, O philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Poppæa did not forget her enemies. Her fancy for Vinicius was, indeed,
  rather a momentary whim, which had risen under the influence of jealousy,
  anger, and wounded vanity. Still the coolness of the young patrician touched
  her deeply, and filled her heart with a stubborn feeling of offence. This
  alone, that he had dared to prefer another, seemed to her a crime calling for
  vengeance. As to Lygia, she hated her from the first moment, when the beauty
  of that northern lily alarmed her. Petronius, who spoke of the too narrow
  hips of the girl, might talk what he pleased into Cæsar, but not into the
  Augusta. Poppæa the critic understood at one cast of the eye that in all Rome
  Lygia alone could rival and even surpass her. Thenceforth she vowed her
  ruin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;avenge our child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hasten!&rdquo; cried Chilo, &ldquo;hasten! Otherwise Vinicius will
  hide her. I will point out the house to which she returned after the
  fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will give thee ten men, and go this moment,&rdquo; said
  Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O lord! thou hast not seen Croton in the arms of Ursus; if thou
  wilt give fifty men, I will only show the house from a distance. But if ye
  will not imprison Vinicius, I am lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus looked at Nero. &ldquo;Would it not be well, O divinity, to
  finish at once with the uncle and nephew?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero thought a moment and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not now. People would not believe us if we tried to persuade
  them that Petronius, Vinicius, or Pomponia Græcina had fired Rome. Their
  houses were too beautiful. Their turn will come later; to-day other victims
  are needed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, O lord, give me soldiers as a guard,&rdquo; said Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See to this, Tigellinus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt lodge meanwhile with me,&rdquo; said the prefect to
  Chilo.</p>

  <p>Delight beamed from the face of the Greek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will give up all! only hasten!&mdash;hasten!&rdquo; cried he,
  with a hoarse voice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50">CHAPTER L</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On leaving Cæsar, Petronius had himself borne to his house
  on the Carinæ, which, being surrounded on three sides by a garden, and having
  in front the small Cecilian Forum, escaped the fire luckily. For this cause
  other Augustians, who had lost their houses and in them vast wealth and many
  works of art, called Petronius fortunate. For years it had been repeated that
  he was the first-born of Fortune, and Cæsar&rsquo;s growing friendship in
  recent times seemed to confirm the correctness of this statement.</p>

  <p>But that first-born of Fortune might meditate now on the fickleness of his
  mother, or rather on her likeness to Chronos, who devoured his own
  children.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were my house burnt,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;and with it
  my gems, Etruscan vases, Alexandrian glass, and Corinthian bronze, Nero might
  indeed have forgotten the offence. By Pollux! And to think that it depended
  on me alone to be pretorian prefect at this moment. I should proclaim
  Tigellinus the incendiary, which he is really; I should array him in the
  &lsquo;painful tunic,&rsquo; and deliver him to the populace, protect the
  Christians, rebuild Rome. Who knows even if a better epoch would not begin
  thus for honest people? I ought to have taken the office, simply out of
  regard for Vinicius. In case of overwork I could have surrendered command to
  him, and Nero would not have even tried to resist. Then let Vinicius baptize
  all the pretorians, nay, Cæsar himself; what harm could that be to me? Nero
  pious, Nero virtuous and merciful,&mdash;this would be even an amusing
  spectacle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And his carelessness was so great that he began to laugh. But after a time
  his thoughts turned in another direction. It seemed to him that he was in
  Antium; that Paul of Tarsus was saying to him, &ldquo;Ye call us enemies of
  life, but answer me, Petronius: If Cæsar were a Christian, and acted
  according to our religion, would not life be safer and more
  certain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And remembering these words, he continued: &ldquo;By Castor! No matter how
  many Christians they murder here, Paul will find as many new ones; for he is
  right, unless the world can rest on scoundrelism. But who knows that this
  will not be the case soon? I myself, who have learned not a little, did not
  learn how to be a great enough scoundrel; hence I shall have to open my
  veins. But in every case it must have ended thus, and if not thus, in some
  other way. I am sorry for Eunice and my Myrrhene vase; but Eunice is free,
  and the vase will go with me. Ahenobarbus will not get it, in any event! I am
  sorry also for Vinicius. But, though I was bored less of late than before, I
  am ready. In the world things are beautiful; but people are so vile for the
  greater part that life is not worth a regret. He who knew how to live should
  know how to die. Though I belong to the Augustians, I was freer than they
  supposed.&rdquo; Here he shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;They may think that
  my knees are trembling at this moment, and that terror has raised the hair on
  my head; but on reaching home, I will take a bath in violet water, my
  golden-haired herself will anoint me; then after refreshment we will have
  sung to us that hymn to Apollo composed by Anthemios. I said once to myself
  that it was not worth while to think of death, for death thinks of us without
  our assistance. It would be a wonder if there are really Elysian fields, and
  in them shades of people. Eunice would come in time to me, and we should
  wander together over asphodel meadows. I should find, too, society better
  than this. What buffoons, tricksters, a vile herd without taste or polish!
  Tens of Arbiters Elegantiarum could not transform those Trimalchilons into
  decent people. By Persephone! I have had enough!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he noted with astonishment that something separated him from those
  people already. He had known them well earlier, and had known what to think
  of them; still they seemed to him now as farther away and more deserving of
  contempt than usual. Indeed, he had had enough of them!</p>

  <p>But afterward he began to think over his position. Thanks to his
  acuteness, he knew that destruction was not threatening him directly. Nero
  had seized an appropriate occasion to utter a few select, lofty phrases about
  friendship and forgiveness, thus binding himself for the moment. &ldquo;He
  will have to seek pretexts, and before he finds them much time may pass.
  First of all, he will celebrate the games with Christians,&rdquo; said
  Petronius to himself; &ldquo;only then will he think of me, and if that be
  true, it is not worth while to take trouble or change my course of life.
  Nearer danger threatens Vinicius!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And thenceforth he thought only of Vinicius, whom he resolved to rescue.
  Four sturdy Bithynians bore his litter quickly through ruins, ash-heaps, and
  stones with which the Carinæ was filled yet; but he commanded them to run
  swiftly so as to be home at the earliest. Vinicius, whose
  &ldquo;insula&rdquo; had been burned, was living with him, and was at home,
  fortunately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast seen Lygia to-day?&rdquo; were the first words of
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have just come from her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear what I tell thee, and lose no time in questions. It has been
  decided this morning at Cæsar&rsquo;s to lay the blame of burning Rome on the
  Christians. Persecutions and tortures threaten them. Pursuit may begin any
  instant. Take Lygia and flee at once beyond the Alps even, or to Africa. And
  hasten, for the Palatine is nearer the Trans-Tiber than is this
  place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was, indeed, too much of a soldier to lose time in useless
  queries. He listened with frowning brows, and a face intent and terrible, but
  fearless. Evidently the first feeling of his nature in presence of peril was
  a wish to defend and give battle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One word more. Take a purse of gold, take weapons, and a handful of
  thy Christians. In case of need, rescue her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was in the door of the atrium already.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send me news by a slave!&rdquo; cried Petronius.</p>

  <p>When left alone, he began to walk by the columns which adorned the atrium,
  thinking of what had happened. He knew that Lygia and Linus had returned
  after the fire to the former house, which, like the greater part of the
  Trans-Tiber, had been saved; and that was an unfavorable circumstance, for
  otherwise it would have been difficult to find them among throngs of people.
  Petronius hoped, however, that as things were, no one in the Palatine knew
  where they lived, and therefore in every case Vinicius would anticipate the
  pretorians. It occurred to him also that Tigellinus, wishing to seize at one
  attempt as many Christians as possible, would extend his net over all Rome.
  &ldquo;If they send no more than ten people after her,&rdquo; thought he,
  &ldquo;that giant Lygian will break their bones and what will it be if
  Vinicius comes with assistance?&rdquo; Thinking of this he was consoled.
  True, armed resistance to the pretorians was almost the same as war with
  Cæsar. Petronius knew also that if Vinicius hid from the vengeance of Nero,
  that vengeance might fall on himself; but he cared little. On the contrary,
  he rejoiced at the thought of crossing Nero&rsquo;s plans and those of
  Tigellinus, and determined to spare in the matter neither men nor money.
  Since in Antium Paul of Tarsus had converted most of his slaves, he, while
  defending Christians, might count on their zeal and devotion.</p>

  <p>The entrance of Eunice interrupted his thoughts. At sight of her all his
  cares and troubles vanished without a trace. He forgot Cæsar, the disfavor
  into which he had fallen, the degraded Augustians, the persecution
  threatening the Christians, Vinicius, Lygia, and looked only at her with the
  eyes of an anthetic man enamoured of marvellous forms, and of a lover for
  whom love breathes from those forms. She, in a transparent violet robe called
  &ldquo;Coa vestis,&rdquo; through which her maiden-like form appeared, was
  really as beautiful as a goddess. Feeling herself admired meanwhile, and
  loving him with all her soul, ever eager for his fondling, she blushed with
  delight as if she had been an innocent maiden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What wilt thou say to me, Charis?&rdquo; asked Petronius,
  stretching his hands to her.</p>

  <p>She, inclining her golden head to him, answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Anthemios
  has come with his choristers, and asks if &rsquo;tis thy wish to hear
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him stay; he will sing to us during dinner the hymn to Apollo.
  By the groves of Paphos! when I see thee in that Coan gauze, I think that
  Aphrodite has veiled herself with a piece of the sky, and is standing before
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come hither, Eunice, embrace me with thy arms, and give thy lips to
  me. Dost thou love me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should not have loved Zeus more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then she pressed her lips to his, while quivering in his arms from
  happiness. After a while Petronius asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if we should have to separate?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eunice looked at him with fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that, lord?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fear not; I ask, for who knows but I may have to set out on a long
  journey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take me with thee-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius changed the conversation quickly, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, are there asphodels on the grass plot in the
  garden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cypresses and the grass plots are yellow from the fire, the
  leaves have fallen from the myrtles, and the whole garden seems
  dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All Rome seems dead, and soon it will be a real graveyard. Dost
  thou know that an edict against the Christians is to be issued, and a
  persecution will begin during which thousands will perish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why punish the Christians, lord? They are good and
  peaceful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For that very reason.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go to the sea. Thy beautiful eyes do not like to see
  blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, but meanwhile I must bathe. Come to the elæothesium to anoint
  my arms. By the girdle of Kypris! never hast thou seemed to me so beautiful.
  I will give command to make a bath for thee in the form of a shell; thou wilt
  be like a costly pearl in it. Come, Golden-haired!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went out, and an hour later both, in garlands of roses and with misty
  eyes, were resting before a table covered with a service of gold. They were
  served by boys dressed as Cupids, they drank wine from ivy-wreathed goblets,
  and heard the hymn to Apollo sung to the sound of harps, under direction of
  Anthemios. What cared they if around the villa chimneys pointed up from the
  ruins of houses, and gusts of wind swept the ashes of burnt Rome in every
  direction? They were happy thinking only of love, which had made their lives
  like a divine dream. But before the hymn was finished a slave, the chief of
  the atrium, entered the hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, in a voice quivering with alarm, &ldquo;a
  centurion with a detachment of pretorians is standing before the gate, and,
  at command of Cæsar, wishes to see thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The song and the sound of lutes ceased. Alarm was roused in all present;
  for Cæsar, in communications with friends, did not employ pretorians usually,
  and their arrival at such times foreboded no good. Petronius alone showed not
  the slightest emotion, but said, like a man annoyed by continual
  visits,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They might let me dine in peace.&rdquo; Then turning to the chief
  of the atrium, he said, &ldquo;Let him enter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The slave disappeared behind the curtain; a moment later heavy steps were
  heard, and an acquaintance of Petronius appeared, the centurion Aper, armed,
  and with an iron helmet on his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is a letter from
  Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius extended his white hand lazily, took the tablet, and, casting
  his eye over it, gave it, in all calmness to Eunice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will read a new book of the Troyad this evening, and invites me
  to come.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have only the order to deliver the letter,&rdquo; said the
  centurion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there will be no answer. But, centurion, thou mightst rest a
  while with us and empty a goblet of wine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee, noble lord. A goblet of wine I will drink to thy
  health willingly; but rest I may not, for I am on duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why was the letter given to thee, and not sent by a
  slave?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not, lord. Perhaps because I was sent in this direction on
  other duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, against the Christians?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it long since the pursuit was begun?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some divisions were sent to the Trans-Tiber before midday.&rdquo;
  When he had said this, the centurion shook a little wine from the goblet in
  honor of Mars; then he emptied it, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May the gods grant thee, lord, what thou desirest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the goblet too,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>Then he gave a sign to Anthemios to finish the hymn to Apollo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bronzebeard is beginning to play with me and Vinicius,&rdquo;
  thought he, when the harps sounded anew. &ldquo;I divine his plan! He wanted
  to terrify me by sending the invitation through a centurion. They will ask
  the centurion in the evening how I received him. No, no! thou wilt not amuse
  thyself overmuch, cruel and wicked prophet. I know that thou wilt not forget
  the offence, I know that my destruction will not fail; but if thou think that
  I shall look into thy eyes imploringly, that thou wilt see fear and humility
  on my face, thou art mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar writes, lord,&rdquo; said Eunice, &ldquo;&lsquo;Come if thou
  hast the wish&rsquo;; wilt thou go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am in excellent health, and can listen even to his verses,&rdquo;
  answered Petronius; &ldquo;hence I shall go, all the more since Vinicius
  cannot go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact, after the dinner was finished and after the usual walk, he gave
  himself into the hands of hairdressers and of slaves who arranged his robes,
  and an hour later, beautiful as a god, he gave command to take him to the
  Palatine.</p>

  <p>It was late, the evening was warm and calm; the moon shone so brightly
  that the lampadarii going before the litter put out their torches. On the
  streets and among the ruins crowds of people were pushing along, drunk with
  wine, in garlands of ivy and honeysuckle, bearing in their hands branches of
  myrtle and laurel taken from Cæsar&rsquo;s gardens. Abundance of grain and
  hopes of great games filled the hearts of all with gladness. Here and there
  songs were sung magnifying the &ldquo;divine night&rdquo; and love; here and
  there they were dancing by the light of the moon, and the slaves were forced
  repeatedly to demand space for the litter &ldquo;of the noble
  Petronius,&rdquo; and then the crowd pushed apart, shouting in honor of their
  favorite.</p>

  <p>He was thinking of Vinicius, and wondering why he had no news from him. He
  was an Epicurean and an egotist, but passing time, now with Paul of Tarsus,
  now with Vinicius, hearing daily of the Christians, he had changed somewhat
  without his own knowledge. A certain breeze from them had blown on him; this
  cast new seeds into his soul. Besides his own person others began to occupy
  him; moreover, he had been always attached to Vinicius, for in childhood he
  had loved greatly his sister, the mother of Vinicius; at present, therefore,
  when he had taken part in his affairs, he looked on them with that interest
  with which he would have looked on some tragedy.</p>

  <p>Petronius did not lose hope that Vinicius had anticipated the pretorians
  and fled with Lygia, or, in the worse case, had rescued her. But he would
  have preferred to be certain, since he foresaw that he might have to answer
  various questions for which he would better be prepared.</p>

  <p>Stopping before the house of Tiberius, he alighted from the litter, and
  after a while entered the atrium, filled already with Augustians.
  Yesterday&rsquo;s friends, though astonished that he was invited, still
  pushed back; but he moved on among them, beautiful, free, unconcerned, as
  self-confident as if he himself had the power to distribute favors. Some,
  seeing him thus, were alarmed in spirit lest they had shown him indifference
  too early.</p>

  <p>Cæsar, however, feigned not to see him, and did not return his obeisance,
  pretending to be occupied in conversation. But Tigellinus approached and
  said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Arbiter Elegantiarum. Dost thou assert still that it
  was not the Christians who burnt Rome?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius shrugged his shoulders, and, clapping Tigellinus on the back as
  he would a freedman, answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou knowest as well as I what to think of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not dare to rival thee in wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou art right, for when Cæsar reads to us a new book from the
  Troyad, thou, instead of crying out like a jackdaw, wouldst have to give an
  opinion that was not pointless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus bit his lips. He was not over-rejoiced that Cæsar had decided
  to read a new book, for that opened a field in which he could not rival
  Petronius. In fact, during the reading, Nero, from habit, turned his eyes
  involuntarily toward Petronius, looking carefully to see what he could read
  in his face. The latter listened, raised his brows, agreed at times, in
  places increased his attention as if to be sure that he heard correctly. Then
  he praised or criticised, demanded corrections or the smoothing of certain
  verses. Nero himself felt that for others in their exaggerated praises it was
  simply a question of themselves, that Petronius alone was occupied with
  poetry for its own sake; that he alone understood it, and that if he praised
  one could be sure that the verses deserved praise. Gradually therefore he
  began to discuss with him, to dispute; and when at last Petronius brought the
  fitness of a certain expression into doubt, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt see in the last book why I used it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought Petronius, &ldquo;then we shall wait for the
  last book.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>More than one hearing this said in spirit: &ldquo;Woe to me! Petronius
  with time before him may return to favor and overturn even Tigellinus.&rdquo;
  And they began again to approach him. But the end of the evening was less
  fortunate; for Cæsar, at the moment when Petronius was taking leave, inquired
  suddenly, with blinking eyes and a face at once glad and
  malicious,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why did not Vinicius come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Had Petronius been sure that Vinicius and Lygia were beyond the gates of
  the city, he would have answered, &ldquo;With thy permission he has married
  and gone.&rdquo; But seeing Nero&rsquo;s strange smile, he
  answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy invitation, divinity, did not find him at home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say to Vinicius that I shall be glad to see him,&rdquo; answered
  Nero, &ldquo;and tell him from me not to neglect the games in which
  Christians will appear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These words alarmed Petronius. It seemed to him that they related to Lygia
  directly. Sitting in his litter, he gave command to bear him home still more
  quickly than in the morning. That, however, was not easy. Before the house of
  Tiberius stood a crowd dense and noisy, drunk as before, though not singing
  and dancing, but, as it were, excited. From afar came certain shouts which
  Petronius could not understand at once, but which rose and grew till at last
  they were one savage roar,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the lions with Christians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rich litters of courtiers pushed through the howling rabble. From the
  depth of burnt streets new crowds rushed forth continually; these, hearing
  the cry, repeated it. News passed from mouth to mouth that the pursuit had
  continued from the forenoon, that a multitude of incendiaries were seized;
  and immediately along the newly cleared and the old streets, through alleys
  lying among ruins around the Palatine, over all the hills and gardens were
  heard through the length and breadth of Rome shouts of swelling
  rage,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the lions with Christians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Herd!&rdquo; repeated Petronius, with contempt; &ldquo;a people
  worthy of Cæsar!&rdquo; And he began to think that a society resting on
  superior force, on cruelty of which even barbarians had no conception, on
  crimes and mad profligacy, could not endure. Rome ruled the world, but was
  also its ulcer. The odor of a corpse was rising from it. Over its decaying
  life the shadow of death was descending. More than once this had been
  mentioned even among the Augustians, but never before had Petronius had a
  clearer view of this truth that the laurelled chariot on which Rome stood in
  the form of a triumphator, and which dragged behind a chained herd of
  nations, was going to the precipice. The life of that world-ruling city
  seemed to him a kind of mad dance, an orgy, which must end. He saw then that
  the Christians alone had a new basis of life; but he judged that soon there
  would not remain a trace of the Christians. And what then?</p>

  <p>The mad dance would continue under Nero; and if Nero disappeared, another
  would be found of the same kind or worse, for with such a people and such
  patricians there was no reason to find a better leader. There would be a new
  orgy, and moreover a fouler and a viler one.</p>

  <p>But the orgy could not last forever, and there would be need of sleep when
  it was over, even because of simple exhaustion.</p>

  <p>While thinking of this, Petronius felt immensely wearied. Was it worth
  while to live, and live in uncertainty, with no purpose but to look at such a
  society? The genius of death was not less beautiful than the genius of sleep,
  and he also had wings at his shoulders.</p>

  <p>The litter stopped before the arbiter&rsquo;s door, which was opened that
  instant by the watchful keeper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has the noble Vinicius returned?&rdquo; inquired Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, lord, a moment ago,&rdquo; replied the slave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has not rescued her,&rdquo; thought Petronius. And casting aside
  his toga, he ran into the atrium. Vinicius was sitting on a stool; his head
  bent almost to his knees with his hands on his head; but at the sound of
  steps he raised his stony face, in which the eyes alone had a feverish
  brightness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert late?&rdquo; asked Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; they seized her before midday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou seen her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the Mamertine prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius trembled and looked at Vinicius with an inquiring glance. The
  latter understood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She was not thrust down to the Tullianum
  [The lowest part of the prison, lying entirely underground, with a single
  opening in the ceiling. Jugurtha died there of hunger.] nor even to the
  middle prison. I paid the guard to give her his own room. Ursus took his
  place at the threshold and is guarding her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why did Ursus not defend her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They sent fifty pretorians, and Linus forbade him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Linus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Linus is dying; therefore they did not seize him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is thy intention?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To save her or die with her. I too believe in Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius spoke with apparent calmness; but there was such despair in his
  voice that the heart of Petronius quivered from pure pity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand thee,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but how dost thou think
  to save her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I paid the guards highly, first to shield her from indignity, and
  second not to hinder her flight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When can that happen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They answered that they could not give her to me at once, as they
  feared responsibility. When the prison will be filled with a multitude of
  people, and when the tally of prisoners is confused, they will deliver her.
  But that is a desperate thing! Do thou save her, and me first! Thou art a
  friend of Cæsar. He himself gave her to me. Go to him and save me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius, instead of answering, called a slave, and, commanding him to
  bring two dark mantles and two swords, turned to Vinicius,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the way I will tell thee,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Meanwhile take
  the mantle and weapon, and we will go to the prison. There give the guards a
  hundred thousand sestertia; give them twice and five times more, if they will
  free Lygia at once. Otherwise it will be too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>After a while both were on the street.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;I did not wish to
  lose time. I am in disfavor, beginning with to-day. My own life is hanging on
  a hair; hence I can do nothing with Cæsar. Worse than that, I am sure that he
  would act in opposition to my request. If that were not the case, would I
  advise thee to flee with Lygia or to rescue her? Besides, if thou escape,
  Cæsar&rsquo;s wrath will turn on me. To-day he would rather do something at
  thy request than at mine. Do not count on that, however. Get her out of the
  prison, and flee! Nothing else is left. If that does not succeed, there will
  be time for other methods. Meanwhile know that Lygia is in prison, not alone
  for belief in Christ; Poppæa&rsquo;s anger is pursuing her and thee. Thou
  hast offended the Augusta by rejecting her, dost remember? She knows that she
  was rejected for Lygia, whom she hated from the first cast of the eye. Nay,
  she tried to destroy Lygia before by ascribing the death of her own infant to
  her witchcraft. The hand of Poppæa is in this. How explain that Lygia was the
  first to be imprisoned? Who could point out the house of Linus? But I tell
  thee that she has been followed this long time. I know that I wring thy soul,
  and take the remnant of thy hope from thee, but I tell thee this purposely,
  for the reason that if thou free her not before they come at the idea that
  thou wilt try, ye are both lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I understand!&rdquo; muttered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>The streets were empty because of the late hour. Their further
  conversation was interrupted, however, by a drunken gladiator who came toward
  them. He reeled against Petronius, put one hand on his shoulder, covering his
  face with a breath filled with wine, and shouted in a hoarse
  voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the lions with Christians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mirmillon,&rdquo; answered Petronius, quietly, &ldquo;listen to
  good counsel; go thy way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With his other hand the drunken man seized him by the arm,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shout with me, or I&rsquo;ll break thy neck: Christians to the
  lions!&rdquo; But the arbiter&rsquo;s nerves had had enough of those shouts.
  From the time that he had left the Palatine they had been stifling him like a
  nightmare, and rending his ears. So when he saw the fist of the giant above
  him, the measure of his patience was exceeded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou hint the smell of wine, and art
  stopping my way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he drove into the man&rsquo;s breast to the hilt the short
  sword which he had brought from home; then, taking the arm of Vinicius, he
  continued as if nothing had happened,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar said to-day, &rsquo;Tell Vinicius from me to be at the games
  in which Christians will appear.&rsquo; Dost understand what that means? They
  wish to make a spectacle of thy pain. That is a settled affair. Perhaps that
  is why thou and I are not imprisoned yet. If thou art not able to get her at
  once&mdash;I do not know&mdash;Acte might take thy part; but can she effect
  anything? Thy Sicilian lands, too, might tempt Tigellinus. Make the
  trial.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will give him all that I have,&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>From the Carinæ to the Forum was not very far; hence they arrived soon.
  The night had begun to pale, and the walls of the castle came out definitely
  from the shadow.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as they turned toward the Mamertine prison, Petronius stopped,
  and said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretorians! Too late!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact the prison was surrounded by a double rank of soldiers. The
  morning dawn was silvering their helmets and the points of their
  javelins.</p>

  <p>Vinicius grew as pale as marble. &ldquo;Let us go on,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>After a while they halted before the line. Gifted with an uncommon memory,
  Petronius knew not only the officers, but nearly all the pretorian soldiers.
  Soon he saw an acquaintance, a leader of a cohort, and nodded to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what is this, Niger?&rdquo; asked he; &ldquo;are ye commanded
  to watch the prison?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, noble Petronius. The prefect feared lest they might try to
  rescue the incendiaries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have ye the order to admit no one?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have not; acquaintances will visit the prisoners, and in that
  way we shall seize more Christians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let me in,&rdquo; said Vinicius; and pressing
  Petronius&rsquo;s hand, he said, &ldquo;See Acte, I will come to learn her
  answer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; responded Petronius.</p>

  <p>At that moment under the ground and beyond the thick walls was heard
  singing. The hymn, at first low and muffled, rose more and more. The voices
  of men, women, and children were mingled in one harmonious chorus. The whole
  prison began to sound, in the calmness of dawn, like a harp. But those were
  not voices of sorrow or despair; on the contrary, gladness and triumph were
  heard in them.</p>

  <p>The soldiers looked at one another with amazement. The first golden and
  rosy gleams of the morning appeared in the sky.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51">CHAPTER LI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The cry, &ldquo;Christians to the lions!&rdquo; was heard
  increasingly in every part of the city. At first not only did no one doubt
  that they were the real authors of the catastrophe, but no one wished to
  doubt, since their punishment was to be a splendid amusement for the
  populace. Still the opinion spread that the catastrophe would not have
  assumed such dreadful proportions but for the anger of the gods; for this
  reason &ldquo;piacula,&rdquo; or purifying sacrifices, were commanded in the
  temples. By advice of the Sibylline books, the Senate ordained solemnities
  and public prayer to Vulcan, Ceres, and Proserpina. Matrons made offerings to
  Juno; a whole procession of them went to the seashore to take water and
  sprinkle with it the statue of the goddess. Married women prepared feasts to
  the gods and night watches. All Rome purified itself from sin, made
  offerings, and placated the Immortals. Meanwhile new broad streets were
  opened among the ruins. In one place and another foundations were laid for
  magnificent houses, palaces, and temples. But first of all they built with
  unheard-of haste an enormous wooden amphitheatre in which Christians were to
  die. Immediately after that consultation in the house of Tiberius, orders
  went to consuls to furnish wild beasts. Tigellinus emptied the vivaria of all
  Italian cities, not excepting the smaller ones. In Africa, at his command,
  gigantic hunts were organized, in which the entire local population was
  forced to take part. Elephants and tigers were brought in from Asia,
  crocodiles and hippopotamuses from the Nile, lions from the Atlas, wolves and
  bears from the Pyrenees, savage hounds from Hibernia, Molossian dogs from
  Epirus, bisons and the gigantic wild aurochs from Germany. Because of the
  number of prisoners, the games were to surpass in greatness anything seen up
  to that time. Cæsar wished to drown all memory of the fire in blood, and make
  Rome drunk with it; hence never had there been a greater promise of
  bloodshed.</p>

  <p>The willing people helped guards and pretorians in hunting Christians.
  That was no difficult labor for whole groups of them camped with the other
  population in the midst of the gardens, and confessed their faith openly.
  When surrounded, they knelt, and while singing hymns let themselves be borne
  away without resistance. But their patience only increased the anger of the
  populace, who, not understanding its origin, considered it as rage and
  persistence in crime. A madness seized the persecutors. It happened that the
  mob wrested Christians from pretorians, and tore them to pieces; women were
  dragged to prison by the hair; children&rsquo;s heads were dashed against
  stones. Thousands of people rushed, howling, night and day through the
  streets. Victims were sought in ruins, in chimneys, in cellars. Before the
  prison bacchanalian feasts and dances were celebrated at fires, around casks
  of wine.</p>

  <p>In the evening was heard with delight bellowing which was like thunder,
  and which sounded throughout the city. The prisons were overflowing with
  thousands of people; every day the mob and pretorians drove in new victims.
  Pity had died out. It seemed that people had forgotten to speak, and in their
  wild frenzy remembered one shout alone: &ldquo;To the lions with
  Christians!&rdquo; Wonderfully hot days came, and nights more stifling than
  ever before; the very air seemed filled with blood, crime, and madness.</p>

  <p>And that surpassing measure of cruelty was answered by an equal measure of
  desire for martyrdom,&mdash;the confessors of Christ went to death willingly,
  or even sought death till they were restrained by the stern commands of
  superiors. By the injunction of these superiors they began to assemble only
  outside the city, in excavations near the Appian Way, and in vineyards
  belonging to patrician Christians, of whom none had been imprisoned so far.
  It was known perfectly on the Palatine that to the confessors of Christ
  belonged Flavius, Domitilla, Pomponia Græcina, Cornelius Pudens, and
  Vinicius. Cæsar himself, however, feared that the mob would not believe that
  such people had burned Rome, and since it was important beyond everything to
  convince the mob, punishment and vengeance were deferred till later days.
  Others were of the opinion, but erroneously, that those patricians were saved
  by the influence of Acte. Petronius, after parting with Vinicius, turned to
  Acte, it is true, to gain assistance for Lygia; but she could offer him only
  tears, for she lived in oblivion and suffering, and was endured only in so
  far as she hid herself from Poppæa and Cæsar.</p>

  <p>But she had visited Lygia in prison, she had carried her clothing and
  food, and above all had saved her from injury on the part of the
  prison-guards, who, moreover, were bribed already.</p>

  <p>Petronius, unable to forget that had it not been for him and his plan of
  taking Lygia from the house of Aulus, probably she would not be in prison at
  that moment, and, besides, wishing to win the game against Tigellinus, spared
  neither time nor efforts. In the course of a few days he saw Seneca, Domitius
  Afer, Crispinilla, and Diodorus, through whom he wished to reach Poppæa; he
  saw Terpnos, and the beautiful Pythagoras, and finally Aliturus and Paris, to
  whom Cæsar usually refused nothing. With the help of Chrysothemis, then
  mistress of Vatinius, he tried to gain even his aid, not sparing in this case
  and in others promises and money.</p>

  <p>But all these efforts were fruitless. Seneca, uncertain of the morrow,
  fell to explaining to him that the Christians, even if they had not burned
  Rome, should be exterminated, for the good of the city,&mdash;in a word, he
  justified the coming slaughter for political reasons. Terpnos and Diodorus
  took the money, and did nothing in return for it. Vatinius reported to Cæsar
  that they had been trying to bribe him. Aliturus alone, who at first was
  hostile to the Christians, took pity on them then, and made bold to mention
  to Cæsar the imprisoned maiden, and to implore in her behalf. He obtained
  nothing, however, but the answer,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou think that I have a soul inferior to that of Brutus, who
  spared not his own sons for the good of Rome?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When this answer was repeated to Petronius, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since Nero has compared himself to Brutus, there is no
  salvation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he was sorry for Vinicius, and dread seized him lest he might attempt
  his own life. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought the arbiter, &ldquo;he is upheld by
  the efforts which he makes to save her, by the sight of her, and by his own
  suffering; but when all means fail and the last ray of hope is quenched, by
  Castor! he will not survive, he will throw himself on his sword.&rdquo;
  Petronius understood better how to die thus than to love and suffer like
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Vinicius did all that he could think of to save Lygia. He
  visited Augustians; and he, once so proud, now begged their assistance.
  Through Vitelius he offered Tigellinus all his Sicilian estates, and whatever
  else the man might ask; but Tigellinus, not wishing apparently to offend the
  Augusta, refused. To go to Cæsar himself, embrace his knees and implore,
  would lead to nothing. Vinicius wished, it is true, to do this; but
  Petronius, hearing of his purpose, inquired,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But should he refuse thee, or answer with a jest or a shameless
  threat, what wouldst thou do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this the young tribune&rsquo;s features contracted with pain and rage,
  and from his fixed jaws a gritting sound was heard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;I advise thee against this,
  because thou wouldst close all paths of rescue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius restrained himself, and passing his palm over his forehead, which
  was covered with cold sweat, replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no! I am a Christian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou will forget this, as thou didst a moment ago. Thou hast
  the right to ruin thyself, but not her. Remember what the daughter of Sejanus
  passed through before death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Speaking thus he was not altogether sincere, since he was concerned more
  for Vinicius than for Lygia. Still he knew that in no way could he restrain
  him from a dangerous step as well as by telling him that he would bring
  inexorable destruction on Lygia. Moreover he was right; for on the Palatine
  they had counted on the visit of the young tribune, and had taken needful
  precautions.</p>

  <p>But the suffering of Vinicius surpassed human endurance. From the moment
  that Lygia was imprisoned and the glory of coming martyrdom had fallen on
  her, not only did he love her a hundred times more, but he began simply to
  give her in his soul almost religious honor, as he would a superhuman being.
  And now, at the thought that he must lose this being both loved and holy,
  that besides death torments might be inflicted on her more terrible than
  death itself, the blood stiffened in his veins. His soul was turned into one
  groan, his thoughts were confused. At times it seemed to him that his skull
  was filled with living fire, which would either burn or burst it. He ceased
  to understand what was happening; he ceased to understand why Christ, the
  Merciful, the Divine, did not come with aid to His adherents; why the dingy
  walls of the Palatine did not sink through the earth, and with them Nero, the
  Augustians, the pretorian camp, and all that city of crime. He thought that
  it could not and should not be otherwise; and all that his eyes saw, and
  because of which his heart was breaking, was a dream. But the roaring of wild
  beasts informed him that it was reality; the sound of the axes beneath which
  rose the arena told him that it was reality; the howling of the people and
  the overfilled prisons confirmed this. Then his faith in Christ was alarmed;
  and that alarm was a new torture, the most dreadful of all, perhaps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember what the daughter of Sejanus endured before death,&rdquo;
  said Petronius to him, meanwhile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52">CHAPTER LII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And everything had failed. Vinicius lowered himself to the
  degree that he sought support from freedmen and slaves, both those of Cæsar
  and Poppæa; he overpaid their empty promises, he won their good will with
  rich gifts. He found the first husband of Poppæa, Rufus Crispinus, and
  obtained from him a letter. He gave a villa in Antium to Rufius, her son by
  the first marriage; but thereby he merely angered Cæsar, who hated his
  step-son. By a special courier he sent a letter to Poppæa&rsquo;s second
  husband, Otho, in Spain. He sacrificed his property and himself, until he saw
  at last that he was simply the plaything of people; that if he had pretended
  that the imprisonment of Lygia concerned him little, he would have freed her
  sooner.</p>

  <p>Petronius saw this, too. Meanwhile day followed day. The amphitheatre was
  finished. The &ldquo;tesseræ&rdquo; were distributed,&mdash;that is, tickets
  of entrance, to the ludus matutinus (morning games). But this time the
  morning games, because of the unheard-of number of victims, were to continue
  for days, weeks, and months. It was not known where to put the Christians.
  The prisons were crammed, and fever was raging in them. The
  puticuli&mdash;common pits in which slaves were kept&mdash;began to be
  overfilled. There was fear that diseases might spread over the whole city
  hence, haste.</p>

  <p>All these reports struck the ears of Vinicius, extinguishing in him the
  last hope. While there was yet time, he might delude himself with the belief
  that he could do something, but now there was no time. The spectacles must
  begin. Lygia might find herself any day in a cuniculum of the circus, whence
  the only exit was to the arena. Vinicius, not knowing whither fate and the
  cruelty of superior force might throw her, visited all the circuses, bribed
  guards and beast-keepers, laying before them plans which they could not
  execute. In time he saw that he was working for this only,&mdash;to make
  death less terrible to her; and just then he felt that instead of brains he
  had glowing coals in his head.</p>

  <p>For the rest he had no thought of surviving her, and determined to perish
  at the same time. But he feared lest pain might burn his life out before the
  dreadful hour came. His friends and Petronius thought also that any day might
  open the kingdom of shadows before him. His face was black, and resembled
  those waxen masks kept in lararia. In his features astonishment had grown
  frigid, as if he hid no understanding of what had happened and what might
  happen. When any one spoke to him, he raised his hands to his face
  mechanically, and, pressing his temples, looked at the speaker with an
  inquiring and astonished gaze. He passed whole nights with Ursus at
  Lygia&rsquo;s door in the prison; if she commanded him to go away and rest,
  he returned to Petronius, and walked in the atrium till morning. The slaves
  found him frequently kneeling with upraised hands or lying with his face to
  the earth. He prayed to Christ, for Christ was his last hope. Everything had
  failed him. Only a miracle could save Lygia; hence he beat the stone flags
  with his forehead and prayed for the miracle.</p>

  <p>But he knew enough yet to understand that Peter&rsquo;s prayers were more
  important than his own. Peter had promised him Lygia, Peter had baptized him,
  Peter had performed miracles, let him give aid and rescue.</p>

  <p>And a certain night he went to seek the Apostle. The Christians, of whom
  not many remained, had concealed him now carefully even from other brethren,
  lest any of the weaker in spirit might betray him wittingly or unwittingly.
  Vinicius, amid the general confusion and disaster, occupied also in efforts
  to get Lygia out of prison, had lost sight of Peter, he had barely seen him
  once from the time of his own baptism till the beginning of the persecution.
  But betaking himself to that quarryman in whose hut he was baptized, he
  learned that there would be a meeting outside the Porta Salaria in a vineyard
  which belonged to Cornelius Pudens. The quarryman offered to guide him, and
  declared that he would find Peter there. They started about dusk, and,
  passing beyond the wall, through hollows overgrown with reeds, reached the
  vineyard in a wild and lonely place. The meeting was held in a wine-shed. As
  Vinicius drew near, the murmur of prayer reached his ears. On entering he saw
  by dim lamplight a few tens of kneeling figures sunk in prayer. They were
  saying a kind of litany; a chorus of voices, male and female, repeated every
  moment, &ldquo;Christ have mercy on us.&rdquo; In those voices, deep,
  piercing sadness and sorrow were heard.</p>

  <p>Peter was present. He was kneeling in front of the others, before a wooden
  cross nailed to the wall of the shed, and was praying. From a distance
  Vinicius recognized his white hair and his upraised hands. The first thought
  of the young patrician was to pass through the assembly, cast himself at the
  Apostle&rsquo;s feet, and cry, &ldquo;Save!&rdquo; but whether it was the
  solemnity of the prayer, or because weakness bent the knees under Vinicius,
  he began to repeat while he groaned and clasped his hands: &ldquo;Christ have
  mercy!&rdquo; Had he been conscious, he would have understood that his was
  not the only prayer in which there was a groan; that he was not the only one
  who had brought with him his pain, alarm, and grief. There was not in that
  assembly one soul which had not lost persons dear to the heart; and when the
  most zealous and courageous confessors were in prison already, when with
  every moment new tidings were borne about of insults and tortures inflicted
  on them in the prisons, when the greatness of the calamity exceeded every
  imagination, when only that handful remained, there was not one heart there
  which was not terrified in its faith, which did not ask doubtfully, Where is
  Christ? and why does He let evil be mightier than God? Meanwhile they
  implored Him despairingly for mercy, since in each soul there still
  smouldered a spark of hope that He would come, hurl Nero into the abyss, and
  rule the world. They looked yet toward the sky; they listened yet; they
  prayed yet with trembling. Vinicius, too, in proportion as they repeated,
  &ldquo;Christ have mercy on us!&rdquo; was seized by such an ecstasy as
  formerly in the quarryman&rsquo;s hut. Now from the depths they call on Him
  in the profoundness of their sorrow, now Peter calls on Him; so any moment
  the heavens may be rent, the earth tremble to its foundations, and He appear
  in infinite glory, with stars at His feet, merciful, but awful. He will raise
  up the faithful, and command the abysses to swallow the persecutors.</p>

  <p>Vinicius covered his face with both hands, and bowed to the earth.
  Immediately silence was around him, as if fear had stopped further breathing
  on the lips of all present. And it seemed to him that something must happen
  surely, that a moment of miracle would follow. He felt certain that when he
  rose and opened his eyes he would see a light from which mortal eyes would be
  blinded, and hear a voice from which hearts would grow faint.</p>

  <p>But the silence was unbroken. It was interrupted at last by the sobbing of
  women. Vinicius rose and looked forward with dazed eyes. In the shed, instead
  of glories not of earth, shone the faint gleam of lanterns, and rays of the
  moon, entering through an opening in the roof, filled the place with silvery
  light. The people kneeling around Vinicius raised their tearful eyes toward
  the cross in silence; here and there sobbing was heard, and from outside came
  the warning whistles of watchmen. Meanwhile Peter rose, and, turning to the
  assembly, said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Children, raise your hearts to the Redeemer and offer Him your
  tears.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After that he was silent.</p>

  <p>All at once was heard the voice of a woman, full of sorrowful complaint
  and pain,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a widow; I had one son who supported me. Give him back, O
  Lord!&rdquo; Silence followed again. Peter was standing before the kneeling
  audience, old, full of care. In that moment he seemed to them decrepitude and
  weakness personified. With that a second voice began to complain,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Executioners insulted my daughter, and Christ permitted
  them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then a third,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I alone have remained to my children, and when I am taken who will
  give them bread and water?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then a fourth,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Linus, spared at first, they have taken now and put to torture, O
  Lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then a fifth,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When we return to our houses, pretorians will seize us. We know not
  where to hide.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe to us! Who will protect us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And thus in that silence of the night complaint after complaint was heard.
  The old fisherman closed his eyes and shook his white head over that human
  pain and fear. New silence followed; the watchman merely gave out low
  whistles beyond the shed.</p>

  <p>Vinicius sprang up again, so as to break through the crowd to the Apostle
  and demand salvation; but on a sudden he saw before him, as it were, a
  precipice, the sight of which took strength from his feet. What if the
  Apostle were to confess his own weakness, affirm that the Roman Cæsar was
  stronger than Christ the Nazarene? And at that thought terror raised the hair
  on his head, for he felt that in such a case not only the remnant of his hope
  would fall into that abyss, but with it he himself, and all through which he
  had life, and there would remain only night and death, resembling a shoreless
  sea.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Peter began to speak in a voice so low at first that it was
  barely possible to hear him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My children, on Golgotha I saw them nail God to the cross. I heard
  the hammers, and I saw them raise the cross on high, so that the rabble might
  gaze at the death of the Son of Man. I saw them open His side, and I saw Him
  die. When returning from the cross, I cried in pain, as ye are crying,
  &rsquo;Woe! woe! O Lord, Thou art God! Why hast Thou permitted this? Why hast
  Thou died, and why hast Thou tormented the hearts of us who believed that Thy
  kingdom would come?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But He, our Lord and God, rose from the dead the third day, and was
  among us till He entered His kingdom in great glory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And we, seeing our little faith, became strong in heart, and from
  that time we are sowing His grain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here, turning toward the place whence the first complaint came, he began
  in a voice now stronger,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do ye complain? God gave Himself to torture and death, and ye
  wish Him to shield you from the same. People of little faith, have ye
  received His teaching? Has He promised you nothing but life? He comes to you
  and says, &lsquo;Follow in my path.&rsquo; He raises you to Himself, and ye
  catch at this earth with your hands, crying, &lsquo;Lord, save us!&rsquo; I
  am dust before God, but before you I am His apostle and viceregent. I speak
  to you in the name of Christ. Not death is before you, but life; not
  tortures, but endless delights; not tears and groans, but singing; not
  bondage, but rule! I, God&rsquo;s apostle, say this: O widow, thy son will
  not die; he will be born into glory, into eternal life, and thou wilt rejoin
  him! To thee, O father, whose innocent daughter was defiled by executioners,
  I promise that thou shalt find her whiter than the lilies of Hebron! To you,
  mothers, whom they are tearing away from your orphans; to you who lose
  fathers; to you who complain; to you who will see the death of loved ones; to
  you the careworn, the unfortunate, the timid; to you who must die,&mdash;in
  the name of Christ I declare that ye will wake as if from sleep to a happy
  waking, as if from night to the light of God. In the name of Christ, let the
  beam fall from your eyes, and let your hearts be inflamed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he raised his hand as if commanding, and they felt
  new blood in their veins, and also a quiver in their bones; for before them
  was standing, not a decrepit and careworn old man, but a potentate, who took
  their souls and raised them from dust and terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; called a number of voices.</p>

  <p>From the Apostle&rsquo;s eyes came a light ever increasing, power issued
  from him, majesty issued from him, and holiness. Heads bent before him, and
  he, when the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; ceased, continued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye sow in tears to reap in joy. Why fear ye the power of evil?
  Above the earth, above Rome, above the walls of cities is the Lord, who has
  taken His dwelling within you. The stones will be wet from tears, the sand
  steeped in blood, the valleys will be filled with your bodies, but I say that
  ye are victorious. The Lord is advancing to the conquest of this city of
  crime, oppression, and pride, and ye are His legions! He redeemed with His
  own blood and torture the sins of the world; so He wishes that ye should
  redeem with torture and blood this nest of injustice. This He announces to
  you through my lips.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he opened his arms, and fixed his eyes upward; the hearts almost
  ceased to beat in their breasts, for they felt that his glance beheld
  something which their mortal sight could not see.</p>

  <p>In fact, his face had changed, and was overspread with serenity; he gazed
  some time in silence, as if speechless from ecstasy, but after a while they
  heard his voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art here, O Lord, and dost show Thy ways to me. True, O
  Christ! Not in Jerusalem, but in this city of Satan wilt Thou fix Thy
  capital. Here out of these tears and this blood dost Thou wish to build Thy
  Church. Here, where Nero rules to-day, Thy eternal kingdom is to stand.
  Thine, O Lord, O Lord! And Thou commandest these timid ones to form the
  foundation of Thy holy Zion of their bones, and Thou commandest my spirit to
  assume rule over it, and over peoples of the earth. And Thou art pouring the
  fountain of strength on the weak, so that they become strong; and now Thou
  commandest me to feed Thy sheep from this spot, to the end of ages. Oh, be
  Thou praised in Thy decrees by which Thou commandest to conquer. Hosanna!
  Hosanna!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Those who were timid rose; into those who doubted streams of faith flowed.
  Some voices cried, &ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo; others, &ldquo;Pro Christo!&rdquo;
  Then silence followed. Bright summer lightning illuminated the interior of
  the shed, and the pale, excited faces.</p>

  <p>Peter, fixed in a vision, prayed a long time yet; but conscious at last,
  he turned his inspired face, full of light, to the assembly, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is how the Lord has overcome doubt in you; so ye will go to
  victory in His name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And though he knew that they would conquer, though he knew what would grow
  out of their tears and blood, still his voice quivered with emotion when he
  was blessing them with the cross, and he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I bless you, my children, as ye go to torture, to death, to
  eternity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They gathered round him and wept. &ldquo;We are ready,&rdquo; said they;
  &ldquo;but do thou, O holy head, guard thyself, for thou art the viceregent
  who performs the office of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And thus speaking, they seized his mantle; he placed his hands on their
  heads, and blessed each one separately, just as a father does children whom
  he is sending on a long journey.</p>

  <p>And they began at once to go out of the shed, for they were in a hurry, to
  their houses, and from them to the prisons and arenas. Their thoughts were
  separated from the earth, their souls had taken flight toward eternity, and
  they walked on as if in a dream, in ecstasy opposing that force which was in
  them to the force and the cruelty of the &ldquo;Beast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nereus, the servant of Pudens, took the Apostle and led him by a secret
  path in the vineyard to his house. But Vinicius followed them in the clear
  night, and when they reached the cottage of Nereus at last, he threw himself
  suddenly at the feet of the Apostle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou wish, my Son?&rdquo; asked Peter, recognizing
  him.</p>

  <p>After what he had heard in the vineyard, Vinicius dared not implore him
  for anything; but, embracing his feet with both hands, he pressed his
  forehead to them with sobbing, and called for compassion in that dumb
  manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. They took the maiden whom thou lovest. Pray for
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; groaned Vinicius, embracing his feet still more
  firmly,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, I am a wretched worm; but thou didst know Christ.
  Implore Him,&mdash;take her part.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And from pain he trembled like a leaf; and he beat the earth with his
  forehead, for, knowing the strength of the Apostle, he knew that he alone
  could rescue her.</p>

  <p>Peter was moved by that pain. He remembered how on a time Lygia herself,
  when attacked by Crispus, lay at his feet in like manner imploring pity. He
  remembered that he had raised her and comforted her; hence now he raised
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will pray for her; but do thou
  remember that I told those doubting ones that God Himself passed through the
  torment of the cross, and remember that after this life begins
  another,&mdash;an eternal one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know; I have heard!&rdquo; answered Vinicius, catching the air
  with his pale lips; &ldquo;but thou seest, lord, that I cannot! If blood is
  required, implore Christ to take mine,&mdash;I am a soldier. Let Him double,
  let Him triple, the torment intended for her, I will suffer it; but let Him
  spare her. She is a child yet, and He is mightier than Cæsar, I believe,
  mightier. Thou didst love her thyself; thou didst bless us. She is an
  innocent child yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again he bowed, and, putting his face to Peter&rsquo;s knees, he
  repeated,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst know Christ, lord,&mdash;thou didst know Him. He will
  give ear to thee; take her part.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Peter closed his lids, and prayed earnestly. The summer lightning
  illuminated the sky again. Vinicius, by the light of it, looked at the lips
  of the Apostle, waiting sentence of life or death from them. In the silence
  quails were heard calling in the vineyard, and the dull, distant sound of
  treadmills near the Via Salaria.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vinicius,&rdquo; asked the Apostle at last, &ldquo;dost thou
  believe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would I have come hither if I believed not?&rdquo; answered
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then believe to the end, for faith will remove mountains. Hence,
  though thou wert to see that maiden under the sword of the executioner or in
  the jaws of a lion, believe that Christ can save her. Believe, and pray to
  Him, and I will pray with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, raising his face toward heaven, he said aloud,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O merciful Christ, look on this aching heart and console it! O
  merciful Christ, temper the wind to the fleece of the lamb! O merciful
  Christ, who didst implore the Father to turn away the bitter cup from Thy
  mouth, turn it from the mouth of this Thy servant! Amen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius, stretching his hand toward the stars, said,
  groaning,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Thine; take me instead of her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sky began to grow pale in the east.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch53"
     name="ch53">CHAPTER LIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Vinicius, on leaving the Apostle, went to the prison with a
  heart renewed by hope. Somewhere in the depth of his soul, despair and terror
  were still crying; but he stifled those voices. It seemed to him impossible
  that the intercession of the viceregent of God and the power of his prayer
  should be without effect. He feared to hope; he feared to doubt. &ldquo;I
  will believe in His mercy,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;even though I
  saw her in the jaws of a lion.&rdquo; And at this thought, even though the
  soul quivered in him and cold sweat drenched his temples, he believed. Every
  throb of his heart was a prayer then. He began to understand that faith would
  move mountains, for he felt in himself a wonderful strength, which he had not
  felt earlier. It seemed to him that he could do things which he had not the
  power to do the day before. At moments he had an impression that the danger
  had passed. If despair was heard groaning again in his soul, he recalled that
  night, and that holy gray face raised to heaven in prayer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Christ will not refuse His first disciple and the pastor of His
  flock! Christ will not refuse him! I will not doubt!&rdquo; And he ran toward
  the prison as a herald of good news.</p>

  <p>But there an unexpected thing awaited him.</p>

  <p>All the pretorian guards taking turn before the Mamertine prison knew him,
  and generally they raised not the least difficulty; this time, however, the
  line did not open, but a centurion approached him and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon, noble tribune, to-day we have a command to admit no
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A command?&rdquo; repeated Vinicius, growing pale.</p>

  <p>The soldier looked at him with pity, and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, lord, a command of Cæsar. In the prison there are many sick,
  and perhaps it is feared that visitors might spread infection through the
  city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But hast thou said that the order was for to-day only?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The guards change at noon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was silent and uncovered his head, for it seemed to him that the
  pileolus which he wore was of lead.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the soldier approached him, and said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be at rest, lord, the guard and Ursus are watching over her.&rdquo;
  When he had said this, he bent and, in the twinkle of an eye, drew with his
  long Gallic sword on the flag stone the form of a fish.</p>

  <p>Vinicius looked at him quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou art a pretorian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till I shall be there,&rdquo; answered the soldier, pointing to the
  prison.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I, too, worship Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May His name be praised! I know, lord, I cannot admit thee to the
  prison, but write a letter, I will give it to the guard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee, brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pressed the soldier&rsquo;s hand, and went away. The pileolus ceased to
  weigh like lead. The morning sun rose over the walls of the prison, and with
  its brightness consolation began to enter his heart again. That Christian
  soldier was for him a new witness of the power of Christ. After a while he
  halted, and, fixing his glance on the rosy clouds above the Capitol and the
  temple of Jupiter Stator, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not seen her to-day, O Lord, but I believe in Thy
  mercy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the house he found Petronius, who, making day out of night as usual,
  had returned not long before. He had succeeded, however, in taking his bath
  and anointing himself for sleep.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have news for thee,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;To-day I was with
  Tullius Senecio, whom Cæsar also visited. I know not whence it came to the
  mind of the Augusta to bring little Rufius with her,&mdash;perhaps to soften
  the heart of Cæsar by his beauty. Unfortunately, the child, wearied by
  drowsiness, fell asleep during the reading, as Vespasian did once; seeing
  this, Ahenobarbus hurled a goblet at his step-son, and wounded him seriously.
  Poppæa fainted; all heard how Cæsar said, &lsquo;I have enough of this
  brood!&rsquo; and that, knowest thou, means as much as death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The punishment of God was hanging over the Augusta,&rdquo; answered
  Vinicius; &ldquo;but why dost thou tell me this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell thee because the anger of Poppæa pursued thee and Lygia;
  occupied now by her own misfortune, she may leave her vengeance and be more
  easily influenced. I will see her this evening and talk with her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee. Thou givest me good news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But do thou bathe and rest. Thy lips are blue, and there is not a
  shadow of thee left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is not the time of the first &lsquo;ludus matutinus&rsquo;
  announced?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In ten days. But they will take other prisons first. The more time
  that remains to us the better. All is not lost yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he did not believe this; for he knew perfectly that since to the
  request of Aliturus, Cæsar had found the splendidly sounding answer in which
  he compared himself to Brutus, there was no rescue for Lygia. He hid also,
  through pity, what he had heard at Senecio&rsquo;s, that Cæsar and Tigellinus
  had decided to select for themselves and their friends the most beautiful
  Christian maidens, and defile them before the torture; the others were to be
  given, on the day of the games, to pretorians and beast-keepers.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Vinicius would not survive Lygia in any case, he strengthened
  hope in his heart designedly, first, through sympathy for him; and second,
  because he wished that if Vinicius had to die, he should die
  beautiful,&mdash;not with a face deformed and black from pain and
  watching.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-day I will speak more or less thus to Augusta,&rdquo; said he:
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Save Lygia for Vinicius, I will save Ruflus for thee.&rsquo;
  And I will think of that seriously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One word spoken to Ahenobarbus at the right moment may save or ruin
  any one. In the worst case, we will gain time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee,&rdquo; repeated Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt thank me best if thou eat and sleep. By Athene! In the
  greatest straits Odysseus had sleep and food in mind. Thou hast spent the
  whole night in prison, of course?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Vinicius; &ldquo;I wished to visit the prison
  to-day, but there is an order to admit no one. Learn, O Petronius, if the
  order is for to-day alone or till the day of the games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will discover this evening, and to-morrow morning will tell thee
  for what time and why the order was issued. But now, even were Helios to go
  to Cimmerian regions from sorrow, I shall sleep, and do thou follow my
  example.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They separated; but Vinicius went to the library and wrote a letter to
  Lygia. When he had finished, he took it himself to the Christian centurion
  who carried it at once to the prison. After a while he returned with a
  greeting from Lygia, and promised to deliver her answer that day.</p>

  <p>Vinicius did not wish to return home, but sat on a stone and waited for
  Lygia&rsquo;s letter. The sun had risen high in the heavens, and crowds of
  people flowed in, as usual, through the Clivus Argentarius to the Forum.
  Hucksters called out their wares, soothsayers offered their services to
  passers-by, citizens walked with deliberate steps toward the rostra to hear
  orators of the day, or tell the latest news to one another. As the heat
  increased, crowds of idlers betook themselves to the porticos of the temples,
  from under which flew from moment to moment, with great rustle of wings,
  flocks of doves, whose white feathers glistened in the sunlight and in the
  blue of the sky.</p>

  <p>From excess of light and the influence of bustle, heat, and great
  weariness, the eyes of Vinicius began to close. The monotonous calls of boys
  playing mora, and the measured tread of soldiers, lulled him to sleep. He
  raised his head still a number of times, and took in the prison with his
  eyes; then he leaned against a Stone, sighed like a child drowsy after long
  weeping, and dropped asleep.</p>

  <p>Soon dreams came. It seemed to him that he was carrying Lygia in his arms
  at night through a strange vineyard. Before him was Pomponia Græcina lighting
  the way with a lamp. A voice, as it were of Petronius called from afar to
  him, &ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo; but he did not mind the call, and followed
  Pomponia till they reached a cottage; at the threshold of the cottage stood
  Peter. He showed Peter Lygia, and said, &ldquo;We are coming from the arena,
  lord, but we cannot wake her; wake her thou.&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ himself
  will come to wake her,&rdquo; answered the Apostle.</p>

  <p>Then the pictures began to change. Through the dream he saw Nero, and
  Poppæa holding in her arms little Ruflus with bleeding head, which Petronius
  was washing and he saw Tigellinus sprinkling ashes on tables covered with
  costly dishes, and Vitelius devouring those dishes, while a multitude of
  other Augustians were sitting at the feast. He himself was resting near
  Lygia; but between the tables walked lions from out whose yellow manes
  trickled blood. Lygia begged him to take her away, but so terrible a weakness
  had seized him that he could not even move. Then still greater disorder
  involved his visions, and finally all fell into perfect darkness.</p>

  <p>He was roused from deep sleep at last by the heat of the sun, and shouts
  given forth right there around the place where he was sitting. Vinicius
  rubbed his eyes. The street was swarming with people; but two runners,
  wearing yellow tunics, pushed aside the throng with long staffs, crying and
  making room for a splendid litter which was carried by four stalwart Egyptian
  slaves.</p>

  <p>In the litter sat a man in white robes, whose face was not easily seen,
  for he held close to his eyes a roll of papyrus and was reading something
  diligently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make way for the noble Augustian!&rdquo; cried the runners.</p>

  <p>But the street was so crowded that the litter had to wait awhile. The
  Augustian put down his roll of papyrus and bent his head, crying,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Push aside those wretches! Make haste!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seeing Vinicius suddenly, he drew back his head and raised the papyrus
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Vinicius drew his hand across his forehead, thinking that he was dreaming
  yet.</p>

  <p>In the litter was sitting Chilo.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the runners had opened the way, and the Egyptians were ready to
  move, when the young tribune, who in one moment understood many things which
  till then had been incomprehensible, approached the litter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A greeting to thee, O Chilo!&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; answered the Greek, with pride and importance,
  endeavoring to give his face an expression of calmness which was not in his
  soul, &ldquo;be greeted, but detain me not, for I am hastening to my friend,
  the noble Tigellinus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, grasping the edge of the litter and looking him straight in the
  eyes, said with a lowered voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didst thou betray Lygia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Colossus of Memnon!&rdquo; cried Chilo, with fear.</p>

  <p>But there was no threat in the eyes of Vinicius; hence the old
  Greek&rsquo;s alarm vanished quickly. He remembered that he was under the
  protection of Tigellinus and of Cæsar himself,&mdash;that is, of a power
  before which everything trembled,&mdash;that he was surrounded by sturdy
  slaves, and that Vinicius stood before him unarmed, with an emaciated face
  and body bent by suffering.</p>

  <p>At this thought his insolence returned to him. He fixed on Vinicius his
  eyes, which were surrounded by red lids, and whispered in answer,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou, when I was dying of hunger, didst give command to flog
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment both were silent; then the dull voice of Vinicius was
  heard,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wronged thee, Chilo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek raised his head, and, snapping his fingers which in Rome was a
  mark of slight and contempt, said so loudly that all could hear
  him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friend, if thou hast a petition to present, come to my house on the
  Esquiline in the morning hour, when I receive guests and clients after my
  bath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he waved his hand; at that sign the Egyptians raised the litter, and
  the slaves, dressed in yellow tunics, began to cry as they brandished their
  staffs,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make way for the litter of the noble Chilo Chilonides! Make way,
  make way!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch54"
     name="ch54">CHAPTER LIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lygia, in a long letter written hurriedly, took farewell to
  Vinicius forever. She knew that no one was permitted to enter the prison, and
  that she could see Vinicius only from the arena. She begged him therefore to
  discover when the turn of the Mamertine prisoners would come, and to be at
  the games, for she wished to see him once more in life. No fear was evident
  in her letter. She wrote that she and the others were longing for the arena,
  where they would find liberation from imprisonment. She hoped for the coming
  of Pomponia and Aulus; she entreated that they too be present. Every word of
  her showed ecstasy, and that separation from life in which all the prisoners
  lived, and at the same time an unshaken faith that all promises would be
  fulfilled beyond the grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whether Christ,&rdquo; wrote she, &ldquo;frees me in this life or
  after death, He has promised me to thee by the lips of the Apostle; therefore
  I am thine.&rdquo; She implored him not to grieve for her, and not to let
  himself be overcome by suffering. For her death was not a dissolution of
  marriage. With the confidence of a child she assured Vinicius that
  immediately after her suffering in the arena she would tell Christ that her
  betrothed Marcus had remained in Rome, that he was longing for her with his
  whole heart. And she thought that Christ would permit her soul, perhaps, to
  return to him for a moment, to tell him that she was living, that she did not
  remember her torments, and that she was happy. Her whole letter breathed
  happiness and immense hope. There was only one request in it connected with
  affairs of earth,&mdash;that Vinicius should take her body from the
  spoliarium and bury it as that of his wife in the tomb in which he himself
  would rest sometime.</p>

  <p>He read this letter with a suffering spirit, but at the same time it
  seemed to him impossible that Lygia should perish under the claws of wild
  beasts, and that Christ would not take compassion on her. But just in that
  were hidden hope and trust. When he returned home, he wrote that he would
  come every day to the walls of the Tullianum to wait till Christ crushed the
  walls and restored her. He commanded her to believe that Christ could give
  her to him, even in the Circus; that the great Apostle was imploring Him to
  do so, and that the hour of liberation was near. The converted centurion was
  to bear this letter to her on the morrow.</p>

  <p>But when Vinicius came to the prison next morning, the centurion left the
  rank, approached him first, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, lord. Christ, who enlightened thee, has shown thee
  favor. Last night Cæsar&rsquo;s freedman and those of the prefect came to
  select Christian maidens for disgrace; they inquired for thy betrothed, but
  our Lord sent her a fever, of which prisoners are dying in the Tullianum, and
  they left her. Last evening she was unconscious, and blessed be the name of
  the Redeemer, for the sickness which has saved her from shame may save her
  from death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius placed his hand on the soldier&rsquo;s shoulder to guard himself
  from falling; but the other continued,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank the mercy of the Lord! They took and tortured Linus, but,
  seeing that he was dying, they surrendered him. They may give her now to
  thee, and Christ will give back health to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young tribune stood some time with drooping head; then raised it and
  said in a whisper,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, centurion. Christ, who saved her from shame, will save her
  from death.&rdquo; And sitting at the wall of the prison till evening, he
  returned home to send people for Linus and have him taken to one of his
  suburban villas.</p>

  <p>But when Petronius had heard everything, he determined to act also. He had
  visited the Augusta; now he went to her a second time. He found her at the
  bed of little Rufius. The child with broken head was struggling in a fever;
  his mother, with despair and terror in her heart, was trying to save him,
  thinking, however, that if she did save him it might be only to perish soon
  by a more dreadful death.</p>

  <p>Occupied exclusively with her own suffering, she would not even hear of
  Vinicius and Lygia; but Petronius terrified her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast offended,&rdquo; said he to her, &ldquo;a new, unknown
  divinity. Thou, Augusta, art a worshipper, it seems, of the Hebrew Jehovah;
  but the Christians maintain that Chrestos is his son. Reflect, then, if the
  anger of the father is not pursuing thee. Who knows but it is their vengeance
  which has struck thee? Who knows but the life of Rufius depends on
  this,&mdash;how thou wilt act?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou wish me to do?&rdquo; asked Poppæa, with terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mollify the offended deities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia is sick; influence Cæsar or Tigellinus to give her to
  Vinicius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou think that I can do that?&rdquo; asked she, in
  despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou canst do something else. If Lygia recovers, she must die. Go
  thou to the temple of Vesta, and ask the virgo magna to happen near the
  Tullianum at the moment when they are leading prisoners out to death, and
  give command to free that maiden. The chief vestal will not refuse
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if Lygia dies of the fever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Christians say that Christ is vengeful, but just; maybe thou
  wilt soften Him by thy wish alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let Him give me some sign that will heal Rufius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not come as His envoy; O divinity, I merely say to thee, Be
  on better terms with all the gods, Roman and foreign.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go!&rdquo; said Poppæa, with a broken voice.</p>

  <p>Petronius drew a deep breath. &ldquo;At last I have done something,&rdquo;
  thought he, and returning to Vinicius he said to him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Implore thy God that Lygia die not of the fever, for should she
  survive, the chief vestal will give command to free her. The Augusta herself
  will ask her to do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ will free her,&rdquo; said Vinicius, looking at him with
  eyes in which fever was glittering.</p>

  <p>Poppæa, who for the recovery of Rufius was willing to burn hecatombs to
  all the gods of the world, went that same evening through the Forum to the
  vestals, leaving care over the sick child to her faithful nurse, Silvia, by
  whom she herself had been reared.</p>

  <p>But on the Palatine sentence had been issued against the child already;
  for barely had Poppæa&rsquo;s litter vanished behind the great gate when two
  freedmen entered the chamber in which her son was resting. One of these threw
  himself on old Silvia and gagged her; the other, seizing a bronze statue of
  the Sphinx, stunned the old woman with the first blow.</p>

  <p>Then they approached Rufius. The little boy, tormented with fever and
  insensible, not knowing what was passing around him, smiled at them, and
  blinked with his beautiful eyes, as if trying to recognize the men. Stripping
  from the nurse her girdle, they put it around his neck and pulled it. The
  child called once for his mother, and died easily. Then they wound him in a
  sheet, and sitting on horses which were waiting, hurried to Ostia, where they
  threw the body into the sea.</p>

  <p>Poppæa, not finding the virgo magna, who with other vestals was at the
  house of Vatinius, returned soon to the Palatine. Seeing the empty bed and
  the cold body of Silvia, she fainted, and when they restored her she began to
  scream; her wild cries were heard all that night and the day following.</p>

  <p>But Cæsar commanded her to appear at a feast on the third day; so,
  arraying herself in an amethyst-colored tunic, she came and sat with stony
  face, golden-haired, silent, wonderful, and as ominous as an angel of
  death.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch55"
     name="ch55">CHAPTER LV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before the Flavii had reared the Colosseum, amphitheatres in
  Rome were built of wood mainly; for that reason nearly all of them had burned
  during the fire. But Nero, for the celebration of the promised games, had
  given command to build several, and among them a gigantic one, for which they
  began, immediately after the fire was extinguished, to bring by sea and the
  Tiber great trunks of trees cut on the slopes of Atlas; for the games were to
  surpass all previous ones in splendor and the number of victims.</p>

  <p>Large spaces were given therefore for people and for animals. Thousands of
  mechanics worked at the structure night and day. They built and ornamented
  without rest. Wonders were told concerning pillars inlaid with bronze, amber,
  ivory, mother of pearl, and transmarine tortoise-shells. Canals filled with
  ice-cold water from the mountains and running along the seats were to keep an
  agreeable coolness in the building, even during the greatest heat. A gigantic
  purple velarium gave shelter from the rays of the sun. Among the rows of
  seats were disposed vessels for the burning of Arabian perfumes; above them
  were fixed instruments to sprinkle the spectators with dew of saffron and
  verbena. The renowned builders Severus and Celer put forth all their skill to
  construct an amphitheatre at once incomparable and fitted for such a number
  of the curious as none of those known before had been able to
  accommodate.</p>

  <p>Hence, the day when the ludus matutinus was to begin, throngs of the
  populace were awaiting from daylight the opening of the gates, listening with
  delight to the roars of lions, the hoarse growls of panthers, and the howls
  of dogs. The beasts had not been fed for two days, but pieces of bloody flesh
  had been pushed before them to rouse their rage and hunger all the more. At
  times such a storm of wild voices was raised that people standing before the
  Circus could not converse, and the most sensitive grew pale from fear.</p>

  <p>With the rising of the sun were intoned in the enclosure of the Circus
  hymns resonant but calm. The people heard these with amazement, and said one
  to another, &ldquo;The Christians! the Christians!&rdquo; In fact, many
  detachments of Christians had been brought to the amphitheatre that night,
  and not from one place, as planned at first, but a few from each prison. It
  was known in the crowd that the spectacles would continue through weeks and
  months, but they doubted that it would be possible to finish in a single day
  those Christians who had been intended for that one occasion. The voices of
  men, women, and children singing the morning hymn were so numerous that
  spectators of experience asserted that even if one or two hundred persons
  were sent out at once, the beasts would grow tired, become sated, and not
  tear all to pieces before evening. Others declared that an excessive number
  of victims in the arena would divert attention, and not give a chance to
  enjoy the spectacle properly.</p>

  <p>As the moment drew near for opening the vomitoria, or passages which led
  to the interior, people grew animated and joyous; they discussed and disputed
  about various things touching the spectacle. Parties were formed praising the
  greater efficiency of lions or tigers in tearing. Here and there bets were
  made. Others however talked about gladiators who were to appear in the arena
  earlier than the Christians; and again there were parties, some in favor of
  Samnites, others of Gauls, others of Mirmillons, others of Thracians, others
  of the retiarii.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning larger or smaller detachments of gladiators began to
  arrive at the amphitheatre under the lead of masters, called lanistæ. Not
  wishing to be wearied too soon, they entered unarmed, often entirely naked,
  often with green boughs in their hands, or crowned with flowers, young,
  beautiful, in the light of morning, and full of life. Their bodies, shining
  from olive oil, were strong as if chiselled from marble; they roused to
  delight people who loved shapely forms. Many were known personally, and from
  moment to moment were heard: &ldquo;A greeting, Furnius! A greeting, Leo! A
  greeting, Maximus! A greeting, Diomed!&rdquo; Young maidens raised to them
  eyes full of admiration; they, selecting the maiden most beautiful, answered
  with jests, as if no care weighed on them, sending kisses, or exclaiming,
  &ldquo;Embrace me before death does!&rdquo; Then they vanished in the gates,
  through which many of them were never to come forth again.</p>

  <p>New arrivals drew away the attention of the throngs. Behind the gladiators
  came mastigophori; that is, men armed with scourges, whose office it was to
  lash and urge forward combatants. Next mules drew, in the direction of the
  spoliarium, whole rows of vehicles on which were piled wooden coffins. People
  were diverted at sight of this, inferring from the number of coffins the
  greatness of the spectacle. Now marched in men who were to kill the wounded;
  these were dressed so that each resembled Charon or Mercury. Next came those
  who looked after order in the Circus, and assigned places; after that slaves
  to bear around food and refreshments; finally, pretorians, whom every Cæsar
  had always at hand in the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>At last the vomitoria were opened, and crowds rushed to the centre. But
  such was the number of those assembled that they flowed in and flowed in for
  hours, till it was a marvel that the Circus could hold such a countless
  multitude. The roars of wild beasts, catching the exhalations of people, grew
  louder. While taking their places, the spectators made an uproar like the sea
  in time of storm.</p>

  <p>Finally, the prefect of the city came, surrounded by guards; and after
  him, in unbroken line, appeared the litters of senators, consuls, pretors,
  ediles, officials of the government and the palace, of pretorian officers,
  patricians, and exquisite ladies. Some litters were preceded by lictors
  bearing maces in bundles of rods; others by crowds of slaves. In the sun
  gleamed the gilding of the litters, the white and varied colored stuffs,
  feathers, earrings, jewels, steel of the maces. From the Circus came shouts
  with which the people greeted great dignitaries. Small divisions of
  pretorians arrived from time to time.</p>

  <p>The priests of various temples came somewhat later; only after them were
  brought in the sacred virgins of Vesta, preceded by lictors.</p>

  <p>To begin the spectacle, they were waiting now only for Cæsar, who,
  unwilling to expose the people to over-long waiting, and wishing to win them
  by promptness, came soon, in company with the Augusta and Augustians.</p>

  <p>Petronius arrived among the Augustians, having Vinicius in his litter. The
  latter knew that Lygia was sick and unconscious; but as access to the prison
  had been forbidden most strictly during the preceding days, and as the former
  guards had been replaced by new ones who were not permitted to speak with the
  jailers or even to communicate the least information to those who came to
  inquire about prisoners, he was not even sure that she was not among the
  victims intended for the first day of spectacles. They might send out even a
  sick woman for the lions, though she were unconscious. But since the victims
  were to be sewed up in skins of wild beasts and sent to the arena in crowds,
  no spectator could be certain that one more or less might not be among them,
  and no man could recognize any one. The jailers and all the servants of the
  amphitheatre had been bribed, and a bargain made with the beast-keepers to
  hide Lygia in some dark corner, and give her at night into the hands of a
  confidant of Vinicius, who would take her at once to the Alban Hills.
  Petronius, admitted to the secret, advised Vinicius to go with him openly to
  the amphitheatre, and after he had entered to disappear in the throng and
  hurry to the vaults, where, to avoid possible mistake, he was to point out
  Lygia to the guards personally.</p>

  <p>The guards admitted him through a small door by which they came out
  themselves. One of these, named Cyrus, led him at once to the Christians. On
  the way he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not, lord, that thou wilt find what thou art seeking. We
  inquired for a maiden named Lygia, but no one gave us answer; it may be,
  though, that they do not trust us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are there many?&rdquo; asked Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many, lord, had to wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are there sick ones among them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There were none who could not stand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cyrus opened a door and entered as it were an enormous chamber, but low
  and dark, for the light came in only through grated openings which separated
  it from the arena. At first Vinicius could see nothing; he heard only the
  murmur of voices in the room, and the shouts of people in the amphitheatre.
  But after a time, when his eyes had grown used to the gloom, he saw crowds of
  strange beings, resembling wolves and bears. Those were Christians sewed up
  in skins of beasts. Some of them were standing; others were kneeling in
  prayer. Here and there one might divine by the long hair flowing over the
  skin that the victim was a woman. Women, looking like wolves, carried in
  their arms children sewed up in equally shaggy coverings. But from beneath
  the skins appeared bright faces and eyes which in the darkness gleamed with
  delight and feverishness. It was evident that the greater number of those
  people were mastered by one thought, exclusive and beyond the earth,&mdash;a
  thought which during life made them indifferent to everything which happened
  around them and which could meet them. Some, when asked by Vinicius about
  Lygia, looked at him with eyes as if roused from sleep, without answering his
  questions; others smiled at him, placing a finger on their lips or pointing
  to the iron grating through which bright streaks of light entered. But here
  and there children were crying, frightened by the roaring of beasts, the
  howling of dogs, the uproar of people, and the forms of their own parents who
  looked like wild beasts. Vinicius as he walked by the side of Cyrus looked
  into faces, searched, inquired, at times stumbled against bodies of people
  who had fainted from the crowd, the stifling air, the heat, and pushed
  farther into the dark depth of the room, which seemed to be as spacious as a
  whole amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>But he stopped on a sudden, for he seemed to hear near the grating a voice
  known to him. He listened for a while, turned, and, pushing through the
  crowd, went near. Light fell on the face of the speaker, and Vinicius
  recognized under the skin of a wolf the emaciated and implacable countenance
  of Crispus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mourn for your sins!&rdquo; exclaimed Crispus, &ldquo;for the
  moment is near. But whoso thinks by death itself to redeem his sins commits a
  fresh sin, and will be hurled into endless fire. With every sin committed in
  life ye have renewed the Lord&rsquo;s suffering; how dare ye think that that
  life which awaits you will redeem this one? To-day the just and the sinner
  will die the same death; but the Lord will find His own. Woe to you, the
  claws of the lions will rend your bodies; but not your sins, nor your
  reckoning with God. The Lord showed mercy sufficient when He let Himself be
  nailed to the cross; but thenceforth He will be only the judge, who will
  leave no fault unpunished. Whoso among you has thought to extinguish his sins
  by suffering, has blasphemed against God&rsquo;s justice, and will sink all
  the deeper. Mercy is at an end, and the hour of God&rsquo;s wrath has come.
  Soon ye will stand before the awful Judge in whose presence the good will
  hardly be justified. Bewail your sins, for the jaws of hell are open; woe to
  you, husbands and wives; woe to you, parents and children.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And stretching forth his bony hands, he shook them above the bent heads;
  he was unterrified and implacable even in the presence of death, to which in
  a while all those doomed people were to go. After his words, were heard
  voices: &ldquo;We bewail our sins!&rdquo; Then came silence, and only the cry
  of children was audible, and the beating of hands against breasts.</p>

  <p>The blood of Vinicius stiffened in his veins. He, who had placed all his
  hope in the mercy of Christ, heard now that the day of wrath had come, and
  that even death in the arena would not obtain mercy. Through his head shot,
  it is true, the thought, clear and swift as lightning, that Peter would have
  spoken otherwise to those about to die. Still those terrible words of Crispus
  filled with fanaticism that dark chamber with its grating, beyond which was
  the field of torture. The nearness of that torture, and the throng of victims
  arrayed for death already, filled his soul with fear and terror. All this
  seemed to him dreadful, and a hundred times more ghastly than the bloodiest
  battle in which he had ever taken part. The odor and heat began to stifle
  him; cold sweat came out on his forehead. He was seized by fear that he would
  faint like those against whose bodies he had stumbled while searching in the
  depth of the apartment; so when he remembered that they might open the
  grating any moment, he began to call Lygia and Ursus aloud, in the hope that,
  if not they, some one knowing them would answer.</p>

  <p>In fact, some man, clothed as a bear, pulled his toga, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, they remained in prison. I was the last one brought out; I
  saw her sick on the couch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The quarryman in whose hut the Apostle baptized thee, lord. They
  imprisoned me three days ago, and to-day I die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius was relieved. When entering, he had wished to find Lygia; now he
  was ready to thank Christ that she was not there, and to see in that a sign
  of mercy. Meanwhile the quarryman pulled his toga again, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost remember, lord, that I conducted thee to the vineyard of
  Cornelius, when the Apostle discoursed in the shed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw him later, the day before they imprisoned me, He blessed me,
  and said that he would come to the amphitheatre to bless the perishing. If I
  could look at him in the moment of death and see the sign of the cross, it
  would be easier for me to die. If thou know where he is, lord, inform
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius lowered his voice, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is among the people of Petronius, disguised as a slave. I know
  not where they chose their places, but I will return to the Circus and see.
  Look thou at me when ye enter the arena. I will rise and turn my face toward
  them; then thou wilt find him with thy eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to thee, lord, and peace be with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May the Redeemer be merciful to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius went out of the cuniculum, and betook himself to the
  amphitheatre, where he had a place near Petronius among the other
  Augustians.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is she there?&rdquo; inquired Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; she remained in prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear what has occurred to me, but while listening look at Nigidia
  for example, so that we may seem to talk of her hair-dressing. Tigellinus and
  Chilo are looking at us now. Listen then. Let them put Lygia in a coffin at
  night and carry her out of the prison as a corpse; thou divinest the
  rest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Their further conversation was interrupted by Tullius Senecio, who,
  bending toward them, asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do ye know whether they will give weapons to the
  Christians?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We do not,&rdquo; answered Petronius. &ldquo;I should prefer that
  arms were given,&rdquo; said Tullius; &ldquo;if not, the arena will become
  like butcher&rsquo;s shambles too early. But what a splendid
  amphitheatre!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sight was, in truth, magnificent. The lower seats, crowded with togas
  were as white as snow. In the gilded podium sat Cæsar, wearing a diamond
  collar and a golden crown on his head; next to him sat the beautiful and
  gloomy Augusta, and on both sides were vestal virgins, great officials,
  senators with embroidered togas, officers of the army with glittering
  weapons,&mdash;in a word, all that was powerful, brilliant, and wealthy in
  Rome. In the farther rows sat knights; and higher up darkened in rows a sea
  of common heads, above which from pillar to pillar hung festoons of roses,
  lilies, ivy, and grapevines.</p>

  <p>People conversed aloud, called to one another, sang; at times they broke
  into laughter at some witty word which was sent from row to row, and they
  stamped with impatience to hasten the spectacle.</p>

  <p>At last the stamping became like thunder, and unbroken. Then the prefect
  of the city, who rode around the arena with a brilliant retinue, gave a
  signal with a handkerchief, which was answered throughout the amphitheatre by
  &ldquo;A-a-a!&rdquo; from thousands of breasts.</p>

  <p>Usually a spectacle was begun by hunts of wild beasts, in which various
  Northern and Southern barbarians excelled; but this time they had too many
  beasts, so they began with andabates,&mdash;that is, men wearing helmets
  without an opening for the eyes, hence fighting blindfold. A number of these
  came into the arena together, and slashed at random with their swords; the
  scourgers with long forks pushed some toward others to make them meet. The
  more select of the audience looked with contempt and indifference at this
  spectacle; but the crowd were amused by the awkward motions of the swordsmen.
  When it happened that they met with their shoulders, they burst out in loud
  laughter. &ldquo;To the right!&rdquo; &ldquo;To the left!&rdquo; cried they,
  misleading the opponents frequently by design. A number of pairs closed,
  however, and the struggle began to be bloody. The determined combatants cast
  aside their shields, and giving their left hands to each other, so as not to
  part again, struggled to the death with their right. Whoever fell raised his
  fingers, begging mercy by that sign; but in the beginning of a spectacle the
  audience demanded death usually for the wounded, especially in the case of
  men who had their faces covered and were unknown. Gradually the number of
  combatants decreased; and when at last only two remained, these were pushed
  together; both fell on the sand, and stabbed each other mutually. Then, amid
  cries of &ldquo;Peractum est!&rdquo; servants carried out the bodies, youths
  raked away the bloody traces on the sand and sprinkled it with leaves of
  saffron.</p>

  <p>Now a more important contest was to come,&mdash;rousing interest not only
  in the herd, but in exquisites; during this contest young patricians made
  enormous bets at times, often losing all they owned. Straightway from hand to
  hand went tablets on which were written names of favorites, and also the
  number of sestertia which each man wagered on his favorite.
  &ldquo;Spectati&rdquo;&mdash;that is, champions who had appeared already on
  the arena and gained victories&mdash;found most partisans; but among betters
  were also those who risked considerably on gladiators who were new and quite
  unknown, hoping to win immense sums should these conquer. Cæsar himself bet;
  priests, vestals, senators, knights bet; the populace bet. People of the
  crowd, when money failed them, bet their own freedom frequently. They waited
  with heart-beating and even with fear for the combatants, and more than one
  made audible vows to the gods to gain their protection for a favorite.</p>

  <p>In fact, when the shrill sound of trumpets was heard, there was a
  stillness of expectation in the amphitheatre. Thousands of eyes were turned
  to the great bolts, which a man approached dressed like Charon, and amid the
  universal silence struck three times with a hammer, as if summoning to death
  those who were hidden behind them. Then both halves of the gate opened
  slowly, showing a black gully, out of which gladiators began to appear in the
  bright arena. They came in divisions of twenty-five, Thracians, Mirmillons,
  Samnites, Gauls, each nation separately, all heavily armed; and last the
  retiarii, holding in one hand a net, in the other a trident. At sight of
  them, here and there on the benches rose applause, which soon turned into one
  immense and unbroken storm. From above to below were seen excited faces,
  clapping hands, and open mouths, from which shouts burst forth. The
  gladiators encircled the whole arena with even and springy tread, gleaming
  with their weapons and rich outfit; they halted before Cæsar&rsquo;s podium,
  proud, calm, and brilliant. The shrill sound of a horn stopped the applause;
  the combatants stretched their right hands upward, raised their eyes and
  heads toward Cæsar, and began to cry or rather to chant with drawling
  voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ave, Cæsar imperator! Morituri te salutant!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then they pushed apart quickly, occupying their places on the arena. They
  were to attack one another in whole detachments; but first it was permitted
  the most famous fencers to have a series of single combats, in which the
  strength, dexterity, and courage of opponents were best exhibited. In fact,
  from among the Gauls appeared a champion, well known to lovers of the
  amphitheatre under the name of Lanio, a victor in many games. With a great
  helmet on his head, and in mail which formed a ridge in front of his powerful
  breast and behind, he looked in the gleam of the golden arena like a giant
  beetle. The no less famous retiarius Calendio came out against him.</p>

  <p>Among the spectators people began to bet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five hundred sestertia on the Gaul!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five hundred on Calendio!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Hercules, one thousand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two thousand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Gaul, reaching the centre of the arena, began to withdraw
  with pointed sword, and, lowering his head, watched his opponent carefully
  through the opening of his visor; the light retiarius, stately, statuesque,
  wholly naked save a belt around his loins, circled quickly about his heavy
  antagonist, waving the net with graceful movement, lowering or raising his
  trident, and singing the usual song of the retiarius,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Non te peto, piscem peto; Quid me fugis, Galle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>["I seek not thee, I seek a fish; Why flee from me O Gaul?&rdquo;]</p>

  <p>But the Gaul was not fleeing, for after a while he stopped, and standing
  in one place began to turn with barely a slight movement, so as to have his
  enemy always in front, in his form and monstrously large head there was now
  something terrible. The spectators understood perfectly that that heavy body
  encased in bronze was preparing for a sudden throw to decide the battle. The
  retiarius meanwhile sprang up to him, then sprang away, making with his
  three-toothed fork motions so quick that the eye hardly followed them. The
  sound of the teeth on the shield was heard repeatedly; but the Gaul did not
  quiver, giving proof by this of his gigantic strength. All his attention
  seemed fixed, not on the trident, but the net which was circling above his
  head, like a bird of ill omen. The spectators held the breath in their
  breasts, and followed the masterly play of the gladiators. The Gaul waited,
  chose the moment, and rushed at last on his enemy; the latter with equal
  quickness shot past under his sword, straightened himself with raised arm,
  and threw the net.</p>

  <p>The Gaul, turning where he stood, caught it on his shield; then both
  sprang apart. In the amphitheatre shouts of &ldquo;Macte!&rdquo; thundered;
  in the lower rows they began to make new bets. Cæsar himself, who at first
  had been talking with Rubria, and so far had not paid much attention to the
  spectacle, turned his head toward the arena.</p>

  <p>They began to struggle again, so regularly and with such precision in
  their movements, that sometimes it seemed that with them it was not a
  question of life or death, but of exhibiting skill. The Gaul escaping twice
  more from the net, pushed toward the edge of the arena; those who held bets
  against him, not wishing the champion to rest, began to cry, &ldquo;Bear
  on!&rdquo; The Gaul obeyed, and attacked. The arm of the retiarius was
  covered on a sudden with blood, and his net dropped. The Gaul summoned his
  strength, and sprang forward to give the final blow. That instant Calendio,
  who feigned inability to wield the net, sprang aside, escaped the thrust, ran
  the trident between the knees of his opponent, and brought him to the
  earth.</p>

  <p>The Gaul tried to rise, but in a twinkle he was covered by the fatal
  meshes, in which he was entangled more and more by every movement of his feet
  and hands. Meanwhile stabs of the trident fixed him time after time to the
  earth. He made one more effort, rested on his arm, and tried to rise; in
  vain! He raised to his head his falling hand which could hold the sword no
  longer, and fell on his back. Calendio pressed his neck to the ground with
  the trident, and, resting both hands on the handle of it, turned toward
  Cæsar&rsquo;s box.</p>

  <p>The whole Circus was trembling from plaudits and the roar of people. For
  those who had bet on Calendio he was at that moment greater than Cæsar; but
  for this very reason animosity against the Gaul vanished from their hearts.
  At the cost of his blood he had filled their purses. The voices of the
  audience were divided. On the upper seats half the signs were for death, and
  half for mercy; but the retiarius looked only at the box of Cæsar and the
  vestals, waiting for what they would decide.</p>

  <p>To the misfortune of the fallen gladiator, Nero did not like him, for at
  the last games before the fire he had bet against the Gaul, and had lost
  considerable sums to Licinus; hence he thrust his hand out of the podium, and
  turned his thumb toward the earth.</p>

  <p>The vestals supported the sign at once. Calendio knelt on the breast of
  the Gaul, drew a short knife from his belt, pushed apart the armor around the
  neck of his opponent, and drove the three-edged blade into his throat to the
  handle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peractum est!&rdquo; sounded voices in the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>The Gaul quivered a time, like a stabbed bullock, dug the sand with his
  heels, stretched, and was motionless.</p>

  <p>Mercury had no need to try with heated iron if he were living yet. He was
  hidden away quickly, and other pairs appeared. After them came a battle of
  whole detachments. The audience took part in it with soul, heart, and eyes.
  They howled, roared, whistled, applauded, laughed, urged on the combatants,
  grew wild. The gladiators on the arena, divided into two legions, fought with
  the rage of wild beasts; breast struck breast, bodies were intertwined in a
  death grapple, strong limbs cracked in their joints, swords were buried in
  breasts and in stomachs, pale lips threw blood on to the sand. Toward the end
  such terrible fear seized some novices that, tearing themselves from the
  turmoil, they fled; but the scourgers drove them back again quickly to the
  battle with lashes tipped with lead. On the sand great dark spots were
  formed; more and more naked and armed bodies lay stretched like grain
  sheaves. The living fought on the corpses; they struck against armor and
  shields, cut their feet against broken weapons, and fell. The audience lost
  self-command from delight; and intoxicated with death breathed it, sated
  their eyes with the sight of it, and drew into their lungs the exhalations of
  it with ecstasy.</p>

  <p>The conquered lay dead, almost every man. Barely a few wounded knelt in
  the middle of the arena, and trembling stretched their hands to the audience
  with a prayer for mercy. To the victors were given rewards,&mdash;crowns,
  olive wreaths. And a moment of rest came, which, at command of the
  all-powerful Cæsar, was turned into a feast. Perfumes were burned in vases.
  Sprinklers scattered saffron and violet rain on the people. Cooling drinks
  were served, roasted meats, sweet cakes, wine, olives, and fruits. The people
  devoured, talked, and shouted in honor of Cæsar, to incline him to greater
  bounteousness. When hunger and thirst had been satisfied, hundreds of slaves
  bore around baskets full of gifts, from which boys, dressed as Cupids, took
  various objects and threw them with both hands among the seats. When lottery
  tickets were distributed, a battle began. People crowded, threw, trampled one
  another; cried for rescue, sprang over rows of seats, stifled one another in
  the terrible crush, since whoever got a lucky number might win possibly a
  house with a garden, a slave, a splendid dress, or a wild beast which he
  could sell to the amphitheatre afterward. For this reason there were such
  disorders that frequently the pretorians had to interfere; and after every
  distribution they carried out people with broken arms or legs, and some were
  even trampled to death in the throng.</p>

    <p class="caption">A Naval Battle in a Roman Arena.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>But the more wealthy took no part in the fight for tesseræ. The Augustians
  amused themselves now with the spectacle of Chilo, and with making sport of
  his vain efforts to show that he could look at fighting and blood- spilling
  as well as any man. But in vain did the unfortunate Greek wrinkle his brow,
  gnaw his lips, and squeeze his fists till the nails entered his palms. His
  Greek nature and his personal cowardice were unable to endure such sights.
  His face grew pale, his forehead was dotted with drops of sweat, his lips
  were blue, his eyes turned in, his teeth began to chatter, and a trembling
  seized his body. At the end of the battle he recovered somewhat; but when
  they attacked him with tongues, sudden anger seized him, and he defended
  himself desperately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha, Greek! the sight of torn skin on a man is beyond thy
  strength!&rdquo; said Vatinius, taking him by the beard.</p>

  <p>Chilo bared his last two yellow teeth at him and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father was not a cobbler, so I cannot mend it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Macte! habet (Good! he has caught it!)&rdquo; called a number of
  voices; but others jeered on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is not to blame that instead of a heart he has a piece of cheese
  in his breast,&rdquo; said Senecio.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art not to blame that instead of a head thou hast a
  bladder,&rdquo; retorted Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe thou wilt become a gladiator! thou wouldst look well with a
  net on the arena.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I should catch thee in it, I should catch a stinking
  hoopoe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how will it be with the Christians?&rdquo; asked Festus, from
  Liguria. &ldquo;Wouldst thou not like to be a dog and bite them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should not like to be thy brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou Mæotian copper-nose!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou Ligurian mule!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy skin is itching, evidently, but I don&rsquo;t advise thee to
  ask me to scratch it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scratch thyself. If thou scratch thy own pimple, thou wilt destroy
  what is best in thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And in this manner they attacked him. He defended himself venomously, amid
  universal laughter. Cæsar, clapping his hands, repeated, &ldquo;Macte!&rdquo;
  and urged them on. After a while Petronius approached, and, touching the
  Greek&rsquo;s shoulder with his carved ivory cane, said coldly,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is well, philosopher; but in one thing thou hast blundered:
  the gods created thee a pickpocket, and thou hast become a demon. That is why
  thou canst not endure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man looked at him with his red eyes, but this time somehow he did
  not find a ready insult. He was silent for a moment; then answered, as if
  with a certain effort,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall endure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the trumpets announced the end of the interval. People began to
  leave the passages where they had assembled to straighten their legs and
  converse. A general movement set in with the usual dispute about seats
  occupied previously. Senators and patricians hastened to their places. The
  uproar ceased after a time, and the amphitheatre returned to order. On the
  arena a crowd of people appeared whose work was to dig out here and there
  lumps of sand formed with stiffened blood.</p>

  <p>The turn of the Christians was at hand. But since that was a new spectacle
  for people, and no one knew how the Christians would bear themselves, all
  waited with a certain curiosity. The disposition of the audience was
  attentive but unfriendly; they were waiting for uncommon scenes. Those people
  who were to appear had burned Rome and its ancient treasures. They had drunk
  the blood of infants, and poisoned water; they had cursed the whole human
  race, and committed the vilest crimes. The harshest punishment did not
  suffice the roused hatred; and if any fear possessed people&rsquo;s hearts,
  it was this: that the torture of the Christians would not equal the guilt of
  those ominous criminals.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sun had risen high; its rays, passing through the purple
  velarium, had filled the amphitheatre with blood-colored light. The sand
  assumed a fiery hue, and in those gleams, in the faces of people, as well as
  in the empty arena, which after a time was to be filled with the torture of
  people and the rage of savage beasts, there was something terrible. Death and
  terror seemed hovering in the air. The throng, usually gladsome, became moody
  under the influence of hate and silence. Faces had a sullen expression.</p>

  <p>Now the prefect gave a sign. The same old man appeared, dressed as Charon,
  who had called the gladiators to death, and, passing with slow step across
  the arena amid silence, he struck three times again on the door.</p>

  <p>Throughout the amphitheatre was heard the deep murmur,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Christians! the Christians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The iron gratings creaked; through the dark openings were heard the usual
  cries of the scourgers, &ldquo;To the sand!&rdquo; and in one moment the
  arena was peopled with crowds as it were of satyrs covered with skins. All
  ran quickly, somewhat feverishly, and, reaching the middle of the circle,
  they knelt one by another with raised heads. The spectators, judging this to
  be a prayer for pity, and enraged by such cowardice, began to stamp, whistle,
  throw empty wine-vessels, bones from which the flesh had been eaten, and
  shout, &ldquo;The beasts! the beasts!&rdquo; But all at once something
  unexpected took place. From out the shaggy assembly singing voices were
  raised, and then sounded that hymn heard for the first time in a Roman
  amphitheatre, &ldquo;Christus regnat!&rdquo; ["Christ reigns!&rdquo;]</p>

  <p><a id="pic6a"

    <p class="caption">The Christian martyrs enter the arena. From a painting
    by F. Benouille.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Astonishment seized the spectators. The condemned sang with eyes raised to
  the velarium. The audience saw faces pale, but as it were inspired. All
  understood that those people were not asking for mercy, and that they seemed
  not to see the Circus, the audience, the Senate, or Cæsar. &ldquo;Christus
  regnat!&rdquo; rose ever louder, and in the seats, far up to the highest,
  among the rows of spectators, more than one asked himself the question,
  &ldquo;What is happening, and who is that Christus who reigns in the mouths
  of those people who are about to die?&rdquo; But meanwhile a new grating was
  opened, and into the arena rushed, with mad speed and barking, whole packs of
  dogs,&mdash;gigantic, yellow Molossians from the Peloponnesus, pied dogs from
  the Pyrenees, and wolf-like hounds from Hibernia, purposely famished; their
  sides lank, and their eyes bloodshot. Their howls and whines filled the
  amphitheatre. When the Christians had finished their hymn, they remained
  kneeling, motionless, as if petrified, merely repeating in one groaning
  chorus, &ldquo;Pro Christo! Pro Christo!&rdquo; The dogs, catching the odor
  of people under the skins of beasts, and surprised by their silence, did not
  rush on them at once. Some stood against the walls of the boxes, as if
  wishing to go among the spectators; others ran around barking furiously, as
  though chasing some unseen beast. The people were angry. A thousand voices
  began to call; some howled like wild beasts; some barked like dogs; others
  urged them on in every language. The amphitheatre was trembling from uproar.
  The excited dogs began to run to the kneeling people, then to draw back,
  snapping their teeth, till at last one of the Molossians drove his teeth into
  the shoulder of a woman kneeling in front, and dragged her under him.</p>

  <p>Tens of dogs rushed into the crowd now, as if to break through it. The
  audience ceased to howl, so as to look with greater attention. Amidst the
  howling and whining were heard yet plaintive voices of men and women:
  &ldquo;Pro Christo! Pro Christo!&rdquo; but on the arena were formed
  quivering masses of the bodies of dogs and people. Blood flowed in streams
  from the torn bodies. Dogs dragged from each other the bloody limbs of
  people. The odor of blood and torn entrails was stronger than Arabian
  perfumes, and filled the whole Circus.</p>

  <p>At last only here and there were visible single kneeling forms, which were
  soon covered by moving squirming masses.</p>

  <p>Vinicius, who at the moment when the Christians ran in, stood up and
  turned so as to indicate to the quarryman, as he had promised, the direction
  in which the Apostle was hidden among the people of Petronius, sat down
  again, and with the face of a dead man continued to look with glassy eyes on
  the ghastly spectacle. At first fear that the quarryman might have been
  mistaken, and that perchance Lygia was among the victims, benumbed him
  completely; but when he heard the voices, &ldquo;Pro Christo!&rdquo; when he
  saw the torture of so many victims who, in dying, confessed their faith and
  their God, another feeling possessed him, piercing him like the most dreadful
  pain, but irresistible. That feeling was this,&mdash;if Christ Himself died
  in torment, if thousands are perishing for Him now, if a sea of blood is
  poured forth, one drop more signifies nothing, and it is a sin even to ask
  for mercy. That thought came to him from the arena, penetrated him with the
  groans of the dying, with the odor of their blood. But still he prayed and
  repeated with parched lips, &ldquo;O Christ! O Christ! and Thy Apostle prayed
  for her!&rdquo; Then he forgot himself, lost consciousness of where he was.
  It seemed to him that blood on the arena was rising and rising, that it was
  coming up and flowing out of the Circus over all Rome. For the rest he heard
  nothing, neither the howling of dogs nor the uproar of the people nor the
  voices of the Augustians, who began all at once to cry,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo has fainted!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo has fainted!&rdquo; said Petronius, turning toward the
  Greek.</p>

  <p>And he had fainted really; he sat there white as linen, his head fallen
  back, his mouth wide open, like that of a corpse.</p>

  <p>At that same moment they were urging into the arena new victims, sewed up
  in skins.</p>

  <p>These knelt immediately, like those who had gone before; but the weary
  dogs would not rend them. Barely a few threw themselves on to those kneeling
  nearest; but others lay down, and, raising their bloody jaws, began to
  scratch their sides and yawn heavily.</p>

  <p>Then the audience, disturbed in spirit, but drunk with blood and wild,
  began to cry with hoarse voices,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The lions! the lions! Let out the lions!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lions were to be kept for the next day; but in the amphitheatres the
  people imposed their will on every one, even on Cæsar. Caligula alone,
  insolent and changeable in his wishes, dared to oppose them, and there were
  cases when he gave command to beat the people with clubs; but even he yielded
  most frequently. Nero, to whom plaudits were dearer than all else in the
  world, never resisted. All the more did he not resist now, when it was a
  question of mollifying the populace, excited after the conflagration, and a
  question of the Christians, on whom he wished to cast the blame of the
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>He gave the sign therefore to open the cuniculum, seeing which, the people
  were calmed in a moment. They heard the creaking of the doors behind which
  were the lions. At sight of the lions the dogs gathered with low whines, on
  the opposite side of the arena. The lions walked into the arena one after
  another, immense, tawny, with great shaggy heads. Cæsar himself turned his
  wearied face toward them, and placed the emerald to his eye to see better.
  The Augustians greeted them with applause; the crowd counted them on their
  fingers, and followed eagerly the impression which the sight of them would
  make on the Christians kneeling in the centre, who again had begun to repeat
  the words, without meaning for many, though annoying to all, &ldquo;Pro
  Christo! Pro Christo!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the lions, though hungry, did not hasten to their victims. The ruddy
  light in the arena dazzled them and they half closed their eyes as if dazed.
  Some stretched their yellowish bodies lazily; some, opening their jaws,
  yawned,&mdash;one might have said that they wanted to show their terrible
  teeth to the audience. But later the odor of blood and torn bodies, many of
  which were lying on the sand, began to act on them. Soon their movements
  became restless, their manes rose, their nostrils drew in the air with hoarse
  sound. One fell suddenly on the body of a woman with a torn face, and, lying
  with his fore paws on the body, licked with a rough tongue the stiffened
  blood: another approached a man who was holding in his arms a child sewed up
  in a fawn&rsquo;s skin.</p>

  <p>The child, trembling from crying, and weeping, clung convulsively to the
  neck of its father; he, to prolong its life even for a moment, tried to pull
  it from his neck, so as to hand it to those kneeling farther on. But the cry
  and the movement irritated the lion. All at once he gave out a short, broken
  roar, killed the child with one blow of his paw, and seizing the head of the
  father in his jaws, crushed it in a twinkle.</p>

  <p>At sight of this all the other lions fell upon the crowd of Christians.
  Some women could not restrain cries of terror; but the audience drowned these
  with plaudits, which soon ceased, however, for the wish to see gained the
  mastery. They beheld terrible things then: heads disappearing entirely in
  open jaws, breasts torn apart with one blow, hearts and lungs swept away; the
  crushing of bones under the teeth of lions. Some lions, seizing victims by
  the ribs or loins, ran with mad springs through the arena, as if seeking
  hidden places in which to devour them; others fought, rose on their hind
  legs, grappled one another like wrestlers, and filled the amphitheatre with
  thunder. People rose from their places. Some left their seats, went down
  lower through the passages to see better, and crowded one another mortally.
  It seemed that the excited multitude would throw itself at last into the
  arena, and rend the Christians in company with the lions. At moments an
  unearthly noise was heard; at moments applause; at moments roaring, rumbling,
  the clashing of teeth, the howling of Molossian dogs; at times only
  groans.</p>

  <p>Cæsar, holding the emerald to his eye, looked now with attention. The face
  of Petronius assumed an expression of contempt and disgust. Chilo had been
  borne out of the Circus.</p>

  <p>But from the cuniculum new victims were driven forth continually.</p>

  <p>From the highest row in the amphitheatre the Apostle Peter looked at them.
  No one saw him, for all heads were turned to the arena; so he rose and as
  formerly in the vineyard of Cornelius he had blessed for death and eternity
  those who were intended for imprisonment, so now he blessed with the cross
  those who were perishing under the teeth of wild beasts. He blessed their
  blood, their torture, their dead bodies turned into shapeless masses, and
  their souls flying away from the bloody sand. Some raised their eyes to him,
  and their faces grew radiant; they smiled when they saw high above them the
  sign of the cross. But his heart was rent, and he said, &ldquo;O Lord! let
  Thy will be done. These my sheep perish to Thy glory in testimony of the
  truth. Thou didst command me to feed them; hence I give them to Thee, and do
  Thou count them, Lord, take them, heal their wounds, soften their pain, give
  them happiness greater than the torments which they suffered here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he blessed them one after another, crowd after crowd, with as much
  love as if they had been his children whom he was giving directly into the
  hands of Christ. Then Cæsar, whether from madness, or the wish that the
  exhibition should surpass everything seen in Rome so far, whispered a few
  words to the prefect of the city. He left the podium and went at once to the
  cuniculum. Even the populace were astonished when, after a while, they saw
  the gratings open again. Beasts of all kinds were let out this
  time,&mdash;tigers from the Euphrates, Numidian panthers, bears, wolves,
  hyenas, and jackals. The whole arena was covered as with a moving sea of
  striped, yellow, flax-colored, dark-brown, and spotted skins. There rose a
  chaos in which the eye could distinguish nothing save a terrible turning and
  twisting of the backs of wild beasts. The spectacle lost the appearance of
  reality, and became as it were an orgy of blood, a dreadful dream, a gigantic
  kaleidoscope of mad fancy. The measure was surpassed. Amidst roars, howls,
  whines, here and there on the seats of the spectators were heard the
  terrified and spasmodic laughter of women, whose strength had given way at
  last. The people were terrified. Faces grew dark. Various voices began to
  cry, &ldquo;Enough! enough!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But it was easier to let the beasts in than drive them back again. Cæsar,
  however, found a means of clearing the arena, and a new amusement for the
  people. In all the passages between the seats appeared detachments of
  Numidians, black and stately, in feathers and earrings, with bows in their
  hands. The people divined what was coming, and greeted the archers with a
  shout of delight. The Numidians approached the railing, and, putting their
  arrows to the strings, began to shoot from their bows into the crowd of
  beasts. That was a new spectacle truly. Their bodies, shapely as if cut from
  dark marble, bent backward, stretched the flexible bows, and sent bolt after
  bolt. The whizzing of the strings and the whistling of the feathered missiles
  were mingled with the howling of beasts and cries of wonder from the
  audience. Wolves, bears, panthers, and people yet alive fell side by side.
  Here and there a lion, feeling a shaft in his ribs, turned with sudden
  movement, his jaws wrinkled from rage, to seize and break the arrow. Others
  groaned from pain. The small beasts, falling into a panic, ran around the
  arena at random, or thrust their heads into the grating; meanwhile the arrows
  whizzed and whizzed on, till all that was living had lain down in the final
  quiver of death.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of slaves rushed into the arena armed with spades, shovels,
  brooms, wheelbarrows, baskets for carrying out entrails, and bags of sand.
  They came, crowd after crowd, and over the whole circle there seethed up a
  feverish activity. The space was soon cleared of bodies, blood, and mire, dug
  over, made smooth, and sprinkled with a thick layer of fresh sand. That done,
  Cupids ran in, scattering leaves of roses, lilies, and the greatest variety
  of flowers. The censers were ignited again, and the velarium was removed, for
  the sun had sunk now considerably. But people looked at one another with
  amazement, and inquired what kind of new spectacle was waiting for them on
  that day.</p>

  <p>Indeed, such a spectacle was waiting as no one had looked for. Cæsar, who
  had left the podium some time before, appeared all at once on the flowery
  arena, wearing a purple mantle, and a crown of gold. Twelve choristers
  holding citharæ followed him. He had a silver lute, and advanced with solemn
  tread to the middle, bowed a number of times to the spectators, raised his
  eyes, and stood as if waiting for inspiration.</p>

  <p>Then he struck the strings and began to sing,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O radiant son of Leto, Ruler of Tenedos, Chilos, Chrysos, Art thou
  he who, having in his care The sacred city of Ilion, Could yield it to Argive
  anger, And suffer sacred altars, Which blazed unceasingly to his honor, To be
  stained with Trojan blood? Aged men raised trembling hands to thee, O thou of
  the far-shooting silver bow, Mothers from the depth of their breasts Raised
  tearful cries to thee, Imploring pity on their offspring. Those complaints
  might have moved a stone, But to the suffering of people Thou, O Smintheus,
  wert less feeling than a stone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The song passed gradually into an elegy, plaintive and full of pain. In
  the Circus there was silence. After a while Cæsar, himself affected, sang
  on,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With the sound of thy heavenly lyre Thou couldst drown the wailing,
  The lament of hearts. At the sad sound of this song The eye to-day is filled
  with tears, As a flower is filled with dew, But who can raise from dust and
  ashes That day of fire, disaster, ruin? O Smintheus, where wert thou
  then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here his voice quivered and his eyes grew moist. Tears appeared on the
  lids of the vestals; the people listened in silence before they burst into a
  long unbroken storm of applause.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile from outside through the vomitoria came the sound of creaking
  vehicles on which were placed the bloody remnants of Christians, men, women,
  and children, to be taken to the pits called &ldquo;puticuli.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the Apostle Peter seized his trembling white head with his hands, and
  cried in spirit,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Lord, O Lord! to whom hast Thou given rule over the earth, and
  why wilt Thou found in this place Thy capital?&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch56"
     name="ch56">CHAPTER LVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The sun had lowered toward its setting, and seemed to
  dissolve in the red of the evening. The spectacle was finished. Crowds were
  leaving the amphitheatre and pouring out to the city through the passages
  called vomitoria. Only Augustians delayed; they were waiting for the stream
  of people to pass. They had all left their seats and assembled at the podium,
  in which Cæsar appeared again to hear praises. Though the spectators had not
  spared plaudits at the end of the song, Nero was not satisfied; he had looked
  for enthusiasm touching on frenzy. In vain did hymns of praise sound in his
  ears; in vain did vestals kiss his &ldquo;divine&rdquo; hand, and while doing
  so Rubria bent till her reddish hair touched his breast. Nero was not
  satisfied, and could not hide the fact. He was astonished and also disturbed
  because Petronius was silent. Some flattering and pointed word from his mouth
  would have been a great consolation at that moment. Unable at last to
  restrain himself, Cæsar beckoned to the arbiter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said he, when Petronius entered the podium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am silent,&rdquo; answered Petronius, coldly, &ldquo;for I cannot
  find words. Thou hast surpassed thyself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it seemed to me too; but still this people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Canst thou expect mongrels to appreciate poetry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But thou too hast noticed that they have not thanked me as I
  deserve.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because thou hast chosen a bad moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When men&rsquo;s brains are filled with the odor of blood, they
  cannot listen attentively.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, those Christians!&rdquo; replied Nero, clenching his fists.
  &ldquo;They burned Rome, and injure me now in addition. What new punishment
  shall I invent for them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius saw that he had taken the wrong road, that his words had
  produced an effect the very opposite of what he intended; so, to turn
  Cæsar&rsquo;s mind in another direction, he bent toward him and
  whispered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy song is marvellous, but I will make one remark: in the fourth
  line of the third strophe the metre leaves something to be
  desired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero, blushing with shame, as if caught in a disgraceful deed, had fear in
  his look, and answered in a whisper also,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou seest everything. I know. I will re-write that. But no one
  else noticed it, I think. And do thou, for the love of the gods, mention it
  to no one,&mdash;if life is dear to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To this Petronius answered, as if in an outburst of vexation and
  anger,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Condemn me to death, O divinity, if I deceive thee; but thou wilt
  not terrify me, for the gods know best of all if I fear death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And while speaking he looked straight into Cæsar&rsquo;s eyes, who
  answered after a while,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be not angry; thou knowest that I love thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A bad sign!&rdquo; thought Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to invite thee to-day to a feast,&rdquo; continued Nero,
  &ldquo;but I prefer to shut myself in and polish that cursed line in the
  third strophe. Besides thee Seneca may have noticed it, and perhaps Secundus
  Carinas did; but I will rid myself of them quickly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he summoned Seneca, and declared that with Acratus and Secundus
  Carinas, he sent him to the Italian and all other provinces for money, which
  he commanded him to obtain from cities, villages, famous temples,&mdash;in a
  word, from every place where it was possible to find money, or from which
  they could force it. But Seneca, who saw that Cæsar was confiding to him a
  work of plunder, sacrilege, and robbery, refused straightway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must go to the country, lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and await
  death, for I am old and my nerves are sick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seneca&rsquo;s Iberian nerves were stronger than Chilos; they were not
  sick, perhaps, but in general his health was bad, for he seemed like a
  shadow, and recently his hair had grown white altogether.</p>

  <p>Nero, too, when he looked at him, thought that he would not have to wait
  long for the man&rsquo;s death, and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not expose thee to a journey if thou art ill, but through
  affection I wish to keep thee near me. Instead of going to the country, then,
  thou wilt stay in thy own house, and not leave it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he laughed, and said, &ldquo;If I send Acratus and Carinas by
  themselves, it will be like sending wolves for sheep. Whom shall I set above
  them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me, lord,&rdquo; said Domitius Afer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! I have no wish to draw on Rome the wrath of Mercury, whom ye
  would put to shame with your villainy. I need some stoic like Seneca, or like
  my new friend, the philosopher Chilo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he looked around, and asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what has happened to Chilo?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo, who had recovered in the open air and returned to the amphitheatre
  for Cæsar&rsquo;s song, pushed up, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am here, O Radiant Offspring of the sun and moon. I was ill, but
  thy song has restored me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will send thee to Achæa,&rdquo; said Nero. &ldquo;Thou must know
  to a copper how much there is in each temple there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do so, O Zeus, and the gods will give thee such tribute as they
  have never given any one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would, but I do not like to prevent thee from seeing the
  games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baal!&rdquo; said Chilo.</p>

  <p>The Augustians, delighted that Cæsar had regained humor, fell to laughing,
  and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord, deprive not this valiant Greek of a sight of the
  games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But preserve me, O lord, from the sight of these noisy geese of the
  Capitol, whose brains put together would not fill a nutshell,&rdquo; retorted
  Chilo. &ldquo;O first-born of Apollo, I am writing a Greek hymn in thy honor,
  and I wish to spend a few days in the temple of the Muses to implore
  inspiration.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Nero. &ldquo;It is thy wish to escape
  future games. Nothing will come of that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I swear to thee, lord, that I am writing a hymn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then thou wilt write it at night. Beg inspiration of Diana, who, by
  the way, is a sister of Apollo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo dropped his head and looked with malice on those present, who began
  to laugh again. Cæsar, turning to Senecio and Suilius Nerulinus,
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Imagine, of the Christians appointed for to-day we have been able
  to finish hardly half!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this old Aquilus Regulus, who had great knowledge of everything
  touching the amphitheatre, thought a while, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spectacles in which people appear sine armis et sine arte last
  almost as long and are less entertaining.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will command to give them weapons,&rdquo; answered Nero.</p>

  <p>But the superstitious Vestinius was roused from meditation at once, and
  asked in a mysterious voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have ye noticed that when dying they see something? They look up,
  and die as it were without pain. I am sure that they see
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes then to the opening of the amphitheatre, over which
  night had begun to extend its velarium dotted with stars. But others answered
  with laughter and jesting suppositions as to what the Christians could see at
  the moment of death. Meanwhile Cæsar gave a signal to the slave torch-
  bearers, and left the Circus; after him followed vestals, senators,
  dignitaries, and Augustians.</p>

  <p>The night was clear and warm. Before the Circus were moving throngs of
  people, curious to witness the departure of Cæsar; but in some way they were
  gloomy and silent. Here and there applause was heard, but it ceased quickly.
  From the spoliarium creaking carts bore away the bloody remnants of
  Christians.</p>

  <p>Petronius and Vinicius passed over their road in silence. Only when near
  his villa did Petronius inquire,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou thought of what I told thee?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have,&rdquo;
  answered Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost believe that for me too this is a question of the highest
  importance? I must liberate her in spite of Cæsar and Tigellinus. This is a
  kind of battle in which I have undertaken to conquer, a kind of play in which
  I wish to win, even at the cost of my life. This day has confirmed me still
  more in my plan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Christ reward thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus conversing, they stopped at the door of the villa and descended from
  the litter. At that moment a dark figure approached them, and
  asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is the noble Vinicius here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; answered the tribune. &ldquo;What is thy
  wish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Nazarius, the son of Miriam. I come from the prison, and bring
  tidings of Lygia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius placed his hand on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder and looked into
  his eyes by the torchlight, without power to speak a word, but Nazarius
  divined the question which was dying on his lips, and replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is living yet. Ursus sent me to say that she prays in her
  fever, and repeats thy name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Praise be to Christ, who has power to restore her to me,&rdquo;
  said Vinicius. He conducted Nazarius to the library, and after a while
  Petronius came in to hear their conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sickness saved her from shame, for executioners are timid,&rdquo;
  said the youth. &ldquo;Ursus and Glaucus the physician watch over her night
  and day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are the guards the same?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are, and she is in their chamber. All the prisoners in the
  lower dungeon died of fever, or were stifled from foul air.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; inquired Petronins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The noble Vinicius knows me. I am the son of that widow with whom
  Lygia lodged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And a Christian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The youth looked with inquiring glance at Vinicius, but, seeing him in
  prayer, he raised his head, and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How canst thou enter the prison freely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hired myself to carry out corpses; I did so to assist my brethren
  and bring them news from the city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius looked more attentively at the comely face of the youth, his
  blue eyes, and dark, abundant hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From what country art thou, youth?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a Galilean, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wouldst thou like to see Lygia free?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The youth raised his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, even had I to die
  afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Vinicius ceased to pray, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell the guards to place her in a coffin as if she were dead. Thou
  wilt find assistants to bear her out in the night with thee. Near the
  &rsquo;Putrid Pits&rsquo; will be people with a litter waiting for you; to
  them ye will give the coffin. Promise the guards from me as much gold as each
  can carry in his mantle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While speaking, his face lost its usual torpor, and in him was roused the
  soldier to whom hope had restored his former energy.</p>

  <p>Nazarius was flushed with delight, and, raising his hands, he
  exclaimed,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Christ give her health, for she will be free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou think that the guards will consent?&rdquo; inquired
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They, lord? Yes, if they know that punishment and torture will not
  touch them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The guards would consent to her flight; all the more will they let
  us bear her out as a corpse,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a man, it is true,&rdquo; said Nazarius, &ldquo;who burns
  with red-hot iron to see if the bodies which we carry out are dead. But he
  will take even a few sestertia not to touch the face of the dead with iron.
  For one aureus he will touch the coffin, not the body.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell him that he will get a cap full of aurei,&rdquo; said
  Petronius. &ldquo;But canst thou find reliable assistants?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can find men who would sell their own wives and children for
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where wilt thou find them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the prison itself or in the city. Once the guards are paid, they
  will admit whomever I like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case take me as a hired servant,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>But Petronius opposed this most earnestly. &ldquo;The pretorians might
  recognize thee even in disguise, and all would be lost. Go neither to the
  prison nor the &lsquo;Putrid Pits.&rsquo; All, including Cæsar and
  Tigellinus, should be convinced that she died; otherwise they will order
  immediate pursuit. We can lull suspicion only in this way: When she is taken
  to the Alban Hills or farther, to Sicily, we shall be in Rome. A week or two
  later thou wilt fall ill, and summon Nero&rsquo;s physician; he will tell
  thee to go to the mountains. Thou and she will meet, and
  afterward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he thought a while; then, waving his hand, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Other times may come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Christ have mercy on her,&rdquo; said Vinicius. &ldquo;Thou art
  speaking of Sicily, while she is sick and may die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us keep her nearer Rome at first. The air alone will restore
  her, if only we snatch her from the dungeon. Hast thou no manager in the
  mountains whom thou canst trust?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Vinicius, hurriedly. &ldquo;Near Corioli is
  a reliable man who carried me in his arms when I was a child, and who loves
  me yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Write to him to come to-morrow,&rdquo; said Petronius, handing
  Vinicius tablets. &ldquo;I will send a courier at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He called the chief of the atrium then, and gave the needful orders. A few
  minutes later, a mounted slave was coursing in the night toward Corioli.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would please me were Ursus to accompany her,&rdquo; said
  Vinicius. &ldquo;I should be more at rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Nazarius, &ldquo;that is a man of superhuman
  strength; he can break gratings and follow her. There is one window above a
  steep, high rock where no guard is placed. I will take Ursus a rope; the rest
  he will do himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Hercules!&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;let him tear himself out
  as he pleases, but not at the same time with her, and not two or three days
  later, for they would follow him and discover her hiding-place. By Hercules!
  do ye wish to destroy yourselves and her? I forbid you to name Corioli to
  him, or I wash my hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both recognized the justice of these words, and were silent. Nazarius took
  leave, promising to come the next morning at daybreak.</p>

  <p>He hoped to finish that night with the guards, but wished first to run in
  to see his mother, who in that uncertain and dreadful time had no rest for a
  moment thinking of her son. After some thought he had determined not to seek
  an assistant in the city, but to find and bribe one from among his fellow
  corpse-bearers. When going, he stopped, and, taking Vinicius aside,
  whispered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not mention our plan to any one, not even to my mother, but
  the Apostle Peter promised to come from the amphitheatre to our house; I will
  tell him everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here thou canst speak openly,&rdquo; replied Vinicius. &ldquo;The
  Apostle was in the amphitheatre with the people of Petronius. But I will go
  with you myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He gave command to bring him a slave&rsquo;s mantle, and they passed out.
  Petronius sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wished her to die of that fever,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;since
  that would have been less terrible for Vinicius. But now I am ready to offer
  a golden tripod to Esculapius for her health. Ah! Ahenobarbus, thou hast the
  wish to turn a lover&rsquo;s pain into a spectacle; thou, Augusta, wert
  jealous of the maiden&rsquo;s beauty, and wouldst devour her alive because
  thy Rufius has perished. Thou, Tigellinus, wouldst destroy her to spite me!
  We shall see. I tell you that your eyes will not behold her on the arena, for
  she will either die her own death, or I shall wrest her from you as from the
  jaws of dogs, and wrest her in such fashion that ye shall not know it; and as
  often afterward as I look at you I shall think, These are the fools whom
  Caius Petronius outwitted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And, self-satisfied, he passed to the triclinium, where he sat down to
  supper with Eunice. During the meal a lector read to them the Idyls of
  Theocritus. Out of doors the wind brought clouds from the direction of
  Soracte, and a sudden storm broke the silence of the calm summer night. From
  time to time thunder reverberated on the seven hills, while they, reclining
  near each other at the table, listened to the bucolic poet, who in the
  singing Doric dialect celebrated the loves of shepherds. Later on, with minds
  at rest, they prepared for sweet slumber.</p>

  <p>But before this Vinicius returned. Petronius heard of his coming, and went
  to meet him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well? Have ye fixed anything new?&rdquo; inquired he. &ldquo;Has
  Nazarius gone to the prison?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; answered the young man, arranging his hair, wet from
  the rain. &ldquo;Nazarius went to arrange with the guards, and I have seen
  Peter, who commanded me to pray and believe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is well. If all goes favorably, we can bear her away to-
  morrow night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My manager must be here at daybreak with men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The road is a short one. Now go to rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Vinicius knelt in his cubiculum and prayed.</p>

  <p>At sunrise Niger, the manager, arrived from Corioli, bringing with him, at
  the order of Vinicius, mules, a litter, and four trusty men selected among
  slaves from Britain, whom, to save appearances, he had left at an inn in the
  Subura. Vinicius, who had watched all night, went to meet him. Niger, moved
  at sight of his youthful master, kissed his hands and eyes,
  saying,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear, thou art ill, or else suffering has sucked the blood from
  thy face, for hardly did I know thee at first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius took him to the interior colonnade, and there admitted him to the
  secret. Niger listened with fixed attention, and on his dry, sunburnt face
  great emotion was evident; this he did not even try to master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then she is a Christian?&rdquo; exclaimed Niger; and he looked
  inquiringly into the face of Vinicius, who divined evidently what the gaze of
  the countryman was asking, since he answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I too am a Christian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tears glistened in Niger&rsquo;s eyes that moment. He was silent for a
  while; then, raising his hands, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank Thee, O Christ, for having taken the beam from eyes which
  are the dearest on earth to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he embraced the head of Vinicius, and, weeping from happiness, fell
  to kissing his forehead. A moment later, Petronius appeared, bringing
  Nazarius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; cried he, while still at a distance.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the news was good. First, Glaucus the physician guaranteed
  Lygia&rsquo;s life, though she had the same prison fever of which, in the
  Tullianum and other dungeons, hundreds of people were dying daily. As to the
  guards and the man who tried corpses with red-hot iron, there was not the
  least difficulty. Attys, the assistant, was satisfied also.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We made openings in the coffin to let the sick woman
  breathe,&rdquo; said Nazarius. &ldquo;The only danger is that she may groan
  or speak as we pass the pretorians. But she is very weak, and is lying with
  closed eyes since early morning. Besides, Glaucus will give her a sleeping
  draught prepared by himself from drugs brought by me purposely from the city.
  The cover will not be nailed to the coffin; ye will raise it easily and take
  the patient to the litter. We will place in the coffin a long bag of sand,
  which ye will provide.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, while hearing these words, was as pale as linen; but he listened
  with such attention that he seemed to divine at a glance what Nazarius had to
  say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will they carry out other bodies from the prison?&rdquo; inquired
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About twenty died last night, and before evening more will be
  dead,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;We must go with a whole company, but we
  will delay and drop into the rear. At the first corner my comrade will get
  lame purposely. In that way we shall remain behind the others considerably.
  Ye will wait for us at the small temple of Libitina. May God give a night as
  dark as possible!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said Niger. &ldquo;Last evening was bright, and
  then a sudden storm came. To-day the sky is clear, but since morning it is
  sultry. Every night now there will be wind and rain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will ye go without torches?&rdquo; inquired Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The torches are carried only in advance. In every event, be near
  the temple of Libitina at dark, though usually we carry out the corpses only
  just before midnight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They stopped. Nothing was to be heard save the hurried breathing of
  Vinicius. Petronius turned to him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I said yesterday that it would be best were we both to stay at
  home, but now I see that I could not stay. Were it a question of flight,
  there would be need of the greatest caution; but since she will be borne out
  as a corpse, it seems that not the least suspicion will enter the head of any
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; answered Vinicius. &ldquo;I must be there. I
  will take her from the coffin myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once she is in my house at Corioli, I answer for her,&rdquo; said
  Niger. Conversation stopped here. Niger returned to his men at the inn.
  Nazarius took a purse of gold under his tunic and went to the prison. For
  Vinicius began a day filled with alarm, excitement, disquiet, and hope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The undertaking ought to succeed, for it is well planned,&rdquo;
  said Petronius. &ldquo;It was impossible to plan better. Thou must feign
  suffering, and wear a dark toga. Do not desert the amphitheatre. Let people
  see thee. All is so fixed that there cannot be failure. But&mdash;art thou
  perfectly sure of thy manager?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a Christian,&rdquo; replied Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Petronius looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and
  said, as if in soliloquy,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Pollux! how it spreads, and commands people&rsquo;s souls. Under
  such terror as the present, men would renounce straightway all the gods of
  Rome, Greece, and Egypt. Still, this is wonderful! By Pollux! if I believed
  that anything depended on our gods, I would sacrifice six white bullocks to
  each of them, and twelve to Capitoline Jove. Spare no promises to thy
  Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have given Him my soul,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>And they parted. Petronius returned to his cubiculum; but Vinicius went to
  look from a distance at the prison, and thence betook himself to the slope of
  the Vatican hill,&mdash;to that hut of the quarryman where he had received
  baptism from the hands of the Apostle. It seemed to him that Christ would
  hear him more readily there than in any other place; so when he found it, he
  threw himself on the ground and exerted all the strength of his suffering
  soul in prayer for mercy, and so forgot himself that he remembered not where
  he was or what he was doing. In the afternoon he was roused by the sound of
  trumpets which came from the direction of Nero&rsquo;s Circus. He went out of
  the hut, and gazed around with eyes which were as if just opened from
  sleep.</p>

  <p>It was hot; the stillness was broken at intervals by the sound of brass
  and continually by the ceaseless noise of grasshoppers. The air had become
  sultry, the sky was still clear over the city, but near the Sabine Hills dark
  clouds were gathering at the edge of the horizon.</p>

  <p>Vinicius went home. Petronius was waiting for him in the atrium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been on the Palatine,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I showed myself
  there purposely, and even sat down at dice. There is a feast at the house of
  Vinicius this evening; I promised to go, but only after midnight, saying that
  I must sleep before that hour. In fact I shall be there, and it would be well
  wert thou to go also.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are there no tidings from Niger or Nazarius?&rdquo; inquired
  Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; we shall see them only at midnight. Hast noticed that a storm
  is threatening?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow there is to be an exhibition of crucified Christians, but
  perhaps rain will prevent it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he drew nearer and said, touching his nephew&rsquo;s
  shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;But thou wilt not see her on the cross; thou wilt see
  her only in Corioli. By Castor! I would not give the moment in which we free
  her for all the gems in Rome. The evening is near.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In truth the evening was near, and darkness began to encircle the city
  earlier than usual because clouds covered the whole horizon. With the coming
  of night heavy rain fell, which turned into steam on the stones warmed by the
  heat of the day, and filled the streets of the city with mist. After that
  came a lull, then brief violent showers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us hurry!&rdquo; said Vinicius at last; &ldquo;they may carry
  bodies from the prison earlier because of the storm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is time!&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>And taking Gallic mantles with hoods, they passed through the garden door
  to the street. Petronius had armed himself with a short Roman knife called
  sicca, which he took always during night trips.</p>

  <p>The city was empty because of the storm. From time to time lightning rent
  the clouds, illuminating with its glare the fresh walls of houses newly built
  or in process of building and the wet flag-stones with which the streets were
  paved. At last a flash came, when they saw, after a rather long road, the
  mound on which stood the small temple of Libitina, and at the foot of the
  mound a group of mules and horses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Niger!&rdquo; called Vinicius, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am here, lord,&rdquo; said a voice in the rain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is everything ready?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is. We were here at dark. But hide yourselves under the rampart,
  or ye will be drenched. What a storm! Hail will fall, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact Niger&rsquo;s fear was justified, for soon hail began to fall, at
  first fine, then larger and more frequent. The air grew cold at once. While
  standing under the rampart, sheltered from the wind and icy missiles, they
  conversed in low voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even should some one see us,&rdquo; said Niger, &ldquo;there will
  be no suspicion; we look like people waiting for the storm to pass. But I
  fear that they may not bring the bodies out till morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hail-storm will not last,&rdquo; said Petronius. &ldquo;We must
  wait even till daybreak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They waited, listening to hear the sound of the procession. The hail-
  storm passed, but immediately after a shower began to roar. At times the wind
  rose, and brought from the &ldquo;Putrid Pits&rdquo; a dreadful odor of
  decaying bodies, buried near the surface and carelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see a light through the mist,&rdquo; said
  Niger,&mdash;&ldquo;one, two, three,&mdash;those are torches. See that the
  mules do not snort,&rdquo; said he, turning to the men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>The lights were growing more and more distinct. After a time it was
  possible to see torches under the quivering flames.</p>

  <p>Niger made the sign of the cross, and began to pray. Meanwhile the gloomy
  procession drew nearer, and halted at last in front of the temple of
  Libitina. Petronius, Vinicius, and Niger pressed up to the rampart in
  silence, not knowing why the halt was made. But the men had stopped only to
  cover their mouths and faces with cloths to ward off the stifling stench
  which at the edge of the &ldquo;Putrid Pits&rdquo; was simply unendurable;
  then they raised the biers with coffins and moved on. Only one coffin stopped
  before the temple. Vinicius sprang toward it, and after him Petronius, Niger,
  and two British slaves with the litter.</p>

  <p>But before they had reached it in the darkness, the voice of Nazarius was
  heard, full of pain,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, they took her with Ursus to the Esquiline prison. We are
  carrying another body! They removed her before midnight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius, when he had returned home, was gloomy as a storm, and did not
  even try to console Vinicius. He understood that to free Lygia from the
  Esquiline dungeons was not to be dreamed of. He divined that very likely she
  had been taken from the Tullianum so as not to die of fever and escape the
  amphitheatre assigned to her. But for this very reason she was watched and
  guarded more carefully than others. From the bottom of his soul Petronius was
  sorry for her and Vinicius, but he was wounded also by the thought that for
  the first time in life he had not succeeded, and for the first time was
  beaten in a struggle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fortune seems to desert me,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;but
  the gods are mistaken if they think that I will accept such a life as his,
  for example.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he turned toward Vinicius, who looked at him with staring eyes.
  &ldquo;What is the matter? Thou hast a fever,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>But Vinicius answered with a certain strange, broken, halting voice, like
  that of a sick child,&mdash;&ldquo;But I believe that He&mdash;can restore
  her to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Above the city the last thunders of the storm had ceased.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch57"
     name="ch57">CHAPTER LVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THREE days&rsquo; rain, an exceptional phenomenon in Rome
  during summer, and hail falling in opposition to the natural order, not only
  in the day, but even at night, interrupted the spectacles. People were
  growing alarmed. A failure of grapes was predicted, and when on a certain
  afternoon a thunderbolt melted the bronze statue of Ceres on the Capitol,
  sacrifices were ordered in the temple of Jupiter Salvator. The priests of
  Ceres spread a report that the anger of the gods was turned on the city
  because of the too hasty punishment of Christians; hence crowds began to
  insist that the spectacles be given without reference to weather. Delight
  seized all Rome when the announcement was made at last that the ludus would
  begin again after three days&rsquo; interval.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile beautiful weather returned. The amphitheatre was filled at
  daybreak with thousands of people. Cæsar came early with the vestals and the
  court. The spectacle was to begin with a battle among the Christians, who to
  this end were arrayed as gladiators and furnished with all kinds of weapons
  which served gladiators by profession in offensive and defensive struggles.
  But here came disappointment. The Christians threw nets, darts, tridents, and
  swords on the arena, embraced and encouraged one another to endurance in view
  of torture and death. At this deep indignation and resentment seized the
  hearts of the multitude. Some reproached the Christians with cowardice and
  pusillanimity; others asserted that they refused to fight through hatred of
  the people, so as to deprive them of that pleasure which the sight of bravery
  produces. Finally, at command of Cæsar, real gladiators were let out, who
  despatched in one twinkle the kneeling and defenceless victims.</p>

  <p>When these bodies were removed, the spectacle was a series of mythologic
  pictures,&mdash;Cæsar&rsquo;s own idea. The audience saw Hercules blazing in
  living fire on Mount Oeta. Vinicius had trembled at the thought that the role
  of Hercules might be intended for Ursus; but evidently the turn of
  Lygia&rsquo;s faithful servant had not come, for on the pile some other
  Christian was burning,&mdash;a man quite unknown to Vinicius. In the next
  picture Chilo, whom Cæsar would not excuse from attendance, saw
  acquaintances. The death of Dædalus was represented, and also that of Icarus.
  In the rôle of Dædalus appeared Euricius, that old man who had given Chilo
  the sign of the fish; the role of Icarus was taken by his son, Quartus. Both
  were raised aloft with cunning machinery, and then hurled suddenly from an
  immense height to the arena. Young Quartus fell so near Cæsar&rsquo;s podium
  that he spattered with blood not only the external ornaments but the purple
  covering spread over the front of the podium. Chilo did not see the fall, for
  he closed his eyes; but he heard the dull thump of the body, and when after a
  time he saw blood there close to him, he came near fainting a second
  time.</p>

  <p>The pictures changed quickly. The shameful torments of maidens violated
  before death by gladiators dressed as wild beasts, delighted the hearts of
  the rabble. They saw priestesses of Cybele and Ceres, they saw the Danaides,
  they saw Dirce and Pasiphaë; finally they saw young girls, not mature yet,
  torn asunder by wild horses. Every moment the crowd applauded new ideas of
  Nero, who, proud of them, and made happy by plaudits, did not take the
  emerald from his eye for one instant while looking at white bodies torn with
  iron, and the convulsive quivering of victims.</p>

  <p>Pictures were given also from the history of the city. After the maidens
  they saw Mucius Scævola, whose hand fastened over a fire to a tripod filled
  the amphitheatre with the odor of burnt flesh; but this man, like the real
  Scævola, remained without a groan, his eyes raised and the murmur of prayer
  on his blackening lips. When he had expired and his body was dragged to the
  spoliarium, the usual midday interlude followed. Cæsar with the vestals and
  the Augustians left the amphitheatre, and withdrew to an immense scarlet tent
  erected purposely; in this was prepared for him and the guests a magnificent
  prandium. The spectators for the greater part followed his example, and,
  streaming out, disposed themselves in picturesque groups around the tent, to
  rest their limbs wearied from long sitting, and enjoy the food which, through
  Cæsar&rsquo;s favor, was served by slaves to them. Only the most curious
  descended to the arena itself, and, touching with their fingers lumps of sand
  held together by blood, conversed, as specialists and amateurs, of that which
  had happened and of that which was to follow. Soon even these went away, lest
  they might be late for the feast; only those few were left who stayed not
  through curiosity, but sympathy for the coming victims. Those concealed
  themselves behind seats or in the lower places.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the arena was levelled, and slaves began to dig holes one near
  the other in rows throughout the whole circuit from side to side, so that the
  last row was but a few paces distant from Cæsar&rsquo;s podium. From outside
  came the murmur of people, shouts and plaudits, while within they were
  preparing in hot haste for new tortures. The cunicula were opened
  simultaneously, and in all passages leading to the arena were urged forward
  crowds of Christians naked and carrying crosses on their shoulders. The whole
  arena was filled with them. Old men, bending under the weight of wooden
  beams, ran forward; at the side of these went men in the prime of life, women
  with loosened hair behind which they strove to hide their nakedness, small
  boys, and little children. The crosses, for the greater part, as well as the
  victims, were wreathed with flowers. The servants of the amphitheatre beat
  the unfortunates with clubs, forcing them to lay down their crosses near the
  holes prepared, and stand themselves there in rows. Thus were to perish those
  whom executioners had had no chance to drive out as food for dogs and wild
  beasts the first day of the games. Black slaves seized the victims, laid them
  face upward on the wood, and fell to nailing their hands hurriedly and
  quickly to the arms of the crosses, so that people returning after the
  interlude might find all the crosses standing. The whole amphitheatre
  resounded with the noise of hammers which echoed through all the rows, went
  out to the space surrounding the amphitheatre, and into the tent where Cæsar
  was entertaining his suite and the vestals. There he drank wine, bantered
  with Chilo, and whispered strange words in the ears of the priestesses of
  Vesta; but on the arena the work was seething,&mdash;nails were going into
  the hands and feet of the Christians; shovels moved quickly, filling the
  holes in which the crosses had been planted.</p>

  <p>Among the new victims whose turn was to come soon was Crispus. The lions
  had not had time to rend him; hence he was appointed to the cross. He, ready
  at all times for death, was delighted with the thought that his hour was
  approaching. He seemed another man, for his emaciated body was wholly
  naked,&mdash;only a girdle of ivy encircled his hips, on his head was a
  garland of roses. But in his eyes gleamed always that same exhaustless
  energy; that same fanatical stern face gazed from beneath the crown of roses.
  Neither had his heart changed; for, as once in the cuniculum he had
  threatened with the wrath of God his brethren sewed up in the skins of wild
  beasts, so to-day he thundered in place of consoling them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank the Redeemer,&rdquo; said Crispus, &ldquo;that He permits you
  to die the same death that He Himself died. Maybe a part of your sins will be
  remitted for this cause; but tremble, since justice must be satisfied, and
  there cannot be one reward for the just and the wicked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His words were accompanied by the sound of the hammers nailing the hands
  and feet of victims. Every moment more crosses were raised on the arena; but
  he, turning to the crowd standing each man by his own cross,
  continued,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see heaven open, but I see also the yawning abyss. I know not
  what account of my life to give the Lord, though I have believed, and hated
  evil. I fear, not death, but resurrection; I fear, not torture, but judgment,
  for the day of wrath is at hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment was heard from between the nearest rows some voice, calm
  and solemn,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not the day of wrath, but of mercy, the day of salvation and
  happiness; for I say that Christ will gather you in, will comfort you and
  seat you at His right hand. Be confident, for heaven is opening before
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At these words all eyes were turned to the benches; even those who were
  hanging on the crosses raised their pale, tortured faces, and looked toward
  the man who was speaking.</p>

  <p>But he went to the barrier surrounding the arena, and blessed them with
  the sign of the cross.</p>

  <p>Crispus stretched out his arm as if to thunder at him; but when he saw the
  man&rsquo;s face, he dropped his arm, the knees bent under him, and his lips
  whispered, &ldquo;Paul the Apostle!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To the great astonishment of the servants of the Circus, all of those who
  were not nailed to the crosses yet knelt down. Paul turned to Crispus and
  said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Threaten them not, Crispus, for this day they will be with thee in
  paradise. It is thy thought that they may be condemned. But who will
  condemn?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will God, who gave His Son for them? Will Christ, who died for
  their salvation, condemn when they die for His name? And how is it possible
  that He who loves can condemn? Who will accuse the chosen of God? Who will
  say of this blood, &rsquo;It is cursed&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have hated evil,&rdquo; said the old priest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s command to love men was higher than that to hate
  evil, for His religion is not hatred, but love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have sinned in the hour of death,&rdquo; answered Crispus,
  beating his breast. The manager of the seats approached the Apostle, and
  inquired,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou, speaking to the condemned?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Roman citizen,&rdquo; answered Paul, calmly. Then, turning to
  Crispus, he said: &ldquo;Be confident, for to-day is a day of grace; die in
  peace, O servant of God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The black men approached Crispus at that moment to place him on the cross;
  but he looked around once again, and cried,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My brethren, pray for me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face had lost its usual sternness; his stony features had taken an
  expression of peace and sweetness. He stretched his arms himself along the
  arms of the cross, to make the work easier, and, looking directly into
  heaven, began to pray earnestly. He seemed to feel nothing; for when the
  nails entered his hands, not the least quiver shook his body, nor on his face
  did there appear any wrinkle of pain. He prayed when they raised the cross
  and trampled the earth around it. Only when crowds began to fill the
  amphitheatre with shouts and laughter did his brows frown somewhat, as if in
  anger that a pagan people were disturbing the calm and peace of a sweet
  death.</p>

  <p>But all the crosses had been raised, so that in the arena there stood as
  it were a forest, with people hanging on the trees. On the arms of the
  crosses and on the heads of the martyrs fell the gleam of the sun; but on the
  arena was a deep shadow, forming a kind of black involved grating through
  which glittered the golden sand. That was a spectacle in which the whole
  delight of the audience consisted in looking at a lingering death. Never
  before had men seen such a density of crosses. The arena was packed so
  closely that the servants squeezed between them only with effort. On the
  edges were women especially; but Crispus, as a leader, was raised almost in
  front of Cæsar&rsquo;s podium, on an immense cross, wreathed below with
  honeysuckle. None of the victims had died yet, but some of those fastened
  earlier had fainted. No one groaned; no one called for mercy. Some were
  hanging with head inclined on one arm, or dropped on the breast, as if seized
  by sleep; some were as if in meditation; some, looking toward heaven, were
  moving their lips quietly. In this terrible forest of crosses, among those
  crucified bodies, in that silence of victims there was something ominous. The
  people who, filled by the feast and gladsome, had returned to the Circus with
  shouts, became silent, not knowing on which body to rest their eyes, or what
  to think of the spectacle. The nakedness of strained female forms roused no
  feeling. They did not make the usual bets as to who would die first,&mdash;a
  thing done generally when there was even the smallest number of criminals on
  the arena. It seemed that Cæsar himself was bored, for he turned lazily and
  with drowsy expression to arrange his necklace.</p>

  <p>At that moment Crispus, who was hanging opposite, and who, like a man in a
  faint or dying, had kept his eyes closed, opened them and looked at Cæsar.
  His face assumed an expression so pitiless, and his eyes flashed with such
  fire, that the Augustians whispered to one another, pointing at him with
  their fingers, and at last Cæsar himself turned to that cross, and placed the
  emerald to his eye sluggishly.</p>

  <p>Perfect silence followed. The eyes of the spectators were fixed on
  Crispus, who strove to move his right hand, as if to tear it from the
  tree.</p>

  <p>After a while his breast rose, his ribs were visible, and he cried:
  &ldquo;Matricide! woe to thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Augustians, hearing this mortal insult flung at the lord of the world
  in presence of thousands, did not dare to breathe. Chilo was half dead. Cæsar
  trembled, and dropped the emerald from his fingers. The people, too, held the
  breath in their breasts. The voice of Crispus was heard, as it rose in power,
  throughout the amphitheatre,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe to thee, murderer of wife and brother! woe to thee, Antichrist.
  The abyss is opening beneath thee, death is stretching its hands to thee, the
  grave is waiting for thee. Woe, living corpse, for in terror shalt thou die
  and be damned to eternity!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Unable to tear his hand from the cross, Crispus strained awfully. He was
  terrible,&mdash;a living skeleton; unbending as predestination, he shook his
  white beard over Nero&rsquo;s podium, scattering, as he nodded, rose leaves
  from the garland on his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe to thee, murderer! Thy measure is surpassed, and thy hour is at
  hand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he made one more effort. It seemed for a moment that he would free
  his hand from the cross and hold it in menace above Cæsar; but all at once
  his emaciated arms extended still more, his body settled down, his head fell
  on his breast, and he died.</p>

  <p>In that forest of crosses the weakest began also the sleep of
  eternity.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch58"
     name="ch58">CHAPTER LVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Chilo, &ldquo;the sea is like olive
  oil, the waves seem to sleep. Let us go to Achæa. There the glory of Apollo
  is awaiting thee, crowns and triumph are awaiting thee, the people will deify
  thee, the gods will receive thee as a guest, their own equal; but here, O
  lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he stopped, for his lower lip began to quiver so violently that his
  words passed into meaningless sounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will go when the games are over,&rdquo; replied Nero. &ldquo;I
  know that even now some call the Christians innoxia corpora. If I were to go,
  all would repeat this. What dost thou fear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he frowned, but looked with inquiring glance at Chilo, as if
  expecting an answer, for he only feigned cool blood. At the last exhibition
  he himself feared the words of Crispus; and when he had returned to the
  Palatine, he could not sleep from rage and shame, but also from fear.</p>

  <p>Then Vestinius, who heard their conversation in silence, looked around,
  and said in a mysterious voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, lord, to this old man. There is something strange in those
  Christians. Their deity gives them an easy death, but he may be
  vengeful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was not I who arranged the games, but Tigellinus,&rdquo; replied
  Nero, quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True! it was I,&rdquo; added Tigellinus, who heard Cæsar&rsquo;s
  answer, &ldquo;and I jeer at all Christian gods. Vestinius is a bladder full
  of prejudices, and this valiant Greek is ready to die of terror at sight of a
  hen with feathers up in defence of her chickens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; said Nero; &ldquo;but henceforth give command to cut
  the tongues out of Christians and stop their mouths.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fire will stop them, O divinity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; groaned Chilo.</p>

  <p>But Cæsar, to whom the insolent confidence of Tigellinus gave courage,
  began to laugh, and said, pointing to the old Greek,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See how the descendant of Achilles looks!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Indeed Chilo looked terribly. The remnant of hair on his head had grown
  white; on his face was fixed an expression of some immense dread, alarm, and
  oppression. He seemed at times, too, as if stunned and only half conscious.
  Often he gave no answer to questions; then again he fell into anger, and
  became so insolent that the Augustians preferred not to attack him. Such a
  moment had come to him then.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do what ye like with me, but I will not go to the games!&rdquo;
  cried he, in desperation.</p>

  <p>Nero looked at him for a while, and, turning to Tigellinus,
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a care that this Stoic is near me in the gardens. I want to
  see what impression our torches will make on him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo was afraid of the threat which quivered in Cæsar&rsquo;s voice.
  &ldquo;O lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall see nothing, for I cannot see
  in the night-time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The night will be as bright as day,&rdquo; replied Cæsar, with a
  threatening laugh.</p>

  <p>Turning then to the Augustians, Nero talked about races which he intended
  to have when the games were over.</p>

  <p>Petronius approached Chilo, and asked, pushing him on the
  shoulder,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said that thou wouldst not hold out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to drink,&rdquo; said Chilo, stretching his trembling hand
  toward a goblet of wine; but he was unable to raise it to his lips. Seeing
  this, Vestinius took the vessel; but later he drew near, and inquired with
  curious and frightened face,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are the Furies pursuing thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man looked at him a certain time with open lips, as if not
  understanding what he said. But Vestinius repeated,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are the Furies pursuing thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Chilo; &ldquo;but night is before
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How, night? May the gods have mercy on thee. How night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Night, ghastly and impenetrable, in which something is moving,
  something coming toward me; but I know not what it is, and I am
  terrified.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have always been sure that there are witches. Dost thou not dream
  of something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, for I do not sleep. I did not think that they would be punished
  thus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou sorry for them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do ye shed so much blood? Hast heard what that one said from
  the cross? Woe to us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; answered Vestinius, in a low voice. &ldquo;But they
  are incendiaries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not true!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And enemies of the human race.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not true!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And poisoners of water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not true!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And murderers of children.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not true!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Vestinius, with astonishment. &ldquo;Thou hast
  said so thyself, and given them into the hands of Tigellinus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Therefore night has surrounded me, and death is coming toward me.
  At times it seems to me that I am dead already, and ye also.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! it is they who are dying; we are alive. But tell me, what do
  they see when they are dying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is their god. Is he a mighty god?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Chilo answered with a question,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of torches are to burn in the gardens? Hast thou heard
  what Cæsar said?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard, and I know. Those torches are called Sarmentitii and
  Semaxii. They are made by arraying men in painful tunics, steeped in pitch,
  and binding them to pillars, to which fire is set afterward. May their god
  not send misfortune on the city. Semaxii! that is a dreadful
  punishment!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would rather see it, for there will not be blood,&rdquo; answered
  Chilo. &ldquo;Command a slave to hold the goblet to my mouth. I wish to
  drink, but I spill the wine; my hand trembles from age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Others also were speaking of the Christians. Old Domitius Afer reviled
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is such a multitude of them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that they
  might raise a civil war; and, remember, there were fears lest they might arm.
  But they die like sheep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let them try to die otherwise!&rdquo; said Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>To this Petronius answered, &ldquo;Ye deceive yourselves. They are
  arming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With patience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is a new kind of weapon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True. But can ye say that they die like common criminals? No! They
  die as if the criminals were those who condemned them to death,&mdash;that
  is, we and the whole Roman people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What raving!&rdquo; said Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hic Abdera!&rdquo; answered Petronius.</p>

  <p>[A proverbial expression meaning &ldquo;The dullest of the
  dull&rdquo;&mdash;Note by the Author.]</p>

  <p>But others, struck by the justice of his remark, began to look at one
  another with astonishment, and repeat,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True! there is something peculiar and strange in their
  death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you that they see their divinity!&rdquo; cried Vestinius,
  from one side. Thereupon a number of Augustians turned to Chilo,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hai, old man, thou knowest them well; tell us what they
  see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek spat out wine on his tunic, and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The resurrection.&rdquo; And he began to tremble so that the guests
  sitting nearer burst into loud laughter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch59"
     name="ch59">CHAPTER LIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For some time Vinicius had spent his nights away from home.
  It occurred to Petronius that perhaps he had formed a new plan, and was
  working to liberate Lygia from the Esquiline dungeon; he did not wish,
  however, to inquire about anything, lest he might bring misfortune to the
  work. This sceptical exquisite had become in a certain sense superstitious.
  He had failed to snatch Lygia from the Mamertine prison, hence had ceased to
  believe in his own star.</p>

  <p>Besides, he did not count this time on a favorable outcome for the efforts
  of Vinicius. The Esquiline prison, formed in a hurry from the cellars of
  houses thrown down to stop the fire, was not, it is true, so terrible as the
  old Tullianum near the Capitol, but it was a hundred times better guarded.
  Petronius understood perfectly that Lygia had been taken there only to escape
  death and not escape the amphitheatre. He could understand at once that for
  this very reason they were guarding her as a man guards the eye in his
  head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;Cæsar and Tigellinus
  have reserved her for some special spectacle, more dreadful than all others,
  and Vinicius is more likely to perish than rescue her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, too, had lost hope of being able to free Lygia. Christ alone
  could do that. The young tribune now thought only of seeing her in
  prison.</p>

  <p>For some time the knowledge that Nazarius had penetrated the Mamertine
  prison as a corpse-bearer had given him no peace; hence he resolved to try
  that method also.</p>

  <p>The overseer of the &ldquo;Putrid Pits,&rdquo; who had been bribed for an
  immense sum of money, admitted him at last among servants whom he sent
  nightly to prisons for corpses. The danger that Vinicius might be recognized
  was really small. He was preserved from it by night, the dress of a slave,
  and the defective illumination of the prison. Besides, into whose head could
  it enter that a patrician, the grandson of one consul, the son of another,
  could be found among servants, corpse-bearers, exposed to the miasma of
  prisons and the &ldquo;Putrid Pits&rdquo;? And he began work to which men
  were forced only by slavery or the direst need.</p>

  <p>When the desired evening came, he girded his loins gladly, covered his
  head with a cloth steeped in turpentine, and with throbbing heart betook
  himself, with a crowd of others, to the Esquiline.</p>

  <p>The pretorian guards made no trouble, for all had brought proper tesseræ,
  which the centurion examined by the light of a lantern. After a while the
  great iron doors opened before them, and they entered.</p>

  <p>Vinicius saw an extensive vaulted cellar, from which they passed to a
  series of others. Dim tapers illuminated the interior of each, which was
  filled with people. Some of these were lying at the walls sunk in sleep, or
  dead, perhaps. Others surrounded large vessels of water, standing in the
  middle, out of which they drank as people tormented with fever; others were
  sitting on the grounds, their elbows on their knees, their heads on their
  palms; here and there children were sleeping, nestled up to their mothers.
  Groans, loud hurried breathing of the sick, weeping, whispered prayers, hymns
  in an undertone, the curses of overseers were heard round about it. In this
  dungeon was the odor of crowds and corpses. In its gloomy depth dark figures
  were swarming; nearer, close to flickering lights, were visible faces, pale,
  terrified, hungry, and cadaverous, with eyes dim, or else flaming with fever,
  with lips blue, with streams of sweat on their foreheads, and with clammy
  hair. In corners the sick were moaning loudly; some begged for water; others,
  to be led to death. And still that prison was less terrible than the old
  Tullianum. The legs bent under Vinicius when he saw all this, and breath was
  failing in his breast. At the thought that Lygia was in the midst of this
  misery and misfortune, the hair rose on his head, and he stifled a cry of
  despair. The amphitheatre, the teeth of wild beasts, the
  cross,&mdash;anything was better than those dreadful dungeons filled with the
  odor of corpses, places in which imploring voices called from every
  corner,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lead us to death!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius pressed his nails into his palms, for he felt that he was growing
  weak, and that presence of mind was deserting him. All that he had felt till
  then, all his love and pain, changed in him to one desire for death.</p>

  <p>Just then near his side was heard the overseer of the &ldquo;Putrid
  Pits&rdquo;,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many corpses have ye to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About a dozen,&rdquo; answered the guardian of the prison,
  &ldquo;but there will be more before morning; some are in agony at the
  walls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he fell to complaining of women who concealed dead children so as to
  keep them near and not yield them to the &ldquo;Putrid Pits.&rdquo; &ldquo;We
  must discover corpses first by the odor; through this the air, so terrible
  already, is spoiled still more. I would rather be a slave in some rural
  prison than guard these dogs rotting here while alive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The overseer of the pits comforted him, saying that his own service was no
  easier. By this time the sense of reality had returned to Vinicius. He began
  to search the dungeon; but sought in vain for Lygia, fearing meanwhile that
  he would never see her alive. A number of cellars were connected by newly
  made passages; the corpse-bearers entered only those from which corpses were
  to be carried. Fear seized Vinicius lest that privilege which had cost so
  much trouble might serve no purpose. Luckily his patron aided him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Infection spreads most through corpses,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ye
  must carry out the bodies at once, or die yourselves, together with the
  prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are only ten of us for all the cellars,&rdquo; said the
  guardian, &ldquo;and we must sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will leave four men of mine, who will go through the cellars at
  night to see if these are dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will drink to-morrow if thou do that. Everybody must be taken to
  the test; for an order has come to pierce the neck of each corpse, and then
  to the &lsquo;Putrid Pits&rsquo; at once with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, but we will drink,&rdquo; said the overseer.</p>

  <p>Four men were selected, and among them Vinicius; the others he took to put
  the corpses on the biers.</p>

  <p>Vinicius was at rest; he was certain now at least of finding Lygia. The
  young tribune began by examining the first dungeon carefully; he looked into
  all the dark corners hardly reached by the light of his torch; he examined
  figures sleeping at the walls under coarse cloths; he saw that the most
  grievously ill were drawn into a corner apart. But Lygia he found in no
  place. In a second and third dungeon his search was equally fruitless.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the hour had grown late; all corpses had been carried out. The
  guards, disposing themselves in the corridors between cellars, were asleep;
  the children, wearied with crying, were silent; nothing was heard save the
  breathing of troubled breasts, and here and there the murmur of prayer.</p>

  <p>Vinicius went with his torch to the fourth dungeon, which was considerably
  smaller. Raising the light, he began to examine it, and trembled all at once,
  for it seemed to him that he saw, near a latticed opening in the wall, the
  gigantic form of Ursus. Then, blowing out the light, he approached him, and
  asked,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ursus, art thou here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked the giant, turning his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost not know me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast quenched the torch; how could I know thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But at that moment Vinicius saw Lygia lying on a cloak near the wall; so,
  without speaking further, he knelt near her. Ursus recognized him, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Praise be to Christ! but do not wake her, lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius, kneeling down, gazed at her through his tears. In spite of the
  darkness he could distinguish her face, which seemed to him as pale as
  alabaster, and her emaciated arms. At that sight he was seized by a love
  which was like a rending pain, a love which shook his soul to its uttermost
  depth, and which at the same time was so full of pity, respect, and homage
  that he fell on his face, and pressed to his lips the hem of the cloak on
  which rested that head dearer to him than all else on earth.</p>

  <p>Ursus looked at Vinicius for a long time in silence, but at last he pulled
  his tunic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;how didst thou come, and hast thou
  come here to save her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius rose, and struggled for a time with his emotion. &ldquo;Show me
  the means,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought that thou wouldst find them, lord. Only one method came
  to my head&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he turned toward the grating in the wall, as if in answer to himself,
  and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that way&mdash;but there are soldiers outside&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A hundred pretorians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then we cannot pass?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Lygian rubbed his forehead, and asked again,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How didst thou enter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a tessera from the overseer of the &lsquo;Putrid
  Pits.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then Vinicius stopped suddenly, as if some idea had
  flashed through his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the Passion of the Redeemer,&rdquo; said he, in a hurried voice,
  &ldquo;I will stay here. Let her take my tessera; she can wrap her head in a
  cloth, cover her shoulders with a mantle, and pass out. Among the slaves who
  carry out corpses there are several youths not full grown; hence the
  pretorians will not notice her, and once at the house of Petronius she is
  safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the Lygian dropped his head on his breast, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;She
  would not consent, for she loves thee; besides, she is sick, and unable to
  stand alone. If thou and the noble Petronius cannot save her from prison, who
  can?&rdquo; said he, after a while.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then both were silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ could save all Christians,&rdquo; thought the Lygian, in his
  simple heart; &ldquo;but since He does not save them, it is clear that the
  hour of torture and death has come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He accepted it for himself, but was grieved to the depth of his soul for
  that child who had grown up in his arms, and whom he loved beyond life.</p>

  <p>Vinicius knelt again near Lygia. Through the grating in the wall moonbeams
  came in, and gave better light than the one candle burning yet over the
  entrance. Lygia opened her eyes now, and said, placing her feverish hand on
  the arm of Vinicius,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see thee; I knew that thou wouldst come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He seized her hands, pressed them to his forehead and his heart, raised
  her somewhat, and held her to his breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come, dearest. May Christ guard and free thee, beloved
  Lygia!&rdquo; He could say no more, for the heart began to whine in his
  breast from pain and love, and he would not show pain in her presence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sick, Marcus,&rdquo; said Lygia, &ldquo;and I must die either
  on the arena or here in prison&mdash;I have prayed to see thee before death;
  thou hast come,&mdash;Christ has heard me.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Unable to utter a word yet, he pressed her to his bosom, and she
  continued,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw thee through the window in the Tullianum. I saw that thou
  hadst the wish to come to me. Now the Redeemer has given me a moment of
  consciousness, so that we may take farewell of each other. I am going to Him,
  Marcus, but I love thee, and shall love always.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius conquered himself; he stifled his pain and began to speak in a
  voice which he tried to make calm,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, dear Lygia, thou wilt not die. The Apostle commanded me to
  believe, and he promised to pray for thee; he knew Christ,&mdash;Christ loved
  him and will not refuse him. Hadst thou to die, Peter would not have
  commanded me to be confident; but he said, &rsquo;Have
  confidence!&rsquo;&mdash;No, Lygia! Christ will have mercy. He does not wish
  thy death. He will not permit it. I Swear to thee by the name of the Redeemer
  that Peter is praying for thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence followed. The one candle hanging above the entrance went out, but
  moonlight entered through the whole opening. In the opposite corner of the
  cellar a child whined and was silent. From outside came the voices of
  pretorians, who, after watching their turn out, were playing under the wall
  at scriptoe duodecim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Marcus,&rdquo; said Lygia, &ldquo;Christ Himself called to the
  Father, &rsquo;Remove this bitter cup from Me&rsquo;; still He drank it.
  Christ Himself died on the cross, and thousands are perishing for His sake.
  Why, then, should He spare me alone? Who am I, Marcus? I have heard Peter say
  that he too would die in torture. Who am I, compared with Peter? When the
  pretorians came to us, I dreaded death and torture, but I dread them no
  longer. See what a terrible prison this is, but I am going to heaven. Think
  of it: Cæsar is here, but there the Redeemer, kind and merciful. And there is
  no death there. Thou lovest me; think, then, how happy I shall be. Oh, dear
  Marcus, think that thou wilt come to me there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here she stopped to get breath in her sick breast, and then raised his
  hand to her lips,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marcus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, dear one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not weep for me, and remember this,&mdash;thou wilt come to me.
  I have lived a short time, but God gave thy soul to me; hence I shall tell
  Christ that though I died, and thou wert looking at my death, though thou
  wert left in grief, thou didst not blaspheme against His will, and that thou
  lovest Him always. Thou wilt love Him, and endure my death patiently? For
  then He will unite us. I love thee and I wish to be with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Breath failed her then, and in a barely audible voice she finished,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Promise me this, Marcus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius embraced her with trembling arms, and said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By thy sacred head! I promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her pale face became radiant in the sad light of the moon, and once more
  she raised his hand to her lips, and whispered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am thy wife!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Beyond the wall the pretorians playing scriptoe duodecim raised a louder
  dispute; but Vinicius and Lygia forgot the prison, the guards, the world,
  and, feeling within them the souls of angels, they began to pray.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch60"
     name="ch60">CHAPTER LX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For three days, or rather three nights, nothing disturbed
  their peace. When the usual prison work was finished, which consisted in
  separating the dead from the living and the grievously sick from those in
  better health, when the wearied guards had lain down to sleep in the
  corridors, Vinicius entered Lygia&rsquo;s dungeon and remained there till
  daylight. She put her head on his breast, and they talked in low voices of
  love and of death. In thought and speech, in desires and hopes even, both
  were removed unconsciously more and more from life, and they lost the sense
  of it. Both were like people who, having sailed from land in a ship, saw the
  shore no more, and were sinking gradually into infinity. Both changed by
  degrees into sad souls in love with each other and with Christ, and ready to
  fly away. Only at times did pain start up in the heart of Vinicius like a
  whirlwind, at times there flashed in him like lightning, hope, born of love
  and faith in the crucified God; but he tore himself away more and more each
  day from the earth, and yielded to death. In the morning, when he went from
  the prison, he looked on the world, on the city, on acquaintances, on vital
  interests, as through a dream. Everything seemed to him strange, distant,
  vain, fleeting. Even torture ceased to terrify, since one might pass through
  it while sunk in thought and with eyes fixed on another thing. It seemed to
  both that eternity had begun to receive them. They conversed of how they
  would love and live together, but beyond the grave; and if their thoughts
  returned to the earth at intervals, these were thoughts of people who,
  setting out on a long journey, speak of preparations for the road. Moreover
  they were surrounded by such silence as in some desert surrounds two columns
  far away and forgotten. Their only care was that Christ should not separate
  them; and as each moment strengthened their conviction that He would not,
  they loved Him as a link uniting them in endless happiness and peace. While
  still on earth, the dust of earth fell from them. The soul of each was as
  pure as a tear. Under terror of death, amid misery and suffering, in that
  prison den, heaven had begun, for she had taken him by the hand, and, as if
  saved and a saint, had led him to the source of endless life.</p>

  <p>Petronius was astonished at seeing in the face of Vinicius increasing
  peace and a certain wonderful serenity which he had not noted before. At
  times even he supposed that Vinicius had found some mode of rescue, and he
  was piqued because his nephew had not confided his hopes to him. At last,
  unable to restrain himself, he said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now thou hast another look; do not keep from me secrets, for I wish
  and am able to aid thee. Hast thou arranged anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Vinicius; &ldquo;but thou canst not help me.
  After her death I will confess that I am a Christian and follow
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then thou hast no hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I have. Christ will give her to me, and I shall
  never be separated from her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius began to walk in the atrium; disillusion and impatience were
  evident on his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy Christ is not needed for this,&mdash;our Thanatos [death] can
  render the same service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius smiled sadly, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;No, my dear, thou art
  unwilling to understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am unwilling and unable. It is not the time for discussion, but
  remember what I said when we failed to free her from the Tullianum. I lost
  all hope, and on the way home thou didst say, &rsquo;But I believe that
  Christ can restore her to me.&rsquo; Let Him restore her. If I throw a costly
  goblet into the sea, no god of ours can give it back to me; if yours is no
  better, I know not why I should honor Him beyond the old ones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But He will restore her to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Pettonius shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Dost know,&rdquo; inquired he,
  &ldquo;that Christians are to illuminate Cæsar&rsquo;s gardens to-
  morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; repeated Vinicius.</p>

  <p>And in view of the near and dreadful reality his heart trembled with pain
  and fear. &ldquo;This is the last night, perhaps, which I can pass with
  Lygia,&rdquo; thought he. So bidding farewell to Petronius, he went hurriedly
  to the overseer of the &ldquo;Putrid Pits&rdquo; for his tessera. But
  disappointment was in waiting,&mdash;the overseer would not give the
  tessera.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have done what I could for
  thee, but I cannot risk my life. To-night they are to conduct the Christians
  to Cæsar&rsquo;s gardens. The prisons will be full of soldiers and officials.
  Shouldst thou be recognized, I and my children would be lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius understood that it would be vain to insist. The hope gleamed in
  him, however, that the soldiers who had seen him before would admit him even
  without a tessera; so, with the coming of night, he disguised himself as
  usual in the tunic of a corpse-bearer, and, winding a cloth around his head,
  betook himself to the prison.</p>

  <p>But that day the tesseræ were verified with greater care than usual; and
  what was more, the centurion Scevinus, a strict soldier, devoted soul and
  body to Cæsar, recognized Vinicius. But evidently in his iron-clad breast
  there glimmered yet some spark of pity for misfortunes. Instead of striking
  his spear in token of alarm, he led Vinicius aside and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Return to thy house, lord. I recognize thee; but not wishing thy
  ruin, I am silent. I cannot admit thee; go thy way, and may the gods send
  thee solace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou canst not admit me,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;but let me
  stand here and look at those who are led forth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My order does not forbid that,&rdquo; said Scevinus.</p>

  <p>Vinicius stood before the gate and waited. About midnight the prison gate
  was opened widely, and whole ranks of prisoners appeared,&mdash;men, women,
  and children, surrounded by armed pretorians. The night was very bright;
  hence it was possible to distinguish not only the forms, but the faces of the
  unfortunates. They went two abreast, in a long, gloomy train, amid stillness
  broken only by the clatter of weapons. So many were led out that all the
  dungeons must be empty, as it seemed. In the rear of the line Vinicius saw
  Glaucus the physician distinctly, but Lygia and Ursus were not among the
  condemned.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch61"
     name="ch61">CHAPTER LXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Darkness had not come when the first waves of people began
  to flow into Cæsar&rsquo;s gardens. The crowds, in holiday costume, crowned
  with flowers, joyous, singing, and some of them drunk, were going to look at
  the new, magnificent spectacle. Shouts of &ldquo;Semaxii! Sarmentitii!&rdquo;
  were heard on the Via Tecta, on the bridge of Æmilius, and from the other
  side of the Tiber, on the Triumphal Way, around the Circus of Nero, and off
  towards the Vatican Hill. In Rome people had been seen burnt on pillars
  before, but never had any one seen such a number of victims.</p>

  <p>Cæsar and Tigellinus, wishing to finish at once with the Christians and
  also to avoid infection, which from the prisons was spreading more and more
  through the city, had given command to empty all dungeons, so that there
  remained in them barely a few tens of people intended for the close of the
  spectacles. So, when the crowds had passed the gates, they were dumb with
  amazement. All the main and side alleys, which lay through dense groves and
  along lawns, thickets, ponds, fields, and squares filled with flowers, were
  packed with pillars smeared with pitch, to which Christians were fastened. In
  higher places, where the view was not hindered by trees, one could see whole
  rows of pillars and bodies decked with flowers, myrtle, and ivy, extending
  into the distance on high and low places, so far that, though the nearest
  were like masts of ships, the farthest seemed colored darts, or staffs thrust
  into the earth. The number of them surpassed the expectation of the
  multitude. One might suppose that a whole nation had been lashed to pillars
  for Rome&rsquo;s amusement and for Cæsar&rsquo;s. The throng of spectators
  stopped before single masts when their curiosity was roused by the form or
  the sex of the victim; they looked at the faces, the crowns, the garlands of
  ivy; then they went farther and farther, asking themselves with amazement,
  &ldquo;Could there have been so many criminals, or how could children barely
  able to walk have set fire to Rome?&rdquo; and astonishment passed by degrees
  into fear.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile darkness came, and the first stars twinkled in the sky. Near
  each condemned person a slave took his place, torch in hand; when the sound
  of trumpets was heard in various parts of the gardens, in sign that the
  spectacle was to begin, each slave put his torch to the foot of a pillar. The
  straw, hidden under the flowers and steeped in pitch, burned at once with a
  bright flame which, increasing every instant, withered the ivy, and rising
  embraced the feet of the victims. The people were silent; the gardens
  resounded with one immense groan and with cries of pain. Some victims,
  however, raising their faces toward the starry sky, began to sing, praising
  Christ. The people listened. But the hardest hearts were filled with terror
  when, on smaller pillars, children cried with shrill voices, &ldquo;Mamma!
  Mamma!&rdquo; A shiver ran through even spectators who were drunk when they
  saw little heads and innocent faces distorted with pain, or children fainting
  in the smoke which began to stifle them. But the flames rose, and seized new
  crowns of roses and ivy every instant. The main and side alleys were
  illuminated; the groups of trees, the lawns, and the flowery squares were
  illuminated; the water in pools and ponds was gleaming, the trembling leaves
  on the trees had grown rose-colored, and all was as visible as in daylight.
  When the odor of burnt bodies filled the gardens, slaves sprinkled between
  the pillars myrrh and aloes prepared purposely. In the crowds were heard here
  and there shouts,&mdash;whether of sympathy or delight and joy, it was
  unknown; and they increased every moment with the fire, which embraced the
  pillars, climbed to the breasts of the victims, shrivelled with burning
  breath the hair on their heads, threw veils over their blackened faces, and
  then shot up higher, as if showing the victory and triumph of that power
  which had given command to rouse it.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning of the spectacle Cæsar had appeared among the people
  in a magnificent quadriga of the Circus, drawn by four white steeds. He was
  dressed as a charioteer in the color of the Greens,&mdash;the court party and
  his. After him followed other chariots filled with courtiers in brilliant
  array, senators, priests, bacchantes, naked and crowned, holding pitchers of
  wine, and partly drunk, uttering wild shouts. At the side of these were
  musicians dressed as fauns and satyrs, who played on citharas, formingas,
  flutes, and horns. In other chariots advanced matrons and maidens of Rome,
  drunk also and half naked. Around the quadriga ran men who shook thyrses
  ornamented with ribbons; others beat drums; others scattered flowers.</p>

  <p>All that brilliant throng moved forward, shouting, &ldquo;Evoe!&rdquo; on
  the widest road of the garden, amidst smoke and processions of people. Cæsar,
  keeping near him Tigellinus and also Chilo, in whose terror he sought to find
  amusement, drove the steeds himself, and, advancing at a walk, looked at the
  burning bodies, and heard the shouts of the multitude. Standing on the lofty
  gilded chariot, surrounded by a sea of people who bent to his feet, in the
  glitter of the fire, in the golden crown of a circus-victor, he was a head
  above the courtiers and the crowd. He seemed a giant. His immense arms,
  stretched forward to hold the reins, seemed to bless the multitude. There was
  a smile on his face and in his blinking eyes; he shone above the throng as a
  sun or a deity, terrible but commanding and mighty.</p>

  <p>At times he stopped to look with more care at some maiden whose bosom had
  begun to shrink in the flames, or at the face of a child distorted by
  convulsions; and again he drove on, leading behind him a wild, excited
  retinue. At times he bowed to the people, then again he bent backward, drew
  in the golden reins, and spoke to Tigellinus. At last, when he had reached
  the great fountain in the middle of two crossing streets, he stepped from the
  quadriga, and, nodding to his attendants, mingled with the throng.</p>

  <p>He was greeted with shouts and plaudits. The bacchantes, the nymphs, the
  senators and Augustians, the priests, the fauns, satyrs, and soldiers
  surrounded him at once in an excited circle; but he, with Tigellinus on one
  side and Chilo on the other, walked around the fountain, about which were
  burning some tens of torches; stopping before each one, he made remarks on
  the victims, or jeered at the old Greek, on whose face boundless despair was
  depicted.</p>

  <p>At last he stood before a lofty mast decked with myrtle and ivy. The red
  tongues of fire had risen only to the knees of the victim; but it was
  impossible to see his face, for the green burning twigs had covered it with
  smoke. After a while, however, the light breeze of night turned away the
  smoke and uncovered the head of a man with gray beard falling on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>At sight of him Chilo was twisted into a lump like a wounded snake, and
  from his mouth came a cry more like cawing than a human voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucus! Glaucus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact, Glaucus the physician looked down from the burning pillar at him.
  Glaucus was alive yet. His face expressed pain, and was inclined forward, as
  if to look closely for the last time at his executioner, at the man who had
  betrayed him, robbed him of wife and children, set a murderer on him, and
  who, when all this had been forgiven in the name of Christ, had delivered him
  to executioners. Never had one person inflicted more dreadful or bloody
  wrongs on another. Now the victim was burning on the pitched pillar, and the
  executioner was standing at his feet. The eyes of Glaucus did nor leave the
  face of the Greek. At moments they were hidden by smoke; but when the breeze
  blew this away, Chilo saw again those eyes fixed on him. He rose and tried to
  flee, but had not strength. All at once his legs seemed of lead; an invisible
  hand seemed to hold him at that pillar with superhuman force. He was
  petrified. He felt that something was overflowing in him, something giving
  way; he felt that he had had a surfeit of blood and torture, that the end of
  his life was approaching, that everything was vanishing, Cæsar, the court,
  the multitude, and around him was only a kind of bottomless, dreadful black
  vacuum with no visible thing in it, save those eyes of a martyr which were
  summoning him to judgment. But Glaucus, bending his head lower down, looked
  at him fixedly. Those present divined that something was taking place between
  those two men. Laughter died on their lips, however, for in Chilo&rsquo;s
  face there was something terrible: such pain and fear had distorted it as if
  those tongues of fire were burning his body. On a sudden he staggered, and,
  stretching his arms upward, cried in a terrible and piercing
  voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucus! in Christ&rsquo;s name! forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It grew silent round about, a quiver ran through the spectators, and all
  eyes were raised involuntarily.</p>

  <p>The head of the martyr moved slightly, and from the top of the mast was
  heard a voice like a groan,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgive!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo threw himself on his face, and howled like a wild beast; grasping
  earth in both hands, he sprinkled it on his head. Meanwhile the flames shot
  up, seizing the breast and face of Glaucus; they unbound the myrtle crown on
  his head, and seized the ribbons on the top of the pillar, the whole of which
  shone with great blazing.</p>

  <p>Chilo stood up after a while with face so changed that to the Augustians
  he seemed another man. His eyes flashed with a light new to him, ecstasy
  issued from his wrinkled forehead; the Greek, incompetent a short time
  before, looked now like some priest visited by a divinity and ready to reveal
  unknown truths.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Has he gone mad?&rdquo; asked a number of
  voices.</p>

  <p>But he turned to the multitude, and, raising his right hand, cried, or
  rather shouted, in a voice so piercing that not only the Augustians but the
  multitude heard him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Roman people! I swear by my death, that innocent persons are
  perishing here. That is the incendiary!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he pointed his finger at Nero.</p>

  <p>Then came a moment of silence. The courtiers were benumbed. Chilo
  continued to stand with outstretched, trembling arm, and with finger pointed
  at Nero. All at once a tumult arose. The people, like a wave, urged by a
  sudden whirlwind, rushed toward the old man to look at him more closely. Here
  and there were heard cries, &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; In another place, &ldquo;Woe
  to us!&rdquo; In the throng a hissing and uproar began. &ldquo;Ahenobarbus!
  Matricide! Incendiary!&rdquo; Disorder increased every instant. The
  bacchantes screamed in heaven-piercing voices, and began to hide in the
  chariots. Then some pillars which were burned through, fell, scattered
  sparks, and increased the confusion. A blind dense wave of people swept away
  Chilo, and bore him to the depth of the garden.</p>

  <p>The pillars began to burn through in every direction and fall across the
  streets, filling alleys with smoke, sparks, the odor of burnt wood and burnt
  flesh. The nearer lights died. The gardens began to grow dark. The crowds,
  alarmed, gloomy, and disturbed, pressed toward the gates. News of what had
  happened passed from mouth to mouth, distorted and increased. Some said that
  Cæsar had fainted; others that he had confessed, saying that he had given
  command to burn Rome; others that he had fallen seriously ill; and still
  others that he had been borne out, as if dead, in the chariot. Here and there
  were heard voices of sympathy for the Christians: &ldquo;If they had not
  burned Rome, why so much blood, torture, and injustice? Will not the gods
  avenge the innocent, and what piacula can mollify them now?&rdquo; The words
  innoxia corpora were repeated oftener and oftener. Women expressed aloud
  their pity for children thrown in such numbers to wild beasts, nailed to
  crosses or burned in those cursed gardens! And finally pity was turned into
  abuse of Cæsar and Tigellinus. There were persons, too, who, stopping
  suddenly, asked themselves or others the question, &ldquo;What kind of
  divinity is that which gives such strength to meet torture and death?&rdquo;
  And they returned home in meditation.</p>

  <p>But Chilo was wandering about in the gardens, not knowing where to go or
  where to turn. Again he felt himself a weak, helpless, sick old man.</p>

  <p>Now he stumbled against partly burnt bodies; now he struck a torch, which
  sent a shower of sparks after him; now he sat down, and looked around with
  vacant stare. The gardens had become almost dark. The pale moon moving among
  the trees shone with uncertain light on the alleys, the dark pillars lying
  across them, and the partly burnt victims turned into shapeless lumps. But
  the old Greek thought that in the moon he saw the face of Glaucus, whose eyes
  were looking at him yet persistently, and he hid before the light. At last he
  went out of the shadow, in spite of himself; as if pushed by some hidden
  power, he turned toward the fountain where Glaucus had yielded up the
  spirit.</p>

  <p>Then some hand touched his shoulder. He turned, and saw an unknown person
  before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; exclaimed he, with terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paul of Tarsus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am accursed!&mdash;What dost thou wish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to save thee,&rdquo; answered the Apostle.</p>

  <p>Chilo supported himself against a tree. His legs bent under him, and his
  arms hung parallel with his body.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For me there is no salvation,&rdquo; said he, gloomily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou heard how God forgave the thief on the cross who pitied
  Him?&rdquo; inquired Paul.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know what I have done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw thy suffering, and heard thy testimony to the
  truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if a servant of Christ forgave thee in the hour of torture and
  death, why should Christ not forgive thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo seized his head with both hands, as if in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgiveness! for me, forgiveness!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our God is a God of mercy,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; repeated Chilo; and he began to groan like a man who
  lacks strength to control his pain and suffering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lean on me,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and go with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And taking him he went to the crossing of the streets, guided by the voice
  of the fountain, which seemed to weep in the night stillness over the bodies
  of those who had died in torture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our God is a God of mercy,&rdquo; repeated the Apostle. &ldquo;Wert
  thou to stand at the sea and cast in pebbles, couldst thou fill its depth
  with them? I tell thee that the mercy of Christ is as the sea, and that the
  sins and faults of men sink in it as pebbles in the abyss; I tell thee that
  it is like the sky which covers mountains, lands, and seas, for it is
  everywhere and has neither end nor limit. Thou hast suffered at the pillar of
  Glaucus. Christ saw thy suffering. Without reference to what may meet thee
  to-morrow, thou didst say, &lsquo;That is the incendiary,&rsquo; and Christ
  remembers thy words. Thy malice and falsehood are gone; in thy heart is left
  only boundless sorrow. Follow me and listen to what I say. I am he who hated
  Christ and persecuted His chosen ones. I did not want Him, I did not believe
  in Him till He manifested Himself and called me. Since then He is, for me,
  mercy. He has visited thee with compunction, with alarm, and with pain, to
  call thee to Himself. Thou didst hate Him, but He loved thee. Thou didst
  deliver His confessors to torture, but He wishes to forgive and save
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Immense sobbing shook the breast of the wretched man, sobbing by which the
  soul in him was rent to its depths; but Paul took possession of him, mastered
  him, led him away, as a soldier leads a captive.</p>

  <p>After a while the Apostle began again to speak:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me; I will lead thee to Him. For why else have I come to
  thee?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ commanded me to gather in souls in the name of love; hence I
  perform His service. Thou thinkest thyself accursed, but I say: Believe in
  Him, and salvation awaits thee. Thou thinkest that thou art hated, but I
  repeat that He loves thee. Look at me. Before I had Him I had nothing save
  malice, which dwelt in my heart, and now His love suffices me instead of
  father and mother, wealth and power. In Him alone is refuge. He alone will
  see thy sorrow, believe in thy misery, remove thy alarm, and raise thee to
  Himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he led him to the fountain, the silver stream of which
  gleamed from afar in the moonlight. Round about was silence; the gardens were
  empty, for slaves had removed the charred pillars and the bodies of the
  martyrs.</p>

  <p>Chilo threw himself on his knees with a groan, and hiding his face in his
  hands remained motionless. Paul raised his face to the stars. &ldquo;O
  Lord,&rdquo; prayed he, &ldquo;look on this wretched man, on his sorrow, his
  tears, and his suffering! O God of mercy, who hast shed Thy blood for our
  sins, forgive him, through Thy torment, Thy death and
  resurrection!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he was silent; but for a long time he looked toward the stars, and
  prayed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile from under his feet was heard a cry which resembled a
  groan,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Christ! O Christ! forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Paul approached the fountain then, and, taking water in his hand, turned
  to the kneeling wretch,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chilo!&mdash;I baptize thee in the name of the Father, Son, and
  Spirit. Amen!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chilo raised his head, opened his arms, and remained in that posture. The
  moon shone with full light on his white hair and on his equally white face,
  which was as motionless as if dead or cut out of stone. The moments passed
  one after another. From the great aviaries in the gardens of Domitian came
  the crowing of cocks; but Chilo remained kneeling, like a statue on a
  monument. At last he recovered, spoke to the Apostle, and asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What am I to do before death?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Paul was roused also from meditation on the measureless power which even
  such spirits as that of this Greek could not resist, and answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have faith, and bear witness to the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went out together. At the gate the Apostle blessed the old man again,
  and they parted. Chilo himself insisted on this, for after what had happened
  he knew that Cæsar and Tigellinus would give command to pursue him.</p>

  <p>Indeed he was not mistaken. When he returned home, he found the house
  surrounded by pretorians, who led him away, and took him under direction of
  Scevinus to the Palatine.</p>

  <p>Cæsar had gone to rest, but Tigellinus was waiting. When he saw the
  unfortunate Greek, he greeted him with a calm but ominous face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast committed the crime of treason,&rdquo; said he,
  &ldquo;and punishment will not pass thee; but if to-morrow thou testify in
  the amphitheatre that thou wert drunk and mad, and that the authors of the
  conflagration are Christians, thy punishment will be limited to stripes and
  exile.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do that,&rdquo; answered Chilo, calmly.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus approached him with slow step, and with a voice also low but
  terrible,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Thou canst not, Greek dog?
  Wert thou not drunk, and dost thou not understand what is waiting for thee?
  Look there!&rdquo; and he pointed to a corner of the atrium in which, near a
  long wooden bench, stood four Thracian slaves in the shade with ropes, and
  with pincers in their hands.</p>

  <p>But Chilo answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rage seized Tigellinus, but he restrained himself yet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou seen,&rdquo; inquired he, &ldquo;how Christians die? Dost
  wish to die in that way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man raised his pale face; for a time his lips moved in silence,
  and he answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I too believe in Christ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus looked at him with amazement. &ldquo;Dog, thou hast gone mad in
  fact!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And suddenly the rage in his breast broke its bounds. Springing at Chilo,
  he caught him by the beard with both hands, hurled him to the floor, trampled
  him, repeating, with foam on his lips,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt retract! thou wilt!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot!&rdquo; answered Chilo from the floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the tortures with him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this command the Thracians seized the old man, and placed him on the
  bench; then, fastening him with ropes to it, they began to squeeze his thin
  shanks with pincers. But when they were tying him he kissed their hands with
  humility; then he closed his eyes, and seemed dead.</p>

  <p>He was alive, though; for when Tigellinus bent over him and inquired once
  again, &ldquo;Wilt thou retract?&rdquo; his white lips moved slightly, and
  from them came the barely audible whisper,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus gave command to stop the torture, and began to walk up and down
  in the atrium with a face distorted by anger, but helpless. At last a new
  idea came to his head, for he turned to the Thracians and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tear out his tongue!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch62"
     name="ch62">CHAPTER LXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The drama &ldquo;Aureolus&rdquo; was given usually in
  theatres or amphitheatres, so arranged that they could open and present as it
  were two separate stages. But after the spectacle in the gardens of Cæsar the
  usual method was omitted; for in this case the problem was to let the
  greatest number of people look at a slave who, in the drama, is devoured by a
  bear. In the theatres the role of the bear is played by an actor sewed up in
  a skin, but this time the representation was to be real. This was a new idea
  of Tigellinus. At first Cæsar refused to come, but changed his mind at
  persuasion of the favorite. Tigellinus explained that after what had happened
  in the gardens it was all the more his duty to appear before the people, and
  he guaranteed that the crucified slave would not insult him as had Crispus.
  The people were somewhat sated and tired of blood-spilling; hence a new
  distribution of lottery tickets and gifts was promised, as well as a feast,
  for the spectacle was to be in the evening, in a brilliantly lighted
  amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>About dusk the whole amphitheatre was packed; the Augustians, with
  Tigellinus at the head of them, came to a man,&mdash;not only for the
  spectacle itself, but to show their devotion to Cæsar and their opinion of
  Chilo, of whom all Rome was then talking.</p>

  <p>They whispered to one another that Cæsar, when returning from the gardens,
  had fallen into a frenzy and could not sleep, that terrors and wonderful
  visions had attacked him; therefore he had announced on the following morning
  his early journey to Achæa. But others denied this, declaring that he would
  be all the more pitiless to the Christians. Cowards, however, were not
  lacking, who foresaw that the accusation which Chilo had thrown into
  Cæsar&rsquo;s face might have the worst result possible. In conclusion, there
  were those who through humanity begged Tigellinus to stop persecution.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See whither ye are going,&rdquo; said Barcus Soranus. &ldquo;Ye
  wished to allay people&rsquo;s anger and convince them that punishment was
  falling on the guilty; the result is just the opposite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; added Antistius Verus, &ldquo;all whisper to one
  another now that the Christians were innocent. If that be cleverness, Chilo
  was right when he said that your brains could be held in a
  nutshell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus turned to them and said: &ldquo;Barcus Soranus, people whisper
  also to one another that thy daughter Servilia secreted her Christian slaves
  from Cæsar&rsquo;s justice; they say the same also of thy wife,
  Antistius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is not true!&rdquo; exclaimed Barcus, with alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your divorced women wished to ruin my wife, whose virtue they
  envy,&rdquo; said Antistius Verus, with no less alarm.</p>

  <p>But others spoke of Chilo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has happened to him?&rdquo; asked Eprius Marcellus. &ldquo;He
  delivered them himself into the hands of Tigellinus; from a beggar he became
  rich; it was possible for him to live out his days in peace, have a splendid
  funeral, and a tomb: but, no! All at once he preferred to lose everything and
  destroy himself; he must, in truth, be a maniac.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a maniac, but he has become a Christian,&rdquo; said
  Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Vitelius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said,&rdquo; put in Vestinius, &ldquo;&rsquo;Kill
  Christians if ye like; but believe me ye cannot war with their divinity. With
  it there is no jesting&rsquo;? See what is taking place. I have not burned
  Rome; but if Cæsar permitted I would give a hecatomb at once to their
  divinity. And all should do the same, for I repeat: With it there is no
  jesting! Remember my words to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I said something else,&rdquo; added Petronius.
  &ldquo;Tigellinus laughed when I said that they were arming, but I say
  more,&mdash;they are conquering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that? how is that?&rdquo; inquired a number of voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Pollux, they are! For if such a man as Chilo could not resist
  them, who can? If ye think that after every spectacle the Christians do not
  increase, become coppersmiths, or go to shaving beards, for then ye will know
  better what people think, and what is happening in the city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He speaks pure truth, by the sacred peplus of Diana,&rdquo; cried
  Vestinius.</p>

  <p>But Barcus turned to Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is thy conclusion?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I conclude where ye began,&mdash;there has been enough of
  bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tigellinus looked at him jeeringly,&mdash;&ldquo;Ei!&mdash;a little
  more!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thy head is not sufficient, thou hast another on thy
  cane,&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>Further conversation was interrupted by the coming of Cæsar, who occupied
  his place in company with Pythagoras. Immediately after began the
  representation of &ldquo;Aureolus,&rdquo; to which not much attention was
  paid, for the minds of the audience were fixed on Chilo. The spectators,
  familiar with blood and torture, were bored; they hissed, gave out shouts
  uncomplimentary to the court, and demanded the bear scene, which for them was
  the only thing of interest. Had it not been for gifts and the hope of seeing
  Chilo, the spectacle would not have held the audience.</p>

  <p>At last the looked-for moment came. Servants of the Circus brought in
  first a wooden cross, so low that a bear standing on his hind feet might
  reach the martyr&rsquo;s breast; then two men brought, or rather dragged in,
  Chilo, for as the bones in his legs were broken, he was unable to walk alone.
  They laid him down and nailed him to the wood so quickly that the curious
  Augustians had not even a good look at him, and only after the cross had been
  fixed in the place prepared for it did all eyes turn to the victim. But it
  was a rare person who could recognize in that naked man the former Chilo.
  After the tortures which Tigellinus had commanded, there was not one drop of
  blood in his face, and only on his white beard was evident a red trace left
  by blood after they had torn his tongue out. Through the transparent skin it
  was quite possible to see his bones. He seemed far older also, almost
  decrepit. Formerly his eyes cast glances ever filled with disquiet and
  ill-will, his watchful face reflected constant alarm and uncertainty; now his
  face had an expression of pain, but it was as mild and calm as faces of the
  sleeping or the dead. Perhaps remembrance of that thief on the cross whom
  Christ had forgiven lent him confidence; perhaps, also, he said in his soul
  to the merciful God,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Lord, I bit like a venomous worm; but all my life I was
  unfortunate. I was famishing from hunger, people trampled on me, beat me,
  jeered at me. I was poor and very unhappy, and now they put me to torture and
  nail me to a cross; but Thou, O Merciful, wilt not reject me in this
  hour!&rdquo; Peace descended evidently into his crushed heart. No one
  laughed, for there was in that crucified man something so calm, he seemed so
  old, so defenceless, so weak, calling so much for pity with his lowliness,
  that each one asked himself unconsciously how it was possible to torture and
  nail to crosses men who would die soon in any case. The crowd was silent.
  Among the Augustians Vestinius, bending to right and left, whispered in a
  terrified voice, &ldquo;See how they die!&rdquo; Others were looking for the
  bear, wishing the spectacle to end at the earliest.</p>

  <p>The bear came into the arena at last, and, swaying from side to side a
  head which hung low, he looked around from beneath his forehead, as if
  thinking of something or seeking something. At last he saw the cross and the
  naked body. He approached it, and stood on his hind legs; but after a moment
  he dropped again on his fore-paws, and sitting under the cross began to
  growl, as if in his heart of a beast pity for that remnant of a man had made
  itself heard.</p>

  <p>Cries were heard from Circus slaves urging on the bear, but the people
  were silent.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Chilo raised his head with slow motion, and for a time moved his
  eyes over the audience. At last his glance rested somewhere on the highest
  rows of the amphitheatre; his breast moved with more life, and something
  happened which caused wonder and astonishment. That face became bright with a
  smile; a ray of light, as it were, encircled that forehead; his eyes were
  uplifted before death, and after a while two great tears which had risen
  between the lids flowed slowly down his face.</p>

  <p>And he died.</p>

  <p>At that same moment a resonant manly voice high up under the velarium
  exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace to the martyrs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Deep silence reigned in the amphitheatre.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch63"
     name="ch63">CHAPTER LXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After the spectacle in Cæsar&rsquo;s gardens the prisons
  were emptied considerably. It is true that victims suspected of the Oriental
  superstition were seized yet and imprisoned, but pursuit brought in fewer and
  fewer persons,&mdash;barely enough for coming exhibitions, which were to
  follow quickly. People were sated with blood; they showed growing weariness,
  and increasing alarm because of the unparalleled conduct of the condemned.
  Fears like those of the superstitious Vestinius seized thousands of people.
  Among the crowds tales more and more wonderful were related of the
  vengefulness of the Christian God. Prison typhus, which had spread through
  the city, increased the general dread. The number of funerals was evident,
  and it was repeated from ear to ear that fresh piacula were needed to mollify
  the unknown god. Offerings were made in the temples to Jove and Libitina. At
  last, in spite of every effort of Tigellinus and his assistants, the opinion
  kept spreading that the city had been burned at command of Cæsar, and that
  the Christians were suffering innocently.</p>

  <p>But for this very reason Nero and Tigellinus were untiring in persecution.
  To calm the multitude, fresh orders were issued to distribute wheat, wine,
  and olives. To relieve owners, new rules were published to facilitate the
  building of houses; and others touching width of streets and materials to be
  used in building so as to avoid fires in future. Cæsar himself attended
  sessions of the Senate, and counselled with the &ldquo;fathers&rdquo; on the
  good of the people and the city; but not a shadow of favor fell on the
  doomed. The ruler of the world was anxious, above all, to fix in
  people&rsquo;s minds a conviction that such merciless punishments could
  strike only the guilty. In the Senate no voice was heard on behalf of the
  Christians, for no one wished to offend Cæsar; and besides, those who looked
  farther into the future insisted that the foundations of Roman rule could not
  stand against the new faith.</p>

  <p>The dead and the dying were given to their relatives, as Roman law took no
  vengeance on the dead. Vinicius received a certain solace from the thought
  that if Lygia died he would bury her in his family tomb, and rest near her.
  At that time he had no hope of rescuing her; half separated from life, he was
  himself wholly absorbed in Christ, and dreamed no longer of any union except
  an eternal one. His faith had become simply boundless; for it eternity seemed
  something incomparably truer and more real than the fleeting life which he
  had lived up to that time. His heart was overflowing with concentrated
  enthusiasm. Though yet alive, he had changed into a being almost immaterial,
  which desiring complete liberation for itself desired it also for another. He
  imagined that when free he and Lygia would each take the other&rsquo;s hand
  and go to heaven, where Christ would bless them, and let them live in light
  as peaceful and boundless as the light of dawn. He merely implored Christ to
  spare Lygia the torments of the Circus, and let her fall asleep calmly in
  prison; he felt with perfect certainty that he himself would die at the same
  time. In view of the sea of blood which had been shed, he did not even think
  it permitted to hope that she alone would be spared. He had heard from Peter
  and Paul that they, too, must die as martyrs. The sight of Chilo on the cross
  had convinced him that even a martyr&rsquo;s death could be sweet; hence he
  wished it for Lygia and himself as the change of an evil, sad, and oppressive
  fate for a better.</p>

  <p>At times he had a foretaste of life beyond the grave. That sadness which
  hung over the souls of both was losing its former burning bitterness, and
  changing gradually into a kind of trans-terrestrial, calm abandon to the will
  of God. Vinicius, who formerly had toiled against the current, had struggled
  and tortured himself, yielded now to the stream, believing that it would bear
  him to eternal calm. He divined, too, that Lygia, as well as he, was
  preparing for death,&mdash;that, in spite of the prison walls separating
  them, they were advancing together; and he smiled at that thought as at
  happiness.</p>

  <p>In fact, they were advancing with as much agreement as if they had
  exchanged thoughts every day for a long time. Neither had Lygia any desire,
  any hope, save the hope of a life beyond the grave. Death was presented to
  her not only as a liberation from the terrible walls of the prison, from the
  hands of Cæsar and Tigellinus,&mdash;not only as liberation, but as the hour
  of her marriage to Vinicius. In view of this unshaken certainty, all else
  lost importance. After death would come her happiness, which was even
  earthly, so that she waited for it also as a betrothed waits for the
  wedding-day.</p>

  <p>And that immense current of faith, which swept away from life and bore
  beyond the grave thousands of those first confessors, bore away Ursus also.
  Neither had he in his heart been resigned to Lygia&rsquo;s death; but when
  day after day through the prison walls came news of what was happening in the
  amphitheatres and the gardens, when death seemed the common, inevitable lot
  of all Christians and also their good, higher than all mortal conceptions of
  happiness, he did not dare to pray to Christ to deprive Lygia of that
  happiness or to delay it for long years. In his simple barbarian soul he
  thought, besides, that more of those heavenly delights would belong to the
  daughter of the Lygian chief, that she would have more of them than would a
  whole crowd of simple ones to whom he himself belonged, and that in eternal
  glory she would sit nearer to the &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo; than would others. He
  had heard, it is true, that before God men are equal; but a conviction was
  lingering at the bottom of his soul that the daughter of a leader, and
  besides of a leader of all the Lygians, was not the same as the first slave
  one might meet. He hoped also that Christ would let him continue to serve
  her. His one secret wish was to die on a cross as the &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo;
  died. But this seemed a happiness so great that he hardly dared to pray for
  it, though he knew that in Rome even the worst criminals were crucified. He
  thought that surely he would be condemned to die under the teeth of wild
  beasts; and this was his one sorrow. From childhood he had lived in
  impassable forests, amid continual hunts, in which, thanks to his superhuman
  strength, he was famous among the Lygians even before he had grown to
  manhood. This occupation had become for him so agreeable that later, when in
  Rome, and forced to live without hunting, he went to vivaria and
  amphitheatres just to look at beasts known and unknown to him. The sight of
  these always roused in the man an irresistible desire for struggle and
  killing; so now he feared in his soul that on meeting them in the
  amphitheatre he would be attacked by thoughts unworthy of a Christian, whose
  duty it was to die piously and patiently. But in this he committed himself to
  Christ, and found other and more agreeable thoughts to comfort him. Hearing
  that the &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo; had declared war against the powers of hell and
  evil spirits with which the Christian faith connected all pagan divinities,
  he thought that in this war he might serve the &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo; greatly,
  and serve better than others, for he could not help believing that his soul
  was stronger than the souls of other martyrs. Finally, he prayed whole days,
  rendered service to prisoners, helped overseers, and comforted his queen, who
  complained at times that in her short life she had not been able to do so
  many good deeds as the renowned Tabitha of whom Peter the Apostle had told
  her. Even the prison guards, who feared the terrible strength of this giant,
  since neither bars nor chains could restrain it, came to love him at last for
  his mildness. Amazed at his good temper, they asked more than once what its
  cause was. He spoke with such firm certainty of the life waiting after death
  for him, that they listened with surprise, seeing for the first time that
  happiness might penetrate a dungeon which sunlight could not reach. And when
  he urged them to believe in the &ldquo;Lamb,&rdquo; it occurred to more than
  one of those people that his own service was the service of a slave, his own
  life the life of an unfortunate; and he fell to thinking over his evil fate,
  the only end to which was death.</p>

  <p>But death brought new fear, and promised nothing beyond; while that giant
  and that maiden, who was like a flower cast on the straw of the prison, went
  toward it with delight, as toward the gates of happiness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch64"
     name="ch64">CHAPTER LXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One evening Scevinus, a Senator, visited Petronius and began
  a long conversation, touching the grievous times in which they were living,
  and also touching Cæsar. He spoke so openly that Petronius, though his
  friend, began to be cautious. Scevinus complained that the world was living
  madly and unjustly, that all must end in some catastrophe more dreadful still
  than the burning of Rome. He said that even Augustians were dissatisfied;
  that Fenius Rufus, second prefect of the pretorians, endured with the
  greatest effort the vile orders of Tigellinus; and that all Seneca&rsquo;s
  relatives were driven to extremes by Cæsar&rsquo;s conduct as well toward his
  old master as toward Lucan. Finally, he began to hint of the dissatisfaction
  of the people, and even of the pretorians, the greater part of whom had been
  won by Fenius Rufus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou say this?&rdquo; inquired Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out of care for Cæsar,&rdquo; said Scevinus. &ldquo;I have a
  distant relative among the pretorians, also Scevinus; through him I know what
  takes place in the camp. Disaffection is growing there also; Caligula,
  knowest thou, was mad too, and see what happened. Cassius Chærea appeared.
  That was a dreadful deed, and surely there is no one among us to praise it;
  still Chærea freed the world of a monster.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is thy meaning as follows: &rsquo;I do not praise Chærea, but he
  was a perfect man, and would that the gods had given us as many such as
  possible&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired Petronius.</p>

  <p>But Scevinus changed the conversation, and began all at once to praise
  Piso, exalting his family, his nobility of mind, his attachment to his wife,
  and, finally, his intellect, his calmness, and his wonderful gift of winning
  people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar is childless,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and all see his
  successor in Piso. Doubtless, too, every man would help him with whole soul
  to gain power. Fenius Rufus loves him; the relatives of Annæus are devoted to
  him altogether. Plautius Lateranus and Tullius Senecio would spring into fire
  for him; as would Natalis, and Subrius Flavius, and Sulpicius Asper, and
  Afranius Quinetianus, and even Vestinius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From this last man not much will result to Piso,&rdquo; replied
  Petronius. &ldquo;Vestinius is afraid of his own shadow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vestinius fears dreams and spirits,&rdquo; answered Scevinus,
  &ldquo;but he is a practical man, whom people wish wisely to make consul.
  That in his soul he is opposed to persecuting Christians, thou shouldst not
  take ill of him, for it concerns thee too that this madness should
  cease.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not me, but Vinicius,&rdquo; answered Petronius. &ldquo;Out of
  concern for Vinicius, I should like to save a certain maiden; but I cannot,
  for I have fallen out of favor with Ahenobarbus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that? Dost thou not notice that Cæsar is approaching thee
  again, and beginning to talk with thee? And I will tell thee why. He is
  preparing again for Achæa, where he is to sing songs in Greek of his own
  composition. He is burning for that journey; but also he trembles at thought
  of the cynical genius of the Greeks. He imagines that either the greatest
  triumph may meet him or the greatest failure. He needs good counsel, and he
  knows that no one can give it better than thou. This is why thou art
  returning to favor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lucan might take my place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bronzebeard hates Lucan, and in his soul has written down death for
  the poet. He is merely seeking a pretext, for he seeks pretexts
  always.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Castor!&rdquo; said Petronius, &ldquo;that may be. But I might
  have still another way for a quick return to favor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To repeat to Bronzebeard what thou hast told me just
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have said nothing!&rdquo; cried Scevinus, with alarm.</p>

  <p>Petronius placed his hand upon the Senator&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Thou
  hast called Cæsar a madman, thou hast foreseen the heirship of Piso, and hast
  said, &lsquo;Lucan understands that there is need to hasten.&rsquo; What
  wouldst thou hasten, carissime?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Scevinus grew pale, and for a moment each looked into the eyes of the
  other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt not repeat!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the hips of Kypris, I will not! How well thou knowest me! No; I
  will not repeat. I have heard nothing, and, moreover, I wish to hear nothing.
  Dost understand? Life is too short to make any undertaking worth the while. I
  beg thee only to visit Tigellinus to-day, and talk with him as long as thou
  hast with me of whatever may please thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that should Tigellinus ever say to me, &lsquo;Scevinus was with
  thee,&rsquo; I might answer, &lsquo;He was with thee, too, that very
  day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Scevinus, when he heard this, broke the ivory cane which he had in his
  hand, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;May the evil fall on this stick! I shall be with
  Tigellinus to-day, and later at Nerva&rsquo;s feast. Thou, too, wilt be
  there? In every case till we meet in the amphitheatre, where the last of the
  Christians will appear the day after tomorrow. Till we meet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After to-morrow!&rdquo; repeated Petronius, when alone.
  &ldquo;There is no time to lose. Ahenobarbus will need me really in Achæa;
  hence he may count with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he determined to try the last means.</p>

  <p>In fact, at Nerva&rsquo;s feast Cæsar himself asked that Petronius recline
  opposite, for he wished to speak with the arbiter about Achæa and the cities
  in which he might appear with hopes of the greatest success. He cared most
  for the Athenians, whom he feared. Other Augustians listened to this
  conversation with attention, so as to seize crumbs of the arbiter&rsquo;s
  opinions, and give them out later on as their own.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me that I have not lived up to this time,&rdquo; said
  Nero, &ldquo;and that my birth will come only in Greece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt be born to new glory and immortality,&rdquo; answered
  Petronius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust that this is true, and that Apollo will not seem jealous.
  If I return in triumph, I will offer him such a hecatomb as no god has had so
  far.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Scevinus fell to repeating the lines of Horace:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sic te diva potens Cypri, Sic fratres Helenæ, lucida sidera,
  Ventorumque regat Pater-&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The vessel is ready at Naples,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I should
  like to go even tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this Petronius rose, and, looking straight into Nero&rsquo;s eyes,
  said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Permit me, O divinity, to celebrate a wedding-feast, to which I
  shall invite thee before others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A wedding-feast! What wedding-feast?&rdquo; inquired Nero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That of Vinicius with thy hostage the daughter of the Lygian king.
  She is in prison at present, it is true; but as a hostage she is not subject
  to imprisonment, and, secondly, thou thyself hast permitted Vinicius to marry
  her; and as thy sentences, like those of Zeus, are unchangeable, thou wilt
  give command to free her from prison, and I will give her to thy
  favorite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cool blood and calm self-possession with which Petronius spoke
  disturbed Nero, who was disturbed whenever any one spoke in that fashion to
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said he, dropping his eyes. &ldquo;I have thought of
  her and of that giant who killed Croton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case both are saved,&rdquo; answered Petronius, calmly.</p>

  <p>But Tigellinus came to the aid of his master: &ldquo;She is in prison by
  the will of Cæsar; thou thyself hast said, O Petronius, that his sentences
  are unchangeable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All present, knowing the history of Vinicius and Lygia, understood
  perfectly what the question was; hence they were silent, curious as to the
  end of the conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is in prison against the will of Cæsar and through thy error,
  through thy ignorance of the law of nations,&rdquo; said Petronius, with
  emphasis. &ldquo;Thou art a naive man, Tigellinus; but even thou wilt not
  assert that she burnt Rome, and if thou wert to do so, Cæsar would not
  believe thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Nero had recovered and begun to half close his near-sighted eyes with
  an expression of indescribable malice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius is right,&rdquo; said he, after a while.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus looked at him with amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Petronius is right,&rdquo; repeated Nero; &ldquo;to-morrow the
  gates of the prison will be open to her, and of the marriage feast we will
  speak the day after at the amphitheatre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have lost again,&rdquo; thought Petronius.</p>

  <p>When he had returned home, he was so certain that the end of Lygia&rsquo;s
  life had come that he sent a trusty freedman to the amphitheatre to bargain
  with the chief of the spoliarium for the delivery of her body, since he
  wished to give it to Vinicius.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch65"
     name="ch65">CHAPTER LXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Evening exhibitions, rare up to that period and given only
  exceptionally, became common in Nero&rsquo;s time, both in the Circus and
  amphitheatre. The Augustians liked them, frequently because they were
  followed by feasts and drinking-bouts which lasted till daylight. Though the
  people were sated already with blood-spilling, still, when the news went
  forth that the end of the games was approaching, and that the last of the
  Christians were to die at an evening spectacle, a countless audience
  assembled in the amphitheatre. The Augustians came to a man, for they
  understood that it would not be a common spectacle; they knew that Cæsar had
  determined to make for himself a tragedy out of the suffering of Vinicius.
  Tigellinus had kept secret the kind of punishment intended for the betrothed
  of the young tribune; but that merely roused general curiosity. Those who had
  seen Lygia at the house of Plautius told wonders of her beauty. Others were
  occupied above all with the question, would they see her really on the arena
  that day; for many of those who had heard the answer given Petronius and
  Nerva by Cæsar explained it in two ways: some supposed simply that Nero would
  give or perhaps had given the maiden to Vinicius; they remembered that she
  was a hostage, hence free to worship whatever divinities she liked, and that
  the law of nations did not permit her punishment.</p>

  <p>Uncertainty, waiting, and curiosity had mastered all spectators. Cæsar
  arrived earlier than usual; and immediately at his coming people whispered
  that something uncommon would happen, for besides Tigellinus and Vatinius,
  Cæsar had with him Cassius, a centurion of enormous size and gigantic
  strength, whom he summoned only when he wished to have a defender at his
  side,&mdash;for example, when he desired night expeditions to the Subura,
  where he arranged the amusement called &ldquo;sagatio,&rdquo; which consisted
  in tossing on a soldier&rsquo;s mantle maidens met on the way. It was noted
  also that certain precautions had been taken in the amphitheatre itself. The
  pretorian guards were increased; command over them was held, not by a
  centurion, but by the tribune Subrius Flavius, known hitherto for blind
  attachment to Nero. It was understood, then, that Cæsar wished in every case
  to guard himself against an outburst of despair from Vinicius, and curiosity
  rose all the more.</p>

  <p>Every eye was turned with strained gaze to the place where the unfortunate
  lover was sitting. He was exceedingly pale, and his forehead was covered with
  drops of sweat; he was in as much doubt as were other spectators, but alarmed
  to the lowest depth of his soul. Petronius knew not what would happen; he was
  silent, except that, while turning from Nerva, he asked Vinicius whether he
  was ready for everything, and next, whether he would remain at the spectacle.
  To both questions Vinicius answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but a shudder passed
  through his whole body; he divined that Petronius did not ask without reason.
  For some time he had lived with only half his life,&mdash;he had sunk in
  death, and reconciled himself to Lygia&rsquo;s death, since for both it was
  to be liberation and marriage; but he learned now that it was one thing to
  think of the last moment when it was distant as of a quiet dropping asleep,
  and another to look at the torment of a person dearer to one than life. All
  sufferings endured formerly rose in him anew. Despair, which had been set at
  rest, began again to cry in his soul; the former desire to save Lygia at any
  price seized him anew. Beginning with the morning, he had tried to go to the
  cunicula to be sure that she was there; but the pretorians watched every
  entrance, and orders were so strict that the soldiers, even those whom he
  knew, would not be softened by prayers or gold. It seemed to the tribune that
  uncertainty would kill him before he should see the spectacle. Somewhere at
  the bottom of his heart the hope was still throbbing, that perhaps Lygia was
  not in the amphitheatre, that his fears were groundless. At times he seized
  on this hope with all his strength. He said in his soul that Christ might
  take her to Himself out of the prison, but could not permit her torture in
  the Circus. Formerly he was resigned to the divine will in everything; now,
  when repulsed from the doors of the cunicula, he returned to his place in the
  amphitheatre, and when he learned, from the curious glances turned on him,
  that the most dreadful suppositions might be true, he began to implore in his
  soul with passionateness almost approaching a threat. &ldquo;Thou
  canst!&rdquo; repeated he, clenching his fists convulsively, &ldquo;Thou
  canst!&rdquo; Hitherto he had not supposed that that moment when present
  would be so terrible. Now, without clear consciousness of what was happening
  in his mind, he had the feeling that if he should see Lygia tortured, his
  love for God would be turned to hatred, and his faith to despair. But he was
  amazed at the feeling, for he feared to offend Christ, whom he was imploring
  for mercy and miracles. He implored no longer for her life; he wished merely
  that she should die before they brought her to the arena, and from the abyss
  of his pain he repeated in spirt: &ldquo;Do not refuse even this, and I will
  love Thee still more than hitherto.&rdquo; And then his thoughts raged as a
  sea torn by a whirlwind. A desire for blood and vengeance was roused in him.
  He was seized by a mad wish to rush at Nero and stifle him there in presence
  of all the spectators; but he felt that desire to be a new offence against
  Christ, and a breach of His command. To his head flew at times flashes of
  hope that everything before which his soul was trembling would be turned
  aside by an almighty and merciful hand; but they were quenched at once, as if
  in measureless sorrow that He who could destroy that Circus with one word and
  save Lygia had abandoned her, though she trusted in Him and loved Him with
  all the strength of her pure heart. And he thought, moreover, that she was
  lying there in that dark place, weak, defenceless, deserted, abandoned to the
  whim or disfavor of brutal guards, drawing her last breath, perhaps, while he
  had to wait, helpless, in that dreadful amphitheatre, without knowing what
  torture was prepared for her, or what he would witness in a moment. Finally,
  as a man falling over a precipice grasps at everything which grows on the
  edge of it, so did he grasp with both hands at the thought that faith of
  itself could save her. That one method remained! Peter had said that faith
  could move the earth to its foundations.</p>

  <p>Hence he rallied; he crushed doubt in himself, he compressed his whole
  being into the sentence, &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; and he looked for a
  miracle.</p>

  <p>But as an overdrawn cord may break, so exertion broke him. The pallor of
  death covered his face, and his body relaxed. He thought then that his prayer
  had been heard, for he was dying. It seemed to him that Lygia must surely die
  too, and that Christ would take them to Himself in that way. The arena, the
  white togas, the countless spectators, the light of thousands of lamps and
  torches, all vanished from his vision.</p>

  <p>But his weakness did not last long. After a while he roused himself, or
  rather the stamping of the impatient multitude roused him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art ill,&rdquo; said Petronius; &ldquo;give command to bear
  thee home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And without regard to what Cæsar would say, he rose to support Vinicius
  and go out with him. His heart was filled with pity, and, moreover, he was
  irritated beyond endurance because Cæsar was looking through the emerald at
  Vinicius, studying his pain with satisfaction, to describe it afterwards,
  perhaps, in pathetic strophes, and win the applause of hearers.</p>

  <p>Vinicius shook his head. He might die in that amphitheatre, but he could
  not go out of it. Moreover the spectacle might begin any moment.</p>

  <p>In fact, at that very instant almost, the prefect of the city waved a red
  handkerchief, the hinges opposite Cæsar&rsquo;s podium creaked, and out of
  the dark gully came Ursus into the brightly lighted arena.</p>

  <p>The giant blinked, dazed evidently by the glitter of the arena; then he
  pushed into the centre, gazing around as if to see what he had to meet. It
  was known to all the Augustians and to most of the spectators that he was the
  man who had stifled Croton; hence at sight of him a murmur passed along every
  bench. In Rome there was no lack of gladiators larger by far than the common
  measure of man, but Roman eyes had never seen the like of Ursus. Cassius,
  standing in Cæsar&rsquo;s podium, seemed puny compared with that Lygian.
  Senators, vestals, Cæsar, the Augustians, and the people gazed with the
  delight of experts at his mighty limbs as large as tree-trunks, at his breast
  as large as two shields joined together, and his arms of a Hercules. The
  murmur rose every instant. For those multitudes there could be no higher
  pleasure than to look at those muscles in play in the exertion of a struggle.
  The murmur rose to shouts, and eager questions were put: &ldquo;Where do the
  people live who can produce such a giant?&rdquo; He stood there, in the
  middle of the amphitheatre, naked, more like a stone colossus than a man,
  with a collected expression, and at the same time the sad look of a
  barbarian; and while surveying the empty arena, he gazed wonderingly with his
  blue childlike eyes, now at the spectators, now at Cæsar, now at the grating
  of the cunicula, whence, as he thought, his executioners would come.</p>

  <p>At the moment when he stepped into the arena his simple heart was beating
  for the last time with the hope that perhaps a cross was waiting for him; but
  when he saw neither the cross nor the hole in which it might be put, he
  thought that he was unworthy of such favor,&mdash;that he would find death in
  another way, and surely from wild beasts. He was unarmed, and had determined
  to die as became a confessor of the &ldquo;Lamb,&rdquo; peacefully and
  patiently. Meanwhile he wished to pray once more to the Saviour; so he knelt
  on the arena, joined his hands, and raised his eyes toward the stars which
  were glittering in the lofty opening of the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>That act displeased the crowds. They had had enough of those Christians
  who died like sheep. They understood that if the giant would not defend
  himself the spectacle would be a failure. Here and there hisses were heard.
  Some began to cry for scourgers, whose office it was to lash combatants
  unwilling to fight. But soon all had grown silent, for no one knew what was
  waiting for the giant, nor whether he would not be ready to struggle when he
  met death eye to eye.</p>

  <p>In fact, they had not long to wait. Suddenly the shrill sound of brazen
  trumpets was heard, and at that signal a grating opposite Cæsar&rsquo;s
  podium was opened, and into the arena rushed, amid shouts of beast-keepers,
  an enormous German aurochs, bearing on his head the naked body of a
  woman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lygia! Lygia!&rdquo; cried Vinicius.</p>

  <p>Then he seized his hair near the temples, squirmed like a man who feels a
  sharp dart in his body, and began to repeat in hoarse accents,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe! I believe! O Christ, a miracle!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he did not even feel that Petronius covered his head that moment with
  the toga. It seemed to him that death or pain had closed his eyes. He did not
  look, he did not see. The feeling of some awful emptiness possessed him. In
  his head there remained not a thought; his lips merely repeated, as if in
  madness,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe! I believe! I believe!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This time the amphitheatre was silent. The Augustians rose in their
  places, as one man, for in the arena something uncommon had happened. That
  Lygian, obedient and ready to die, when he saw his queen on the horns of the
  wild beast, sprang up, as if touched by living fire, and bending forward he
  ran at the raging animal.</p>

  <p>From all breasts a sudden cry of amazement was heard, after which came
  deep silence.</p>

  <p>The Lygian fell on the raging bull in a twinkle, and seized him by the
  horns.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7a"

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The struggle between Ursus and the aurochs.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Petronius, snatching the toga from the head of
  Vinicius. The latter rose and bent back his head; his face was as pale as
  linen, and he looked into the arena with a glassy, vacant stare.</p>

  <p>All breasts ceased to breathe. In the amphitheatre a fly might be heard on
  the wing. People could not believe their own eyes. Since Rome was Rome, no
  one had seen such a spectacle.</p>

  <p>The Lygian held the wild beast by the horns. The man&rsquo;s feet sank in
  the sand to his ankles, his back was bent like a drawn bow, his head was
  hidden between his shoulders, on his arms the muscles came out so that the
  skin almost burst from their pressure; but he had stopped the bull in his
  tracks. And the man and the beast remained so still that the spectators
  thought themselves looking at a picture showing a deed of Hercules or
  Theseus, or a group hewn from stone. But in that apparent repose there was a
  tremendous exertion of two struggling forces. The bull sank his feet as well
  as did the man in the sand, and his dark, shaggy body was curved so that it
  seemed a gigantic ball. Which of the two would fail first, which would fall
  first,&mdash;that was the question for those spectators enamoured of such
  struggles; a question which at that moment meant more for them than their own
  fate, than all Rome and its lordship over the world. That Lygian was in their
  eyes then a demigod worthy of honor and statues. Cæsar himself stood up as
  well as others. He and Tigellinus, hearing of the man&rsquo;s strength, had
  arranged this spectacle purposely, and said to each other with a jeer,
  &ldquo;Let that slayer of Croton kill the bull which we choose for
  him&rdquo;; so they looked now with amazement at that picture, as if not
  believing that it could be real.</p>

  <p>In the amphitheatre were men who had raised their arms and remained in
  that posture. Sweat covered the faces of others, as if they themselves were
  struggling with the beast. In the Circus nothing was heard save the sound of
  flame in the lamps, and the crackle of bits of coal as they dropped from the
  torches. Their voices died on the lips of the spectators, but their hearts
  were beating in their breasts as if to split them. It seemed to all that the
  struggle was lasting for ages. But the man and the beast continued on in
  their monstrous exertion; one might have said that they were planted in the
  earth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a dull roar resembling a groan was heard from the arena, after
  which a brief shout was wrested from every breast, and again there was
  silence. People thought themselves dreaming till the enormous head of the
  bull began to turn in the iron hands of the barbarian. The face, neck, and
  arms of the Lygian grew purple; his back bent still more. It was clear that
  he was rallying the remnant of his superhuman strength, but that he could not
  last long.</p>

  <p>Duller and duller, hoarser and hoarser, more and more painful grew the
  groan of the bull as it mingled with the whistling breath from the breast of
  the giant. The head of the beast turned more and more, and from his jaws
  crept forth a long, foaming tongue.</p>

  <p>A moment more, and to the ears of spectators sitting nearer came as it
  were the crack of breaking bones; then the beast rolled on the earth with his
  neck twisted in death.</p>

  <p>The giant removed in a twinkle the ropes from the horns of the bull and,
  raising the maiden, began to breathe hurriedly. His face became pale, his
  hair stuck together from sweat, his shoulders and arms seemed flooded with
  water. For a moment he stood as if only half conscious; then he raised his
  eyes and looked at the spectators.</p>

  <p>The amphitheatre had gone wild.</p>

  <p>The walls of the building were trembling from the roar of tens of
  thousands of people. Since the beginning of spectacles there was no memory of
  such excitement. Those who were sitting on the highest rows came down,
  crowding in the passages between benches to look more nearly at the strong
  man. Everywhere were heard cries for mercy, passionate and persistent, which
  soon turned into one unbroken thunder. That giant had become dear to those
  people enamoured of physical strength; he was the first personage in
  Rome.</p>

  <p>He understood that the multitude were striving to grant him his life and
  restore him his freedom, but clearly his thought was not on himself alone. He
  looked around a while; then approached Cæsar&rsquo;s podium, and, holding the
  body of the maiden on his outstretched arms, raised his eyes with entreaty,
  as if to say,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have mercy on her! Save the maiden. I did that for her
  sake!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The spectators understood perfectly what he wanted. At sight of the
  unconscious maiden, who near the enormous Lygian seemed a child, emotion
  seized the multitude of knights and senators. Her slender form, as white as
  if chiselled from alabaster, her fainting, the dreadful danger from which the
  giant had freed her, and finally her beauty and attachment had moved every
  heart. Some thought the man a father begging mercy for his child. Pity burst
  forth suddenly, like a flame. They had had blood, death, and torture in
  sufficiency. Voices choked with tears began to entreat mercy for both.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Ursus, holding the girl in his arms, moved around the arena, and
  with his eyes and with motions begged her life for her. Now Vinicius started
  up from his seat, sprang over the barrier which separated the front places
  from the arena, and, running to Lygia, covered her naked body with his
  toga.</p>

  <p>Then he tore apart the tunic on his breast, laid bare the scars left by
  wounds received in the Armenian war, and stretched out his hands to the
  audience.</p>

  <p>At this the enthusiasm of the multitude passed everything seen in a circus
  before. The crowd stamped and howled. Voices calling for mercy grew simply
  terrible. People not only took the part of the athlete, but rose in defense
  of the soldier, the maiden, their love. Thousands of spectators turned to
  Cæsar with flashes of anger in their eyes and with clinched fists.</p>

  <p>But Cæsar halted and hesitated. Against Vinicius he had no hatred indeed,
  and the death of Lygia did not concern him; but he preferred to see the body
  of the maiden rent by the horns of the bull or torn by the claws of beasts.
  His cruelty, his deformed imagination, and deformed desires found a kind of
  delight in such spectacles. And now the people wanted to rob him. Hence anger
  appeared on his bloated face. Self-love also would not let him yield to the
  wish of the multitude, and still he did not dare to oppose it, through his
  inborn cowardice.</p>

  <p>So he gazed around to see if among the Augustians at least, he could not
  find fingers turned down in sign of death. But Petronius held up his hand,
  and looked into Nero&rsquo;s face almost challengingly. Vestinius,
  superstitious but inclined to enthusiasm, a man who feared ghosts but not the
  living, gave a sign for mercy also. So did Scevinus, the Senator; so did
  Nerva, so did Tullius Senecio, so did the famous leader Ostorius Scapula, and
  Antistius, and Piso, and Vetus, and Crispinus, and Minucius Thermus, and
  Pontius Telesinus, and the most important of all, one honored by the people,
  Thrasea.</p>

  <p>In view of this, Cæsar took the emerald from his eye with an expression of
  contempt and offence; when Tigellinus, whose desire was to spite Petronius,
  turned to him and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yield not, divinity; we have the pretorians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Nero turned to the place where command over the pretorians was held
  by the stern Subrius Flavius, hitherto devoted with whole soul to him, and
  saw something unusual. The face of the old tribune was stern, but covered
  with tears, and he was holding his hand up in sign of mercy.</p>

  <p>Now rage began to possess the multitude. Dust rose from beneath the
  stamping feet, and filled the amphitheatre. In the midst of shouts were heard
  cries: &ldquo;Ahenobarbus! matricide! incendiary!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nero was alarmed. Romans were absolute lords in the Circus. Former Cæsars,
  and especially Caligula, had permitted themselves sometimes to act against
  the will of the people; this, however, called forth disturbance always, going
  sometimes to bloodshed. But Nero was in a different position. First, as a
  comedian and a singer he needed the people&rsquo;s favor; second, he wanted
  it on his side against the Senate and the patricians, and especially after
  the burning of Rome he strove by all means to win it, and turn their anger
  against the Christians. He understood, besides, that to oppose longer was
  simply dangerous. A disturbance begun in the Circus might seize the whole
  city, and have results incalculable.</p>

  <p>He looked once more at Subrius Flavius, at Scevinus the centurion, a
  relative of the senator, at the soldiers; and seeing everywhere frowning
  brows, excited faces, and eyes fixed on him, he gave the sign for mercy.</p>

  <p>Then a thunder of applause was heard from the highest seats to the lowest.
  The people were sure of the lives of the condemned, for from that moment they
  went under their protection, and even Cæsar would not have dared to pursue
  them any longer with his vengeance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch66"
     name="ch66">CHAPTER LXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Four Bithynians carried Lygia carefully to the house of
  Petronius. Vinicius and Ursus walked at her side, hurrying so as to give her
  into the hands of the Greek physician as quickly as possible. They walked in
  silence, for after the events of the day they had not power to speak.
  Vinicius so far was as if half conscious. He kept repeating to himself that
  Lygia was saved; that she was threatened no longer by imprisonment, or death
  in the Circus; that their misfortunes had ended once and forever; that he
  would take her home and not separate again from her. This appeared to him the
  beginning of some other life rather than reality. From moment to moment he
  bent over the open litter to look on the beloved face, which in the moonlight
  seemed sleeping, and he repeated mentally, &ldquo;This is she! Christ has
  saved her!&rdquo; He remembered also that while he and Ursus were carrying
  her from the spoliarium an unknown physician had assured him that she was
  living and would recover. At this thought delight so filled his breast that
  at moments he grew weak, and being unable to walk with his own strength
  leaned on the arm of Ursus. Ursus meanwhile was looking into the sky filled
  with stars, and was praying.</p>

  <p>They advanced hurriedly along streets where newly erected white buildings
  shone brightly in the moonlight. The city was empty, save here and there
  where crowds of people crowned with ivy, sang and danced before porticos to
  the sound of flutes, thus taking advantage of the wonderful night and the
  festive season, unbroken from the beginning of the games. Only when they were
  near the house did Ursus stop praying, and say in a low voice, as if he
  feared to waken Lygia,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, it was the Saviour who rescued her from death. When I saw her
  on the horns of the aurochs, I heard a voice in my soul saying, &rsquo;Defend
  her!&rsquo; and that was the voice of the Lamb. The prison took strength from
  me, but He gave it back in that moment, and inspired that cruel people to
  take her part. Let His will be done!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Vinicius answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Magnified be His name!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had not power to continue, for all at once he felt that a mighty
  weeping was swelling his breast. He was seized by an overpowering wish to
  throw himself on the earth and thank the Saviour for His miracles and His
  mercy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile they had come to the house; the servants, informed by a slave
  despatched in advance, crowded out to meet them. Paul of Tarsus had sent back
  from Antium the greater part of those people. The misfortune of Vinicius was
  known to them perfectly; therefore their delight at seeing those victims
  which had been snatched from the malice of Nero was immense, and increased
  still more when the physician Theocles declared that Lygia had not suffered
  serious injury, and that when the weakness caused by prison fever had passed,
  she would regain health.</p>

  <p>Consciousness returned to her that night. Waking in the splendid chamber
  lighted by Corinthian lamps, amidst the odor of verbena and nard, she knew
  not where she was, or what was taking place with her. She remembered the
  moment in which she had been lashed to the horns of the chained bull; and
  now, seeing above her the face of Vinicius, lighted by the mild rays of the
  lamp, she supposed herself no longer on earth. The thoughts were confused in
  her weakened head; it seemed to her natural to be detained somewhere on the
  way to heaven, because of her tortures and weakness. Feeling no pain,
  however, she smiled at Vinicius, and wanted to ask where they were; but from
  her lips came merely a low whisper in which he could barely detect his own
  name.</p>

  <p>Then he knelt near her, and, placing his hand on her forehead lightly, he
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christ saved thee, and returned thee to me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her lips moved again with a meaningless whisper; her lids closed after a
  moment, her breast rose with a light sigh, and she fell into a deep sleep,
  for which the physician had been waiting, and after which she would return to
  health, he said.</p>

  <p>Vinicius remained kneeling near her, however, sunk in prayer. His soul was
  melting with a love so immense that he forgot himself utterly. Theocles
  returned often to the chamber, and the golden-haired Eunice appeared behind
  the raised curtain a number of times; finally cranes, reared in the gardens,
  began to call, heralding the coming day, but Vinicius was still embracing in
  his mind the feet of Christ, neither seeing nor hearing what was passing
  around him, with a heart turned into a thanksgiving, sacrificial flame, sunk
  in ecstasy, and though alive, half seized into heaven.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch67"
     name="ch67">CHAPTER LXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Petronius, after the liberation of Lygia, not wishing to
  irritate Cæsar, went to the Palatine with other Augustians. He wanted to hear
  what they were saying, and especially to learn if Tigellinus was devising
  something new to destroy Lygia. Both she and Ursus had passed under the
  protection of the people, it is true, and no one could place a hand on them
  without raising a riot; still Petronius, knowing the hatred toward him of the
  all-powerful pretorian prefect, considered that very likely Tigellinus, while
  unable to strike him directly, would strive to find some means of revenge
  against his nephew.</p>

  <p>Nero was angry and irritated, since the spectacle had ended quite
  differently from what he had planned. At first he did not wish even to look
  at Petronius; but the latter, without losing cool blood, approached him, with
  all the freedom of the &ldquo;arbiter elegantiarum,&rdquo; and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou know, divinity, what occurs to me? Write a poem on the
  maiden who, at command of the lord of the world, was freed from the horns of
  the wild bull and given to her lover. The Greeks are sensitive, and I am sure
  that the poem will enchant them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This thought pleased Nero in spite of all his irritation, and it pleased
  him doubly, first, as a subject for a poem, and second, because in it he
  could glorify himself as the magnanimous lord of the earth; hence he looked
  for a time at Petronius, and then said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! perhaps thou art right. But does it become me to celebrate my
  own goodness?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no need to give names. In Rome all will know who is meant,
  and from Rome reports go through the whole world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But art thou sure that this will please the people in
  Achæa?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Poilux, it will!&rdquo; said Petronius.</p>

  <p>And he went away satisfied, for he felt certain that Nero, whose whole
  life was an arrangement of reality to literary plans, would not spoil the
  subject, and by this alone he would tie the hands of Tigellinus. This,
  however, did not change his plan of sending Vinicius out of Rome as soon as
  Lygia&rsquo;s health should permit. So when he saw him next day, he
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take her to Sicily. As things have happened, on Cæsar&rsquo;s part
  thou art threatened by nothing; but Tigellinus is ready to use even
  poison,&mdash;if not out of hatred to you both, out of hatred to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vinicius smiled at him, and said: &ldquo;She was on the horns of the wild
  bull; still Christ saved her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then honor Him with a hecatomb,&rdquo; replied Petronius, with an
  accent of impatience, &ldquo;but do not beg Him to save her a second time.
  Dost remember how Eolus received Ulysses when he returned to ask a second
  time for favoring winds? Deities do not like to repeat themselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When her health returns, I will take her to Pomponia
  Græcina,&rdquo; said Vinicius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thou wilt do that all the better since Pomponia is ill;
  Antistius, a relative of Aulus, told me so. Meanwhile things will happen here
  to make people forget thee, and in these times the forgotten are the
  happiest. May Fortune be thy sun in winter, and thy shade in
  summer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he left Vinicius to his happiness, but went himself to inquire of
  Theocles touching the life and health of Lygia.</p>

  <p>Danger threatened her no longer. Emaciated as she was in the dungeon after
  prison fever, foul air and discomfort would have killed her; but now she had
  the most tender care, and not only plenty, but luxury. At command of Theocles
  they took her to the gardens of the villa after two days; in these gardens
  she remained for hours. Vinicius decked her litter with anemones, and
  especially with irises, to remind her of the atrium of the house of Aulus.
  More than once, hidden in the shade of spreading trees, they spoke of past
  sufferings and fears, each holding the other&rsquo;s hand. Lygia said that
  Christ had conducted him through suffering purposely to change his soul and
  raise it to Himself. Vinicius felt that this was true, and that there was in
  him nothing of the former patrician, who knew no law but his own desire. In
  those memories there was nothing bitter, however. It seemed to both that
  whole years had gone over their heads, and that the dreadful past lay far
  behind. At the same time such a calmness possessed them as they had never
  known before. A new life of immense happiness had come and taken them into
  itself. In Rome Cæsar might rage and fill the world with terror&mdash;they
  felt above them a guardianship a hundred times mightier than his power, and
  had no further fear of his rage or his malice, just as if for them he had
  ceased to be the lord of life or death. Once, about sunset, the roar of lions
  and other beasts reached them from distant vivaria. Formerly those sounds
  filled Vinicius with fear because they were ominous; now he and Lygia merely
  looked at each other and raised their eyes to the evening twilight. At times
  Lygia, still very weak and unable to walk alone, fell asleep in the quiet of
  the garden; he watched over her, and, looking at her sleeping face, thought
  involuntarily that she was not that Lygia whom he had met at the house of
  Aulus. In fact, imprisonment and disease had to some extent quenched her
  beauty. When he saw her at the house of Aulus, and later, when he went to
  Miriam&rsquo;s house to seize her, she was as wonderful as a statue and also
  as a flower; now her face had become almost transparent, her hands thin, her
  body reduced by disease, her lips pale, and even her eyes seemed less blue
  than formerly. The golden-haired Eunice who brought her flowers and rich
  stuffs to cover her feet was a divinity of Cyprus in comparison. Petronius
  tried in vain to find the former charms in her, and, shrugging his shoulders,
  thought that that shadow from Elysian fields was not worth those struggles,
  those pains, and those tortures which had almost sucked the life out of
  Vinicius. But Vinicius, in love now with her spirit, loved it all the more;
  and when he was watching over her while asleep, it seemed to him that he was
  watching over the whole world.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch68"
     name="ch68">CHAPTER LXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">News of the miraculous rescue of Lygia was circulated
  quickly among those scattered Christians who had escaped destruction.
  Confessors came to look at her to whom Christ&rsquo;s favor had been shown
  clearly. First came Nazarius and Miriam, with whom Peter the Apostle was
  hiding thus far; after them came others. All, as well as Vinicius, Lygia, and
  the Christian slaves of Petronius, listened with attention to the narrative
  of Ursus about the voice which he had heard in his soul, and which commanded
  him to struggle with the wild bull. All went away consoled, hoping that
  Christ would not let His followers be exterminated on earth before His coming
  at the day of judgment. And hope sustained their hearts, for persecution had
  not ceased yet. Whoever was declared a Christian by public report was thrown
  into prison at once by the city watches. It is true that the victims were
  fewer, for the majority of confessors had been seized and tortured to death.
  The Christians who remained had either left Rome to wait out the storm in
  distant provinces, or had hidden most carefully, not daring to assemble in
  common prayer, unless in sand-pits outside the city. They were persecuted
  yet, however, and though the games were at an end, the newly arrested were
  reserved for future games or punished specially. Though it was believed in
  Rome no longer that Christians had caused the conflagration, they were
  declared enemies of humanity and the State, and the edict against them
  remained in former force.</p>

  <p>The Apostle Peter did not venture for a long time to appear in the house
  of Petronius, but at last on a certain evening Nazarius announced his
  arrival. Lygia, who was able to walk alone now, and Vinicius ran out to meet
  him, and fell to embracing his feet. He greeted them with emotion all the
  greater that not many sheep in that flock over which Christ had given him
  authority, and over the fate of which his great heart was weeping, remained
  to him. So when Vinicius said, &ldquo;Lord, because of thee the Redeemer
  returned her to me,&rdquo; he answered: &ldquo;He returned her because of thy
  faith, and so that not all the lips which profess His name should grow
  silent.&rdquo; And evidently he was thinking then of those thousands of his
  children torn by wild beasts, of those crosses with which the arena had been
  filled, and those fiery pillars in the gardens of the &ldquo;Beast&rdquo;;
  for he spoke with great sadness. Vinicius and Lygia noticed also that his
  hair had grown entirely white, that his whole form was bent, and that in his
  face there was as much sadness and suffering as if he had passed through all
  those pains and torments which the victims of Nero&rsquo;s rage and madness
  had endured. But both understood that since Christ had given Himself to
  torture and to death, no one was permitted to avoid it. Still their hearts
  were cut at sight of the Apostle, bent by years, toil, and pain. So Vinicius,
  who intended to take Lygia soon to Naples, where they would meet Pomponia and
  go to Sicily, implored him to leave Rome in their company.</p>

  <p>But the Apostle placed his hand on the tribune&rsquo;s head and
  answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In my soul I hear these words of the Lord, which He spoke to me on
  the Lake of Tiberias: &rsquo;When thou wert young, thou didst gird thyself,
  and walk whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch
  forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou
  wouldst not.&rsquo; Therefore it is proper that I follow my flock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And when they were silent, not knowing the sense of his speech, he
  added,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My toil is nearing its end; I shall find entertainment and rest
  only in the house of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he turned to them saying: &ldquo;Remember me, for I have loved you as
  a father loves his children; and whatever ye do in life, do it for the glory
  of God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he raised his aged, trembling hands and blessed them; they
  nestled up to him, feeling that to be the last blessing, perhaps, which they
  should receive from him.</p>

  <p>It was destined them, however, to see him once more. A few days later
  Petronius brought terrible news from the Palatine. It had been discovered
  there that one of Cæsar&rsquo;s freedmen was a Christian; and on this man
  were found letters of the Apostles Peter and Paul, with letters of James,
  John, and Judas. Peter&rsquo;s presence in Rome was known formerly to
  Tigellinus, but he thought that the Apostle had perished with thousands of
  other confessors. Now it transpired that the two leaders of the new faith
  were alive and in the capital. It was determined, therefore, to seize them at
  all costs, for it was hoped that with their death the last root of the hated
  sect would be plucked out. Petronius heard from Vestinius that Cæsar himself
  had issued an order to put Peter and Paul in the Mamertine prison within
  three days, and that whole detachments of pretorians had been sent to search
  every house in the Trans-Tiber.</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Vinicius resolved to warn the Apostle. In the evening
  he and Ursus put on Gallic mantles and went to the house of Miriam, where
  Peter was living. The house was at the very edge of the Trans-Tiber division
  of the city, at the foot of the Janiculum. On the road they saw houses
  surrounded by soldiers, who were guided by certain unknown persons. This
  division of the city was alarmed, and in places crowds of curious people had
  assembled. Here and there centurions interrogated prisoners touching Simon
  Peter and Paul of Tarsus.</p>

  <p>Ursus and Vinicius were in advance of the soldiers, and went safely to
  Miriam&rsquo;s house, in which they found Peter surrounded by a handful of
  the faithful. Timothy, Paul&rsquo;s assistant, and Linus were at the side of
  the Apostle.</p>

  <p>At news of the approaching danger, Nazarius led all by a hidden passage to
  the garden gate, and then to deserted stone quarries, a few hundred yards
  distant from the Janiculum Gate. Ursus had to carry Linus, whose bones,
  broken by torture, had not grown together yet. But once in the quarry, they
  felt safe; and by the light of a torch ignited by Nazarius they began to
  consult, in a low voice, how to save the life of the Apostle who was so dear
  to them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Vinicius, &ldquo;let Nazarius guide thee at
  daybreak to the Alban Hills. There I will find thee, and we will take thee to
  Antium, where a ship is ready to take us to Naples and Sicily. Blessed will
  the day and the hour be in which thou shalt enter my house, and thou wilt
  bless my hearth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The others heard this with delight, and pressed the Apostle, saying,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hide thyself, sacred leader; remain not in Rome. Preserve the
  living truth, so that it perish not with us and thee. Hear us, who entreat
  thee as a father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do this in Christ&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; cried others, grasping at
  his robes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; answered Peter, &ldquo;who knows the time when
  the Lord will mark the end of his life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he did not say that he would not leave Rome, and he hesitated what to
  do; for uncertainty, and even fear, had been creeping into his soul for some
  time. His flock was scattered; the work was wrecked; that church, which
  before the burning of the city had been flourishing like a splendid tree, was
  turned into dust by the power of the &ldquo;Beast.&rdquo; Nothing remained
  save tears, nothing save memories of torture and death. The sowing had
  yielded rich fruit, but Satan had trampled it into the earth. Legions of
  angels had not come to aid the perishing,&mdash;and Nero was extending in
  glory over the earth, terrible, mightier than ever, the lord of all seas and
  all lands. More than once had that fisherman of the Lord stretched his hands
  heavenward in loneliness and asked: &ldquo;Lord, what must I do? How must I
  act? And how am I, a feeble old man, to fight with this invincible power of
  Evil, which Thou hart permitted to rule, and have victory?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he called out thus in the depth of his immense pain, repeating in
  spirit: &ldquo;Those sheep which Thou didst command me to feed are no more,
  Thy church is no more; loneliness and mourning are in Thy capital; what dost
  Thou command me to do now? Am I to stay here, or lead forth the remnant of
  the flock to glorify Thy name in secret somewhere beyond the sea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he hesitated, He believed that the living truth would not perish, that
  it must conquer; but at moments he thought that the hour had not come yet,
  that it would come only when the Lord should descend to the earth in the day
  of judgment in glory and power a hundred times greater than the might of
  Nero.</p>

  <p>Frequently it seemed to him that if he left Rome, the faithful would
  follow; that he would lead them then far away to the shady groves of Galilee,
  to the quiet surface of the Lake of Tiberias, to shepherds as peaceful as
  doves, or as sheep, who feed there among thyme and pepperwort. And an
  increasing desire for peace and rest, an increasing yearning for the lake and
  Galilee, seized the heart of the fisherman; tears came more frequently to the
  old man&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  <p>But at the moment when he made the choice, sudden alarm and fear came on
  him. How was he to leave that city, in which so much martyrs&rsquo; blood had
  sunk into the earth, and where so many lips had given the true testimony of
  the dying? Was he alone to yield? And what would he answer the Lord on
  hearing the words, &ldquo;These have died for the faith, but thou didst
  flee&rdquo;?</p>

  <p>Nights and days passed for him in anxiety and suffering. Others, who had
  been torn by lions, who had been fastened to crosses, who had been burnt in
  the gardens of Cæsar, had fallen asleep in the Lord after moments of torture;
  but he could not sleep, and he felt greater tortures than any of those
  invented by executioners for victims. Often was the dawn whitening the roofs
  of houses while he was still crying from the depth of his mourning heart:
  &ldquo;Lord, why didst Thou command me to come hither and found Thy capital
  in the den of the &rsquo;Beast&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For thirty-three years after the death of his Master he knew no rest.
  Staff in hand, he had gone through the world and declared the &ldquo;good
  tidings.&rdquo; His strength had been exhausted in journeys and toil, till at
  last, when in that city, which was the head of the world, he had established
  the work of his Master, one bloody breath of wrath had burned it, and he saw
  that there was need to take up the struggle anew. And what a struggle! On one
  side Cæsar, the Senate, the people, the legions holding the world with a
  circle of iron, countless cities, countless lands,&mdash;power such as the
  eye of man had not seen; on the other side he, so bent with age and toil that
  his trembling hand was hardly able to carry his staff.</p>

  <p>At times, therefore, he said to himself that it was not for him to measure
  with the Cæsar of Rome,&mdash;that Christ alone could do that.</p>

  <p>All these thoughts were passing through his care-filled head, when he
  heard the prayers of the last handful of the faithful. They, surrounding him
  in an ever narrowing circle, repeated with voices of entreaty,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hide thyself, Rabbi, and lead us away from the power of the
  &lsquo;Beast.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Finally Linus also bowed his tortured head before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Redeemer commanded thee to feed
  His sheep, but they are here no longer or to-morrow they will not be here;
  go, therefore, where thou mayst find them yet. The word of God is living
  still in Jerusalem, in Antioch, in Ephesus, and in other cities. What wilt
  thou do by remaining in Rome? If thou fall, thou wilt merely swell the
  triumph of the &lsquo;Beast.&rsquo; The Lord has not designated the limit of
  John&rsquo;s life; Paul is a Roman citizen, they cannot condemn him without
  trial; but if the power of hell rise up against thee, O teacher, those whose
  hearts are dejected will ask, &lsquo;Who is above Nero?&rsquo; Thou art the
  rock on which the church of God is founded. Let us die, but permit not the
  victory of Antichrist over the viceregent of God, and return not hither till
  the Lord has crushed him who shed innocent blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at our tears!&rdquo; repeated all who were present.</p>

  <p>Tears flowed over Peter&rsquo;s face too. After a while he rose, and,
  stretching his hands over the kneeling figures, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May the name of the Lord be magnified, and may His will be
  done!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch69"
     name="ch69">CHAPTER LXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">About dawn of the following day two dark figures were moving
  along the Appian Way toward the Campania.</p>

  <p>One of them was Nazarius; the other the Apostle Peter, who was leaving
  Rome and his martyred co-religionists.</p>

  <p>The sky in the east was assuming a light tinge of green, bordered
  gradually and more distinctly on the lower edge with saffron color. Silver-
  leafed trees, the white marble of villas, and the arches of aqueducts,
  stretching through the plain toward the city, were emerging from shade. The
  greenness of the sky was clearing gradually, and becoming permeated with
  gold. Then the east began to grow rosy and illuminate the Alban Hills, which
  seemed marvellously beautiful, lily-colored, as if formed of rays of light
  alone.</p>

  <p>The light was reflected in trembling leaves of trees, in the dew-drops.
  The haze grew thinner, opening wider and wider views on the plain, on the
  houses dotting it, on the cemeteries, on the towns, and on groups of trees,
  among which stood white columns of temples.</p>

  <p>The road was empty. The villagers who took vegetables to the city had not
  succeeded yet, evidently, in harnessing beasts to their vehicles. From the
  stone blocks with which the road was paved as far as the mountains, there
  came a low sound from the bark shoes on the feet of the two travellers.</p>

  <p>Then the sun appeared over the line of hills; but at once a wonderful
  vision struck the Apostle&rsquo;s eyes. It seemed to him that the golden
  circle, instead of rising in the sky, moved down from the heights and was
  advancing on the road. Peter stopped, and asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seest thou that brightness approaching us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see nothing,&rdquo; replied Nazarius.</p>

  <p>But Peter shaded his eyes with his hand, and said after a while,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some figure is coming in the gleam of the sun.&rdquo; But not the
  slightest sound of steps reached their ears. It was perfectly still all
  around. Nazarius saw only that the trees were quivering in the distance, as
  if some one were shaking them, and the light was spreading more broadly over
  the plain. He looked with wonder at the Apostle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rabbi! what ails thee?&rdquo; cried he, with alarm.</p>

  <p>The pilgrim&rsquo;s staff fell from Peter&rsquo;s hands to the earth; his
  eyes were looking forward, motionless; his mouth was open; on his face were
  depicted astonishment, delight, rapture.</p>

  <p>Then he threw himself on his knees, his arms stretched forward; and this
  cry left his lips,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Christ! O Christ!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He fell with his face to the earth, as if kissing some one&rsquo;s
  feet.</p>

  <p>The silence continued long; then were heard the words of the aged man,
  broken by sobs,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quo vadis, Domine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nazarius did not hear the answer; but to Peter&rsquo;s ears came a sad and
  sweet voice, which said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thou desert my people, I am going to Rome to be crucified a
  second time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Apostle lay on the ground, his face in the dust, without motion or
  speech. It seemed to Nazarius that he had fainted or was dead; but he rose at
  last, seized the staff with trembling hands, and turned without a word toward
  the seven hills of the city.</p>

  <p>The boy, seeing this, repeated as an echo,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quo vadis, Domine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Rome,&rdquo; said the Apostle, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>And he returned.</p>

  <p>Paul, John, Linus, and all the faithful received him with amazement; and
  the alarm was the greater, since at daybreak, just after his departure,
  pretorians had surrounded Miriam&rsquo;s house and searched it for the
  Apostle. But to every question he answered only with delight and
  peace,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seen the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And that same evening he went to the Ostian cemetery to teach and baptize
  those who wished to bathe in the water of life.</p>

  <p>And thenceforward he went there daily, and after him went increasing
  numbers. It seemed that out of every tear of a martyr new confessors were
  born, and that every groan on the arena found an echo in thousands of
  breasts. Cæsar was swimming in blood, Rome and the whole pagan world was mad.
  But those who had had enough of transgression and madness, those who were
  trampled upon, those whose lives were misery and oppression, all the weighed
  down, all the sad, all the unfortunate, came to hear the wonderful tidings of
  God, who out of love for men had given Himself to be crucified and redeem
  their sins.</p>

  <p>When they found a God whom they could love, they had found that which the
  society of the time could not give any one,&mdash;happiness and love.</p>

  <p>And Peter understood that neither Cæsar nor all his legions could overcome
  the living truth,&mdash;that they could not overwhelm it with tears or blood,
  and that now its victory was beginning. He understood with equal force why
  the Lord had turned him back on the road. That city of pride, crime,
  wickedness, and power was beginning to be His city, and the double capital,
  from which would flow out upon the world government of souls and bodies.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch70"
     name="ch70">CHAPTER LXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At last the hour was accomplished for both Apostles. But, as
  if to complete his service, it was given to the fisherman of the Lord to win
  two souls even in confinement. The soldiers, Processus and Martinianus, who
  guarded him in the Mamertine prison, received baptism. Then came the hour of
  torture. Nero was not in Rome at that time. Sentence was passed by Helius and
  Polythetes, two freedmen to whom Cæsar had confided the government of Rome
  during his absence.</p>

  <p>On the aged Apostle had been inflicted the stripes prescribed by law; and
  next day he was led forth beyond the walls of the city, toward the Vatican
  Hill, where he was to suffer the punishment of the cross assigned to him.
  Soldiers were astonished by the crowd which had gathered before the prison,
  for in their minds the death of a common man, and besides a foreigner, should
  not rouse such interest; they did not understand that that retinue was
  composed not of sightseers, but confessors, anxious to escort the great
  Apostle to the place of execution. In the afternoon the gates of the prison
  were thrown open at last, and Peter appeared in the midst of a detachment of
  pretorians. The sun had inclined somewhat toward Ostia already; the day was
  clear and calm. Because of his advanced age, Peter was not required to carry
  the cross; it was supposed that he could not carry it; they had not put the
  fork on his neck, either, so as not to retard his pace. He walked without
  hindrance, and the faithful could see him perfectly.</p>

  <p>At moments when his white head showed itself among the iron helmets of the
  soldiers, weeping was heard in the crowd; but it was restrained immediately,
  for the face of the old man had in it so much calmness, and was so bright
  with joy, that all understood him to be not a victim going to destruction,
  but a victor celebrating his triumph.</p>

  <p>And thus it was really. The fisherman, usually humble and stooping, walked
  now erect, taller than the soldiers, full of dignity. Never had men seen such
  majesty in his bearing. It might have seemed that he was a monarch attended
  by people and military. From every side voices were raised,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is Peter going to the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All forgot, as it were, that torture and death were waiting for him. He
  walked with solemn attention, but with calmness, feeling that since the death
  on Golgotha nothing equally important had happened, and that as the first
  death had redeemed the whole world, this was to redeem the city.</p>

  <p>Along the road people halted from wonder at sight of that old man; but
  believers, laying hands on their shoulders, said with calm voices,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See how a just man goes to death,&mdash;one who knew Christ and
  proclaimed love to the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These became thoughtful, and walked away, saying to themselves, &ldquo;He
  cannot, indeed, be unjust!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Along the road noise was hushed, and the cries of the street. The retinue
  moved on before houses newly reared, before white columns of temples, over
  whose summits hung the deep sky, calm and blue. They went in quiet; only at
  times the weapons of the soldiers clattered, or the murmur of prayer rose.
  Peter heard the last, and his face grew bright with increasing joy, for his
  glance could hardly take in those thousands of confessors. He felt that he
  had done his work, and he knew now that that truth which he had been
  declaring all his life would overwhelm everything, like a sea, and that
  nothing would have power to restrain it. And thus thinking, he raised his
  eyes, and said: &ldquo;O Lord, Thou didst command me to conquer this
  world-ruling city; hence I have conquered it. Thou hast commanded me to found
  here Thy capital; hence I have founded it. This is Thy city now, O Lord, and
  I go to Thee, for I have toiled greatly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he passed before temples, he said to them, &ldquo;Ye will be temples of
  Christ.&rdquo; Looking at throngs of people moving before his eyes, he said
  to them, &ldquo;Your children will be servants of Christ&rdquo;; and he
  advanced with the feeling that he had conquered, conscious of his service,
  conscious of his strength, solaced,&mdash;great. The soldiers conducted him
  over the Pons Triumphalis, as if giving involuntary testimony to his triumph,
  and they led him farther toward the Naumachia and the Circus. The faithful
  from beyond the Tiber joined the procession; and such a throng of people was
  formed that the centurion commanding the pretonians understood at last that
  he was leading a high-priest surrounded by believers, and grew alarmed
  because of the small number of soldiers. But no cry of indignation or rage
  was given out in the throng. Men&rsquo;s faces were penetrated with the
  greatness of the moment, solemn and full of expectation. Some believers,
  remembering that when the Lord died the earth opened from fright and the dead
  rose from their graves, thought that now some evident signs would appear,
  after which the death of the Apostle would not be forgotten for ages. Others
  said to themselves, &ldquo;Perhaps the Lord will select the hour of
  Peter&rsquo;s death to come from heaven as He promised, and judge the
  world.&rdquo; With this idea they recommended themselves to the mercy of the
  Redeemer.</p>

  <p>But round about there was calm. The hills seemed to be warming themselves,
  and resting in the sun. The procession stopped at last between the Circus and
  the Vatican Hill. Soldiers began now to dig a hole; others placed on the
  ground the cross, hammers, and nails, waiting till all preparations were
  finished. The crowd, continuing quiet and attentive, knelt round about.</p>

  <p>The Apostle, with his head in the sun-rays and golden light, turned for
  the last time toward the city. At a distance lower down was seen the gleaming
  Tiber; beyond was the Campus Martius; higher up, the Mausoleum of Augustus;
  below that, the gigantic baths just begun by Nero; still lower,
  Pompey&rsquo;s theatre; and beyond them were visible in places, and in places
  hidden by other buildings, the Septa Julia, a multitude of porticos, temples,
  columns, great edifices; and, finally, far in the distance, hills covered
  with houses, a gigantic resort of people, the borders of which vanished in
  the blue haze,&mdash;an abode of crime, but of power; of madness, but of
  order,&mdash;which had become the head of the world, its oppressor, but its
  law and its peace, almighty, invincible, eternal.</p>

  <p>But Peter, surrounded by soldiers, looked at the city as a ruler and king
  looks at his inheritance. And he said to it, &ldquo;Thou art redeemed and
  mine!&rdquo; And no one, not merely among the soldiers digging the hole in
  which to plant the cross, but even among believers, could divine that
  standing there among them was the true ruler of that moving life; that Cæsars
  would pass away, waves of barbarians go by, and ages vanish, but that old man
  would be lord there unbrokenly.</p>

  <p>The sun had sunk still more toward Ostia, and had become large and red.
  The whole western side of the sky had begun to glow with immense brightness.
  The soldiers approached Peter to strip him.</p>

  <p>But he, while praying, straightened himself all at once, and stretched his
  right hand high. The executioners stopped, as if made timid by his posture;
  the faithful held the breath in their breasts, thinking that he wished to say
  something, and silence unbroken followed.</p>

  <p>But he, standing on the height, with his extended right hand made the sign
  of the cross, blessing in the hour of death,&mdash;</p>

  <p>Urbi et orbi! (the city and the world).</p>

  <p>In that same wonderful evening another detachment of soldiers conducted
  along the Ostian Way Paul of Tarsus toward a place called Aquæ Salviæ. And
  behind him also advanced a crowd of the faithful whom he had converted; but
  when he recognized near acquaintances, he halted and conversed with them,
  for, being a Roman citizen, the guard showed more respect to him. Beyond the
  gate called Tergemina he met Plautilla, the daughter of the prefect Flavius
  Sabinus, and, seeing her youthful face covered with tears, he said:
  &ldquo;Plautilla, daughter of Eternal Salvation, depart in peace. Only give
  me a veil with which to bind my eyes when I am going to the Lord.&rdquo; And
  taking it, he advanced with a face as full of delight as that of a laborer
  who when he has toiled the whole day successfully is returning home. His
  thoughts, like those of Peter, were as calm and quiet as that evening sky.
  His eyes gazed with thoughtfulness upon the plain which stretched out before
  him, and to the Alban Hills, immersed in light. He remembered his journeys,
  his toils, his labor, the struggles in which he had conquered, the churches
  which he had founded in all lands and beyond all seas; and he thought that he
  had earned his rest honestly, that he had finished his work. He felt now that
  the seed which he had planted would not be blown away by the wind of malice.
  He was leaving this life with the certainty that in the battle which his
  truth had declared against the world it would conquer; and a mighty peace
  settled down on his soul.</p>

  <p>The road to the place of execution was long, and evening was coming. The
  mountains became purple, and the bases of them went gradually into the shade.
  Flocks were returning home. Here and there groups of slaves were walking with
  the tools of labor on their shoulders. Children, playing on the road before
  houses, looked with curiosity at the passing soldiers. But in that evening,
  in that transparent golden air, there were not only peace and lovingness, but
  a certain harmony, which seemed to lift from earth to heaven. Paul felt this;
  and his heart was filled with delight at the thought that to that harmony of
  the world he had added one note which had not been in it hitherto, but
  without which the whole earth was like sounding brass or a tinkling
  cymbal.</p>

  <p>He remembered how he had taught people love,&mdash;how he had told them
  that though they were to give their property to the poor, though they knew
  all languages, all secrets, and all sciences, they would be nothing without
  love, which is kind, enduring, which does not return evil, which does not
  desire honor, suffers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, is
  patient of all things.</p>

  <p>And so his life had passed in teaching people this truth. And now he said
  in spirit: What power can equal it, what can conquer it? Could Cæsar stop it,
  though he had twice as many legions and twice as many cities, seas, lands,
  and nations?</p>

  <p>And he went to his reward like a conqueror.</p>

  <p>The detachment left the main road at last, and turned toward the east on a
  narrow path leading to the Aquæ Salviæ. The red sun was lying now on the
  heather. The centurion stopped the soldiers at the fountain, for the moment
  had come.</p>

  <p>Paul placed Plautilla&rsquo;s veil on his arm, intending to bind his eyes
  with it; for the last time he raised those eyes, full of unspeakable peace,
  toward the eternal light of the evening, and prayed. Yes, the moment had
  come; but he saw before him a great road in the light, leading to heaven; and
  in his soul he repeated the same words which formerly he had written in the
  feeling of his own finished service and his near end,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
  the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
  righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch71"
     name="ch71">CHAPTER LXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rome had gone mad for a long time, so that the world-
  conquering city seemed ready at last to tear itself to pieces for want of
  leadership. Even before the last hour of the Apostles had struck,
  Piso&rsquo;s conspiracy appeared; and then such merciless reaping of
  Rome&rsquo;s highest heads, that even to those who saw divinity in Nero, he
  seemed at last a divinity of death. Mourning fell on the city, terror took
  its lodgment in houses and in hearts, but porticos were crowned with ivy and
  flowers, for it was not permitted to show sorrow for the dead. People waking
  in the morning asked themselves whose turn would come next. The retinue of
  ghosts following Cæsar increased every day.</p>

  <p>Piso paid for the conspiracy with his head; after him followed Seneca, and
  Lucan, Fenius Rufus, and Plautius Lateranus, and Flavius Scevinus, and
  Afranius Quinetianus, and the dissolute companion of Cæsar&rsquo;s madnesses,
  Tullius Senecio, and Proculus, and Araricus, and Tugurinus, and Gratus, and
  Silanus, and Proximus,&mdash;once devoted with his whole soul to
  Nero,&mdash;and Sulpicius Asper. Some were destroyed by their own
  insignificance, some by fear, some by wealth, others by bravery. Cæsar,
  astonished at the very number of the conspirators, covered the walls with
  soldiery and held the city as if by siege, sending out daily centurions with
  sentences of death to suspected houses. The condemned humiliated themselves
  in letters filled with flattery, thanking Cæsar for his sentences, and
  leaving him a part of their property, so as to save the rest for their
  children. It seemed, at last, that Nero was exceeding every measure on
  purpose to convince himself of the degree in which men had grown abject, and
  how long they would endure bloody rule. After the conspirators, their
  relatives were executed; then their friends, and even simple acquaintances.
  Dwellers in lordly mansions built after the fire, when they went out on the
  street, felt sure of seeing a whole row of funerals. Pompeius, Cornelius,
  Martialis, Flavius Nepos, and Statius Domitius died because accused of lack
  of love for Cæsar; Novius Priscus, as a friend of Seneca. Rufius Crispus was
  deprived of the right of fire and water because on a time he had been the
  husband of Poppæa. The great Thrasea was ruined by his virtue; many paid with
  their lives for noble origin; even Poppæa fell a victim to the momentary rage
  of Nero.</p>

  <p>The Senate crouched before the dreadful ruler; it raised a temple in his
  honor, made an offering in favor of his voice, crowned his statues, appointed
  priests to him as to a divinity. Senators, trembling in their souls, went to
  the Palatine to magnify the song of the &ldquo;Periodonices,&rdquo; and go
  wild with him amid orgies of naked bodies, wine, and flowers.</p>

  <p>But meanwhile from below, in the field soaked in blood and tears, rose the
  sowing of Peter, stronger and stronger every moment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch72"
     name="ch72">CHAPTER LXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Vinicius</i> to <i>Petronius</i>:</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;We know, carissime, most of what is happening in
Rome, and what we
  do not know is told us in thy letters. When one casts a stone in the water,
  the wave goes farther and farther in a circle; so the wave of madness and
  malice has come from the Palatine to us. On the road to Greece, Carinas was
  sent hither by Cæsar, who plundered cities and temples to fill the empty
  treasury. At the price of the sweat and tears of people, he is building the
  &lsquo;golden house&rsquo; in Rome. It is possible that the world has not
  seen such a house, but it has not seen such injustice. Thou knowest Carinas.
  Chilo was like him till he redeemed his life with death. But to the towns
  lying nearer us his men have not come yet, perhaps because there are no
  temples or treasures in them. Thou askest if we are out of danger. I answer
  that we are out of mind, and let that suffice for an answer. At this moment,
  from the portico under which I write, I see our calm bay, and on it Ursus in
  a boat, letting down a net in the clear water. My wife is spinning red wool
  near me, and in the gardens, under the shade of almond-trees, our slaves are
  singing. Oh, what calm carissime, and what a forgetfulness of former fear and
  suffering! But it is not the Parcæ as thou writest, who spin out our lives so
  agreeably; it is Christ who is blessing us, our beloved God and Saviour. We
  know tears and sorrow, for our religion teaches us to weep over the
  misfortunes of others; but in these tears is a consolation unknown to thee;
  for whenever the time of our life is ended, we shall find all those dear ones
  who perished and who are perishing yet for God&rsquo;s truth. For us Peter
  and Paul are not dead; they are merely born into glory. Our souls see them,
  and when our eyes weep our hearts are glad with their joy. Oh, yes, my dear
  friend, we are happy with a happiness which nothing can destroy, since death,
  which for thee is the end of everything, is for us only a passage into
  superior rest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And so days and months pass here in calmness of heart. Our servants
  and slaves believe, as we do, in Christ, and that He enjoins love; hence we
  love one another. Frequently, when the sun has gone down, or when the moon is
  shining in the water, Lygia and I talk of past times, which seem a dream to
  us; but when I think how that dear head was near torture and death, I magnify
  my Lord with my whole soul, for out of those hands He alone could wrest her,
  save her from the arena, and return her to me forever. O Petronius, thou hast
  seen what endurance and comfort that religion gives in misfortune, how much
  patience and courage before death; so come and see how much happiness it
  gives in ordinary, common days of life. People thus far did not know a God
  whom man could love, hence they did not love one another; and from that came
  their misfortune, for as light comes from the sun, so does happiness come
  from love. Neither lawgivers nor philosophers taught this truth, and it did
  not exist in Greece or Rome; and when I say, not in Rome, that means the
  whole world. The dry and cold teaching of the Stoics, to which virtuous
  people rally, tempers the heart as a sword is tempered, but it makes it
  indifferent rather than better. Though why do I write this to thee, who hast
  learned more, and hast more understanding than I have? Thou wert acquainted
  with Paul of Tarsus, and more than once didst converse long with him; hence
  thou knowest better if in comparison with the truth which he taught all the
  teachings of philosophers and rhetors are not a vain and empty jingle of
  words without meaning. Thou rememberest the question which he put thee:
  &rsquo;But if Cæsar were a Christian, would ye not all feel safer, surer of
  possessing that which ye possess, free of alarm, and sure of
  to-morrow?&rsquo; Thou didst say to me that our teaching was an enemy of
  life; and I answer thee now, that, if from the beginning of this letter I had
  been repeating only the three words, &lsquo;I am happy!&rsquo; I could not
  have expressed my happiness to thee. To this thou wilt answer, that my
  happiness is Lygia. True, my friend. Because I love her immortal soul, and
  because we both love each other in Christ; for such love there is no
  separation, no deceit, no change, no old age, no death. For, when youth and
  beauty pass, when our bodies wither and death comes, love will remain, for
  the spirit remains. Before my eyes were open to the light I was ready to burn
  my own house even, for Lygia&rsquo;s sake; but now I tell thee that I did not
  love her, for it was Christ who first taught me to love. In Him is the source
  of peace and happiness. It is not I who say this, but reality itself. Compare
  thy own luxury, my friend, lined with alarm, thy delights, not sure of a
  morrow, thy orgies, with the lives of Christians, and thou wilt find a ready
  answer. But, to compare better, come to our mountains with the odor of thyme,
  to our shady olive groves on our shores lined with ivy. A peace is waiting
  for thee, such as thou hast not known for a long time, and hearts that love
  thee sincerely. Thou, having a noble soul and a good one, shouldst be happy.
  Thy quick mind can recognize the truth, and knowing it thou wilt love it. To
  be its enemy, like Cæsar and Tigellinus, is possible, but indifferent to it
  no one can be. O my Petronius, Lygia and I are comforting ourselves with the
  hope of seeing thee soon. Be well, be happy, and come to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius received this letter in Cumæ, whither he had gone with other
  Augustians who were following Cæsar. His struggle of long years with
  Tigellinus was nearing its end. Petronius knew already that he must fall in
  that struggle, and he understood why. As Cæsar fell lower daily to the role
  of a comedian, a buffoon, and a charioteer; as he sank deeper in a sickly,
  foul, and coarse dissipation,&mdash;the exquisite arbiter became a mere
  burden to him. Even when Petronius was silent, Nero saw blame in his silence;
  when the arbiter praised, he saw ridicule. The brilliant patrician annoyed
  his self-love and roused his envy. His wealth and splendid works of art had
  become an object of desire both to the ruler and the all-powerful minister.
  Petronius was spared so far in view of the journey to Achæa, in which his
  taste, his knowledge of everything Greek, might be useful. But gradually
  Tigellinus explained to Cæsar that Carinas surpassed him in taste and
  knowledge, and would be better able to arrange in Achæa games, receptions,
  and triumphs. From that moment Petronius was lost. There was not courage to
  send him his sentence in Rome. Cæsar and Tigellinus remembered that that
  apparently effeminate and æsthetic person, who made &ldquo;day out of
  night,&rdquo; and was occupied only in luxury, art, and feasts, had shown
  amazing industry and energy, when proconsul in Bithynia and later when consul
  in the capital. They considered him capable of anything, and it was known
  that in Rome he possessed not only the love of the people, but even of the
  pretorians. None of Cæsar&rsquo;s confidants could foresee how Petronius
  might act in a given case; it seemed wiser, therefore, to entice him out of
  the city, and reach him in a province.</p>

  <p>With this object he received an invitation to go to Cumæ with other
  Augustians. He went, though suspecting the ambush, perhaps so as not to
  appear in open opposition, perhaps to show once more a joyful face devoid of
  every care to Cæsar and the Augustians, and to gain a last victory before
  death over Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the latter accused him of friendship with the Senator Scevinus,
  who was the soul of Piso&rsquo;s conspiracy. The people of Petronius, left in
  Rome, were imprisoned; his house was surrounded by pretorian guards. When he
  learned this, he showed neither alarm nor concern, and with a smile said to
  Augustians whom he received in his own splendid villa in Cumæ,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahenobarbus does not like direct questions; hence ye will see his
  confusion when I ask him if it was he who gave command to imprison my
  &lsquo;familia&rsquo; in the capital.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he invited them to a feast &ldquo;before the longer journey,&rdquo;
  and he had just made preparations for it when the letter from Vinicius
  came.</p>

  <p>When he received this letter, Petronius grew somewhat thoughtful, but
  after a time his face regained its usual composure, and that same evening he
  answered as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rejoice at your happiness and admire your hearts, for I had not
  thought that two lovers could remember a third person who was far away. Ye
  have not only not forgotten me, but ye wish to persuade me to go to Sicily,
  so that ye may share with me your bread and your Christ, who, as thou
  writest, has given you happiness so bountifully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If that be true, honor Him. To my thinking, however, Ursus had
  something to do with saving Lygia, and the Roman people also had a little to
  do with it. But since thy belief is that Christ did the work, I will not
  contradict. Spare no offerings to Him. Prometheus also sacrificed himself for
  man; but, alas! Prometheus is an invention of the poets apparently, while
  people worthy of credit have told me that they saw Christ with their own
  eyes. I agree with thee that He is the most worthy of the gods.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember the question by Paul of Tarsus, and I think that if
  Ahenobarbus lived according to Christ&rsquo;s teaching I might have time to
  visit you in Sicily. In that case we could converse, in the shade of trees
  and near fountains, of all the gods and all the truths discussed by Greek
  philosophers at any time. To-day I must give thee a brief answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I care for two philosophers only: Pyrrho and Anacreon. I am ready
  to sell the rest to thee cheaply, with all the Greek and Roman Stoics. Truth,
  Vinicius, dwells somewhere so high that the gods themselves cannot see it
  from the top of Olympus. To thee, carissime, thy Olympus seems higher still,
  and, standing there, thou callest to me, &rsquo;Come, thou wilt see such
  sights as thou hast not seen yet!&rsquo; I might. But I answer, &lsquo;I have
  not feet for the journey.&rsquo; And if thou read this letter to the end,
  thou wilt acknowledge, I think, that I am right.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, happy husband of the Aurora princess! thy religion is not for
  me. Am I to love the Bithynians who carry my litter, the Egyptians who heat
  my bath? Am I to love Ahenobarbus and Tigellinus? I swear by the white knees
  of the Graces, that even if I wished to love them I could not. In Rome there
  are a hundred thousand persons at least who have either crooked shoulders, or
  big knees, or thin thighs, or staring eyes, or heads that are too large. Dost
  thou command me to love these too? Where am I to find the love, since it is
  not in my heart? And if thy God desires me to love such persons, why in His
  all might did He not give them the forms of Niobe&rsquo;s children, for
  example, which thou hast seen on the Palatine? Whoso loves beauty is unable
  for that very reason to love deformity. One may not believe in our gods, but
  it is possible to love them, as Phidias, Praxiteles, Miron, Skopas, and
  Lysias loved.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Should I wish to go whither thou wouldst lead me, I could not. But
  since I do not wish, I am doubly unable. Thou believest, like Paul of Tarsus,
  that on the other side of the Styx thou wilt see thy Christ in certain
  Elysian fields. Let Him tell thee then Himself whether He would receive me
  with my gems, my Myrrhene vase, my books published by Sozius, and my
  golden-haired Eunice. I laugh at this thought; for Paul of Tarsus told me
  that for Christ&rsquo;s sake one must give up wreaths of roses, feasts, and
  luxury. It is true that he promised me other happiness, but I answered that I
  was too old for new happiness, that my eyes would be delighted always with
  roses, and that the odor of violets is dearer to me than stench from my foul
  neighbor of the Subura.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These are reasons why thy happiness is not for me. But there is one
  reason more, which I have reserved for the last: Thanatos summons me. For
  thee the light of life is beginning; but my sun has set, and twilight is
  embracing my head. In other words, I must die, carissime.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not worth while to talk long of this. It had to end thus.
  Thou, who knowest Ahenobarbus, wilt understand the position easily.
  Tigellinus has conquered, or rather my victories have touched their end. I
  have lived as I wished, and I will die as pleases me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not take this to heart. No God has promised me immortality;
  hence no surprise meets me. At the same time thou art mistaken, Vinicius, in
  asserting that only thy God teaches man to die calmly. No. Our world knew,
  before thou wert born, that when the last cup was drained, it was time to
  go,&mdash;time to rest,&mdash;and it knows yet how to do that with calmness.
  Plato declares that virtue is music, that the life of a sage is harmony. If
  that be true, I shall die as I have lived,&mdash;virtuously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to take farewell of thy godlike wife in the words
  with which on a time I greeted her in the house of Aulus, &rsquo;Very many
  persons have I seen, but thy equal I know not.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If the soul is more than what Pyrrho thinks, mine will fly to thee
  and Lygia, on its way to the edge of the ocean, and will alight at your house
  in the form of a butterfly or, as the Egyptians believe, in the form of a
  sparrowhawk. Otherwise I cannot come.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile let Sicily replace for you the gardens of Hesperides; may
  the goddesses of the fields, woods, and fountains scatter flowers on your
  path, and may white doves build their nests on every acanthus of the columns
  of your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch73"
     name="ch73">CHAPTER LXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Petronius was not mistaken. Two days later young Nerva, who
  had always been friendly and devoted, sent his freedman to Cumæ with news of
  what was happening at the court of Cæsar.</p>

  <p>The death of Petronius had been determined. On the morning of the
  following day they intended to send him a centurion, with the order to stop
  at Cumæ, and wait there for further instructions; the next messenger, to
  follow a few days later, was to bring the death sentence.</p>

  <p>Petronius heard the news with unruffled calmness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt take to thy lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one of my vases;
  say from me that I thank him with my whole soul, for now I am able to
  anticipate the sentence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And all at once he began to laugh, like a man who has came upon a perfect
  thought, and rejoices in advance at its fulfilment.</p>

  <p>That same afternoon his slaves rushed about, inviting the Augustians, who
  were staying in Cumæ, and all the ladies, to a magnificent banquet at the
  villa of the arbiter.</p>

  <p>He wrote that afternoon in the library; next he took a bath, after which
  he commanded the vestiplicæ to arrange his dress. Brilliant and stately as
  one of the gods, he went to the triclinium, to cast the eye of a critic on
  the preparations, and then to the gardens, where youths and Grecian maidens
  from the islands were weaving wreaths of roses for the evening.</p>

  <p>Not the least care was visible on his face. The servants only knew that
  the feast would be something uncommon, for he had issued a command to give
  unusual rewards to those with whom he was satisfied, and some slight blows to
  all whose work should not please him, or who had deserved blame or punishment
  earlier. To the cithara players and the singers he had ordered beforehand
  liberal pay. At last, sitting in the garden under a beech, through whose
  leaves the sun-rays marked the earth with bright spots, he called Eunice.</p>

  <p>She came, dressed in white, with a sprig of myrtle in her hair, beautiful
  as one of the Graces. He seated her at his side, and, touching her temple
  gently with his fingers, he gazed at her with that admiration with which a
  critic gazes at a statue from the chisel of a master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eunice,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;dost thou know that thou art not a
  slave this long time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised to him her calm eyes, as blue as the sky, and denied with a
  motion of her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am thine always,&rdquo; said she.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But perhaps thou knowest not,&rdquo; continued Petronius,
  &ldquo;that the villa, and those slaves twining wreaths here, and all which
  is in the villa, with the fields and the herds, are thine
  henceforward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eunice, when she heard this, drew away from him quickly, and asked in a
  voice filled with sudden fear,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou tell me this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then she approached again, and looked at him, blinking with amazement.
  After a while her face became as pale as linen. He smiled, and said only one
  word,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed; merely a slight breeze moved the leaves of
  the beech.</p>

  <p>Petronius might have thought that before him was a statue cut from white
  marble.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eunice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish to die calmly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the maiden, looking at him with a heart-rending smile,
  whispered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hear thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the evening the guests, who had been at feasts given by Petronius
  previously, and knew that in comparison with them even Cæsar&rsquo;s banquets
  seemed tiresome and barbarous, began to arrive in numbers. To no one did it
  occur, even, that that was to be the last &ldquo;symposium.&rdquo; Many knew,
  it is true, that the clouds of Cæsar&rsquo;s anger were hanging over the
  exquisite arbiter; but that had happened so often, and Petronius had been
  able so often to scatter them by some dexterous act or by a single bold word,
  that no one thought really that serious danger threatened him. His glad face
  and usual smile, free of care, confirmed all, to the last man, in that
  opinion. The beautiful Eunice, to whom he had declared his wish to die
  calmly, and for whom every word of his was like an utterance of fate, had in
  her features a perfect calmness, and in her eyes a kind of wonderful
  radiance, which might have been considered delight. At the door of the
  triclinium, youths with hair in golden nets put wreaths of roses on the heads
  of the guests, warning them, as the custom was, to pass the threshold right
  foot foremost. In the hall there was a slight odor of violets; the lamps
  burned in Alexandrian glass of various colors. At the couches stood Grecian
  maidens, whose office it was to moisten the feet of guests with perfumes. At
  the walls cithara players and Athenian choristers were waiting for the signal
  of their leader.</p>

  <p>The table service gleamed with splendor, but that splendor did not offend
  or oppress; it seemed a natural development. Joyousness and freedom spread
  through the hall with the odor of violets. The guests as they entered felt
  that neither threat nor constraint was hanging over them, as in Cæsar&rsquo;s
  house, where a man might forfeit his life for praises not sufficiently great
  or sufficiently apposite. At sight of the lamps, the goblets entwined with
  ivy, the wine cooling on banks of snow, and the exquisite dishes, the hearts
  of the guests became joyous. Conversation of various kinds began to buzz, as
  bees buzz on an apple tree in blossom. At moments it was interrupted by an
  outburst of glad laughter, at moments by murmurs of applause, at moments by a
  kiss placed too loudly on some white shoulder.</p>

  <p>The guests, while drinking wine, spilled from their goblets a few drops to
  the immortal gods, to gain their protection, and their favor for the host. It
  mattered not that many of them had no belief in the gods. Custom and
  superstition prescribed it. Petronius, inclining near Eunice, talked of Rome,
  of the latest divorces, of love affairs, of the races, of Spiculus, who had
  become famous recently in the arena, and of the latest books in the shops of
  Atractus and the Sozii. When he spilled wine, he said that he spilled it only
  in honor of the Lady of Cyprus, the most ancient divinity and the greatest,
  the only immortal, enduring, and ruling one.</p>

  <p>His conversation was like sunlight which lights up some new object every
  instant, or like the summer breeze which stirs flowers in a garden. At last
  he gave a signal to the leader of the music, and at that signal the citharæ
  began to sound lightly, and youthful voices accompanied. Then maidens from
  Kos, the birthplace of Eunice, danced, and showed their rosy forms through
  robes of gauze. Finally, an Egyptian soothsayer told the guests their future
  from the movement of rainbow colors in a vessel of crystal.</p>

  <p>When they had enough of these amusements, Petronius rose somewhat on his
  Syrian cushion, and said with hesitation,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, friends, for asking a favor at a feast. Will each man
  accept as a gift that goblet from which he first shook wine in honor of the
  gods and to my prosperity?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The goblets of Petronius were gleaming in gold, precious stones, and the
  carving of artists; hence, though gift giving was common in Rome, delight
  filled every heart. Some thanked him loudly: others said that Jove had never
  honored gods with such gifts in Olympus; finally, there were some who refused
  to accept, since the gifts surpassed common estimate.</p>

  <p>But he raised aloft the Myrrhene vase, which resembled a rainbow in
  brilliancy, and was simply beyond price.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the one out of which I poured in
  honor of the Lady of Cyprus. The lips of no man may touch it henceforth, and
  no hand may ever pour from it in honor of another divinity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He cast the precious vessel to the pavement, which was covered with lily-
  colored saffron flowers; and when it was broken into small pieces, he said,
  seeing around him astonished faces,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear friends, be glad and not astonished. Old age and weakness
  are sad attendants in the last years of life. But I will give you a good
  example and good advice: Ye have the power, as ye see, not to wait for old
  age; ye can depart before it comes, as I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What dost thou wish?&rdquo; asked a number of voices, with
  alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to rejoice, to drink wine, to hear music, to look on those
  divine forms which ye see around me, and fall asleep with a garlanded head. I
  have taken farewell of Cæsar, and do ye wish to hear what I wrote him at
  parting?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took from beneath the purple cushion a paper, and read as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, O Cæsar, that thou art awaiting my arrival with impatience,
  that thy true heart of a friend is yearning day and night for me. I know that
  thou art ready to cover me with gifts, make me prefect of the pretorian
  guards, and command Tigellinus to be that which the gods made him, a
  mule-driver in those lands which thou didst inherit after poisoning Domitius.
  Pardon me, however, for I swear to thee by Hades, and by the shades of thy
  mother, thy wife, thy brother, and Seneca, that I cannot go to thee. Life is
  a great treasure. I have taken the most precious jewels from that treasure,
  but in life there are many things which I cannot endure any longer. Do not
  suppose, I pray, that I am offended because thou didst kill thy mother, thy
  wife, and thy brother; that thou didst burn Rome and send to Erebus all the
  honest men in thy dominions. No, grandson of Chronos. Death is the
  inheritance of man; from thee other deeds could not have been expected. But
  to destroy one&rsquo;s ear for whole years with thy poetry, to see thy belly
  of a Domitius on slim legs whirled about in Pyrrhic dance; to hear thy music,
  thy declamation, thy doggerel verses, wretched poet of the suburbs,&mdash;is
  a thing surpassing my power, and it has roused in me the wish to die. Rome
  stuffs its ears when it hears thee; the world reviles thee. I can blush for
  thee no longer, and I have no wish to do so. The howls of Cerberus, though
  resembling thy music, will be less offensive to me, for I have never been the
  friend of Cerberus, and I need not be ashamed of his howling. Farewell, but
  make no music; commit murder, but write no verses; poison people, but dance
  not; be an incendiary, but play not on a cithara. This is the wish and the
  last friendly counsel sent thee by the&mdash;Arbiter Elegantiæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The guests were terrified, for they knew that the loss of dominion would
  have been less cruel to Nero than this blow. They understood, too, that the
  man who had written that paper must die; and at the same time pale fear flew
  over them because they had heard such a paper.</p>

  <p>But Petronius laughed with sincere and gladsome joy, as if it were a
  question of the most innocent joke; then he cast his eyes on all present, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be joyous, and drive away fear. No one need boast that he heard
  this letter. I will boast of it only to Charon when I am crossing in the boat
  with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He beckoned then to the Greek physician, and stretched out his arm. The
  skilled Greek in the twinkle of an eye opened the vein at the bend of the
  arm. Blood spurted on the cushion, and covered Eunice, who, supporting the
  head of Petronius, bent over him and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didst thou think that I would leave thee? If the gods gave me
  immortality, and Cæsar gave me power over the earth, I would follow thee
  still.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petronius smiled, raised himself a little, touched her lips with his, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stretched her rosy arm to the physician, and after a while her blood
  began to mingle and be lost in his blood.</p>

  <p>Then he gave a signal to the leader of the music, and again the voices and
  cithariæ were heard. They sang &ldquo;Harmodius&rdquo;; next the song of
  Anacreon resounded,&mdash;that song in which he complained that on a time he
  had found Aphrodite&rsquo;s boy chilled and weeping under trees; that he
  brought him in, warmed him, dried his wings, and the ungrateful child pierced
  his heart with an arrow,&mdash;from that moment peace had deserted the
  poet.</p>

  <p>Petronius and Eunice, resting against each other, beautiful as two
  divinities, listened, smiling and growing pale. At the end of the song
  Petronius gave directions to serve more wine and food; then he conversed with
  the guests sitting near him of trifling but pleasant things, such as are
  mentioned usually at feasts. Finally, he called to the Greek to bind his arm
  for a moment; for he said that sleep was tormenting him, and he wanted to
  yield himself to Hypnos before Thanatos put him to sleep forever.</p>

  <p>In fact, he fell asleep. When he woke, the head of Eunice was lying on his
  breast like a white flower. He placed it on the pillow to look at it once
  more. After that his veins were opened again.</p>

  <p>At his signal the singers raised the song of Anacreon anew, and the
  citharæ accompanied them so softly as not to drown a word. Petronius grew
  paler and paler; but when the last sound had ceased, he turned to his guests
  again and said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friends, confess that with us perishes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he had not power to finish; his arm with its last movement embraced
  Eunice, his head fell on the pillow, and he died.</p>

  <p>The guests looking at those two white forms, which resembled two wonderful
  statues, understood well that with them perished all that was left to their
  world at that time,&mdash;poetry and beauty.</p>

  <h2><a id="epi"
     name="epi">EPILOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At first the revolt of the Gallic legions under Vindex did
  not seem very serious. Cæsar was only in his thirty-first year, and no one
  was bold enough to hope that the world could be freed so soon from the
  nightmare which was stifling it. Men remembered that revolts had occurred
  more than once among the legions,&mdash;they had occurred in previous
  reigns,&mdash;revolts, however, which passed without involving a change of
  government; as during the reign of Tiberius, Drusus put down the revolt of
  the Pannonian legions. &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; said the people, &ldquo;can take
  the government after Nero, since all the descendants of the divine Augustus
  have perished?&rdquo; Others, looking at the Colossus, imagined him a
  Hercules, and thought that no force could break such power. There were those
  even who since he went to Achæa were sorry for him, because Helius and
  Polythetes, to whom he left the government of Rome and Italy, governed more
  murderously than he had.</p>

  <p>No one was sure of life or property. Law ceased to protect. Human dignity
  and virtue had perished, family bonds existed no longer, and degraded hearts
  did not even dare to admit hope. From Greece came accounts of the
  incomparable triumphs of Cæsar, of the thousands of crowns which he had won,
  the thousands of competitors whom he had vanquished. The world seemed to be
  one orgy of buffoonery and blood; but at the same time the opinion was fixed
  that virtue and deeds of dignity had ceased, that the time of dancing and
  music, of profligacy, of blood, had come, and that life must flow on for the
  future in that way. Cæsar himself, to whom rebellion opened the road to new
  robberies, was not concerned much about the revolt of the legions and Vindex;
  he even expressed his delight on that subject frequently. He did not wish to
  leave Achæa even; and only when Helius informed him that further delay might
  cause the loss of dominion did he move to Naples.</p>

  <p>There he played and sang, neglecting news of events of growing danger. In
  vain did Tigellinus explain to him that former rebellions of legions had no
  leaders, while at the head of affairs this time was a man descended from the
  ancient kings of Gaul and Aquitania, a famous and tried soldier.
  &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; answered Nero, &ldquo;the Greeks listen to me,&mdash;the
  Greeks, who alone know how to listen, and who alone are worthy of my
  song.&rdquo; He said that his first duty was art and glory. But when at last
  the news came that Vindex had proclaimed him a wretched artist, he sprang up
  and moved toward Rome. The wounds inflicted by Petronius, and healed by his
  stay in Greece, opened in his heart anew, and he wished to seek retribution
  from the Senate for such unheard-of injustice.</p>

  <p>On the road he saw a group cast in bronze, representing a Gallic warrior
  as overcome by a Roman knight; he considered that a good omen, and
  thenceforward, if he mentioned the rebellious legions and Vindex, it was only
  to ridicule them. His entrance to the city surpassed all that had been
  witnessed earlier. He entered in the chariot used by Augustus in his triumph.
  One arch of the Circus was destroyed to give a road to the procession. The
  Senate, knights, and innumerable throngs of people went forth to meet him.
  The walls trembled from shouts of &ldquo;Hail, Augustus! Hail, Hercules!
  Hail, divinity, the incomparable, the Olympian, the Pythian, the
  immortal!&rdquo; Behind him were borne the crowns, the names of cities in
  which he had triumphed; and on tablets were inscribed the names of the
  masters whom he had vanquished. Nero himself was intoxicated with delight,
  and with emotion he asked the Augustians who stood around him, &ldquo;What
  was the triumph of Julius compared with this?&rdquo; The idea that any mortal
  should dare to raise a hand on such a demigod did not enter his head. He felt
  himself really Olympian, and therefore safe. The excitement and the madness
  of the crowd roused his own madness. In fact, it might seem in the day of
  that triumph that not merely Cæsar and the city, but the world, had lost its
  senses.</p>

  <p>Through the flowers and the piles of wreaths no one could see the
  precipice. Still that same evening columns and walls of temples were covered
  with inscriptions, describing Nero&rsquo;s crimes, threatening him with
  coming vengeance, and ridiculing him as an artist. From mouth to mouth went
  the phrase, &ldquo;He sang till he roused the Gauls.&rdquo; Alarming news
  made the rounds of the city, and reached enormous measures. Alarm seized the
  Augustians. People, uncertain of the future, dazed not express hopes or
  wishes; they hardly dared to feel or think.</p>

  <p>But he went on living only in the theatre and music. Instruments newly
  invented occupied him, and a new water-organ, of which trials were made on
  the Palatine. With childish mind, incapable of plan or action, he imagined
  that he could ward off danger by promises of spectacles and theatrical
  exhibitions reaching far into the future, Persons nearest him, seeing that
  instead of providing means and an army, he was merely searching for
  expressions to depict the danger graphically, began to lose their heads.
  Others thought that he was simply deafening himself and others with
  quotations, while in his soul he was alarmed and terrified. In fact, his acts
  became feverish. Every day a thousand new plans flew through his head. At
  times he sprang up to rush out against danger; gave command to pack up his
  lutes and citharæ, to arm the young slave women as Amazons, and lead the
  legions to the East. Again he thought to finish the rebellion of the Gallic
  legions, not with war, but with song; and his soul laughed at the spectacle
  which was to follow his conquest of the soldiers by song. The legionaries
  would surround him with tears in their eyes; he would sing to them an
  epinicium, after which the golden epoch would begin for him and for Rome. At
  one time he called for blood; at another he declared that he would be
  satisfied with governing in Egypt. He recalled the prediction which promised
  him lordship in Jerusalem, and he was moved by the thought that as a
  wandering minstrel he would earn his daily bread,&mdash;that cities and
  countries would honor in him, not Cæsar, the lord of the earth, but a poet
  whose like the world had not produced before. And so he struggled, raged,
  played, sang, changed his plan, changed his quotations, changed his life and
  the world into a dream absurd, fantastic, dreadful, into an uproarious hunt
  composed of unnatural expressions, bad verses, groans, tears, and blood; but
  meanwhile the cloud in the west was increasing and thickening every day. The
  measure was exceeded; the insane comedy was nearing its end.</p>

  <p>When news that Galba and Spain had joined the uprising came to his ears,
  he fell into rage and madness. He broke goblets, overturned the table at a
  feast, and issued orders which neither Helius nor Tigeliinus himself dared to
  execute. To kill Gauls resident in Rome, fire the city a second time, let out
  the wild beasts, and transfer the capital to Alexandria seemed to him great,
  astonishing, and easy. But the days of his dominion had passed, and even
  those who shared in his former crimes began to look on him as a madman.</p>

  <p>The death of Vindex, and disagreement in the revolting legions seemed,
  however, to turn the scale to his side. Again new feasts, new triumphs, and
  new sentences were issued in Rome, till a certain night when a messenger
  rushed up on a foaming horse, with the news that in the city itself the
  soldiers had raised the standard of revolt, and proclaimed Galba Cæsar.</p>

  <p>Nero was asleep when the messenger came; but when he woke he called in
  vain for the night-guard, which watched at the entrance to his chambers. The
  palace was empty. Slaves were plundering in the most distant corners that
  which could be taken most quickly. But the sight of Nero frightened them; he
  wandered alone through the palace, filling it with cries of despair and
  fear.</p>

  <p>At last his freedmen, Phaon, Sporus, and Epaphroditus, came to his rescue.
  They wished him to flee, and said that there was no time to be lost; but he
  deceived himself still. If he should dress in mourning and speak to the
  Senate, would it resist his prayers and eloquence? If he should use all his
  eloquence, his rhetoric and skill of an actor, would any one on earth have
  power to resist him? Would they not give him even the prefecture of
  Egypt?</p>

  <p>The freedmen, accustomed to flatter, had not the boldness yet to refuse
  him directly; they only warned him that before he could reach the Forum the
  people would tear him to pieces, and declared that if he did not mount his
  horse immediately, they too would desert him.</p>

  <p>Phaon offered refuge in his villa outside the Nomentan Gate. After a while
  they mounted horses, and, covering Nero&rsquo;s head with a mantle, they
  galloped off toward the edge of the city. The night was growing pale. But on
  the streets there was a movement which showed the exceptional nature of the
  time. Soldiers, now singly and now in small groups, were scattered through
  the city. Not far from the camp Cæsar&rsquo;s horse sprang aside suddenly at
  sight of a corpse. The mantle slipped from his head; a soldier recognized
  Nero, and, confused by the unexpected meeting, gave the military salute.
  While passing the pretorian camp, they heard thundering shouts in honor of
  Galba. Nero understood at last that the hour of death was near. Terror and
  reproaches of conscience seized him. He declared that he saw darkness in
  front of him in the form of a black cloud. From that cloud came forth faces
  in which he saw his mother, his wife, and his brother. His teeth were
  chattering from fright; still his soul of a comedian found a kind of charm in
  the horror of the moment. To be absolute lord of the earth and lose all
  things, seemed to him the height of tragedy; and faithful to himself, he
  played the first role to the end. A fever for quotations took possession of
  him, and a passionate wish that those present should preserve them for
  posterity. At moments he said that he wished to die, and called for Spiculus,
  the most skilled of all gladiators in killing. At moments he declaimed,
  &ldquo;Mother, wife, father, call me to death!&rdquo; Flashes of hope rose in
  him, however, from time to time,&mdash;hope vain and childish. He knew that
  he was going to death, and still he did not believe it.</p>

  <p>They found the Nomentan Gate open. Going farther, they passed near
  Ostrianum, where Peter had taught and baptized. At daybreak they reached
  Phaon&rsquo;s villa.</p>

  <p>There the freedmen hid from him no longer the fact that it was time to
  die. He gave command then to dig a grave, and lay on the ground so that they
  might take accurate measurement. At sight of the earth thrown up, however,
  terror seized him. His fat face became pale, and on his forehead sweat stood
  like drops of dew in the morning. He delayed. In a voice at once abject and
  theatrical, he declared that the hour had not come yet; then he began again
  to quote. At last he begged them to burn his body. &ldquo;What an artist is
  perishing!&rdquo; repeated he, as if in amazement.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Phaon&rsquo;s messenger arrived with the announcement that the
  Senate had issued the sentence that the &ldquo;parricide&rdquo; was to be
  punished according to ancient custom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the ancient custom?&rdquo; asked Nero, with whitened
  lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They will fix thy neck in a fork, flog thee to death, and hurl thy
  body into the Tiber,&rdquo; answered Epaphroditus, abruptly.</p>

  <p>Nero drew aside the robe from his breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is time, then!&rdquo; said he, looking into the sky. And he
  repeated once more, &ldquo;What an artist is perishing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment the tramp of a horse was heard. That was the centurion
  coming with soldiers for the head of Ahenobarbus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; cried the freedmen.</p>

  <p>Nero placed the knife to his neck, but pushed it only timidly. It was
  clear that he would never have courage to thrust it in. Epaphroditus pushed
  his hand suddenly,&mdash;the knife sank to the handle. Nero&rsquo;s eyes
  turned in his head, terrible, immense, frightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bring thee life!&rdquo; cried the centurion, entering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; said Nero, with a hoarse voice; then he
  added,&mdash; ldquo;Here is faithfulness!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a twinkle death seized his head. Blood from his heavy neck gushed in a
  dark stream on the flowers of the garden. His legs kicked the ground, and he
  died.</p>

  <p>On the morrow the faithful Acte wrapped his body in costly stuffs, and
  burned him on a pile filled with perfumes.</p>

  <p>And so Nero passed, as a whirlwind, as a storm, as a fire, as war or death
  passes; but the basilica of Peter rules till now, from the Vatican heights,
  the city, and the world.</p>

  <p>Near the ancient Porta Capena stands to this day a little chapel with the
  inscription, somewhat worn: Quo Vadis, Domine?</p>
