<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h3>
<p><span class="a">A brief</span> piece of autobiography will
best serve to explain the purpose of this book. In October, 1912,
as a research student at the London School of Economics, I began
to study the introduction, in 1855, of responsible government
into Australia. Very soon, however, I discovered that this change
had been made possible only by a movement for colonial reform
which had begun as early as 1829. I then began to examine the
work of that extremely able group of men who had then developed
theories of colonization, with special reference to Australia,
and had succeeded in putting into practice, though imperfectly,
many of their theories, of which responsible government for
colonies was one. The leader of this group was Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, whose name is familiar to every student of land
settlement in Australia. On examining the great mass of
literature, expository and controversial, which surrounds his
theory, I could find no book which seemed to do justice to
Wakefield's achievements in colonization and colonial policy.
Much of what has been written is polemical in character, and many
of the works contemporary with Wakefield are spoilt by an obvious
bias for or against him. Writings which were not guilty of these
defects were for other reasons inadequate. Herman Merivale's
account in his <i>Lectures on Colonization and the Colonies</i>,
is a fair, critical examination of the Wakefield theory, but at
the time when he first wrote, 1839-41, much of the data for a
complete survey of the theory was wanting. Professor Egerton, in
his <i>Short History of British Colonial Policy</i>, has shown
Wakefield's place in the development of colonial policy, and Mr.
W. P. Reeves, in his <i>State Experiments in Australia and New
Zealand</i>, has criticized the Wakefield system from the
colonial point of view. Both of these writers, however, have
necessarily been limited by considerations of space. Dr.
Garnett's <i>Life of Wakefield</i>, while giving an interesting
picture of Wakefield himself, pays too little attention to his
doctrines, and does not appreciate the significance of the
central one, namely, the necessity of imposing a "sufficient
price" on colonial waste land. Both this book and M. André
Siegfried's essay, "Edward Gibbon Wakefield, et sa doctrine de la
colonization systématique," make little use of the voluminous
material contained in the Colonial Office papers in the Public
Record Office. Nor could I find anywhere a proper appreciation of
the fact that the Wakefield theory had a definite political as
well as a social and economic side. Indeed, this was the only
permanent part of the Wakefield system, for it was especially in
the direction of responsible government for colonies that
Wakefield and his followers achieved lasting results.
Consequently I determined to give an account of the Wakefield
system of colonization in theory and practice, and especially in
its effect upon Australian colonization. Wakefield's influence
extended beyond 1842, the date at which this book ends; but even
a research student has to stop somewhere, and I chose 1842 as it
seemed to me that in the Australian Waste Lands Act of that year
the Wakefield system on its economic side most nearly approached
complete realization in Australia. To stop here meant practically
to exclude his interesting experiments in colonizing New Zealand;
but these have been described and criticized more often than the
corresponding experiments on the mainland of Australia.</p>
<p>I make no apology for the inclusion of many footnotes and
detailed references. These may be skipped by the ordinary reader,
if there be any; but experience has convinced me that to a
student the value of a piece of original research often lies as
much in a writer's references as in his conclusions.</p>
<p>I am very glad to acknowledge my great obligations to
Professor Graham Wallas, who supervised my work from its
inception. To him is due the suggestion that I should examine the
work of this group of "systematic colonizers." I have to thank
him for his constant encouragement, and for his unsparing
criticism and advice, without which this book would not have been
written.</p>
<p>I have also to thank my friend, Mr. J. Drummond Smith, M.A.
(Aberdeen), of the London School of Economics, who found time to
read my book in manuscript, and to assist me in reading the
proofs.</p>
<p>The generous assistance of the Rhodes' Trustees has made
possible the publication of my book at the present time.</p>
<p>As a visitor to this country I think it only right to record
my appreciation of the courteous treatment which I have uniformly
received from officials in the various libraries which I have had
occasion to use, especially those of the British Museum, the
Public Record Office, the Colonial Office, the Royal Colonial
Institute, and the British Library of Political Science at the
London School of Economics.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenneth Cotton, of the British Library of Political
Science, has prepared the index to this book.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><span class="a">A good</span> book serves many purposes. This
book, for instance, gives the first adequate account&mdash;from
hitherto unpublished sources&mdash;of fourteen all-important
years in Australian history, and the first adequate analysis of
Edward Gibbon Wakefield's work. But it also provides the student
of political science (and from that point of view I shall now
consider it) with an admirable example of the part which may be
played in the development of human institutions by conscious
political thought.</p>
<p>Sir John Seeley, writing in 1883, told us that the English
nation had "conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of
absence of mind." If that had been true, if the settlement of
Australia and New Zealand had been directed by nothing except the
desire of individual pioneers to make money, or of routine
officials to evade difficulties, Australasian history during the
nineteenth century would have been a tragedy of wasted
opportunity. The period of British convict labour would have been
followed by waves of coolie labour, Indian, Chinese, and Papuan.
Absentee capitalists from every industrial nation would have
scrambled for careless or corrupt grants of land and mining
rights, and would have exploited the sheep farms and townsites of
Australia, or the forests of New Zealand, as they now exploit the
rubber-trade of Borneo or the Congo. Even if Great Britain had
retained sovereignty over the whole territory, she would not have
granted rights of self-government to a population so gathered. No
Australasian "Monroe Doctrine" would have been strong enough to
prevent the constant interference, official or unofficial, of the
other Powers in the interest of their own concessionaires; and a
series of intrigues and risings would have followed, as barren of
good result as are the civil wars of Central and South
America.</p>
<p>Writing, as I am, in July, 1915, I do not claim that the world
system which was developed during the nineteenth century has been
conspicuously successful in ensuring human progress and
happiness; but I am at least sure that Australia and New Zealand
have made a better start in social organization than Cuba or
Paraguay, and that they owe that better start largely to the fact
that Wakefield and his followers forced the British Government in
the critical years of 1830 to 1845 to awake from its absence of
mind.</p>
<p>Wakefield was, of course, not the first man to think or write
on British colonization, and those who wish to understand what
were the qualities in his work which enabled him to serve so
effectually the Empire and mankind should begin by comparing,
say, his Letter from Sydney (1829) with anything which had
appeared on the subject during the preceding twenty years.</p>
<p>I have just re-read James Mill's well-known article on
Colonies in the Supplement to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>
(1818-1824). The article is still good reading, if only for its
hard Scotch logic and Scotch contempt for English mental
slackness&mdash;as when Mill says, "Parliament, we have pretty
good experience, cannot make things by affirming them.
<i>Things</i> are a little more stubborn than the credulity of
Englishmen." His summary of Adam Smith's arguments against
monopoly, and of the Commons Committee Report on Transportation,
could hardly be better done, and his references to "the
superstitions of the nursery" about Malthusianism, or to the
policy of the "Ruling Few" in England, show us the utilitarian
philosophy not grown respectable, but young and fierce.</p>
<p>And yet the most conscientious statesman who should have read
Mill's article in the hope of learning how to make a good colony,
would have received no help whatever from it. If we exclude
India, which he doubtfully brings under his definition, Mill is
simply not interested in any colony, present or future. Facts
like transportation and monopoly are criticized solely from their
effect on the mother country, and the final section headed
"Tendency of colonial possessions to produce or prolong bad
government" refers solely to home politics, and never hints that
it may be important whether the governments of the colonies
themselves are good or bad.</p>
<p>A less obvious defect in the article is its abstractedness.
Colonists are divided into "delinquents" and the rest, and are
thenceforward thought of as "population," consisting of so many
identical integers in a simple arithmetical argument.
"Territory," "capital," and "labour," are equally abstract.</p>
<p>Mill was already a respected philosopher when he wrote his
article. Wakefield, when he wrote his Letter from Sydney, was in
Newgate, where after an idle and unsatisfactory youth he was
serving a sentence of three years for abduction. One feels,
however, that Wakefield wrote under incomparably better
intellectual conditions than Mill. Newgate in the early
nineteenth century was not, according to our present ideas, a
well-managed prison; but it did not condemn men of original
genius, as modern prison discipline does, to the daily
sterilizing fatigue of useless manual labour. Wakefield wrote,
not to make money, but under the sting of personal shame and
thwarted ambition. He thought, not of abstract "colonies," and
abstract "populations," but of the place where he would probably
make his home, and the men and women and children who would be
his shipmates and neighbours. He sees with extraordinary
vividness the population of Sydney as he supposes it to be. The
convicts are his fellow prisoners in Newgate, with their
calculated endurance and dumb cunning; the "remittance men," as
we should now call them, are the corresponding class with whom he
had lived in Florence or Boulogne. The future emigrants whom he
hopes for are neither units of abstract "population" nor the
results of Mr. Wilmot-Horton's "pauper-shovelling." He gives half
a rapid page to a list of the specialized types who go to make up
the English middle class, ending with "lawyers, clergymen,
singers, milliners, and other female artists; and, at least, one
good Political Economist at each settlement to prevent us from
devising an Australian Tariff" (p. 187). Above all he thinks of
British colonial policy in the light, not merely of its reaction
on home politics, but also of its effect on the colonies
themselves. His system, he argues, "would tend more than anything
else to preserve an intimate connection between the colony and
the mother country," for the reason that "the mother country and
the colony would become partners in a new trade&mdash;the
creation of happy human beings." (p. 196).</p>
<p>Even after Wakefield, on his release from prison, became, not
a colonist, but a life-long organizer of colonization, his
thinking always retained this concrete quality. In his <i>Art of
Colonization</i> (1849), for instance, he says: "In colonization
women have a part so important that all depends on their
participation in the work . . . the women's participation must
begin with a man's first thought about emigration, and must
extend to nearly all the arrangements he has to make, and the
things he has to do, from the moment of contemplating departure
from the family home, till the domestic party shall be
comfortably housed in the new country . . . You may make a colony
agreeable to men and not to women; you cannot make it agreeable
to women without being agreeable to men" (p. 155).</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Mills brings forward evidence (p. 136-139) to show
that Wakefield borrowed more of the details of his theory than
has hitherto been recognized from Robert Gourlay. But Wakefield
understood as Gourlay never did the "public duty" which, as Burke
said, "requires that what is right, should not only be made
known, but made prevalent." To convert a promising member of
Parliament, to coach a witness before a Committee, to write or
inspire an effective pamphlet, was to him an inseparable part of
the same "mental strife" as the invention or adaptation of a
system of land-sales or responsible government. He created not
thought only, but, like an old Greek philosopher, a school of
thinkers and statesmen. He and his friends hoped because they
believed they knew; and their pursuit of further knowledge was,
in turn, the result of their hope.</p>
<p>But Wakefield's career shows that success in political
construction requires not only the co-operation, but the free
conflict of many minds and wills. The factors in any political
problem are so enormously complex that no single man can either
realize them all before action, or hope to introduce of his own
motion all even of the most essential modifications of his
schemes during action. "The subtlety of nature," said Bacon, "is
many times greater than the subtlety of the human senses and the
human mind." Without a deliberately constructed plan of campaign
no general can expect to win; but the best plan of campaign,
before it leads to victory, will have to be modified, not by its
author only, but by the irritating criticism of the "man on the
spot," or the resistance of the enemy. I know nothing in the
intellectual history of politics which illustrates this better
than the account which Mr. Mills gives of the conflict between
Sir George Gipps and the Wakefield theory in 1838-1841 (pp.
290-298). Land sale at a fixed price had by that time become in
Wakefield's mind an essential part of his scheme. Gipps forced
the Home Government to allow him to sell land in New South Wales
by auction; and we can now see that if he had not done so, the
whole Wakefield scheme would have collapsed. Gipps was an able
Colonial Governor, who compelled the Colonial Office to give way
to him and thereby saved the essentials of a scheme which he
modified in detail. In another and even more important case the
opposition of the colonists themselves, made effective by
Wakefield's own plan of colonial self-government, prevented the
destruction of Wakefield's hopes by an influx of Asiatic and
Polynesian indentured labour. In his Letter from Sydney,
Wakefield tolerated convict labour, and argued (p. 204), that
"the Chinese are well disposed to emigrate, and that it would be
hardly possible to select a more useful description of labour."
He afterwards became a convinced opponent of convict labour, but
as late as 1852 he urged the importation of indentured Chinese
labour (Mills, p. 300, note 2). It was the Australian assemblies
and the colonial ministries which the assemblies soon came to
control that abolished transportation and prevented Eastern
indentured labour; and it was to Wakefield more than to any other
single man that colonial self-government owed its existence.</p>
<p>A general, with the roar of cheering crowds in his ears
forgets how different what was done proved to be from his
original painfully thought-out plan. But political campaigns
never come to an end, and political victories are not easy to
distinguish from defeats. Wakefield had not only one of the most
original, but one of the most elastic and teachable intellects of
his time, and there are few political inventors to whom
historians would ascribe so large a measure of practical success;
and yet when he died in 1862 he must still have felt, as indeed
he constantly complained throughout his political life, that his
theory had never had "a fair trial," that it had never been
really understood, and that no attempt had been made to put it
completely into operation. It is we who can see now that a "fair"
and "complete" trial of the Wakefield theory would have been
fatal both to the theory itself and to Australasian
prosperity.</p>
<p>If the British Empire, for which Wakefield toiled, and in
which he so resolutely believed, is to survive and play its part
in the evolution of a community of nations guided by some higher
purpose than that of internecine warfare, a body of organized
thought more concrete, more penetrating, more patient even that
that of Wakefield and his faithful disciples will be required.
That thought must go on in human brains, having their bodily
habitation neither at the centre of the Empire only, nor only at
its circumference. It must be the work neither of practical
statesmen only nor only of theorists, not of a group of friends
only, but also of sincere opponents. The question whether enough
of such thought can be created to secure in the twentieth century
that measure of slow and partial success which history allows us
to hope for in the organization of human society is of vital
importance to the whole fabric of civilization. Its creation will
need many improvements in political machinery, and perhaps the
growth of a more serious and responsible press than now exists.
But, sometimes, when Mr. Mills brought me, during the early dark
days of the war, the final chapters of this book for criticism, I
wondered whether an important contribution to that work might not
come from an improved organization of the Universities of Greater
Britain, and perhaps also of their relation to those of America.
The Universities of Europe, when they finally abandoned Latin as
the spoken language of learning, gained much from introducing
into the lecture-room the speech of ordinary life, but lost much
by the difficulty of exchanging ideas across the boundaries of
states. To-day the English-speaking Universities are sometimes
controlled by literary and philosophical traditions less free and
penetrating than those which have grown up in the continent of
Europe, and their organization of sub-divided research is often
far less thorough. But for the purposes of political science they
possess the all-important advantages that they use one language,
and draw their intellectual traditions from societies which, with
all their variation of type, possess the common factor of a love
and understanding of political freedom. The wandering student of
the theory of the State, whether he intends to be teacher, or
statesman, or official, or writer, or each in turn, can now cross
the seven seas as his continental predecessors five hundred years
ago crossed the Alpine passes; and in any University in which the
English tongue is spoken he will find opportunities for informal
intercourse and good-tempered controversy. All that is wanted for
the growth of a great school of political analysis and invention
is that the Universities themselves should be more conscious of
each others' existence, and more ready to organize their joint
efforts in a task which no one of them can perform unaided.</p>

<h2>THE COLONIZATION<br>
OF AUSTRALIA</h2>
<br>
<a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>
<h4><span class="a">Chapter I</span></h4>
<h3>THE BRITISH COLONIES IN 1830</h3>
<p><span class="a">In</span> 1830 the colonies of Great Britain
consisted of some thirty <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#fn1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
possessions, differing widely in soil and climate, and containing
communities varying in race and language, in origin and in
character.</p>
<p>There were remnants of the old colonial empire, which was
dismembered at the humiliating peace of 1783, such as Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick. There were later acquisitions by conquest like
the Cape of Good Hope, or by settlement like the Swan River
colony. Some were mere spots on the globe, held as military
outposts, such as Gibraltar, or as trading stations, like Cape
Coast Castle. Some like Grenada were small islands, and others
like New South Wales were coastal settlements on huge, almost
uninhabited continents.</p>
<p>The name "colony" was given alike to Ceylon, where a few
traders were scattered amongst a large alien population, and to
Jamaica, where a small body of planters maintained themselves
amidst a large army of slaves. Even India was at times included
amongst the colonies, <a name="FNanchor_1_2" id=
"FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#fn1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
although not officially recognized as a colony by the Colonial
Office. <a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href=
"#fn1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>Geographically, the colonies fell into six main
groups&mdash;North America, West Indies (including some
settlements in South America), Africa, Australasia, East Indies,
and Europe.</p>
<h3>NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES. <small><a name="FNanchor_1_4" id=
"FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#fn1_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></small></h3>
<p>Canada proper, <i>i.e</i>., Canada as distinguished from the
maritime provinces, had been divided in 1791 <a name=
"FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#fn1_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> into two provinces, Upper and Lower
Canada&mdash;the former mainly English in character, the latter
mainly French. <a name="FNanchor_1_6" id=
"FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#fn1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
Upper Province was peopled by American loyalists or their
descendants, and by British immigrants.</p>
<p>The Lower Province was peopled mainly by French Canadians, but
the presence of a large minority <a name="FNanchor_1_7" id=
"FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#fn1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of
British settlers made it at the moment the theatre of a racial
struggle.</p>
<p>Of the other North American colonies, Newfoundland was treated
as a mere fishing station, and settlement there was discouraged.
<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#fn1_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<h3>WEST INDIAN COLONIES. <small><a name="FNanchor_1_9" id=
"FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#fn1_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a></small></h3>
<p>The chief industry of these islands was the production of
sugar. Their prosperity had been built upon the two pillars of
slave labour and monopoly of the English sugar market, each of
which was now dangerously insecure. The English evangelicals who
had in 1807 abolished the slave trade to English colonies made no
secret of the fact that the abolition of colonial slavery was
their next aim <a name="FNanchor_1_10" id=
"FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#fn1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and they were within measurable distance of success. In addition,
the discredit into which the mercantile system had fallen
seriously threatened the sugar monopoly.</p>
<p>One advantage possessed by this group was that, in the
unreformed Parliament, the sugar planters were a well-recognized
interest, capable of urging the colonial point of view on English
legislators. <a name="FNanchor_1_11" id=
"FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#fn1_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Their views on slavery, monopoly, and sugar duties were ably
voiced in Parliament. The Marquis of Chandos, for example, when
asking in the House of Commons in 1830 for a reduction of the
sugar duties, called "on all those gentlemen who had obtained
seats in that House through West India property&mdash;and he knew
that there were many&mdash;to assist him in relieving that
interest." <a name="FNanchor_1_12" id=
"FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#fn1_12" class=

<br>
<h5>AFRICAN COLONIES</h5>
<p>In Africa <a name="FNanchor_1_13" id=
"FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#fn1_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
the Cape of Good Hope was the chief colony, occupying an
important commercial and strategic position as a post of call on
the way to India. At the Cape there was a double racial
problem&mdash;friction between the Dutch and the English, and
conflict between white and black, complicated by native slavery.
<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#fn1_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p>Of the other African colonies, Mauritius was a sugar colony
taken from France, Cape Coast Castle a trading station, governed
by merchants, under the control of the Home Government <a name=
"FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#fn1_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> and Sierra Leone, a philanthropic but
unsuccessful attempt at colonization by free African labour.
<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#fn1_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<br>
<h5>AUSTRALIAN COLONIES</h5>
<p>In the Australasian group <a name="FNanchor_1_17" id=
"FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#fn1_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
there were two colonies which had been founded at the end of the
eighteenth century on entirely novel principles&mdash;New South
Wales (1788) and Van Diemen's land (1803), "our pickpocket
colonies," <a name="FNanchor_1_18" id=
"FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#fn1_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
receiving annually from Great Britain an increment of criminals.
<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#fn1_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p>It was not that transportation of convicts to other colonies
was unknown&mdash;few of the early American colonies were free
from the reproach; <a name="FNanchor_1_20" id=
"FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#fn1_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
but never before had England in the "heroical work" of planting,
used so extensively this "shameful and unblessed" <a name=
"FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#fn1_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> means. Convicts had provided labour before,
but had never actually founded colonies. Even this system of
convict colonization had been unable to keep out free settlers,
and as early as 1819 in New South Wales, and 1825 in Van Diemen's
Land, the bond were outnumbered by the free. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#fn1_22" class=
"fnanchor">[22]</a> John Macarthur, ex-army officer, farmer, and
importer of merino sheep, had demonstrated the suitability of
Australia for wool-growing; and this was the lure which overcame
the emigrant's repugnance <a name="FNanchor_1_23" id=
"FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#fn1_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
to association with convicts and ex-convicts.</p>
<p>Swan River was a very new colony, founded on the West Coast of
Australia in 1829, by Act of Parliament and Colonial Office
regulations, partly for fear that the French might found a colony
there, <a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href=
"#fn1_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and partly as an experiment
in free settlement. <a name="FNanchor_1_25" id=
"FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#fn1_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<br>
<h5>EAST INDIAN COLONIES <small><a name="FNanchor_1_26" id=
"FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#fn1_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a></small></h5>
<p>In the East Indies Ceylon alone was recognized by the Colonial
Office as a colony. <a name="FNanchor_1_27" id=
"FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#fn1_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
India was under the control of the East India Company, as also
were Singapore, Malacca, and Penang. <a name="FNanchor_1_28" id=
"FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#fn1_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Singapore had been founded by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819,
<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#fn1_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and had become almost immediately an
important trading station. <a name="FNanchor_1_30" id=
"FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href="#fn1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Since the Treaty of Amiens, in 1802, Ceylon had been incorporated
in the British dominions and governed directly from England.
<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#fn1_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> By 1830 rebellion had been put down
there, and the colony reduced to order. <a name="FNanchor_1_32"
id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#fn1_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<br>
<h5>EUROPEAN COLONIES</h5>
<p>In Europe, the chief British possessions were Heligoland,
Gibraltar, and Malta, of which the latter were military posts
under military rule <a name="FNanchor_1_33" id=
"FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#fn1_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
and hardly to be classed as colonies in any real sense.</p>
<p>While to the Colonial Office the units of these groups were
all colonies, and subject to the same policy, their governments
differed in principle and in detail.</p>
<p>There were two main classes of colonies. In the first were
those in which the "old colonial polity" <a name="FNanchor_1_34"
id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#fn1_34" class=
"fnanchor">[34]</a> of governor, council, and assembly, was
established with local variation in detail. The governor was
appointed by the Crown, the legislative council nominated by the
governor, and the assembly elected by the people. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_35" id="FNanchor_1_35"></a><a href="#fn1_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a> Legislative power was vested in governor,
council, and assembly, but executive power remained solely in the
hands of the governor, who was assisted by an executive council
of his own choosing, and responsible alone to him.</p>
<p>In this class were most of the West Indian colonies, and all
the North American, except Newfoundland. <a name="FNanchor_1_36"
id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#fn1_36" class=
"fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p>In the second class, consisting of what would now be called
Crown colonies, were the remaining possessions. They had no
representative institutions; both legislative and executive
powers were exercised by the Crown through the governor whom it
appointed, and the council, <a name="FNanchor_1_37" id=
"FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#fn1_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
which he appointed.</p>
<p>Up to the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain had, in
dealing with the colonies, almost invariably followed one
consistent line of policy in regard to government. Local
legislatures were granted to every colony acquired by cession or
by occupation; <a name="FNanchor_1_38" id=
"FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#fn1_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
conquered colonies, on the other hand, were ruled by governors
and executive councils appointed by the Crown. From the beginning
of the nineteenth century an entirely new line of policy was
equally consistently followed. <a name="FNanchor_1_39" id=
"FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#fn1_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
All new colonies, however acquired, were treated as conquered
colonies, <i>i.e</i>., they were not granted local legislatures,
but were governed as Crown colonies. <a name="FNanchor_1_40" id=
"FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#fn1_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p>It was, indeed, a principle of English law that the Crown had
"uncontrolled legislative authority over the conquered or ceded
colony." <a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href=
"#fn1_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Crown might, if it chose,
govern a conquered colony by means of a governor and a nominee
council, or it might grant representative institutions. Once such
a grant had been made, however, it could not be recalled except
by the Imperial Parliament. <a name="FNanchor_1_42" id=
"FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#fn1_42" class=
"fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
<p>Another principle was that an Englishman, when he settled
abroad, carried with him so much of English law as was applicable
to his new situation; <a name="FNanchor_1_43" id=
"FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#fn1_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and that this, in a settlement colony, could be changed only by a
representative assembly. <a name="FNanchor_1_44" id=
"FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#fn1_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
It followed from this, that the only constitution which could be
granted by the Crown to a settlement colony was one where the
lower house was elective. Parliament, therefore, had to be
invoked frequently in the nineteenth century to enable the Crown
to change the eighteenth century policy, and turn a settlement
colony into a Crown colony. This was effected by appointing a
governor and nominated council to legislate for the colony
without an elective assembly.</p>
<p>In the first class of colony the attempt was made to combine
legislative freedom with executive irresponsibility; for, even
where the local assemblies had a share in legislation, they had
little or no control over the executive. The governor was, as in
the Crown colonies, responsible to the Imperial Government alone;
and he chose his advisers irrespective of the question whether or
not they possessed the confidence of the legislature. This gave
unlimited opportunity for friction between the popular
legislature and the official executive, which developed into
serious struggles, especially in the Canadas. There a further
complication arose from the upper houses or legislative councils,
which, while they stood in theory, though imperfectly, for the
aristocratic principle of the British Constitution, <a name=
"FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#fn1_45" class=
"fnanchor">[45]</a> were in practice the mere nominees of the
executive, with which they sided in any contest. There, too, at
the moment, a long-standing quarrel was in progress between the
governor as head of the executive government, and the elective
assembly. In Lower Canada the struggle was embittered by racial
feeling between French and English, the French majority
supporting the assembly, and the English minority on the whole
supporting the executive. In both provinces the contest, more
violent in Lower than in Upper Canada, was fought out on various
grounds, such as the question of the constitution of the
legislative councils. Appeals were often made to the Imperial
Parliament to redress grievances, and Canadian affairs were
becoming a familiar topic of debate in the House of Commons.
<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#fn1_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
<p>From the Crown colonies, where executive and legislative power
was in the hands of the Crown or its nominees, there was much
less complaint. New South Wales, Newfoundland, and the Cape of
Good Hope had, however, recently asked the Home Government for
representative institutions. In each case the answer given
amounted to a virtual acceptance of the principle that the colony
should ultimately receive representative institutions, coupled
with a denial of the expediency of granting the request for the
present. <a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href=
"#fn1_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p>While the administration of both classes of colonies was
directly controlled by the Imperial Government, in both groups
the evils of government from a distance, and an administration
out of touch with the people, were increasingly evident.</p>
<p>Since the American Revolution the Crown had governed the
colonies with a firmer hand. The tendency of colonial policy in
regard to government was towards controlling the domestic
concerns of the colonies. <a name="FNanchor_1_48" id=
"FNanchor_1_48"></a><a href="#fn1_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Even in the representative group, the Crown's control in
executive matters often extended to mere details. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_49" id="FNanchor_1_49"></a><a href="#fn1_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a> The power which this centralized system threw
into the hands of the Crown was, at this time, nominally
exercised by a Minister responsible to Parliament, but actually
by the irresponsible permanent officials of the Colonial Office.
The peculiar circumstances of each of a variety of colonies could
not easily be grasped by the Secretary of State. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a><a href="#fn1_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> He was, therefore, necessarily dependent upon
his subordinates, <a name="FNanchor_1_51" id=
"FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#fn1_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
especially after 1827, when there were frequent changes of
Secretaries&mdash;as many as ten in the next twelve years.
<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#fn1_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Mr. (afterwards Sir James) Stephen was
Permanent Counsel to the Colonial Office from 1825 to 1834, when
he was appointed Assistant Under-Secretary of State for the
Colonies, becoming in 1836 Permanent Under-Secretary. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a><a href="#fn1_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a> He was a fervent evangelical, and an official
of the Church Missionary Society. From his father, James Stephen,
the brother-in-law and one of the most active supporters of
Wilberforce, and a prominent member of the Clapham Sect, he
inherited his passion for the abolition of slavery. Indeed, one
of his chief objects in entering the Colonial Office was to help
on this cause, for which he worked during the whole of his
official life. <a name="FNanchor_1_54" id=
"FNanchor_1_54"></a><a href="#fn1_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Another great object which he pursued faithfully was the
protection of native races in the colonies from injury by the
spread of colonization. He was always a zealous defender of
missionary, rather than of colonial interests. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#fn1_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a> Even before 1830 his influence was paramount
in the Colonial Office. At a later time his position as a
permanent official did not shield him from attack. His name was
identified with all the evils of colonial government, and
nicknames, "King Stephen," <a name="FNanchor_1_56" id=
"FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#fn1_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
"Mr. Over-Secretary Stephen," <a name="FNanchor_1_57" id=
"FNanchor_1_57"></a><a href="#fn1_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
"Mr. Mothercountry," <a name="FNanchor_1_58" id=
"FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#fn1_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
were showered upon him. <a name="FNanchor_1_59" id=
"FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#fn1_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
In 1838, when Sir William Molesworth made his grand attack on
Glenelg's colonial administration, Stephen feared that he was to
come in for a share of the blame. "I am scarcely twenty-four
hours off Sir William Molesworth's impeachment," he wrote, "in
which I hear from Charles Buller, a great friend of Sir
William's, that I am to have a conspicuous share. I am, it seems,
at your service, a rapacious, grasping, ambitious Tory. On two
unequal crutches propped he came, Glenelg's on this, on that Sir
G. Grey's name; and it appears that by the aid of these crutches
I have hobbled into a dominion wider than ever Nero possessed,
which I exercise like another Domitian." <a name="FNanchor_1_60"
id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#fn1_60" class=
"fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<p>Molesworth's charges, however, were levied only at Glenelg,
whose resignation they caused, and Stephen escaped censure. A
violent attack was made on him in 1839 by Sir F. B. Head, the
eccentric ex-governor of Upper Canada. He alleged that Stephen's
evil influence in the Colonial Office was the cause of the
misgovernment of the Canadas, and described him as the incubus
stifling Glenelg's measures. <a name="FNanchor_1_61" id=
"FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#fn1_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, the usual cry raised against Stephen was that for many
years successive Secretaries of State did no more than reflect
his views on colonial questions. <a name="FNanchor_1_62" id=
"FNanchor_1_62"></a><a href="#fn1_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
He was treated as the evil genius of the colonies, sitting in
Downing Street, and perversely frustrating all attempts of the
colonists to secure better government. Not only Stephen, but
other subordinate officials of the Colonial Office, had the
reputation of rulers of the colonies. In 1833 Greville speaks of
Henry (afterwards Sir Henry) Taylor as the man "who rules half
the West Indies in the Colonial Office, though with an invisible
sceptre." <a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href=
"#fn1_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p>Against all these attacks Stephen declared that he could only
vindicate himself by divulging official secrets, a breach of
trust of which he declined to be guilty. He also averred that he
had abundant means of clearing himself in this way, if he chose
to avail himself of them. <a name="FNanchor_1_64" id=
"FNanchor_1_64"></a><a href="#fn1_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
This being impossible to a permanent official situated as he was,
his defence was never made, and the secret history of his
influence on colonial policy remained largely a matter of
conjecture.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how much blame is to be attached to the
man, and how much to the system. The evidence of his colleague,
Henry Taylor, goes to show that his influence in the Colonial
Office was overwhelming, though by no means sinister. "James
Stephen," he wrote, "under the title of Counsel to the Colonial
Department, had, for some years more than any other man, ruled
the Colonial Empire." <a name="FNanchor_1_65" id=
"FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#fn1_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
And again, "for more than twenty-five years, during short tenures
of strong Secretaries of State, and entire tenures, whether short
or not, of some who were not strong, he, more than any other man,
virtually governed the Colonial Empire. Not that he was otherwise
than profoundly subordinate; but he found the way to bring men to
his own conclusions." <a name="FNanchor_1_66" id=
"FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#fn1_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Taylor, indeed, speaks of his own and Stephen's "usurped
functions," of which, he remarks, they were deprived by the
accession of a new political chief who reduced them for a while
to their "original insignificance." <a name="FNanchor_1_67" id=
"FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#fn1_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Again Taylor quite frankly admits that, when a mere clerk, he
himself forced a measure upon an unwilling Secretary of State.
<a name="FNanchor_1_68" id="FNanchor_1_68"></a><a href="#fn1_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<p>On the whole it is probable that the permanent officials of
this period wielded most of the power in the Colonial Office when
they were not checked by a strong political chief. When men like
Sir George Murray, or Lord Glenelg, were Secretaries of State for
the Colonies, there is no doubt that the subordinates ruled their
chiefs. Of the former, Stephen is reported to have said that, up
to the end of 1828, he had done nothing, had never written a
despatch, "had only once since he has been in office seen Taylor,
who has got all the West Indies under his care." <a name=
"FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69"></a><a href="#fn1_69" class=
"fnanchor">[69]</a> Hay, another of his subordinates, said of
Murray in 1830, "that for the many years he (Hay) had been in
office, he had never met with any public officer so totally
inefficient." <a name="FNanchor_1_70" id=
"FNanchor_1_70"></a><a href="#fn1_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a></p>
<p>Glenelg, too, is with justice reputed to have been the most
incompetent and inefficient, as well as the weakest. Secretary of
State for the Colonies of all who held office during the
nineteenth century, <a name="FNanchor_1_71" id=
"FNanchor_1_71"></a><a href="#fn1_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
although Stephen would not have subscribed to this opinion. To
Stephen, who shared his views on slavery and on the rights of
native races, Glenelg was, of the Secretaries of State whom he
had served up to 1839, "the most laborious, the most
conscientious, and the most enlightened minister of the public."

class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, when men like Lord Stanley, or Lord John
Russell, were in power, matters must have been very different.
The political chief of the Colonial Office was then the real
ruler, and the permanent officials took their proper place as
subordinates.</p>
<p>No doubt there was much exaggeration in the attacks made on
Stephen, and the suspicion with which he was regarded was often
unjust; but the system of control by Downing Street which he
represented was open to great objection. In such circumstances
colonial policy was apt to change according to whether the
Secretary of State was strong enough to take an independent line
of his own, or was a mere subordinate of his subordinates. A
consistent policy was the last thing the colonists came to expect
from Downing Street, and it was difficult for them to know how
much attention should be paid to orders and despatches which
might soon be revoked. <a name="FNanchor_1_73" id=
"FNanchor_1_73"></a><a href="#fn1_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Edward Gibbon Wakefield, later, called the system a central
bureaucratic one, "spoiled," in some colonies, "by being grafted
on to free institutions." <a name="FNanchor_1_74" id=
"FNanchor_1_74"></a><a href="#fn1_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
By this he drew attention to the striking fact that in the
colonies with the freest institutions there was most complaint
and least content.</p>
<p>This "essentially arbitrary government" <a name=
"FNanchor_1_75" id="FNanchor_1_75"></a><a href="#fn1_75" class=
"fnanchor">[75]</a> bore hardly on both classes of colonies, but
only in those with representative institutions was there any
recognized popular body to give utterance to the general feeling
of dissatisfaction. As Charles Buller afterwards put it, "Power
without representation is not so great an evil as representation
without executive responsibility. It is better to be without a
fire, than to have a fire without a chimney." <a name=
"FNanchor_1_76" id="FNanchor_1_76"></a><a href="#fn1_76" class=
"fnanchor">[76]</a></p>
<p>The inevitable evils of government from a distance were
accentuated by the indifferent ability and doubtful character of
some of the men sent out to take office in the colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_77" id="FNanchor_1_77"></a><a href="#fn1_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> When all the executive officers of a colony
were appointed by the governor or by the Colonial Office, there
was unlimited scope for patronage. <a name="FNanchor_1_78" id=
"FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#fn1_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
It was a source of complaint that men of broken fortunes were
sometimes shipped off by their friends to lucrative positions in
the colonies. <a name="FNanchor_1_79" id=
"FNanchor_1_79"></a><a href="#fn1_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Charles Buller could write as late as 1840 <a name=
"FNanchor_1_80" id="FNanchor_1_80"></a><a href="#fn1_80" class=
"fnanchor">[80]</a> that "the patronage of the Colonial Office is
the prey of every hungry department of our Government. On it the
Horse Guards quarters its worn-out general officers as governors;
the Admiralty cribs its share; and jobs which even Parliamentary
rapacity would blush to ask from the Treasury, are perpetrated
with impunity."</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell, in 1837, told Mr. Ruthven, one of his former
supporters, that "he stood convicted of crimes . . . of the most
disgraceful nature"; that his misconduct had rendered him
"totally unworthy of confidence as a public man"; that "it would
be vain to expect that the Government could possibly do anything
for him in Ireland, where his conduct was known"; but, that, if
he would cease to contest Kildare, O'Connell "would try whether
something might not be done for him in some of the colonies."

<p>Gibbon Wakefield tells of "colonial judges deeply in debt, and
alone saved by the privilege of their station from being taken to
jail by the officers of their court." <a name="FNanchor_1_82" id=

<p>In Lower Canada a receiver-general became insolvent for
£96,000 of the public money. <a name="FNanchor_1_83" id=

There also a judge continued to dispense justice although he was

while on the bench. <a name="FNanchor_1_84" id=

<p>Even governors were not always above reproach. Wakefield
writes <a name="FNanchor_1_85" id="FNanchor_1_85"></a><a href=
"#fn1_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of "governors landing in
secret, and getting hastily sworn into office in a corner, for
the purpose of hindering officers of the sheriff from executing a
writ of arrest against his excellency." Colonial governorships
were regarded as suitable rewards for service in the Army or the
Navy. <a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href=
"#fn1_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In Canada it was not until
1835 that the first civilian governor was appointed. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_87" id="FNanchor_1_87"></a><a href="#fn1_87" class=
"fnanchor">[87]</a> Of the first five governors of New South
Wales, four were naval officers; one of them, Macquarie, was at
constant feud with his subordinates; another, Bligh, was actually
deposed by his own officers for his misconduct. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_88" id="FNanchor_1_88"></a><a href="#fn1_88" class=
"fnanchor">[88]</a> Sometimes these governors discovered
unsuspected capacities for governing, and were both popular and
successful, but training at "the mess table of a regiment, or the
quarter-deck of a frigate," <a name="FNanchor_1_89" id=
"FNanchor_1_89"></a><a href="#fn1_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
more often unfitted them from dealing with free colonists.
<a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#fn1_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
<p>This then, in 1830, was the colonial system, or rather lack of
system, satirized by Disraeli two years before, in his <i>Voyage
of Captain Popanilla</i>. In that entertaining story the private
secretary one day discovers an uninhabited island, which produces
nothing, but is merely a bare rock. Its fortification is
immediately ordered, regardless of expense. A president of
council, a bishop, and a complete court of judicature are
provided. An agent is appointed for "the indemnification claims
of the original inhabitants." "Upon what system," inquired
Popanilla, "does your Government surround a small rock in the
middle of the sea with fortifications, and cram it full of
clerks, soldiers, lawyers, and priests?" "Why, really, your
Excellency," replied his guide, "I am the last man in the world
to answer questions, but I believe we call it the colonial
system." <a name="FNanchor_1_91" id="FNanchor_1_91"></a><a href=
"#fn1_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p>The total population of the colonies recognized by the
Colonial Office was roughly 3,100,000, <a name="FNanchor_1_92"
id="FNanchor_1_92"></a><a href="#fn1_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a> of whom about 1,200,000 were whites,
1,050,000 free blacks, and 850,000 slaves. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_93" id="FNanchor_1_93"></a><a href="#fn1_93" class=
"fnanchor">[93]</a> Convicts in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land numbered about 25,000. <a name="FNanchor_1_94" id=
"FNanchor_1_94"></a><a href="#fn1_94" class=
"fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>The annual cost of their civil government was about
£2,360,000, of which four-fifths was borne by the colonies, and
one-fifth by Great Britain. <a name="FNanchor_1_95" id=
"FNanchor_1_95"></a><a href="#fn1_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p>Their military establishments cost about £2,200,000 annually,
of which one-fifth was borne by the colonies and four-fifths by
Great Britain. <a name="FNanchor_1_96" id=
"FNanchor_1_96"></a><a href="#fn1_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p>About this time complaints were being made in Parliament of
the cost of colonial establishments, but some of these complaints
were hardly fair to the colonies, who were not altogether to
blame for the expense of their military establishments.
Especially was this so since it was the Duke of Wellington's
deliberate policy to hide away in distant colonies, in small
detachments, as much of the Army as he conveniently could, in
order to prevent complaints as to its size and cost. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_97" id="FNanchor_1_97"></a><a href="#fn1_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a> The whole position of the colonies was being
seriously threatened by the agitation for public economy which
Joseph Hume, as the mouthpiece of the Benthamite group, had for
some years carried on. <a name="FNanchor_1_98" id=
"FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#fn1_98" class=
"fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p>Current English opinion on colonies and colonization during
the first third of the nineteenth century was dominated by two
outstanding events&mdash;the publication of Adam Smith's
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> in 1776, and the American Revolution of
1776-83. When Adam Smith wrote, the official colonial policy was
the mercantile system, whose aim was to weld mother-country and
colony into "a self-sufficient economic unit." <a name=
"FNanchor_1_99" id="FNanchor_1_99"></a><a href="#fn1_99" class=
"fnanchor">[99]</a> Both were called upon to make sacrifices to
this end, though the mother-country was undoubtedly favoured.
<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href=
"#fn1_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Hence had arisen
restrictions on the trade of both, the monopoly of the colonial
trade, the view that it was commercially advantageous to the
mother-country to establish and maintain colonies, and that this
commercial advantage could only be secured by political dominion.
Adam Smith's doctrine of the evil of colonial monopoly struck a
decisive blow at this system, and his conclusions were considered
to be verified subsequently by the result to British trade of the
separation of the American colonies. <a name="FNanchor_1_101" id=
"FNanchor_1_101"></a><a href="#fn1_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> He drew a clear distinction between colonial
trade and colonial monopoly, insisting on the advantage of the
one and the evil of the other. "We must carefully distinguish,"
he wrote, "between the effects of the colony trade and those of
the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and necessarily
beneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful." <a name=
"FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a href="#fn1_102"
class="fnanchor">[102]</a> He condemned the monopoly as injurious
both to mother-country and to colony, and concluded that "colony
trade . . . is advantageous to Great Britain. . . not by means of
the monopoly, but in spite of the monopoly." <a name=
"FNanchor_1_103" id="FNanchor_1_103"></a><a href="#fn1_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In considering the value of the
political relation between mother-country and colony, he argued
that "Great Britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion
which she assumes over her colonies." <a name="FNanchor_1_104"
id="FNanchor_1_104"></a><a href="#fn1_104" class=
"fnanchor">[104]</a> Peaceful separation, though he did not
expect that it would ever be realized, <a name="FNanchor_1_105"
id="FNanchor_1_105"></a><a href="#fn1_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a> would, he suggested, free Great Britain from
a large expense, and bring about an advantageous free trade with
the colonies. <a name="FNanchor_1_106" id=
"FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#fn1_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
<p>The new and vigorous school of political economists, who wrote
in Great Britain during the decade following the Battle of
Waterloo, used the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, with more or less
adaptation and interpretation as the basis of their science.
Colonies were generally anathematized by them as part of that
mercantile system which Adam Smith had taught them to abhor. The
economists, indeed, were sometimes tempted to overlook his
distinction between colonial trade and monopoly, and impartially
to condemn both. <a name="FNanchor_1_107" id=
"FNanchor_1_107"></a><a href="#fn1_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> At times they went further than their master
in attacking, not only the supposed advantage of colonial
monopoly, but also the value of any political connection between
colony and mother-country. <a name="FNanchor_1_108" id=
"FNanchor_1_108"></a><a href="#fn1_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a> "The monopoly of the colony trade," wrote J.
R. McCulloch, in 1825, "instead of enriching, has really tended
to impoverish the nations who have established colonies."
<a name="FNanchor_1_109" id="FNanchor_1_109"></a><a href=
"#fn1_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> They taught that separation
was the true colonial policy, and constantly cited the American
Revolution as a conclusive proof. "Has the emancipation of the
colonies," wrote McCulloch, "been in the slightest degree
prejudicial to our wealth, commerce, or industry? The reverse, as
everyone knows, is decidedly the fact." <a name="FNanchor_1_110"
id="FNanchor_1_110"></a><a href="#fn1_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a> In their eyes the possession of colonies
under a policy of trade restriction not only conferred no
advantage <a name="FNanchor_1_111" id=
"FNanchor_1_111"></a><a href="#fn1_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a> on the mother-country, but was a source of
injury because they caused expense and were likely to lead to
wars with foreign powers. <a name="FNanchor_1_112" id=
"FNanchor_1_112"></a><a href="#fn1_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a> "We defy anyone," wrote McCulloch, "to point
out a single benefit, of any sort whatever, derived by us from
the possession of Canada, and our other colonies in North
America. They are productive of heavy expense to Great Britain,
but of nothing else." Colonies "have the farther disadvantage of
multiplying the chances of misunderstanding and contests with
foreign powers, and of making a vast addition to the expense of
war." <a name="FNanchor_1_113" id="FNanchor_1_113"></a><a href=
"#fn1_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The only really profitable
advantage which could be gained by the mother-country from the
possession of colonies was that of commerce, which would remain,
and even, as the history of the United States showed, increase
when the colony became independent. <a name="FNanchor_1_114" id=
"FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#fn1_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a> The economists, therefore, called upon the
mother-country to abandon the colonies peacefully before the
colonists took the initiative and separated on hostile terms.
<a name="FNanchor_1_115" id="FNanchor_1_115"></a><a href=
"#fn1_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
<p>The influence of the followers of Bentham, led by James Mill,
was thrown into the same scale. In 1792 Bentham urged on the
French the necessity of setting their colonies free, <a name=
"FNanchor_1_116" id="FNanchor_1_116"></a><a href="#fn1_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and the same advice he was prepared to
give to the Spanish in 1826. <a name="FNanchor_1_117" id=
"FNanchor_1_117"></a><a href="#fn1_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a> James Mill, too, fully agreed with his
fellow economists that colonial monopoly was an evil, and that
the political connection brought with it no commercial advantage.
<a name="FNanchor_1_118" id="FNanchor_1_118"></a><a href=
"#fn1_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> If the trade of the colony
were free," he wrote, "other nations would derive as much
advantage from it as the mother country; and the mother country
would derive as much advantage from it, if the colony were not a
colony." <a name="FNanchor_1_119" id=
"FNanchor_1_119"></a><a href="#fn1_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> The <i>Westminster Review</i>, as late as
1830, went even further in writing of the "colonial dominion
which has ever been the bane and curse of the people of this
country." <a name="FNanchor_1_120" id=
"FNanchor_1_120"></a><a href="#fn1_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a> In the opinion of the Benthamites a colony
was, if anything, a better customer when free than when
dependent, <a name="FNanchor_1_121" id=
"FNanchor_1_121"></a><a href="#fn1_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a> while the expense entailed on the
mother-country by the colonial civil and military establishments
outweighed any possible benefit. <a name="FNanchor_1_122" id=
"FNanchor_1_122"></a><a href="#fn1_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> Moreover, to them colonies were not only
causes of war, <a name="FNanchor_1_123" id=
"FNanchor_1_123"></a><a href="#fn1_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a> but specially objectionable as a means of
producing and prolonging bad government. Colonial government gave
great opportunity both for patronage and corruption. In their
formula the interests of the few were ascendant over the
interests of the many, and colonies were retained in the
interests of the few. "There is not one of the colonies," wrote
James Mill, "but what augments the number of places." <a name=
"FNanchor_1_124" id="FNanchor_1_124"></a><a href="#fn1_124"
class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>
<p>Practically all the economic and sociological writers of that
decade in England, whether followers of Bentham or not, were
convinced that whatever the value of colonies, and whatever their
disadvantages, the time was not far off when separation would
inevitably arrive. <a name="FNanchor_1_125" id=
"FNanchor_1_125"></a><a href="#fn1_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a> They would have subscribed willingly to
Turgot's dictum that "Colonies are like fruits which cling to the
tree only until they ripen." Since separation was bound to come
and might, if Britain were blind to her true interest, be
hostile, they, with the warning of the American Revolution before
their eyes, taught that she should take the initiative and
abandon her colonies.</p>
<p>It is not easy to determine what was the general English
attitude towards the colonies in the twelve years which followed
1830. Some of those who wrote then in favour of colonies felt
that opinion was so strongly against them that it was necessary
to show cause why the colonies should be retained. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_126" id="FNanchor_1_126"></a><a href="#fn1_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>
<p>Gibbon Wakefield and his associates, whose work in
colonization reform began in 1829, constantly complained that
their efforts were met, not so much by opposition, but by
indifference, and that it was distasteful to the general public
to consider projects either for founding new colonies, or for
improving the conditions of old colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_127" id="FNanchor_1_127"></a><a href="#fn1_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p>Wilmot Horton, too, who conducted a vigorous crusade for
pauper emigration to Canada in the years preceding 1830,
complained of chilling neglect. <a name="FNanchor_1_128" id=
"FNanchor_1_128"></a><a href="#fn1_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> When, in 1831, Joseph Hume proposed to
introduce into the Reform Bill provision for colonial
representation, giving members to Mauritius, the Cape, Malta,
Australia, and some other colonies, the House of Commons was
moved to laughter. <a name="FNanchor_1_129" id=
"FNanchor_1_129"></a><a href="#fn1_129" class=
"fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Spectator</i> remarked in 1836 that the British
Parliament did not trouble about colonies except where the
question of slavery arose, or when a colony like Canada was ripe
for rebellion. <a name="FNanchor_1_130" id=
"FNanchor_1_130"></a><a href="#fn1_130" class=
"fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
<p>Lord Stanley, speaking in 1834 on Roebuck's motion for a
Select Committee to inquire into the political position of the
Canadas, said that "he trusted the House would bear with him,
though he was aware how difficult it was to command its attention
on such a matter." <a name="FNanchor_1_131" id=
"FNanchor_1_131"></a><a href="#fn1_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a> It was not a rare thing for the House to be
counted out on the occasion of a colonial debate, <a name=
"FNanchor_1_132" id="FNanchor_1_132"></a><a href="#fn1_132"
class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and scanty attendances were the rule.
<a name="FNanchor_1_133" id="FNanchor_1_133"></a><a href=
"#fn1_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It was said with some show
of truth that "any party would rather lose a colony than a
division." <a name="FNanchor_1_134" id=
"FNanchor_1_134"></a><a href="#fn1_134" class=
"fnanchor">[134]</a> Charles Greville's explanation why Charles
Buller was not better known was that "his greatest speeches were
on dry and serious subjects, such as colonization, emigration or
records." <a name="FNanchor_1_135" id=
"FNanchor_1_135"></a><a href="#fn1_135" class=
"fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
<p>A most important change in the land system of the Australian
colonies in 1831 was received by the Press in silence. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_136" id="FNanchor_1_136"></a><a href="#fn1_136"
class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>
<p>It may be that, in calling attention to the public
indifference which they met, Wakefield and his associates were
not unmindful that they were throwing into bold relief their own
achievements in colonization; but, on the whole, it seems fairly
clear that the general attitude of the British public was one of
spasmodic interest. One colonial policy, that of
separation&mdash;at its best purely negative&mdash;was still
boldly advanced by the economists who had represented the only
definite body of thought relating to colonies; and while, here
and there, voices were raised against separation, <a name=
"FNanchor_1_137" id="FNanchor_1_137"></a><a href="#fn1_137"
class="fnanchor">[137]</a> there were no others who had any
reasoned policy of colonization or any well thought out attitude
towards colonies. Moreover, when the subject did arise, the state
of the colonies was likely to cause misgiving, especially when,
to their expense, was added the circumstances, in the various
colonies, of slavery, transportation, and racial and political
strife. The general attitude of the British public towards
colonies, then, in 1830, may be described as one of indifference
tempered by uneasiness.</p>

<h4>Chapter II</h4>
<h3>WILMOT HORTON AND PAUPER LOCATION IN CANADA</h3>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the years which followed the peace
of 1815, the population of Great Britain increased rapidly. The
first accurate census appeared in 1801 and the subsequent
decennial returns furnished a basis for calculating the rate of
increase. The population of England, Wales, and Scotland was
12,596,803 in 1811; 14,391,631 in 1821; and 16,539,318 in
1831&mdash;an increase in each case of about 15 per cent. Between
1821 and 1831 the total population of Great Britain and Ireland
rose in numbers from 21,193,458 to 24,304,799. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_1" id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#fn2_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p>After 1815 alarm began to be felt at this rapid growth, and
population which had been looked upon as the strength of the
nation was coming to be considered its curse. With the end of the
war, too, there was an increasing amount of pauperism and
distress. The large public debt, the cessation of war expenditure
and the natural reaction after the war, together with two
successive bad harvests, dislocated trade and industry, and threw
numbers out of employment. The expenditure on poor relief in 1801
amounted to £4,017,871, or 9s. 1d. per head in England and Wales,
and in 1831 to £6,798,838, or 9s. 9d. per head." <a name=
"FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#fn2_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> Porter calculated that "the weight of pauper
expenditure, in proportion to the population at the two periods
was as seven in 1831 to four in 1801." <a name="FNanchor_2_3" id=
"FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#fn2_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>Malthus had in 1797, and again in 1803, called attention to
the fact that population, unless checked, tended to increase
faster than the means of subsistence. The census returns appeared
to verify his conclusions, and his doctrines grew in popularity
until they dominated the minds of economists and statesmen
haunted by the spectre of over-population. <a name="FNanchor_2_4"
id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#fn2_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p>In these circumstances the "condition of England question," as
Carlyle called it, pressed for a solution. Remedies were sought
both for the relief of pauperism and distress, and for lessening
the "pressure of population upon the means of subsistence." Among
these one resource, which found much support, was emigration. In
the eighteenth century no one had talked of a surplus population.
Population meant national strength, and emigration was not
encouraged. There was "no surer way to condemn a colony than to
show that it tended to diminish the population of the
mother-country." <a name="FNanchor_2_5" id=
"FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#fn2_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But
in the early nineteenth century the removal of the redundant
population to the colonies and elsewhere was urged as a means of
relieving paupers, of reducing the poor rate, and of lessening
the supply of an overstocked labour market.</p>
<p>James Mill's article on "Colonization" in the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> in 1822 was a Malthusian essay on population, an
economic argument against the monopoly of colonial trade, and a
denunciation of the government of the "many" in the interests of
the "few," rather than an account of the principles and practice
of colonization. He gave a cautious adherence to emigration as a
remedy for over-population, recommending it on two conditions:
first, that the land colonized yielded a better return to labour
than that left by the emigrant; secondly, that the expense of
removing emigrants was not so great as to cause more loss by the
expenditure of capital than was gained by the diminution of
numbers.</p>
<p>Among the most zealous advocates of emigration was Robert John
Wilmot Horton, <a name="FNanchor_2_6" id=
"FNanchor_2_6"></a><a href="#fn2_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who
had entered the House of Commons in 1814. In 1822 <a name=
"FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#fn2_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> he became Under-Secretary of State for War and
the Colonies, when he immediately associated himself with
colonial questions, particularly in relation to Canada and to
emigration. It was he who, in 1822, introduced into the House of
Commons the abortive Bill for the Union of the Canadas which was
so vigorously opposed in the Lower Province. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#fn2_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> Though possessed of little ability, he was a
man of great energy and perseverance, <a name="FNanchor_2_9" id=
"FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#fn2_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
he was doomed to spend seven or eight years&mdash;from 1823 to
1830&mdash;in urging on the British public a scheme of emigration
which had many obvious defects and received some official but
little popular support. Speaking, in 1858, of colonization and
emigration in 1826, James Stephen said: "They who participate
with me in the melancholy advantage of being able to remember the
progress of public events so long as thirty-two years ago, will
call to mind how, at that time, Mr. Wilmot Horton (the
pleasantest of companions and the most restless of politicians)
wedded himself to that great cause; how enthusiastic was the
garrulity of those espousals, and how they gave birth to a
progeny of reviews and articles and reports and books and
pamphlets either fugitive or motionless, without number and
without end." <a name="FNanchor_2_10" id=
"FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#fn2_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p>In his examination of the conditions of the labouring
population of Great Britain, Wilmot Horton found a state of
pauperism and distress, which, as a follower of Malthus, he
ascribed to the fact that population was redundant. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_11" id="FNanchor_2_11"></a><a href="#fn2_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a> Labour, he maintained, was merely a
commodity, bought and sold in the market, and subject like every
other commodity to fluctuations in value. <a name="FNanchor_2_12"
id="FNanchor_2_12"></a><a href="#fn2_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a> The price of labour was governed by the same
laws that governed the prices or other commodities. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#fn2_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a> "No one would deny," he told the House of
Commons in 1827, "that the principle which regulated the price of
commodities also regulated the price of the labour of those who
produced them; and that, whenever the supply became in either
case in excess, as compared with the demand, the price must sink
until the market was cleared of that proportion of the article,
whether a commodity or labour, which was really in excess."
<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#fn2_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Wages, then, depended on the proportion
which capital bore to labour. <a name="FNanchor_2_15" id=
"FNanchor_2_15"></a><a href="#fn2_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
With labour in excess came depreciation, a consequent fall in
wages, and unemployment. While to the labourers this
"inconvenient excess of population" <a name="FNanchor_2_16" id=
"FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#fn2_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
meant, he considered, destitution; to the rest of the community
it meant a large and increasing expenditure in maintaining an
army of non-producers. <a name="FNanchor_2_17" id=
"FNanchor_2_17"></a><a href="#fn2_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The problem and its solution he stated in these terms: low wages
were the cause of pauperism; redundancy of population the cause
of low wages. The remedy, then, was to raise wages by readjusting
the proportion between capital and labour. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#fn2_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> This could be done either by increasing the
relative amount of capital, or by decreasing the amount of
labour. To increase the supply of capital in its relation to
labour was, he thought, a practical impossibility, so that the
removal of labour by emigration was the only feasible way of
raising wages. <a name="FNanchor_2_19" id=
"FNanchor_2_19"></a><a href="#fn2_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
"If, therefore, the market could by any means, such as
emigration, be cleared of those hands which were at the present
moment superabundant, it followed that the remainder would find
the wages of labour increased to such an amount as would afford
them an adequate remuneration." <a name="FNanchor_2_20" id=
"FNanchor_2_20"></a><a href="#fn2_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
For Ireland additional measures were necessary, because in that
country the evil of redundancy was intensified by the great
number of small landholders who were living in a state of extreme
poverty, and fast increasing their numbers. He suggested not only
that the surplus pauper population should be removed, but also
that the small holdings should be thrown together so that it
might be profitable to employ English capital in Irish
agriculture. <a name="FNanchor_2_21" id=
"FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href="#fn2_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p>The one question of theory which he regarded as doubtful was
whether the "vacuum" caused by emigration would not as quickly be
filled again by an increase of population at home, which would
cause wages to fall once more. Indeed, although he suggested some
precautionary measures, he feared that all the evils of
redundancy would set in again, but not before the cost of
emigration was more than covered by the economy of sending
paupers abroad instead of keeping them in idleness at home.
<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#fn2_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a> At the worst the ratepayers were no
more heavily burdened, while many paupers would be better
off.</p>
<p>Looking merely at the advantages which would result to Great
Britain from the removal of her superfluous labourers, this plan
would be equally efficacious whether the emigrants went to a
British colony or to another country; but the interests of the
whole empire, he thought, demanded that the colonies should have
the advantage of this stream of emigration. In this respect he
strongly opposed the eminent economist, J. R. McCulloch, who,
though inclined to accept his plan, thought it immaterial whether
paupers were sent to Canada or to any other country which had
commercial relations with England. <a name="FNanchor_2_23" id=
"FNanchor_2_23"></a><a href="#fn2_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
In 1822 Wilmot Horton saw that the colonies were suffering for
want of labour, and that they needed something more than the
natural increase of population if they were to prosper. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_24" id="FNanchor_2_24"></a><a href="#fn2_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a> Viewing the matter in this light he stated
the problem to be that of "making the redundant labour and the
curse of the mother-country, the active labour and the blessing
of the colonies." <a name="FNanchor_2_25" id=
"FNanchor_2_25"></a><a href="#fn2_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
In emigration the interests of the two were reciprocal, for the
colony would relieve the mother-country of her labourers, and by
their aid would increase in wealth and provide a market for
British manufactures. <a name="FNanchor_2_26" id=
"FNanchor_2_26"></a><a href="#fn2_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Horton was no advocate of discontinuing colonial establishments.
The prospective increase of population in Canada would, he
thought, prevent those colonies from becoming part of the United
States. <a name="FNanchor_2_27" id="FNanchor_2_27"></a><a href=
"#fn2_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Indeed, his reason for
returning to the fray of controversy in 1839, after an absence of
seven years, was to urge the necessity for adopting an enlarged
system of colonization in order to strengthen the connection
between Great Britain and her American colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_28" id="FNanchor_2_28"></a><a href="#fn2_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<p>Colonization, however, was to him not an end in itself, but
merely a means of ridding Great Britain of her redundant
population. He wrote not on colonization, but on the causes and
remedies of pauperism. "Colonization abroad," he wrote to Poulett
Thomson in 1830, "as a remedy for the evils of a relatively
redundant population is, and has been, with me, only a
subordinate object of inquiry. I consider it only as the best and
cheapest mode of disposing of that <i>Abstraction</i> of
superfluous labouring population from the general labour market,
which I contend to be the <i>Main Remedy</i> for the distressed
condition of the labouring classes of the United Kingdom."
<a name="FNanchor_2_29" id="FNanchor_2_29"></a><a href="#fn2_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Could he have discovered a better means
he would not have advocated colonization. "If it can be shown
that the superfluous population so abstracted can be disposed of
more economically and more advantageously at home than abroad, I
shall never be found to press for a moment the remedy of colonial
emigration." <a name="FNanchor_2_30" id=
"FNanchor_2_30"></a><a href="#fn2_30" class=
"fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p>Wilmot Horton's plan was to have a state-controlled and a
state-aided emigration. <a name="FNanchor_2_31" id=
"FNanchor_2_31"></a><a href="#fn2_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p>In the first place those paupers who wished to emigrate were
to be provided by the Government with a free passage to Canada,
and a free grant of 100 <a name="FNanchor_2_32" id=
"FNanchor_2_32"></a><a href="#fn2_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
acres of land there, subject to conditions of cultivation. After
five years a small quit-rent of 2d. per acre was to be imposed,
and the proceeds were to be applied to local purposes, such as
improving the means of communication. The emigrants were also to
be provided with farming implements, stock, and a sufficient
supply of provisions to last them for one year.</p>
<p>The scheme was confined to paupers. Only those "entirely
destitute of all means of subsistence" <a name="FNanchor_2_33"
id="FNanchor_2_33"></a><a href="#fn2_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a> were to be sent. The emigrants and their
children were to forfeit all claims upon parochial support. But
there was to be no compulsion on anyone to emigrate. Only those
who "ardently desired" <a name="FNanchor_2_34" id=
"FNanchor_2_34"></a><a href="#fn2_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
to go were to be taken. He thought that paupers would be
attracted by the prospect which a new country offered them of
escaping from their unhappy situation at home. "It is considered
as unquestionable, although this measure is not in the slightest
degree compulsory, that the poor man who offers his strength and
energy as a labourer, but who, finding no demand, or at least no
adequate demand for his services, is compelled to receive "parish
relief" for the preservation of his own existence and that of his
family, will accept this opportunity of bettering his condition,
by laying the foundation for future independence, with eagerness
and gratitude; when sufficient time has elapsed, and proper pains
been taken to make him understand the true nature and character
of the change that is proposed for him." <a name="FNanchor_2_35"
id="FNanchor_2_35"></a><a href="#fn2_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p>Wilmot Horton always insisted on the importance of that part
of his scheme which related to settling the emigrants on the land
and making provision for them after their arrival. He
distinguished between this plan and the unsystematic and
unregulated emigration which was at that time going on from the
British Isles to Canada; between "emigration where the
individuals were fixed to the soil, and that desultory kind of
emigration which consisted in merely conveying them to a certain
place and then leaving them to make their way as they could."
<a name="FNanchor_2_36" id="FNanchor_2_36"></a><a href="#fn2_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Emigrants, he thought, should not be
treated merely as prospective labourers. It was a mistaken notion
that "emigration should be conducted on the principle of
supplying labourers only to the colonies&mdash;that the expense
should be limited to the carrying of the emigrants out, and
landing them on the shores to be disposed of as chance or
circumstances might direct." <a name="FNanchor_2_37" id=
"FNanchor_2_37"></a><a href="#fn2_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
In his view such emigration, while it might serve the purpose
merely of getting rid of a redundant population yet exposed the
emigrants to worse evils; <a name="FNanchor_2_38" id=
"FNanchor_2_38"></a><a href="#fn2_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
for, as was the fact then and afterwards, labouring emigrants to
Canada, before they could reach the places where work might be
found, suffered great hardships, <a name="FNanchor_2_39" id=
"FNanchor_2_39"></a><a href="#fn2_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and were passing over in large numbers to the United States.
<a name="FNanchor_2_40" id="FNanchor_2_40"></a><a href="#fn2_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Under his scheme the pauper emigrant
was to be established at once as a landholder and a prospective
employer of labour. <a name="FNanchor_2_41" id=
"FNanchor_2_41"></a><a href="#fn2_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
"The settler would be firmly fixed in the soil, instead of taking
his chance of obtaining subsistence: instead of being like a
plant thrown down upon the earth, either to take root, or to be
withered by the sun, he would be like a young and vigorous tree
set by a careful hand, with all the advantages of soil and
climate." <a name="FNanchor_2_42" id="FNanchor_2_42"></a><a href=
"#fn2_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
<p>In the second place, for the expenses of emigration, the
Government, which was to manage the undertaking, was to advance
money by way of loan to the parishes on the security of the poor
rate, which was to be mortgaged for the purpose. The sum advanced
by the Government would, then, be repaid by the parish by means
of a terminable annuity. His earliest proposal, in 1823, did not
contemplate any repayment by the emigrants of the cost of their
location. Later, however, he suggested that they should bear
part, <a name="FNanchor_2_43" id="FNanchor_2_43"></a><a href=
"#fn2_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and the principle or
repayment was strongly recommended by the Select Committee on
Emigration in 1827. <a name="FNanchor_2_44" id=
"FNanchor_2_44"></a><a href="#fn2_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Still later he recurred to his former plan, and abandoned the
principle of repayment on the grounds that it would be unpopular
in the colonies and with the emigrants themselves, and that the
expense incurred in emigration was a small price for the parish
to pay compared with the cost of maintaining those emigrants as
paupers at home. <a name="FNanchor_2_45" id=
"FNanchor_2_45"></a><a href="#fn2_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Indeed, the chief argument which he brought forward in support of
this part of his plan was that parishes would, by emigrating
their paupers to Canada, save considerably by the resulting
diminution in the amount of poor relief which they would need to
dispense. The redundant pauper, unable to procure employment,
however able to work, was a tax upon the community, and his
removal could be carried out at such a cost as to relieve the
community from this burden, without incurring so much expense as
was necessary to maintain him at home. <a name="FNanchor_2_46"
id="FNanchor_2_46"></a><a href="#fn2_46" class=
"fnanchor">[46]</a> Wilmot Horton calculated what would be the
annual charge on the parish necessary to repay the expenses of
emigration, and he compared it with the actual annual cost to the
parish of supporting those emigrants at home. The capital sum
necessary to settle a family of four in Canada according to his
plan he estimated at about £80, <a name="FNanchor_2_47" id=
"FNanchor_2_47"></a><a href="#fn2_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
while the annual cost of maintaining that family as paupers at
home was about £10 per head. <a name="FNanchor_2_48" id=
"FNanchor_2_48"></a><a href="#fn2_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The annual charge which would repay the sum of £80 was very much
less than £40, and the difference was so much clear gain to the
parish and to the community.</p>
<p>This plan of loan and mortgage of the poor rate was, as it
stood, not applicable to Scotland or Ireland, but there would be
little difficulty in applying it, he thought, if a fund could be
raised as security for the loan, either by public or private
subscription in those countries. <a name="FNanchor_2_49" id=
"FNanchor_2_49"></a><a href="#fn2_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
He believed that landlords there would find it to their interest
to pay the expenses of an emigration which would remove their
surplus tenantry and enable them to throw small holdings together
and carry on agriculture on a larger scale.</p>
<p>While the parish and private employer gained in this way by
emigration, the pauper became in Canada a happy and prosperous
independent proprietor. Emigration would mean for him the
"transmutation of pauperism into comparative prosperity,"
<a name="FNanchor_2_50" id="FNanchor_2_50"></a><a href="#fn2_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and, for his fellow-paupers at home,
more and better-paid employment. This process, beneficial alike
to mother-country and colony, might, he believed, go on
indefinitely with advantage to all concerned.</p>
<p>"It must not be forgotten, in a comprehensive view of such a
system, that the pauper, for whose labour no remuneration can be
afforded at home, will be transmuted by this process into an
independent proprietor, and at no distant period will become a
consumer of the manufactured articles of his native country. Nor,
on the other hand, can any calculable period be assigned for the
termination of such a system, until all the colonies of the
British empire are saturated, and millions added to those who
speak the English language, and carry with them the liberty and
the laws and the sympathies of their native country.</p>
<p>"Such a system would direct the tide of emigration towards
parts of the British empire, which must be considered as
integral, though separated by geographical position. The defence
or these colonial possessions would be more easily supplied
within themselves, and their increasing prosperity would not only
relieve the mother-country from pecuniary demands that are now
indispensable, but that prosperity in its reaction would augment
the wealth and the resources of the mother-country itself."
<a name="FNanchor_2_51" id="FNanchor_2_51"></a><a href="#fn2_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
<p>Throughout the discussion which these plans evoked, Wilmot
Horton and every one else seems to have looked upon the problem
under consideration as one concerning a large mass of individuals
whom they lumped together under the name of paupers. There was no
appreciation of the fact that one pauper might differ essentially
from another, that one might be a competent but unfortunate
labourer, while another might be an incapable who had broken down
hopelessly in the struggle for existence. From all that was said
and written it might have been thought that the receipt of parish
relief made its recipients resemble one another in all respects.
Wilmot Horton wrote as if paupers were a homogeneous class, and
they were anything but that. No doubt many of them were out of
work agricultural labourers, but there were also many who had
come by various roads of inefficiency to the dead end of parish
relief.</p>
<p>Nor was there any consideration of the question whether the
actual individuals whom it was proposed to send out were
qualified to earn their living in a new country. The problem of
dealing with paupers was stated in abstract terms such as "excess
of population," "demand and supply of labour," and "surplus
labour," as if unemployed labourers necessarily resembled one
another in anything else but unemployment. It shows a curious
difference from modern ways of thought, for one of the first
questions which would arise now in such a scheme of emigration
would be "What kind of people is it proposed to send out, and
what are they capable of doing in a new country?" It was
impossible for such a scheme as this, depending so largely on the
success of the emigrants in agriculture, to succeed without a
careful examination of, and discrimination between, the various
types of paupers with a view to selecting those only who would be
suitable to the conditions of a new country. Wakefield, indeed,
was the only critic who pointed this out when he showed that the
type of emigrants sent out under this system was unsuitable.</p>
<p>In 1823, and again in 1825, attempts were made on a small
scale to put Wilmot Horton's plan into practice. In each case a
grant of money was made by Parliament&mdash;£15,000 in 1823,
<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href="#fn2_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and £30,000 in 1825, <a name=
"FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53"></a><a href="#fn2_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a> for the purpose of settling paupers in
Canada. There had been some earlier grants for emigration both to
Canada and to the Cape of Good Hope. In 1819 £50,000 was voted
for emigration to the Cape, and in 1821 £68,760 for emigration
from the south of Ireland to Canada and the Cape. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_54" id="FNanchor_2_54"></a><a href="#fn2_54" class=
"fnanchor">[54]</a> But the grants of 1823 and 1825 differed from
these in that they were advisedly made to carry out experiments
on the lines advocated by Wilmot Horton. The settlements which
were established by these means were attempts to discover whether
paupers might be located in Canada at a less cost than was
necessary for their maintenance at home; and the object of the
Government was "to show, by a few trials, to those who might be
interested in forwarding such a system, and in removing a
redundant population, the ease with which it might be carried
into effect, and the good consequences resulting from it."
<a name="FNanchor_2_55" id="FNanchor_2_55"></a><a href="#fn2_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The settlements were made only upon a
small scale, and were intended to test the practicability of
removing population rather than to cure any existing redundancy.
The experiment of 1823 was carried out "not from any expectation
that the small emigration which then took place could produce any
sensible effect upon the superabundant population of the south of
Ireland, but merely for the sake of having before them the effect
of an experiment tried upon a small scale, before they ventured
upon a plan of emigration upon a large one." <a name=
"FNanchor_2_56" id="FNanchor_2_56"></a><a href="#fn2_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p>The grant of 1823 was devoted partly to emigration to Canada,
and partly to emigration to the Cape. By its means 350 labourers
were sent out to the Cape at the Government's expense to meet the
demand there for labour. They were not located on the land, nor
were they furnished after their arrival with provisions or stock.
"This emigration," said Wilmot Horton in 1823, "evidently has not
the least of the character of the emigration to Canada, being
founded merely on the demand for labourers at the Cape." <a name=
"FNanchor_2_57" id="FNanchor_2_57"></a><a href="#fn2_57" class=
"fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
<p>But the greater part of the grant was spent in sending 571
pauper emigrants <a name="FNanchor_2_58" id=
"FNanchor_2_58"></a><a href="#fn2_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
from the south of Ireland to Canada, under the charge of Mr.
Peter Robinson, and in settling them on grants of land. In
accordance with Wilmot Horton's plan the emigrants received a
free passage, provisions for one year, farming implements, and
stock; while to each head of a family was given seventy acres of
land, subject, after five years, to a quit-rent of 2d. per acre.
By paying an amount equal to twenty years' purchase of the
quit-rent the freehold of the land might be obtained at any time.
<a name="FNanchor_2_59" id="FNanchor_2_59"></a><a href="#fn2_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p>The Select Committee on the Condition of the Labouring Poor in
Ireland, which sat in 1823, after examining into the particulars
of this experiment, expressed their approbation of the principles
on which it had been conducted and their hope that it might lead
to satisfactory results. <a name="FNanchor_2_60" id=
"FNanchor_2_60"></a><a href="#fn2_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
After this recommendation, and the reports as to the success of
the settlement, another grant of £30,000 was made in 1825, which
was expended altogether on pauper location in Canada. The expense
of the experiment of 1823 had been about £22 per head, <a name=
"FNanchor_2_61" id="FNanchor_2_61"></a><a href="#fn2_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a> and it was calculated that the grant would be
sufficient for the location of 1,500 people. Actually 2,024 were
sent, and the additional expense was met by another grant of
£20,480 in 1827, of which, however, half was to be spent in
making thhe necessary surveys and inquiries in Canada before any
large body of emigrants could be introduced. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#fn2_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a> These paupers were settled in Canada on the
same terms as those of 1823, but at the slightly less cost of £20
per head. <a name="FNanchor_2_63" id="FNanchor_2_63"></a><a href=
"#fn2_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p>The evidence as to the success of these experiments is
conflicting. Wilmot Horton always claimed that they had been
entirely successful, and brought a good many opinions of
independent observers in support of his contention. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_64" id="FNanchor_2_64"></a><a href="#fn2_64" class=
"fnanchor">[64]</a> Indeed, those who saw the settlements in
their first few years were, with the exception of Lieut.-Colonel
Cockburn, <a name="FNanchor_2_65" id="FNanchor_2_65"></a><a href=
"#fn2_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of this opinion. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_66" id="FNanchor_2_66"></a><a href="#fn2_66" class=
"fnanchor">[66]</a> Although on Wilmot Horton's own showing the
mortality amongst them was 25 per 1,000, <a name="FNanchor_2_67"
id="FNanchor_2_67"></a><a href="#fn2_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a> yet the majority of the emigrants did greatly
improve their condition. The Emigration Commissioners of 1832
found that "the result, so far as the happiness of the settlers
is concerned, has been most gratifying." <a name="FNanchor_2_68"
id="FNanchor_2_68"></a><a href="#fn2_68" class=
"fnanchor">[68]</a> But as experiments in settling paupers on the
land, the schemes were failures; for the conditions were rarely
fulfilled, and the grants in many cases abandoned. In 1843 Lord
Stanley complained that, of the loans necessary to establish
these settlements, "not a single shilling had ever been
recovered." <a name="FNanchor_2_69" id=
"FNanchor_2_69"></a><a href="#fn2_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
But this was not a fair test of success, for it was never
intended that the expenses of settlement should be repaid. "The
experiments of 1823 and 1825 were carried on by money absolutely
voted by Parliament, without any view to repayment; they were
instituted for the purpose of trying whether the details would
succeed in practice, not for the purpose of considering the
question whether it would be expedient, either to lend money upon
security, or to vote it in large sums, as a national experiment."
<a name="FNanchor_2_70" id="FNanchor_2_70"></a><a href="#fn2_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> A better test is round in the fact
that, when five years had elapsed and the quit-rent began, many
settlers left for the United States, while, of those who
remained, many refused to pay rent, and few fulfilled the
conditions on which they were to obtain their freeholds. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_71" id="FNanchor_2_71"></a><a href="#fn2_71" class=
"fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
<p>In addition to obtaining these grants for experimental
purposes, Wilmot Horton's activity caused two Select Committees
of the House of Commons to be appointed to consider the subject
of emigration. The first Committee sat in 1826, the second in
1827, and of both he was Chairman.</p>
<p>The Committee of 1826 in its Report <a name="FNanchor_2_72"
id="FNanchor_2_72"></a><a href="#fn2_72" class=
"fnanchor">[72]</a> considered that the evidence before it had
established the fact "that there are extensive districts in
Ireland, and districts in England and Scotland, where the
population is at the present moment redundant; in other words,
where there exists a very considerable proportion of able-bodied
and active labourers, beyond that number to which any existing
demand for labour can afford employment." This led to destitution
and misery, and a reduction of wages so great that in England the
parochial rate threatened to absorb the whole rental of the
country. In the next place the Committee found that the British
colonies were capable of absorbing any proportion of the
redundant population which might be sent to them. The national
wealth would be greatly increased by the emigration of unemployed
labourers, who, at home, consumed more than they produced, but in
a new country would produce more than they consumed. They
therefore recommended emigration "as one obvious and immediate
measure for correcting in some degree this redundancy of
population, and for mitigating the numerous evils which appear to
result from its existence." They did not, however, suggest any
particular scheme of emigration, but contented themselves with
laying down the principles according to which it should be
conducted. First, it should be voluntary; next, it should only
apply to permanent pauperism; lastly, any expense incurred by the
Government should be ultimately repaid, <i>e.g</i>., by emigrants
or out of the poor rate.</p>
<p>The Committee of 1827 supported and confirmed without
exception the findings and principles of the 1826 Committee.
<a name="FNanchor_2_73" id="FNanchor_2_73"></a><a href="#fn2_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> They recommended emigration from
Ireland and England in order to remedy redundancy, to save the
cost of maintaining paupers at home, and to increase the general
prosperity of the empire. "Emigration appears to your Committee
to be a remedy well worth consideration, whether with reference
to the improved condition of the population at home, and the
saving of that expense which as it appears to your Committee is
now incurred in maintaining a portion of them, or with respect to
the prosperity of our colonies." They went somewhat farther than
the earlier Committee in proposing that emigration should be
financed by a loan to be repaid gradually by the emigrant, and
that a Board of Emigration should be formed under the direct
control of the Government. On two grounds they justified their
proposals: "First, the real saving effected at home by the
removal of pauper labourers, executing no real functions as
labourers, and not contributing to the annual production;
secondly, the probability of direct though progressive repayment
from those labourers, when placed as emigrants in the colonies;
and the indirect consequence of the increased demands for British
manufactures involved in the circumstance of an increasing
colonial population."</p>
<p>Fully convinced that his experiments of 1823 and 1825 had
successfully demonstrated the economic advantage of emigration
over home maintenance of paupers, and fortified by the reports of
the Emigration Committees, Wilmot Horton proceeded to bring
forward a scheme for emigration on a scale large enough to be a
real remedy for redundancy.</p>
<p>On April 17th, 1828, and again on March 23rd, 1830, he
introduced into the House of Commons a Bill "to enable parishes
to mortgage their poor rates for the purpose of providing for
their able-bodied paupers, by colonization in the British
Colonies." <a name="FNanchor_2_74" id=
"FNanchor_2_74"></a><a href="#fn2_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
As before, the Government was to advance the necessary money by
way of loan, and the poor rate was to be the security for
repayment. Emigration was to be voluntary, and the emigrants were
to be settled on the land and not merely sent out to provide
labour for the colonies. But he had left office in 1828, with
others of Huskisson's followers and, after some discussion,
mainly by opponents, the Bill did not reach a second reading.
<a name="FNanchor_2_75" id="FNanchor_2_75"></a><a href="#fn2_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
<p>On February 22nd, 1831, Lord Howick introduced a Bill into the
House of Commons which was to all intents and purposes Wilmot
Horton's Bill. <a name="FNanchor_2_76" id=
"FNanchor_2_76"></a><a href="#fn2_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
It provoked similar opposition, and in the troublous times of
1831 did not get as far as a second reading. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_77" id="FNanchor_2_77"></a><a href="#fn2_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> In the Poor Law Act of 1834, however, a
section was inserted, allowing parishes to mortgage their poor
rates for the purposes of emigration, <a name="FNanchor_2_78" id=
"FNanchor_2_78"></a><a href="#fn2_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
but this section remained a dead letter. <a name="FNanchor_2_79"
id="FNanchor_2_79"></a><a href="#fn2_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p>In 1831 Wilmot Horton was knighted and made Governor of
Ceylon, where he remained for seven years. On his return to
England he tried to revive interest in his schemes by the
publication of a pamphlet, Ireland and Canada, 1839, in which he
urged pauper emigration to Canada as a cure for the condition of
Ireland. But by that time the Wakefield theory held the field,
and some of his former supporters had gone over to the rival
camp, so that he was again unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Wilmot Horton's plan, though faulty in many respects, was
meant seriously as an attempt to solve the difficult problem of
pauperism in England, and to make the colonies more prosperous
and more useful to the mother-country. He met, however, not only
with opposition, but with a public indifference to colonization,
even considered as a means of solving this problem, which Gibbon
Wakefield afterwards was long unable to dispel. "Nothing," Wilmot
Horton wrote in 1839, "but the conviction I feel of the
imperative necessity at this moment for the adoption of vigorous
measures, could induce me again to brave the indifference, to use
the mildest term, with which the subject has been hitherto
received." <a name="FNanchor_2_80" id=
"FNanchor_2_80"></a><a href="#fn2_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
As a cure for an admitted redundancy of population, emigration
without reference to any particular scheme found considerable
support. <a name="FNanchor_2_81" id="FNanchor_2_81"></a><a href=
"#fn2_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In 1828 the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> stated that "the remedy is as obvious as the necessity
for having recourse to it is urgent." <a name="FNanchor_2_82" id=
"FNanchor_2_82"></a><a href="#fn2_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
In 1824 the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, arguing against restraints
on emigration, declared, "Whenever population is redundant and
the wages of labour depressed, every facility ought to be given
to emigration. Were it carried to a considerable extent, it would
have the effect, by lessening the supply of labour in the market,
to raise the rate of wages, and to improve the condition of the
labourers who remain at home." <a name="FNanchor_2_83" id=
"FNanchor_2_83"></a><a href="#fn2_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Again, in 1826, an article in this Review estimated the cost of
conveying one million emigrants to America, and establishing them
there, at about £14,000,000, and added, "We have no hesitation in
saying that, though it were <i>twice as great</i>, it would be
well and advantageously laid out in securing the object in view."
<a name="FNanchor_2_84" id="FNanchor_2_84"></a><a href="#fn2_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> But even to those who agreed with him
that emigration was a remedy for redundancy of population, his
plan was so obviously defective that he gained little support. "I
have never received," he wrote in 1830, "the assistance of any
party in Parliament, nor have I experienced the support of the
public Press." <a name="FNanchor_2_85" id=
"FNanchor_2_85"></a><a href="#fn2_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Those who were interested in bettering the condition of the
people found fault with his particular remedy. In the House of
Commons "the proposition of colonization was at once scouted as
theoretical, sneered at as visionary, and, above all, rejected as
expensive." <a name="FNanchor_2_86" id=
"FNanchor_2_86"></a><a href="#fn2_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
<p>The existence of destitution and unemployment, and the
consequent growth of pauperism was universally admitted, but it
was by no means universally agreed that redundancy of population
was the cause. There were many who accepted neither the
Malthusian formula nor the proposition that labour was then
redundant. <a name="FNanchor_2_87" id=
"FNanchor_2_87"></a><a href="#fn2_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
To them the problem was not how best to get rid of paupers. They
agreed as to the evil of pauperism, but, disbelieving in
redundancy, did not accept emigration as a remedy, but suggested
other alternatives, <i>e.g</i>., that of employing labourers in
colonizing the waste lands at home. <a name="FNanchor_2_88" id=
"FNanchor_2_88"></a><a href="#fn2_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
"The best colonies we could plant," said Michael Sadler, in 1831,
"either with a view to the present or permanent advantages of the
country, were those that might be planted on the deserts of our
European empire." <a name="FNanchor_2_89" id=
"FNanchor_2_89"></a><a href="#fn2_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
<p>William Cobbett, denying redundancy, and thinking population a
blessing and not a curse, strongly opposed Wilmot Horton's plan
as being one for sending poor people out of their native country.
<a name="FNanchor_2_90" id="FNanchor_2_90"></a><a href="#fn2_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a> To him the proposed Act of 1830 was "An
Act to refuse relief to all able-bodied persons who will not be
transported to the swamps and rocks and snows of Nova Scotia or
Canada." <a name="FNanchor_2_91" id="FNanchor_2_91"></a><a href=
"#fn2_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The mortgage of the poor rate
was an attempt to "pawn the whole of the land and houses of
England, in order to raise money to hire ships to carry the
working people out of the country." <a name="FNanchor_2_92" id=
"FNanchor_2_92"></a><a href="#fn2_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
There was, he considered, no redundancy either of population or
of labour, but only of taxation. <a name="FNanchor_2_93" id=
"FNanchor_2_93"></a><a href="#fn2_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
The cause of the distress was not surplus population, but bad
laws and heavy taxes, and his remedy was to remove these instead
of removing paupers. <a name="FNanchor_2_94" id=
"FNanchor_2_94"></a><a href="#fn2_94" class=
"fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>Two main objections were made to Wilmot Horton's plan by those
who were inclined to accept emigration as a remedy. First it was
argued that, no matter on what scale it was carried out, the
abstraction of population would leave a "vacuum" which would be
filled up immediately by the tendency of population to increase
beyond the means of subsistence. This would entail all the evils
of redundancy in an accentuated form, because the capital spent
in emigration would be abstracted from the fund necessary to
furnish employment at home. <a name="FNanchor_2_95" id=
"FNanchor_2_95"></a><a href="#fn2_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p>While this objection applied generally to any scheme of
emigration, the second objection on the score of expense applied
to Wilmot Horton's proposed means of carrying on emigration. The
main assumption upon which his scheme was based, namely, that it
was cheaper to locate paupers in Canada than to maintain them at
home, met with no general acceptance. In 1839 he wrote: "Now, up
to the present hour, notwithstanding an infinite variety of
publications, notwithstanding the lectures which I gave publicly
at the Mechanics' Institution, I have never been able to gain an
assent to the proposition 'that home maintenance of paupers is a
greater tax than the annuity necessary to repay the sum advanced
for colonization.' This proposition has been placed by me, as I
have already said, again and again, before the public; but except
from scientific persons, with whom I have placed myself in close
communication, I have never been able to obtain either from
Government, from Parliament, from the Reviews, or from the public
in general, anything like a satisfactory assent to a proposition
which appears to me to be incapable of being denied." <a name=
"FNanchor_2_96" id="FNanchor_2_96"></a><a href="#fn2_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a> The Emigration Commissioners of 1832, after
admitting the success of his experiments of 1823 and 1825, as far
as the happiness of the settlers was concerned, reported that "as
a means of relief to the mother-country, the expense of such
undertakings plainly rendered them unavailable, since, however
beneficial to the parties actually removed, the measure was far
too costly to be persevered in to any useful extent." <a name=
"FNanchor_2_97" id="FNanchor_2_97"></a><a href="#fn2_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a> Indeed, expense was the chief rock on which
his plan struck. The general feeling was that, although
emigration, if conducted without too great an outlay, might be
productive of great benefits to the emigrants and to the
community as a whole, yet it was dangerous to lend money upon the
security of repayment by emigrants. "If it can be clearly
demonstrated that the expenses of sending out emigrants in the
first instance can be repaid to the state, either by persons and
bodies of persons interested in getting rid of the redundant
portion of the population, or by the emigrants themselves, there
would be manifestly a national gain from emigration. The
condition of the emigrants themselves would be altered for the
better, and by their abstraction, some relief, although slight
and temporary, would be afforded to the rest of the population."
<a name="FNanchor_2_98" id="FNanchor_2_98"></a><a href="#fn2_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But it was feared that there was no
certainty of repayment by the emigrants, and this fear was
confirmed by experience. Nor was his plan of mortgaging the poor
rate to secure the loan any less dangerous. In it his opponents
saw "the commencement of a municipal national debt which is to
overwhelm the country." <a name="FNanchor_2_99" id=
"FNanchor_2_99"></a><a href="#fn2_99" class=
"fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, Wilmot Horton's plan carried within itself the seeds
of failure. It contemplated a certain and permanent charge for a
problematical future benefit. If the "vacuum" were to fill again,
the rates would be burdened with the maintenance of two large
classes of paupers, one at home, and one in the colonies. Even if
the vacuum did not fill, and industry increased with a smaller
population, the parish might find itself saddled with a debt
incurred for removing pauper labour which was now badly needed at
home. <a name="FNanchor_2_100" id="FNanchor_2_100"></a><a href=
"#fn2_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The pauper's condition was
not necessarily one of permanent destitution, but depended
largely on the fluctuations in the labour market, which might
easily improve and relieve the parish of the burden of his
maintenance. A signal proof of the validity of this objection
occurred in 1827. The Emigration Committee of that year, in view
of the distress then existing amongst English and Scottish
weavers, strongly recommended a grant of £50,000 from the
national funds "in furtherance of an emigration from the
manufacturing districts, at once as a relief from present
distress, and as an important national experiment for the
future." They based their recommendations upon "the urgency and
the peculiarity of the case," <a name="FNanchor_2_101" id=
"FNanchor_2_101"></a><a href="#fn2_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> but, before the end of the year, conditions
had so improved and the demand for labour so changed, that there
were no claimants for the benefit. <a name="FNanchor_2_102" id=
"FNanchor_2_102"></a><a href="#fn2_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
<p>Wilmot Horton's chief opponents, though from widely different
points of view, were Mr. Michael Sadler, and the advocates of
systematic colonization under the leadership of Edward Gibbon
Wakefield. The former was an uncompromising opponent of Malthus,
and wrote books to prove that the Malthusian "principle of
population" was wrong. <a name="FNanchor_2_103" id=
"FNanchor_2_103"></a><a href="#fn2_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a> In addition, he was a man of deeply
religious and humanitarian feeling, and this plan appeared to him
to be irreligious and unnatural in that it sinned against the
true law of population which was the law "of nature and of God."
<a name="FNanchor_2_104" id="FNanchor_2_104"></a><a href=
"#fn2_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Wakefield afterwards
complained of him as one of "those unreasoning men who would
determine questions in political economy by quoting scripture."
<a name="FNanchor_2_105" id="FNanchor_2_105"></a><a href=
"#fn2_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>
<p>Another objection he raised to emigration was that it drove
people from their native land. Getting rid of paupers in this way
amounted to making poverty a crime, and transportation its
punishment. In the House of Commons and elsewhere he strongly
attacked the plan, denying redundancy of population, advocating
home colonization and poor laws for Ireland, and pointing to the
mortality of the settlers of 1823 and 1825 as evidence of its
failure. <a name="FNanchor_2_106" id=
"FNanchor_2_106"></a><a href="#fn2_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
<p>But even this opposition excited little interest. Wakefield
wrote in 1849, "Twenty years ago colonization was in no respect a
subject of public opinion; the public neither knew nor cared
anything at all about it. There existed indeed at that time, a
controversy between Mr. Wilmot Horton and Mr. Michael Thomas
Sadler concerning emigration, which the infinite zeal of the
disputants forced into some public notice; but as the only
question between them was, whether, as Mr. Sadler contended,
paupers ought to 'dwell in the land' in order to be fed, or, as
Mr. Wilmot Horton proposed, be sent abroad out of the way, the
public took no real interest in the dispute. Still less did Mr.
Horton, notwithstanding his singular perseverance, excite a
general interest in his plans of mere pauper emigration."
<a name="FNanchor_2_107" id="FNanchor_2_107"></a><a href=
"#fn2_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Nor was Wilmot Horton under
any misapprehension as to his success. In 1830 he wrote, "I have
heard that men of high reputation have expressed their regret
'that I would continue to bore the House of Commons with my
absurd opinions.'" <a name="FNanchor_2_108" id=
"FNanchor_2_108"></a><a href="#fn2_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p>The advocates of systematic colonization always looked on
Wilmot Horton's plan by way contrast to their own. They objected
in the first place to the mother-country spending money on
emigration to the colonies when, by adopting their system of
sales of colonial waste land, a fund might easily be raised which
would give the same advantages without any expense to the
mother-country. <a name="FNanchor_2_109" id=
"FNanchor_2_109"></a><a href="#fn2_109" class=
"fnanchor">[109]</a> In the next place they objected to
mortgaging the poor rate, and creating a permanent charge for a
temporary relief. In their eyes not only was Wilmot Horton's plan
ruinously expensive, but it was inadequate to its purpose.
<a name="FNanchor_2_110" id="FNanchor_2_110"></a><a href=
"#fn2_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The experiments in "the
cruel art of pauper location" <a name="FNanchor_2_111" id=
"FNanchor_2_111"></a><a href="#fn2_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a> had failed because of their expense, and
because paupers were not suitable colonists. <a name=
"FNanchor_2_112" id="FNanchor_2_112"></a><a href="#fn2_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> "Though Mr. Horton rode his hobby so
as to induce Parliament to try on a small scale a costly and
deterrent experiment of his well-meant suggestions, he soon rode
it to death." <a name="FNanchor_2_113" id=
"FNanchor_2_113"></a><a href="#fn2_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a> They seized on the provisions depriving
emigrants of parochial support as a proof that the authors of the
plan expected failure. If the experiment were successful, they
argued, there was no need for the pauper to lose his settlement
as he would only return to the parish in case of failure.
<a name="FNanchor_2_114" id="FNanchor_2_114"></a><a href=
"#fn2_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In short, they considered
the plan "the most expensive and least effective" <a name=
"FNanchor_2_115" id="FNanchor_2_115"></a><a href="#fn2_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that could be devised. It was an
"irrational scheme&mdash;a mere shift in haste and alarm,
occasioned by the present truly alarming condition of the
peasantry." <a name="FNanchor_2_116" id=
"FNanchor_2_116"></a><a href="#fn2_116" class=
"fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
<p>More important than all this, it was not a plan of
colonization at all, but one of mere emigration. It was "not
founded on any <i>principles</i> of colonization; he does not
regard emigration as, what it plainly is, but one, and only the
second, element of colonization." <a name="FNanchor_2_117" id=
"FNanchor_2_117"></a><a href="#fn2_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
<p>It overlooked the most important, namely, the disposal of
colonial waste lands. Emigration was only one ingredient of
colonization, and its function merely was to supply colonies with
labour. <a name="FNanchor_2_118" id="FNanchor_2_118"></a><a href=
"#fn2_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In the same way as Wilmot
Horton had distinguished between desultory, unregulated
emigration and his plan of regulated and systematic emigration,
so they distinguished between his plan of mere emigration and
their own of systematic colonization. Their condemnation may be
summed up under the phrase coined afterwards by Charles
Buller&mdash;the whole scheme was nothing less than "shovelling
out paupers." <a name="FNanchor_2_119" id=
"FNanchor_2_119"></a><a href="#fn2_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> They blamed Wilmot Horton and his plans for
making emigration generally distasteful. In this respect
pauper-location was as much a deterrent as transportation.
<a name="FNanchor_2_120" id="FNanchor_2_120"></a><a href=
"#fn2_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> They complained that in his
plan the advantage, not of the pauper emigrant, but of the
ratepayer, was prominent; and that this, together with the fact
that the settlers of 1823 and 1825 had suffered hardships,
created a dislike to pauper emigration, and therefore to all
emigration. <a name="FNanchor_2_121" id=
"FNanchor_2_121"></a><a href="#fn2_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a> Again, they complained of the "language of
apathy or disgust in which public opinion speaks concerning all
measures for the promotion of colonization," <a name=
"FNanchor_2_122" id="FNanchor_2_122"></a><a href="#fn2_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and for this indifference they blamed
Wilmot Horton's activities. Indeed, they expressed their opinion
of him in no measured terms. He was an "insufferable political
bore"; <a name="FNanchor_2_123" id="FNanchor_2_123"></a><a href=
"#fn2_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> his seven years' advocacy
of emigration had disgusted people with the mention of the word;
<a name="FNanchor_2_124" id="FNanchor_2_124"></a><a href=
"#fn2_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and "until that zealous and
persevering, but ignorant and meddling pretender in political
economy, shall cease to torment the public and the Colonial
Office with his 'preparations to show' there will be difficulty
in establishing rational views on this deeply interesting
subject" of colonization. <a name="FNanchor_2_125" id=
"FNanchor_2_125"></a><a href="#fn2_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a> Wilmot Horton's name served Wakefield long
afterwards as a contemptuous phrase to express the antithesis of
true colonization. In 1848, when Lord Grey had come into office
again, with Benjamin Hawes and Charles Buller to assist him in
colonial reform, and was disappointing the expectations of the
systematic colonizers by proposing a loan for emigration on lines
of which they disapproved, Wakefield wrote, "It is a scheme for
nothing else than the shovelling out of paupers at the public
expense. Lord Grey, Buller, and Hawes having failed in all their
promises with respect both to colonization and government, fall
back upon Wilmot-Hortonism." <a name="FNanchor_2_126" id=
"FNanchor_2_126"></a><a href="#fn2_126" class=
"fnanchor">[126]</a></p>
<p>Wilmot Horton's failure to excite interest in his plans, or to
get them carried into effect upon any large scale, disclosed the
fact that the mother-country was not then prepared to spend any
considerable amount of the public funds in emigration, even as a
cure for redundancy of population. Voluntary emigration would not
be discouraged as it furnished an outlet for population, and
helped to make the colonies prosperous. It might even be
regulated by Government, but it would not be carried on at the
public cost. In this way the ground was cleared for the
favourable reception of the Wakefield system, which in practice
possessed the great attraction of providing a fund for emigration
in a comparatively simple and inexpensive manner.</p>

put the same idea somewhat differently:</p>
<p class="poem">"Horton's old mantle Howick makes his own,<br>
Across his shoulders whimsically thrown;<br>
And vapid lingo finds a hackney'd theme<br>
In emigration, as a social scheme,<br>
Destined to render th' English nation blest,<br>
By getting rid of paupers as a pest;<br>
If starving hinds and all their tribe will go<br>
Where hungry cravings none can ever know;<br>
Where Indian mothers and their sucking squaws<br>
Find ceaseless practice for their copper jaws;<br>
Or where th' Australian to the stranger yields,<br>
In savage sulk, his boundless woods and fields;<br>
Where culprits that escaped the gallows-tree<br>
Become possessors of estates in fee,<br>
And those estates, from genial option, choose<br>
In districts stocked with thieves and kangaroos."</p>

<h4>Chapter III</h4>
<h3>THE FOUNDING OF THE SWAN RIVER COLONY</h3>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the early part of the year 1827,
Captain James Stirling, of the Royal Navy, left Port Jackson, New
South Wales, in H.M.S. <i>Success</i> on a voyage of exploration
to the West Coast of Australia. He was accompanied by Mr. Frazer,
a botanist, who had been present at the opening of a great deal
of new country in Australia. <a name="FNanchor_3_1" id=
"FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#fn3_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Having examined the coast near Swan River and penetrated some
distance inland, Stirling, on his return, sent in to the Colonial
Office a report on the country's suitability for colonization.
<a name="FNanchor_3_2" id="FNanchor_3_2"></a><a href="#fn3_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Previous accounts from Dutch and French
explorers had been very unfavourable. They had found neither
fresh water, fertile soil, nor a safe anchorage. According to
Stirling the country was well supplied with each of these
essentials, and he gave a glowing account of its fitness for
colonization. It was, he wrote, "the land which, of all that I
have seen in various quarters of the world, possesses the
greatest natural attraction." <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
"FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#fn3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
appeared to him as "a spot so eligible for settlement that it
cannot long remain unoccupied. It is not inferior in any natural
essential quality to the plain of Lombardy." <a name=
"FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#fn3_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p>Stirling warned the Colonial Office that "some foreign power
may see the advantage of taking possession should His Majesty's
Government leave it unappropriated." <a name="FNanchor_3_5" id=
"FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#fn3_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
Admiralty repeated this warning, and urged that the settlement of
Albany should without hesitation be transferred to Swan River,
lest the French or the Americans should assume possession of the
only safe anchorage on the West Coast of Australia. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_6" id="FNanchor_3_6"></a><a href="#fn3_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> This settlement of Albany on King George's
Sound in 1825, and those at Melville Island in 1824, and at
Raffles Bay in 1827, were all convict settlements founded for
fear of the French, <a name="FNanchor_3_7" id=
"FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="#fn3_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
the same motive now induced the Government to decide on a new,
but free, settlement at Swan River. <a name="FNanchor_3_8" id=
"FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href="#fn3_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It
was rumoured that the French were about to seize such an
attractive place and thus hamper English trade both with India
and the East Coast of Australia. At a later time, indeed, these
rumours were proved to be false, <a name="FNanchor_3_9" id=
"FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#fn3_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but,
for the moment, they spurred the Government into activity.
Huskisson suggested, early in 1828, that the East India Company
might found the colony, and he promised that every facility would
be given to them by the Government. <a name="FNanchor_3_10" id=
"FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#fn3_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The Company, however, did not think it expedient, and the
Government gave up the project on grounds of economy. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#fn3_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p>Stirling's report attracted much attention in England, and the
proposal dropped by the Government was taken up in August, 1828,
by private individuals. The first offer came from Captain
Stirling and Major Moody (of the Royal Engineers). Rightly
assuming that expense was the Government's objection to founding
the colony, they asked permission to form an association of
private capitalists to whom a proprietary charter should be
granted on the lines of those of Pennsylvania and Georgia.
<a name="FNanchor_3_12" id="FNanchor_3_12"></a><a href="#fn3_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But although the Government would not
found a settlement themselves, they were determined not to lose
control over any proposed new colony. They did not, therefore,
accept this offer, "as it was deemed desirable to exercise a more
immediate control over the settlement by Government than by such
an arrangement it would possess." <a name="FNanchor_3_13" id=
"FNanchor_3_13"></a><a href="#fn3_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p>The next offer came very soon afterwards from another body of
capitalists, consisting of Mr. Thomas Peel (second cousin of Sir
Robert Peel), Sir Francis Vincent, Mr. E. W. H. Schenley, and
Colonel Potter MacQueen. They formed themselves into an
association to colonize at Swan River by sending there 10,000
settlers, and a due proportion of stock, within the next four
years. They reckoned their outlay at £30 per head of people sent
out, and asked in return for a grant of 4,000,000 acres, being at
the rate of 1s. 6d. per acre. <a name="FNanchor_3_14" id=
"FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#fn3_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Believing that their scheme had received the verbal sanction of
the Government, they bought a ship, and began to make the
necessary preparations. <a name="FNanchor_3_15" id=
"FNanchor_3_15"></a><a href="#fn3_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
But the Government was not prepared to part with such an enormous
amount of land on these conditions, nor were they anxious that
the experiment should be made on such a large scale in the first
instance, because of the extensive distress which would result in
case of failure. The Government proposed, therefore, to limit the
grant to a maximum of one million acres, half of which was to be
given on the arrival of the first vessel, provided not less than
400 settlers were sent out then. The other half was to be granted
by degrees as fresh settlers arrived. <a name="FNanchor_3_16" id=
"FNanchor_3_16"></a><a href="#fn3_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
At the same time they laid down conditions as to cultivation and
investment of capital which were to apply not only to the
proposed Association, but to any other settlers who chose to
emigrate there. The Government declared its intention to incur no
expense in founding the colony. No convicts or any other
prisoners were to be sent there. Any settler emigrating was to
receive a grant of land at the rate of forty acres for every £3
of capital invested. Paying a labourer's passage was to count as
an investment of capital at the pate of 200 acres for each
passage paid. If, within twenty-one years, the land was not
cultivated and improved to the satisfaction of the governor it
was to revert to the Crown. The Government also announced their
intention of strictly maintaining not only these conditions, but
all contracts for service in the colony which might be made with
labourers or others. <a name="FNanchor_3_17" id=
"FNanchor_3_17"></a><a href="#fn3_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The government of the colony was to be in the hands of Captain
Stirling, who was to receive no salary until the colony was
successful. Instead of salary he was to have a grant of 100,000
acres, subject to the same conditions as other settlers, except
that he was allowed to have a priority of choice. A Bill
establishing the government of the colony was promised for the
next Session of Parliament. <a name="FNanchor_3_18" id=
"FNanchor_3_18"></a><a href="#fn3_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The Association insisted that they, too, had been given a
priority of choice, <a name="FNanchor_3_19" id=
"FNanchor_3_19"></a><a href="#fn3_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and this was, in the end, allowed to them as to 250,000 acres. In
all respects but this they were to be placed on the same footing
as other settlers. <a name="FNanchor_3_20" id=
"FNanchor_3_20"></a><a href="#fn3_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1829, owing to these changes in
the original plan, the other members of the Association withdrew,
leaving Peel, who was prepared to accept the terms of the
Government. <a name="FNanchor_3_21" id=
"FNanchor_3_21"></a><a href="#fn3_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
New regulations for intending settlers were published by the
Colonial Office in January, 1829, containing two important
changes from the terms of 1828. In the first place the grants in
proportion to the capital were only to apply to settlers arriving
in the colony before the end of 1830. In the next place the
period of twenty-one years allowed for cultivation was reduced to
ten. <a name="FNanchor_3_22" id="FNanchor_3_22"></a><a href=
"#fn3_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> For those who arrived after
1830 the Government was later to make new regulations. The final
agreement made with Peel was that if he landed at least 400
settlers before November 1st, 1829, he was to receive 250,000
acres, which he was allowed to mark out on the map, and which
would be reserved for him until that date. If he fulfilled this
condition he could subsequently claim, by a further investment of
capital, land to the extent of another 750,000 acres. The
original term of twenty-one years was allowed to him for
cultivation. If he had landed no settlers by November 1st, 1829,
his priority of choice lapsed, and he was to be exactly on the
same footing as any other settler investing in the colony.
<a name="FNanchor_3_23" id="FNanchor_3_23"></a><a href="#fn3_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p>In the beginning of February, 1829, a small preparatory
expedition, under the leadership of Captain Stirling, sailed from
Spithead in the ships <i>Parmelia</i> and <i>Sulphur</i>. After
touching at Cape Town the <i>Parmelia</i>, with. Stirling on
board, arrived at Swan River on June 1st, the <i>Sulphur</i>
arriving seventeen days later. One month before, Captain
Fremantle, acting under instructions, had arrived from Sydney,
and had taken possession of the West Coast of Australia in the
name of His Majesty King George IV. Captain Stirling at once
began to form a settlement, and to prepare for the expected
stream of immigrants. <a name="FNanchor_3_24" id=
"FNanchor_3_24"></a><a href="#fn3_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<p>Meantime a Bill had been introduced into the House of Commons
on April 3rd by Sir George Murray to provide for the government
of the new colony. The Bill passed through its several stages in
both Houses with little or no discussion. On the second reading
in the House of Commons, Joseph Hume made some objection to the
power left in the hands of a single individual. In Committee,
too, he inquired as to the expense, and was told by Murray that
"it was conducted on the lowest possible scale." <a name=
"FNanchor_3_25" id="FNanchor_3_25"></a><a href="#fn3_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Quarterly Review</i> for April, 1829, contained a
puffing article, setting forth the advantages of colonizing the
Swan River country. The project was recommended as a remedy for
over-population in Britain, and as a means of creating new
markets for British manufactures. The new colony was vaunted as
superior to New South Wales in several respects. In the first
place it had a better soil and climate. In the next place its
geographical position in regard to Europe and to India was more
favourable to commerce than that of New South Wales. For it was
predicted a rapid growth like that of Singapore. In the last
place it was to be a free settlement, untainted by the presence
of convicts. <a name="FNanchor_3_26" id=
"FNanchor_3_26"></a><a href="#fn3_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p>Despite frequent disclaimers the impression got abroad that
the colony was to be founded by the Government, or, at any rate,
with its approbation and co-operation. <a name="FNanchor_3_27"
id="FNanchor_3_27"></a><a href="#fn3_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a> The Colonial Office was credited with the
keenest interest in the success of the new colony, and the
<i>Quarterly Review's</i> article was suspected of being official
in origin. <a name="FNanchor_3_28" id=
"FNanchor_3_28"></a><a href="#fn3_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Horace Twiss, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the
Colonies, was considered to be the real founder of the colony.
When Shaw Lefevre, who held this position in 1834, asked his
chief, Stanley, to consider carefully the project of colonizing
South Australia, Stanley replied that "Hay had founded Fernando
Po, Twiss had founded Swan River, and he, Lefevre, wanted, he
supposed, to found Spencer's Gulf." <a name="FNanchor_3_29" id=
"FNanchor_3_29"></a><a href="#fn3_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
After the first intimation of the intention to form a colony the
Government received numerous applications for free passages from
intending emigrants. <a name="FNanchor_3_30" id=
"FNanchor_3_30"></a><a href="#fn3_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
But all these they refused as there was no emigration fund, and
they were determined to avoid all expense. A desire for
emigration manifested itself not only among poorer people, but
among capitalists of considerable property. Indeed, the prospects
held out by the new colony appeared very favourable. New South
Wales had recently made remarkable progress in a small space of
time, and, according to reports, this country was not only better
situated for commerce, but more fertile and with a more equable
climate. Again a very great attraction was that it was to be the
first free settlement on the shores of Australia. The settlers
were never to endure the evils of transportation, and they might
with safety settle their families there in the knowledge that
they would live in a free and moral society. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_31" id="FNanchor_3_31"></a><a href="#fn3_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a> In addition, the great inducement was held
out to them of obtaining good land under easy conditions. A
further attraction to capitalists lay in the fact that the
Government was prepared to maintain a civil and military
establishment for the protection of the settlers, and to enforce
the contracts of indentured labourers. In these circumstances the
body of intending colonists was respectable in number, in
property, and in character. It contained "more than the usual
number of men of property and family," <a name="FNanchor_3_32"
id="FNanchor_3_32"></a><a href="#fn3_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a> compared, at any rate, with colonies hitherto
founded in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#fn3_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p>Very soon after publication of the article in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> it was rumoured that the whole of the Swan and Canning
Rivers, the entire shore of the harbour, and practically all the
available fertile land had been granted to Peel, so that there
was little inducement for any settler who did not obtain land
from him. <a name="FNanchor_3_34" id="FNanchor_3_34"></a><a href=
"#fn3_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Sir George Murray took the
occasion in the House of Commons to deny this, and to point out
the true state of affairs, by giving the history of the
negotiations with the Government, and the terms upon which Peel
held his land. <a name="FNanchor_3_35" id=
"FNanchor_3_35"></a><a href="#fn3_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p>Even then it was suggested out of Parliament that Sir Robert
Peel had been instrumental in obtaining an enormous grant of land
for a relative of his. <a name="FNanchor_3_36" id=
"FNanchor_3_36"></a><a href="#fn3_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Peel in Parliament replied to his critics that all he had done
was to send a letter to Sir George Murray asking him to give Mr.
Thomas Peel, his second cousin, "any facilities that he
consistently could." He assured the House, "on the honour of a
gentleman," that he had done nothing more, and Brougham took the
occasion to say that he had never before known Peel to make an
unnecessary speech. <a name="FNanchor_3_37" id=
"FNanchor_3_37"></a><a href="#fn3_37" class=
"fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<p>In spite of the high hopes which attended the founding of the
new colony, its success was small. The first settlers met with
more than the usual hardships and disappointments which accompany
the formation of a new settlement in an uninhabited country. The
anchorage which had seemed so safe at the end of summer was
dangerous in the winter. Stirling's ship, the <i>Parmelia</i>,
went ashore, and several others became wrecks. Then, too, the
reports as to the fertility of the land proved to be exaggerated.
<a name="FNanchor_3_38" id="FNanchor_3_38"></a><a href="#fn3_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The opinions of a naval officer and a
botanist were found not to coincide with those of practical
farmers. <a name="FNanchor_3_39" id="FNanchor_3_39"></a><a href=
"#fn3_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> To add to their other
difficulties a scarcity of provisions manifested itself, and the
colony had to be fed from Van Diemen's Land. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_40" id="FNanchor_3_40"></a><a href="#fn3_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a> The result was that from the beginning prices
ruled very high in the colony. <a name="FNanchor_3_41" id=
"FNanchor_3_41"></a><a href="#fn3_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Most of the good land near at hand was taken up by a few
settlers, <a name="FNanchor_3_42" id="FNanchor_3_42"></a><a href=
"#fn3_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and the rest were either
unable to obtain sufficient for their purposes, or were unwilling
to go far enough afield to find it. In these circumstances there
was a great deal of disappointment amongst those who had expected
instant success; in place of the very optimistic reports of the
prospects of the new colony, equally exaggerated reports of its
unsuitability for colonization and its complete failure were
circulated, especially by those who had left the colony in
disgust. <a name="FNanchor_3_43" id="FNanchor_3_43"></a><a href=
"#fn3_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> A great deal of good land was
found, but the settlers had been induced to believe that there
was no bad land, and many of them found to their cost that this
was false. Although the emigrants were generally respectable, and
possessed of some capital, they were not as a body quite equal to
the difficult situation in which they found themselves placed.
<a name="FNanchor_3_44" id="FNanchor_3_44"></a><a href="#fn3_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Many of them had no notion of the
hardships they would encounter. In the words of an early settler,
some of them "expected the moment their feet touched the shore,
to find inns, turnpike roads, smiling orchards, and cornfields in
a country untrod by civilized man." <a name="FNanchor_3_45" id=
"FNanchor_3_45"></a><a href="#fn3_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Some, indeed, resolutely faced all difficulties, and managed to
establish themselves, but others soon gave up the unequal
struggle and removed themselves and what was left of their
property to Van Diemen's Land, or to New South Wales. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_46" id="FNanchor_3_46"></a><a href="#fn3_46" class=
"fnanchor">[46]</a> By January, 1830, disastrous accounts of the
failure of the new colony reached England from Van Diemen's Land.
<a name="FNanchor_3_47" id="FNanchor_3_47"></a><a href="#fn3_47"
class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The anchorage was said to be unsafe,
the land mostly sterile and incapable of supporting a population,
while the whole of the good land was reported to be taken up
already. A general despondency was said to have taken the place
of the hopeful feelings of the early colonists.</p>
<p>The evidence as to the early days is so conflicting that it is
difficult to determine what really happened. The official
despatches of the Governor never admit anything like a general
failure, but attribute the want of success to the class of
colonists emigrating, and to the exaggerated expectations which
they had formed. <a name="FNanchor_3_48" id=
"FNanchor_3_48"></a><a href="#fn3_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Certainly there was much distress, and the greater part of the
settlers re-emigrated. The population, which had been 4,000,
dropped in 1832 to 1,500. <a name="FNanchor_3_49" id=
"FNanchor_3_49"></a><a href="#fn3_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Nevertheless, a beginning was made on a very small scale, and,
though sorely harassed, the colony managed to keep alive. The
land was, no doubt, very different from what Stirling had
reported it to be, but it was by no means "nothing but sand and
rocks" as the disappointed settlers found it. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_50" id="FNanchor_3_50"></a><a href="#fn3_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> The anchorage at Gage Roads was unsafe; that
at Cockburn Sound was better. <a name="FNanchor_3_51" id=
"FNanchor_3_51"></a><a href="#fn3_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Although several ships were lost, it was often due to neglecting
the official warning as to the insecurity of their anchorage. For
want of time between the arrival of the first expedition and that
of the main body, sufficient care was not taken in making
preparations to receive the settlers. The two largest
enterprises&mdash;that of Peel and that of Colonel
Lautour&mdash;were both failures, <a name="FNanchor_3_52" id=
"FNanchor_3_52"></a><a href="#fn3_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
but some of the smaller capitalists prospered. Peel did not
arrive in the colony until early in December, 1829, when,
according to agreement, his grant was no longer reserved for him,
but was distributed amongst other applicants. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_53" id="FNanchor_3_53"></a><a href="#fn3_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a> He landed 300 settlers, and spent altogether
£50,000, <a name="FNanchor_3_54" id="FNanchor_3_54"></a><a href=
"#fn3_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> but in a very little time his
stock had wasted away, and most of his settlers had left him.
Edward Gibbon Wakefield, before the House of Commons Committee on
Waste Lands in 1836, gave a very vivid account of the failure of
the colony and of Peel's misfortunes&mdash;on the authority, he
said, of one of Peel's agents. <a name="FNanchor_3_55" id=
"FNanchor_3_55"></a><a href="#fn3_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p>"That colony, which was founded with a general hope in this
country, amongst very intelligent persons of all descriptions,
that it would be a most prosperous colony, has all but perished.
It has not quite perished, but the population is a great deal
less than the number of emigrants; it has been a diminishing
population since its foundation. The greater part of the capital
which was taken out (and that was very large) has disappeared
altogether, and a great portion of the labourers taken out (and
they were a very considerable number) have emigrated a second
time to Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales. The many disasters
which befell this colony (for some people did actually die of
hunger), and the destruction of the colony taken out to the Swan
River, and the second emigration of the people who went out,
appear to me to be accounted for at once by the manner in which
land was granted. The first grant consisted of 500,000 acres to
an individual, Mr. Peel. That grant was marked out upon the map
in England&mdash;500,000 acres were taken round about the port or
landing place. It was quite impossible for Mr. Peel to cultivate
500,000 acres, or a hundredth part of the grant; but others were,
of course, necessitated to go beyond his grant in order to take
their land. So that the first operation in that colony was to
create a great desert, to mark out a large tract of land, and to
say. 'This is desert&mdash;no man shall come here; no man shall
cultivate this land.' So far dispersion was produced, because
upon the terms on which Mr. Peel obtained his land, land was
given to the others. The governor took another 100,000 acres,
another person took 80,000 acres; and the dispersion was so great
that, at last, the settlers did not know where they were; that
is, each settler knew that he was where he was, but he could not
tell where anyone else was; and, therefore, he did not know his
own position. That was why some people died of hunger; for though
there was an ample supply of food at the governor's house, the
settlers did not know where the governor was, and the governor
did not know where the settlers were. Then, besides the evils
resulting from dispersion, there occurred what I consider almost
a greater one; which is, the separation of the people and the
want of combinable labour. The labourers, on finding out that
land could be obtained with the greatest facility, the labourers
taken out under contracts, under engagements which assured them
of very high wages if they would labour during a certain time for
wages, immediately laughed at their masters. Mr. Peel carried out
altogether about 300 persons&mdash;men, women, and children. Of
those 300 persons, about sixty were able labouring men. In six
months after his arrival he had nobody even to make his bed for
him or to fetch him water from the river. He was obliged to make
his own bed and to fetch water for himself, and to light his own
fire. All the labourers had left him. The capital, therefore,
which he took out, namely, implements of husbandry, seeds and
stock, especially stock, immediately perished; without shepherds
to take care of the sheep, the sheep wandered and were lost;
eaten by the native dogs, killed by the natives and by some of
the other colonists, very likely by his own workmen; but they
were destroyed; his seeds perished on the beach; his houses were
of no use; his wooden houses were there in frame, in pieces, but
could not be put together, and were therefore quite useless, and
rotted on the beach. This was the case with the capitalists
generally. The labourers, obtaining land very readily, and
running about to fix upon locations for themselves, and to
establish themselves independently, very soon separated
themselves into isolated families, into what may be termed
cottiers, with a very large extent of land, something like the
Irish cottiers, but having, instead of a very small piece of
land, a large extent of land. Every one was separated, and very
soon fell into the greatest distress. Falling into the greatest
distress, they returned to their masters, and insisted upon the
fulfilment of the agreements upon which they had gone out; but
then Mr. Peel said, 'All my capital is gone; you have ruined me
by deserting me, by breaking your engagements; and you now insist
upon my observing the engagements when you yourselves have
deprived me of the means of doing so.' They wanted to hang him,
and he ran away to a distance, where he secreted himself for a
time till they were carried off to Van Diemen's Land." <a name=
"FNanchor_3_56" id="FNanchor_3_56"></a><a href="#fn3_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p>In all this there is much truth and considerable error. As a
general description of the colony it is not quite fair, while in
some important details it is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Wakefield confused Peel's reserved grant, which was marked out
upon the map in England, and did take in a great deal of the
country around the port, <a name="FNanchor_3_57" id=
"FNanchor_3_57"></a><a href="#fn3_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
with the grant that he subsequently obtained. This latter did not
exceed 250,000 acres, and extended "from Cockburn Sound to the
Murray River near Cape Bauvard, and thence up that river
twenty-five miles from its source," <i>i.e</i>., considerably to
the south of his original grant. <a name="FNanchor_3_58" id=
"FNanchor_3_58"></a><a href="#fn3_58" class=
"fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<p>As to the governor's 100,000 acres, they were situated partly
on Isle Buâche (later known as Garden Island) and partly at
Geographe Bay, about one hundred miles from the Swan River.</p>
<p>Although famine often threatened the colony, there is no
evidence that any settlers died of starvation. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_59" id="FNanchor_3_59"></a><a href="#fn3_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p>Again, there was no such wholesale desertion of their masters
by indentured servants as Wakefield described. No doubt there was
a great deal of trouble between masters and servants. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_60" id="FNanchor_3_60"></a><a href="#fn3_60" class=
"fnanchor">[60]</a> who could not agree as to the interpretation
of their contracts. <a name="FNanchor_3_61" id=
"FNanchor_3_61"></a><a href="#fn3_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Servants did occasionally desert, and once more the plan of
taking out to a colony labourers under indenture failed. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_62" id="FNanchor_3_62"></a><a href="#fn3_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a> One settler bitterly complained: "Indented
servants are of no use. Almost every settler is obliged to
dismiss his indented servants for idleness, disobedience to
orders or drunkenness; and so soon as they obtain their liberty
they embark for either Hobart or Sydney. I have been ruined by
laying out my money in the way recommended by Government in their
published regulations." <a name="FNanchor_3_63" id=
"FNanchor_3_63"></a><a href="#fn3_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p>Agreements were enforced, at least after a court was
established, and often it was the master and not the servant who
wished to escape from his obligations. In Peel's case, indeed,
although some of his people deserted him (and were imprisoned for
it <a name="FNanchor_3_64" id="FNanchor_3_64"></a><a href=
"#fn3_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>) he consented to discharge
all but a few from their indentures. These were maintained at the
public expense until they found employment with other masters, or
departed to other colonies. <a name="FNanchor_3_65" id=
"FNanchor_3_65"></a><a href="#fn3_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The reason given by Wakefield for the desertion, namely, that the
labourers could easily obtain land, is quite inconsistent with
the regulation in the colony forbidding land grants to servants
under indenture or to those who came out at the expense of
others, unless the conditions of any agreement under which they
came were fulfilled. <a name="FNanchor_3_66" id=
"FNanchor_3_66"></a><a href="#fn3_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
This regulation was never relaxe. <a name="FNanchor_3_67" id=
"FNanchor_3_67"></a><a href="#fn3_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
<p>Peel's failure was due in part to his own character. In his
dealings with the Colonial Office he showed himself to be of an
impetuous nature, and possessed of little discretion. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_68" id="FNanchor_3_68"></a><a href="#fn3_68" class=
"fnanchor">[68]</a> Added to this he did not have sufficient
business ability to direct with success such a large undertaking
in a new colony. <a name="FNanchor_3_69" id=
"FNanchor_3_69"></a><a href="#fn3_69" class=
"fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
<p>When Wakefield gave this description he was explaining and
defending his theory of a sufficient price on colonial waste land
before his first important Committee of the House of Commons. For
some years previously, too, he had been doing his best to make a
success of the scheme for founding South Australia on this
principle. He was, therefore, led perhaps to exaggerate the
failure of Swan River, and to attribute it wholly to the system
adopted there of large free grants of land.</p>
<p>After the disasters of the first few years, the colony
improved a little, but from 1832 to 1849 it made very slow
progress. The population slowly grew from 1,500 in 1832, to 4,600
in 1849. <a name="FNanchor_3_70" id="FNanchor_3_70"></a><a href=
"#fn3_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Capital and labour were both
scarce, and the colony remained unattractive to emigrants.</p>
<p>The causes of this stagnation are not difficult to find. The
early failures, the quality of the soil, the disappointment of
the first settlers, and the consequent discouraging reports sent
home, brought to the new colony an unenviable notoriety.
Emigrants were anxious to avoid a place where, it was said, the
land was desert, and man and beast perished. If they went to
Australia at all, they preferred New South Wales or Van Diemen's
Land, where good land could be got, and convicts to work it.</p>
<p>There stand out, however, three main reasons why the colony
did not achieve success in any way equal to that of the other
Australian colonies.</p>
<p>In the first place, the method of disposing of waste land on
very easy terms and in large grants encouraged a scramble for
land in which the colonists took up far more land than they could
possibly cultivate, and settled themselves at a distance from one
another. <a name="FNanchor_3_71" id="FNanchor_3_71"></a><a href=
"#fn3_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In the attempt to secure
large allotments the settlers expended so much of their capital
on outfit, and in bringing themselves and their labourers to
their land that they soon found themselves without any capital to
carry on agriculture. <a name="FNanchor_3_72" id=
"FNanchor_3_72"></a><a href="#fn3_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Those who did not quit the colony remained scattered and
impoverished, for, after the first inrush of population, very
little capital came, and for want of it industry languished.
<a name="FNanchor_3_73" id="FNanchor_3_73"></a><a href="#fn3_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The injury done to the colony by
granting away large tracts of land was admitted very soon by
those at the head of affairs at home and in the colony. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_74" id="FNanchor_3_74"></a><a href="#fn3_74" class=
"fnanchor">[74]</a> Governor Stirling, as early as January, 1830,
recommended that the Home Government should abandon the system of
free grants in favour of the American system of sale by auction.
<a name="FNanchor_3_75" id="FNanchor_3_75"></a><a href="#fn3_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Sir George Murray, in July, 1830,
announced the intention of his department to take into
consideration the whole question of the disposal of Crown lands
in the colonies. In the meantime he sent out to the Swan River
new land regulations. <a name="FNanchor_3_76" id=
"FNanchor_3_76"></a><a href="#fn3_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
No change in principle was made by these regulations, but the
amount of land granted in proportion to capital was reduced.
Those settlers who arrived after 1830 were only to receive twenty
acres instead of forty for every £3 of capital invested, and
paying a labourer's passage gave a right to only 100 instead of
200 acres. Murray also suggested to Stirling that, in order to
prevent the injurious dispersion of colonists, some limit should
be placed on the quantity of land which a settler, whatever the
amount of his capital, might be allowed to receive.</p>
<p>But by then the harm had been done, and if any further proof
of the evil of large land grants were needed, it was shown by the
want of success which attended the introduction of the new system
of sale of land in the beginning of 1831. <a name="FNanchor_3_77"
id="FNanchor_3_77"></a><a href="#fn3_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> So much land had by then been alienated that
for fifteen years or more land sales were a negligible quantity,
and consequently no fund was raised in this way for emigration.
<a name="FNanchor_3_78" id="FNanchor_3_78"></a><a href="#fn3_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
<p>In the second place, an important cause of failure was the
scarcity of labour, resulting partly from the system of large
grants, and partly from the system of indentured labour. The
former prevented the settlers from combining their labour.
Scattered and impoverished they were unable to render to one
another that support and co-operation which is particularly
necessary in a new colony. <a name="FNanchor_3_79" id=
"FNanchor_3_79"></a><a href="#fn3_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
With the failure of the latter system went the only body of
labour for hire in the colony. Until 1849 there was never a
supply of labour in the colony satisfactory to the settlers, and
this they early made a source of complaint. In 1831, and again in
1832, they petitioned the Home Government, in view of the
scarcity of labour, to provide labourers with free passages to
the colony, and to repay itself out of their future wages. They
persuaded Governor Stirling to visit England in order to lay this
and other requests before the Secretary of State, which he did,
but without success, in 1832-3.</p>
<p>In the third place. Government expenditure was kept on a very
low scale compared with New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.
The Home Government adhered closely to their declared intention
of incurring no expense in founding the colony, and the civil
establishment was kept down to modest proportions. They also
refused to spend money either in public works, or in paying the
passage of labourers, taking the view that the colony had been
founded by private enterprise, and should receive no assistance
other than the provision of its civil government, and its
protection by naval and military forces. More important still was
the absence of convicts. In the penal colonies of New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land, the system of transportation both provided
a useful, if not very satisfactory, supply of labour, and
occasioned a very large Government expenditure in maintaining and
guarding the penal establishments. On these two factors rested to
a great extent their prosperity, but the Swan River colony had
the advantage of neither.</p>
<p>The best evidence of the scarcity of labour suffered by the
Swan River, and of its lack of prosperity, lies in the fact that
although it was founded as a free colony, and claimed particular
merit on that account, convicts were asked for as a special boon,
and that not until the request was granted, and they arrived in
1849, did the colony make any rapid progress.</p>
<p>As early as 1831, it is said, the majority of settlers would
have been glad to share the benefits of convict labour as the
only means of making the colony thriving and prosperous. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_80" id="FNanchor_3_80"></a><a href="#fn3_80" class=
"fnanchor">[80]</a> Wakefield declared in 1831, <a name=
"FNanchor_3_81" id="FNanchor_3_81"></a><a href="#fn3_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a> and repeated in 1833, <a name="FNanchor_3_82"
id="FNanchor_3_82"></a><a href="#fn3_82" class=
"fnanchor">[82]</a> and in 1836, <a name="FNanchor_3_83" id=
"FNanchor_3_83"></a><a href="#fn3_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
that the colonists had asked for convicts, <a name=
"FNanchor_3_84" id="FNanchor_3_84"></a><a href="#fn3_84" class=
"fnanchor">[84]</a> and he treated the request as an admission of
the want of labour.</p>
<p>From 1831 to 1834, isolated requests were made to the Home
Government by settlers, and by those interested in the colony,
that the original determination to send no prisoners might be
rescinded. Colonel Lautour, who owned one of the largest
enterprises in the colony, proposed, in January, 1831, to take
out 300 of those agricultural labourers who had been convicted in
the recent riots in England. In support of his proposal, he urged
their value as agriculturists and the difference between them and
the ordinary convicts. <a name="FNanchor_3_85" id=
"FNanchor_3_85"></a><a href="#fn3_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
In the same year, too, a settler declared to the Home Government
that the whole colony would welcome the introduction of any kind
of convict labour. "The Government need not fear the charge of a
breach of faith. The settlers, to a man, have changed their
opinions since they encamped within the shores of Australia.
There can, therefore, be no breach of faith in granting them a
boon which will be beneficial to all, and the only thing which
can save most of them from utter ruin. A settler of the first
rank and capital said to me, 'I came here because no convicts
were to be sent; but so completely are my sentiments altered on
the subject that, if a petition for convict labour were moved
to-morrow, I should be ready to put my name to it.'" <a name=
"FNanchor_3_86" id="FNanchor_3_86"></a><a href="#fn3_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a> Three years later another settler wrote that
convict labour would give the colony its only chance of
prosperity. <a name="FNanchor_3_87" id=
"FNanchor_3_87"></a><a href="#fn3_87" class=
"fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p>Captain Irwin, in 1834, proposed to import convicted natives
of India to labour in the construction of public works in the
colony. <a name="FNanchor_3_88" id="FNanchor_3_88"></a><a href=
"#fn3_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>
<p>But it was not until the end of 1834 that any united request
was made by the colonists, and then only by a few. Sixteen
settlers at King George's Sound then signed a petition asking for
the establishment of a convict station there. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_89" id="FNanchor_3_89"></a><a href="#fn3_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a> They urged that the difficulties encountered
in establishing themselves in the interior of the colony could
not otherwise be overcome, and therefore "that the unpleasant
feeling regarding the presence of convicts must yield to the more
important object of advancing themselves and the colony in
general." <a name="FNanchor_3_90" id="FNanchor_3_90"></a><a href=
"#fn3_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
<p>All of these early requests the Government refused to grant,
taking the view that it would mean breaking the engagement under
which the colony was formed. But in 1849, when Swan River was
still lagging far behind the other Australian colonies, and the
latter were ridding themselves of the system of transportation,
the renewed request was granted, and an immediate prosperity set
in. <a name="FNanchor_3_91" id="FNanchor_3_91"></a><a href=
"#fn3_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p>The Swan River colony was the first experiment in free
colonization which had been made in Australia in the nineteenth
century, and, by the new and vigorous school of systematic
colonizers, at whose head was Edward Gibbon Wakefield, it was,
from 1830, seized upon as a horrible example of how not to
colonize. <a name="FNanchor_3_92" id="FNanchor_3_92"></a><a href=
"#fn3_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Its want of success was
attributed to an erroneous principle of colonization, whose trial
pointed the way towards the true principle. <a name=
"FNanchor_3_93" id="FNanchor_3_93"></a><a href="#fn3_93" class=
"fnanchor">[93]</a> "The ideas of the founders of the
Colonization Society of 1830," wrote Wakefield in 1849, "grew out
of the first proceedings of the British Government in settling
the Swan River or West Australia. A perception of the utter
inadequacy of the means employed on that occasion&mdash;the
curious fact of a government elaborately, though unconsciously
providing for inevitable failure, with copious elements of
success at its easy disposal&mdash;led to a careful examination
of the whole subject." <a name="FNanchor_3_94" id=
"FNanchor_3_94"></a><a href="#fn3_94" class=
"fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>Wakefield and his followers never seemed to have considered
that one good reason for the failure of the colony might be found
in its geographical conditions, that a scarcity of good land was
quite as important as a scarcity of labour. They found there the
coincidence of large free grants of land with scarcity of capital
and labour, and they put down the former as the cause of the
latter. <a name="FNanchor_3_95" id="FNanchor_3_95"></a><a href=
"#fn3_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> They held that the land
regulations adopted there dispersed the settlers, and prevented
combination of capital and labour. <a name="FNanchor_3_96" id=
"FNanchor_3_96"></a><a href="#fn3_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
The demand of the colonists for convicts they treated as a proof
of their contention that no colony with cheap and abundant land
could ever succeed without a supply of forced labour of one kind
or another. To them the Swan River colony was "the scarecrow of
colonization," <a name="FNanchor_3_97" id=
"FNanchor_3_97"></a><a href="#fn3_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
and the system upon which it had been established was the very
antithesis of that which they hoped to introduce into the
proposed new colony of South Australia. They almost welcomed the
experiment as a proof of the futility of trying to colonize by
means of large free land grants, and as affording practical
arguments for the Wakefield theory; <a name="FNanchor_3_98" id=
"FNanchor_3_98"></a><a href="#fn3_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
on the other hand, they considered that its failure had been so
great as to throw a damp on all new projects of colonization,
<a name="FNanchor_3_99" id="FNanchor_3_99"></a><a href="#fn3_99"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a> much in the same way as Wilmot Horton's
plans had resulted in a feeling of repugnance to emigration. At
any rate, they felt that the experiment and its failure placed
them under the necessity of showing cause why free colonization
should not be unsuccessful, and of proving that their plan
contained none of the defects so evident at Swan River. The new
colony, indeed, was the constant butt of Wakefield and his
followers. In nearly all his publications, <a name=
"FNanchor_3_100" id="FNanchor_3_100"></a><a href="#fn3_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a> whether in exposition of his own
theory, or in advocacy of his project for founding South
Australia, the Swan River experiment came in for criticism and
censure. Although, in their main contention of the evil of large
land grants, they were right, yet so persistent were they in
their often exaggerated accounts of the colony, that it is small
wonder the harassed colonists objected to the misrepresentation
of an already hard case. <a name="FNanchor_3_101" id=
"FNanchor_3_101"></a><a href="#fn3_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> Probably the hostility of Wakefield and his
followers, particularly when they were urging the rival claims of
South Australia, had not a little to do with the unpopularity and
retarded progress of Swan River. The truth underlying their
hostility, however, lay in the fact that its failure did
conclusively prove the evil of large free grants of land in a new
colony. This method of colonization, at any rate, was wrong, and
it rested with the new school to propose something better.</p>

helped to change Bentham's opinion on colonies. In 1793 he had
urged that colonies should be emancipated, but in 1829 he
confessed his attitude was just the reverse, "especially, if the
account given of the intended settlement on the <i>Swan River</i>
in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for April, 1829, . . . be
correct." <i>Emancipate your Colonies</i>, published in 1830.

to the property and standing of many of the settlers. See,
<i>e.g</i>., Wakefield's <i>Letter to South Australian
Commissioners</i>, 1835. Acc. and Pap., 1841, Vol. iv. Appendix;
and the first <i>Report of the Western Australian
Association</i>, 1836. Some of them, however, were of a different
kind. A party of intending settlers wrote to Sir George Murray
for information: "Shall we have any Oran Otangs to cope with
there? and are there any wild beasts of pray? We humbly hope you
will excuse our being so explicit, but we are fifteen souls that
would like to know a little before we sell our little all and
start." Messrs. Dalton, Mangell, and Madox to Sir George Murray,

formed a settlement at Portland Bay in what is now Victoria, had
a grant of over 80,000 acres at Swan River. Some of the sons went
there with the intention of settling and preparing for the
immigration of the rest of the family. They brought with them
many labourers and much stock, but after exhaustive searches they
could find no land suitable for farming, and left for Van
Diemen's Land. Thomas Henty (the son) wrote of Swan River: "There
are some spots of good alluvial land, but the country generally
is the reverse of what it is described to be by Mr. Fraser."

advantages are indisputable, whether we consider the expenditure
which of necessity attends a penal establishment, and becomes
diffused among the community; the cheapness with which lands are
cleared, and brought speedily under cultivation; and the facility
afforded for the execution of roads, and other public works. We
believe at least two-thirds of the settlers of Western Australia
are anxious for convict labour; we have never heard a good reason
given by those who oppose the measure. With convict labour this
colony would progress most rapidly; in fact, this alone is wanted
to render it in a very few years a most thriving and prosperous
colony; its natural advantages in soil and climate are
considerable, but for want of cheap labour are scarcely available

<h4>Chapter IV</h4>
<h3>EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD</h3>
<p><span class="a">Edward Gibbon Wakefield</span> was born in
London on March 20th, 1796. He came of Quaker stock, of a family
whose members had been long distinguished in philanthropic and
humanitarian movements. The grandson of Priscilla Wakefield, one
of the first to introduce the savings bank into England, and the
cousin of Elizabeth Fry, he was brought up "in an atmosphere of
aggressive philanthropy." <a name="FNanchor_4_1" id=

father, Edward Wakefield, was an intimate friend of Bentham,
James Mill, and Francis Place, whose enthusiasm for education he
shared. He was the author of some sociological books, of more
than temporary interest, notably one on Ireland. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_2" id="FNanchor_4_2"></a><a href="#fn4_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> Francis Place, indeed, who did not share
Edward Wakefield's high opinion of his son Gibbon, but thought
him "only a common man," <a name="FNanchor_4_3" id=
"FNanchor_4_3"></a><a href="#fn4_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
became estranged from the Wakefield family about 1822. Gibbon
Wakefield, however, necessarily became familiar with the leading
"Benthamites," so that when his "peculiar doctrines" <a name=
"FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#fn4_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> were first broached, he was assured of a
sympathetic hearing, and despite Place's disparagement of his
ability, he gained their influential support. The work of a
clever scapegrace was read by his father's friends, and all
credit was given him for the ideas which it contained.</p>
<p>Up to the beginning of 1826, the only thing he had done to
bring him prominently into the public view was, in 1816, to carry
on a family tradition by making an early marriage&mdash;in his
case a runaway match with a beautiful heiress. Although his wife
was a ward in Chancery, Wakefield was skilful enough to persuade
the Lord Chancellor of the impropriety of interfering with the
marriage. Most of his life, since 1814, he had spent abroad,
chiefly in Italy and in France, engaged in a desultory fashion in
minor diplomatic work. So far he had shown no signs that his
inherited philanthropic instincts were ever going to be
developed.</p>
<p>In 1826, six years after the death of his wife, whether misled
by his former success, or persuaded by the social ambition of a
young step-mother, who wished to see him in Parliament, he made
another runaway match with an heiress, whom he lured away from
school, and deceived into marriage. He was arrested, and tried
for abduction. The only extenuating circumstance in the case was
that the marriage was only nominal; and, in 1827, Wakefield was
sentenced to three years' imprisonment in Newgate, while a
special Act of Parliament was passed to annul the marriage. Every
one agreed that the punishment was not too severe for the crime,
and it left a lasting stain on his reputation. To the British
public he remained for long an object of suspicion, and a
political career seemed definitely closed to him. This part of
his life is not touched on to recall an old scandal, nor even to
show the remarkable effect on his character of the three years'
ordeal in Newgate, but it is necessary to a right understanding
of his interest in colonial matters, and his peculiar position in
regard to them throughout the greater part of his career. The
ghost of Wakefield's past ever stalked before him. Henceforward
the front door of politics was shut to him, though later he
became a constant visitor at other entrances. Sir William
Molesworth, indeed, with his usual courage, in no way dismayed by
Wakefield's damaged reputation, once proposed to co-operate with
Lord Durham in finding a seat in Parliament for him, and even to
assist him by financial and personal support. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#fn4_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> But Wakefield could have been <i>persona
grata</i> neither to party managers, nor to constituents, and the
well-meant proposal was never carried out. Not only was this
opening denied to him, but he was looked upon as unworthy of
trust in other public positions. For example, when chosen by Lord
Durham as one of his assistants in the memorable mission to
Canada in 1838, he was to have been appointed Commissioner of
Crown Lands, but Lord Melbourne, remembering Newgate, objected,
and he had to be content to carry on his important work in Canada
in an unofficial, and at the time, unacknowledged, position.
<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#fn4_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This enforced avoidance of public notice
is further illustrated by the fact that most of his very numerous
writings were anonymous. Of his important works on colonization,
the only one which bears his name on the title page is his last,
the <i>Art of Colonization</i>, published in 1849, twenty years
after his first work on colonial topics appeared. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_7" id="FNanchor_4_7"></a><a href="#fn4_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p>His exclusion from Parliament enabled him to concentrate the
whole of his truly great energies on the one, subject of
colonization. As a Member of Parliament, able and ambitious, his
attention must necessarily have been distracted by other
questions of greater importance and of more local interest.
Colonial questions must have taken a subordinate, if prominent,
place with him; and, as a mere matter of physical capacity, he
could never have stood the strain of adding the ordinary duties
of a Member of Parliament to his incessant labour of mind, pen
and tongue in the service of the colonies.</p>
<p>His imprisonment was the turning point in his career. Rising
superior to his disgrace, he surprised every one by proving
himself a man of ideas, and an ardent and successful propagandist
of a new theory. He turned his attention to colonies and
colonization, perhaps because he felt that they offered the best
opportunity for mending his shattered fortunes; <a name=
"FNanchor_4_8" id="FNanchor_4_8"></a><a href="#fn4_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> perhaps because they furnished an unexampled
opportunity for theorizing and for action; perhaps, again, it was
the natural connection between the population of Newgate and the
convict colony of New South Wales which first led him in this
direction. For whatever reason, he began to study colonial
questions, and he read particularly what literature he could
obtain about Australia. "Whilst in Newgate," he wrote in 1831, "I
had occasion to read with care every book concerning New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land, as well as a long series of
newspapers published in those colonies." <a name="FNanchor_4_9"
id="FNanchor_4_9"></a><a href="#fn4_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
An outcast from society, with a character to remake and a
reputation to establish, he was in a position to take a
peculiarly detached view of any subject. He owed allegiance to no
school of thought, and had little reason to conciliate any.
Although by upbringing and by conviction associated with the
Benthamite group, he did not scruple to attack their views on
colonies voiced by Bentham and James Mill, in so far as they
conflicted with his own. <a name="FNanchor_4_10" id=
"FNanchor_4_10"></a><a href="#fn4_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p>But there was, indeed, little existing theory to guide him. As
he wrote in 1849 of colonization, "That subject presented before
1830 one very remarkable feature, namely, an immense amount of
practice without any theory . . . . There were long experience
without a system, immense results without a plan, vast doings but
no principles." <a name="FNanchor_4_11" id=
"FNanchor_4_11"></a><a href="#fn4_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
It has been said that his theory occurred to him when examining
the regulations made in January, 1829, by the Colonial Office for
the new colony of Swan River. <a name="FNanchor_4_12" id=
"FNanchor_4_12"></a><a href="#fn4_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Certainly he used this colony's early failure to point out the
moral of the futility of large land grants. Probably, too, from
the frequent reference he makes to it, <a name="FNanchor_4_13"
id="FNanchor_4_13"></a><a href="#fn4_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a> the Report of the Select Committee of the
House of Commons in 1829, on Canadian affairs, set him thinking
on the problem of the disposal of colonial waste lands.</p>
<p>It is impossible to proceed to an examination of Wakefield's
theories and of the enormous influence which he exerted both at
home and in the colonies, without some attempt at an estimate of
his character.</p>
<p>This extraordinary man, who, handicapped by a notoriety
heavier to bear than mere obscurity, virtually originated a new
era of colonization, and furnished the inspiration for a new
colonial policy, possessed both force and complexity of
character. Energetic, persevering, and courageous, he was at the
same time unscrupulous. An adroit wire-puller and an adept
schemer, he was not always careful in his choice of means either
of overcoming opposition, or of compelling adherence, to his
plans. With a ready pen and an eloquent tongue, he was an expert
in the art of controlling and managing men. "Edward Gibbon
Wakefield," wrote one who knew him well, "was a master in the art
of persuading. He seldom failed if he could get his victim into
conversation." <a name="FNanchor_4_14" id=
"FNanchor_4_14"></a><a href="#fn4_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
When he wished to gain an end, the obligation of truth sat, at
times, very lightly upon him. Despite this, he was not a
self-seeker. While his dearest wish was for "the utmost happiness
which God vouchsafes to man on earth, the realization of his own
idea," <a name="FNanchor_4_15" id="FNanchor_4_15"></a><a href=
"#fn4_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> it was not for his own
personal glory, but for the benefit of mother-country and colony.
Although a natural desire to rehabilitate his character weighed
with him at first, this was soon merged in a larger aspiration
for the well-being of the race at home and abroad. True, he
invested money in his colonial projects, and urged his friends to
do likewise, but it was rather to help on the cause than for a
hope of profit. Indeed, on one New Zealand scheme he spent what
was, for a poor man, quite a considerable sum in defraying
expenses, and refused to take any compensation. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_16" id="FNanchor_4_16"></a><a href="#fn4_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a> Such a suggestion as Mr. Dandeson Coates, the
secretary of the Church Missionary Society, made in 1837, that
Wakefield was expecting an appointment as chief administrative
officer in New Zealand, <a name="FNanchor_4_17" id=
"FNanchor_4_17"></a><a href="#fn4_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
with the innuendo that this explained his efforts in that
direction, was, as Wakefield justly called it, "ungenerous and
unnecessary." <a name="FNanchor_4_18" id=
"FNanchor_4_18"></a><a href="#fn4_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Even more unfair is the assertion of another opponent, that "Mr.
Wakefield, while his disciples have suffered in purse and in
person, has contrived to . . . build a living, if not a fortune,
out of a series of bubbles." <a name="FNanchor_4_19" id=
"FNanchor_4_19"></a><a href="#fn4_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p>Wakefield's temperament, which was at once sanguine and
over-suspicious, led him into many errors. To those of narrower
and less clear vision than himself he appeared as a "cold-blooded
schemer and manipulator of puppets for selfish ends." <a name=
"FNanchor_4_20" id="FNanchor_4_20"></a><a href="#fn4_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a> To those who could appreciate the loftiness
of his aims and the difficulties with which he had to contend, he
appeared as the regenerator of colonial policy, and the apostle
of colonial freedom. Lamentably certain it is that he quarrelled
with many of his colleagues in colonizing enterprises, and was
ousted from a leading place both in the South Australian and the
New Zealand schemes; but the implicit confidence reposed in him
by such men as Lord Durham, Charles Buller, and Sir William
Molesworth, all his pupils in colonial matters, is a striking and
conclusive testimony to his worth.</p>
<p>Wakefield remained in Newgate prison until May, 1830, and his
first writing on colonization took the form of an anonymous
pamphlet, entitled <i>Sketch of a Proposal for Colonizing
Australasia</i>. It was printed, but not published, in the early
part of the year 1829, <a name="FNanchor_4_21" id=
"FNanchor_4_21"></a><a href="#fn4_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and contained, with some explanatory comment, an outline of what
afterwards became famous as the Wakefield theory. Very soon,
however, he decided to clothe his views in a more attractive form
in order to arrest the attention of readers little interested
either in colonies or in speculative theory. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_22" id="FNanchor_4_22"></a><a href="#fn4_22" class=
"fnanchor">[22]</a> In this he was extraordinarily successful. He
began a series of eleven <i>Letters from Sydney</i>, which
appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> during the months of
August, September, and October, 1829. These letters purported to
relate the experiences of an actual settler in New South Wales,
and are written in a lively and picturesque style, which produced
a "sensation in the literary and political world of London."
<a name="FNanchor_4_23" id="FNanchor_4_23"></a><a href="#fn4_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Acting on the advice of a leader in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, Wakefield republished these letters in
book form before the end of the year, under the title of <i>A
Letter from Sydney</i>. He allowed the book to appear without an
author's name, but as "edited by Robert Gouger." <a name=
"FNanchor_4_24" id="FNanchor_4_24"></a><a href="#fn4_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a> In an appendix to the <i>Letter from
Sydney</i> appeared, in a slightly modified form, the proposals
of his earlier pamphlet for colonizing Australasia.</p>
<p>The vividness of the picture which he drew, and his close
attention to details, deceived many into thinking that the
letters were really the work of a colonist, or, at any rate, of
one who had visited New South Wales. <a name="FNanchor_4_25" id=
"FNanchor_4_25"></a><a href="#fn4_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Not only were his contemporaries deceived, but, even in 1872, Mr.
George Ranken, a fierce opponent of the Wakefield theory, wrote,
"Mr. Gibbon Wakefield had some years before visited this part of
the world, and on his return to England he published certain
views which he had formed." <a name="FNanchor_4_26" id=
"FNanchor_4_26"></a><a href="#fn4_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
To those, indeed, who had read the letters as they appeared in
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, it could have been no secret that
they were written in England, and were only the vehicle for the
expression of a new theory and plan of colonization. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_27" id="FNanchor_4_27"></a><a href="#fn4_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a> But one example will serve to show how
thoroughly Wakefield had projected himself into the feelings of
an actual colonist. It will show, too, the easy style and
deftness of touch which, at the time, created such an impression,
and which makes his book even now a delight to read.</p>
<blockquote>"Just before I embarked at Plymouth, I visited my
grandmother, in order to take leave of her for ever. Poor old
soul! she wras already dead to the concerns of this life; my
departure could make but little difference in the time of our
separation, and in regard to her affection for me, it could be of
no importance to her which of us should quit the other. My
resolution, however, revived for a day all her woman's feelings.
She shed abundance of tears, and then became extremely curious to
know every particular about the place to which I was going. I
rubbed her spectacles whilst she wiped her eyes, and having
placed before her a common English chart of the world, pointed
out the situation of New Holland. She shook her head. 'What
displeases you, my dear madam?' said I. 'Why,' she answered, 'it
is terribly out of the way&mdash;down in the very right hand
corner of the world.' The chart being mine, I cut it in two
through the meridian of Iceland, transposed the parts laterally,
and turned them upside down. 'Now,' asked I, 'where is England?'
'Ah! boy,' she replied, 'you may do what you like with the map;
but you can't twist the world about in that manner, though they
are making sad changes in it.'" <a name="FNanchor_4_28" id=
"FNanchor_4_28"></a><a href="#fn4_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a></blockquote>
<p>Another instance will show his power of clear vision and his
ability to reason from analogy and to grip the essential facts of
conditions which he had not actually experienced. He argues the
necessity for irrigation in Australia on the analogy of Italy,
and gives the reason why little use had hitherto been made of it.
"Englishmen being used at home to consider water an enemy, and to
exercise much skill in getting rid of it, are ignorant of the
means by which, in countries where the sun exerts great power,
water becomes the first agent of production." <a name=
"FNanchor_4_29" id="FNanchor_4_29"></a><a href="#fn4_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a> It is only in comparatively recent years that
the necessity for irrigation has been properly realized in
Australia.</p>
<p>The <i>Letter from Sydney</i> had a dual aspect. In the first
place it gave a vivid picture of the economic, social, and
political conditions of New South Wales; in the second place it
suggested a remedy.</p>
<p>Writing from the point of view of a settler who had obtained a
large grant of fertile land at a nominal price, and who wished to
employ his capital upon it, Wakefield described the paradoxical
position in which he found himself. His land was worse than
useless to him, he could neither keep nor sell it. Land he had,
capital he had, but labour was wanting. There was, indeed, one
kind of labour; that of convicts, but it was unsatisfactory in
many ways. "Not the slightest dependence can be placed on convict
labour as a permanent source of wealth. You may obtain, though
not without trouble, one, two, or perhaps three convicts, for a
term of a few years; but that they will rob you is almost
certain; that they will murder you, is by no means improbable;
and that their labour will not be very profitable, is beyond a
doubt." <a name="FNanchor_4_30" id="FNanchor_4_30"></a><a href=
"#fn4_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p>Convict labour was also uncertain because it was doled out, or
withheld arbitrarily by the Government. <a name="FNanchor_4_31"
id="FNanchor_4_31"></a><a href="#fn4_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a> Moreover, its supply was necessarily limited.
"If, for every acre of land that may be appropriated here, there
should be a conviction for felony in England, our prosperity
would rest on a solid basis; but, however earnestly we may desire
it, we cannot expect that the increase of crime will keep pace
with the spread of colonization." <a name="FNanchor_4_32" id=
"FNanchor_4_32"></a><a href="#fn4_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>The imaginary colonist had tried to overcome the labour
difficulty by importing labourers from England; but he found that
this was of no avail, as they were enticed away either by higher
wages elsewhere, or by the prospect of becoming landowners almost
at once. This brought him to the cause of his failure as a
landowner. "At length the true light broke upon me. The
<i>scarcity of labourers</i> was an insuperable bar to any mode
of cultivation that requires the employment of many hands!"
<a name="FNanchor_4_33" id="FNanchor_4_33"></a><a href="#fn4_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It was not merely higher wages or
dearness of labour, but "an absolute want of labourers at any
rate of wages." <a name="FNanchor_4_34" id=
"FNanchor_4_34"></a><a href="#fn4_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
This he attributed to the immense proportion which land bore to
people, due to the facility with which land could be obtained by
anyone. For example, "The once indented labourer obtains six
shillings a day; saves half his earnings; obtains a grant of
land; and becomes an employer of labour, and a competitor with
his late master in the market of industry. This, of course,
raises the price of labour to all." <a name="FNanchor_4_35" id=
"FNanchor_4_35"></a><a href="#fn4_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
From this, too, flowed most of the social evils he remarks in New
South Wales. The colonists were a "new people," not only new as
to settlement, but a people who "make no progress in the art of
living; who, in respect to wealth, knowledge, skill, taste, and
whatever belongs to civilization, have degenerated from their
ancestors." <a name="FNanchor_4_36" id=
"FNanchor_4_36"></a><a href="#fn4_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In addition, the colony suffered peculiar evils from the system
of transportation, which was really the only system of
colonization pursued in New South Wales. He fully appreciated its
value as the only means of prosperity. "We owe everything, over
and above mere subsistence, to the wickedness of the people of
England. Who built Sydney? Convicts. Who made the excellent roads
from Sydney to Parramatta, Windsor, and Liverpool? Convicts. By
whom is the land made to produce? By convicts. Why do not all our
labourers exact high wages, and, by taking a large share of the
produce of labour, prevent their employers from becoming rich?
Because most of them are convicts. What has enabled the landowner
readily to dispose of his surplus produce? The demand of the
keepers of convicts. What has brought so many ships to Port
Jackson, and occasioned a further demand for agricultural
produce? The transportation of convicts. What has tempted free
emigrants to bring capital into the settlement? The true story
that they heard of fortunes made by employing the cheap labour of
convicts." <a name="FNanchor_4_37" id=
"FNanchor_4_37"></a><a href="#fn4_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
But the moral evils of transportation outweighed its economic
good. Neither life nor property was secure; transportation had
the corrupting influence of bad example on the rest of the
colonists, gave to employers the character and habits of
slave-owners, and accentuated and perpetuated the enormous
disproportion between the sexes, "the greatest evil of all."
<a name="FNanchor_4_38" id="FNanchor_4_38"></a><a href="#fn4_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> With all its advantages transportation
should be abolished, as it was unfair both to the free emigrant
and to the freeborn native. "If the law should direct all rogues
convicted in Yorkshire to be domiciliated in Kent, would not the
men of Kent complain, and with truth, of a shameful violation of
their birth-right?" <a name="FNanchor_4_39" id=
"FNanchor_4_39"></a><a href="#fn4_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p>The remedy he proposed for this state of affairs was his
system of colonization, which was to strike at the root of the
evil, and, by a restrictive price, to alter the proportion of
people to land. This theory will be best discussed as a whole
after some mention of his other works on colonization.</p>
<p>The <i>Letter from Sydney</i> suffered from the defects of its
form. Written as a popular setting to a novel theory of
colonization, it made no pretence at being a scientific statement
either of the causes and remedies of pauperism and distress in
England, or of the evils of colonization and their remedy. There
was no analysis of the conditions of the mother-country, except
in incidental references to the surplus population, which might
be more profitably employed in New South Wales. On the suggestion
of Bentham, <a name="FNanchor_4_40" id=
"FNanchor_4_40"></a><a href="#fn4_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
who had found some difficulty in pursuing the theory through the
number of pamphlets which had followed the <i>Letter from
Sydney</i>, Wakefield decided to issue his plan in a more
pretentious form, showing its basis in economic theory, and its
relation to social and economic conditions, both in England and
in the colonies. The outcome was his <i>England and America</i>
published anonymously in 1833, and in many ways the most
important of his works. During his constant labours of twenty
years from 1829, this book formed the only systematic exposition
of his theory. It met with much favourable comment. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_41" id="FNanchor_4_41"></a><a href="#fn4_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a> On its publication Mr. Poulett Scrope wrote
to the author, "I cannot remember ever reading any work with
greater interest, or more thoroughly going along with any author
in his views, opinions, and sentiments, than I have done on this
occasion. I have been long a zealous friend of colonization . . .
but the notions which were but vaguely floating in my mind, I
find methodized and arranged in a more lucid and convincing order
in your work." <a name="FNanchor_4_42" id=
"FNanchor_4_42"></a><a href="#fn4_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The title is rather misleading, for the book only compares
certain aspects of the two countries, and is mainly concerned
with colonization. For this Wakefield blames the publisher who,
"in the author's absence from England, took on himself to give
the puffing title of <i>England and America</i>." <a name=
"FNanchor_4_43" id="FNanchor_4_43"></a><a href="#fn4_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a></p>
<p>His intention was, "first, to lay before Americans a sketch of
the political conditions of England, and before the English an
explanation of some peculiarities in the social state of America;
secondly, to point at the means of removing those causes, which
are productive of great evils to both countries." <a name=
"FNanchor_4_44" id="FNanchor_4_44"></a><a href="#fn4_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p>The first part of the book, which consists of rather desultory
notes on various loosely connected social and political topics,
analyses the condition of England. The second and more important
part considers colonization as a remedy.</p>
<p>Between 1829 and 1849 he published various writings on
colonization, too numerous for separate mention. <a name=
"FNanchor_4_45" id="FNanchor_4_45"></a><a href="#fn4_45" class=
"fnanchor">[45]</a> In originating and defending projects for new
colonies, in propagating his theory, answering objections and
overcoming opposition, he wrote or inspired, not only pamphlets,
but articles, paragraphs, "puffs" and letters for various
newspapers, especially for the <i>Spectator</i>. Another
important source of information for the Wakefield theory is his
evidence before Parliamentary Committees, particularly those on
Waste Lands in 1836, <a name="FNanchor_4_46" id=
"FNanchor_4_46"></a><a href="#fn4_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
South Australia in 1841, <a name="FNanchor_4_47" id=
"FNanchor_4_47"></a><a href="#fn4_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
and New Zealand in 1840. <a name="FNanchor_4_48" id=
"FNanchor_4_48"></a><a href="#fn4_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
In 1849 he published his final work, <i>A View of the Art of
Colonization</i>. Among his reasons for writing it was the wish
to make clear his own position in regard to the colonial
achievements of the past twenty years. In the first place he
wished to dispel the false impression given by his silence, that
he approved of several things that had been done by Government in
colonization. <a name="FNanchor_4_49" id=
"FNanchor_4_49"></a><a href="#fn4_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
<i>e.g</i>., the plan of auction, and the application of a price
to pastoral lands. In the next place, he was anxious, after years
of silence and anonymous work, "to establish my claim to the real
authorship of most of what has been done with respect to
colonization" <a name="FNanchor_4_50" id=
"FNanchor_4_50"></a><a href="#fn4_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
since 1830. His main reason, however, was to produce a treatise
setting forth his views on colonization in their final form. In
the same spirit that Bentham had complained to Wakefield in 1830,
John Stuart Mill wrote to him in 1848, "I have long regretted
that there does not exist a systematic treatise in a permanent
form, from your hand and in your name, in which the whole subject
of colonization is treated as the express subject of the book, so
as to become at once the authoritative book on the subject. At
present, people have to <i>pick up</i> your doctrines, both
theoretical and practical." <a name="FNanchor_4_51" id=
"FNanchor_4_51"></a><a href="#fn4_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The book, however, disappoints this expectation. In the
restatement of his views there is little new; but the form which
the book takes, that of letters between a statesman and a
colonist (Wakefield himself), is ill-adapted to a scientific
exposition of his theory. It is largely occupied, too, with
lively attacks on the Colonial Office, and on Lord Grey, whom he
credits with a personal antipathy to him. Grey in office is a
different man from Howick out of office. As the <i>Spectator</i>
put it. Lord Grey's "favourite antagonist is Lord Howick."

occupy far too much space in a formal treatise, though they
furnish the opportunity for an important and interesting account
of the achievements of himself and his followers in colonial
matters from 1830.</p>

Wakefield's identity as the author of the new theory of
colonization was well hidden for a year or two from the public
and even from the Colonial Office. In 1831, Robert Gouger, who
was then, and later, Wakefield's mouthpiece, revealed the secret
to the Colonial Office in a letter which is worth rescuing from
oblivion. Gouger wrote to T. F. Elliot of the Colonial Office:
"You are aware I have always declined giving the name of my
friend the author of the plan of colonization to which I have
been so much attached, and which I have endeavoured to work upon
the attention of the Government rather assiduously. I am now at
Uberty to reveal his name and do it to you with great pleasure,
as you may perhaps be glad to make use of his very extensive
knowledge of colonization generally. It is Mr. Edward G.
Wakefield, the author of a book just published on the Punishment
of Death, and whose name you must remember to have heard of in
connection with the abduction of Miss Turner some years since. I
am very glad to be able to make this communication, as it does
away with any unpleasant feeling of 'false position' I may have
entertained relative to my own connection with this subject. The
cause of retaining the author's name will now readily suggest
itself to you." Gouger to Elliot, July 29th, 1831. C.O.

<h4>Chapter V</h4>
<h3>THE WAKEFIELD THEORY OF COLONIZATION <small><a name=
"FNanchor_5_1" id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#fn5_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></small></h3>
<p><span class="a">In</span> essence the Wakefield theory was a
plan or system for remedying existing evils in the colonies and
in the mother-country, with a view to the prosperity of both.</p>
<p>In <i>England and America</i> (1833) he drew a vivid picture
of the great wealth of England, the abundance of capital, and the
ease with which there, as contrasted with America, funds were
raised for any undertaking that offered an opportunity of profit.
Coincident with this was great misery amongst the bulk of the
people, condemned to wretchedness and pauperism by the fact that
their wages were forced down to a minimum by the overstocking of
the labour market. Also he found what he called the uneasiness of
the middle class&mdash;that is a constant perplexing struggle
among those engaged in trades and professions, to live on their
earnings, to provide for their children, and to maintain their
rank and respectability, when profit, interest, and wages were
all low.</p>
<p>Searching for a cause for this coincidence, he disagreed with
those economists, who laid it down that profits rise as wages
fall and, conversely, wages rise as profits fall. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_2" id="FNanchor_5_2"></a><a href="#fn5_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> They have, he urged, paid too much attention
to the <i>relative</i> share of labour and capital from
production, and not sufficient to the <i>absolute</i> amount
which each receives. He found in England the phenomenon of low
wages and low profits, in America that of high wages and high
profits. Admitting that in England there was great competition
between capital and between labourers, and in America rather
less, the true explanation was, he thought, that "the field of
employment" was more limited in England than in America. There
was more capital and labour in England than could be
satisfactorily employed there, because of the limited amount of
land, while in America, owing to the superabundance of fertile
land, the reverse was the case. In this way he arrived at his
chief contrast between the two countries&mdash;superfluity of
labour and capital in the one, and of land in the other.</p>
<p>The importance of the "field of employment," he thought, had
been altogether neglected by the economists. "The modern
economists, in treating of the production and distribution of
wealth, have overlooked the chief element of production, namely,
the field in which capital and labour are employed." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_3" id="FNanchor_5_3"></a><a href="#fn5_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> He was inclined to consider the importance of
the "field of employment" as a discovery in political economy
<a name="FNanchor_5_4" id="FNanchor_5_4"></a><a href="#fn5_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the utmost value both in
understanding the reason for the poverty and distress only too
evident in England, and in pointing the way to the proper remedy.
Admitting the rapid increase both of population and of capital
after the peace of 1815, he pointed out that both had increased
relatively to the means of their employment. This changed
relation he singled out as the prime cause of all the evils
observed in England. "Not only the coincidence of misery and
uneasiness with enormous wealth, but all the most striking social
peculiarities of England, may be traced to a superabundance of
capital and population in proportion to the means of employing
capital and labour." <a name="FNanchor_5_5" id=
"FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#fn5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p>Many would have agreed with him as to the redundancy of
population, but it was a novel theory that there could be a
superfluity of capital without high wages.</p>
<p>Turning to America, the position was reversed, one element of
production, land, being in excess, and the other two, capital and
labour, in great demand. In this fact he found the origin of
slavery, which, viewed in this light, ceased to be an
extraordinary and unaccountable anomaly. When land was
superabundant it was impossible to get any other kind of labour.
The prosperity of America was due to slave labour in the same
manner as that of New South Wales was due to convict labour.
"That superabundance of land to which the English economists,
from Adam Smith downwards, attribute the prosperity of new
colonies, has never led to great prosperity without some kind of
slavery." <a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href=
"#fn5_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p>Colonization he defined as "the removal of people from an old
to a new country, and the settlement of people on the waste land
of the new country." <a name="FNanchor_5_7" id=
"FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#fn5_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
two chief elements of colonization, he always insisted, were
waste land and emigration, and of these the former was more
important. He applied the term colonization equally to the
settlement of Canada or of Australia by England, and to the
settlement of the Western lands of America by the Eastern States.
In colonization both old and new countries would find their
remedy&mdash;what one lacked the other could give.</p>
<p>The end and aim of colonization for an old country, he
premised was "a progressive enlargement, partly domestic, and
partly colonial, of the field for employing capital and labour."
<a name="FNanchor_5_8" id="FNanchor_5_8"></a><a href="#fn5_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This he considered under three
heads&mdash;the advantage resulting to an old country from:</p>
<div class="indent">1. Extension of markets for surplus
produce.<br>
2. Relief from excessive numbers.<br>
3. Enlargement of the field for employing capital.</div>
<p>Under the first head he pointed out how necessary it is for a
manufacturing country, which has been driven by extension of its
industry towards cultivating inferior lands, to obtain a cheap
corn supply by the exchange of its manufactured goods. Assuming
the necessity of abolishing restrictive corn laws, he emphasized
the advantages in the production of cheap corn which were
possessed by a country with an abundance of fertile land. The
best, if not the only way of ensuring this supply in return for
manufactured goods, was, he considered, by planting new colonies
or by extending old ones. These, from their connection with the
mother-country and community of tastes, would both produce a
sufficient corn supply, and willingly exchange it for the goods
of the mother-country.</p>
<p>Even assuming that an independent State was as good a market
as a colony, there were no sufficient markets available in
existing independent States, so that it was necessary that new
colonies should be founded, and existing colonies extended and
made more prosperous. <a name="FNanchor_5_9" id=
"FNanchor_5_9"></a><a href="#fn5_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p>Under the second head he adverted to the almost universally
admitted fact of redundancy of population in England since the
peace of 1815. An obvious method of relief would seem to be
emigration and colonization. But, although some small attempts
had been made in this way (by Mr. Wilmot Horton), they had
invariably been costly and unsuccessful, and the remedy had never
been seriously considered by politicians. Opposition to
colonization came from two very different schools of thought.
First, there were men of the Sadler type, who "would determine
questions in political economy by quoting scripture." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_10" id="FNanchor_5_10"></a><a href="#fn5_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> In the opinion of this school, there could be
no overpopulation, and if the best use were made of lands at home
there would be no complaints of unemployment. Next, there were
those economists like Bentham and James Mill, who made a fetish
of capital. They were afraid that colonization would mean a waste
of capital, and therefore a diminution of employment at home. The
opposition of the first school, Wakefield swept away by answering
their "Dwell in the land and verily ye shall be fed," with
another scriptural quotation, "Increase and multiply, and
replenish the earth, and subdue it." <a name="FNanchor_5_11" id=
"FNanchor_5_11"></a><a href="#fn5_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Against the more serious contention of the economists he appealed
to facts, pointing to the great accumulation of capital in
England, which, for want of employment at home, either lay idle,
or was wasted in ruinous speculation. The cost of emigration,
indeed, might be defrayed out of this capital without interfering
with the amount used for employment at home. He was careful,
however, to avoid recommending any such outlay, as his scheme
contemplated something different; but he wished to remove an
initial prejudice against colonization on the ground that it
meant loss of that capital which was necessary for employment at
home, "a prejudice, which stops him who entertains it, on the
very threshold of this subject." <a name="FNanchor_5_12" id=
"FNanchor_5_12"></a><a href="#fn5_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
He found that the fallacy of the economists lay in one grand
<i>non sequitur</i>, "It does not follow that, because labour is
employed by capital, capital always finds a field in which to
employ labour." <a name="FNanchor_5_13" id=
"FNanchor_5_13"></a><a href="#fn5_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p>Other minor ends served by colonization, which would be likely
to appeal to the English public, were the relief of the poor rate
by the emigration of paupers, the direction of the tide of Irish
emigration from England to the colonies, and the checking of the
over-competition for employment which affected all classes.</p>
<p>At the time of his writing <i>England and America</i> the Poor
Law Commission or 1832 was receiving that mass of evidence as to
the pauperism and degradation of the English labourer which led
to the New Poor Law of 1834. Edwin Chadwick, the secretary to the
Commission, had formerly been secretary to Bentham, and Wakefield
could not but be aware of the character of the evidence
collected.</p>
<p>Under the third head he pointed out that colonization offered
a secure investment for English capital, for which at present
there was no profitable employment at home.</p>
<p>The advantages of colonization to a colony were easily dealt
with. Colonies needed both labour and capital to extend their
industries and to increase their wealth and greatness. They
needed, also, manufactured goods in return for their raw produce.
For this they looked to the mother-country to supply that free
labour which is "the great want of colonies." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_14" id="FNanchor_5_14"></a><a href="#fn5_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p>Having analysed in this way the condition of England and of
the colonies, in order to show the advantages to both of
colonization, he proceeded to the problem of how best to
colonize. His answer was a complete theory, social, political,
and economic.</p>
<p>If a colony was to be prosperous it must exhibit the phenomena
of high wages and high profits. Labour, as he had shown, was the
greatest need of the colonies, as its redundancy was the greatest
evil of the mother-country. But, if a colony could be made
prosperous, there would be little difficulty in attracting
labourers. How, then, could the existing colonies be made more
prosperous so as to become markets for the mother-country,
receiving her manufactures and her surplus labour? One thing only
was needed&mdash;a good system of disposing of colonial waste
lands. Waste land was the chief element in colonization. The lack
of "combinable labour" in colonies, that is, a supply of labour
sufficient in amount to allow of the advantages of a combination
of labour and a division of employments, <a name="FNanchor_5_15"
id="FNanchor_5_15"></a><a href="#fn5_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> was a bar to capitalistic production. This
operated to produce poverty and barbarism, which rendered
colonies unattractive both to the capitalist and to the better
class of emigrant, to the former because his capital was useless,
to the latter because he was unwilling to deprive himself, by
emigration, of the benefits of civilization. This lack of labour
was, in his opinion, entirely due to the superabundance and
cheapness of land in the colonies. The existing system of grant
or sale at a low price gave to labourers too much facility for
becoming landowners. Here he quarrelled with Adam Smith, who had
said that cheapness and abundance of land was one of the chief
causes of prosperity in new colonies. "The colony," Adam Smith
had said, "of a civilized nation which takes possession either of
a waste country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives
easily give place to the new settlers, advances more rapidly to
wealth and greatness than any other human society . . . .</p>
<p>"Every colonist gets more land than he can possibly cultivate.
He has no rent, and scarce any taxes to pay. No landlord shares
with him in its produce, and the share of the sovereign is
commonly but a trifle. He has every motive to render as great as
possible a produce, which is thus to be almost entirely his own.
But his land is commonly so extensive that, with all his own
industry, and with all the industry of other people whom he can
get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of
what it is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to
collect labourers from all quarters, and to reward them with the
most liberal wages. But those liberal wages, joined to the plenty
and cheapness of land, soon make those labourers leave him, in
order to become landlords themselves, and to reward, with equal
liberality, other labourers, who soon leave them for the same
reason that they left their first master. The liberal reward of
labour encourages marriage. The children, during the tender years
of infancy, are well fed and properly taken care of, and when
they are grown up the value of their labour greatly overpays
their maintenance. When arrived at maturity, the high price of
labour, and the low price of land, enable them to establish
themselves in the same manner as their fathers did before
them.</p>
<p>"In other countries rent and profit eat up wages, and the two
superior orders of people oppress the inferior one. But in new
colonies the interest of the superior orders obliges them to
treat the inferior one with more generosity and humanity; at
least where that inferior one is not in a state of slavery. Waste
lands of the greatest natural fertility are to be had for a
trifle. The increase of revenue which the proprietor, who is
always the undertaker, expects from their improvement,
constitutes his profit which in these circumstances is commonly
very great. But this great profit cannot be made without
employing the labour of other people in clearing and cultivating
the land; and the disproportion between the great extent of the
land and the small number of the people, which commonly takes
place in new colonies, makes it difficult for him to get this
labour. He does not, therefore, dispute about wages, but is
willing to employ labour at any price. The high wages of labour
encourage population. The cheapness and plenty of good land
encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to pay those
high wages. In those wages consists almost the whole price of
land; and though they are high considered as the wages of labour,
they are low considered as the price of what is so very valuable.
What encourages the progress of population and improvement
encourages that of real wealth and greatness.</p>
<p>". . . Plenty of good land, and liberty to manage their
affairs their own way, seem to be the two great causes of the
prosperity of all new colonies." <a name="FNanchor_5_16" id=
"FNanchor_5_16"></a><a href="#fn5_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Wakefield held that cheapness and plenty
caused an extreme disproportion between people and land, which
could only be cured by some system of restricting the amount of
available land. This might only be done by the Government, under
whose control were the unappropriated waste lands of the
colonies. Once waste lands were appropriated they entered the
"field of employment," which should be large, but not too large
compared with population and capital, and capable of increase
when necessary. It followed, then, that the chief business which
Government had in colonizing was to secure this object by
granting, or withholding, titles to waste lands as might be
necessary. "The action of the two exertions of power together may
be compared to that of an elastic belt, which, though always
tight, will always yield to pressure from within." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_17" id="FNanchor_5_17"></a><a href="#fn5_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p>There were three possible ways of doing this. In the first
place the Government might make grants of land subject to
conditions of quit-rent or of cultivation which should aim at
causing the cultivation of all land appropriated. All such
conditions, however, had proved in practice to be useless. Grants
were taken, and the conditions remained unfulfilled. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_18" id="FNanchor_5_18"></a><a href="#fn5_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p>In the next place the Government might issue a grant subject
to a tax (with forfeiture for non-payment) large enough to make
it not worth while to take up a grant except with a view to its
cultivation. This, however, was difficult to execute, and, at the
best, was rather curing than preventing the evil.</p>
<p>In the third place the Government might demand a ready-money
payment for each grant made, at a price high enough to prevent
people taking too much land, and, at the same time, not too high
to prevent those who were able and willing, from using it. If the
price were too high it would prevent the necessary expansion of
the field of employment; the restriction would resemble a "wall
of brass," <a name="FNanchor_5_19" id=
"FNanchor_5_19"></a><a href="#fn5_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and not an "elastic belt." Two extremes had to be avoided in
imposing a price: first, making it so low that it was really no
restriction; secondly, raising it so high that it discouraged
voluntary-emigration. <a name="FNanchor_5_20" id=
"FNanchor_5_20"></a><a href="#fn5_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The advantages possessed by this method of restriction over all
others, were its fairness to all concerned, who were put on an
equal footing in obtaining land, its simplicity, and its absolute
certainty. <a name="FNanchor_5_21" id=
"FNanchor_5_21"></a><a href="#fn5_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p>In effect, the price was to be a restriction sufficient to
adapt the supply of land to the supply of labour. "The plan of
selling contains within itself an effectual regulator of the
quantity disposed of." <a name="FNanchor_5_22" id=
"FNanchor_5_22"></a><a href="#fn5_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A
due proportion between land and labour would be obtained in this
way, because such a price would ensure a supply of combinable
labour in the colony by keeping labourers working as wage-earners
for a considerable period before they became owners of land. "The
sole object of a price is to prevent labourers from turning into
landowners too soon: the price must be sufficient for that one
purpose, and no other." <a name="FNanchor_5_23" id=
"FNanchor_5_23"></a><a href="#fn5_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p>Restriction in itself was not desirable, except as a means to
this end. "I think restriction in itself an evil. I would propose
some degree of restriction with a view to one object, and one
object only," <a name="FNanchor_5_24" id=
"FNanchor_5_24"></a><a href="#fn5_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
namely, to secure combinable labour.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that his object in proposing a price
on waste land was to prevent labourers from ever becoming
landowners. On the contrary it was an essential part of his
system that their period of labour should be limited, and should
be only a stage on the way to landed proprietorship. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_25" id="FNanchor_5_25"></a><a href="#fn5_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a> It will be evident, later, that upon their
acquisition of land depended in some measure the progressive
character of his scheme for aided-emigration. Again one of his
main objections to raising the price beyond what he thought
sufficient, or to using the plan of sale by auction, was that it
would compel a labourer to work for a longer period and thus cast
the burden of a tax upon the class least able to bear it.
<a name="FNanchor_5_26" id="FNanchor_5_26"></a><a href="#fn5_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Although he objected to being called
upon to fix a period during which a labourer should be compelled
to work, he considered that three, or at the most four, years
would be long enough. <a name="FNanchor_5_27" id=
"FNanchor_5_27"></a><a href="#fn5_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p>The Wakefield system is usually considered to have meant
"high" prices on land, but he strenuously objected to this
terminology. <a name="FNanchor_5_28" id=
"FNanchor_5_28"></a><a href="#fn5_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
If the price fulfilled its one object it might be either high or
low. "If nine farthings per acre should check the natural
increase of people, by causing a scarcity of well-paid
employment, it would be too much; and . . . if ninety pounds per
acre should not promote the greatest increase of wealth and
civilization, by maintaining a constant supply of the demand for
well-paid labour, it would be too little." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_29" id="FNanchor_5_29"></a><a href="#fn5_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a> In speaking of the price he preferred to use
the term "sufficient," that is, sufficient for its object of
restriction and for no other purpose. This ideal price would be
"a just medium . . . occasioning neither superabundance of people
nor superabundance of land, but so limiting the quantity of land,
as to give the cheapest land a market value that would have the
effect of compelling labourers to work some considerable time for
wages before they could become landowners. A price that did less
than this, would be insufficient; one that did more would be
excessive: the price that would do this and no more is the proper
price. I am used to call it the sufficient price." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_30" id="FNanchor_5_30"></a><a href="#fn5_30" class=
"fnanchor">[30]</a> In justice to prospective buyers the system
should be uniform. Land was to be disposed of in no other way
than by sale, as a single exception would furnish a pretext for
altering the system, and then all the advantages would disappear.
For the same reason permanency was necessary.</p>
<p>If the plan of a sufficient price was to work satisfactorily
two other provisions were requisite. In the first place each
settler should be allowed complete liberty of appropriation. He
must be able to buy land when and where he pleased. Otherwise
there was more restriction than the price contemplated. Once a
sufficient price was fixed any other restriction was entirely out
of keeping with the object for which it was imposed. If the
Government were to reserve land from the market for any reason
whatever it would destroy much of the advantage gained by a
sufficient price. Wakefield would have thrown the whole of the
waste land of a colony open to intending purchasers, believing as
he did that "as perfect a liberty of choice for settlers as the
nature of things in each case would allow, is an essential
condition of the well-working of the sufficient price." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_31" id="FNanchor_5_31"></a><a href="#fn5_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p>In the next place, and as a necessary preliminary to liberty
of appropriation, land should be surveyed in advance so that it
might be prepared for settlement, and settlers should be able
with certainty to make their own choice. "Waste land not
surveyed," he remarks, "is not land open to purchasers, any more
than unpicked cotton or unthrashed corn is fit for market."
<a name="FNanchor_5_32" id="FNanchor_5_32"></a><a href="#fn5_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>The amount of the price was obviously a crucial part of the
theory and in its practical application was always a vexed
question. Wakefield was constantly challenged to name his
sufficient price, and his refusal was put down to a want of
confidence in his own theory. He had, indeed, in his earliest
pamphlet of 1829, suggested £1 per acre as the price for New
South Wales, <a name="FNanchor_5_33" id=
"FNanchor_5_33"></a><a href="#fn5_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
but this was omitted when the pamphlet was reprinted as an
appendix to the <i>Letter from Sydney</i>. In 1835, he repeated
that he had always considered £2 per acre the lowest sufficient
price. <a name="FNanchor_5_34" id="FNanchor_5_34"></a><a href=
"#fn5_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In the <i>Letter from
Sydney</i> he admitted his inability to name a price.</p>
<p>"How is the proper price to be ascertained? I frankly confess
that I do not know. I believe that it could be determined only by
experience." <a name="FNanchor_5_35" id=
"FNanchor_5_35"></a><a href="#fn5_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p>But the two elements which he would take into account in
fixing a price were, first, the length of service a labourer
should give, next, the general conditions in the colony&mdash;for
example, the rate of wages which a labourer would receive, the
cost of living and the nature of the soil and climate. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_36" id="FNanchor_5_36"></a><a href="#fn5_36" class=
"fnanchor">[36]</a> These two together would determine how much a
labourer might save in the given period, and the price should be
fixed so that he could not obtain enough land to cultivate until
his period of service had been accomplished. A rough guide to
determine whether the price was too high or too low was to be
found in the actual scarcity or abundance of labour in the
colony. The legislator "could always tell whether or not labour
for hire was too scarce or too plentiful in the colony. If it
were too plentiful, he would know that the price of new land was
too high; that is, more than sufficient: if it were hurtfully
scarce, he would know that the price was too low, or not
sufficient." <a name="FNanchor_5_37" id=
"FNanchor_5_37"></a><a href="#fn5_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The best way of establishing a price in practice was, he thought,
for the Government to fix a price and gradually raise it as
experience warranted. <a name="FNanchor_5_38" id=
"FNanchor_5_38"></a><a href="#fn5_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
He did not pretend that the same price would suit all colonies.
"There is no price that would be suitable for the colonies
generally: the price must needs vary according to peculiar
natural and other circumstances in each colony; and in order to
determine the price for any colony, practical proceedings of a
tentative or experimental nature are indispensable." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_39" id="FNanchor_5_39"></a><a href="#fn5_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> Indeed, "to name a price for all the
colonies, would be as absurd as to fix the size of a coat for
mankind." <a name="FNanchor_5_40" id="FNanchor_5_40"></a><a href=
"#fn5_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p>Once a "sufficient price" was imposed and a proper proportion
established between land and people, industry would flourish in
the colony. With a supply of combinable labour, profits and wages
would be high, and the colony attractive to capitalist and
labourer. It would then be to the interest of the labourer to
emigrate and to the interest of the capitalist to furnish him
with the means of emigration. Capitalists in the colony would pay
the cost of the emigrant's passage, and emigrating capitalists
would take out with them labourers under contract of service. In
each case the sufficient-price restriction on land would enable
the capitalist to hold the labourer to his agreement.
"Colonization would be very rapid as well as good in kind, or
civilized: and the sole cause of the whole improvement would be
the sufficient price." <a name="FNanchor_5_41" id=
"FNanchor_5_41"></a><a href="#fn5_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<p>So far the Wakefield theory is simple and consistent. The
sufficient price, "the groundwork of the system," <a name=
"FNanchor_5_42" id="FNanchor_5_42"></a><a href="#fn5_42" class=
"fnanchor">[42]</a> is imposed for one object only, and bears no
relation whatever either to the value of land, or to the cost of
an emigrant's passage. Indeed, it is to be somewhat arbitrarily
fixed, and constantly adjusted to the fluctuations in the supply
of labour. Its amount can only be satisfactorily determined by
experience. To sum up, the theory may be re-stated in brief in
this way. A sufficient price on colonial waste land would prevent
labourers in the colony from becoming landowners too soon. This
would ensure a supply of combinable labour, because capitalists
might then with safety import labourers under agreement. Thus the
colony would prosper to her own great benefit, and to the
advantage of the mother-country, which would be relieved of her
surplus population and afforded a new and extending market.</p>
<p>It is not too much to say that, had the Wakefield theory
stopped short at this point, it would have attracted the
attention of none but a few political speculators. But the whole
character of the theory was entirely changed by consideration of
the question, what was to be done with the revenue resulting from
sales of land at a sufficient price? "In the whole art of
colonization, there is no question of more importance." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_43" id="FNanchor_5_43"></a><a href="#fn5_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a> Important as it was, its place in the
Wakefield theory has often been misunderstood. Some of its later
critics and exponents have written as if the price on land was
suggested in order to provide revenue which might be used in
emigration. <a name="FNanchor_5_44" id=
"FNanchor_5_44"></a><a href="#fn5_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
That this view was taken by his contemporaries is evident from
Wakefield's protests against it; that it was a misconception is
evident from his frequent assertions that it was right to impose
a price without reference to emigration at all. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_45" id="FNanchor_5_45"></a><a href="#fn5_45" class=
"fnanchor">[45]</a> He was prepared to rest the validity of his
theory solely upon the doctrine of a sufficient price. "As the
only object of selling instead of giving is one totally distinct
from that of producing revenue&mdash;namely, to prevent labourers
from turning into landowners too soon&mdash;the pecuniary result
would be unintended, one might almost say unexpected. So
completely is production of revenue a mere incident of the price
of land, that the price ought to be imposed, if it ought to be
imposed under any circumstances, even though the purchase money
were thrown away. This last proposition is the sharpest test to
which the theory of a sufficient price can be submitted; but if
it will not stand this test&mdash;if the proposition is not
true&mdash;the theory is false." <a name="FNanchor_5_46" id=
"FNanchor_5_46"></a><a href="#fn5_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
And again, "the money arising from the sale of land is a fund
raised without a purpose, unavoidably, incidentally, almost
accidentally. It is a fund, therefore, without a destination.
There would be no undertaking, no tacit obligation even, on the
part of the government to dispose of the fund in any particular
way. It is an unappropriated fund, which the state or government
may dispose of as it pleases without injustice to anybody. If the
fund were applied to paying off the public debt of the empire,
nobody could complain of injustice, because every colony as a
whole, and the buyers of land in particular, would still enjoy
all the intended and expected benefits of the imposition of a
sufficient price upon new land: if the fund were thrown into the
sea as it accrued, there would still be no injustice, and no
reason against producing the fund in that way." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_47" id="FNanchor_5_47"></a><a href="#fn5_47" class=
"fnanchor">[47]</a> Nevertheless, "if the object were the utmost
possible increase of the population, wealth, and greatness of our
empire," <a name="FNanchor_5_48" id="FNanchor_5_48"></a><a href=
"#fn5_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the best way to use the
revenue would be as an emigration fund. However strong might be
the inducement to a labourer to emigrate, he could not move
without assistance. It was necessary to "build a bridge, as it
were, toll-free, for the passage of poor labourers from an old
country to the colony." <a name="FNanchor_5_49" id=
"FNanchor_5_49"></a><a href="#fn5_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Then there would still be the kind of colonization produced by a
sufficient price, but it would proceed at a greatly accelerated
rate. <a name="FNanchor_5_50" id="FNanchor_5_50"></a><a href=
"#fn5_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The use of the proceeds in
emigration would "give the greatest possible progress to that
good sort of colonization of which the price had been a
deliberate object. With a sufficient price the land will be
colonized as well as possible; employing the purchase-money as an
immigration fund, the land will be colonized as fast as possible.
The sort of colonization would be the same, but the degree would
be infinitely greater." <a name="FNanchor_5_51" id=
"FNanchor_5_51"></a><a href="#fn5_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The employment of the whole of the proceeds in this way had
further manifest advantages over any other method.</p>
<p>In the first place, by this means the proportion of people to
land was considerably altered, for labour would pour into a
colony much faster than if there were merely a sufficient price,
and no emigration fund. When the passages of labourers were
provided in this way, the price might be lowered consistently
with the object for which it was imposed. <a name="FNanchor_5_52"
id="FNanchor_5_52"></a><a href="#fn5_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> This was Wakefield's more mature doctrine. In
<i>England and America</i>, in 1833, he took quite the opposite
view, laying down that a higher price might properly be required,
since the land sold would be much more valuable if the
purchase-money were devoted to the increase of colonial
population. <a name="FNanchor_5_53" id=
"FNanchor_5_53"></a><a href="#fn5_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a></p>
<p>But, in 1836, he "entirely dissented" from this view, thinking
it desirable to reduce the price in order to preserve the proper
proportion between people and land. <a name="FNanchor_5_54" id=
"FNanchor_5_54"></a><a href="#fn5_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
If it were consistent with a theory of a sufficient price to
lower its amount in this way, a colony which could do this would
have the obvious attraction of cheap land without any of its
disadvantages.</p>
<p>In the next place, if the purchase-money were devoted to
emigration, a land buyer would, in return for his outlay, obtain
not merely land, but a uniform and just system of free choice;
and, above all, he would really be purchasing labour. This fact
would help to make the theory easily understood and indeed
popular amongst intending purchasers. <a name="FNanchor_5_55" id=
"FNanchor_5_55"></a><a href="#fn5_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p>In the third place, with a lowered price, a colony would
become much more attractive to the labourer. The sufficient price
would be still restrictive, but no longer prohibitive. His term
of service for hire would be so much shorter, and he would so
much sooner become a landowner. Wakefield hoped that this would
make his system popular with the working classes and prevent them
from objecting to the sufficient price. <a name="FNanchor_5_56"
id="FNanchor_5_56"></a><a href="#fn5_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p>It is just at this point of union between the two doctrines of
a sufficient price and an emigration fund that the progressive
element in his scheme of colonization emerges. The sufficient
price would produce revenue, which, best applied to emigration,
would introduce labour into a colony. With the consequent
extension of industry, capital would be accumulated, and more
land bought both by capitalists and by labourers who had
completed their term of service. These new land-sales would yield
money for fresh emigration, and the process would begin again.
<a name="FNanchor_5_57" id="FNanchor_5_57"></a><a href="#fn5_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
<p>"The supply of labour <i>must</i> be constant and regular;
because, first, as no labourer would be able to procure land
until he had worked for money, all immigrant labourers, working
for a time for wages and in combination, would produce capital
for the employment of more labourers; secondly, because every
labourer who left off working for wages and became a landowner,
would, by purchasing land, provide a fund for bringing fresh
labour to the colony." <a name="FNanchor_5_58" id=
"FNanchor_5_58"></a><a href="#fn5_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Colonel Torrens, a contemporary economist of some note and a
convert to the Wakefield theory, found in the system "a
geometrical principle of progression," <a name="FNanchor_5_59"
id="FNanchor_5_59"></a><a href="#fn5_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a> which would, in the mother-country, operate
in precisely the opposite direction to that of Malthus.</p>
<p>Here, too, the theory takes on that self-regulating aspect
which has laid it open to considerable criticism. If a sufficient
price were imposed, and the whole of the funds spent in
emigration, the amount of land sold would, he thought, plainly
show what demand there was for labour, and at the same time would
provide enough funds to supply that demand. The amount of land
sold might be a measure of the quantity of labour wanted.
"Nothing would show plainly to what extent the demand for labour
had increased half so distinctly as the amount of land sold."
<a name="FNanchor_5_60" id="FNanchor_5_60"></a><a href="#fn5_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Wakefield's followers eagerly embraced
this part of the doctrine and used it as one reason for devoting
the whole of the proceeds to emigration. <a name="FNanchor_5_61"
id="FNanchor_5_61"></a><a href="#fn5_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a> He himself was of the same opinion in 1833.
"We might, indeed, regulate the supply of labour by the amount of
land sold, even if the labour were brought by a fund raised out
of the colony: that is, the old country might spend, on the
emigration of labour to the colony in one year, a sum precisely
equal to the sum raised in the previous year by the sale of
colonial land. But the object of so measuring one fund by the
other would be secured, as a matter of course, if the whole fund
obtained by the sales of land were spent in procuring labour. One
of the greatest merits of this plan, therefore, seems to consist
in its self-regulating action." <a name="FNanchor_5_62" id=
"FNanchor_5_62"></a><a href="#fn5_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
<p>But it would appear that, later, he had doubts upon this
subject, and would have been satisfied to urge a sufficient price
together with the devotion of the whole of the proceeds to
emigration, without pressing for the recognition of any necessary
relation between that sum and the amount required to import the
necessary labour. In the <i>Art of Colonization</i> (1849), he
insisted on the first two elements, but avoided mention of the
other.</p>
<p>This doctrine of self-regulation has considerable effect on
the practical problem of calculating a sufficient price. The
former simple process of estimating length of service, wages, and
cost of living does not now seem applicable. A price must be
sufficient now, not only to prevent the acquisition of land, but
also to produce enough revenue to pay the passage of as many
labourers as may be required. Obviously a price, otherwise
sufficient, must be altered with every variation in cost of
transport if there is to be any relation between it and the
demand for labour. Wakefield never clearly showed how one price
was to achieve the two objects of restriction and of providing
the exact amount of labour required. Assuming that a sufficient
price did this, it followed that the whole of the proceeds should
be devoted to emigration. Otherwise the nice balance between
labour supply and demand would be overturned. Sale by auction,
too, stood condemned by this test, as it meant raising more
revenue than was necessary. "Seven years ago," Wakefield told the
Committee on Waste Lands in 1836, "I was as ignorant of this
subject (of colonization) as one of those chairs, and . . . I
have acquired my opinions by degrees." This was peculiarly true
of his views as to auction. It is not difficult to see that sale
of land by auction does not easily square with the doctrine of a
sufficient price. If the object is to impose a restrictive price
and no more, then auction, in raising the price by competition,
makes it excessive when the minimum upset price is sufficient.
When the minimum upset price is not sufficient, there is no
certainty that the price obtained by auction will be sufficient,
though in any given case this may happen by chance. If there is
no competition by auction and land is sold at the minimum price,
the whole reason for auction is gone. The two systems, indeed,
have different and irreconcilable aims. The one aims at a
competitive price, at obtaining as much as possible for the land,
the other at a hired-labour price, at the one price, high or low,
which will accomplish its object of restriction. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_63" id="FNanchor_5_63"></a><a href="#fn5_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a> Wakefield's system was modelled to some
extent on that of the United States of America, and, at first, he
had adopted from there the plan of auction. All his early
proposals and schemes for colonization had contemplated combining
auction with the plan of sale at a fixed minimum upset price. For
long he had imagined that the method of sale was unimportant, but
closer inquiry revealed to him the superiority of a uniform
price. <a name="FNanchor_5_64" id="FNanchor_5_64"></a><a href=
"#fn5_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The first sign of a change
was when the <i>Spectator</i>, in 1834, in discussing the
proposed new colony of South Australia, pointed out that the
system of auction was open to many objections, and was, indeed,
only optional in the new colony. <a name="FNanchor_5_65" id=
"FNanchor_5_65"></a><a href="#fn5_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
By 1835, Wakefield had completely abandoned auction, and his
letter to the South Australian Commissioners strongly opposed the
plan. <a name="FNanchor_5_66" id="FNanchor_5_66"></a><a href=
"#fn5_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> So far, indeed, did he carry
his opposition, and so conveniently did he forget his change,
that, in 1849, he wrote, "It has been imagined that the
sufficient price might be obtained by means of competition, if
new land were offered for sale by auction at a low upset price. I
am at a loss to conceive how this notion could be entertained by
a reasonable mind." <a name="FNanchor_5_67" id=
"FNanchor_5_67"></a><a href="#fn5_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
He even went so far as to say that Lord Grey was "the parent of
the auction nuisance in our colonies." <a name="FNanchor_5_68"
id="FNanchor_5_68"></a><a href="#fn5_68" class=
"fnanchor">[68]</a> His main objection was that auction would
take away from the settler more of his capital than he would need
to expend on land, if the price were sufficient. This would be a
mischievous tax on colonization by depriving the settler of his
prospect of profit, which was his chief encouragement to
emigration. <a name="FNanchor_5_69" id=
"FNanchor_5_69"></a><a href="#fn5_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
He enumerates, too, several minor practical disadvantages of
auction. A prospective buyer would have to wait for his land
until the periodic auction came around; while, under a uniform
price, he might obtain land whenever he pleased. Also, by causing
jobbing and speculation, and leading to friction among the
settlers, auction would be very unpopular in the colonies.
<a name="FNanchor_5_70" id="FNanchor_5_70"></a><a href="#fn5_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> He preferred, however, even as a matter
of theory, auction at a minimum price which would be sufficient,
to an insufficient fixed price, because it was the minimum price
which determined the degree of restriction. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_71" id="FNanchor_5_71"></a><a href="#fn5_71" class=
"fnanchor">[71]</a> In practice, too, he was forced to admit that
auction might in some circumstances be advantageous; for example,
in the sale of town allotments in a new colony. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_72" id="FNanchor_5_72"></a><a href="#fn5_72" class=
"fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
<p>On the question of devoting the whole of the proceeds of the
land fund to emigration his opinion varied somewhat. From the
beginning he was willing that incidental expenses like that of
surveying should be defrayed from this source. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_73" id="FNanchor_5_73"></a><a href="#fn5_73" class=
"fnanchor">[73]</a> He admitted, too, that in practice it might
be necessary to divert some of the land fund to other urgent
purposes, for example, to improving the means of communication in
a colony, or even to defraying the cost of government. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_74" id="FNanchor_5_74"></a><a href="#fn5_74" class=
"fnanchor">[74]</a> If that were done the important thing was to
fix the proportion which should be applied to emigration, so that
every settler would know how much of his purchase-money went to
this object, and would make his calculations accordingly.
<a name="FNanchor_5_75" id="FNanchor_5_75"></a><a href="#fn5_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
<p>The theory of a sufficient price was intended by its author to
apply only to agricultural, and not to pastoral, lands. Neglect
of this fact has caused much misconception of Wakefield's theory,
<a name="FNanchor_5_76" id="FNanchor_5_76"></a><a href="#fn5_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and has rendered much criticism of it
beside the mark. Wakefield always had in view the development of
agricultural industry in a colony. His idea of a prosperous
colony was one in which agriculture was being pursued on a large
and extending scale, where the tillage of arable farms was
gradually displacing the grazing of sheep and cattle on pasture
lands. His sufficient price was one to prevent abourers from
becoming owners of agricultural land, and the proceeds of land
sales were to be used to furnish labourers for agriculture. While
he did not overlook the importance of pastoral industry, he
considered that its interests should be subordinate to those of
agriculture.</p>
<p>It is clear enough from Wakefield's writings that he held
consistent views on this subject from the beginning; but the
incomplete way in which his theory was put into practice
furnished some ground for misunderstanding. In his first
proposal, in 1831, to colonize South Australia, he was careful to
point out that the system of selling land was not meant to
prevent colonists from pasturing their cattle on unappropriated
land. In his opinion there was no need for restriction, because
the term during which a labourer worked for hire depended wholly
on the price of agricultural land, and not at all on the cost of
pastoral land. Or, from another point of view, "It is the extreme
cheapness, not of natural pasturage, but of land for cultivation,
which occasions scarcity of labour for hire." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_77" id="FNanchor_5_77"></a><a href="#fn5_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> This was not merely a later opinion, for he
expressed it before the Committee on Waste Lands in 1836, and,
again, before the South Australian Committee of 1841. To the
latter Committee he said, "I am always very much afraid of being
supposed to press for any check upon that use of pasturage which
is not freehold, and which does not affect the labour market; a
man cannot become a freeholder by driving sheep over a district
of country." <a name="FNanchor_5_78" id=
"FNanchor_5_78"></a><a href="#fn5_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Not only would he have placed no restriction on their use, but he
would have allowed the utmost freedom, stopping short of
appropriation. No rent, or a purely nominal one, should be
demanded, but conditions as to stock should be imposed to prevent
misuse. Moreover it should be distinctly understood that all
pastoral lands were liable at any time to be taken and sold as
agricultural land. "The pasturage ought to be let as the land
ought to be sold, uniformly and fairly, 'first come, first
served,' always being liable to be brought into the Government
sales whenever anyone wished to obtain, by paying a sufficient
price, the freehold property in the land." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_79" id="FNanchor_5_79"></a><a href="#fn5_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p>Having demonstrated the necessity of imposing a sufficient
price on waste land, and of using the proceeds in emigration, he
developed the third part of his theory in answer to the question
how to use the emigration fund to the greatest possible advantage
both of mother-country and of colony. The principle which he
adopted was that of selection of emigrants. He took great
exception to the unsystematic and haphazard kind of emigration,
mainly of paupers to Canada, and of convicts to Australia, which
had been going on prior to, and even after, 1830. Of pauper
emigration he wrote: "Who are they that go? Probably the most
useless, the least respectable people in the parish. How are they
got to go? Probably by means of a little pressure, such as
parishes and landlords can easily apply without getting into a
scrape with <i>The Times</i>. Occasionally they refuse to go
after preparation has been made for their departure. Whether they
go or stay, the attempt to remove them, not by attraction, but
repulsion, makes an impression in the neighbourhood, that
emigration is only fit for the refuse of the population, if it is
not going to some kind of slavery or destruction. The tendency of
these pauper-shovellings is to make the common people think of
emigration with dislike and terror." <a name="FNanchor_5_80" id=
"FNanchor_5_80"></a><a href="#fn5_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
While the system of transportation existed, the departure of an
emigrant differed little from that of a convict. "The judge, when
he sentences a convict to transportation, tells him (and what the
judge says, the convict's neighbours learn) that for his crime he
is to be punished by being removed from his country and home,
separated from his relations and friends, condemned to pass the
whole, or a great part, of his life amongst strangers in a
distant land. The parson of the parish might, with equal truth,
address the very same words to an honest labourer about to
emigrate." <a name="FNanchor_5_81" id=
"FNanchor_5_81"></a><a href="#fn5_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Transportation did not discourage crime, but it most certainly
discouraged emigration. "In the mind of the common people"
favourable reports from convicts serve to "confound emigration
and punishment, emigration and disgrace, emigration and shame."
<a name="FNanchor_5_82" id="FNanchor_5_82"></a><a href="#fn5_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p>He kept two facts steadily in view, in the first place, the
redundancy of population in the mother-country, in the second
place, the lack of civilization in the colony, and its cause the
scarcity of labour. The emigration fund, then, was to be laid out
in such a way as to take from the mother-country and introduce
into the colony the greatest possible amount of population and
labour at the least cost. For this purpose he recommended
preference should be given to young married couples. "The
Domestic power of increase would thereby be greatly weakened, and
the Colonial power of increase would be strengthened in the same
degree." <a name="FNanchor_5_83" id="FNanchor_5_83"></a><a href=
"#fn5_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The removal every year of
large numbers of young couples at marriageable ages would, more
than any other plan, help to prevent future redundancy at home,
while their removal would cost no more than that of other
classes, and the colony would obtain "the greatest possible germ
of future increase." <a name="FNanchor_5_84" id=
"FNanchor_5_84"></a><a href="#fn5_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Hitherto little care had been taken to produce anything like an
equal proportion between the sexes. In New South Wales, for
instance, owing to the system of transportation, this inequality
was most glaring. Apart altogether from any moral considerations,
it was best, from the economic point of view, that people of both
sexes should be sent. "If the object were to procure, at the
least cost, the greatest amount of labour for immediate
employment, it would appear, at first sight, that the immigrants
brought to the colony ought to be, all of them, males in the
prime of life. But it is only at first sight that this can
appear; because on reflection it will be seen that two men having
to perform each for himself all the offices that women usually
perform for men, to cook his own victuals, to mend his own
clothes, to make his own bed, to play the woman's part at home as
well as the man's part in the field or workshop; it will be seen,
I say, that two men, each of whom should be obliged so to divide
his labour between household cares and the work of production,
would produce less than one man giving the whole of his time,
attention, and labour, to the work of production. If the two men
should combine their labour and divide their employments, one
occupying himself solely with household cares for both, and the
other solely with earning wages for both, then might the produce
of their united labour be as great as that of one married man;
but in no case could it be more." <a name="FNanchor_5_85" id=
"FNanchor_5_85"></a><a href="#fn5_85" class=
"fnanchor">[85]</a></p>
<p>Marriage being, according to Wakefield, a time of change "when
the mind is most disposed to hope, to ambition, to undertakings
which require decision and energy of purpose," <a name=
"FNanchor_5_86" id="FNanchor_5_86"></a><a href="#fn5_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a> young married couples would be more willing
than any other class to emigrate. Their anxiety for the future
and their desire to make provision for their children would make
them saving and industrious. Again, by reason of their youth,
they would more easily accommodate themselves to the conditions
of life in a new country, and to new modes of cultivation and
labour. "If they were old people their labour would be of little
value to the colony; not only because it would soon be at an end,
but also because they would be weak, and because they would not
readily turn their hands to new employments, to employments very
often quite different from those in which they had worked from
their childhood to old age. In order that the poor immigrants
brought to a colony should be as valuable as possible, they ought
to be young people, whose powers of labour would last as long as
possible, and who would readily turn their hands to new kinds of
work." <a name="FNanchor_5_87" id="FNanchor_5_87"></a><a href=
"#fn5_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> On the moral advantages of
sending out emigrants of both sexes there was no need to dwell.
He had before him the example of New South Wales, and indeed his
theory more particularly applied to the Australian colonies. If,
in its general aspect, this part of his doctrine was meant to
conduce to the greatest economy in providing labour to the
colony, and in removing the surplus population from the
mother-country, in its particular application it was to be the
means of preventing further inequality between the sexes in New
South Wales.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Bentham he looked forward to the unique
opportunity for an experiment in universal education, afforded by
the presence of large numbers of children in a colony peopled by
young married couples. "For many years, the proportion of
children to grown-up people would be greater than was ever known
since Shem, Ham and Japhet were surrounded by their little ones.
The colony would be an immense nursery, and, all being at ease
without being scattered, would offer the finest opportunity that
ever occurred, to see what may be done for society by universal
education. That must be a narrow breast in which the last
consideration does not raise some generous emotion." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_88" id="FNanchor_5_88"></a><a href="#fn5_88" class=
"fnanchor">[88]</a></p>
<p>The Wakefield theory, indeed, had a definite social side.
While impartial in wishing to give the greatest possible
advantages to mother-country and colony alike, he always insisted
that colonies should be made as attractive as possible from every
point of view. One of his aims, then, was to transfer the better
elements of the civilization of old countries to new conditions
favourable to their development. Colonies were no longer to be
new societies, barbarous and uncivilized, but were to be
"extensions of old societies." <a name="FNanchor_5_89" id=
"FNanchor_5_89"></a><a href="#fn5_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
While he never thought to reproduce in a colony all the social
inequalities of an old country, nor to prevent all classes from
sharing in its prosperity, he did wish to introduce sufficient
civilization and culture to keep the colony at a high level.
<a name="FNanchor_5_90" id="FNanchor_5_90"></a><a href="#fn5_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The presence of combinable labour would
cause prosperity, and attract not only labourers and capitalists,
but all other classes which went to make up a civilized society.
"The colonies," he wrote, in the <i>Letter from Sydney</i>,
"would no longer be new societies strictly speaking. They would
be so many extensions of an old society. Pursue that idea, and
you will see that emigration from Britain would not be confined
to Paupers, passing by the free bridge. We (I speak in the name
of the colonists) should acquire wealth rapidly . . . . How many
ready-made articles, both useful and ornamental, should we import
from England, for which, now, we have not the means to pay? Let
me enumerate a few of them&mdash;farming bailiffs, surveyors,
builders, architects and engineers, mineralogists, practical
miners, botanists and chemists, printers, schoolmasters and
schoolmistresses, booksellers, authors, publishers, and even
reviewers, merchants to supply us with English goods and to take
our surplus produce, bankers, underwriters, life-insurers, and
clerks innumerable, actors, surgeons and physicians, lawyers,
clergymen, singers, music and dancing masters, milliners and
other female artists, and, at least, one good political economist
at each settlement, to prevent us from devising an Australasian
tariff . . . . Thus . . . these colonies, like those of Greece,
would 'contain a mixture of all classes of society.' . . . In
fewer words, every grant of land in these colonies would be an
extension, though distant, of Britain itself, and would provide
so much more room for all classes of Britons." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_91" id="FNanchor_5_91"></a><a href="#fn5_91" class=
"fnanchor">[91]</a> Much would be gained if colonies could be
made to attract what he called the "higher order of emigrants,"
whose presence would induce others to emigrate. "The most
respectable emigrants, more especially if they have a good deal
of property, and are well connected in this country, lead and
govern the emigration of the other classes. These are the
emigrants whose presence in a colony most beneficially affects
its standard of morals and manners, and would supply the most
beneficial element of colonial government. If you can induce many
of this class to settle in a colony, the other classes, whether
capitalists or labourers, are sure to settle there in abundance;
for a combination of honour, virtue, intelligence, and property,
is respected even by those who do not possess it; and if those
emigrate who do possess it, their example has an immense
influence in leading others to emigrate, who either do not
possess it, or possess it in an inferior degree." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_92" id="FNanchor_5_92"></a><a href="#fn5_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a> Two other social factors he relied upon to
take away from a colony its character as a new society, one the
influence of women on colonization, the other provision for
religion. "In colonization, women have a part so important that
all depends on their participation in the work. If only men
emigrate, there is no colonization; if only a few women emigrate
in proportion to the men, the colonization is slow and most
unsatisfactory in other respects: an equal emigration of the
sexes is one essential condition of the best colonization. In
colonizing, the woman's participation must begin with the man's
first thought about emigrating, and must extend to nearly all the
arrangements he has to make, and the things he has to do, from
the moment of contemplating a departure from the family home till
the domestic party shall be comfortably housed in the new
country. The influence of women in this matter is even greater,
one may say, than that of the men. You may make a colony
agreeable to men, but not to women; you cannot make it agreeable
to women without being agreeable to men. You may induce some men
of the higher classes to emigrate without inducing the women; but
if you succeed with the women you are sure not to fail with the
men. A colony that is not attractive to women is an unattractive
colony; in order to make it attractive to both sexes you do
enough if you take care to make it attractive to women." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_93" id="FNanchor_5_93"></a><a href="#fn5_93" class=
"fnanchor">[93]</a> Adequate provision for religion was not a
whit less important. "Suppose that in planning your colonization
you had by some strange oversight omitted all provisions for
religion in the colony; and that accordingly, as would surely be
the case, you found amongst religious people of all classes, but
especially amongst the higher classes, and amongst the better
sort of women of every class, a strong repugnance to having
anything to do with you. If you had made no provisions for
religion in your colony, and if people here only cared enough
about you to find that out, your scheme would be vituperated by
religious men, who are numerous; by religious women, who are very
numerous; and by the clergy of all denominations, who are
immensely powerful. You would have to take what you could get in
the way of emigration. Your labouring class of emigrants would be
composed of paupers, vagabonds, and sluts: your middle-class, of
broken-down tradesmen, over-reachers, semi-swindlers, and needy
adventurers, together with a few miserable wives and a good many
mistresses: your higher order of emigrants would be men of
desperate fortunes, flying from debt and bedevilment, and young
reprobates spurned or coaxed into banishment by relatives wishing
them dead. You would sow bad seed, plant sorry offsets, build
with rotten materials: your colony would be disgusting." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_94" id="FNanchor_5_94"></a><a href="#fn5_94" class=
"fnanchor">[94]</a> On the presence, indeed, of provision for
religion depended the presence of women's influence in a colony.
If inadequate it "is well calculated to deter the better order or
people, and especially the better order of women, from going to
live and die in a colony." <a name="FNanchor_5_95" id=
"FNanchor_5_95"></a><a href="#fn5_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p>Wakefield appears to have thought that the long-established
civilization of an old society could be taken up in layers and
transferred in the same position to a colony, the colonies
becoming "new Englands" with high and low, rich and poor, all
classes and grades of society, though with more freedom of
passage from one grade to another. In his own words, colonization
resembled the transplanting of full-grown trees, not of young
plants, the removal of society, not of people. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_96" id="FNanchor_5_96"></a><a href="#fn5_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a> Indeed, he never conceived of the formation
of a stable society in a colony which would differ in essentials
from the type with which he was familiar at home.</p>
<p>In its mature form, then, the Wakefield system, on its
economic and social side, consisted of three proposals:</p>
<p>First, the sale of colonial waste land at a uniform sufficient
price.</p>
<p>Secondly, the use of the whole, or a fixed proportion, of the
revenue from land sales, in emigration.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a judicious selection of emigrants on the grounds of
age, sex, and social position, preference being given to young
married couples.</p>
<p>There remain to be considered some aspects of the Wakefield
theory in regard to its effect upon the mother-country and to its
application in the colonies.</p>
<p>To the mother-country it was primarily a remedy for
over-population, but it was not intended to be the sole remedy.
The repeal of the corn laws would indirectly operate in the same
way by enlarging the field of employment. <a name="FNanchor_5_97"
id="FNanchor_5_97"></a><a href="#fn5_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a> Nor was emigration by itself sufficient to
prevent future redundancy of population. The "fundamental checks"
indicated by Malthus alone could do that, but colonization on a
large scale, by removing the present surplus population, was the
only means of allowing those checks to operate. In Wakefield's
metaphor it was no use advising walking exercise as a cure to a
dropsical man, until measures were taken to enable him to walk.
<a name="FNanchor_5_98" id="FNanchor_5_98"></a><a href="#fn5_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In colonization "the mother-country and
the colony would become partners in a new trade&mdash;the
creation of happy human beings; one country furnishing the raw
material&mdash;that is, the land, the dust of which man is made;
the other furnishing the machinery&mdash;that is, men and women,
to convert the unpeopled soil into living images of God."
<a name="FNanchor_5_99" id="FNanchor_5_99"></a><a href="#fn5_99"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
<p>Considered separately, the mother-country and the colonies had
mutual interests in colonization, yet the empire as a whole had a
greater interest in good colonization than any of the colonies
separately. For this reason the control of colonial waste lands
and the management of emigration were imperial matters which
could not be left to any one colony. "If I made out any case at
all," Wakefield said to the Waste Lands Committee of 1836, "it
was an imperial case." The whole scheme would be defeated if a
minority were to determine matters which concerned the majority.
"This appears to me to be one of those cases which require a
central authority. The end is the advantage of the whole empire;
two of the most important means are uniformity in the practice,
and very great care in the distribution of the labourers amongst
the several colonies, so that the supply should never be more or
less than the demand. None but a central authority would be able
to conduct the operation." <a name="FNanchor_5_100" id=
"FNanchor_5_100"></a><a href="#fn5_100" class=
"fnanchor">[100]</a> Before the Committee of 1836 he strongly
maintained this position in spite of the repeated questioning of
Roebuck, who appeared to have in mind the fact that a practical
application of the Wakefield system in Lower Canada would deprive
the Canadians of control over their waste lands.</p>
<p>In course of time, Wakefield thought, the colonies would
manage not only their waste lands, but all other matters which
concerned them. "I believe there is a period in the existence of
every important colony when the power of independence arrives;
and that, let the mother-country wish what it may, the colony
will make laws of every sort and kind, and among others, laws
relating to waste land." <a name="FNanchor_5_101" id=
"FNanchor_5_101"></a><a href="#fn5_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> In the meantime control should remain with
the mother-country, provided always that she could be brought to
recognize her own interest in dealing with waste lands and
emigration. If she so far forgot her interest as to be guilty of
mismanagement, she should forfeit control to the colonies.
<a name="FNanchor_5_102" id="FNanchor_5_102"></a><a href=
"#fn5_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In 1849 he wrote: "The
impossibility of inducing Parliament to consider the matter and
legislate upon it in earnest . . . has at length induced me to
recur to an old doctrine of mine&mdash;which is that the whole
subject of the disposal of waste lands is a colonial matter which
ought to be handed over to the colonists without any kind of
reservation." <a name="FNanchor_5_103" id=
"FNanchor_5_103"></a><a href="#fn5_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
<p>In the application of his theory to the existing colonies,
Wakefield had to take account of the fact that a great deal of
land had already been appropriated by free grants or at low
prices, which would considerably affect the results expected from
imposing a sufficient price. "Where private land is monstrously
superabundant, the sufficient price would, for a long while, stop
the sale of all public land not possessing or acquiring a
position-value." <a name="FNanchor_5_104" id=
"FNanchor_5_104"></a><a href="#fn5_104" class=
"fnanchor">[104]</a> He proposed to meet this difficulty by
imposing a tax on sales of private lands appropriated prior to
the institution of a sufficient price, and by using the proceeds
in emigration. In addition, he suggested raising a loan for the
same purpose, on the security of future land sales. A uniform tax
per acre, equal in amount to the sufficient price, should, he
considered, be imposed on the first sale of all private lands
which took place after the imposition or a sufficient price. If
the proceeds of the tax were devoted to emigration, the effect
would be the same as if unappropriated public land had been sold.
"The imposition of this tax on the first sale of any land after
the law came into force . . . would be to put the sufficient
price upon all the land of the colony, with this only difference
between public and private land, that in one case the price would
be paid before, and in the other, soon or later, after
appropriation." <a name="FNanchor_5_105" id=
"FNanchor_5_105"></a><a href="#fn5_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a> To avoid hardship, the Government was to be
prepared, during a definite period, to buy at a valuation land
which anyone wished to sell. Where land was superabundant,
anticipation of future sales by way of loan for purposes of
emigration was the only method of altering the proportion between
people and land in the appropriated territory, and of supplying
sufficient labour for hire. <a name="FNanchor_5_106" id=
"FNanchor_5_106"></a><a href="#fn5_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
<p>For the foundation of new colonies some special measures were
necessary. At first he had thought there was no need to
anticipate the land sales in a new colony, because where there
was no previous appropriation there was no hurtful proportion
between people and land. <a name="FNanchor_5_107" id=
"FNanchor_5_107"></a><a href="#fn5_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> Writing later, however, with the experience
of South Australia and New Zealand in view, he admitted that
anticipation might be useful even in a new colony, because
intending settlers might be unwilling to give a sufficient price
until a colony was to some extent peopled. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_108" id="FNanchor_5_108"></a><a href="#fn5_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The work of founding a new colony
should, in his opinion, be entrusted to associations of private
individuals, with no further assistance from Government than was
necessary to establish a proper system of disposing of waste
lands. Such a private association would buy land from the
Government, settle the colony, and make its profit out of the
re-sale to intending colonists. It would have the opportunity to
found towns, choose sites, and gain the profit from their
increasing value as the settlement advanced. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_109" id="FNanchor_5_109"></a><a href="#fn5_109"
class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In addition, the association was to
have the power of governing the colony until it was ready for
self-government. His model was the colonies of America which had
been founded and maintained by private companies without the
assistance of Government. The expenses of government in such a
colony were to be defrayed partly out of revenue raised in the
colony, partly by loans raised by the company, and charged on the
future revenues of the colony. <a name="FNanchor_5_110" id=

<p>In its first formulation, in 1829, Wakefield's system was
particularly a cure for existing evils in Australasia. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_111" id="FNanchor_5_111"></a><a href="#fn5_111"
class="fnanchor">[111]</a> To other colonies its application was
not so certain. In Canada, for example, he was quite sure that it
could not be conveniently applied, "because the vicinity of the
United States would induce emigrant labourers to emigrate once
more in search of waste land, or extravagant wages; and the
purchasers of waste lands in Canada would thereby be cheated of
their consideration." <a name="FNanchor_5_112" id=
"FNanchor_5_112"></a><a href="#fn5_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a> But here, again, his views suffered a
change; by 1830 <a name="FNanchor_5_113" id=
"FNanchor_5_113"></a><a href="#fn5_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a> he was prepared to recommend its partial,
and by 1831 <a name="FNanchor_5_114" id=
"FNanchor_5_114"></a><a href="#fn5_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a> its total application to Canada. In 1831,
too, he urged its application to South Africa. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_115" id="FNanchor_5_115"></a><a href="#fn5_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In 1838 he drew up a scheme for its
introduction in a modified form into Canada, together with
special provisions intended to counteract the effect of the
previous profusion of land grants there. <a name="FNanchor_5_116"
id="FNanchor_5_116"></a><a href="#fn5_116" class=
"fnanchor">[116]</a> In the end, indeed, he came to look upon his
theory as capable of universal application to colonies, and
almost as a panacea for all colonial ills.</p>
<p>To the Wakefield theory there was an important political as
well as a social and economic side. From the beginning he
advocated nothing short of self-government for colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_117" id="FNanchor_5_117"></a><a href="#fn5_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Economic measures alone were not
sufficient to make a colony prosperous, there must also be good
government. <a name="FNanchor_5_118" id=
"FNanchor_5_118"></a><a href="#fn5_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a> Looking back in 1849, he wrote: "The authors
of that theory attached the highest importance to the subject of
government, believing that the best economical arrangements would
not work well without provisions for a good political government
of the colonists." <a name="FNanchor_5_119" id=
"FNanchor_5_119"></a><a href="#fn5_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> When anxious, however, to get his theory put
to the test of experiment in South Australia, he minimized the
importance of its political side; for, when he found that it was
impossible to have the whole theory adopted, and that
self-government was the stumbling-block, he consented to shelve
it for a time. "It was clear to us that the part of our South
Australian plan to which the Colonial Office most objected was a
provision for bestowing on the colonists a considerable amount of
local self-government. As we could not move an inch without the
sanction of that Office, we now resolved to abandon the political
part of our scheme, in the hope of being enabled to realize the
economical part." <a name="FNanchor_5_120" id=
"FNanchor_5_120"></a><a href="#fn5_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a> But the experiment of complete
self-government could not well have been tried at once in a new
colony, so he was content that it should be laid down as a future
policy to be adopted when the colony had grown sufficiently in
numbers. <a name="FNanchor_5_121" id=
"FNanchor_5_121"></a><a href="#fn5_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a> That his political theory might be divorced
from his economic theory he admitted to the 1836 Committee on
Waste Lands, when, in answer to Roebuck, he said that a system of
government was not necessary in order to make the application of
his theory complete. <a name="FNanchor_5_122" id=
"FNanchor_5_122"></a><a href="#fn5_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> His normal view, however, was that one could
not well succeed without the other.</p>
<p>The want of success noticeable in the existing colonies, in
his opinion, had for one cause the unsatisfactory nature of
colonial government resulting from the lack of local control.
Where there was no representative assembly, the colonial
government was altogether in the hands of a close oligarchy of
officials appointed by Downing Street. Their boundless power
attracted to them many time-serving partisans, but arrayed
against them was a large and violently hostile majority of
colonists, who resented exclusion from any share in their own
government. Colonial politics were notorious for the extreme
hostility of parties. "Colonial party politics, then, are
remarkable for the factiousness and violence of politicians, the
prevalence of demagoguism, the roughness and even brutality of
the newspapers, the practice in carrying on public differences of
making war to the knife, and always striking at the heart."
<a name="FNanchor_5_123" id="FNanchor_5_123"></a><a href=
"#fn5_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Even if there were a
representative body, yet, in the absence of any responsibility of
the executive to the legislature, power was still in the hands of
the official class, and the executive and the legislature were
for the most part at variance. In either case there was no way
out of the difficulty but rebellion, which alone could affect the
ruling majority. All these evils he ascribed to the fact that
colonial government was a completely arbitrary system of
"government from a distance." In his hatred of this kind of
government he followed Bentham, who had written: "Government from
a distance is often mischievous to the people submitted to it;
government is almost always, as it respects them, in a state
either of jealousy or indifference. They are either neglected or
pillaged; they are made places of banishment for the reception of
the vilest part of society, or places to be pillaged by minions
and favourites, whom it is considered desirable suddenly to
enrich. The sovereign, at two thousand leagues distance from his
subjects, can be acquainted neither with their wants, their
interests, their manners, nor their character. The most
legitimate and weighty complaints, weakened by reason of
distance, stripped of everything which might excite sensibility,
of everything which might soften or subdue the pride of power,
are delivered, without defence, into the cabinet of the prince,
to the most insidious interpretations, to the most unfaithful
representations. The colonists are still too happy, if their
demand of justice is not construed into a crime, and if their
most moderate remonstrances are not punished as acts of
rebellion. In a word, little is cared for their affection,
nothing is feared for their resentment, and their despair is
contemned." <a name="FNanchor_5_124" id=
"FNanchor_5_124"></a><a href="#fn5_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a> Government from a distance meant government
by strangers irresponsible to the governed, and therefore with no
interest in governing well. The officials of a colony in these
circumstances "resemble the official class in British India,
which exclusively governs, but does not settle, and which regards
the natives as a race only fit to be governed by a superior
race." <a name="FNanchor_5_125" id="FNanchor_5_125"></a><a href=
"#fn5_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
<p>All this contrasted very unfavourably with the system pursued
in the earlier American colonies, which had governed themselves
from the beginning. There were, he thought, two possible
principles of government, on either of which, or on a combination
of both, a colonial system might be based. First, the municipal
principle of local self-government; secondly, the central
principle of government from the distant centre of an empire.
<a name="FNanchor_5_126" id="FNanchor_5_126"></a><a href=
"#fn5_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Either of these might be
adopted apart altogether from the question whether the government
should be democratic, artistocratic [<i>sic</i>], or despotic.
The history of the English colonies, as he conceived it,
consisted in a change from the municipal to the central
principle, a change entirely for the worse. "The English have
reason to be proud of the wisdom of their ancestors. All the
early colonies of the English were allowed to govern themselves
from the beginning; with this single exception, that the
mother-country reserved to herself a monopoly of the foreign
trade of the colony. In every case the colonial laws were made by
an assembly of colonists, elected by the colonists; and in some
cases those laws were executed by officers, including the
governor, who were appointed by the colonists." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_127" id="FNanchor_5_127"></a><a href="#fn5_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a> This was a successful example of the
municipal principle, and while it lasted, the colonies were well
governed and contented. The results of the change to the central
principle were disastrous. "The first effectual trial of the
central system by England was our attempt to deprive the great
English colonies in America of their dearest municipal right. It
cost us their allegiance. This wound to our national pride seems
to have brought the municipal principle into disfavour, when it
should have rather produced aversion to the central." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_128" id="FNanchor_5_128"></a><a href="#fn5_128"
class="fnanchor">[128]</a> When conquered colonies were taken
over by England, and again when penal settlements were founded,
self-government was considered inapplicable to both, and the
central principle triumphed. "No sooner, however, did the English
take possession of colonies, which had been founded by other
nations without any provision for local self-government, than the
aristocracy of England found out the advantage of holding
colonies in subjection. This advantage became still more clear
when the English Government had made a settlement in New Holland;
had established a jail there; a society, which, of course, could
not be allowed to govern itself." <a name="FNanchor_5_129" id=
"FNanchor_5_129"></a><a href="#fn5_129" class=
"fnanchor">[129]</a> Wakefield never tired of insisting that
governing a colony from Downing Street was a complete novelty in
British colonial policy. The only colony, deserving the name,
which had been founded without local self-government was "the
miserable Swan River settlement." <a name="FNanchor_5_130" id=
"FNanchor_5_130"></a><a href="#fn5_130" class=
"fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
<p>His remedy, then, for all the evils of colonial misgovernment
was no new thing, but a return to the "older and freer polity"
<a name="FNanchor_5_131" id="FNanchor_5_131"></a><a href=
"#fn5_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> of the American colonies.
Several reasons he adduced in favour of self-government. In the
first place, it was the cheapest method both for mother-country
and colony. Adam Smith had shown this in the case of the American
colonies. "All the different civil establishments in North
America, in short, exclusive of those of Maryland and North
Carolina, of which no exact account has been got, did not, before
the commencement of the present disturbances, cost the
inhabitants above £64,700 a year; an ever-memorable example at
how small an expense three millions of people may not only be
governed, but well governed." <a name="FNanchor_5_132" id=
"FNanchor_5_132"></a><a href="#fn5_132" class=
"fnanchor">[132]</a> By way of contrast the Swan River colony,
when the population was about 1,500, had cost England nearly
£7,000 a year. <a name="FNanchor_5_133" id=
"FNanchor_5_133"></a><a href="#fn5_133" class=
"fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p>In the second place, self-government would mean better
government for the colonists, since power would be in the hands
of those who had the deepest interest in using it well. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_134" id="FNanchor_5_134"></a><a href="#fn5_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>
<p>In the third place, self-government would make a colony more
attractive to the better class of emigrants. The earliest
settlers who went to America were fit to found empires, but they
would never have quitted England without a prospect of
self-government. "It was thus, that men of a superior order were
induced to run the risk of failure in those enterprises; men who,
by their energy, judgment, patience, and resolution, were
especially qualified to make those enterprises succeed. As a
colony fit to manage its own affairs would not submit to have
them managed from a distance, so a colony allowed to manage its
own affairs would attract men fit to manage them." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_135" id="FNanchor_5_135"></a><a href="#fn5_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
<p>In the last place, self-governing colonies would be able and
willing to protect themselves. Virtual independence would be so
much worth having that it would be worth protecting. Colonists
would provide for their own defence, and relieve the
mother-country of this heavy burden. <a name="FNanchor_5_136" id=
"FNanchor_5_136"></a><a href="#fn5_136" class=
"fnanchor">[136]</a></p>
<p>The connection of Wakefield's economic with his political
theory is shown in the fact that, while he urged self-government
as a means of making colonies attractive to the better class of
emigrants, he thought it would be impossible to withhold
self-government from a colony which, by the application of his
economic system, had become an extension of an old society. Such
a colony, being fit, would be able to govern itself, and its
inhabitants would never submit to being governed from a distance.
"With the capacity for self-government comes the power to
exercise it. A people entirely fit to manage themselves will
never long submit to be managed by others, much less to be
managed by an authority residing at a great distance from them. .
. . Let colonies be old societies in new places, and they will
have the power to chuse between self-government and government
from a distance. That they would chuse to govern themselves
cannot be doubted by anyone who is at all acquainted with the
evils of being governed from a distance." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_137" id="FNanchor_5_137"></a><a href="#fn5_137"
class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Wakefield was never an advocate of
separation. On the contrary, he firmly believed in maintaining
the colonial relation. For this reason he considered that one
great advantage of self-government lay in strengthening the bonds
between the colony and the mother-country. It might not, in the
long run, prevent separation, but it would certainly postpone the
day indefinitely. Any people, especially Englishmen, who were for
long governed from a distance and denied a share in controlling
their own affairs, were apt to rebel. "A people, governed from
afar, and continually increasing their territory, must have a
continually increasing tendency to rebellion." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_138" id="FNanchor_5_138"></a><a href="#fn5_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a> But with the grant of self-government
the feeling for separation would decrease, the desire for further
independence would go, and the relation between mother-country
and colony would be amicable and enduring.</p>
<p>Wakefield's views on responsible government <a name=
"FNanchor_5_139" id="FNanchor_5_139"></a><a href="#fn5_139"
class="fnanchor">[139]</a> as a colonial policy will be best
dealt with when considering the part which he played in Durham's
mission to Canada in 1838. <a name="FNanchor_5_140" id=
"FNanchor_5_140"></a><a href="#fn5_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a> For the present it is sufficient to say
that, advocating as he did self-government for colonies, and
being brought face to face in Canada with the problem of how
self-government might be made to work to the best advantage, he
perceived how essential it was to this object that the colonial
executive should be made responsible to the colonial legislature.
Without this responsibility, colonial self-government was a
contradiction in terms. Indeed in his <i>Letter from Sydney</i>,
written nine years before Lord Durham's mission, he made a
remarkable anticipation of the policy underlying the famous
Report. "The mother-country, . . . in governing the colony, would
consult the greatest advantage of the colonists, in order to
preserve their friendship; and the colonists, having much to
lose, and being incapable of dispersion, would feel a wholesome
dread of war. The colonists, being an instructed and civilized
people, would be as well qualified to govern themselves as the
people of Britain; and, being a wealthy people, they would be
able, without going to war, to assert the birth-right of all
British subjects&mdash;to enforce in the British Parliament,
against a bad British Ministry, their claim to equality before
the law. Qualified, entitled, and powerful to govern themselves,
they might either take a share in framing the general laws of the
empire, by means of their representatives in the British
Parliament; or, if a mean jealousy on the part of Englishmen
should prevent such an arrangement, <i>they might frame their own
laws, in a Colonial Assembly, under the eye of a viceroy,
incapable of wrongs and possessing a veto like the king of
England, but whose secretaries, like the ministers of England,
should he responsible to the people</i>. <a name="FNanchor_5_141"
id="FNanchor_5_141"></a><a href="#fn5_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> At all events, they must be governed, by
whatever machinery, with a view to their good and their
contentment, which is the greatest good, instead of to the
satisfaction of their governors only. This would render them
happy in a most intimate connection with their mother-country;
and the American war of independence would no longer be a
favourite theme in the still dependent colonies of Britain.
Mutual dependence would prevent oppression on the one part, and
on the other, a wish for independence; reciprocity of interest
would occasion mutual goodwill; there would no longer be
injurious distinctions, or malignant jealousies, or vulgar hatred
between British subjects, wherever born; and Britain would become
the centre of the most extensive, the most civilized, and, above
all, the happiest empire in the world." <a name="FNanchor_5_142"
id="FNanchor_5_142"></a><a href="#fn5_142" class=
"fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
<p>When anyone develops a theory, whether in economics, politics,
or in any other branch of knowledge, the question of the
originality of his ideas is certain to be canvassed. Supporters
will hail the theory as an entirely new discovery, opponents will
deny to its author all claims to originality, and seek to assign
its various elements to previous thinkers. With a theory around
which bitter controversy raged for years, Wakefield did not
escape this fate. In turn he has been acclaimed as the maker of
an important discovery in political economy, <a name=
"FNanchor_5_143" id="FNanchor_5_143"></a><a href="#fn5_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and denounced as an impudent borrower
of other men's ideas. Karl Marx, who looked upon the Wakefield
system as one more capitalistic attempt to apply in a new world
old-world methods of exploiting the labourer, briefly dismisses
his claim to originality thus: "Wakefield's few glimpses on the
subject of modern colonization are fully anticipated by Mirabeau
Père, the physiocrat, and even much earlier by English
economists." <a name="FNanchor_5_144" id=
"FNanchor_5_144"></a><a href="#fn5_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
<p>Mr. J. D. Rogers, who seems to underrate Wakefield's influence
on Australasian colonization, gives a somewhat different ancestry
to the theory, laying stress on Wakefield's debt to the schemes
tried in Australia in 1827-9, "which had matured before he began
his crude studies." <a name="FNanchor_5_145" id=
"FNanchor_5_145"></a><a href="#fn5_145" class=
"fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
<p>The article in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, <a name=
"FNanchor_5_146" id="FNanchor_5_146"></a><a href="#fn5_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a> which Dr. Garnett mentions <a name=
"FNanchor_5_147" id="FNanchor_5_147"></a><a href="#fn5_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a> as containing some anticipation of
Wakefield's views, refers only to that part which deals with the
importance of the "field of employment" for capital. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_148" id="FNanchor_5_148"></a><a href="#fn5_148"
class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
<p>On the strength of a speech on emigration which he had made in
the House of Commons in 1827, Colonel Torrens later claimed to
have anticipated that part of the Wakefield system which
concerned the sale of waste land, and the application of the
proceeds to emigration. After the Wakefield theory had passed
into the realm of practice, Torrens put forward this claim
several times, <a name="FNanchor_5_149" id=
"FNanchor_5_149"></a><a href="#fn5_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a> and it was made on his behalf in a
semi-official publication on South Australia. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_150" id="FNanchor_5_150"></a><a href="#fn5_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The speech, however, does not warrant
this claim. According to Torrens, he himself had "urged on
Parliament the expedience of converting the waste lands of the
colonies into an emigration fund." <a name="FNanchor_5_151" id=
"FNanchor_5_151"></a><a href="#fn5_151" class=
"fnanchor">[151]</a> What he really had advocated was Wilmot
Horton's plan of pauper location financed by the repayment of
capital by the emigrants. The sale of waste lands he had indeed
urged, but merely as a source of revenue to the mother-country,
following the example of the United States of America. "Such an
emigration, too, would be a measure of economy and retrenchment,
and a source of growing revenue. The expense of locating the
able-bodied poor in the colonies would be less than that of
maintaining them at home; the rapid reproduction of capital, when
applied to fertile soil, would enable them, in a short period, to
replace the expenses of their first establishment; while the
value which the influx of an industrious population bestowed upon
the colonial lands at the disposal of the Crown, would become a
permanent source of national revenue, and of clear and unbought
advantage to the country." <a name="FNanchor_5_152" id=
"FNanchor_5_152"></a><a href="#fn5_15" class=
"fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
<p>William Charles Wentworth, who was afterwards famous in New
South Wales politics, had, in 1824, suggested a plan of
colonization which bears some resemblance to that of Wakefield.
<a name="FNanchor_5_153" id="FNanchor_5_153"></a><a href=
"#fn5_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> He proposed emigration to
New South Wales as a remedy for pauperism in England, and
indicated how a fund might be obtained for the purpose. The
poor-rate was to provide £10 a year for 14 years for every family
of five sent out from the parish. The emigrants were to be
settled on farms for which they were to pay an annual rent of £10
after the third year of their settlement. The initial expense of
emigration was to be met by a loan guaranteed by Parliament, and
redeemed by the proceeds of the poor-rate and rents. A Board of
Emigration was to be established to carry out the system, which
he hoped would very soon be maintained by the rents,
independently of any other aid. <a name="FNanchor_5_154" id=
"FNanchor_5_154"></a><a href="#fn5_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, neither the mere plan of selling waste lands, nor
their exchange for emigrants, was entirely new. In the United
States, waste land had long been sold at auction, and the
proceeds used as general revenue. Even in New South Wales, a
system of selling land had been initiated in 1826, and extended
in 1828, <a name="FNanchor_5_155" id=
"FNanchor_5_155"></a><a href="#fn5_155" class=
"fnanchor">[155]</a> although not until 1831 was it the sole
method of granting land. <a name="FNanchor_5_156" id=
"FNanchor_5_156"></a><a href="#fn5_156" class=
"fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
<p>Again there had been tried in Van Diemen's Land an arrangement
with the Van Diemen's Land Company which practically meant an
exchange of land revenue for labour. Unable to secure convict
labourers, against whose employment they were allowed to set off
a certain proportion of the quit-rent levied on their land, the
Company proposed to send out emigrant free-labourers of both
sexes, if the Government would make the same concession. This
experiment was carried out in 1828. <a name="FNanchor_5_157" id=
"FNanchor_5_157"></a><a href="#fn5_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
<p>Even in the Colonial Office Regulations for the Swan River
Colony in 1829, provision was made for an exchange of land for
labour. Settlers might obtain grants of land at the rate of 200
acres for every labourer conveyed to the colony. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_158" id="FNanchor_5_158"></a><a href="#fn5_158"
class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Wakefield himself at first admitted
that if this were the sole condition of obtaining land, and if
the number of acres were much diminished, the proposal would be
similar to his own. <a name="FNanchor_5_159" id=
"FNanchor_5_159"></a><a href="#fn5_159" class=
"fnanchor">[159]</a></p>
<p>Although the constituent parts of the Wakefield system, then,
were not by any means new, they had not been combined together
into a coherent and plausible theory. They had existed as
separate plans and practical proposals for colonization, but they
lacked unity. But, even in this respect, his whole theory seems
to have been largely anticipated in the almost unknown writings
of Robert Gourlay. Gourlay was a crack-brained Scotch-Canadian,
with some ability, many violent opinions, and little judgment. He
had distinguished himself in 1824 by horse-whipping Brougham at
Westminster for not attending to a letter which he had written to
him. His career in Canada was notable for the persecution which
he suffered on account of his political views. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_160" id="FNanchor_5_160"></a><a href="#fn5_160"
class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
<p>In 1822 he published a book giving a statistical account of
Upper Canada, in the general introduction to which he developed a
complete theory of colonization. <a name="FNanchor_5_161" id=
"FNanchor_5_161"></a><a href="#fn5_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a> In form and arrangement the book is
unattractive, and it is impossible not to agree with Wakefield
that "the author . . . has mixed up with much valuable
statistical information an account of his own pre-eminent
misfortunes and a picture of his own mental sufferings, so
distressing, or . . . so annoying, to the reader, that it becomes
difficult to extract from his book those parts which are merely
useful." <a name="FNanchor_5_162" id=
"FNanchor_5_162"></a><a href="#fn5_162" class=
"fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
<p>With Gourlay, as with Wakefield, emigration was to be a remedy
for the redundancy of population in England. He set out to
discover a plan which would settle emigrants in large numbers in
Canada without any expense to England. <a name="FNanchor_5_163"
id="FNanchor_5_163"></a><a href="#fn5_163" class=
"fnanchor">[163]</a> He attributed Canada's lack of prosperity to
the superabundance of land. "Land in America is the very
lubber-fiend which checks its own improvement. Could nine-tenths
of it be sunk in the sea, and afterwards emerge by tenths,
gradually, as it became absolutely necessary for the wants of
mankind, there would be infinite gain in every way." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_164" id="FNanchor_5_164"></a><a href="#fn5_164"
class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The colonists, dispersed over a wide
area because of the method of disposing of lands, were wasting
their strength and retrograding in civilization. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_165" id="FNanchor_5_165"></a><a href="#fn5_165"
class="fnanchor">[165]</a> In Canada the Clergy Reserves, and the
free grants of land, had so scattered the settlers that it was
impossible for them to cultivate land with economy and profit.
<a name="FNanchor_5_166" id="FNanchor_5_166"></a><a href=
"#fn5_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> In the United States, on
the other hand, in the parts contiguous to Canada there was more
population and greater prosperity because land was uniformly
sold. As with Wakefield, his remedy was restriction of the
quantity of land, "It should never be forgotten that wild land is
the chief bane of this country, and no fair means should be left
unemployed to lessen it." <a name="FNanchor_5_167" id=
"FNanchor_5_167"></a><a href="#fn5_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a> He proposed a general land-tax on all land,
waste or cultivated, public or private, whether owned by
residents or by absentees, so that speculative holding of land in
an uncultivated state would be unprofitable. <a name=
"FNanchor_5_168" id="FNanchor_5_168"></a><a href="#fn5_168"
class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In addition he constantly urged the
sale of waste lands instead of the method of free grants. The
restrictive operation of a wild-land tax would, in his opinion,
be such that it was worth imposing even though the proceeds were
thrown away. "Such is the peculiar situation of landed property
in this province that I am fully convinced, were £200,000 or
£300,000 raised annually by taxation, on the principle proposed
by me, and thrown into Lake Ontario, it would tend to good."
<a name="FNanchor_5_169" id="FNanchor_5_169"></a><a href=
"#fn5_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But the best way to use
this fund was in bringing emigrants from England and settling
them in Canada. When brought out, they should be employed in
useful public works. "Suppose the same sum of £300,000 raised by
taxation, was, instead of being thrown into Lake Ontario,
employed in bringing poor people out of England . . . . Suppose
that these people were kept two years employed in mere idleness .
. .; by this policy, much more would be gained to the province,
than by throwing the cash into the Lake. It would create a market
for produce, give circulation to money, and stimulate the
industry of farmers and others; besides all which, it would add
greatly to the strength and value of the province by the increase
of settlers. But if by the raising, and thus foolishly
squandering away so much money, so many advantages are to be
produced, what would be the mighty triumph of economy, when the
money and labour was expended on useful public works." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_170" id="FNanchor_5_170"></a><a href="#fn5_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Not merely was Canada to be peopled in
this way, but to it were to be transferred all the advantages of
the civilization possessed by an old society. "The mere filling
of the world with men, should not be the sole object of political
wisdom . . . . Is it not possible to create such a tide of
commerce as would not only bring with it <i>part</i> of society,
but society complete, with all the strength and order and
refinement which it has now attained in Britain?" <a name=
"FNanchor_5_171" id="FNanchor_5_171"></a><a href="#fn5_171"
class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This could not be hoped for under the
existing system of pauper emigration which brought out "only a
part, and that the weakest part of society," <a name=
"FNanchor_5_172" id="FNanchor_5_172"></a><a href="#fn5_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a> namely, destitute individuals, and
settled them in remote districts. Even in the suggestions of
self-government, imperial control of waste lands, and the mutual
benefit of colonization to mother-country and colony, his theory
was not wanting. "Giving independence to the colonies, and
withdrawing from all interferences in their domestic government,
is quite compatible with our retaining the right of disposing of
unappropriated land, and drawing a revenue from thence; quite
compatible with the colonists remaining under British
sovereignty. This country has the power of directing the current
of emigration to any of her colonies; and all property must
improve in value as population becomes more dense, and where
judicious settlement is made. Hence there is scope for mutual
benefits. Colonies may grow strong from an increase of people;
and the mother-country may go on for ages reaping profit from the
land she settles out of her redundant population." <a name=
"FNanchor_5_173" id="FNanchor_5_173"></a><a href="#fn5_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>
<p>Wakefield himself never publicly acknowledged this obvious
debt to Gourlay, but, according to the latter's story, he did
privately when in Canada in 1838. Gourlay's account of their
meeting is circumstantial enough. He relates that, one evening in
1838, a gentleman called to see him. "He introduced
himself&mdash;Mr. Wakefield (the same who had been announced in
the newspapers as accompanying Lord Durham, to instruct as to
settling the wild lands of Canada). He told me that he was the
writer of letters which appeared in the London <i>Spectator</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_5_174" id="FNanchor_5_174"></a><a href=
"#fn5_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> some seven years ago,
regarding me. I called to mind the letters: they were highly
complimentary, and intended to draw towards me the notice of the
Grey Ministry. Never before having known to whom I was thus
obliged I thanked Mr. Wakefield . . . . He then went on to say
that he was also author of a pamphlet on Colonization, <a name=
"FNanchor_5_175" id="FNanchor_5_175"></a><a href="#fn5_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a> which was sent to me, soon after,
under the frank of Lord Howick . . . . Mr. Wakefield said he had
taken his ideas on colonization from my book. I replied that it
gave a very imperfect view of my projects: . . . Mr. Wakefield
added, 'Nevertheless, Government has established a colony
<a name="FNanchor_5_176" id="FNanchor_5_176"></a><a href=
"#fn5_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> on your principles, in
Australia.'" <a name="FNanchor_5_177" id=
"FNanchor_5_177"></a><a href="#fn5_177" class=
"fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
<p>Wherever Wakefield got his ideas, he was sufficiently original
in his new combination of them into a theory. He impressed his
own individuality on his borrowed thoughts, and rendered them
again in a new and attractive manner. Probably the most original
part of his theory, which was also the part upon which he most
insisted, was the notion that there could be fixed an ideal price
on waste land, sufficient in itself for the restrictive purpose
of providing combinable labour.</p>

<i>Cf</i>. J. S. Mill, <i>Political Economy</i>, Book iv. Chap.
iv, § 2. "Mr. Wakefield, in his Commentary on Adam Smith, and his
important writings on Colonization, takes a much clearer view of
the subject, and arrives, through a substantially correct series
of deductions, at practical conclusions which appear to me just
and important; but he is not equally happy in incorporating his
valuable speculations with the results of previous thought, and
reconciling them with other truths . . . . Mr. Wakefield's
explanation of the fall of profits is briefly this. Production is
limited not solely by the quantity of capital and labour, but
also by the extent of the 'field of employment.' The field of
employment for capital is twofold; the land of the country, and
the capacity of foreign markets to take its manufactured
commodities. On a limited extent of land, only a limited quantity
of capital can find employment at a profit. As the quantity of
capital approaches this limit, profit falls; when the limit is
attained, profit is annihilated; and can only be restored through
an extension of the field of employment, either by the
acquisition of fertile land, or by opening new markets in foreign
countries, from which food and materials can be purchased with
the products of domestic capital. These propositions are in my
opinion substantially true; and, even to the phraseology in which
they are expressed, considered as adapted to popular and
practical rather than scientific uses, I have nothing to object.
The error which seems to me imputable to Mr. Wakefield is that of
supposing his doctrines to be in contradiction to the principles
of the best school of preceding political economists, instead of
being, as they really are, corollaries from those principles;
though corollaries which, perhaps, would not always have been
admitted by those political economists themselves."</p>

<i>Ibid</i>., pp. 93-4. This argument is developed at some length
in the <i>Colonial Gazette</i>, October 9th, 1839. "The argument
in favour of preferring trade with independent states to
colonizing for the sake of trade, rests altogether on one great
fallacy. It is taken for granted that the world abounds in
independent states, having wants which England can supply,
producing commodities which England wants, and desirous of making
the exchange. Where be they? The English would gladly trade with
Japan, but cannot because the Japanese will not trade with the
English. What can be more precarious than the trade of England
with the 'independent state' of China? More or less in all the
countries of Europe, trade with England is impeded&mdash;in some
it is almost prohibited&mdash;by restrictions imposed by
independent governments. The tariff of the independent United
States is the most serious impediment that exists in the world to
the extension of the trade of England."</p>

<h4>Chapter VI</h4>
<h3>THE NATIONAL COLONIZATION SOCIETY</h3>
<p><span class="a">Soon</span> after the publication of his
theory in the <i>Letter from Sydney</i>, Wakefield began to
gather around him a small, but able and influential, body of men
who accepted his leadership and found in his plans a means of
remedying distress and social evils in Great Britain by
colonization on systematic lines. At first his associates came
from among the younger members of the Benthamite group, who were
favourably disposed to listen to the doctrines of the son of
Edward Wakefield; but, as his activities and his prestige alike
grew, he counted amongst his adherents men drawn from every side
of political life, who often disagreed on all points but
systematic colonization. <a name="FNanchor_6_1" id=
"FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#fn6_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "The
history of any definite 'school' of philosophic or political
opinion," writes Mr. Graham Wallas, "will generally show that its
foundation was made possible by personal friendship. So few men
devote themselves to continuous thought, that if several think on
the same lines for many years it is almost always because they
have encouraged each other to proceed. And varieties of opinion
and temperament are so infinite, that those who accept a new
party name, and thereby make themselves responsible for each
other's utterances, are generally bound by personal loyalty as
well as by intellectual agreement." <a name="FNanchor_6_2" id=
"FNanchor_6_2"></a><a href="#fn6_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This
is essentially true of the systematic colonizers. There was a
small inner circle of Wakefield's intimate friends who constantly
supported him in his long fight against the indifference of the
public and the opposition of a few antagonists. Of these friends
the chief was Charles Buller, <a name="FNanchor_6_3" id=
"FNanchor_6_3"></a><a href="#fn6_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Carlyle's pupil, a man in whom outstanding ability was united
with a personal charm which made him beloved by all his
contemporaries of whatever political party. Wakefield truly said
of him that he had no enemies, <a name="FNanchor_6_4" id=
"FNanchor_6_4"></a><a href="#fn6_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
his great gifts of mind and character make him the most
attractive figure of this group, not excepting even its leader.
Carlyle wrote of him, "A sound penetrating intellect, full of
adroit resources, and loyal by nature itself to all that was
methodic, manful, true&mdash;in brief, a mildly resolute,
chivalrous and gallant character, capable of doing much serious
service." <a name="FNanchor_6_5" id="FNanchor_6_5"></a><a href=
"#fn6_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He possessed a playful and
keen, though never cruel, wit, which often roused in too serious
minds the suspicion that he was merely clever and not in earnest.
Henry Greville records his impression in this way, "Charles
Buller is amusing, but too much of a banterer to please me."
<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#fn6_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "He had," said the obituary notice in
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, "an unfortunate propensity to
indulge in a habit of joking for joking's sake; so that, for many
years, the real sterling talent of his Parliamentary displays was
obscured by what appeared a triviality of mind not to be
corrected or overcome." <a name="FNanchor_6_7" id=
"FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#fn6_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> From
childhood he suffered ill-health, and an impression got abroad
that he was indolent and incapable of really hard work, or of
taking anything seriously enough. "At last he shook off the
occasional flippancy which had detracted from the manly vigour of
his intellect, and had created a prejudice against his
administrative capacity." <a name="FNanchor_6_8" id=
"FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#fn6_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In
1847, when he was appointed President of the poor Law Commission,
he hailed the opportunity of showing that he was not a mere
trifler. "If I do succeed," he wrote to Wakefield, "no one will
ever again say I am a mere talker with no qualities for business.
I incur responsibility, I know: but sweat and risk are the
purchase money of every palm worth wearing." <a name=
"FNanchor_6_9" id="FNanchor_6_9"></a><a href="#fn6_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> His best remembered <i>jeu d'esprit</i> was
uttered when the Radical party in the House of Commons was
gradually dwindling in numbers. "I see what we are coming to,
Grote," he said, "in no very long time from this, only you and I
will be left to 'tell' Molesworth." <a name="FNanchor_6_10" id=
"FNanchor_6_10"></a><a href="#fn6_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p>An able and convincing speaker, he advocated for long in the
House of Commons the cause of the colonies, and the Wakefield
theory of colonization. In 1830, however, he was a new and young
member of the House of Commons, albeit the ablest of the small
group of philosophical radicals, as they were later called, whose
most prominent members were Hume, Leader, Grote, Roebuck, and
Molesworth. Although he had made a reputation by his work on the
Public Record Commission, Buller was a comparatively unknown man
when, in 1837, his talents brought him under the notice of Lord
Durham, who chose him as his chief assistant in his mission to
Canada. On his return, he soon became recognized as a coming man
in the House of Commons. From his facile pen came, in 1840, a
well-reasoned and brilliant statement of the case for responsible
government in the colonies, <a name="FNanchor_6_11" id=
"FNanchor_6_11"></a><a href="#fn6_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
accompanied by amusing, if exaggerated, attacks on the Colonial
Office and its bureaucratic system which he stigmatized as the
reign of Mr. Mothercountry. His premature death in 1848, when he
was but 42 years of age, alone prevented him from rising to a
high position as a statesman.</p>
<p>Buller and Wakefield were life-long friends. Buller not only
possessed the ability and public position which made him a
spokesman in Parliament of the Wakefield theory, but he was also
ready to become Wakefield's pupil in colonial subjects.
Wakefield, at the time of his release in 1830, was 34 years of
age, while Buller was only 24, and, though later, as Wakefield
put it, the relation between them as colonizers was that of "each
other's <i>alter ego</i>." <a name="FNanchor_6_12" id=
"FNanchor_6_12"></a><a href="#fn6_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
yet Buller derived his inspiration and his interest in
colonization from Wakefield. His attention, however, was, unlike
Wakefield's, by no means confined to colonies and colonization,
and he was often able to take a juster view both of the reason in
the opposition which they encountered, and of the motives of
opponents.</p>
<p>Sir William Molesworth, another important member of the group,
was a man of a different type. A "faithful utilitarian," <a name=
"FNanchor_6_13" id="FNanchor_6_13"></a><a href="#fn6_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a> he was distinguished more by the courage and
consistency with which he advocated his opinions, fearless alike
of friend and foe, than by popularity or any charm of manner. In
the eyes of his opponents he appeared an "able but wayward
politician" <a name="FNanchor_6_14" id=
"FNanchor_6_14"></a><a href="#fn6_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
given to the advocacy of foolish crazes of which colonization was
one. He was not an original member of the Colonization Society,
<a name="FNanchor_6_15" id="FNanchor_6_15"></a><a href="#fn6_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but, by 1833, his first session in
Parliament, he had become a supporter of the Wakefield theory. He
was a great personal friend both of Buller and of Wakefield, and
his biographer, Mrs. Fawcett, admits that he looked on them as
masterminds in the sphere of colonization. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_16" id="FNanchor_6_16"></a><a href="#fn6_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a> The chief part which he played in the work of
colonial reform under the tutelage of Wakefield, was to advocate
strenuously the policy of self-government for colonies, and to
maintain that this was quite consistent with a close relation
between mother-country and colony. "It is Molesworth's supreme
title to distinction," writes Mrs. Fawcett, "that he adopted this
view, and made it the chief object of his parliamentary and
public life to educate the country to share it and see its
importance." <a name="FNanchor_6_17" id=
"FNanchor_6_17"></a><a href="#fn6_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Besides this, Molesworth rendered great services to Wakefield by
supporting him in connection with the associations which he
created for the purpose of founding South Australia and New
Zealand. "Molesworth's assistance to these associations in and
out of Parliament was invaluable; he spared neither time, labour,
nor his purse in promoting them." <a name="FNanchor_6_18" id=
"FNanchor_6_18"></a><a href="#fn6_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
His name, too, deserves always to be remembered for the share he
took, as chairman of the Transportation Committee of 1837, in the
attempt to abolish the evils of transportation to Australia.
Great things were hoped by the colonial reformers from his
appointment as Secretary of State for the Colonies in July, 1855,
but he died within a few months of taking office.</p>
<p>Other members of the circle of friends were John Stuart Mill,
George Grote, and R. S. Rintoul. Mill's interests were very much
wider than colonization, but he was always a supporter of the
Wakefield system, <a name="FNanchor_6_19" id=
"FNanchor_6_19"></a><a href="#fn6_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and gave considerable assistance by his advocacy of the policy of
self-government for colonies. <a name="FNanchor_6_20" id=
"FNanchor_6_20"></a><a href="#fn6_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Although, up to 1858, his official position prevented him from
taking an active part in colonization reform, yet he lent to the
Wakefield group the great weight of his private authority.</p>
<p>Grote was probably a member of the Colonization Society, and
certainly aided in the formation of the South Australian
Association, but his absorption in his task as historian of
Greece caused him very soon to withdraw from any public
connection with colonization.</p>
<p>R. S. Rintoul, a Scotch radical, and editor of the
<i>Spectator</i>, which had just been started in 1828, was a firm
friend of Wakefield, and a whole-hearted supporter of his
doctrines. The <i>Spectator</i> became the organ by which the
systematic colonizers brought their doctrines before the public,
and urged on the Government the necessity of change both in the
land systems and in the government of the colonies. Indeed, this
paper was, as Dr. Garnett puts it, a fortress in which the
colonial reformers entrenched themselves. <a name="FNanchor_6_21"
id="FNanchor_6_21"></a><a href="#fn6_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> Wakefield, who wrote articles and letters
innumerable for the <i>Spectator</i>, was fully sensible of his
debt to Rintoul. "I take the opportunity," he wrote in a letter
to Rintoul in 1841, "of publicly expressing my gratitude to you,
as the person to whom I am specially indebted for having been
able to propose with effect recent improvements in the art of
colonization. As editor of the <i>Spectator</i>, you patiently
examined my proposals, and manfully upheld them when they were
treated with disdain or ridicule by nearly all others who thought
it worth while to consider them. It was your support that
encouraged me, not only to maintain a theory offensive from its
novelty and generally disregarded or disapproved, but also to
engage in a variety of labours of which the object was to submit
that theory to the test of practice. Only eleven years have
passed since I began this uphill work, with no helping public
hand but yours; and I think we may say now, that public opinion
has gone a long way towards embracing the main principles of my
scheme . . . . Whilst I know that a large proportion of the
labours by which this system has been set on foot has been
performed without my participation&mdash;whilst I acknowledge
great obligations to many who have afforded to my obscure
exertions a generous and powerful aid&mdash;I am bound to
declare, that for much of that assistance, for having been able
to avail myself of it, for whatever share of credit may be due to
me in the whole matter, I am chiefly indebted to you. I should
have done nothing at all, if you had not constantly helped me
during the years when the pursuit of systematic colonization was
a continual struggle with difficulties." <a name="FNanchor_6_22"
id="FNanchor_6_22"></a><a href="#fn6_22" class=
"fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
<p>Besides these followers there were many others, too numerous
to mention, whom Wakefield attracted to himself, and used in
various ways in furthering his projects. Some put their names to
pamphlets written by Wakefield, others, prompted by him, made
speeches in Parliament or outside, others again advanced money
for his schemes of colonization, waited upon the Government to
urge the acceptance of his plans, and formed themselves into
committees and associations whose aim was the realization in
practice of parts or the whole of the Wakefield theory. In all
the doings of the systematic colonizers, Wakefield was first and
foremost in activity. "It would be affectation to pretend," he
wrote in 1849, "that in the labours of the theorists of 1830, I
have had any but the principal share." <a name="FNanchor_6_23"
id="FNanchor_6_23"></a><a href="#fn6_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a> But he kept himself in the background and was
content to see others move when he pulled the strings. "It is my
habitual and most useful function," he wrote in 1849, "to work,
like the mole, in out-of-sight obscurity." <a name=
"FNanchor_6_24" id="FNanchor_6_24"></a><a href="#fn6_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a> His task consisted in controlling the
enterprises which he set on foot, and in persuading others to
carry out his plans. "I have not time to attend to details," he
wrote to his father in 1841, when busy with the founding of New
Zealand, "almost every hour of my day, to say nothing of nights,
from year's end to year's end, being engaged in taking care of
the principles and main points of our New Zealand enterprise, and
in what Arthur <a name="FNanchor_6_25" id=
"FNanchor_6_25"></a><a href="#fn6_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
calls 'the management of people,' which means the persuading of
all sorts of dispositions to pull together for a common object."
<a name="FNanchor_6_26" id="FNanchor_6_26"></a><a href="#fn6_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p>In this work of management and control he was unequalled. A
strong opponent has well described his activities and their
success, "energetic, tenacious, indefatigable, unscrupulous, with
a wonderful talent for literary agitation, for simultaneously
feeding a hundred journalists with the same idea and the same
illustrations in varying language, for filling eloquent, but
indolent, orators with telling speeches; at one time he had
rallied round him nearly every rising man of political
aspirations, and secured the support of nearly every economical
writer of any celebrity." <a name="FNanchor_6_27" id=
"FNanchor_6_27"></a><a href="#fn6_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p>Wakefield's first step on his release in May, 1830, was, with
the aid of his immediate followers, to establish a society to
promote systematic colonization. "A few people in London in
1830," wrote Wakefield in 1849, "formed an association which they
called the Colonization Society. The object they had in view was,
in general terms, to substitute systematic colonization for mere
emigration, and on a scale sufficient to produce important
effects on the mother-country." <a name="FNanchor_6_28" id=
"FNanchor_6_28"></a><a href="#fn6_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Wakefield believed that it was vain to expect to further his
colonizing projects and to create interest in colonization
without some kind of association, and his experience proved him
right. In 1852, writing to the <i>Spectator</i>, he said, "mere
writing on behalf of colonies, without organized association for
action, is like beating the wind." <a name="FNanchor_6_29" id=
"FNanchor_6_29"></a><a href="#fn6_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
<p>There are some traces of an earlier body, called the
"Emigration Society," which was merged in the National
Colonization Society, as Wakefield's association was called.
<a name="FNanchor_6_30" id="FNanchor_6_30"></a><a href="#fn6_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The secretary of both bodies was Robert
Gouger, who had edited the <i>Letter from Sydney</i>, He had
intended emigrating to the Swan River Colony, but had been
deterred from that course by becoming a convert to Wakefield's
views. <a name="FNanchor_6_31" id="FNanchor_6_31"></a><a href=
"#fn6_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He afterwards became one of
the founders of South Australia, where he was the first Colonial
Secretary, and the records of his journals show him as an
energetic and hard-working member of the Society under the
inspiration and guidance of Wakefield. <a name="FNanchor_6_32"
id="FNanchor_6_32"></a><a href="#fn6_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>Originally the Colonization Society was small in numbers, its
founders were not more than a dozen, and it is not possible to
discover who the original members were. Wakefield says of them,
"they were an unknown and feeble body, composed chiefly of very
young men, some of whose names, however, have long ceased to be
obscure, whilst others are amongst the most celebrated of our
day." <a name="FNanchor_6_33" id="FNanchor_6_33"></a><a href=
"#fn6_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> A list of forty-two members
of the Society is given by Wakefield in <i>England and
America</i>, excluding Grote and himself, but containing the
names of John and William Hutt, Charles Buller, Sir J. C.
Hobhouse, Sir Francis Burdett, John Stuart Mill, and Colonel
Torrens. <a name="FNanchor_6_34" id="FNanchor_6_34"></a><a href=
"#fn6_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p>The objects of the Society, as set out in their first
published pamphlet, were "to establish a general system of
Colonization, founded on the main principles of Selection,
Concentration, and the sale of Waste Land, for the purposes of
Emigration." <a name="FNanchor_6_35" id=
"FNanchor_6_35"></a><a href="#fn6_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
They made use of the term "systematic colonization" as a
convenient way of describing colonization on the lines of the
Wakefield theory. <a name="FNanchor_6_36" id=
"FNanchor_6_36"></a><a href="#fn6_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Their first efforts were occupied with attacking Wilmot Horton
and his plans, and calling attention to the failure of the Swan
River colony, with a view to showing the superiority of their own
plan. They urged on the Government the necessity of requiring a
price on all lands granted in Canada, South Africa and
Australasia. The money obtained from the sales of such land was,
they proposed, to be used in conveying young couples to those
colonies. One function which the Society hoped to perform was to
manage this emigration. Until the fund was available they were
prepared to send out as apprentices to settlers, any orphan and
destitute children whose passage was paid by the parish in
England, or by any benevolent society or individual in Great
Britain or Ireland. <a name="FNanchor_6_37" id=
"FNanchor_6_37"></a><a href="#fn6_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
They were, however, not successful in this latter aim and became,
while they lasted, really a society for propagating the Wakefield
theory, for creating interest in colonization, and for putting
pressure on the Government to reduce systematic colonization to
practice in Australasia. The Society stated and developed
Wakefield's views in a series of pamphlets, <a name=
"FNanchor_6_38" id="FNanchor_6_38"></a><a href="#fn6_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a> some anonymous, others signed by various
members, but almost all composed by Wakefield himself. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_39" id="FNanchor_6_39"></a><a href="#fn6_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> The Colonization Society claimed that their
plan had a twofold object, to remedy by emigration distress and
pauperism in Britain, and to remove by systematic colonization
existing social and economic evils in the colonies. But neither
object seemed to attract much attention in 1830, when the
movement for Parliamentary reform was agitating men's minds. In
1831, Wakefield complained that this difficulty stood in the way
of arousing any interest in colonization or colonial projects.
<a name="FNanchor_6_40" id="FNanchor_6_40"></a><a href="#fn6_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The systematic colonizers had an uphill
struggle in trying to force a new theory upon an indifferent
public and an unwilling government. Their proposals were received
with "disdain or ridicule" <a name="FNanchor_6_41" id=
"FNanchor_6_41"></a><a href="#fn6_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
by those few who considered them, and with "derision and scorn"
<a name="FNanchor_6_42" id="FNanchor_6_42"></a><a href="#fn6_42"
class="fnanchor">[42]</a> by those who had it in their power to
carry them into effect. "It is the common fate of nearly all new
inventions," they observed philosophically, "to be called, for a
time, wild and visionary. The quantity of ridicule and abuse
bestowed on such inventions, is generally in proportion to the
greatness of the objects, and the simplicity of the means by
which it is proposed that those objects should be obtained. The
suggestion of the National Colonization Society has not escaped
the ordinary fate of new proposals having in view great objects;
nor was it to be expected that anything so entirely novel, and
proposing to accomplish objects of such vast importance by means
so very easy of application, should be received, at first,
otherwise than with derision, contempt, or indifference."
<a name="FNanchor_6_43" id="FNanchor_6_43"></a><a href="#fn6_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Wakefield himself, looking back in 1849
on their want of success in attracting public notice at this
time, wrote, "The public at large cared nothing about the matter,
and could not be brought to take the slightest interest in it. If
opponents had been many and much in earnest, converts would not
have been wanting: the general inattention was too complete for
an opposition that might have proved useful." <a name=
"FNanchor_6_44" id="FNanchor_6_44"></a><a href="#fn6_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a> Indeed the only real opposition they met with
at first came from Wilmot Horton, who, from his first
acquaintance with the Wakefield theory, was a strong opponent of
the principle of land-sales. <a name="FNanchor_6_45" id=
"FNanchor_6_45"></a><a href="#fn6_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
In his zeal for emigration he even became a member of the
Society, but incidentally he led to its disruption. Out of
compliment to his interest in the subject he was asked in 1830 to
take the chair at a public meeting of the Society, and from that
position made a speech attacking its principles, the result of
which was that the Society disbanded. <a name="FNanchor_6_46" id=
"FNanchor_6_46"></a><a href="#fn6_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
He also persuaded Colonel Torrens to join him in a controversy
with the members on the question of selling colonial lands. The
chief objection which they took was that a high price on land in
the colonies would compel settlers to cultivate lands of inferior
fertility, while superior land remained uncultivated. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_47" id="FNanchor_6_47"></a><a href="#fn6_47" class=
"fnanchor">[47]</a> The use of the term "concentration" by the
systematic colonizers gave opportunity for misunderstanding their
plan. Colonel Torrens, however, when it was made clear to him
that the concentration intended was merely combination of labour,
admitted that his objection was overcome, became a convert to the
theory, and indeed one of its warmest supporters. "This system of
colonization," Torrens told the 1836 Committee on Waste Lands,
"was first proposed to my consideration by Sir Robert Wilmot
Horton, and he stated to me that it was calculated to produce
congestion upon particular spots of land, to compel the settlers
to cultivate inferior soil, to render their labour and capital
less productive, to reduce wages and profits, which are mainly
determined by the last quality of land under cultivation, and to
occasion rent to be paid upon superior lands as in an old
country. To the principle of colonization, as thus understood, I
certainly had very decided objection. But when, upon
investigation, I found that this system of colonization, rightly
understood, did not involve the necessity of cultivating inferior
land, but, on the contrary, it offered to the settler the most
perfect freedom of cultivating the most fertile land in a very
extensive district, then all the objections which had occurred to
Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and myself when we first looked at the
subject, were to my mind entirely removed, and I became a decided
approver and advocate for the system." <a name="FNanchor_6_48"
id="FNanchor_6_48"></a><a href="#fn6_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a> Mr. Wilmot Horton, on the other hand,
remained sceptical, though he is credited with the curious
suggestion that the Society should have Australia and South
Africa in which to try their theories, while he preserved Canada
as a field of experiment for his own ideas. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_49" id="FNanchor_6_49"></a><a href="#fn6_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p>A more notable convert was Jeremy Bentham. In 1793 he had
urged the French to emancipate their colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_50" id="FNanchor_6_50"></a><a href="#fn6_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> In 1825 he had declared that the possession
of colonies was not necessary in order to carry on trade with
them, and that the capital used in colonial trade might be
applied as productively to other undertakings. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_51" id="FNanchor_6_51"></a><a href="#fn6_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a> Colonization, considered as a means of
increasing the general wealth of the mother-country was, he
thought, "an agreeable folly." On seeing the proposals for
colonizing the Swan River in 1829, he had, however, changed his
opinion as to the value of colonies, and in the summer of 1831,
about a year before his death, he was led to consider the
Wakefield theory and the proposals of the Colonization Society.
After raising several objections he declared his unqualified
approbation of the theory, and wrote in its support. <a name=
"FNanchor_6_52" id="FNanchor_6_52"></a><a href="#fn6_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> These writings were never published but exist
in about fifty pages of manuscript, all difficult to read, and
some almost indecipherable. <a name="FNanchor_6_53" id=
"FNanchor_6_53"></a><a href="#fn6_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
He accepts the principle of restriction underlying the Wakefield
theory, calling it the "vicinity-maximization or
dispersion-preventing principle," and discusses at length and
with considerable attention to detail the proposed plan of
founding a new colony on Spencer's Gulf, South Australia. Since
these writings were never published and Bentham died soon
afterwards, it is not likely that his influence counted for much
in attracting adherents to systematic colonization, except in so
far as men like Grote and Molesworth would be induced to look
favourably upon a theory which Bentham approved. Wakefield did
not receive the unanimous support of the Benthamite group, and he
was all the more pleased to acknowledge Bentham's own approval.
He declared later that the form of <i>England and America</i> was
suggested by Bentham. <a name="FNanchor_6_54" id=
"FNanchor_6_54"></a><a href="#fn6_54" class=
"fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p>After the controversy with Wilmot Horton and his action in
attacking its principles, the Society seems to have broken up.
But its chief members continued to act together and to carry on
their attempt to educate Parliament and the country to their
views on colonization.</p>

"Mr. Wakefield had to assist him in propagating his tenets,"
wrote one of his opponents, "not only the charm of 'style,' but
of personal fascination, with a more than Protean adaptiveness,
which rendered him the friend and bosom adviser of Republicans
and Radicals, Whig and Conservative Peers, Low Church and High
Church Bishops. Five Secretaries of State for the
Colonies&mdash;Lords Glenelg and Stanley, Monteagle, Aberdeen and
Grey&mdash;have been more or less his pupils." Samuel Sidney,

Charles Buller was born in 1806. His father was Charles Buller of
Morval, Cornwall, who was in the revenue department of the East
India Company's service. He was educated first at Harrow, then by
Carlyle, who was his private tutor, then at Trinity College,
Cambridge. He was called to the bar in 1831, but did not practise
until 1838. In 1830 he entered Parliament as member for West
Looe, and after 1832 was member for Liskeard until his death in
1848.</p>

<h4>Chapter VII</h4>
<h3>EARLY EXPERIMENTS IN SYSTEMATIC
COLONIZATION&mdash;1829-1837</h3>
<p><span class="a">In</span> pursuance of their objects the
Colonization Society had in 1830 approached the Government, but
they met with no success while the Duke of Wellington was in
office. <a name="FNanchor_7_1" id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href=
"#fn7_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Sir George Murray, then
Secretary of State for the Colonies, told them that the
Government rather wished to discourage emigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_2" id="FNanchor_7_2"></a><a href="#fn7_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> With a change of Ministry and the advent of
Lord Goderich and Lord Howick to the Colonial Office at the end
of 1830, their renewed representations had a more favourable
reception. They achieved their first public success when, in
January, 1831, the Government determined to adopt some measure of
the Wakefield theory by making a great change in the disposal of
waste lands in New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land and Western
Australia. <a name="FNanchor_7_3" id="FNanchor_7_3"></a><a href=
"#fn7_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>In an old and thickly populated country the distribution of
land has a powerful effect upon all social and political
phenomena. Even in a new country with an apparently illimitable
supply of land and a scanty and widely scattered population, as
Australia possessed in 1830, the land question very soon emerges
into importance.</p>
<p>The foundation of a new colony would seem to offer an
unexampled opportunity for laying down a fair and equitable
system of land holding and settlement, elastic enough to adapt
itself to the needs of a growing community. It might be thought
that those who were concerned in founding the Australian colonies
would have attempted to introduce the general lines of such a
system, or at least would have proceeded cautiously in a matter
where a wrong step taken at the start might profoundly affect the
future prosperity of these colonies, and prove exceedingly
difficult to retrace. But none of these considerations seemed to
have troubled the British Government in founding the earlier
Australian colonies, and in devising rules for land settlement.
Throughout their earlier stages there was no regular or uniform
system of disposing of waste lands. <a name="FNanchor_7_4" id=
"FNanchor_7_4"></a><a href="#fn7_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In
New South Wales land had been given away without regard to its
existing or future value. "Probably no more extravagant and
careless system of land distribution has ever been adopted in a
British colony than that of the first fifteen years of Australian
settlement." <a name="FNanchor_7_5" id=
"FNanchor_7_5"></a><a href="#fn7_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Indeed, the land question in the beginning only arose
incidentally out of the character of the settlements. These
colonies were intended merely as prisons which should at once rid
Great Britain of her criminals, and provide for their punishment
and reform. Exile was part of the punishment, the land was part
of the means of reformation. Free grants of land were made to
emancipated convicts in order to give them an opportunity of
making a fresh start in life in a new country. When free settlers
came, all that was done was to extend the same system to them,
except that the grants were on a more liberal scale.</p>
<p>Up to 1810, the usual method had been to grant land to
emancipated convicts or to free settlers, subject to conditions
as to quit-rents. These grants were made at the absolute
discretion of the Governor, and during this period were large in
amount though not in number. Free emigration was then on such a
small scale that each application for land was dealt with on its
merits, and no universal rule was laid down. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_6" id="FNanchor_7_6"></a><a href="#fn7_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p>As far as the Home Government had any aim at this time it was
to encourage the formation of a class of peasant proprietors; but
the land got into few hands, and the attempt was a dismal
failure. <a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href=
"#fn7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Land was, apparently,
considered as a bounty on emigration. If a man were so bold as to
pay his passage and try his fortune in one of these penal
colonies, his hardihood was rewarded with a free grant of land.
During this period, up to 1810, there had been granted in New
South Wales 117,269 acres. <a name="FNanchor_7_8" id=
"FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#fn7_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p>During the next stage, 1810-1822, while Governor Macquarie
held office, the Home Government seems to have determined to
encourage capitalists to come to Australia. Anyone arriving there
received, on conditions as to quit-rents and cultivation, a free
grant of land in proportion to the capital which he could
persuade the Governor that he possessed and was prepared to
invest in the colony. Sometimes the capital was fictitious
<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#fn7_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or was obligingly lent to the applicant
by an accommodating friend. This system, though not the sole
method of granting land, lasted until 1830.</p>
<p>During this stage the tendency was to make the grants smaller
in amount, and the power of granting land still lay with the
Governor alone. "In general, land was given to anyone who asked
for it and who had the means of cultivating and stocking it. But
the Governor had complete, unfettered and unquestioned power to
refuse such a request without further explanation." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_10" id="FNanchor_7_10"></a><a href="#fn7_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> During the years of his office, Macquarie
granted in all 239,576 acres, bringing the total alienated by
1820 to 356,845 acres. <a name="FNanchor_7_11" id=
"FNanchor_7_11"></a><a href="#fn7_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p>By 1824, the Home Government had decided to introduce side by
side with this system the sale of waste lands. Instructions were
sent out to divide the colony into counties, hundreds and
parishes, and to strike an "average price" for which all
unappropriated land might be sold, subject merely to a nominal
quit-rent.</p>
<p>At the same time the older method was retained of granting
land at the Governor's discretion to settlers in proportion to
their capital. <a name="FNanchor_7_12" id=
"FNanchor_7_12"></a><a href="#fn7_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Throughout these stages land was looked upon by the Government as
a ready means of rewarding naval and military officers, and of
making provision for colonial officials. With small deviations
these regulations were repeated in 1826 and 1828. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_13" id="FNanchor_7_13"></a><a href="#fn7_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p>By 1828 the land alienated in New South Wales amounted to
2,906,346 acres. <a name="FNanchor_7_14" id=
"FNanchor_7_14"></a><a href="#fn7_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This very large increase was due, not only to the necessity of
meeting the claims of an increasing population, but also to the
fact that, in 1824, a large grant of about 1,000,000 acres in New
South Wales had been made to the Australian Agricultural Company,
on the usual conditions as to quit-rents. <a name="FNanchor_7_15"
id="FNanchor_7_15"></a><a href="#fn7_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, in 1825, a similar grant of about
350,000 acres was made to the Van Diemen's Land Company. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_16" id="FNanchor_7_16"></a><a href="#fn7_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a> By the end of 1830, no less than 3,344,030
acres had been alienated in New South Wales. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_17" id="FNanchor_7_17"></a><a href="#fn7_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p>Besides these methods of grants and sales there was another
way of disposing of pastoral land, which afterwards was to lead
to the system of "squatting," characteristic of Australian
land-holding, over which many bitter fights were to be fought.
Very early in the history of Australian settlement the Crown
granted leases to colonists to enable them to pasture their
flocks and herds on unoccupied lands. This was, however,
authorized occupation, which was not of course freehold, and,
indeed, carried no title to the land itself. The regime of
"squatting" or unauthorized occupation of land had, by 1830,
hardly begun. The settlers were still confined by order to
certain districts&mdash;afterwards known as the "Old Settled
Districts"&mdash;where alone they were allowed to occupy land.
<a name="FNanchor_7_18" id="FNanchor_7_18"></a><a href="#fn7_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p>Such then, in 1830, was the complicated and wasteful "system"
of disposing of Crown Lands in the Australian colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#fn7_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a> There was no consistent and definite policy
underlying it. Land was used as a bounty on emigration, as a
means of raising revenue for the Crown, as an inducement to
capitalists to settle, and as a reward for those who had rendered
service to the colony or the mother-country. In these
circumstances it was little wonder that the "system" gave no
satisfaction to the colonists, who charged it with conducing to
favouritism and corruption on the part of the Colonial
Government. <a name="FNanchor_7_20" id=
"FNanchor_7_20"></a><a href="#fn7_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Intending settlers could not be certain on what terms and in what
amount they might obtain land, or even whether they would receive
any at all. Sometimes emigrants arrived only to find that the
regulations which had been in existence when they sailed had been
changed. <a name="FNanchor_7_21" id="FNanchor_7_21"></a><a href=
"#fn7_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Indeed the system of grants
and the discretion allowed to the Governor were both
unsatisfactory to settlers. If they possessed influence with the
Secretary of State or with other men in high places, land was not
very difficult to obtain. <a name="FNanchor_7_22" id=
"FNanchor_7_22"></a><a href="#fn7_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
On the other hand, however deserving they might be, they had no
redress if the Governor chose to withhold a grant from them.
Governor Darling, indeed, was accused by his opponents of
refusing grants to those whose only disqualification was that
they had come under his displeasure or that of his officials.
<a name="FNanchor_7_23" id="FNanchor_7_23"></a><a href="#fn7_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Lord Stanley, in 1842, described the
system as one that varied almost from year to year, causing
disappointment to settlers, leading to disputed titles and great
litigation, and checking the emigration both of labour and
capital to the colony. <a name="FNanchor_7_24" id=
"FNanchor_7_24"></a><a href="#fn7_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Even from the point of view of the Colonial Government it was so
unsatisfactory that, when an end was put to it in 1831, Governor
Arthur of Van Diemen's Land, although he by no means approved of
the new, yet "heartily rejoiced" that the old system was no more.
<a name="FNanchor_7_25" id="FNanchor_7_25"></a><a href="#fn7_25"

<p>The first intimation of a change in 1831 was a despatch from
Lord Goderich to Governor Darling on the 9th January, announcing
his intention to introduce, in the near future, a uniform system
of sale in New South Wales, and instructing Darling, in the
meantime, to discontinue all further grants except by way of
sale. <a name="FNanchor_7_26" id="FNanchor_7_26"></a><a href=
"#fn7_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> His intention was realized in
a despatch of the 14th February, 1831, containing Royal
Instructions to Darling as to the disposal of waste lands, and
enclosing the printed terms of the new regulations for intending
settlers&mdash;afterwards well known as the Ripon Regulations.
<a name="FNanchor_7_27" id="FNanchor_7_27"></a><a href="#fn7_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The Governor was instructed that all
lands not hitherto granted, and not appropriated for public
purposes were to be disposed of in no other way than by sale at
auction at a minimum price of not less than five shillings per
acre. A deposit of 10 per cent. was required from the purchaser,
and the remainder was to be paid within a month, or possession
was not granted and the sale was void. Grants thus obtained were
to be subject to no conditions whatever except a nominal
quit-rent of a peppercorn. The land was to be put up for sale in
lots of not less than 640 acres, except in special circumstances
when, on application to the Governor, the quantity might be
reduced. With the Governor, however, rested the sole power of
deciding what lands should be exposed for sale and what lands
withheld. Lands which were required for grazing purposes were to
be let on lease from year to year, but, if applied for by
intending purchasers, were to be sold at auction in the same way
as other land.</p>
<p>At the same time another reform was instituted by this
despatch. Crown reserves for Church or School establishments
were, in accordance with a recommendation of the Commissioners of
Inquiry into Colonial Expenditure in 1830, <a name=
"FNanchor_7_28" id="FNanchor_7_28"></a><a href="#fn7_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> abolished as a tax upon the industry and
capital of the colonists.</p>
<p>These changes applied both to New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, and similar instructions and regulations were sent out a
little later to the Governor of Western Australia. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_29" id="FNanchor_7_29"></a><a href="#fn7_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a> There, however, in the absence of convict
labour, settlers were to be allowed, in the purchase of land, £20
for every married labourer with his family, brought by them to
the colony. This concession was to take the place of the
provision which allowed such expense to be counted as part of the
capital in proportion to which grants were formerly made.
<a name="FNanchor_7_30" id="FNanchor_7_30"></a><a href="#fn7_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p>The despatch of the 9th January, 1831, strongly condemned the
regulations previously in force, and gave reasons for
substituting the new system. In the first place, these
regulations had not had the intended effect of preventing the
appropriation of large tracts of land by persons unable to
improve or to cultivate them. The conditions laid down as to
cultivation and quit-rents had failed. The cultivation conditions
had been very little attended to, and were unsatisfactory because
they were vague in extent and difficult to enforce. In practice
they were merely restrictive and useless. They placed the
government of the colony "in the disagreeable situation of either
suffering regulations they have sanctioned to become a dead
letter, or of interfering in a manner which must necessarily have
the appearance of being arbitrary and capricious, from the
impossibility of laying down any positive rule or defining
exactly the required degree of cultivation." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_31" id="FNanchor_7_31"></a><a href="#fn7_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a> The conditions as to quit-rents were no more
satisfactory. They were difficult and expensive to collect, and
were so small in amount that the revenue they brought in might
more easily be supplied from other sources. The great objection
to the whole "system" of grants at the discretion of the governor
was "the suspicion to which it unavoidably exposes the colonial
authorities of improper partiality to individuals." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_32" id="FNanchor_7_32"></a><a href="#fn7_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>In the next place, apart from their failure, the existing
regulations were not founded on correct views of the true
interest of the mother-country and the colony. They tended to
encourage capitalists rather than labourers, while it was the
emigration of unemployed labourers which would give the greatest
relief to the mother-country, and, at the same time, be most
useful to the colony, which was constantly complaining of the
difficulty of obtaining labour. Again, the high average price of
wheat which existed together with the want of demand for colonial
produce, led the Secretary of State to believe that the settlers
were too scattered and cultivation too widely extended. "These
two apparently inconsistent evils, of a high price and a want of
demand, lead me to believe that cultivation has been too widely
extended, and that it would have been more for the interests of
the colony if the settlers, instead of spreading themselves over
so great an extent of territory, had rather applied themselves to
the more effectual improvement and cultivation of a narrower
surface." <a name="FNanchor_7_33" id="FNanchor_7_33"></a><a href=
"#fn7_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The reason which he assigned
for this dispersion was that land could be too easily obtained.
"A different course, however, has been pursued, chiefly, as it
appears, owing to the extreme facility of acquiring land, by
which every man has been encouraged to become a proprietor,
producing what he can by his own unassisted efforts." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_34" id="FNanchor_7_34"></a><a href="#fn7_34" class=
"fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p>Having shown the failure of the existing regulations to
achieve the objects at which they aimed, the Secretary of State
proceeded to give his reason for introducing the new system. In
his opinion it was necessary to place some restriction on the
acquisition of land, and thereby to provide a supply of labour.
"If these views be correct, what is now required is to check this
extreme facility and to encourage the formation of a class of
labourers for hire, as the only means of creating a market for
the agricultural produce of the colony, of effecting various
improvements, and of prosecuting the many branches of industry
which are now neglected, while, at the same time, by enabling the
agriculturist to apply the great principle of the division of
labour, his produce will be increased and afforded at a more
reasonable rate." <a name="FNanchor_7_35" id=
"FNanchor_7_35"></a><a href="#fn7_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Two ways of bringing about this desired object suggested
themselves.</p>
<p>In the first place, the law might be altered to make
indentures more binding on the labourers, so that capitalists
might be induced to defray the expenses of their introduction
into the colony.</p>
<p>In the next place, land should be granted in no other way than
by sale for ready money at a fixed minimum price. "Another and
important advance towards a better system may, I think, be made
by a measure, simple and easy in itself, and which will at the
same time have much more effect in preventing the occupation of
land by persons unable or unwilling to improve it, than the
present complicated and, in practice, nugatory regulations. The
measure to which I allude, is that of declaring that in future no
land whatever shall be disposed of otherwise than by sale, a
minimum price (say, five shillings an acre) being fixed."
<a name="FNanchor_7_36" id="FNanchor_7_36"></a><a href="#fn7_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p>This despatch has been quoted at some length in order to give,
as far as possible in Lord Goderich's own words, the reason for
the new system of sale by auction. It would seem clear enough
that what was intended was to introduce in practice the principle
of restriction underlying the Wakefield system. It was not merely
that a price was charged for land a little higher than the usual
price, but it was imposed with the particular object of
preventing labourers from becoming landowners too soon. No doubt
the land regulations had been in a very unsatisfactory
state&mdash;Governor Darling had written once or twice to the
Colonial Office complaining of them. <a name="FNanchor_7_37" id=
"FNanchor_7_37"></a><a href="#fn7_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
It was obvious that some change was desirable. But the system
adopted was none the less the Wakefield system, though not
perhaps in the form which its author would have wished. A uniform
system of sale was established throughout Australia, and, so far
as the new policy was in accord with the chief principle of the
Wakefield theory, the systematic colonizers professed themselves
pleased. They never doubted but that it was the intention of the
Government to introduce some measure of the Wakefield system, and
they prided themselves on having wrought the change by their
representations. They singled out Lord Howick, then
Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, as being the real
author of the new regulations, <a name="FNanchor_7_38" id=
"FNanchor_7_38"></a><a href="#fn7_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and, indeed, claimed him as the first official convert to the new
theory. <a name="FNanchor_7_39" id="FNanchor_7_39"></a><a href=
"#fn7_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p>Some of the colonists, too, saw in the Ripon Regulations an
attempt to carry out the recommendations of the <i>Letter from
Sydney</i>, In 1831 a correspondent of the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>
wrote that "in this letter and its appendix, we find the germ of
these ruinous land regulations." <a name="FNanchor_7_40" id=
"FNanchor_7_40"></a><a href="#fn7_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Again, in 1832, the <i>Sydney Herald</i> wrote of "Robert
Gouger," that "his misstatements have already injured our colony
beyond calculation, and have imposed the sale and quit-rent of
land." <a name="FNanchor_7_41" id="FNanchor_7_41"></a><a href=
"#fn7_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But Wakefield's share in the
change has not gone unchallenged. Mr. J. D. Rogers says of
Wakefield: "He said that it was he who suggested to Lord Grey
(then Lord Howick), who suggested to Lord Ripon (then Lord
Goderich), who introduced the triple revolution of 1831. Even so
the fly said that it turned the wheel." <a name="FNanchor_7_42"
id="FNanchor_7_42"></a><a href="#fn7_42" class=
"fnanchor">[42]</a> In view of this statement, it is perhaps
necessary to bring some more evidence to show what Lord Goderich
and Lord Howick had in mind in introducing the new system. "One
of the chief objects in view," wrote Lord Goderich in his
despatch of the 14th February, 1831, accompanying the
regulations, <a name="FNanchor_7_43" id=
"FNanchor_7_43"></a><a href="#fn7_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
is "a great restriction of the extreme facility of acquiring land
which now exists. This is absolutely essential for the purpose of
checking the dispersion of Settlers." <a name="FNanchor_7_44" id=
"FNanchor_7_44"></a><a href="#fn7_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Again, in 1833, when the settlers of Swan River requested him, as
a means to the prosperity of their sorely-tried colony, to recall
the new regulations for selling land there, he defended the
system in words which Wakefield himself might have used to
describe the advantage of sale over all other methods of
disposing of waste lands. "All experience proves," he wrote,
"that the greatest drawback upon the progress and prosperity of
new colonies, arises from such a facility in obtaining land, as
tends to destroy all supply of labour for wages, and to convert
each settler into a small and impoverished landowner, without
means to do more than to extract from it a bare subsistence.
Others, however, of more ample means, will be induced, from that
very circumstance, to become settlers, from the greater
facilities of obtaining labour, and the wider field which would
thus be opened to them of laying out their capital with
advantage. It will have the further effect of introducing into
the colony a better order of society, and of regulating the
gradations of the different classes of it." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_45" id="FNanchor_7_45"></a><a href="#fn7_45" class=
"fnanchor">[45]</a> From Lord Howick's speeches in the House of
Commons it may be gathered that he was an early convert to the
Wakefield theory as he understood it. In 1831, in supporting the
abolition of free grants in Canada, he spoke of the incorrect
notions as to the best means of disposing of colonial waste lands
which had caused all the evils of the former system. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_46" id="FNanchor_7_46"></a><a href="#fn7_46" class=
"fnanchor">[46]</a> In 1839, again, he declared in no uncertain
tone that he accepted the principle of the Wakefield theory. "I
entirely agree with him <a name="FNanchor_7_47" id=
"FNanchor_7_47"></a><a href="#fn7_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
as to its soundness and extreme importance, and I think also with
him, that its discovery reflects great honour upon the gentleman
by whom it was brought to light, and who first pointed out its
influence upon the success of all schemes of colonization. As far
as I am aware, the benefits to be derived from the prevention of
an undue dispersion of settlers in a new territory, with the
means by which this object can best be accomplished, and the
necessity of combined labour, which in a new country, can only be
secured by artificially maintaining a proper proportion between
the numbers of the population and the extent of land which they
occupy, had entirely escaped the notice of all writers upon
political economy, until they were stated in those works of Mr.
Wakefield . . . . I consider these principles to be not less
important than they were novel at the time they were brought into
notice by Mr. Wakefield." <a name="FNanchor_7_48" id=
"FNanchor_7_48"></a><a href="#fn7_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
<p>Two years later Howick admitted that Wakefield originated the
policy on which the Ripon Regulations were based. Speaking on May
1st, 1841, at a farewell dinner to Wakefield on the eve of his
departure for Canada, he said: "It was true that when in office
in 1831 he had endeavoured to give application to the system
which Mr. Wakefield discovered." <a name="FNanchor_7_49" id=
"FNanchor_7_49"></a><a href="#fn7_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p>The Ripon Regulations, then, were an attempt to put into
practice the chief principle of the Wakefield theory. It was the
first attempt in the nineteenth century to proceed systematically
in disposing of the waste lands of the Crown in the colonies. It
was the first venture of the Colonial Office along the novel path
of theory, and, as might have been expected, it was a hesitating
one. Although it had been determined to put a price on land to
prevent labourers from becoming landowners too soon, <a name=
"FNanchor_7_50" id="FNanchor_7_50"></a><a href="#fn7_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> no pains were taken to make the price
"sufficient." Five shillings an acre was about the usual price of
land at the time, <a name="FNanchor_7_51" id=
"FNanchor_7_51"></a><a href="#fn7_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
or perhaps a little above the usual price. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_52" id="FNanchor_7_52"></a><a href="#fn7_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> But it was necessary to make a beginning
without causing too much opposition, and the price was purposely
fixed low. In 1831, Lord Howick told the House of Commons in
1843, "an opinion unfavourable to the new policy was universal
among persons interested in the colonies; their outcry was so
strong, that it was felt to be prudent to begin a little gently,
to get the scheme into operation with a price of 5s., and as soon
as they could do it with advantage, to raise the price." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_53" id="FNanchor_7_53"></a><a href="#fn7_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a> Howick, indeed, shared Wakefield's view that
the price should be progressively raised until it became
sufficient, and this he would have done had he remained in
office. <a name="FNanchor_7_54" id="FNanchor_7_54"></a><a href=
"#fn7_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p>It may be taken as a curious illustration of the way in which
the colonies were governed in 1831, that such a momentous change
in land policy which affected every colonist, "a perfect
revolution in the most important function of colonial
government," as Wakefield called it, <a name="FNanchor_7_55" id=
"FNanchor_7_55"></a><a href="#fn7_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
should have been directed merely by a despatch under the hand of
a Secretary of State, without any resort to Parliament for
confirmation or disavowal. By the mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of a
Secretary of State a colony might have its lands thrown open to
settlement, or locked up for years; the foundations of its
prosperity might be laid, or the seeds of its failure sown. The
regulations were certainly given the authority of an Order in
Council, but throughout the proceedings Parliament was never
consulted. It is true that at a later date when responsible
government was conceded to Canada in 1840, and to Australia in
1855, the all-important change was made in each case merely by a
despatch instructing the governor to choose his advisers with
reference to their support in the popular House; but in those
cases the policy had long been discussed, and had been several
times before Parliament.</p>
<p>There was little encouragement to existing or intending
settlers in the knowledge that at any time there might come
another arbitrary change in the land regulations to upset all
their calculations. The previous history of Australia had been
such that there was no guarantee that the new regulations might
not also, in their turn, be soon superseded.</p>
<p>The place which colonies then held in the minds of Englishmen
is strikingly shown by the fact that, although the Ripon
Regulations were published in full in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> of January 24th, 1831, they had not, by February
the 3rd, "been copied into any other journal, or even mentioned
by the Press." <a name="FNanchor_7_56" id=
"FNanchor_7_56"></a><a href="#fn7_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Indeed, they received only a passing reference in Parliament from
Lord Howick in 1831, and did not come up for consideration there
until February 22nd, 1832, when Mr. Dixon, complaining of the
"iniquitous proceedings" of the governor of New South Wales in
asking five shillings per acre for land and in claiming arrears
of quit-rents, recommended the Government to reconsider their
policy of selling waste lands. <a name="FNanchor_7_57" id=
"FNanchor_7_57"></a><a href="#fn7_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Lord Howick replied that the old system of granting lands had led
to great complaints, and orders had been accordingly sent out to
change the system. <a name="FNanchor_7_58" id=
"FNanchor_7_58"></a><a href="#fn7_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
On June 7th, 1832, Dixon returned to the attack and, supported by
Mr. Henry Lytton Bulwer, asked for a Select Committee to consider
the alienation of Crown lands in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land. Howick refused on the ground that it would mean a general
inquiry into the question of emigration and colonial land, and
would amount to considering whether the Government's policy were
wise or unwise. <a name="FNanchor_7_59" id=
"FNanchor_7_59"></a><a href="#fn7_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p>The systematic colonizers were by no means content with this,
their first success with the Colonial Office. While they were
ready to give all credit to Lord Howick for the advance, they
considered it an "awkward attempt," <a name="FNanchor_7_60" id=
"FNanchor_7_60"></a><a href="#fn7_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
which fell far short of a whole-hearted introduction of the
Wakefield system into Australia.</p>
<p>In the first place, they thought the price of five shillings
was not in any way a sufficient price. (Wakefield, it will be
remembered, had suggested two pounds per acre. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_61" id="FNanchor_7_61"></a><a href="#fn7_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a>) At such a price as five shillings there
would be really no restriction on the facility with which
labourers might become landowners, and it would therefore prevent
the existence in the colony of a class of labourers for hire.
<a name="FNanchor_7_62" id="FNanchor_7_62"></a><a href="#fn7_62"
class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Indeed, so defective in this respect
did the regulations appear to Wakefield, that he complained the
minimum price established was only such a "colourable adoption"
of his theory as to bring it into discredit. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_63" id="FNanchor_7_63"></a><a href="#fn7_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a> He suggested, too, before the 1836 Committee
on Waste Lands, <a name="FNanchor_7_64" id=
"FNanchor_7_64"></a><a href="#fn7_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
that the proper way of fixing the price instead of leaving it to
the governor's discretion, was to have a responsible body, like
the Poor Law Commissioners, whose function it should be to
regulate the price as circumstances might require, having regard
to the object with which it was imposed.</p>
<p>In the second place, the regulations were defective in that
they did not contain provisions compelling the expenditure of the
land fund on emigration. <a name="FNanchor_7_65" id=
"FNanchor_7_65"></a><a href="#fn7_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Although this part of the Wakefield theory was detachable from
the principle of a sufficient price, yet Wakefield and his
followers held that it was necessary to devote the whole of the
proceeds to emigration if the best and most rapid sort of
colonization was to take place. More especially was it necessary,
by increasing population in this way, to increase the proportion
of people to land when the price was so low as to be unable to
effect this by restriction.</p>
<p>In the next place, the systematic colonizers objected that the
new regulations were not established on any enduring basis. The
authority of a despatch or of an Order in Council was not a
sufficient guarantee that the new system would be permanent.
<a name="FNanchor_7_66" id="FNanchor_7_66"></a><a href="#fn7_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It left too much to the discretion of
the Colonial Office, and was far too dependent on the goodwill of
the Colonial Minister for the time being. Although they thought
the step did not go far enough, they did not want it retraced.
They wished to make the change permanent by an Act of Parliament,
which alone, in view of past history in Australia, could reassure
the colonists against the fear of frequent and unexpected change.
<a name="FNanchor_7_67" id="FNanchor_7_67"></a><a href="#fn7_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> They would have been best pleased with
an Act which laid down the principle that a sufficient price
should be imposed, and left it to a Commission to determine what
price was sufficient.</p>
<p>It was not until some time later that objection was taken by
Wakefield to the plan of auction as stultifying the principle of
sufficient price; <a name="FNanchor_7_68" id=
"FNanchor_7_68"></a><a href="#fn7_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
but the provision as to the size of the allotments in which waste
land was to be put up for auction&mdash;640 acres, unless special
reason was shown for a smaller amount&mdash;was condemned as
placing too great a check on the labourer's facility for becoming
a landowner, without preventing capitalists from taking up as
much land as they required. Robert Gouger urged on Lord Howick
the necessity for reducing the size of the lots so that a
labourer might be free to purchase when he wished, without
affecting the power of the capitalist to obtain large amounts by
buying several lots. <a name="FNanchor_7_69" id=
"FNanchor_7_69"></a><a href="#fn7_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Both this provision and that which gave the governor discretion
in withholding land from sale, sinned against the condition laid
down by Wakefield that settlers should have "perfect liberty of
appropriation." <a name="FNanchor_7_70" id=
"FNanchor_7_70"></a><a href="#fn7_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
"The governor's caprice," he wrote in 1833, "still determines
whereabouts land shall be surveyed and granted." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_71" id="FNanchor_7_71"></a><a href="#fn7_71" class=
"fnanchor">[71]</a> He called attention to the inconsistency of
having so low a price, as five shillings would not keep labourers
from becoming landowners too soon, and leaving a power in the
hands of the governor which practically amounted to allowing him
to make the price whatever he liked by withholding land and
thereby encouraging competition. <a name="FNanchor_7_72" id=
"FNanchor_7_72"></a><a href="#fn7_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
He would have preferred a much higher price and no discretionary
power in the hands of the governor to withhold land directly or
indirectly.</p>
<p>Then there was the further limitation on the settlement of
land in New South Wales preventing free appropriation, which had
its origin in the early circumstances of the colony. Land was
allowed to be bought only in certain settled districts, "within
the limits of location" established by a Government Order of the
14th October, 1829. These boundaries seem to have been fixed
originally so as to prevent the escape of convicts, and to lessen
the opportunities of conflict between colonists and aborigines,
<a name="FNanchor_7_73" id="FNanchor_7_73"></a><a href="#fn7_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and were a very real barrier to
settlement and to that freedom of appropriation which was
essential to the Wakefield system. In criticizing the Ripon
Regulations in a letter to Lord Howick, Robert Gouger suggested
that these boundaries should be gradually enlarged as the demand
for land grew. <a name="FNanchor_7_74" id=
"FNanchor_7_74"></a><a href="#fn7_74" class=
"fnanchor">[74]</a></p>
<p>Apart altogether from any other objections, the systematic
colonizers held that the Wakefield theory could not have a fair
trial in New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land, where there
existed a system of transportation, and where their main doctrine
of restriction was hampered in practice by the amount of land
which had already been granted to settlers.</p>
<p>Not less important to a young colony than a good system of
disposing of land, is immigration, which brings to the land the
necessary complement of labour and capital. During the years 1821
to 1830 inclusive, emigration from Great Britain to Australia was
not a steady stream, but a mere trickle. On an average only 880
free settlers arrived each year, and this includes those who went
to form the new settlement at Swan River. Not until 1828 did the
numbers amount to over one thousand in any one year. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_75" id="FNanchor_7_75"></a><a href="#fn7_75" class=
"fnanchor">[75]</a> During the corresponding period the average
annual number of convict emigrants to the penal colonies of New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land was 2,447. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_76" id="FNanchor_7_76"></a><a href="#fn7_76" class=
"fnanchor">[76]</a> But by 1830 these colonies had come to be
something more than mere overseas prisons. In 1828, when a census
was taken in New South Wales, the free settlers (including
emancipated convicts) numbered about 21,000, while the convicts
numbered about 16,000. <a name="FNanchor_7_77" id=
"FNanchor_7_77"></a><a href="#fn7_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The time had gone by when Governor Macquarie could preach and
practise the doctrine that a penal colony existed primarily for
convicts and ex-convicts. But, at the rate at which convicts were
pouring in, something more than the trivial stream of free
emigrants was required if the free population was definitely to
predominate in these colonies. The Home Government showed no sign
of checking the supply of convicts, much less of abandoning the
system of transportation. Indeed from 1826 to 1830 the number of
convict emigrants gradually increased.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been thought of the accuracy of the
<i>Letter from Sydney</i> as a general description of conditions
in Australia in 1829, it was not disputed that Wakefield was
right in pointing out how scarce labour was, and how
unsatisfactory were both indentured and convict labour.
Throughout the decade beginning with 1830 complaints were common
in all the Australian colonies of the scarcity of labour.
<a name="FNanchor_7_78" id="FNanchor_7_78"></a><a href="#fn7_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Indeed so great was the demand for
labour that, in 1837, the Legislative Council of New South Wales
entertained the proposal to introduce into the colony natives of
India bound by indenture to work for a given period. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_79" id="FNanchor_7_79"></a><a href="#fn7_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p>In all the Australian colonies the system of indentured labour
had failed. Its non-success had been one of the causes of the
disaster at the Swan River. <a name="FNanchor_7_80" id=
"FNanchor_7_80"></a><a href="#fn7_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
In New South Wales Mr. James Macarthur, <a name="FNanchor_7_81"
id="FNanchor_7_81"></a><a href="#fn7_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a> a wealthy landowner, is reported to have
said, "there is no instance on record in the history of the
colony, where settlers have been able to prevent their indented
servants, hired in England, from turning dissatisfied, and then
leaving them after their arrival." <a name="FNanchor_7_82" id=
"FNanchor_7_82"></a><a href="#fn7_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The system gave endless inconvenience to the masters, and it was
notoriously the case that indentured servants either left their
masters or made so much trouble that their masters were forced to
release them from service. <a name="FNanchor_7_83" id=
"FNanchor_7_83"></a><a href="#fn7_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Nor did the system work better in Van Diemen's Land. There it was
discredited and unpopular because of the uniform misconduct of
the servants. <a name="FNanchor_7_84" id=
"FNanchor_7_84"></a><a href="#fn7_84" class=
"fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
<p>Convict labour was still more unsatisfactory. In the first
place, the supply was limited. There were not enough assigned
convicts to meet the needs of the settlers, and applications to
the Government for this kind of labour often had to be refused or
only partially accepted. Again, its assistance was uncertain
because it was granted at the sole discretion of the governor and
might be arbitrarily withheld or withdrawn. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_85" id="FNanchor_7_85"></a><a href="#fn7_85" class=
"fnanchor">[85]</a> Then, too, convict labour was extremely
inefficient. Governor Arthur calculated that three out of every
ten assigned convicts were a totally useless burden to their
masters. <a name="FNanchor_7_86" id="FNanchor_7_86"></a><a href=
"#fn7_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The utility of a supply of
forced labour, which is always economically inferior to free
labour, was often lessened by the practical difficulty of
compelling the convict to work. The master had to waste a
considerable amount of time and money in enforcing obedience by
bringing the convict before a magistrate for punishment. Indeed
he often had to overlook peculation and other misconduct because
of the waste of time and money in bringing his convicts to
punishment, and because punishment often meant that he lost the
convict's services for a shorter or longer period. In Van
Diemen's Land, where convicts were under stricter discipline than
in New South Wales, <a name="FNanchor_7_87" id=
"FNanchor_7_87"></a><a href="#fn7_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
the "peculation, insubordination, insolence, disobedience and
drunkenness" of assigned convicts necessitated constant reference
to the magistrates. <a name="FNanchor_7_88" id=
"FNanchor_7_88"></a><a href="#fn7_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Indeed in Governor Arthur's words it was impossible, without
experience of the system of assignment, "to have an idea of the
vexations which accompany the employment of convicts, or of the
vicissitudes attendant upon their assignment. Their crimes and
misconduct involve the settlers in daily trouble, expense and
disappointment." <a name="FNanchor_7_89" id=
"FNanchor_7_89"></a><a href="#fn7_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
<p>One particular drawback under which these colonies suffered,
and which concerned both emigration and the scarcity of labour,
was the extreme disproportion between the sexes. In New South
Wales, in 1828, there were 28,000 males and only 9,000 females.
In Van Diemen's Land at the same time there were 13,000 males and
only about 4,000 females. <a name="FNanchor_7_90" id=
"FNanchor_7_90"></a><a href="#fn7_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Not only did this mean a great scarcity of women's labour, but it
had a very bad effect upon morals in these colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_91" id="FNanchor_7_91"></a><a href="#fn7_91" class=
"fnanchor">[91]</a> Nothing Wakefield had said upon this subject
was too strong. If these colonies were to be successful and
prosperous in any true sense they needed a moral regeneration,
both by counteracting the influence of transportation and by
altering the proportion between the sexes, for which indeed the
system of transportation was largely responsible. A supply of
immigrants, then, selected on a system adapted to their needs,
was the most urgent need of the penal colonies of Australia in
1830. Bad, indeed, as was convict labour, the colonists clung to
it as their only support. Labour of some description they needed,
and free labour did not exist in any quantity. The reputation of
the penal colonies was so unattractive to the ordinary emigrant
that, as the returns showed, there was at that time no voluntary
emigration of labouring people to Australia. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_92" id="FNanchor_7_92"></a><a href="#fn7_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a> Again, although wages there were high as
compared with those at home, yet the cost of passage&mdash;about
£30 or £40 at this time, <a name="FNanchor_7_93" id=
"FNanchor_7_93"></a><a href="#fn7_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
made it practically impossible for the ordinary labourer to avail
himself of the opportunities afforded him. Shipowners trading to
Australia made no provision for the accommodation of the poorer
class of emigrants. <a name="FNanchor_7_94" id=
"FNanchor_7_94"></a><a href="#fn7_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Canada, and particularly the United States, made an equal demand
for labour and were much easier to reach. What the Australian
colonies needed was some means of overcoming the handicap of
distance, and this they found in Wakefield's "golden bridge" of
an emigration fund produced as the result of land sales.</p>
<p>The Home Government had turned its attention towards
emigration in 1831, when Lord Howick had introduced his
unsuccessful Bill for pauper emigration on the lines of Wilmot
Horton. <a name="FNanchor_7_95" id="FNanchor_7_95"></a><a href=
"#fn7_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The Report, in 1827, of the
Select Committee on Emigration had recommended the formation of a
Board of Emigration "under the direct control of an executive
department of the State." <a name="FNanchor_7_96" id=
"FNanchor_7_96"></a><a href="#fn7_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Urged on by the Colonization Society and by the failure of
Howick's Bill, the Government recurred to this recommendation
and, on the 24th June, 1831, appointed an Emigration Commission
consisting of the Duke of Richmond, Lord Howick, Mr. R. W. Hay,
Mr. Francis Baring, and Mr. Henry Ellis, with Mr. T. F. Elliot of
the Colonial Office as secretary. <a name="FNanchor_7_97" id=
"FNanchor_7_97"></a><a href="#fn7_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
According to Lord Goderich's instructions they were to be a
temporary commission in place of that proposed under the Bill of
1831; but their functions were to be limited to collecting and
diffusing such information regarding the colonies as might be
useful to intending emigrants&mdash;for example, rates of wages,
expense of passage, which colonies had most need of emigration,
and what classes of emigrants were particularly required. No
funds were allowed them from the Treasury to aid and conduct
emigration, but, if any parishes chose to provide them with
money, they might use it in the emigration of paupers. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_98" id="FNanchor_7_98"></a><a href="#fn7_98" class=
"fnanchor">[98]</a> The Commissioners immediately set to work and
published in a form convenient to emigrants such information as
they could collect from the various colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_99" id="FNanchor_7_99"></a><a href="#fn7_99" class=
"fnanchor">[99]</a> The Emigration Committee of 1827 had
recommended a loan for emigration to be repaid by the emigrant
settler, and many would-be colonists thought that the
Commissioners had some such fund at their disposal. So
widespread, indeed, was this impression that, shortly after their
appointment, the Commissioners found it necessary to inform the
public that they could give no pecuniary aid to emigration;
<a name="FNanchor_7_100" id="FNanchor_7_100"></a><a href=
"#fn7_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and, in regard to the
British North American colonies, this attitude was strictly
maintained. <a name="FNanchor_7_101" id=
"FNanchor_7_101"></a><a href="#fn7_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> The comparative closeness of these colonies
to Britain rendered it unnecessary to provide funds for
emigration there. Then, too, Horton's experiments had shown how
easy it was to spend money on emigration to Canada without
getting any return. Some of Horton's settlers had gone to the
United States, and it was not to be expected that the Government
would provide passages for emigrants who wished to reach the
United States by way of Canada. But with regard to Australia the
case was very different. There distance was an insuperable bar to
the unassisted emigrant. In 1831 the Commissioners reported that
there was no lack of a disposition to emigrate to New South
Wales, and Van Diemen's Land, but that it was impossible for
labourers to pay their passage there without some addition to
their resources. <a name="FNanchor_7_102" id=
"FNanchor_7_102"></a><a href="#fn7_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a> They, therefore, recommended that the
Government should advance part of the passage money by way of
loan to mechanics emigrating there. <a name="FNanchor_7_103" id=
"FNanchor_7_103"></a><a href="#fn7_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a> In order to have a safeguard in case the
advances were not repaid, they proposed a tax of £1 per head upon
convicts assigned in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.
<a name="FNanchor_7_104" id="FNanchor_7_104"></a><a href=
"#fn7_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> This tax had been suggested
previously by Lord Goderich to Governor Darling of New South
Wales in considering the means of raising funds for emigration.
<a name="FNanchor_7_105" id="FNanchor_7_105"></a><a href=
"#fn7_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> At the same time he had
considered the question of raising money for this purpose by land
sales. He doubted whether this would be feasible and he regarded
it rather as a source for maintaining free labourers until they
could find employment in the colony, than as a means of financing
emigration. <a name="FNanchor_7_106" id=
"FNanchor_7_106"></a><a href="#fn7_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a> Both these expedients Goderich now
determined to adopt. He proposed that part of the land revenue of
New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land should be spent in
assisting female emigrants there in order to cure the evils
arising from the great disproportion between the sexes. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_107" id="FNanchor_7_107"></a><a href="#fn7_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a> With the consent of the Lord
Commissioners of the Treasury, £10,000 was in 1831 appropriated
from the land revenue of these colonies for this purpose,
<a name="FNanchor_7_108" id="FNanchor_7_108"></a><a href=
"#fn7_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and regulations were drawn
up by the Emigration Commissioners under which £8, about half the
passage money, was to be contributed by the Government to
unmarried females between 15 and 30 who emigrated there. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_109" id="FNanchor_7_109"></a><a href="#fn7_109"
class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>
<p>About the same time the Commissioners obtained the consent of
the Treasury to their proposal to make loans to emigrant
mechanics. Under the regulations drawn up for this purpose, the
Government was to contribute £10 by way of loan to assist any
married mechanic to emigrate to Australia with his family.
<a name="FNanchor_7_110" id="FNanchor_7_110"></a><a href=
"#fn7_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The Governors of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land were, as the Commissioners had
suggested, to impose a tax on assigned convicts, but, at the same
time, the repayment of the loans was to be enforced as strictly
as possible. At first the advance applied only to mechanics, but
afterwards it was extended to agricultural labourers.</p>
<p>The immediate practical effect of the activity of the
Emigration Commissioners was that, soon after they had diffused
information and made preparations to send out emigrants,
shipowners began to provide accommodation for labouring people,
and the cost of a passage to Australia fell from £30-£40 to
£18-£20. <a name="FNanchor_7_111" id=
"FNanchor_7_111"></a><a href="#fn7_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a></p>
<p>When the Emigration Commission had been in existence little
more than a year, it was dissolved, <a name="FNanchor_7_112" id=
"FNanchor_7_112"></a><a href="#fn7_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a> and the practical working of its
recommendations was left to the Colonial Office. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_113" id="FNanchor_7_113"></a><a href="#fn7_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>
<p>The Home Government was not at first disposed to pay the whole
of the passages of emigrants. The Commissioners considered that
to do so would destroy the labourer's habit of reliance on his
own exertions. <a name="FNanchor_7_114" id=
"FNanchor_7_114"></a><a href="#fn7_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a> But circumstances compelled the Government
to abandon this position. The attempt to base a system of
emigration upon the repayment of advances by the emigrant failed
conclusively. The proposed tax upon convict labour was very
unpopular in the penal colonies on account of the increased
disadvantage which it would attach to the employment of convicts,
<a name="FNanchor_7_115" id="FNanchor_7_115"></a><a href=
"#fn7_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and it was not imposed.
<a name="FNanchor_7_116" id="FNanchor_7_116"></a><a href=
"#fn7_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> As a general rule neither
in New South Wales nor in Van Diemen's Land was the Government
able to recover from assisted emigrants that portion of their
passage money which had been advanced to them. The Governors of
both colonies reported that the amounts would be difficult to
collect, that it was practically impossible to get repayment, and
that there was no expectation of providing any considerable sum
to the Emigration Fund by this means. <a name="FNanchor_7_117"
id="FNanchor_7_117"></a><a href="#fn7_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a> It says very little for the character of
those who emigrated at this time that they were not unable but
unwilling to repay. In Van Diemen's Land they were reported to be
too improvident and too little disposed to remember their debt.
<a name="FNanchor_7_118" id="FNanchor_7_118"></a><a href=
"#fn7_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In New South Wales, up to
the end of June, 1834, out of 337 only 21 had paid an instalment
of £2 10s. 0d. on their advance, and the Governor doubted whether
any more would ever be recovered. <a name="FNanchor_7_119" id=
"FNanchor_7_119"></a><a href="#fn7_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> Generally speaking, once they reached
Australia, assisted emigrants repudiated obligations which
perhaps they had never intended to fulfil.</p>
<p>Indeed it was as difficult to obtain the return of loans from
these emigrants who were free to dispose of their labour where
they pleased, as it was to compel indentured servants to fulfil
their contracts of labour in the colonies. The Home Government
might have taken warning, too, by what had happened in the case
of quit-rents. With a population scattered over a wide extent of
country and with no elaborate social machinery, it was difficult
for the Colonial Government to keep track of the emigrant, much
less to extract money from him. Moreover the Government was
unwilling to take harsh measures against these defaulters by a
forcible levying on their property because it would only penalize
the thrifty and industrious, and allow the idlers to escape;
<a name="FNanchor_7_120" id="FNanchor_7_120"></a><a href=
"#fn7_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the other alternative of
imprisoning debtors would not recover the loans, <a name=
"FNanchor_7_121" id="FNanchor_7_121"></a><a href="#fn7_121"
class="fnanchor">[121]</a> nor make emigration popular. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_122" id="FNanchor_7_122"></a><a href="#fn7_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
<p>In practice, too, it was not easy to find single women, or
married mechanics, or married agricultural labourers, willing to
emigrate, and yet possessing enough to pay even the difference
between the amount advanced by the Government and the amount
charged for the passage to the colony.</p>
<p>Step by step then the Home Government was forced, first to
increase the amount of that portion of the passage money which
was a gift to the emigrant, and finally to pay the whole of the
fare. Soon after a commencement had been made with female
emigration, of a fare of £17 the share paid by the Government was
increased to £12, £6 of which was paid on departure of the
emigrant and £6 on her arrival in the colony. In 1834, a change
was made whereby the Government paid the whole of the £17 and
required the emigrant to repay £6. <a name="FNanchor_7_123" id=
"FNanchor_7_123"></a><a href="#fn7_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a> Finally, in 1835, the whole of the passage
became a free gift to the emigrant. <a name="FNanchor_7_124" id=
"FNanchor_7_124"></a><a href="#fn7_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a> Similarly in regard to emigrant mechanics
and agricultural labourers the amount advanced to them was
considerably increased in 1836, <a name="FNanchor_7_125" id=
"FNanchor_7_125"></a><a href="#fn7_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a> and, in 1837, the system became one of free
passages for all emigrants selected by the Government. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_126" id="FNanchor_7_126"></a><a href="#fn7_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In both cases, too, the Home
Government, despairing of repayment of the advances, instructed
the Governors of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land in 1835 to
remit these debts and to treat the loans as free gifts. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_127" id="FNanchor_7_127"></a><a href="#fn7_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p>In the selection of emigrants to New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land the Home Government was conspicuously unsuccessful.
When their scheme of emigration was first proposed, Wilmot
Horton's plans for pauper location and Howick's Pauper Emigration
Bill were very recent, and the colonists were afraid that it
meant pauper emigration. In 1831 the Emigration Committee of Van
Diemen's Land protested against pauper immigration on the ground
that the parishes would probably send out only habitual paupers.
<a name="FNanchor_7_128" id="FNanchor_7_128"></a><a href=
"#fn7_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> These fears were, however,
allayed and in the next year they reported their satisfaction
that no paupers were coming. <a name="FNanchor_7_129" id=
"FNanchor_7_129"></a><a href="#fn7_129" class=
"fnanchor">[129]</a> Even as late as 1837, T. F. Elliot, who had
by then become the Agent-General for Emigration, found in these
colonies a "sensitive apprehension" of an influx of paupers.
<a name="FNanchor_7_130" id="FNanchor_7_130"></a><a href=
"#fn7_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But, on the whole, the
emigration to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land during this
period was not pauper emigration. In some cases indeed paupers
were sent, for example, 76 in one ship to Van Diemen's Land in
1834 by the Bristol Guardians of the Poor. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_131" id="FNanchor_7_131"></a><a href="#fn7_131"
class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Governor Arthur strongly objected to
these emigrants on the ground that they were not qualified to
become useful colonists. <a name="FNanchor_7_132" id=
"FNanchor_7_132"></a><a href="#fn7_132" class=
"fnanchor">[132]</a> Again, in 1837, some of the "selected"
emigrants to Van Diemen's Land were habitual paupers. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_133" id="FNanchor_7_133"></a><a href="#fn7_133"
class="fnanchor">[133]</a> These cases were, however, the
exception and not the rule. While it was necessary for an
emigrant to pay part of his fare, a pauper could not emigrate
without assistance, nor was a parish likely to pay the expenses
of a passage to Australia when Canada and the United States were
so near at hand. The mechanics and agricultural labourers were
usually desirable immigrants although there were several
exceptions. Both colonies were always willing to take a good
class of these labourers, but were not at all anxious for
indiscriminate immigration. <a name="FNanchor_7_134" id=
"FNanchor_7_134"></a><a href="#fn7_134" class=
"fnanchor">[134]</a> In 1833, the Home Government admitted that,
in the management of emigration, considerable latitude had been
given to shipowners, and that the emigrants sent out were not
always of the class required in the colonies. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_135" id="FNanchor_7_135"></a><a href="#fn7_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Indeed the business of selecting
emigrants and managing emigration was very inadequately carried
on by the authorities at home. Its worst side is illustrated by a
report of a surgeon in charge of an emigrant ship to Van Diemen's
Land in 1837. He complained that of those under his charge there
had been no selection but "a general invitation and
indiscriminate admission." <a name="FNanchor_7_136" id=
"FNanchor_7_136"></a><a href="#fn7_136" class=
"fnanchor">[136]</a> The result was that "the idle, the
troublesome, the dissipated and the infirm, are mustered from all
quarters by parochial authorities, happy to be rid of such
characters on any terms." <a name="FNanchor_7_137" id=
"FNanchor_7_137"></a><a href="#fn7_137" class=
"fnanchor">[137]</a> Many of them boasted that they had never
known independence of parochial relief, and that they were bribed
by the parishes to avail themselves of the opportunity to
emigrate. He concluded that "by far the greater number were of a
description to contribute nothing to the welfare or prosperity of
a new colony&mdash;a class of people not desired in any
community, where habits of industry, moral steadiness, or any
useful qualifications are deemed recommendable." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_138" id="FNanchor_7_138"></a><a href="#fn7_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
<p>Even worse was the management of female emigration. As soon as
he received news of the Home Government's proposal to send out
female emigrants. Governor Arthur, who had had experience of
female convict emigration, while he welcomed the step for its
beneficial results to the colony, warned the Home authorities
that great care should be taken in the management of the women,
especially during the voyage, "experience having proved to me
during my residence in this colony, that the greatest possible
consequence attaches to the treatment which females of the lower
class meet with on the voyage, and too great precaution cannot
possibly be used to prevent their demoralization." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_139" id="FNanchor_7_139"></a><a href="#fn7_139"
class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Even if this warning had arrived in
time it is doubtful whether effect would have been given to it in
the first two ships which sailed to Australia with female
emigrants in 1832. The Colonial Office thought it was beyond the
competence of an ordinary department of Government to superintend
the selection of the emigrants. <a name="FNanchor_7_140" id=
"FNanchor_7_140"></a><a href="#fn7_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a> They therefore contented themselves with
providing passages in the ships, and confided the work of
selection to charitable institutions. Finding that they could not
get a sufficient number of women capable of paying the difference
between the sum advanced by way of loan and the passage money,
the Government made a free gift of the passages to all selected
female emigrants. <a name="FNanchor_7_141" id=
"FNanchor_7_141"></a><a href="#fn7_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> The disorder which they feared might occur
from the method of selection they considered a less evil "than
the certain mischief of leaving the disproportion between the
sexes in those colonies without an attempt at its correction."
<a name="FNanchor_7_142" id="FNanchor_7_142"></a><a href=
"#fn7_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The ships, <i>Red Rover</i>
and <i>Princess Royal</i>, were accordingly fitted out to take
emigrants, the first to New South Wales, the second to Van
Diemen's Land. The Magdalen Female Penitentiary, with the
assistance of various Guardian Societies, was allowed to provide
the passengers for the <i>Princess Royal</i>. This arrangement,
however, fell through, and after the parish workhouses had
contributed their quota, the number was completed from casual
applicants. "Of the 200 females sent out by the <i>Princess
Royal</i>, 84 were taken from the two charitable societies, 22
from the parish workhouses and schools, and the remainder from
the casual applicants." <a name="FNanchor_7_143" id=
"FNanchor_7_143"></a><a href="#fn7_143" class=
"fnanchor">[143]</a> Those who sailed on board the <i>Red
Rover</i> to New South Wales were somewhat better selected and
were absorbed by the colony without much trouble. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_144" id="FNanchor_7_144"></a><a href="#fn7_144"
class="fnanchor">[144]</a> But the colonists of Van Diemen's Land
were rightly very dissatisfied with the emigrants by the
<i>Princess Royal</i>. As might have been expected from the
injudicious method of selection they were a very mixed assembly.
At least one-half of them were prostitutes. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_145" id="FNanchor_7_145"></a><a href="#fn7_145"
class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Those who were selected from
reformatories showed no signs of reform. "There can be no doubt,"
wrote Governor Arthur, "that in selecting the females from the
penitentiary, and other public institutions, the Committee in
England were actuated by the very best motives, but they have,
indeed, sadly erred in the estimate they have formed of the
reformation of the women taken from those establishments&mdash;it
would almost seem, whilst it has been their object to remove the
best characters from those institutions, that the persons in the
immediate charge of them, must have availed themselves of the
opportunity of getting rid of some of the very worst." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_146" id="FNanchor_7_146"></a><a href="#fn7_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Several of the women were furnished
with written characters to which they did not in the least
correspond. <a name="FNanchor_7_147" id=
"FNanchor_7_147"></a><a href="#fn7_147" class=
"fnanchor">[147]</a> Arrangements on board ship were very bad and
the conduct of some of the emigrants during the voyage was
"licentious and immoral." <a name="FNanchor_7_148" id=
"FNanchor_7_148"></a><a href="#fn7_148" class=
"fnanchor">[148]</a> Governor Arthur wrote that the scene on
board was "too gross to repeat." <a name="FNanchor_7_149" id=
"FNanchor_7_149"></a><a href="#fn7_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a> Indeed some of the emigrants were reported
to be "far more depraved than the generality of convict women."
<a name="FNanchor_7_150" id="FNanchor_7_150"></a><a href=
"#fn7_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Naturally the better class
of emigrants on the ship complained bitterly that they had been
deceived by misrepresentations in England as to their companions
on the voyage. <a name="FNanchor_7_151" id=
"FNanchor_7_151"></a><a href="#fn7_151" class=
"fnanchor">[151]</a></p>
<p>After the failure of this enterprise the Colonial Office
entrusted the business of selecting female emigrants and the
management of emigrant ships to a charitable committee, later
called the London Emigration Committee, who voluntarily gave
their services and acted under regulations sanctioned by the
Government. <a name="FNanchor_7_152" id=
"FNanchor_7_152"></a><a href="#fn7_152" class=
"fnanchor">[152]</a> The members of this Committee were
originally selected from amongst the Committee of the Refuge for
the Destitute, and later added three or four others to their
numbers. <a name="FNanchor_7_153" id=
"FNanchor_7_153"></a><a href="#fn7_153" class=
"fnanchor">[153]</a> They were presided over by Mr. Edward
Forster, and the business of supplying ships and managing general
shipping arrangements was carried on by their agent, Mr. John
Marshall. <a name="FNanchor_7_154" id=
"FNanchor_7_154"></a><a href="#fn7_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
<p>In spite of this change in management, the character of female
emigration to Australia did not immediately show much
improvement. The first ship which the Committee sent to New South
Wales in 1833, the <i>Bussorah Merchant</i>, contained a small
proportion of prostitutes who resumed their former mode of life,
but the rest of the emigrants were quite satisfactory. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_155" id="FNanchor_7_155"></a><a href="#fn7_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In the same year, however, although in
despatching the Lay ton to New South Wales, they took pains "to
ascertain the character of all the persons who went by this ship
"and confidently hoped they would prove a very valuable
acquisition to the colony, <a name="FNanchor_7_156" id=
"FNanchor_7_156"></a><a href="#fn7_156" class=
"fnanchor">[156]</a> the character and conduct of the emigrants
were so bad as to throw great doubt upon the efficacy of the
Committee's methods of selection. Only 50 of the 232 women were
of the description required by the colonists. The rest were so
indifferent in character and contained so few who were likely to
add to the decency and respectability of the colony, that it was
found impossible to form a Ladies' Committee at Sydney to assist
in their disposal. <a name="FNanchor_7_157" id=
"FNanchor_7_157"></a><a href="#fn7_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a> Again the arrangements on board ship were
very bad. The greatest disorder and confusion prevailed during
the whole voyage and unlimited intercourse existed between the
seamen and a great number of the female passengers. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_158" id="FNanchor_7_158"></a><a href="#fn7_158"
class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Again the better part of the emigrants
with reason complained of their associates. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_159" id="FNanchor_7_159"></a><a href="#fn7_159"
class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>
<p>The first ship <a name="FNanchor_7_160" id=
"FNanchor_7_160"></a><a href="#fn7_160" class=
"fnanchor">[160]</a> sent out by the Committee to arrive in New
South Wales in 1835, contained a better selection&mdash;only
one-sixth of the number were prostitutes. This ship, too,
"presented a great scene of disorder and immorality during the
whole of the voyage." <a name="FNanchor_7_161" id=
"FNanchor_7_161"></a><a href="#fn7_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a> Another ship of that year, the
<i>Canton</i>, had a "black list" of about thirty only. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_162" id="FNanchor_7_162"></a><a href="#fn7_162"
class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The third ship to arrive in 1835 and
those in 1836 gave no cause for complaint on the score of the
character of the emigrants, but some of these ships had sickness
on board. <a name="FNanchor_7_163" id=
"FNanchor_7_163"></a><a href="#fn7_163" class=
"fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
<p>The emigrant ships which followed the <i>Princess Royal</i> to
Van Diemen's Land in the years 1834 and 1835, contained women of
a decidedly superior type to the passengers by that vessel, and
their conduct on board was better, though there were still a few
undesirables of whom the better class complained. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_164" id="FNanchor_7_164"></a><a href="#fn7_164"
class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But, in 1836, the <i>Boadicea</i>
arrived and gave new cause for complaint as to the selection of
emigrants. Out of the 216 persons she carried, 46 were girls
under the age of 15 (some were aged 11-13), and a great number of
these were suffering from chronic ophthalmia. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_165" id="FNanchor_7_165"></a><a href="#fn7_165"
class="fnanchor">[165]</a> No complaint was made of the conduct
of these children, but it was cruel and inexpedient to send out
to a penal colony where the sexes were disproportionate, a number
of young girls unable to protect themselves. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_166" id="FNanchor_7_166"></a><a href="#fn7_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a> More young children were brought by
another ship in the same year. <a name="FNanchor_7_167" id=
"FNanchor_7_167"></a><a href="#fn7_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a> In each case these children could not safely
be sent to service, and they were temporarily provided for by the
Ladies' Committee.</p>
<p>Enough detail has been given to show that the system of
selection adopted by the Emigration Committee was, judged by its
results, exceedingly defective. <a name="FNanchor_7_168" id=
"FNanchor_7_168"></a><a href="#fn7_168" class=
"fnanchor">[168]</a> The Committee took the precaution to require
from intending emigrants a certificate of character signed by a
reputable person, but in many cases they were deceived. They also
had a system of personal inspection of applicants, but this was
hardly more successful, although no reasonable method of
selection would have availed to exclude all undesirables.</p>
<p>Again, the arrangements on board the emigrant ships were often
faulty. Much depended on the officers in charge of the emigrants,
especially on the master, the surgeon, and the superintendent,
the latter two of whom were chosen by the Committee. Where the
superintendent was wisely chosen there was little complaint as to
the conduct on board ship. <a name="FNanchor_7_169" id=
"FNanchor_7_169"></a><a href="#fn7_169" class=
"fnanchor">[169]</a> But the choice was not always wise, <a name=
"FNanchor_7_170" id="FNanchor_7_170"></a><a href="#fn7_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> nor was the conduct of masters and
surgeons always good. <a name="FNanchor_7_171" id=
"FNanchor_7_171"></a><a href="#fn7_171" class=
"fnanchor">[171]</a></p>
<p>In the Australian colonies there was inevitably a good deal of
dissatisfaction with this kind of emigration. The reputation of
the better class of emigrants was likely to be gauged by the
character of the worst, and this adversely affected the
popularity of emigration. In 1834 it was asserted that the first
few shiploads of female emigrants to Australia were a byword
there and that it was common to refer to them as "Laytonians,"
"Bussorah Merchants," "Princess Royals," and "Red Rovers," to
avoid using a harsher name. <a name="FNanchor_7_172" id=
"FNanchor_7_172"></a><a href="#fn7_172" class=
"fnanchor">[172]</a> The Australian colonies badly needed female
emigrants, but not of the type these represented. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_173" id="FNanchor_7_173"></a><a href="#fn7_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In 1834 the Governor of Van Diemen's
Land reported that emigration was not required there except of a
few mechanics, but that there was still plenty of room for "the
most valuable of all importations," women of good character.
<a name="FNanchor_7_174" id="FNanchor_7_174"></a><a href=
"#fn7_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The colonies complained of
the method of selection, of the general arrangements for
emigration, and of the management of emigrants during the voyage.
On the other hand complaints were not wanting as to the reception
of the emigrants and their treatment in the colonies before they
obtained positions. <a name="FNanchor_7_175" id=
"FNanchor_7_175"></a><a href="#fn7_175" class=
"fnanchor">[175]</a> The Home Government was urged to insist upon
more care in the management of emigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_176" id="FNanchor_7_176"></a><a href="#fn7_176"
class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Governor Bourke in 1834 had suggested
the appointment of some responsible person to superintend the
selection of emigrants. <a name="FNanchor_7_177" id=
"FNanchor_7_177"></a><a href="#fn7_177" class=
"fnanchor">[177]</a> Accordingly, in 1835, Mr. J. D. Pinnock, who
had been for some time attached to the emigration business of the
Colonial Office, was appointed to the position of Emigration
Agent. <a name="FNanchor_7_178" id="FNanchor_7_178"></a><a href=
"#fn7_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> But the colonists, finding
that the causes of their dissatisfaction were not removed,
determined to assume more control over emigration. They were
jealous, too, of the fact that funds raised in the colony should
be used for such important purposes by persons unconnected with
the colonies; and, in New South Wales in 1835, they suggested
that emigration should in Britain be managed by those who had a
personal interest in the colony. <a name="FNanchor_7_179" id=
"FNanchor_7_179"></a><a href="#fn7_179" class=
"fnanchor">[179]</a> This suggestion was endorsed by Bourke and
approved by the Home Government. Accordingly naval surgeons, who
had been superintendents of convict ships and therefore were
familiar both with the needs of the colonies and the management
of emigrants during a long voyage, were appointed by the colonial
government to proceed to Great Britain to manage emigration.
There each surgeon was to select and bring out under his personal
supervision a shipload of emigrants. <a name="FNanchor_7_180" id=
"FNanchor_7_180"></a><a href="#fn7_180" class=
"fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, where the land revenue was much smaller,
and the demand for labour much less, it was not found necessary
to adopt similar measures. <a name="FNanchor_7_181" id=
"FNanchor_7_181"></a><a href="#fn7_181" class=
"fnanchor">[181]</a></p>
<p>About the same time, too, in New South Wales, an entirely
different method of assisting emigration was introduced by the
Governor, on the recommendation of the Legislative Council, by a
proclamation of the 28th October, 1835. Any private settler who,
before the end of 1837, introduced into the colony married
mechanics or farm servants under 30 years of age, was to receive
a bounty of £30 for each married couple, with an additional £5
for each child over 12 months. £15 per head was allowed for the
introduction of unmarried females between 15 and 30 travelling
under the protection of the married couples, and £10 for each
unmarried male, provided that at the same time an equal number of
females was brought. <a name="FNanchor_7_182" id=
"FNanchor_7_182"></a><a href="#fn7_182" class=
"fnanchor">[182]</a> These amounts were reckoned as about equal
to the cost of the passage of the various classes of emigrants,
and the Governor considered bounty emigration to be the "cheapest
and most desirable mode of encouraging the emigration of useful
persons," because the government would incur no expense in
selecting the emigrants and in maintaining them until they could
be embarked. <a name="FNanchor_7_183" id=
"FNanchor_7_183"></a><a href="#fn7_183" class=
"fnanchor">[183]</a> The approval of the Home Government was
obtained, and the proportion of the land revenue of the colony
which was available for emigration was divided between the two
schemes, two-thirds being reserved for the use of the Home
Government in assisting emigration, and one-third for the payment
of bounties. <a name="FNanchor_7_184" id=
"FNanchor_7_184"></a><a href="#fn7_184" class=
"fnanchor">[184]</a> The two measures, bounty emigration and the
appointment of surgeon-superintendents of emigration would
together, the Governor hoped, ensure to New South Wales a
sufficient supply of labour annually. <a name="FNanchor_7_185"
id="FNanchor_7_185"></a><a href="#fn7_185" class=
"fnanchor">[185]</a> Again, Van Diemen's Land did not at first
feel justified in adopting the new system.</p>
<p>At the end of 1836, in view of these changes, the London
Emigration Committee expressed a desire to relinquish their
functions, especially after the recommendations made by the Waste
Lands Committee of that year. <a name="FNanchor_7_186" id=
"FNanchor_7_186"></a><a href="#fn7_186" class=
"fnanchor">[186]</a> In giving evidence before that Committee,
Wakefield had strongly attacked the principle of allowing such an
important matter as emigration financed by colonial land-revenue
to rest in the hands of a private and irresponsible committee,
and had suggested a special and responsible body should be
appointed for the purpose. <a name="FNanchor_7_187" id=
"FNanchor_7_187"></a><a href="#fn7_187" class=
"fnanchor">[187]</a> The Committee had adopted his suggestion and
had recommended that emigration should be managed by a central
Board responsible to the Government, or directly to Parliament.
<a name="FNanchor_7_188" id="FNanchor_7_188"></a><a href=
"#fn7_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The resignation of the
London Emigration Committee was accepted and Lord Glenelg, early
in 1837, took the opportunity of conforming in some degree to the
recommendation of the Waste Lands Committee by appointing as
Agent-General for Emigration Mr. T. F. Elliot, who had been
secretary to the Emigration Commission of 1831-2. His duty was to
exercise a general superintendence over emigration to all
colonies, and, in regard to Australia, to help in carrying on the
system of Government emigration which he found in force. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_189" id="FNanchor_7_189"></a><a href="#fn7_189"
class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Emigration, then, became at length a
department of government administered by an officer responsible
to the Colonial Office and therefore indirectly to
Parliament.</p>
<p>These changes in land regulation and in emigration had a mixed
reception from the Australian colonists. At first they were
inclined to object vigorously to the abolition of free grants and
to the imposition of a minimum price of 5s. per acre. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_190" id="FNanchor_7_190"></a><a href="#fn7_190"
class="fnanchor">[190]</a> A strong protest was made to Lord
Goderich by a number of merchants and landowners of New South
Wales resident in London. <a name="FNanchor_7_191" id=
"FNanchor_7_191"></a><a href="#fn7_191" class=
"fnanchor">[191]</a> Several deputations from the Australian
colonies waited on Lord Howick at the Colonial Office to complain
of the price of land. <a name="FNanchor_7_192" id=
"FNanchor_7_192"></a><a href="#fn7_192" class=
"fnanchor">[192]</a> Lord Goderich, indeed, when instituting the
change, anticipated that the colonists would complain both
because of its suddenness, and the novelty of a comparatively
high price; but he looked forward to this with equanimity as
necessarily accompanying any change of an existing policy.
<a name="FNanchor_7_193" id="FNanchor_7_193"></a><a href=
"#fn7_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>
<p>The price of land was the point upon which the colonists'
opposition concentrated. In their opinion there was difficulty
enough in obtaining land under the old system without the further
restriction of a minimum price which, they argued, would hinder
the prosperity of the colony and prevent immigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_194" id="FNanchor_7_194"></a><a href="#fn7_194"
class="fnanchor">[194]</a> In the opinion of the colonial press
of New South Wales, free grants of land were bounties offered to
induce emigrants to spend their money in emigrating and settling
in the colony. To sell land, then, and thus to remove this bounty
was to put an effectual stop to emigration, and to turn the tide
to other parts of the world. <a name="FNanchor_7_195" id=
"FNanchor_7_195"></a><a href="#fn7_195" class=
"fnanchor">[195]</a> The <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, in 1831,
expressed what it considered to be the best public opinion on the
new system: "That the new regulations respecting quit-rents and
the purchase of lands are calculated to impede the prosperity of
the colony, partly by oppressing a large proportion of the
settlers, and partly by deterring emigration, is the opinion, we
might almost say the unanimous opinion, of those whose opinion is
entitled to respect. We for our part have met with no rational
man of the contrary opinion." <a name="FNanchor_7_196" id=
"FNanchor_7_196"></a><a href="#fn7_196" class=
"fnanchor">[196]</a> A number of emigrant settlers,
agriculturists, and graziers of New South Wales, in petitioning
Governor Darling in 1831, expressed their "gloomy apprehensions"
as to the consequences of the new land regulations, and submitted
that the price of 5s. per acre was so excessive "that no
accession of emigrant settlers can be looked for under such
terms." <a name="FNanchor_7_197" id="FNanchor_7_197"></a><a href=
"#fn7_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Some settlers wrote their
private protests to the Colonial Office, <a name="FNanchor_7_198"
id="FNanchor_7_198"></a><a href="#fn7_198" class=
"fnanchor">[198]</a> and Bourke, in 1832, reported that the new
regulations "appear to have caused considerable alarm and
discontent to the principal proprietors of the land, and their
friends and followers in the colony." <a name="FNanchor_7_199"
id="FNanchor_7_199"></a><a href="#fn7_199" class=
"fnanchor">[199]</a></p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, too, similar opinions were held.
Governor Arthur thought that 5s. per acre was a very high price,
<a name="FNanchor_7_200" id="FNanchor_7_200"></a><a href=
"#fn7_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and reported that the new
regulations were "very generally unpalatable to the settlers."
<a name="FNanchor_7_201" id="FNanchor_7_201"></a><a href=
"#fn7_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> In Western Australia, in
1832, the settlers viewed with alarm the introduction of the
system of sale because they feared it would prevent emigration,
and they suggested it should be withdrawn by the Home Government.
<a name="FNanchor_7_202" id="FNanchor_7_202"></a><a href=
"#fn7_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>
<p>Even while they disapproved of the sale of land, the colonists
at the same time welcomed the use of the land revenue in
emigration. <a name="FNanchor_7_203" id=
"FNanchor_7_203"></a><a href="#fn7_203" class=
"fnanchor">[203]</a> In 1831 the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> wrote of
the plan that it "was truly excellent, and cannot but have a most
beneficial effect upon the prosperity of the colonies." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_204" id="FNanchor_7_204"></a><a href="#fn7_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The colonists were anxious for any
system of assisted emigration which did not result in bringing
out paupers. <a name="FNanchor_7_205" id=
"FNanchor_7_205"></a><a href="#fn7_205" class=
"fnanchor">[205]</a></p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, while the system of assisted emigration
was well received, the governor, always mindful of its character
as a penal colony, was unwilling to encourage emigration on any
large scale. There were special reasons in that colony for
opposition to the new system. So much land had been already
alienated that it was difficult to raise money from that source
for emigration. <a name="FNanchor_7_206" id=
"FNanchor_7_206"></a><a href="#fn7_206" class=
"fnanchor">[206]</a> Again, of the land that was left, Arthur
said that a great deal of it was of such poor quality that it
would never fetch five shillings an acre. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_207" id="FNanchor_7_207"></a><a href="#fn7_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Arthur was afraid that the abolition
of the system of free grants would mean that there would be no
immigration of small capitalists, and he wished for these
"respectable persons" to whom convicts might be assigned.
<a name="FNanchor_7_208" id="FNanchor_7_208"></a><a href=
"#fn7_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> For the same reason he
objected to anything like a plentiful supply of free labour being
introduced, because, in that case, the employment of convicts by
the colonists would cease, and the Government would be put to
greater expense for their maintenance. In his eyes Van Diemen's
Land was primarily a penal colony, and, while he welcomed female
emigration, he was inclined to discourage anything more than a
select emigration of artisans and agricultural labourers.
<a name="FNanchor_7_209" id="FNanchor_7_209"></a><a href=
"#fn7_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> He feared, also, that, if
the land revenue were used in emigration the capital of the
colony would be sent abroad, and the labourers who arrived might
find none of it to give them employment. <a name="FNanchor_7_210"
id="FNanchor_7_210"></a><a href="#fn7_210" class=
"fnanchor">[210]</a></p>
<p>But, on the whole, although the colonists' objections to the
new system were strenuous enough at first, they did not last very
long, especially when it was found that the money paid for land
went to introduce emigrants. Mr. James Macarthur, in giving
evidence before the Transportation Committee of 1837, expressed
the colonists' attitude when he said that there was at first a
very general feeling in New South Wales that the regulations
would be injurious, because they would prevent emigration, but
that, when it was understood that the land revenue was to be
applied to the introduction of labour, the opposition died down.
<a name="FNanchor_7_211" id="FNanchor_7_211"></a><a href=
"#fn7_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
<p>Two competent observers, one in New South Wales, the other in
Van Diemen's Land, who had both had experience of the old method
of disposing of land, very soon came, quite independently of one
another, to the conclusion that the new system was a great
improvement. Major Mitchell, the famous explorer and
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, wrote in a private letter to
Mr. R. W. Hay, of the Colonial Office, in 1832, that "although
the price of five shillings per acre was at first thought high,
the new system is likely to work better than the old, by which
all good land would probably have been taken up in maximum grants
before the country had any proportionate population." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_212" id="FNanchor_7_212"></a><a href="#fn7_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>
<p>In the same year Governor Arthur wrote in a private letter to
Lord Goderich, that, although the new regulations were not
popular, he was more and more convinced that "they are founded on
a wise and beneficent policy, and, in the end, I have no doubt,
they will prove to have been most advantageous in promoting the
best interests of the colony." <a name="FNanchor_7_213" id=
"FNanchor_7_213"></a><a href="#fn7_213" class=
"fnanchor">[213]</a> Indeed, the fears of the colonists as to the
harmful effects of land sales proved groundless. In Western
Australia during this period very little land was sold, and there
was no emigration fund, but that was due to special causes
relating to the previous lavish system of grants and the scarcity
of good land.</p>
<p>In New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, however, the sale of
land was unchecked, and improved from year to year, while
emigration increased greatly. Not only did emigrants go out with
the assistance of Government, but unassisted emigration grew in
volume, so that in the year 1832 nearly as many persons came out
at their own cost to New South Wales as had come in the three
preceding years put together. <a name="FNanchor_7_214" id=
"FNanchor_7_214"></a><a href="#fn7_214" class=
"fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
<p>All the money used in emigration to Australia at this time
came from the land revenue of these colonies; and, as the sales
of land increased, two closely related questions arose in New
South Wales, one as to the amount which should be spent on
emigration, the other as to who should control the land
revenue.</p>
<p>In the first few years, when emigration financed by land sales
was in the nature of an experiment, a fixed sum was set aside by
the Home Government from the colonial land revenue; but, as the
revenue increased and the scheme proved to be soundly based, the
amount for emigration increased.</p>
<p>From the beginning the colonists expected that the whole of
the proceeds of the land sales would be spent on emigration,
<a name="FNanchor_7_215" id="FNanchor_7_215"></a><a href=
"#fn7_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and this was probably the
idea in Lord Howick's mind when the change of 1831 was
introduced; for then he wrote to the Treasury calling their
attention to "the impolicy of applying to the ordinary current
expenses of the colony that portion of the territorial revenue
which arises from the sale of land. The funds derived from this
source should be looked upon, not as forming a part of the income
of the colony, and available for the purpose of meeting its
annual expenses, but as capital which should not be permanently
sunk, but invested so as to produce a profitable return," the
best mode of investment being female emigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_216" id="FNanchor_7_216"></a><a href="#fn7_216"
class="fnanchor">[216]</a> These words were interpreted by the
colonists to mean that the Home Government was pledged to devote
the land revenue wholly to emigration, and this belief soon
became general in New South Wales. "From what has fallen from His
Majesty's Ministers on the subject," Bourke wrote in 1833, "it is
the received opinion here that the proceeds of the sale of Crown
lands under the existing regulations are pledged to assist
respectable and useful mechanics and labourers and their wives
and families and young unmarried women of good repute to emigrate
from the United Kingdom to New South Wales." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_217" id="FNanchor_7_217"></a><a href="#fn7_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In the next year he suggested that it
would be advisable for the Home Government to use the whole of
the land revenue in this manner. <a name="FNanchor_7_218" id=
"FNanchor_7_218"></a><a href="#fn7_218" class=
"fnanchor">[218]</a> At that time, too, the question of the
amount available for emigration became acute, because the expense
of maintaining their police and gaol establishments was suddenly
thrown upon the colony. This charge had been borne by the
mother-country since 1827, when specific Parliamentary grants for
the civil establishments of the Australian colonies had been
discontinued; <a name="FNanchor_7_219" id=
"FNanchor_7_219"></a><a href="#fn7_219" class=
"fnanchor">[219]</a> and in 1834, the Treasury, considering that
the colonies had sufficiently increased in prosperity, decided
that the colonial revenue should henceforth provide "for the
police establishment, for gaols, and for a certain portion of the
colonial marine, the expense of which is estimated at about
£25,000 per annum." <a name="FNanchor_7_220" id=
"FNanchor_7_220"></a><a href="#fn7_220" class=
"fnanchor">[220]</a> This new expenditure made a large demand on
the resources of the colony, and operated to prevent the land
revenue from being used solely in emigration. It was feared that
the ordinary revenue would not be sufficient to meet the charge,
particularly as the amount suggested of £25,000 a year was much
too low. In 1836 the estimate of expenditure under this head was
£45,000, <a name="FNanchor_7_221" id=
"FNanchor_7_221"></a><a href="#fn7_221" class=
"fnanchor">[221]</a> and it was still higher in the succeeding
years. The colonists, holding the views they did on emigration,
objected to the possible depletion of the land revenue,
especially as the charges for gaols and police were largely due
to transportation, of which they claimed that the mother-country,
which got the benefit, should bear the expense. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_222" id="FNanchor_7_222"></a><a href="#fn7_222"
class="fnanchor">[222]</a> In 1835 they petitioned that the whole
of this charge should not be borne by the colony, and that the
land revenue should not be diverted from emigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_223" id="FNanchor_7_223"></a><a href="#fn7_223"
class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Bourke supported this petition, and
suggested that £20,000 should be paid by the mother-country and
the rest by the colony, because, if the colony had to bear the
whole expense, emigration would be crippled. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_224" id="FNanchor_7_224"></a><a href="#fn7_224"
class="fnanchor">[224]</a> This did not, however, meet with the
approval of the Home Government, and the question by whom the
charges should be borne remained for several years a source of
contention between the colony and the mother-country. That the
Home Government had from the beginning pledged itself to use all
the revenue from the land sales in emigration was formally
asserted, in 1835, by the Emigration Committee of the New South
Wales Legislative Council, who put it on record "that the fund
arising from the sale of lands should be appropriated exclusively
to the purpose of introducing a moral and industrious population;
that they consider this appropriation alike indispensable to the
present interests, and the future prosperity and character of the
colony; and that they regard the opinion expressed by the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and approved by the Lords of
the Treasury, in the light of a pledge by His Majesty's
Government, that the Crown lands of the colony shall be held
sacred to the promotion of emigration." <a name="FNanchor_7_225"
id="FNanchor_7_225"></a><a href="#fn7_225" class=
"fnanchor">[225]</a> On receipt of this recommendation Lord
Glenelg consulted with the Treasury, and urged that as large a
portion as possible of the land revenue should be applied to
emigration, since "the application of the whole of the net
proceeds of the sale of Crown lands in the colony to the
promotion of emigration . . . appears to have been the intention
of Lord Ripon . . . on the first establishment of the present
system of the sale of these lands." <a name="FNanchor_7_226" id=
"FNanchor_7_226"></a><a href="#fn7_226" class=
"fnanchor">[226]</a> The Treasury agreed that emigration should
be considered a primary charge on the land revenue of the colony,
and that for it sufficient funds should be set aside; but they
repudiated any "engagement or understanding that the whole
proceeds of the sales of Crown lands in the Australian colonies
should be devoted to the furtherance of emigration." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_227" id="FNanchor_7_227"></a><a href="#fn7_227"
class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Glenelg then instructed Bourke that
"no portion of such revenue should, on any account, be devoted to
other purposes, until this primary object had been sufficiently
provided for." <a name="FNanchor_7_228" id=
"FNanchor_7_228"></a><a href="#fn7_228" class=
"fnanchor">[228]</a> In the next year, when it was decided to
spend two-thirds of the land revenue on Government emigration and
one-third on bounty emigration, Bourke, taking it for granted
that this meant that the land revenue was to be spent solely on
this object, complained to Glenelg that this was doubtful policy,
if the colony was to continue to meet the charge for gaols and
police, towards which the surplus land revenue had been applied
<a name="FNanchor_7_229" id="FNanchor_7_229"></a><a href=
"#fn7_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> In 1837, then, this
question was still unsettled, and it was to vex the colonists for
some time to come. They had wrung from the Home Government the
concession that the whole of the land revenue ought to be spent
in emigration, but they had no means of compelling this, nor was
any pledge admitted. The charges for gaols and police had to be
met by them, even if it meant encroaching upon the land
revenue.</p>
<p>The other question as to who should control the land revenue
was dominated by the fact that the land sold belonged to the
Crown, and the Crown asserted the right to have the sole control.
At first this revenue was indistinguishable from the ordinary
revenue of the colony, but, in 1833, by the instructions of Lord
Goderich it was separated from the ordinary revenue and was not
appropriated by the Legislative Council, but by the governor
alone under the direction of the Home Government. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_230" id="FNanchor_7_230"></a><a href="#fn7_230"
class="fnanchor">[230]</a> In the following year this was made a
subject of protest in the Legislative Council by Mr. Blaxland,
who claimed the right of that body to appropriate the land
revenue, especially as the Home Government was, in his opinion,
breaking its pledge to expend the money wholly upon emigration.
<a name="FNanchor_7_231" id="FNanchor_7_231"></a><a href=
"#fn7_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The colonists also
petitioned the Crown to the same effect, and Bourke recommended
that their wishes should be complied with. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_232" id="FNanchor_7_232"></a><a href="#fn7_232"
class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Lord Glenelg's answer was, with the
concurrence of the Treasury, <a name="FNanchor_7_233" id=
"FNanchor_7_233"></a><a href="#fn7_233" class=
"fnanchor">[233]</a> to authorize the Governor to place in the
Colonial Treasury any surplus of the land revenue after paying
the expenses of emigration; but at the same time he gave an
explicit denial to the claim of the Legislative Council to have
control over this branch of revenue: "It cannot be too distinctly
understood, that the directions just given are not to be taken as
divesting the Government of the full and uncontrolled power of
applying the Crown revenues, in part or in whole, without the
consent or intervention of the legislature." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_234" id="FNanchor_7_234"></a><a href="#fn7_234"
class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>
<p>After 1831, the new and uniform system of sale of lands in
Australia was strictly maintained by the Home Government in spite
of many applications for a general change or for a waiver of the
regulations in special cases. To some of the applicants for
exceptional treatment, however, it was considered advisable to
grant land under the old regulations where the case was
particularly hard, as, for example, where men had previously been
promised grants and had not chosen them by 1831, or where they
had sailed to the colony on the faith of the older regulations.
But these concessions were always exceptional, and the usual
answer to an application for a free grant was that in no
circumstances could land be disposed of otherwise than by sale.
The Home Government even turned a deaf ear to suggestions made by
those in authority in the colony with a view to improve the
regulations and facilitate the settlement of the land. In 1837,
for instance. Major Mitchell proposed that, in order to encourage
emigrants, they should be allowed to purchase land on their
arrival, at the minimum price of five shillings per acre without
auction. <a name="FNanchor_7_235" id=
"FNanchor_7_235"></a><a href="#fn7_235" class=
"fnanchor">[235]</a> In 1835, too, Bourke made a very similar
proposal that new settlers should be allowed to purchase at the
minimum price any land previously put up for auction at that
price and remaining unsold. In doing this the principle of
competition would, he admitted, be sacrificed, but it would be
compensated by the encouragement given to emigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_236" id="FNanchor_7_236"></a><a href="#fn7_236"
class="fnanchor">[236]</a> A reply given to a petition of some
colonists in New South Wales asking for a change in the land
regulations, illustrates the position taken up by the Colonial
Office. "The existing system of alienating the waste lands of the
Crown having been deliberately adopted, and having been
repeatedly and publicly announced as the plan upon which alone a
title to such lands could be acquired," Lord Glenelg wrote, "it
would be impossible without an actual breach of faith and a
departure from a principle the value of which has been proved by
experience, to revert to the former method of disposing of those
lands." <a name="FNanchor_7_237" id="FNanchor_7_237"></a><a href=
"#fn7_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
<p>The general policy of the Home Government in regard to New
South Wales from 1830 was determined mainly by considerations of
economy, which took the form, in the case of land, of confining
settlement within the fixed limits of location and discouraging
occupation beyond these boundaries. In 1830 a Commission sat in
England to inquire into the revenue and expenditure of the
colonies. <a name="FNanchor_7_238" id=
"FNanchor_7_238"></a><a href="#fn7_238" class=
"fnanchor">[238]</a> Their report on the Australian colonies
commented on the disadvantage and inconvenience of settlements
distant from the seat of government there, which entailed large
and unnecessary expense and increase in Government departments,
and recommended the restriction of settlements within certain
limits "beyond which they should not be allowed to extend without
special authority from His Majesty's Government." <a name=
"FNanchor_7_239" id="FNanchor_7_239"></a><a href="#fn7_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a> While they professed themselves
unwilling to discourage the enterprises of adventurous settlers,
the Commissioners recommended, on grounds of economy, "great
caution in multiplying and extending government establishments in
new districts." <a name="FNanchor_7_240" id=
"FNanchor_7_240"></a><a href="#fn7_240" class=
"fnanchor">[240]</a> The Home Government tried to carry out these
recommendations, partly by attempting to concentrate the settlers
by selling land within the limits of location, and partly by
refusing to enlarge those limits. One of the avowed objects of
the Ripon Regulations was to counteract the tendency of the
settlers to disperse, <a name="FNanchor_7_241" id=
"FNanchor_7_241"></a><a href="#fn7_241" class=
"fnanchor">[241]</a> so that the expenses of government should be
lessened. It was one matter, however, to lay down a policy in the
Colonial Office, where first-hand knowledge of the conditions of
the colonies was wanting, and another matter to apply it
successfully in New South Wales. The Colonial Office adopted as
its watchword "concentration," while the whole movement in New
South Wales during this period was towards dispersion of the
settlers over an increasingly larger extent of country. The
expeditions and discoveries of Oxley (1823), Hamilton Hume and
Hovell (1824), Captain Sturt (1830), and Major Mitchell (1832,
1833, and 1836), opened up the fertile pastoral lands of the
north, south, and west of New South Wales, and sheep and cattle
breeders moved ever further on looking for more and better
pastures. Squatting became a profitable and a widely-followed
pursuit. <a name="FNanchor_7_242" id=
"FNanchor_7_242"></a><a href="#fn7_242" class=
"fnanchor">[242]</a> The squatter drove his flocks over
unoccupied land for which he paid nothing, and the wool industry
of the colony flourished. Bourke described the position in 1834:
"Already have the flocks and herds of the colonists spread
themselves over a large portion of this Southern country. They
are to be found in great numbers in Monaroo Plains to the
westward of Twofold Bay, and some are said to roam as far to the
southward as Cape Howe . . . . It is not beyond the southern
boundary alone the flocks and herds of the colonists have
wandered for suitable pastures. They are numerous to the
south-west along the banks of the Murrumbidgee, and to the north
they have crossed the Mountain Range into Liverpool Plains . . .
. In every direction the desire of procuring good pastures for
sheep has led the colonists far beyond the limits of location."
<a name="FNanchor_7_243" id="FNanchor_7_243"></a><a href=
"#fn7_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> To meet this great
dispersion, signs of which were not wanting in 1830, the Colonial
Office had no definite policy but that of preventing settlement
or occupation outside the boundaries laid down in 1829. The
Government Order of August 1st, 1831, issued by Darling on
receipt of the Ripon Regulations, allowed the sale of land only
within the limits of location, <a name="FNanchor_7_244" id=
"FNanchor_7_244"></a><a href="#fn7_244" class=
"fnanchor">[244]</a> and made no provision for those who wished
to take up lands beyond the limits. By the same Order,
regulations were made for leasing unoccupied lands within the
limits of location. Leases for one year of lots of 640 acres were
put up for auction annually at a minimum price of twenty
shillings, and there was no restriction on the number of leases
which might be held by any one man. The lessee was notified that
the land contained in his lease was still open to purchase and,
if sold, would have to be surrendered by him at a month's notice.
<a name="FNanchor_7_245" id="FNanchor_7_245"></a><a href=
"#fn7_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But those who attempted to
settle or to graze their flocks and herds beyond the limits of
location were treated as trespassers. As early as 1831, Darling
wrote that it was practically impossible to prevent settlers from
sending their cattle outside the boundaries; <a name=
"FNanchor_7_246" id="FNanchor_7_246"></a><a href="#fn7_246"
class="fnanchor">[246]</a> but no attempt was made by the Home
Government to lay down any other policy in regard to this
unauthorized occupation of Crown Lands than to meet it with a
refusal to extend the limits or to give the squatters any right
or title to the land which they held. The problem of how to deal
with the squatters, both within and without the boundaries, grew
more acute every year after 1830. To extend the limits so that
land throughout the colony might be sold would not by itself have
been sufficient; for the squatters were not prepared to pay
anything like five shillings an acre for land for pastoral
purposes. Bourke, however, in the absence of any instructions,
took it upon himself to devise some means of regulating this
unauthorized occupation, which, though it could not be prevented,
might be controlled. His attempt at prevention had been a
failure. In 1833 he had passed an Act <a name="FNanchor_7_247"
id="FNanchor_7_247"></a><a href="#fn7_247" class=
"fnanchor">[247]</a> to protect the Crown Lands from trespass,
and to prevent squatting being considered as giving a title to
the land. Commissioners were appointed under the Act to prevent
intrusion on the Crown Lands, but this was ineffective, for, in
1835, Bourke reported that his Government simply could not
prevent settlers from occupying with their herds and flocks lands
outside the boundaries. <a name="FNanchor_7_248" id=
"FNanchor_7_248"></a><a href="#fn7_248" class=
"fnanchor">[248]</a> The prosperity of the Australian colonies
depended at this time mainly on the pastoral industry. For its
success not a great deal of labour and capital was necessary, but
freedom of access to the unoccupied Crown Lands was essential,
and the policy of preventing this would, if successful, have been
injurious to the best interests of the colony. Some positive
policy, however, was necessary if the title of the Crown to these
lands was to be recognized. The squatters were of all classes,
rich and poor, of reputable and of indifferent character, and
Bourke's difficulty was to find a plan which would suit all
classes; for he feared that even the wealthier and more
respectable squatters would prefer their unauthorized occupation
to a legal title, if the latter were secured at any expense;
while any attempt to enforce a system against the general wishes
of the colonists would be hopeless. <a name="FNanchor_7_249" id=
"FNanchor_7_249"></a><a href="#fn7_249" class=
"fnanchor">[249]</a> His plan, as introduced by an Act <a name=
"FNanchor_7_250" id="FNanchor_7_250"></a><a href="#fn7_250"
class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of 1836, to restrain the unauthorized
occupation of Crown Lands, was to grant licences under which
lands outside the limits of location might be occupied for
pastoral purposes, and to restrain by penalty any unlicensed
occupation. Within the limits of location those occupying Crown
Lands without a lease under the regulations of August 1st, 1831,
were liable to a fine. Outside the limits no one might, on
penalty of a similar fine, occupy without a licence, which was to
be granted for one year to anyone on payment of a fee of £10, and
was renewable on the same terms. The licensee was warned that if
the limits of location were extended the land which he occupied
would be liable to be sold, and all improvements would be
undertaken at his own risk. <a name="FNanchor_7_251" id=
"FNanchor_7_251"></a><a href="#fn7_251" class=
"fnanchor">[251]</a> The system established in this way was
simple and elastic. No honest occupier would be disturbed by it,
while the fees for licences were not intended to bring in more
revenue than would pay the expenses of the Commissioners
appointed to carry the Act into effect. The squatter who took out
a licence had now a definite legal position, and was no longer a
mere trespasser, though he had no claim to the land which he
occupied other than a right to depasture his flocks and herds
there. <a name="FNanchor_7_252" id="FNanchor_7_252"></a><a href=
"#fn7_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>
<p>The policy of restriction adopted by the Colonial Office was
carried into effect also by their efforts to prevent settlement
outside the limits of location. Not only was the practice of
squatting widely extended during this period, but many attempts
were made to acquire from the Government for settlement land
outside the boundaries laid down in 1829. A proposal was made to
the Government of New South Wales in 1834, by Colonel Verner and
others, to buy land at three shillings and sixpence per acre at
Twofold Bay, ninety miles south of the existing boundaries, and
to settle there families from the north of Ireland. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_253" id="FNanchor_7_253"></a><a href="#fn7_253"
class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Bourke, in commenting on the proposal,
objected to any lowering of the minimum price of land, but
suggested that, in view of the prevailing desire of the colonists
to spread beyond the boundaries, the limits of location should be
extended southward so as to include this district. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_254" id="FNanchor_7_254"></a><a href="#fn7_254"
class="fnanchor">[254]</a> In answer to this proposal and to
Bourke's recommendation. Lord Aberdeen, while refusing permission
for the proposed new settlement, definitely pronounced against
any extension of the boundaries, and gave Bourke instructions as
to how to act in case of other similar applications. "Adverting
to the general question to which you call my attention, arising
out of the foregoing proposition, viz., as to the expediency of
extending the location of settlers beyond the present authorized
limits so far to the southward as Twofold Bay, I have to acquaint
you that notwithstanding the advantages which you have pointed
out in your despatch as likely to result from it to the grazing
and other agricultural interests of the colony. His Majesty's
Government are not prepared to authorize a measure, the
consequence of which would be to spread over a still further
extent of territory a population which it was the object of the
late land regulations to concentrate, and to divert for a distant
object, not immediately necessary to the prosperity of the
colony, a portion of its revenues, the whole of which is barely
sufficient to maintain in that state of efficiency which is so
desirable the various establishments and institutions required by
the inhabitants of the districts already occupied. I am glad,
however, of the opportunity which you have thus afforded me of
expressing my sentiments upon this point, and you will not fail
to discountenance any plans which may hereafter be proposed to
you for settling the territory beyond the present limits to which
the location of settlers is restricted." <a name="FNanchor_7_255"
id="FNanchor_7_255"></a><a href="#fn7_255" class=
"fnanchor">[255]</a> In the same year an application for land at
Portland Bay, on the south-west coast of what is now Victoria,
was made by Mr. Thomas Henty and his sons, the story of whose
enterprise in founding the first permanent settlement in that
part of Australia is well known. In 1829 they had obtained a
grant of over 80,000 acres at Swan River, and had brought out a
great deal of capital and stock, but, disappointed with the
quality of the soil, they had sailed to Van Diemen's Land, only
to find that the newly-introduced Ripon Regulations prevented
them from obtaining a free grant of land there. They now proposed
to buy land from the Government at Portland Bay, and in return to
abandon the grant at Swan River. <a name="FNanchor_7_256" id=
"FNanchor_7_256"></a><a href="#fn7_256" class=
"fnanchor">[256]</a> Governor Arthur, through whom the
application was made, recommended the proposal, and suggested
that it would be desirable to settle the land in that
neighbourhood. <a name="FNanchor_7_257" id=
"FNanchor_7_257"></a><a href="#fn7_257" class=
"fnanchor">[257]</a> But this request was also refused, and the
Hentys continued to "squat" <a name="FNanchor_7_258" id=
"FNanchor_7_258"></a><a href="#fn7_258" class=
"fnanchor">[258]</a> at Portland Bay and to petition the
Government for land. In spite of these applications and the
evidence that unauthorized settlement was taking place where
authorized settlement was forbidden, the Home Government strove
to maintain its policy of restriction. Bur the logic of facts
proved in the end to be too strong even for the Colonial Office,
and they were compelled to yield. In 1835 Mr. John Batman sailed
from Van Diemen's Land to Port Phillip, where he concluded a
treaty with the natives by which, according to the forms of
English law, they granted to him, as representing the Port
Phillip Association, about 600,000 acres of land in the
neighbourhood. This grant included the present sites of Geelong
and Melbourne, and was made for a small consideration of knives,
blankets, etc., and a yearly rent of similar articles. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_259" id="FNanchor_7_259"></a><a href="#fn7_259"
class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The members of the Association at once
occupied the land with their sheep and cattle, and asked for
confirmation of their treaty from the Home Government. The
official attitude of the Colonial Office on the general question
of restricting settlement is well shown by a memorandum made by
Mr. R. W. Hay on the receipt of Batman's application. "All
schemes of this kind," he wrote, "have been of late years
discountenanced as leading continually to the establishment of
fresh settlements and fresh expense&mdash;and, if everyone were
allowed to follow his own inclination by selecting a fit place of
residence on the coast of New Holland, all hopes of restricting
the limits of our settlements in that quarter must be at once
abandoned." <a name="FNanchor_7_260" id=
"FNanchor_7_260"></a><a href="#fn7_260" class=
"fnanchor">[260]</a> Although the settlement was made from Van
Diemen's Land and Arthur suggested that it should be subject to
the authority of that colony, <a name="FNanchor_7_261" id=
"FNanchor_7_261"></a><a href="#fn7_261" class=
"fnanchor">[261]</a> the territory was within the borders of New
South Wales, and Bourke at once made it clear that he claimed to
exercise authority there. The land in question being Crown land,
there was no difficulty in dismissing the claim made by the Port
Phillip Association for the validity of their grant from the
natives; but all that Bourke could do in view of Lord Aberdeen's
despatch of 1834 was to issue a proclamation to the effect that
the land was within the borders of New South Wales, that the
treaty was void as against the Crown, and that trespassers there
would be dealt with in the same way as other intruders upon the
vacant lands of the Crown. <a name="FNanchor_7_262" id=
"FNanchor_7_262"></a><a href="#fn7_262" class=
"fnanchor">[262]</a> This done, he wrote to the Colonial Office
for instructions, and meanwhile the informal and unauthorized
settlement at Port Phillip continued to increase. In his despatch
<a name="FNanchor_7_263" id="FNanchor_7_263"></a><a href=
"#fn7_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> to Lord Glenelg advising
the opening of Port Phillip to settlement, Bourke gave the same
reasons as he had given in the case of Twofold Bay, and entered
into the whole question of the policy of restriction. He
quarrelled with the doctrine of concentration, and denied that it
was suitable to the conditions of New South Wales. "Admitting, as
every reasonable person must, that a certain degree of
concentration is necessary for the advancement of wealth and
civilization, and that it enables government to become at once
efficient and economical, I cannot avoid perceiving the
peculiarities which, in this colony, render it impolitic, and
even impossible, to restrain dispersion within limits that would
be expedient elsewhere." <a name="FNanchor_7_264" id=
"FNanchor_7_264"></a><a href="#fn7_264" class=
"fnanchor">[264]</a> The chief of these peculiarities was that
the wool industry, the principal source of the wealth of the
colony, required free access to a wide range of country. "The
colonists must otherwise restrain the increase, or endeavour to
raise artificial food for their stock. Whilst nature presents all
around an unlimited supply of the most wholesome nutriment,
either course would seem a perverse rejection of the bounty of
Providence; and the latter would certainly require more labour
than can be obtained in the colony, or immigration profitably
supply." <a name="FNanchor_7_265" id=
"FNanchor_7_265"></a><a href="#fn7_265" class=
"fnanchor">[265]</a> Moreover, he frankly confessed that the
Government were unable to prevent this dispersion or to remove
intruders. He therefore suggested that it would be more to the
advantage of the colony to sell the land at Twofold Bay and Port
Phillip to the settlers than to try to force them to abandon
their settlements. In this way the various institutions of
society might be there introduced. "To refrain from their
introduction through the fear of encouraging dispersion, is, I am
persuaded, a fallacious policy. The dispersion will go on,
notwithstanding the discouragement, but accompanied by much evil,
that might be prevented by the guidance and control of authority
opportunely introduced." <a name="FNanchor_7_266" id=
"FNanchor_7_266"></a><a href="#fn7_266" class=
"fnanchor">[266]</a> In view of this indictment of their policy
of the preceding five years, and of the fact that a settlement
was actually being established at Port Phillip, the Home
Government made haste to effect a complete change of front, and,
in a despatch of April 13th, 1836, <a name="FNanchor_7_267" id=
"FNanchor_7_267"></a><a href="#fn7_267" class=
"fnanchor">[267]</a> Lord Glenelg allowed land to be sold at
these places outside the limits of location, and at the same time
tried unsuccessfully to reconcile this with the previous policy
of restriction. The principle of the Ripon Regulations, he wrote,
was to counteract dispersion, but this principle had to be
narrowed in its application by the physical peculiarities of the
colony, which was essentially a pastoral country. It was further
limited by the impossibility of repressing by any laws "the
spirit of adventure and speculation" which gave rise to these
unauthorized settlements. "All that remains for the Government in
such circumstances," he wrote, "is to assume the guidance and
direction of enterprises, which, though it cannot prevent or
retard, it may yet conduct to happy results. It may indeed admit
of serious doubt whether the settlers at Port Phillip and Twofold
Bay have not in reality given birth to undertakings which
deliberate reflection would have recommended rather than
discouraged." <a name="FNanchor_7_268" id=
"FNanchor_7_268"></a><a href="#fn7_268" class=
"fnanchor">[268]</a> In other words, he admitted that the policy
of restriction of settlement was unsuited to the needs of the
colony and impossible to enforce. The despatch also approved of
the measures which Bourke had taken, and, on its receipt in 1836,
he threw the district of Port Phillip open to settlement under
the regulations of 1831. <a name="FNanchor_7_269" id=
"FNanchor_7_269"></a><a href="#fn7_269" class=
"fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
<p>It is now possible to answer briefly the question how far the
Wakefield system had been introduced into New South Wales by
1837.</p>
<p>In the first place, a uniform system of sale of waste lands
had been established, but no attempt had been made to secure a
sufficient price. Lord Glenelg, indeed, in the beginning of 1837,
reminded Bourke that the instructions of 1831 had given the
governor discretion to raise the price, <a name="FNanchor_7_270"
id="FNanchor_7_270"></a><a href="#fn7_270" class=
"fnanchor">[270]</a> and that he was at liberty to do so now if
he thought it necessary; <a name="FNanchor_7_271" id=
"FNanchor_7_271"></a><a href="#fn7_271" class=
"fnanchor">[271]</a> but Bourke replied that such a step was
unnecessary, because competition by auction was sufficient to
obtain the full value of the land. <a name="FNanchor_7_272" id=
"FNanchor_7_272"></a><a href="#fn7_272" class=
"fnanchor">[272]</a> From this answer it may be gathered that the
motives actuating Bourke in fixing a price were not those of
Wakefield. Bourke thought he had fixed a proper price, when by
auction the full value of the land was obtained; Wakefield, on
the other hand, wished for a price which would be sufficient to
prevent a labourer from becoming a landowner too soon, whether or
not that price represented the market value of the land. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_273" id="FNanchor_7_273"></a><a href="#fn7_273"
class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>
<p>Again, there was not in New South Wales during this period
anything like the full liberty of appropriation of land which
Wakefield demanded as a necessary condition of the working of his
theory. The governor's discretion still decided what land within
the limits of location was to be put up for sale, while the
policy of preventing settlement outside those limits was totally
foreign to the ideas of Wakefield, who would have desired that
any settler might purchase at the minimum price as much land as
he needed in any place and at any time he wished.</p>
<p>In the next place, part only of the proceeds of the land sales
was devoted to emigration, and the Government expressly avoided
pledging themselves to treat the land fund as sacred to this
purpose. Moreover, the emigration itself was neither well
selected nor well managed. Wakefield wished that the whole
business of land sales and emigration should be conducted by a
public and responsible body charged with determining a sufficient
price and with expending the resulting money in well selected
emigration. Indeed, the only part of the land regulations which
would have had his approval was that dealing with squatting. To
give every one who was anxious to occupy unsold land for pastoral
purposes a right to do so on payment of a small fee, and at the
same time to provide that the land might at any time be sold for
purposes of agriculture, was exactly the principle for which
Wakefield had always argued. <a name="FNanchor_7_274" id=
"FNanchor_7_274"></a><a href="#fn7_274" class=
"fnanchor">[274]</a></p>
<p>The Wakefield system, then, had only been very partially
applied in New South Wales by 1837, but the important principle
of selling land and using some of the proceeds in emigration was
well established.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wakefield had not been idle. During the whole
period he had been working to found the new colony of South
Australia, <a name="FNanchor_7_275" id=
"FNanchor_7_275"></a><a href="#fn7_275" class=
"fnanchor">[275]</a> and, in 1836, he was able to come forward in
public and expound his views on colonization. The systematic
colonizers were satisfied neither with the changes in New South
Wales, nor with the way in which the South Australian colony had
been inaugurated by the Act of 1834; and they contrived to get a
Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to sit in 1836
to examine into the question of the disposal of waste lands in
the Australian colonies, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the
West Indies. Apparently they meant to include the British North
American colonies within the scope of the inquiry, but in this
they were unsuccessful. <a name="FNanchor_7_276" id=
"FNanchor_7_276"></a><a href="#fn7_276" class=
"fnanchor">[276]</a> The Select Committee was strong and
influential, containing as it did such men as H. G. Ward
(chairman). Sir George Grey, W. Hutt, G. Poulett Scrope, W. E.
Gladstone, J. A. Roebuck, Francis Baring, and H. L. Bulwer. No
doubt Wakefield was not above preparing a case for the Committee.
Many of the members were predisposed favourably to his views, and
the Wakefield theory had so many supporters and so few opponents
amongst the witnesses who gave evidence that it was fairly
obvious in which direction the report would tend. Of the eleven
witnesses examined, five were decided adherents of the Wakefield
theory, <a name="FNanchor_7_277" id="FNanchor_7_277"></a><a href=
"#fn7_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> one was hostile to some
parts of it, <a name="FNanchor_7_278" id=
"FNanchor_7_278"></a><a href="#fn7_278" class=
"fnanchor">[278]</a> two represented the Colonial Office,
<a name="FNanchor_7_279" id="FNanchor_7_279"></a><a href=
"#fn7_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> while only three colonists
in all gave evidence, two from Van Diemen's Land, <a name=
"FNanchor_7_280" id="FNanchor_7_280"></a><a href="#fn7_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and one from Trinidad. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_281" id="FNanchor_7_281"></a><a href="#fn7_281"
class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Wakefield was the chief witness, and
he was seen to great advantage in expounding and developing his
theory, answering objections, and condemning an other methods of
disposing of waste land.</p>
<p>The Committee's Report, which was short, was practically a
recommendation of the Wakefield system. They approved of what had
already been done in the Australian colonies between 1831 and
1836, and suggested further action to extend and complete the
principle of land sales and emigration. The principle of a
minimum price they recommended should be established by an Act of
Parliament, in order to give it "a character of permanency and
stability, which it does not possess at present"; but they gave
no opinion as to its amount, "conceiving that the whole tenor of
the evidence goes to prove that it must vary according to the
circumstances of each colony, and can only be determined, in any
one, by the test of experience." They further recommended that
the money provided by land sales should be used to promote
selected emigration to each colony in proportion to the amount
raised there, preference being given to young married couples;
that on the security or the land fund a loan might be raised for
emigration; and that the whole arrangements connected with the
sale of land, including the fixing of the price, the surveying of
the land, and the direction of assisted emigration, should be in
the hands of a Board resident in London, responsible either to
some department of Government or directly to Parliament. <a name=

Mr. R. W. Hay, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the
Colonies, expressed his disapproval in memoranda pencilled on the
pamphlet which are worth preserving as giving the Colonial Office
view of the plan. As to the price of £2 per acre, he wrote, "No
settler would take land upon these terms. They even now complain
at having to pay 5s. per acre for the purchase of it, conceiving
that the valuation is too high at that rate." As to the use of
the land fund in emigration, he wrote, "The proceeds are wanted
for the current expenses of the colony," This pamphlet is in the

admitted the temporary nature of the land regulations. In the
collection of Rules and Regulations which he issued in that year
for the guidance of colonial rulers, he warns them that "the
regulations on that head must be regarded as provisional only, so
far as respects all the minor details." <i>Rules and Regulations

Van Diemen's Land to Mr. Fry, October 9th, 1832. C.O. 280/36. One
of the women, for instance, with a good written character, was
expelled from the Female Orphanage in Van Diemen's Land (where
they stayed until places were found for them) for bringing in a
male convict dressed in women's clothes. Another came out from a
penitentiary with a character "so good that her example may
influence others, very anxious for religious instruction." She
got a good place, but within three weeks was turned away for
drunkenness.</p>

furnish money for conveying emigrants to New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land; and to whom is the work confided? To a committee,
so called by itself, sitting somewhere, but I am sure I do not
know where, in the city of London, consisting of some benevolent
gentlemen and ladies. Thus the State actually confides the
superintendence of emigration, with the public funds, to a
benevolent society; a small party of private persons, including
females, who cannot be under any responsibility, since they have
not to make reports to anybody, and are accountable to no one but
themselves . . . a party of people whom nobody knows anything at
all about, and whose very existence, I believe, was unknown to
the majority of the Members of this Committee, till I mentioned
it just now." The Emigration Committee consisted only of men and
made frequent reports to the Colonial Office.</p>

objection and were ready beforehand with their answer. The Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury "are aware that it may be alleged,
that the very heavy expense of pohce, which constitutes by far
the greater portion of these amounts, as well as the charges
attending the gaols, are principally rendered necessary by the
presence of the convicts; but as the great and rapidly increasing
prosperity of these colonies is so mainly to be attributed to the
advantages derived from the labour of the convicts, and as the
necessity for the large police establishment arises from the
dispersion of the convicts, for the accommodation of the
settlers, it appears to my Lords that the expenditure in question
may be most legitimately charged upon the colonial revenues." J.

from being used in this way for pastoral or agricultural purposes

"#FNanchor_7_244">244</a> In his <i>Government of Victoria</i>,
1897, p. 37, and <i>History of the Australasian Colonies</i>,
1912, p. 63, Professor Jenks writes that this was due to a
deliberate misreading of the Regulations by Darling; but in view
of the recommendations of the Commission of 1830 and the policy
of the Colonial Office from 1831 onwards, especially in regard to
the proposed settlements at Twofold Bay and Port Phillip, it
seems more probable that Darling's restriction of the sale of
land within the limits of location was in keeping with the
intention of the Home Government. The wording of §§ 1 and 2 of
the Ripon Regulations is wide enough to apply to all the land
within the borders of the colony; but the Colonial Office, which
was fully aware of the limits of location laid down by the
Government Order of 1829, did not object to Darling's reading,
and, indeed, in 1834, definitely refused to allow the limits to
be extended. See Despatch of Aberdeen to Bourke, No. 12, December
25th, 1834. C.O. 202/32. R. W. Hay wrote to Major Mitchell (the
Surveyor-General of New South Wales) on the new regulations. "I
quite agree with you as to the necessity of concentrating as much
as possible the settlers who may arrive, which can only be done
by confining the new colonists to certain tracts of country. This
is one of the chief objects which the Government has had in view
in laying down the new Regulations, and it seems the most likely
mode of insuring the payment of a sufficient price for the land
set up to sale." Letter of January 9th, 1832. C.O. 324/87. The

<h4>Chapter VIII</h4>
<h3>THE NEW BRITISH PROVINCE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA</h3>
<p><span class="a">Although</span> the National Colonization
Society was short-lived, its chief members carried on their task
of propagating the Wakefield theory, and, almost from the
beginning, they decided to put it to the test of experiment by
founding a new colony near Spencer's Gulf on the south coast of
Australia. The report made by Captain Sturt after his famous
voyage of 1830 along the River Murray, had brought this part of
Australia before the public notice, and in that direction the
systematic colonizers proposed to place their settlement.
<a name="FNanchor_8_1" id="FNanchor_8_1"></a><a href="#fn8_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "We resolved," wrote Wakefield in 1849,
"to try and establish a fresh colony, in which both our
economical and political views should obtain a fair trial."
<a name="FNanchor_8_2" id="FNanchor_8_2"></a><a href="#fn8_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There were many reasons which rendered
the other Australian colonies unfit in their eyes for an essay in
systematic colonization.</p>
<p>In the first place, leaving Swan River out of consideration,
the system of transportation and assignment of convicts not only
interfered with the proportion between land and labour which it
was hoped to establish, but was abhorrent to them from a moral
point of view. In the next place, they could not hope that the
Wakefield system would have a fair chance of working well in
colonies where already so much land had been freely granted as to
prevent any proper relation between land and labour. In the last
place, they hoped to try an experiment in self-government apart
from the Colonial Office, which was impossible in any of the
existing Australian colonies. Wakefield from the first seems to
have been suspicious of the "completely arbitrary and distant"
<a name="FNanchor_8_3" id="FNanchor_8_3"></a><a href="#fn8_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> rule, as he called it, of the Colonial
Office. Perhaps he was afraid that their lack of system and
foresight in dealing with the land question would be repeated,
perhaps he was anxious to have no controlling hand to interfere
with his schemes. Whatever be the reason his first plan would, if
adopted, have effectually excluded the Colonial Office from the
government of the new colony.</p>
<p>The proposal was mooted by the systematic colonizers in the
autumn of 1830, <a name="FNanchor_8_4" id=
"FNanchor_8_4"></a><a href="#fn8_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
was brought before the Colonial Office in February, 1831, by
Major Bacon, late of the 17th Lancers, who had seen active
service in the Peninsula, at Waterloo where he was severely
wounded, and in the East Indies. <a name="FNanchor_8_5" id=
"FNanchor_8_5"></a><a href="#fn8_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He
merely recommended the founding of a colony in South Australia,
of which he hoped to be governor, and gave no further indication
of his plan than that it was not to cost the mother-country
anything. <a name="FNanchor_8_6" id="FNanchor_8_6"></a><a href=
"#fn8_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Colonial Office at once
showed that they were hostile to the founding of new colonies, on
the ground of expense, by replying that "the Secretary of State
does not feel at liberty at the present moment to hold out any
encouragement to schemes which have for their object the
extension of the number of His Majesty's settlements abroad, and
which, whether founded in the outset by individuals, or by the
Government, are always liable to end in becoming in some way or
other a source of expense to the revenue of this country."
<a name="FNanchor_8_7" id="FNanchor_8_7"></a><a href="#fn8_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The systematic colonizers then drew up a
complete and formal plan <a name="FNanchor_8_8" id=
"FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#fn8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for
founding the new colony by means of a joint-stock company which
should not only manage land-sales and emigration, but also the
government of the colony.</p>
<p>A company, called the South Australian Land Company, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#fn8_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> was to be formed with a capital of £500,000,
one-quarter of which was to be spent in buying land in the
colony, one-quarter in making advances to settlers, and the rest
in employing labour on its own land. The principles on which the
new colony was to be settled were those of the Wakefield system.
No lands were to be disposed of otherwise than by auction at a
minimum price of 5s. in the first year, which was to be raised to
7s. 6d. in the second year, and thereafter raised "until the
price demanded for land shall be that which will ensure the
cultivation of all land granted." <a name="FNanchor_8_10" id=
"FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#fn8_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The whole of the proceeds from the land sales, except what was
needed for the expenses of survey, was to be used in the
emigration of young people of both sexes in equal numbers. The
colonists were to be allowed to pasture their cattle on any land
while it was unappropriated.</p>
<p>On its political side the plan rested upon two principles,
first, that the colonists should defray as soon as possible the
cost of their own government; next, that at no distant date they
should enjoy self-government. Adherence to the principles of
colonization which they laid down was, they considered, the only
way in which to ensure the success of the colony. Therefore, they
argued, the government of the colony should, at first, be in the
hands not of the Colonial Office, but of those well acquainted
with these principles. The company, then, was to recommend a
governor whom the Crown should appoint, and he was to have
absolute power, legislative and executive, with no council to
control him, until the male adult population of the colony
reached 5,000, when a Legislative Assembly to manage all the
affairs of the colony was to be elected annually by the male
adults, and the governor was to be appointed by the Crown.
<a name="FNanchor_8_11" id="FNanchor_8_11"></a><a href="#fn8_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The company was to provide the expenses
of government by way of loan to the colony until twelve months
after the first meeting of the Legislative Assembly, when it was
apparently to exist merely as a joint-stock land company. Various
other provisions were made; there was to be liberty of the Press,
freedom of trade, and no interference with religion, while for
purposes of defence all the male adult colonists were to form a
militia.</p>
<p>The profits of the company were to come solely from the rent
and re-sale of land bought from the Home Government, and the
promoters of the plan held out certain inducements to
subscribers. In the first place, the company, being the first
buyer, would have choice of situation and would take their land
near the port and near the seat of government so that it would
soon possess a position value. Again, the increase in price after
the first year, and in subsequent years, would add to the value
of the company's land. Lastly, the money which the company paid
for land would not only supply labour, but also would cause more
competition for land, and in that case increase the value of
their holding. <a name="FNanchor_8_12" id=

<p>In August, 1831, a deputation consisting of Colonel Torrens,
Major Bacon, Robert Gouger, and G. J. Graham waited on the
Colonial Office, and, in submitting this plan for the approval of
the Government and asking for a charter of incorporation for the
company, they called attention to the advantages which would be
gained by the mother-country from the fact that no expense would
be incurred, that a number of destitute people would be removed
from Great Britain and provided for, and that a new market would
be opened for British manufactures. <a name="FNanchor_8_13" id=
"FNanchor_8_13"></a><a href="#fn8_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p>Following on this proposal the systematic colonizers had
several interviews and conversations both with Lord Howick and
Lord Goderich, and they thought that they had obtained the
approval of the Colonial Office to the plan, subject to two
alterations, first, that the governor should be nominated as well
as appointed by the Crown; next, that a Legislative Assembly
should not be granted until the male adult population numbered
10,000. They at once set about forming the company, and announced
that a charter had been promised by the Government. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_14" id="FNanchor_8_14"></a><a href="#fn8_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a> A long article <a name="FNanchor_8_15" id=
"FNanchor_8_15"></a><a href="#fn8_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
appeared in the <i>Spectator</i> of October 29th, 1831,
explaining and warmly supporting the project, and claiming that
it had the sanction of the Government. Lord Howick at once took
steps to make it plain that the approval on which they relied was
merely his own verbal sanction, that Lord Goderich was by no
means committed to the proposal, but that, if the charter were
approved by the Attorney-General and supported by a respectable
list of subscribers, and if it was clear that the Government were
to be put to no expense, he had little doubt Lord Goderich would
recommend the issue of the charter. <a name="FNanchor_8_16" id=
"FNanchor_8_16"></a><a href="#fn8_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p>Further conversations followed, <a name="FNanchor_8_17" id=
"FNanchor_8_17"></a><a href="#fn8_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and another deputation waited on the Colonial Office, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_18" id="FNanchor_8_18"></a><a href="#fn8_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> but the negotiations fell through. Apparently
the position was that neither side was willing to take the first
step. The Government would not definitely pronounce upon the
scheme until it was before them in detail accompanied by a list
of subscribers influential enough to ensure its success, while
the capitalists supporting it were unwilling to promise their aid
until some definite and unconditional sanction was given by the
Government. <a name="FNanchor_8_19" id=
"FNanchor_8_19"></a><a href="#fn8_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p>In the next year the South Australian Land Company was formed,
under the leadership of Mr. Wolryche Whitmore, with a strong
Provisional Committee, <a name="FNanchor_8_20" id=
"FNanchor_8_20"></a><a href="#fn8_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and similar proposals were laid before Lord Goderich. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_21" id="FNanchor_8_21"></a><a href="#fn8_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> He then refused the sanction of the
Government, because, apart from the difficulty of the practical
operation of the scheme and other objections, "great
inconvenience would arise from the circumstance of a new colony
being placed so near to the penal settlements at Sydney and in
Van Diemen's Land, as that proposed." <a name="FNanchor_8_22" id=
"FNanchor_8_22"></a><a href="#fn8_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
After further interviews the Company sent to Lord Goderich a
charter embodying their scheme with the alteration as to the
appointment of a governor, and deferring the grant of a
Legislative Assembly until the population of the colony reached
50,000. <a name="FNanchor_8_23" id="FNanchor_8_23"></a><a href=
"#fn8_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The charter was submitted by
Lord Goderich to Mr. James Stephen, then Counsel to the Colonial
Office, who expressed his confident opinion that the scheme was
"wild and impracticable," and raised several objections, all of
which were adopted by Lord Goderich and sent to the Company.
<a name="FNanchor_8_24" id="FNanchor_8_24"></a><a href="#fn8_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The principal objections were that the
charter would "transfer to this Company the sovereignty of a vast
unexplored territory;" that there would be no security against
their abuse of the power of legislation, or for their proper
application of public money; and that "all the powers of the
Company, extensive as they are, and involving in their practical
effects the sovereign dominion of the whole territory, are
ultimately to be transferred to a popular assembly, which would
be to erect within the British Monarchy a government purely
republican." <a name="FNanchor_8_25" id=
"FNanchor_8_25"></a><a href="#fn8_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The Company at once expressed their willingness to make any
modifications which Goderich might propose, if only the
principles of land sale, emigration, government by the Company,
and the eventual privilege of a legislative assembly were
retained. <a name="FNanchor_8_26" id="FNanchor_8_26"></a><a href=
"#fn8_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Goderich's reply was to the
effect that, since the Company knew their own minds so little as
to be anxious, on the mere mention of objections, to make
fundamental modifications in their proposal, there could be no
advantage in continuing the correspondence. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_27" id="FNanchor_8_27"></a><a href="#fn8_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p>A large and wealthy body of settlers had been collected by the
Company in expectation of the grant of a charter. Intending
settlers had subscribed £100,000, while others were prepared to
invest another £100,000; <a name="FNanchor_8_28" id=
"FNanchor_8_28"></a><a href="#fn8_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
but, when this break in the negotiations occurred, the Company
was completely dissolved, <a name="FNanchor_8_29" id=
"FNanchor_8_29"></a><a href="#fn8_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
and the intending colonists dispersed, some of them going to the
United States. <a name="FNanchor_8_30" id=
"FNanchor_8_30"></a><a href="#fn8_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The promoters of the South Australian scheme were inclined to
blame Mr. R. W. Hay of the Colonial Office for its lack of
success, and especially for the objections which Lord Goderich
raised, in ignorance that they were the work of Mr. James
Stephen. <a name="FNanchor_8_31" id="FNanchor_8_31"></a><a href=
"#fn8_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Probably however, the true
reason, apart from the objection to founding new colonies on the
score of expense, was not the hostility of any one man, but the
fact that they asked too much from the Colonial Office when they
demanded complete control over the colony, both economic and
political, and proposed to exclude the Colonial Office altogether
from the government.</p>
<p>When Lord Goderich left the Colonial Office in March, 1833,
the hopes of the systematic colonizers revived, and in July of
that year they submitted to Stanley, the new Secretary of State,
practically the same proposal that Goderich had refused. The
colony was still to be founded on the principles of land sales
and emigration, by a joint-stock company which should control and
finance its government until a Legislative Assembly was
introduced, although now the Crown was to appoint the governor
and all officials of the colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_32" id=
"FNanchor_8_32"></a><a href="#fn8_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Stanley showed himself somewhat more sympathetic towards the idea
of founding a new colony, but he imposed conditions which the
Company were not prepared to fulfil, and, after some
correspondence, the negotiations were terminated by a lengthy
silence on the part of the Colonial Office. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_33" id="FNanchor_8_33"></a><a href="#fn8_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p>The next important step in the founding of South Australia was
the publication in November, 1833, of Wakefield's book <i>England
and America</i>, which had an immediate success in reviving the
drooping spirits of the systematic colonizers and rallying the
waverers. Grote and others, who had previously been sceptical
about the new colony, now became its warm adherents, and another
influential body of projectors and intending settlers was formed.
<a name="FNanchor_8_34" id="FNanchor_8_34"></a><a href="#fn8_34"
class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Warned by past failures, they now
determined to abandon the plan of a joint-stock company and to
form an association for the purpose of founding and governing the
colony, which should not be engaged in any way in a pecuniary
speculation, so that there should be no room for the suggestion
that the whole scheme was a job. <a name="FNanchor_8_35" id=
"FNanchor_8_35"></a><a href="#fn8_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
This new body, which was called the South Australian Association,
was to be composed of three classes of members, first, intending
settlers, secondly, those who were willing to aid the Association
without taking a responsible part, thirdly, those who should be
trustees for founding the colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_36" id=
"FNanchor_8_36"></a><a href="#fn8_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
They required from the Government a charter, like those of
William Penn and Lord Baltimore, which should incorporate the
trustees, contain provisions for land sales and emigration, and
allow the trustees to enable joint-stock companies to be formed
to purchase land and assist settlement. Until a Legislative
Assembly was granted the government of the colony was to be in
the hands of the trustees, who were to raise loans for the
necessary expenses, which were to be repaid by the colony.
<a name="FNanchor_8_37" id="FNanchor_8_37"></a><a href="#fn8_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<p>Gouger and his friends worked incessantly in the last three
months of 1833 to form the Association, <a name="FNanchor_8_38"
id="FNanchor_8_38"></a><a href="#fn8_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a> and, by the beginning of 1834, their object
was achieved and the body of intending settlers was large in
number and in capital. <a name="FNanchor_8_39" id=
"FNanchor_8_39"></a><a href="#fn8_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Yet another pamphlet <a name="FNanchor_8_40" id=
"FNanchor_8_40"></a><a href="#fn8_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
came from Wakefield's ready pen, and the systematic colonizers,
having found a friend in Mr. J. Shaw Lefevre, who had recently
entered the Colonial Office as Political Under-Secretary, thought
the movement sufficiently advanced to warrant their approaching
Stanley once more. They now insisted upon the difference between
this project and the last, but found that he preferred the former
plan of a joint-stock company pledged to buy land and therefore
with a pecuniary interest in governing well. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_41" id="FNanchor_8_41"></a><a href="#fn8_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a> Such an interest, he objected, was lacking in
the proposed trustees; moreover they were responsible to no one
and the colony would be a republic independent of the
mother-country. <a name="FNanchor_8_42" id=
"FNanchor_8_42"></a><a href="#fn8_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
He demanded that the management of the colony should be in the
Colonial Office, and declined to proceed further in the
negotiations "unless the government of the colony is to be left
in the hands of the Crown and its constitutional advisers, until
it is able to govern itself." <a name="FNanchor_8_43" id=
"FNanchor_8_43"></a><a href="#fn8_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a></p>
<p>At this stage the systematic colonizers definitely abandoned
their plan of governing the new colony, whether by a joint-stock
company or by a chartered association, and were willing to admit
the claim of the Crown to have control of the government provided
that the twin principles of land sales and selected emiration
were conceded. <a name="FNanchor_8_44" id=
"FNanchor_8_44"></a><a href="#fn8_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p>"It was clear to us," wrote Wakefield in 1849, "that the part
of our South Australian plan to which the Colonial Office most
objected, was a provision for bestowing on the colonists a
considerable amount of local self-government. As we could not
move an inch without the sanction of that Office, we now resolved
to abandon the political part of our scheme, in the hope of being
able to realize the economical part." <a name="FNanchor_8_45" id=
"FNanchor_8_45"></a><a href="#fn8_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
They now asked from Stanley an Act of Parliament embodying the
principles of land sales and emigration, and intimated their
intention to continue in existence as a private and temporary
society to promote the success of the measure. They adverted to
the difficulty of obtaining, under the new scheme, funds for the
expenses of the colonial government, and suggested, since it was
useless to expect a Parliamentary grant, that the money might be
raised, if once their scheme of colonization was firmly
established, by loan on the security of the land sales and the
revenue of the colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_46" id=
"FNanchor_8_46"></a><a href="#fn8_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
In the correspondence and negotiations which followed, the most
debatable point was as to the source from which this fund could
be drawn. Stanley, on the one hand, would not move until
sufficient money was subscribed and guaranteed to carry on the
colonial government for ten years, so as to prevent all expense
to the mother-country. <a name="FNanchor_8_47" id=
"FNanchor_8_47"></a><a href="#fn8_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The Association, on the other hand, could not promise to raise
the money until they knew what kind of an Act of Parliament they
were going to get. <a name="FNanchor_8_48" id=
"FNanchor_8_48"></a><a href="#fn8_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
While matters were in this condition of deadlock, Stanley left
the Colonial Office in June, 1834, and Spring Rice took his
place. The latter had been a schoolfellow of Wakefield, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_49" id="FNanchor_8_49"></a><a href="#fn8_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a> and the systematic colonizers, complaining of
the delay which had taken place, immediately applied to him for
official sanction to their scheme. <a name="FNanchor_8_50" id=
"FNanchor_8_50"></a><a href="#fn8_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
This he promised on the same conditions that Stanley had laid
down, namely, that a capital of at least £50,000 was promised by
intending settlers for investment in the colony, and that the
Bill was not to come into operation until £35,000 had been vested
in Commissioners, for purchase of land, and until sufficient
funds were also promised to support the government of the colony
for the next ten years. <a name="FNanchor_8_51" id=
"FNanchor_8_51"></a><a href="#fn8_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> A
Bill was drafted for the Association, under the superintendence
of Wakefield by his brother Daniel, <a name="FNanchor_8_52" id=
"FNanchor_8_52"></a><a href="#fn8_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
modified by the Colonial Office, <a name="FNanchor_8_53" id=
"FNanchor_8_53"></a><a href="#fn8_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and introduced into the House of Commons by Whitmore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the 30th June, 1834, a large public meeting,
organized by the Association to advertise the colony and obtain
public support, was held in Exeter Hall, when various speakers,
including Whitmore, Torrens, and Grote, all repeated in different
form the arguments for systematic colonization, with which
Wakefield had for some years been identified. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_54" id="FNanchor_8_54"></a><a href="#fn8_54" class=
"fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p>The second reading of the Bill was taken in the House of
Commons after 2 a.m. on July 23rd, when only about fifty members
were present and there was little opposition; but in Committee on
July 29th, Mr. Alexander Baring vigorously attacked the Bill and
only Spring Rice's support enabled it to go safely through.
<a name="FNanchor_8_55" id="FNanchor_8_55"></a><a href="#fn8_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The Bill, however, had few friends, and
when introduced into the House of Lords it met with some
opposition which threatened to be fatal; but the systematic
colonizers managed to enlist the services of the Duke of
Wellington, and, with his influence in its support, the Bill
became law on August 15th, 1834. <a name="FNanchor_8_56" id=
"FNanchor_8_56"></a><a href="#fn8_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p>The battle had not been fought without loss to the victors. In
the course of its passage through the Colonial Office and through
Parliament the Bill had been altered and modified in various
ways. "We struck out this provision," wrote Wakefield in 1849,
"because it displeased somebody, altered another to conciliate
another person, and inserted a third because it embodied
somebody's crotchet." <a name="FNanchor_8_57" id=
"FNanchor_8_57"></a><a href="#fn8_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Wakefield and his associates were by no means satisfied with the
Act in its final form, but there was sufficient of their original
proposal to allow them to hope that, with good management, a
successful colony might be founded by "the first attempt since
the time of the ancient Greeks to colonize systematically."
<a name="FNanchor_8_58" id="FNanchor_8_58"></a><a href="#fn8_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<p>In all the labours which had gone to make possible this
experiment in systematic colonization Wakefield had taken an
important, though not a public, part. He did not appear on the
provisional committees, nor on the deputations to the Colonial
Office, nor at the meeting in Exeter Hall; but in the pages of
Gouger's diary he may be seen consulting with Gouger, "deciding
points roughly," <a name="FNanchor_8_59" id=
"FNanchor_8_59"></a><a href="#fn8_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and advising him in tactics. He looked upon Gouger as his "mere
delegate" <a name="FNanchor_8_60" id="FNanchor_8_60"></a><a href=
"#fn8_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> representing him in public,
and, throughout the whole of the struggle to found South
Australia, his had been the controlling mind. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_61" id="FNanchor_8_61"></a><a href="#fn8_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
<p>The systematic colonizers had triumphed against the opposition
of the permanent officials of the Colonial Office. There is no
doubt but that R. W. Hay and James Stephen were both hostile to
the plan of founding a colony, the former because he thought it
would inevitably result in expense to the mother-country,
<a name="FNanchor_8_62" id="FNanchor_8_62"></a><a href="#fn8_62"
class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the latter because he disbelieved in
the principle of forming a settlement in a new colony by selling
its waste land. Stephen wrote, in 1836, in a private memorandum
for Sir George Grey, of the "crude theory which has given birth
to the South Australian colony," and that "to expect to settle a
new country by an immediate sale of the land seems to me as
rational a scheme as to undertake the building of a bridge across
the Swan River by the sale of the waters." <a name=
"FNanchor_8_63" id="FNanchor_8_63"></a><a href="#fn8_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a> Both, however, once the principle of the Bill
was accepted by the Government, withdrew their official
opposition. <a name="FNanchor_8_64" id=
"FNanchor_8_64"></a><a href="#fn8_64" class=
"fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
<p>The Act <a name="FNanchor_8_65" id=
"FNanchor_8_65"></a><a href="#fn8_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
authorized the creation of one or more provinces <a name=
"FNanchor_8_66" id="FNanchor_8_66"></a><a href="#fn8_66" class=
"fnanchor">[66]</a> in South Australia, <a name="FNanchor_8_67"
id="FNanchor_8_67"></a><a href="#fn8_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a> and the appointment of one or more residents
there to make laws for the colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_68" id=
"FNanchor_8_68"></a><a href="#fn8_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Three or more Commissioners were to be appointed to carry out the
Act. <a name="FNanchor_8_69" id="FNanchor_8_69"></a><a href=
"#fn8_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> They were to have power to
sell land at auction, or otherwise as they might decide, at a
minimum price of 12s., and to employ the proceeds in emigration.
<a name="FNanchor_8_70" id="FNanchor_8_70"></a><a href="#fn8_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They also had power to let unsold land
for pasturage. The funds for carrying on the Government were to
be raised by the Commissioners, by loan up to the amount of
£200,000 on the security of the ordinary revenue of the colony,
<a name="FNanchor_8_71" id="FNanchor_8_71"></a><a href="#fn8_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and with the collateral security of the
land-fund. <a name="FNanchor_8_72" id=
"FNanchor_8_72"></a><a href="#fn8_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
No convicts were to be sent to the colony at any time or under
any circumstances. <a name="FNanchor_8_73" id=
"FNanchor_8_73"></a><a href="#fn8_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
When the population amounted to 50,000 a constitution might be
granted to the colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_74" id=
"FNanchor_8_74"></a><a href="#fn8_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Until £20,000 had been raised by loan and invested in Government
securities, and land had been sold to the amount of £35,000, the
general powers granted by the Act were to be inoperative.
<a name="FNanchor_8_75" id="FNanchor_8_75"></a><a href="#fn8_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
<p>The weak joints in the Act as a practical measure were that
the Commissioners had to provide funds by loans for a government
for which they were not responsible, and the governor who was
responsible alone to the Colonial Office had to depend for his
supplies on the Commissioners. Authority was divided in two Ways;
first, the governor was controlled directly by the Colonial
Office in the normal way, and also indirectly by the
Commissioners' control of supplies; next, in the colony the
disposal of land was in the hands of a Resident Commissioner
responsible to the Commissioners alone, and with the exercise of
his duties the governor could not interfere. Moreover no
provision was made for any local control over expenditure.</p>
<p>After the passing of the Act, the first important step to be
taken was to find suitable candidates for the office of
Commissioner. The South Australian Association submitted to Mr.
Spring Rice the names of several men who were ready to act,
including Whitmore, Grote, Colonel Torrens, and H. G. Ward;
<a name="FNanchor_8_76" id="FNanchor_8_76"></a><a href="#fn8_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a> but, although he approved the
selection, he had neglected to appoint them when, in November,
1834, he left office, and the Duke of Wellington formed his
provisional administration. <a name="FNanchor_8_77" id=
"FNanchor_8_77"></a><a href="#fn8_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The uncertain state of the English political world at the end of
1834 prevented any further steps from being taken until January,
1835, when Gouger and Torrens, wearying of the delay which was
dispersing the body of colonists which had been gathered in 1834,
<a name="FNanchor_8_78" id="FNanchor_8_78"></a><a href="#fn8_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> approached Lord Aberdeen, who had
become Secretary of State for the Colonies in Peel's short-lived
Ministry, and requested permission to submit names for his
approval. <a name="FNanchor_8_79" id="FNanchor_8_79"></a><a href=
"#fn8_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> On the change of Ministries,
however, Grote, Clay and Ward, who had been willing to serve as
Commissioners under the Melbourne Government, refused to take
office because "Tory rule was too repugnant to their
disposition," <a name="FNanchor_8_80" id=
"FNanchor_8_80"></a><a href="#fn8_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and fresh names had to be obtained.</p>
<p>Wakefield was absent in Lisbon from October, 1834, to April,
1835, during the illness and death of his only daughter, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_81" id="FNanchor_8_81"></a><a href="#fn8_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a> and on Gouger and Torrens devolved the
direction of affairs. They selected eight people to serve as
Commissioners, and Wakefield, when he returned to London,
announced that he would not interfere with what was being done,
but would leave matters in Torrens's hands. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_82" id="FNanchor_8_82"></a><a href="#fn8_82" class=
"fnanchor">[82]</a> After some months' delay, during which Mr.
Charles Grant (afterwards Lord Glenelg) succeeded Lord Aberdeen
at the Colonial Office, the nominees were approved, with the
addition of Mr. E. Barnard and Mr. J. Shaw Lefevre as
representatives of the Colonial Department, and were gazetted as
South Australian Colonization Commissioners on May 15th, 1835.
<a name="FNanchor_8_83" id="FNanchor_8_83"></a><a href="#fn8_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
<p>Some changes were made in their ranks, when, for example,
Angas resigned on the formation of the South Australian Company,
and Wright because of the share which he took in raising a loan
for the Commissioners; but, on the whole, they seem to have
deserved Wakefield's description of them as "ignorant and
careless amateurs." <a name="FNanchor_8_84" id=
"FNanchor_8_84"></a><a href="#fn8_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
They were engaged in the business of establishing and governing a
colony sixteen thousand miles distant in an uninhabited spot, and
for this they had had no previous experience or training. Again,
their numbers made them too unwieldy a body for expediting
business if all attended, while there was no compulsion on them
to attend and exercise the very great power entrusted to them,
nor had they any interest, except a merely philanthropic one, in
governing economically and well. In their conduct of business
they wasted much time and became in effect a kind of debating
club, discussing frivolous and unmeaning subjects instead of
attending to more serious business. <a name="FNanchor_8_85" id=
"FNanchor_8_85"></a><a href="#fn8_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Colonel Torrens complained, too, that they did not understand the
principles of the new experiment in colonization, and that he had
more than once to fight alone for the maintenance of those
principles. <a name="FNanchor_8_86" id=
"FNanchor_8_86"></a><a href="#fn8_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
<p>The law officers of the Crown early decided that, in their
dealings with the funds raised for the expenses of the colony,
the Commissioners were exempted by the Act from control either by
the Colonial Office or by the Treasury. <a name="FNanchor_8_87"
id="FNanchor_8_87"></a><a href="#fn8_87" class=
"fnanchor">[87]</a> Again, Lord Glenelg, who was head of the
Colonial Office during the early years of the Commissioners'
rule, deliberately adopted the policy of giving them full control
of the new colony, and consulted them on every possible occasion,
<a name="FNanchor_8_88" id="FNanchor_8_88"></a><a href="#fn8_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> appointing and recalling governors and
other officials on their recommendation. <a name="FNanchor_8_89"
id="FNanchor_8_89"></a><a href="#fn8_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
<p>The Commissioners, then, possessed of great power and
practically irresponsible, were inexperienced and
amateurish&mdash;Wakefield called them "a dilettante commission,
an amateur commission, a sort of fancy commission," <a name=
"FNanchor_8_90" id="FNanchor_8_90"></a><a href="#fn8_90" class=
"fnanchor">[90]</a> and they had to carry out a new and doubtful
experiment. The wonder is not that they failed, but that they
never seemed to entertain any doubts as to their success.
<a name="FNanchor_8_91" id="FNanchor_8_91"></a><a href="#fn8_91"
class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p>The first important work for the Commissioners was to sell
enough land and raise enough money by loan to fulfil the
conditions of the Act and begin to found the colony. It therefore
became necessary to decide at what price the land should be sold,
and on this question Wakefield definitely broke with the
Commissioners and with Gouger. The Act itself had given some
guidance by fixing the minimum price at 12s. per acre and
empowering the Commissioners to raise it, but that amount was
fixed by the Committee of the South Australian Association, who
had, in April, 1834, at the request of Stanley, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_92" id="FNanchor_8_92"></a><a href="#fn8_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a> entered into calculations as to what the
minimum price should be. In their opinion four agricultural and
one non-agricultural labourer were required to cultivate 200
acres, and therefore the minimum price of that amount of land
should be such as would provide for the emigration of ten people,
five men and five women. The cost of passage per head they
estimated at £15, so that the minimum price was determined at
15s. per acre, but, in order not to make land too difficult nor
too easy of access to labourers and to induce capitalists to
emigrate, they reduced the price to 12s. per acre. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_93" id="FNanchor_8_93"></a><a href="#fn8_93" class=
"fnanchor">[93]</a> This calculation, as Wakefield pointed out,
was mere guesswork, based on factors of which only the cost of
passage to the colony was in any way certain, and he strenuously
objected to its being made the basis of a sufficient price.
<a name="FNanchor_8_94" id="FNanchor_8_94"></a><a href="#fn8_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> "I have always thought," he wrote to
Gouger in May, 1835, "£2 the very lowest price that ought to be
required for the object in view . . . . If they start with 12s.,
the colony will be a second Swan River, and if you support that
price, many people will naturally suppose that I do. It is for
the sake of a year or two hence that I wish to guard myself from
only a seeming participation, through you, in an experiment
which, in my opinion, <i>must</i> fail." <a name="FNanchor_8_95"
id="FNanchor_8_95"></a><a href="#fn8_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a> He disclaimed for himself and his plan of
colonization all responsibility for the success of the colony.
"With 12s. for the lowest price, this colony will be no trial of
the principle which it has cost me so much pains to establish
thus far." <a name="FNanchor_8_96" id=
"FNanchor_8_96"></a><a href="#fn8_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p>His objection was reasonable enough from his own point of
view, because the basis of his theory was a restrictive price
sufficient to prevent labourers from becoming landowners too
soon, and sale of land at any other price was not the Wakefield
system but something else. The practical difficulty, however, was
that no one seemed able to determine in any other way than by
rough and ready calculations what the sufficient price should be
in amount, and Wakefield gave little assistance, considering that
it was not for him but for the Commissioners to fix. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_97" id="FNanchor_8_97"></a><a href="#fn8_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a> Over the question of price Wakefield
quarrelled with Gouger, who thought it expedient that the price
should at first be low, for no one would buy land at £2 per acre,
<a name="FNanchor_8_98" id="FNanchor_8_98"></a><a href="#fn8_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and the breach between them was never
healed. <a name="FNanchor_8_99" id="FNanchor_8_99"></a><a href=
"#fn8_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> "How do you know that nobody
will buy land at a sufficient price?" he wrote to Gouger, "That
experiment has not yet been tried. That experiment may be tried
here without risk to anyone. We wholly disagree, you see, on what
you call principle. I must now consider you as one of the
opponents of my principle." <a name="FNanchor_8_100" id=
"FNanchor_8_100"></a><a href="#fn8_100" class=
"fnanchor">[100]</a> Wakefield had abandoned the political side
of his scheme, but he was not prepared without a struggle to
yield the principle of a sufficient price. He accordingly
addressed to the Commissioners a powerful letter revealing his
interest in and work for the colony from the beginning and
stating a strong case for the Wakefield theory. He argued that
the suggested price of 12s. was not a sufficient price, and urged
them either to make a complete trial of his theory by selling
land at a sufficient price, or to abandon the colony altogether.
"Our trust is," he wrote, "that the experiment, when fairly
tried, will succeed. Therefore, I venture to say, let it be tried
fairly, or not at all for the present; rather let there be no
colony at all for the present, than one which does not fairly try
the experiment of a hired-labour price for land." <a name=
"FNanchor_8_101" id="FNanchor_8_101"></a><a href="#fn8_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Amongst other things he warned the
Commissioners against the plan of auction, reminding them that
the Act left the method of sale to their discretion, and
recommending "that the price named should be the only price,
whatever the quantity, quality or situation of the land sold, or
whoever the buyer." <a name="FNanchor_8_102" id=
"FNanchor_8_102"></a><a href="#fn8_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a> But Wakefield was no longer listened to.
When the time came to put his theory to the test of practice, the
Commissioners thought more of selling enough land to found the
colony, than of following Wakefield's opinion as to what was a
sufficient price. They adopted his suggestion of a uniform price,
but fixed it at £1 per acre.</p>
<p>One of the chief merits which, from the beginning, the
systematic colonizers had claimed for their scheme was that it
was to cost nothing to the mother-country. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_103" id="FNanchor_8_103"></a><a href="#fn8_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> First the South Australian Land
Company and then the South Australian Association, was to provide
the funds for carrying on the government and even when both these
bodies had dissolved, the projectors of the scheme, and
particularly Colonel Torrens, spoke of it as being
self-supporting. They applied to the experiment of founding the
new colony the unhappy term, as it afterwards proved, of
"self-supporting colonization." <a name="FNanchor_8_104" id=
"FNanchor_8_104"></a><a href="#fn8_104" class=
"fnanchor">[104]</a> The Commissioners, when appointed, followed
their chairman. Colonel Torrens, in this matter, and decided
questions of policy according to whether or not they were in
accord with the "self-supporting principle." For instance, they
first chose Colonel Napier to be governor, but, when he demanded
troops and the power to draw on the British Government for money
in case of need, they refused on the ground that his demand was
"at variance with the self-supporting principle upon which the
new colony is to be established." <a name="FNanchor_8_105" id=
"FNanchor_8_105"></a><a href="#fn8_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a> "Self-supporting colonization" apparently
meant two very different things; first, that the whole expenses
of emigration were to be defrayed out of the proceeds of the
land-sales, secondly, that the expenses of government and
settlement were to be borne by loans raised on the security of
the future revenue and of the land-sales. Only in the former
sense did Wakefield accept the doctrine. While his plan was one
for a joint-stock company, or even for a chartered association,
he believed that the money could be easily raised to prevent the
colony from ever becoming a charge on the mother-country; but
when the control of the colony was divided between the Colonial
Office and a body of irresponsible Commissioners his opinion
altered. <a name="FNanchor_8_106" id=
"FNanchor_8_106"></a><a href="#fn8_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a> But Wakefield's control ceased with the
passing of the Act, and the Commissioners continued to claim for
the new colony the advantage of being self-supporting in both
senses. They had little doubt but that loans would easily be
raised, in amount sufficient to carry on the settlement and
government of the colony until it was able to support itself.
<a name="FNanchor_8_107" id="FNanchor_8_107"></a><a href=
"#fn8_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>
<p>Having fixed the price of land at £1 per acre, the
Commissioners issued their regulations for the disposal of land
in the new colony, <a name="FNanchor_8_108" id=
"FNanchor_8_108"></a><a href="#fn8_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a> and set to work to sell enough to enable
them to begin colonization. But at that price little land was
sold; the body of capitalists and intending settlers had been
dispersed by the long delay, and it appeared as if the colony
would never be started. As a last resource the Commissioners
altered their regulations in two important respects. First, in
accordance with an agreement made with the South Australian
Company, the price of land was temporarily reduced to 12s. per
acre (those who had paid £1 were recompensed in land) and,
secondly, a system of special surveys was established. By this
latter regulation, anyone who paid the price of 4,000 acres was
entitled to demand a special survey of not more than 15,000 acres
in any part of the colony, out of which, when surveyed, he might
choose his land. <a name="FNanchor_8_109" id=
"FNanchor_8_109"></a><a href="#fn8_109" class=
"fnanchor">[109]</a> At the same time the South Australian
Company was formed by G. F. Angas and others as a joint-stock
land company to buy land at the lowered price from the
Commissioners, and to develop its resources. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_110" id="FNanchor_8_110"></a><a href="#fn8_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Their purchases enabled the
Commissioners to complete the necessary amount prescribed by the
Act. When a loan was raised and £20,000 of it placed in a
Guarantee Fund, the conditions of the Act were satisfied, and by
November, 1835, the way was clear for the foundation of the new
colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_111" id="FNanchor_8_111"></a><a href=
"#fn8_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>
<p>The Commissioners were allowed to nominate the governor and
all the officials for the colony. <a name="FNanchor_8_112" id=
"FNanchor_8_112"></a><a href="#fn8_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a> Their first choice for governor was Colonel
Napier. But, when his conditions were refused, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_113" id="FNanchor_8_113"></a><a href="#fn8_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Captain Hindmarsh was nominated, and
he with all the other nominees of the Commissioners, was
appointed to office by the Crown. <a name="FNanchor_8_114" id=
"FNanchor_8_114"></a><a href="#fn8_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
<p>The first part of a surveying party proceeded to the colony at
the end of March, 1836, the rest, under Colonel Light, the
Surveyor-General, sailed on the 1st May, 1836, and three months
afterwards, the governor and the first official body of emigrants
left. The initial mistake was thus made of allowing the settlers
to tread too closely upon the heels of the surveyors. One ill
consequence was that for some years the surveys were behindhand.
Settlers, however, were so anxious to go out that they did not
wait for the sailing of the official ships, but proceeded to the
colony on their own account, and thus forced the hands of the
Commissioners. <a name="FNanchor_8_115" id=
"FNanchor_8_115"></a><a href="#fn8_115" class=
"fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
<p>With much care Colonel Light chose the present site of the
city of Adelaide, wisely guided rather by the presence of fertile
land than by the attraction of a good harbour near at hand.
<a name="FNanchor_8_116" id="FNanchor_8_116"></a><a href=
"#fn8_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Although his choice was
vigorously opposed at the time, <a name="FNanchor_8_117" id=
"FNanchor_8_117"></a><a href="#fn8_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a> the majority of the colonists approved it,
and time has justified him.</p>
<p>Governor Hindmarsh during his term of office suffered from the
consequence of the division of authority, and quarrelled not only
with the Resident Commissioner, who, as the representative of the
Commissioners, had control of the lands in the colony and of
emigration, but also with many of the other officials. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_118" id="FNanchor_8_118"></a><a href="#fn8_118"
class="fnanchor">[118]</a> As a result he was recalled on the
recommendation of the Commissioners, <a name="FNanchor_8_119" id=
"FNanchor_8_119"></a><a href="#fn8_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> and superseded by Lieut.-Colonel Gawler, in
whom were united the offices of Governor and Resident
Commissioner, so that he was controlled directly by the Colonial
Office as Governor, and by the Commissioners as Resident
Commissioner, and indirectly by the Commissioners, upon whom he
was dependent for the funds necessary to carry on the colonial
government. <a name="FNanchor_8_120" id=
"FNanchor_8_120"></a><a href="#fn8_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a></p>
<p>Gawler arrived in South Australia on October 13th, 1838, and
soon afterwards reported a distressing state of things in the
colony. There was no system in the public offices, and scarcely
any records of public accounts; the finances were in confusion
and the Treasury overdrawn; salaries were unpaid and the colonial
revenue negligible. Moreover, the surveys were behindhand, and
there were few settlers engaged in agriculture, most of them
being occupied with land-jobbing in Adelaide. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_121" id="FNanchor_8_121"></a><a href="#fn8_121"
class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Within a few days of his arrival
Gawler notified the Commissioners of his intention to increase
the surveying staff, so that those who had bought land might be
settled upon it. He also intimated that he would have to depart
from his instructions and draw bills on the Commissioners for the
expenses of government. <a name="FNanchor_8_122" id=
"FNanchor_8_122"></a><a href="#fn8_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> The Commissioners replied approving of his
conduct, and granting him ample powers to carry on the surveys
and to incur any additional expense for this purpose. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_123" id="FNanchor_8_123"></a><a href="#fn8_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>
<p>Gawler's policy was based on the belief that a new colony
could not be established without a liberal government expenditure
in its early years, <a name="FNanchor_8_124" id=
"FNanchor_8_124"></a><a href="#fn8_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a> and he proceeded to carry out this policy by
increasing the survey department and undertaking many public
works. In addition, he found it necessary to spend considerable
sums in organizing a police force, and in maintaining on
Government works those emigrants who could not obtain work
elsewhere. During his term of office, lands were surveyed and
sold, emigrants poured in, public works on a large scale were
commenced, and, although the revenue increased considerably,
nearly all these expenses were met by bills drawn upon the
Commissioners. South Australia seemed to be rising on a wave of
prosperity.</p>
<p>Meantime the Commissioners had borrowed in all £80,000 for the
expenses of the colonial government, <a name="FNanchor_8_125" id=
"FNanchor_8_125"></a><a href="#fn8_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a> and were occupied in selling land and
selecting and sending out emigrants. In 1839, they found it
necessary to obtain an amending Act which gave them power to
raise loans on easier terms and to borrow either from the revenue
or the emigration fund for the benefit of the other. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_126" id="FNanchor_8_126"></a><a href="#fn8_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a> They at once made use of this power by
borrowing largely from the emigration fund to meet the expenses
of the government of the colony. All reports as to the colony
ignored the fact that its apparent prosperity was caused by the
large Government expenditure of borrowed money, and South
Australia was held up as an example of successful colonization,
costing nothing to the mother-country. <a name="FNanchor_8_127"
id="FNanchor_8_127"></a><a href="#fn8_127" class=
"fnanchor">[127]</a> Colonel Torrens, after much importuning of
the Colonial Office, had, in 1837, secured a salary as chairman
of the South Australian Commissioners, <a name="FNanchor_8_128"
id="FNanchor_8_128"></a><a href="#fn8_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> but when, at the end of 1839, the remaining
Commissioners requested an interview with Lord John Russell on
the subject of their own remuneration, <a name="FNanchor_8_129"
id="FNanchor_8_129"></a><a href="#fn8_129" class=
"fnanchor">[129]</a> Russell took the opportunity of dismissing
them <a name="FNanchor_8_130" id="FNanchor_8_130"></a><a href=
"#fn8_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and appointing in their
place a new Commission, called the Colonial Land and Emigration
Board, consisting of Messrs. Torrens, T. F. Elliot and Villiers,
who were also to act as Emigration Commissioners for all the
British Colonies. <a name="FNanchor_8_131" id=
"FNanchor_8_131"></a><a href="#fn8_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a> Even with their last breath the retiring
Commission congratulated themselves that "the result of our
labours has been the establishment, without cost to the
mother-country, of a colony possessing the essential elements of
stability and prosperity. The rapid progress which the province
of South Australia has hitherto made may be retarded, but cannot
now be arrested." <a name="FNanchor_8_132" id=
"FNanchor_8_132"></a><a href="#fn8_132" class=
"fnanchor">[132]</a> But within a few months of their dismissal,
the new Commissioners, who were now being called upon to face
Gawler's bills, became alarmed, and invited the attention of the
Secretary of State to the financial situation of the new colony.
<a name="FNanchor_8_133" id="FNanchor_8_133"></a><a href=
"#fn8_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> An attempt on the part of
the new Commissioners to raise a loan of £120,000, the residue of
the amount which the original Act allowed, failed, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_134" id="FNanchor_8_134"></a><a href="#fn8_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and, in September, 1840, they advised
Gawler that they refused to accept any more bills, and that he
was to cease to draw upon them. <a name="FNanchor_8_135" id=
"FNanchor_8_135"></a><a href="#fn8_136" class=
"fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
<p>The new experiment had ended in bankruptcy for an amount so
great that the Home Government was forced to come to the rescue
and institute a strict inquiry into the affairs of the colony.
They advanced a loan of £155,000, appointed a Select Committee to
inquire and report, and, in the meantime, recalled Gawler and, on
the same vessel which carried this despatch, sent out Captain
George Grey to take his place. <a name="FNanchor_8_136" id=
"FNanchor_8_136"></a><a href="#fn8_136" class=
"fnanchor">[136]</a></p>
<p>Gawler had spent money at the rate of about £140,000 for the
year 1839, <a name="FNanchor_8_137" id=
"FNanchor_8_137"></a><a href="#fn8_137" class=
"fnanchor">[137]</a> and £175,000 for the year 1840, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_138" id="FNanchor_8_138"></a><a href="#fn8_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a> when the colonial revenue was about
£30,000 a year, and it remains to be considered how far this
expenditure was justified.</p>
<p>The chief items consisted of surveys, expenses in connection
with emigration, and public works.</p>
<p>In the earliest proposal of the systematic colonizers,
provision had been made for the expenses of survey to be defrayed
out of the proceeds of the land sales; <a name="FNanchor_8_139"
id="FNanchor_8_139"></a><a href="#fn8_139" class=
"fnanchor">[139]</a> but in the course of the long negotiations
this salutary provision had been somewhere omitted, and the
revenue fund raised by loan was charged with this expense. The
regulations adopted by the Commissioners decreed that surveys
should always be in advance of the demand, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_140" id="FNanchor_8_140"></a><a href="#fn8_140"
class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and, had not Gawler attempted to carry
out this regulation as quickly as possible, it would have meant a
breach of faith with the settlers. Indeed, as already stated,
when the surveys were found to be behindhand the Commissioners
authorized Gawler to increase the staff and to incur any expense
necessary to bring them up to the demand, and even complimented
him on his success. <a name="FNanchor_8_141" id=
"FNanchor_8_141"></a><a href="#fn8_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> Moreover, the system, of special surveys
proved very expensive, and to survey 15,000 acres cost nearly as
much as was paid for the 4,000 acres selected. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_142" id="FNanchor_8_142"></a><a href="#fn8_142"
class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
<p>The expenditure on emigration consisted partly in transporting
emigrants and their belongings from the landing place to
Adelaide, and partly in maintaining them until they could get
employment and whenever they were unemployed. In their
regulations as to emigration the Commissioners definitely pledged
themselves to support all emigrants and their families, if ever
unemployed, by providing labour at reduced wages on Government
works. <a name="FNanchor_8_143" id="FNanchor_8_143"></a><a href=
"#fn8_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>
<p>The expenditure for public works, for example Government
buildings and improvements at the Port, was on a somewhat
different footing. Gawler found it necessary for the conduct of
public business and for the accommodation of commerce to begin
these works; and for some of them he obtained the approval of the
Commissioners. <a name="FNanchor_8_144" id=
"FNanchor_8_144"></a><a href="#fn8_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
<p>But there seems no doubt that the expenditure under each head
was somewhat in excess of what was necessary, even if he acted
with the direct or indirect approval of the Commissioners.</p>
<p>In the first place, although the surveys were unavoidably
expensive when rates of wages and prices of provisions in the
colony were high, yet Gawler encouraged rather than discouraged
the system of special surveys which was one of the most expensive
items.</p>
<p>In the next place, the maintenance of emigrants was conducted
on an extravagant scale. The arrangements made were so liberal
that many emigrants preferred remaining in the comfort of
Government employment at a low rate of wages to facing the
difficulties of labour in the country even at a higher wage.
<a name="FNanchor_8_145" id="FNanchor_8_145"></a><a href=
"#fn8_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> By the time Grey arrived in
the colony emigrants had come to look upon Government employment
as a right instead of a privilege, and applicants for relief were
in some cases found to be owners of stock or land, while others
were saving money out of what they received from the Government.
<a name="FNanchor_8_146" id="FNanchor_8_146"></a><a href=
"#fn8_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>
<p>In the third place, some of the public works were undertaken
in a careless and extravagant manner. The gaol, for example,
which was one of the most costly items under this head, was
pronounced by Grey to be more than sufficient for the needs of
the colony, and a large enough one could have been built at a
much less cost. The works at the Port, too. Grey found to have
been conducted in a reckless and discreditable manner. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_147" id="FNanchor_8_147"></a><a href="#fn8_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
<p>Gawler's defence <a name="FNanchor_8_148" id=
"FNanchor_8_148"></a><a href="#fn8_148" class=
"fnanchor">[148]</a> of his conduct amounted in effect to this,
that the instructions which he had received from the
Commissioners were totally inadequate to the situation in which
he found himself, and that therefore he was forced to discard
them, and to rely solely upon the discretion given to him to act
in cases of emergency. <a name="FNanchor_8_149" id=
"FNanchor_8_149"></a><a href="#fn8_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a> He pointed out that these instructions were
intended to apply to a population of about 4,000, and were
inapplicable to a community numbering nearly 16,000. Moreover, he
claimed that the Commissioners had approved not only of his
departure from the instructions but also of most of the public
works which he had undertaken. For the amount spent in surveys he
had clear justification in the pledges given to settlers by the
Commissioners, and the only subject of expenditure to which they
could take objection was that on public works. These, he argued,
were part of the necessary outfit of the colony, and in regard to
them it was wiser to make permanent rather than temporary
provision even if it meant a heavy outlay. He considered, too,
that, by commending his conduct in using his emergency power and
in drawing bills, and by refraining from any censure until the
end of 1840, the Commissioners had authorized his policy of
Government expenditure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Commissioners maintained that he had
sent them merely vague estimates, without details of expenditure,
had set their instructions at naught, and had justified as an
emergency a course of conduct extending over two years. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_150" id="FNanchor_8_150"></a><a href="#fn8_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
<p>The Commissioners' instructions to Gawler were framed with
very little foresight. They were "too minute to be obeyed, too
vague to be restrictive." <a name="FNanchor_8_151" id=
"FNanchor_8_151"></a><a href="#fn8_151" class=
"fnanchor">[151]</a> The estimates on which they were based were
inadequate, and Gawler was forced by the situation of the colony
to depart from them. <a name="FNanchor_8_152" id=
"FNanchor_8_152"></a><a href="#fn8_152" class=
"fnanchor">[152]</a> Again, for most of the items of expense
Gawler clearly had either the direct or the indirect authority of
the Commissioners, the expenditure for surveys and the
maintenance of emigrants was directly sanctioned, and that for
police and public works indirectly. By refraining, too, from
disapproving of his conduct until the end of 1840, they led him
to believe that what he was doing was in accord with their
wishes. Moreover, the Select Committee of 1841, without giving a
decided opinion upon Gawler's conduct, reported that those who
censured his expenditure "have been unable to point out any
specific items by which it could have been considerably reduced
without great public inconvenience." <a name="FNanchor_8_153" id=
"FNanchor_8_153"></a><a href="#fn8_153" class=
"fnanchor">[153]</a></p>
<p>Gawler's case then, as against the Commissioners, was a very
strong one. <a name="FNanchor_8_154" id=
"FNanchor_8_154"></a><a href="#fn8_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a> They seem to have exercised a very slack
supervision over him, and were in reality ignorant of what was
necessary to the establishment of a new colony. In Gawler's
words, "The Commissioners were desirous to form a fine colony,
and abstractedly they were willing to authorize the measures
necessary to accomplish their end; but . . . they did not
calculate the cost of them, nor had they any adequate conception
of the difficulties arising from the state and requirements of a
new and large community suddenly collected and planted in an
unexplored wilderness." <a name="FNanchor_8_155" id=
"FNanchor_8_155"></a><a href="#fn8_155" class=
"fnanchor">[155]</a> The root of the evil was in the original
Act, which confided the business of colonization to a private and
irresponsible body, divided authority in such an inconvenient
manner that neither the Colonial Office nor the Commissioners
could effectually exercise it, and prescribed the dangerous
method of raising funds for establishing the colony by loans at a
high rate of interest on a precarious security. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_156" id="FNanchor_8_156"></a><a href="#fn8_156"
class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
<p>But, even if Gawler was justified by the authority of the
Commissioners, he cannot be wholly acquitted of blame for the
disasters which befell the colony. He was hardly warranted in
discarding from his first arrival in the colony all his
instructions except the one which allowed him to act upon his own
discretion. <a name="FNanchor_8_157" id=
"FNanchor_8_157"></a><a href="#fn8_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a> Then, too, he was not ignorant of the extent
to which the Act allowed the Commissioners to borrow for the
expense of the colonial government, and he exceeded this limit.
Finally, his deliberate policy of Government expenditure proved
harmful to the prosperity of the colony. By employing a
considerable amount of labour on Government works and by spending
money liberally, he accentuated the concentration of population
about Adelaide, the neglect of agriculture, the land-jobbing, and
the mania for speculation, which he had found in existence on his
arrival. This policy, combined with the maintenance of emigrants
on too favourable terms, caused the price of labour to rise to
such an extent that agriculture became unprofitable. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_158" id="FNanchor_8_158"></a><a href="#fn8_158"
class="fnanchor">[158]</a> On the whole, however, though his
policy may have been mistaken, Gawler deserves more sympathy than
he has usually received. His position was one of extraordinary
difficulty. With vague and inadequate instructions he was sent
out to establish a new colony, and, on his arrival found it in
such a state that he was forced to incur large expense; the
Commissioners showed no signs of disapproval until their funds
were exhausted, and even expressly sanctioned many of his most
expensive undertakings. <a name="FNanchor_8_159" id=
"FNanchor_8_159"></a><a href="#fn8_159" class=
"fnanchor">[159]</a> But, when the colony failed, the
Commissioners and the projectors of the experiment laid the blame
at his door, <a name="FNanchor_8_160" id=
"FNanchor_8_160"></a><a href="#fn8_160" class=
"fnanchor">[160]</a> and, though his personal honour was
vindicated, he never obtained from the Government any general
justification for his conduct.</p>
<p>Captain Grey arrived in South Australia in May, 1841, with
instructions to make all possible reductions in expenditure, and
not to incur fresh expenditure excepting in cases of extreme
emergency. <a name="FNanchor_8_161" id=
"FNanchor_8_161"></a><a href="#fn8_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a> His policy for a new colony was to make no
large outlay of Government funds, so that the price of labour
should be prevented from rising, and it should pay the settlers
to take to agriculture. <a name="FNanchor_8_162" id=
"FNanchor_8_162"></a><a href="#fn8_162" class=
"fnanchor">[162]</a> He immediately began to make extensive
reductions in all Government Departments, abolishing some,
cutting down the expenses of others, and discontinuing public
works. <a name="FNanchor_8_163" id="FNanchor_8_163"></a><a href=
"#fn8_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
<p>He was aided in this by the fact that the system of special
surveys was at the same time abandoned by the Home government.
<a name="FNanchor_8_164" id="FNanchor_8_164"></a><a href=
"#fn8_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> By these measures he
managed by the end of 1841 to reduce the Government expenditure
from the rate of £150,000 a year, at which he found it, to
£40,000. <a name="FNanchor_8_165" id=
"FNanchor_8_165"></a><a href="#fn8_165" class=
"fnanchor">[165]</a> He also took steps at once to deal with the
question of maintaining emigrants at the public expense, and laid
it down that while they should not be allowed to starve, they
would no longer have the same privileges as before. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_166" id="FNanchor_8_166"></a><a href="#fn8_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a> He stopped all Government rations,
reduced the rate of their wages, giving them just a sufficient
amount to place them beyond the reach of want, and endeavoured to
force them into private employment. The stoppage of public works
threw a great number out of employment, and, for a time, the
Government was supporting no less than one-twelfth of the total
population. <a name="FNanchor_8_167" id=
"FNanchor_8_167"></a><a href="#fn8_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a> His reforms were carried only in the face of
much opposition, and the destitute emigrants were very
discontented with their new condition. To meet this large
increase in numbers. Grey was forced to draw bills on the
Treasury, which, recognizing that this was a proper case of
emergency, accepted them. But at the same time the Home
Government rebuked him for his leniency in dealing with the
unemployed, and directed that their wages should be further
reduced and surplus labourers shipped off to the other
Australasian colonies. <a name="FNanchor_8_168" id=
"FNanchor_8_168"></a><a href="#fn8_168" class=
"fnanchor">[168]</a> In the meantime, however. Grey had firmly
adhered to his policy, and it proved so successful that, by the
end of 1842, he was able to report that every able-bodied
labourer was in full employment. <a name="FNanchor_8_169" id=
"FNanchor_8_169"></a><a href="#fn8_169" class=
"fnanchor">[169]</a></p>
<p>Grey found the task of directing the colonists to agriculture
not very difficult. When the Government expenditure was
definitely checked, and the colonists thrown upon their own
resources, the energy which they had thrown into land-speculation
and the building of a town was turned towards what should have
been their first care. <a name="FNanchor_8_170" id=
"FNanchor_8_170"></a><a href="#fn8_170" class=
"fnanchor">[170]</a> Labour was now both plentiful and cheap,
agriculture became profitable, and advanced with rapid strides,
<a name="FNanchor_8_171" id="FNanchor_8_171"></a><a href=
"#fn8_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> while the country
population grew at the expense of the town. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_172" id="FNanchor_8_172"></a><a href="#fn8_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The figures of the distribution of
population and of the amount of cultivated land tell their own
tale. In 1840 there was a population of 14,610, of which 8,439
were in Adelaide and 6,121 in the country. In 1843 there was a
population of 17,366, of which 6,107 were in Adelaide and 11,259
in the country. <a name="FNanchor_8_173" id=
"FNanchor_8_173"></a><a href="#fn8_173" class=
"fnanchor">[173]</a> Between 1840 and 1842 the population was
well nigh stationary, immigration having ceased with the
commencement of 1841, while the land under cultivation increased
from 2,686 acres in 1840, to 7,092 in 1841, and to 19,641 in
1842. <a name="FNanchor_8_174" id="FNanchor_8_174"></a><a href=
"#fn8_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>
<p>One mistake only Grey made. When Gawler had been instructed to
cease drawing bills on the Commissioners, he had drawn bills on
the Treasury which had been dishonoured. <a name="FNanchor_8_175"
id="FNanchor_8_175"></a><a href="#fn8_175" class=
"fnanchor">[175]</a> Gawler had also promised to draw further
bills on the Treasury to pay those who had advanced money in the
colony to the Government, and this debt, incurred by Gawler, was
brought before Grey for settlement. He scrutinized the items
carefully, and, although he had been warned not to take measures
without authority for the settlement of Gawler's debts, he
assumed the responsibility of drawing bills on the Treasury to
pay these accounts to the amount of £14,000. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_176" id="FNanchor_8_176"></a><a href="#fn8_176"
class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The Treasury at once refused to accept
the bills, on the ground that, unlike his bills for the expenses
of maintaining the unemployed, they were not drawn on account of
any emergency, and Grey was directed to pay the debt by means of
interest-bearing debentures issued in the colony. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_177" id="FNanchor_8_177"></a><a href="#fn8_177"
class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Grey was naturally disappointed and
keenly felt the discredit. <a name="FNanchor_8_178" id=
"FNanchor_8_178"></a><a href="#fn8_178" class=
"fnanchor">[178]</a> He knew the risk which he ran; but he acted
in accordance with what he conceived to be his duty, <a name=
"FNanchor_8_179" id="FNanchor_8_179"></a><a href="#fn8_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and always remained of the opinion
that his action had been necessary and beneficial. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_180" id="FNanchor_8_180"></a><a href="#fn8_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The Home Government were sorry to have
to refuse his bills, but were impressed with the necessity, after
Gawler's doings, of showing the colonists that the governor's
power to draw on home funds was very restricted. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_181" id="FNanchor_8_181"></a><a href="#fn8_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a> At the same time Grey's services were
fully recognized by the Home Government. In announcing to him
that his bills had been dishonoured, Lord Stanley wrote: "I think
it right to convey to you the assurance that, although Her
Majesty's Government have seen reason to disapprove of this
particular proceeding, yet in other respects, the tenor of your
administration, so far as it has fallen within their cognizance,
has been such as to leave unimpaired the confidence of the
Government in the prudence and discretion of your measures."
<a name="FNanchor_8_182" id="FNanchor_8_182"></a><a href=
"#fn8_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> A year later, when further
information had been received from South Australia, Lord Stanley
gave to Grey unqualified praise for his excellent administration
of the colony during a most critical period. "I have the
satisfaction," he wrote, "of assuring you, that in reviewing your
conduct of the financial affairs of South Australia, the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury concur with myself, in attaching
great importance to your services; and are not less ready than I
am to acknowledge the zeal, the ability, and the firmness which
have characterized your efforts to retrieve the colony from the
embarrassments in which it was involved." <a name=
"FNanchor_8_183" id="FNanchor_8_183"></a><a href="#fn8_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
<p>By the end of 1841 the Select Committee on South Australia had
reported, and the Home Government had determined on its line of
policy towards the colony. The Select Committee had condemned the
government by Commissioners which the original Act had
established, and had recommended that the colony should be placed
on the same footing as the other Australian colonies in this
respect. Lord Stanley introduced a Bill in 1842 to give effect to
this recommendation, which passed into law with little
discussion; and South Australia took its position as an ordinary
colony under the control of the Colonial Office. The Act took
away all authority from the Commissioners, converted the loan of
£155,000 into a gift to the colony, and provided for the
establishment of a nominated Legislative Council similar to those
of the other Australian colonies. <a name="FNanchor_8_184" id=
"FNanchor_8_184"></a><a href="#fn8_184" class=
"fnanchor">[184]</a></p>
<p>The Home Government had dealt handsomely with South Australia.
In addition to the gift of £155,000, a further sum of £60,000 was
put on the estimates of 1842 to meet the bills drawn by Gawler
and by Grey. But, although the Select Committee had recommended
that the money borrowed by the Commissioners from the emigration
fund should be repaid, this recommendation was not carried out.
<a name="FNanchor_8_185" id="FNanchor_8_185"></a><a href=
"#fn8_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p>Another Act of 1842, which applied also to the other
Australasian colonies, regulated the disposal of waste lands in
South Australia. The minimum price was fixed at £1 per acre, but
sale by auction was introduced instead of a uniform price, while
the proceeds were divided into two parts, one half being devoted
to emigration, and the other half to the care of the aborigines,
to surveys, and to improving the means of communication. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_186" id="FNanchor_8_186"></a><a href="#fn8_186"
class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>
<p>By the beginning of 1843 the colony had passed its worst
difficulties <a name="FNanchor_8_187" id=
"FNanchor_8_187"></a><a href="#fn8_187" class=
"fnanchor">[187]</a> and was on the high road to prosperity; so
that the discovery of copper at the Kapunda and Burra Burra mines
in 1842 and 1844, to which the recovery has often been
attributed, merely accelerated its progress. <a name=
"FNanchor_8_188" id="FNanchor_8_188"></a><a href="#fn8_188"
class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
<p>How far was the Wakefield system applied in South Australia,
and how far was it a failure? <a name="FNanchor_8_189" id=
"FNanchor_8_189"></a><a href="#fn8_189" class=
"fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
<p>The establishment of a government by Commissioners who divided
control between themselves and the Colonial Office was no part of
the Wakefield theory, and was admitted on all sides to be an
entire failure. <a name="FNanchor_8_190" id=
"FNanchor_8_190"></a><a href="#fn8_190" class=
"fnanchor">[190]</a> The system of establishing a colony without
expense to the mother-country by means of money borrowed on the
security of future revenue, which was part of Wakefield's scheme
for founding new colonies, also proved, under the management of
the Commissioners, to be a failure. The plan of selling land at
what Wakefield held to be a "sufficient price" was never adopted,
and, in Wakefield's opinion, this by itself was enough to vitiate
the experiment as a trial of his theory. Indeed, to the low price
established he attributed the fact that the settlers took up more
land than they could use. <a name="FNanchor_8_191" id=
"FNanchor_8_191"></a><a href="#fn8_191" class=
"fnanchor">[191]</a></p>
<p>But, if the Wakefield theory is taken to mean the sale instead
of the free granting of land, and the use of the proceeds in
selected emigration, it was in this case conspicuously
successful. A prosperous colony of 16,000 people had been
established, and over 200,000 acres of land sold, in what was
previously a wilderness; and the emigrants sent out were
judiciously selected. Indeed, while admitting the indispensable
part played by Grey, it must not be forgotten that the recovery
of South Australia was in a large measure due to the character of
the early settlers. Grey himself said, in 1894, that "the calibre
of the early settlers in South Australia gave me trust in the new
Anglo-Saxondom in the Southern Hemisphere . . . . There was a
worth, a sincerity, a true ring about them, which could not fail
of great things." <a name="FNanchor_8_192" id=
"FNanchor_8_192"></a><a href="#fn8_192" class=
"fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
<p>Another important factor which made for success was the good
quality of the land. Wakefield and his associates, in comparing
Western Australia with South Australia to the disadvantage of the
former, were apt to forget that the land around Perth had
disappointed expectations, while that around Adelaide had
justified the good opinions formed of it; <a name=
"FNanchor_8_193" id="FNanchor_8_193"></a><a href="#fn8_193"
class="fnanchor">[193]</a> so that, when the settlers ceased land
speculation and betook themselves to agriculture, their efforts
were well rewarded. <a name="FNanchor_8_194" id=
"FNanchor_8_194"></a><a href="#fn8_194" class=
"fnanchor">[194]</a></p>
<p>Grey himself was of opinion that, if land sales and emigration
were properly conducted, they formed an excellent system of
establishing a new colony; <a name="FNanchor_8_195" id=
"FNanchor_8_195"></a><a href="#fn8_195" class=
"fnanchor">[195]</a> and the Select Committee of 1841, while
condemning the provisions which had been made for managing the
colony, reported that the principle established of land-sales and
emigration was a sound one.</p>

themselves with the South Australian Association." There is no
doubt that the initial impulse came from the Colonization
Society. Bentham, in his manuscript notes on the Wakefield

chief objection to this scheme in the outset is that the
foundation of a new colony will to a certain extent divert
emigrants from those already founded; and that a large expense
will be occasioned to the Government ultimately by the foundation
of a new settlement, whatever expectation of immunity from

knew where, and grasping a tract of territory embracing several

Australian Commissioners, June 2nd, 1835. Appendix to Report of
<i>Select Committee on South Australia</i>, 1841. "Nearly seven
years ago, I was induced to inquire into the causes of the
disasters which, without a single exception, have befallen new
colonies that were planted in an extensive country by emigrants
from a civilized state. This inquiry suggested to me a plan of
colonization, which was first made public in 1829. In the course
of six years, that plan was adopted by three different
associations; first by the Colonization Society of 1830, next by
the South Australian Land Company of 1831-2, and lastly by the
South Australian Association, who framed the Act of Parliament
which you have undertaken to carry into effect. In the course,
too, of those six years, the plan has been defended and explained
in so large a number of pamphlets and books, that a list of them
would surprise you. Now all of those books were written by me,
and the whole of those pamphlets either by me or by friends of
mine; while I also composed nearly the whole of the
advertisements, resolutions, prospectuses and proposals, and of
the applications, memorials, letters and replies to the
Government, and other documents of any importance which were
adopted by those three associations. The draft of a charter
submitted to the Government by the South Australian Association,
and the Act of Parliament which was substituted for that proposed
charter, were drawn by a near relative of mine, under my
immediate superintendence. As I was concerned in the formation of
those three societies, so with each of them I held constant
communication, partly by means of frequent interviews with some
leading members of their committees, partly by almost daily
conversation or correspondence with some person or other who
represented my opinions, informed me of whatever was done or
proposed, conveyed suggestions which I wished to make, and
resisted, with arguments agreed upon beforehand, all sorts of
endeavours to alter the plan of colonization which I had formed.
By entering more into detail, I could readily satisfy you that in
the steps which led to the passing of the South Australian Act, I
have had even a more constant and active participation than
appears by this general statement."</p>

enough&mdash;now that the Parliament has determined on founding
another colony, it is his business to do all he can to make it
succeed." C.O. 386/11. Stephen never doubted from the beginning
that the scheme would fail, and, when the colony became bankrupt
in 1840, he considered his predictions verified. "I never had the
slightest doubt from the commencement," he wrote in 1840, "that
such would be the issue of this very crude project." Memorandum

important part of your duty will be to take care that no
labouring emigrant falls into a state of destitution. For this
purpose, you are authorized to provide a maintenance for all such
persons, and their families, until they shall have obtained, or
whenever they shall be without, employment, at wages adequate to
their support; requiring, in return for such maintenance, that
they shall labour upon the public works, as may be agreed upon
between the Governor and yourself." 2nd Report, 1837, Appendix 4.

were given to Gawler. 3rd Report, 1839, Appendix 11. Acc. and

pledged to the emigrants to support them may be seen from § 53 of
the general information respecting the colony published by the
Commissioners. "On the arrival of the emigrants in the colony
they will be received by an officer, who will supply their
immediate wants, assist them in reaching the place of their
destination, be ready to advise with them in case of difficulty,
and at all times give them employment, at reduced wages, on the
government works, if from any cause they should be unable to
obtain it elsewhere . . ." Appendix No. 4 to First Report of

do this without remonstrances, and with an increase of the
general prosperity in something less than a year, may, perhaps
prove the extravagance of the former system, but certainly shows
great sagacity and moral courage on the part of the reformer."

<h4>Chapter IX</h4>
<h3>WAKEFIELD AND THE DURHAM REPORT</h3>
<p><span class="a">By</span> 1837 the racial and political
strife, which had been going on in the two Canadas for some
years, broke out into open rebellion. A brief sketch of the
previous history and conditions of these colonies is necessary in
order to understand the situation with which the British
Government suddenly found that they had to deal. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_1" id="FNanchor_9_1"></a><a href="#fn9_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> The Imperial Act of 1791 <a name=
"FNanchor_9_2" id="FNanchor_9_2"></a><a href="#fn9_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> had separated Upper from Lower Canada, and had
given to each colony an elective Legislative Assembly and a
nominated Legislative Council. Lower Canada was mainly French,
and Upper Canada mainly British, while in both there was friction
between the two races. The Assemblies had no direct control over
the Executive, and this led to constant struggles in which the
Legislative Councils, for the most part, took the side of the
Executive. Naturally the quarrel turned largely upon the question
of finance. The Assemblies attempted to gain their object of
controlling the Executive through their command over supplies;
and deadlocks between the two Houses, and refusal of supply by
the Assemblies, were common, especially in Lower Canada. In 1831,
unconditional control over the Crown revenues, with the exception
of the territorial revenue, was given to the Assemblies by the
Home Government, in the hope that a Civil List would be granted,
and Government officials thereby be secured from the consequences
of a refusal of supplies; but, while Upper Canada granted a Civil
List, Lower Canada did not, and sought yet further control of the
Executive. Year by year after 1831, the ill-feeling between the
two races and the friction between the Assemblies and the
Executives grew greater. On the whole, in Lower Canada the French
majority supported the Assembly, and the English minority the
Executive. In Upper Canada the strife was not so acute; and the
struggles centred around the position and constitution of the
Legislative Council, which was dominated by a group of men,
united by ties of friendship and interest, to whom was given the
name of the Family Compact, and who, in the absence of popular
control, really governed the colony. Although the struggle was in
terms for financial control and for an alteration in the
constitution of the Legislative Council, yet in reality it was
one for responsible government. "They had not hitherto in so many
words," writes Sir Charles Lucas of the majority in Lower Canada
in 1835, "demanded that the Executive Council should be
responsible to the Legislature, but the essence of their demands
was to obtain full control of all the Executive offices by
securing entire command of all the means of paying them."
<a name="FNanchor_9_3" id="FNanchor_9_3"></a><a href="#fn9_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A Commission of Inquiry appointed by the
Home Government in 1835, consisting of Lord Gosford, Sir Charles
Grey and Sir George Gipps, failed to relieve a situation which
was rapidly becoming impossible, and in 1837 the Home Government
intervened. Lord John Russell introduced and carried in the House
of Commons a series of Resolutions, rejecting the demand for
responsible government, and allowing payments of the arrears
owing to executive officers to be made out of the colonial
revenue, of which control had been given up in 1831. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_4" id="FNanchor_9_4"></a><a href="#fn9_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> The resolutions were naturally unpopular in
Canada, and a rebellion broke out, which was confined mainly to
the French Canadians, and was easily put down.</p>
<p>But to crush rebellion was by itself no solution of the
problem of colonial government. The Melbourne Ministry,
therefore, found themselves forced to inquire into the Canadian
grievances, to examine the causes of discontent, and to put
matters, if possible, on a footing satisfactory to the colonists
and to the mother-country. In this emergency, they induced
Parliament to pass a Bill suspending the Constitution of Lower
Canada, and appointed Lord Durham as Governor-General of the
North American Colonies and High Commissioner to inquire into
their government.</p>
<p>Durham at once showed both wisdom and courage in choosing as
his chief assistants Charles Buller and Edward Gibbon Wakefield,
the two men in all Britain who had given most serious attention
to the subject of colonization and colonial government. No
objection could be taken to the appointment of Buller; but
Wakefield's past history made his case different. Durham had
appointed as his legal adviser an old friend, Mr. Thomas Turton,
to whose name an early scandal attached, and when complaint was
made in Parliament on this score, Glenelg wrote instructing
Durham not to employ Wakefield in any public capacity. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_5" id="FNanchor_9_5"></a><a href="#fn9_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> Durham was unwillingly forced to acquiesce;
but Wakefield, although he was able to obtain no public position
and was forced to keep himself in the background, did
nevertheless proceed to Canada, and throughout Durham's mission
gave him counsel and advice. That he played an important part in
Canada will be seen from the recommendations in the Durham Report
on government and land policy. Durham is reported to have written
that he never erred except when he departed from Wakefield's
advice. <a name="FNanchor_9_6" id="FNanchor_9_6"></a><a href=
"#fn9_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Durham had only made Buller's
acquaintance in the summer of 1837, <a name="FNanchor_9_7" id=
"FNanchor_9_7"></a><a href="#fn9_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
it is quite possible, as Dr. Garnett suggests, that Durham and
Wakefield had been already known to one another for some years.
<a name="FNanchor_9_8" id="FNanchor_9_8"></a><a href="#fn9_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> However this may be, Durham became and
remained a close friend to both Buller and Wakefield. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#fn9_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> Wakefield sailed in a different ship from the
others; but Buller had every opportunity during the voyage to
Canada, in constant communication with Durham, of discussing and
developing his views on the subject of colonial government.</p>
<p>Durham, Buller, and Wakefield, when they went out, all had the
same preconceived ideas as to what was at the bottom of the
Canadian difficulties. Each thought that the sole matter in
dispute was self-government; and, overlooking the racial
question, they sympathized with the Canadians in their struggle
for self-government. All three, however, changed their opinions
after first-hand acquaintance with the Canadas; <a name=
"FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#fn9_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> and Durham, whose view nevertheless seems to
have been clearer than theirs in this case, admitted that his
expectation was disappointed. In his Report he wrote, in
often-quoted words, "I expected to find a contest between a
government and a people: I found two nations warring in the bosom
of a single state: I found a struggle, not of principles, but of
races." <a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href=
"#fn9_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p>It is not necessary here to enter upon any of the details of
Durham's mission to Canada, nor indeed to consider his Report in
any other light than as laying down a policy of colonial
government, not for Canada alone, but applicable to all white
colonies at a certain stage of their existence. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_12" id="FNanchor_9_12"></a><a href="#fn9_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a> A great deal of the Report is concerned with
the actual state of the British North American Colonies,
especially Lower Canada, and it contains proposals meant for
their improvement. Here, however, it need not be discussed how
far Durham's detailed proposals were carried into effect, nor how
far they were suitable to the conditions of the Canadas.</p>
<p>Two points alone will be dealt with, first, those provisions
of the Report which recommend responsible government together
with the maintenance of the connection between mother-country and
colony; and, next, the recommendations as to the management and
control of the waste lands and of emigration.</p>
<p>A word may be said as to the question of the authorship of the
Durham Report, which has occasioned some mild controversy. The
current epigram, "Wakefield thought it, Buller wrote it, Durham
signed it," is quite misleading, except in so far as it calls
attention to the fact that Buller and Wakefield played an
important part in deciding on its underlying policy. Durham was
not the kind of man to have his Report dictated to him, or
written for him by his subordinates. At the same time he was the
kind of man to choose his subordinates carefully, to listen to
their advice, and to give them all due credit for their aid.
Indeed, whatever may have been their faults, all three excelled
in generosity, and as Buller and Wakefield would have been the
last to claim credit for Durham's work, so Durham was the first
to admit the help he had received from them. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_13" id="FNanchor_9_13"></a><a href="#fn9_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a> Whatever may be thought as to the authorship
of the Report, there is no doubt about the most important fact
that it expressed the unanimous and considered opinion of the
three men mainly concerned in its production. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_14" id="FNanchor_9_14"></a><a href="#fn9_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p>In its policy of responsible government the Durham Report was
entirely in keeping with the earlier doctrine of colonial
self-government advocated by Wakefield and Buller. In Canada the
leaders of the systematic colonizers, who accompanied Durham, had
an opportunity of developing the political side of the Wakefield
theory; and indeed the doctrine of colonial self-government has
proved to be the most enduring part of their work. Up to that
time their energies had been devoted mainly to the Australasian
colonies, where, for a variety of reasons, the economic and
social side of the Wakefield system had been more prominent.
Self-government could not then be much more than a pious
aspiration for communities like New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, saddled with the burden of transportation; and it was far
distant from new colonies like Western Australia, South
Australia, or the proposed new settlement of New Zealand. In
those colonies the essentials of the problem had been how to
colonize a large empty continent, and how to provide a supply of
labour which would enable the penal colonies to do without
convicts. Problems of government, important as they were,
necessarily remained in the background. Wakefield, for example,
postponed his plan of self-government for South Australia in
order to realize the economic part of his system. Now, however,
when their attention was focussed for the while on Canada, the
problem which they found there was of a different kind. The
economic question of how to settle a huge sparsely-inhabited
country still presented itself; but here it was overshadowed by
the fact that problems of government had arisen which had found
no other solution than civil war. The systematic colonizers now
had to deal with a people free from the taint of transportation,
with a fairly long history of representative institutions, and a
tradition of bad government, or at least, of government
unsatisfactory to the colonists. In these circumstances, it was
inevitable that Wakefield and Buller should recur to their
earlier doctrines of colonial self-government, and should try to
see how far they could be applied as a solution of the political
difficulties in Canada. In their first attempts at colonial
reform, they had been alive to the fact that good colonial
government was an indispensable adjunct to colonial prosperity.
Good colonial government meant for them self-government in a
wide, and not very well defined sense, including freedom from the
arbitrary rule of the Colonial Office. Probably the grant of a
representative Assembly would, at least for the time, have
satisfied their aspirations for the Australian colonies. But, in
dealing with Canada, it was obvious that the mere grant of
representative institutions was not sufficient. There had long
been elected Assemblies in both the Canadas, but political
struggles had gone on, and even civil war had not been averted.
The one fact which seemed to emerge from the welter of Canadian
politics was that representative government as adopted there had
failed. Premising the necessity for colonial self-government,
they were forced, then, to inquire into the reason for this
failure. They found their answer in the fact that for want of the
necessary direct control over the Executive, the colonists
through their Assemblies were unable to control their own policy,
and therefore, in reality did not possess self-government. So
emerged the doctrine of responsible government, the subjection of
the Executive to the control of the popular Assembly, not as
anything new or startling, but as the necessary complement of
representative institutions. They came to the important
conclusion that the only condition under which representative
institutions in a colony could possibly work well was that the
Executive should be subordinate to the popularly elected
Assembly. Too much stress need not be laid on the passage in the
<i>Letter from Sydney</i>, "They might frame their own laws, in a
colonial Assembly, under the eye of a viceroy, incapable of
wrong, and possessing a veto like the king of England, but whose
secretaries, like the ministers of England, should be responsible
to the people"; but, to a man who had written those words in
1829, it was no long step, in 1838, to advocate the full doctrine
of responsible government.</p>
<p>This term, it is usually agreed, appeared first in a speech
which Stanley made in the House of Commons, in 1829, when
introducing a petition from Upper Canada. <a name="FNanchor_9_15"
id="FNanchor_9_15"></a><a href="#fn9_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> Durham, in his Report, understood it to mean
the subjection of the Executive to the control of the elected
Assembly. <a name="FNanchor_9_16" id="FNanchor_9_16"></a><a href=
"#fn9_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p>Having laid it down that the affairs of the colony were to be
managed in this way by the colonists, Durham proceeded to draw a
clear distinction between local and imperial matters, between
those matters which were to be committed entirely to the
colonists, and those which were to be controlled entirely by the
Imperial Parliament. Probably this division was in no small
measure due to the suspicion with which Buller and Wakefield had
long regarded the Colonial Office. If the powers of the Colonial
Legislature, and those of the Imperial Parliament, were
definitely limited in this way, there would be no room for the
Colonial Office to dictate any policy to the colonists; for, when
the subject was a local matter. Downing Street could not
interfere, and, when the subject was an imperial one, the
colonists were deprived of all control. As far as possible
internal legislation and government was left to the Colonial
Legislature, while matters which concerned the relation between
mother-country and colony were to be withdrawn from their
control. Thus there would be no "vexatious interference on the
part of the Home Government, with the enactment of laws for
regulating the internal concerns of the colony, or in the
selection of the persons entrusted with their execution."
<a name="FNanchor_9_17" id="FNanchor_9_17"></a><a href="#fn9_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Imperial matters, according to Durham,
included "the constitution of the form of government&mdash;the
regulation of foreign relations, and of trade with the
mother-country, the other British colonies, and foreign
nations&mdash;and the disposal of the public lands," <a name=
"FNanchor_9_18" id="FNanchor_9_18"></a><a href="#fn9_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> while all other matters were properly to be
treated as local.</p>
<p>One most important feature of the doctrine of responsible
government, as laid down by Lord Durham, was that it was
intended, not as a measure of separation, but as a means of
preserving and perpetuating the connection between the colonies
and the mother-country. This was characteristic of the attitude
towards colonies maintained consistently by the systematic
colonizers from the beginning.</p>
<p>In the <i>Letter from Sydney</i>, in 1829, Wakefield gave, as
a good reason for adopting his system of colonization, the fact
that it "would tend more than anything to preserve an intimate
connection between the colony and the mother-country." <a name=
"FNanchor_9_19" id="FNanchor_9_19"></a><a href="#fn9_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a> All through their efforts in founding new
colonies, and in advocating improvements in the political and
economic conditions of old colonies, the systematic colonizers
had been warm supporters of the imperial connection. Naturally,
then, they hailed with delight the uncompromising tone of
Durham's Report on this point, and praised him as the "first
British statesman to use the word 'perpetual' in speaking of the
connection between the colonies and their mother-country."
<a name="FNanchor_9_20" id="FNanchor_9_20"></a><a href="#fn9_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This attitude was all the more
remarkable because the group of Radicals, to which Durham,
Buller, and Molesworth belonged, were by no means eager to retain
the colonies. <a name="FNanchor_9_21" id=
"FNanchor_9_21"></a><a href="#fn9_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
To appreciate the strangeness of the union between the doctrine
of responsible government and the doctrine of maintaining the
colonial connection, it is only necessary to consider how the
colonial demand for responsible government had been looked upon
by British statesmen before the Durham mission. Buller
complained, in 1840, of the constant assumption made that "every
one who was favourable to the principle of responsibility in
government, must be an enemy to the British connection," <a name=
"FNanchor_9_22" id="FNanchor_9_22"></a><a href="#fn9_22" class=
"fnanchor">[22]</a> and he had very good grounds for his
complaint. The frequent debates in Parliament on Canadian
questions both before and after the Durham Report, show
conclusively that most of the leading statesmen of the day,
including Lord Melbourne, Lord Howick, and Sir George Grey, and
rising men like Stanley and W. E. Gladstone, were of opinion that
responsible government meant separation; that the claim for
responsible government was a claim for independence, and that,
once it was granted, no sort of colonial relation short of
independence could remain.</p>
<p>Lord Durham, in his report, also recommended that the
Wakefield system of colonization on its economic side, adapted to
suit the particular needs of the colonies, should be adopted in
British North America. Durham was so impressed with the merits of
this system that he had brought out Wakefield with the express
object of introducing it into Canada. <a name="FNanchor_9_23" id=
"FNanchor_9_23"></a><a href="#fn9_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Indeed, as Sir Charles Lucas justly remarks, Durham and Buller
were both Wakefield's disciples in this matter. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_24" id="FNanchor_9_24"></a><a href="#fn9_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<p>An extensive examination of the land system and emigration in
the British North American colonies was undertaken by Wakefield
and his disciple, R. D. Hanson, and an elaborate report was drawn
up by them with which Buller, although named as Commissioner of
Crown Lands and Emigration, had nothing more to do than the
signing of his name. <a name="FNanchor_9_25" id=
"FNanchor_9_25"></a><a href="#fn9_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p>According to his report, <a name="FNanchor_9_26" id=
"FNanchor_9_26"></a><a href="#fn9_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Wakefield found that a large amount of land had already been
alienated by the Crown, of which the greater portion remained
uncultivated. Also, he found that, though an extensive emigration
had been carried on, there had been a great deal of distress and
disease amongst the emigrants, while not a few of them had
re-emigrated to the United States.</p>
<p>The great extent of land appropriated, compared with what yet
remained at the disposal of the Government, prevented him from
merely applying without alteration his ordinary remedy of sale at
a sufficient price. To deal with this state of things he
recommended a land tax of 2d. per acre on all lands, with the
proviso that the tax might be paid by the proprietor in
land&mdash;namely, by surrendering to the Government appropriated
land to the value of the tax. <a name="FNanchor_9_27" id=
"FNanchor_9_27"></a><a href="#fn9_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
By this means he hoped to compel owners of uncultivated land
either to cultivate it, or to made it accessible to others who
would cultivate it.</p>
<p>For land which was not yet appropriated, and for such land as
was surrendered by the owners, he recommended that there should
be sale, at a uniform price, without restriction as to amount, or
any other conditions, so that, while every facility of selection
and acquisition would be given to those who intended to
cultivate, its acquisition by those who did not intend to
cultivate would be prevented. Since the object was not to raise
the largest possible revenue from land sales, land was to be sold
at a fixed price and not by auction. But, while he appreciated
the advantage of a sufficient price, Wakefield saw clearly that
the circumstances of the case did not allow of its introduction
into the British North American colonies. The chief of these
circumstances was the fact that land in the United States was
sold at 6s. 3d. per acre, so that, if a sufficient price much
higher than this were put on lands in the colonies, the
attraction to settlers of cheaper land over the border would be
irresistible. It was, therefore, in his opinion, impossible to
establish a price which would prevent labourers from becoming
landowners too soon. It was idle, when the price of land in the
United States was so low, "to seek, by means of a price for new
land, the more important end of securing an ample and constant
supply of labour for hire." <a name="FNanchor_9_28" id=
"FNanchor_9_28"></a><a href="#fn9_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
In these circumstances he suggested 10s. an acre as the highest
price possible if settlers were not to be induced to prefer the
United States. He frankly admitted that such a sum did not
represent a "sufficient price," but modified his doctrines to
suit local conditions. "In proposing this price, however," he
wrote, "I wish to be regarded as doing so merely as a compromise;
not because I think it best in itself, but because I think it the
best which can be obtained in the circumstances." <a name=
"FNanchor_9_29" id="FNanchor_9_29"></a><a href="#fn9_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
<p>The proceeds from the land sales and the land tax were to be
applied partly in public works, such as improving the means of
communication, and partly in the emigration of people of both
sexes.</p>
<p>Since it was necessary to establish a permanent and uniform
system of dealing with the land, and since, in his opinion,
emigration to the British North American colonies needed
regulation, he recommended that the Imperial Government should
have control of both these matters. He advised that a Central
Commission should be appointed in the United Kingdom, with
assistant Commissioners in the colonies, to control both lands
and emigration. In doing this he was only reiterating his former
opinions. <a name="FNanchor_9_30" id="FNanchor_9_30"></a><a href=
"#fn9_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. In giving evidence before
the 1836 Committee on Waste Lands, he had said, "If I made out
any case at all it was an imperial case." Now he wrote that, "the
waste lands of the colonies are the property, not merely of the
colonies, but of the Empire, and ought to be administered for
imperial, not merely for colonial purposes." But here again he
was mindful of the peculiar circumstances of the colonies with
which he was dealing, and intimated that, if the Imperial
Parliament did not choose to exercise their undoubted right of
control, the management of waste lands should be handed over to
the colonists. "While, therefore, it appears to be the duty, no
less than the right, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to
legislate upon the subject, it is equally their duty, if they
consider such an exercise of their power inexpedient, to
relinquish formally their control over this matter to the
Colonial Legislature."</p>
<p>In view of the fact that sales of land might be expected for
long to be inconsiderable, owing to the great amount of land
which had already been appropriated, he recommended that a loan
should be raised for the purposes of public works and emigration,
upon the security of the future proceeds of the land tax and land
sales.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that in these recommendations Wakefield
departed somewhat from the strict letter of his theory. In the
first place, he recommended a price which was admittedly not a
sufficient price, and, in the next place, he was willing to allow
part of the proceeds of land sales to be devoted to other
purposes than that of emigration. This may be taken to show that
he was not above looking upon his theory rather as a series of
practical rules for the better conduct of colonization, than as a
self-sufficient and complete system capable of application in all
places and at all times.</p>
<p>Wakefield's plan was adopted by Durham, and the space which he
gives in his Report to the questions of land and emigration
indicates his opinion of their importance. Durham made a very
strong declaration as to the interest which the mother-country
had in the colonization of the colonial waste lands. The lands
and resources of the colonies were, he wrote, "the ample appanage
which God and Nature have set aside in the New World for those
whose lot has assigned them but insufficient portions in the
old." <a name="FNanchor_9_31" id="FNanchor_9_31"></a><a href=
"#fn9_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He also avowed his complete
faith in Wakefield's plan when he wrote that it was "more
calculated than any other reform whatever to attach the people of
British North America to Your Majesty's Throne, and to cement and
perpetuate an intimate connection between the colonies and the
mother-country." <a name="FNanchor_9_32" id=
"FNanchor_9_32"></a><a href="#fn9_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>Durham's Report, with its doctrine of responsible government,
was not well received in England. Few shared his great conception
of the colonies as self-governing in a true sense, and yet bound
by that very fact closer to the mother-country. To most of those
who thought of the colonies, and particularly of the Canadas, at
that time, responsible government meant separation. They could
not see that there was any midway for a colony between
dependence, as they understood it without responsible government,
and complete independence. Lord John Russell had said, in 1837,
of the demand for responsible government: "It is proposed . . .
that the Executive Council should be made to resemble the
ministry in this country. I hold this proposition to be entirely
incompatible with the relations between the mother-country and
the colony . . . . That part of the Constitution which requires
that the Ministers of the Crown shall be responsible to
Parliament, and shall be removable if they do not obtain the
confidence of Parliament, is a condition which exists in an
imperial legislature, and in an imperial legislature only. It is
a condition which cannot be carried into effect in a
colony&mdash;it is a condition which can only exist in one place,
namely, the seat of empire." <a name="FNanchor_9_33" id=
"FNanchor_9_33"></a><a href="#fn9_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
This he repeated, in 1838, in the debates on the suspension of
the Constitution of Lower Canada, <a name="FNanchor_9_34" id=
"FNanchor_9_34"></a><a href="#fn9_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and again, in 1839, after the presentation of the Durham Report,
when discussing plans for the permanent settlement of the affairs
of Canada. <a name="FNanchor_9_35" id=
"FNanchor_9_35"></a><a href="#fn9_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Indeed, it may be taken as representing the attitude of the
majority of English statesmen of the day on the question of
responsible government. <a name="FNanchor_9_36" id=
"FNanchor_9_36"></a><a href="#fn9_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
This opinion was not confined to members of Parliament. The
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, in dealing with "this new, and to us,
incomprehensible system of colonial <i>connection</i>: the
<i>Report</i> calls it <i>connection</i>&mdash;to our
understanding it is absolute <i>separation</i>," wrote, that the
authors of the Report made the fundamental error "that they
forget, or choose to forget, that Canada is a
<i>province</i>&mdash;a colony." <a name="FNanchor_9_37" id=
"FNanchor_9_37"></a><a href="#fn9_37" class=
"fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<p>One difficulty, which then seemed to English statesmen
insuperable under a system of responsible government, was that
the governor of a colony would have to act under a double
responsibility, to the Home Government, and to the representative
body of the colony, which would give many opportunities for
conflict. <a name="FNanchor_9_38" id="FNanchor_9_38"></a><a href=
"#fn9_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the new doctrine was welcomed by a few
thoughtful men, and, since the former method of governing Canada
had been a failure, opinion began to veer round to the view that
the new proposal should be given a trial. <a name="FNanchor_9_39"
id="FNanchor_9_39"></a><a href="#fn9_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> Charles Buller, on his return from Canada,
spoke convincingly with first-hand knowledge of the evils of
colonial government and their remedies. On Durham's death, in
1840, he became the spokesman in Parliament for the Report, and
the chief advocate of the doctrine of responsible government
which he recognized as its most important feature, and for which
he gave credit to Lord Durham as the originator. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_40" id="FNanchor_9_40"></a><a href="#fn9_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a> The radical vice of colonial government which
needed correction, the fundamental error which had to be
rectified, was, according to his view, that the colonists lacked
control over their internal affairs. <a name="FNanchor_9_41" id=
"FNanchor_9_41"></a><a href="#fn9_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
He adopted and maintained consistently the view that the only
method of making representative institutions work harmoniously
was to have an Executive possessing the confidence of the
representative body. <a name="FNanchor_9_42" id=
"FNanchor_9_42"></a><a href="#fn9_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
To him it seemed "the plain common-sense truth, that if they
wished to govern any colony peaceably, they must govern it on
principles and by men approved of by the people of the colony,
and that otherwise the colony would be a scene of interminable
confusion and anarchy, such as had followed every attempt to work
representation without a responsible Executive." <a name=
"FNanchor_9_43" id="FNanchor_9_43"></a><a href="#fn9_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a> Admitting that the granting of responsible
government would be a complete change in British colonial policy,
he could not understand how anyone, in the light of recent
colonial history, could propose to withhold it. At the same time
he was at great pains to insist on the value of the connection
with the colonies, and to prove that it would be strengthened and
not weakened by the grant of responsible government. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_44" id="FNanchor_9_44"></a><a href="#fn9_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a> Even in the face of opposition he was bold
enough to predict the ultimate triumph of the new doctrine. The
Durham Report, he told the House of Commons, in 1839, in a vein
of prophecy, "would be the text-book of the colonial reformer,
until it became the manual of the colonial government of Great
Britain." <a name="FNanchor_9_45" id="FNanchor_9_45"></a><a href=
"#fn9_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In spite of Buller's
eloquence the Ministry was firmly determined not to admit the
wisdom of granting responsible government to the Canadas. In
moving for leave to introduce a Bill for the government of Canada
in 1840, Lord John Russell pronounced against responsible
government, and suggested, in its stead, that measures might be
taken to make the Executive more in accord with popular feeling
by including in it the leaders of the majority of the Assembly.
<a name="FNanchor_9_46" id="FNanchor_9_46"></a><a href="#fn9_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This may account for the inconsistency
which occurs in Russell's despatch of October 14th, 1839, to
Poulett Thomson, the newly-appointed Governor-General of Canada.
There, while objecting to the principle of responsible
government, he could see little or no objection "to the practical
views of colonial government recommended by Lord Durham, as I
understand them." <a name="FNanchor_9_47" id=
"FNanchor_9_47"></a><a href="#fn9_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
By this he probably meant, although Durham's views could hardly
be misunderstood, that he was willing that the Executive should
be, as far as possible, in accord with the majority of the
Assembly, but would not go to the length of giving the Assembly
full control over the Executive. His later despatch, however, of
October 16th, 1839, <a name="FNanchor_9_48" id=
"FNanchor_9_48"></a><a href="#fn9_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
to the effect that certain Executive officers were to be liable
to be changed by the governor from motives of public policy, was
a step in the direction of responsible government; and the final
step, though delayed for some time, was taken in 1848, under the
wise guidance of Lord Elgin, Durham's son-in-law and pupil.</p>
<p>In the next few years after the publication of the Durham
Report, Buller and Wakefield helped to influence public opinion
by expounding their views on responsible government&mdash;Buller
in a series of articles in the <i>Colonial Gazette</i>,
1839-1840, afterwards reprinted in 1840 under the title of
<i>Responsible Government for Colonies</i>, Wakefield in an
article in <i>Fisher's Colonial Magazine</i> for 1844, entitled,
"Sir Charles Metcalfe in Canada." Buller's book, written in a
bright and popular manner, and containing the famous attacks on
Mr. Mothercountry of the Colonial Office, was designed partly to
explain and defend Durham's principle of responsible government,
and partly to lay it down as a broad principle of colonial
government. He developed the thesis that the grant of
representative institutions carried with it as a necessary
corollary the grant of responsible government. The object of
granting representation, he urged, was to give the colonists
control over their own affairs, to enable them to have a
government "constantly agreeable" to their wishes. This object
could only be achieved when the Assembly controlled the
Executive. He maintained, too, that the grant of responsible
government would strengthen, not weaken, the colonial connection,
and would remove causes of frequent collision which arose under
the existing system.</p>
<p>Wakefield's article, longer but not so well known, is an essay
of extraordinary insight. It develops a powerful argument for
responsible government based on an analysis of the British
constitution and an examination of the history of the Canadas.
Like Buller, he was careful to show that the demand for
responsible government was not a demand for separation; but that
it was at once the only way of placing colonial administration of
local affairs on a satisfactory footing, and of retaining the
relation between the mother-country and the colony. Wakefield,
who, as unofficial adviser to Sir Charles Metcalfe, had been in
the thick of the difficulties with which that governor had to
deal in Canada, laid stress, too, on the practical questions of
responsible government, such as the position of the governor,
which counted for so much in the working of the system.</p>
<p>Thus, from the systematic colonizers came three expositions of
this doctrine of colonial government, Durham's official
recommendation in regard to Canada, Buller's advocacy of it as a
general colonial policy, and Wakefield's re-statement of the case
from the point of view of actual conditions in the colony and its
practical working there. In each the same three notes are struck,
colonial control of local matters, maintenance of the colonial
connection, and separation between Imperial and local
matters.</p>
<p>But when responsible government was granted, this latter
distinction was not adopted. The colonial reformers in 1850, in
discussing the proposed grant of responsible government to the
Australian colonies, once more attempted to exclude the Colonial
Office in this way, but they, too, were unsuccessful. <a name=
"FNanchor_9_49" id="FNanchor_9_49"></a><a href="#fn9_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a> The extent of the powers of the colonial
legislatures was not clearly marked out; but it was wisely, as
the event proved, left to the good sense of the colonists, to the
tact of the governor, and to the discretion of the Colonial
Office, to ensure that the colonial legislature did not overstep
its proper bounds. Probably any clear-cut distinction between
Imperial and local matters would have been productive of more
disputes than the system adopted, whose very elasticity was its
strength.</p>
<p>There was never any serious attempt to introduce into Canada
Wakefield's proposals as to land and emigration. The influence of
the past history of the British North American colonies was too
strong to allow of the introduction of a uniform system for
disposing of land. Moreover, it was found practically impossible
to withhold from these colonies the control of their lands when
responsible government was granted. <a name="FNanchor_9_50" id=
"FNanchor_9_50"></a><a href="#fn9_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
In regard to emigration, too, it was felt that there was no
necessity to use the land fund for this purpose, or, indeed, to
do more than to regulate the stream of emigrants to Canada,
because its proximity to Great Britain was of itself sufficient
attraction. This, it will be remembered, was the view taken by
the Emigration Commissioners of 1831, <a name="FNanchor_9_51" id=
"FNanchor_9_51"></a><a href="#fn9_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and it triumphed against Wakefield's proposal of a state-aided as
well as a state-controlled emigration.</p>
<p>It was not only as a policy applicable at the moment to one
set of colonies that responsible government was advocated by
Buller and his associates. As well as being a remedy for the
state of Canada, it was a policy which might be extended to other
colonies, provided that they were homogeneous in character, and
had arrived at a certain stage of growth. <a name="FNanchor_9_52"
id="FNanchor_9_52"></a><a href="#fn9_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> They proposed that it should not only be a
measure to meet the particular exigencies of the Canadian case,
but that it should be "a rule of government, that the Executive
of the colony should be kept in entire harmony with the
legislature." <a name="FNanchor_9_53" id=
"FNanchor_9_53"></a><a href="#fn9_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The Durham Report is, indeed, as Sir Charles Lucas has pointed
out, very much more than a "charter of self-government." But
popular opinion has rightly seized upon this as its most
important aspect. While the Report is interesting as showing
Durham's attempt to settle a long standing controversy of races,
his prescience as to the effect of the development of means of
communication, <a name="FNanchor_9_54" id=
"FNanchor_9_54"></a><a href="#fn9_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and his combination of Imperialism with democracy, its abiding
importance is that it laid down a doctrine which soon became a
general colonial policy. After a comparatively short space of
time, there came to be an agreement amongst English statesmen
that colonies of a homogeneous character should, at a certain
stage of their existence, be granted responsible government, and
the only question about which disputes ranged was whether a
colony had or had not reached this stage. How completely this
doctrine had won the day may be seen from the fact that, in 1847,
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was perplexed to know why it was ever
thought necessary to send Lord Durham to Canada to discover the
obvious truth that colonies could be well governed in no other
way. <a name="FNanchor_9_55" id="FNanchor_9_55"></a><a href=

<p><a name="fn9_16" id="fn9_16"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_9_16">16</a> In one passage, it is true, he used words
which seem to show that his conception of responsible government
was not always clear. He wrote that the citizens of the United
States possessed "a perfectly free and eminently responsible
government," Lucas, Vol. ii, p. 261, but by this he probably
meant a government responsible to the people. Wakefield, too, in
his pamphlet of 1844, <i>A View of Sir Charles Metcalfe's
Government in Canada</i>, seems to have leaned to the view that
the relations of a Colonial Governor to his Ministers resembled
those of a Premier to his colleagues in a Cabinet. See also
<i>Colonial Gazette</i>, June 29th, and October 5th, 1844. In the
same year, however, in his article in <i>Fisher's Colonial
Magazine</i> for July, 1844, entitled <i>Sir Charles Metcalfe in
Canada</i>, he took the true line that a Colonial Governor had a
dual function to perform, as the officer responsible to the
Imperial Government, and as the constitutional ruler of a colony,
governing by the advice of his Executive Council chosen and
controlled by the colonial legislature. Of the three Charles
Buller, perhaps, had the clearest conception of what was meant by
responsible government, viz., colonial government modelled as far
as possible on the British system, with the Governor filling, as
far as circumstances would allow, the position of a
constitutional monarch. See his <i>Responsible Government for
Colonies</i>, 1840.</p>

practical grievances of the province none was more palpable, and

the Crown Lands. One of Lord Durham's first objects in his
mission was to lay the foundations of such a reform in the
administration of them as might render them instrumental in
promoting that influx of colonists which was requisite for the
accomplishment of his great schemes for the improvement of the
colonies. With this end in view he had engaged Mr. Wakefield to
come from England about the time of our own departure, having for

into all his views of colonies and emigration." <i>Sketch of Lord

some undeserved eulogium which he had received, on the
supposition that he was concerned in drawing it up. He had
nothing to do with it, except signing his name. The merit of this
very valuable report was due to Mr. Hanson and Mr. Wakefield."

<h3>LATER EXPERIMENTS IN SYSTEMATIC COLONIZATION, 1837-1842</h3>
<p><span class="a">One</span> of the first subjects which
attracted the attention of the systematic colonizers in 1837, was
the abolition of transportation to the Australian colonies.</p>
<p>From the time when free emigrants were allowed to settle in
the penal colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, it
was inevitable that this question would one day become acute.
Opposition was bound to develop between the different points of
view of the mother-country and the colonists. Two motives seem to
have actuated the mother-country in the encouragement of the
system; one, a wish to remove permanently to as great a distance
as possible a class of people not wanted at home; the other, a
real desire to give the convict an opportunity to become under
new conditions a respectable and useful colonist. From the point
of view of the free settlers in a penal colony which received
these criminals and had to take the risk of the doubtful
experiment of reformation, transportation was an evil,
counterbalanced only by the fact that it provided a supply of
labour not otherwise to be obtained, and occasioned a large and
welcome Government expenditure. For this reason, while the
practice existed of assigning convicts as labourers to the free
settlers, there was not a great deal of complaint from the penal
colonies. Indeed, the original impulse to the movement for the
abolition of transportation came, not from the colonies, but from
the mother-country. The humanitarian feeling which had caused the
abolition of slavery in 1833 was still strong, and a group of
men, chief amongst whom was Archbishop Whately, had for some time
been agitating the question. In the forefront of this agitation
were to be found the systematic colonizers. There was never any
doubt as to their attitude on this point. They had ever been the
opponents of the system of transportation, and had condemned it
on three main grounds. In the first place, it had a bad effect on
the penal colonies in that it was responsible for the
disproportion between the sexes, for the extraordinary amount of
crime, and for the demoralization which necessarily attended the
constant outpouring of a stream of criminals into a small
community. In the next place, admitting its value as a means of
providing labour, it prevented the prosperity of these colonies
by causing a natural repugnance amongst free emigrants to settle
there. In the third place, transportation made it impossible for
the mother-country to grant any full measure of free institutions
to a colony whose population was largely made up of convicts and
ex-convicts. Only when transportation had ceased could these
colonies be made fit for self-government. <a name="FNanchor_10_1"
id="FNanchor_10_1"></a><a href="#fn10_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p>One special advantage which they claimed for the system of
land sales and emigration in Australia, was that it would help to
swamp the convict element, and at the same time would provide the
necessary labour when the assignment of convicts ceased.</p>
<p>Led in this instance by Sir William Molesworth, the systematic
colonizers were successful in obtaining an exceptionally strong
Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1837, <a name=
"FNanchor_10_2" id="FNanchor_10_2"></a><a href="#fn10_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> "to inquire into the system of transportation;
its efficacy as a punishment, its influence on the moral state of
society in the penal colonies, and how far it is susceptible of
improvement." The Committee included Molesworth (Chairman), Lord
John Russell, Sir George Grey, J. T. Leader, H. G. Ward, Lord
Howick, Fowell Buxton, Francis Baring, Sir Robert Peel, and
Charles Buller. They heard evidence in 1837 and 1838 from a
number of witnesses, including Sir Francis Forbes, Chief Justice
of New South Wales; Colonel Arthur, Lieutenant-Governor of Van
Diemen's Land; surgeons who had had charge of convict ships;
convict chaplains; and many respectable settlers in the penal
colonies. Their Report, presented in August, 1838, <a name=
"FNanchor_10_3" id="FNanchor_10_3"></a><a href="#fn10_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> was a sweeping condemnation of transportation
as a means either of punishment or of reform. They pronounced it
to be inefficient as a punishment because of its uncertainty, and
to be a method of demoralizing, not of reforming the convicts.
Transportation, as carried on in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, corrupted convict and colonist alike, and discredited
emigration "by associating it with the idea of degradation and
punishment." They recommended that assignment should cease
altogether; that transportation to New South Wales and to the
settled parts of Van Diemen's Land should be discontinued; and
that in its stead a system of penitentiaries should be
established where, as at Norfolk Island, there were no free
settlers. To meet the increased demand for labour which would
result from these measures, they recommended that the price of
land in these colonies should be raised to £1 per acre, in order
to prevent labourers from becoming landowners too soon, and that
the proceeds should be used in emigration.</p>
<p>Wakefield did not appear before the Committee, but there is no
doubt that he played his part in obtaining the Committee, and in
collecting information and evidence to overthrow the system.
<a name="FNanchor_10_4" id="FNanchor_10_4"></a><a href="#fn10_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When he received his copy of the Report
he wrote to Molesworth that the "unclean thing" had got its
death-warrant. <a name="FNanchor_10_5" id=
"FNanchor_10_5"></a><a href="#fn10_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Mr. Samuel Sidney, a strong opponent of Wakefield, accused him of
having manufactured a case for the Committee. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_6" id="FNanchor_10_6"></a><a href="#fn10_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> Indeed, the colonists of New South Wales
protested vigorously against some of the evidence given as to the
state of the colony. <a name="FNanchor_10_7" id=
"FNanchor_10_7"></a><a href="#fn10_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Whether the evidence was highly coloured or not, it brought to
light such a mass of unsavoury information that the death-knell
of transportation was sounded.</p>
<p>During the course of the inquiry, Governor Bourke, in
accordance with Glenelg's instructions, had warned the colonists
of New South Wales that the system of assignment was about to be
discontinued, and that, for the future, they would have to look
to free emigration to provide them with labour. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_8" id="FNanchor_10_8"></a><a href="#fn10_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> After the report assignment was gradually
abolished, <a name="FNanchor_10_9" id=
"FNanchor_10_9"></a><a href="#fn10_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and ceased altogether in 1841. <a name="FNanchor_10_10" id=
"FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#fn10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
By an Order in Council of August 22nd, 1840, New South Wales was
excluded from the list of places to which convicts might be sent.
Thus, the system of transportation to that colony ended without
regret on the part of the colonists, who immediately received a
rapid increase of free emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_11" id=
"FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#fn10_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p>Transportation to Van Diemen's Land and to Norfolk Island did
not cease for some years, and there was a keen fight to be waged
with the Home Government before it ended finally; but after 1838
the impulse came from the colonists themselves. While the system
of transportation was in vogue, and the colonists had the use of
convict labour, they could not with justice complain of the evil
which accompanied the good. When, however, assignment was
abolished, all the advantage of transportation had gone; <a name=
"FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#fn10_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the colonists turned strongly
against the system. They took up the position that the country
which produced the criminals should take charge of them herself;
and, in the end, they won the day.</p>
<p>During this period the systematic colonizers made one more
attempt to realize their theory in a new colony which might
profit by the experience of South Australia, and where the
experiment might be conducted free from the dominance of the
Colonial Office and the errors of former land regulations. They
now chose as the scene of their operations New Zealand, the story
of whose founding as a British colony has been so often told that
it is hardly necessary here to enter into any detail except as to
the part played by the systematic colonizers. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_13" id="FNanchor_10_13"></a><a href="#fn10_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a> One unsuccessful attempt at an
organized settlement there had been made in 1826 by a colonizing
company supported by Lord Durham; but for the most part
emigration to New Zealand had been haphazard, and consisted
mainly of traders, whalers, runaway convicts, and others whose
presence was a source of contamination to the natives. English
missionaries had arrived there in 1814, and by 1837, when the
project for the systematic colonization of New Zealand was taken
up by Wakefield and his followers, they had successfully
established themselves, and possessed great influence with the
natives. The aim of the principal missionary body, the Church
Missionary Society, was to preserve New Zealand as a field for
their labours, and to prevent the evils which had everywhere
arisen when settlers had come in contact with the natives. With
this end in view they became the chief opponents of the
systematic colonization of New Zealand, and refused to co-operate
with Wakefield in his schemes. But, as Wakefield had truly told
the Waste Lands Committee of 1836, the colonization of New
Zealand was proceeding, and would continue to proceed, though "in
a most slovenly, and scrambling, and disgraceful manner," despite
all the efforts of the missionaries. <a name="FNanchor_10_14" id=
"FNanchor_10_14"></a><a href="#fn10_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
In 1837 the question was whether its colonization should be
systematic and orderly, with due consideration of the interests
of the natives, or unsystematic and disorderly, under the control
neither of the missionaries nor of any organized government.</p>
<p>In <i>England and America</i> (1833) Wakefield had expressed
his opinion that New Zealand was "admirably fit for
colonization"; <a name="FNanchor_10_15" id=
"FNanchor_10_15"></a><a href="#fn10_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and, when the Waste Lands Committee had reported, and he had
dissociated himself from the South Australian scheme, he set to
work to found a new Association to carry out his plans in regard
to New Zealand. In contrast to his earliest project for founding
South Australia he now proposed a public association to found and
govern the new colony, whose members were to have no pecuniary
interest in the undertaking. In 1837 the New Zealand Association
was formed, consisting of two classes of members, intending
settlers, and those who were willing to found and govern the
colony. One of his chief assistants in this task was Mr. Francis
Baring, who had fallen under the spell of Wakefield while serving
on the Waste Lands Committee of 1836. Lord Durham, too, on his
return from Russia, once more interested himself in New Zealand
and joined the Association, becoming its chief spokesman in the
encounters with the Colonial Office. The Association proposed
that an Act of Parliament should be passed, granting them powers
of sovereignty for a limited period over a portion of New
Zealand, and allowing them to purchase land from the natives and
re-sell it to settlers. The proceeds of the land-sales were to be
used, partly in further purchases from the natives, and partly in
emigration. The government of the colony was, for a definite
period, to rest in the Association. <a name="FNanchor_10_16" id=
"FNanchor_10_16"></a><a href="#fn10_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p>On their approach to the Colonial Office asking for sanction
to this scheme, they met at once with the strong opposition of
the missionary bodies. In 1836-7, while the Committee on Waste
Lands was recommending the extension of the Wakefield system, a
Select Committee on aborigines sat, and, under the influence of
the missionary bodies, reported adversely on the policy of
granting the lands of natives to white settlers without the
owners' consent, and strongly in favour of protecting and
safeguarding the rights of aboriginal races who came in contact
with British colonists. In regard to New Zealand the Committee
suggested that its independence might be respected, and schemes
for its colonization might be discouraged. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_17" id="FNanchor_10_17"></a><a href="#fn10_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> At that time, too, the chiefs of the
Colonial Office&mdash;Lord Glenelg, Sir George Grey, and James
Stephen&mdash;were all officials of the Church Missionary
Society, so that Wakefield's scheme was at once condemned as
inimical to the interests of the natives. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_18" id="FNanchor_10_18"></a><a href="#fn10_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Mr. Dandeson Coates, too, the secretary
of the Church Missionary Society, vigorously denounced the
project in two pamphlets, <a name="FNanchor_10_19" id=
"FNanchor_10_19"></a><a href="#fn10_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
one of which drew a reply from Wakefield. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_20" id="FNanchor_10_20"></a><a href="#fn10_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The Bill was somewhat modified, and
again submitted to the Colonial Office in November, 1837. Then
the preliminary objection was taken that Britain had no right,
legal or moral, to establish a colony in New Zealand without the
free consent of the inhabitants. A further objection was that the
actual method of colonization, if its expediency were decided on,
should be by the authority of a Royal Charter and not by an Act
of Parliament. <a name="FNanchor_10_21" id=
"FNanchor_10_21"></a><a href="#fn10_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Very soon afterwards, however, in view of further information
from New Zealand, the Colonial Office yielded on the question of
the expediency of colonizing that country, and agreed that it was
necessary, while protecting the interests of the aborigines, to
establish there some settled form of government. "The only
question, therefore," wrote Glenelg to Durham, "is between a
colonization desultory, without law, and fatal to the natives,
and a colonization organized and salutary. Her Majesty's
Government are therefore disposed to entertain the proposal of
establishing such a colony." <a name="FNanchor_10_22" id=
"FNanchor_10_22"></a><a href="#fn10_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
He proposed that the Association should receive by Royal Charter
complete power of government, and that the principles of land
sales at auction and assisted emigration should by the same
authority be established in the colony. Apparently the Home
Government was about to work hand in hand with the systematic
colonizers, but Glenelg's last condition proved a stumbling
block. Before the Association could exercise any authority under
the charter, Glenelg demanded that it should become a joint-stock
body with a certain amount of paid-up capital. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_23" id="FNanchor_10_23"></a><a href="#fn10_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The Church Missionary Society at once
protested against the offer of a charter even on these terms,
<a name="FNanchor_10_24" id="FNanchor_10_24"></a><a href=
"#fn10_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and an impression which got
abroad that Wakefield was aiming at the position of governor of
New Zealand did not make the missionary bodies view the scheme in
a more favourable light. <a name="FNanchor_10_25" id=
"FNanchor_10_25"></a><a href="#fn10_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p>The New Zealand Association had been established as a
voluntary body with no pecuniary interest in colonization; and
they stoutly protested against the condition that they should
become a joint-stock company. <a name="FNanchor_10_26" id=
"FNanchor_10_26"></a><a href="#fn10_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
The Government equally firmly insisted on the condition; and,
after further correspondence and negotiation, the Association, in
1838, decided to introduce into Parliament a Bill to give effect
to their scheme. The Government, while refusing support,
indicated that they would not oppose the Bill. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_27" id="FNanchor_10_27"></a><a href="#fn10_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In the House of Commons, however, Lord
Howick and Sir George Grey, both members of the Government,
voiced the official objections, and the Bill was rejected on its
second reading by 92 votes to 32. <a name="FNanchor_10_28" id=
"FNanchor_10_28"></a><a href="#fn10_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Further negotiations ensued, and the Association dissolved, to
reappear as a joint-stock company, called the New Zealand
Colonization Company. Now they found the Government unwilling to
proceed on the ground that the promise of a charter had been made
to a differently composed body. <a name="FNanchor_10_29" id=
"FNanchor_10_29"></a><a href="#fn10_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Finally, in 1839, the New Zealand Land Company, an amalgamation
of the company of 1825, the New Zealand Association, and the
Colonization Company, decided to commence the colonization of New
Zealand without waiting for the sanction of the Government. The
ship Tory was sent with a preliminary expeditionary party to
purchase land from the natives, and a further body of emigrants
was prepared to set sail soon afterwards. This unauthorized act
forced the Government to take measures to control the
colonization of New Zealand, and in the same year this colony was
included within the jurisdiction of New South Wales. Captain
Hobson was sent out as lieutenant-governor, with instructions to
treat with the natives for the recognition of the British
sovereignty over New Zealand. The land system of New South Wales,
sale by auction and assisted emigration, was to be established
there when lands had been bought from the natives. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_30" id="FNanchor_10_30"></a><a href="#fn10_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Hobson succeeded in arranging the
famous treaty of Waitangi with the natives, and in consequence
proclaimed, in 1840, British sovereignty just in time to prevent
any claim of France to the Middle Island.</p>
<p>By 1840, then. New Zealand had become a colony of Great
Britain, and by the Waste Lands Act of 1842, <a name=
"FNanchor_10_31" id="FNanchor_10_31"></a><a href="#fn10_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the system of land-sales and assisted
emigration became established there as in all other parts of the
Australasian colonies. The vicissitudes of the New Zealand
Company, which received its charter in 1841, quarrelled with the
Home Government, the Colonial Government and the natives as to
the extent and validity of its land-purchases, did much to
promote effective settlement, and ended its chequered career in
1851, cannot be followed here. Its original object as a
colonizing company, with philanthropic and humanitarian aims, was
lost sight of when it became a joint-stock company, and its
varying fortunes, however interesting in themselves, had not much
direct bearing on the application of the Wakefield system in New
Zealand. The founding of this new colony, however, illustrates
how far the day had been won by the practical part of that system
which meant the colonization of waste lands by their sale and the
use of the proceeds in assisted emigration.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps arrived in New South Wales in February, 1838,
to take the place of Governor Bourke. <a name="FNanchor_10_32"
id="FNanchor_10_32"></a><a href="#fn10_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a> He had been a Commissioner to Canada with
Lord Gosford and Sir Charles Grey in 1835; he was a man of strong
personality, who for several years was to dominate the land
policy of New South Wales, and to wage a successful war against
the attempts of the Colonial Office to move along the path of the
Wakefield theory.</p>
<p>When the Ripon regulations were introduced into New South
Wales in 1831, the governor was informed that there was nothing
to prevent him from imposing a higher minimum price if he chose.
<a name="FNanchor_10_33" id="FNanchor_10_33"></a><a href=
"#fn10_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The South Australian
Commissioners, in their first report of 1836, had complained of
the low price of land at Port Phillip compared with the uniform
price of 12s. in South Australia. They had also applied to the
Home Government to raise the price at Port Phillip; but the reply
was that they had knowingly run the risk of planting a new colony
near a settlement where the price of land had, as early as 1831,
been fixed at a minimum of 5s. an acre. <a name="FNanchor_10_34"
id="FNanchor_10_34"></a><a href="#fn10_34" class=
"fnanchor">[34]</a> In 1837, however. Lord Glenelg suggested to
Bourke that it might be wise to raise the minimum price; but
Bourke had thought that it was sufficiently high already,
<a name="FNanchor_10_35" id="FNanchor_10_35"></a><a href=
"#fn10_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> so that when Gipps arrived
land was being sold by auction at a minimum price of 5s. per
acre, both in the old settled districts of New South Wales and at
the new settlement of Port Phillip. The apparent success of South
Australia in selling land at 12s. per acre, and the
recommendations of the two Committees on Waste Lands in 1836, and
on Transportation in 1838, convinced the Home Government that
they should increase the minimum price in some of the other
Australian colonies. Accordingly Lord Glenelg, in 1838,
instructed Gipps to raise the price from 5s. to 12s. per acre. It
is interesting to notice the reasons which he advanced for the
change. The great extent of land sold in New South Wales since
1831, when taken together with the increasing demand there for
labour, showed, he considered, an undue dispersion of the
colonists, which it was the purpose of the 1831 regulations to
prevent. The rise in price then was merely an attempt to give
full effect to the principle laid down by Lord Ripon. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_36" id="FNanchor_10_36"></a><a href="#fn10_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p>It will be seen from this and from other examples during this
period that Wakefield's theory had so permeated even the official
mind that his ideas had become part of the assumptions, and his
formulæ part even of the vocabulary of Government despatches.
Indeed all who thought or wrote at this time of British
colonization did so in terms of the Wakefield theory, whether
their attitude was friendly or hostile.</p>
<p>In the same year the price of land was raised to 12s. in Van
Diemen's Land, but, for the time, it remained at 5s. in Western
Australia.</p>
<p>Immediately on receipt of these instructions in 1839, Gipps
notified the colonists of New South Wales that the alteration
would take effect at once at all future sales, but, finding that
the governor of Van Diemen's Land considered that the
instructions did not refer to land already advertised at a lower
price, he assimilated the practice in New South Wales to that of
Van Diemen's Land. <a name="FNanchor_10_37" id=
"FNanchor_10_37"></a><a href="#fn10_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
This reading of the instructions was important, because it meant
that in New South Wales no less than 300,000 acres had to be sold
at the lower price before the change could take effect. The
increase in price was not popular in New South Wales; <a name=
"FNanchor_10_38" id="FNanchor_10_38"></a><a href="#fn10_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> for the colonists considered that 12s.
per acre was too high as a minimum, and that it prevented the
sale of land. <a name="FNanchor_10_39" id=
"FNanchor_10_39"></a><a href="#fn10_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p>In the same year, another important step was taken by Gipps,
on his own initiative, to make the position of the squatters more
regular. These colonists, and their shepherds and stockmen, had
come violently into conflict with the aborigines; <a name=
"FNanchor_10_40" id="FNanchor_10_40"></a><a href="#fn10_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Gipps found it necessary to
establish a police force outside the limits of location, and to
make the squatters pay for their own protection. Accordingly,
with the approval of the squatting interest, an Act was passed in
1839, <a name="FNanchor_10_41" id="FNanchor_10_41"></a><a href=
"#fn10_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which continued Bourke's
system of pastoral licences, and, at the same time, imposed a tax
on the stock grazed on the runs held under licence. The country
outside the boundaries of location was, by a proclamation of May
21st, 1839, <a name="FNanchor_10_42" id=
"FNanchor_10_42"></a><a href="#fn10_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
divided into nine squatting districts; <a name="FNanchor_10_43"
id="FNanchor_10_43"></a><a href="#fn10_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a> and for each one a commissioner and a body of
police (called the Border Police) was provided, whose expenses
were met out of the proceeds of the licences and the stock
tax.</p>
<p>The next change in the land regulations of New South Wales was
a further instalment of the Wakefield system. Lord John Russell,
in appointing the Colonial Land and Emigration Board in January,
1840, indicated a preference for the sale of lands at a uniform
price instead of by auction; but, recognizing that the change
would be difficult, he instructed the commissioners to
investigate and report on the comparative advantages of the two
systems. <a name="FNanchor_10_44" id=
"FNanchor_10_44"></a><a href="#fn10_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
They very soon reported in favour of the uniform price, on the
grounds that under auction the buyer had to wait until the land
was advertised and put up for sale; and that even then he might
be disappointed by being outbid. Under a uniform price this delay
and uncertainty would, they considered, disappear, because a
settler would only have to select his land and pay down his
money. Moreover, by the latter system only the best soils would
be first selected, and it would be easier to sell land in
England. <a name="FNanchor_10_45" id=
"FNanchor_10_45"></a><a href="#fn10_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
They therefore recommended that, for the future, land should be
sold in the new settlements of New South Wales at a uniform
price; but that the well-established system of auction in the
settled districts should not be suddenly changed. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_46" id="FNanchor_10_46"></a><a href="#fn10_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In spite of Gipps' opinion, written
soon after his arrival in the colony, that nothing was so
essential to its prosperity as the sale of lands by auction,
<a name="FNanchor_10_47" id="FNanchor_10_47"></a><a href=
"#fn10_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the commissioners
recommended that a uniform price of £1 per acre, which they
considered had answered well in South Australia, should be
imposed on all lands sold in New South Wales outside the nineteen
settled counties, with the exception of land in already
established towns which it was still desirable to sell by
auction. <a name="FNanchor_10_48" id=
"FNanchor_10_48"></a><a href="#fn10_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Lord John Russell adopted their reasoning, and, in a despatch of
May 31st, 1840, he suggested that the colony of New South Wales
should be divided into a middle district, comprising the nineteen
old counties, a southern district, including the Port Phillip
settlement, and a northern district, including the territory near
Moreton Bay. He instructed Gipps to sell lands in the southern
district at a uniform fixed price of £1 per acre, except lands in
new towns where the price was to be £100 per acre. The system of
auction was allowed to remain for town allotments in the
established towns of Port Phillip, and for the whole of the
middle district; but he indicated that, when the northern
district was opened for settlement, the regulations as to Port
Phillip would apply there. <a name="FNanchor_10_49" id=
"FNanchor_10_49"></a><a href="#fn10_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
A few months later, the commissioners, with the approval of the
Colonial Office, drew up regulations for the sale of lands in New
South Wales embodying these changes, and, at the same time,
introducing a system of special surveys. Anyone who should pay at
once, either in England or in the colony, for eight square miles
of land in New South Wales at the uniform price of £1 per acre,
was entitled to demand a survey of that quantity in one block in
any part of the colony which he might choose. Their reason for
the introduction of this system was that it would both encourage
enterprise and enhance the land revenue. <a name="FNanchor_10_50"
id="FNanchor_10_50"></a><a href="#fn10_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
<p>These changes, however, found a very strong opponent in Sir
George Gipps, who, disposed by nature to uphold his own views
strongly even against his official superiors, had by this time
become well acquainted with local conditions in New South Wales.
Assuming that one of the objects of a uniform price was to secure
to a new settler land without competition and without delay, he
was very strongly of the opinion that it would merely lead to a
"scramble for land" on the part of wealthy speculators, who would
buy up the good land to re-sell it at competitive prices.
<a name="FNanchor_10_51" id="FNanchor_10_51"></a><a href=
"#fn10_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He quarrelled completely
with the doctrine of preventing dispersion by means of a high
price, which he took to be the chief feature of the South
Australian system. He insisted that, since Australia was
primarily a pastoral country, dispersion could not be prevented,
and was indeed to be encouraged. "As well might it be attempted
to confine the Arabs of the desert within a circle traced upon
their sands," he wrote in 1840, "as to confine the graziers or
wool-growers of New South Wales within any bounds that can
possibly be assigned to them." <a name="FNanchor_10_52" id=
"FNanchor_10_52"></a><a href="#fn10_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Wakefield's doctrine of a sufficient price did not in any way
appeal to him. "The only sufficient price of any commodity,
formerly used to be considered that which it would sell for, when
judiciously brought to market." <a name="FNanchor_10_53" id=
"FNanchor_10_53"></a><a href="#fn10_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
This is, indeed, the keynote of his policy. While Wakefield and
those who were now attempting to reduce his theory to practice
were imposing a price for the purpose of restricting occupation,
Gipps was vigorously contending that the land should be sold in
such a way as to realize its full market value. Gipps could never
see the force of selling land at any other than the highest price
which it would bring. He judged the system of land-sales by its
success in producing revenue, not by its success in keeping
labourers from becoming landowners too soon. To illustrate his
objections to a uniform price, he contrasted the amount of
revenue produced by auction at Portland Bay in 1840, compared
with what would have been produced if the land had been sold at a
uniform price; <a name="FNanchor_10_54" id=
"FNanchor_10_54"></a><a href="#fn10_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and he pointed out that to adopt the new principle for Port
Phillip would mean a loss to the revenue of about one million
pounds. <a name="FNanchor_10_55" id="FNanchor_10_55"></a><a href=
"#fn10_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p>Another objection which he took to the uniform price,
especially when coupled with a system of special surveys, was
that it would enable others to buy the land under the feet of the
squatters, without giving them the notice to which, at least,
they were entitled. <a name="FNanchor_10_56" id=
"FNanchor_10_56"></a><a href="#fn10_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p>So satisfied, indeed, was Gipps as to the advantage of auction
over uniform price, that, when he received the instructions of
May, 1840, he issued land regulations which in practice rendered
almost nugatory the introduction of a uniform price into Port
Phillip. The colony of New South Wales was divided into three
districts. <a name="FNanchor_10_57" id=
"FNanchor_10_57"></a><a href="#fn10_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Country lands were to be sold at Port Phillip at the uniform
price of £1 per acre; lands in new townships at the uniform price
of £100 per acre; and lands in established towns by auction. But,
at the same time, on his own responsibility, though with the
concurrence of the Legislative Council, Gipps reserved from sale
all lands previously advertised at a higher upset price than £1
per acre, and also all lands within five miles of the towns of
Melbourne, Williamstown, Geelong, and Portland. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_58" id="FNanchor_10_58"></a><a href="#fn10_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<p>Gipps was equally strongly opposed to the new system of
special surveys because of its unfairness to squatters, and
because it would cause loss to the revenue. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_59" id="FNanchor_10_59"></a><a href="#fn10_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The first special survey was sold in
England by the commissioners to Mr. Henry Dendy, who paid £5,120,
and in return received an order entitling him to select eight
square miles at Port Phillip. <a name="FNanchor_10_60" id=
"FNanchor_10_60"></a><a href="#fn10_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
On his arrival in 1841, he claimed that this land order entitled
him to select his land as near as possible to the established
towns. <a name="FNanchor_10_61" id="FNanchor_10_61"></a><a href=
"#fn10_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This, however, Gipps was
determined not to concede; and he issued regulations to the
effect that neither land surveyed and open to selection by
ordinary purchasers, nor land within five miles of the
established towns, could be included in a special survey, thereby
materially limiting Dendy's area of selection. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_62" id="FNanchor_10_62"></a><a href="#fn10_62"
class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The actual value of such a special
survey, if freedom of selection had been allowed, may be seen
from the fact that Dendy, on the day of his arrival, was offered
£15,000 for his land order, but refused to take less than
£50,000. <a name="FNanchor_10_63" id=
"FNanchor_10_63"></a><a href="#fn10_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p>Gipps notified the Home Government of the steps which he had
taken in carrying out the instructions as to sale at a uniform
price and special surveys, and asked for further instructions. In
the meantime he continued to send to the Colonial Office
strongly-worded protests against both systems.</p>
<p>In this opposition Gipps had the support of the colonists. The
Legislative Council of New South Wales in 1840, and again in
1841, gave their decided opinion in favour of auction as the best
method of disposing of land. <a name="FNanchor_10_64" id=
"FNanchor_10_64"></a><a href="#fn10_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Mr. La Trobe, too, the superintendent at Port Phillip, while
admitting that some objection could be taken to sale by auction
on the ground that it caused delays and disappointment to
settlers, thought that on the whole it had worked very
successfully. <a name="FNanchor_10_65" id=
"FNanchor_10_65"></a><a href="#fn10_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a></p>
<p>The most important of Gipps' protests was an able memorandum,
in 1840, on the disposal of land in New South Wales, based on his
experience in the colony, and strongly condemning the recent
innovations. <a name="FNanchor_10_66" id=
"FNanchor_10_66"></a><a href="#fn10_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Coming, as it did, at the time when the failure of South
Australia was throwing discredit on the system established there,
including the principle of a uniform price, this memorandum led
the Home Government, in 1841, to reverse its policy, and to
abandon the uniform price. <a name="FNanchor_10_67" id=
"FNanchor_10_67"></a><a href="#fn10_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Lord John Russell first approved of Gipps' action in reserving
land near the towns from sale at a uniform price; <a name=
"FNanchor_10_68" id="FNanchor_10_68"></a><a href="#fn10_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and then, in deference to Gipps'
experience and judgment and to the report of the South Australian
Committee of 1841, which had recommended auction, he retraced his
steps and restored the former system of auction with this
addition, that country land, which had been put up to auction and
remained unsold, should then be disposed of at the upset price.
<a name="FNanchor_10_69" id="FNanchor_10_69"></a><a href=
"#fn10_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> A few months previously, in
view of Gipps' representations and of reports from South
Australia as to the working of special surveys there, Russell had
ordered that no more should be granted either in New South Wales
or by the commissioners in England. <a name="FNanchor_10_70" id=
"FNanchor_10_70"></a><a href="#fn10_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Not much use had been made of the system before it was abandoned;
for Dendy's was the only special survey sold by the
commissioners, while no more than seven had been sold in the
colony. <a name="FNanchor_10_71" id="FNanchor_10_71"></a><a href=
"#fn10_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
<p>During this period the demand for labour in New South Wales
was always urgent. The opening up of Port Phillip, and the
increase in land sales there and in other parts of New South
Wales, had at once increased the demand for labour, and provided
the means of supplying it. But, even though the number of
assisted emigrants grew greatly from 1837, it could not keep pace
with the wants of the colonists, especially after the system of
assignment had been abolished. In the absence of sufficient
emigrants from Europe, the introduction of coolie labour from
India had been suggested in 1837 by the Immigration Committee of
the New South Wales Legislative Council. <a name="FNanchor_10_72"
id="FNanchor_10_72"></a><a href="#fn10_72" class=
"fnanchor">[72]</a> Lord Glenelg had at once opposed the project,
<a name="FNanchor_10_73" id="FNanchor_10_73"></a><a href=
"#fn10_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and the Transportation
Committee of 1838 strongly objected that such indentured labour,
if permanent, would mean the introduction of a slave caste which
would curse Australia with an evil similar to that existing in
the Southern States of America. <a name="FNanchor_10_74" id=
"FNanchor_10_74"></a><a href="#fn10_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
When Gipps arrived in New South Wales, he found the proposal
still supported by some who looked "rather to their own immediate
wants, than to the ultimate good of the country;" and he entirely
disapproved of any attempt to put it into practice. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_75" id="FNanchor_10_75"></a><a href="#fn10_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a> One colonist, indeed, had, in December,
1836, introduced into New South Wales at his own expense
forty-one Indian coolies; and, in 1838, he was bold enough to ask
in return payment of a bounty of £6 per head. Gipps, however,
fully agreeing with Glenelg's attitude to this question, refused
to recommend this claim. <a name="FNanchor_10_76" id=
"FNanchor_10_76"></a><a href="#fn10_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
The project of Indian immigration was revived again in 1841, but
the Legislative Council then refused to support it. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_77" id="FNanchor_10_77"></a><a href="#fn10_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p>When Mr. T. F. Elliot was appointed Agent-General for
Emigration in 1837, he found in existence two methods of
conducting assisted emigration to New South Wales, Government
emigration, and bounty emigration. The former was controlled
partly by the Home Government, partly by the Colonial Government;
while the latter was controlled entirely by the Colonial
Government. Under the former system surgeons were sent home by
the Colonial Government to choose parties of emigrants, and to
take them out to the colony. <a name="FNanchor_10_78" id=
"FNanchor_10_78"></a><a href="#fn10_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
It was found, however, that this plan was expensive and resulted
in bringing a greater number of young children than was
desirable; while the mortality on board these ships was very
great. <a name="FNanchor_10_79" id="FNanchor_10_79"></a><a href=
"#fn10_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Elliot, therefore, in the
beginning of 1838, appointed selecting officers in England and
Ireland, and assumed the whole responsibility for managing
Government emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_80" id=
"FNanchor_10_80"></a><a href="#fn10_80" class=
"fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
<p>After his appointment as Agent-General for Emigration no more
ships exclusively with female emigrants were despatched by the
Government; but young married couples with their families, and
unmarried female relations or friends travelling under their
protection, were sent. <a name="FNanchor_10_81" id=
"FNanchor_10_81"></a><a href="#fn10_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
<p>After 1837, too. Government emigration ships were only very
occasionally sent to Van Diemen's Land; and, since the bounty
system was not adopted until 1840, there was practically no
assisted emigration to that colony between 1837 and 1840.
<a name="FNanchor_10_82" id="FNanchor_10_82"></a><a href=
"#fn10_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Even after 1840 the revival
did not last long; and, from 1842 to 1848, there were no funds
available for assisting emigration there. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_83" id="FNanchor_10_83"></a><a href="#fn10_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
<p>The bounty system, as adopted by Governor Bourke in 1837,
<a name="FNanchor_10_84" id="FNanchor_10_84"></a><a href=
"#fn10_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> had originally been intended
for the benefit of settlers who wished to introduce labourers for
their own service. But, even before Bourke had left, the system
had changed, and had become a commercial speculation, in which
shipowners had obtained bounty orders, <i>i.e</i>., permissions
from the Colonial Government to import immigrants, without any
pretence that they wanted the labourers for their own service.
The importers trusted to the general fitness of the emigrants to
obtain the bounties payable on their introduction. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_85" id="FNanchor_10_85"></a><a href="#fn10_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>
<p>Up to 1840, the two systems of bounty and Government
emigration remained in competition with one another; and the
question of their relative merits was very much canvassed in New
South Wales. There was little to choose between them in regard to
the health of the emigrants. Both bounty and Government ships
suffered a good deal from sickness on board, and several had to
be quarantined on arrival. <a name="FNanchor_10_86" id=
"FNanchor_10_86"></a><a href="#fn10_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
The mortality on Government ships during the voyage was less than
on bounty ships, the average being six per cent. of deaths as
compared with eight per cent. <a name="FNanchor_10_87" id=
"FNanchor_10_87"></a><a href="#fn10_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
But Government emigration proved much more expensive than bounty
emigration. Under the latter system the cost of emigration was
less by £4. per head, or 21 per cent., than under the former
system; while, if the quality of the emigrants and the number of
children sent were taken into account, the advantage was still
greater. <a name="FNanchor_10_88" id=
"FNanchor_10_88"></a><a href="#fn10_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
For this reason the colonists naturally preferred the bounty
system, and Gipps was convinced by experience that they were
right. <a name="FNanchor_10_89" id="FNanchor_10_89"></a><a href=
"#fn10_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He wished that, if possible,
both systems should be continued, because he thought that each
was necessary to supply the demand for labour in the colony; but,
in view of the expense of Government emigration, he recommended,
at the end of 1839, that it should be discontinued unless its
cost could be reduced. <a name="FNanchor_10_90" id=
"FNanchor_10_90"></a><a href="#fn10_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Without waiting for an answer to this request, however, he took a
step which, in the end, practically led to the cessation of
Government emigration. When the practice of assignment was
abandoned, and transportation was about to be abolished, the
demand for labour became greater than ever in the colony. To meet
this difficulty the Immigration Committee of the Legislative
Council, in 1839, recommended that the amount of the bounties
should be raised, and, in view of the absolute necessity of
securing a supply of emigrants, Gipps, though reluctantly,
consented. <a name="FNanchor_10_91" id=
"FNanchor_10_91"></a><a href="#fn10_91" class=
"fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, he issued a Government notice, on the 3rd March,
1840, revising the regulations for bounty emigration. The bounty
for a married man and his wife was increased from £30 to £38, and
those for children and unmarried men and women were raised in the
same proportion. As before, unmarried women were eligible only if
travelling under the protection of a married couple, and
unmarried men only if an equal number of unmarried women were
brought out in this way at the same time. The class of emigrants
required consisted of agricultural labourers, shepherds,
carpenters, bricklayers, masons, and female domestic and farm
servants. No bounty was to be paid on any emigrant until approved
by a board appointed by the Colonial Government. Those who wished
to engage in the business of bounty emigration were to apply to
the Colonial Government for permission; and the bounty orders
thus granted were only available within two years from their
date. <a name="FNanchor_10_92" id="FNanchor_10_92"></a><a href=

<p>In January, 1840, a most important step, to which some
reference has already been made, <a name="FNanchor_10_93" id=
"FNanchor_10_93"></a><a href="#fn10_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
was taken by the Home Government in appointing a Board of Land
and Emigration Commissioners to take the place of the South
Australian Commissioners and of the Agent-General for Emigration.
The credit of the immediate change is due to James Stephen, who,
when the South Australian Commissioners requested remuneration
for their services, took the opportunity to consider the whole
question of the management of land-sales and emigration. He
proposed to consolidate Elliot's establishment with that of the
South Australian Commission, which were "the precise counterparts
of one another;" to appoint three commissioners; and to enlarge
considerably their sphere of action. He found that the two
offices and their agents had indulged in an "unseemly and
injurious competition" for emigrants; and suggested that the
measure would mean a considerable saving of money and a great
increase of efficiency. Also it "would go far to satisfy the
demands of Mr. Ward and his associates on this subject," besides
being an effectual answer to the demand for salaries on the part
of the eight unpaid South Australian Commissioners. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_94" id="FNanchor_10_94"></a><a href="#fn10_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>Lord John Russell adopted the proposal, and accordingly on the
14th January, 1840, he appointed as Colonial Land and Emigration
Commissioners Mr. T. F. Elliot, Colonel Torrens, and Mr. Edward
Villiers. At the same time he gave them instructions which,
Charles Buller said in 1843, contained "an admirable view of the
general duties of a government in respect to colonization."
<a name="FNanchor_10_95" id="FNanchor_10_95"></a><a href=
"#fn10_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The commissioners were to
act as South Australian Commissioners, but, in addition, they
were to be a general board to manage the sale of land, and to
promote emigration in other colonies. In this latter capacity
their duties were fourfold. First, the collection and diffusion
of accurate statistical information as to the various colonies.
Secondly, the sale in Great Britain of waste lands in the
colonies. Thirdly, the application of the proceeds of such sales
in emigration. Fourthly, the rendering of accounts of their
administration of the land fund. Russell laid it down that
colonial waste lands were "held in trust, not merely for the
existing colonists, but for the people of the British Empire
collectively." In the British North American colonies the
commissioners were to have no power of selling lands, and their
duties in those colonies were consequently restricted. But the
Australian colonies formed the principal field for their
operations. They were given power to contract for the sale of
lands there, and to use the proceeds in emigration, except in so
far as they might be required for pressing local needs. In the
colonies where there was no revenue for emigration the
commissioners were to exercise a general superintendence over
emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_96" id=
"FNanchor_10_96"></a><a href="#fn10_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p>The Board was not finally abolished until 1878, and in the
meantime it carried on a work of very great importance. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_97" id="FNanchor_10_97"></a><a href="#fn10_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>
<p>Without detracting from the merit of Stephen's proposal, it is
clear that to Wakefield is due the chief merit for this measure,
which even more definitely than the appointment of Elliot, made
emigration a department of government. He had shown the way by
his inauguration of a land and emigration Commission for South
Australia. In 1836 he had urged the appointment of a general
Board to deal with these matters, and had persuaded the Waste
Lands Committee of that year to recommend his proposal. It was
the first instalment of his system in Australia which created the
assisted emigration to those colonies, and made it necessary for
the Government to assume its control and direction. Finally, he
had repeated his recommendation, in 1839, in his Report on Crown
Lands and Emigration in Canada, and his conclusive reasoning had
convinced Lord Durham.</p>
<p>After the raising of the bounties, Gipps issued bounty orders
throughout 1840 in a lavish manner, so that, on October 31st of
that year, the colonial government was pledged to pay bounties to
the amount of £979,562 on the arrival, within two years, of
71,315 emigrants. He apprehended no inconvenience from this large
issue, as he considered it impossible that such a number of
people could arrive within the given time. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_98" id="FNanchor_10_98"></a><a href="#fn10_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The immediate effect of these orders
was a great increase in bounty emigration, and the Land and
Emigration Commissioners, finding that more emigrants were going
to New South Wales than the whole estimated amount of available
revenue would pay for, were forced to cease sending Government
emigration ships. <a name="FNanchor_10_99" id=
"FNanchor_10_99"></a><a href="#fn10_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
In view of this. Lord John Russell decided to give bounty
emigration a further trial under the superintendence of the
Commissioners. They were to arrange for the inspection of ships
and emigrants, and, if all proper conditions were complied with,
were to issue to the master of the ship a certificate to that
effect, without which no bounty was to be paid. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_100" id="FNanchor_10_100"></a><a href="#fn10_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p>Gipps' zeal for emigration, however, outran the means at his
disposal. Towards the end of 1840 he inserted conditions in the
bounty orders to the effect that their payment was conditional on
the Colonial Government having funds to meet them; <a name=
"FNanchor_10_101" id="FNanchor_10_101"></a><a href="#fn10_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but he nevertheless continued to issue
orders during the early part of 1841, so that in March of that
year the Colonial Government was liable to pay £1,175,471 for the
importation of 84,925 emigrants, a fact which the governor
noticed without comment. At this time, too, New South Wales was
suffering from a severe commercial crisis and the receipts from
land sales which, in 1840, had amounted to over £300,000 were
rapidly decreasing. <a name="FNanchor_10_102" id=
"FNanchor_10_102"></a><a href="#fn10_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a> At length Gipps took alarm, and, in view of
the diminution or the land fund and the great influx of
emigrants, he appealed to Russell in November, 1841, to check
emigration to New South Wales. <a name="FNanchor_10_103" id=
"FNanchor_10_103"></a><a href="#fn10_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a> Russell, before the arrival of this request,
had severely censured Gipps for his unauthorized proceedings in
issuing so many bounty orders, and had forbidden him to issue any
more. <a name="FNanchor_10_104" id="FNanchor_10_104"></a><a href=
"#fn10_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> At the same time the
Commissioners had taken steps to put a stop to bounty emigration,
by a notice to the effect that no bounty would be payable for any
emigrant leaving after November 1st, 1841. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_105" id="FNanchor_10_105"></a><a href="#fn10_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Throughout 1842 bounty emigration was
therefore suspended, <a name="FNanchor_10_106" id=
"FNanchor_10_106"></a><a href="#fn10_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a> although emigrants who had sailed before
November, 1841, arrived in New South Wales during the early part
of the year.</p>
<p>As a system of providing a regular supply of efficient labour
to New South Wales bounty emigration had some serious faults.
Bounty agents were under no engagement to bring out the emigrants
for whom they had obtained orders. The Colonial Government, on
the other hand, was bound to pay for all those who might be
introduced under the orders. There was no certainty, therefore,
that a regular supply of labour would be introduced; while the
Colonial Government, having in this way undertaken heavy
liabilities, was precluded from providing emigration in any other
way. Bounty emigration was precarious and uncertain, operating to
embarrass the Government while weighing lightly on the
speculators who traded in orders. <a name="FNanchor_10_107" id=
"FNanchor_10_107"></a><a href="#fn10_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> Nor did the system ensure that the emigrants
would be of the class required in the colony. Only those who
followed certain occupations, men and women in equal numbers,
married couples and single women travelling under their
protection, and all of good character, were wanted by the
colonists. Generally speaking, they obtained the class of
emigrants which they required, although there were a great number
of exceptions; while some of the evils which had been prevalent
in the earlier years of assisted emigration again occurred. This
latter statement, however, is true only of the years 1841 and
1842; for there was little complaint of the emigrants who arrived
before the raising of the bounties caused a sudden rush to
speculate in bounty orders, and a consequent flood of emigrants
into the colony. The certificates given by the commissioners that
all proper conditions had been complied with in the selection of
emigrants and in the shipping arrangements, was not a very useful
check. <a name="FNanchor_10_108" id=
"FNanchor_10_108"></a><a href="#fn10_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a> Frauds and forgeries were not uncommonly
committed by emigrants and bounty agents in their efforts to
evade the regulations. <a name="FNanchor_10_109" id=
"FNanchor_10_109"></a><a href="#fn10_109" class=
"fnanchor">[109]</a> This evasion applied especially to the
regulation which provided that single women should travel only as
members of a family party. <a name="FNanchor_10_110" id=
"FNanchor_10_110"></a><a href="#fn10_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a> No very great care was exercised in the
selection of the women, and in one or two cases prostitutes were
sent, though in nothing like the numbers which arrived on the
female emigrant ships of 1832 and 1833. <a name="FNanchor_10_111"
id="FNanchor_10_111"></a><a href="#fn10_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a> The arrangements on board ship were not
always good. There were a few cases where provisions and water
were bad in quality and scanty in amount. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_112" id="FNanchor_10_112"></a><a href="#fn10_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Many complaints were justly made of
the conduct of masters and surgeons towards the emigrants.
<a name="FNanchor_10_113" id="FNanchor_10_113"></a><a href=
"#fn10_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The surgeons on the whole
were men of indifferent ability, <a name="FNanchor_10_114" id=
"FNanchor_10_114"></a><a href="#fn10_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a> and there was a considerable amount of
sickness on board the emigrant ships. <a name="FNanchor_10_115"
id="FNanchor_10_115"></a><a href="#fn10_115" class=
"fnanchor">[115]</a> The troubles of the emigrants were not at an
end when they reached the colony. Although the majority were
quickly absorbed, some of the women who had come out nominally
under the protection of married couples were left for a while
without shelter or employment. In this emergency a private
philanthropist supplemented the work of the Colonial Government.
Mrs. Caroline Chisholm, wife of Captain Chisholm of the Madras
Army, who arrived in Sydney in 1839, disinterestedly laboured to
establish depots throughout the country for the newly-arrived
emigrants, and to give them shelter and protection until suitable
situations could be found for them. <a name="FNanchor_10_116" id=
"FNanchor_10_116"></a><a href="#fn10_116" class=
"fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
<p>Although it was not possible for the Colonial Government,
under the existing system, to prevent the emigration of those who
did not suit the needs of the colony, nor indeed to supervise the
arrangements for their selection and during the voyage, yet they
could, and did, refuse to pay bounties. <a name="FNanchor_10_117"
id="FNanchor_10_117"></a><a href="#fn10_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a> A strict investigation was made into the
circumstances of each emigrant ship which arrived in the colony
by Emigration Boards appointed by the Colonial Government. Where
evidence was found that there had been ill-treatment, sickness,
lack of proper provisions, fraud, or misrepresentations as to the
character of the emigrants, bounties were withheld in whole or in
part. <a name="FNanchor_10_118" id="FNanchor_10_118"></a><a href=
"#fn10_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> How strict were the
inquiries may be seen from the fact that bounties were refused on
1,112 persons out of 24,350 bounty emigrants arriving in New
South Wales during 1841 and 1842. <a name="FNanchor_10_119" id=
"FNanchor_10_119"></a><a href="#fn10_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
<p>In connection with the subject of land sales and emigration,
the allied questions once more arose in New South Wales as to
what money should be spent in emigration, and who should control
the land revenue.</p>
<p>In 1838, the legislative council of New South Wales had
suggested the advisability of raising a loan for emigration, but
Gipps had opposed it on the score of the difficulty of
maintaining economy in the midst of the fictitious wealth which
would be thus produced. <a name="FNanchor_10_120" id=
"FNanchor_10_120"></a><a href="#fn10_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a> They renewed the recommendation in 1839, and
then found Gipps ready to agree, though "with the greatest
possible reluctance." <a name="FNanchor_10_121" id=
"FNanchor_10_121"></a><a href="#fn10_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a> But the Home Government were strongly
opposed to the policy of a loan, <a name="FNanchor_10_122" id=
"FNanchor_10_122"></a><a href="#fn10_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> and, although the suggestion was repeated by
the council in each year from 1838 to 1842, it was not adopted.
<a name="FNanchor_10_123" id="FNanchor_10_123"></a><a href=
"#fn10_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>
<p>Another method, however, of providing money was more
successful. In 1841 Gipps recommended the issue of debentures, in
view of the great demands made on the Colonial Treasury for the
payment of bounty orders. Accordingly, with the concurrence of
the legislative council, he issued in 1842 debentures to the
amount of £49,000, and subsequently obtained the approval of the
Home Government for his action. <a name="FNanchor_10_124" id=
"FNanchor_10_124"></a><a href="#fn10_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a></p>
<p>But the greater part of the money used in emigration during
this period came, as before, from the proceeds of the sale of
lands. This income, during the five years ending with 1840, had
averaged over £160,000 a year&mdash;reaching as much as £300,000
in 1840; <a name="FNanchor_10_125" id=
"FNanchor_10_125"></a><a href="#fn10_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a> and the greater part was spent in
emigration. All the colonists of New South Wales were now agreed
that to this object should be devoted as much of the fund as
possible. <a name="FNanchor_10_126" id=
"FNanchor_10_126"></a><a href="#fn10_126" class=
"fnanchor">[126]</a> All opposition to this part of the Wakefield
system had long ago gone. The Immigration Committee of the
legislative council in 1840, wrote of "those two great pillars of
colonial prosperity, the sale of land, and the just application
of the proceeds to the promotion of emigration." <a name=
"FNanchor_10_127" id="FNanchor_10_127"></a><a href="#fn10_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a> For some years previous to 1840 the
land fund had been drawn on for the ordinary expenses of
government when it was found impossible to keep the ordinary
expenditure within the revenue. <a name="FNanchor_10_128" id=
"FNanchor_10_128"></a><a href="#fn10_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> This was, in 1840 and in 1841, made a matter
of protest by Molesworth and Grote in the House of Commons.
<a name="FNanchor_10_129" id="FNanchor_10_129"></a><a href=
"#fn10_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> But during 1841 and 1842,
when the land sales suddenly dropped, first to £90,000, and then
to £15,000, a considerable amount of the ordinary revenue was
spent in emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_130" id=
"FNanchor_10_130"></a><a href="#fn10_130" class=
"fnanchor">[130]</a> The result was that, by the end of 1842, out
of a land fund of £1,090,000, obtained in the years 1832 to 1842,
a sum of £950,000 had been spent in emigration. Since, however,
the land fund had been charged with the expenses of its sale and
survey, and the protection of aborigines, amounting in all to
£260,000, no less than £120,000 of the ordinary revenue had been
devoted to emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_131" id=
"FNanchor_10_131"></a><a href="#fn10_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
<p>In 1838, when this large expenditure on emigration had not yet
taken place, the legislative council had suggested that the land
fund should be exclusively applied to this purpose. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_132" id="FNanchor_10_132"></a><a href="#fn10_132"
class="fnanchor">[132]</a> But, as Gipps pointed out, their
object probably was to force the Home Government to resume the
charges for police and gaols which had been laid on the colonial
revenue in 1834. <a name="FNanchor_10_133" id=
"FNanchor_10_133"></a><a href="#fn10_133" class=
"fnanchor">[133]</a> Indeed, the agitation for the removal of
these charges was, throughout the whole period, unsuccessfully
carried on by the legislative council. The Treasury, in 1838,
took their stand on the "general principle that expenditure
incurred in and for the benefit of the colony ought, whenever
practicable, to be defrayed out of the colonial revenue;" and
deliberately refused to relieve the colony. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_134" id="FNanchor_10_134"></a><a href="#fn10_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a> To the later protests that these
charges were more than the colony could bear, and that the land
fund was suffering, they replied that the Colonial Government,
with economy, might easily meet its expenses out of ordinary
revenue, and leave the land fund free for emigration. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_135" id="FNanchor_10_135"></a><a href="#fn10_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Whatever may be thought of the justice
of their policy, the Treasury's contention was well founded. The
amount of these charges had increased from £26,000 in 1835, to
£60,000 in 1838, and to over £100,000 in 1839. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_136" id="FNanchor_10_136"></a><a href="#fn10_136"
class="fnanchor">[136]</a> In 1841, Gipps attempted to make each
district of the colony pay its own police and gaol expenses; and
introduced into the legislative council a Bill for that purpose
which was rejected then, and again in 1842. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_137" id="FNanchor_10_137"></a><a href="#fn10_137"
class="fnanchor">[137]</a> But the colony had so prospered, and
the ordinary revenue had so increased, that, as the figures of
emigration expenditure above quoted show, the Colonial Government
was able to meet these charges, and yet to devote almost the
whole of the land revenue to emigration.</p>
<p>The other question as to who should control the land revenue
did not give much trouble. Despite the very strong declaration as
to the rights of the Crown contained in Lord Glenelg's despatch
of July 10th, 1835, <a name="FNanchor_10_138" id=
"FNanchor_10_138"></a><a href="#fn10_138" class=
"fnanchor">[138]</a> the colonists, during Gipps' first year of
office, asserted that the right to appropriate this revenue had
been conceded to the governor and council in 1834, and that it
had been recognized by Bourke. Gipps, however, stoutly maintained
that the Crown alone possessed this right, and his position was
not again seriously challenged. <a name="FNanchor_10_139" id=
"FNanchor_10_139"></a><a href="#fn10_139" class=
"fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
<p>The success of the system of land sales and emigration in New
South Wales, and in the founding of South Australia, gave rise to
several projects of colonization on similar lines. In 1839 a
committee of men of the North of England wished to colonize part
of Port Phillip by purchasing land there from the Home
Government, and sending out settlers. The Home Government,
however, replied to their request, that the land in question
formed part of the colony of New South Wales, to whose local
government belonged the decision as to the expediency of selling
land there. <a name="FNanchor_10_140" id=
"FNanchor_10_140"></a><a href="#fn10_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a></p>
<p>Another venture was the formation of the Australind Company,
one of whose directors was Wakefield, to buy land near Bunbury in
Western Australia, and to form a settlement there on the South
Australian principle. The first ship was despatched in August,
1840, land was bought, and a settlement begun. But the cheapness
of land in that colony owing to the earlier system of large
grants operated inimically; and the company was a financial
failure, although a number of excellent colonists were by its
means settled in Western Australia. <a name="FNanchor_10_141" id=
"FNanchor_10_141"></a><a href="#fn10_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a></p>
<p>Yet another scheme was that of Major Sullivan, a retired army
officer resident in New South Wales. In 1842 he proposed to
establish a settlement at New Caledonia, to be called Victoria in
honour of the Queen. A company was to be formed, under Royal
Charter, with a capital of £3,000,000, to buy land from the Crown
at 5s. per acre, and to use the proceeds in Asiatic or convict
emigration until free Europeans became acclimatized. The Colonial
Office rightly dismissed the plan as "visionary and
impracticable"; and it is worthy of notice solely as illustrating
how Wakefield's principle of land sales and assisted emigration
had by this time become part of the stock-in-trade of every new
colony promoter. <a name="FNanchor_10_142" id=
"FNanchor_10_142"></a><a href="#fn10_142" class=
"fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
<p>Throughout this period the systematic colonizers did not relax
their efforts to get the Wakefield system more firmly established
in Australia. The chief point on which they now concentrated
their attention was the necessity for permanency, both of the
system of land sales, and the devotion of the proceeds to
emigration. One of their earliest objections to the Ripon
Regulations had been that they were maintained simply by the
authority of the Secretary of State, and might be as easily
withdrawn. Another objection had been that there was no guarantee
that the whole or a fixed proportion of the proceeds would be
used in emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_143" id=
"FNanchor_10_143"></a><a href="#fn10_143" class=
"fnanchor">[143]</a> They therefore recommended that the whole
system should be regulated by an Act of Parliament, which should
lay down the principle of sale at a uniform price as the sole
method of alienation of land, and, at the same time, prescribe
that the whole of the proceeds were to be used in emigration. In
addition, they urged the appointment of a central board, which
should control both land sales and emigration. In 1839, H. G.
Ward, supported by Molesworth and Buller, moved resolutions in
the House of Commons affirming the principles of the Wakefield
system, and making these recommendations. Lord Howick gave his
support to these principles, though he was careful to indicate
his preference for auction, and the Government spokesman,
Labouchere, was not unfavourable. <a name="FNanchor_10_144" id=
"FNanchor_10_144"></a><a href="#fn10_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
<p>That part of their recommendations relating to the appointment
of a central board was, as has already been noticed, carried out,
in 1840, by the formation of the Board of Colonial Land and
Emigration Commissioners; but it was not until 1842 that the
Government introduced a Bill which, in the main, gave effect to
the rest of their proposals. This Bill, which became the
Australian Waste Lands Act of 1842, passed through both Houses
with surprisingly little discussion, the only important speech
being that of Lord Stanley in introducing it and explaining its
object. <a name="FNanchor_10_145" id=
"FNanchor_10_145"></a><a href="#fn10_145" class=
"fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
<p>The Government's reasons for the measure, as given by Stanley
in the House of Commons and in the circular despatch accompanying
the Act to the governors of the Australasian colonies, were
first, to put an end to the power of the Secretary of State to
change the system of land sales, next, to introduce uniformity
amongst the Australasian colonies, lastly, to establish
permanently the principle on which the land revenue was to be
expended. <a name="FNanchor_10_146" id=
"FNanchor_10_146"></a><a href="#fn10_146" class=
"fnanchor">[146]</a></p>
<p>The Act <a name="FNanchor_10_147" id=
"FNanchor_10_147"></a><a href="#fn10_147" class=
"fnanchor">[147]</a> laid down the principle that colonial waste
lands, with certain exceptions, were to be sold by auction at a
minimum price of £1 per acre, <a name="FNanchor_10_148" id=
"FNanchor_10_148"></a><a href="#fn10_148" class=
"fnanchor">[148]</a> which the governor was given the power to
raise. <a name="FNanchor_10_149" id=

classes&mdash;town, suburban, and country lots <a name=
"FNanchor_10_150" id="FNanchor_10_150"></a><a href="#fn10_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The first two classes might not be
sold otherwise than by auction. The third class, however, if put
up for auction and remaining unsold, might be disposed of by
private contract at a price not less than the upset price or the
highest price which had been offered at auction. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_151" id="FNanchor_10_151"></a><a href="#fn10_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Blocks of 20,000 acres or more of
unsurveyed lands might also be sold by private contract, if the
governor thought fit, but again at not less than the upset price.
<a name="FNanchor_10_152" id="FNanchor_10_152"></a><a href=
"#fn10_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The expenses of survey,
management and sales of land were to be a primary charge on the
land revenue; and, subject to this charge, the land revenue was
to be divided into two equal parts of which one was to be devoted
to emigration. <a name="FNanchor_10_153" id=
"FNanchor_10_153"></a><a href="#fn10_153" class=
"fnanchor">[153]</a> It was specially provided that the Act was
not to affect pastoral licences, nor was land held in this way to
be sold until after the expiration of the licence. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_154" id="FNanchor_10_154"></a><a href="#fn10_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Finally, the Act applied to all the
colonies of Australia and to New Zealand. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_155" id="FNanchor_10_155"></a><a href="#fn10_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Lord Stanley instructed the governors
that, of the moiety of the land revenue left at the discretion of
the Government, about 15 per cent., should be spent on the
aborigines, a further portion on public works, and the rest
should go to the general revenue. <a name="FNanchor_10_156" id=
"FNanchor_10_156"></a><a href="#fn10_156" class=
"fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
<p>In its provisions as to land sales the Act was advisedly
carrying out the recommendations of the South Australian
Committee of 1841; and, indeed, was merely regularizing and
giving Parliamentary authority to the practice which, established
in 1831, had been lately fixed by Lord John Russell in 1841,
after his short-lived attempt to enforce a uniform price. The
vexed question as to what proportion of the land revenue should
be spent in emigration was now definitely settled; but the even
more important question of squatting was left untouched. The easy
system of pastoral licences adopted by Bourke, and continued by
Gipps, still remained in existence; <a name="FNanchor_10_157" id=
"FNanchor_10_157"></a><a href="#fn10_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a> but signs were not wanting that some changes
would soon have to be made. From the point of view of the
Colonial Government, while it was necessary to safeguard the
rights of the Crown and the interests of the colony in dealing
with the squatters, there was the difficulty that a great deal of
available land in the settled districts had been sold, and the
Government was anxious to obtain the revenue from selling the
land held by the squatters. <a name="FNanchor_10_158" id=
"FNanchor_10_158"></a><a href="#fn10_158" class=
"fnanchor">[158]</a> Again, up to 1844, there was no regulation
limiting the area or the number of runs which a squatter might
hold under one licence. For this reason the licence fees were
bringing in very little revenue, and Lord John Russell had, in
1841, asked Gipps to consider whether it were not possible to
raise their amount. <a name="FNanchor_10_159" id=
"FNanchor_10_159"></a><a href="#fn10_159" class=
"fnanchor">[159]</a> From the point of view of the squatters
their tenure was too precarious, and they had already begun to
agitate for compensation for improvements if dispossessed, and
for that right of pre-emption in buying the land they held,
<a name="FNanchor_10_160" id="FNanchor_10_160"></a><a href=
"#fn10_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> which, when conceded in
1847, was to cause those violent struggles which disfigure the
later land history of Australia. They were claiming, indeed, to
possess a right to their land greater than that of mere
occupation at the pleasure of the Crown. Gipps, however, had made
it clear that he was unwilling to sacrifice the interests of the
colony by giving the squatters any more advantages than they
enjoyed. <a name="FNanchor_10_161" id=
"FNanchor_10_161"></a><a href="#fn10_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p>In 1842 another important Act was passed which introduced into
Australia a further instalment of the Wakefield system by giving
to the colonists of New South Wales some measure of
self-government. An Act of 1823 had provided for the
establishment in New South Wales or a legislative council to
assist the governor in legislation. <a name="FNanchor_10_162" id=
"FNanchor_10_162"></a><a href="#fn10_162" class=
"fnanchor">[162]</a> This council was appointed in 1825, and, by
another Act of 1828, it was increased in size and given more
power. <a name="FNanchor_10_163" id=
"FNanchor_10_163"></a><a href="#fn10_163" class=
"fnanchor">[163]</a> The council was a purely nominee body,
appointed by the Crown and consisting partly of Government
officials, partly of private settlers. The New South Wales
Government Act of 1842, <a name="FNanchor_10_164" id=
"FNanchor_10_164"></a><a href="#fn10_164" class=
"fnanchor">[164]</a> which passed with even less discussion than
the Waste Lands Act, for the first time introduced into that
colony political representation. It provided for a legislative
council consisting of twelve members appointed by the Crown, and
twenty-four members elected by the colonists. <a name=
"FNanchor_10_165" id="FNanchor_10_165"></a><a href="#fn10_165"
class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
<p>By this Act an attempt was made also to settle the
long-standing dispute in the colony over the expenses of police
and gaols. A system of local government was to be introduced and
district councils established, which were to have power to
provide, <i>inter alia</i>, the means of defraying one-half of
these expenses. <a name="FNanchor_10_166" id=
"FNanchor_10_166"></a><a href="#fn10_166" class=
"fnanchor">[166]</a> This scheme, however, proved an entire
failure. <a name="FNanchor_10_167" id=
"FNanchor_10_167"></a><a href="#fn10_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
<p>How far then had the Wakefield system been introduced into the
Australasian colonies by 1842?</p>
<p>The first great blow had been given to transportation, and, by
its abolition in New South Wales, free scope had been allowed for
the working of the Wakefield system there. New South Wales was
becoming what the systematic colonizers had long desired, a
colony rescued from the evil of convictism and gradually becoming
more attractive to free settlers, at once creating by land sales
a demand for labour, and providing the means of meeting that
demand.</p>
<p>In the next place, the system of land sales and assisted
emigration, introduced unobtrusively in 1831 as an experiment,
and tentatively continued since then with such alterations as
theory and experience had dictated, was, by 1842, adopted as the
most suitable for the needs of the Australasian colonies, and
given a more enduring basis in an Act of Parliament. The time of
experiment was over, and the Wakefield system as modified by
local experience was definitely established by law.</p>
<p>Then, too, a central board had at length been appointed to
control both the sale of lands and the management of
emigration.</p>
<p>Lastly, the very important step had been taken of introducing
political representation into two of the Australian colonies, and
from that time the transition to responsible government, even if
long deferred, was inevitable.</p>
<p>On the whole there can be no doubt that some of the principles
of the Wakefield system, though largely modified, had, by 1842,
received a remarkably full realization in practice in the
Australasian colonies. While its general principles were thus in
part conceded, its practical value as a system of colonization
was recognized. The land regulations certainly did not embody the
doctrine of a sufficient price which was the keystone of the
Wakefield theory on its economic side. £1 per acre was never at
any time admitted by Wakefield to be sufficient to check
dispersion and to prevent labourers from becoming landowners too
soon. Again, the method of auction was retained for most
purposes, and, although Wakefield was forced to admit its value
in special cases, he by no means abandoned his opposition to any
but a fixed and uniform price. In practice, however, the
provision that lands remaining unsold at auction might be
disposed of at the minimum upset price, conceded the principle of
a uniform price. Although the systematic colonizers preferred,
too, that the whole of the proceeds of land-sales should be
devoted to emigration, Wakefield, at least, was disposed to admit
that his system might work if a fixed proportion was allocated to
this purpose. His contention that colonists should be well
selected had been borne in mind. Considerable care was exercised
in the selection of emigrants to Australia, and a due proportion
between the sexes was observed.</p>
<p>Squatters were left in the same favourable position, and all
that had been done up to 1842 to give them easy access to the
waste lands of the Crown, would have had Wakefield's entire
approval.</p>
<p>Considering, however, that the theory arose in the brain of
one unconnected with the colonies and without experience of their
local conditions, the system of colonization which he advocated
was adopted with surprisingly little modification. No doubt those
who put it into practice did so for reasons which would not have
commended themselves to Wakefield. The aim of those who
administered the system of land-sales, especially of Gipps, seems
to have been to raise as much money as possible for emigration,
and to this Wakefield would never have consented. But, if the
Wakefield system is taken on its economic side to be merely a
practical means of colonizing by selling waste land, and using a
fixed proportion of the proceeds in assisted emigration, it had
been well established in all the Australasian colonies by
1842.</p>

<i>ibid</i>. Wakefield's attitude on the question of introducing
coloured labour into Australia is worth noting. In a postscript
to the <i>Letter from Sydney</i>, p. 202, he recommended the
Chinese as most useful immigrants for Australia. When, too, the
gold discoveries of 1850-1 were agitating Victoria, and drawing
away labour from agricultural and pastoral industries, he
suggested that the land fund should be used in importing Chinese
under contract to work as pastoral labourers. See his letters to
the <i>Spectator</i>, Oct. 4th, 1851, May 15th and 22nd, 1852.
This was a curious suggestion in view of the fact that those
Chinese who did arrive in Victoria at the time were attracted to
the diggings quite as much as European emigrants. Also the
Chinese as a rule, in Australia, have been occupied in
agricultural rather than pastoral industries.</p>

"We greatly require an office which should superintend the whole
business of the sale of Crown lands in the colonies, and
especially in Australia&mdash;a kind of Colonial Board of Woods
and Forests. Such a Board would act as referees on all such
questions. They would be the depositaries of all information on
the subject; and would afford such information to all applicants,
or to the public at large. They would consider of the propriety
of selling lands at New Zealand, Port Essington, and other
districts in Australia yet to be opened. To them might be
delegated the initiation, and the dispatch in the first instance
of all business connected with emigration, especially to the
Australian colonies. Each of these colonies would then receive
the same advantage and equal protection, and this office would be
relieved from a class of duties for the right discharge of which
it is certainly unqualified."</p>

<h4>Chapter XI</h4>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p><span class="a">Fourteen</span> years of strenuous work, from
1829 to 1842, on the part of the systematic colonizers had
wrought a revolution in the colonization of Australasia.</p>
<p>New South Wales had definitely abandoned its position as a
mere convict settlement, and had begun a new career as a
prosperous and attractive free colony. Its latest offshoot, the
settlement at Port Phillip, had been formed under the system of
land-sales and assisted emigration from the beginning&mdash;"a
realization, however defective," <a name="FNanchor_11_1" id=
"FNanchor_11_1"></a><a href="#fn11_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as
Wakefield called it, of his economic theory, and it had
progressed in an unparalleled fashion. A few figures will serve
to show the great change which had taken place in New South Wales
in regard to the sale of land and emigration. Under the system of
land grants previous to 1831, 3,344,030 acres of land had been
disposed of by the Crown, <a name="FNanchor_11_2" id=
"FNanchor_11_2"></a><a href="#fn11_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
for which the returns had been negligible. From 1832 to 1842 no
less than £1,090,583 had been received in New South Wales
(including Port Phillip) for the sale of about two million acres.
<a name="FNanchor_11_3" id="FNanchor_11_3"></a><a href="#fn11_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Of this amount somewhat more than
£950,000 had been spent in immigration, with the result that over
50,000 free settlers were brought to the colony during those
years&mdash;on an average nearly 5,000 per year. <a name=
"FNanchor_11_4" id="FNanchor_11_4"></a><a href="#fn11_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> The importance of this accession of free
colonists may be estimated from the fact that, at the census of
1828, the population of New South Wales was only 36,598, of whom
15,668 were convicts, and 20,930 free. <a name="FNanchor_11_5"
id="FNanchor_11_5"></a><a href="#fn11_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Assisted emigration acted as a stimulus to voluntary emigration,
so that the population of New South Wales, at the census of 1841,
amounted to 128,726, of whom 26,977 were convicts, and 101,749
free. <a name="FNanchor_11_6" id="FNanchor_11_6"></a><a href=
"#fn11_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is impossible to
overestimate the importance of this stream of emigration in
helping to swamp the convict element and to make New South Wales
a colony where free settlers predominated. Nor, under the
influence of the Wakefield theory, was this assisted emigration
one of paupers. Wakefield's attacks on Wilmot Horton, and his
insistence on the necessity for careful selection of emigrants,
and the equalization of the sexes, prevented the Home Government,
in its management of assisted emigration, from attempting to
"shovel out paupers."</p>
<p>In the next place. South Australia had been founded entirely
by the efforts of the systematic colonizers. Its foundation,
certainly, had disappointed their expectation; the Wakefield
system had not been given a fair trial there; the settlement had
passed through a severe crisis and had cost the mother-country a
great deal of money. Yet the colony had survived, had surmounted
its worst difficulties, and was on the road to an unbroken
prosperity.</p>
<p>Then, too, the new and important colony of New Zealand had
been saved to the British Empire by the energy and independent
action of the New Zealand Company, guided by Wakefield and the
systematic colonizers. This colony, too, was to pass through evil
times, but whatever may have been thought as to the wisdom
displayed by the Home Government or the leaders of the settlers
in the actual work of colonization, the wisdom of establishing a
British colony there was never questioned.</p>
<p>All these triumphs of the Wakefield theory had been won by the
energy and courage with which the systematic colonizers had
pursued their ideal of colonization. But, on its political side,
an even greater victory than these, and affecting other colonies
beside the Australasian, was the conversion of British statesmen
and the British public to the doctrine of responsible government
for the colonies. A general colonial policy for all homogeneous
white colonies in temperate regions was in this way laid down by
the systematic colonizers, which was even then being tentatively
put into practice, in Canada. The political principles underlying
the Wakefield theory were already part of the general stock of
ideas of all who thought on the questions of colonial government,
and the relation between colony and mother-country.</p>
<p>Indeed, the general British attitude towards colonies was
changing. Colonial waste lands, which had been looked upon as
useless, or as a means of rewarding officials and official
favourites, had come to be recognized as the chief element of
colonial prosperity, to be disposed of only with due regard to
the welfare of the colony and the mother-country. Emigration,
which had been haphazard and unregulated, and had been treated
merely as a means of ridding the mother-country of surplus
population, or of undesirables, was now regarded as a means of
building up prosperous communities, and benefiting both them and
the mother-country. The regulation of emigration was now
considered so important as to be worthy of the attention of a
department of Government. Colonies, too, were ceasing to be
looked upon only as a sphere for the benevolent autocracy of the
Secretary of State and his advisers. It was gradually being
recognized that, in various parts of the empire, states were
growing up whose citizens claimed to enjoy political rights not
materially different from those enjoyed at home. The era of
colonial self-government in the form of responsible government
was dawning, and this necessarily caused people at home to look
upon the colonists with different eyes. No longer were they to be
treated as a politically inferior race, but as a people to whom
could, in time, be entrusted all the rights and powers which they
would have possessed had they never gone abroad. Even from a
social point of view colonies began to take a less inferior
position. Now that transportation to New South Wales had ceased,
and the class of emigrants, especially to the newer colonies, had
improved, the colonists became, in English eyes, not necessarily
inferior in social standing. Charles Buller expressed this change
in peculiarly English language when he said, in 1843, that "a
colonial career is now looked upon as one of the careers open to
a gentleman." <a name="FNanchor_11_7" id=
"FNanchor_11_7"></a><a href="#fn11_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p>The systematic colonizers had fought against heavy odds.
Wakefield had first to convince a small band of followers, then
to lay siege to the Colonial Office. Even after his initial
success it was only by his persistence, ingenuity, and great
power of personal persuasion, that he was enabled to carry on the
campaign against the indifference of the public and the
hostility, avowed or unavowed, of some of the Colonial Office
Ministers and officials. Step by step his indefatigable energy
and the cogency of his arguments had defeated hostile attacks,
dispelled indifference, and disturbed the sloth of the Colonial
Office, with the result that his system had been put more and
more into practice in the older established colonies of
Australia. In founding the two new colonies of South Australia
and New Zealand, he achieved a partial success in the face of
great difficulties. Not only had he to persuade the Government
and the members of Parliament, but he had to win the confidence
of capitalists and emigrants, and persuade them to work together
to further his plans. The Waste Lands Act of 1842, applying to
all the Australasian colonies alike, marks the height to which
the influence of the systematic colonizers had risen in
convincing Parliament of the utility of the ideas underlying the
Wakefield theory. What alone could have stimulated Wakefield in
this long struggle was the fact that he was striving for the
success of his own idea. "The principle is mine," he wrote to
Gouger, in 1835. <a name="FNanchor_11_8" id=
"FNanchor_11_8"></a><a href="#fn11_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Nothing but parental zeal for the offspring of his own brain
could have enabled him to continue the struggle long after it was
clear that his theory as a whole would never be put into practice
by the Home Government.</p>
<p>That the prosperity of the Australasian colonies at this time
was largely due to the partial realization of Wakefield's ideas
is beyond a doubt. Referring to the part played by the systematic
colonizers, Herman Merivale, perhaps the fairest and best critic
of the Wakefield theory, wrote, in 1861: "The extraordinary
success which has on the whole attended the early colonization of
our Australian empire is due, in a far greater degree than is
commonly imagined, to the closet speculations of a few students,
and to the clauses of a few Acts of Parliament reducing these to
practice." <a name="FNanchor_11_9" id=
"FNanchor_11_9"></a><a href="#fn11_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Again, of the struggle and ultimate success of Wakefield's
principles of land-sales and assisted emigration, he wrote:
"Never was there a more remarkable instance of the success of a
principle against all manner of misapprehension&mdash;against the
fear of innovation&mdash;against corrupt interests&mdash;against
the inert resistance which all novelty is sure to encounter."
<a name="FNanchor_11_10" id="FNanchor_11_10"></a><a href=
"#fn11_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p>The success gained by the systematic colonizers is all the
more remarkable, since it must be admitted that the Wakefield
theory on its economic side was, considered as a scientific and
coherent whole, unsound. <a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
"FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#fn11_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p>Wakefield's statement of the problem of colonization, and his
analysis of existing conditions, both in the mother-country and
in the colonies, were, in the main, excellent. He was right in
urging that the chief obstacle in the way of prosperity in
Australia was the scarcity of free labour; and his criticism of
convict and indentured labour as substitutes for free labour was
just. Then, too, there was much truth in his paradox that the
great extent of free waste land in the Australian colonies was
not the cause of their prosperity, but the reason for their
backwardness. His attack upon the existing system of free grants
of land or sales at low prices was justified. The system
abolished in 1831 was inimical to the prosperity of the colonies,
and gave unlimited scope for jobbing and favouritism.</p>
<p>But Wakefield's suggested remedies are even more open to
criticism.</p>
<p>The Wakefield system may be considered in two ways, either as
a scientific theory, rounded and complete, no one part of which
is valuable without the other, and capable of working well only
when each part is put into practice; or as a series of practical
rules for colonization to be applied with discretion according to
the exigencies of time and place. In the former way Wakefield was
inclined to view his system, <a name="FNanchor_11_12" id=
"FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#fn11_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and in this way it must first be examined.</p>
<p>It will be convenient to separate the doctrine of a sufficient
price on waste lands from that of assisted emigration financed by
the proceeds of the sales. This is warranted by Wakefield's
declaration that he was prepared to rest the validity of his
theory solely upon the former doctrine. <a name="FNanchor_11_13"
id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#fn11_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p>The sufficient price was intended to restrict the dispersion
of settlers, and, by preventing labourers from becoming
landowners too soon, to provide a supply of "combinable labour"
<a name="FNanchor_11_14" id="FNanchor_11_14"></a><a href=
"#fn11_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in the colonies. Wakefield
used the terms "concentration" to describe the presence of a
supply of such labour, and "dispersion" to describe its absence;
and both these terms were strongly criticized at the time. It was
thought that the "concentration" he proposed was concentration of
settlement around one centre, and that the "dispersion" to which
he objected was any spreading of the colonists over the waste
lands. He aimed, however, not at the concentration of settlement
on any given spot, but at the concentration of labour wherever
settlement extended; while he believed that under his system
settlers, if extended over a wide area, would be extended, not as
isolated units, but in groups of combinable labour.</p>
<p>Since the sole object of the price was merely restrictive, it
is no criticism to say that it did not represent the value of the
land sold. It was not intended to bear any relation to land
values. Indeed waste land in a colony, before capital and
population arrive, cannot be said to have any easily
ascertainable value.</p>
<p>The doctrine of a sufficient price is based upon two main
assumptions, first, that where in a colony there is a system of
unlimited free grants, a settler will prefer to become a
landowner cultivating the soil by his own labour, rather than to
work as a landless labourer even at a high rate of wages. One
critic, Mr. Poulett Scrope, before the 1836 Committee on Waste
Lands, denied this assumption, but in the light of colonial
history, it seems just.</p>
<p>The second, and more important, assumption is that the best
method of developing agricultural land in a new settlement is a
system under which the work of cultivation is carried on by
landed proprietors, who do not work the land themselves, but
supply the capital to hire landless men to cultivate for them.
However natural such an assumption might be to an Englishman, it
would not necessarily seem valid to a British or American
colonist. It overlooks the importance of another method of
developing a new country by means of small holders who employ
either solely or mainly the labour of their own hands and that of
their family. Indeed, although right in attacking the system
whereby, in Australia, where labour was scarce, settlers with
small capital had been allowed to take up large grants of land
which they could not properly cultivate, Wakefield did not seem
to see that a modification of the system in the direction of
small holdings, even on free grants, might be more suitable for
agriculture than his plan of sale, and had actually been
successful in colonization. <a name="FNanchor_11_15" id=
"FNanchor_11_15"></a><a href="#fn11_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Sale at a sufficient price was suitable to a capitalistic system
of intensive cultivation on a large scale, but operated to
discourage settlers of small capital, and to turn this stream of
emigration to countries where land could be acquired on easier
terms. <a name="FNanchor_11_16" id="FNanchor_11_16"></a><a href=
"#fn11_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This was particularly true
where an initial outlay of capital was required to clear the land
and render it fit for cultivation, as in Canada and some parts of
New Zealand. This explains why the Wakefield system was more
applicable to Australia where, for the most part, the cost of
clearing was comparatively small. <a name="FNanchor_11_17" id=
"FNanchor_11_17"></a><a href="#fn11_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p>A sufficient price, then, can only be justified on the ground
that capitalistic production alone is best for the colony, and
this contention was not well based. Wakefield made the error of
insisting over-much on the necessity for a combination of labour
and capital in a new country. Colonial experience has proved
that, at any rate in the early stages of colonization, the land
may be developed equally well, and more rapidly, by that system
of small holdings and isolated labour whose value Wakefield
denied. Under a sufficient price, too, if the system worked badly
in practice, capitalists might be enabled to establish a monopoly
in land to the detriment of the labourer. Hence the objection to
the Wakefield system that it meant the creation in a new country
of two sharply distinguished classes&mdash;capitalistic
landowners and landless serfs. <a name="FNanchor_11_18" id=
"FNanchor_11_18"></a><a href="#fn11_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
It must always be remembered, however, that an essential part of
the Wakefield system was that the state of a landless hired
labourer should only be temporary. When the system was in full
work he contemplated that the best and most prudent of the
labourers would, when their period of service was over, be
continually passing into the ranks of the landowning
capitalists.</p>
<p>Even if the sufficient price were sound in theory, yet in
practice it was impossible to fix. Wakefield always escaped from
the demand that he should name a price by pleading ignorance of
local conditions; <a name="FNanchor_11_19" id=
"FNanchor_11_19"></a><a href="#fn11_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
but he knew well that it was easier to criticize than to name a
price.</p>
<p>Even the factors which he suggested for the solution of the
problem are not very satisfactory. The two factors to be
considered were, he held, first, the length of service which a
labourer should give, and, secondly, the general conditions of
the colony, wages, cost of living, nature of the soil and
climate. From these it might be determined how much a labourer
might save within the given period, and then the price could be
so fixed that, until his time was up, he could not obtain enough
land to cultivate. <a name="FNanchor_11_20" id=
"FNanchor_11_20"></a><a href="#fn11_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
<p>But, in the first place, the length of service was merely
arbitrarily fixed, and there was no more reason in favour of the
three or four years' service, which he suggested, than of any
other period.</p>
<p>Next, even considering the cost of living, wages, and other
conditions of the colony, it would only be a mere guess to fix a
price because of the great inequality in the amount or savings
which labourers would accumulate.</p>
<p>Then when land of varying quality was sold at a uniform price
it would be possible for one labourer to buy enough land of one
quality to keep him, while another might have to work much longer
to buy enough of an inferior quality at the same price.</p>
<p>Indeed, for the most part in Australia the price was in fact
determined by what the land would bring in the market, although
this was no part of Wakefield's doctrine.</p>
<p>When fixed, the price was to be uniform. In theory this was
best for the genuine settler, because it would not take too much
capital from him. But a uniform price did not so work in
practice. Wakefield seems to have thought that a settler would
buy land at the uniform price only because he wished to cultivate
it. But land was often bought as a mere speculation, and for
purposes of re-sale, not of cultivation. In South Australia, for
example, the uniform price resulted in speculative buying of the
best sites of town and country land, and in a mania of gambling
in land values, so that genuine settlers had little chance of
buying at the uniform price. The great difficulty was that only
at the first sale was the price uniform. Gipps was right in his
contention that to sell land in unlimited quantities, at a
uniform price, would mean a "scramble for land," in which
speculative capitalists would secure a virtual monopoly to the
disadvantage of genuine settlement. As Mr. Reeves justly remarks,
the practical difficulty consisted in "fixing a uniform price for
land low enough not to prevent <i>bona fide</i> purchase in
normal times, and at the same time high enough to check
speculation in moments of excitement." <a name="FNanchor_11_21"
id="FNanchor_11_21"></a><a href="#fn11_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p>The doctrine of a sufficient price, then, was based on a false
assumption; the price was as a matter of practice impossible to
fix; and there was no certainty that, even if a price were
arbitrarily fixed, it would achieve its object.</p>
<p>But if the aspect of rigorous scientific accuracy, which
Wakefield strove to give to this part of his theory, be
discarded, and the sale of land at a high price be taken as a
practical rule for colonization, it must be conceded that this
plan possessed many advantages over the previous system in
Australia. <a name="FNanchor_11_22" id=
"FNanchor_11_22"></a><a href="#fn11_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Major Mitchell, the well-known explorer and Surveyor-General of
New South Wales, wrote, in 1832, that under the former system the
best lands of the colony would soon have passed into few hands
without any benefit to the State. <a name="FNanchor_11_23" id=
"FNanchor_11_23"></a><a href="#fn11_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The experience of Western Australia, too, is conclusive proof
that in Australia, at least, a system of free grants and
unlimited freedom of appropriation was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Restricted sale under effectual settlement conditions may be,
as Mr. Reeves suggests, a possibly better method of disposing of
colonial lands than that which Wakefield proposed; but experience
in New South Wales of the failure of all settlement conditions,
and even of the attempt to enforce quit-rents, showed that, in
the state of society existing when the Wakefield system Was
introduced into Australia, such conditions could not have been
properly enforced.</p>
<p>One practical advantage possessed by the sale of lands, at a
price high enough to prevent labourers becoming landowners at
once, was that thereby they would gain, not only capital, but
that experience which was especially necessary to emigrants in a
new colony, where conditions were quite different from those with
which they were acquainted at home. <a name="FNanchor_11_24" id=
"FNanchor_11_24"></a><a href="#fn11_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Mr. Reeves, who calls attention to this advantage, writes, "Many
thousands of the best farmers in colonies where the Wakefield
system has been more or less in force have started in life as
farm-labourers, and have gained their knowledge and their capital
in that way." <a name="FNanchor_11_25" id=
"FNanchor_11_25"></a><a href="#fn11_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p>But the most important practical aspect of land-sales was that
they provided a revenue which could be expended for the benefit
of the colonies, either in public works which opened up and made
available the resources of the colonies, or in emigration. In
Wakefield's eyes, indeed, this was merely a happy accident, and
had nothing at all to do with the argument for imposing a
sufficient price; but it was this very part of his theory which
proved most attractive in practice. The difference between
Wakefield's attitude and that of those who established his system
in Australia may be compared to that between advocates of a
"protective" tariff and advocates of a "revenue" tariff, on
imported goods. The former, like Wakefield, wish for a
restrictive, and even at times a prohibitive tax, the latter for
a tax which will produce revenue in a simple and easy manner.</p>
<p>As to the method of sale, while a uniform price stood
condemned by experience, auction, too, in theory prevented
monopoly and produced more revenue, but in practice took too much
capital from the settler and led to delays and disappointment.
Both methods encouraged jobbing and speculation. Indeed, it is
doubtful whether any system of sale with full liberty of
appropriation would not be liable to these evils. As Gipps
remarked in 1840, "It may probably be pretty safely assumed that
however prudent, politic, wise, or ingenious may be the
regulations laid down by the Commissioners in England, the
speculators or land-sharks in New South Wales will be ingenious
enough to defeat them." <a name="FNanchor_11_26" id=
"FNanchor_11_26"></a><a href="#fn11_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Probably the best method in the circumstances was that adopted by
Russell in 1840, and regularized by the Waste Lands Act of 1842.
Lands were first put up at auction (even Wakefield recognized
that in regard to town allotments some modification of a uniform
price was necessary) and country lands remaining unsold were
available at a uniform price. This gave <i>bona fide</i> settlers
a chance to acquire land at a comparatively low price, and yet
prevented land being altogether monopolized by speculators.</p>
<p>One question which remains is the effect of land-sales at high
prices on squatting.</p>
<p>The problem which would appear to confront a people in
settling a waste continent, as in America or in Australia, is how
to provide that the first occupation, if on a large and extensive
scale, shall not adversely affect the future intensive
settlement, either by destroying the utility of the natural
resources, or by permanently locking up the lands in the hands of
large holding settlers, to the detriment of would-be smaller
holders.</p>
<p>In Australia permanent agricultural settlement followed
pastoral occupation but slowly, and the problem was how to make
pastoral lands available for agriculture, without injuring the
pastoral industry upon which the prosperity of the colonists so
largely depended.</p>
<p>Wakefield always considered that pastoral interests should be
subordinate to agriculture. His solution was to allow the
squatter mere freedom of occupation of unsold waste lands, and
gradually to sell them, when necessary, as agricultural lands at
a sufficient price. Apparently he bestowed less thought on this
than on any other part of his schemes; for he did not appreciate
the practical difficulties of the situation in Australia. Indeed,
he told the Waste Lands Committee of 1836 that it was as easy to
prevent squatting there as in Wales. High prices on land did lead
to squatting, and it was difficult in practice to deny the
squatter all rights but that of mere occupation. But the system
of grazing licences as established in New South Wales worked
fairly well until Lord Grey's notorious Orders in Council of 1847
gave the squatters what they asked in long leases, greater
security of tenure, and the right of pre-emption. <a name=
"FNanchor_11_27" id="FNanchor_11_27"></a><a href="#fn11_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p>The complete Wakefield theory, however, was that after land
had been sold at a sufficient price the proceeds should be
devoted to emigration. By this means the system was expected by
its author to regulate itself. The amount of land sold was then
to indicate exactly the demand for labour, and the proceeds were
to supply this demand automatically. Moreover, this process was
to continue indefinitely, emigration of labour leading to
land-sales, and land-sales providing further emigration.</p>
<p>The first assumption on which this theory rests is that there
is some definite and ascertainable relation between a given
amount of land and the labour necessary to cultivate it. When
this is discovered, it is easy to fix a sufficient price, which
is now to be enough per acre to bring out the number of labourers
required to cultivate the land. This kind of calculation was made
by Colonel Torrens and others in fixing a price for South
Australia, but Wakefield always deprecated such attempts. Indeed,
two factors would always vitiate such calculations, first,
private re-sale of land; secondly, voluntary emigration.</p>
<p>Supposing, for example, that a price has been fixed on the
assumption that two labourers are required for the cultivation of
100 acres. If, then, land is re-sold by its original purchaser,
in small blocks to labourers, they become landowners, and so
deplete the ranks of hired labour, without providing (as the
original sale provided) a fund for the immigration of others to
take their place.</p>
<p>Again, the presence of voluntary emigration in any large
numbers, which occurred wherever assisted emigration took place,
would destroy the relation between land and labour calculated
only on the basis of assisted labour.</p>
<p>But, indeed, there is no such ratio between land and labour.
It cannot be determined how much labour is necessary to cultivate
waste land in a colony in the best way. It will depend on the
amount of capital and labour at the disposal of the landowner, on
the quality of the soil, and upon other considerations which vary
with every particular case. The best that can be said for the
theory is that the amount of land sold in a colony would, by
indicating the amount of capital invested, give a very rough
guide to the amount of labour required. Even here the holding of
land for speculative purposes would upset any calculations on
this basis.</p>
<p>The second assumption is that a price, sufficient to prevent
labourers from becoming landowners too soon, would also be
necessarily sufficient to provide funds to bring the requisite
number of labourers to the colony. On this rested the case for
devoting the whole of the proceeds to emigration; and this is
perhaps the most vulnerable part of the Wakefield theory. While a
sufficient price aimed only at restriction, the doctrine was
simple, if not necessarily valid. When, however, the sufficient
price aimed at the two objects, it was easily seen that the two
might never be achieved together. From the point or view of
restriction one ideal price, and one only, could, if discovered,
be established. From the point of view of providing emigration
the price should vary with the cost of an emigrant's passage. If,
therefore, a price were sufficient for either purpose, it did not
follow at all that it would be sufficient for the other.</p>
<p>At this point the theory, consisting of the two doctrines of a
sufficient price and the application of the whole of the proceeds
to emigration, completely breaks down. Its pretended character of
mathematical precision, of scientific accuracy, must be denied,
and its claim to be self-regulating dismissed. What is left then
of the Wakefield theory is a series of important practical rules
for colonization, capable of modified application according to
circumstances, and useful even if adopted independently of one
another.</p>
<p>The system of land-sales put an end to the abuses of the
previous system in Australia; and, moreover, during the years
following 1830, it supplied the necessary funds for an assisted
emigration, whose importance cannot be overestimated. What
chiefly hindered emigration to Australia was distance, and
distance could only be overcome by paying the emigrant's passage.
The failure of Wilmot Horton's efforts had shown that no Imperial
fund was available for such a purpose; and Wakefield's great
achievement lay in showing how an emigration fund might be
provided in a simple and easy way. Assisted free emigration, too,
supplied the place of convict labour in Australia, and made it
economically possible for transportation to be abolished.</p>
<p>The advantage of selecting emigrants, and of keeping the sexes
equal in numbers, only needed to be pointed out for it to be
accepted as a common-sense measure, though, until Wakefield
wrote, it was quite overlooked.</p>
<p>His scheme for the Imperial control of waste lands and
emigration, although in practice it could not be maintained when
the colonies were granted responsible government, served to
emphasize the fact that emigration, and the economic development
of a colony, concerned not only the colony itself, but the
mother-country and the empire as a whole.</p>
<p>Even as a series of practical rules the Wakefield system was
applicable only at a certain stage of colonial development. When
conditions changed, and the colonies outgrew the system, it was
wisely abandoned. The discovery of gold, for example, in
Australia in the early 'fifties, both furnished the necessary
incentive to emigration, and upset all nice calculations as to
the price of land and the amount of labour required to cultivate
it.</p>
<p>But, before its abandonment, his system had left its mark on
economic and social history in Australasia.</p>
<p>Wakefield had, indeed, introduced method and order into the
whole process of colonization, which had now become a serious
undertaking, in which certain ends were aimed at, and certain
means adopted to achieve those ends. If he were often wrong in
his means, and sometimes in his aims, yet the very fact that he
zealously pursued an ideal, and followed a plan, gave him an
immense advantage over a Colonial Office with no plan or theory
of its own, and swayed by the influence now of the Anti-Slavery
Society, now of the missionary societies, now of the systematic
colonizers. The Colonial Office, too, was being continually
forced by mere circumstance to act, and the Wakefield system of
colonization formed a ready-made path for their action.</p>
<p>By founding new colonies, by invigorating old colonies, and by
sending out to both a superior class of emigrants, not only had
Wakefield achieved material success, but he had brought about a
revival of the colonizing spirit of the English people.</p>
<p>On its political side his theory was more soundly based, and
in practice completely successful. Clear-cut separation between
local and Imperial matters was impossible, and some of the powers
which he would have reserved to the mother-country on a grant of
responsible government&mdash;control of lands, for example, and
the power of imposing a tariff, were conceded to the colonies.
But the important principle of colonial self-government, in the
form of responsible government, has proved in practice to be the
only satisfactory way of governing white colonies in non-tropical
regions. The policy was not adopted without a struggle. Much
remained to be done before the Australasian colonies obtained
this boon. But the main position had been won by the Durham
Report, and the later struggles could, after that Report, have
only one issue. As, when the doctrine of responsible government
was laid down by Durham, many feared that it would mean
separation, so, when the grant of responsible government was
actually made, many believed that it was only a stepping stone to
independence. Time has, however, proved that these fears were
groundless. Responsible government has retained the
self-governing colonies in a close connection with the
mother-country, which has endured, and which at no time has
seemed stronger than at present.</p>
<p>Time has shown, too, that responsible government of itself is
not sufficient to settle all political questions, either within
the self-governing colonies, between the self-governing colonies
of any one group, or within the empire as a whole.</p>
<p>Internal problems of self-government by no means received a
solution in the grant of responsible government. Its great merit
was that it gave each colony an opportunity of working out its
own problems of government in its own way. But that it was no
easy answer to every question may be seen from the fact that the
development of cabinet government in the self-governing colonies
has often been along different lines from the English system. For
example, there seems to have been a general tendency on the part
of the executive to override the legislature and the law and to
trust to later ratification of its action by the legislature.
<a name="FNanchor_11_28" id="FNanchor_11_28"></a><a href=
"#fn11_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<p>Responsible government, too, has proved insufficient to
determine the relations of neighbouring self-governing colonies
in any one group. Hence it has been found necessary to adopt some
form of union, and to create from the members of a group of
colonies a new self-governing entity, which curtails to a greater
or less extent their political powers.</p>
<p>In the last place, responsible government was not a final
solution of the relation between groups of colonies, or between
colonies and the mother-country. It did not mean separation, but
made for a distinct improvement in the relations of colonies to
the mother-country. It has, however, been thought necessary to
attempt to establish a closer and more coherent relation between
the two. Imperial conferences and other machinery have been
devised for this purpose, while various schemes of closer union,
either in some form of Imperial Federation or otherwise, have
been put forward.</p>
<p>But, though the work initiated by the little group of
systematic colonizers is not yet finished, its value may be
estimated if we conjecture what would have happened to the
colonial empire of Great Britain if they had never lived.</p>
<p>Australian history would have been very different. Swamped by
convicts, lacking free settlers, the penal colonies would have
grown slowly as large overseas gaols, where the population was
divided into an oligarchy of free landowners and a servile class
of convict-labourers. In time, no doubt, the feeling for
separation, which existed to some extent before responsible
government was granted, would have triumphed, and an independent
republic, an Alsatia of the Southern Seas, would have been
established. Only gradually and painfully could the penal
colonies have escaped from their past.</p>
<p>New Zealand, lost to the French, might have become a second
Noumea, and another plague spot in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Canada, refused responsible government, might have broken out
afresh in rebellion, and fought for and obtained independence, or
have thrown in her lot with the United States.</p>
<p>Certainly no opportunity would have been given for the growth
of strong and powerful self-governing dominions, virtually
independent, and yet able and willing in time of need to show the
strength of the ties which bind them to the mother-country.</p>

building of a bridge; a work, no part of which is complete until

is the sharpest test to which the theory of a sufficient price

Wakefield when he wrote that the Wakefield system "is a mere
<i>pis aller</i>, since he unfortunately has to do with free men,
not with slaves," p. 793. Although Wakefield contemplated keeping
labourers for a time in the "natural subordination in which the
greater part of mankind always have been, and probably always
will be, to the smaller part" (Evidence before the <i>South
Australian Committee</i>, 1841, to Question 2662. Acc. and Pap.,

<h5>3. COLONIAL OFFICE PAPERS IN THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE.</h5>
<p class="quote">These papers contain not only manuscript
despatches to and from Governors of the Australasian colonies,
but letters to and from intending settlers and those interested
in colonization, an occasional pamphlet, colonial Government
Gazettes, colonial Blue Books of statistics, and a series of
newspapers published in Australia. In addition much valuable
information is contained in the memoranda made by the officials
of the Colonial Office on receipt of the despatches from Colonial
Governors. Sometimes these memoranda are written on the despatch
itself, at other times they are separate. James Stephen in
particular mostly wrote his comments on the margin of the
despatch, though sometimes he prepared long memoranda for his
official superiors. These papers, up to 1837, are available in
the general search room at the Record Office, but after that date
it is only possible to see them in the Departmental search room
with special permission from the Colonial Office.</p>

<h5>4. SPECTATOR.</h5>
<p class="quote">The files of this newspaper from 1829 onwards
are very important, because Wakefield and his followers
constantly used it as a means of bringing their views before the
public.</p>
<br>
<h5>5. COLONIAL GAZETTE, 1839-1847.</h5>
<p class="quote">This paper only lasted for nine years, but it
was during that period the organ of the systematic colonizers.
For a time it was under the management of the <i>Spectator</i>,
from which it reprinted many articles.</p>
<br>
<h5>6. THE TIMES AND THE MORNING CHRONICLE.</h5>
<p class="quote">often contain articles and correspondence which
throw light on colonization and colonial policy during this
period.</p>

<h5>7. THE EDINBURGH REVIEW, THE QUARTERLY REVIEW, AND THE
WESTMINSTER REVIEW</h5>

policy.</p>
