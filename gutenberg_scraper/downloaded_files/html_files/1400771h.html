GREAT COMPANIES.</p>
<p><span class="aa">It</span> is now universally admitted that
there exists in this country, great competition for employment in
every kind of labour, bodily and mental, amongst all classes of
persons, whether well or ill-educated. The debates in Parliament,
the evidence supplied to Committees of both Houses, and almost
every newspaper, furnish proof that the number of persons in this
kingdom who are struggling with difficulty for the means of
subsistence, is extremely great; that the happiness and
prosperity of society at large is thereby materially lessened,
and that even the stability of our political institutions is
occasionally placed in jeopardy by this state of things.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* H. G. Ward, Esq. M.P., Speech in the House of
Commons, 27th June, 1839, on Colonization.&mdash;Quarterly
Review, No. 78, Art. 8.]</p>
<p>If any one should doubt the correctness of these opinions, let
him direct his attention to the present state of pauperism: let
him reflect on the meagre pittance awarded as wages both to the
agricultural and the manufacturing labourer; on the numbers in
the manufacturing districts constantly unemployed; on the growing
disposition to turbulence amongst the labouring classes, of which
Chartism is the exponent; and, finally, let him reflect on the
multitudes of the Irish poor subsisting by mendicancy and
plunder.* Whatever the peculiar views of individuals may be on
the subject of population, corn-laws, pauperism, &amp;c., no
person, taking due pains to inform himself, can doubt for a
moment that there has long been in the United Kingdom a much
greater number of persons than could find full employment at
wages, or other remuneration sufficient for their comfortable
subsistence. To express the result in a word,&mdash;<i>labour is
in excess</i> in this country in proportion to the means for its
profitable investment. Whilst such a state of things indisputably
exists at <i>home</i>, it is at the same time equally certain,
although not equally known or understood, that in our
<i>colonies</i> there is as great a <i>want</i> of labour as
there is a <i>surplus</i> of it here. Hence has arisen a desire
amongst the working classes, in proportion to their knowledge of
the opening for their employment in our colonies, to emigrate,
but the first difficulty that presents itself to the labouring
man at home, is the supposed impossibility of removing himself
from the place where his services are little valued, to the
favoured spot where such services would be richly remunerated:
the cost of conveying himself any considerable distance,
appearing to him to present an insuperable bar to the attainment
of his object: and thus in too many cases his hopes and
well-intentioned projects have been at once extinguished.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In Ireland there are 2,300,000 persons for
whose labour there is no demand for thirty weeks in the
year.&mdash;Evidence; Poor Law Inquiry Commission.]</p>
<p><i>Capital</i> is also found in a state of <i>excess</i> here,
and of <i>deficiency</i> in the colonies. The manufacturer, the
merchant, and farmer constantly perceive this excess manifested
in the great competition of their respective rivals in business,
and in the low rate of profits consequent thereon. In removing to
a colony, our farmers, merchants, and manufacturers find that the
greatest difficulty they have to contend against, is the
excessively high rate of Wages, if not the absolute destitution
of all assistance from labourers. Could they conscientiously or
lawfully avail themselves of slave labour, as in the ancient
flourishing period of Greek colonization, or as still permitted
in the United States; ** they would speedily be enabled to
produce a great surplus of articles having exchangeable value,
and thereby attain individual wealth, and advance the general
prosperity of the colony in which they might be settled.</p>
<p class="foot">[** There are 2,000,000 Slaves in the United
States, and their value, at £.60 each, is a property saleable for
£.120,000,000!&mdash;See Minutes of Evidence on Colonial Lands,
p. 75.<br>
<br>
By a more recent calculation, the number of slaves in the United
States is estimated at 3,000,000, which, at the present valuation
of £.100 each, gives a nominal value of £.300,000,000
sterling!!]</p>
<p>Repeated experiments *** have been made to engage labourers
from this country, partly for wages, and partly in consideration
of the expense the capitalist had been put to in conveying them
to the colonies. One result has almost uniformly followed these
experiments: the labourer, having speedily found that he could,
by the competition of other capitalists, obtain higher wages than
he had bargained for, and that by labouring at high wages for a
few months, he could acquire land sufficient for producing what
he considered necessary for his own subsistence&mdash;disregarded
his contract&mdash;became at once independent, and a landed
proprietor.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Ibid</i>, p. 63.]</p>
<p>The object of this little work is to exhibit to capitalists
and labourers proposing to emigrate, a remedy for the evils above
stated, and to furnish them with the best attainable information,
respecting a colony where such a remedy may be most successfully
applied.</p>
<p>The merit of discovering that sound principle of
colonization,&mdash;a sufficiency of labour, with a high rate of
wages and of profits, at the same time that it prevents great
excess of either,&mdash;is due to Mr. Wakefield, who ten years
ago first expounded his enlightened views on this subject, in his
entertaining and instructive <i>Letter from Sydney</i>.* These
views were followed up in 1833, by his work entitled <i>England
and America</i>, The subject was of too much importance, it
involved too many interests, and those of too great magnitude, to
permit the Colonial Department to treat it with disregard. From a
Speech of Lord Howick's, in the House of Commons, on Emigration,
in February 1831, the government appears to have been induced to
weigh with care the views of the Colonization Society, which had
adopted Mr. Wakefield's opinions. Lords Ripen and Glenelg were
certainly influenced thereby. Tins principle was recognized by
the Legislature in 1834, in the Act for Colonizing South
Australia, 4th and 5th Will. IV.** On the 8th of June, 1836, a
Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to
investigate the subject; *** and their "Report on the Disposal of
Lands in the British Colonies," further sanctioned that principle
of colonization, which, after being once clearly unfolded,
surprises by its simplicity, by its almost universal capability
of adaptation, by its practical utility, and by the necessity of
its application at this period in explanation of some of our
economical difficulties, and as a remedy for many of our social
evils ****.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Edited by Robert Gouger, and published in
1829.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The last Act of the Unreformed
Parliament.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** In 1838, these views were fully confirmed by
the numerous and intelligent witnesses examined before the
Transportation Committee.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** See the Earl of Durham's Report on the
affairs of Britkh North America, p. 73, and Report in Appendix
(B), by Mr. Charles Buller, M. P. The merit due to this latter
Report has been awarded publicly by Mr. Buller to Mr. E. G.
Wakefield.]</p>
<p>The principle may be thus briefly stated:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>That all unoccupied lands in the colonies being property of
the Crown, no person shall be allowed to obtain waste land
therein except by purchase of the Crown, in certain considerable
quantities, and at a uniform price per acre, fixed sufficiently
high to keep a continued supply of combinable labour in each
colony, proportioned to the available capital invested
therein.</i></p>
<p><i>That the Funds raised by the sale of lands in any colony,
shall be employed in conveying thither labourers from the United
Kingdom who desire to emigrate, free from all expense to them:
preference being given to young adult persons, especially if
recently married; and care being taken to preserve equality of
numbers of both sexes.</i></p>
<p>The carrying out of this principle in the case of the colony
of South Australia immediately produced striking effects. In
1839, the sales of land in it, yielded nearly 200,000<i>l</i>.!
This fact, and the successful results which have followed in the
colony in question may assure every one who embarks as capitalist
or labourer, to better his fortunes at a distance from his native
home, that no government will venture hereafter to act in
opposition to a principle which, while it appeals to the common
sense of mankind by its simplicity, is found to be so correct by
its practical success.</p>
<p>Having stated the remedy for the evils formerly and still felt
in some of our colonies, it is now proposed to furnish the best
attainable information respecting the colony of Western
Australia, where all the evils consequent, on the one hand, upon
a superabundance of capital with few or no labourers to work it,
and on the other, upon a superabundance of labour without
capitalists to work for, may be avoided, and where, under the
guarantee of the Colonial Department, of the enlightened local
government, and of the Western Australian Company, that sound
principle may be developed which will most effectually ensure the
happiness and prosperity of those who embark for the mild and
genial climes of Australia.</p>
<p>Provision has been carefully made by Act of Parliament, that
convicts shall not be sent to Western Australia. No parent,
anxious for the honour of his family, will have, in Western
Australia, any cause of fear from the corrupting influences of
convict labourers or convict domestics.</p>
<p>It is in this colony where the Western Australian Company
propose to sell land, and where the first town, to be named
Australind, is intended to be built by the body of colonists who
are shortly to emigrate thither. This town will be situated near
the junction of the rivers Brunswick and Collie, and the
territory to be now settled lies adjacent to those rivers and
Leschenault inlet, or estuary, in Koombanah Bay.</p>
<p>The History of Western Australia, with reference to its
discovery may be very succinctly narrated.</p>
<blockquote>"Recent researches in the British Museum (says Mr.
Ogle) have led to the presumptive proof that the great continent
of Australia was first discovered by the Portuguese very early in
the sixteenth century; but it was merely the northern part that
was then discovered, and after exploring the coasts of New
Guinea. It was the year 1616 before any discovery was made of the
<i>western</i> coast (the immediate object of our attention); the
merit of which is due to the Dutch navigator <span class=
"uu">Hartog</span>. He fell in with this coast on his passage
from Holland to the East Indies in latitude 35° south, within
three degrees of Swan River, and within one degree of the
important harbour of Leschenault, (which is proposed to be
designated Port <span class="uu">Australind</span>.) The land
which Hartog called Eendracht, from the name of his vessel,
comprises the principal portion of Western
Australia."</blockquote>
<p>In 1618, Zeachen named the coast from 11° to 15° south
latitude, Arnhem's Land and Van Diemen's Land. The island bearing
the latter name was first seen by Tasman. In 1619, Edels sailed
along the western coast; and in 1622 we first hear of Leeuwin's
Land. Peter Van Nuyts sailed along the southern coast which bears
his name, from Cape Leeuwin to Spencer's Gulf. In 1628, another
Dutch commander gave his name to De Witt's Land. Western
Australia was ordered by the States General, in 1655, to be
called New Holland. Little farther progress in exploring this
continent appears to have been made from this time till 1770,
when Captain Cook anchored in Botany Bay on the eastern coast.
The history of the formation of the <i>first colony</i> on that
coast which had been named by our great circumnavigator "New
South Wales," and its subsequent progress to its present
condition, is too well known to require notice here. Captains
Flinders, King, and others have since contributed greatly to our
knowledge of the coasts of this continent.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the western coast of New Holland to purposes
of colonization, and its great importance in a political and
commercial point of view, first began to excite the serious
attention of the British Government in the year 1827, through the
representations of Captain (Sir James) Stirling, R.N. The surveys
and favourable reports of the coast, by that officer, together
with information, officially received, of an intention on the
part of France to take possession of some part of it, led
ultimately to the formation of the settlement at Swan River by
the British Government in the year 1829. Sir James's first report
is dated the 18th April, 1827, from on board His Majesty's ship
<i>Success</i>, A second expedition to the Swan River was made in
His Majesty's ship <i>Rainbow</i>, the following year. In 1828,
the government having declined to undertake the charge of
settling the country. Captain Stirling and other gentlemen
entered into arrangements, with the knowledge of the Colonial
Department, for colonizing Western Australia as a private
undertaking; but their proceedings were suddenly brought to a
termination by the declared intention of the government to take
possession of the country without further delay&mdash;a wise
decision in every respect, for it was easy to perceive, even at
so early a date, the probable consequences of the possession of
that territory by a foreign power. Sir George Murray was then at
the head of the Colonial Office; and a state document, bearing
date from Downing-street, 6th December, 1828, made public the
intentions of government with regard to Western Australia. By
that paper, however, it appeared that the government was willing
to incur no expense in conveying settlers to the new colony, or
in supplying them with necessaries after their arrival.
Encouragement, nevertheless, was offered to persons to proceed to
the Swan River in proportions of not less than five female, to
six male settlers, by promises of receiving grants proportioned
to the capital they might invest, the payment of passage being
included in such investment. This payment alone entitled the
party to an allowance of 200 acres of land, at a valuation of
1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per acre, the cost of conveyance being
estimated at 15<i>l</i>. each. It was determined that no convict
should be sent to this new settlement, and that the government
should be administered by Captain (Sir James) Stirling, R.N., as
civil superintendent, or lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>Immediately upon these intentions of government being made
known, four gentlemen * submitted to Sir George Murray a proposal
to send out a large body of emigrants to the settlement, on
condition of obtaining a proportionate grant of land there.
Certain modifications of this proposal were required by the
government, which were not acceptable to the associated
gentlemen, but were agreed to by Mr. Thomas Peel separately, who
ultimately undertook the responsibility of the enterprise. This
gentleman contracted to send out 400 settlers, on condition of
receiving a grant of half a million acres of land. An idea became
prevalent at the time that undue advantages had been conferred
upon him, in consequence of his relationship to a member of the
existing administration; but nothing could be more groundless
than such a suspicion, as may be seen from the terms of the
agreement (now open to the public **), and which were equally
availed of by Colonel Lautour and other persons, who also
embarked in the same enterprize.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Thomas Peel, Esquire, Sir Francis Vincent,
Bart., E. W. Schenley, and T. P. Macqueen, Esquires.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Major Irwin gives Mr. Peel credit for
introducing men of good conduct, who were well acquainted with
farming pursuits and trades; and for bringing into the colony
towards the fulfilment of his contract, a population of 300
souls, with a property of £.50,000.]</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, early in the year 1829, a number of
emigrants left England for Swan River, in Western Australia. They
began to arrive in the month of August in the same year, and were
located along the banks of the Swan and the Canning rivers. At
the close of the year, the number of settlers was 1290,
consisting of 850 residents, and 440 non-residents. The value of
property introduced, giving claims to grants of land, was
41,550<i>l</i>.; the extent of lands actually allotted was
525,000 acres; * the number of locations effected was 39: the
number of cattle imported 204; of horses, 57; of sheep, 1096; of
hogs, 106; and 25 ships had arrived in the settlement between the
months of June and December 1829.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A grant of 100,000 acres was made to Governor
Stirling, which was selected from the Isle of Buache (since named
Garden Island) containing from 8,000 to 9,000 acres, with a
limitation as to crown lands of a certain portion of the N.E. of
the island, and other parts convenient for government buildings;
and from 91,000 to 92,000 acres nearest to Cape Naturaliste in
Géographe Bay.]</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson, R.N., who arrived off Swan River on the 16th
October in that year, thus describes the condition of the infant
settlement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Full of surmises and conjectures, we arrived at, and
anchored in Gage's Roads, near the other ships, and were shortly
afterwards boarded by a well-dressed and smart-looking gentleman,
who immediately began to rate our poor <i>skipper</i> for not
having hove-to when he perceived nim endeavouring to reach the
vessel; but on receiving a short answer, his wrath began to
subside, and he was pleased to be communicative.<br>
<br>
"He told us that the governor resided at Perth, some distance up
the river, where the head-quarters were established; that another
river, named the <i>Murray</i>, had been recently discovered;
that a great number of settlers had already arrived from England,
most of whom yet resided at Freemantle,** the sea-port town; that
nineteen ships had entered the roads; that all the land on the
banks of the river was already given away; and that the
dismantled vessel (which we supposed might be the temporary abode
of the governor and other public officers) was the <i>Marquis of
Anglesey</i>, driven on shore in a N.W. gale. "At Perth,"
continues the Doctor, "we landed at a jetty of considerable
length. We found the governor on the point of starting with some
friends and attendants on an expedition up the river. He invited
Captain Barker and myself to join the party, but I declined the
honour, having met with an old friend. Lieutenant Roe, R.N., who
filled the situation of Surveyor-General.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; At
daylight I arose, and took a walk through the town; the intended
principal street of which, named St George's Terrace, where the
future beaux and belles of Western Australia may, in after times,
show off their reciprocal attractive charms&mdash;was, at
present, only adorned with lofty trees, and a variety of lovely
flowers. In my perambulations, I fell in with the <i>written</i>
*** newspaper of the place, appended to a stately eucalyptus
tree, where, among other public notices, I observed the
governor's permission for one individual to practise as a notary,
another as a surgeon, and a third as an auctioneer."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** So named, in compliment to Captain
Freemantle, of Her Majesty's ship <i>Challenger</i>, from the
circumstance of his having taken possession of it some time
before the arrival of Governor Stirling.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** A copy of an early number of the Perth
manuscript newspaper is in possession of Mr. J. Cross,
Holborn.]</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson next describes a levee of the governor, held in the
open air.</p>
<blockquote>"Many passengers had arrived by the <i>Atwick</i>,
who, it appeared, were now to be presented. The first was a
gigantic, fierce-looking gentleman, dressed, I suppose, in the
newest London fashion, who had been at some pains with his
toilette; and it was evident that he considered himself of no
small importance. I thought at first, that he was ill-adapted for
the line of life into which he was about to enter; but on further
consideration, I concluded that if he took as much pains to
cultivate the land, as he appeared to have successfully bestowed
on the culture of his whiskers, he might surpass those less
careful in their attire; especially as his martial frown might
tend to keep his servants in due obedience. Next came a
pert-looking, smartly-dressed gentleman, who seemed to plume
himself on his white kid gloves, neatly-tied cravat,
well-polished boots, and scented white handkerchief. I thought he
would have been more at home in distributing ribbons and lace to
the fair, than in growing corn, or wandering about the wilds of
Australia. Next came a stout-looking personage, having all the
appearance of a substantial English yeoman, whose jolly features,
albeit a little shrunk from his sea-fare, indicated a long
acquaintance with beef and ale. He had not half told his story,
when he was interrupted (contrary to all rules of etiquette) by
the dapper-looking gentleman, who, doubtless, thought his
conversation more agreeable to his Excellency. Then came a
modest-looking young man, who presented two letters to his
Excellency, and looked round the surrounding throng, with an
expression of face that seemed to say, "My fortune is made." He
appeared confirmed in this opinion, by a few civil words from his
Excellency, who put the letters in his pocket. Many more had an
interview; the greater part of whom did not appear adapted to
undergo the privations and fatigues necessarily attendant on
settling in a new country, even under the most favourable
circumstances. His Excellency was evidently tired before the
conclusion of the levee: his situation was certainly not much to
be envied. All the land on the banks of the Swan, of which they
naturally expected to obtain a slice, was already, and perhaps
improvidently, given away; therefore, although their own sanguine
expectations might have contributed to blind them, yet there
existed some legitimate cause for grumbling."</blockquote>
<p>Miss Roberts remarks upon the discontent of the early settlers
on finding so large a portion of the most promising land selected
and allotted to one individual before he left England:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The cry of 'Estate given away!'&mdash;'No good land
to be found!' had to be repeated over and over again before it
could be believed possible. The unexpected delay in getting
settled frittered away the limited property of many of the
emigrants; their provisions became exhausted before they could
renew the supply; and much hardship and privation were undergone.
The <i>Tranby people</i> were amongst the most provident and
successful of the early settlers." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Two Years at Sea</i>.]</p>
<p>In the course of two years, a settlement was completely
formed; and it may now be stated that it was securely
established, for without any external aid, and notwithstanding
very adverse measures proceeding from sources over which the
colonists had no controul, they have continued, up to the present
time, steadily to advance towards a state of internal prosperity
and independence.</p>
<p>Governor Stirling, after having devoted, for a period often
years, so much energy towards the establishment and advancement
of this colony, intimated, in 1837, his desire to return to
England. About the same time the governorship of Southern
Australia became vacant, and John Hutt, Esq. with the concurrence
of the South Australian Company, and of other parties in England
chiefly interested in the new colony, became a candidate for that
appointment; Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State for the
Colonies, acting, however, upon a recommendation of the South
Australian Commissioners, selected Colonel Gawler for that
office. His Lordship communicated this fact in his reply to Mr.
John Hutt, dated April 4, 1838, accompanied with a handsome
tribute to his capacity, and a voluntary proffer of the
government of <i>Western</i> Australia.</p>
<blockquote>"Adverting," observes his Lordship, "to the high
character of the testimonials transmitted in your letter, I shall
have great pleasure, if you will permit me, in submitting to the
Queen your name for the appointment of Governor of Western
Australia, which has recently become vacant by the resignation of
Sir James Stirling."</blockquote>
<p>This offer was consequently accepted.</p>
<p>On the 24th July, 1838, a public dinner was given by the
friends of the colony and of colonization to Governor Hutt, at
the Albion Hotel, Aldersgate Street, previously to his
departure.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, July 25,
1838.]</p>
<blockquote>"Lord <span class="uu">Worsley</span>, M.P., was in
the chair: supported on the right by the newly-appointed
Governor, J. Stephen, Esq., J. Sharp, Esq., and J. Irving, Esq.;
and, on the left, by the Earl of Lovelace, William Hutt, Esq.
M.P., Sir Thomas Barrett Lennard, Bart, and Sir J. Ommaney.<br>
<br>
"Among the company, which amounted to one hundred and twenty,
were also noticed Gordon Gardner, Esq., Rowland Hill, Esq.,
Richard Norman, Esq., A. Borrodaile, Esq., J. B. Lennard, Esq.,
C. Mangles, Esq., General Sandwith (H.E.I.C.S.), John Wright,
Esq., W. M. James, Esq., D. Wakefield, Esq., J. F. Maubert, Esq.,
J. Montefiore, Esq., Dr. Babington, T. Bland, Esq., Lewis Samson,
Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"The Right Honourable the <span class="uu">Chairman</span> opened
the proceeding by observing that the meeting had been convened
for a purpose likely to benefit their fellow creatures.<br>
<br>
"Mr. <span class="uu">Stephen</span> (Under Secretary for the
Colonies) adverted also to the objects that had brought the
company together that day. He had been (he said) nearly a quarter
of a century in the Colonial Office, and, in that time, had seen
reason to retract many of the opinions which he had formerly
entertained; among which were those on the subject of the
colonization of vacant and uncultivated territories. The opinion
which he had, at first, loosely taken up, had been adopted by
many honourable members, and especially, indeed, by Sir George
Murray, under whose immediate auspices the Colony of Western
Australia was formed; but he had no doubt that that eminent
person would now be ready to acknowledge that he had arrived at a
precipitate and erroneous conclusion on the subject Mr. Stephen
proceeded to remark that this colony, having a large territory
not acquired by purchase, had been for a long course of years
placed in embarrassments and difficulties which few would have
been able to contend with, and which none could have more bravely
battled than had these colonists. The difficulties which the
colonists had to contend with were such as only the Anglo-Saxon
race would have surmounted. An Englishman (he said) went about
his duty with a consciousness that he was able to perform it, and
he left his home for remote parts, to lay the foundations of
mighty empires, with a dignity and deliberation of which he (Mr.
Stephen) deemed his countrymen alone capable. Few, however, in
the colonies, had time to attend to public interests; the
colonists themselves were too much occupied with the urgency of
procuring the first necessaries of life, and in arranging their
domestic concerns, and they, therefore, threw on the Governor
more cares than were cast upon the Government in England. The
Governor was thus obliged to think for every one in public
concerns: there was with him a most severe exercise of the
understanding, and a Continual call upon-his kindness of heart
Therefore, it was, that he (Mr. Stephen) more deeply, and from
the bottom of his heart rejoiced, that the arduous and
responsible duties of this situation in Western Australia were
about to devolve upon one who was anxious for the prosperity of
the colony, and he was delighted to see the power conferred upon
such a person. He hoped, however, to see the Governor return with
health in nowise impaired, with spirits unbroken, and with his
fame established as a benefactor to that part of Australia in
which this colony was situated.<br>
<br>
"The noble <span class="uu">Chairman</span> expressed a hope that
the Governor would be enabled to promote the comfort and
prosperity of the settlers, and, when he came home, might point
with satisfaction to a flourishing colony, now <i>but little
known, but to which public attention was becoming awakened</i>.
He would caution all, however, against supposing that they could
go to Western Australia and readily make money without labour, or
prosper in idleness.<br>
<br>
"Mr. <span class="uu">Irving</span> observed, that already the
whale fishery in the colony was of so much importance, that it
had attracted the attention of the Americans.<br>
<br>
"Governor <span class="uu">Hutt</span>, in addressing the
meeting, passed some high encomiums on his predecessor. He then
said he was happy to see that gentlemen interested in different
colonies were likewise anxious for the success of Western
Australia. The new Governor concluded his address by declaring
that he should consider himself responsible for the prosperity of
the <i>aborigines</i>." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* <i>The Western Australian Journal, or Perth
Gazette</i>, of December 8, 1838, published at the Swan River,
contains the following notice: "Mr. John Hutt, the gentleman who
is appointed to relieve Sir James Stirling in the administration
of the government of this colony, was formerly Governor
(Collector) of North Arcot, a very important province in the
presidency of Madras. Private letters give us favourable hopes of
Mr. Hutt's abilities and disposition to advance the colony."<br>
<br>
And it is observed in the Spectator of June 2nd, 1838, that "the
strong recommendations of Mr. John Hutt for the office of
Governor of South Australia, appear to have impressed Lord
Glenelg with the necessity of employing his industry and ability
somewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is reason to hope that Mr. Hutt, if properly supported by
the Colonial Office here, will be enabled to establish a better
order of things in Western Australia. He will struggle with the
difficulties arising from the ignorance of the first founders,
and of former governments, and in a few years we may have the
satisfaction of knowing that two flourishing colonies, free from
the taint of negro and convict slavery, cheaply governed from
their own resources, and offering constantly increasing markets
for the products of British manufacturing industry, are
established on the lately wild and solitary shores of
Australia."]</p>
<p>Governor Hutt arrived in the Brothers, and landed at
Freemantle the 2nd January, 1839, entering upon his office just
one day after the ex-governor had taken leave of Perth, which was
on new year a day.</p>
<p>The appointment of his Excellency Governor Hutt, excited much
interest not only amongst his own personal friends at home, but
likewise among all who had the interest of the Swan River
Settlement at heart. Regretting as they did its languishing
condition, they determined to exert themselves strenuously to
remove some of the evils attendant on the unsound views of
colonization whereon that settlement had been established, and to
attempt, with all possible speed, to arouse the government to
sanction the application of those more correct principles which
had been successful beyond expectation in South Australia.</p>
<p>A meeting of such friends was consequently held, and pursuant
to resolutions they passed, a committee was appointed, consisting
of William Hutt, M.P., William Tanner, R. Norman, and James
Irving, Esquires, and Captain Mangles, for the purpose of
communicating with Lord Glenelg, the Secretary for the Colonies,
on the subject. Their views are developed in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"54, <i>Conduit
Street, May</i> 3, 1838.</div>
<br>
"<span class="uu">My Lord</span>,<br>
<br>
"A party of gentlemen, comprising nearly all the persons
interested in the Colony of Western Australia, who are now in
England, have requested me to transmit to your Lordship the
enclosed Resolutions, in which they unanimously concurred,
relative to certain measures which they would respectfully, but
very earnestly recommend to your Lordship's consideration for the
amelioration of that colony.<br>
<br>
"The question which has occupied these parties and myself is, how
to render this settlement as attractive to British capital and
labour as the other colonies of Australia.<br>
<br>
"In some respects the Western Colony of Australia is superior to
all the others, while in none does it appear inferior to any.
With a soil and climate equal, there is every reason to conclude,
to those of New South Wales, or South Australia, Western
Australia, from its greater proximity to the Indian Archipelago,
to India and China, and above all, to the Mother Country (where
capital and labour are equally superabundant) enjoys so great a
superiority of position that its very inferior progress would be
a matter of surprise, if the fact were not explained by certain
economical circumstances which are peculiar to this
settlement.<br>
<br>
"In Western Australia there never has been anything like a
constant supply of labour for hire. Without such a supply it is
impossible that capital should increase or even be preserved.
During nine years there has been, in this colony, a want of the
only means by which capital may be augmented.<br>
<br>
"Upon the whole, therefore, we are of opinion that the one thing
needful for placing Western Australia on a footing of equality
with the other Australian settlements, is,&mdash;measures that
shall provide a regular supply of labour in proportion to the
wants of the capitalists.<br>
<br>
"We are, however, satisfied that a mere emigration of labourers,
however extensive, would not accomplish the object in view. With
such excessive cheapness of land as exists in this colony, the
emigrant labourers would very quickly save from their wages the
means of becoming landowners, and thus, unless a fresh emigration
took place, the want of labour would be as much felt as ever; or
rather, it would be felt more severely, because some of those who
had recently been workmen for hire, would now be anxious to
obtain servants, and would, therefore, augment the general demand
for labour. Mere emigration, therefore, appears to us quite
inadequate to the object. We are of opinion that, along with the
emigration of labourers, it is indispensable to render land more
difficult of acquisition than it has hitherto been in this
colony.<br>
<br>
"We conceive that the directions given to Sir James Stirling, in
your Lordship's despatch of the 7th March, 1837,* will tend very
materially to establish this desirable state of things. Should
your Lordship's regulations, however, prove insufficient to bring
about a due price for land, we would beg to propose that a
portion of the then remaining grants should be purchased from the
settlers by the means hereafter referred to and
explained.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* See Land Regulations, Appendix, A.]</p>
<blockquote>"The next question is as to the means of raising the
sum required. Let it be assumed that a plan has been adopted,
whereby no land will ever be attainable in this colony for less
than 10<i>s</i>. per acre; in that case, we have reason to know,
that the future sales of land in the colony would be a sufficient
security whereon to raise funds, not only to pay for the land to
be resumed, but also for the emigration of labourers, so as
immediately to bring the whole system into operation.<br>
<br>
"Such, my Lord, is the general view which we take of a subject to
which our most serious attention has been directed.<br>
<br>
"Something, however, remains to be explained. In order that the
system should work well, we are of opinion that the
administration of it should be confided to some special
authority, the more responsible to Her Majesty's government the
better, but not otherwise occupied than with the sufficiently
difficult and troublesome task of endeavouring to place this
colony in a state of prosperity. The particular means by which we
should propose to give effect to our general views, are as
follow:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"<i>First</i>,&mdash;That the limits of the colony be defined by
Act of Parliament, so that the extent of land forming the
security for loans be settled and known.<br>
<br>
"<i>Secondly</i>,&mdash;That the Crown have authority to resume
such portions as may be deemed necessary of the lands now
occupied, paying for the same out of the funds so raised on such
loan.<br>
<br>
"<i>Thirdly</i>,&mdash;That all the Crown lands of the colony be
open to purchase as soon as surveyed, but never at a less price
than shillings per acre.<br>
<br>
"<i>Fourthly</i>,&mdash;That the proceeds of all the future sales
(excepting they be a security for the fund to pay for the land
resumed) shall be employed in defraying the cost of emigration to
the colony.<br>
<br>
"<i>Fifthly</i>,&mdash;That Commissioners be appointed to act
under the Colonial Department, and to carry the whole system into
effect, with power to sell land in England; to employ the
receipts in defraying the passage of such labourers as the
purchasers may wish to take to the colony; to raise loans for
emigration on the security of future sales, and to regulate the
emigration of labourers.<br>
<br>
"In taking the liberty of proposing these measures, we have
endeavoured to confine ourselves to points which appear to us of
essential importance, and we venture, most earnestly, to
recommend the whole subject to your Lordship's consideration,
being convinced, ourselves, that except by means of the adoption
of some such measures, this colony will not be relieved from its
present disparaging circumstances; but that if some plan of this
nature be adopted, and carefully carried into execution, Western
Australia may very soon become one of the most flourishing of Her
Majesty's foreign possessions.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">"I have the honour to be,</div>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"Your Lordship's
most humble and obedient Servant,</div>

<br>
<br>
"P.S.&mdash;Whenever it may be convenient to your Lordship, after
the perusal of these papers, to grant an interview to the
Committee named in one of the resolutions, Sie gentlemen
composing it trust they may be permitted to see your Lordship on
the subject of them."</blockquote>
<p>To the above Lord Glenelg replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"<i>Downing
Street, May</i> 22, 1838.</div>
<br>
<span class="uu">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I am directed by Lord Glenelg to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing resolutions adopted at a
meeting, held on the 2nd instant, of persons interested in the
colony of Western Australia. His Lordship desires me to convey
through you to those gentlemen his thanks for the trouble they
have taken in making these suggestions.<br>
<br>
"Lord Glenelg is fully aware of the extreme inconvenience
resulting from the system upon which the colony of Western
Australia was originally founded. The vast extent of territory
granted without purchase to different individuals his Lordship
believes scarcely less injurious to the grantees themselves than
to the colony to which they resorted. Grants, however, confirmed
are held under a title which it would be impossible to set aside,
except with the concurrence of the proprietors. It was with a
view to remedy this evil as far as possible, and to remove what
appeared to his Lordship the great barrier to the improvement of
the colony, that the instructions contained in his despatch of
the 7th March, 1837, were addressed to Sir James Stirling. The
result of these instructions has not yet been reported by the
Governor, but his report may be daily expected; and should it not
be satisfactory, Lord Glenelg will be prepared to consider any
other proposal which may afford a prospect of effecting the
object, with a due regard to those individual interests which
have been long since created.<br>
<br>
"It does not appear to Lord Glenelg necessary to resort to
Parliament in order to define the limit of the colony. This is an
ancient branch of the royal prerogative, which might be exercised
in the case of Western Australia as conveniently and
efficaciously as it has been exercised in former and in modern
times in the case of almost every other British colony. It seems,
however, to be supposed that a parliamentary definition of these
limits is required, in order that the contractors for loans on
the future territorial revenue may have a satisfactory guarantee
as to the extent of the territory whence the revenue is to be
drawn. But if it should be desirable to raise such loans, the
lenders would possess a perfectly valid and satisfactory pledge,
if possessed of the assurance of the Crown, that until the loans
were paid off, the limits of the colony should not be reduced
within certain prescribed lines of latitude and longitude. The
regulation which is proposed, that all the Crown lands should be
open as soon as surveyed to purchase at a fixed minimum price,
has long since been established by Her Majesty's Government.<br>
<br>
"The peculiar obstacles to which reference has been made
affecting Western Australia, have in a great measure prevented
the beneficial operation of the system in that colony; but Lord
Glenelg trusts that the measures already taken, accompanied by an
increase in the minimum price of land, which his Lordship
proposes to effect, will tend to the rapid supply of labour, and
to the consequent development of the resources of the colony.<br>
<br>
"Although fully prepared to admit the expediency of defraying the
cost of emigration to the colony from the proceeds of land
sales,&mdash;a system which is now operating most advantageously
in New South Wales,&mdash;Lord Glenelg is not prepared to
acquiesce in the propriety of prescribing the exclusive
application of those proceeds to that single object, in terms so
unqualified as you have suggested.<br>
<br>
"Lord Glenelg is not convinced of the necessity for the
appointment of Commissioners for carrying this system into
effect. No proof exists of the inadequacy of the means at present
at the command of Her Majesty's Government as it respects the
older Australian colonies; and the expense of creating a distinct
office for the service of Western Australia would be a serious
objection to the proposal, unless its necessity were clearly
established. I am to add that Lord Glenelg will be happy to
receive yourself and the other gentlemen named in one of the
resolutions, on Thursday, the 24th instant, at eleven
o'clock.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>This refusal on the part of the Government to sanction the
views of the committee did not deter them from further exertions
to carry their object into effect. Repeated interviews and
correspondence with the Colonial Secretary on the subject took
place, and various plans were submitted, by which, as it appeared
to the committee, the interests of the colony might have been
promoted; but Lord Glenelg's views were different, and all hopes
of support from the Government in the formation of a company for
the acquirement of public lands in Western Australia, and the
transmission of emigrants thither, were for a time put an end to
by a communication from the Colonial Office, dated 5th January,
1839. Upon the seals of the Colonial Office being delivered to
Lord John Russell, the committee renewed their exertions, and on
the 6th July, 1839, William Hutt, Esq. laid the following
proposals before the Colonial Secretary.</p>
<blockquote>"1. That any person depositing with the Agent-general
for the colonies the sum of 20<i>l</i>. shall become entitled
thereupon to a corresponding credit in the purchase of land in
the colony; and further, upon the introduction of any qualified
labourer, male or female, into the colony (the qualifications
requisite being hereafter defined), the depositor or his assignee
will be entitled to claim from the Colonial Treasurer re-payment
of the 20<i>l</i>. deposited.<br>
<br>
"2, That in the present weak state of the Survey Department,
persons desirous of purchasing land in the districts at present
unsurveyed, be permitted to put up at any time any portions
therein, not less than five or ten square miles, provided they
furnish private surveys, or accurate descriptions of the land
they desire to purchase; the expense of such surveys, &amp;c.
being defrayed out of the proceeds of the sale, whether the
applicant be the eventual purchaser or not.<br>
<br>
"3. That the necessity of a second auction, where the lands
remain unsold after the first exhibition at public sale, be
dispensed with, and such unsold lands be disposable to any
persons offering the minimum price."</blockquote>
<p>Prompt attention having been given to these proposals by Lord
John Russell, certain rules were drawn up in the Emigration
Office, and the Lords of the Treasury notified that they did not
object to the adoption, for the present, of the arrangement
respecting bounties on the introduction of emigrants by
purchasers of land in Western Australia; but they had to suggest
that in the event of any extensive demand arising for land in
that settlement, care should be taken that a sufficient portion
of the purchase-money be reserved to defray all charges for the
survey of allotments, and the perfecting the titles to them. The
following were the rules finally established by the Government,
who issued their instructions accordingly to his Excellency
Governor Hutt:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Bounty on Emigrants introduced by purchasers of land
in Western Australia.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%;">"<i>Government
Emigration Office</i>,</div>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">2, <i>Middle
Scotland Yard, October</i> 12, 1839.</div>
<br>
<br>
"1. With a view to promoting the improvement of Western
Australia, it has been determined, with the sanction of Her
Majesty's Government, that all persons who may hereafter buy
lands in that settlement shall be allowed, out of the proceeds of
their purchases, a bounty on the introduction of useful labourers
into the colony.<br>
<br>
"2. As there is no accumulated fund now existing in the colony,
and the bounty can only be paid out of the accruing land
revenues, its application cannot be made retrospective, or be
extended to parties in respect of purchases already made in
Western Australia. It will only be claimable in regard to all
future purchases.<br>
<br>
"3. In order to enable parties resident in England to take
advantage of the present measure, they will be at liberty to
deposit money with Mr. Barnard, in this country, for the purchase
of land in Western Australia, upon which they will become at once
entitled to propose a corresponding number of emigrants to go out
to the colony upon bounty.<br>
<br>
"4. The proper course of proceeding in acting upon the foregoing
article, will be to attend at Mr. Barnard's office. No. 2,
Parliament Street, to make such deposit as the party may wish, in
sums not less than 100<i>l</i>. or a given number of hundreds of
pounds, on which a receipt will be furnished for the payment, and
advice will be sent to the colony, directing credit to be allowed
for the same amount in any purchase of land effected in the
regular way by the depositor, or his agent.<br>
<br>
"5. In case, however, the depositor does not intend to make the
purchase himself, it will be necessary, in order that the
Government may not become involved in disputes as to agency, that
the person to whom credit is intended to be given, should be
expressly named at the time that the deposit is made.<br>
<br>
"6. The present notice will take effect in England from the date
it bears; and in the colony, from the date of its reaching the
Governor, when it is to be immediately published.<br>
<br>
"7. Purchasers or depositors are to be entitled to claim bounty
on emigrants introduced by them, if coming within the description
presently to be specified, at the rate of one adult person of 15
years and upwards, two children between seven and fifteen, or
three children between one and seven, for every 20<i>l</i>. which
they pay.<br>
<br>
"8. The amount of the bounty is to be 18<i>l</i>. for every
person of fifteen and upwards, 10<i>l</i>. for every child
between seven and fifteen, and 5<i>l</i>. for every child between
one and seven. Infants less than twelve months old are not to be
paid for.<br>
<br>
"9. The following is to be the description of people for whom
bounty shall be claimable. They must belong to the class of
mechanics, handicrafts-men, agricultural labourers, or useful
domestic servants. Persons proposing to invest a small capital in
land or in trade are quite inadmissible.<br>
<br>
"10. They must principally consist of married people and their
families.<br>
<br>
"11. Single women, without their parents, are only admissible if
they are emigrating under the immediate care of some married
relatives, or else attached as domestic servants to ladies going
out as cabin passengers in the same ship.<br>
<br>
"12. Single men can only be allowed in a number not exceeding
that of the single women, proposed by the same person under the
preceding clause.<br>
<br>
"13. The age of the adults is not to exceed forty, unless in
special cases, where a large family, all of them grown up to
useful ages, may appear to justify a relaxation of this rule in
favour of the parents. The Board named in article 18 is to decide
on the admission or rejection of this ground of exception in
particular cases.<br>
<br>
"14. Good character, and decisive written testimonials, both to
respectability of character and to capacity in the professed
trade or calling will be indispensable.<br>
<br>
"15, The bounty will only be payable for parties actually landed
in the colony. No money can be issued for emigrants who may die
on the passage.<br>
<br>
"16. The emigrants must arrive in the colony within the period of
three years from the date of the payment, whether in the colony
or at home, which constitutes the claim, and after that period
the claim will be at an end.<br>
<br>
"17. It will be necessary that the purchaser, or depositor, or
his authorised agent, should, on the arrival of any emigrants
introduced for his account, affix a certificate to a list of
them, declaring that he applies for bounty to be paid for those
persons.<br>
<br>
"18. The emigrants are to appear before such Board or Officer as
may be appointed for the purpose by the Governor, in order to let
it be ascertained that they fall within the preceding
description, and that in all respects they comply with the
regulations laid down in this notice; and the payment of bounty
is to be absolutely subject to the conclusion of this authority
that the parties are properly entitled to it. As soon as the
Board, or Officer, as the case may be, is satisfied that the
emigrants are of the right characters, descriptions, and ages
(which latter point should, as far as possible, be supported by
baptismal certificates in all cases where doubts are likely to
suggest themselves), a certificate will be given to that efiect,
stating the amount of the bounty claimable for the particular
party of emigrants, and the same will be paid immediately to the
master of the vessel in which they arrived.<br>
<br>
"19. This notice, so far as regards payments and deposits, to be
in force in this country for two years from its date; and in the
colony, for two years from the date of its publication by the
Governor.<br>

</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In a letter from Mr. Stephen of the Colonial Office, dated
23rd October, 1839, to Mr. Elliot, he states that Lord John
Russell had addressed an instruction to the Governor of Western
Australia, containing the following modification of the above
regulations.</p>
<blockquote>"That if any person shall demand a survey of not less
than five square miles, and the Government surveyors shall be too
much occupied to perform that duty within a month from the date
of the application, and if the applicant shall name a private
surveyor, whom the Governor shall approve as a competent,
impartial, and trustworthy person for the service, and the
surveyor so named shall be willing to undertake it, at a
reasonable and moderate rate of remuneration, to be previously
determined by the Governor, such remuneration being of course
considerably less in amount than the purchase-money, then the
Governor shall devolve the duty of making the proposed special
survey on the person so to be nominated, who shall, however, have
no claim on the Government, but merely on the applicant; the
amount of which claim the applicants, on proof that they have
paid it, shall be at liberty to deduct from the price of the
land.<br>
<br>
"That with regard to the measure of dispensing with the necessity
of a second auction, where lands remain unsold after the first
exhibition, there will be no objection to the sale of lands under
such circumstances at the minimum price, or at such enhanced
price, as under peculiar circumstances may be considered fair and
reasonable; subject, however, always to the condition, that the
total amount of land which should be at any one time purchaseable
from the Government, either on those terms or by auction, should
never in the whole amount to such an excess as may prevent the
selling price from rising just above the upset price."
*</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Report on Emigration; ordered to be printed
10th March, 1840, p. 41.]</p>
<p>To prevent any future misunderstanding, the Western Australian
Committee on the 14th November, 1839, requested explanation on
the following points:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1. Is it to be understood, that when an applicant,
with the Governor's assent, undertakes the survey of a block of
land of five or more square miles, that the block is to be put up
for sale in the mass, or in sections?<br>
<br>
"2. Is it proposed to put up land, so surveyed, at the existing
minimum price of land generally, or is the upset price to be
determined by the Governor in each particular case after
application?<br>
<br>
"3. Is it proposed to delay sales, after the surveys are
completed, for indefinite periods, or to cause them to take
effect at any given interval after notification of survey; say,
for instance, one month?<br>
<br>
"4. Is it to be understood that the applicant is to defray the
expense of surveys, and not to be indemnified for the cost, if he
should not become the eventual purchaser at auction; or is it
intended, that provided he bid the minimum price, he will be
reimbursed the expenses of the survey, whoever may be the
successful competitor?<br>
<br>
"5. Is the power reserved to the Governor to limit the quantity
of land for sale, and to enhance the upset price, if he think
fit, to be exercised in respect to applications, by public
notices and general regulations previously issued?"</blockquote>
<p>On the 4th December, 1839, Mr. R. Vernon Smith, sent the
following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1. It is not intended, under the circumstances to
which you refer, to authorise a special survey of more than five
square miles; but the block to that extent, when surveyed, will
be put up to sale in the mass.<br>
<br>
"2. The land will be put up for sale at the existing minimum
price, or at any other general minimum price which may be
hereafter established.<br>
<br>
"3. Some definite time will be limited by the Governor and
Council, after the completion of the survey, within which time
the land will be put up for sale.<br>
<br>
"4. If the land, when surveyed, is not sold, the applicant will
bear the expense of the survey; but if sold, either to him or any
one else, an allowance will be made equal to the amount of the
charge which would have been incurred by the Government if the
survey had been made in the ordinary course of settlement. It
should be understood, however, that in case of special surveys,
the Government will be responsible only for the expense of
ascertaining the exterior boundaries, and not for the expense of
running or ascertaining any interior division lines.<br>
<br>
"5. With regard to the question, whether the power reserved to
the Governor to limit the quantity of land for sale, and to
enhance the upset price if he think fit, is to be exercised in
respect to applications by public notices and general regulations
previously issued; Lord John Russell understands that question to
mean whether, if an application for a special survey be made in
reference to regulations in force at the time of the application,
it will be competent to the Government to alter those
regulations, so as to exclude the applicant from having the
survey made on the terms contemplated in his offer. On this, his
Lordship said, that if the applicant for a special survey will
bind himself to become the purchaser so soon as the survey can be
effected, and will either deposit the purchase-money, or give
adequate security for the payment of it, then his title would not
be defeated by any intervening regulations; but a mere offer, by
which the applicant is not bound, could not be admitted to bind
the Government to adhere to the then existing terms of the sale,
if the public interest should require a change in those terms."

<p class="foot">[* Report on Emigration; ordered to be printed
10th March, 1840, p. 42.]</p>
<br>
<p>The first warrant appointing "The Colonization Commissioners
of South Australia, was revoked and a new one issued on the 10th
January, 1840, nominating Robert Torrens and Thomas Frederick
Elliot, Esquires, and the Hon. Edward Ernest Villiers, to such
Commission, under the Act of Parliament. The same day these
gentlemen were also appointed by the Queen "The Colonial Land and
Emigration Commissioners." On the 14th of the same month. Lord
John Russell transmitted the latter Commission with instructions
** to the following purport:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Colonial Land Board; ordered to be printed
4th Feb. 1840, p. 2.]</p>
<br>
<blockquote>That having consolidated the duties of the South
Australian Commissioners and the agent-general for emigration to
a board of three persons, he for the present declined explaining,
further than had already been previously done, their duties as
Colonization Commissioners for South Australia; but addressing
himself to their duties in their other capacity of a General
Board for the sale of lands and for promoting emigration, he
arranges such duties under the four heads:&mdash;<i>first</i>,
the collection and diffusion of accurate statistical knowledge;
<i>secondly</i>, the sale in this country of waste lands in the
colonies; <i>thirdly</i>, the application of the proceeds of such
sales towards the removal of emigrants; and, <i>fourthly</i>, the
rendering of periodical accounts, both pecuniary and statistical,
of their administration of this trust Copious instructions are
given under each of these heads, the substance of which is that
Government should not promote emigration without first supplying
authentic information for the guidance of the emigrant; that the
inquiries of applicants are to be answered, Government not being
held responsible for the accuracy of such answers; that they
should diffuse compendious accounts of the agriculture, commerce,
natural products, physical structure, and ecclesiastical and
political institutions of each of the colonies wherein they may
offer lands for sale; that unoccupied lands in the Colony are by
law vested in the Crown, and that every private title must rest
upon a royal grant as its basis; such lands being held in trust
for the public good; that ministers are responsible for its
proper appropriation, which is declared to be, public works in
the Colony, for Colonial Government and for Emigration. That the
respective Governors of the colonies (not the Commissioners)
would convey waste lands to the purchasers, such Governors would
still make contracts for sale of land, but would act concurrently
with the Commissioners: reference is then made to other colonies,
where the land is wholly or partially granted, but the Australian
colonies are pointed out as the principal field for their
operations. The principle which distinguishes exclusively South
Australia in the disposal of laud is then recommended. His
Lordship also suggests that officers should be employed to select
the emigrants, the most eligible being young married couples
without children; that due care should be taken with respect to
the ships, medical attendance, and that the emigrants should be
provided for after they arrived in the colony for a period of
seven or fourteen days. The Commissioners are finally instructed
to report at least twice a year, and as occasion may require. In
the above instructions Lord John Russell states, that "the plan
of selling at one uniform price per acre, was established in
South Australia, while in New South Wales and <i>Western
Australia</i>, Government <i>had sanctioned and adopted</i> the
plan of sales by auction at an upset price of 12<i>s. per
acre</i>.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Mr. Irving having applied to the Colonial Land and Emigration
Commissioners, to know if 12<i>s</i>. per acre was the present
established upset price of Government Lands in Western Australia;
and if the Commissioners intended to recommend an immediate
change in the mode of selling such lands, either with regard to
the upset price or the substitution of a fixed price instead of
by auction; their reply of the 21st March, 1840, signed by John
Walpole, Esq., was that&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"The Governor of Western Australia had been for some
time in possession of authority to raise the upset price to
12<i>s</i>. at his discretion, but that no information had been
received that he had made use of that power. Instructions however
had then been given to raise the price to 12<i>s</i>. positively,
and they would be sent to the colony by the first opportunity;
also, with respect to the mode of sale, if any change should be
recommended by that Board, and sanctioned by the Secretary of
State, immediate notice of it would be given to the public; but
that meanwhile the Commissioners could only say that sale by
auction continued to be, as it had been, the established rule of
proceeding in Western Australia."<br>
[<span class="uu">ADDENDUM</span>: The remaining 500 acres of
Town Land are now selling in sections, at 10<i>l</i>. per quarter
acre. See Appendix, G.]</blockquote>
<p>This outline of the history of Western Australia, as respects
the means which have been attempted for its improvement, is given
as introductory to the announcement of the fact, that a company,
under the denomination of the "Western Australian Company," has
now been established for the purpose of investing capital in the
purchase and re-sale of lands upon the pledge of Her Majesty's
Government to apply in this older colony the principles of
colonization which have had such eminent success in South
Australia. This company has purchased extensive tracts of land in
the colony, and amongst them an extensive grant in the maritime
county of Wellington, near the junction of the Collie and the
Brunswick rivers, which discharge themselves into Leschenault
inlet, at the mouth of which there is a safe and commodious
roadstead. On this grant the company propose to found a town to
be called Australind, the site of which has been chosen for its
fitness with respect to naval and commercial advantages, the
fertility of the adjoining country, and the beautiful scenery
which it commands. These advantages they expect will ultimately
render Australind the commercial capital of the colony. A body of
colonists are preparing to emigrate thither, under the auspices
of the Company. The Company, possessing 170,000 acres of this
territory, are disposing of 50,500 acres, whereof 500 (part of
1000,) are to be appropriated for the new town of Australind.
Each lot is to consist of 100 acres of country land, together
with one acre of town land, and the price at which it is to be
sold is 101<i>l</i>., or 20<i>s</i>. the acre, the company
pledging themselves to apply one-half of the purchase-money
received by them to provide for the conveyance of emigrants as
labourers to Australind, whereby the value of the land so
disposed of will be greatly enhanced: the remaining half of the
purchase money will be reserved to meet the Company's expenses.
The comparative shortness of passage and cheapness of conveyance
to Western Australia, enables this Company to accomplish its
object of transmitting labourers for 50 per cent. on the
purchase-money, whilst the expense to New South Wales and New
Zealand absorbs 60 per cent. of the money raised by land sales in
those more remote settlements.</p>
<p>Here it may be well to explain how the existence of a great
Land and Colonization Company in England promotes the welfare of
colonists embarking under its auspices. It is unquestionable that
the public is best served by individual competition in many
branches of human industry, and it is also equally indubitable
that there are many objects which can scarcely be accomplished by
<i>individual</i> effort, however strenuous or efficient; amongst
these may be mentioned government, religion, beneficent and
scientific institutions, the construction of roads, embankments,
harbours, docks, canals, railways, bridges, churches, and other
public edifices; and lastly, although not the least important,
the transplanting into a new country a society complete and
perfect in all its grades, due regard being had to the political
and economical elements of human wealth and happiness
therein.</p>
<p>A company embarking in any enterprise does so mainly with a
view to the promotion of the advantage of its members, and in the
case of a body formed for the purchase and re-sale of lands and
conveyance of emigrants, this view to individual advantage can be
in no way more surely promoted than by attention to measures
calculated to advance the general welfare and success of the
settlers. Complaints of dissatisfied persons will, under any
circumstances, occasionally arise; and in a new state of society
in a country only partially redeemed from the wilderness, with a
comparatively small number of neighbours, without the elegancies
or even sometimes the conveniences of life, some lingering desire
for the enjoyments of the mother country may be awakened in the
breast of the new settler; but it is the interest as well as duty
of a Land and Emigration Company to overcome such natural
feelings by conducing in every practicable way to the substantial
benefit of the settler in an obvious mode. If, on the contrary,
discontent and dissatisfaction are strengthened by inattention to
the welfare of the colonists, the report of it in the mother
country stops immigration into the settlement, capital and labour
cease to flow thither; and the settlers, equally with the
company, are sufferers by their unfortunate investments.</p>
<p>It is well known that projects of the most obviously useful
character are not only delayed in their execution, but wholly
frustrated from the want of cordial co-operation: "what is every
body's business is nobody's:" whilst this is the case in a
country already greatly overstocked with capital and labour, the
same want of public spirit and ability of co-operation must
necessarily be much more seriously felt in a new and
thinly-peopled country, where labour is generally deficient, and
where capital is fully employed at high rates of interest.
Objects of pressing moment and of the most obvious utility to the
settlement are thereby left unaccomplished, and the tendency of
civilization to advance is stayed. But a largo company of landed
proprietors, comprising men of large fortunes and great
influence, intelligent, honourable, and public spirited, will,
for their own sakes, gladly aid in various ways every object of
utility to the colony, and will, by their combined sagacity,
often provide beforehand for such objects; nay, even before the
necessity of them has occurred to the settler himself.</p>
<p>Such a company not engaging themselves in competition with the
settler, but acting always in co-operation with him as a powerful
ally, cannot be otherwise than of he greatest advantage to the
colony.</p>
<p>The selection of individuals of the best morals and of the
most useful and eligible classes,&mdash;a selection made from
abundant materials for choice,&mdash;is another benefit of the
highest importance to a new settlement. So also is their
attention to the health and age of the emigrants, to the numbers
of the sexes, to the promotion of marriage by worthy, but poor
persons, and the placing of them in a position soon to command
independence.</p>
<p>The capitalist adventuring money in the purchase of lands in
the colony has the satisfaction to know that no great
deterioration <i>can</i> possibly thereafter take place in the
value of such lands; for the moment any discontented settlers
should feel inclined to sell them, the same moment a company with
an abundant and immediately available capital are ready to
purchase; it being manifestly their interest that the price of
land should steadily rise.</p>
<p>The whole settlement and the whole body of shareholders at
home will concur and heartily combine to work for their
individual and general advantage: thereby accomplishing what it
would be idle to expect from uncertain, uncombined, and desultory
immigration, regardless of every principle needful for the
welfare and happiness of a colony. Here is no "squatting," no
revertence to semi-barbarism in desolate and uncleared
wildernesses, no destitution of civil, religious, and scientific
communion: but, at once, the <i>élite</i> of our society are
removed in a complete and perfect state as such, into a
<i>new</i> country indeed, but one where all their energies can
be successfully exercised. This could not be accomplished
otherwise than by the aid of a great company.</p>
<p>Another of the advantages arising from a large body so
constituted, is the acquiring of the latest and best information
on all matters relating to the colony, and the candid
communication of such information and intelligence to every one
interested therein.</p>
<p>To the benefits above glanced at it will not escape notice
that the following may be added;&mdash;most of these companies
having in their direction gentlemen connected with one or both
houses of parliament, and with the great commercial and
agricultural communities, no circumstance affecting the interests
of a colony in which they are interested will escape observation;
on the contrary, such will be narrowly watched, precautions will
be taken to avert any measure of evil tendency, and to facilitate
the advancement of beneficial ones; the influence of such persons
not being perhaps in any case wholly futile. As the colonist
looks to his mother-country for political government, so will he
regard with kindred feelings the parent company under whose
auspices he embarked himself and capital, for that aid and
guidance in cases of doubt and difficulty, which will be
cheerfully awarded. And as the company exists also by their
authorized agents in the colony, they are ever alive to events
passing therein, bearing on their interests, which are identical
with those of the settler; nothing either there or at home can
escape the general vigilance in promotion of every measure
conducive to the advancement of the colony and the happiness and
prosperity of the colonists.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="negindent2">GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION AND EXTENT OF WESTERN
AUSTRALIA&mdash;ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY&mdash;GEOLOGICAL
CHARACTER.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Australia</span> is situated in the Southern
Hemisphere, lying between latitude 10° and 40° south, and between
longitude 113° and 154° east. It is washed by the waters of the
Indian Ocean on the west, and by the Pacific on the east; having
China about 30° to the northward, from which it is separated by
the Eastern Archipelago, including the magnificent islands of
Java, Sumatra, and Borneo.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Western Australia</span>, as defined by Her
Majesty's commission, comprehends all that portion of New Holland
which is situate to the westward of the 129th degree of east
longitude, making its greatest extent from north to south about
1280 miles, and its extreme breadth from east to west 800 miles,
a territory as large as France and Spain united, although the
settled district is at present comprised between 32° and 35°
south latitude. This portion of Australia is not only within a
few days' sail of the Malaccas, but may be reached from Bombay
and the Mauritius in three weeks, and from the Cape of Good Hope,
Ceylon and Madras within a month. It is nearer to England than
Van Diemen's Land, Port Jackson, and Sydney, by from 2,000 to
3,000 miles, or by a passage of from four to six weeks.</p>
<p>All the best authorities concur in describing the position of
Western Australia as equal if not superior in a commercial point
of view to that of the other settlements on this continent.</p>
<p>Sir J. Stirling, in a dispatch dated 20th January, 1830,
observes that</p>
<blockquote>"The position which this settlement occupies, with
reference to the trade of these seas, has been in some measure
shown by the arrival of ships from various parts of the world;
some of these, from England, have landed all their cargoes here,
but the greater part have called without inconvenience, and have
disposed of part of their passengers and cargo here, and have
then proceeded on their routes; two vessels have gone hence to
the Malay Islands," &amp;c.</blockquote>
<p>Captain (now Major) Irwin says * that</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>The State and Position of Western
Australia</i>, &amp;c. By Captain F. C. Irwin. London, 1835.]</p>
<blockquote>"The great advantages which Western Australia derives
from its position will be obvious from a glance at a map of the
world; but persons acquainted with the coasts of New Holland, and
the monsoons that blow in the Indian seas, will be better able to
appreciate how much it is favoured as to situation.<br>
<br>
"The north-west winds prevail from March till September.<br>
<br>
"The passage to and from the Mauritius is favourable throughout
the year.<br>
<br>
"The season most propitious for making a voyage from the colony
itself to India is from the beginning of April to the beginning
of September. By leavings Swan River during that period a vessel
immediately gets into the south-east trade wind, which carries
her across the line, when she meets with the south-west monsoon,
that takes her at once to Madras. At this season fine weather may
be reckoned upon for the whole of the way."</blockquote>
<p>The very essential point, then, of the advantageous relative
position of Western Australia would appear to be satisfactorily
and indisputably established.</p>
<p>The country near the sea generally presents either an open
forest, plains covered with short brushwood mixed with grass, or
open downs. Numerous lakes, fresh and salt, extend along the
coast, and on the south-western shore there is a succession of
estuaries, or inlets, (each a receptacle of several rivers,) as
those of Wilson, Parry, Irwin, Broke, Augusta, Hardy, Vasse,
Leschenault, and Peel, all situate between King George's Sound
and the estuary called Melville Waters, which receives the Swan
and Canning Rivers in lat. 32° 2', and long. 115° 40'. The banks
of the rivers, especially the Swan, Collie and Brunswick, present
scenery much admired by all who have visited the country. In some
parts both borders exhibit extensive meadows, ornamented with
trees and flowering shrubs. Elsewhere, precipitous banks look
down on grassy plains on the opposite side. Those banks are
enamelled with a profusion of the amaranthine tribe of plants
(the <i>everlasting</i> flower), and are fringed with noble
mahogany and other lofty trees.</p>
<p>Eastward of the Swan River, at a distance of thirty-five or
forty miles from the coast, a range of hills, called the
<i>Darling</i>, crowned with ever verdant mahogany trees, runs
nearly the whole length of the present settlement, varying from
800 to 1,600 feet above the level of the sea; with two
predominant mountains, St. Anne's and Mount William, which are
computed to reach an altitude of nearly 3,000 feet. This range
meets the sea at Cape Chatham in 35° 1' S. lat. and 116° 30' E.
long., and its average width is from 30 to 40 miles. Besides
this, there are two other ranges of mountains of primitive
formation; the highest and easternmost having its termination
near King George's Sound in 35° S. lat. and 118° E. long.; * and
the most inferior in altitude and extent having its southern
boundary at Cape Leeuwin, in 34° 20' S. lat. and 115° E. long.,
disappearing at Cape Naturaliste, and shewing itself again at
Moresby's flat-topped range, about half way between Swan River
and Shark's Bay.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The chain called Koikyennuruff is highrer than
the Darling Range, one of its peaks, Toolbrunnup, attaining the
elevation of at least 3,000 feet.]</p>
<p>Disappointment has been felt by fanning emigrants, at first
sight of some of the Australian shores, since they appear too
sandy for agricultural purposes; ** but a view of the coast, as
they have afterwards discovered, is no criterion of the quality
of land in the interior, where, in many parts, according to Major
Irwin, the scenery is beautiful, the undulations of hill and dale
exhibiting a rich and cheerful aspect. Dense forests of the
majestic mahogany tree present themselves in some districts, and
gigantic gum trees (<i>Eucalyptus</i>) of several species, 150
feet high, and girth 25 to 40 feet, abound in others; the elegant
<i>Casuarina</i> flourishes in the swamps; the <i>Banksia</i>, 50
feet high, decorates the drier soil, and the remarkable forms of
the <i>Kingia Australis</i> (grass-tree), the <i>Xanthorr&oelig;a
hastile</i>, and the <i>Zamia spiralis</i> display themselves in
every direction, and impart a striking peculiarity to the
scenery. Valleys and luxuriant pastures spread themselves through
various districts, and especially in those of the south-west,
where pools of fresh water, springs, rivulets, and brooks are of
frequent occurrence, their presence being attested by the lively
verdure of the vegetation. The banks of the rivers are, in many
places, picturesque, and flowers of all hues, paint the
landscape, charm every eye with their beauty, and beguile the
fatigue of the traveller. In many places, the shores are covered
with rushes of great height and thickness. Prodigious thistles
and ferns are met with eleven or twelve feet in height. Thickets
of Acacia and Cypress contribute to variegate the scene. The
summits of hills are studded with magnificent <i>Angophoras</i>;
and the botanist notices in his rambles the different species of
<i>Leptospermum, Metrosideros, Melaleuca</i> (or Australian
tea-tree), <i>Viminaria, Daviesia, Anthropodium</i> and
<i>Anigozanthus</i>, with many other plants and flowering
shrubs.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sand in this country is not of necessity an
indication of sterility, for it appears from Captain (now Major)
Irwin, that&mdash;"the sandy lands, which have more or less loam
in them, are becoming more valued every year, and heavy crops of
wheat and barley have been had from them with the aid of very
little manure." Further:&mdash;"The productive powers of even
inferior sandy soils are often extraordinary, and show what the
combination of heat and moisture may effect in this country."
&amp;c. p. 10.]</p>
<p>The immediate vicinity of Leschenault is remarkable for the
beauty of its scenery, the fertility of its soil, and the
superior quality of the timber. The rivers which flow into the
inlet are navigable for some miles, and never dry. They are
skirted by rich pastures covered with lucerne and other
esculents, and present sites unusually favorable for stock and
grain farms.</p>
<p>Dr. Lhotsky observes that Australian sky and nature yet await
real artists to pourtray them, the enchantment-like appearance of
the forests defying description. Miles of the country are
covered, he says, with ornamental shrubs and flowers; and the
foliage, which is of every variety of colour, is seen in
perfection under the serene azure of the morning and evening
skies.</p>
<p>No volcano * has yet been discovered in Western Australia; in
which particular it offers a marked contrast to New Zealand. All
the usual formations are found, but they seem to occur without
order, and in defiance of all known geological laws in the Old
World. Oxley observes that</p>
<p class="foot">[* An extinct volcano has been discovered in
South Australia in S. lat. 37° 52' 29" and long, about 142° 20'
E. It is called Mount Napier, and vesicular lava is abundant in
its neighbourhood.]</p>
<blockquote>"The whole form, character, and composition of this
country is so singular, that a conjecture is hardly hazarded
before it is overturned; every thing seems to run counter to the
ordinary course of nature in Other countries."</blockquote>
<p>The whole of the territory yet occupied, or explored, appears
to rest upon a granitic base, which assumes the stratified form
of gneiss, near Doubtful Island Bay.* Basaltic rocks, resembling
those existing on the north coast of Ireland, are found in
Géographe Bay; ** and other basaltic formations are by no means
infrequent. The base of the steep rocks which overhang the beach
in the vicinity of Cape Naturaliste is formed of immense beds of
granite and schist, passing alternately into each other, and
presenting in their dip an angle of inclination of fifteen
degrees. They enclose, in many instances, large masses of
extraordinary aggregate, containing petrifactions of bivalve and
other marine shells, every particle of which is thickly incrusted
with primate crystals. Veins of iron, of considerable thickness,
traverse the rock in various directions, as well as immense beds
of feldspar. The granite is covered by a bed of micacious schist,
in an advanced stage of decomposition, over which are a number of
cavernous apertures in a bed of decomposed pudding-stone,
containing modules of granite of various colours. These apertures
contain rock-salt in large quantities, forming thick
incrustations on every part of the surface, beautifully
crystalized, and penetrating into the most compact parts of the
rock. The most remote parts of these caverns have a pleasing
appearance from the reflection of the crystals; their height
above the sea being about fifty feet. Large modules of sandstone
are found in the bottom of each, strongly impregnated with salt.
The summit of the cliff is formed of limestone.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir J. Stirling's <i>Statistical Report</i>;
dated October 15, 1837.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is worthy of remark, that the whole coast
of Géographe Bay is a perfect source of active springs,
discharging themselves on the beach in rapid rills of
considerable extent every six or seven yards.]</p>
<p>The northern extreme of the Cape is formed of majestic cliffs
of limestone two hundred feet in height, presenting two
magnificent ranges of caverns. Two of the lower range are superb,
the roofs and sides being covered with beautiful stalactites of
great magnitude, and exceedingly brilliant. In one of them are
found stalagmites, of extraordinary size, adhering to modules of
granite, with which the base is covered. The outer or great
cavern is about fifty feet wide, and forty-five to fifty feet in
height; its extreme length about one hundred feet. The sides,
roofs, and stalactites, present an extraordinary assemblage of
colours, from the immense variety of liverwort and minute fungi
with which they are covered. Some of the stalactites were found
to measure fifteen feet.</p>
<p>Roofing-slate has been discovered on the granite range,
besides indurated clay, lime, siliceous and calcareous
petrifactions, magnetic iron-ore, peacock iron-ore, chromate of
lead, and crystals of quartz. <i>Copper</i> has been discovered
by Captain King in the vicinity of Camden Bay, and Coal by
Captain Grey to the north of the settled districts. Mill-stone
grit, quite equal to the stone from which French burrs are made,
has been found above Swan River, about forty miles from Perth. It
may also be expected, from the frequent occurrence of the red
sand-stone formation, that when time will permit further
researches, especially in the northern districts, more important
mineralogical treasures will be found. It is understood to be the
intention of Mr. Roe, the surveyor-general, to class the numerous
geological specimens which, for some time past, have been
collecting in the surveyor's office from different parts of the
colony; to arrange them according to the several districts; and
eventually to form a map, marking out the spots where the
different earths have been found, and thus tracing the course of
the strata.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">RIVERS, BAYS, AND HARBOURS.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> principal rivers of Western
Australia are the Swan, the Avon, the Canning, the Murray, the
Harvey, the Preston, the Collie, with its tributary the
Brunswick, the Vasse, the Blackwood, the Donnelly, and the
Kalgan, which last is situated to the south-west of the
settlement. It is not to be denied, however, that if we except a
river recently discovered by Captain Grey to the north of the
settlement, and which he has named after the present governor,
the "Hutt," no rivers of magnitude have yet been observed in
Western Australia.</p>
<p>Of bays, inlets, and harbours, the most notable are Shark's
Bay, Breton Bay, Melville Water, Gage's Roads, Owen's Anchorage,
Cockburn's Sound, Safety Bay (or Warnborough Sound), Peel Inlet,
Koombanah Bay and Leschenault Inlet, Géographe Bay, Flinders Bay,
Tor Bay, King George's Sound, and Doubtful Island Bay.</p>
<p>In the year 1697, Vlaming, a Dutch navigator, first discovered
the river to which he gave the name of <i>Swan</i>, on account of
the number of black swans which he saw there; and on the 17th of
June, 1801, M. Bailly and M. Heirisson entered the mouth of this
river, in a cutter belonging to the French corvette
<i>Naturaliste</i> and ascended it during three successive days,
in which period they observed large flocks of black swans,
pelicans, and parroquets. They were struck with the forests, and
the geological formations on both banks. On this occasion, some
of the officers of the expedition visited and examined, for the
first time, the Isle of Rottenest, about twelve miles distant
from the mouth of the estuary, named Melville Water, On the
north-east side of Rottenest there is good temporary anchorage,
with the usual coast winds and weather.</p>
<p>The entrance to Melville Water, between the two heads which
form the passage, is over a bar; but there is a channel of six
feet depth at low water. About a mile within the headland the
water deepens, and then commences a succession of cliffs, or
natural wharfs, rising out of four, five, and six fathoms water.
For several miles, in an upward course, there are from five to
eight fathoms depth of water, over a broad expanse of the river.
This magnificent basin requires only a good entrance to make it
one of the finest harbours in the world, being seven or eight
miles in length by three or four in width. It is thought that the
entrance might be rendered navigable for vessels of burthen, and
that the blocks of stone procured by quarrying would go far
towards paying the expense of excavation.* Into this expansive
sheet of water flow the Rivers Swan and Canning; the Avon being
supposed to be a continuation of, and, therefore, identical with
the former, to which the Helena is a tributary stream. These
rivers have their sources in the Darling Mountains, which extend
nearly the whole length of the colony. The Canning is narrower
than the Swan, and navigable for a less distance. It was first
explored by a party from His Majesty's ship <i>Challenger</i> in
June 1829, and the general impression resulting from their
observations was,</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Ogle estimates the cost of such an
undertaking at about 20,000<i>l</i>., and proposes that a toll
should be levied on all ships entering that harbour for payment
of the interest of the capital so employed.&mdash;Page 217.]</p>
<blockquote>"That, with trifling exceptions, the soil, above the
salt water, is of a quality suited to all the purposes of
agriculture."</blockquote>
<p>The Helena was traced by Mr. Dale in two excursions which he
made in the same year. It runs through a valley for fifty or
sixty miles, and boasts of rich alluvial soil on its banks,
especially near to its junction with the Swan. The river Murray
empties itself, about forty-five miles south of Freemantle, into
Peel's Inlet, which is about fifteen miles in length, and varies
from two to five miles in breadth. Two smaller streams flow into
the same estuary; and, it appears from recent explorations, that
the neighbouring district contains some very rich land, valuable
both for tillage and grazing. The Murray is navigable for
good-sized boats, for about sixteen miles into the interior.</p>
<p>About fifty miles further to the south is Leschenault Inlet,
which receives the two rivers, the Preston and the Collie. In
March 1830, a few months after their discovery by Lieutenant
Preston and Dr. Collie, from whom these rivers derive their
names, a party penetrated to the range of hills which extends
along the whole of the settled district of Western Australia,
nearly parallel to the coast, from which it is distant only a few
miles. Their official report states that</p>
<blockquote>"The country inland from Port Leschenault, as far as
it has been seen, offers fertile soil and good stock stations.
The climate is decidedly cooler than in this district (Perth),
and judging from the quantity of grass, and the verdure of the
foliage, it appears to sustain a dry season not so long in
duration as that experienced in this quarter
(Perth)."</blockquote>
<p>For these reasons, in the year 1830, the Lieutenant-Governor
recommended it to the notice of settlers, and directed all the
district comprised within a line south-east one hundred miles
from the entrance, and thence eastward, to be added to the
district thus open for location. Leschenault, or Wellington
county, is, in fact, as fine a country for every purpose as any
in Australia; and all the most recent reports confirm the first
favourable opinions of its harbour and other natural advantages.
The inlet is a fine estuary, fifteen or eighteen miles in length,
and in some parts three or four wide, having four and five fathom
water in it, and although there is a bar at its entrance, no surf
exists upon it in consequence of its being sheltered by the point
which projects some distance, and forms a good outer harbour or
roadstead. In this roadstead, vessels of considerable size have
lain in safety during the whole of the winter months. In addition
to the benefit of this anchoring ground, and the admitted
practicability of hereafter clearing the entrance into the inlet,
the whole district is abundantly watered, and affords facility
for water carriage; the land is of fine quality, and admirably
adapted to cultivation and to the rearing of cattle, horses, and
sheep; these advantages, and its capability for a whaling
station, point out Leschenault as a spot where judgment and
industry must secure great returns to the capitalist. Sir James
Stirling represents this station as</p>
<blockquote>"Easily approachable, attention being given to the
shoal off" Point Casuarina; that the inlet is by no means
inconvenient for the reception and discharge of cargoes; and that
when the entrance is deepened, it would become a magnificent
harbour."</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Bull, R.N., has transmitted from Leschenault the
following statement respecting the security of that harbour,
written by the master of an American whaling-ship:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It is with pleasure that I find I have it in my
power to write you a favourable account of the safety of this bay
for winter-harbour. I rode out in perfect security the gale from
the 1st to the 8th of June, and the heaviest part at single
anchor, with only fifty fathoms of chain out. I, therefore,
consider it my duty to make this harbour known, and to write my
opinion of it as a sailor."</blockquote>
<p>The following corroborative testimony is taken from the
appendix to Mr. Potter Macqueen's late pamphlet, entitled
<i>Australia as she is, and as she may be</i>:&mdash; *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Journal of a Voyage from Cockburn Sound,
Swan River, to Port Leschenault, the Vasse, and King George's
Sound, in Her Majesty's Colonial Schooner, Champion, Lieutenant
Belcher, R.N. Commander, in the Months of August, September, and
October</i> 1838, by W. N. Clark. [=Appendix B.]]</p>
<blockquote>"On Saturday, 18th of August, arrived at Port
Leschenault, where we found the American whaler, <i>Pioneer</i>,
at anchor in the bay. Lieutenant Bull, R.N., the Government
Resident, came on board, and brought the <i>Champion</i> into a
safer berth, nearer shore, as the weather was threatening. Here
we were wind bound for six days, and had thus an opportunity of
trying the capabilities of the anchorage amidst very stormy
weather. In describing the anchorage, I give the opinions of Mr.
Belcher (Lieutenant commanding) and the commander of the
<i>Pioneer</i>, whose nautical abilities cannot be questioned.
The Bay of Leschenault, called in the native language
<i>Koombaana</i>, is very easy of access; the best mark for ships
approaching from sea is Mount Williams, seen at a great distance,
and bearing north-east of the bay. The probable distance from the
bay may be about forty miles. The anchorage is situated in
latitude 33° 15', and 115° 32' east longitude; it is perfectly
secured."</blockquote>
<p>About twenty-nine miles S.S.W. of Wellington county, the river
<i>Vasse</i> flows into an inlet of the same name, within
Géographe Bay. This inlet or estuary is the receptacle of the
various small rivers that originate in Whicher's range; it
abounds in fish. The <i>Vasse</i> flows through a district, rich
in herbage resembling clover, and enamelled with daisies,
buttercups, marigolds, and other beautiful field flowers. It is
an admirable cattle run. The <i>Vasse</i> irrigates the northern
district of Sussex county. The river <i>Blackwood</i>, supposed
to be the largest on this coast, falls into Hardy's Inlet, in
Flinders' Bay, at the southern extremity of the same county.</p>
<p>Hardy's inlet also receives the river Scott. Augusta is the
name of a town site at the entrance of this inlet, settled in May
1830, and the scenery in the neighbourhood is beautiful and
romantic. The banks of the Blackwood are in many places covered
with a dense forest of enormous trees; and some of the finest
land ever seen by Sir James Stirling during his various
excursions, were also observed along its shores.* This river has
been traced forty or fifty miles from its junction with the
Chapman branch, and little alteration in size or appearance is
said to be perceptible. Augusta is adapted for a whale-fishing
establishment: the fur seal also abounds.** There are some
enterprising settlers located here, and in this neighbourhood,***
who live upon the most amicable terms with the aborigines. On the
coast, between Augusta and Point d'Entrecasteaux, the landing is
often rendered difficult, if not dangerous for a boat, by rollers
of formidable magnitude.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is included in the Leschenault grant.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Vide Major Irwin, p. 68.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Captain Molloy, Messrs. Turner, Kellum,
Bussell, Chapman, and others, with a small detachment of
military.]</p>
<p>The river <i>Kalgân</i> (or French river) which discharges
itself through Oyster Harbour, into King George's Sound, is of
considerable length, and is fed by many tributary streams and
chains of pools. Excursions were made up this river in 1831 by
Dr. Collie, and by Mr. Dale. For the first twenty miles of their
route, dense forests of mahogany, white-gum trees, casuarinas,
banksias, wattles, and other shrubs presented themselves; but as
they penetrated further, the country became more open, and
numerous ponds of brackish water were found.</p>
<p>Another river has been more recently discovered in the
northern part of Western Australia, and named <i>Fitzroy</i>,
after the commander of Her Majesty's ship <i>Beagle</i>. It
discharges itself into King's Sound, in Dampier's Archipelago.
The entrance is wide, but numerous sand-banks, partly dry at low
water, render it unnavigable for vessels of any burthen: it was
traced up a distance of about thirty miles, and the rise and fall
of the tide in it was found to be twenty-two feet at the full and
change of the moon. The water was fresh at half-ebb, close to the
entrance of the river.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Fine grassy plains and forest scenery were
observed; and a native grape, of good flavour, was found near the
banks of this river: a nut, resembling the nutmeg, a native
cotton-tree, and a small kangaroo, with a nail or hook at the end
of its tail, were also amongst the curiosities discovered in this
expedition.]</p>
<p><i>Shark's Bay</i> presents several safe anchorages, and
affords secure access to the districts in its immediate vicinity;
but the best anchorage on the whole coast is in <i>Cockburn</i>
Sound, S. lat. 32° 10', which is locked in by Garden Island (or
Buache), having everywhere good holding ground and soundings of
at least fifteen fathoms. It may be deemed a place of perfect
shelter at all seasons and under any circumstances. Sir James
Stirling does not scruple to describe it as</p>
<blockquote>"perfectly secure at all times, and available for
vessels of the greatest dimensions, as well as for any number of
them."</blockquote>
<p>Its entrance is round the north point of Garden Island, and
between it and a small barren islet named Carnac. If this Sound
is liable to an objection, it is that of distance from the Swan
River, which is six or seven miles to the north of it; on this
account, and from the circumstance that Cockburn's Sound is not
properly buoyed down, Gage's Roads have been commonly preferred,
except in seasons when north-west gales may be expected.** Owen's
Anchorage, at two miles and a quarter from the jetty at
Freemantle, is a good and safe station for ships in the blowing
season; and they may remain in Gage's Roads, opposite the town,
even during that season, except in very severe gales, the
approach of which, in this latitude, is always indicated by the
barometer; when Owen's Anchorage must be made for. To run,
however, for the anchorages during heavy weather or by night, is
hardly prudent, unless a commander be well acquainted with the
coast, some shipwrecks having occurred in October 1839, as
appears in the appendix. Governor Hutt has lately deemed it
expedient to prohibit the pilots of Freemantle from bringing
ships to anchor in Gage's Roads between the 1st of May and the
1st of October.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Sailing Directions, in Appendix,
B.&mdash;to be deleted; see "<span class=
"uu">Erratum</span>".]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See Copy of Official Order in the Appendix,
D.]</p>
<p>Of <i>Géographe</i> Bay, we have the following information on
the authority of Sir James Stirling:</p>
<blockquote>"On the <i>western</i> side of that great
indentation, there is usually to be found good stiff holding
ground. The best anchorage in that part is in Summer's Bay,
situated in the south-western corner, on about four or five
fathoms, having the extremities of the point to the N.W., bearing
about N.W. by N. In that position a vessel is sheltered from the
great western or ocean swell; and, I think, if well found with
anchors and cables, any ship might ride there in safety
throughout the winter; she would, at all events, be more secure
than in Table Bay. In the first place, because she would be
covered by the land three or four points more to the northward,
and the holding-ground is better." ****</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[**** We believe it to be also the opinion of Sir
J. Stirling, that Dunsborough, in this neighbourhood, is
admirably adapted for a <i>naval station</i>.]</p>
<p>The <i>Vasse</i> Inlet is very safe in summer; for gales of
wind are scarcely known in that season, and the bottom is good
and tenacious. The anchorage off Port <i>Leschenault</i>
(Wellington) may also be frequented even after the end of summer,
for Captain Stackpole, commanding an American whaling ship,
pronounces it a secure <i>winter</i> harbour, as before stated.
It is open from N.W. by N. to N. ½W.</p>
<p>King George's Sound, which receives the river Kalgân, through
Oyster Harbour, in 35° 6' 20" S. lat. and 118° 1'. E. long.,
possesses all the qualities which constitute a good haven. Its
position, however, being to the eastward and to leeward of Cape
Leeuwin, in the vicinity of which strong westerly gales prevail,
this circumstance detracts from the value of its other
advantages. Within this Sound, near the entrance to Princess
Royal Harbour, is a town site bearing the name of Albany. The bar
at the entrance to Oyster Harbour has thirteen feet of water on
it at high tide; and inside are facilities, presented by nature,
for repairing vessels, and for loading and unloading.</p>
<p>Harbours for boats and small vessels also exist near the
entrance of Peel's Inlet, Augusta, Nornalup, Torbay, Collingwood
Bay, and Cape Riche.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">SOIL AND CLIMATE.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Sir J. Stirling's</span> Report furnishes us
with the first information respecting the nature of the soil.
"The surface of the country is generally covered with those
substances which are technically called <i>earths</i>, in
contradistinction to <i>soils</i>;" * and although not remarkably
rich, is favourable in other respects to farming purposes. In its
natural state there is scarcely any part which does not produce
some description of plant, and even in the least favoured portion
its defects appear to be of that class which art, aided by
climate, will be enabled hereafter to overcome. The best
districts then known (in the year 1837) were those on the Avon,
the Hotham, the Williams, Arthur, Beaufort, and South-east River,
together with the portions of country adjacent to the Swan, the
Murray, the Harvey, Brunswick, Preston, Collie, Capel, and Vasse.
Sir J. Stirling wishes it to be borne in mind that his remarks
can only apply to the very small part of this vast territory
which had then been explored, and that in the progress of the
settlement, circumstances would continually arise to give
peculiar value to lands. The following is a statement of the
character of the soil to the north and north-west of the present
settlements, taken from the Report of the West Australian
Agricultural Society, at a meeting held in the capital of Perth
the 3rd August, 1838, and signed by G. F. Moore, Esq., chairman
of the committee:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Vide Sir J. Stirling's Report, dated 15th
October, 1837.]</p>
<blockquote>"The recent arrival here of Mr. Grey" (it is stated)
"who has been engaged in examining the north-west coast of this
colony, has given us the very agreeable intelligence of the
existence of a country most peculiarly suited to the growth of
cotton and sugar. Several rivers of considerable extent and
magnitude, large tracts of soil of the most fertile character,
and a natural vegetation of the most luxuriant description,
situated in the suitable latitude, and within easy access of a
supply of Indian, Malay and Chinese labourers, present a
combination of advantages, rarely to be met with in the British
dominions, and which it is believed that the British government
will not long continue to overlook."</blockquote>
<p>The above is corroborative of a portion of Sir J. Stirling's
dispatch. No. 144, dated 29th August 1836. It appears from the
"Perth Gazette" of 27th April 1839, that Lieut. (now Captain)
Grey, in furtherance of instructions received from H. M.
Government to effect a survey of the North-western coast, and as
far as practicable the Western shores of Australia, fell in, on
the 5th March 1839, with a large river in lat. 24° 56', about 50
miles S. of Cape Cuvier, and discovered a most beautiful tract of
country, presenting to the eye immense <i>alluvial</i> plains.
Every two or three miles they crossed a running stream, and the
whole face of the country was clothed with the richest grass,
offering a fine opening for the establishment of grazing farms.
This was in the neighbourhood of Moresby's range; and a very fair
country was likewise passed over from 28° to 29° 30' south
latitude; the general character of the soil being good.</p>
<p>These accounts being of an official character, and possessing
a strong guarantee for their authenticity, have been made to take
precedence of private statements, whatever degree of credibility
may be due to them. An anonymous correspondent of the <i>Perth
Gazette</i> of the 16th February, 1839, who seems to write with
plainness and impartiality, expresses himself thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On many parts of the coast of this vast island, or
continent, the wide margin of sand which belts the greater part
of its circumference is interrupted by tracts, considerable in
extent, of tolerably fertile soil and grazing land; as in several
instances in New South Wales and Southern Australia, and within
the limits of this (the Western) settlement at Géographe Bay,
Leschenault, and between King George's Sound and Augusta. In
Western Australia, the numerous rivers, inlets, and lakes or
lagoons, are generally bordered by slips of rich alluvial flats,
and frequently backed by some extent of stiff loam or clay,
which, though of difficult cultivation at first, is reducible to
tillage with manure. Tillage and pasturage should be
combined."</blockquote>
<p>The qualities of soil, in the absence of extended and numerous
reports, by competent judges, will be best appreciated by its
productions; and these will be enumerated in the proper place,
when specifying the nature of the crops and the variety of fruits
which thrive in this region. At present it will be sufficient to
quote a few general remarks taken somewhat indiscriminately from
letters written home by settlers. A communication forwarded to C.
Mangles, Esq., dated Perth, Swan River, 12th November, 1836,
written in a strain of cheerfulness, after shewing that the
settlement was in a highly prosperous condition, makes the
following statements. The reader must, however, bear in mind that
here, as in all very early settlements, the system of husbandry
is rather of a barbarous description.</p>
<blockquote>"Wheat grown here averages about twenty-four bushels
an acre; on land properly manured from thirty-five to forty
bushels per acre. Hops grow very well, and, indeed, every thing
else: in short, this is the finest climate I have ever been in.
The flocks of sheep are over the mountains, and thriving as well
as could be wished." The writer then remarks on the nourishing
condition of his melons, cucumbers, pumpkins, potatoes, grapes,
and fruits of all kinds."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Moore, in a letter dated 5th March, 1831, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That for fifteen miles up the Swan River, white
sands present themselves on either side with some mixture of
vegetable mould: on the white sand, the Australian mahogany is
found in abundance and of excellent quality. About three miles
above Perth, the alluvial flats are covered with luxuriant crops
of grasses. Tobacco, hemp, flax, eringo, celery, and parsley, are
<i>indigenous</i>. Indeed there is every variety of soil, having
something of peculiar production, either of tree, shrub, herb or
flower. Some places appear like well-ordered parks; yet you no
where find impenetrable jungle, save in the swamps and
lagoons."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Moore also says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have acquired some knowledge of the indications of
soil: mahogany is indicative of sandy land; red gum, of stiff,
cold clay; wattle, of moisture; and the broom and dwarf
<i>grass-tree</i>, of what we term <i>shrubby
herbage</i>"&mdash;P. 185.</blockquote>
<p>It thus appears, as before remarked, that although in many
parts the soil is sandy, even that is very far from being
sterile, for it bears well various kinds of corn, fruit, and
vegetables, with tolerable management, and, with manure, produces
them luxuriantly. A farmer, writing to his brother in June, 1833,
from his settlement on the Swan River, says, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Crops, in general, last harvest, were very abundant;
wheat, on the best soils, in several instances, averaged
thirty-two bushels per acre on land that had been only once
ploughed, and without manure."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Joseph Hardy, in a letter dated from Peninsula Farm, Swan
River, 14th July, 1832, not satisfied with the accuracy of what
was asserted by certain discontented settlers over their bottle,
quitted them and went to judge for himself of the character of
the country of his adoption. He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"After reaching the <i>Peninsula</i> (where I now
reside) I was convinced that the land was of a useful character,
and might be made to suit the general purposes of agriculture,
although inferior to much of the land higher up the Swan. The
last year, 1831, has convinced me that when the land has tillage
and management, it will grow wheat, barley, oats, rye, potatoes,
and turnips in great abundance."</blockquote>
<p>Another correspondent, writing on the 27th January, 1833,
observes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That near the hills, about twenty miles from the
coast, the land is really good, and so thinly wooded as to be
well adapted either for grazing or tillage."</blockquote>
<p>It is stated in the third Annual Report of the Western
Australian Agricultural Society, that by recent explorations, the
existence of <i>extensive pastoral districts in the interior</i>,
has been ascertained. Of the district of Wellington, Mr. Clark,
in his Report of 1838, observes, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The whole of the country around Leschenault seemed
to be of a very superior quality, and extends in one unvaried
mass for twenty miles from the sea coast into the interior,
connecting itself with the Vasse district to the South, and that
of the Murray to the North."</blockquote>
<p>Sir J. Stirling observes of the Wellington district, that
although he does not profess to be a judge of soils, he
entertains a very favourable opinion of this part of the country,
in which he is confirmed by the judgment of others. It presents a
varied surface, and offers every variety of soil, from the
richest alluvium to the most unpromising sand, but, on the
general average, it is a very fine district for all the
operations of the settler. For the last two years. Sir James has
had an establishment there, and his agent has always spoken in
the highest terms of his sheep, cattle and corn: nor was there
any complaint during the whole of last summer, which was
elsewhere a season of excessive drought. The district abounds in
grass and fine timber, and in game and fish. There is another
important peculiarity in the country around Leschenault, its
being available for the location of a great body of small
settlers, in consequence of the general diffusion of water for
common use.</p>
<p>The Australian soil varies, however, according to laws of its
own. In other countries rivers are the great fertilizers: in
Australia, the most productive soil is generally found on the
sides and summits of considerable elevations. The surface of the
country being singularly devoid of vegetable decay, the most
fertile soil will necessarily be found where the rivers and
floods have deposited their alluvium.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It appears probable that both the land and
water here are still in a course of formation: that the various
anomalies in each, which fill the minds of Europeans with wonder,
are only the natural appearances of an imperfect, or rather of an
unfinished work; and that they will vanish when the causes, now
in operation, shall have produced their full effect.]</p>
<p>In April, 1837, the Governor, accompanied by Messrs. Phillips,
Harris, Spofforth, Hillman, Hunt, and Dobbins, went out on an
excursion to the Southern districts. The period selected for this
journey, the end of the driest season of the year, had been
chosen with a view of ascertaining the supply of water in the
country to be visited, and it was satisfactory to them to find
the Murray, a powerful stream, sufficient both in fall and
current for the establishment of a hundred mills, within two
miles, above the western base of the hills. A county town-site
was accordingly selected at that station, possessing the 'great
attractions of good soil and running water, and the means for
making the river navigable for boats from Marrarrup to Pinjarra,
whenever circumstances may render such an improvement desirable.
Four miles south of this spot is a rich valley watered by a large
permanent stream: eleven miles further is Mount William, near the
summit of which was found a running spring, traced down by the
party for two miles through a mountainous country; and the party
halted for the night at the confluence of this brook with another
from the south-west, about 200 yards above their junction with
the Murray. At a distance of five miles from Mount William, the
country about the banks of the river was found to be open and
beautiful, with rich alluvial flats; and the pools in that
direction were of great length, depth, and breadth, and the water
excellent. The hills in the vicinity were covered with good red
loam, and produced a considerable quantity of herbage, available
for cattle and sheep, and were rendered very agreeable in
appearance by gigantic trees. As the party proceeded further to
the south-east, with a view of establishing an intermediate
position favorable to communication between the southern and
western coasts, they discovered, in the vicinity of Mount Barker,
a large range of pasture land, together with a greater supply of
water from springs than had heretofore been supposed to exist. On
the following day excellent water was again found in numerous
pools of the river, the banks of which affording the most
abundant supply of herbage, rendered the situation suitable for
the support of vast quantities of stock, and also for the
formation of farms. On the 20th April they arrived at the river
Arthur, which, at that season, had no current, but consisted of
large pools and springs of excellent water; although, from the
appearance of its bed, it was supposed that it must be a
considerable river in winter. On the 21st April they arrived at
Mr. Harris's station, on the Williams, after passing over a very
good country for several miles on the left side of the river. On
the 22nd, a short excursion was made to the eastward; and thence
W.S.W. to the town site of Williamsburgh; pursuing the same
course from the river Williams, at the point where the King
George's Sound road crosses it; the first four miles, through a
hilly district, were found well adapted to the support of sheep.
Then, crossing the track which they had pursued, the party passed
through a mahogany range for two miles, and encamped for the
night in a valley where the grass and soil were both of good
quality. Continuing the same course on the 24th, and after
traversing a scrubby range for four miles, the party descended
into a broad valley, which continued to intersect their path at
intervals throughout the remainder of the day, over a space of
fourteen miles. Pools and springs of water were abundant, and the
soil, for the most part, rich, although occasionally overgrown
with the tea tree. It was bounded by low hills of available, but
not rich soil; yet favorable to the formation of small farms. The
journal of this excursion concludes thus:</p>
<blockquote>"On the 25th April our course was changed to W. by
N., being then about twenty-five miles S. by E. from Mount
William. We soon entered a mountainous region, on the hills of
which there was much available land, although heavily timbered.
The valleys generally were open, and the vegetation fresher than
in the portion of the range to the north of the Murray. In four
miles we encountered a valley abounding in springs and containing
good grass. We followed it down for two or three miles, until it
joined a considerable course coming from the N.N.W., down which
we pursued our way, but finding its direction to be to the
S.S.E., we left it, and proceeded over a fair hilly country to
another but smaller stream, which we were also obliged to
abandon, for the same reason. In the afternoon we met, soon after
starting, with several springs and streams, flowing to the
southward, some of which we crossed with difficulty, and at
sunset, after a stormy afternoon, we stopped for the night in a
rich mountain glen, producing enormous mahogany and red gum
trees, and much good grass. From this, on the following day, we
continued to pass through a very romantic country, in which rich
valleys and good hill sides prevailed, together with a good
supply of water in all directions. In the afternoon we halted on
the right bank of a strong stream or river, in an exceedingly
rich alluvial flat, about one mile eastward of the western base
of the hills. On the 27th April we descended to the plain, and
took up a direction parallel with the range, about two miles from
it From this to the Murray, we passed over a country, the whole
of which, for thirty-five miles on the line of our course, may be
called arable land, varying in quality, but all available, easily
cleared, and well supplied with water in the driest season,
although probably in winter too wet for cultivation in its
natural state."</blockquote>
<p>The following is the account of the excursion of Messrs. W. K.
Shenton and Richard Wells to the Collie and Brunswick Rivers, in
the county of "Wellington:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On the 30th November, 1837, they left Mr. Davis's
farm, on the Canning, with twenty days' provision, and two pack
horses; crossed the Southern River, and at noon arrived at a
district lightly timbered with casuarina, and affording
sufficient food and water for their horses. They then crossed the
dry beds of three water courses, and in the afternoon arrived at
the Serpentine River, which at that point was running strongly
over a rocky iron-stone bed. On the next day they proceeded
southerly through a forest country&mdash;passing by a running
brook, called the Daudalup; and on the following morning, came to
another and a larger stream; where the richness of the grass and
the beauty of the country excited the admiration and beguiled the
fatigue of the travellers. Here they also observed a herd of wild
cattle, and numerous tracks in every direction. Shortly
afterwards they came in sight of Mount William; and in the
afternoon arrived at four fresh lakes. Before five o'clock, P.
M., they crossed the Harvey River by a good ford; and proceeded
to a large lake called <i>Cadára</i>, which they left on the
morning of 4th December, keeping the eastern aide, and passing
through an undulating open forest of mahogany and white gums
without brush or underwood, and where limestone appeared
occasionally through the soil. After nine the next morning a
large swamp presented itself beyond which the forest thickened,
and produced much underwood. Here the kangaroos were numerous.
Before noon the party halted at a lake called Wanalup. At ten the
following morning was observed the "Derbal, at estuary of
Leschenault, on the shore of a narrow belt of good soil and
feed.' At half-past eleven they made the Collie; they observed
large flocks of ducks upon the river, and followed it to its
mouth over a good loamy soil, and through excellent grass, on
which, and on sow thistles, and a species of jacobea, or
groundsel, which grows four or five feet high, their horses
luxuriated that evening. The town-site of Waterloo (county
Wellington) commences with a very rich swampy hollow, and the
upper part above, where the Collie is at present navigable, is
excellent land, with rich vegetation. The sow thistles which
abound in this neighbourhood are from ten to twelve feet high,
with the stem of the diameter of a crown piece. They followed
this river to its junction with the Brunswick, where the natives
had constructed with brushwood a dam or weir across a broad sheet
of water. The soil about this point was very good and clothed
with grass, knee-high, and particularly thick and free from
bushes or scrub. The fresh water spring, marked on the plans in
the Survey Office, was found, but the river being fresh at this
time of the year, they had no occasion to remain by it. After
bivouacking in a pleasant spot about a quarter of a mile from the
point, they proceeded E.S.E. next mornings and perceived the
River Collie, flowing through a district so dense with
vegetation, consisting of grass, sow thistles, groundsel, and
fern, that, after forcing their way with great labour, they were
compelled to make the high land again, which resembled in
character that of the Swan, but was considered more pleasing from
its greater variety of surface. Subsequently, however, they
crossed the river and were agreeably surprised at finding
abundant feed for stock, not in the valleys only, but also on the
hill sides and summits, on soil of an excellent description, free
from stones, and capable of being readily cleared and cultivated;
"apparently," remarks the journalist, "it would produce heavy
crops of corn. "After examining," he continues, the extremely
rich flats in the valley, we proceeded up the same; found a
spring in the hill-sides, and a running brook." The party then
ascended a hill both sides and summit of which exhibited rich
pasture and fine soil, and whence they had a glimpse of the ocean
and the coast towards Géographe Bay, besides the estuary and
valley of the Preston river; although this eminence was too
thickly wooded to afford them as extended a prospect as they
desired. On the 9th December, a small water course was observed,
and a great extent of broom trees, indicative of good soil. In
the afternoon the party fell in with the Brunswick river, and
they describe the vegetation on both banks to be luxuriant; the
timber being particularly straight and sound. On the 11th
December the same favourable observations were made respecting
the condition of the soil, and the party met with several emus
and kangaroos, cockatoos and pigeons in abundance. "In fact"
(observes the writer) "all the land we had passed over this day
till near five o'clock was, with trifling exceptions,
sufficiently good for corn or other crops, and quite equal in
quality to much that is cultivated for such purposes on the Swan
and Canning; and to the tops of the hills in the district from
the Collie to Mount William, the verdure of spring yet prevails."
Next morning the party reached the Murray, half a mile above
Pinjarra. "Messrs. Oakley and Buglass," Bays the reporter, "have
here an establishment, and perhaps a better example of the reward
that perseverance and industry will ensure, may not be met with
in this colony. This is now their second season; they are cutting
twenty-two acres of fine wheat, and have, with very trivial
assistance, erected a good dwelling-house, barn, dairy, and
stock-yard and also shewn much ingenuity in the making many of
their agricultural implements."<br>
<br>
On leaving Pinjarra, another herd of wild cattle was surprised by
the party, for, upon being observed, they fled like
deer.</blockquote>
<p>In January 1838, the Governor visited the stations at the
Vasse and at Wormerup, and aided in establishing a military post
near the entrance into Leschenault inlet.</p>
<blockquote>"The nature and the capabilities of the site for the
county town, Australind, for the district of Wellington, have
also been examined during this excursion, and it is found to be a
most favourable position. Distinguished by its connection with
the good country behind it and on its northern sides, the quality
of the soil, the supply of water, and the convenience of water
carriage, admirably adapt this place to become an attractive and
thriving township. This district, from its proximity to the sea,
and its extensive pastures, will unquestionably, before long,
take the lead of all our grazing districts."</blockquote>
<p>The Governor and party crossed overland from the Vasse to Port
Leschenault. For a distance of about twelve or fourteen miles to
the Capel, the country was found extremely fine; indeed, a finer
country, our informant says, was never seen. Leaving it, they
proceeded to Leschenault by a course which did not afford the
same opportunities of judging of the general character of the
country. They passed principally over elevated ground. On their
arrival at Leschenault, the rivers Collie, Preston, and Brunswick
were ascended and closely examined, as far as the navigation
would permit, say about fourteen miles. The country about the
Brunswick was new to all parties, and the land upon this, as well
as the other rivers, was found very rich, and well adapted for
the purposes of agriculture and grazing. Mr. Scott and family
were placed on a beautiful spot, for a farm, on the Preston;
several other families were expected to follow them in the course
of a short time. The large quantity of good land found so near
the coast was a matter of gratification to all who inspected it,
and will give to this district many striking and peculiar
advantages. The natives of the Vasse, and at Wormerup were living
in amity with the settlers. They were rendering themselves useful
in cattle-tending, and other simple avocations.</p>
<p>Sir James Stirling, in July 1838, made an overland excursion
to port Leschenault; and all the gentlemen who joined this
expedition confirm, in the most flattering terms, the previous
reports of the qualifications of the Leschenault district, as a
locality highly favorable for extensive occupation by a number of
hardy and industrious emigrants. As a grazing country, it is
acknowledged to be far superior to any other portion of the
colony; the establishments for rearing horses for the Indian
market, and the most productive dairies of the colony will
consequently be found, before long, in this quarter. The
communication with the surrounding sheep-runs, at no great
distance from Leschenault, is open and easy of access. The
accounts of the late governor are fully borne out by his
successor.</p>
<p>The Perth Gazette of the 23rd November last, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"His Excellency, Governor Hutt, has returned from his
short tour to the southward, highly gratified. He visited, in the
course of it, the settlements on the Canning and the Murray
rivers, as well as at Leschenault Inlet and Géographe Bay; and
every where he saw decided marks of prosperity among the
settlers; whilst, highly as his expectations had been raised
respecting the land to the south of the Murray River, or from
Pinjarra to the Vasse, he has now been enabled to satisfy
himself, from his own observation, that Western Australia
possesses, in that direction, a tract of country which may
compete in beauty and fertility with some of the most loudly
praised soils of the sister colonies. Nothing can exceed the
state of the crops, which would in many instances do credit to
farms in England. The rankness and abundance of the grass in
these districts offer fine pasture for stock, and the colonists
have hitherto turned their exclusive attention to the rearing of
horses and homed cattle, which are increasing rapidly; It seems
almost as if these were marked out to be the dairy districts of
the colony; but latterly sheep have been introduced, and are
doing remarkably well The experiment has been tried, and fully
succeeded, of driving sheep from York to the Vasse. The
governor's most favourable ideas have been more than confirmed of
the capabilities and prospects of the colony."</blockquote>
<p>A communication is now open by land from the north to the
south of the interior of Western Australia. Mr. Harris, in ten
days, drove a flock of 200 ewes from King George's Sound to
Williams River; the distance was performed at the rate of sixteen
miles a day: and when the road is properly marked, sheep may
easily be driven this journey in six days. He mentions several
good feeding and watering places on this route, as Kokocup, Mount
Barker, and at Mount Barron: the latter thirty-five miles from
Albany, and three east of the present line of road, which it is
intended to turn in that direction. The sheep from Sydney and Van
Diemen's Land may thus be landed at Albany, in King George's
Sound, avoiding the risk of a boisterous passage round Cape
Leeuwin at the end of a long voyage.</p>
<p>The following official report, presented in October 1839, just
received, will further illustrate the qualities of the soil.</p>
<br>
<p class="quote" align="center">Eighth Annual Report of the
Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Western Australia.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>To His Excellency <span class="uu">Governor
Hutt</span>, Patron.<br>
<br>
"<span class="uu">Sir</span>,&mdash;In accordance with the
established custom of this Society during the government of your
respected predecessor, we do ourselves the honour of forwarding
our Annual Report to you, as patron of the Society, with a full
assurance that, as a body whose endeavour it has always been to
develop and encourage the several capabilities of the colony, we
shall continue to receive that kindly consideration and support
which, since the formation of the society, we are proud to
acknowledge.<br>
<br>
"The absence of an opportunity for transmitting our Report to
England has enabled us to give a statement with greater accuracy
of our crops and wool; the former, with pleasure we observe to be
nothing inferior to those of any of our former seasons; at the
same time we regret that the number of acres has not materially
increased&mdash;a circumstance mainly attributable to the great
scarcity and high rate of labour, and to the greater attention
which has been devoted to grazing. From the seasonable and
protracted rains which have fallen this year, and the experience
of ten years, we confidently hope that this side of New Holland
is not subject to any such periodical droughts as those which are
found to be so destructive in New South Wales. The crop of
natural grass in the grazing districts has been this season
unprecedented, both for its early appearance and luxuriant
growth. Gardens and green crops generally have, as usual, fully
answered the expectations of the cultivator. We consider it
unnecessary to particularize, when green crops have been alike so
abundantly prolific. Fruits of every kind, as hitherto reported,
from all climates, continue to progress. The vine, more
particularly, from the great attention which has been paid to its
increase and culture, and the uniform abundance of its fruit,
promises ere long to supply us with at least a fair substitute
for the wine which we have hitherto received from the Cape. The
absence of persons skilled in the art alone prevents a
commencement of its manufacture this season. A few casks, as an
experiment, have already been made, and the flavour much
extolled. There are now in the colony upwards of two hundred
varieties of the vine, many of them in bearing.<br>
<br>
"It is with great pleasure we are able to state, that the
increase of our sheep flock has been equal to that of former
years, for, although in numerical amount, it would at a first
glance appear to be less, it must be borne in mind that in the
number quoted last session, was included many wethers and that
year's lambs, few of which have borne; it may also be expected
that when the ewes are kept to a greater age than is usual, many
may have proved barren; the increase is, however, satisfactory,
and the flocks universally heal Jhy. The more settled condition
of the colonists, we hope it may be proved, has enabled them to
give greater attention to the getting up of their wool. In one or
two instances, the fleeces of this colony, from the last year's
clip, obtained the highest prices in the London market We hope
that a little more experience among our young graziers will, in
the course of a few years, place us in a high position in the
market.<br>
<br>
"Horned cattle have steadily increased. Working bullocks are not
so much in demand as formerly, a general preference being given
to horses, more particularly for road-work. Cows are in great
request, and the few that have lately been imported have realized
high prices. An importation to some extent of sheep, cattle, or
both, would be certain of meeting a ready sale, and we are aware
that a considerable sum has for some time been accumulating for
this express purpose. As regards the transition of sheep and
stock generally, the recent trial, made by Mr. Harris, a medical
gentleman resident on the Swan, and his unlooked-for success in
driving a flock from King George's Sound to the Williams River,
without the loss of a single head, we consider a matter of such
vital importance to this colony, that we deem a few remarks not
inappropriate in our Report When it is considered that stock may
now be landed, from the sister colonies, at King George's Sound
without incurring the risk consequent upon the boisterous and
frequently protracted passage round Cape Leeuwin, where the great
majority of loss has generally been experienced, it may fairly be
hoped that the importation will be more extensive. Mr. Harris
describes the line of road which he pursued to be through a
generally good country, and sufficiently watered; his journey to.
the Williams River occupying him ten days.<br>
<br>
"We are happy to learn that your Excellency has decided on lining
the new district round Kojenup, and the country in the line of
road between it and the Avon. We anticipate that the lands will
be eagerly sought after, as well by the capitalists at the Sound,
from its proximity to their port, as by ourselves, though at a
greater distance, for their known good quality, and the
facilities already mentioned for stocking them.<br>
<br>
"Horses, both for saddle and draught, are in such demand, that
the prices seem to be limited only by the desire of the owners.
The value of this description of stock, particularly brood mares,
may be considered to have risen forty or fifty per cent. The
importation of a number of mares from the neighbouring colonies
would be most acceptable. Those from Sydney and Van Diemen's Land
have generally been preferred, as exhibiting more bone, strength,
and figure than those from the Cape. Horses thrive remarkably
with us; it is very rarely found necessary to use medicine of any
kind. We have still the greater number of the fine stallions we
formerly enumerated, both thorough-bred and of the heavier kind,
besides several young ones of our own breeding. We beg leave here
to express to your Excellency our great satisfaction at the
recent passing of an Act of Council for the protection of
breeders of stock, and others, from stray horses, &amp;c.
&amp;c., by which we hope that the purity of our several kinds
will be more certainly preserved.<br>
<br>
"Goats continue to increase as rapidly as heretofore. Cashmere
goats have been introduced since our last Report, and we hope
next year to be enabled to state that the wool produced from them
will amply realise the expectations of the spirited individuals
who have imported them. We are pleased to find, now, that the
greater part of the unsettled of our working community has been
culled; labour, though greatly unequal to the demand, is becoming
more steady; few of that class now talk of leaving, and many who
left us some years since are gradually returning to us from the
neighbouring colonies.<br>
<br>
"Although a few labourers and artizans have, during the year,
arrived in the colony, we regret to state that our interests are
still suffering very seriously from the want of servants, male
and female, particularly farming men, shepherds, and domestic
servants. The accession of boys and girls which we received from
the Children's Friend Society proved, for the most part, very
useful. We hope the guardians will not forget us in their future
dispensations of juvenile emigrants.<br>
<br>
"We beg to call your Excellency's attention to the inefficient
strength of the Survey Department, and the consequent backward
state of surveys&mdash;a circumstance, in the absence of private
surveyors, and the heavy rate of wages, severely felt, both by
present proprietors and purchasers of lands. We would wish to
impress this subject most earnestly on your Excellency, with a
hope that your suggestions to the Home Government might
accelerate the removal of so serious an evil, which, together
with the great want of labour, we conceive to be the only serious
impediments to the more rapid rise of the colony.<br>
<br>
"It must be gratifying to your Excellency to observe, that the
ship <i>Shepherd</i>, direct to London, is just on the point of
sailing, freighted solely by the produce of this colony,
principally in wool and oil, and to learn that a great quantity
still remains for a future opportunity.<br>
<br>
"In conclusion, we feel that we have cause to congratulate your
Excellency on the general prosperity which appears to exist
amongst the colonists, and find that every individual desirous of
employment has no difficulty in obtaining plentiful occupation at
wages far beyond the average rate in the other colonies.<br>
<br>
"To prove that this is a most desirable country for the
industrious' labourer, we would adduce very many instances of
comparatively opulent men, on their own land, and with their own
flocks, who came to this colony ten years since as servants from
England, where they were unable to maintain their families
without the assistance of their parishes.<br>
<br>
"The wages which we are now paying, are, for reaping, 27<i>s</i>.
to 30<i>s</i>. per acre; yearly farm servants, 30<i>l</i>. to
36<i>l</i>., with board; shepherd's ditto, ditto ditto; female
domestics, from 12<i>l</i>. to 18<i>l</i>.; country carpenter's,
8<i>s</i>. per day; labourers, 5<i>s</i>. to 6<i>s</i>. per
ditto.<br>
<br>
"We have the honour to be your Excellency's obedient
servants,</blockquote>

<p>The climate of extra-tropical Australia is peculiarly
favourable to the human constitution, probably from the
deficiency of vegetable decomposition. Endemic diseases are
almost unknown; even small-pox, measles, and hooping-cough are
strangers; but the hot north wind produces ophthalmia; and the
teres, or round-worm, is the common pest of childhood. Dysentery
is the most prevalent disease; but one proof, and that a strong
one, of the healthy nature of the atmosphere, is the facility
with which all disorders, even the worst cases of venereal
affection, yield to the simplest remedies. Deaths from disease
are exceedingly rare.* Of the settlers, some who declared they
could not live in England from asthma, or other complaints, have
enjoyed such robust health, that they have performed exploring
excursions on foot, for several days successively, carrying their
provisions, and sleeping under trees.</p>
<p class="foot">[* M'Culloch's Dictionary, <i>voce</i> Australia,
p. 224.]</p>
<p>From a meteorological journal, kept by Mr. Collie at King
George's Sound, it appeared that the mean temperature for the
year, taken at eight in the morning, and at sunset, varied from
52° in the coldest month to 66° in the hottest; that rain fell
the least in February, and most in June, namely, four days in the
former, and eighteen days in the latter month; and that the
quantity was least in November, being from that month to March
less than one inch; in April and May 2½ inches; from June to
August 6½ inches; in September, 3, and in October 1½ inch.* It
cannot therefore admit of a doubt that Western Australia is
supplied with rain in sufficient abundance to produce plentifully
all the fruits of the soil.</p>
<p class="foot">[* To those who have not ready access to
thermometrical tables in England, it will be interesting to
compare the degree of heat and quantity of rain in Western
Australia as above stated with those in London during the month
of May last (1840). In that city the thermometer indicated the
highest degree of heat on the 31st, being 73½°, and the lowest on
the 20th, when it was 35°: the mean temperature during the days
of that month was 63½°, and during the nights 46½°, whilst the
mean temperature of night and day together was 55°. The quantity
of rain fallen in London during the same month (May) was two
inches.]</p>
<p>The genial effect of climate upon Australian beauty may be
judged from the following quotation: **</p>
<p class="foot">[** A letter from Sydney, the principal town of
Australia, p. 130.]</p>
<blockquote>"Nevertheless, in spite of many proverbs which
declare that there is no standard of taste, the same human form,
which more than two thousand years ago was embodied by Phidias
and Praxiteles, is still considered the model of perfection by
all refined Europeans. Where does that form most commonly
breathe? In Greece, and even in the very Cyprus, where Adonis was
conceived, and where the Goddess of Beauty had two temples. You
may laugh or sneer, but the latitude of Sydney *** corresponds
exactly with that of Paphos; and it is no less true that the
native Australians **** bear a stronger resemblance to the modern
Greeks than to any other people
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;. As to form
and mien, you shall judge for yourself. The young men of
Australia, like Alfieri and Mr. Hope's modern Greek, are
passionately fond of horses. If you would see one of them, look
in Flaxman's Illustrations of the Iliad, at the figure of Diomed
returning with the spoils of Rhesus. The Australian girls, like
the girls of Genoa, Naples, and the Archipelago, are passionately
fond of swimming. If you would see a group of them, look at
Flaxman's sea nymphs obeying the command of
Thetis&mdash;</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** So also does that of Western Australia.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** The descendants of Europeans.]</p>
<br>
<p class="quote" align="center">'Ye sister Nereids, to your deeps
descend!'</p>
<br>
<blockquote>But Flaxman's outlines represent only form and
mien.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
I do not pretend, however, that <i>all</i> the girls of Australia
are equally beautiful; but I do declare, what you know to be true
of the Ligurian girls, that three out of four of them would be
considered beauties in May-fair."</blockquote>
<p>The following official Reports from medical men will convey
the best evidence of the salubrity of the climate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The favourable opinion I have already expressed of
the influence of this climate on European constitutions, and of
the place as a residence for invalids from India, is strengthened
by a further experience of two years.<br>
<br>
"I have met with several individuals here, who on leaving England
were great sufferers from dyspepsia, and disorders of the
digestive organs, generally from the nervous affections which so
often accompany these&mdash;from hypochondria, from asthma, and
from bronchial diseases&mdash;who have recovered their health in
a remarkable degree since their arrival. Some of slight figure
have become more robust and stronger. Parturition with the female
sex is expeditious and safe; being accomplished by the efforts of
nature alone, within from three to six hours. No woman has died
in childbirth in this colony since its commencement, nor am I
aware of any who died within a month after.<br>
<br>
"Children thrive remarkably well, and I may add every description
of live stock, although collected from different
climates,&mdash;England, India, South America, Africa, &amp;c.,
and various plants and vegetables, collected from as many
different sources, find here a congenial temperature.<br>
<br>
"Indeed I am disposed to conclude, that when the settlers are
well lodged and fed, and the country more cultivated and
improved, but few diseases will be met with; I might perhaps say,
only dysentery and ophthalmia, and these of a mild character.<br>

of the climate of Swan River, I beg leave to state, as a climate,
with regard to health, I am not aware of any other that can be
compared with it.<br>
<br>
"As a proof of its salubrity, during three years His Majesty's
sloop Sulphur was employed upon that station, not a single death,
and very few important cases of disease, occurred;
notwithstanding the very great exposure of her men, not only to
wet, but also night air, in consequence of her boats having been
a great deal employed at a distance from the anchorage. When
exploring the country for several days, and sometimes weeks,
these people have been exposed to the sun, fatigued in the
evening, after a day's excursion, slept in the open air, and that
repeatedly in wet weather, without suffering in the slightest
degree.<br>
<br>
"Another point ought also to be taken into
consideration&mdash;the debilitated state of those constitutions
which were undergoing this exposure, in consequence of having
been so long a period upon salt provisions and without vegetable
diet&mdash;out of three years and ten months the Sulphur was
employed upon the Swan River service, her crew were only 256 days
upon fresh diet. A life of this description in any other climate,

<br>
<p>Medical men attached to our colonial, military, and naval
establishments, have all certified to the peculiar salubrity of
the climate of Western Australia; and it is the opinion of the
late governor, that, in consequence of its genial effect upon the
mind, in producing cheerfulness, and rendering the perceptions
more acute, it is not improbable that the mental powers of future
generations will be materially improved. Sir James Stirling is
convinced that it is peculiarly conducive to health, from his own
extensive experience. During all his various excursions into the
bush, although frequently sleeping on the ground, exposed to the
night air in wet clothes, after fording the rivers, he was never
affected by a cold.</p>
<p>Sir James Stirling, in his official report, thus
observes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That the climate is congenial to health as well as
to enjoyment, there is no reason to doubt. The children born in
this colony appear to be of rapid growth, and are exempt from
many of those diseases which afflict and destroy in childhood so
many persons in more rigorous climates."</blockquote>
<p>This salubrity is attributed to the peculiar dryness of the
atmosphere. Mr. Ogle declares his belief that this climate is the
healthiest and most genial in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, in his interesting collection of letters
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The climate in summer, in the middle of the day is
very warm; most agreeable in the morning and evening; cool and
pleasant at night; sometimes even culd, as it approaches
morning." (p. 49.)</blockquote>
<p>But, unfortunately, such of our compatriots as have no
experience of warmer zones, have a horror of any climate which is
said to be hot, though they may know it, at the same time, to be
dry; a prejudice which is only to be removed by personal
experience. The climate is, unquestionably, congenial to animal
life in general. In the Agricultural Report, referred to above,
we find the following communication:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"A strict practical observer of nine years has
informed us that our climate and soil are most favorably adapted
to the condition of the
horse,&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Indian Establishment commenced at Leschenault, for the rearing of
horses, is a matter of great importance."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ogle observes, that</p>
<blockquote>"The horses have English blood, size and speed,
mingled with the Arab blood:&mdash;some fine draught horses, of
Brabant extraction, are also in the colony. The <i>sheep</i> are
deduced from the purest Merinos, and their fleeces have been
improved by the climate of Australia." (p. 104.)</blockquote>
<p>From the report of Mr. Clark, inserted in the Appendix to Mr.
Macqueen's pamphlet, we learn that</p>
<blockquote>"The interior of Leschenault is peculiarly adapted
for the rearing of horses and cattle, while the sea-coast and
hills afford a great extent of sheep-runs. Swine, too, thrive
amazingly."&mdash;(pp. 54, 55.)</blockquote>
<p>The late governor. Sir James Stirling, observes of this
district, that</p>
<blockquote>"The climate around, and to the south of Leschenault
(Wellington), is the finest in the world, whether it be
considered with reference to health or cultivation. It is <i>free
from excessive drought</i>, as may be proved by the <i>abundance
of perennial streams</i>; and this it owes, no doubt, to its
geographical position, the conformation of the coast, and the
prevailing winds."</blockquote>
<p>The following description of the charms of this climate is
also extracted from a private letter, which we have seen, written
by the present Governor:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mornings and evenings, sunrise and sunset, in this
land, are peculiarly calm, hushed, and beautiful. I never see the
evening sun sink beyond Mount Eliza, without recalling Guido's
Assumption of the Virgin, which was the pride of the British
Institution (I think) three years ago. Distant objects seem
actually painted on the horizon, and their edges appear more
sharply carved out than I ever noticed in Italy." Again: "There
are many proofs of the extreme dryness of this climate. You may
treat articles of steel with a degree of neglect which would be
most injurious in England: they hardly ever rust here. Iron hoops
may be observed scattered in all directions on the ground where
Europeans have been congregated. The hoops of casks in which
stores have been brought out, have been lying exposed to the
atmosphere for years; these are rusted, but very little decayed.
Mildew is very rare here indeed.<br>
<br>
"Thursday, 30th May. My gardener tells me there was ice in the
garden early this morning. I found it cold enough for the use of
fires all the day in rooms not exposed to the sun. We find winter
clothing very comfortable: I did not bring out
enough,&mdash;reckoning upon the summer lasting two-thirds of the
year: instead of which, I find the duration of hot and of cold
weather is pretty nearly as in England. Many persons would now
wish to add a feather-bed (to the mattress) and a blanket at
night<br>
<br>
"The seasons are the opposite of those of England,&mdash;January
being the middle of summer, and July of winter. The summer
extends from the first of November to the first of March; the
spring and autumn are brief, but well defined; the winter of a
bracing coolness, with occasional frosts. The spring months are
September, October, and November; the summer, December, January,
and February; autumn, March, April, and May: winter, June, July,
and August March, April, and August are generally considered the
rainy months. The average temperature of spring is 65.5.; of
summer, 72; of autumn, 66; and of winter, 55, The barometrical
pressure is about 29.94319 inches, and the average of the
thermometer 64 F. Of course, as the land rises above the level of
the ocean, a difference of temperature is felt.<br>
<br>
"The wet season commences with light showers in April, which
continue to increase in number and force throughout Mav, June,
and July, and from that period to decrease, until they cease
altogether, in the month of November, when the dry weather
begins. These two seasons, with an intermediate spring following
the conclusion of each, embrace the circle of the year. It is
usual to call the wet season the winter, and the dry season the
summer, but neither of them has the character of the
corresponding season in Europe.<br>
<br>
"The prevailing wind in the seas adjacent to Cape Leeuwin is from
the westward throughout the year. On the coast, however, land and
sea breezes take place with great regularity during the summer.
In the winter season gales of wind from the north-west and
south-west are very frequent, and are usually accompanied by
heavy falls of rain. At such periods the atmosphere is charged
with moisture to a considerable degree, and the quantity of rain
that has been ascertained to fall at King George's Sound in the
course of the six winter months equals the quantity experienced
in the western counties of England. The atmosphere in the summer
season retains so little moisture, that Bone but hardy and
fibrous plants can withstand the drought The air is so clear, and
the reflection of solar heat so great, that the thermometer
occasionally reaches in the shade near the ground 105°, but the
effect at those times upon the European constitution is not
injurious. This can only be accounted for, under so great a heat,
by the peculiar dryness of the air, and the regular succession of
cool nights after the warmest days. The experience of the last
eight years has established in the minds of the colonists the
full belief that the climate of the settlement is in a remarkable
degree conducive to health and to contort, but it certainly is
not equally suitable to the growth of those vegetable products
which flourish to great advantage in moister climates. With
reference to this point of difference between England and this
new colony, it is perhaps fortunate that it does not resemble the
former country, but may rather be considered, in temperature, as
a supplement to the southern districts of the United Kingdom, and
as affording every range of temperature between the Land's End
and the equatorial regions for the production of commodities
which cannot be raised in the colder atmosphere of the mother
country.<br>
<br>
"As Australia, in every thing regarding climate, is the opposite
of England, it may be observed, that the north is the hot wind,
and the south the cool; the westerly the most unhealthy, and the
east the most salubrious; it is summer with the colonists when it
is winter at home, and the thermometer is considered to rise
before bad weather, and to fall before good. To these diversities
it may be added that the swans are black, and the eagles white;
the mole lays eggs, and has a duck's bill; the kangaroo has five
claws on its fore paws, three talons on its hind-legs, like a
bird, and yet hops on its tail; there is a bird which has a broom
in its mouth instead of a tongue: the cod is found in the rivers,
and the peroh in the sea; the valleys are cold and barren, and
the mountain tops warm and fertile; the nettle is a lofty tree,
and the poplar a dwarfish shrub; the pears are of wood, with the
stalk at the broad end; the cherry grows with the stone outside;
the fields are fenced with mahogany; the humblest house fitted up
with cedar, and the myrtle plants are burnt for fuel. Such are
the opposites of England and Terra Australia."</blockquote>
<p>The unquestionable character of the evidence afforded above
relative to the fitness of the soil for producing the richest
treasures of the vegetable kingdom, to the discovery of many of
the most useful minerals, as well as to the extraordinary
salubrity of the climate for Europeans, must have fully
established the eligibility of Western Australia for the
investment of capital, and the employment of labour therein.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> best proof of excellent qualities
of soil and climate is derivable from the natural productions,
whether indigenous or exotic, which flourish within their
influence.</p>
<p>Superior timber, fit for almost any purpose of house or
ship-building, wheelwrights' work, cabinet-making, &amp;c.
abounds in Western Australia This subject has been investigated
by Mr. Trigg, in consequence of its having been loosely asserted
that the country was not well-timbered.* This gentleman reports,
with particular reference to mahogany,** of which he appears to
have considerable practical knowledge, that on leaving the Swan
and Canning rivers, and exploring the mountain range, near Rushy
Stream, he found mahogany forests of four miles in depth, which
are known to extend for a length of 140 miles, or to cover an
area of 358,400 acres, giving timber enough to build 18,000
line-of-battle ships, or twenty British navies!</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Report of the Agricultural Society of
Western Australia, 3rd August, 1838, printed at Perth, Western
Australia, by C. Macfaull.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The tree called in Australia the
<i>mahogany</i>, is not precisely the tree commonly known by that
name, though the wood bears a strong resemblance to it.]</p>
<blockquote>"The length of stem of this tree, taking the average,
may be sixty-five feet, many being much longer, and without a
knot or branch in all that length; and they are nearly equal in
size all the way up, and may be said to be monuments of nature.
Some objection has been raised to our exporting Australian timber
to Europe, on account of the distance. I do not think (observes
Mr. Trigg) it a serious objection, for even under our great want
of labour, and consequent expense of shipment, I should have no
objection to be bound (were I inclined again to go into business)
to ship any quantity over 300 loads in four, six, and eight-inch
plank, from the farthest point of road, at the rate of 6<i>l</i>.
10<i>s</i>. per load, of fifty cubic feet, and in some places, I
have no doubt, it could be shipped much cheaper."</blockquote>
<p>Some of this mahogany, amongst other valuable qualities, is
proof against destruction by the white ant, and of great
durability under all circumstances. Such portions as are lighter
in weight and colour are used for sashes, doors, mouldings,
cabinet-work, &amp;c., being greatly preferable to the Sydney
cedar for these purposes; but it is also used for boat-building,
possessing all the required pliability. During the nine years of
Mr. Trigg's experience it was never touched by worms. The plank
used in the repairs of Her Majesty's ship <i>Success</i>, in
Cockburn Sound, at the commencement of the colony, remained, up
to the latest accounts, entirely unmolested by worms. When this
frigate was overhauled at Portsmouth, the officers of the
dock-yard found this timber in such perfect preservation, that,
on their report, the lords of the admiralty instructed Sir James
Stirling to send a quantity of it to England: specimens, taken
out of the <i>Success</i>, are preserved in the model room of the
surveyor-general of the navy at Somerset House.</p>
<p>The Australian mahogany tree is of magnificent proportions;
its girth being sometimes upwards of forty feet, and the length
of its stem one hundred and forty feet before the eye meets with
a branch. The best mahogany, observed by Sir J. Stirling in the
Western Provinces, grows behind Roe's Range, in the Wellington
(or Leschenault) county.</p>
<p>A tree more peculiar, however, to this region, is the
<i>Shea-oak</i> or <i>Casuarina</i>, which, besides its graceful
form in the landscape, is admirably adapted for shingles, less
liable than other kinds to decay, or to injury from the attacks
of the white ant.</p>
<p><i>Acacias</i> are numerous, and the <i>Cypress</i> exists in
many parts.</p>
<p>Of the Gum-tree of this country, all persons must have heard.
It is of three species;&mdash;the blue, white, and red. The blue
gum-tree (which grows to a gigantic height) has been estimated by
an eminent ship-builder in England, to be equal, if not superior
to teak, in the construction of ships. Captain Banister speaks,
as follows, of the blue gum-tree which he observed in one of his
expeditions: *</p>

speak of their magnitude. I measured one; it was forty-two feet
in circumference (breast high from the ground) and in height
before the appearance of a branch, 140 or 150 feet, and as
straight as the barrel of a gun: from the immense growth of these
trees (he adds), I formed an opinion that the land upon which
they grew could not be bad; what we did see was a brown loam,
capable of any cultivation, and, where the underwood was not
remarkably thick, grass and herbage grew
luxuriantly."</blockquote>
<p>Dr. J. B. Wilson, R.N., bears similar testimony to the
gigantic size of this remarkable tree.</p>
<blockquote>"The blue gum," says Mr. Trigg, "is rather a
fine-grained wood, and works well, especially for wheelwrights,
and millwrights, and is better than the white gum of Mount Eliza.
When seasoned, it is very hard; it would be found valuable for
sheaves or blocks; answer all the purposes to which lignum-vitæ
is applied, and be much cheaper, from its size and abundance. The
red gum-tree may be used to advantage for rails, paling, and
shingles; for which latter purpose it is likely to become an
article of <i>export</i>; it may also be made serviceable for
staves, if well assorted. It is usually the indication of good
land. The <i>Tewart</i> of the Vasse and Augusta is said by the
same authority to be a similar kind of wood, and being more "free
in growth," and of great length, might be used for keels,
keelsons, beams, &amp;c. in ship-building. This country produces
also fine scented sandal wood. <i>Wattles</i> grow abundantly,
the bark of which contains the tanning principle. One great
characteristic feature of the scenery, and of the vegetation of
Australia, is the <i>grass tree (Xanthorrea hastile</i>).* Mr.
Moore observes that the sight of one of these put him in mind of
a tall black native, with a spear in his hand, ornamented with a
tuft of rushes. "These vary in size," he says, "from those
peeping over the surface to those in the swampy grounds, eight or
ten feet high, with a spear equally long, growing out at the
stem, and bearing at the top a beautiful flower; on the spear is
found an excellent, clear, transparent gum, and from the lower
part of the tree oozes a black gum, which makes a powerful
cement, used by the natives for fastening stone heads on their
hammers.** The country, indeed, presents an endless variety of
flowering trees and shrubs." In the course of his excursions, Mr.
Moore met with a variety of sylvan productions: he notices a tree
like a crab-apple, bearing, in abundance, round nuts of a-walnut
taste; a species of thorn (the <i>mespilus</i>) bearing a
fragrant white blossom and fruit like the sloe. In another place
he "cut some bark from a tree, which smelled like
<i>raspberry</i> jam."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* They are commonly known in the colony by the
name of "Black Boys."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** This gum-resin may be obtained in
inexhaustible quantities: large samples of it have been already
sent to England, and a varnish has been produced from it for
carriage panels, &amp;c.]</p>
<p>And again, 4th December, 1831.</p>
<blockquote>"I have just heard of a tree which is at Freemantle,
bearing fruit which answers for preserves and pies; it is said to
resemble an apple, with a thick pulp and rough
kernel."</blockquote>
<p>The <i>beef-wood</i> tree is a hard wood, and adapted to
purposes of cabinet-making; it is a common production of the soil
of this country, and bears a splendid orange blossom, resembling
that of the laburnum at a distance, but much finer.</p>
<p>The <i>Banksia</i>, called the honeysuckle-tree, from a sweet
tasting substance contained in its flowering cone, has a hard,
grey, gravelly-looking bark, as if composed of <i>coarse
granite</i>. It furnishes the best firewood.</p>
<p>It has been somewhat rashly asserted of Australia, as well as
of the intertropical regions of Africa, that none of the native
flowers have fragrance. Mr. Moore, writing in August 1831, the
<i>winter</i> season in Australia, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The air at this moment is perfumed by a shrub
resembling jessamine, bearing a <i>yellow</i> flower; this is the
fifth odoriferous plant I have met with; the ground seems almost
covered with it"</blockquote>
<p>And, again, in July of the following year, he
remarks&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The air is already fragrant with many flowers and
shrubs coming into bloom; what will it not be when we have groves
of oranges, limes, almonds, peaches, apples, &amp;c., as
unquestionably we shall have!" *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Moore's Letters, pp. 77 and 171.]</p>
<p>The <i>grasses</i> of this country are luxuriant and various.
Several species of poa, holcus and avena, are found here,** and
indeed, numerous varieties of English grasses. Horses thrive
well, and may be kept in good condition upon grass alone; though
maize and other corn are sometimes given to them when regularly
employed in agricultural labour: corn is never taken during
exploring excursions, the horses being turned out to pasture.***
<i>Kangaroo-grass</i> has much the appearance of a field of oats
before harvest. The native lucerne bears a leaf, a pod, and a
blossom, like those of the pea.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Ibid, p. 135.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** "Hay is cut in November, and may be made up
six hours after cutting, without risk of its heating in the
stack. Although the grass is much burnt up in the summer, live
stock keep in good condition upon it; and young cattle are
remarked to be as large at nine months old as they would be in
England at twelve: this is attributed to their being enabled to
graze all the year without being penned. The fine condition of
the herds shews the pasture to be good. Indeed, so very
nutritious is the herbage, that farmers frequently give no other
food than the hay of that country to their English horses, which
appear in excellent condition, although employed in drawing heavy
loads."&mdash;<i>Irwin</i>.]</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, who seems to possess a keen relish for the beauties
of nature, observes that</p>
<blockquote>"There are in this country a hundred different kinds
of plants, shrubs, flowers, &amp;c., of which he knows not the
names; but one plant, very abundant, is called wild carrot; then
there are the trefoil, penny-royal, rib grass, sorrel, dock,
fern, moss (<i>hygrocrocis</i>), sow-thistle (<i>carduus</i>),
burnet, yarrow, eringo, parsley, celery, samphire (<i>sedum</i>),
wyay or native yarn, davisia, and several blue, white, red, and
yellow climbers and creepers, clematis, anigozanthus,
chrysanthemum, orobus solis, orchis, cardinal, rockets, daisies,
primroses, buttercups, geraniums, flowers resembling bunches of
violets, close to the ground, the everlasting pink growing in
great quantities wherever a tree has been burnt down; a
blue-flowered grass with yellow stamina, resembling the Star of
Bethlehem, or spider lily; and a beautiful purple flower, which
looks as if it were trimmed with lace, and called here the
laceflower, besides many others."</blockquote>
<p>Asparagus, and tobacco, as well as hemp and flax, have been
discovered to be indigenous. The flax (<i>phormium tenax</i>) has
been observed of good quality, though smaller than that of New
Zealand, and in much less abundance. In the district of the
Brunswick river, where the soil of the valleys is generally rich.
Sir James Stirling has pulled flax (<i>linum</i>) of spontaneous
growth, seven and a half feet in length. An attention to so fine
a production must needs prove profitable. A valuable substitute
for hemp or flax has also been discovered in the bark of a tree,
of which excellent cordage has been made. It is called the
tree-hark hemp. The catalogue of native edible productions is not
very extensive;. but every production of the soil which ministers
to the necessities or luxuries of life, which can be collected
from temperate and from tropical regions, may be produced upon
the soil of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The admirable adaptation of this country to the purposes of
wheat-growing, is proved beyond all doubt.* Samples of Western
Australian wheat have been seen in England, which averaged from
62lbs. to 65lbs. per bushel; the land yielding it at the rate of
about 60 bushels to the acre.** Barley also grows in great
excellence, and makes fine malt; for, from a bushel and a half
thereof (dried in the sun) and one pound of hops, twenty gallons
of good ale, and fifteen of small beer have been brewed.*** The
quantity of land producing wheat was, in 1838, treble that which
was so cultivated in 1834; and there has been a similar increase
in barley. Kaffre corn appears, from the 3rd Annual Report of the
Western Australian Agricultural Society, to be almost entirely
superseding maize, as it thrives better without the expense of
manure.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir J. Stirling's Report, June 1837.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** During the calamitous visitation of drought,
which desolated New South Wales in 1838 and 1839, considerable
quantities of wheat were exported from this colony to Sydney and
South Australia.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Captain Irwin, p. 10.]</p>
<p>Turnips, particularly the Swedish, give a sure and productory
crop. Potatoes, which do not here, as in the West Indies or
tropical Africa, lose their farinaceous properties and become
sweet like an inferior parsnip, produce every where fair crops,
and, in the alluvial soils, good ones. Radishes, grown only in
sand, have measured. Captain Irwin informs us, <i>four</i> feet
round the root; and a plant of mangel-wurzel, grown in sandy soil
on the Upper Swan, was six feet in circumference!</p>
<blockquote>"The culture of the vine, fig, peachy and melon tribe
has been carried thus early to a very considerable extent, and if
ever it should be desirable for the mother country to possess a
<i>wine-growing colony</i>, the soils and seasons of this country
afford reasonable ground for anticipating a successful issue to
such a speculation." ****</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Drummond, the government botanist, who during several
years was placed in charge of the public garden at Perth, says,
in a report on its progress:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The <span class="uu">Vines</span> planted in May
1831, have made shoots, in what is past of this season, sixteen
feet long, and the strongest and finest wood I have ever seen:

and produced 150 plants; all the other plants in the garden
thrive as well as the best friends of the colony can
wish."</blockquote>
<p>We have before us a manuscript catalogue of the fruits,
flowers, and vegetables growing in the government garden at Perth

<p>Sheep's Wool, in this, as in all the settlements in Australia,
will be the staple produce. The colony abounds with almost
unlimited ranges of natural pasture; and is congenial by climate,
soil, and the grasses which it grows spontaneously, to the
general health of sheep. The interior of Western Australia is
particularly valuable for its sheep pastures. These are extensive
tracts of undulating surface, covered with a short succulent
grass, and are found to be admirably suited for Merino flocks.
Sheep are there exempt from a disease supposed to originate from
feeding in marshy pastures. Recent explorations have not only
confirmed former opinions of the extent of the pastoral districts
in the interior, but have added some not before known. Added to
which, the increased experience of those settlers on the only
located district of this description, more than confirms the
opinions formerly entertained of it for the breeding of
fine-woolled sheep. The following information, on the prospects
of the settlement in regard to the growth of wool, is derived
from Sir J. Stirling's <i>Statistical Report</i>, dated 15th of
October, 1837:</p>
<blockquote>"The number of sheep in the colony at the present
time is 12,000. Their rate of increase is found to be, exclusive
of the wethers and the proceeds of wool, about 40 per cent. per
annum, or they double their numbers in each period of two years.
No obstacle is found at present to the extension of sheep
keeping, and, therefore, at the rate specified, without any fresh
importations, the number of sheep in the colony, in 1847, may be
expected to amount to 400,000, giving an export in wool of the
value of 100,000<i>l</i>."</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1834, the number of sheep existing in Western
Australia did not exceed 3,545; but in the year 1838, the number
had increased to 15,590; and, in 1839, to 21,038.</p>
<p>The exports of wool from Western Australia had advanced from
5,884lb, valued at 500<i>l</i>., in the year 1834, to 22,450lb,
valued at 1684<i>l</i>. sterling in 1837; the quantity being
nearly quadrupled in the short space of three years.</p>
<p>The return profit of sheep-farming is estimated at from
75<i>l</i>. to 80<i>l</i>. per cent. per annum. Such a profit,
combined with the means of extending indefinitely the number of
sheep farms, must attract, in the course of a few years, to this
branch of investment, a large amount of capital.</p>
<p>The cattle existing in Australia have all been introduced
within a recent period. In the year 1834, the number of head of
live stock was as follows:</p>

<p>An augmentation which justifies the observation contained in
the Appendix to Sir J. Stirling's <i>Statistical Report</i> to
the end of June 1837; <i>viz</i>. that</p>
<blockquote>"Horses and cattle may be expected to multiply
rapidly from this time forward. In addition to the numbers of the
latter, stated in the preceding return, there are known to exist
four or five wild herds * in different parts of the colony, which
have maintained themselves without protection against the natives
for several years, and are rapidly increasing their
numbers."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* These consist of <i>strayed</i> cattle.]</p>
<p>The Perth Gazette of 13th July, 1839, states the important
fact, that the Cashmere goat has been introduced into the colony
by W. Tanner, Esq.</p>
<p>Clay of all sorts, and fit for all purposes, is found in many
parts of the colony: brick, pottery, pipe, or china clay is
abundant in the Wellington district; and above Perth, on the
banks of the Swan, there is the finest plaster-stone in the
world. Lime-stone, and all the more valuable materials for
building purposes, abound on the shores of the Wellington
district. Pottery and tile making have not, hitherto been
resorted to with complete success, not from any deficiency of the
raw material, but from lack of skill and labour; these
manufactures, therefore, are open to enterprise, with every
prospect of success.</p>
<p>Coal has been discovered in the northern parts of this colony,
by that enterprising and intelligent officer, Captain Grey.</p>
<h4>ZOOLOGY.</h4>
<p>The natural history of Western Australia is similar to that of
New South Wales. The indigenous animals are few in number, and
some of them have no prototypes in the old world. No wild beasts
of the feræ genus have yet been discovered, unless the wild dog
is to be so considered.</p>
<p>Animal existence in Australia assumes a form more anomalous
than even that which marks its botany. The following tables have
been constructed from the "<i>Règne Animal</i>," of Cuvier, with
the additions of Griffith, Gray, &amp;c., the Zoology of Shaw,
the Transactions of the Linnæean Society, and the works of
various travellers in Australia.</p>

<p>It has not yet been possible to construct a satisfactory table
for Insects and Fish.</p>
<p>From these results, however, it appears that the native
animals of Australia are few in number, and very peculiar in
kind. Of all the known Mammalia in the world, but fifty-eight
species, or about the one-seventeenth part of the whole, belong
originally to this region; and, of these fifty-eight, more than
one half are of the <i>Marsupial</i> order. The four important
orders of <i>Carnivora,* Quadrumana, Pachydermata</i>, and
<i>Ruminantia</i>, are, absolutely, without any known
land-representatives in this extensive portion of the globe. Of
the <i>Edentata</i>, the genera <i>Echidna</i>, and
<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, are destitute of teats, and do not suckle
their young. The former genus (<i>Echidna</i>) consists of two
species of porcupines, one entirely covered with thick spines,
the other clothed with hair, in which the spines are half hidden.
The <i>Ornithorhynchi</i> consist, also, of two
species&mdash;<i>O. rufus</i> and <i>O. fuscus</i>, Possessing
the body, the fur, and habits of a mole, the webbed feet, and the
bill of a duck, being ovoviviparous, and having the internal
formation of a reptile, these creatures lead a burrowing life
amid the mud of rivers and swamps. They are very shy in their
habits.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Deducting the marine mammals of the seal genus
(<i>Phoca</i>), the <i>dingo</i> or native dog,&mdash;that
constant companion of man,&mdash;is the sole representative of
Cuvier's order of <i>Carnivora</i>.]</p>
<p>Of the <i>Rodentia</i>, two species belong to the sub-genus,
<i>Hydromys</i>, and consist of creatures that seem to unite some
of the peculiarities of the dormouse, rat, and beaver. A new
genus of Rodentia was made knovm by Mitchell's expedition in
1835, which is called by Ogilby, <i>Conilurus</i>, to mark its
general resemblance to a rabbit. It is, however, a rat; and the
species found by Mitchell, the only one at present known, is
remarkable for the formidable defence which it builds for itself,
against the <i>dingo</i> (native dog), and birds of prey.** Two
species of mice (both peculiar), and the <i>Dipus Mitchellii</i>
(the Australian Jerboa), complete the list of <i>Rodentia</i>,
unless the <i>Myrmecobius rufus</i>, or "red shrew mouse," belong
to that order.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "The flat-tailed rat builds an enormous nest
of branches and boughs, so interlaced as to be proof against any
attacks of the native dog!"&mdash;<span class=
"uu">Mitchell</span>: ii. 61.<br>
<br>
"There was also the rabbit-rat, which climbs trees like the
Opossum."&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.<br>
<br>
Another remarkable animal, closely allied to <i>Perameles</i>,
(<i>Choeropus Ecaudatus</i>), was discovered by Major
Mitchell;&mdash;the feet resembling those of a pig&mdash;having
the marsupial opening downwards, instead of upwards, as in the
kangaroo&mdash;being about the size of a rabbit, but without a
tail.<br>
<br>
The Pataroo, or kangaroo rat, is an animal with a long pointed
head, short fore paws, and long hind ones, like other kinds of
kangaroo. It is about the size of a rabbit, when six months
old.]</p>
<p>With these few exceptions, the whole of the Australian
Mammalia consist of the very peculiar order, <i>Marsupialia</i>,
of which order more than four-sevenths are absolutely limited to
this continent, and its adjacent islands. The leading peculiarity
in animals of this order is the birth of the young in an immature
state. From the time of this premature birth, without limbs or
other external organs, the little animal remains attached to the
teat of its mother (which enlarges so as completely to fill the
mouth), and lies enclosed in a natural pouch, formed by the skin
of the abdomen. It is this pouch which is the distinctive mark of
the order; and its use induced Linnæus to arrange such species of
these animals as he knew, under his genus, <i>Didelphys</i>, a
word signifying double uterus. At the period of full development,
the young fall from the teat, and this may be regarded as the
real moment of birth; but, for a long time thereafter, the dam
continues to carry her offspring in the same receptacle; and the
latter, even after they can walk, constantly return thither on
the approach of danger. The <i>Kangaroo</i> (<i>Macropus</i>) the
largest animal of this order, and of Australian Mammalia, is
sometimes equal in size to a young calf, very large in its hinder
quarters, and disproportionally small forwards. Its fore legs are
very short, and quite useless to the animal for progression,
which is effected by a succession of leaps, assisted materially
by the leverage of its long and powerful tail. The attitude is
erect, except when feeding; the colour, generally, various shades
of grey. One species, however, is red and white. The other
animals are the Potoroos (<i>Hypstprymnus</i>), Phalangers, the
Dasyuri, the Parameles, the Petaurista, the Phascolarctos, and
the Phascolomys. The different species of these genera vary in
size from that of a rat to that of a dog; the largest, the
<i>Thylacinus</i>, or dog-faced Opossum, and Dasyurus ursinus
(the <i>devil</i> of the colonists), being confined to Van
Diemen's Land. The former resembles closely an ill-made dog, but
is marked with Zebra-like stripes. The Phalangers (ring-tailed
opossums), are not all distinguished by united toes. The
Petaurista (flying opossums), are a sub-genus of the Phalangers,
sometimes called flying Phalangers: such is the squirrel opossum.
The Parameles (bandicoots) approach, in form and habits, to the
badgers, and, indeed, are called pouched badgers. The
Phascolarctos consists of only one known species, and is a sort
of sloth. The Phascolomys contains, at present, but one species,
called by the colonists, <i>Wombat</i>. It is a plantigrade
animal, extremely slow in its motion, and about the size of a
badger. The Potoroo is, also, only of one species; it is a
diminutive kangaroo, commonly called the kangaroo rat.
<i>Kangaroos</i> are gregarious and herbivorous; * their flesh is
savoury and nutritious, resembling venison; and their fleece and
hide are likewise valuable to man. They are naturally watchful,
gentle, and timid; but, when pursued, and no longer able to bound
away, they will turn and fight both dogs and men, courageously
using, not only their powerful hind legs, but their short
fore-paws, with great vigour and dexterity.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Some species, however, are partially
carnivorous.]</p>
<br>
<p>The <span class="aa">Ornithology</span> of Australia is less
anomalous than its Mammalogy; there being but two of the
Australian orders of birds which are wholly peculiar,&mdash;the
<i>Syndactyles</i>, and <i>Scansores</i>.</p>
<p><i>Accipitres</i>.&mdash;The birds of prey found in Australia
correspond in general with those found in Europe; they are armed
with hooked beaks and talons, and are capable of pursuing other
birds, and even the weaker quadrupeds and reptiles. One kind of
vulture, described by Latham, is so courageous and bold, that he
has even been known to attack the natives themselves, when
pressed by hunger. The cream-bellied falcon, the orange-speckled
hawk, and the milk white hawk, are common varieties; the last
especially is found to make great havoc among the poultry. The
most singular among the rapacious birds is a <i>White Eagle</i>.
Among the Owls, that which is most frequently met with is the
<i>buck-buck</i>, as it is called by the natives. This bird may
be heard, every night during winter, uttering a cry corresponding
with its name. Although the cry is known to every one, yet the
bird itself is known to few, in consequence of its shyness, and
appearing only in the night. The note of the bird is somewhat
like that of the European cuckoo, and the colonists have given it
that name. Some persons, too, are led away by the popular error
that every thing else, like the seasons of the year, is the
reverse in this country to what they are in England; and the
cuckoo, as they call this bird, is pointed out in consequence of
its singing by night, as one of the proofs of this fact.</p>
<p><i>Dentirostres</i>.&mdash;In this order are some species of
transcendant plumage. The <i>Superb Warbler</i>, a bird having
the habits of the redbreast, is, perhaps, the most beautiful.
There are also some <i>variegated</i> thrushes; and a species of
thrush, called thunder-bird, has obtained from the colonists the
name of the <i>laughing jackass</i>, from his peculiarly loud and
dissonant cry. The <i>Wattle-bird</i> utters a chattering note.
The larks are but poor imitations of those of Europe, and appear
to belong to Cuvier's genus of field-larks.</p>
<p><i>Fissirostres</i>.&mdash;Swallows and goat-suckers, of this
order, are numerous.</p>
<p><i>Conirostres</i>.&mdash;Beautiful birds of Paradise are
found in Australia, as well as New Guinea. There are also several
magpies and crows of this order.</p>
<p><i>Tenuirostres</i>.&mdash;The various species of the Epimachi
are, like the birds of Paradise, confined to the northern parts
of Australia; like them, their plumage ranks amongst the most
beautiful; and, like them, too, they have been the subjects of
innumerable fables.</p>
<p><i>Syndactyles</i>.&mdash;The king-fishers and bee-eaters of
Australia are peculiar to the country; the most beautiful in
plumage being the <i>sacred</i> king-fisher, and
<i>variegated</i> bee-eater.</p>
<p>It is said, by Dr. Litchfield, that some specimens of the
trochilus, or humming-bird, have been recently found in
Australia; the brilliancy of their colours, and the elegance of
their forms, are but ill conveyed by description. The American
Indians, struck with the fire and splendour of their hues, which
shine with the united radiance of gems and gold, have given their
feathers the expressive name of hairs of the sun. The nest of the
humming bird is constructed of a silken down, procured from
flowers; the eggs are never more than two in number, and the male
and female assist each other in the labour of incubation. The cry
uttered by the humming bird resembles the syllables <i>se're</i>,
and is made only when they are in search of one another. They
fight desperately with each other, and exhibit equal courage in
attacking other birds, who approach their nest; they frequently
attack larger birds with provocation, put them to flight, and
even pursue them. Humming birds feed on the nectar leaves, and
some naturalists think, on insects also; they rarely live long in
a state of captivity.</p>
<p><i>Scansores</i>.&mdash;All the Australian species of this
order are likewise peculiar, consisting of parrots, parroquets,
cockatoos, &amp;c. They are very numerous in the Australian
woods, and have every variety of plumage. They have stout, hard,
solid beaks, rounded on all sides, and enveloped at the base by a
membrane, in which the nostrils are pierced, and enclosing a
fleshy and rounded tongue, two circumstances which give them the
greatest facility in imitating the human voice. The inferior
windpipe, which is complicated and furnished on each side with
three muscles, also contributes to this facility; they feed on
all sorts of food, climb among branches of trees by the aid of
the beak and claws, and build in the hollow psirts of the
trunk.</p>
<p>Every large island in the tropics has its peculiar species of
parrots, the short wings of the birds preventing them from
crossing any large extent of water; none are equal in delicacy of
tint and beauty to the birds of Australia.</p>
<p>The toucan is easily distinguished from all other birds, by an
enormous beak, which is almost as thick and as long as the body,
light and cellular, internally arcuated near the end, and
furnished with a long, narrow, and ciliated tongue. These birds
live in small flocks, feed on fruit and insects, and also devour
the eggs of other birds, and even their unfledged offspring. The
structure of the beak compels them to swallow their food without
mastication: when they have seized it, they toss the morsel into
the air, catch it as it falls, and thus swallow it with greater
facility.</p>
<p><i>Gallinæ</i>.&mdash;Pheasants, quails, and pigeons, are
tolerably numerous; and, according to P. Cunningham, the mountain
pheasant is a bird of <i>song</i>. One of the most remarkable
varieties of the pigeon is the <i>bronze-winged</i>.</p>
<p><i>Grallæ</i>.&mdash;The cassowary, or <i>Emu</i>, is found in
nearly all parts of Australia. It is a very wild creature, and
runs faster than an English greyhound. The eggs are very much
elongated, and of a green colour; the flesh is somewhat coarse,
but eatable, especially that of the young. The emu may be tamed,
when caught young.</p>
<p>Australia has also some species of bustard, curlew, herons,
avasets, rails, snipes, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Palmipedes</i>&mdash;That <i>rara avis</i> of the poet, the
<i>cygnus niger</i>, or <i>black swan</i>, is found here. Like
the other kinds of swan, it droops when in a state of captivity,
and becomes less graceful and imposing in its carriage. Swans are
amongst the fiercest of the feathered tribes; they are even known
to combat with the eagle, striking hard and repeated blows with
the wing, which is said to be powerful enough to break the leg of
a man. The swan is generally a bird of peace, but, as with other
animals, not forgetting the rational lord of the creation, the
fiercest passions originate from the most delightful. The rival
males in this species fight with the utmost desperation, each, in
turn, trying to suffocate the other by holding his head under the
water. These duels, which sometimes last whole days, often
terminate in the death of one or both of the champions.
<i>Gannets</i>, or <i>Boobies</i>, are so numerous as to have
given the latter name to an island on the North Coast; penguins,
petrels, and ducks, of a peculiar kind, also abound in this
region. The <i>Cereopsis</i>, allied to the goose, is an
important addition to the poultry-yard, and might be
advantageously acclimated in England.</p>
<p>William Hutt, Esq., M.P., has presented to the Western
Australian Company, amongst other specimens in natural history,
those of <i>Podargus Cuvieri</i>, male and female, the Australian
goat-sucker, of gigantic proportions; of the
<i>Calyptorhynchus</i>, male and female, the beak, as the name
imports, being covered with feathers; <i>Platycercus
zonarius</i>, a rare bird, having a yellow breast; specimens of
the bronze or golden-wing Pigeon, male and female; and of the
<i>Ardea nycticorax</i>, female (called Ibis), remarkable for the
pectinated form of the middle claw, which has a very finely
minute comb attached sideways to the claw.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Reptilia</span>.&mdash;The reptiles of
Australia are comparatively more numerous than either the
Mammalia or the Aves. They consist of two or three genera of
turtles; as many varieties of alligators, a considerable number
of lizards and serpents, both venomous and harmless. The great
<i>lacertcæ</i>, as alligators, &amp;c., do not appear to have
been found in "Western Australia. The land-lizard, and the
Coluber-porphyitacus (crimson-sided snake), are of extraordinary
beauty. Serpents, also, of different species, have been seen
floating upon the water, in chase of the curious ponquin. Frogs
are numerous. The <i>chlamydosaurus Kingii</i> (a lizard) is
remarkable for a <i>frill</i> behind the head and above the
shoulders.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Pisces</span>.&mdash;The fish are without
number, from the whale to the shrimp. The snapper (<i>sparus</i>)
seems the most common, and weighs from ten to forty pounds. A
small white-fleshed fish, tasting like young salmon, is caught in
great numbers. There is a silver-coloured fish, apparently devoid
of scales, which glitters like polished silver, and about a foot
and a half in length; under the nose it has long pendulous
cartilaginous antennæ, with which it is supposed it collects its
food, which it grinds in an apparatus in its mouth like
mill-stones: the backbone is of a transparent kind of whalebone,
and it has two stomachs. Cockles, muscles, oysters, cray-fish,
prawns, teem all along the coasts. Great quantities of the
<i>bêche-la-mer</i> are found on the shores near the Swan River.
The sharks are numerous, and sometimes play pranks which almost
tax our belief.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Anecdote of the Leschenault
Shark</i>.&mdash;"One fine morning, with a light breeze from the
southward and eastward, and very little swell, the Harvest, lying
in Koombâna Bay, Port Leschenault, was found to be drifting. She
was riding at single anchor, and rather short cable, in
consequence of the fine weather; more cable was veered out, but
it was of no avail. She continued drifting, until it was thought
advisable to let go the best bower, of twenty-two hundred weight,
the former being a stream anchor, of only fourteen hundred.<br>
<br>
"The surprise of the master and officers was very great, knowing
as they did that the bottom was excellent holding-ground; but as
the first anchor might have been foul, they weighed, and, to
their still greater astonishment, found all right and clear. At
this period some person on board expressed a suspicion that all
was not right with the buoy, which was immediately ordered to be
hauled on board, an operation usually requiring but little
strength; in this case, however, it was found necessary to put on
a strong purchase-tackle, when the men forward sung out, 'There's
a young whale fast to the buoy-rope by the tail!' which proved,
however, to be an enormous shark, judged to be nearly thirty feet
long, fast to the buoy-rope near the anchor, by what is termed by
sailors a 'cow-hitch' round the small of the tail. The shark had
evidently hitched himself, and in his struggles to get loose had
hitched himself still faster, and at the same time had capsized
the anchor, which, being only fourteen hundred weight, it could
easily do, and thereby causing the vessel to drift so
unaccountably. The head and shoulders of this huge monster were
not seen, as the available purchase was not sufficiently powerful
to hoist the whole of it out of the water, there being at the
same time a large whale alongside, and the men and heavy
purchase-tackle were engaged in the operation of 'cutting-in.'
'The liver of the shark was obtained, and produced, when tryed
down, above thirty-five gallons of oil, now in the possession of
the Government resident of that place."]</p>
<p>The enormous cuttle fish, rolling like a huge cask on the
tumbling waves, is also observed stretching forth its monstrous
tentaculæ, seven or eight feet long, to catch the little nautilus
which inadvertently floats within its grasp.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Insecta</span>.&mdash;The insects are very
numerous, and many of the butterflies, moths, and beetles, are
brilliant and beautiful. Locusts abound in the hottest season. In
swampy places musquitoes are found, and are troublesome to those
who dwell near them; they are scarcely known in the upper lands.
Scorpions and centipedes are found among dead wood, and in the
clefts of the rocks; but are neither numerous nor troublesome.
Flies, the blow-fly, <i>musca carnivora</i>, in particular, are
numerous in some districts, and great plunderers of the
larders.</p>
<p>The gum-grub, or <i>gru-gru</i>, is by some gastronomists
considered a great dainty, being similar to fine marrow, when
fried with bread crumbs: the natives prefer it raw. The insect is
about six inches long, and about half an inch in diameter.</p>
<p>Some species of ants in Australia are provided with wings, and
may be seen issuing from a hole in the earth, flying about in
every direction, and then suddenly disappearing, after strewing
the ground with their wings. A similar species of ant abounds in
Western Africa in the rainy season.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Botany</span>.&mdash;The names of Banks,
Brown, and Cunningham, are imperishably associated with the
botany of Australia; an outline of the arrangement of its
different orders is exhibited in the following table.</p>

<p>The first great division of plants is into two classes; first,
the <i>Cryptogamous</i>, such as mosses, ferns, fungi, &amp;c.,
which have no blossoms, nor visible means of fructification, and
the <i>Phanerogamous</i>, which are reproduced by visible organs.
<i>This class</i> includes all the higher orders of vegetables,
but is subdivided into Monocotyledonous plants, such as have but
one seed lobe; and Dicotyledonous plants, which are possessed of
two or more;&mdash;the former comprising the grasses, cyperaceæ,
&amp;c.; and the latter those productions of the earth, the
organization of which is most complicated, as trees, superior
shrubs, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The indigenous and useful timber has been treated of in a
former part of this chapter: it is generally of the hardwood
kind, and consists of all the varieties of Eucalyptus and
Casuarina, with some varieties of the rose-wood, sandal-wood,
cedar, &amp;c. Most of the eucalypti are called gum-trees, though
the exudations of many of them are properly resins, being
insoluble in water; whilst others yield a manna as pure as any of
Arabia. Another species yields the gum Arabic. There is a tree
here called the tea-tree (<i>Melaleuca</i>), the leaves of which
are used by the Sealers on Kangaroo Island as a substitute for
the Chinese plant, and afford a good beverage. There are also
some medicinal trees, as the sassafras and castor-oil tree. The
stringy-bark tree is found to be an excellent substitute for the
common pine. The mahogany is hard, dark, heavy, and durable.*
Palms are limited to the North and East shores, on the former of
which, the tropical mangrove grows in all its luxuriance; and,
indeed, the peculiar aspect of Australian vegetation disappears
in this part of the continent, being superseded by one
assimilating more to that of India.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Two specimens of Australian mahogany are in
the possession of the Secretary to the Colonial Club, St. James's
Square. The beauty of the grain is finely brought out by the
polish.]</p>
<p>Australian trees are commonly evergreens; many of them are
also remarkable for the inverted position of their leaf; the
margin, and not either surface, being directed towards the stem.
It is worthy of remark, that the trees in Australia are rarely so
numerous as to impede horse travelling. Flowering plants of very
great beauty abound; but the lily, tulip, and honey-suckle, exist
in the form of standard trees of great size. There are also
odoriferous plants, which scent the atmosphere to a great
distance; and prickly shrubs, which grow upon sandy soils, and
bind them down, preventing the drift which is the bane of the
Arabian and African deserts. Grasses are abundant and nutritious.
The grass-tree is peculiar to the country, and portions of the
stem (the upper part) are esculent. The zamia spiralis produces a
large bulbous excrescence, which, when properly prepared, is used
as food by the natives, and somewhat resembles cassada. There is,
however, a great deficiency of indigenous vegetables and fruit
fit for human food. Even from reeds a light kind of cake is made.
The principal native fruits yet discovered are a kind of currants
(like cranberries), raspberries, a few tasteless fruits, and a
species of nut. Flax, tobacco, a species of cotton, tares,
indigo, chicory, trefoil, and burnet (the last a capital
substitute for tea), are also among the natural productions.
Mushrooms are pretty abundant. To the above account may be added
that the pitcher-plant (<i>Nepenthes distillatoria</i>), once
supposed to be peculiar to Ceylon, is found in Australia. A plant
of a very singular description has been discovered, by Mr. Preis,
growing in the sand. From the account given of it, we should be
almost tempted to imagine that it constituted a link between the
animal and the vegetable kingdoms; it swells up when touched, and
then dies away; it is red in colour, but of a shape difficult to
depict.</p>
<p>The useful productions of other lands are now, however,
extensively acclimatized, and corn crops and orchards are found
in every fertile spot in the settled districts; almost every
species of corn, including maize, is cultivated with success;
whilst, of foreign fruits, the orange, lemon, citron, nectarine,
apricot, peach, plum, cherry, fig, mulberry, quince, banana,
guava, melon, pine-apple, grape, and many others, have long been
a source of profit to the small settlers.</p>
<br>
<h4>WHALE, SEAL, AND OTHER FISHERIES.</h4>
<p>Perhaps no coast frequented by Europeans exists where whales
are found in greater numbers than upon that of Western Australia.
Three hundred of these valuable fish were seen during one voyage
of Her Majesty's ship <i>Sulphur</i> down the coast; some of
which were the black, and others the sperm whale. The former come
into soundings, within the bays, whilst the latter are seldom
seen there. They abound along the whole shore. At present, the
Americans and the French engross an immense proportion of this
lucrative fishery. From what cause can this monopoly arise? Have
the natives of France and America a keener eye to profit, or a
more enterprising spirit than our own countrymen?</p>
<blockquote>"The Greenland fishery (observes Mr. Burn *) may now
be almost said to exist no more; with its decadence, one, among
others, of our nurseries for seamen is gone. It is useless to
inquire how this national loss has accrued; the effects are at
present felt, and may hereafter be much more so, unless pains be
taken to remedy the evil, which can only be done by a fostering
care and encouragement in every maritime channel. Does Britain do
so? Does she see clearly that naval supremacy, and naval
supremacy alone, can uphold, extend, and consolidate that empire
upon which, as she justly boasts, the sun never sets? I do not
think she does; or, if she does, she by no means works her
opinion. Even if the South Sea fisheries were of no advantage to
the mother country, still it is the bounden duty of her flag to
watch over and protect the interests of her children. The cost is
nothing, weighed against the gain. Thousands of our seamen throng
the Pacific even as it is; but thousands more would be created
under a wise and paternal government."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vindication of Van Diemen's Land</i>.]</p>
<p>If the hardy seamen formerly engaged in the Greenland and
Davis' Straits' fisheries, now almost exhausted, were aware of so
rich a field for their exertions as exists on the coasts of
Australia, and especially of its western province, they would
apply their skill, experience, and industry, in that direction.
Great numbers of persons of this class must now be languishing
for want of employment in the ports of Hull, Newcastle, and
Aberdeen. The shipping and men, engaged in these fisheries, from
Hull, amounted, at one time, to nearly one half of the entire
numbers so employed by Great Britain. In the year 1829, that
single port sent thirty-three vessels of large burthen, with
about fifty men in each; whilst the total number now fitted out
by all England hardly exceeds thirty! Since, therefore, there is
such a manifest failure in the fisheries to the north and
north-west of the globe, it behoves our countrymen to fix their
attention upon the fisheries in the southern ocean, where they
can hardly fail to share the reward attendant upon skill and
enterprise, which is now monopolized by foreigners.</p>
<p>From an authentic source we have also the following statement,
dated West Australia, 1839:</p>
<blockquote>"The Americans have been gathering <i>golden
harvests</i> in these seas during the present year (1839), and
they barter the produce of their labours in the fisheries for
work done in the colony."</blockquote>
<p>These foreign whalers have, indeed, increased so much lately,
that the governor has deemed it expedient to recommend the
appointment of a consul at Perth or Freemantle, for the
protection of life and property. The Americans, if not disturbed
when at a distance from the coast, might certainly abstain from
entering, and fishing in the bays.</p>
<p>The Supplement to Sir J. Stirling's Report contains the
following observation:</p>
<blockquote>"Unfortunately for the settlement, neither its
capital, nor the amount of its population, admit at present of
its entering into extensive operations in that line, however
lucrative they appear to be."</blockquote>
<p>From another document we copy the following particulars on
this subject; it is dated the 3rd of October, 1838.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Report of the Committee appointed at a
Meeting of the Agricultural Society on the 3rd of August</i>,
1838, <i>to take into consideration the present state and
condition of the Colony of Western Australia</i>.]</p>
<blockquote>"The capture of oil entitled to British certificate
in 1837 was, in round numbers, one hundred tons, and of bone
about five tons. Over and above this quantity, there was taken in
the bays of the colony, by American vessels, or vessels from New
South Wales, about four hundred tons of oil, and the
corresponding amount of bone. In the current season the
Freemantle Company has casked fifty tons; Duffield's party,
&mdash; tons; Bull's party, seven tons; the Harvest, in
Leschenault Bay, has taken ninety tons; and the Pioneer, in
Safety Bay, thirty-five tons. The proceedings on the south coast
are not as yet known here.<br>
<br>
"The bay-fisheries, as at present carried on in this colony,
notwithstanding the undeniable abundance of fish, will be found
more profitable to the boatmen and the store-keepers than to the
absent proprietors of shares; but vessels may be employed in the
bays with great profit, provided they be fitted out and manned in
England upon the lays customary in the mother-country.<br>
<br>
"The influence which Western Australia exerts upon the whaling
business is worthy of attention. Vessels sailing from England in
November, and arriving by Christmas-time at the edge of the
southern ice, in latitude 40° south, and on the meridian of
Greenwich, may fish successfully from thence to Cape Leeuwin
during the months of January, February, March, and April; and if
they arrive in the ports of this colony about the 15th of May,
they will have a few days to tranship cargo and refresh their
crews, before it will be time to take up their stations for
bay-fishing. This commences about the 20th of May, and lasts till
October. They may then send home, by freight-ships, their
previous captures, and proceed on the sperm-fishery off Timor and
the Seychelles, reaching Table Bay about the 1st of January: from
whence, after taking in refreshments and sending home their oil,
they may proceed again on the same route of continuous employment
The seas around the Moluccas and Japan open, moreover, excellent
stations for ships fishing out of the ports of the colony; and it
cannot be doubted that, as the centre of such operations, Western
Australia will enable the whalers, on the plans above-mentioned,
to drive their competitors, whether Englishmen or Americans, out
of the market. In illustration of this, take the following
comparative statement of an American and English vessel, if the
latter be employed as above-mentioned:&mdash;The expense of
outfit for ships of equal tonnage will be the same for both, and
we will suppose the lays out of London and America to be the
same, although, as there are no deductions for casks and agency
amongst the latter, the lay is actually greater in the ratio of
33&#8531; per cent to 33½ per cent, minus the aforesaid
deductions.<br>
<br>
"But out of an eighteen months' voyage, the American is three
months coming out and three months going home; while the British
vessel, pursuing the continuous voyage alluded to, is employed
the whole eighteen months in fishing. Again, the average price of
American oil for seven years in America has been 14<i>l</i>.
16<i>s</i>. per ton, and in London 26<i>l</i>. Here, then, in
quantity (if time be the measure of success) there is a
difference of 33&#8531; per cent., and in value a difference of
60 per cent: total gross advantage 93&#8531; per cent. But from
this must be deducted freight home at 5<i>l</i>. per ton, or 20
per cent. and cost of colonial agency and of colonial expenses,
to 5 per cent., and also freight of provisions and supplies of
casks from time to time sent out, amounting to about 20 per cent.
more; leaving a clear advantage of 48&#8531; per cent. to one
mode of fishing over the other, arising out of the facilities
offered by this colony. But this particular mode admits of
employing much smaller vessels; and on the whole, without stating
this estimate as exactly accurate, such are the peculiar merits
of this place as the centre of fishing operations.<br>
<br>
"Other descriptions of fishing may be carried on in this country
with great advantage. Seals, sharks' fins, tortoiseshell, and
trepang are abundant; but the present number of colonists, and
their limited means, forbid all hope of seeing these sources of
maritime wealth in a productive state for many
years.</blockquote>
<p>Sir J. Stirling, in a subsequent statistical document brought
up to the end of June 1837, reports thus:</p>
<blockquote>"In a recent despatch, I had the honour to bring
under notice the state and prospects of the fisheries on this
coast. I am satisfied that the extension of this pursuit will be
most rapid, for if the profitable nature of bay fishing be
considered, as well as the saving of expense by employing, in the
seas adjacent to this colony, smaller vessels than those usually
fitted out from London, together with the advantage arising from
the constancy of their employment in fishing, without the
necessity of long voyages to and from their whaling grounds, it
may be fairly estimated, that the profits on capital so employed
here will be one-third higher than on vessels sailing out of
English ports. This advantage is of great importance at the
present time, when the British whaler, loaded with an outfit
exceeding by one-third that of the American ship, in consequence
of taxation within the United Kingdom, has no chance of competing
with foreigners in the markets of the Continent or China, and,
consequently, four vessels out of five, engaged at present in the
South Sea fisheries, belong to America.<br>
<br>
"The produce of the colonial fishery in the present season is
expected to attain the value of 4,200<i>l</i>., in oil, whalebone
and seal-skins. In 1847, I anticipate the export of these
articles will reach to the amount of
100,000<i>l</i>.</blockquote>
<p>To these statements the following additions, from a private
source, may be made.</p>
<blockquote>"There is a plentiful supply of white fish on the
coast, including the snapper, and many others not known in
Europe. Some of them are well flavoured, and similar to the cod,
haddock, &amp;c. Fish have been taken in large quantities off
Rottnest Island (outside Gage's Roads), in Cockburn Sound, at the
Murray River, and elsewhere. Some samples sent to foreign markets
have brought good prices; and there is no doubt that when capital
and enterprise are employed in this speculation, it will prove a
fruitful source of wealth to the colony&mdash;having such markets
near as are afforded by Java, and the other Malay isles, the
Mauritius, India, and China. As salt is found in the colony, and
especially in Rottnest Island, the means for curing are at
hand.<br>
<br>
"Soon after the <i>Sulphur's</i> arrival, at an early period of
the settlement, her crew, with that of the <i>Challenger</i>
frigate, were engaged in fishing; and, on one occasion, they
caught so vast a quantity of a species called the king fish, that
the net they were using broke, and the fish were literally driven
on shore. After filling three large boats with them, a
considerable heap was left on the beach. Upwards of three hundred
people were amply supplied on this occasion, including the civil
and military establishments then on Garden Island; and also the
crews of the above ships and the <i>Parmelia</i> transport. Close
to Garden Island (an excellent fishing station) is a bank on
which the finest whiting are caught in great quantities; they are
larger than those taken on the English coast, and equal to them
in flavour. The crew of the colonial schooner <i>Ellen</i>, once
caught on the Five Fathom Bank, outside of that island, a place
greatly frequented by the snapper, in less than two hours, and
with half-a-dozen hooks and lines, fish of that description, to
an extent exceeding five hundred weight. Some of them weighed
from twenty to forty pounds each.<br>
<br>
"In the Swan River there is a great abundance of fish of the
herring tribe, of a flatter description, and broader than those
in the English seas. Some of these, along with the snapper, were
cured, and taken to Java by Mr. Sholl, the purser of the
<i>Sulphur</i>, acting as the agent of the local government, and
were pronounced by the Malays, at Sourabaya, to be well adapted
for the Java market."</blockquote>
<p>In 1837 two American vessels fishing off this coast, carried
off about £.30,000 worth of oil and whalebone: up to May 1838,
forty American vessels, the greater part engaged in the whale
fishery, had touched on the west coast for provisions.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> aborigines are a wandering race,
without towns or villages, or fixed habitations of any kind;
their temporary occupation of any spot depending upon its
capability of affording them game, fish, or other food. They are
so thinly scattered over the surface of this continent, that
extensive tracts may be traversed without encountering a single
native. Their dispersion throughout the territory prevents them
from entering into any other communities than those which are
necessary for rendering successful their hunting and fishing
occupations. The tribes into which they are divided, usually
comprise about 120 persons of both sexes, and of all ages. The
number of the aborigines cannot be correctly ascertained: Sir
James Stirling conceives the nearest estimate of the population
to be that which assigns one native to two square miles.</p>

<p>Their character is not so degraded as has been represented.
Although the law of retaliation prevails among them, they are not
known to be cannibals, nor to scalp or torture their captives.
Sir James Stirling and others agree in considering that many
among them are very intelligent, and possess most acute
perceptions. In a description of the natives of another district
of Australia, though probably equally applicable to those of the
western portion of the continent. Major Mitchell says:</p>
<blockquote>"My experience enables me to speak in the most
favourable terms of the aborigines, whose degraded position in
the midst of the white population affords no just criterion of
their merits. The quickness of apprehension of those in the
interior was very extraordinary; for nothing, in all the
complicated adaptations we carried with us, either surprised or
puzzled them. They are never awkward; on the contrary, in manners
and general intelligence they appear superior to any class of
white rustics I have seen. Their powers of mimicry are
extraordinary; and their shrewdness appears even through the
medium of imperfect language, and rendering them in general very
agreeable companions."</blockquote>
<p>They can trace a step by sight with the accuracy of a
bloodhound by scent; and by their sagacity in finding the tracks
of animals, and the best pastures for grazing, they become useful
as herdsmen or shepherds. They climb the loftiest trees by boring
the bark with a stick hardened by fire, and inserting a toe in a
small notch, and holding on the stick, until they reach the
branches, where their prey seldom escapes them. The nets with
which they take fish are said to be as well made as our own, and
their weirs for the same purpose ingeniously contrived. Their
mode of cooking a kangaroo-steak is a proof of their skill in the
culinary art;&mdash;it is placed in a scooped-out stone, which is
readily found in the streams, and pressed down by heavy stones on
the top of it; the heat is applied beneath and round the first
top stone; at the critical moment the stones above are quickly
removed, and the steak appears in its most savoury state.</p>
<blockquote>"Certain usages established by custom are frequently
appealed to by them as rules of conduct. Of these, the principal
relate to the right of individuals to certain portions of
hunting-ground derived by inheritance from their immediate
ancestors, to the practice of boring the cartilage of the nose of
the young men on their admission to the rights of manhood, and to
the retaliation for injuries received, which all are enjoined, as
well as entitled, to seek, whether the offender belong to the
same or to a neighbouring community. It has been found very
difficult to ascertain the exact locality or tribe to which
individuals belong, in consequences of alliances which are very
frequent amongst individuals of different tribes. This species of
brotherhood, by adoption, carries with it the obligation of
becoming parties to each other's quarrels: and although it
appears to be followed by the advantage of mutual protection as
far as such individuals are concerned, it gives rise, at the same
time, to many hostilities. The intercourse between tribes is
seldom of a friendly character, but it is remarkable that their
conflicts seldom extend to the loss of lives. Almost continually
engaged, as they are, in feuds arising out of the invasion of
each other's territory, or the abduction of each other's women,
it might be expected that when they meet to fight, the weaker
party would be exterminated; whereas these contests, after a
great deal of clamour, and a few unimportant wounds, generally
end in the murder of a child, or of a female, by mutual consent,
admitted as an atonement for the offence or ground of quarrel.
Independent of these occasional warlike meetings of tribes,
almost every native is under an engagement to avenge, at a
convenient opportunity, the death of some departed friend, or an
insult previously offered to himself. This purpose, which he
cannot forego without discredit, gives rise to acts of the
greatest treachery, and not unfrequently ends in the surprise and
sudden death of some individuals belonging to the same tribe with
the avenger, or some of his neighbours. They rarely, therefore,
sleep a second night at the same place; the spear seldom quits
the hand of the man from boyhood till death; and they become
accustomed to witness, endure, and practise the greatest
outrages." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Perth Gazette.]</p>
<blockquote>"In their intercourse with the whites, they
accommodate themselves with astonishing readiness to the
language, the habits, and even the weaknesses of their new
friends. They are remarkably cheerful, and make themselves very
useful in many employments; but they are not to be relied upon;
for in a great many instances it has been found that, after
living for months in the house of a settler, they have been all
along employed by the rest of the tribe as spies, for the purpose
of conveying intelligence as to the best points of attack on life
or property. Living in a constant state of warfare, they are
bold, crafty, and persevering, and lay their plans with judgment
equal to the vigour with which they put them in execution. With
such qualities as these, they would be too powerful as a nation
for the present number of colonists, if it were not for their
mistrust of each other. They cannot combine their efforts, nor
act on a concerted plan; for if they were to do so, there are
many of them who would readily betray the rest, and voluntarily
lead the whites to their retreat, for the sake of a few pounds of
flour."</blockquote>
<p>The aborigines of Western Australia have been used as postmen
and policemen, and have performed their duties with integrity and
diligence. A race who are so soon induced to perform such duties
will speedily become useful allies to the settler. As yet,
however, they must be carefully watched, and not too much
confided in. The present Governor, who has devoted very great
attention to the improvement of the aboriginal race of Western
Australia, has lately succeeded in inducing them to labour at the
much desired operations of road-making.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** The rate of wages paid the natives is
1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per day, but they are very indifferent
workmen.]</p>
<p>In physical structure the natives of Western Australia are
rather slenderer than those farther to the south-east and in the
interior; but some of them are remarkable for the symmetry of
their proportions. Their heads are not so inferior in form and
size as many known tribes of savages, and in general the forehead
is well shaped. They do not appear to have any knowledge of a
God, though there are traces of some instinct notion of a future
state of existence. A boy accused of theft denied the charge, and
appealed to his parents, who had long been dead, in corroboration
of his declaration of innocence. In Eastern Australia the bodies
of the dead are carried repeatedly round the grave for miles, to
puzzle the dead so that he may not find his way back; they also
pretend to receive instructions from him before covering up the
grave; which acts infer a belief that the dead still live.</p>
<p>Sir James Stirling speaks of the influence exercised over them
by their reputed magicians.</p>
<blockquote>"This magician, or doctor," as described by Dr. Scott
Nind, "is called Mulgarradock, and is considered to possess the
power of driving away wind or rain, as well as bringing down
lightning or disease upon any object of their or others' hatred.
In attempting to drive away storm or rain, they stand out in the
open air, tossing their arms, shaking their clothes, and making
violent gesticulations, which they continue a long time, with
intervals, if they are not successful. Almost the same process is
used to remove disease; but in this case they are less noisy, and
make use of friction, sometimes with green twigs previously
warmed at the fire, frequently making a short puff, as if to blow
away the pain. The hand of the Mulgarradock is also supposed to
confer strength or dexterity, and the natives frequently apply to
him for that purpose. The operation consists in simply drawing
his hand repeatedly, with a firm pressure, from the shoulder
downwards to the fingers, which he afterwards extends until the
joints crack.<br>
<br>
"Their funeral solemnities are accompanied by loud lamentations.
A grave is dug about four feet long and three wide, and perhaps a
yard in depth. The earth that is removed is arranged on one side
of the grave in the form of a crescent; at the bottom is placed
some bark, and then small green boughs: and upon this the body,
ornamented and enveloped in its cloak, with the knees bent up to
the breast and the arms crossed. Over the body is heaped more
green boughs and bark, and the whole is then filled with earth.
Green boughs are placed over the earth, and upon them are
deposited the spears, knife, and hammer of the deceased, together
with the ornaments that belonged to him: his throwing-stick on
one side, and the curl or towk on the other side of the mound.
The mourners then carve circles in the bark of the trees that
grow near the grave, at the height of six or seven feet from the
ground; and lastly, making a small fire in front, they gather
small boughs, and carefully brush away any portions of the earth
that may adhere to them. The face is coloured black or white,
laid on in blotches across the forehead, round the temples, and
down the cheek-bones; and these marks of mourning are worn for a
considerable time. They also cut the end of the nose and scratch
it, for the purpose of producing tears. During the period of the
mourning, they wear no ornaments or feathers. It frequently
occurs that two individuals bear the same name; and in this case,
should one of them die, the other changes his name for a certain
period, in order that the name of the deceased should not be
uttered. When a female is interred, her implements are in like
manner deposited in her grave."</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion drawn by Dr. Scott Nind, that these ceremonies
prove their belief in a future state, is hardly conclusive; nor
is it to be inferred that they believe in ghosts, because some
men were afraid of an anatomical drawing. They believe in omens,
and consider that the cry of the night-cuckoo portends death.</p>
<p>Betrothment with them appears to take place at the will of the
parents, from the earliest age, even before birth. Polygamy is
prevalent among them, which, with their limited means of
subsistence, and the effects of exposure, tend to limit their
increase. They all evince an ear for music, and are fond of
dancing. The only attempt at a musical instrument yet seen among
them, is a kind of drum, made of kangaroo-skin stretched over a
bundle, and beaten with the fists of the women and children; they
strike in correct time, and sing simultaneously, and in a
monotonous kind of chant. To this music the men and boys dance,
singing at the same time. This dance is evidently expressive of
their gallantry and readiness to defend the weaker sex. They
retreat together in exact step, then turn and give on tip-toe a
curious agitation to the legs, which are widely distended;
suddenly they rush towards the women, raising their voices,
extending their arms, and placing themselves in a defensive
attitude.</p>
<p>Another and chief amusement is a representation of hunting the
kangaroo. It is thus well described by Captain Irwin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Their facility of imitation renders their pantomimic
dances, which they delight in, lively pictures of some of their
pursuits. In these dances, called by them corrobories, they
engage generally at night near a blazing fire. Their
representation of killing the kangaroo is peculiarly striking.
Two are selected out of the circle to represent the hunter and
the kangaroo; one assumes the attitude of the animal when
grazing, and exhibits the cautious timidity natural to it,
pausing from time to time, rising up on end, looking about, and
anxiously listening, as it were, to ascertain whether an enemy be
nigh. The hunter, approaching against the wind, with extreme
caution steals on his prey, and, after frequent change of his
position, retreating or throwing himself on the ground, the scene
at length closes with the triumph of the hunter, on his
discharging the spear which is supposed to pierce the
animal."</blockquote>
<p>Major Mitchell observes that</p>
<blockquote>"The habits and customs of the aboriginal inhabitants
are remarkably similar throughout the wide extent of Australia.
Their mode of life, as exhibited in the temporary huts made of
boughs, bark, or grass,* and their climbing of trees to procure
the opossum, by cutting notches in the bark, alternately with
each hand, prevails from shore to shore in Australia, as well as
in Van Diemen's Land."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Many uses of these rude people resemble those
of the wandering Arabs; and recal to mind that passage in
Nehemiah, c. viii. v. 15:&mdash;"Go forth unto the mount, and
fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and palm branches, and
branches of thick trees, to make <i>booths</i>, as it is
written." Thus, the natives of Australia, whenever they wander,
and wish for a temporary shelter, put two or three sticks, or
stems of the grass-tree, in the earth, and interweave them with
bark, grass, or branches of trees.]</p>
<p>They have certain modes of decorating their persons. The
children, when very young, are tatooed, principally on the chest
and shoulders; the cicatrix thus raised is a distinguishing mark
of the tribe. The septum of the nose is perforated, and
ornamented by the insertion of a feather, or the bone of a bird
or a kangaroo. These ornaments are gradually thrown aside, as
they advance in years, and, in old age, are generally
discontinued.</p>
<p>Kangaroo-skins afford their females cloaks, in which,
furnished with a bag behind, they carry their children. The men
wear girdles spun from the wool of the opossum, and a sort of
tail of the same material is appended to this girdle, both before
and behind. Sometimes the men wear kangaroo cloaks in the
winter-season, and ornament their heads with dogs' tails,
cockatoo-feathers, and any thing their fancy prompts to fasten in
their hair. The women seldom adorn themselves, and cut their hair
short; both smear themselves with a pigment they call wilga,
which is red, and mixed with grease.</p>
<p>A bandage, or fillet, is often worn round the temples, which
is whitened with pipe-clay; under which the natives wear another
of a red colour.</p>
<p>The food of the natives embraces a great variety of articles.
In the estuaries and rivers, and on the coast, there is abundance
of fish at certain periods of the year, and kangaroos of various
sorts, together with opossums, dalgerts, and other small animals,
which are obtained in considerable numbers; roots and gums of
several kinds are also used by them, and birds' eggs, lizards,
frogs, grabs, and crayfish from the swamps, are also resorted to
as varieties, or used in cases of urgent want. They do not appear
to be reduced at any time to very great difficulties in procuring
subsistence, but their habits preclude the possibility of keeping
any accumulated stock of the necessary articles, and therefore
their time and attention are almost constantly occupied in the
pursuit of their daily food.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson * gives the following account of the zest with
which a native devours the grass-tree grub. During an excursion
from Freemantle, and after passing across the Darling mountains,
in a course East half South, accompanied by Captain Bannister,
Lieut. Everard, and Mr. Talbot, they encountered a number of the
natives.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "See Narrative of a Voyage round the
World."]</p>
<blockquote>"One of them," observes the Doctor, "who appeared to
be superior to the others, both in rank and intelligence, shewed
us various roots which they used for food, and also the manner of
digging for them; and, in return for our civility, in giving him
and his fiends a little biscuit, he procured a handful of
loathsome-looking grubs from a grass-tree, and offered them to
us, after having himself ate two or three, to show os that they
were used by them as food. His polite offer being courteously
declined, he snapped them up, one by one, to evince that what we
had refused was esteemed by him as a <i>bonne
bouche</i>."</blockquote>
<p>Captain Grey, however, does not mention this habit with such a
feeling of disgust; he observes that the <i>Bar-de</i> (the
native name for the white grub alluded to), has a fragrant,
aromatic flavour; and is eaten either raw or roasted, and forms a
dessert after their repasts. The presence of these grubs in a
grass-tree is thus ascertained:&mdash;If the top of one of these
trees is observed to be dead, the natives give it a few sharp
kicks with their feet, when, if it contains any <i>bar-de</i>, it
begins to give way; if this take place, they then push it over,
and, breaking the tree to pieces with their hammers, extract the
<i>bar-de</i>.</p>
<p>Neither do the natives hesitate to use other insects as food.
Mr. Leigh relates that, upon approaching a number of ant-hills,
he observed the manner in which the natives avail themselves of
their contents, when hungry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"They take a portion of the ant-hill, and shake and
jostle it about until the ants are nearly all out in their hands:
they then convey the crawling insects, in the shape of a ball,
into their mouths, sucking and munching them with evident
satisfaction."</blockquote>
<p>Their weapons are not numerous, but such as they possess are
wielded by them with admirable dexterity. Bows and arrows are not
used by them; but they have several kinds of spears. The ordinary
spear is barbed with a species of hard wood,* strongly fixed with
the skin of the kangaroo, and further secured with gum. The point
of this spear is said to be sharp as a needle, and is hurled by
them with astonishing accuracy of aim; at a distance of fifty or
sixty yards they will transfix a small loaf of bread. It is
remarkable, however, that the wounds made by these spears are
seldom of a dangerous character when not inflicted in some vital
part of the human body. That inflammatory symptoms do not ensue
may be attributed to the temperate habits of the people. The
war-spear is serrated with sharp stones fixed in gum, and is much
heavier than those used for the chase: the spears are all hurled
with the aid of a rod, with a groove or niche at one end, and
called a <i>wammera</i>. They do not appear to use any poisoned
weapons. Their shield, or <i>hieleman</i>, is of very small
dimensions, being made out of a piece of wood about two feet
eight inches in length, and of very little thickness. It affords
them protection from missiles, by the adroitness with which it is
handled.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Called "Bimbel" by the natives.]</p>
<p>The <i>bommerang</i>, or <i>koilee</i>, is a very singular
missile. It is a thin curved stick, somewhat in the shape of a
cutlass, and about two feet four inches in length; it can be
thrown by a skilful hand, so as to rise upon the wind, with a
rotatory motion and in a crooked direction, towards any given
point with great precision, and to return, after a considerable
flight, to within a yard or two of the thrower; or, by first
striking the ground, to bound so as to hit at a given distance,
<i>en ricochet</i>, any object behind a tree. Major Mitchell
conceives that the <i>bommerang</i> originated in the utility of
such a missile for the purpose of killing ducks, 'where they are
very numerous, as on the interior rivers and lagoons, and where,
accordingly, it is found to be much more in use than on the
sea-coast, and better made, being often covered with good
carving.</p>
<p>Of their different kinds of clubs, besides those of the
ordinary form, one resembles a pick-axe; another is more peculiar
(the <i>malga</i>), and shaped at the formidable end something
like a scimetar: the <i>mago</i> is a stone-hatchet, the handle
of which is so light and elastic as greatly to aid the effect of
a blow. The knife is a stick, having sharp-edged stones fixed in
a groove therein with gum.</p>
<p>The young natives of the interior usually carry a small wooden
shovel, with one end of which they dig up different sorts of
roots, and, with the other, break into the large ant-hills for
the larvæ, which they eat.</p>
<p>Besides fishing nets, the natives make bags, or reticules, in
a very neat manner, out of a tough small rush.</p>
<p>They are in nowise a nautical people; and the sort of canoe
which, in some parts, is used to carry them across narrow creeks,
is of the most rude description. The greatest skill and taste
displayed by the Australian is in the burial mounds, which nearly
resemble the barrows of the Celts, and the head of the corpse is
laid towards the East, as originally practised by that ancient
people.</p>
<p>The following sketch of their character is from the pen of Mr.
G. F. Moore,* whose letters have served for previous
quotations:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* See <i>Perth Gazette</i>, 31st August,
1839.]</p>
<blockquote>"What a singular race of beings! Shrewd and
intelligent, yet not possessing even the first rudiments of
civilization: utterly ignorant of art or science, yet able to
obtain a ready livelihood where a civilized being might be
starved: knowing nothing of any metal, possessed of no mechanical
tool, and yet able to fashion weapons of a most formidable
description; having neither house nor home; domesticating neither
bird nor beast,&mdash;for their imperfect taming of the wild-dog
can scarcely be considered an exception; cultivating neither
grain nor fruit; naked, yet unwilling to bear the trammels of
clothing; looked down upon as the lowest in the scale of human
beings, yet proudly bearing themselves, and contemning the
drudgery of the man who despises them: confiding, cheerful,
kindly of disposition, yet treacherous, inflexible in revenge,
and glorying in massacre; enjoying the most unrestrained state of
liberty, yet in daily danger of death: living, in short, in a
state of society resolved into its very first elements; having no
worship, and little superstition&mdash;revering no
God&mdash;dreading no devil&mdash;under subjection to no
man&mdash;knowing no law, human or divine&mdash;without rule of
conduct in this life, without hope of reward or fear of
punishment in the next. Here is a people truly singular as their
own vegetable productions&mdash;unique as their
animals,&mdash;and in a condition as rare in the world as their
own swans. They are a race worthy of the study of the
philosopher, meriting the attention of the philanthropist, and
requiring the aid of the missionary."</blockquote>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> local administration of Western
Australia is provided for by the Royal Commission and
instructions to the Governor, and by Act of Parliament, and an
Order in Council, dated the 1st of November, 1830.</p>
<p>An executive council is appointed to advise and assist in the
administration of the government, two of whom, together with the
governor, constituting a quorum; and the executive councillor
whose name is first placed in the instructions shall, in the
event of the death or absence of the governor, assume the
administration of the government in the same manner as the
governor or commander-in-chief himself; but in no case can any
judge take upon himself these functions.</p>
<p>By the same authority the governor is empowered to appoint
justices of the peace, coroners, constables, and other officers
for putting the law into execution; to levy troops, to erect
ports, prescribe boundaries to districts, counties, townships,
and parishes, to appoint fairs, markets, ports, harbours, quays,
&amp;c,.</p>
<br>
<h4>LAWS.</h4>
<p>The legislative power conferred on the governor and the
members of the legislative council has been hitherto exercised
only in the adoption of certain recent acts of parliament of a
general tendency; and in the passing of a few ordinances
connected with matters of local interest. The state of the law in
this colony is therefore as yet in strict accordance with the
letter and spirit of the law of England, as far as it is
applicable to the circumstances of this country. In the absence
of every institution foreign to the practice of the
mother-country, as well as the non-existence of foreign customs,
language, and blood in this settlement, it possesses an
attraction for free emigrants in a great degree peculiar to
itself.</p>
<br>
<h4>MILITARY FORCE.</h4>
<p>The existing distribution of the military force will be
understood from the return subjoined. In this department a
considerable increase of force is requisite for the protection of
the colonists. Whatever may have been the views of the government
on the earlier formation of this settlement, the settlers
consider themselves by its declarations entitled to be protected,
and secured in the quiet enjoyment of the lands assigned to them,
or bought by their outlay. Without this they cannot fulfil the
location-duties, nor can they make any progress in the extension
of the settlement. This protection of the white population is
moreover <i>necessary to the security of the aboriginal race</i>:
if not given, a constant state of warfare and violence between
the two must follow; and while the former is hindered in his
progress towards the establishment of the country, the latter
will be rendered vindictive and cruel in proportion to the injury
he receives from, and inflicts upon, the settler. To correct or
prevent these evils, the only course which seems advisable is to
declare the present limitation of the settlement to be that
territory which is included between the 31° of latitude and the
south coast; and from the west coasts to the meridian of Doubtful
Island Bay. Within that district military stations should be
formed at the following points:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image2" id="Image2"></a><img alt=""
width="640" src="1400771h-images/Image2.jpg"><br>
<br></p>
<p>The above-mentioned military stations are proposed with
reference to the best lines of inter-communication for mutual
support, and also with reference to the several districts in
which lands have been given and locations begun.</p>
<br>
<h4>PUBLIC EMPLOYMENTS.</h4>
<p>The number of persons exclusively engaged in the civil,
judicial, clerical, and military branches of the public service,
amounts to one hundred and sixty.</p>
<p>In other public offices, independent of the government, such
as printers, innkeepers, &amp;c., there are employed about
thirty-four; the whole population being 2032, in 1837.</p>
<br>
<h4>PUBLIC OFFICES FOR CIVIL ESTABLISHMENT.</h4>
<p>The building intended for public offices at Perth will be
found to be of the greatest value to the public service, by
brining under one roof all the different departments, and by
inducing regularity in the despatch of business.</p>
<br>
<h4>CHURCH.</h4>
<p>Divine service according to the Established Church, is
attended at Perth by about two hundred persons, and in that town,
as well as in Guildford and Albany, there are Independent
Chapels. The latest accounts, however, state that a site has been
fixed upon for a Church at Perth.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is to be hoped that the appeal of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, made on the 24th of July, 1839, will
receive due attention. It was in the form of a petition from the
Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, praying the
House of Lords to take measures for increasing the amount of
spiritual instruction in the colonies in connexion with the
Established Church, <i>especially in the Australian
colonies</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h4>MISSIONARY ESTABLISHMENT.</h4>
<p>In the year 1835 an association was formed in London for
promoting religion according to the rites of the Church of
England, under the designation of the "Western Australian
Missionary Society." An Italian gentleman of the name of
Giustiniani was selected as their first minister. He arrived
there in July 1836, erected a chapel and school-house at
Guildford, and commenced the formation of a farm on the Swan
River, at which it is understood to be the intention of the
Society to collect natives, with a view to their instruction and
future civilization.</p>
<br>
<h4>SCHOOLS.</h4>
<p>A school for young gentlemen was some time since opened by the
Colonial Chaplain in Perth, the course of instruction in which
comprises the entire range of classical education which is
usually given in England. In connection with this school, and
subject also to the superintendence of the Colonial Chaplain, a
school is opened for instruction in the various branches of
elementary education. There is a school for young ladies, and
also a girls' school in Perth; besides which, tuition has been
given in several private families by either resident or visiting
governesses. In addition to this, a Sunday school is regularly
"kept and well attended there in the Church. At Guildford there
is about to be established also an elementary school, and a
Sunday school is held in the church of the Western Australian
Church Missionary Association. In the district of the Upper Swan
instruction is also given in a Sunday school held in a private
house, which is tolerably well attended.</p>
<br>
<h4>AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.</h4>
<p>This institution had its beginning in the first year of the
settlement. It comprises almost all the owners of land. Its
members are admitted by ballot. The regular meetings take place
on a fixed day in each quarter of the year, and are usually well
attended. The Society has promoted good conduct amongst farm
servants, by giving distinctions and prizes to the best-conducted
and most efficient labourers, and in other respects it has tended
in a very considerable degree to promote the usual objects of
such institutions.</p>
<br>
<h4>FISHING ASSOCIATIONS.</h4>
<p>There are at present four establishments of this description;
the first at Freemantle, consisting of 30 subscribers, at the
rate of fifty pounds each; the second, called the "Perth Fishing
Company," is divided into 60 shares, at fifteen pounds each. The
fishing-ground of these two companies is near to the entrance of
the Swan River. The two other establishments occupy stations in
Doubtful Island Bay, on the south coast. One of these is the
property of a gentleman named Cheyne; the other belongs to a Mr.
Sherratt. The latter was established last year, and found
abundance of employment. It is supposed that the aggregate
produce of the fisheries in the present season will amount to
4,200<i>l</i>. in oil, whalebone, and seal-skins.</p>
<br>
<h4>BANK.</h4>
<p>The establishment of a Bank had been long an object of desire
in this colony. The want of such an institution occasioned the
greatest inconveniences in the transfer of property, as well as
in the safe custody of balances in hand. The funds applicable to
such purposes could not, however, be obtained in the colony until
this present year. On the 1st June, 1838, however, a Joint Stock
Bank commenced business, and it last year paid a dividend of 11
per cent. According to the last report their business had
increased 100 per cent. Being supported by eighty individuals of
respectability, its credit is undoubted, and as it proposes to
limit its discounts to actual transactions in the course of
business, and to issue notes to a very small amount, it will
yield a safe and sufficient profit' to the proprietors, and
promote materially the general interest of the settlement.</p>
<p>The circulation of this Bank on the quarter's average ending
26th March, 1839, was. .. ..</p>

<p>Its ostensible capital is 10,000<i>l</i>., but its credit is
so good, that it has not been found necessary to call for more
than an eighth part of its proposed funds, in consequence of
deposits being made by its customers at its commencement to the
extent of four thousand pounds. It is also proposed to render it
available as a bank of savings, and if it succeed in this
respect, it will tend much to create habits of frugality and
temperance amongst the labouring people.</p>
<p>The discount on bills is 12½ per cent. per annum, and interest
is allowed on deposits at 5 per cent. per annum.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the Australian Banking Company in
London to establish a Branch Bank in Western Australia.</p>
<br>
<h4>EXCHANGES.</h4>
<p>Treasury Bills were negociated at a premium of 1½ per cent.,
but the demand for them will cease when the colonial exports are
equal to their imports. Private bills on England are subjected to
a discount of five per cent.</p>
<br>
<h4>TRUST AND LIFE INSURANCES.</h4>
<p>Persons desirous of investing capital in the purchase of lands
in Western Australia, may find it advantageous to know that an
association has been established in London, under the title of
"The British and Colonial Trust and Assurance Company," with a
view of combining the administration of Trusts with the business
of Life Assurance, one object of which institution is to relieve
the settlers who are possessed of property from an embarrassing
and doubtful choice.</p>
<br>
<h4>NEWSPAPER.</h4>
<p>There is published in the colony at present a weekly
newspaper, under the name of the <i>Perth Gazette</i>.</p>
<br>
<h4>PROJECTS.</h4>
<p>Preliminary surveys and plans are in course of preparation for
the accomplishment of the following objects, in which the
colonial community takes a very lively interest.</p>
<p>1. The erection of a Church at Perth, the expense of which it
is proposed to provide for principally by private
subscriptions.</p>
<p>2. The establishment of a communication between Perth and the
opposite side of the river by a series of dykes and bridges.</p>
<p>3. The formation of a small mole at Freemantle connected with
a tunnel through Arthur's Head, to be completed at the cost of
the Whaling Company, the greater part being already effected.</p>
<br>
<h4>PRISONS.</h4>
<p>The principal gaol of the colony is at present at Freemantle,
but it will probably be necessary, in the course of a short time,
to construct a more suitable edifice for that purpose, at or near
the seat of government. From the removal of the gaol
establishment to Perth, considerable saving will accrue in the
administration of justice, and the management of the prisoners
will be more immediately under the inspection of the higher
authorities.</p>
<br>
<h4>PENITENTIARY FOR NATIVES.</h4>
<p>The government has constituted in the Isle of Rottenest a sort
of penitentiary for native culprits; the water being thought,
where walls are too costly, a practical barrier to their
dexterity in escape. One recommendation of this isolated
imprisonment is the facility which it affords for the application
of some regular discipline, where the natives are removed from
their old haunts and companions. They are much addicted to theft,
and are frequently guilty of personal violence.</p>

<h4>STATE OF CRIME IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA.</h4>

<h4>IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.</h4>
<p>The relative position of Western Australia, as has been
already remarked, is peculiarly favourable for communication with
the commercial world; most of its rivers are navigable for small
vessels and boats, besides being applicable to purposes of
irrigation, and valuable as a water power for mills; many of its
harbours are easily accessible and secure, and its anchorages
good. With such advantages it must necessarily become, in course
of time, a seat of considerable maritime traffic, as well as of
vast agricultural and pastoral operations. The peculiar adaption
of this territory for commercial pursuits is already becoming
more generally and duly appreciated, for within the four months
previous to the end of April 1839, there had never been so many
vessels or means of communication with England since it was a
colony.</p>
<p>The bane of this colony hitherto; the master evil which has
hitherto withdrawn all the advantages of which it is susceptible
from the capability of its soil, its central situation and
proximity to the Malay Archipelago, Hindostan, and the Mauritius,
is the enormous price of labour, resulting from the facility with
which land was procurable by all. This lias produced a
derangement of the essential machinery of all production.* The
friends of Western Australia, however, with the aid of
Government, are now directing their strenuous endeavours to
remedy this great evil. Their objects have already been developed
in another part of this volume, when treating of the proper mode
of selling the Colonial lands, which has been applied with such
unexampled success to the province of Southern Australia. There
can be no doubt that Western Australia will exhibit a rapid
progression, and elucidate the full advantages of a wise system
of Colonial legislation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The following fact affords a homely
illustration of the total want of all domestic help in the
<i>ménage</i> of a West Australian settler. We could name the
mother of a family who had no other means of keeping her infant
out of harm's way, when her various avocations required her
absence, than that of placing it in a <i>hen-coop</i>.]</p>
<p>The following tables are compiled from the last official
returns:&mdash;<br></p>

<h3><i>Government Regulations for the Protection of Settlers in
Western Australia</i>.</h3>
<h4>COPY OF THE OLD TERMS, SWAN RIVER.</h4>
<blockquote>Although it is the intention of His Majesty's
Government to form a settlement on the Western coast of
Australia, the Government do not intend to incur any
<i>expense</i> in conveying settlers, or in supplying them with
necessaries after their arrival.<br>
<br>
Such persons, however, as may be prepared to proceed to that
country, at their own cost, before the end of the year 1829, in
parties comprehending a proportion of not less than five female
to six male settlers, will receive grants of land, in fee simple
(free of quit rent), proportioned to the capital which they may
invest upon public or private objects in the Colony to the
satisfaction of His Majesty's Government at home, certified by
the superintendent or other officer administering the Colonial
Government, at the rate of forty acres for every sum of £.3 so
invested, provided they give previous security; first, that all
supplies sent to the Colony, whether of provisions, stores, or
other articles which may be purchased by the capitalists there,
or which shall have been sent out for the use of them or their
parties, on the requisition of the Secretary of State, if not
paid for on delivery in the Colony, shall be paid for at home,
each capitalist being to be held liable in his proportion; and,
secondly, that on the event of the establishment being broken up
by the Governor or Superintendent, all persons desirous of
returning to the British islands shall be conveyed to their own
home, at the expense of the capitalists by whom they may have
been taken out. The passages of labouring persons, whether paid
for by themselves or others, and whether they be male or female,
provided the proportion of the sexes before-mentioned be
preserved, will be considered as an investment of capital,
entitling the party by whom any such payment may have been made,
to an allowance of land at the rate of £.15, that is, of two
hundred acres of land for the passage of every such labouring
person over and above any other investment of capital.<br>
<br>
Any land thus granted, which shall not have been brought into
cultivation, or otherwise improved or reclaimed from its wild
state, to the satisfaction of Government, within twenty-one years
from the date of the grant, shall, at the end of the twenty-one
years, revert absolutely to the Crown.<br>
<br>
All these conditions, with respect to <i>free</i> grants of land,
and all contracts of labouring persons and others, who shall have
bound themselves for a stipulated term of service, will be
strictly maintained.<br>
<br>
It is not intended that any convicts, or other description of
prisoners, be sent to this new settlement.<br>
<br>
The government will be administered by Captain Stirling of the
Royal Navy, as Civil Superintendent of the settlement; and a
bill, in the nature of a civil charter, will be submitted to
Parliament in the commencement of its next session.*</blockquote>

<h3><i>Regulations as to Settlers in Western Australia</i>.<br>
<br>
<span class="aa">January</span> 1829.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><i>Regulations for the guidance of those who
may propose to embark as Settlers for the New Settlement on the
Western Coast of</i> <span class="aa">New Holland</span>.</p>
<blockquote>1. His Majesty's Government do not intend to incur
any expense in conveying settlers to the new colony on the Swan
River, and will not feel bound to defray the expense of supplying
them with provisions or other necessaries after their arrival
there, nor to assist their removal to England or elsewhere,
should they be desirous of quitting the colony.<br>
<br>
2. Such persons as may arrive in that settlement before the end
of the year 1830, will receive, in the order of their arrival,
grants of land, free of quit-rent, proportioned to the capital
which they may be prepared to invest in the improvement of the
land, and of which capital they may be able to produce
satisfactory proofs to the Lieutenant-governor (or other officer
administering the colonial government), or to any two officers of
the local government appointed by the Lieutenant-governor for
that purpose, at the rate of 40 acres for every sum of £.3 which
they may be prepared to invest.<br>
<br>
3. Under the head of "investment of capital" will be considered
stock of every description, all implements of husbandry, and
other articles which may be applicable to the purposes of
productive industry, or which may be necessary for the
establishment of the settler on the land where he is to be
located. The amount of any half-pay or pension which the
applicant may receive from Government will also be considered as
so much capital.<br>
<br>
4. Those who may incur the expense of taking out labouring
persons, will be entitled to an allowance of land, at the rate of
£.15; that is, of 200 acres of land, for the passage of every
such labouring person, over and above any other investment of
capital. In the class of "labouring persons" are included women,
and children above ten years old. Provision will be made by law,
at the earliest opportunity, for rendering those capitalists who
may be engaged in taking out labouring persons to this settlement
liable for the future maintenance of those persons, should they,
from infirmity or any other cause, become unable to maintain
themselves there.<br>
<br>
5. The licence of occupation of land will be granted to the
settler, on satisfactory proof being exhibited to the
Lieutenant-governor (or other officer administering the local
government) of the amount of property brought into the colony.
The proofs required of such property will be such satisfactory
vouchers of expenses as would be received in auditing public
accounts. But the full title to the land will not be granted in
fee-simple until the settler has proved, to the satisfaction of
the Lieutenant-governor (or other officer administering the local
government), that the sum required by Article 2 of these
Regulations (viz. 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per acre) has been
expended in the cultivation of the land, or in solid
improvements, such as buildings, roads, or other works of the
kind.<br>
<br>
6. Any grant of land thus allotted, of which a fair proportion,
of at least one-fourth, shall not have been brought into
cultivation, otherwise improved, or reclaimed from its wild
state, to the extent of 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per acre, to the
satisfaction of the local government, within three years from the
date of the licence of occupation, shall, at the end of the three
years, be liable to a payment of 6<i>d</i>. per acre into the
public chest of the settlement; and at the expiration of seven
years more, should the land still remain in an uncultivated or
unimproved state, it will revert absolutely to the Crown.<br>
<br>
7. After the year 1830, land will be disposed of to those
settlers who may resort to the colony on such conditions as His
Majesty's Government shall see occasion to adopt.<br>
<br>
8. It is not intended that any convicts, or other description of
prisoners, be transported to this new settlement.<br>
<br>
9. The government will be administered by Captain Stirling, of
the Royal Navy, as Lieutenant-governor of the settlement; and it
is proposed that a bill should be submitted to Parliament in the
course of the next session, to make provision for the civil
government of the new settlement.*</blockquote>

expended in some investment of the nature specified in Article 3,
or in the cultivation of the land, or in solid improvements, such
as buildings, roads, or oilier works of that kind.<br>

6. Any land thus allotted, of which a fair proportion, at least
one-fourth, shall not have been brought into cultivation, or
otherwise improved, to the satisfaction of the local government,
within three years from the date of the licence of occupation,
shall, at the end of the three years, be liable to one further
payment o£ 6<i>d</i>. per acre for all the land not so cultivated
or improved, into the public chest of the settlement; and, at the
expiration of seven years more, so much of the whole grant as
shall still remain in an uncultivated or unimproved state, will
revert absolutely to the Crown. And in every grant will be
contained a condition, that, at any time within ten years from
the date thereof, the government may resume, without
compensation, any land not then actually cultivated or improved,
as before mentioned, which may be required for roads, canals, or
quays, or for the site of public buildings.<br>
<br>
7. After the year 1830, land will be disposed of to those
settlers who may resort to the Colony, on such conditions as His
Majesty's government shall determine.<br>
<br>

<blockquote>1. It has at no time formed any part of the plan of
His Majesty's Government to incur any expense in conveying
settlers to the new colony on the Swan River. Government will not
feel bound to defray the cost of supplying provisions or other
necessaries to settlers after their arrival there, nor to assist
their return to England, nor their removal to any other place,
should they be desirous of quitting that colony.<br>
<br>
2. Such persons as emigrate to the Swan River Settlement, and
arrive there after the 31st of December, 1830, will receive, in
the order of their arrival, allotments of land proportioned to
the capital which they have at command for the improvement of the
land, at the rate of 20 acres for every sum of £.3 which they may
be prepared to invest in such improvements.<br>
<br>
3. Under the head of "capital" will be considered, at a fair rate
of valuation, stock of every description, all implements of
husbandry, and other articles which may be applicable to the
purposes of productive industry, or which may be necessary for
the establishment of the settler on the land where he is to be
located.<br>
<br>
4. Those who incur the expense of taking out labouring persons to
this colony will be entitled to land to the value of £.15; that
is, to 100 acres, for the passage of every such labourer, over
and above any investment of other capital.<br>
<br>
In the class of "labouring persons" are included women, and also
children above twelve years old. They will further be allowed 30
acres for every child under the age of six, and 60 acres for
every child between the age of six and twelve.<br>
<br>
5. The licence to occupy will be given to the settler, on
satisfactory proof being exhibited to the Lieutenant-governor (or
other officer administering the local government), of the amount
of property, as above specified, which has been brought into the
colony to be invested. The proofs expected to be produced of the
value of this property will be such vouchers of expenses as would
be received in auditing public accounts. The title to the land in
fee-simple will not be granted, however, until the settler has
proved, to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-governor (or other
officer administering the local government) that the sum required
by Article 2 (viz. 3<i>s</i>. per acre) has been actually
expended in some investment of the nature specified in Article 3,
or has been laid out on the cultivation of the land, or on some
other substantial improvement, such as buildings, roads, or other
works of utility.<br>
<br>
6. Any land thus allotted, which shall not have been brought into
cultivation, or upon which improvements shall not have been
effected in some other manner, to the satisfaction of the local
government, within two years from the date of the licence of
occupation, shall, at the end of that period, be liable to an
annual payment into the public chest of the settlement of
1<i>s</i>. per acre as quit-rent; and at the expiration of
another period of two yearly so much of the whole grant as shall
still remain in an uncultivated state, or without such
improvement being effected upon it as shall be satisfactory to
the local government, shall revert absolutely to the Crown, or
become liable to such additional quit-rent as the local
government may think fit to impose, reference being had to the
value of the adjoining lands. But in cases where land so
circumstanced is required for roads, canals, or quays, or for any
other public purpose, the local government will be at liberty to
retain the land absolutely, in place of allowing it to revert to
the original grantee, on the condition of paying an additional
quit-rent.*</blockquote>

<i>Journal of a Voyage from Cockburn Sound, Swan River, to Port
Leschenault, the Vasse, and King George's Sounds in H. M.
Colonial Schooner "Champion," Lieutenant Belches, R.N.,
Commander, in the months of August, September, and October, 1838,
by</i> <span class="aa">W. N. Clark</span>.</h3>
<blockquote>"On Saturday the 18th of August arrived at Port
Leschenault, where we found the American Whaler <i>Pioneer</i> at
anchor in the Bay. Lieutenant Bull, R.N., the Government
Resident; came on board, and brought the <i>Champion</i> into a
safer berth, nearer shore, as the weather was threatening. Here
we were wind hound for six days, and had thus an opportunity of
trying the capabilities of the anchorage amidst very stormy
weather, and of visiting the three establishments on the main
land belonging to Mr. John Scott, the Governor's tenant, Mr.
Bull, and Mr. Little, who is connected with the Indian
establishment In describing the anchorage, I give the opinions of
Mr. Belches and the commander of the Pioneer, whose nautical
abilities cannot be questioned. The Bay of Leschenault, called in
the native language 'Koombaana,' is very easy of access; the best
mark for ships approaching from sea, is Mount 'Williams,' seen at
a great distance, and bearing north-east of the bay. The probable
distance from the bay may be about forty miles. The anchorage is
situated in latitude 33° 15' and 115° 32' east longitude; it is
perfectly secured from the north-west and W.N.W. gales by a long
reef of rocks, which breaks the force of the sea, and makes the
water inside of the reef comparatively smooth. Towards the
north-west it is secured from these gales by the main land,
intended for the town-site of 'Bunbury,' which forms a sort of
peninsula towards the sea, and connects itself with the reef
before alluded to by 'Point Casuarina.' When it is considered
that our most violent winds are those from the north-west, west,
and south-west, it must appear to the most common observer that
Koombaana Bay, is a port of infinite value to this part of the
Settlement, and calculated to rise into importance, especially in
India. It is only exposed towards the north, but the winds from
that quarter are neither heavy, nor are they of any duration, so
no apprehension need exist on that score. The depth of water in
the bay varies from three to four fathoms, with a bottom composed
of hard clay and mud, which forms good holding ground. In fact,
to establish the safety of the place beyond a doubt. Captain
Adams states, that when he returns to this coast, he will anchor
the Pioneer during the winter at Leschenault, taking the
precaution to lay down a 15 cwt. anchor. The inlet of Leschenault
(which has an estuary of larger extent than Melville Water) is
encompassed by land of the richest quality, and the same
observation applies to that on the bank of the 'Preston,' a river
which empties itself into the estuary. We visited the farms of
his Excellency the Governor, of which Mr. John Scott is tenant,
and were highly delighted with the appearance of the country,
richness of the soil, and luxuriance of the grass. Scott has nine
acres of wheat in cultivation, and five acres of barley and oats,
all which looked remarkably well. The stock-yard for cattle,
which he has nearly finished, is decidedly the most substantial
and farmer-like in the Colony. The greater part of this farm of
5000 acres, is composed of rich soil, capable of raising any
crops. Mr. Bull has a small plot of ground, of 15 acres,
immediately above Scott; but that gentleman's attention is
chiefly directed to the whale fishery, from which he expects to
reap a rich harvest next year. On entering his house we found the
table covered with surveying instruments, maps, &amp;c., on which
a gentleman remarked, with a smile, 'Now, if any of Bull's
friends had called, he would have turned away, shaking his head
and saying, I have made a mistake, this cannot be Bull's house!'
Mr. Ommaney, from the Survey office, it appeared, had taken up
his residence there. Mr. Little's establishment is on the right
bank of the Preston, immediately opposite Mr. Bull's. The whole
of the country around seemed to be of a very superior quality,
and if the description of the people on the spot can be credited,
it extends in one unvaried mass for twenty miles from the
sea-coast backwards into the interior, connecting itself with the
Vasse district towards the south, and that of the Murray towards
the north. Leschenault is situated at the distance of
seventy-five nautical miles from Rottnest, ninety-eight miles
from Perth, by land, and 180 miles from King George's Sound. The
Williams' river is only forty miles distant; in all probability
the same fine country connects the two Settlements. The interior
of Leschenault is peculiarly adapted for the rearing of horses
and cattle, while the sea-coast and hills afford a great extent
of sheep runs. Swine thrive amazingly on the native roots, sow
thistles, &amp;c.; we saw five in the bush at Scott's farm with
which he takes no trouble, but turns them adrift along with the
other stock; and Captain Adams declared that he had not seen
fatter pigs in America. I certainly never saw their equals in any
part of this Colony. While at anchor in the bay, a whale came in,
and the crew of the-Pioneer gave chase in three boats. The whale
was soon struck in the immediate view of both ships, and its
bellowing gave note that the harpoon had done its duty. After
towing one boat to sea with amazing velocity, and just when a
second lance had been thrown, one of the crew, alarmed at the
vicinity of the large animal, and the noise, jumped overboard,
when it became imperative to cut the rope, in order to save the
man's life, leaving the whale to escape with a quantity of gear.
Much disappointment was excited on board, and some even said that
they might have left the coward to shift for himself, and secured
the whale, especially as two other boats were behind.<br>
<br>
"On Friday, the 24th, as the squth-west gale still continued
blowing in heavy squalls, Mr. Belches and I went on shore to
examine the site of the intended town of 'Bunbury;' we first
walked along the sea-shore and saw a remarkable natural
curiosity, a formation of pure basaltic rocks, resembling (though
in miniature) the Giants' Causeway in Ireland. The columns in the
chasms, formed by the power of the waves, were in some places six
feet in height, and beautifully shaped; we then turned aside, and
entered on the town site, and were surprised to find, within a
stone's throw of the beach, a level plain of twenty or
twenty-five acres, composed of vegetable mould of the richest
quality, without a single stump or shrub to impede the progress
of the plough. This is to be divided into allotments of half an
acre each. To the right was a wooded hill and dell (part of the
town site), containing excellent soil, and abounding in
picturesque views of the bay and of the river. In fact it is a
remarkable feature in this district, that step on shore from the
boat when you will, or where you will, one is sure to find good
land and fine grass, which at this season looked most luxuriant
If the Anglo-Indian settle at Leschenault, which offers every
inducement, 'Bunbury,' from its natural resources and position,
will be a town of very considerable importance.<br>
<br>
"On Saturday the 25th, we left Port Leschenault, and beat out of
the Bay, the wind being still unfavourable. The Pioneer remained
at anchor. The Settlement of the Vasse is twenty-nine miles from
Leschenault, and we arrived there at two o'clock <span class=
"uu">P. M.</span> on the same day. The position of the place is
ascertained by a tub placed on the top of a pole, opposite the
residence of the Messrs. Bussell, which is about two miles
inland. The Vasse Inlet, inhabited by the families of Messrs.
Layman and Chapman, is situated six miles nearer Leschenault Some
grumbling took place, because, in landing the goods for all the
settlers, a preference was given to the <i>tub</i>, instead of
the <i>Inlet</i>, and parties had to convey their goods seven
miles by land, having no boats fit for the purpose of coasting.
There was a great deal of trouble in landing the goods for this
part of the Settlement, the anchorage in the winter months being
dangerous, owing to an exposure to the north-west winds, which
sweep the whole of Géographe Bay. The Vasse district is a most
splendid cattle run, and the feed appears to be the same, if not
better, than that at Port Leschenault Mr. Layman informed me,
that two of his heifers produced six pounds of butter weekly
each. At the Vasse Inlet, Mr. Layman has twenty-two head of
cattle, and five acres of wheat in crop: Mr. Chapman, twenty-five
head of cattle: the Messrs. Bussells, seven miles further towards
'Cape Naturaliste,' have thirty-five head of cattle, nine horses,
one hundred and twenty goats, and ten acres of wheat and rye in
cultivation; a man of the name of Dawson has three cows and three
acres of wheat. The crops in this district are very luxuriant;
garden vegetables of all kinds thrive in great abundance. On the
28th left the Vasse, and tried to weather Cape Naturaliste; but
the wind being adverse, we could not succeed, and brought up in
Castle Bay, a very safe anchorage, on the north-east side of the
Cape. The water here was as smooth as that of the anchorage at
Garden Island, as this bay is protected from the N.W. and S.W.
There is deep water close to the shore. The Pioneer joined us in
the bay, for the purpose of taking in wood and water, and
remaining till the end of the whaling season.<br>
<br>
"On the 31st of August, arrived at King George's Sounds and
anchored in the outer harbour, not being able to fetch the port
in Princess Royal Harbour, owing to an adverse gale of wind.
Whilst the sailors were dropping the anchor, a whale was observed
close to the ship.</blockquote>
<h4>KING GEORGE'S SOUND.</h4>
<blockquote>"The Settlement in Western Australia under this
designation is 320 miles from the head quarters at Swan River, by
sea, and is situated in 35° 2' south latitude, and 118° east
longitude. The town site is very beautifully placed in a gorge
between two hills&mdash;'Mount Clarence' on the right hand from
the Harbour, and 'Mount Melville' on the left. The scenery, on
entering both the Sound and Princess Royal Harbour, is of a bold
and grand description, far surpassing that at Swan River. The
town of 'Albany' extends along the base of these hills, forming a
sort of semicircle to the Harbour; and, with its white dwellings
and neat gardens, is a very pretty object The land in the town
site is composed of black peat soil, plentifully watered by
streams which rush down from the hills in all directions, and
flow into Princess Royal Harbour. One of them is strong enough to
turn a mill on a large scale. This land is not confined to the
valleys merely, but is found at the top of the rising grounds
around the town. Strawberry-hill, the residence of Sir Richard
Spencer, is situated about a mile and three quarters from the
town. A well-made road, with hard footing, conducts the traveller
through the paths, affording charming views of the rugged and
peaked 'Parrongurup' hills far in the interior, until the farm
(as it is called) suddenly emerges into view, and, with its
smiling luxuriance, puts one in mind of England: it is really a
sweet place. Sir Richard had five acres of wheat in cultivation,
which looked remarkably well, between thirty and forty head of
cattle, and several horses; he has also a flock of sheep on a
farm on the Hay River, about thirty miles in the interior, of
which his second son has charge. Several flocks of these useful
animals are stationed in the interior by various parties, and are
thriving well. Mr. Belches' flock, and Mr. Macdonald's, both
under the charge of the latter, have a range of excellent pasture
ground, well watered, situated about twenty-nine miles from the
Settlement.<br>
<br>
"I was told that the sheep country commences generally at this
distance, and between that and Albany, there are numerous blocks
of good arable land, where farms, varying from 100 to 500 acres,
might be easily located. In particular, my attention was called
to a rich valley between 'Wilson's Inlet' and the harbour, and my
informant Mr. Sherratt, stated, that if a canal were cut, it
would open up a district of country unrivalled for good soil.
Timber, adapted for every purpose, which might be easily floated
down to the harbour, by means of the canal, exists in abundance,
and it was described as exceeding the teak wood of India for ship
building. The rich valley, of great extent, discovered by Dr.
Wilson, is situated somewhere near the inlet, and the farmed
district of Kujenup is not far distant; this is described as the
finest in the colony. With regard to the whaling, it appears to
have been successful: the <i>Samuel Wright, Gratitude</i>, and
<i>Delphos</i>, three American whalers, have been stationed in
the Bays near the Sound, for some time; the crew of the former
had caught and hied down twenty-three whales, and this vessel may
be immediately expected at the Swan. A French whaler, the
<i>Harmonie</i>, has also been successful. A French frigate of 36
guns had visited the Settlement, expecting to find it abandoned
by the English, and uninhabited; such is the ignorance of our
position in Europe. The harbours of King George's Sound are so
well known that it is needless to describe them&mdash;suffice it
to say, that the <i>Champion</i> rode out a tremendous gale of
wind in Princess Royal Harbour, during our stay, with the most
perfect safety. Nature has done every thing to make this harbour
the finest in the world, and the art of man, in seconding her
efforts by producing exports, will do the rest The Settlers at
the Sound are most kind and hospitable, and it is to be hoped
that their well-founded expectation of success will ere long be
realized. It is not generally known that there are three harbours
to the southward of King George's Sound equally safe, and in
which ships have remained during the whole of the winter
months:&mdash;viz. 'Two People Bay,' 'Cape Riche,' and 'Doubtful
Island Bay.'<br>
<br>
"On Sunday the 9th September, we left Princess Royal Harbour, and
proceeded to sea, but encountering, a severe, gale of wind, were
obliged to put back and anchor under Bald Head, eight miles from
Albany.<br>
<br>
"On the 13th again went to sea, with a fair wind, saw three
whales near that dangerous breaker, called 'Maude's Reef'; we
observed the water break repeatedly over it, and Mr. Belches,
took the bearings.<br>
<br>
"On the 14th a gale of wind from the W.N.W. checked our progress,
and drove us 200 miles from land. Such was the extreme violence
of the gale, and the turbulence of the sea, that it was deemed
advisable to heave-to, which accordingly was done, and for two
days and nights the <i>Champion</i> rode out one of the most
terrific gales of wind, accompanied with thunder and lightning,
that ever swept the Southern Ocean: one continued blast of wind
that raised the angry sea, which dashed its raging waters over
the deck, the white foam reaching half mast high; the sails were
insufficient, and many of them split; at one time our sole
dependence was on the main sail, and if it had given way, which
was every moment expedited, disastrous consequences might have
ensued; one sea stunned the chief mate for a minute&mdash;he was
struck on the head. This terrible storm proved the
<i>Champion</i> to be an excellent sea boat, but with her present
rigging she is not fitted to make the voyage between King
George's Sound and Swan River in the winter season, when the west
and north-west winds invariably blow with exceeding violence.
Finding it impossible to proceed, we bore up for the Sound, and
on the 18th again arrived in harbour, and anchored under Point
Possession, four miles from the settlement It was supposed that
during the continuance of the storm we had drifted towards the
south-east, but it afterwards appeared, that while the wind
seemed to be driving the ship one way, a very strong current
(although at the time imperceptible to us) was impelling her in
another direction.<br>
<br>
"On the 25th. the westerly gales having ceased, we left the Sound
after a farther stay of seven days. During this period accounts
arrived of the complete success of the Foreign Whaling vessels on
this coast It is calculated that they have got between 600 and
700 tuns of oil, besides the whalebone, thus taking away from our
shores a large amount of produce, which ought to be acquired by
British vessels, if any spirited English merchants would make the
attempt. If this fishery pays the Americans and French, it must
surely be productive of great advantages to our own nation to
pursue the same traffic. At Swan River, Cockburn Sound, Safety
Bay, and Port Leschenault, have been proved to be excellent
harbours during the most stormy months, and thus we have a range
of coast from the original Settlement to the east boundary of the
Colony, admirably adapted for the whale fishery and sealing, and
possessing seven harbours, exclusive of Castle Bay and Port
Augusta, into which vessels may run in stormy weather, and remain
at anchor with the greatest safety.<br>
<br>
"On the 26th we were again obliged to run for the anchorage Bald
Head, owing to adverse winds.<br>
<br>
"On the 27th, the wind having changed in our favour, we began to
beat the vessel out to sea, and in the passage between Break Sea
Island and Bald Head, unexpectedly experienced very great danger.
The <i>Champion</i> was on the tack from Break-Sea, in order to
weather Bald Head, when, all at once, the captain sung out, "Put
the helm up;" the command was instantly obeyed, and we saw the
white froth of a large breaker on our lee, within only 150 yards
of the ship. The danger was then avoided, and it was evident it
was the same breaker described by Flinders or Vancouver, but
which has <i>never been seen since the foundation of the
Colony</i>, although the officers of some of the ships of war
endeavoured to find out the spot, and attributed the existence of
such a rock to a mistake. The day on which Mr. Belches discovered
it was remarkable for an exceeding high swell of the ocean, with
a very light wind, and it may not be observed to break again for
a long time. If the <i>Champion</i> had not been providentially
rescued from this danger, she must have struck the rock, as she
was directly on it, and all lives on board would have perished;
it is right in the passage into the Sound, between Bald Head and
Break-Sea Island, from sea, and many ships must have passed close
to it without observation. The wind again fell to a calm, and we
were obliged to return to our old quarters.<br>
<br>
"On the 28th, again made sail, and beat out of the Sound, without
noticing this breaker, although a strict look-out was kept. The
<i>Samuel Wright</i>, American Whaler, was observed going into
harbour with a fair wind.<br>
<br>
"On the 29th and 30th, hard gales from the north-west, and
hove-to during a great part of the time.<br>
<br>
"Monday, 1st October, fine weather again.<br>
<br>
"Tuesday, the 2nd, at seven <span class="uu">A. M.</span> spoke
the <i>Lewis</i>, of Rochester, an American Whaler cruising on
the coast; we told the Captain that the <i>Samuel Wright</i> was
at the Sound, and he bent his course thither. At 10 <span class=
"uu">A. M.</span> a furious gale sprung up from our old quarter,
the north-west, and the vessel was again hove-to for
three-days.<br>
<br>
"On the 3rd, several very heavy seas broke over her; one of them
nearly pitched Mr. Belches overboard, whilst he was taking a
sight of the sun.<br>
<br>
"On the 5th, the gale having moderated and veered round to the
westward, again made sail, and steering for Cape Lewins, distant
about 150 miles, by observations (we had drifted towards the
southward considerably).<br>
<br>
"6th and 7th, again hove-to, during a very severe gale of
wind.<br>
<br>
"8th and 9th, working for the Vasse, and arrived there on the
evening of the 10th. During our first start from the Sound, on
the 9th of September, the weather was either most stormy and
adverse, or else a dead calm took place, which was sure to be the
precursor of a north-wester.<br>
<br>
"On the 13th arrived in Gage's Roads, after an adverse and
dangerous voyage of nearly five weeks from the Sound.<br>

<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Colonial
Secretary's Office, Perth, September</i> 24, 1839.</div>
<br>
The recent disasters which have occurred to the shipping on the
coasts of this Colony being attributable, in a great measure, to
the dangerous practice of anchoring and discharging vessels in
Gage's Roads <i>during the winter months</i>, and especially at
the period of the <i>equinoctial gales</i>, notwithstanding the
caution of the late Governor, Sir James Stirling, to the
contrary, which has been posted up at Lloyd's, and is annexed to
a chart of the anchorage published by Arrowsmith in the year
1833, His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to direct the
Harbour Master and Pilots of the port of Freemantle to refuse to
bring vessels to anchor in Gage's Roads, from the 1st of May to
the 1st of October, and to require them always to proceed either
to Owen's Anchorage, or over to Garden Island, both of which
positions have been proved to be perfectly secure at all times of
the year.<br>

<blockquote>"Upwards of ten years have now elapsed since Western
Australia was taken possession of as a Dependency of the British
Crown, when a Settlement was formed upon the Banks of the Swan,
and in the immediate vicinity of that river. Perth and other
small towns, were founded, and, subsequently, some inconsiderable
Settlements have been formed at King George's Sound, and other
points. The laws of Great Britain are fully established, and the
social condition of the Colony is superior to that of many of the
new Settlements; still it cannot be denied that Western
Australia, as a Colony, has not, since its establishment, made
any rapid or material advance. This result is principally to be
attributed to ejroifs committed in the disposal of land&mdash;the
want of combination in the investment of British capital
there&mdash;and the superior facilities hitherto afforded to
emigration by Government to other points of Australia.<br>
<br>
"The Colony of Western Australia&mdash;possessing a fertile soil
and a salubrious climate&mdash;evidently affords greater
facilities for commerce than the other Australian Colonies, from
its greater proximity to Great Britain, the Mauritius, and the
Cape of Good Hope, and from being within easier reach of the
densely-peopled and productive countries of Asia and the rich
Indian Archipelago; yet, notwithstanding these manifest and
acknowledged advantages. Western Australia has almost remained
stationary, whilst the comparatively recent Colony of South
Australia has risen into a degree of importance, and attained a
state of prosperity not less astonishing than advantageous to
those who embarked in the formation of that settlement. Its
principal town, Adelaide, already possesses streets, squares,
churches, markets, banks, 700 or 800 stone or brick houses, with
6000 inhabitants, although less than four years ago its site was
a desert, distant 600 miles from any habitation of civilized man.
This greater progress of the younger Colony, with less natural
advantages, proves the superiority of the method of colonization
pursued with respect to it, over that which had been adopted in
Western Australia.<br>
<br>
"A new era for the latter colony has, however, now happily
commenced. Her Majesty's Government have determined to apply to
the older Colony the principles of colonization, which have had
such eminent success in South Australia; and the Western
Australian Company has been formed to co-operate in those views,
by the investment of capital in the-acquirement of land, and the
conveyance of settlers and emigrants to the most favourable point
which could be selected upon the Western coast of the continent
of New Holland, within the boundaries and under the jurisdiction
of the Colony of Western Australia.<br>
<br>
"With these objects in view, the Company have purchased extensive
blocks of land near Leschenault, in the maritime County of
Wellington, in which district some few settlers have already
established themselves. One of these tracts, containing more than
100,000 acres, is beautifully situated on the inlet formed by the
embouchure of four rivers, which pass through this property, or
form its boundary, at the mouth of which inlet there is one of
the best ports on the Western coast of New Holland. Here the
chief town of the new Settlement, to be called <span class=
"uu">Australind</span>, will be established. The selection of
this spot has been the result of careful investigation.<br>
<br>
"It may be mentioned that one fact has weighed principally with
the Company in making a choice of this field of Emigration;
namely, its great distance from the Convict Settlements, and the
consequently superior social condition which already exists in
Western Australia, where the strongest repugnance to the convict
system has prevailed since the first establishment of the Colony,
notwithstanding the urgent want of labour from which it has
suffered.<br>
<br>
"A body of Colonists are preparing to emigrate and settle at
<span class="uu">Australind</span> and on the adjoining
territory, under the auspices of the Company, and in charge of
their Chief Commissioner, who, together with his family,
accompanied by an efficient Surveying establishment, and a
skilful Medical Officer, will be despatched thither as soon as
possible.<br>
<br>
"To those intending to become Settlers, and to other persons
disposed to acquire property in Western Australia, the Company
will sell a certain portion of their territory situated in the
immediate vicinity of the port lying on the north bank of the
navigable River Collie, with the River Brunswick flowing through
its whole length, having Roe's Range on the east, and the inlet
with the outer harbour on the west The Sales will be made in
Lots, consisting each of one hundred acres of rural land, and one
acre (in four sections of a quarter of an acre each), in the town
of <span class="uu">Australind</span>, the site of which will
contain one thousand acres, exclusive of reserves for public
objects, such as quays, streets, squares, churches, and public
gardens, in or adjoining the town.<br>
<br>
"The Company will also offer separate Lots, of one quarter of an
acre each, in the proposed town.<br>
<br>
"The terms on which these sales will be made will hereafter be
published. At present it is sufficient to observe, that of the
money to be paid by purchasers of rural land and town allotments,
one moiety, or fifty pounds percent., only will be reserved to
meet the expenses of the Company: the other moiety will be laid
out by the Company for the exclusive benefit of the purchasers,
in improving the value of the land by defraying the cost of
emigration to the Settlement, and the construction of public
works therein.<br>
<br>
"Suggestions have been made to the Company for the establishment
at their principal town, of schools of a superior order, for the
youth of both sexes, which might furnish the means of giving a
sound education to the children, not only of settlers in me
Australian Colonies, but also of the Officers of the Civil and
Military service of Her Majesty, and the Honourable East India
Company, in India, Ceylon, and the Mauritius, who, it is
believed, will gladly avail themselves of such an eminent
advantage.<br>
<br>
"The Company, impressed with a conviction of the benefits which
would result from such educational establishments, will be
disposed to afford every assistance in the futherance of their
formation and maintenance.<br>
<br>
"These are the general objects of the Company, to which the
attention of the public is now invited.<br>
<br>
"Attendance will be given daily at the Office of the Company, for
the purpose of furnishing the fullest information on every point
connected with their proposed plans, in reply to personal or
written applications."</blockquote>

<h3><i>Observations on the Leschenault District, and more
particularly on the Lands there purchased by the Company, by</i>
<span class="aa">Captain Sir J. Stirling, R.N</span>., <i>late
Governor of Western Australia</i>.</h3>
<h4>CLIMATE.</h4>
<blockquote>"The temperature of the district is agreeable to the
senses, and favourable to all the operations of settlers; it is
free from extremes of heat and cold; rain falls more or less in
every month of the year, and the permanency of several of the
streams affords sufficient proof of abundant moisture. The
south-western portion of New Holland (in which Leschenault is
situated) appears to be, in fact, the only part of that Island
which is free from the occasional recurrence of desolating
droughts. The letters of Mr. Eliot, and of others, speak of the
high condition of the stock, and of the abundance of grass, at
the driest period of last summer, which proved to be in Australia
generally a season of unexampled scarcity.</blockquote>
<h4>SOIL.</h4>
<blockquote>"The land purchased by the Company extends over an
excellent range of country; I have passed through it from North
to South, near its western boundary, and from South to North, at
the base of the hills; and I have traversed it obliquely from the
mouth of the Brunswick to the Harvey, where the latter issues
from the mountain range. In the course of our excursions, I saw
upon the Brunswick a great deal of land of the richest
description; I saw also, excellent and valuable land upon the
Harvey and on the shore of the estuary; also upon the plain which
extends from the Collie to the Harvey, there is a vast range of
arable and useful land. The valleys within the hills, and not
unfrequently the hills themselves, are covered with rich grasses,
and abound in good positions for farms. No part of Australia is
so uninterruptedly good; and although in so wide an extent as the
Company's range, some inferior patches exist no doubt, I am not
aware of any district in which so great a proportion of useful
land can be found. It is every where abundantly watered; a chain
of lakes beautiful in appearance, and convenient for settlement,
extend northwardly from the head of boat navigation on the
Brunswick; there are many pools of water on the plain, and the
hilly portion of the territory is also well supplied with water.
There is lime-stone on the western side, and granite for building
near the hills; timber is abundant, and brick earth plentiful in
every part.</blockquote>
<h4>SPONTANEOUS PRODUCTS OF VALUE.</h4>
<blockquote>"Amongst the natural productions of the district may
be instanced ship-timber, Acacia bark, and flax of extraordinary
length. These, hereafter, may be produced in considerable
quantities for exportation. I am not aware whether any of the
gums are of value in commerce, but there are several varieties in
great abundance. Fish and game are very plentiful, and also
nutritious grasses of various sorts. Very good hay may be made on
the meadow lands without previous cultivation.</blockquote>
<h4>ANCHORAGES.</h4>
<blockquote>"The nature of the anchorage off the mouth of
Leschenault inlet may be seen from the surveys, and its safety
for ordinary-sized merchant ships, may be inferred from the fact,
that an American whaling ship remained at anchor in it throughout
the winter of 1838; the Captain's account of the anchorage will
be found in the Perth Gazette of July 14, 1838. Another whaling
vessel, the <i>Elizabeth</i>, remained also at that anchorage
during the whole of last winter. These instances lead to the
conclusion that, with due precaution, vessels may resort to that
place at any season of the year. The mouth of the inlet has not
more than three or four feet water on its bar; but I am disposed
to believe that if any extensive trade were to grow up, the
entrance might be deepened to sixteen or eighteen feet; within
the bar there is space and depth of water for a considerable
number of ships. Even at present, cargoes may be landed with
facility, there being no surf on the bar.</blockquote>
<h4>PRESENT CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT.</h4>
<blockquote>"Farms have been laid out at the entrance of the
inlet, and at the head of the Navigation on the Preston and the
Collie. The inhabitants do not at present exceed a hundred; there
is a considerable number of sheep, &amp;c.; wheat grows well; and
potatoes may be grown at all times of the year in suitable
situations. The first occupants of that district express
themselves greatly pleased with it; and I do not doubt that the
individuals who may acquire an early choice of allotments upon
the lands purchased by the Company will rejoice greatly in the
acquisitions they may make."</blockquote>

<h3>TERMS OF LAND SALES.</h3>
<blockquote>"The Company hereby submits to sale 51,000 acres,
(part of the territory which they have already acquired in the
vicinity of Leschenault Inlet, on the coast of Western Australia)
in lots, consisting each of 100 acres of rural land, with one
acre (in four sections of a quarter of an acre each) in the
intended town of Australind, the site of which will contain 1,000
acres, exclusive of reserves for public objects, such as quays,
streets, squares, churches, markets, and public gardens, in or
adjoining the town.<br>
<br>
"These 500 lots will be offered for sale at 101<i>l</i>. per lot,
or 20<i>s</i>. per acre.<br>
<br>
"A deposit of 10<i>l</i>. per cent. must be paid to the Company's
bankers, on application for the required land orders on the
amount of the purchase-money for the same, and the residue
thereof paid, on a day of which public notice will be given; and
in case of default being made, in payment of the residue, within
two weeks after the day appointed for the same, the deposit shall
be forfeited to the Company, together with all title to choice of
land, in respect of such deposit.<br>
<br>
"On payment of the residue of the purchase-money, each purchaser
shall be entitled to receive for each 101<i>l</i>. so paid, a
land order, authorising and requiring the officers of the Company
in the Settlement to deliver to him or to his agent, an allotment
of 100 rural acres, and one acre (in four sections) in the town
of Australind, to be severally selected according to priority of
choice, to be determined by lot, subject to the provisions
hereinafter mentioned.<br>
<br>
"These land orders will be transferable at the will of the
holders, on giving written notice thereof to the Secretary of the
Company in England, or to the Chief Commissioner of the Company
in the Settlement.<br>
<br>
"The lots for priority of choice will be drawn at the Company's
Office, in London, in the presence of the Directors, and of such
of the purchasers, or their agents, as may attend, on a day of
which public notice will be given.<br>
<br>
"The choice of the allotments, of which priority shall have been
so determined by lot in England, will take place in the
Settlement as soon after the arrival of the first body of
Colonists as the requisite surveys and plans shall have been
completed, and will be made under such regulations as the Chief
Commissioner of the Company, in the Settlement, authorised in
that behalf, shall prescribe. Neglect or refusal to comply with
such regulations in regard to any section, shall occasion a
forfeiture of the right of choice by the purchaser, and vest it
in the Company's Officer on behalf of the purchaser.<br>
<br>
"Of the money, to be paid by purchasers to the Company, 50 per
cent. will be reserved to meet the expense of the Company; the
other moiety will be laid out by the Company for the benefit of
the purchasers, in giving value to the land, by defraying the
cost of Emigration to the Settlement, and in public improvements
therein. Thus, in addition to the change of system adopted by
Government as to the public lands of the Colony generally, one
half of the purchase-money of these private lands will be
employed in adding to the value of the property, by conveying
population to the Settlement. Considering the shorter distance of
Australind from England, and the greater facility of reaching the
freight markets of India and China, Emigrant ships may be hired
at so much less for this voyage than for that to New South Wales,
or New Zealand, that 50 per cent. on the purchase-money will be
as efficient for emigration as a higher rate in the other cases.
The difference was unavoidable on account of the original price
of the Company's territory.<br>
<br>
"Purchasers of land orders, intending to emigrate with the first
body of Colonists, will be entitled to claim from the Company,
out of the fund set apart for Emigration, an expenditure for
their own passage and that of their families and servants, equal
to fifty per cent. of their purchase-money, according to
Regulations framed by the Company. But unless the claim be made
in London, by written application to the Secretary, delivered at
the office of the Company on or before a day of which public
notice will be given, it will be considered as waived. In the
selection of emigrants of the labouring class, the Company will
give a preference to applicants who shall be under engagement to
work for capitalists intending to emigrate, and to persons
purchasing land of the Company.<br>
<br>
"Except for cabin passages, the whole of the fund set apart for
emigration will be laid out by the Company in providing a Free
Passage for young married persons of the labouring class, and, as
far as possible, in equal proportions of the sexes.<br>
<br>
"The remaining five hundred acres in the town of Australind are
offered in sections of a quarter of an acre each, at the price of
10<i>l</i>. per section. Deposits, in respect of which, of
10<i>l</i> per cent. on the whole amount of the proposed purchase
money must be paid on application, and the residue of the same
afterwards, in manner before mentioned with respect to the larger
allotment, and to be subject likewise to the foregoing
stipulations and provisions. The holders of the land orders for
these quarter-acre sections, will draw for priority of choice in
common with other purchasers, in manner to be arranged by the
Directors. One-half of the fund received for quarter-acre
sections, at the rate of 10<i>l</i>. each, or 10,000<i>l</i>.,
will be strictly laid out by the Company, on objects of public
utility and convenience in the town of Australind.<br>
<br>
"Written applications for land orders will be received and
registered by the Secretary of the Company, until a day, of which
public notice will be given, when the orders will be awarded,
strictly according to priority in the register of applications,
and all deposits received will be returned, in case, by reason of
the above rule of priority, or from any other cause, the
directors shall be unable to award the required land orders to
the whole of the applicants.<br>
<br>
"Maps of the Colony, forms of land orders, and other information,
will be furnished, on application to the Secretary, at the
Office, 6, Adelphi Terrace.</blockquote>

<br>
"9. Persons not strictly entitled to be conveyed out by the

<br>
"10. All Emigrants, adults as well as children, must have been

<br>
"11. Emigrants will generally be embarked at the Port of London,
but the Directors will occasionally appoint other Ports of
embarkation, as circumstances may require.<br>
<br>
"12. The expense of reaching the port of embarkation must be
borne by the Emigrants; but on the day appointed for their
embarkation, they will be received, even though the departure of
the ship should be delayed, and will be put to no further
expense.<br>
<br>
"13. Every adult Emigrant is allowed to take half a ton weight,
or twenty cubic feet of baggage. Extra baggage is liable to
charge, at the ordinary rate of freight per ton.<br>
<br>
"14. The Emigrants must procure the necessary tools of their own
trades; and before they will be permitted to embark, they must
provide themselves with an outfit of clothing, bedding, and other
necessaries for the voyage. According to the annexed scale. The
outfit may be obtained upon payment to the Company, or to the
outfitter, of the prices affixed to the several articles in the
list.<br>
<br>
"15. On the arrival of the Emigrants at the Settlement, after
appearing before such Board or Officer as may be appointed by the
Governor of Western Australia, they will be received by an
Officer of the Company, who will supply their immediate wants,
assist them in reaching the place of their destination, be ready
to advise with them in case of difficulty, and at all times to
give them employment in the service of the Company, if from any
cause they, should be unable to obtain it elsewhere. The
Emigrants will, however, be at perfect liberty to engage
themselves to any one willing to employ them, and will make their
own bargain for wages.</blockquote>
