    </p>
    <p>
      This book is an attempt to tell, and in some measure to
      interpret, the story of what in the future may be
      considered a distinct era in American history: the eleven
      years between the end of the war with Germany (November 11,
      1918) and the stock-market panic which culminated on
      November 13, 1929, hastening and dramatizing the
      destruction of what had been known as Coolidge (and Hoover)
      Prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously the writing of a history so soon after the event
      has involved breaking much new ground. Professor Preston
      William Slosson, in <i>The Great Crusade and After,</i> has
      carried his story almost to the end of this period, but the
      scheme of his book is quite different from that of mine;
      and although many other books have dealt with one aspect of
      the period or another, I have been somewhat surprised to
      find how many of the events of those years have never
      before been chronicled in full. For example, the story of
      the Harding scandals (in so far as it is now known) has
      never been written before except in fragments, and although
      the Big Bull Market has been analyzed and discussed a
      thousand times, it has never been fully presented in
      narrative form as the extraordinary economic and social
      phenomenon which it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further research will undoubtedly disclose errors and
      deficiencies in the book, and the passage of time will
      reveal the shortsightedness of many of my judgments and
      interpretations. A contemporary history is bound to be
      anything but definitive. Yet half the enjoyment of writing
      it has lain in the effort to reduce to some sort of logical
      and coherent order a mass of material untouched by any
      previous historian; and I have wondered whether some
      readers might not be interested and perhaps amused to find
      events and circumstances which they remember well--which
      seem to have happened only yesterday--woven into a pattern
      which at least masquerades as history. One advantage the
      book will have over most histories: hardly anyone old
      enough to read it can fail to remember the entire period
      with which it deals.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for my emphasis upon the changing state of the public
      mind and upon the sometimes trivial happenings with which
      it was preoccupied, this has been deliberate. It has seemed
      to me that one who writes at such close range, while
      recollection is still fresh, has a special opportunity to
      record the fads and fashions and follies of the time, the
      things which millions of people thought about and talked
      about and became excited about and which at once touched
      their daily lives: and that he may prudently leave to
      subsequent historians certain events and policies,
      particularly in the field of foreign affairs, the effect of
      which upon the life of the ordinary citizen was less
      immediate and may not be fully measurable for a long time.
      (I am indebted to Mr. Mark Sullivan for what he has done in
      the successive volumes of <i>Our Own Times</i> to develop
      this method of writing contemporary history.) Naturally I
      have attempted to bring together the innumerable threads of
      the story so as to reveal the fundamental trends in our
      national life and national thought during the
      nineteen-twenties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an effort to eliminate footnotes and at the same time to
      express my numerous obligations. I have added an appendix
      listing my principal sources.

      PRELUDE: MAY, 1919
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      If time were suddenly to turn back to the earliest days of
      the Postwar Decade, and you were to look about you, what
      would seem strange to you? since 1919 the circumstances of
      American life have been transformed--yes, but exactly how?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us refresh our memories by following a moderately
      well-to-do young couple of Cleveland or Boston or Seattle
      or Baltimore--it hardly matters which--through the routine
      of an ordinary day in May, 1919. (I select that particular
      date, six months after the Armistice of 1918, because by
      then the United States had largely succeeded in turning
      from the ways of war to those of peace, yet the profound
      alterations wrought by the Post-war Decade had hardly begun
      to take place.) There is no better way of suggesting what
      the passage of a few years has done to change you and me
      and the environment in which we live.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      From the appearance of Mr. Smith as he comes to the
      breakfast table on this May morning in 1919, you would
      hardly know that you are not in the nineteen-thirties
      (though you might, perhaps, be struck by the narrowness of
      his trousers). The movement of men's fashions is glacial.
      It is different, however, with Mrs. Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      She comes to breakfast in a suit, the skirt of
      which--rather tight at the ankles--hangs just six inches
      from the ground. She has read in <i>Vogue</i> the alarming
      news that skirts may become even shorter, and that "not
      since the days of the Bourbons has the woman of fashion
      been visible so far above the ankle"; but six inches is
      still the orthodox clearance. She wears low shoes now, for
      spring has come; but all last winter she protected her
      ankles either with spats or with high laced
      "walking-boots," or with high patent-leather shoes with
      contrasting buckskin tops. Her stockings are black (or tan,
      perhaps, if she wears tan shoes); the idea of flesh-colored
      stockings would appall her. A few minutes ago Mrs. Smith
      was surrounding herself with an "envelope chemise" and a
      petticoat; and from the thick ruffles on her undergarments
      it was apparent that she was not disposed to make herself
      more boyish in form than ample nature intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Smith may use powder, but she probably draws the line
      at paint. Although the use of cosmetics is no longer, in
      1919, considered <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a scarlet
      career, and sophisticated young girls have already begun to
      apply them with some bravado, most well-brought-up women
      still frown upon rouge. The beauty-parlor industry is in
      its infancy; there are a dozen hair dressing parlors for
      every beauty parlor, and Mrs. Smith has never heard of such
      dark arts as that of face-lifting. When she puts on her hat
      to go shopping she will add a veil pinned neatly together
      behind her head. In the shops she will perhaps buy a
      bathing-suit for use in the summer; it will consist of an
      outer tunic of silk or cretonne over a tight knitted
      undergarment--worn, of course, with long stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair is long, and the idea of a woman ever frequenting
      a barber shop would never occur to her. If you have
      forgotten what the general public thought of short hair in
      those days, listen to the remark of the manager of the Palm
      Garden in New York when reporters asked him, one night in
      November, 1918, how he happened to rent his hall for a
      pro-Bolshevist meeting which had led to a riot. Explaining
      that a well-dressed woman had come in a fine automobile to
      make arrangements for the use of the auditorium, he added,
      "Had we noticed then, as we do now, that she had short
      hair, we would have refused to rent the hall." In Mrs.
      Smith's mind, as in that of the manager of the Palm Garden,
      short-haired women, like long-haired men, are associated
      with radicalism, if not with free love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast to which Mr. and Mrs. Smith sit down may have
      been arranged with a view to the provision of a sufficient
      number of calories--they need only to go to Childs' to
      learn about calories--but in all probability neither of
      them has ever heard of a vitamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Smith eats, he opens the morning paper. It is almost
      certainly not a tabloid, no matter how rudimentary Mr.
      Smith's journalistic tastes may be: for although Mr. Hearst
      has already experimented with small-sized picture papers,
      the first conspicuously successful tabloid is yet to be
      born. Not until June 26, 1919, will the New York <i>Daily
      News</i> reach the newsstands, beginning a career that will
      bring its daily circulation in one year to nearly a quarter
      of a million, in five years to over four-fifths of a
      million, and in ten years to the amazing total of over one
      million three hundred thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strung across the front page of Mr. Smith's paper are
      headlines telling of the progress of the American Navy
      seaplane, the NC-4, on its flight across the Atlantic
      <i>via</i> the Azores. That flight is the most sensational
      news story of May, 1919. (Alcock and Brown have not yet
      crossed the ocean in a single hop; they will do it a few
      weeks hence, eight long years ahead of Lindbergh.) But
      there is other news, too: of the Peace Conference at Paris,
      where the Treaty is now in its later stages of preparation;
      of the successful oversubscription of the Victory Loan
      ("Sure, we'll finish the job!" the campaign posters have
      been shouting); of the arrival of another transport with
      soldiers from overseas; of the threat of a new strike; of a
      speech by Mayor Ole Hanson of Seattle denouncing that
      scourge of the times, the I. W. W.; of the prospects for
      the passage of the Suffrage Amendment, which it is
      predicted will enable women to take "a finer place in the
      national life"; and of Henry Ford's libel suit against the
      Chicago <i>Tribune</i>--in the course of which he will call
      Benedict Arnold a writer, and in reply to the question,
      "Have there been any revolutions in this country?" will
      answer, "Yes, in 1812."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Smith attends closely to the sporting news, he may
      find obscure mention of a young pitcher and outfielder for
      the Boston Red Sox named Ruth. But he will hardly find the
      Babe's name in the headlines. (In April, 1919, Ruth made
      one home run; in May, two; but the season was much further
      advanced before sporting writers began to notice that he
      was running up a new record for swatting--twenty-nine home
      runs for the year; the season had closed before the New
      York Yankees, seeing gold in the hills, bought him for
      $125,000; and the summer of 1920 had arrived before a man
      died of excitement when he saw Ruth smash a ball into the
      bleachers, and it became clear that the mob had found a new
      idol. In 1919, the veteran Ty Cobb, not Ruth, led the
      American League in batting.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The sporting pages inform Mr. Smith that Rickard has
      selected Toledo as the scene of a forthcoming encounter
      between the heavyweight champion, Jess Willard, and another
      future idol of the mob, Jack Dempsey. (They met, you may
      recall, on the Fourth of July, 1919, and sober citizens
      were horrified to read that 19,650 people were so depraved
      as to sit in a broiling sun to watch Dempsey knock out the
      six-foot-six-inch champion in the third round. How would
      the sober citizens have felt if they had known that eight
      years later a Dempsey-Tunney fight would bring in more than
      five times as much money in gate receipts as this battle of
      Toledo?) In the sporting pages there may be news of Bobby
      Jones, the seventeen-year-old Southern golf champion, or of
      William T. Tilden, Jr., who is winning tennis tournaments
      here and there, but neither of them is yet a national
      champion. And even if Jones were to win this year he would
      hardly become a great popular hero; for although golf is
      gaining every day in popularity, it has not yet become an
      inevitable part of the weekly ritual of the American
      business man. Mr. Smith very likely still scoffs at "grown
      men who spend their time knocking a little white ball along
      the ground"; it is quite certain that he has never heard of
      plus fours; and if he should happen to play golf he had
      better not show his knickerbockers in the city streets, or
      small boys will shout to him, "Hey, get some men's pants!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I say that by May, 1919, the war was a thing of the
      past? There are still reminders of it in Mr. Smith's paper.
      Not only the news from the Peace Conference, not only the
      item about Sergeant Alvin York being on his way home; there
      is still that ugliest reminder of all, the daily casualty
      list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Smith discuss a burning subject, the High Cost
      of Living. Mr. Smith is hoping for an increase in salary,
      but meanwhile the family income seems to be dwindling as
      prices rise. Everything is going up--food, rent, clothing,
      and taxes. These are the days when people remark that even
      the man without a dollar is fifty cents better off than he
      once was, and that if we coined seven-cent pieces for
      street-car fares, in another year we should have to
      discontinue them and begin to coin fourteen-cent pieces.
      Mrs. Smith, confronted with an appeal from Mr. Smith for
      economy, reminds him that milk has jumped since 1914 from
      nine to fifteen cents a quart, sirloin steak from
      twenty-seven to forty-two cents a pound, butter from
      thirty-two to sixty-one cents a pound, and fresh eggs from
      thirty-four to sixty-two cents a dozen. No wonder people on
      fixed salaries are suffering, and colleges are beginning to
      talk of applying the money-raising methods learned during
      the Liberty Loan campaigns to the increasing of college
      endowments. Rents are almost worse than food prices, for
      that matter; since the Armistice there has been an
      increasing shortage of houses and apartments, and the
      profiteering landlord has become an object of popular hate
      along with the profiteering middleman. Mr. Smith tells his
      wife that "these profiteers are about as bad as the I. W.
      W.'s." He could make no stronger statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, Mr. Smith gets into his automobile to drive
      to the office. The car is as likely to be a Lexington, a
      Maxwell, a Briscoe, or a Templar as to be a Dodge, Buick,
      Chevrolet, Cadillac, or Hudson, and it surely will not be a
      Chrysler; Mr. Chrysler has just been elected first
      vice-president of the General Motors Corporation. Whatever
      the make of the car, it stands higher than the cars of the
      nineteen-thirties; the passengers look down upon their
      surroundings from an imposing altitude. The chances are
      nine to one that Mr. Smith's automobile is open (only 10.3
      per cent of the cars manufactured in 1919 were closed). The
      vogue of the sedan is just beginning. Closed cars are still
      associated in the public mind with wealth; the hated
      profiteer of the newspaper cartoon rides in a limousine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Smith's car is one of the high, hideous, but
      efficient model T Fords of the day, let us watch him for a
      minute. He climbs in by the right-hand door (for there is
      no left-hand door by the front seat), reaches over to the
      wheel, and sets the spark and throttle levers in a position
      like that of the hands of a clock at ten minutes to three.
      Then, unless he has paid extra for a self-starter, he gets
      out to crank. Seizing the crank in his right hand carefully
      (for a friend of his once broke his arm cranking), he slips
      his left forefinger through a loop of wire that controls
      the choke. He pulls the loop of wire, he revolves the crank
      mightily, and as the engine at last roars, he leaps to the
      trembling running-board, leans in, and moves the spark and
      throttle to twenty-five minutes of two. Perhaps he reaches
      the throttle before the engine falters into silence, but if
      it is a cold morning perhaps he does not. In that case,
      back to the crank again and the loop of wire. Mr. Smith
      wishes Mrs. Smith would come out and sit in the driver's
      seat and pull that spark lever down before the engine has
      time to die.
    </p>

      Finally he is at the wheel with the engine roaring as it
      should. He releases the emergency hand-brake, shoves his
      left foot against the low-speed pedal, and as the car
      sweeps loudly out into the street, he releases his left
      foot, lets the car into high gear, and is off. Now his only
      care is for that long hill down the street; yesterday he
      burned his brake on it, and this morning he must remember
      to brake with the reverse pedal, or the low-speed pedal, or
      both, or all three in alternation. (Jam your foot down on
      any of the three pedals and you slow the car.)

      Mr. Smith is on the open road--a good deal more open than
      it will be a decade hence. On his way to work he passes
      hardly a third as many cars as he will pass in 1929; there
      are less than seven million passenger cars registered in
      the United States in 1919, as against over twenty-three
      million cars only ten years later. He is unlikely to find
      many concrete roads in his vicinity, and the lack of them
      is reflected in the speed regulations. A few states like
      California and New York permit a rate of thirty miles an
      hour in 1919, but the average limit is twenty (as against
      thirty-five or forty in 1931). The Illinois rate of 1919 is
      characteristic of the day; it limits the driver to fifteen
      miles in residential parts of cities, ten miles in built-up
      sections, and six miles on curves. The idea of making a
      hundred-mile trip in two and a half hours--as will
      constantly be done in the nineteen-thirties by drivers who
      consider themselves conservative--would seem to Mr. Smith
      perilous, and with the roads of 1919 to drive on he would
      be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of his day at the office, Mr. Smith discusses
      business conditions. It appears that things are looking up.
      There was a period of uncertainty and falling stock prices
      after the Armistice, as huge government contracts were
      canceled and plants which had been running overtime on war
      work began to throw off men by the thousand, but since then
      conditions have been better. Everybody is talking about the
      bright prospects for international trade and American
      shipping. The shipyards are running full tilt. There are
      too many strikes going on, to be sure; it seems as if the
      demands of labor for higher and higher wages would never be
      satisfied, although Mr. Smith admits that in a way you
      can't blame the men, with prices still mounting week by
      week. But there is so much business activity that the men
      being turned out of army camps to look for jobs are being
      absorbed better than Mr. Smith ever thought they would be.
      It was back in the winter and early spring that there was
      so much talk about the ex-servicemen walking the streets
      without work; it was then that <i>Life</i> ran a cartoon
      which represented Uncle Sam saying to a soldier, "Nothing
      is too good for you, my boy! What would you like?" and the
      soldier answering, "A job." Now the boys seem to be sifting
      slowly but surely into the ranks of the employed, and the
      only clouds on the business horizon are strikes and
      Bolshevism and the dangerous wave of speculation in the
      stock market.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bull Market Taxes Nerves of Brokers," cry the headlines in
      the financial pages, and they speak of "Long Hours for
      Clerks." Is there a familiar ring to those phrases? Does it
      seem natural to you, remembering as you do the Big Bull
      Market of 1928 and 1929, that the decision to keep the
      Stock Exchange closed over the 31st of May, 1919, should
      elicit such newspaper comments as this: "The highly
      specialized machine which handles the purchase and sales of
      stocks and bonds in the New York market is fairly well
      exhausted and needs a rest"? Then listen; in May, 1919, it
      was a long series of <i>million-and-a-half-share</i> days
      which was causing financiers to worry and the Federal
      Reserve Board to consider issuing a warning against
      speculation. During that year a new record of six
      two-million-share days was set up, and on only 145 days did
      the trading amount to over a million shares. What would Mr.
      Smith and his associates think if they were to be told that
      within eleven years there would occur a
      sixteen-million-share day; and that they would see the time
      when three-million-share days would be referred to as
      "virtual stagnation" or as "listless trading by
      professionals only, with the general public refusing to
      become interested"? The price of a seat on the New York
      Stock Exchange in 1919 ranged between $60,000 and a new
      high record of $110,000; it would be hard for Mr. Smith to
      believe that before the end of the decade seats on the
      Exchange would fetch a half million.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days of May, 1919, the record of daily Stock
      Exchange transactions occupied hardly a newspaper column.
      The Curb Market record referred to trading on a real
      curb--to that extraordinary outdoor market in Broad Street,
      New York, where boys with telephone receivers clamped to
      their heads hung out of windows high above the street and
      grimaced and wigwagged through the din to traders clustered
      on the pavement below. And if there was anything Mrs. Smith
      was certain not to have on her mind as she went shopping,
      it was the price of stocks. Yet the "unprecedented bull
      market" of 1919 brought fat profits to those who
      participated in it. Between February 15th and May 14th,
      Baldwin Locomotive rose from 72 to 93, General Motors from
      130 to 191, United States Steel from 90 to 104
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and International Mercantile
      Marine common (to which traders were attracted on account
      of the apparently boundless possibilities of shipping) from
      23 to 47 <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Smith goes out to luncheon, he has to proceed to
      his club in a roundabout way, for a regiment of soldiers
      just returned from Europe is on parade and the central
      thoroughfares of the city are blocked with crowds. It is a
      great season for parades, this spring of 1919. As the
      transports from Brest swing up New York Harbor, the men
      packed solid on the decks are greeted by Major Hylan's
      Committee of Welcome, represented sometimes by the Mayor's
      spruce young secretary, Grover Whalen, who in later years
      is to reduce welcoming to a science and raise it to an art.
      New York City has built in honor of the homecoming troops a
      huge plaster arch in Fifth Avenue at Madison Square, toward
      the design of which forty artists are said to have
      contributed. ("But the result," comments the New York
      <i>Tribune,</i> sadly, "suggests four hundred rather than
      forty. It holds everything that was ever on an arch
      anywhere, the lay mind suspects, not forgetting the horses
      on top of a certain justly celebrated Brandenburg Gate.")
      Farther up the Avenue, before the Public Library, there is
      a shrine of pylons and palms called the Court of the Heroic
      Dead, of whose decorative effect the <i>Tribune</i> says,
      curtly, "Add perils of death." A few blocks to the north an
      arch of jewels is suspended above the Avenue "like a net of
      precious stones, between two white pillars surmounted by
      stars"; on this arch colored searchlights play at night
      with superb effect. The Avenue is hung with flags from end
      to end; and as the Twenty-seventh Division parades under
      the arches the air is white with confetti and ticker tape,
      and the sidewalks are jammed with cheering crowds. Nor is
      New York alone in its enthusiasm for the returning
      soldiers; every other city has its victory parade, with the
      city elders on the reviewing stand and flags waving and the
      bayonets of the troops glistening in the spring sunlight
      and the bands playing "The Long, Long Trail." Not yet
      disillusioned, the nation welcomes its heroes--and the
      heroes only wish the fuss were all over and they could get
      into civilian clothes and sleep late in the mornings and do
      what they please, and try to forget.

    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Smith have been invited to a tea dance at one
      of the local hotels, and Mr. Smith hurries from his office
      to the scene of revelry. If the hotel is up to the latest
      wrinkles, it has a jazz-band instead of the traditional
      orchestra for dancing, but not yet does a saxophone player
      stand out in the foreground and contort from his instrument
      that piercing music, "endlessly sorrowful yet endlessly
      unsentimental, with no past, no memory, no future, no
      hope," which William Bolitho called the <i>Zeitgeist</i> of
      the Post-war Age. The jazz-band plays "I'm Always Chasing
      Rainbows," the tune which Harry Carroll wrote in wartime
      after Harrison Fisher persuaded him that Chopin's "Fantasie
      Impromptu" had the makings of a good ragtime tune. It
      plays, too, "Smiles" and "Dardanella" and "Hindustan" and
      "Japanese Sandman" and "I Love You Sunday," and that other
      song which is to give the Post-war Decade one of its most
      persistent and wearisome slang phrases, "I'll Say She
      Does." There are a good many military uniforms among the
      fox-trotting dancers. There is one French officer in blue;
      the days are not past when a foreign uniform adds the zest
      of war-time romance to any party. In the more dimly lighted
      palm-room there may be a juvenile petting party or two
      going on, but of this Mr. and Mrs. Smith are doubtless
      oblivious. F. Scott Fitzgerald has yet to confront a
      horrified republic with the Problem of the Younger
      Generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few dances, Mr. Smith wanders out to the bar (if
      this is not a dry state). He finds there a group of men
      downing Bronxes and Scotch highballs, and discussing with
      dismay the approach of prohibition. On the 1st of July the
      so-called Wartime Prohibition Law is to take effect
      (designed as a war measure, but not signed by the President
      until after the Armistice), and already the ratification of
      the Eighteenth Amendment has made it certain that
      prohibition is to be permanent. Even now, distilling and
      brewing are forbidden. Liquor is therefore expensive, as
      the frequenters of midnight cabarets are learning to their
      cost. Yet here is the bar, still quite legally doing
      business. Of course there is not a woman within eyeshot of
      it; drinking by women is unusual in 1919, and drinking at a
      bar is an exclusively masculine prerogative. Although Mr.
      and Mrs. Smith's hosts may perhaps serve cocktails before
      dinner this evening, Mr. and Mrs. Smith have never heard of
      cocktail parties as a substitute for tea parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Smith stands with his foot on the brass rail, he
      listens to the comments on the coming of prohibition. There
      is some indignant talk about it, but even here the
      indignation is by no means unanimous. One man, as he tosses
      off his Bronx, says that he'll miss his liquor for a time,
      he supposes, but he thinks "his boys will be better off for
      living in a world where there is no alcohol"; and two or
      three others agree with him. Prohibition has an
      overwhelming majority behind it throughout the United
      States; the Spartan fervor of war-time has not yet cooled.
      Nor is there anything ironical in the expressed assumption
      of these men that when the Eighteenth Amendment goes into
      effect, alcohol will be banished from the land. They look
      forward vaguely to an endless era of actual drought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dinner party to which Mr. and Mrs. Smith go that
      evening, some of the younger women may be bold enough to
      smoke, but they probably puff their cigarettes
      self-consciously, even defiantly. (The national consumption
      of cigarettes in 1919, excluding the very large sizes, is
      less than half of what it will be by 1930.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the company may possibly go to the movies to
      see Charlie Chaplin in "Shoulder Arms" or Douglas Fairbanks
      in "The Knickerbocker Buckaroo" or Mary Pickford in "Daddy
      Long Legs," or Theda Bara, or Pearl White, or Griffith's
      much touted and much wept-at "Broken Blossoms." Or they may
      play auction bridge (not contract, of course). Mah Jong,
      which a few years hence will be almost obligatory, is still
      over the horizon. They may discuss such best sellers of the
      day as <i>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,</i>
      Tarkington's <i>The Magnificent Ambersons.</i> Conrad's
      <i>Arrow of Gold,</i> Brand Whitlock's <i>Belgium,</i> and
      Wells's <i>The Undying Fire.</i> (The <i>Outline of
      History</i> is still unwritten.) They may go to the
      theater: the New York successes of May, 1919, include
      "Friendly Enemies," "Three Faces East," and "The Better
      Ole," which have been running ever since war-time and are
      still going strong, and also "Listen, Lester," Gillette in
      "Dear Brutus," Frances Starr in "Tiger! Tiger!" and--to
      satisfy a growing taste for bedroom farce--such tidbits as
      "Up in Mabel's Room." The Theater Guild is about to launch
      its first drama, Ervine's "John Ferguson." The members of
      the senior class at Princeton have just voted "Lightnin'"
      their favorite play (after "Macbeth" and "Hamlet," for
      which they cast the votes expected of educated men), and
      their favorite actresses, in order of preference, are Norma
      Talmadge, Elsie Ferguson, Marguerite Clark, Constance
      Talmadge, and Madge Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing the Smiths certainly will not do this evening.
      They will not listen to the radio.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there is no such thing as radio broadcasting. Here and
      there a mechanically inclined boy has a wireless set, with
      which, if he knows the Morse code, he may listen to
      messages from ships at sea and from land stations equipped
      with sending apparatus. The radiophone has been so far
      developed that men flying in an airplane over Manhattan
      have talked with other men in an office-building below. But
      the broadcasting of speeches and music--well, it was tried
      years ago by DeForest, and "nothing came of it." Not until
      the spring of 1920 will Frank Conrad of the Westinghouse
      Company of East Pittsburgh, who has been sending out
      phonograph music and baseball scores from the barn which he
      has rigged up as a spare-time research station, find that
      so many amateur wireless operators are listening to them
      that a Pittsburgh newspaper has had the bright idea of
      advertising radio equipment "which may be used by those who
      listen to Dr. Conrad's programs." And not until this
      advertisement appears will the Westinghouse officials
      decide to open the first broadcasting station in history in
      order to stimulate the sale of their supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more word about Mr. and Mrs. Smith and we may dismiss
      them for the night. Not only have they never heard of radio
      broadcasting; they have never heard of Coué, the Dayton
      Trial, cross-word puzzles, bathing-beauty contests, John J.
      Raskob, racketeers, Teapot Dome, Coral Gables, the
      <i>American Mercury,</i> Sacco and Vanzetti, companionate
      marriage, brokers' loan statistics, Michael Arlen, the Wall
      Street explosion, confession magazines, the Hall-Mills
      case, radio stock, speakeasies, Al Capone, automatic
      traffic lights, or Charles A. Lindbergh.

      The Post-war Decade lies before them.

      Early on the morning of November 11, 1918, President
      Woodrow Wilson wrote in pencil, on an ordinary sheet of
      White House stationery, a message to the American people:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My Fellow Countrymen: The armistice was signed this
      morning. Everything for which America fought has been
      accomplished. It will now be our fortunate duty to assist
      by example, by sober, friendly counsel, and by material aid
      in the establishment of just democracy throughout the
      world.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Never was a document more Wilsonian. In those three
      sentences spoke the Puritan schoolmaster, cool in a time of
      great emotions, calmly setting the lesson for the day: the
      moral idealist, intent on a peace of reconciliation rather
      than a peace of hate; and the dogmatic prophet of
      democracy, who could not dream that the sort of
      institutions in which he had believed all his life were not
      inevitably the best for all nations everywhere. Yet the
      spirit of the message suggests, at the same time, that of
      another war President. It was such a document as Lincoln
      might have written.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the man in the White House was thinking of Abraham
      Lincoln as he wrote those sentences--and no doubt he
      was--there was something which perhaps he overlooked.
      Counsels of idealism sometimes fail in the relaxation that
      comes with peace. Lincoln had not lived to see what happens
      to a policy of "sober, friendly counsel" in a post-war
      decade; he had been taken off in the moment of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woodrow Wilson was not to be so fortunate.

    <p>
      What a day that 11th of November was! It was not quite
      three o'clock in the morning when the State Department gave
      out to the dozing newspapermen the news that the Armistice
      had really been signed. Four days before, a false report of
      the end of hostilities had thrown the whole United States
      into a delirium of joy. People had poured out of offices
      and shops and paraded the streets singing and shouting,
      ringing bells, blowing tin horns, smashing one another's
      hats, cheering soldiers in uniform, draping themselves in
      American flags, gathering in closely packed crowds before
      the newspaper bulletin boards, making a wild and hilarious
      holiday; in New York, Fifth Avenue had been closed to
      traffic and packed solid with surging men and women, while
      down from the windows of the city fluttered 155 tons of
      ticker tape and torn paper. It did not seem possible that
      such an outburst could be repeated. But it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      By half-past four on the morning of the 11th, sirens,
      whistles, and bells were rousing the sleepers in a score of
      American cities, and newsboys were shouting up and down the
      dark streets. At first people were slow to credit the
      report; they had been fooled once and were not to be fooled
      again. Along an avenue in Washington, under the windows of
      the houses of government officials, a boy announced with
      painstaking articulation, "THE WAR IS OVAH! OFFICIAL
      GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT CONFIRMS THE NEWS!" He did not
      mumble as newsboys ordinarily do; he knew that this was a
      time to convince the skeptical by being intelligible and
      specific. The words brought incredible relief. A new era of
      peace and of hope was beginning--had already begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the tidings spread throughout the country. In city after
      city mid-morning found offices half deserted, signs tacked
      up on shop doors reading "Closed for the Kaiser's Funeral,"
      people marching up and down the streets again as they had
      four days previously, pretty girls kissing every soldier
      they saw, automobiles slowly creeping through the crowds
      and intentionally backfiring to add to the noise of horns
      and rattles and every other sort of din-making device.
      Eight hundred Barnard College girls snake-danced on
      Morningside Heights in New York; and in Times Square, early
      in the morning, a girl mounted the platform of "Liberty
      Hall," a building set up for war-campaign purposes, and
      sang the "Doxology" before hushed crowds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet as if to mock the Wilsonian statement about "sober,
      friendly counsel," there were contrasting celebrations in
      which the mood was not that of pious thanksgiving, but of
      triumphant hate. Crowds burned the Kaiser in effigy. In New
      York, a dummy of the Kaiser was washed down Wall Street
      with a firehose; men carried a coffin made of soapboxes up
      and down Fifth Avenue, shouting that the Kaiser was within
      it, "resting in pieces"; and on Broadway at Seventieth
      Street a boy drew pictures of the Kaiser over and over
      again on the sidewalk, to give the crowds the delight of
      trampling on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the new era of peace began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a million men--to paraphrase Bryan--cannot spring from
      arms overnight. There were still over three and a half
      million Americans in the military service, over two million
      of them in Europe. Uniforms were everywhere. Even after the
      tumult and shouting of November 11th had died, the
      Expeditionary Forces were still in the trenches, making
      ready for the long, cautious march into Germany; civilians
      were still saving sugar and eating strange dark breads and
      saving coal; it was not until ten days had passed that the
      "lightless" edict of the Fuel Administration was withdrawn,
      and Broadway and a dozen lesser white ways in other cities
      blazed once more; the railroads were still operated by the
      government, and one bought one's tickets at United States
      Railroad Administration Consolidated Ticket Offices; the
      influenza epidemic, which had taken more American lives
      than had the Germans, and had caused thousands of men and
      women to go about fearfully with white cloth masks over
      their faces, was only just abating; the newspapers were
      packed with reports from the armies in Europe, news of the
      revolution in Germany, of Mr. Wilson's peace preparations,
      of the United War Work Campaign, to the exclusion of almost
      everything else; and day after day, week after week, month
      after month, the casualty lists went on, and from Maine to
      Oregon men and women searched them in daily apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      November would normally have brought the climax of the
      football season, but now scratch college teams, made up
      mostly of boys who had been wearing the uniform of the
      Students' Army Training Corps, played benefit games "to put
      the War Work Fund over the top"; and further to strengthen
      the will to give, Charlie Brickley of Harvard drop-kicked a
      football across Wall Street into the arms of Jack Gates of
      Yale on the balcony of the Stock Exchange. Not only the
      news columns of the papers, but the advertisements also,
      showed the domination of wartime emotions. Next to an
      editorial on "The Right to Hate the Huns," or a letter
      suggesting that the appropriate punishment for the Kaiser
      would be to deport him from country to country, always as
      an "undesirable alien," the reader would find a huge United
      War Work Fund advertisement, urging him to
      GIVE--GIVE--GIVE! On another page, under the title of
      PREPARING AMERICA TO REBUILD THE WORLD, he would find a
      patriotic blast beginning, "Now that liberty has triumphed,
      now that the forces of Right have begun their
      reconstruction of humanity's morals, the world faces a
      material task of equal magnitude," and not until he had
      waded through several more sentences of sonorous rhetoric
      would he discover that this "material task" was to be
      accomplished through the use of Blank's Steel Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even as the process of demobilization got definitely
      under way, as the soldiers began to troop home from the
      camps, as censorship was done away with and lights were
      permitted to burn brightly again and women began to buy
      sugar with an easy conscience; even as this glorious peace
      began to seem a reality and not a dream, the nation went on
      thinking with the mind of people at war. They had learned
      during the preceding nineteen months to strike down the
      thing they hated--not to argue or hesitate, but to strike.
      Germany had been struck down, but it seemed that there was
      another danger on the horizon. Bolshevism was spreading
      from Russia through Europe; Bolshevism might spread to the
      United States. They struck at it--or at what they thought
      was it. A week after the Armistice, Mayor Hylan of New York
      forbade the display of the red flag in the streets and
      ordered the police to "disperse all unlawful assemblages."
      A few nights later, while the Socialists were holding a
      mass meeting in Madison Square Garden, five hundred
      soldiers and sailors gathered from the surrounding streets
      and tried to storm the doors. It took twenty-two mounted
      policemen to break up the milling mob and restore order.
      The next evening there was another riot before the doors of
      the Palm Garden, farther up town, where a meeting of
      sympathy for Revolutionary Russia was being held under the
      auspices of the Women's International League. Again
      soldiers and sailors were the chief offenders. They packed
      Fifty-eighth Street for a block, shouting and trying to
      break their way into the Palm Garden, and in the
      <i>mêlée</i> six persons were badly beaten up. One of the
      victims was a conservative stockbroker. He was walking up
      Lexington Avenue with a lady, and seeing the yelling crowd,
      he asked someone what all the excitement was about. A
      sailor called out, "Hey, fellows, here's another of the
      Bolsheviks," and in a moment a score of men had leaped upon
      him, ripped off his tie, and nearly knocked him
      unconscious. These demonstrations were to prove the first
      of a long series of post-war anti-Red riots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nation at war had formed the habit of summary action,
      and it was not soon unlearned. The circumstances and
      available methods had changed, that was all. Employers who
      had watched with resentment the rising scale of wages paid
      to labor, under the encouragement of a government that
      wanted no disaffection in the ranks of the workers, now
      felt that their chance had come. The Germans were beaten;
      the next thing to do was to teach labor a lesson. Labor
      agitators were a bunch of Bolsheviks, anyhow, and it was
      about time that a man had a chance to make a decent profit
      in his business. Meanwhile labor, facing a steadily
      mounting cost of living, and realizing that it was no
      longer unpatriotic to strike for higher wages, decided to
      teach the silk-stockinged profiteering employer a lesson in
      his turn. The result was a bitter series of strikes and
      lockouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a summary action with regard to liquor, too.
      During the war alcohol had been an obvious menace to the
      fighting efficiency of the nation. The country, already
      largely dry by state law and local option, had decided to
      banish the saloon once and for all. War-time psychology was
      dominant; no halfway measure would serve. The War-time
      Prohibition Act was already on the books and due to take
      effect July 1, 1919. But this was not enough. The
      Eighteenth Amendment, which would make prohibition
      permanent and (so it was thought) effective, had been
      passed by Congress late in 1917, and many of the states had
      ratified it before the war ended. With the convening of the
      state legislatures in January, 1919, the movement for
      ratification went ahead with amazing speed. The New York
      <i>Tribune</i> said that it was "as if a sailing-ship on a
      windless ocean were sweeping ahead, propelled by some
      invisible force." "Prohibition seems to be the fashion,
      just as drinking once was," exclaimed the <i>Times</i>
      editorially. By January 16th--within nine weeks of the
      Armistice--the necessary thirty-six States had ratified the
      Amendment. Even New York State fell in line a few days
      later. Whisky and the "liquor ring" were struck at as
      venomously as were the Reds. There were some misgivings, to
      be sure; there were those who pointed out that three
      million men in uniform might not like the new dispensation;
      but the country was not in the mood to think twice.
      Prohibition went through on the tide of the war spirit of
      "no compromise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though the headlong temper of war-time persisted after
      the Armistice, in one respect the coming of peace brought
      about a profound change. During the war the nation had gone
      about its tasks in a mood of exaltation. Top sergeants
      might remark that the only good Hun was a dead one and that
      this stuff about making the world safe for democracy was
      all bunk; four-minute speakers might shout that the Kaiser
      ought to be boiled in oil; the fact remained that millions
      of Americans were convinced that they were fighting in a
      holy cause, for the rights of oppressed nations, for the
      end of all war forever, for all that the schoolmaster in
      Washington so eloquently preached. The singing of the
      "Doxology" by the girl in Times Square represented their
      true feeling as truly as the burning of the Kaiser in
      effigy. The moment the Armistice was signed, however, a
      subtle change began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now those who had never liked Wilson, who thought that he
      had stayed out of the war too long, that milk and water ran
      in his veins instead of blood, that he should never have
      been forgiven for his treatment of Roosevelt and Wood, that
      he was a dangerous radical at heart and a menace to the
      capitalistic system, that he should never have appealed to
      the country for the election of a Democratic Congress, or
      that his idea of going to Paris himself to the Peace
      Conference was a sign of egomania--these people began to
      speak out freely. There were others who were tired of
      applauding the French, or who had ideas of their own about
      the English and the English attitude toward Ireland, or who
      were sick of hearing about "our noble Allies" in general,
      or who thought that we had really gone into the war to save
      our own skins and that the Wilsonian talk about making the
      world safe for democracy was dangerous and hypocritical
      nonsense. They, too, began to speak out freely. Now one
      could say with impunity, "We've licked the Germans and
      we're going to lick these damned Bolsheviki, and it's about
      time we got after Wilson and his crew of pacifists." The
      tension of the war was relaxing, the bubble of idealism was
      pricked. As the first weeks of peace slipped away, it began
      to appear doubtful whether the United States was quite as
      ready as Woodrow Wilson had thought "to assist in the
      establishment of just democracy throughout the world."

      But the mind of Mr. Wilson, too, had been molded by the
      war. Since April, 1917, his will had been irresistible. In
      the United States open opposition to his leadership had
      been virtually stifled: it was unpatriotic to differ with
      the President. His message and speeches had set the tone of
      popular thought about American war aims and the terms of
      eventual peace. In Europe his eloquence had proved so
      effective that statesmen had followed his lead perforce and
      allowed the Armistice to be made upon his terms. All over
      the world there were millions upon millions of men and
      women to whom his words were as those of a Messiah. Now
      that he envisioned a new world order based upon a League of
      Nations, it seemed inevitable to him that he himself should
      go to Paris, exert this vast and beneficent power, and make
      the vision a reality. The splendid dream took full
      possession of him. Critics like Senator Lodge and even
      associates like Secretary Lansing might object that he
      ought to leave the negotiations to subordinates, or that
      peace should be made with Germany first, and discussion of
      the League postponed, in order to bring an unsettled world
      back to equilibrium without delay; but had he not silenced
      critics during the war and could he not silence them again?
      On the 4th of December--less than a month after the
      Armistice--the President sailed from New York on the
      <i>George Washington.</i> As the crowds along the
      waterfront shouted their tribute and the vessels in the
      harbor tooted their whistles and the guns roared in a
      presidential salute, Woodrow Wilson, standing on the bridge
      of the <i>George Washington,</i> eastward bound, must have
      felt that destiny was on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of the next few weeks only confirmed him in this
      feeling. He toured France and England and Italy in
      incredible triumph. Never had such crowds greeted a
      foreigner on British soil. His progress through the streets
      of London could be likened only to a Coronation procession.
      In Italy the streets were black with people come to do him
      honor. "No one has ever had such cheers," wrote William
      Bolitho; "I, who heard them in the streets of Paris, can
      never forget them in my life. I saw Foch pass, Clemenceau
      pass, Lloyd George, generals, returning troops, banners,
      but Wilson heard from his carriage something different,
      inhuman--or superhuman." Seeing those overwhelming crowds
      and hearing their shouts of acclaim, how could Woodrow
      Wilson doubt that he was still invincible? If, when the
      Conference met, he could only speak so that they might
      hear, no diplomatists of the old order could withstand him.
      Destiny was taking him, and the whole world with him,
      toward a future bright with promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as it happened, destiny had other plans. In Europe, as
      well as in America, idealism was on the ebb. Lloyd George,
      that unfailing barometer of public opinion, was campaigning
      for reëlection on a "Hang the Kaiser" platform; and shout
      as the crowds might for Wilson and justice, they voted for
      Lloyd George and vengeance. Now that the Germans were
      beaten, a score of jealous European politicians were
      wondering what they could get out of the settlement at
      Paris for their own national ends and their own personal
      glory. They wanted to bring home the spoils of war. They
      heard the mob applaud Wilson, but they knew that mobs are
      fickle and would applaud annexations and punitive
      reparations with equal fervor. They went to Paris
      determined to make a peace which would give them plunder to
      take home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile in the Senate Chamber at Washington
      opposition to Wilson's League and Wilson's Fourteen Points
      increased in volume. As early as December 21, 1918, Henry
      Cabot Lodge, intellectual leader of the Republicans in the
      Senate, announced that the Senate had equal power with the
      President in treaty-making and should make its wishes known
      in advance of the negotiations. He said that there would be
      quite enough to do at Paris without raising the issue of
      the League. And he set forth his idea of the sort of peace
      which ought to be made--an idea radically different from
      President Wilson's. Lodge and a group of his associates
      wanted Germany to be disarmed, saddled with a terrific bill
      for reparations, and if possible dismembered. They were
      ready to give to the Allies large concessions in territory.
      And above all, they wanted nothing to be included in the
      peace settlement which would commit the United States to
      future intervention in European affairs. They prepared to
      examine carefully any plan for a League of Nations which
      might come out of the Conference and to resist it if it
      involved "entangling alliances." Thus to opposition from
      the diplomats of Europe was added opposition of another
      sort from the Senate and public opinion at home. Wilson was
      between two fires. He might not realize how they threatened
      him, but they were spreading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide of events, had Wilson but known it, was turning
      against him. Human nature, the world over, was beginning to
      show a new side, as it has shown it at the end of every war
      in history. The compulsion for unity was gone, and division
      was taking its place. The compulsion for idealism was gone,
      and realism was in the ascendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did destiny work only through the diplomats of the Old
      World and the senatorial patriots of the New. It worked
      also through the peculiar limitations in the mind and
      character of Woodrow Wilson himself. The very singleness of
      purpose, the very uncompromising quality of mind that had
      made him a great prophet, forced him to take upon his own
      shoulders at Paris an impossible burden of responsible
      negotiation. It prevented him from properly acquainting his
      colleagues with what he himself was doing at the sessions
      of the Council of Ten or the Council of Four, and from
      getting the full benefit of their suggestions and
      objections. It prevented him from taking the American
      correspondents at Paris into his confidence and thus
      gaining valuable support at home. It made him play a lone
      hand. Again, his intelligence was visual rather than oral.
      As Ray Stannard Baker has well put it, Wilson was
      "accustomed to getting his information, not from people,
      but out of books, documents, letters--the written word,"
      and consequently "underestimated the value of . . . human
      contacts." At written negotiations he was a past master,
      but in the oral give and take about a small conference
      table he was at a disadvantage. When Clemenceau and Lloyd
      George and Orlando got him into the Council of Four behind
      closed doors, where they could play the game of
      treaty-making like a four-handed card game, they had
      already half defeated him. A superman might have gone to
      Paris and come home completely victorious, but Woodrow
      Wilson could not have been what he was and have carried the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no place to tell the long and bitter story of the
      President's fight for his ideals at Paris. Suffice it to
      say that he fought stubbornly and resourcefully, and
      succeeded to a creditable extent in moderating the terms of
      the Treaty. The European diplomats wanted to leave the
      discussion of the League until after the territorial and
      military settlements had been made, but he forced them to
      put the League first. Sitting as chairman of the commission
      appointed to draw up the League Covenant, he brought out a
      preliminary draft which met, as he supposed, the principal
      objections to it made by men at home like Taft and Root and
      Lodge. In Paris he confronted a practically unanimous
      sentiment for annexation of huge slices of German territory
      and of all the German colonies; even the British dominions,
      through their premiers, came out boldly for annexation and
      supported one another in their colonial claims; yet he
      succeeded in getting the Conference to accept the mandate
      principle. He forced Clemenceau to modify his demands for
      German territory, though he had to threaten to leave Paris
      to get his way. He forced Italy to accept less land than
      she wanted, though he had to venture a public appeal to the
      conscience of the world to do it. Again and again it was
      he, and he only, who prevented territories from being
      parceled out among the victors without regard to the
      desires of their inhabitants. To read the day-to-day story
      of the Conference is to realize that the settlement would
      have been far more threatening to the future peace of the
      world had Woodrow Wilson not struggled as he did to bring
      about an agreement fair to all. Yet the result, after all,
      was a compromise. The Treaty followed in too many respects
      the provisions of the iniquitous secret treaties of
      war-time; and the League Covenant which Wilson had managed
      to imbed securely in it was too rigid and too full of
      possible military obligations to suit an American people
      tired of war and ready to get out of Europe once and for
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President must have been fully aware of the ugly
      imperfections in the Treaty of Versailles as he sailed back
      to America with it at the end of June, 1919, more than six
      months after his departure for France. He must have
      realized that, despite all his efforts, the men who had sat
      about the council table at Paris had been more swayed by
      fear and hate and greed and narrow nationalism than by the
      noble motives of which he had been the mouthpiece. No
      rational man with his eyes and ears open could have failed
      to sense the disillusionment which was slowly settling down
      upon the world, or the validity of many of the objections
      to the Treaty which were daily being made in the Senate at
      Washington. Yet what could Wilson do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Could he come home to the Senate and the American people
      and say, in effect: "This Treaty is a pretty bad one in
      some respects. I shouldn't have accepted the Shantung
      clause or the Italian border clause or the failure to set a
      fixed German indemnity or the grabbing of a lot of German
      territory by France and others unless I had had to, but
      under the circumstances this is about the best we could do
      and I think the League will make up for the rest"? He could
      not; he had committed himself to each and every clause; he
      had signed the Treaty, and must defend it. Could he admit
      that the negotiators at Paris had failed to act in the
      unselfish spirit which he had proclaimed in advance that
      they would show? To do this would be to admit his own
      failure and kill his own prestige. Having proclaimed before
      the Conference that the settlement would be righteous and
      having insisted during the Conference that it was
      righteous, how could he admit afterward that it had not
      been righteous? The drift of events had caught him in a
      predicament from which there seemed to be but one outlet of
      escape. He must go home and vow that the Conference had
      been a love-feast, that every vital decision had been based
      on the Fourteen Points, that Clemenceau and Orlando and
      Lloyd George and the rest had been animated by an
      overpowering love for humanity, and that the salvation of
      the world depended on the complete acceptance of the Treaty
      as the charter of a new and idyllic world order.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what he did; and because the things he said about
      the Treaty were not true, and he must have
      known--sometimes, at least--that they were not, the story
      of Woodrow Wilson from this point on is sheer tragedy. He
      fell into the pit which is dug for every idealist. Having
      failed to embody his ideal in fact, he distorted the fact.
      He pictured the world, to himself and to others, not as it
      was, but as he wished it to be. The optimist became a
      sentimentalist. The story of the Conference which he told
      to the American people when he returned home was a very
      beautiful romance of good men and true laboring without
      thought of selfish advantage for the welfare of humanity.
      He said that if the United States did not come to the aid
      of mankind by endorsing all that had been done at Paris,
      the heart of the world would be broken. But the only heart
      which was broken was his own.

    <p>
      Henry Cabot Lodge was a gentleman, a scholar, and an
      elegant and persuasive figure in the United States Senate.
      As he strolled down the aisle of the Senate
      Chamber--slender, graceful, gray-haired, gray-bearded, the
      embodiment of all that was patrician--he caught and held
      the eye as might William Gillette on a crowded stage. He
      need not raise his voice, he need only turn for a moment
      and listen to a sentence or two of some colleague's florid
      speech and then walk indifferently on, to convince a
      visitor in the gallery that the speech was unworthy of
      attention. It was about Lodge that the opposition to Wilson
      gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed in Americanism. He believed that the essence of
      American foreign policy should be to keep the country clear
      of foreign entanglements unless our honor was involved, to
      be ready to fight and fight hard the moment it became
      involved, and, when the fight was over, to disentangle
      ourselves once more, stand aloof, and mind our own
      business. (Our honor, as Lodge saw it, was involved if our
      prerogatives were threatened; to Woodrow Wilson, on the
      other hand, national honor was a moral matter: only by
      shameful conduct could a nation lose it.) As chairman of
      the Foreign Relations Committee, Lodge conceived it to be
      his duty to see that the United States was not drawn into
      any international agreement which would endanger this
      time-honored policy. He did not believe that the nations of
      the world could be trusted to spend the rest of their years
      behaving like so many Boy Scouts; he knew that, to be
      effective, a treaty must be serviceable in eras of bad
      feeling as well as good; and he saw in the present one many
      an invitation to trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Lodge was also a politician. Knowing that his
      Massachusetts constituents numbered among them hundreds of
      thousands of Irish, he asked the overworked peace delegates
      at Paris to give a hearing to Messrs. Frank P. Walsh,
      Edward F. Dunn, and Michael J. Ryan, the so-called American
      Commission for Irish Independence, though it was difficult
      for anyone but an Irishman to say what Irish independence
      had to do with the Treaty. Remembering, too, the size of
      the Italian vote, Lodge was willing to embarrass President
      Wilson, in the midst of the Italian crisis at the
      Conference, by saying in a speech to the Italians of Boston
      that Italy ought to have Fiume and control the Adriatic.
      Finally, Lodge had no love for Woodrow Wilson. So strongly
      did he feel that Wilson's assumption of the right to speak
      for American opinion was unwarranted and iniquitous, that
      when Henry White, the only Republican on the American Peace
      Commission, sailed for Europe, Lodge put into White's hands
      a secret memorandum containing his own extremely
      un-Wilsonian idea of what peace terms the American people
      would stand for, and suggested that White show it in strict
      confidence to Balfour, Clemenceau, and Nitti, adding, "This
      knowledge may in certain circumstances be very important to
      them in strengthening their position." No honorable man
      could have made such a suggestion unless he believed the
      defeat of the President's program to be essential to the
      country's welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      United with Lodge in skepticism about the Treaty, if in
      nothing else, was a curious combination of men and of
      influences. There were hard-shelled tories like Brandegee;
      there were Western idealists like Borah, who distrusted any
      association with foreign diplomats as the blond country boy
      of the old-fashioned melodrama distrusted association with
      the slick city man; there were chronic dissenters like La
      Follette and Jim Reed; there were Republicans who were not
      sorry to put the Democratic President into a hole, and
      particularly a President who had appealed in war-time for
      the election of a Democratic Congress; there were Senators
      anxious to show that nobody could make a treaty without the
      advice as well as the consent of the Senate, and get away
      with it; and there were not a few who, in addition to their
      other reasons for opposition, shared Lodge's personal
      distaste for Wilsonian rhetoric. Outside the Senate there
      was opposition of still other varieties. The Irish were
      easily inflamed against a League of Nations that gave "six
      seats to England." The Italians were ready to denounce a
      man who had refused to let Italy have Fiume. Many Germans,
      no matter how loyal to the United States they may have been
      during the war, had little enthusiasm for the hamstringing
      of the German Republic and the denial to Germany of a seat
      in the League. There were some people who thought that
      America had got too little out of the settlement. And there
      were a vast number who saw in the League Covenant, and
      especially in Article X, obligations with which they were
      not willing to have the nation saddled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from all these groups, furthermore, there was another
      factor to be reckoned with: the growing apathy of millions
      of Americans toward anything which reminded them of the
      war. They were fast becoming sick and tired of the whole
      European mess. They wanted to be done with it. They didn't
      want to be told of new sacrifices to be made--they had made
      plenty. Gone was the lift of the day when a girl singing
      the "Doxology" in Times Square could express their feelings
      about victory. This was all over now, the Willard-Dempsey
      fight and the arrival of the British dirigible R-34 at Long
      Island were much more interesting.

    <p>
      On the 10th of July, 1919, the President, back in
      Washington again, laid the Treaty of Versailles before the
      Senate, denying that the compromises which had been
      accepted as inevitable by the American negotiators "cut to
      the heart of any principle." In his words as he addressed
      the Senate was all the eloquence which only a few months
      ago had swayed the world. "The stage is set, the destiny
      disclosed. It has come about by no plan of our conceiving,
      but by the hand of God who led us into the way. We cannot
      turn back. We can only go forward, with lifted eyes and
      freshened spirit, to follow the vision. It was of this that
      we dreamed at our birth. America shall in truth show the
      way. The light streams upon the path ahead and nowhere
      else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine words--but they brought no overwhelming appeal from
      the country for immediate ratification. The country was
      tired of going forward with lifted eyes, and Woodrow
      Wilson's prose style, now all too familiar, could no longer
      freshen its spirit. The Treaty--a document as long as a
      novel--was referred to Lodge's Committee on Foreign
      Relations, which settled down to study it at leisure. A
      month later Lodge rose in the Senate to express his
      preference for national independence and security, to
      insist that Articles X and XI of the League Covenant gave
      "other powers" the right "to call out American troops and
      American ships to any part of the world," and to reply to
      Wilson: "We would not have our politics distracted and
      embittered by the dissensions of other lands. We would not
      have our country's vigor exhausted, or her moral force
      abated, by everlasting meddling and muddling in every
      quarrel, great and small, which afflicts the world." And
      within a fortnight Lodge's committee began voting--although
      by a narrow margin in each case--to amend the Treaty; to
      give Shantung to China, to relieve the United States of
      membership in international commissions, to give the United
      States the same vote as Great Britain in the League, and to
      shut off the representatives of the British dominions from
      voting on questions affecting the British Empire. It began
      to look as if the process of making amendments and
      reservations might go on indefinitely. Woodrow Wilson
      decided to play his last desperate card. He would go to the
      people. He would win them to his cause, making a speaking
      trip through the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      His doctors advised against it, for physically the
      President was almost at the end of his rope. Never robust,
      for months he had been under a terrific strain. Again and
      again during the Peace Conference, Ray Stannard Baker would
      find him, after a long day of nerve-wracking sessions,
      looking "utterly beaten, worn out, his face quite haggard
      and one side of it twitching painfully." At one time he had
      broken down--had been taken with a sudden attack of
      influenza, with violent paroxysms of coughing and a fever
      of 103°--only to be up again and at his labors within a few
      days. Now, in September, his nerves frayed by continued
      overwork and by the thought of possible failure of all he
      had given his heart and strength for, he was like a man
      obsessed. He could think of nothing but the Treaty and the
      League. He cared for nothing but to bring them through to
      victory. And so, despite all that those about him could
      say, he left Washington on September 3rd to undergo the
      even greater strain of a speaking trip--the preparation and
      delivery of one or even two speeches a day in huge
      sweltering auditoriums (and without amplifiers to ease the
      strain on his voice); the automobile processions through
      city after city (during which he had to stand up in his car
      and continuously wave his hat to the crowds); the swarms of
      reporters, the hand-shaking, the glare of publicity, and
      the restless sleep of one who travels night in and night
      out on a swaying train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again on that long trip of his, Woodrow Wilson
      painted the picture of the Treaty and the League that lived
      in his own mind, a picture which bore fainter and fainter
      resemblance to the reality. He spoke of the "generous,
      high-minded, statesman-like coöperation" which had been
      manifest at the Paris Conference; he said that "the hearts
      of men like Clemenceau and Lloyd George and Orlando beat
      with the people of the world," and that the heart of
      humanity beat in the document which they had produced. He
      represented America, and indeed every other country, as
      thrilling to a new ideal. "The whole world is now in a
      state where you can fancy that there are hot tears upon
      every cheek, and those hot tears are tears of sorrow. They
      are also tears of hope." He warned his audiences that if
      the Treaty were not ratified, disorder would shake the
      foundations of the world, and he envisioned "this great
      nation marching at the fore of a great procession" to
      "those heights upon which there rests nothing but the pure
      light of the justice of God." Every one of those forty
      speeches was different from every other, and each was
      perfectly ordered, beautifully phrased, and thrilling with
      passion. As an intellectual feat the delivery of them was
      remarkable. Yet each pictured a dream world and a dream
      Treaty, and instinctively the country knew it. (Perhaps,
      indeed, there were moments of terrible sanity when, as the
      President lay sleepless in his private car, he himself knew
      how far from the truth he had departed.) The expected surge
      of public opinion toward Wilson's cause failed to
      materialize. The Senate went right on discussing
      reservations. On September 24th, the first test vote went
      against the President 43 to 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the next day Wilson came to the end of his
      strength. For some time he had had indigestion and had
      slept little. After his long speech at Pueblo on the
      evening of September 25th he could not sleep at all. The
      train was stopped and Mr. and Mrs. Wilson took a walk
      together on a country road. When he returned to the train
      he was feverish and "as he slept under a narcotic, his
      mouth drooled. His body testified in many ways to an
      impending crash." The next morning when he tried to get up
      he could hardly stand. The train hurried on toward
      Washington and all future speaking engagements were
      canceled. Back to the White House the sick man went. A few
      days later a cerebral thrombosis partially paralyzed his
      left side. Another act of the tragedy had come to an end.
      He had given all he had to the cause, and it had not been
      enough.

    <p>
      There followed one of the most extraordinary periods in the
      whole history of the Presidency. For weeks Woodrow Wilson
      lay seriously ill, sometimes unable even to sign documents
      awaiting his signature. He could not sit up in a chair for
      over a month, or venture out for a ride in the White House
      automobile for five months. During all the rest of his
      term--which lasted until March 4, 1921, seventeen months
      after his breakdown--he remained in feeble and precarious
      health, a sick man lying in bed or sitting in an invalid's
      chair, his left side and left leg and left arm partially
      paralyzed. Within the White House he was immured as if in a
      hospital. He saw almost nobody, transacted only the most
      imperative business of his office. The only way of
      communicating with him was by letter, and as during most of
      this time all letters must pass through the hands of Mrs.
      Wilson or Admiral Grayson or others in the circle of
      attendants upon the invalid, and few were answered, there
      was often no way of knowing who was responsible for a
      failure to answer them or to act in accordance with the
      suggestions embodied in them. Sometimes, in fact, it was
      suspected that it was Mrs. Wilson who was responsible for
      many a White House decision--that the country was in effect
      being governed by a regency.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the President virtually unable to function, the whole
      executive machine came almost to a stop. It could, to be
      sure, continue its routine tasks; and an aggressive member
      of the Cabinet like Attorney-General Palmer could go
      blithely ahead rounding up radicals and deporting them and
      getting out injunctions against strikers as if he had the
      full wisdom and power of the Presidency behind him; but
      most matters of policy waited upon the White House, and
      after a while it became clear that guidance from that
      quarter could hardly be expected. There were vital problems
      clamoring for the attention of the Executive: the high cost
      of living, the subsequent breakdown of business prosperity
      and increase of unemployment; the intense bitterness
      between capital and labor, culminating in the great steel
      and coal strikes; the reorganization of the government
      departments on a peace basis; the settlement of innumerable
      questions of foreign policy unconnected with the Treaty or
      the League. Yet upon most of these problems the sick man
      had no leadership to offer. Meanwhile his influence with
      Congress and the country, far from being increased by his
      martyrdom for the League, dwindled to almost nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this strange state of affairs upon official
      Washington was well described a year or two later by Edward
      G. Lowry in <i>Washington Close-ups:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a long time the social-political atmosphere of
      Washington had been one of bleak and chill austerity
      suffused and envenomed by hatred of a sick chief magistrate
      that seemed to poison and blight every human relationship.
      The White House was isolated. It had no relation with the
      Capitol or the local resident and official community. Its
      great iron gates were closed and chained and locked.
      Policemen guarded its approaches. It was in a void apart. .
      . . It all made for bleakness and bitterness and a general
      sense of frustration and unhappiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilson's mind remained clear. When the report went
      about that he was unable "to discharge the powers and
      duties" of his office and should, therefore, under the
      provisions of the Constitution, be supplanted by the
      Vice-President (and reports of this sort were frequent in
      those days) Senators Fall and Hitchcock visited him in
      behalf of the Senate to determine his mental condition.
      They found him keenly alive to the humor of their
      embarrassing mission; he laughed and joked with them and
      showed a complete grasp of the subjects under discussion.
      Nevertheless, something had gone out of him. His messages
      were lifeless, his mind was sterile of new ideas. He could
      not meet new situations in a new way: reading his public
      documents, one felt that his brain was still turning over
      old ideas, rearranging old phrases, that he was still
      living in that dream world which he had built about himself
      during the days of his fight for the League.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always been a lonely man; and now, as if pursued by
      some evil demon, he broke with one after another of those
      who still tried to serve him. For long years Colonel House
      had been his chief adviser as well as his affectionate
      friend. During the latter days of the Peace Conference a
      certain coolness had been noticed in Wilson's attitude
      toward House. This very conciliatory man had been perhaps a
      little too conciliatory in his negotiations during the
      President's absence from Paris: rightly or wrongly, the
      President felt that House had unwittingly played into the
      hands of the wily Clemenceau. Nevertheless, House hoped, on
      his return from Paris, to be able to effect a rapprochement
      between his broken chief and the defiant Senators. House
      wrote to suggest that Wilson accept certain reservations to
      the Treaty. There was no answer to the letter. House wrote
      again. No answer. There was never any explanation. The
      friendship and the political relationship, long so valuable
      to the President and so influential in the direction of
      policy, were both at an end--that was all one could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Lansing had been at odds with the President over
      many things before and during the Peace Conference; yet he
      remained as Secretary of State and believed himself to be
      on good terms with his chief. During Wilson's illness,
      deciding that something must be done to enable the
      government to transact business, he called meetings of the
      Cabinet, which were held in the Cabinet Room at the White
      House offices. He was peremptorily dismissed. Last of all
      to go was the faithful Joe Tumulty, who had been Wilson's
      secretary through fair weather and foul, in the Governor's
      office at Trenton and for eight years at Washington.
      Although the break with Tumulty happened after Wilson left
      the White House, it deserves mention here because it so
      resembles the others and reveals what poison was working in
      the sick man's mind. In April, 1922, there was to be held
      in New York a Democratic dinner. Before the dinner Tumulty
      visited Wilson and got what he supposed to be an oral
      message to the effect that Wilson would "support any man
      [for the Presidency] who will stand for the salvation of
      America, and the salvation of America is justice to all
      classes." It seemed an innocuous message, and after ten
      years of association with Wilson, Tumulty had reason to
      suppose that he knew when Wilson might be quoted and when
      he might not. But as it happened, Governor Cox spoke at the
      Democratic dinner, and the message, when Tumulty gave it,
      was interpreted as an endorsement of Cox; whereupon Wilson
      wrote a curt letter to the <i>New York Times</i> denying
      that he had authorized anybody to give a message from him.
      Tumulty at once wrote to Wilson to explain that he had
      acted in good faith and to apologize like a true friend for
      having caused the President embarrassment. His letter was
      "courteously answered by Mrs. Wilson" (to use Tumulty's own
      subsequent words), but Wilson himself said not a word more.
      Again Tumulty wrote loyally, saying that he would always
      regard Mr. Wilson with affection and would be "always
      around the corner when you need me." There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the issue of the Treaty and the League Woodrow Wilson
      remained adamant to the end. Call it unswerving loyalty to
      principle or call it stubbornness, as you will--he would
      consent to no reservations except (when it was too late)
      some innocuous "interpretive" ones, framed by Senator
      Hitchcock, which went down to defeat. While the President
      lay critically ill, the Senate went right on proposing
      reservation after reservation, and on November 19, 1919, it
      defeated the Treaty. Only a small majority of the Senators
      were at that time irreconcilable opponents of the pact; but
      they were enough to carry the day. By combining forces with
      Wilson's Democratic supporters who favored the passage of
      the Treaty without change, they secured a majority against
      the long list of reservations proposed by Lodge's
      committee. Then by combining forces with Lodge and the
      other reservationists, they defeated the Treaty minus the
      reservations. It was an ironical result, but it stood. A
      few months later the issue was raised again, and once more
      the Treaty went down to defeat. Finally a resolution for a
      separate peace with Germany was passed by both Houses--and
      vetoed by Wilson as "an action which would place an
      ineffaceable stain upon the gallantry and honor of the
      United States." (A similar peace resolution was ultimately
      signed by President Harding.) President Wilson's last hope
      was that the election of 1920 would serve as a "great and
      solemn referendum" in which the masses of the people--those
      masses who, he had always claimed, were on his side--would
      rise to vindicate him and the country. They rose--and
      swamped the pro-League candidate by a plurality of seven
      million.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not pleasant to imagine the thoughts of the sick man
      in the White House as defeat after defeat overwhelmed his
      cause and mocked the great sacrifice he had made for it.
      How soon the realization came upon him that everything was
      lost we do not know. After his breakdown, as he lay ill in
      the White House, did he still hope? It seems likely. All
      news from the outside world was filtered to him through
      those about him. With his life hanging in the balance, it
      would have been quite natural--if not inevitable--for them
      to wish to protect him from shock, to tell him that all was
      going well on the Hill, that the tide had swung back again,
      that this token and that showed that the American people
      would not fail him. On such a theory one might explain the
      break with Colonel House. Possibly any suggestion for
      compromise with the Lodge forces seemed to the President
      simply a craven proposal for putting up the white flag in
      the moment of victory. But whether or not this theory is
      justified, sooner or later the knowledge must have come, as
      vote after vote turned against the Treaty, and must have
      turned the taste of life to bitterness. Wilson's icy
      repudiation of faithful Joe Tumulty was the act of a man
      who has lost his faith in humankind.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the early spring of 1919, while Wilson was still at
      Paris, Samuel G. Blythe, an experienced observer of the
      political scene, had written in the <i>Saturday Evening
      Post</i> of the temper of the leaders of the Republican
      Party as they faced the issues of peace:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot teach an Old Guard new tricks. . . . The Old
      Guard surrenders but it never dies. Right at this minute,
      the ancient and archaic Republicans who think they control
      the destinies of the Republican Party--think they do!--are
      operating after the manner and style of 1896. The war
      hasn't made a dent in them. . . . The only way they look is
      backward."
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis was sound; but the Republican bosses, however
      open to criticism they may have been as statesmen, were at
      least good politicians. They had their ears where a good
      politician's should be--to the ground--and what they heard
      there was a rumble of discontent with Wilson and all that
      he represented. They determined that at the election of
      1920 they would choose as the Republican standard-bearer
      somebody who would present, both to themselves and to the
      country, a complete contrast with the idealist whom they
      detested. As the year rolled round and the date for the
      Republican Convention approached, they surveyed the field.
      The leading candidate was General Leonard Wood, a blunt
      soldier, an inheritor of Theodore Roosevelt's creed of
      fearing God and keeping your powder dry; he made a fairly
      good contrast with Wilson, but he promised to be almost as
      unmanageable. Then there was Governor Lowden of
      Illinois--but he, too, did not quite fulfill the ideal.
      Herbert Hoover, the reliever of Belgium and war-time Food
      Administrator, was conducting a highly amateur campaign for
      the nomination; the politicians dismissed him with a sour
      laugh. Why, this man Hoover hadn't known whether he was a
      Republican or Democrat until the campaign began! Hiram
      Johnson was in the field, but he also might prove
      stiff-necked, although it was to his advantage that he was
      a Senator. The bosses' inspired choice was none of these
      men: it was Warren Gamaliel Harding, a commonplace and
      unpretentious Senator from Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider how perfectly Harding met the requirements. Wilson
      was a visionary who liked to identify himself with
      "forward-looking men"; Harding, as Mr. Lowry put it, was as
      old-fashioned as those wooden Indians which used to stand
      in front of cigar stores, "a flower of the period before
      safety razors." Harding believed that statesmanship had
      come to its apogee in the days of McKinley and Foraker.
      Wilson was cold; Harding was an affable small-town man, at
      ease with "folks"; an ideal companion, as one of his
      friends expressed it, "to play poker with all Saturday
      night." Wilson had always been difficult of access; Harding
      was accessible to the last degree. Wilson favored labor,
      distrusted businessmen as a class, and talked of
      "industrial democracy"; Harding looked back with longing
      eyes to the good old days when the government didn't bother
      businessmen with unnecessary regulations, but provided them
      with fat tariffs and instructed the Department of Justice
      not to have them on its mind. Wilson was at logger-heads
      with Congress, and particularly with the Senate; Harding
      was not only a Senator, but a highly amenable Senator.
      Wilson had been adept at making enemies; Harding hadn't an
      enemy in the world. He was genuinely genial. "He had no
      knobs, he was the same size and smoothness all the way
      round," wrote Charles Willis Thompson. Wilson thought in
      terms of the whole world; Harding was for America first.
      And finally, whereas Wilson wanted America to exert itself
      nobly, Harding wanted to give it a rest. At Boston, a few
      weeks before the Convention, he had correctly expressed the
      growing desire of the people of the country and at the same
      time had unwittingly added a new word to the language, when
      he said, "America's present need is not heroics but
      healing; not nostrums but normalcy; not revolution but
      restoration; . . . not surgery but serenity." Here was a
      man whom a country wearied of moral obligations and the
      hope of the world could take to its heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is credibly reported that the decision in favor of
      Harding was made by the Republican bosses as early as
      February, 1920, four months before the Convention. But it
      was not until four ballots had been taken at the Convention
      itself--with Wood leading, Lowden second, and Harding
      fifth--and the wilted delegates had dispersed for the
      night, that the leaders finally concluded to put Harding
      over. Harding's political manager, an Ohio boss named Harry
      M. Daugherty, had predicted that the Convention would be
      deadlocked and that the nomination would be decided upon by
      twelve or thirteen men "at two o'clock in the morning, in a
      smoke-filled room." He was precisely right. The room was
      Colonel George Harvey's, in the Hotel Blackstone. Boies
      Penrose, lying mortally ill in Philadelphia, had given his
      instructions by private wire to John T. Adams. The word was
      passed round, and the next afternoon Harding was nominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats, relieved that Wilson's illness had
      disqualified him, duly nominated another equally
      undistinguished Ohio politician, Governor James M. Cox.
      This nominee had to swallow the League of Nations and did.
      He swung manfully around the circle, shouting himself
      hoarse, pointing with pride. But he hadn't a chance in the
      world. Senator Harding remained in his average small town
      and conducted a McKinley-esque front-porch campaign; he
      pitched horseshoes behind the house with his Republican
      advisers like an average small-town man and wore a McKinley
      carnation; he said just enough in behalf of "an association
      of nations" to permit inveterate Republicans who favored
      the League to vote for him without twinges of conscience,
      and just enough against Wilson's League to convince the
      majority that with him in the White House they would not be
      called upon to march to the aid of suffering
      Czechoslovakia; and the men and women of the United States
      woke up on the morning of November 3rd to find that they
      had swept him into the Presidency by a margin of sixteen
      million to nine million. Governor Cox, the sacrificial
      victim, faded rapidly into the mists of obscurity.
    </p>

      The United States had rendered its considered judgment on
      "our fortunate duty to assist by example, by sober,
      friendly counsel, and by material aid in the establishment
      of just democracy throughout the world." It had preferred
      normalcy.

      Woodrow Wilson lived on in Washington--in a large and
      comfortable house on S Street--for over three years after
      this final crushing defeat. Those who came to call upon him
      toward the end found a man prematurely old, huddled in a
      big chair by the fireplace in a sunny south room. He sat
      with his hands in his lap, his head a little on one side.
      His face and body were heavier than they had been in his
      days of power; his hair, now quite gray, was brushed back
      over an almost bald head. As he talked he did not move his
      head--only his eyes followed his visitor, and his right arm
      swung back and forth and occasionally struck the arm of the
      chair for emphasis as he made his points. The old-time
      urbanity was in his manner as he said, "You must excuse my
      not rising; I'm really quite lame." But as he talked of the
      foreign policy of the United States and of his enemies, his
      tone was full of hatred. This was no time to sprinkle
      rose-water round, he said; it was a time for
      fighting--there must be a party fight, "not in a partisan
      spirit, but on party lines." Still he clung to the last
      shred of hope that his party might follow the gleam. Of the
      men who had made the fulfillment of his great project
      impossible he spoke in unsparing terms. "I've got to get
      well, and then I'm going out to get a few scalps." So he
      nursed his grievance; an old man, helpless and bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Armistice Day, five years after the triumphant close of
      the war, he stood on the steps of his house--supported so
      that he should not fall--and spoke to a crowd that had
      gathered to do him honor. "I am not," said he, "one of
      those that have the least anxiety about the triumph of the
      principles I have stood for. I have seen fools resist
      Providence before and I have seen their destruction, as
      will come upon these again--utter destruction and contempt.
      That we shall prevail is as sure as that God reigns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months later he was dead.

      THE BIG RED SCARE
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      If the American people turned a deaf ear to Woodrow
      Wilson's plea for the League of Nations during the early
      years of the Post-war Decade, it was not simply because
      they were too weary of foreign entanglements and noble
      efforts to heed him. They were listening to something else.
      They were listening to ugly rumors of a huge radical
      conspiracy against the government and institutions of the
      United States. They had their ears cocked for the
      detonation of bombs and the tramp of Bolshevist armies.
      They seriously thought--or at least millions of them did,
      millions of otherwise reasonable citizens--that a Red
      revolution might begin in the United States the next month
      or next week, and they were less concerned with making the
      world safe for democracy than with making America safe for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were the days when column after column of the front
      pages of the newspapers shouted the news of strikes and
      anti-Bolshevist riots; when radicals shot down Armistice
      Day paraders in the streets of Centralia, Washington, and
      in revenge the patriotic citizenry took out of the jail a
      member of the I. W. W.--a white American, be it noted--and
      lynched him by tying a rope around his neck and throwing
      him off a bridge; when properly elected members of the
      Assembly of New York State were expelled (and their
      constituents thereby disfranchised) simply because they had
      been elected as members of the venerable Socialist Party;
      when a jury in Indiana took two minutes to acquit a man for
      shooting and killing an alien because he had shouted, "To
      hell with the United States"; and when the Vice-President
      of the nation cited as a dangerous manifestation of
      radicalism in the women's colleges the fact that the girl
      debaters of Radcliffe had upheld the affirmative in an
      intercollegiate debate on the subject: "Resolved, that the
      recognition of labor unions by employers is essential to
      successful collective bargaining." It was an era of lawless
      and disorderly defense of law and order, of
      unconstitutional defense of the Constitution, of suspicion
      and civil conflict--in a very literal sense, a reign of
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this national panic there was a degree of
      justification. During the war the labor movement had been
      steadily gaining in momentum and prestige. There had been
      hundreds of strikes, induced chiefly by the rising prices
      of everything that the laboring-man needed in order to
      live, but also by his new consciousness of his power. The
      government, in order to keep up production and maintain
      industrial peace, had encouraged collective bargaining,
      elevated Samuel Gompers to one of the seats of the mighty
      in the war councils at Washington, and given the workers
      some reason to hope that with the coming of peace new
      benefits would be showered upon them. Peace came, and hope
      was deferred. Prices still rose, employers resisted wage
      increases with a new solidarity and continued to insist on
      long hours of work, Woodrow Wilson went off to Europe in
      quest of universal peace and forgot all about the
      laboring-men; and in anger and despair, they took up the
      only weapon ready to their hand--the strike. All over the
      country they struck. There were strikes in the building
      trades, among the longshoremen, the stockyard workers, the
      shipyard men, the subway men, the shoe-workers, the
      carpenters, the telephone operators, and so on <i>ad
      infinitum,</i> until by November, 1919, the total number of
      men and women on strike in the industrial states was
      estimated by Alvin Johnson to be at least a million, with
      enough more in the non-industrial states, or voluntarily
      abstaining from work though not engaged in recognized
      strikes, to bring the grand total to something like two
      million.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were all of these men striking merely for recognition
      of their unions or for increases in pay or shorter
      hours--the traditional causes. Some of them were demanding
      a new industrial order, the displacement of capitalistic
      control of industry (or at least of their own industry) by
      government control: in short, something approaching a
      social régime. The hitherto conservative railroad workers
      came out for the Plumb Plan, by which the government would
      continue to direct the railroads and labor would have a
      voice in the management. When in September, 1919, the
      United Mine Workers voted to strike, they boldly advocated
      the nationalization of the mines; and a delegate who began
      his speech before the crowded convention with the words,
      "Nationalization is impossible," was drowned out by boos
      and jeers and cries of "Coal operator! Throw him out!" In
      the Northwest the I. W. W. was fighting to get the whip
      hand over capital through One Big Union. In North Dakota
      and the adjoining grain states, two hundred thousand
      farmers joined Townley's Non-Partisan League, described by
      its enemies--with some truth--as an agrarian soviet.
      (Townley's candidate for governor of Minnesota in 1916, by
      the way, had been a Swedish-American named Charles A.
      Lindbergh, who would have been amazed to hear that his
      family was destined to be allied by marriage to that of a
      Morgan partner.) There was an unmistakable trend toward
      socialistic ideas both in the ranks of labor and among
      liberal intellectuals. The Socialist party, watching the
      success of the Russian Revolution, was flirting with the
      idea of violent mass-action. And there was, too, a
      rag-tag-and-bobtail collection of communists and
      anarchists, many of them former Socialists, nearly all of
      them foreign-born, most of them Russian, who talked of
      going still further, who took their gospel direct from
      Moscow and, presumably with the aid of Russian funds,
      preached it aggressively among the slum and factory-town
      population.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter group of communists and anarchists constituted
      a very narrow minority of the radical movement--absurdly
      narrow when we consider all the to-do that was made about
      them. Late in 1919 Professor Gordon S. Watkins of the
      University of Illinois, writing in the <i>Atlantic
      Monthly,</i> set the membership of the Socialist party at
      39,000, of the Communist Labor party at from 10,000 to
      30,000, and of the Communist party at from 30,000 to
      60,000. In other words, according to this estimate, the
      Communists could muster at the most hardly more than
      one-tenth of one per cent of the adult population of the
      country; and the three parties together--the majority of
      whose members were probably content to work for their ends
      by lawful means--brought the proportion to hardly more than
      two-tenths of one per cent, a rather slender nucleus, it
      would seem, for a revolutionary mass movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the American businessman was in no mood to consider
      whether it was a slender nucleus or not. He, too, had come
      out of the war with his fighting blood up, ready to lick
      the next thing that stood in his way. He wanted to get back
      to business and enjoy his profits. Labor stood in his way
      and threatened his profits. He had come out of the war with
      a militant patriotism; and mingling his idealistic with his
      selfish motives, after the manner of all men at all times,
      he developed a fervent belief that 100-per-cent Americanism
      and the Welfare of God's Own Country and Loyalty to the
      Teachings of the Founding Fathers implied the right of the
      businessman to kick the union organizer out of his
      workshop. He had come to distrust anything and everything
      that was foreign, and this radicalism he saw as the spawn
      of long-haired Slavs and unwashed East-Side Jews. And,
      finally, he had been nourished during the war years upon
      stories of spies and plotters and international intrigue.
      He had been convinced that German sympathizers signaled to
      one another with lights from mountain-tops and put ground
      glass into surgical dressings, and he had formed the habit
      of expecting tennis courts to conceal gun-emplacements. His
      credulity had thus been stretched until he was quite ready
      to believe that a struggle of American laboring-men for
      better wages was the beginning of an armed rebellion
      directed by Lenin and Trotsky, and that behind every
      innocent professor who taught that there were arguments for
      as well as against socialism there was a bearded rascal
      from eastern Europe with a money bag in one hand and a
      smoking bomb in the other.

      The events of 1919 did much to feed this fear. On the 28th
      of April--while Wilson was negotiating the Peace Treaty at
      Paris, and homecoming troops were parading under Victory
      Arches--an infernal machine "big enough to blow out the
      entire side of the County-City Building" was found in Mayor
      Ole Hanson's mail at Seattle. Mayor Hanson had been
      stumping the country to arouse it to the Red Menace. The
      following afternoon a colored servant opened a package
      addressed to Senator Thomas R. Hardwick at his home in
      Atlanta, Georgia, and a bomb in the package blew off her
      hands. Senator Hardwick, as chairman of the Immigration
      Committee of the Senate, had proposed restricting
      immigration as a means of keeping out Bolshevism.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o'clock the next morning Charles Caplan, a clerk in
      the parcel post division of the New York Post Office, was
      on his way home to Harlem when he read in a newspaper about
      the Hardwick bomb. The package was described in this news
      story as being about six inches long and three inches wide;
      as being done up in brown paper and, like the Hanson bomb,
      marked with the (false, of course) return address of Gimbel
      Brothers in New York. There was something familiar to Mr.
      Caplan about this description. He thought he remembered
      having seen some packages like that. He racked his brain,
      and suddenly it all came back to him. He hurried back to
      the Post Office--and found, neatly laid away on a shelf
      where he had put them because of insufficient postage,
      sixteen little brown-paper packages with the Gimbel return
      address on them. They were addressed to Attorney-General
      Palmer, Postmaster-General Burleson, Judge Landis of
      Chicago, Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court, Secretary of
      Labor Wilson, Commissioner of Immigration Caminetti, J. P.
      Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and a number of other
      government officials and capitalists. The packages were
      examined by the police in a neighboring firehouse, and
      found to contain bombs. Others had started on their way
      through the mails; the total number ultimately accounted
      for reached thirty-six. (None of the other packages were
      carelessly opened, it is hardly necessary to say; for the
      next few days people in high station were very circumspect
      about undoing brown-paper packages.) The list of intended
      recipients was strong evidence that the bombs had been sent
      by an alien radical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly more than a month later there was a series of bomb
      explosions, the most successful of which damaged the front
      of Attorney-General Palmer's house in Washington. It came
      in the evening; Mr. Palmer had just left the library on the
      ground floor and turned out the lights and gone up to bed
      when there was a bang as of something hitting the front
      door, followed by the crash of the explosion. The limbs of
      a man blown to pieces were found outside, and close by,
      according to the newspaper reports, lay a copy of <i>Plain
      Words,</i> a radical publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American public read the big headlines about these
      outrages and savagely resolved to get back at "these
      radicals."
    </p>
    <p>
      How some of them did so may be illustrated by two incidents
      out of dozens which took place during those days. Both of
      them occurred on May Day of 1919--just after Mr. Caplan had
      found the brown-paper packages on the Post Office shelf. On
      the afternoon of May Day the owners and staff of the <i>New
      York Call,</i> a Socialist paper, were holding a reception
      to celebrate the opening of their new office. There were
      hundreds of men, women, and children gathered in the
      building for innocent palaver. A mob of soldiers and
      sailors stormed in and demanded that the "Bolshevist"
      posters be torn down. When the demand was refused, they
      destroyed the literature on the tables, smashed up the
      offices, drove the crowd out into the street, and clubbed
      them so vigorously--standing in a semicircle outside the
      front door and belaboring them as they emerged--that seven
      members of the <i>Call</i> staff went to the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cleveland, on the same day, there was a Socialist parade
      headed by a red flag. An army lieutenant demanded that the
      flag be lowered, and thereupon with a group of soldiers
      leaped into the ranks of the procession and precipitated a
      free-for-all fight. The police came and charged into the
      <i>mêlée</i>--and from that moment a series of riots began
      which spread through the city. Scores of people were
      injured, one man was killed, and the Socialist headquarters
      were utterly demolished by a gang that defended American
      institutions by throwing typewriters and office furniture
      out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer of 1919 passed. The Senate debated the Peace
      Treaty. The House passed the Volstead Act. The Suffrage
      Amendment passed Congress and went to the States. The R-34
      made the first transatlantic dirigible flight from England
      to Mineola, Long Island, and returned safely. People
      laughed over <i>The Young Visiters</i> and wondered whether
      Daisy Ashford was really James M. Barrie. The newspapers
      denounced sugar-hoarders and food profiteers as the cost of
      living kept on climbing. The first funeral by airplane was
      held. Ministers lamented the increasing laxity of morals
      among the young. But still the fear and hatred of
      Bolshevism gripped the American mind as new strikes broke
      out and labor became more aggressive and revolution spread
      like a scourge through Europe. And then, in September, came
      the Boston police strike, and the fear was redoubled.

    <h2>

      The Boston police had a grievance: their pay was based on a
      minimum of $1,100, out of which uniforms had to be bought,
      and $1,100 would buy mighty little at 1919 prices. They
      succumbed to the epidemic of unionism, formed a union, and
      affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. Police
      Commissioner Curtis, a stiff-necked martinet, had forbidden
      them to affiliate with any outside organization, and he
      straightway brought charges against nineteen officers and
      members of the union for having violated his orders, found
      them guilty, and suspended them. The Irish blood of the
      police was heated, and they threatened to strike. A
      committee appointed by the mayor to adjust the dispute
      proposed a compromise, but to Mr. Curtis this looked like
      surrender. He refused to budge. Thereupon, on September 9,
      1919, a large proportion of the police walked out at the
      time of the evening roll call.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the city left defenseless, hoodlums proceeded to enjoy
      themselves. That night they smashed windows and looted
      stores. Mayor Peters called for State troops. The next day
      the Governor called out the State Guard, and a volunteer
      police force began to try to cope with the situation. The
      Guardsmen and volunteer police--ex-servicemen, Harvard
      students, cotton brokers from the Back Bay--were
      inexperienced, and the hoodlums knew it. Guardsmen were
      goaded into firing on a mob in South Boston and killed two
      people. For days there was intermittent violence,
      especially when Guardsmen upheld the majesty of the law by
      breaking up crap games in that garden of sober Puritanism,
      Boston Common. The casualty list grew, and the country
      looked on with dismay as the Central Labor Union,
      representing the organized trade unionists of the city,
      debated holding a general strike on behalf of the
      policemen. Perhaps, people thought, the dreaded revolution
      was beginning here and now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently it began to appear that public opinion in
      Boston, as everywhere else, was overwhelmingly against the
      police and that theirs was a lost cause. The Central Labor
      Union prudently decided not to call a general strike. Mr.
      Curtis discharged the nineteen men whom he had previously
      suspended and began to recruit a new force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Realizing that the game was nearly up, old Samuel Gompers,
      down in Washington, tried to intervene. He wired to the
      Governor of Massachusetts that the action of the Police
      Commissioner was unwarranted and autocratic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor of Massachusetts was an inconspicuous,
      sour-faced man with a reputation for saying as little as
      possible and never jeopardizing his political position by
      being betrayed into a false move. He made the right move
      now. He replied to Gompers that there was "no right to
      strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any
      time"--and overnight he became a national hero. If there
      had been any doubt that the strike was collapsing, it
      vanished when the press of the whole country applauded
      Calvin Coolidge. For many a week to come, amateur
      policemen, pressed into emergency service, would come home
      at night to the water side of Beacon Street to complain
      that directing traffic was even more arduous than a whole
      day of golf at the Country Club; it took time to recruit a
      new force. But recruited it was, and Boston breathed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organized labor, however, was in striking mood. A few days
      later, several hundred thousand steel-workers walked out of
      the mills--after Judge Gary had shown as stiff a neck as
      Commissioner Curtis and had refused to deal with their
      union representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was little radicalism among the steel strikers.
      Their strike was a protest against low wages and long
      hours. A considerable proportion of them worked a
      twelve-hour day, and they had a potentially strong case.
      But the steel magnates had learned something from the
      Boston Police Strike. The public was jumpy and would
      condemn any cause on which the Bolshevist label could be
      pinned. The steel magnates found little difficulty in
      pinning a Bolshevist label on the strikers. William Z.
      Foster, the most energetic and intelligent of the strike
      organizers, had been a syndicalist (and later, although
      even Judge Gary didn't know it then, was to become a
      Communist). Copies of a syndicalist pamphlet by Foster
      appeared in newspaper offices and were seized upon avidly
      to show what a revolutionary fellow he was. Foster was
      trying to substitute unions organized by industries for the
      ineffective craft unions, which were at the mercy of a huge
      concern like the Steel Corporation; therefore, according to
      the newspapers, Foster was a "borer from within" and the
      strike was part of a radical conspiracy. The public was
      sufficiently frightened to prove more interested in
      defeating borers from within than in mitigating the lot of
      obscure Slavs who spent twelve hours a day in the steel
      mills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great steel strike had been in progress only a few
      weeks when a great coal strike impended. In this case
      nobody needed to point out to the public the Red specter
      lurking behind the striking miners. The miners had already
      succeeded in pinning the Bolshevist label on themselves by
      their enthusiastic vote for nationalization; and to the
      undiscriminating newspaper reader, public control of the
      mining industry was all of a piece with communism,
      anarchism, bomb-throwing, and general Red ruin. Here was a
      new threat to the Republic. Something must be done. The
      Government must act.
    </p>
    <p>
      It acted. A. Mitchell Palmer, Attorney-General of the
      United States, who enjoyed being called the "Fighting
      Quaker," saw his shining opportunity and came to the rescue
      of the Constitution.

    <h2>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain grim humor in the fact that what Mr.
      Palmer did during the next three months was done by him as
      the chief legal officer of an Administration which had come
      into power to bring about the New Freedom. Woodrow Wilson
      was ill in the White House, out of touch with affairs, and
      dreaming only of his lamented League: that is the only
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day before the coal strike was due to begin, the
      Attorney-General secured from a Federal Judge in
      Indianapolis an order enjoining the leaders of the strike
      from doing anything whatever to further it. He did this
      under the provisions of a food-and-fuel-control Act which
      forbade restriction of coal production during the war. In
      actual fact the war was not only over, it had been over for
      nearly a year: but legally it was not over--the Peace
      Treaty still languished in the Senate. This
      food-and-fuel-control law, in further actual fact, had been
      passed by the Senate after Senator Husting had explicitly
      declared that he was "authorized by the Secretary of Labor,
      Mr. Wilson, to say that the Administration does not
      construe this bill as prohibiting strikes and peaceful
      picketing and will not so construe it." But Mr. Palmer
      either had never heard of this assurance or cared nothing
      about it or decided that unforeseen conditions had arisen.
      He got his injunction, and the coal strike was doomed,
      although the next day something like four hundred thousand
      coal miners, now leaderless by decree of the Federal
      Government, walked out of the mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public knew nothing of the broken pledge, of course; it
      would have been a bold newspaper proprietor who would have
      published Senator Husting's statement, even had he known
      about it. It took genuine courage for a paper even to say,
      as did the <i>New York World</i> at that time, that there
      was "no Bolshevist menace in the United States and no I. W.
      W. menace that an ordinarily capable police force is not
      competent to deal with." The press applauded the injunction
      as it had applauded Calvin Coolidge. The Fighting Quaker
      took heart. His next move was to direct a series of raids
      in which Communist leaders were rounded up for deportation
      to Russia, <i>via</i> Finland, on the ship <i>Buford,</i>
      jocosely known as the "Soviet Ark." Again there was
      enthusiasm--and apparently there was little concern over
      the right of the Administration to tear from their families
      men who had as yet committed no crime. Mr. Palmer decided
      to give the American public more of the same; and thereupon
      he carried through a new series of raids which set a new
      record in American history for executive transgression of
      individual constitutional rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the drastic war-time Sedition Act, the Secretary of
      Labor had the power to deport aliens who were anarchists,
      or believed in or advocated the overthrow of the government
      by violence, or were affiliated with any organization that
      so believed or advocated. Mr. Palmer now decided to
      "cooperate" with the Secretary of Labor by rounding up the
      alien membership of the Communist party for wholesale
      deportation. His under-cover agents had already worked
      their way into the organization; one of them, indeed, was
      said to have become a leader in his district (which raised
      the philosophical question whether government agents in
      such positions would have imperiled their jobs by
      counseling moderation among the comrades).
    </p>
    <p>
      In scores of cities all over the United States, when the
      Communists were simultaneously meeting at their various
      headquarters on New Year's Day of 1920, Mr. Palmer's agents
      and police and voluntary aides fell upon them--fell upon
      everybody, in fact, who was in the hall, regardless of
      whether he was a Communist or not (how could one
      tell?)--and bundled them off to jail, with or without
      warrant. Every conceivable bit of evidence--literature,
      membership lists, books, papers, pictures on the wall,
      everything--was seized, with or without a search warrant.
      On this and succeeding nights other Communists and
      suspected Communists were seized in their homes. Over six
      thousand men were arrested in all, and thrust summarily
      behind the bars for days or weeks--often without any chance
      to learn what was the explicit charge against them. At
      least one American citizen, not a Communist, was jailed for
      days through some mistake--probably a confusion of
      names--and barely escaped deportation. In Detroit, over a
      hundred men were herded into a bullpen measuring
      twenty-four by thirty feet and kept there for a week under
      conditions which the mayor of the city called intolerable.
      In Hartford, while the suspects were in jail the
      authorities took the further precaution of arresting and
      incarcerating all visitors who came to see them, a friendly
      call being regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of
      affiliation with the Communist party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately a considerable proportion of the prisoners were
      released for want of sufficient evidence that they were
      Communists. Ultimately, too, it was divulged that in the
      whole country-wide raid upon these dangerous
      men--supposedly armed to the teeth--exactly three pistols
      were found, and no explosives at all. But at the time the
      newspapers were full of reports from Mr. Palmer's office
      that new evidence of a gigantic plot against the safety of
      the country had been unearthed; and although the steel
      strike was failing, the coal strike was failing, and any
      danger of a socialistic régime, to say nothing of a
      revolution, was daily fading, nevertheless to the great
      mass of the American people the Bolshevist bogey became
      more terrifying than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer was in full cry. In public statements he was
      reminding the twenty million owners of Liberty bonds and
      the nine million farm-owners and the eleven million owners
      of savings accounts that the Reds proposed to take away all
      they had. He was distributing boiler-plate propaganda to
      the press, containing pictures of horrid-looking Bolsheviks
      with bristling beards, and asking if such as these should
      rule over America. Politicians were quoting the suggestion
      of Guy Empey that the proper implements for dealing with
      the Reds could be "found in any hardware store," or
      proclaiming, "My motto for the Reds is S. O. S.--ship or
      shoot. I believe we should place them all on a ship of
      stone, with sails of lead, and that their first
      stopping-place should be hell." College graduates were
      calling for the dismissal of professors suspected of
      radicalism; schoolteachers were being made to sign oaths of
      allegiance; businessmen with unorthodox political or
      economic ideas were learning to hold their tongues if they
      wanted to hold their jobs. Hysteria had reached its height.

      Nor did it quickly subside. For the professional
      super-patriot (and assorted special propagandists disguised
      as super-patriots) had only begun to fight. Innumerable
      patriotic societies had sprung up, each with its executive
      secretary, and executive secretaries must live, and
      therefore must conjure up new and ever greater menaces.
      Innumerable other gentlemen now discovered that they could
      defeat whatever they wanted to defeat by tarring it
      conspicuously with the Bolshevist brush. Big-navy men,
      believers in compulsory military service, drys,
      anti-cigarette campaigners, anti-evolution Fundamentalists,
      defenders of the moral order, book censors, Jew-haters,
      Negro-haters, landlords, manufacturers, utility executives,
      upholders of every sort of cause, good, bad, and
      indifferent, all wrapped themselves in Old Glory and the
      mantle of the Founding Fathers and allied their opponents
      with Lenin. The open shop, for example, became the
      "American plan." For years a pestilence of speakers and
      writers continued to afflict the country with tales of
      "sinister and subversive agitators." Elderly ladies in gilt
      chairs in ornate drawing-rooms heard from executive
      secretaries that the agents of the government had unearthed
      new radical conspiracies too fiendish to be divulged before
      the proper time. Their husbands were told at luncheon clubs
      that the colleges were honeycombed with Bolshevism. A cloud
      of suspicion hung in the air, and intolerance became an
      American virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      William J. Burns put the number of resident Communists at
      422,000, and S. Stanwood Menken of the National Security
      League made it 600,000--figures at least ten times as large
      as those of Professor Watkins. Dwight Braman, president of
      the Allied Patriotic Societies, told Governor Smith of New
      York that the Reds were holding 10,000 meetings in the
      country every week and that 350 radical newspapers had been
      established in the preceding six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not only the Communists were dangerous; they had, it
      seemed, well-disguised or unwitting allies in more
      respectable circles. The Russian Famine Fund Committee,
      according to Ralph Easley of the National Civic Federation,
      included sixty pronounced Bolshevist sympathizers.
      Frederick J. Libby of the National Council for the
      Reduction of Armaments was said by one of the loudest of
      the super-patriots to be a Communist educated in Russia who
      visited Russia for instructions (although as a matter of
      fact the pacifist churchman had never been in Russia, had
      no affiliations with Russia, and had on his board only
      American citizens). <i>The Nation, The New Republic,</i>
      and <i>The Freeman</i> were classed as "revolutionary" by
      the executive secretary of the American Defense Society.
      Even <i>The Survey</i> was denounced by the writers of the
      Lusk Report as having "the endorsement of revolutionary
      groups." Ralph Easley pointed with alarm to the National
      League of Women Voters, the Federal Council of Churches,
      and the Foreign Policy Association. There was hardly a
      liberal civic organization in the land at which these
      protectors of the nation did not bid the citizenry to
      shudder. Even the National Information Bureau, which
      investigated charities and was headed by no less a pillar
      of New York respectability than Robert W. DeForest, fell
      under suspicion. Mr. DeForest, it was claimed, must be too
      busy to pay attention to what was going on; for along with
      him were people like Rabbi Wise and Norman Thomas and
      Oswald Villard and Jane Addams and Scott Nearing and Paul
      U. Kellogg, many of whom were tainted by radical
      associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was danger lurking in the theater and the movies. The
      Moscow Art Theater, the Chauve Souris, and Fyodor Chaliapin
      were viewed by Mr. Braman of the Allied Patriotic Societies
      as propagandizing agencies of the Soviets; and according to
      Mr. Whitney of the American Defense Society, not only Norma
      Talmadge but--yes--Charlie Chaplin and Will Rogers were
      mentioned in "Communist files."
    </p>
    <p>
      Books, too, must be carefully scanned for the all-pervasive
      evil. Miss Hermine Schwed, speaking for the Better America
      Federation, a band of California patriots, disapproved of
      <i>Main Street</i> because it "created a distaste for the
      conventional good life of the American," and called John
      Dewey and James Harvey Robinson "most dangerous to young
      people." And as for the schools and colleges, here the
      danger was more insidious and far-reaching still. According
      to Mr. Whitney, Professors Felix Frankfurter and Zacharia
      Chafee <i>(sic)</i> of Harvard and Frederick Wells Williams
      and Max Solomon Mandell of Yale were "too wise not to know
      that their words, publicly uttered and even used in
      classrooms, are, to put it conservatively, decidedly
      encouraging to the Communists." The schools must be firmly
      taken in hand: textbooks must be combed for slights to
      heroes of American history, none but conservative speakers
      must be allowed within the precincts of school or college,
      and courses teaching reverence for the Constitution must be
      universal and compulsory.

      The effect of these admonitions was oppressive. The fear of
      the radicals was accompanied and followed by a fear of
      being thought radical. If you wanted to get on in business,
      to be received in the best circles of Gopher Prairie or
      Middletown, you must appear to conform. Any deviation from
      the opinions of Judge Gary and Mr. Palmer was viewed
      askance. A liberal journalist, visiting a formerly
      outspoken Hoosier in his office, was not permitted to talk
      politics until his frightened host had closed and locked
      the door and closed the window (which gave on an airshaft
      perhaps fifty feet wide, with offices on the other side
      where there might be ears to hear the words of heresy).
      Said a former resident of a Middle Western city, returning
      to it after a long absence: "These people are all afraid of
      something. What is it?" The authors of <i>Middletown</i>
      quoted a lonely political dissenter forced into conformity
      by the iron pressure of public opinion as saying, bitterly,
      "I just run away from it all to my books." He dared not
      utter his economic opinions openly; to deviate ever so
      little from those of the Legion and the Rotary Club would
      be to brand himself as a Bolshevist.

    <p>
      "America," wrote Katharine Fullerton Gerould in <i>Harper's
      Magazine</i> as late as 1922, "is no longer a free country,
      in the old sense; and liberty is, increasingly, a mere
      rhetorical figure. . . . No thinking citizen, I venture to
      say, can express in freedom more than a part of his honest
      convictions. I do not of course refer to convictions that
      are frankly criminal. I do mean that everywhere, on every
      hand, free speech is choked off in one direction or
      another. The only way in which an American citizen who is
      really interested in all the social and political problems
      of his country can preserve any freedom of expression, is
      to choose the mob that is most sympathetic to him, and
      abide under the shadow of that mob."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentiments such as these were expressed so frequently and
      so vehemently in later years that it is astonishing to
      recall that in 1922 it required some temerity to put them
      in print. When Mrs. Gerould's article was published,
      hundreds of letters poured into the <i>Harper's</i> office
      and into her house--letters denouncing her in scurrilous
      terms as subversive and a Bolshevist, letters rejoicing
      that at last someone had stood up and told the truth. To
      such a point had the country been carried by the shoutings
      of the super-patriots.

      The intolerance of those days took many forms. Almost
      inevitably it took the form of an ugly flare-up of feeling
      against the Negro, the Jew, and the Roman Catholic. The
      emotions of group loyalty and of hatred, expanded during
      war-time and then suddenly denied their intended
      expression, found a perverted release in the persecution
      not only of supposed radicals, but also of other elements
      which to the dominant American group--the white
      Protestants--seemed alien or "un-American."

      Negroes had migrated during the war by the hundreds of
      thousands into the industrial North, drawn thither by high
      wages and by the openings in mill and factory occasioned by
      the draft. Wherever their numbers increased they had no
      choice but to move into districts previously reserved for
      the whites, there to jostle with the whites in street cars
      and public places, and in a hundred other ways to upset the
      delicate equilibrium of racial adjustment. In the South as
      well as in the North the Negroes had felt the stirrings of
      a new sense of independence; had they not been called to
      the colors just as the whites had been, and had they not
      been fighting for democracy and oppressed minorities? When
      peace came, and they found they were to be put in their
      place once more, some of them showed their resentment; and
      in the uneasy atmosphere of the day this was enough to
      kindle the violent racial passions which smoulder under the
      surface of human nature. Bolshevism was bad enough, thought
      the whites, but if the niggers ever got beyond control . .

    <p>
      One sultry afternoon in the summer of 1919 a
      seventeen-year-old colored boy was swimming in Lake
      Michigan by a Chicago bathing-beach. Part of the shore had
      been set aside by mutual understanding for the use of the
      whites, another part for the Negroes. The boy took hold of
      a railroad tie floating in the water and drifted across the
      invisible line. Stones were thrown at him; a white boy
      started to swim toward him. The colored boy let go of the
      railroad tie, swam a few strokes, and sank. He was drowned.
      Whether he had been hit by any of the stones was uncertain,
      but the Negroes on the shore accused the whites of stoning
      him to death, and a fight began. This small incident struck
      the match that set off a bonfire of race hatred. The Negro
      population of Chicago had doubled in a decade, the blacks
      had crowded into white neighborhoods, and nerves were raw.
      The disorder spread to other parts of the city--and the
      final result was that for nearly a week Chicago was
      virtually in a state of civil war; there were mobbings of
      Negroes, beatings, stabbings, gang raids through the Negro
      district, shootings by Negroes in defense, and wanton
      destruction of houses and property; when order was finally
      restored it was found that fifteen whites and twenty-three
      Negroes had been killed, five hundred and thirty-seven
      people had been injured, and a thousand had been left
      homeless and destitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than a year later there was another riot of major
      proportions in Tulsa. Wherever the colored population had
      spread, there was a new tension in the relations between
      the races. It was not alleviated by the gospel of white
      supremacy preached by speakers and writers such as Lothrop
      Stoddard, whose <i>Rising Tide of Color</i> proclaimed that
      the dark-skinned races constituted a worse threat to
      Western civilization than the Germans or the Bolsheviks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews, too, fell under the suspicion of a majority bent
      upon an undiluted Americanism. Here was a group of
      inevitably divided loyalty, many of whose members were
      undeniably prominent among the Bolsheviki in Russia and
      among the radical immigrants in America. Henry Ford
      discovered the menace of the "International Jew," and his
      <i>Dearborn Independent</i> accused the unhappy race of
      plotting the subjugation of the whole world and (for good
      measure) of being the source of almost every American
      affliction, including high rents, the shortage of farm
      labor, jazz, gambling, drunkenness, loose morals, and even
      short skirts. The Ford attack, absurd as it was, was merely
      an exaggerated manifestation of a widespread anti-Semitism.
      Prejudice became as pervasive as the air. Landlords grew
      less disposed to rent to Jewish tenants, and schools to
      admit Jewish boys and girls; there was a public scandal at
      Annapolis over the hazing of a Jewish boy; Harvard College
      seriously debated limiting the number of Jewish students;
      and all over the country Jews felt that a barrier had
      fallen between them and the Gentiles. Nor did the Roman
      Catholics escape censure in the regions in which they were
      in a minority. Did not the members of this Church take
      their orders from a foreign pope, and did not the pope
      claim temporal power, and did not Catholics insist upon
      teaching their children in their own way rather than in the
      American public schools, and was not all this un-American
      and treasonable?

    <p>
      It was in such an atmosphere that the Ku Klux Klan
      blossomed into power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Klan had been founded as far back as 1915 by a Georgian
      named Colonel William Joseph Simmons, but its first five
      years had been lean. When 1920 arrived, Colonel Simmons had
      only a few hundred members in his amiable patriotic and
      fraternal order, which drew its inspiration from the Ku
      Klux Klan of Reconstruction days and stood for white
      supremacy and sentimental Southern idealism in general. But
      in 1920 Simmons put the task of organizing the Order into
      the hands of one Edward Y. Clarke of the Southern Publicity
      Association. Clarke's gifts of salesmanship, hitherto
      expended on such blameless causes as the Roosevelt Memorial
      Association and the Near East Relief, were prodigious. The
      time was ripe for the Klan, and he knew it. Not only could
      it be represented to potential members as the defender of
      the white against the black, of Gentile against Jew, and of
      Protestant against Catholic, and thus trade on all the
      newly inflamed fears of the credulous small-towner, but its
      white robe and hood, its flaming cross, its secrecy, and
      the preposterous vocabulary of its ritual could be made the
      vehicle for all that infantile love of hocus-pocus and
      mummery, that lust for secret adventure, which survives in
      the adult whose lot is cast in drab places. Here was a
      chance to dress up the village bigot and let him be a
      Knight of the Invisible Empire. The formula was perfect.
      And there was another inviting fact to be borne in mind.
      Well organized, such an Order could be made a paying
      proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salesmen of memberships were given the entrancing title
      of Kleagles; the country was divided into Realms headed by
      King Kleagles, and the Realms into Domains headed by Grand
      Goblins; Clarke himself, as chief organizer, became
      Imperial Kleagle, and the art of nomenclature reached its
      fantastic pinnacle in the title bestowed upon Colonel
      Simmons: he became the Imperial Wizard. A membership cost
      ten dollars; and as four of this went into the pocket of
      the Kleagle who made the sale, it was soon apparent that a
      diligent Kleagle need not fear the wolf at the door.
      Kleagling became one of the profitable industries of the
      decade. The King Kleagle of the Realm and Grand Goblin of
      the Domain took a small rake-off from the remaining six
      dollars of the membership fee, and the balance poured into
      the Imperial Treasury at Atlanta.

      An inconvenient congressional investigation in
      1921--brought about largely by sundry reports of tarrings
      and featherings and floggings, and by the disclosure of
      many of the Klan's secrets by the <i>New York
      World</i>--led ultimately to the banishment of Imperial
      Kleagle Clarke, and Colonel Simmons was succeeded as
      Imperial Wizard by a Texas dentist named Hiram Wesley
      Evans, who referred to himself, perhaps with some justice,
      as "the most average man in America"; but a humming sales
      organization had been built up and the Klan continued to
      grow. It grew, in fact, with such inordinate rapidity that
      early in 1924 its membership had reached--according to the
      careful estimates of Stanley Frost--the staggering figure
      of nearly four and a half million. It came to wield great
      political power, dominating for a time the seven states of
      Oregon, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Indiana, Ohio, and
      California. Its chief strongholds were the New South, the
      Middle West, and the Pacific coast, but it had invaded
      almost every part of the country and had even reached the
      gates of that stronghold of Jewry, Catholicism, and
      sophistication, New York City. So far had Clarke's genius
      and the hospitable temper of the times carried it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objects of the Order as stated in its Constitution were
      "to unite white male persons, native-born Gentile citizens
      of the United States of America, who owe no allegiance of
      any nature to any foreign government, nation, institution,
      sect, ruler, person, or people; whose morals are good,
      whose reputations and vocations are exemplary . . . to
      cultivate and promote patriotism toward our Civil
      Government; to practice an honorable Klanishness toward
      each other; to exemplify a practical benevolence; to shield
      the sanctity of the home and the chastity of womanhood; to
      maintain forever white supremacy, to reach and faithfully
      inculcate a high spiritual philosophy through an exalted
      ritualism, and by a practical devotion to conserve,
      protect, and maintain the distinctive institutions, rights,
      privileges, principles, traditions and ideals of a pure
      Americanism."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the theory. In practice the "pure Americanism" varied
      with the locality. At first, in the South, white supremacy
      was the Klan's chief objective, but as time went on and the
      organization grew and spread, opposition to the Jew and
      above all to the Catholic proved the best talking point for
      Kleagles in most localities. Nor did the methods of the
      local Klan organizations usually suggest the possession of
      a "high spiritual philosophy." These local organizations
      were largely autonomous and beyond control from Atlanta.
      They were drawn, as a rule, mostly from the less educated
      and less disciplined elements of the white Protestant
      community. ("You think the influential men belong here?"
      commented an outspoken observer in an Indiana city. "Then
      look at their shoes when they march in parade. The sheet
      doesn't cover the shoes.") Though Imperial Wizard Evans
      inveighed against lawlessness, the members of the local
      Klans were not always content with voting against allowing
      children to attend parochial schools, or voting against
      Catholic candidates for office, or burning fiery crosses on
      the hilltop back of the town to show the niggers that the
      whites meant business. The secrecy of the Klan was an
      invitation to more direct action.

      If a white girl reported that a colored man had made
      improper advances to her--even if the charge were
      unsupported and based on nothing more than a neurotic
      imagination--a white-sheeted band might spirit the Negro
      off to the woods and "teach him a lesson" with tar and
      feathers or with the whip. If a white man stood up for a
      Negro in a race quarrel, he might be kidnapped and beaten
      up. If a colored woman refused to sell her land at an
      arbitrary price which she considered too low, and a
      Klansman wanted the land, she might receive the K. K. K.
      ultimatum--sell or be thrown out. Klan members would
      boycott Jewish merchants, refuse to hire Catholic boys,
      refuse to rent their houses to Catholics. A hideous tragedy
      in Louisiana, where five men were kidnapped and later found
      bound with wire and drowned in a lake, was laid to
      Klansmen. R. A. Patton, writing in <i>Current History,</i>
      reported a grim series of brutalities from Alabama: "A lad
      whipped with branches until his back was ribboned flesh; a
      Negress beaten and left helpless to contract pneumonia from
      exposure and die; a white girl, divorcée, beaten into
      unconsciousness in her own home; a naturalized foreigner
      flogged until his back was a pulp because he married an
      American woman; a Negro lashed until he sold his land to a
      white man for a fraction of its value."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even where there were no such outrages, there was at least
      the threat of them. The white-robed army paraded, the
      burning cross glowed across the valley, people whispered to
      one another in the darkness and wondered "who they were
      after this time," and fear and suspicion ran from house to
      house. Furthermore, criminals and gangs of hoodlums quickly
      learned to take advantage of the Klan's existence: if they
      wanted to burn someone's barn or raid the slums beyond the
      railroad tracks, they could do it with impunity now: would
      not the Klan be held responsible? Anyone could chalk the
      letters K. K. K. on a fence and be sure that the sheriff
      would move warily. Thus, as in the case of the Red
      hysteria, a movement conceived in fear perpetuated fear and
      brought with it all manner of cruelties and crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, as the years passed and the war-time emotions
      ebbed, the power of the Klan waned, until in many districts
      it was dead and in others it had become merely a political
      faction dominated by spoilsmen: but not until it had become
      a thing of terror to millions of men and women.

      After the Palmer raids at the beginning of 1920 the hunt
      for radicals went on. In April the five Socialist members
      of the New York State Assembly were expelled on the ground
      that (as the report of the Judiciary Committee put it) they
      were members of "a disloyal organization composed
      exclusively of perpetual traitors." When Young Theodore
      Roosevelt spoke against the motion to expel, he was
      solemnly rebuked by Speaker Sweet, who mounted the rostrum
      and read aloud passages from the writings of T. R. senior,
      in order that the Americanism of the father might be
      painfully contrasted with the un-Americanism of the son.
      When Assemblyman Cuvillier, in the midst of a speech, spied
      two of the Socialist members actually occupying the seats
      to which they had been elected, he cried: "These two men
      who sit there with a smile and a smirk on their faces are
      just as much representatives of the Russian Soviet
      Government as if they were Lenin and Trotsky themselves.
      They are little Lenins, little Trotskys in our midst." The
      little Lenins and Trotskys were thrown out by an
      overwhelming vote, and the <i>New York Times</i> announced
      the next day that "It was an American vote altogether, a
      patriotic and conservative vote. An immense majority of the
      American people will approve and sanction the Assembly's
      action." That statement, coming from the discreet
      <i>Times,</i> is a measure of the temper of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the tide was almost ready to turn. Charles
      Evans Hughes protested against the Assembly's action,
      thereby almost causing apoplexy among some of his sedate
      fellow-members of the Union League Club, who wondered if
      such a good Republican could be becoming a parlor pink. May
      Day of 1920 arrived in due course, and although Mr. Palmer
      dutifully informed the world in advance that May Day had
      been selected by the radicals as the date for a general
      strike and for assassinations, nothing happened. The
      police, fully mobilized, waited for a revolutionary
      onslaught that never arrived. The political conventions
      rolled round, and although Calvin Coolidge was swept into
      the Republican nomination for Vice-President on his record
      as the man who broke the Boston police strike, it was
      noteworthy that the Democratic Convention did not sweep the
      Fighting Quaker into anything at all, and that there was a
      certain unseemly levity among his opponents, who insisted
      upon referring to him as the quaking fighter, the faking
      fighter, and the quaking quitter. It began to look as if
      the country were beginning to regain its sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strikes and riots and legislative enactments and judicial
      rulings against radicals continued, but with the coming of
      the summer of 1920 there were at least other things to
      compete for the attention of the country. There was the
      presidential campaign; the affable Mr. Harding was mouthing
      orotund generalizations from his front porch, and the
      desperate Mr. Cox was steaming about the country, trying to
      pull Woodrow Wilson's chestnuts out of the fire. There was
      the ticklish business situation: people had been revolting
      against high prices for months, and overall parades had
      been held, and the Rev. George M. Elsbree of Philadelphia
      had preached a sermon in overalls, and there had been an
      overall wedding in New York (parson, bride, and groom all
      photographed for the rotogravure section in overalls), and
      the department stores had been driven to reduce prices, and
      now it was apparent that business was riding for a fall,
      strikes or no strikes, radicals or no radicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the hue and cry over the discovery of the bogus
      get-rich-quick schemes of Charles Ponzi of Boston. There
      was Woman Suffrage, now at last a fact, with ratification
      of the Amendment by the States completed on August 18th.
      Finally, there was Prohibition, also at last a fact, and an
      absorbing topic at dinner tables. In those days people sat
      with bated breath to hear how So-and-so had made very good
      gin right in his own cellar, and just what formula would
      fulfill the higher destiny of raisins, and how bootleggers
      brought liquor down from Canada. It was all new and
      exciting. That the Big Red Scare was already perceptibly
      abating by the end of the summer of 1920 was shown by the
      fact that the nation managed to keep its head surprisingly
      well when a real disaster, probably attributable to an
      anarchist gang, took place on the 16th of September.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was one geographical spot in the United States
      that could justly be called the financial center of the
      country, it was the junction of Broad and Wall Streets in
      New York. Here, on the north side of Wall Street, stood the
      Sub-Treasury Building, and next to it the United States
      Assay Office; opposite them, on the southeast corner, an
      ostentatiously unostentatious three-story limestone
      building housed the firm of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, the
      most powerful nexus of capitalism in the world; on the
      southwest corner yawned the excavation where the New York
      Stock Exchange was presently to build its annex, and next
      to this, on Broad Street, rose the Corinthian pillars of
      the Exchange itself. Government finance, private finance,
      the passage of private control of industry from
      capitalistic hand to hand: here stood their respective
      citadels cheek by jowl, as if to symbolize the union into
      one system of the government and the money power and the
      direction of business--that system which the radicals so
      bitterly decried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at this precise spot, a moment before noon on
      September 16th, just as the clerks of the neighborhood were
      getting ready to go out for luncheon, there was a sudden
      blinding flash of bluish-white light and a terrific
      crashing roar, followed by the clatter of falling glass
      from innumerable windows and by the screams of men and
      women. A huge bomb had gone off in the street in front of
      the Assay Office and directly opposite the House of
      Morgan--gone off with such appalling violence that it
      killed thirty people outright and injured hundreds, wrecked
      the interior of the Morgan offices, smashed windows for
      blocks around, and drove an iron slug through the window of
      the Bankers' Club on the thirty-fourth floor of the
      Equitable Building.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great mushroom-shaped cloud of yellowish-green smoke rose
      slowly into the upper air between the skyscrapers. Below
      it, the air was filled with dust pouring out of the Morgan
      windows and the windows of other buildings--dust from
      shrapnel-bitten plaster walls. And below that, the street
      ran red with the blood of the dead and dying. Those who by
      blind chance had escaped the hail of steel picked
      themselves up and ran in terror as glass and fragments of
      stone showered down from the buildings above; then there
      was a surge of people back to the horror again, a vast
      crowd milling about and trying to help the victims and not
      knowing what to do first and bumping into one another and
      shouting; then fire engines and ambulances clanged to the
      scene and police and hospital orderlies fought their way
      through the mob and brought it at last to order.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the House of Morgan, one man had been killed, the chief
      clerk; dozens were hurt, seventeen had to be taken to
      hospitals. But only one partner had been cut in the hand by
      flying glass; the rest were in conference on the other side
      of the building or out of town. Mr. Morgan was abroad. The
      victims of the explosion were not the financial powers of
      the country, but bank clerks, brokers' men, Wall Street
      runners, stenographers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Stock Exchange, hardly two hundred feet away,
      trading had been proceeding at what in those days was
      considered "good volume"--at the rate of half a million
      shares or so for the day. Prices had been rising. Reading
      was being bid up 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> points to 93
      <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, Baldwin Locomotive was going
      strong at 110 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, there was heavy
      trading in Middle States Oil, Steel was doing well at 89
      <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>. The crash came, the building
      shook, and the big windows smashed down in a shower of
      glass; those on the Broad Street side had their heavy silk
      curtains drawn, or dozens of men would have been injured.
      For a moment the brokers, not knowing what had happened,
      scampered for anything that looked like shelter. Those in
      the middle of the floor, where an instant before the
      largest crowd of traders had been gathered around the
      Reading post, made for the edges of the room lest the dome
      should fall. But William H. Remick, president of the
      Exchange, who had been standing with the "money crowd" at
      the side of the room, kept his head. Remarking to a friend,
      "I guess it's about time to ring the gong," he mounted the
      rostrum, rang the gong, and thereby immediately ended
      trading for the day. (The next day prices continued to rise
      as if nothing had happened.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the middle of Wall Street lay the carcass of a horse
      blown to pieces by the force of the explosion, and here and
      there were assembled bits of steel and wood and canvas
      which, with the horse's shoes and the harness, enabled the
      police to decide that a TNT bomb had gone off in a
      horse-drawn wagon, presumably left unattended as its driver
      escaped from the scene. For days and months and years
      detectives and Federal agents followed up every possible
      clue. Every wagon in the city, to say nothing of powder
      wagons, was traced. The slugs which had imbedded themselves
      in the surrounding buildings were examined and found to be
      window sash-weights cut in two--but this, despite endless
      further investigation, led to nothing more than the
      conclusion that the explosion was a premeditated crime. The
      horse's shoes were identified and a man was found who had
      put them on the horse a few days before; he described the
      driver as a Sicilian, but the clue led no further. Bits of
      steel and tin found in the neighborhood were studied,
      manufacturers consulted, records of sale run through. One
      fragment of iron proved to be the knob of a safe, and the
      safe was identified; a detective followed the history of
      the safe from its manufacture through various hands until
      it went to France with the Army during the war and returned
      to Hoboken--but there its trail was lost. Every
      eye-witness's story was tested and analyzed. Reports of
      warnings of disaster received by businessmen were run down
      but yielded nothing of real value. Suspected radicals were
      rounded up without result. One bit of evidence remained,
      but how important it was one could not be sure. At almost
      the exact minute of the explosion, a letter-carrier was
      said to have found in a post-box two or three blocks from
      the scene--a box which had been emptied only half an hour
      before--five sheets of paper on which was crudely printed,
      with varying misspellings,
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
            Rememer<br>
      We will not tolerate<br>
      any longer<br>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A prominent coal operator who was sitting in the Morgan
      offices when the explosion took place promptly declared
      that there was no question in his mind that it was the work
      of Bolshevists. After years of fruitless investigation,
      there was still a question in the minds of those who tried
      to solve the mystery. But in the loose sense in which the
      coal operator used the term, he was probably right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country followed the early stages of the investigation
      with absorbed interest. Yet no marked increase in
      anti-Bolshevist riots took place. If the explosion had
      occurred a few months earlier, it might have had indirect
      consequences as ugly as the damage which it did directly.
      But by this time the American people were coming to their
      senses sufficiently to realize that no such insane and
      frightful plot could ever command the support of more than
      a handful of fanatics.

      The Big Red Scare was slowly--very slowly--dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      What killed it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The realization, for one thing, that there had never been
      any sufficient cause for such a panic as had convulsed the
      country. The localization of Communism in Europe, for
      another thing: when Germany and other European nations
      failed to be engulfed by the Bolshevist tide, the idea of
      its sweeping irresistibly across the Atlantic became a
      little less plausible. It was a fact, too, that radicalism
      was noticeably ebbing in the United States. The Fighting
      Quaker's inquisitorial methods, whatever one may think of
      them, had at least had the practical effect of scaring many
      Reds into a pale pinkness. By 1921 the A. F. of L. leaders
      were leaning over backward in their effort to appear as
      conservative as Judge Gary, college professors were
      canceling their subscriptions to liberal magazines on the
      ground that they could not afford to let such literature be
      seen on their tables, and the social reformers of a year or
      two before were tiring of what seemed a thankless and
      hopeless fight. There was also, perhaps, a perceptible loss
      of enthusiasm for governmental action against the Reds on
      the part of the growing company of the wets, who were
      acquiring a belated concern for personal liberty and a new
      distrust of federal snoopers. Yet there was another cause
      more important, perhaps, than any of these. The temper of
      the aftermath of war was at last giving way to the temper
      of peace. Like an overworked businessman beginning his
      vacation, the country had had to go through a period of
      restlessness and irritability, but was finally learning how
      to relax and amuse itself once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of disillusionment remained; like the suddenly
      liberated vacationist, the country felt that it ought to be
      enjoying itself more than it was, and that life was futile
      and nothing mattered much. But in the meantime it might as
      well play--follow the crowd, take up the new toys that were
      amusing the crowd, go in for the new fads, savor the
      amusing scandals and trivialities of life. By 1921 the new
      toys and fads and scandals were forthcoming, and the
      country seized upon them feverishly.

      First of all was the radio, which was destined ultimately
      to alter the daily habits of Americans as profoundly as
      anything that the decade produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first broadcasting station had been opened in East
      Pittsburgh on November 2, 1920--a date which school
      children may some day have to learn--to carry the
      Harding-Cox election returns. This was station KDKA,
      operated by the Westinghouse Company. For a time, however,
      this new revolution in communication and public
      entertainment made slow headway. Auditors were few. Amateur
      wireless operators objected to the stream of music--mostly
      from phonograph records--which issued from the Westinghouse
      station and interfered with their important business. When
      a real orchestra was substituted for the records, the
      resonance of the room in which the players sat spoiled the
      effect. The orchestra was placed out-of-doors, in a tent on
      the roof--and the tent blew away. The tent was thereupon
      pitched in a big room indoors, and not until then was it
      discovered that the cloth hangings which subsequently
      became standard in broadcasting studios would adequately
      muffle the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiment proceeded, however; other radio stations were
      opened, market reports were thrown on the air, Dr. Van
      Etten of Pittsburgh permitted the services at Calvary
      Church to be broadcasted, the University of Wisconsin gave
      radio concerts, and politicians spouted into the strange
      instruments and wondered if anybody was really listening.
      Yet when Dempsey fought Carpentier in July, 1921, and three
      men at the ringside told the story of the slaughter into
      telephone transmitters to be relayed by air to eighty
      points throughout the country, their enterprise was
      reported in an obscure corner of the <i>New York Times</i>
      as an achievement in "wireless telephony"; and when the
      Unknown Soldier was buried at Arlington Cemetery the
      following November, crowds packed into Madison Square
      Garden in New York and the Auditorium in San Francisco to
      hear the speeches issue from huge amplifiers, and few in
      those crowds had any idea that soon they could hear all the
      orations they wanted without stirring from the easy-chair
      in the living-room. The great awakening had not yet come.
    </p>
    <p>
      That winter, however--the winter of 1921-22--it came with a
      rush. Soon everybody was talking, not about wireless
      telephony, but about radio. A San Francisco paper described
      the discovery that millions were making: "There is radio
      music in the air, every night, everywhere. Anybody can hear
      it at home on a receiving set, which any boy can put up in
      an hour." In February President Harding had an outfit
      installed in his study, and the Dixmoor Golf Club announced
      that it would install a "telephone" to enable golfers to
      hear church services. In April, passengers on a Lackawanna
      train heard a radio concert, and Lieutenant Maynard broke
      all records for modernizing Christianity by broadcasting an
      Easter sermon from an airplane. Newspapers brought out
      radio sections and thousands of hitherto utterly
      unmechanical people puzzled over articles about
      regenerative circuits, sodion tubes, Grimes reflex
      circuits, crystal detectors, and neutrodynes. In the
      Ziegfeld "Follies of 1922" the popularity of "My Rambler
      Rose" was rivaled by that of a song about a man who hoped
      his love might hear him as she was "listening on the
      radio." And every other man you met on the street
      buttonholed you to tell you how he had sat up until two
      o'clock the night before, with earphones clamped to his
      head, and had actually <i>heard Havana!</i> How could one
      bother about the Red Menace if one was facing such
      momentous questions as how to construct a loop aërial?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature</i> for
      the years 1919-21, in which were listed all the magazine
      articles appearing during those years, there were two
      columns of references to articles on Radicals and
      Radicalism and less than a quarter of a column of
      references to articles on Radio. In the <i>Readers'
      Guide</i> for 1922-24, by contrast, the section on Radicals
      and Radicalism shrank to half a column and the section on
      Radio swelled to nineteen columns. In that change there is
      an index to something more than periodical literature.

      Sport, too, had become an American obsession. When Jack
      Kearns persuaded Tex Rickard to bring together Dempsey and
      the worn-out but engaging Georges Carpentier at Boyle's
      Thirty Acres in Jersey City in 1921, the public responded
      as they had never before responded in the history of the
      country. Nearly seventy-five thousand people paid over a
      million and a half dollars--over three times as much as the
      Dempsey-Willard fight had brought in--to see the debonair
      Frenchman flattened in the fourth round, and the
      metropolitan papers, not content with a few columns in the
      sporting section, devoted page after page the next day to
      every conceivable detail of the fight. It was the first of
      the huge million-dollar bouts of the decade. Babe Ruth
      raised his home-run record to fifty-nine, and the 1921
      World Series broke records for gate receipts and
      attendance. Sport-hungry crowds who had never dreamed of
      taking a college-entrance examination swarmed to college
      football games, watched Captain Malcolm Aldrich of Yale and
      George Owen of Harvard, and devoured hundreds of columns of
      dopesters' gossip about Penn State and Pittsburgh and Iowa
      and the "praying Colonels" of Centre College. Racing had
      taken on a new lease of life with the unparalleled success
      of Man o' War in 1920. Tennis clubs were multiplying, and
      businessmen were discovering by the hundreds of thousands
      that a par-four hole was the best place to be in
      conference. There were food-fads, too, as well as
      sport-fads: such was the sudden and overwhelming craze for
      Eskimo Pie that in three months the price of cocoa beans on
      the New York market rose 50 per cent.

      Another new American institution caught the public eye
      during the summer of 1921--the bathing beauty. In early
      July a Costume and Beauty Show was held at Washington's
      bathing beach on the Potomac, and the prize-winners were so
      little touched by the influence of Mack Sennett and his
      moving-picture bathers that they wore tunic bathing-suits,
      hats over their long curls, and long stockings--all but
      one, who daringly rolled her stockings below her knees. In
      early September Atlantic City held its first Beauty
      Pageant--a similar show, but with a difference. "For the
      time being, the censor ban on bare knees and skintight
      bathing suits was suspended," wrote an astonished reporter,
      "and thousands of spectators gasped as they applauded the
      girls." Miss Washington was declared the most beautiful
      girl of the cities of America, the one-piece suit became
      overnight the orthodox wear for bathing beauties (though
      taffetas and sateens remained good enough for genuine
      seagoing bathers for a season or two to come), promoters of
      seashore resorts began to plan new contests, and the
      rotogravure and tabloid editors faced a future bright with
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tabloids, indeed, were booming--and not without effect.
      There was more than coincidence in the fact that as they
      rose, radicalism fell. They presented American life not as
      a political and economic struggle, but as a three-ring
      circus of sport, crime, and sex, and in varying degrees the
      other papers followed their lead under the pressure of
      competition. Workmen forgot to be class-conscious as they
      gloated over pictures of Miss Scranton on the Boardwalk and
      followed the Stillman case and the Arbuckle case and
      studied the racing dope about Morvich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers with perceptibly higher brows, too, had their
      diversions from the affairs of the day. Though their heads
      still reeled from <i>The Education of Henry Adams,</i> they
      were wading manfully through paleontology as revealed in
      the <i>Outline of History</i> (and getting bogged, most of
      them. somewhere near the section on Genghis Khan). They
      were asking one another whether America was truly as ugly
      as Sinclair Lewis made it in <i>Main Street</i> and Tahiti
      truly as enchanting as Frederick O'Brien made it in
      <i>White Shadows of the South Seas;</i> they were learning
      about hot love in hot places from <i>The Sheik,</i> and
      lapping up Mrs. Asquith's gossip of the British ruling
      classes, and having a good old-fashioned cry over <i>If
      Winter Comes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Further diversions were on the way, too. If there had been
      any doubt, after the radio craze struck the country, that
      the American people were learning to enjoy such diversions
      with headlong unanimity, the events of 1922 and 1923
      dispelled it. On the 16th of September, 1922, the murder of
      the decade took place: The Reverend Edward Wheeler Hall and
      Mrs. James Mills, the choir leader in his church, were
      found shot to death on an abandoned farm near New
      Brunswick, New Jersey. The Hall-Mills case had all the
      elements needed to satisfy an exacting public taste for the
      sensational. It was better than the Elwell case of June,
      1920. It was grisly, it was dramatic (the bodies being laid
      side by side as if to emphasize an unhallowed union), it
      involved wealth and respectability, it had just the right
      amount of sex interest--and in addition it took place close
      to the great metropolitan nerve-center of the American
      press. It was an illiterate American who did not shortly
      become acquainted with DeRussey's Lane, the crab-apple
      tree, the pig woman and her mule, the precise mental
      condition of Willie Stevens, and the gossip of the choir
      members.

      By this time, too, a new game was beginning its conquest of
      the country. In the first year or two after the war, Joseph
      P. Babcock, Soochow representative of the Standard Oil
      Company, had become interested in the Chinese game of Mah
      Jong and had codified and simplified the rules for the use
      of Americans. Two brothers named White had introduced it to
      the English-speaking clubs of Shanghai, where it became
      popular. It was brought to the United States, and won such
      immediate favor that W. A. Hammond, a San Francisco lumber
      merchant, was encouraged to import sets on an ambitious
      scale. By September, 1922, he had already imported fifty
      thousand dollars' worth. A big campaign of advertising,
      with free lessons and exhibitions, pushed the game, and
      within the next year the Mah Jong craze had become so
      universal that Chinese makers of sets could no longer keep
      up with the demand and American manufacture was in full
      swing. By 1923, people who were beginning to take their
      radio sets for granted now simply left them turned on while
      they "broke the wall" and called "pung" or "chow" and
      wielded the Ming box and talked learnedly of bamboos,
      flowers, seasons, South Wind, and Red Dragon. The wealthy
      bought five-hundred-dollar sets; dozens of manufacturers
      leaped into the business; a Mah Jong League of America was
      formed; there was fierce debate as to what rules to play
      by, what system of scoring to use, and what constituted a
      "limit hand"; and the correct dinner party wound up with
      every one setting up ivory and bamboo tiles on green baize
      tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before Mah Jong reached its climax, however, Emil Coué
      had arrived in America, preceded by an efficient ballyhoo;
      in the early months of 1923 the little dried-up Frenchman
      from Nancy was suddenly the most-talked-of person in the
      country. Coué Institutes were established, and audiences
      who thronged to hear the master speak were hushed into
      awesome quiet as he repeated, himself, the formula which
      was already on everybody's lips: "Day by day in every way I
      am getting better and better." A few weeks later there was
      a new national thrill as the news of the finding of the
      tomb of King Tut-Ankh-Amen, cabled all the way from Egypt,
      overshadowed the news of the Radical trials and Ku Klux
      Klan scandals, and dress manufacturers began to plan for a
      season of Egyptian styles. Finally, the country presently
      found still a new obsession--in the form of a song: a
      phrase picked up from an Italian fruit-vender and used some
      time before this as a "gag-line" by Tad Dorgan, the
      cartoonist, was worked into verse, put to music which drew
      liberally from the "Hallelujah Chorus" and "I Dreamt That I
      Dwelt in Marble Halls" and "Aunt Dinah's Quilting Party,"
      was tried out in a Long Island roadhouse, and then was
      brought to New York, where it quickly superseded "Mr.
      Gallagher and Mr. Shean" in popular acclaim. Before long
      "Yes, We Have No Bananas" had penetrated to the remotest
      farmhouse in the remotest county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the super-patriots still raged and federal agents
      still pursued the nimble Communists and an avowed Socialist
      was still regarded with as much enthusiasm as a leper, and
      the Ku Klux Klan still grew, the Big Red Scare was dying.
      There were too many other things to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, though, there was still another reason for the
      passing of the Red Menace. Another Menace was endangering
      the land--and one which could not possibly be attributed to
      the machinations of Moscow. The younger generation was on
      the rampage, as we shall presently see.

      Only one dispute, during the rest of the Post-war Decade,
      drew the old line of 1919 and 1920 between liberal and
      conservative throughout the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the height of the Big Red Scare--in April, 1920--there
      had taken place at South Braintree, Massachusetts, a crime
      so unimportant that it was not even mentioned in the <i>New
      York Times</i> of the following day--or, for that matter,
      of the whole following year. It was the sort of crime which
      was taking place constantly all over the country. A
      paymaster and his guard, carrying two boxes containing the
      pay-roll of a shoe factory, were killed by two men with
      pistols, who thereupon leaped into an automobile which drew
      up at the curb, and drove away across the railroad tracks.
      Two weeks later a couple of Italian radicals were arrested
      as the murderers, and a year later--at about the time when
      the Washington bathing beauties were straightening their
      long stockings to be photographed and David Sarnoff was
      supervising the reporting of the Dempsey-Carpentier fight
      by "wireless telephone"--the Italians were tried before
      Judge Webster Thayer and a jury and found guilty. The trial
      attracted a little attention, but not much. A few months
      later, however, people from Maine to California began to
      ask what this Sacco-Vanzetti case was all about. For a very
      remarkable thing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men in a bleak Boston office--a Spanish carpenter, a
      Jewish youth from New York, and an Italian
      newspaperman--had been writing industriously about the two
      Italians to the radicals and the radical press of France
      and Italy and Spain and other countries in Europe and
      Central and South America. The result: A bomb exploded in
      Ambassador Herrick's house in Paris. Twenty people were
      killed by another bomb in a Paris Sacco-Vanzetti
      demonstration. Crowds menaced the American Embassy in Rome.
      There was an attempt to bomb the home of the Consul-General
      at Lisbon. There was a general strike and an attempt to
      boycott American goods at Montevideo. The case was
      discussed in the radical press of Algiers, Porto Rico, and
      Mexico. Under the circumstances it could not very well help
      becoming a <i>cause célèbre</i> in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      But bombings and boycotts, though they attracted attention
      to the case, could never have aroused widespread public
      sympathy for Sacco and Vanzetti. What aroused it, as the
      case dragged on year after year and one appeal after
      another was denied, was the demeanor of the men themselves.
      Vanzetti in particular was clearly a remarkable man--an
      intellectual of noble character, a philosophical anarchist
      of a type which it seemed impossible to associate with a
      pay-roll murder. New evidence made the guilt of the men
      seem still more doubtful. When, in 1927--seven long years
      after the murder--Judge Thayer stubbornly denied the last
      appeal and pronounced the sentence of death, public opinion
      forced Governor Fuller of Massachusetts to review the case
      and consider pardoning Sacco and Vanzetti. The Governor
      named as an advisory committee to make a further study of
      the case, President Lowell of Harvard, President Stratton
      of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Judge
      Robert Grant--all men respected by the community. A few
      weeks later the committee reported: they believed Sacco and
      Vanzetti to be guilty. There was no pardon. On the night of
      August 22, 1927, these two men who had gathered about their
      cause the hopes and fears of millions throughout the world
      were sent to the electric chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether they were actually guilty or not will probably
      never be definitely determined--though no one can read
      their speeches to the court and their letters without
      doubting if justice was done. The record of the case was of
      vast length and full of technicalities, it was discussed
      <i>ex-parte</i> by vehement propagandists on both sides,
      and the division of public opinion on the case was largely
      a division between those who thought radicals ought to be
      strung up on general principles and those who thought that
      the test of a country's civilization lay in the
      scrupulousness with which it protected the rights of
      minorities. The passions of the early days of the decade
      were revived as pickets marched before the Boston State
      House, calling on the Governor to release Sacco and
      Vanzetti, and the Boston police--whose strike not eight
      years before had put Calvin Coolidge in the White House
      which he now occupied--arrested the pickets and bore them
      off to the lock-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bull market was now in full swing, the labor movement
      was enfeebled, prosperity had given radicalism what seemed
      to be its <i>coup de grâce</i>--but still the predicament
      of these two simple Italians had the power briefly to
      recall the days of Mitchell Palmer's Red raids and to
      arouse fears and hatreds long since quieted. People who had
      almost forgotten whether they were conservatives or
      liberals found themselves in bitter argument once more, and
      friendships were disrupted over the identification of
      Sacco's cap or the value of Captain Proctor's testimony
      about the fatal bullet. But only briefly. The headlines
      screamed that Sacco and Vanzetti had been executed, and men
      read them with a shiver, and wondered, perhaps, if this
      thing which had been done with such awful finality were the
      just desserts of crime or a hideous mistake--and glanced at
      another column to find where Lindbergh was flying today,
      and whipped open the paper to the financial page. . . .

      THE REVOLUTION IN MANNERS AND MORALS
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A first-class revolt against the accepted American order
      was certainly taking place during those early years of the
      Post-war Decade, but it was one with which Nikolai Lenin
      had nothing whatever to do. The shock troops of the
      rebellion were not alien agitators, but the sons and
      daughters of well-to-do American families, who knew little
      about Bolshevism and cared distinctly less, and their
      defiance was expressed not in obscure radical publications
      or in soap-box speeches, but right across the family
      breakfast table into the horrified ears of conservative
      fathers and mothers. Men and women were still shivering at
      the Red Menace when they awoke to the no less alarming
      Problem of the Younger Generation, and realized that if the
      constitution were not in danger, the moral code of the
      country certainly was.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code, as it currently concerned young people, might
      have been roughly summarized as follows: Women were the
      guardians of morality; they were made of finer stuff than
      men and were expected to act accordingly. Young girls must
      look forward in innocence (tempered perhaps with a modicum
      of physiological instruction) to a romantic love match
      which would lead them to the altar and to
      living-happily-ever-after, and until the "right man" came
      along they must allow no male to kiss them. It was expected
      that some men would succumb to the temptations of sex, but
      only with a special class of outlawed women; girls of
      respectable families were supposed to have no such
      temptations. Boys and girls were permitted large freedom to
      work and play together, with decreasing and well-nigh
      nominal chaperonage, but only because the code worked so
      well on the whole that a sort of honor system was
      supplanting supervision by their elders; it was taken for
      granted that if they had been well brought up they would
      never take advantage of this freedom. And although the
      attitude toward smoking and drinking by girls differed
      widely in different strata of society and different parts
      of the country, majority opinion held that it was morally
      wrong for them to smoke and could hardly imagine them
      showing the effects of alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war had not long been over when cries of alarm from
      parents, teachers, and moral preceptors began to rend the
      air. For the boys and girls just growing out of adolescence
      were making mincemeat of this code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dresses that the girls--and for that matter most of the
      older women--were wearing seemed alarming enough. In July,
      1920, a fashion-writer reported in the <i>New York
      Times</i> that "the American woman . . . has lifted her
      skirts far beyond any modest limitation," which was another
      way of saying that the hem was now all of nine inches above
      the ground. It was freely predicted that skirts would come
      down again in the winter of 1920-21, but instead they
      climbed a few scandalous inches farther. The flappers wore
      thin dresses, short-sleeved and occasionally (in the
      evening) sleeveless; some of the wilder young things rolled
      their stockings below their knees, revealing to the shocked
      eyes of virtue a fleeting glance of shin-bones and
      knee-cap; and many of them were visibly using cosmetics.
      "The intoxication of rouge," earnestly explained Dorothy
      Speare in <i>Dancers in the Dark,</i> "is an insidious
      vintage known to more girls than mere man can ever
      believe." Useless for frantic parents to insist that no
      lady did such things; the answer was that the daughters of
      ladies were doing it, and even retouching their
      masterpieces in public. Some of them, furthermore, were
      abandoning their corsets. "The men won't dance with you if
      you wear a corset," they were quoted as saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current mode in dancing created still more
      consternation. Not the romantic violin but the barbaric
      saxophone now dominated the orchestra, and to its
      passionate crooning and wailing the fox-trotters moved in
      what the editor of the Hobart College <i>Herald</i>
      disgustedly called a "syncopated embrace." No longer did
      even an inch of space separate them; they danced as if
      glued together, body to body, cheek to cheek. Cried the
      <i>Catholic Telegraph</i> of Cincinnati in righteous
      indignation, "The music is sensuous, the embracing of
      partners--the female only half dressed--is absolutely
      indecent; and the motions--they are such as may not be
      described, with any respect for propriety, in a family
      newspaper. Suffice it to say that there are certain houses
      appropriate for such dances; but those houses have been
      closed by law."
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposedly "nice" girls were smoking cigarettes--openly and
      defiantly, if often rather awkwardly and self-consciously.
      They were drinking--somewhat less openly but often all too
      efficaciously. There were stories of daughters of the most
      exemplary parents getting drunk--"blotto," as their
      companions cheerfully put it--on the contents of the
      hip-flasks of the new prohibition régime, and going out
      joyriding with men at four in the morning. And worst of
      all, even at well-regulated dances they were said to retire
      where the eye of the most sharp-sighted chaperon could not
      follow, and in darkened rooms or in parked cars to engage
      in the unspeakable practice of petting and necking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until F. Scott Fitzgerald, who had hardly
      graduated from Princeton and ought to know what his
      generation was doing, brought out <i>This Side of
      Paradise</i> in April, 1920, that fathers and mothers
      realized fully what was afoot and how long it had been
      going on. Apparently the "petting party" had been current
      as early as 1916, and was now widely established as an
      indoor sport. "None of the Victorian mothers--and most of
      the mothers were Victorian--had any idea how casually their
      daughters were accustomed to be kissed," wrote Mr.
      Fitzgerald. ". . . Amory saw girls doing things that even
      in his memory would have been impossible: eating
      three-o'clock, after-dance suppers in impossible cafés,
      talking of every side of life with an air half of
      earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement
      that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But
      he never realized how widespread it was until he saw the
      cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile
      intrigue." The book caused a shudder to run down the
      national spine; did not Mr. Fitzgerald represent one of his
      well-nurtured heroines as brazenly confessing, "I've kissed
      dozens of men. I suppose I'll kiss dozens more"; and
      another heroine as saying to a young man <i>(to a young
      man!),</i> "Oh, just one person in fifty has any glimmer of
      what sex is. I'm hipped on Freud and all that, but it's
      rotten that every bit of real love in the world is
      ninety-nine per cent passion and one little <i>soupçon</i>
      of jealousy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was incredible. It was abominable. What did it all mean?
      Was every decent standard being thrown over? Mothers read
      the scarlet words and wondered if they themselves "had any
      idea how often their daughters were accustomed to be
      kissed." . . . But no, this must be an exaggerated account
      of the misconduct of some especially depraved group. Nice
      girls couldn't behave like that and talk openly about
      passion. But in due course other books appeared to
      substantiate the findings of Mr. Fitzgerald: <i>Dancers in
      the Dark, The Plastic Age, Flaming Youth.</i> Magazine
      articles and newspapers reiterated the scandal. To be sure,
      there were plenty of communities where nice girls did not,
      in actual fact, "behave like that"; and even in the more
      sophisticated urban centers there were plenty of girls who
      did not. Nevertheless, there was enough fire beneath the
      smoke of these sensational revelations to make the Problem
      of the Younger Generation a topic of anxious discussion
      from coast to coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forces of morality rallied to the attack. Dr. Francis
      E. Clark, the founder and president of the Christian
      Endeavor Society, declared that the modern "indecent dance"
      was "an offense against womanly purity, the very
      fountainhead of our family and civil life." The new style
      of dancing was denounced in religious journals as "impure,
      polluting, corrupting, debasing, destroying spirituality,
      increasing carnality," and the mothers and sisters and
      church members of the land were called upon to admonish and
      instruct and raise the spiritual tone of these dreadful
      young people. President Murphy of the University of Florida
      cried out with true Southern warmth, "The low-cut gowns,
      the rolled hose and short skirts are born of the Devil and
      his angels, and are carrying the present and future
      generations to chaos and destruction." A group of Episcopal
      church-women in New York, speaking with the authority of
      wealth and social position (for they included Mrs. J.
      Pierpont Morgan, Mrs. Borden Harriman, Mrs. Henry Phipps,
      Mrs. James Roosevelt, and Mrs. E. H. Harriman), proposed an
      organization to discourage fashions involving an "excess of
      nudity" and "improper ways of dancing." The Y. W. C. A.
      conducted a national campaign against immodest dress among
      high-school girls, supplying newspapers with printed matter
      carrying headlines such as "Working Girls Responsive to
      Modesty Appeal" and "High Heels Losing Ground Even in
      France." In Philadelphia a Dress Reform Committee of
      prominent citizens sent a questionnaire to over a thousand
      clergymen to ask them what would be their idea of a proper
      dress, and although the gentlemen of the cloth showed a
      distressing variety of opinion, the committee proceeded to
      design a "moral gown" which was endorsed by ministers of
      fifteen denominations. The distinguishing characteristics
      of this moral gown were that it was very loose-fitting,
      that the sleeves reached just below the elbows, and that
      the hem came within seven and a half inches of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with example and reproof, legislators in
      several states introduced bills to reform feminine dress
      once and for all. The <i>New York American</i> reported in
      1921 that a bill was pending in Utah providing fine and
      imprisonment for those who wore on the streets "skirts
      higher than three inches above the ankle." A bill was laid
      before the Virginia legislature which would forbid any
      woman from wearing shirtwaists or evening gowns which
      displayed "more than three inches of her throat." In Ohio
      the proposed limit of décolletage was two inches; the bill
      introduced in the Ohio legislature aimed also to prevent
      the sale of any "garment which unduly displays or
      accentuates the lines of the female figure," and to
      prohibit any "female over fourteen years of age" from
      wearing "a skirt which does not reach to that part of the
      foot known as the instep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile innumerable families were torn with dissension
      over cigarettes and gin and all-night automobile rides.
      Fathers and mothers lay awake asking themselves whether
      their children were not utterly lost; sons and daughters
      evaded questions, lied miserably and unhappily, or flared
      up to reply rudely that at least they were not dirty-minded
      hypocrites, that they saw no harm in what they were doing
      and proposed to go right on doing it. From those liberal
      clergymen and teachers who prided themselves on keeping
      step with all that was new came a chorus of reassurance:
      these young people were at least franker and more honest
      than their elders had been; having experimented for
      themselves, would they not soon find out which standards
      were outworn and which represented the accumulated moral
      wisdom of the race? Hearing such hopeful words, many good
      people took heart again. Perhaps this flare-up of youthful
      passion was a flash in the pan, after all. Perhaps in
      another year or two the boys and girls would come to their
      senses and everything would be all right again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were wrong, however. For the revolt of the younger
      generation was only the beginning of a revolution in
      manners and morals that was already beginning to affect men
      and women of every age in every part of the country.

    <p>
      A number of forces were working together and interacting
      upon one another to make this revolution inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all was the state of mind brought about by the war
      and its conclusion. A whole generation had been infected by
      the eat-drink-and-be-merry-for-tomorrow-we-die spirit which
      accompanied the departure of the soldiers to the training
      camps and the fighting front. There had been an epidemic
      not only of abrupt war marriages, but of less conventional
      liaisons. In France, two million men had found themselves
      very close to filth and annihilation and very far from the
      American moral code and its defenders; prostitution had
      followed the flag and willing mademoiselles from
      Armentières had been plentiful; American girls sent over as
      nurses and war workers had come under the influence of
      continental manners and standards without being subject to
      the rigid protections thrown about their continental
      sisters of the respectable classes; and there had been a
      very widespread and very natural breakdown of traditional
      restraints and reticences and taboos. It was impossible for
      this generation to return unchanged when the ordeal was
      over. Some of them had acquired under the pressure of
      war-time conditions a new code which seemed to them quite
      defensible; millions of them had been provided with an
      emotional stimulant from which it was not easy to taper
      off. Their torn nerves craved the anodynes of speed,
      excitement, and passion. They found themselves expected to
      settle down into the humdrum routine of American life as if
      nothing had happened, to accept the moral dicta of elders
      who seemed to them still to be living in a Pollyanna land
      of rosy ideals which the war had killed for them. They
      couldn't do it, and they very disrespectfully said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The older generation had certainly pretty well ruined this
      world before passing it on to us," wrote one of them (John
      F. Carter in the <i>Atlantic Monthly,</i> September, 1920),
      expressing accurately the sentiments of innumerable
      contemporaries. "They give us this thing, knocked to
      pieces, leaky, red-hot, threatening to blow up; and then
      they are surprised that we don't accept it with the same
      attitude of pretty, decorous enthusiasm with which they
      received it, way back in the 'eighties."
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle generation was not so immediately affected by
      the war neurosis. They had had time enough, before 1917, to
      build up habits of conformity not easily broken down. But
      they, too, as the let-down of 1919 followed the war, found
      themselves restless and discontented, in a mood to question
      everything that had once seemed to them true and worthy and
      of good report. They too had spent themselves and wanted a
      good time. They saw their juniors exploring the approaches
      to the forbidden land of sex, and presently they began to
      play with the idea of doing a little experimenting of their
      own. The same disillusion which had defeated Woodrow Wilson
      and had caused strikes and riots and the Big Red Scare
      furnished a culture in which the germs of the new freedom
      could grow and multiply.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The revolution was accelerated also by the growing
      independence of the American woman. She won the suffrage in
      1920. She seemed, it is true, to be very little interested
      in it once she had it; she voted, but mostly as the
      unregenerate men about her did, despite the efforts of
      women's clubs and the League of Women Voters to awaken her
      to womanhood's civic opportunity; feminine candidates for
      office were few, and some of them--such as Governor Ma
      Ferguson of Texas--scarcely seemed to represent the
      starry-eyed spiritual influence which, it had been
      promised, would presently ennoble public life. Few of the
      younger women could rouse themselves to even a passing
      interest in politics: to them it was a sordid and futile
      business, without flavor and without hope. Nevertheless,
      the winning of the suffrage had its effect. It consolidated
      woman's position as man's equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more marked was the effect of woman's growing
      independence of the drudgeries of housekeeping. Smaller
      houses were being built, and they were easier to look
      after. Families were moving into apartments, and these made
      even less claim upon the housekeeper's time and energy.
      Women were learning how to make lighter work of the
      preparation of meals. Sales of canned foods were growing,
      the number of delicatessen stores had increased three times
      as fast as the population during the decade 1910-20, the
      output of bakeries increased by 60 per cent during the
      decade 1914-24. Much of what had once been housework was
      now either moving out of the home entirely or being
      simplified by machinery. The use of commercial laundries,
      for instance, increased by 57 per cent between 1914 and
      1924. Electric washing-machines and electric irons were
      coming to the aid of those who still did their washing at
      home; the manager of the local electric power company at
      "Middletown," a typical small American city, estimated in
      1924 that nearly 90 per cent of the homes in the city
      already had electric irons. The housewife was learning to
      telephone her shopping orders, to get her clothes
      ready-made and spare herself the rigors of dress-making, to
      buy a vacuum cleaner and emulate the lovely carefree girls
      in the magazine advertisements who banished dust with such
      delicate fingers. Women were slowly becoming emancipated
      from routine to "live their own lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      And what were these "own lives" of theirs to be like? Well,
      for one thing, they could take jobs. Up to this time girls
      of the middle classes who had wanted to "do something" had
      been largely restricted to school-teaching, social-service
      work, nursing, stenography, and clerical work in business
      houses. But now they poured out of the schools and colleges
      into all manner of new occupations. They besieged the
      offices of publishers and advertisers; they went into
      tea-room management until there threatened to be more
      purveyors than consumers of chicken patties and cinnamon
      toast; they sold antiques, sold real estate, opened smart
      little shops, and finally invaded the department stores. In
      1920 the department store was in the mind of the average
      college girl a rather bourgeois institution which employed
      "poor shop girls"; by the end of the decade college girls
      were standing in line for openings in the misses'
      sports-wear department and even selling behind the counter
      in the hope that some day fortune might smile upon them and
      make them buyers or stylists. Small-town girls who once
      would have been contented to stay in Sauk Center all their
      days were now borrowing from father to go to New York or
      Chicago to seek their fortunes--in Best's or Macy's or
      Marshall Field's. Married women who were encumbered with
      children and could not seek jobs consoled themselves with
      the thought that home-making and child-rearing were really
      "professions," after all. No topic was so furiously
      discussed at luncheon tables from one end of the country to
      the other as the question whether the married woman should
      take a job, and whether the mother had a right to. And as
      for the unmarried woman, she no longer had to explain why
      she worked in a shop or an office; it was idleness,
      nowadays, that had to be defended.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the job--or at least the sense that the job was a
      possibility--came a feeling of comparative economic
      independence. With the feeling of economic independence
      came a slackening of husbandly and parental authority.
      Maiden aunts and unmarried daughters were leaving the
      shelter of the family roof to install themselves in
      kitchenette apartments of their own. For city-dwellers the
      home was steadily becoming less of a shrine, more of a
      dormitory--a place of casual shelter where one stopped
      overnight on the way from the restaurant and the movie
      theater to the office. Yet even the job did not provide the
      American woman with that complete satisfaction which the
      management of a mechanized home no longer furnished. She
      still had energies and emotions to burn; she was ready for
      the revolution.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Like all revolutions, this one was stimulated by foreign
      propaganda. It came, however, not from Moscow, but from
      Vienna. Sigmund Freud had published his first book on
      psychoanalysis at the end of the nineteenth century, and he
      and Jung had lectured to American psychologists as early as
      1909, but it was not until after the war that the Freudian
      gospel began to circulate to a marked extent among the
      American lay public. The one great intellectual force which
      had not suffered disrepute as a result of the war was
      science; the more-or-less educated public was now absorbing
      a quantity of popularized information about biology and
      anthropology which gave a general impression that men and
      women were merely animals of a rather intricate variety,
      and that moral codes had no universal validity and were
      often based on curious superstitions. A fertile ground was
      ready for the seeds of Freudianism, and presently one began
      to hear even from the lips of flappers that "science
      taught" new and disturbing things about sex. Sex, it
      appeared, was the central and pervasive force which moved
      mankind. Almost every human motive was attributable to it:
      if you were patriotic or liked the violin, you were in the
      grip of sex--in a sublimated form. The first requirement of
      mental health was to have an uninhibited sex life. If you
      would be well and happy, you must obey your libido. Such
      was the Freudian gospel as it imbedded itself in the
      American mind after being filtered through the successive
      minds of interpreters and popularizers and guileless
      readers and people who had heard guileless readers talk
      about it. New words and phrases began to be bandied about
      the cocktail-tray and the Mah Jong table--inferiority
      complex, sadism, masochism, &OElig;dipus complex.
      Intellectual ladies went to Europe to be analyzed; analysts
      plied their new trade in American cities, conscientiously
      transferring the affections of their fair patients to
      themselves; and clergymen who preached about the virtue of
      self-control were reminded by outspoken critics that
      self-control was out-of-date and really dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The principal remaining forces which accelerated the
      revolution in manners and morals were all 100 per cent
      American. They were prohibition, the automobile, the
      confession and sex magazines, and the movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified, prohibition
      seemed, as we have already noted, to have an almost united
      country behind it. Evasion of the law began immediately,
      however, and strenuous and sincere opposition to
      it--especially in the large cities of the North and
      East--quickly gathered force. The results were the
      bootlegger, the speakeasy, and a spirit of deliberate
      revolt which in many communities made drinking "the thing
      to do." From these facts in turn flowed further results:
      the increased popularity of distilled as against fermented
      liquors, the use of the hip-flask, the cocktail party, and
      the general transformation of drinking from a masculine
      prerogative to one shared by both sexes together. The
      old-time saloon had been overwhelmingly masculine; the
      speakeasy usually catered to both men and women. As Elmer
      Davis put it, "The old days when father spent his evenings
      at Cassidy's bar with the rest of the boys are gone, and
      probably gone forever; Cassidy may still be in business at
      the old stand and father may still go down there of
      evenings, but since prohibition mother goes down with him."
      Under the new régime not only the drinks were mixed, but
      the company as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile a new sort of freedom was being made possible by
      the enormous increase in the use of the automobile, and
      particularly of the closed car. (In 1919 hardly more than
      10 per cent of the cars produced in the United States were
      closed; by 1924 the percentage had jumped to 43, by 1927 it
      had reached 82.8.) The automobile offered an almost
      universally available means of escaping temporarily from
      the supervision of parents and chaperons, or from the
      influence of neighborhood opinion. Boys and girls now
      thought nothing, as the Lynds pointed out in
      <i>Middletown,</i> of jumping into a car and driving off at
      a moment's notice--without asking anybody's permission--to
      a dance in another town twenty miles away, where they were
      strangers and enjoyed a freedom impossible among their
      neighbors. The closed car, moreover, was in effect a room
      protected from the weather which could be occupied at any
      time of the day or night and could be moved at will into a
      darkened byway or a country lane. The Lynds quoted the
      judge of the juvenile court in "Middletown" as declaring
      that the automobile had become a "house of prostitution on
      wheels," and cited the fact that of thirty girls brought
      before his court in a year on charges of sex crimes, for
      whom the place where the offense had occurred was recorded,
      nineteen were listed as having committed it in an
      automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, as the revolution began, its influence fertilized
      a bumper crop of sex magazines, confession magazines, and
      lurid motion pictures, and these in turn had their effect
      on a class of readers and movie-goers who had never heard
      and never would hear of Freud and the libido. The
      publishers of the sex adventure magazines, offering stories
      with such titles as "What I Told My Daughter the Night
      Before Her Marriage," "Indolent Kisses," and "Watch Your
      Step-ins," learned to a nicety the gentle art of arousing
      the reader without arousing the censor. The publishers of
      the confession magazines, while always instructing their
      authors to provide a moral ending and to utter pious
      sentiments, concentrated on the description of what they
      euphemistically called "missteps." Most of their fiction
      was faked to order by hack writers who could write one day
      "The Confessions of a Chorus Girl" and the next day
      recount, again in the first person, the temptations which
      made it easy for the taxidriver to go wrong. Both classes
      of magazines became astonishingly numerous and successful.
      Bernarr Macfadden's <i>True-Story,</i> launched as late as
      1919, had over 300,000 readers by 1923; 848,000 by 1924;
      over a million and a half by 1925; and almost two million
      by 1926--a record of rapid growth probably unparalleled in
      magazine publishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowding the news stands along with the sex and confession
      magazines were motion-picture magazines which depicted
      "seven movie kisses" with such captions as "Do you
      recognize your little friend, Mae Busch? She's had lots of
      kisses, but she never seems to grow <i>blasé.</i> At least
      you'll agree that she's giving a good imitation of a person
      enjoying this one." The movies themselves, drawing millions
      to their doors every day and every night, played
      incessantly upon the same lucrative theme. The producers of
      one picture advertised "brilliant men, beautiful jazz
      babies, champagne baths, midnight revels, petting parties
      in the purple dawn, all ending in one terrific smashing
      climax that makes you gasp"; the venders of another
      promised "neckers, petters, white kisses, red kisses,
      pleasure-mad daughters, sensation-craving mothers, . . .
      the truth--bold, naked, sensational." Seldom did the films
      offer as much as these advertisements promised, but there
      was enough in some of them to cause a sixteen-year-old girl
      (quoted by Alice Miller Mitchell) to testify, "Those
      pictures with hot love-making in them, they make girls and
      boys sitting together want to get up and walk out, go off
      somewhere, you know. Once I walked out with a boy before
      the picture was even over. We took a ride. But my friend,
      she all the time had to get up and go out with her
      boyfriend."
    </p>
    <p>
      A storm of criticism from church organizations led the
      motion-picture producers, early in the decade, to install
      Will H. Hays, President Harding's Postmaster-General, as
      their arbiter of morals and of taste, and Mr. Hays promised
      that all would be well. "This industry must have," said he
      before the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, "toward that
      sacred thing, the mind of a child, toward that clean virgin
      thing, that unmarked slate, the same responsibility, the
      same care about the impressions made upon it, that the best
      clergyman or the most inspired teacher of youth would
      have." The result of Mr. Hays's labors in behalf of the
      unmarked slate was to make the moral ending as obligatory
      as in the confession magazines, to smear over sexy pictures
      with pious platitudes, and to blacklist for motion-picture
      production many a fine novel and play which, because of its
      very honesty, might be construed as seriously or
      intelligently questioning the traditional sex ethics of the
      small town. Mr. Hays, being something of a genius, managed
      to keep the churchmen at bay. Whenever the threats of
      censorship began to become ominous he would promulgate a
      new series of moral commandments for the producers to
      follow. Yet of the practical effects of his supervision it
      is perhaps enough to say that the quotations given above
      all date from the period of his dictatorship. Giving
      lip-service to the old code, the movies diligently and with
      consummate vulgarity publicized the new.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these diverse influences--the post-war disillusion,
      the new status of women, the Freudian gospel, the
      automobile, prohibition, the sex and confession magazines,
      and the movies--had its part in bringing about the
      revolution. Each of them, as an influence, was played upon
      by all the others; none of them could alone have changed to
      any great degree the folkways of America; together their
      force was irresistible.

    <p>
      The most conspicuous sign of what was taking place was the
      immense change in women's dress and appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Professor Paul H. Nystrom's <i>Economics of Fashion,</i>
      the trend of skirt-length during the Post-war Decade is
      ingeniously shown by the sort of graph with which business
      analysts delight to compute the ebb and flow of
      car-loadings or of stock averages. The basis of this graph
      is a series of measurements of fashion-plates in the
      <i>Delineator;</i> the statistician painstakingly measured
      the relation, from month to month, of the height of the
      skirt hem above the ground to the total height of the
      figure, and plotted his curve accordingly. This very
      unusual graph shows that in 1919 the average distance of
      the hem above the ground was about 10 per cent of the
      woman's height--or to put it in another way, about six or
      seven inches. In 1920 it curved upward from 10 to about 20
      per cent. During the next three years it gradually dipped
      to 10 per cent again, reaching its low point in 1923. In
      1924, however, it rose once more to between 15 and 20 per
      cent, in 1925 to more than 20 per cent; and the curve
      continued steadily upward until by 1927 it had passed the
      25 per cent mark--in other words, until the skirt had
      reached the knee. There it remained until late in 1929.
    </p>
    <p>
      This graph, as Professor Nystrom explains, does not
      accurately indicate what really happened, for it represents
      for any given year or month, not the average length of
      skirts actually worn, but the length of the skirt which the
      arbiters of fashion, not uninfluenced by the manufacturers
      of dress goods, expected and wanted women to wear. In
      actual fact, the dip between 1921 and 1924 was very slight.
      Paris dressmakers predicted the return of longer skirts,
      the American stylists and manufacturers followed their
      lead, the stores bought the longer skirts and tried to sell
      them, but women kept on buying the shortest skirts they
      could find. During the fall of 1923 and the spring of 1924,
      manufacturers were deluged with complaints from retailers
      that skirts would have to be shorter. Shorter they finally
      were, and still shorter. The knee-length dress proved to be
      exactly what women wanted. The unlucky manufacturers made
      valiant efforts to change the fashion. Despite all they
      could do, however, the knee-length skirt remained standard
      until the decade was approaching its end.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the short skirt went an extraordinary change in the
      weight and material and amount of women's clothing. The
      boyishly slender figure became the aim of every woman's
      ambition, and the corset was so far abandoned that even in
      so short a period as the three years from 1924 to 1927 the
      combined sales of corsets and brassières in the department
      stores of the Cleveland Federal Reserve District fell off
      11 per cent. Silk or rayon stockings and underwear
      supplanted cotton, to the distress of cotton manufacturers
      and the delight of rayon manufacturers; the production of
      rayon in American plants, which in 1920 had been only eight
      million pounds, had by 1925 reached fifty-three million
      pounds. The flesh-colored stocking became as standard as
      the short skirt. Petticoats almost vanished from the
      American scene; in fact, the tendency of women to drop off
      one layer of clothing after another became so pronounced
      that in 1928 the <i>Journal of Commerce</i> estimated that
      in 15 years the amount of material required for a woman's
      complete costume (exclusive of her stockings) had declined
      from 19 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> yards to 7 yards. All she
      could now be induced to wear, it seemed, was an overblouse
      (2 yards), a skirt (2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> yards),
      vest or shirt (<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>), knickers (2),
      and stockings--and all of them were made of silk or rayon!
      This latter statement, it is true, was a slight
      exaggeration; but a survey published in 1926 by the
      National Retail Dry Goods Association, on the basis of data
      from department stores all over the country, showed that
      only 33 per cent of the women's underwear sold was made of
      cotton, whereas 36 per cent was made of rayon, and 31 per
      cent of silk. No longer were silk stockings the mark of the
      rich; as the wife of a workingman with a total family
      income of $1,638 a year told the authors of
      <i>Middletown,</i> "No girl can wear cotton stockings to
      high school. Even in winter my children wear silk stockings
      with lisle or imitations underneath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with the freedom of short and skimpy clothes,
      women sought, too, the freedom of short hair. During the
      early years of the decade the bobbed head--which in 1918,
      as you may recall, had been regarded by the proprietor of
      the Palm Garden in New York as a sign of radicalism--became
      increasingly frequent among young girls, chiefly on the
      ground of convenience. In May, 1922, the <i>American
      Hairdresser</i> predicted that the bob, which persisted in
      being popular, "will probably last through the summer,
      anyway." It not only did this, it so increased in
      popularity that by 1924 the same journal was forced to
      feature bobbed styles and give its subscribers instructions
      in the new art, and was reporting the progress of a lively
      battle between the professional hairdressers and the
      barbers for the cream of this booming business. The ladies'
      hairdressers very naturally objected to women going to
      barbers' shops; the barbers, on the other hand, were trying
      to force legislation in various states which would forbid
      the "hairdressing profession" to cut hair unless they were
      licensed as barbers. Said the <i>Hairdresser,</i> putting
      the matter on the loftiest basis, "The effort to bring
      women to barber shops for haircutting is against the best
      interests of the public, the free and easy atmosphere often
      prevailing in barber shops being unsuitable to the high
      standard of American womanhood." But all that American
      womanhood appeared to insist upon was the best possible
      shingle. In the latter years of the decade bobbed hair
      became almost universal among girls in their twenties, very
      common among women in their thirties and forties, and by no
      means rare among women of sixty; and for a brief period the
      hair was not only bobbed, but in most cases cropped close
      to the head like a man's. Women universally adopted the
      small cloche hat which fitted tightly on the bobbed head,
      and the manufacturer of milliner's materials joined the
      hair-net manufacturer, the hair-pin manufacturer, and the
      cotton goods and woolen goods and corset manufacturers,
      among the ranks of depressed industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another industry, however, the decade brought new and
      enormous profits. The manufacturers of cosmetics and the
      proprietors of beauty shops had less than nothing to
      complain of. The vogue of rouge and lipstick, which in 1920
      had so alarmed the parents of the younger generation,
      spread swiftly to the remotest village. Women who in 1920
      would have thought the use of paint immoral were soon
      applying it regularly as a matter of course and making no
      effort to disguise the fact; beauty shops had sprung up on
      every street to give "facials," to apply pomade and
      astringents, to make war against the wrinkles and sagging
      chins of age, to pluck and trim and color the eyebrows, and
      otherwise to enhance and restore the bloom of youth; and a
      strange new form of surgery, "face-lifting," took its place
      among the applied sciences of the day. Back in 1917,
      according to Frances Fisher Dubuc, only two persons in the
      beauty culture business had paid an income tax; by 1927
      there were 18,000 firms and individuals in this field
      listed as income-tax payers. The "beautician" had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the total amount of money spent by American women on
      cosmetics and beauty culture by the end of the decade, we
      may probably accept as conservative the prodigious figure
      of three-quarters of a billion dollars set by Professor
      Paul H. Nystrom in 1930; other estimates, indeed, ran as
      high as two billion. Mrs. Christine Frederick tabulated in
      1929 some other equally staggering figures: for every adult
      woman in the country there were being sold annually over a
      pound of face powder and no less than eight rouge compacts;
      there were 2,500 brands of perfume on the market and 1,500
      face creams; and if all the lipsticks sold in a year in the
      United States were placed end to end, they would reach from
      New York to Reno--which to some would seem an altogether
      logical destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the readiest way of measuring the change in the
      public attitude toward cosmetics is to compare the
      advertisements in a conservative periodical at the
      beginning of the decade with those at its end. Although the
      June, 1919, issue of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>
      contained four advertisements which listed rouge among
      other products, only one of them commented on its
      inclusion, and this referred to its rouge as one that was
      "imperceptible if properly applied." In those days the
      woman who used rouge--at least in the circles in which the
      <i>Journal</i> was read--wished to disguise the fact.
      (Advertisements of talc, in 1919, commonly displayed a
      mother leaning affectionately over a bouncing baby.) In the
      June, 1929, issue, exactly ten years later, the
      <i>Journal</i> permitted a lipstick to be advertised with
      the comment, "It's comforting to know that the alluring
      note of scarlet will stay with you for hours."
      (Incidentally, the examination of those two magazines
      offers another contrast: in 1919 the Listerine
      advertisement said simply, "The prompt application of
      Listerine may prevent a minor accident from becoming a
      major infection," whereas in 1929 it began a tragic
      rhapsody with the words, "Spring! for everyone but her . .
      .").
    </p>
    <p>
      These changes in fashion--the short skirt, the boyish form,
      the straight, long-waisted dresses, the frank use of
      paint--were signs of a real change in the American feminine
      ideal (as well, perhaps, as in men's idea of what was the
      feminine ideal). Women were bent on freedom--freedom to
      work and to play without the trammels that had bound them
      heretofore to lives of comparative inactivity. But what
      they sought was not the freedom from man and his desires
      which had put the suffragists of an earlier day into hard
      straw hats and mannish suits and low-heeled shoes. The
      woman of the nineteen-twenties wanted to be able to allure
      man even on the golf links and in the office; the little
      flapper who shingled her hair and wore a manageable little
      hat and put on knickerbockers for the weekends would not be
      parted from her silk stockings and her high-heeled shoes.
      Nor was the post-war feminine ideal one of fruitful
      maturity or ripened wisdom or practiced grace. On the
      contrary: the quest of slenderness, the flattening of the
      breasts, the vogue of short skirts (even when short skirts
      still suggested the appearance of a little girl), the
      juvenile effect of the long waist--all were signs that,
      consciously or unconsciously, the women of this decade
      worshiped not merely youth, but unripened youth. They
      wanted to be--or thought men wanted them to be--men's
      casual and light-hearted companions; not broad-hipped
      mothers of the race, but irresponsible playmates. Youth was
      their pattern, but not youthful innocence: the adolescent
      whom they imitated was a hard-boiled adolescent, who
      thought not in terms of romantic love, but in terms of sex,
      and who made herself desirable not by that sly art which
      conceals art, but frankly and openly. In effect, the woman
      of the Post-war Decade said to man, "You are tired and
      disillusioned, you do not want the cares of a family or the
      companionship of mature wisdom, you want exciting play, you
      want the thrills of sex without their fruition, and I will
      give them to you." And to herself she added, "But I will be
      free."

      One indication of the revolution in manners which her
      headlong pursuit of freedom brought about was her rapid
      acceptance of the cigarette. Within a very few years
      millions of American women of all ages followed the lead of
      the flappers of 1920 and took up smoking. Custom still
      generally frowned upon their doing it on the street or in
      the office, and in the evangelical hinterlands the old
      taboo died hard; but in restaurants, at dinner parties and
      dances, in theater lobbies, and in a hundred other places
      they made the air blue. Here again the trend in advertising
      measured the trend in public opinion. At the beginning of
      the decade advertisers realized that it would have been
      suicidal to portray a woman smoking; within a few years,
      however, they ventured pictures of pretty girls imploring
      men to blow some of the smoke their way; and by the end of
      the decade billboards boldly displayed a smart-looking
      woman cigarette in hand, and in some of the magazines,
      despite floods of protests from rural readers, tobacco
      manufacturers were announcing that "now women may enjoy a
      companionable smoke with their husbands and brothers." In
      the ten years between 1918 and 1928 the total production of
      cigarettes in the United States <i>more than doubled.</i>
      Part of this increase was doubtless due to the death of the
      one-time masculine prejudice against the cigarette as
      unmanly, for it was accompanied by somewhat of a decrease
      in the production of cigars and smoking tobacco, as well
      as--mercifully--of chewing tobacco. Part of it was
      attributable to the fact that the convenience of the
      cigarette made the masculine smoker consume more tobacco
      than in the days when he preferred a cigar or a pipe. But
      the increase could never have been so large had it not been
      for the women who now strewed the dinner table with their
      ashes, snatched a puff between the acts, invaded the
      masculine sanctity of the club car, and forced department
      stores to place ornamental ash-trays between the chairs in
      their women's shoe departments. A formidable barrier
      between the sexes had broken down. The custom of separating
      them after formal dinners, for example, still lingered, but
      as an empty rite. Hosts who laid in a stock of cigars for
      their male guests often found them untouched; the men in
      the dining-room were smoking the very same brands of
      cigarettes that the ladies consumed in the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of far greater social significance, however, was the fact
      that men and women were drinking together. Among well-to-do
      people the serving of cocktails before dinner became almost
      socially obligatory. Mixed parties swarmed up to the
      curtained grills of speakeasies and uttered the mystic
      password, and girls along with men stood at the speakeasy
      bar with one foot on the old brass rail. The late afternoon
      cocktail party became a new American institution. When
      dances were held in hotels, the curious and rather unsavory
      custom grew up of hiring hotel rooms where reliable drinks
      could be served in suitable privacy; guests of both sexes
      lounged on the beds and tossed off mixtures of high
      potency. As houses and apartments became smaller, the
      country club became the social center of the small city,
      the suburb, and the summer resort; and to its pretentious
      clubhouse, every Saturday night, drove men and women (after
      a round of cocktails at somebody's house) for the weekly
      dinner dance. Bottles of White Rock and of ginger ale
      decked the tables, out of capacious masculine hip pockets
      came flasks of gin (once the despised and rejected of
      bartenders, now the most popular of all liquors), and women
      who a few years before would have gasped at the thought
      that they would ever be "under the influence of alcohol"
      found themselves matching the men drink for drink and
      enjoying the uproarious release. The next day gossip would
      report that the reason Mrs. So-and-so disappeared from the
      party at eleven was because she had had too many cocktails
      and had been led to the dressing-room to be sick, or that
      somebody would have to meet the club's levy for breakage,
      or that Mrs. Such-and-such really oughtn't to drink so much
      because three cocktails made her throw bread about the
      table. A passing scandal would be created by a dance at
      which substantial married men amused themselves by tripping
      up waiters, or young people bent on petting parties drove
      right out on the golf-links and made wheel-tracks on the
      eighteenth green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such incidents were of course exceptional and in many
      communities they never occurred. It was altogether
      probable, though the professional wets denied it, that
      prohibition succeeded in reducing the total amount of
      drinking in the country as a whole and in reducing it
      decidedly among the workingmen of the industrial districts.
      The majority of experienced college administrators
      agreed--rather to the annoyance of some of their
      undergraduates--that there was less drinking among men
      students than there had been before prohibition and that
      drinking among girl students, at least while they were in
      residence, hardly offered a formidable problem. Yet the
      fact remained that among the prosperous classes which set
      the standards of national social behavior, alcohol flowed
      more freely than ever before and lubricated an
      unprecedented informality--to say the least--of manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lubricated, too, a new outspokenness between men and
      women. Thanks to the spread of scientific skepticism and
      especially to Sigmund Freud, the dogmas of the conservative
      moralists were losing force and the dogma that salvation
      lay in facing the facts of sex was gaining. An upheaval in
      values was taking place. Modesty, reticence, and chivalry
      were going out of style; women no longer wanted to be
      "ladylike" or could appeal to their daughters to be
      "wholesome"; it was too widely suspected that the
      old-fashioned lady had been a sham and that the "wholesome"
      girl was merely inhibiting a nasty mind and would come to
      no good end. "Victorian" and "Puritan" were becoming terms
      of opprobrium: up-to-date people thought of Victorians as
      old ladies with bustles and inhibitions, and of Puritans as
      blue-nosed, ranting spoilsports. It was better to be
      modern--everybody wanted to be modern--and sophisticated,
      and smart, to smash the conventions and to be devastatingly
      frank. And with a cocktail glass in one's hand it was easy
      at least to be frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen with a detached ear to a modern conversation,"
      wrote Mary Agnes Hamilton in 1927, "and you will be struck,
      first, by the restriction of the vocabulary, and second, by
      the high proportion in that vocabulary of words such as, in
      the older jargon, 'no lady could use.'" With the taste for
      strong liquors went a taste for strong language. To one's
      lovely dinner partner, the inevitable antithesis for
      "grand" and "swell" had become "lousy." An unexpected
      "damn" or "hell" uttered on the New York stage was no
      longer a signal for the sudden sharp laughter of shocked
      surprise; such words were becoming the commonplace of
      everyday talk. The barroom anecdote of the decade before
      now went the rounds of aristocratic bridge tables. Every
      one wanted to be unshockable; it was delightful to be
      considered a little shocking; and so the competition in
      boldness of talk went on until for a time, as Mrs. Hamilton
      put it, a conversation in polite circles was like a room
      decorated entirely in scarlet--the result was
      over-emphasis, stridency, and eventual boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the new frankness in conversation went a new
      frankness in books and the theater. Consider, for example,
      the themes of a handful of the best plays produced in New
      York during the decade: <i>What Price Glory?</i> which
      represented the amorous marines interlarding their talk
      with epithets new to the stage; <i>The Road to Rome,</i>
      the prime comic touch of which was the desire of a Roman
      matron to be despoiled by the Carthaginians; <i>Strange
      Interlude,</i> in which a wife who found there was insanity
      in her husband's family but wanted to give him a child
      decided to have the child by an attractive young doctor,
      instead of by her husband, and forthwith fell in love with
      the doctor; <i>Strictly Dishonorable,</i> in which a
      charming young girl walked blithely and open-eyed into an
      affair of a night with an opera-singer; and <i>The
      Captive,</i> which revealed to thousands of innocents the
      fact that the world contained such a phenomenon as
      homosexuality. None of these plays could have been
      tolerated even in New York before the Post-war Decade; all
      of them in the nineteen-twenties were not merely popular,
      but genuinely admired by intelligent audiences. The effect
      of some of them upon these audiences is suggested by the
      story of the sedate old lady who, after two acts of <i>What
      Price Glory?</i> reprimanded her grandson with a "God damn
      it, Johnny, sit down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thing was true of the novels of the decade; one
      after another, from <i>Jurgen</i> and <i>Dark Laughter</i>
      through the tales of Michael Arlen to <i>An American
      Tragedy</i> and <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>The Well
      of Loneliness</i> and <i>Point Counter Point,</i> they
      dealt with sex with an openness or a cynicism or an unmoral
      objectivity new to the English-speaking world. Bitterly the
      defenders of the Puritan code tried to stem the tide, but
      it was too strong for them. They banned <i>Jurgen</i>--and
      made a best seller of it and a public reputation for its
      author. They dragged Mary Ware Dennett into court for
      distributing a pamphlet for children which explained some
      of the mysteries of sex--only to have her upheld by a
      liberal judge and endorsed by intelligent public opinion.
      In Boston, where they were backed by an alliance between
      stubborn Puritanism and Roman Catholicism, they banned
      books wholesale, forbade the stage presentation of
      <i>Strange Interlude,</i> and secured the conviction of a
      bookseller for selling <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>--only
      to find that the intellectuals of the whole country were
      laughing at them and that ultimately they were forced to
      allow the publication of books which they would have moved
      to ban ten years before. Despite all that they could do,
      the taste of the country demanded a new sort of reading
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the decade a distinguished essayist wrote an
      article in which she contended that the physical processes
      of childbirth were humiliating to many women. She showed it
      to the editor of one of the best magazines, and he and she
      agreed that it should not be printed: too many readers
      would be repelled by the subject matter and horrified by
      the thesis. Only a few years later, in 1927, the editor
      recalled this manuscript and asked if he might see it
      again. He saw it--and wondered why it had ever been
      disqualified. Already such frankness seemed quite natural
      and permissible. The article was duly published, and caused
      only the mildest of sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in 1918 the editors of a reputable magazine had accepted
      a story in which one gangster said to another, "For
      Christ's sake, Joe, give her the gas. Some lousy bastard
      has killed Eddie," they would have whipped out the blue
      pencil and changed the passage to something like "For the
      love of Mike, Joe, give her the gas. Some dirty skunk has
      killed Eddie." In 1929 that sentence appeared in a story
      accepted by a magazine of the most unblemished standing,
      and was printed without alteration. A few readers objected,
      but not many. Times had changed. Even in the great popular
      periodicals with huge circulations and a considerable
      following in the strongholds of rural Methodism the change
      in standards was apparent. Said a short-story writer in the
      late nineteen-twenties, "I used to write for magazines like
      the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> and the <i>Pictorial
      Review</i> when I had a nice innocuous tale to tell and
      wanted the money, and for magazines like <i>Harper's</i>
      and <i>Scribner's</i> when I wanted to write something
      searching and honest. Now I find I can sell the honest
      story to the big popular magazines too."

      With the change in manners went an inevitable change in
      morals. Boys and girls were becoming sophisticated about
      sex at an earlier age; it was symptomatic that when the
      authors of <i>Middletown</i> asked 241 boys and 315 girls
      of high-school age to mark as true or false, according to
      their opinion, the extreme statement, "Nine out of every
      ten boys and girls of high-school age have petting
      parties," almost precisely half of them marked it as true.
      How much actual intercourse there was among such young
      people it is of course impossible to say; but the lurid
      stories told by Judge Lindsay--of girls who carried
      contraceptives in their vanity cases, and of "Caroline,"
      who told the judge that fifty-eight girls of her
      acquaintance had had one or more sex experiences without a
      single pregnancy resulting--were matched by the gossip
      current in many a town. Whether prostitution increased or
      decreased during the decade is likewise uncertain; but
      certain it is that the prostitute was faced for the first
      time with an amateur competition of formidable proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the amount of outright infidelity among married
      couples, one is again without reliable data, the private
      relations of men and women being happily beyond the reach
      of the statistician. The divorce rate, however, continued
      its steady increase; for every 100 marriages there were 8.8
      divorces in 1910, 13.4 divorces in 1920, and 16.5 divorces
      in 1928--almost one divorce for every six marriages. There
      was a corresponding decline in the amount of disgrace
      accompanying divorce. In the urban communities men and
      women who had been divorced were now socially accepted
      without question; indeed, there was often about the
      divorced person just enough of an air of unconventionality,
      just enough of a touch of scarlet, to be considered rather
      dashing and desirable. Many young women probably felt as
      did the New York girl who said, toward the end of the
      decade, that she was thinking of marrying Henry, although
      she didn't care very much for him, because even if they
      didn't get along she could get a divorce and "it would be
      much more exciting to be a divorcée than to be an old
      maid."

      The petting party, which in the first years of the decade
      had been limited to youngsters in their teens and twenties,
      soon made its appearance among older men and women: when
      the gin-flask was passed about the hotel bedroom during a
      dance, or the musicians stilled their saxophones during the
      Saturday-night party at the country club, men of affairs
      and women with half-grown children had their little taste
      of raw sex. One began to hear of young girls, intelligent
      and well born, who had spent week-ends with men before
      marriage and had told their prospective husbands everything
      and had been not merely forgiven, but told that there was
      nothing to forgive; a little "experience," these men felt,
      was all to the good for any girl. Millions of people were
      moving toward acceptance of what a <i>bon-vivant</i> of
      earlier days had said was his idea of the proper state of
      morality--"A single standard, and that a low one."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be easy, of course, to match every one of these
      cases with contrasting cases of men and women who still
      thought and behaved at the end of the decade exactly as the
      president of the Epworth League would have wished. Two
      women who conducted newspaper columns of advice in affairs
      of the heart testified that the sort of problem which was
      worrying young America, to judge from their bulging
      correspondence, was not whether to tell the boyfriend about
      the illegitimate child, but whether it was proper to invite
      the boyfriend up on the porch if he hadn't yet come across
      with an invitation to the movies, or whether the cake at a
      pie social should be cut with a knife. In the hinterlands
      there was still plenty of old-fashioned sentimental
      thinking about sex, of the sort which expressed itself in
      the slogan of a federated women's club: "Men are God's
      trees, women are His flowers." There were frantic efforts
      to stay the tide of moral change by law, the most
      picturesque of these efforts being the ordinance actually
      passed in Norphelt, Arkansas, in 1925, which contained the
      following provisions:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Section 1. Hereafter it shall be unlawful for any man and
      woman, male or female, to be guilty of committing the act
      of sexual intercourse between themselves at any place
      within the corporate limits of said town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Section 3. Section One of this ordinance shall not apply
      to married persons as between themselves, and their husband
      and wife, unless of a grossly improper and lascivious
      nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there was an unmistakable and rapid trend
      away from the old American code toward a philosophy of sex
      relations and of marriage wholly new to the country: toward
      a feeling that the virtues of chastity and fidelity had
      been rated too highly, that there was something to be said
      for what Mrs. Bertrand Russell defined as "the right,
      equally shared by men and women, to free participation in
      sex experience," that it was not necessary for girls to
      deny themselves this right before marriage or even for
      husbands and wives to do so after marriage. It was in
      acknowledgment of the spread of this feeling that Judge
      Lindsay proposed, in 1927, to establish "companionate
      marriage" on a legal basis. He wanted to legalize birth
      control (which, although still outlawed, was by this time
      generally practiced or believed in by married couples in
      all but the most ignorant classes) and to permit legal
      marriage to be terminated at any time in divorce by mutual
      consent, provided there were no children. His suggestion
      created great consternation and was widely and vigorously
      denounced; but the mere fact that it was seriously debated
      showed how the code of an earlier day had been shaken. The
      revolution in morals was in full swing.

      A time of revolution, however, is an uneasy time to live
      in. It is easier to tear down a code than to put a new one
      in its place, and meanwhile there is bound to be more or
      less wear and tear and general unpleasantness. People who
      have been brought up to think that it is sinful for women
      to smoke or drink, and scandalous for sex to be discussed
      across the luncheon table, and unthinkable for a young girl
      to countenance strictly dishonorable attentions from a man,
      cannot all at once forget the admonitions of their
      childhood. It takes longer to hard-boil a man or a woman
      than an egg. Some of the apostles of the new freedom
      appeared to imagine that habits of thought could be changed
      overnight, and that if you only dragged the secrets of sex
      out into the daylight and let everyone do just as he
      pleased at the moment, society would at once enter upon a
      state of barbaric innocence like that of the remotest South
      Sea Islanders. But it couldn't be done. When you drag the
      secrets of sex out into the daylight, the first thing that
      the sons and daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Grundy do is to fall
      all over themselves in the effort to have a good look, and
      for a time they can think of nothing else. If you let every
      one do just as he pleases, he is as likely as not to begin
      by making a nuisance of himself. He may even shortly
      discover that making a nuisance of himself is not, after
      all, the recipe for lasting happiness. So it happened when
      the old codes were broken down in the Postwar Decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most striking results of the revolution was a
      widely pervasive obsession with sex. To listen to the
      conversation of some of the sons and daughters of Mr. and
      Mrs. Grundy was to be reminded of the girl whose father
      said that she would talk about anything; in fact, she
      hardly ever talked about anything else. The public attitude
      toward any number of problems of the day revealed this
      obsession: to give a single example, the fashionable
      argument against women's colleges at this period had
      nothing to do with the curriculum or with the intellectual
      future of the woman graduate, but pointed out that living
      with girls for four years was likely to distort a woman's
      sex life. The public taste in reading matter revealed it:
      to say nothing of the sex magazines and the tabloids and
      the acres of newspaper space devoted to juicy scandals like
      that of Daddy Browning and his Peaches, it was significant
      that almost every one of the novelists who were ranked most
      highly by the postwar intellectuals was at outs with the
      censors, and that the Pulitzer Prize juries had a hard time
      meeting the requirement that the prize-winning novel should
      "present the wholesome atmosphere of American life and the
      highest standard of American manners and manhood," and
      finally had to alter the terms of the award, substituting
      "whole" for "wholesome" and omitting reference to "highest
      standards." There were few distinguished novels being
      written which one could identify with a "wholesome
      atmosphere" without making what the Senate would call
      interpretive reservations. Readers who considered
      themselves "modern-minded" did not want them: they wanted
      the philosophical promiscuity of Aldous Huxley's men and
      women, the perfumed indiscretions of Michael Arlen's
      degenerates, Ernest Hemingway's unflinching account of the
      fleeting amours of the drunken Brett Ashley, Anita Loos's
      comedy of two kept women and their gentlemen friends,
      Radclyffe Hall's study of homosexuality. Young men and
      women who a few years before would have been championing
      radical economic or political doctrines were championing
      the new morality and talking about it everywhere and
      thinking of it incessantly. Sex was in the limelight, and
      the Grundy children could not turn their eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another result of the revolution was that manners became
      not merely different, but--for a few years--unmannerly. It
      was no mere coincidence that during this decade
      hostesses--even at small parties--found that their guests
      couldn't be bothered to speak to them on arrival or
      departure, that "gatecrashing" at dances became an accepted
      practice; that thousands of men and women made a point of
      not getting to dinners within half an hour of the appointed
      time lest they seem insufficiently <i>blasé;</i> that house
      parties of flappers and their wide-trousered swains left
      burning cigarettes on the mahogany tables, scattered ashes
      light-heartedly on the rugs, took the porch cushions out in
      the boats and left them there to be rained on, without
      apology; or that men and women who had had--as the old
      phrase went--"advantages" and considered themselves highly
      civilized, absorbed a few cocktails and straightway turned
      a dinner party into a boisterous rout, forgetting that a
      general roughhouse was not precisely the sign of a return
      to the Greek idea of the good life. The old bars were down,
      no new ones had been built, and meanwhile the pigs were in
      the pasture. Someday, perhaps, the ten years which followed
      the war may aptly be known as the Decade of Bad Manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it easy to throw overboard the moral code and
      substitute another without confusion and distress. It was
      one thing to proclaim that married couples should be free
      to find sex adventure wherever they pleased and that
      marriage was something independent of such casual sport; it
      was quite another thing for a man or woman in whom the
      ideal of romantic marriage had been ingrained since early
      childhood to tolerate infidelities when they actually took
      place. Judge Lindsay told the story of a woman who had made
      up her mind that her husband might love whom he pleased;
      she would be modern and think none the less of him for it.
      But whenever she laid eyes on her rival she was physically
      sick. Her mind, she discovered, was hard-boiled only on the
      surface. That woman had many a counterpart during the
      revolution in morals; behind the grim statistics of divorce
      there was many a case of husband and wife experimenting
      with the new freedom and suddenly finding that there was
      dynamite in it which wrecked that mutual confidence and
      esteem without which marriage--even for the sake of their
      children--could not be endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new code had been born in disillusionment, and beneath
      all the bravado of its exponents and the talk about
      entering upon a new era the disillusionment persisted. If
      the decade was ill-mannered, it was also unhappy. With the
      old order of things had gone a set of values which had
      given richness and meaning to life, and substitute values
      were not easily found. If morality was dethroned, what was
      to take its place? Honor, said some of the prophets of the
      new day: "It doesn't matter much what you do so long as
      you're honest about it." A brave ideal--yet it did not
      wholly satisfy; it was too vague, too austere, too
      difficult to apply. If romantic love was dethroned, what
      was to take its place? Sex? But as Joseph Wood Krutch
      explained, "If love has come to be less often a sin, it has
      also come to be less often a supreme privilege." And as
      Walter Lippmann, in <i>A Preface to Morals,</i> added after
      quoting Mr. Krutch, "If you start with the belief that love
      is the pleasure of a moment, is it really surprising that
      it yields only a momentary pleasure?" The end of the
      pursuit of sex alone was emptiness and futility--the
      emptiness and futility to which Lady Brett Ashley and her
      friends in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> were so tragically
      doomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not, to be sure, many Brett Ashleys in the
      United States during the Post-war Decade. Yet there were
      millions to whom in some degree came for a time the same
      disillusionment and with it the same unhappiness. They
      could not endure a life without values, and the only values
      they had been trained to understand were being undermined.
      Everything seemed meaningless and unimportant. Well, at
      least one could toss off a few drinks and get a kick out of
      physical passion and forget that the world was crumbling. .
      . . And so the saxophones wailed and the gin-flask went its
      rounds and the dancers made their treadmill circuit with
      half-closed eyes, and the outside world, so merciless and
      so insane, was shut away for a restless night. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes time to build up a new code. Not until the decade
      was approaching its end did there appear signs that the
      revolutionists were once more learning to be at home in
      their world, to rid themselves of their obsession with sex,
      to adjust themselves emotionally to the change in
      conventions and standards, to live the freer and franker
      life of this new era gracefully, and to discover among the
      ruins of the old dispensation a new set of enduring
      satisfactions.

      On the morning of March 4, 1921--a brilliant morning with a
      frosty air and a wind which whipped the flags of
      Washington--Woodrow Wilson, broken and bent and ill, limped
      from the White House door to a waiting automobile, rode
      down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol with the stalwart
      President-elect at his side, and returned to the bitter
      seclusion of his private house in S Street. Warren Gamaliel
      Harding was sworn in as President of the United States. The
      reign of normalcy had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      March 4, 1921: what do those cold figures mean to you? Let
      us turn back for a moment to that day and look about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war had been over for more than two years, although, as
      the Treaty of Versailles had been thrown out by the Senate
      and Woodrow Wilson had refused to compromise with the
      gentlemen at the other end of the Avenue, a technical state
      of war still existed between Germany and the United States.
      Business, having boomed until the middle of 1920, was
      collapsing into the depths of depression and dragging down
      with it the price-level which had caused so much uproar
      about the High Cost of Living. The Big Red Scare was
      gradually ebbing, although the super-patriots still raged
      and Sacco and Vanzetti had not yet come to trial before
      Judge Thayer. The Ku Klux Klan was acquiring its first few
      hundred thousand members. The Eighteenth Amendment was
      entering upon its second year, and rum-runners and
      bootleggers were beginning to acquire confidence. The sins
      of the flappers were disturbing the nation; it was at about
      this time that Philadelphia produced the "moral gown" and
      the <i>Literary Digest</i> featured a symposium entitled,
      "Is the Younger Generation in Peril?" The first radio
      broadcasting station in the country was hardly four months
      old and the radio craze was not yet. Skirts had climbed
      halfway to the knee and seemed likely to go down again, a
      crime commission had just been investigating Chicago's
      crime wave, Judge Landis had become the czar of baseball,
      Dempsey and Carpentier had signed to meet the following
      summer at Boyle's Thirty Acres, and <i>Main Street</i> and
      <i>The Outline of History</i> were becoming best sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nation was spiritually tired. Wearied by the
      excitements of the war and the nervous tension of the Big
      Red Scare, they hoped for quiet and healing. Sick of Wilson
      and his talk of America's duty to humanity, callous to
      political idealism, they hoped for a chance to pursue their
      private affairs without governmental interference and to
      forget about public affairs. There might be no such word in
      the dictionary as normalcy, but normalcy was what they
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every new administration at Washington begins in an
      atmosphere of expectant good will, but in this case the
      airs which lapped the capital were particularly bland. The
      smile of the new President was as warming as a spring thaw
      after a winter of discontent. For four long years the gates
      of the White House had been locked and guarded with
      sentries. Harding's first official act was to throw them
      open, to permit a horde of sight-seers to roam the grounds
      and flatten their noses against the executive window-panes
      and photograph one another under the great north portico;
      to permit flivvers and trucks to detour from Pennsylvania
      Avenue up the driveway and chortle right past the
      presidential front door. The act seemed to symbolize the
      return of the government to the people. Wilson had been
      denounced as an autocrat, had proudly kept his own counsel;
      Harding modestly said he would rely on the "best minds" to
      advise him, and took his oath of office upon the verse from
      Micah which asks, "What doth the Lord require of thee but
      to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with
      thy God?" Wilson had seemed to be everlastingly prying into
      the affairs of business and had distrusted most business
      men; Harding meant to give them as free a hand as possible
      "to resume their normal onward way." And finally, whereas
      Wilson had been an austere academic theorist, Harding was
      "just folks": he radiated an unaffected good nature, met
      reporters and White House visitors with a warm handclasp
      and a genial word, and touched the sentimental heart of
      America by establishing in the White House a dog named
      Laddie Boy. "The Washington atmosphere of today is like
      that of Old Home Week or a college class reunion," wrote
      Edward G. Lowry shortly after Harding took office. "The
      change is amazing. The populace is on a broad grin." An era
      of good will seemed to be beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warren Harding had two great assets, and these were already
      apparent. First, he looked as a President of the United
      States should. He was superbly handsome. His face and
      carriage had a Washingtonian nobility and dignity, his eyes
      were benign; he photographed well and the pictures of him
      in the rotogravure sections won him affection and respect.
      And he was the friendliest man who ever had entered the
      White House. He seemed to like everybody, he wanted to do
      favors for everybody, he wanted to make everybody happy.
      His affability was not merely the forced affability of the
      cold-blooded politician; it was transparently and
      touchingly genuine. "Neighbor," he had said to Herbert
      Hoover at their first meeting, during the war, "I want to
      be helpful." He meant it; and now that he was President, he
      wanted to be helpful to neighbors from Marion and neighbors
      from campaign headquarters and to the whole neighborly
      American public.
    </p>
    <p>
      His liabilities were not at first so apparent, yet they
      were disastrously real. Beyond the limited scope of his
      political experience he was "almost unbelievably
      ill-informed," as William Allen White put it. His mind was
      vague and fuzzy. Its quality was revealed in the clogged
      style of his public addresses, in his choice of turgid and
      maladroit language ("noninvolvement" in European affairs,
      "adhesion" to a treaty), and in his frequent attacks of
      suffix trouble ("normalcy" for normality, "betrothment" for
      betrothal). It was revealed even more clearly in his
      helplessness when confronted by questions of policy to
      which mere good nature could not find the answer. White
      tells of Harding's coming into the office of one of his
      secretaries after a day of listening to his advisers
      wrangling over a tax problem, and crying out: "John, I
      can't make a damn thing out of this tax problem. I listen
      to one side and they seem right, and then--God!--I talk to
      the other side and they seem just as right, and here I am
      where I started. I know somewhere there is a book that will
      give me the truth, but, hell, I couldn't read the book. I
      know somewhere there is an economist who knows the truth,
      but I don't know where to find him and haven't the sense to
      know him and trust him when I find him. God! What a job!"
      His inability to discover for himself the essential facts
      of a problem and to think it through made him utterly
      dependent upon subordinates and friends whose mental
      processes were sharper than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been discriminating in the choice of his friends
      and advisers, all might have been well. But discrimination
      had been left out of his equipment. He appointed Charles
      Evans Hughes and Herbert Hoover and Andrew Mellon to
      Cabinet positions out of a vague sense that they would
      provide his administration with the necessary amount of
      statesmanship, but he was as ready to follow the lead of
      Daugherty or Fall or Forbes. He had little notion of
      technical fitness for technical jobs. Offices were plums to
      him, and he handed them out like a benevolent Santa
      Claus--beginning with the boys from Marion. He made his
      brother-in-law Superintendent of Prisons; he not only kept
      the insignificant Doctor Sawyer, of Sawyer's Sanitarium at
      Marion, as his personal physician, but bestowed upon him
      what a White House announcement called a
      "brigadier-generalcy" (suffix trouble again) and deputed
      him to study the possible coordination of the health
      agencies of the government; and for Comptroller of the
      Currency he selected D. R. Crissinger, a Marion lawyer
      whose executive banking experience was limited to a few
      months as president of the National City Bank and Trust
      Company--of Marion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Harding appear to be able to distinguish between
      honesty and rascality. He had been trained in the sordid
      school of practical Ohio politics. He had served for years
      as the majestic Doric false front behind which Ohio
      lobbyists and fixers and purchasers of privilege had
      discussed their "business propositions" and put over their
      "little deals"--and they, too, followed him to Washington,
      along with the boys from Marion. Some of them he put into
      positions of power, others he saw assuming positions of
      power; knowing them intimately, he must have known--if he
      was capable of a minute's clear and unprejudiced
      thought--how they would inevitably use those positions; but
      he was too fond of his old cronies, too anxious to have
      them share his good fortune, and too muddle-minded to face
      the issue until it was too late. He liked to slip away from
      the White House to the house in H Street where the Ohio
      gang and their intimates reveled and liquor flowed freely
      without undue regard for prohibition, and a man could take
      his pleasure at the poker table and forget the cares of
      state; and the easiest course to take was not to inquire
      too closely into what the boys were doing, to hope that if
      they were grafting a little on the side they'd be
      reasonable about it and not do anything to let old Warren
      down.

      And why did he choose such company? The truth was that
      under his imposing exterior he was just a common small-town
      man, an "average sensual man," the sort of man who likes
      nothing better in the world than to be with the old bunch
      when they gather at Joe's place for an all-Saturday-night
      session, with waistcoats unbuttoned and cigars between
      their teeth and an ample supply of bottles and cracked ice
      at hand. His private life was one of cheap sex episodes; as
      one reads the confessions of his mistress, who claims that
      as President he was supporting an illegitimate baby born
      hardly a year before his election, one is struck by the
      shabbiness of the whole affair: the clandestine meetings in
      disreputable hotels, in the Senate Office Building (where
      Nan Britton believed their child to have been conceived),
      and even in a coat-closet in the executive offices of the
      White House itself. (Doubts have been cast upon the truth
      of the story told in <i>The President's Daughter,</i> but
      is it easy to imagine anyone making up out of whole cloth a
      supposedly autobiographical story compounded of such
      ignoble adventures?) Even making due allowance for the
      refraction of Harding's personality through that of Nan
      Britton, one sees with deadly clarity the essential
      ordinariness of the man, the commonness of his "Gee,
      dearie" and "Say, you darling," his being swindled out of a
      hundred dollars by card sharpers on a train ride, his naïve
      assurance to Nan, when detectives broke in upon them in a
      Broadway hotel, that they could not be arrested because it
      was illegal to detain a Senator while "en route to
      Washington to serve the people." Warren Harding's ambitious
      wife had tailored and groomed him into outward
      respectability and made a man of substance of him; yet even
      now, after he had reached the White House, the rowdies of
      the Ohio gang were fundamentally his sort. He had risen
      above them, he could mingle urbanely with their superiors,
      but it was in the smoke-filled rooms of the house in H
      Street that he was really most at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding had no sooner arrived at the White House than a
      swarm of practical politicians of the McKinley-Foraker
      vintage reappeared in Washington. Blowsy gentlemen with
      cigars stuck in their cheeks and rolls of very useful
      hundred-dollar bills in their pockets began to infest the
      Washington hotels. The word ran about that you could do
      business with the government now--if you only fixed things
      up with the right man. The oil men licked their chops; had
      they not lobbied powerfully at the Chicago convention for
      the nomination of just such a man as Harding, who did not
      take this conservation nonsense too seriously, and would
      not Harding's Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall,
      let them develop the national resources on friendly and not
      too stringent terms? The Ohio gang chuckled over the feast
      awaiting them: the chances for graft at Columbus had been a
      piker's chance compared with those which the mastery of the
      federal government would offer him. Warren Harding wanted
      to be helpful. Well, he would have a chance to be.

      The public at large, however, knew little and cared less
      about what was happening behind the scenes. Their
      eyes--when they bothered to look at all--were upon the
      well-lighted stage where the Harding Administration was
      playing a drama of discreet and seemly statesmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace with Germany, so long deferred, was made by a
      resolution signed by the President on July 2, 1921. The
      Government of the United States was put upon a unified
      budget basis for the first time in history by the passage
      of the Budget Act of 1921, and Charles G. Dawes, becoming
      Director of the Budget, entranced the newspaper-reading
      public with his picturesque language, his underslung pipe,
      and his broom-waving histrionics when he harangued the
      bureau chiefs on behalf of business efficiency. Immigration
      was restricted, being put upon a quota basis, to the
      satisfaction of labor and the relief of those who felt that
      the amount of melting being done in the melting-pot was
      disappointingly small. Congress raised the tariff, as all
      good Republican Congresses should. Secretary Mellon pleased
      the financial powers of the country by arguing for the
      lowering of the high surtaxes upon large incomes; and
      although an obstreperous Farm Bloc joined with the
      Democrats to keep the maximum surtax at 50 per cent, Wall
      Street at least felt that the Administration's heart was in
      the right place. Every foe of union labor was sure of this
      when Attorney-General Daugherty confronted the striking
      railway shopmen with an injunction worthy of Mitchell
      Palmer himself. In January, 1923, an agreement for the
      funding of the British war debt to the United States was
      made in Washington; it was shortly ratified by the Senate.
      The outstanding achievement of the Harding Administration,
      however, was undoubtedly the Washington Conference for the
      Limitation of Armaments--or, as the newspapers insisted
      upon calling it, the "Arms Parley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the war the major powers of the world had begun once
      more their race for supremacy in armament. England, the
      United States, and Japan were all building ships for dear
      life. The rivalry between them was rendered acute by the
      growing tension in the Pacific. During the war Japan had
      seized her golden opportunity for the expansion of her
      commercial empire: her rivals being very much occupied
      elsewhere, she had begun to regard China as her special
      sphere of interest and to treat it as a sort of
      protectorate where her commerce would have prior rights to
      that of other nations. Her hand was strengthened by an
      alliance with England. When Charles Evans Hughes became
      Secretary of State and began to stand up for American
      rights in the Orient, applying once more the traditional
      American policy of the Open Door, it was soon apparent that
      the situation was ticklish. Japan wanted her own way; the
      Americans opposed it: and there lay the Philippines,
      apparently right under Japan's thumb if trouble should
      break out! All three powers. Britain, Japan, and the United
      States, would be the gainers by an amicable agreement about
      the points under dispute in the Pacific, by the
      substitution of a three-cornered agreement for the
      Japanese-British alliance, and by an arrangement for the
      limitation of fleets. Senator Borah proposed an
      international conference. Harding and Hughes took up his
      suggestion, the conference was called, and on November 12,
      1921--the day following the solemn burial of America's
      Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery--the delegates
      assembled in Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Harding opened the first session with a cordial
      if profuse speech of welcome, and true to his policy of
      leaving difficult problems to be solved by the "best
      minds," left Secretary Hughes and his associates to do the
      actual negotiating. In this case his hands-off policy
      worked well. Hughes not only had a brilliant mind, he had a
      definite program and a masterly grasp of the complicated
      issues at stake. President Harding had hardly walked out of
      Memorial Continental Hall when the Secretary of State,
      installed as chairman of the conference, began what seemed
      at first only the perfunctory address of greeting--and
      then, to the amazement of the delegates assembled about the
      long conference tables, came out with a definite and
      detailed program: a ten-year naval holiday, during which no
      capital ships should be built; the abandonment of all
      capital-shipbuilding plans, either actual or projected; the
      scrapping, by the three nations, of almost two million tons
      of ships built or building; and the limitation of
      replacement according to a 5-5-3 ratio (the American and
      British navies to be kept at parity and the Japanese at
      three-fifths of the size of each).
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the acceptance of this plan," concluded Secretary
      Hughes amid a breathless silence, "the burden of meeting
      the demands of competition in naval armament will be
      lifted. Enormous sums will be released to aid the progress
      of civilization. At the same time the proper demands of
      national defense will be adequately met and the nations
      will have ample opportunity during the naval holiday of ten
      years to consider their future course. Preparation for
      offensive naval war will stop now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this direct and specific proposal was
      prodigious. At the proposal of a naval holiday William
      Jennings Bryan, sitting among the newspapermen, expressed
      his enthusiasm with a yell of delight. At the conclusion of
      Hughes's speech the delegates broke into prolonged
      applause. It was echoed by the country and by the press of
      the world. People's imaginations were so stirred by the
      boldness and effectiveness of the Hughes plan that the
      success of the conference became almost inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three months of negotiation the delegates of Japan,
      Great Britain, and the United States had agreed upon a
      treaty which followed the general lines of the Hughes
      program; had joined with the French in an agreement to
      respect one another's insular possessions in the Pacific,
      and to settle all disagreements by conciliatory
      negotiations; had prepared the way for the withdrawal of
      Japan from Shantung and Siberia; and had agreed to respect
      the principle of the Open Door in China. The treaties were
      duly ratified by the Senate. The immediate causes of
      friction in the Pacific were removed; and although cynics
      might point out that competition in cruisers and submarines
      was little abated and that battleships were almost obsolete
      anyhow, the Naval Treaty at least lessened the burden of
      competition, as Secretary Hughes had predicted, and in
      addition set a precedent of profound importance. The
      armaments which a nation built were now definitely
      recognized as being a matter of international concern,
      subject to international agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly, then, things seemed to be going well for Warren
      Harding. He was personally popular; his friendly attitude
      toward business satisfied the conservative temper of the
      country; his Secretary of the Treasury was being referred
      to, wherever two or three bankers or industrialists
      gathered together, as the "greatest since Alexander
      Hamilton"; his Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, was
      aiding trade as efficiently as he had aided the Belgians;
      and even discouraged idealists had to admit that the
      Washington Conference had been no mean achievement. Though
      there were rumors of graft and waste and mismanagement in
      some departments of the Government, and the director of the
      Veterans' Bureau had had to leave his office in disgrace,
      and there was noisy criticism in Congress of certain leases
      of oil lands to Messrs. Doheny and Sinclair, these things
      attracted only a mild public interest. When Harding left in
      the early summer of 1923 for a visit to Alaska, few people
      realized that anything was radically wrong with his
      administration. When, on his way home, he fell ill with
      what appeared to be ptomaine poisoning, and on his arrival
      at San Francisco his illness went into pneumonia, the
      country watched the daily headlines with affectionate
      concern. And when, just as the danger appeared to have been
      averted, he died suddenly--on August 2, 1923--of what his
      physicians took to be a stroke of apoplexy, the whole
      nation was plunged into deep and genuine grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President's body was placed upon a special train, which
      proceeded across the country at the best possible speed to
      Washington. All along the route, thousands upon thousands
      of men, women, and children were gathered to see it slip
      by. Cowboys on the Western hills dismounted and stood
      uncovered as the train passed. In the cities the throngs of
      mourners were so dense that the engineer had to reduce his
      speed and the train fell hours behind schedule. "It is
      believed," wrote a reporter for the <i>New York Times,</i>
      "to be the most remarkable demonstration in American
      history of affection, respect, and reverence for the dead."
      When Warren Harding's body, after lying in state at
      Washington, was taken to Marion for burial, his successor
      proclaimed a day of public mourning, business houses were
      closed, memorial services were held from one end of the
      country to the other, flags hung at half mast, and
      buildings were draped in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innumerable speeches made that day expressed no merely
      perfunctory sentiments; everywhere people felt that a
      great-hearted man, bowed down with his labors in their
      behalf, had died a martyr to the service of his country.
      The dead President was called "a majestic figure who stood
      out like a rock of consistency"; it was said that "his
      vision was always on the spiritual"; and Bishop Manning of
      New York, speaking at a memorial service in the Cathedral
      of St. John the Divine, seemed to be giving the fallen hero
      no more than his due when he cried, "If I could write one
      sentence upon his monument it would be this, 'He taught us
      the power of brotherliness.' It is the greatest lesson that
      any man can teach us. It is the spirit of the Christian
      religion. In the spirit of brotherliness and kindness we
      can solve all the problems that confront us. . . . May God
      ever give to our country leaders as faithful, as wise, as
      noble in spirit, as the one whom we now mourn."
    </p>
    <p>
      But as it happens, there are some problems--at least for a
      President of the United States--that the spirit of
      brotherliness and kindness will not alone solve. The
      problem, for example, of what to do when those to whom you
      have been all too brotherly have enmeshed your
      administration in graft, and you know that the scandal
      cannot long be concealed, and you feel your whole life-work
      toppling into disgrace. That was the problem which had
      killed Warren Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rumor that the President committed suicide by taking
      poison later gained wide currency through the publication
      of Samuel Hopkins Adams's <i>Revelry,</i> a novel largely
      based on the facts of the Harding Administration. Gaston B.
      Means, a Department of Justice detective and a member of
      the gang which revolved about Daugherty, implied only too
      clearly in <i>The Strange Death of President Harding</i>
      that the President was poisoned by his wife, with the
      connivance of Doctor Sawyer. The motive, according to
      Means, was a double one: Mrs. Harding had found out about
      Nan Britton and the illegitimate daughter and was consumed
      with a bitter and almost insane jealousy; and she had
      learned enough about the machinations of Harding's friends
      and the power that they had over him to feel that only
      death could save him from obloquy. Both the suicide theory
      and the Means story are very plausible. The ptomaine
      poisoning came, it was said, from eating crab meat on the
      presidential boat on the return from Alaska, but the list
      of supplies in the steward's pantry contained no crab meat
      and no one else in the presidential party was taken ill;
      furthermore, the fatal "stroke of apoplexy" occurred when
      the President was recovering from pneumonia, Mrs. Harding
      was apparently alone with him at the time, and the verdict
      of the physicians, not being based upon an autopsy, was
      hardly more than an expression of opinion. Yet it is not
      necessary to accept any such melodramatic version of the
      tragedy to acknowledge that Harding died a victim of the
      predicament in which he was caught. He knew too much of
      what had been going on in his administration to be able to
      face the future. On the Alaskan trip, he was clearly in a
      state of tragic fear; according to William Allen White, "he
      kept asking Secretary Hoover and the more trusted reporters
      who surrounded him what a President should do whose friends
      had betrayed him." Whatever killed him--poison or heart
      failure--did so the more easily because he had lost the
      will to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all this, of course, the country as a whole guessed
      nothing at the time. Their friend and President was dead,
      they mourned his death, and they applauded the plans of the
      Harding Memorial Association to raise a great monument in
      his honor. It was only afterward that the truth came out,
      piece by piece.

      The martyred President had not been long in his grave when
      the peculiar circumstances under which the Naval Oil
      Reserves at Teapot Dome and Elk Hills had been leased began
      to be unearthed by the Senate Committee on Public Lands,
      and there was little by little disclosed what was perhaps
      the gravest and most far-reaching scandal of the Harding
      Administration. The facts of the case, as they were
      ultimately established, were, briefly, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 1909, three tracts of oil-bearing government land had
      been legally set aside for the future hypothetical needs of
      the United States navy--as a sort of insurance policy
      against a possible shortage of oil in time of emergency.
      They were Naval Reserve No. 1, at Elk Hills, California;
      No. 2, at Buena Vista, California; and No. 3, at Teapot
      Dome, Wyoming. As time went on, it became apparent that the
      oil under these lands might be in danger of being drawn off
      by neighboring wells, the flow of oil under the earth being
      such that if you drill a well you are likely to bring up
      not only the oil from under your own land, but also that
      from under your neighbor's land. As to the extent of this
      danger to these particular properties there was wide
      disagreement; but when gushers were actually opened up
      right on the threshold of the Elk Hills Reserve, Congress
      took action. In 1920 it gave the Secretary of the Navy
      almost unlimited power to meet as he saw fit the problem of
      conserving the Reserves. Clearly there were at least two
      possible courses of action open to him. He might arrange to
      have offset wells drilled along the edge of the Reserves to
      neutralize the drainage, or he might lease the Reserves to
      private operators on condition that they store an equitable
      amount of the oil--or of fuel oil--for the future
      requirements of the national defense. Secretary Daniels
      preferred to have offset wells drilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Albert B. Fall became Secretary of the Interior
      under President Harding, he decided otherwise. During
      1921--on the eve of the Conference for the Limitation of
      Armaments--certain high officers in the navy were
      sufficiently nervous about possible trouble with Japan to
      declare that the navy must at once have fuel oil storage
      depots built and filled and ready for use at Pearl Harbor
      and other strategic points. This idea suited Mr. Fall
      perfectly. He had come into office as the ally of certain
      big oil interests, and being a politician without
      illusions, he saw a chance to do them a favor. He would
      lease the Reserves in their entirety to private operators,
      and meet the needs of the navy by using the royalty oil
      which these operators paid the Government for the purpose
      of buying fuel oil tanks and filling them with fuel oil. To
      be sure, the Secretary of the Navy alone had power to lease
      the Reserves, and Fall was not the Secretary of the Navy;
      but that was not an insuperable difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than three months after President Harding took office,
      he signed an Executive Order transferring the Reserves from
      the custody of the Secretary of the Navy to that of the
      Secretary of the Interior. On April 7, 1922, Fall secretly
      and without competitive bidding leased Reserve No. 3, the
      Teapot Dome Reserve, to Harry F. Sinclair's Mammoth Oil
      Company. On December 11, 1922, he secretly and without
      competitive bidding leased Reserve No. 1, the Elk Hills
      Reserve, to Edward F. Doheny's Pan-American Company. It has
      been argued that these leases were fair to the Government
      and that no undue profits would have accrued to the lessees
      if the contracts had been allowed to stand. It has been
      argued that the necessity for keeping secret what were
      thought of as military arrangements was sufficient excuse
      for the absence of competitive bidding and the complete
      absence of publicity. But it was later discovered that Fall
      had received from Sinclair some $260,000 in Liberty bonds,
      and that Fall had been "lent" by Doheny--without interest
      and without security--$100,000 in cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long series of Senate investigations, governmental
      lawsuits, and criminal trials which dragged out through the
      rest of the decade, the Doheny lease was voided by the
      Supreme Court as "illegal and fraudulent," the Sinclair
      lease was also voided, and Secretary Fall was found guilty
      of accepting a bribe from Doheny and sentenced to a year in
      prison. Secretary of the Navy Denby--who had amiably
      approved the transfer of the Reserves from his charge to
      that of Fall--was driven from office by public criticism.
      Paradoxically, both Doheny and Sinclair were acquitted. But
      Sinclair had to serve a double term in prison in 1929:
      first, for contempt of the Senate in refusing to answer
      questions put to him by the Committee on Public Lands, and
      second, for contempt of court in having the jury at his
      first trial shadowed by Burns detectives. (One of the
      jurors declared that a man had approached him with the
      suggestion that if he voted right he would have an
      automobile "as long as this block.")
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the bare facts of the oil lease transactions. But
      they are only a part of the story. For after the Senate
      Committee's first important disclosures, early in 1924, and
      President Coolidge's appointment of the useful Mr. Owen
      Roberts and the ornamental Ex-Senator Atlee Pomerene as a
      bi-partisan team of Government prosecutors to take whatever
      legal action might be called for on behalf of the
      Government, Messrs. Roberts and Pomerene discovered that
      certain bonds transferred by Sinclair to Fall had come from
      the exchequer of a hitherto unheard-of concern called the
      Continental Trading Company, Ltd., of Canada. And the
      history of the Continental Trading Company, Ltd., as it was
      gradually dragged to light, was not only highly sensational
      but highly illuminating as a case-study in current American
      business ethics. This is what had happened:
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 17th of November, 1921--a few months before the
      Fall-Sinclair contract was made--a little group of men
      gathered in a room at the Hotel Vanderbilt in New York for
      a business session. They included Colonel E. A. Humphreys,
      the owner of the rich Mexia oil field; Harry M. Blackmer of
      the Midwest Oil Company; James E. O'Neil of the Prairie Oil
      Company; Colonel Robert W. Stewart, chairman of the board
      of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana; and Harry F.
      Sinclair, head of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company. At
      that meeting Colonel Humphreys agreed to sell 33,333,333
      barrels of oil from his oil field at $1.50 a barrel. But he
      discovered that he was not, as he had supposed, to sell
      this oil directly to the companies represented by the other
      men present. He was asked to sell it to a concern of which
      he had never heard, a concern which had only just been
      incorporated--the Continental Trading Company, Ltd. The
      contract of sale was guaranteed on behalf of the mysterious
      Continental Company by Sinclair and O'Neil. And the
      Continental straightway resold the oil to Sinclair's and
      O'Neil's companies, not at $1.50 a barrel, <i>but at $1.75
      a barrel</i>--thereby diverting to the coffers of the
      Continental a nice profit of twenty-five cents a barrel
      which might otherwise have gone to the other companies
      whose executives were gathered together. A profit, it might
      be added, which in the course of time should amount to over
      eight million dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, it never amounted to as much as that.
      For after a year or more the Senate became unduly
      inquisitive and it was thought best to wind up the affairs
      of the Continental Trading Company, Ltd., and destroy its
      records. But before this was done, the profit of that
      little deal pulled off at the Hotel Vanderbilt had piled up
      to more than three millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these millions, as they rolled in, President Osler,
      the distinguished Canadian attorney who headed the
      Continental, purchased Liberty bonds. And the bulk of these
      bonds (after taking out a 2-per-cent share for himself) he
      turned over, in packages, to four of the gentlemen who had
      sat in on the conference at the Vanderbilt, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      To Harry M. Blackmer, approximately $763,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      To James E. O'Neil, approximately $800,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Colonel Robert W. Stewart, approximately $759,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Harry F. Sinclair, approximately $757,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      And did these gentlemen at once report to their directors
      and stockholders the receipt of the bonds and put them into
      the corporate treasuries? They did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackmer, according to the subsequent (very subsequent)
      testimony of his counsel, put his share in a safety deposit
      box at the Equitable Trust Company in New York, where in
      1928 it still remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Neil turned over his share to his company, but not until
      May, 1925.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stewart handed his share to an employee of the Standard Oil
      Company of Indiana to be held in trust for the company in
      the vaults of the company, but never told any other
      associates of this except one member of the company's legal
      staff, and never disclosed to his directors what he had
      done until 1928, when he finally turned over the bonds to
      them. The trust agreement was written in pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinclair, according to his own testimony, did not take the
      directors or officers of his company into his confidence
      until 1928, and kept his share of the bonds in a vault in
      his home. He did not keep all of them there very long,
      however, or the brave history of the Continental Trading
      Company, Ltd., might never have come to light. A goodly
      portion of them (as we have already seen) he turned over to
      Fall. Another goodly portion, amounting to $185,000, he
      "loaned" (in addition to an outright gift of $75,000), to
      the Republican National Committee, later getting back
      $100,000 of it. The "loan" was made to Will H. Hays, who
      had been chairman of the Republican National Committee
      during the Harding-Cox campaign of 1920, had later been
      appointed Postmaster-General by President Harding, and had
      finally resigned to become supervisor of morals for the
      motion-picture industry. Mr. Hays was czar of the movies by
      the time Sinclair handed him the bonds, but being a
      conscientious man, he was trying to get the 1920 Republican
      campaign debt paid off. To this end he attempted to use the
      Sinclair "loan" in a very interesting way. He and his
      lieutenants approached a number of wealthy men, potential
      donors to the cause, and told them that if they would
      contribute to meet the deficit they might have Sinclair
      bonds to the amount of their contributions. How long they
      might keep the bonds was not made clear--at least in Hays's
      testimony before the Senate Committee on Public Lands. This
      method of concealing an enormous Sinclair contribution was
      euphemistically called, by the moral supervisor of the
      movies, "using the bonds in efforts to raise money for the
      deficit."

      So much for our little lesson in governmental practice and
      in the fiduciary duties of business executives in behalf of
      their stockholders. Now let us turn to the lighter side of
      the oil scandals. Lighter, that is, for those who were in
      no way implicated. There is a certain grim humor in the
      twistings and turnings of unwilling witnesses under the
      implacable cross-examination of Senator Walsh of Montana,
      without whose resourceful work the truth might never have
      been run to earth. Some of the scenes in the
      slowly-unfolding drama of the investigations, some of the
      sojourns of interested parties on foreign shores, some of
      the odd tricks of memory revealed, are not without an
      element of entertainment. Let us go back over the record of
      that long investigation and study a few of them, item by
      item.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>Item One. Who Loaned Fall the Money?</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn of 1923--not long after Harding's lamented
      death--Senator Walsh's committee learned of a recent sudden
      rise to affluence on the part of Secretary Fall. For some
      time previously Fall had been in financial straits; he had
      not even paid his local taxes for several years. But now
      all was changed. Mr. Fall had even purchased additional
      land near his New Mexican ranch, and in this purchase had
      used a considerable number of hundred-dollar bills. The
      Walsh committee at once became bloodhounds on the scent:
      hundred-dollar bills are as exciting to investigators as
      refusals to testify or refusals to waive immunity. From
      whom had Fall been receiving money? Fall wrote the
      committee a long letter, denying absolutely that he had
      ever received a dollar from Mr. Doheny or Mr. Sinclair, and
      in tones of outraged innocence explained that he had
      received a loan of $100,000 from Edward B. McLean of
      Washington, a millionaire newspaper-owner whose ample
      hospitality Harding and his associates had often enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McLean was in Palm Beach and unable to come to
      Washington to testify about this loan. The committee might
      perhaps have been expected to let the matter go at that.
      But they did not. Mr. McLean was wanted--and it began to
      appear that he was extremely unwilling to be examined. He
      and his friends engaged in a voluminous correspondence by
      coded telegrams with his aides in Washington, discussing
      the progress of affairs in messages such as
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Haxpw sent over buy bonka and householder bonka sultry
      tkvouep prozoics sepic bepelt goal hocusing this pouted
      proponent</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Senator Walsh all too obligingly journeyed to Palm
      Beach to take McLean's testimony there. Yes, McLean had
      made a loan to Fall. But he had made it in the form of
      three checks. Secretary Fall had shortly returned the
      checks; they had not even passed through the banks, and
      there was no record whatever of the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly this brief and unusual financial transaction threw
      little light on the prosperity of the Ex-Secretary of the
      Interior or his use of cash in large denominations. Another
      explanation was necessary. Whereupon--on January 24,
      1924--the lessee of Naval Reserve No. 1, Edward L. Doheny,
      took the stand. He, too, had loaned $100,000 to Fall. The
      money had been carried from New York to Washington in a
      satchel. But the loan had nothing to do with any lease of
      oil-bearing land. It was a bona fide loan made to
      accommodate an old friend. The elderly oil magnate drew a
      touching picture of his long years of comradeship with
      Fall. Was $100,000 a rather large sum to be loaned this way
      in cash? Why, no, it was "just a bagatelle" to him. It was
      not at all unusual for him "to make a remittance that way."
      Was there a note given for the loan? Yes; Doheny would
      search for it. Later he produced it--or rather, a fragment
      of it. The signature was missing. Fearing that he might die
      and that Fall might be unduly pressed for payment by
      cold-blooded executors, Doheny had torn the note in half
      and given the part with the signature to Mrs. Doheny--and
      she had mislaid it. The explanation was perfect--though
      some years later the Supreme Court seemed to regard it with
      skepticism.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>Item Two. Six or Eight Cows</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the generous Doheny took the stand, the
      newspapers had been treated to a first-class front-page
      story. Archie Roosevelt, son of the great T. R. and brother
      of the lesser T. R. (who was Harding's Assistant Secretary
      of Navy), had come before the Walsh Committee as a
      volunteer witness. Archie Roosevelt was an officer in one
      of the Sinclair companies, and he had something to get off
      his mind. His brother had urged him to tell all. He
      (Archie) had been told by one G. D. Wahlberg, confidential
      secretary to Sinclair, that Sinclair had paid $68,000 to
      the manager of Fall's ranch, a circumstance which, in view
      of the relentless way in which Senator Walsh was running
      down evidence, apparently had caused Wahlberg some
      uneasiness. Furthermore, Sinclair had sailed for
      Europe--not only had sailed, but had done so very quietly,
      without letting his name appear on the passenger list. The
      committee called Wahlberg. This gentleman was even more
      uneasy at the committee table than he had been in talking
      to Archie Roosevelt, but he had a charming explanation for
      what he was said to have said. Roosevelt must have
      misunderstood him. He had said nothing about $68,000. What
      he must have said was that Sinclair had sent "six or eight
      cows" to Fall's ranch. (Which was true, after a manner of
      speaking: Sinclair had indeed made a present of live stock
      to Fall; not precisely "six or eight cows," but a horse,
      six hogs, a bull, and six heifers.) You see how the
      misunderstanding arose? You see how much "sixty-eight
      thous" sounds like "six or eight cows"?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee on Public Lands did not seem to see. They
      lifted a collective eyebrow. So a little later Wahlberg
      tried again. This time his explanation was even more
      delightful. He had been consulting his memory, and had
      decided that what he must actually have said when he
      sounded as if he were talking about $68,000 going to the
      manager of the Fall ranch, or the Fall farm, was that
      $68,000 was going to the manager of the "horse farm"--by
      which he had meant the trainer at Sinclair's celebrated
      Rancocas Stables. This $68,000 represented the salary of
      Hildreth, the trainer, together with his share of the
      winnings of Zev and other Sinclair horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horse farm"--there seemed to be something less than
      idiomatic about the phrase. The collective eyebrow was not
      lowered.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p align="center">
      <i>Item Three. The Silences of Colonel Stewart</i>--<i>and
      Others</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Senate committee was hot on the trail--or rather on two
      trails. But then and thereafter the various gentlemen who
      could give it the greatest assistance in following these
      trails to the end revealed a strange reluctance to talk and
      a strange condition of memory when they did talk. Secretary
      Fall was declared by his physicians to be a "very sick man"
      who ought not to be pressed to testify. When he finally did
      testify, he refused to answer questions which might "tend
      to incriminate" him. Sinclair, as Archie Roosevelt had told
      the committee, had gone to Europe; after he returned, he
      too refused to answer questions; it was this refusal which
      led to his conviction for contempt. After his acquittal on
      the graver charge of conspiracy to defraud the government
      he at last spoke out; he admitted that he had turned over
      the bonds to Fall, but insisted that they were given in
      payment for a one-third interest in Fall's ranching and
      cattle business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackmer had gone to Europe and could not be induced to
      return. O'Neil had gone to Europe and could not be induced
      to return. Osler of the Continental Trading Company was
      somewhere at the ends of the earth. And as for Colonel
      Stewart, only the insistence of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
      induced him to come from Cuba to face the committee. When
      he did face it, early in 1928, he testified as follows: "I
      did not personally receive any of these bonds. I did not
      make one dollar out of the transaction." Less than two
      months later, after Sinclair's acquittal had somewhat
      reduced the tension, he admitted that over three-quarters
      of a million dollars' worth of these bonds had been
      delivered to him, and that he had not told the directors of
      his company about them for several years.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>Item Four. The Testimony of Mr. Hays</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In 1924 Will H. Hays, preceptor of motion-picture morality,
      was called before the Senate committee. He was asked how
      much money Sinclair had contributed to the Republican
      Party. Seventy-five thousand dollars, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1928, after the history of the Continental bonds had
      become somewhat clearer, Mr. Hays was asked to face the
      committee again. He told them the full story of Sinclair's
      "loan" of $185,000 in addition to his gift. Why had he not
      told this before? He had not been "asked about any bonds."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>Item Five. The Reticence of Mr. Mellon</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after Mr. Hays gave his second and improved
      version of the Sinclair contributions, the cashier of
      Charles Pratt &amp; Company was called before the committee
      to testify about $50,000 worth of Sinclair-Continental
      Liberty bonds which had been left by Hays with the late
      John T. Pratt, to be held against a contribution of the
      same amount--after the ingenious Hays plan--by Mr. Pratt to
      the Republican Committee. The cashier produced a card on
      which Mr. Pratt had noted the disposal of the bonds and the
      payment of his contribution. And in the corner of this card
      was a minute notation in pencil, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <center>
      <table summary="">
        <tr>
          <td align="left" colspan="2">
            <i>$50,000</i>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="left">
            <i>Andy</i>
          </td>
          <td align="right">
            <i>          Weeks</i>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="left" colspan="2">
            <i>DuPont</i>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="left" colspan="2">
            <i>Butler</i>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Walsh examined the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Senator Walsh:</i> I can make out "Weeks," and I can
      make out "DuPont," and I can make out "Butler," but what is
      this other name? It looks like Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Cashier (using a magnifying glass):</i> It's Weeks,
      DuPont, Butler, and the other name must be Candy. . . .
      Yes, it might be Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Senator Nye:</i> And who is Andy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Cashier:</i> I have no idea who Andy can be. I can
      think of no one known as Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a roar from the crowd in the room. Everybody knew
      who Andy must be. Senator Walsh dispatched a note to Andrew
      W. Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury, to ask him if he
      could explain the notation. This Mr. Mellon obligingly did
      without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in 1923, Mr. Mellon explained--at just about the time
      when the Teapot Dome investigation was getting under
      way--Hays had sent him some bonds. "When Mr. Hays called
      shortly thereafter, he told me that he had received the
      bonds from Mr. Sinclair and suggested that I hold the bonds
      and contribute an equal amount to the fund. This I declined
      to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary had acted with strict integrity. He had sent
      the bonds back, and instead of following Hays's suggestion
      he had made an outright contribution of $50,000. He added
      that he had "had no knowledge of what has developed since,
      that is, of the Teapot Dome lease matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps worth noting, however, that this testimony
      was given in 1928. For more than three years not only the
      Senate committee, but Messrs. Roberts and Pomerene, the
      public attorneys appointed by President Coolidge to
      prosecute the government suits, had been trying to discover
      just what had become of the Continental bonds, and during
      all that time the Secretary of the Treasury was aware that
      in 1923 he had been offered Liberty bonds which came from
      Sinclair. He said nothing until that little card turned up
      with Andy (or possibly Candy) penciled on it. A small
      matter, perhaps; but surely it revealed the Secretary as a
      paragon of reticence when his testimony might cast
      discredit on the money-raising methods of his party.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Thus comes to an end--as of this writing, at least--the
      remarkable story of Teapot Dome and Elk Hills and the
      Continental Trading Company, Ltd. The Executive Order
      transferring the leases, which may be said to have begun it
      all, was promulgated in June, 1921, when Harding was new in
      office, and the Stillman divorce trial was impending, and
      Dempsey was preparing to meet Carpentier, and young Charles
      Lindbergh had not yet taken his first ride in an airplane.
      By the time Sinclair and Stewart had told their stories and
      Hays had revised himself and Secretary Mellon had overcome
      his reticence, Lindbergh had flown to Europe and Herbert
      Hoover was corralling delegates for the Republican
      nomination; by the time Harry Sinclair emerged from his
      unwelcome term of service as apothecary in the Washington
      jail, the bull market had come down in ruin and the
      Post-war Decade was dying. Secretary Fall's term as
      guardian of the national resources for the Harding
      Administration had been brief, but the aftermath had been
      as long and harrowing as it was instructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes--there is one more thing to add. The oil: what
      became of the oil that started it all, the oil that the
      patriots of the Navy Department had been so anxious to have
      immediately available in case of trouble in the Pacific?
      There had been a good deal of excitement about bonds and
      hundred-thousand-dollar loans, but everybody seemed to have
      forgotten about that oil. Production in the properties
      leased to Sinclair and Doheny was stopped; but you may
      recall that the danger of drainage into neighboring wells
      had been much discussed in 1921. The neighboring wells went
      right on producing, and it is said that part of the oil
      from them--including, in all probability, some drawn from
      within the Reserves--was sold to the Japanese Government!

      The oil cases were the aristocrats among the scandals of
      the Harding Administration, but there were other scandals
      juicier and more reeking. Let us hold our noses for a
      moment and examine a few of them briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, for example, the almost incredible extravagance
      and corruption of the Veterans' Bureau under Charles R.
      Forbes, a buccaneer of fortune (and one-time deserter from
      the army) whom Harding had fallen in with on a visit to
      Hawaii. Harding was so taken with Forbes that in 1921 he
      put him in charge of the Government's work for those
      disabled war heroes in whose behalf every public man
      considered it his duty to shed an appreciative tear. Forbes
      held office for less than two years, and during that time
      it was estimated that over two hundred million dollars went
      astray in graft and flagrant waste on the part of his
      Bureau. Forbes went on a notorious junket through the
      country, supposedly selecting hospital sites which in
      reality had already been chosen. His Bureau let contracts
      for veterans' hospitals almost without regard for price;
      for instance, a contract for a hospital at Northampton was
      let to a firm which asked some thirty thousand dollars more
      than the lowest bidder. It was charged that Forbes had an
      arrangement with the builders of some hospitals whereby he
      was to pocket a third of the profits. Preposterous
      purchases of hospital supplies were made: the Veterans'
      Bureau bought $70,000 worth of floor wax and floor cleaner,
      for instance--enough, it was said, to last a hundred
      years--and for the cleaner it paid 98 cents a gallon,
      although expert testimony later brought out the fact that
      it was worth less than 4 cents a gallon exclusive of the
      water which it contained. Quantities of surplus goods were
      sold with the same easy disregard for price: 84,000
      brand-new sheets which had cost $1.37 each were sold at 26
      or 27 cents apiece, although at that very moment the Bureau
      was purchasing 25,000 new ones at $1.03 apiece. "At one
      time," reported Bruce Bliven, "sheets just bought were
      actually going in at one end of the warehouse [at
      Perryville, Maryland] as the ones just sold were going out
      the other, and some of them by mistake went straight in and
      out again." More than 75,000 towels which had cost 19 cents
      each were sold for 3 cents each. These few facts are enough
      to show with what generous abandon Forbes spent the money
      appropriated to care for the defenders of the Republic.
      Forbes went to Leavenworth in 1926 for fraud.

      There was rampant graft in the office of the Alien Property
      Custodian as well. Gaston B. Means has charged that
      attorneys who came to Washington to file claims for the
      return of properties taken over from Germans during the war
      were advised to consult a Boston lawyer named Thurston,
      that Thurston would charge them a big fee for his services,
      the claim would be allowed, and the fee would be split with
      those in authority. Be that as it may, the evidence brought
      out in the American Metal Company case was sufficient to
      indicate the sort of transaction which was permitted to
      take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American Metal Company was an internationally-owned
      concern 49 per cent of whose stock had been taken over by
      the Alien Property Custodian during the war on the ground
      that it belonged to Germans. This stock had been sold for
      $6,000,000. In 1921 a certain Richard Merton appeared at
      the Custodian's office with the claim that this 49 per cent
      had not been German, but Swiss, and that the Swiss owners,
      whom he represented, should be reimbursed. The claim was
      allowed after Merton had paid $441,000 in Liberty bonds to
      John T. King, Republican National Committeeman from
      Connecticut, for "services" which consisted of introducing
      him to Colonel T. W. Miller, the Custodian, and to Jess
      Smith, Attorney-General Daugherty's man Friday. It was
      brought out at Miller's trial that at least $200,000 of
      this $441,000 was paid over to Jess Smith "for expediting
      the claim through his acquaintance in Washington"; that Mal
      S. Daugherty, brother of the Attorney-General, sold at
      least $40,000 worth of Merton Liberty bonds and shortly
      thereafter deposited $49,165 to his brother's account; and
      that Colonel Miller also got a share of the money. Miller
      was convicted in 1927 of conspiracy to defraud the
      Government of his unbiased services and was sentenced to
      eighteen months in prison. Daugherty was also brought to
      trial, but got off. After two juries had been unable to
      agree as to his guilt or innocence, the indictment against
      him was dismissed--but not before it had been brought out
      that in 1925 this former chief legal officer of the
      Government had gone to his brother's bank at Washington
      Court House, Ohio, and had taken out and burned the ledger
      sheets covering his own account there, and his brother's
      account, and another account known as "Jesse Smith Extra."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the grand jury investigation which preceded
      the American Metal Company case that Harding's
      Attorney-General wrote the remarkable statement which
      appears at the head of this chapter. During his trial
      Daugherty failed to take the stand in his own defense, and
      his attorney, Max Steuer, later explained this failure in
      another equally remarkable statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not anything connected with this case which
      impelled him to refrain from so doing. . . . He feared . .
      . that Mr. Buckner would cross-examine him about matters
      political that would not involve Mr. Daugherty, concerning
      which he knew and as to which he would never make
      disclosure. . . . If the jury knew the real reason for
      destroying the ledger sheets they would commend rather than
      condemn Mr. Daugherty, but he insisted on silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Could there be more deliberate implication that Harding's
      Attorney-General could not tell the truth for fear of
      blackening the reputation of his dead chief? Call
      Daugherty's silence, if you wish, the silence of loyalty,
      or call those statements an effort to hide behind the dead
      President; in either case the Harding Administration
      appears in a strange light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charges still more damaging were boldly made by Gaston B.
      Means in 1930. He stated that as a henchman of the Ohio
      gang he used to engage two adjoining rooms at a New York
      hotel for the collection of prohibition graft from
      bootleggers who were willing to pay for federal protection;
      that he would place a big goldfish-bowl in one of the
      rooms, on a table which he could see by peeping through the
      door from the next room that each bootlegger would come at
      his appointed hour and minute and leave in the bowl huge
      amounts of cash in thousand-dollar or five-hundred-dollar
      bills; that as soon as the bootlegger left, Means would
      enter, count the money, and check off the contribution; and
      that in this way he collected a total of fully seven
      million dollars which he turned over to Jess Smith, the
      collector-in-chief for the Ohio Gang, who shared an
      apartment in Washington with Attorney-General Daugherty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Means further asserted that the swag from this and other
      forms of graft was kept hidden--many thousand dollars at a
      time--in a metal box buried in the back yard of the house
      which he occupied at 903 Sixteenth Street in Washington; he
      described this house and yard as being protected with a
      high wire fence and fitted out with a code signal system
      and other secret devices such as would delight a gang of
      small boys playing pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess Smith committed suicide--at least that was the
      official verdict--in 1923 in the apartment which he shared
      with Harry Daugherty. Means claimed that just before this
      tragedy took place, the gang had discovered that
      Smith--like the careful shopkeeper he had been before he
      was brought to Washington by Daugherty to occupy a desk in
      the Department of Justice--had kept a record of all the
      cash which had passed through his hands, and that Smith,
      terrified at the thought of his guilt and his secret
      knowledge, had been playing with the idea of turning
      state's witness against the gang. According to Means, the
      gang thereupon decided that Smith must be disposed of.
      Although Smith was afraid of firearms, he was persuaded to
      purchase a revolver on one of his trips to Ohio. And the
      "suicide" which followed--so Means plainly indicated, as
      many others had already suspected--was no suicide at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Means drew attention to the astonishing mortality
      among those who had been in on the secrets of the gang. Not
      only had Smith dropped out of the picture, but also John T.
      King (who had received the Merton bonds), C. F. Hately (a
      Department of Justice agent), C. F. Cramer (attorney for
      the Veterans' Bureau), Thurston (the Boston lawyer who
      represented many clients before the Alien Property
      Custodian), T. B. Felder (attorney for the Harding group),
      President Harding, Mrs. Harding, and General Sawyer. They
      had all died--most of them suddenly--within a few years of
      the end of the Harding Administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how much or how little credence one may give to
      these latter charges and their implications, the proved
      evidence is enough to warrant the statement that the
      Harding Administration was responsible in its short two
      years and five months for more concentrated robbery and
      rascality than any other in the whole history of the
      Federal Government.

      And how did the American people take these disclosures? Did
      they rise in wrath to punish the offenders?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the oil scandals were first spread across the front
      pages of the newspapers, early in 1924, there was a wave of
      excitement sufficient to force the resignations of Denby
      and Daugherty and to bring about the appointment by the new
      President, Calvin Coolidge, of special Government counsel
      to deal with the oil cases. But the harshest condemnation
      on the part of the press and the public was reserved, not
      for those who had defrauded the government, but for those
      who insisted on bringing the facts to light. Senator Walsh,
      who led the investigation of the oil scandals, and Senator
      Wheeler, who investigated the Department of Justice, were
      called by the <i>New York Tribune</i> "the Montana
      scandalmongers." The <i>New York Evening Post</i> called
      them "mud-gunners." The <i>New York Times,</i> despite its
      Democratic leanings, called them "assassins of character."
      In these and other newspapers throughout the country one
      read of the "Democratic lynching-bee" and "poison-tongued
      partisanship, pure malice, and twittering hysteria," and
      the inquiries were called "in plain words, contemptible and
      disgusting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Newspaper-readers echoed these amiable sentiments.
      Substantial businessmen solemnly informed one another that
      mistakes might have been made but that it was unpatriotic
      to condemn them and thus to "cast discredit on the
      Government," and that those who insisted on probing them to
      the bottom were "nothing better than Bolsheviki." One of
      the leading super-patriots of the land, Fred R. Marvin of
      the Key Men of America, said the whole oil scandal was the
      result of "a gigantic international conspiracy . . . of the
      internationalists, or shall we call them socialists and
      communists?" A commuter riding daily to New York from his
      suburb at this period observed that on the seven-o'clock
      train there was some indignation at the scandals, but that
      on the eight-o'clock train there was only indignation at
      their exposure and that on the nine-o'clock train they were
      not even mentioned. When, a few months later, John W.
      Davis, campaigning for the Presidency on the Democratic
      ticket, made political capital of the Harding scandals, the
      opinion of the majority seemed to be that what he said was
      in bad taste, and Davis was snowed under at the polls. The
      fact was that any relentless investigation of the scandals
      threatened to disturb, if only slightly, the <i>status
      quo,</i> and disturbance of the <i>status quo</i> was the
      last thing that the dominant business class or the country
      at large wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had voted for normalcy and they still believed in it.
      The most that they required of the United States Government
      was that it should keep its hands off business (except to
      give it a lift now and then through the imposition of
      favorable tariffs and otherwise) and be otherwise
      unobtrusive. They did not look for bold and far-seeing
      statesmanship at Washington; their idea of statesmanship on
      the part of the President was that he should let things
      alone, give industry and trade a chance to garner fat
      profits, and not "rock the boat." They realized that their
      selection of Harding had been something of a false start
      toward the realization of this modest ideal. Harding had
      been a little too hail-fellow-well-met, and his amiability
      had led him into associations which brought about
      unfortunate publicity, and unfortunate publicity had a
      tendency to rock the boat. But the basic principle remained
      sound: all the country needed now was a President who
      combined with unobtrusiveness and friendliness toward
      business an unimpeachable integrity and an indisposition to
      have his leg pulled; and this sort of President they now
      had. The inscrutable workings of Providence had placed in
      the office left vacant by Harding the precise embodiment of
      this revised presidential ideal. Calvin Coolidge was
      unobtrusive to the last degree; he would never try to steer
      the ship of state into unknown waters; and at the same time
      he was sufficiently honest and circumspect to prevent any
      unseemly revelry from taking place on the decks. Everything
      was, therefore, as it should be. Why weaken public
      confidence in Harding's party, and thus in Harding's
      successor, by going into the unfortunate episodes of the
      past? The best thing to do was to let bygones be bygones.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the years went by and the scandals which came to light
      grew in number and in scope, it began to appear that the
      "mistakes" of 1921-23 had been larger than the friends of
      normalcy had supposed when they vented their spleen upon
      Senator Walsh. But the testimony, coming out intermittently
      as it did, was confusing and hard to piece together; plain
      citizens could not keep clear in their minds such
      complicated facts as those relating to the Continental
      bonds or the Daugherty bank-accounts; and the steady
      passage of time made the later investigations seem like a
      washing of very ancient dirty linen. Business was good, the
      Coolidge variety of normalcy was working to the
      satisfaction of the country. Coolidge was honest; why dwell
      unnecessarily on the past? Resentment at the scandals and
      resentment at the scandal-mongers both gave way to a
      profound and untroubled apathy. When the full story of the
      Continental Trading Company deal became known, John D.
      Rockefeller, Jr., as a large stockholder in the Standard
      Oil of Indiana, waged war against Colonel Stewart and
      managed to put him out of the chairmanship of the company;
      but the business world as a whole seemed to find nothing
      wrong in Colonel Stewart's performance. The voice of John
      the Baptist was a voice crying in the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the reputation of the martyred President sank slowly
      and quietly lower. For years the great tomb at Marion,
      Ohio, that noble monument to which a sorrowing nation had
      so freely subscribed, remained undedicated. Clearly a
      monument to a President of the United States could hardly
      be dedicated by anybody but a President of the United
      States; Harding's successors, however, seemed to find it
      inconvenient to come to Marion for the ceremony. Late in
      1930, over seven years after Harding's death, the Harding
      Memorial Association met to consider what should be done in
      this embarrassing situation. That dauntless friend of the
      late President, Harry M. Daugherty, who had once refrained
      from testifying because he knew things "as to which he
      would never make disclosure," made a florid speech in which
      he declared that the American people had never been swayed
      "by the lip of libel or the tongue of falsehood." He
      proposed that the dedication be indefinitely postponed. The
      resolution was duly passed. Later, however, it was decided
      by those in high position that the matter could not very
      well be left in this unsatisfactory position, and that good
      Republicans had better swallow their medicine and be done
      with it. President Hoover and ex-President Coolidge
      accepted invitations to take part in the dedication of the
      tomb in June, 1931, and the dedication accordingly took
      place at last. But a certain restraint was manifest in the
      proceedings. It was not so easy in 1931 as it had been in
      1923 to compose panegyrics upon the public virtues of that
      good-natured man who had "taught us the power of
      brotherliness."

      Business was booming when Warren Harding died, and in a
      primitive Vermont farmhouse, by the light of an
      old-fashioned kerosene lamp, Colonel John Coolidge
      administered to his son Calvin the oath of office as
      President of the United States. The hopeless depression of
      1921 had given way to the hopeful improvement of 1922 and
      the rushing revival of 1923.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prices of common stocks, to be sure, suggested no
      unreasonable optimism. On August 2, 1923, the day of
      Harding's death, United States Steel (paying a five-dollar
      dividend) stood at 87, Atchison (paying six dollars) at 95,
      New York Central (paying seven) at 97, and American
      Telephone and Telegraph (paying nine) at 122; and the total
      turnover for the day on the New York Stock Exchange
      amounted to only a little over 600,000 shares. The Big Bull
      Market was still far in the future. Nevertheless the tide
      of prosperity was in full flood.

      Pick up one of those graphs with which statisticians
      measure the economic ups and downs of the Post-war Decade.
      You will find that the line of business activity rises to a
      jagged peak in 1920, drops precipitously into a deep valley
      in late 1920 and 1921, climbs uncertainly upward through
      1922 to another peak at the middle of 1923, dips somewhat
      in 1924 (but not nearly so far as in 1921), rises again in
      1925 and 1926, dips momentarily but slightly toward the end
      of 1927, and then zigzags up to a perfect Everest of
      prosperity in 1929--only to plunge down at last into the
      bottomless abyss of 1930 and 1931.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hold the graph at arm's-length and glance at it again, and
      you will see that the clefts of 1924 and 1927 are mere
      indentations in a lofty and irregular plateau which reaches
      from early 1923 to late 1929. That plateau represents
      nearly seven years of unparalleled plenty; nearly seven
      years during which men and women might be disillusioned
      about politics and religion and love, but believed that at
      the end of the rainbow there was at least a pot of
      negotiable legal tender consisting of the profits of
      American industry and American salesmanship; nearly seven
      years during which the businessman was, as Stuart Chase put
      it, "the dictator of our destinies," ousting "the
      statesman, the priest, the philosopher, as the creator of
      standards of ethics and behavior" and becoming "the final
      authority on the conduct of American society." For nearly
      seven years the prosperity band-wagon rolled down Main
      Street.

      Not everyone could manage to climb aboard this wagon.
      Mighty few farmers could get so much as a fingerhold upon
      it. Some dairymen clung there, to be sure, and
      fruit-growers and truck-gardeners. For prodigious changes
      were taking place in the national diet as the result of the
      public's discovery of the useful vitamin, the propaganda
      for a more varied menu, and the invention of better methods
      of shipping perishable foods. Between 1919 and 1926 the
      national production of milk and milk products increased by
      one-third and that of ice-cream alone took a 45-percent
      jump. Between 1919 and 1928, as families learned that there
      were vitamins in celery, spinach, and carrots, and became
      accustomed to serving fresh vegetables the year round
      (along with fresh fruits), the acreage of nineteen
      commercial truck vegetable crops nearly doubled. But the
      growers of staple crops such as wheat and corn and cotton
      were in a bad way. Their foreign markets had dwindled under
      competition from other countries. Women were wearing less
      and less cotton. Few agricultural raw materials were used
      in the new economy of automobiles and radios and
      electricity. And the more efficient the poor farmer became,
      the more machines he bought to increase his output and thus
      keep the wolf from the door, the more surely he and his
      fellows were faced by the specter of overproduction. The
      index number of all farm prices, which had coasted from 205
      in 1920 to 116 in 1921--"perhaps the most terrible toboggan
      slide in all American agricultural history," to quote
      Stuart Chase again--regained only a fraction of the ground
      it had lost: in 1927 it stood at 131. Loudly the poor
      farmers complained, desperately they and their Norrises and
      Brookharts and Shipsteads and La Follettes campaigned for
      federal aid, and by the hundreds of thousands they left the
      farm for the cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other industries unrepresented in the triumphal
      march of progress. Coal-mining suffered, and
      textile-manufacturing, and shipbuilding, and shoe and
      leather manufacturing. Whole regions of the country felt
      the effects of depression in one or more of these
      industries. The South was held back by cotton, the
      agricultural Northwest by the dismal condition of the wheat
      growers, New England by the paralysis of the textile and
      shoe industries. Nevertheless, the prosperity bandwagon did
      not lack for occupants, and their good fortune outweighed
      and outshouted the ill fortune of those who lamented by the
      roadside.

      In a position of honor rode the automobile manufacturer.
      His hour of destiny had struck. By this time paved roads
      and repair shops and filling stations had become so
      plentiful that the motorist might sally forth for the day
      without fear of being stuck in a mudhole or stranded
      without benefit of gasoline or crippled by a dead spark
      plug. Automobiles were now made with such precision, for
      that matter, that the motorist need hardly know a spark
      plug by sight; thousands of automobile owners had never
      even lifted the hood to see what the engine looked like.
      Now that closed cars were in quantity production,
      furthermore, the motorist had no need of Spartan blood,
      even in January. And the stylish new models were a delight
      to the eye. At the beginning of the decade most cars had
      been somber in color, but with the invention of pyroxylin
      finishes they broke out (in 1925 and 1926) into a whole
      rainbow of colors, from Florentine cream to Versailles
      violet. Bodies were swung lower, expert designers sought
      new harmonies of line, balloon tires came in, and at last
      even Henry Ford capitulated to style and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any sign had been needed of the central place which the
      automobile had come to occupy in the mind and heart of the
      average American, it was furnished when the Model A Ford
      was brought out in December, 1927. Since the previous
      spring, when Henry Ford had shut down his gigantic plant,
      scrapped his Model T and the thousands of machines which
      brought it into being, and announced that he was going to
      put a new car on the market, the country had been in a
      state of suspense. Obviously he would have to make drastic
      changes. Model T had been losing to Chevrolet its
      leadership in the enormous low-priced-car market, for the
      time had come when people were no longer content with
      ugliness and a maximum speed of forty or forty-five miles
      an hour; no longer content, either, to roar slowly uphill
      with a weary left foot jammed against the low-speed pedal
      while robin's-egg blue Chevrolets swept past in second. Yet
      equally obviously Henry Ford was the mechanical genius of
      the age. What miracle would he accomplish?
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumor after rumor broke into the front pages of the
      newspapers. So intense was the interest that even the fact
      that an automobile dealer in Brooklyn had "learned
      something of the new car through a telegram from his
      brother Henry" was headline stuff. When the editor of the
      Brighton, Michigan, <i>Weekly Argus</i> actually snapped a
      photograph of a new Ford out for a trial spin,
      newspaper-readers pounced on the picture and avidly
      discussed its every line. The great day arrived when this
      newest product of the inventive genius of the age was to be
      shown to the public. The Ford Motor Company was running in
      2,000 daily newspapers a five-day series of full-page
      advertisements at a total cost of $1,300,000; and everyone
      who could read was reading them. On December 2, 1927, when
      Model A was unveiled, one million people--so the
      <i>Herald-Tribune</i> figured--tried to get into the Ford
      headquarters in New York to catch a glimpse of it; as
      Charles Merz later reported in his life of Ford, "one
      hundred thousand people flocked into the showrooms of the
      Ford Company in Detroit; mounted police were called out to
      patrol the crowds in Cleveland; in Kansas City so great a
      mob stormed Convention Hall that platforms had to be built
      to lift the new car high enough for everyone to see it." So
      it went from one end of the United States to the other.
      Thousands of orders piled up on the Ford books for Niagara
      Blue roadsters and Arabian Sand phaetons. For weeks and
      months, every new Ford that appeared on the streets drew a
      crowd. To the motor-minded American people the first
      showing of a new kind of automobile was no matter of merely
      casual or commercial interest. It was one of the great
      events of the year 1927; not so thrilling as Lindbergh's
      flight, but rivaling the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti,
      the Hall-Mills murder trial, the Mississippi flood, and the
      Dempsey-Tunney fight at Chicago in its capacity to arouse
      public excitement.

      In 1919 there had been 6,771,000 passenger cars in service
      in the United States; by 1929 there were no less than
      23,121,000. There you have possibly the most potent
      statistic of Coolidge Prosperity. As a footnote to it I
      suggest the following: even as early as the end of 1923
      there were two cars for every three families in
      "Middletown," a typical American city. The Lynds and their
      investigators interviewed 123 working-class families of
      "Middletown" and found that 60 of them had cars. Of these
      60, 26 lived in such shabby-looking houses that the
      investigators thought to ask whether they had bathtubs, and
      discovered that as many as 21 of the 26 had none. The
      automobile came even before the tub!
    </p>
    <p>
      And as it came, it changed the face of America. Villages
      which had once prospered because they were "on the
      railroad" languished with economic anæmia; villages on
      Route 61 bloomed with garages, filling stations, hot-dog
      stands, chicken-dinner restaurants, tearooms, tourists'
      rests, camping sites, and affluence. The interurban trolley
      perished, or survived only as a pathetic anachronism.
      Railroad after railroad gave up its branch lines, or saw
      its revenues slowly dwindling under the competition of
      mammoth interurban busses and trucks snorting along
      six-lane concrete highways. The whole country was covered
      with a network of passenger bus-lines. In thousands of
      towns, at the beginning of the decade a single traffic
      officer at the junction of Main Street and Central Street
      had been sufficient for the control of traffic. By the end
      of the decade, what a difference!--red and green lights,
      blinkers, oneway streets, boulevard stops, stringent and
      yet more stringent parking ordinances--and still a shining
      flow of traffic that backed up for blocks along Main Street
      every Saturday and Sunday afternoon. Slowly but surely the
      age of steam was yielding to the gasoline age.

      The radio manufacturer occupied a less important seat than
      the automobile manufacturer on the prosperity bandwagon,
      but he had the distinction of being the youngest rider. You
      will remember that there was no such thing as radio
      broadcasting to the public until the autumn of 1920, but
      that by the spring of 1922 radio had become a craze--as
      much talked about as Mah Jong was to be the following year
      or cross-word puzzles the year after. In 1922 the sales of
      radio sets, parts, and accessories amounted to $60,000,000.
      People wondered what would happen when the edge wore off
      the novelty of hearing a jazz orchestra in Schenectady or
      in Davenport, Iowa, play "Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean."
      What actually did happen is suggested by the cold figures
      of total annual radio sales for the next few years:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      1922--  $60,000,000 (as we have just seen)<br>
      1923--$136,000,000<br>
      1924--$358,000,000<br>
      1925--$430,000,000<br>
      1926--$506,000,000<br>
      1927--$425,600,000<br>
      1928--$650,550,000<br>
      1929--$842,548,000 (an increase over the 1922 figures of
      1,400 per cent!)
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Don't hurry past those figures. Study them a moment,
      remembering that whenever there is a dip in the curve of
      national prosperity there is likely to be a dip in the
      sales of almost every popular commodity. There was a dip in
      national prosperity in 1927, for instance; do you see what
      it did to radio sales? But there was also a dip in 1924, a
      worse one in fact. Yet radio sales made in that year the
      largest proportional increase in the whole period. Why?
      Well, for one thing, that was the year in which the
      embattled Democrats met at Madison Square Garden in New
      York to pick a standard-bearer, and the deadlock between
      the hosts of McAdoo and the hosts of Al Smith lasted day
      after day after day, and millions of Americans heard
      through loud-speakers the lusty cry of, "Alabama,
      twenty-four votes for Underwoo--ood!" and discovered that a
      political convention could be a grand show to listen to and
      that a seat by the radio was as good as a ticket to the
      Garden. Better, in fact; for at any moment you could turn a
      knob and get "Barney Google" or "It Ain't Gonna Rain No
      More" by way of respite. At the age of three and a half
      years, radio broadcasting had attained its majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind those figures of radio sales lies a whole chapter of
      the life of the Post-war Decade: radio penetrating every
      third home in the country; giant broadcasting stations with
      nationwide hook-ups; tenement-house roofs covered with
      forests of antennæ; Roxy and his Gang, the Happiness Boys,
      the A &amp; P Gypsies, and Rudy Vallee crooning from
      antique Florentine cabinet sets; Graham McNamee's voice,
      which had become more familiar to the American public than
      that of any other citizen of the land, shouting across your
      living room and mine: <i>"And</i> he did it! Yes, sir, he
      did it! It's a touchdown! Boy, I want to tell you this is
      one of the finest games . . ."; the Government belatedly
      asserting itself in 1927 to allocate wavelengths among
      competing radio stations; advertisers paying huge sums for
      the privilege of introducing Beethoven with a few
      well-chosen words about yeast or toothpaste; and Michael
      Meehan personally conducting the common stock of the Radio
      Corporation of America from a 1928 low of 85
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to a 1929 high of 549.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other riders on the prosperity band-wagon.
      Rayon, cigarettes, refrigerators, telephones, chemical
      preparations (especially cosmetics), and electrical devices
      of various sorts all were in growing demand. While the
      independent storekeeper struggled to hold his own, the
      amount of retail business done in chain stores and
      department stores jumped by leaps and bounds. For every
      $100 worth of business done in 1919, by 1927 the
      five-and-ten-cent chains were doing $260 worth, the cigar
      chains $153 worth, the drug chains $224 worth, and the
      grocery chains $387 worth. Mrs. Smith no longer patronized
      her "naborhood" store; she climbed into her
      two-thousand-dollar car to drive to the red-fronted chain
      grocery and save twenty-seven cents on her daily purchases.
      The movies prospered, sending their celluloid reels all
      over the world and making Charlie Chaplin, Douglas
      Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Clara Bow
      familiar figures to the Eskimo, the Malay, and the heathen
      Chinee; while at home the attendance at the motion-picture
      houses of "Middletown" during a single month (December,
      1923) amounted to four and a half times the entire
      population of the city. Men, women, and children, rich and
      poor, the Middletowners went to the movies at an average
      rate of better than once a week!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this Coolidge Prosperity real? The farmers did not
      think so. Perhaps the textile manufacturers did not think
      so. But the figures of corporation profits and wages and
      incomes left little room for doubt. Consider, for example,
      two significant facts at opposite ends of the scale of
      wealth. Between 1922 and 1927, the purchasing power of
      American wages increased at the rate of more than two per
      cent annually. And during the three years between 1924 and
      1927 alone there was a leap from 75 to 283 in the number of
      Americans who paid taxes on incomes of more than a million
      dollars a year.

    <p>
      Why did it happen? What made the United States so
      prosperous?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the reasons were obvious enough. The war had
      impoverished Europe and hardly damaged the United States at
      all; when peace came the Americans found themselves the
      economic masters of the world. Their young country, with
      enormous resources in materials and in human energy and
      with a wide domestic market, was ready to take advantage of
      this situation. It had developed mass production to a new
      point of mechanical and managerial efficiency. The Ford
      gospel of high wages, low prices, and standardized
      manufacture on a basis of the most minute division of
      machine-tending labor was working smoothly not only at
      Highland Park, but in thousands of other factories.
      Executives, remembering with a shudder the piled-up
      inventories of 1921, had learned the lesson of cautious
      hand-to-mouth buying; and they were surrounded with more
      expert technical consultants, research men, personnel
      managers, statisticians, and business forecasters than had
      ever before invaded that cave of the winds, the conference
      room. Their confidence was strengthened by their almost
      superstitious belief that the Republican Administration was
      their invincible ally. And they were all of them aided by
      the boom in the automobile industry. The phenomenal
      activity of this one part of the body economic--which was
      responsible, directly or indirectly, for the employment of
      nearly four million men--pumped new life into all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prosperity was assisted, too, by two new stimulants to
      purchasing, each of which mortgaged the future but kept the
      factories roaring while it was being injected. The first
      was the increase in installment buying. People were getting
      to consider it old-fashioned to limit their purchases to
      the amount of their cash balance; the thing to do was to
      "exercise their credit." By the latter part of the decade,
      economists figured that 15 per cent of all retail sales
      were on an installment basis, and that there were some six
      billions of "easy payment" paper outstanding. The other
      stimulant was stock-market speculation. When stocks were
      skyrocketing in 1928 and 1929 it is probable that hundreds
      of thousands of people were buying goods with money which
      represented, essentially, a gamble on the business profits
      of the nineteen-thirties. It was fun while it lasted. If
      these were the principal causes of Coolidge Prosperity, the
      salesman and the advertising man were at least its agents
      and evangels. Business had learned as never before the
      immense importance to it of the ultimate consumer. Unless
      he could be persuaded to buy and buy lavishly, the whole
      stream of six-cylinder cars, super-heterodynes, cigarettes,
      rouge compacts, and electric ice-boxes would be dammed at
      its outlet. The salesman and the advertising man held the
      key to this outlet. As competition increased their methods
      became more strenuous. No longer was it considered enough
      to recommend one's goods in modest and explicit terms and
      to place them on the counter in the hope that the ultimate
      consumer would make up his mind to purchase. The advertiser
      must plan elaborate national campaigns, consult with
      psychologists, and employ all the eloquence of poets to
      cajole, exhort, or intimidate the consumer into buying--to
      "break down consumer resistance." Not only was each
      individual concern struggling to get a larger share of the
      business in its own field, but whole industries shouted
      against one another in the public's ear. The embattled
      candy manufacturers took full-page space in the newspapers
      to reply to the American Tobacco Company's slogan of "Reach
      for a Lucky instead of a sweet." Trade journals were quoted
      by the <i>Reader's Digest</i> as reporting the efforts of
      the furniture manufacturers to make the people "furniture
      conscious" and of the clothing manufacturers to make them
      "tuxedo conscious." The salesman must have the ardor of a
      zealot, must force his way into people's houses by hook or
      by crook, must let nothing stand between him and the
      consummation of his sale. As executives put it, "You can't
      be an order-taker any longer--you've got to be a
      <i>salesman."</i> The public, generally speaking, could be
      relied upon to regard with complacence the most flagrant
      assaults upon its credulity by the advertiser and the most
      outrageous invasions of its privacy by the salesman; for
      the public was in a mood to forgive every sin committed in
      the holy name of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had such pressure been exerted upon salesmen
      to get results. Many concerns took up the quota system,
      setting as the objective for each sales representative a
      figure 20 or 25 per cent beyond that of the previous year,
      and putting it up to him to reach this figure or lose his
      employer's favor and perhaps his job. All sorts of sales
      contests and other ingenious devices were used to stimulate
      the force. Among the schemes suggested by the Dartnell
      Company of Chicago, which had more than ten thousand
      American business organizations subscribing to its service,
      was that of buying various novelties and sending them to
      the salesman at weekly intervals: one week a miniature
      feather duster with a tag urging him to "dust his
      territory," another week an imitation cannon cracker with
      the injunction to "make a big noise," and so on. The
      American Slicing Machine Company offered a turkey at
      Christmas to every one of its salesmen who beat his quota
      for the year. "We asked each man," explained the sales
      manager afterward, "to appoint a child in his family as a
      mascot, realizing that every one of them would work his
      head off to make some youngster happy at Christmas. The way
      these youngsters took hold of the plan was amusing, and at
      times the intensity of their interest was almost pathetic."
      The sales manager of another concern reported cheerfully
      that "one of his stunts" was "to twit one man at the good
      work of another until he is almost sore enough to be ready
      to fight." And according to Jesse Rainsford Sprague, still
      another company invented--and boasted of--a method of
      goading its salesmen which for sheer inhumanity probably
      set a record for the whole era of Coolidge Prosperity. It
      gave a banquet at which the man with the best score was
      served with oysters, roast turkey, and a most elaborate
      ice; the man with the second best score had the same dinner
      but without the oysters; and so on down to the man with the
      worst score, before whom was laid a small plate of boiled
      beans and a couple of crackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the salesman was sometimes under pressure such as this,
      it is not surprising that the consumer felt the pressure,
      too. Let two extreme instances (both cited by Jesse
      Rainsford Sprague) suffice to suggest the trend in business
      methods. A wholesale drug concern offered to the trade a
      small table with a railing round its top for the display of
      "specials"; it was to be set up directly in the path of
      customers, "whose attention," according to <i>Printer's
      Ink,</i> "will be attracted to the articles when they fall
      over it, bump into it, kick their shins upon it, or
      otherwise come in contact with it." And <i>Selling News</i>
      awarded one of its cash prizes for "sales ideas" to a
      vender of electric cleaners who told the following story of
      commercial prowess. One day he looked up from the street
      and saw a lady shaking a rug out of a second-story window.
      "The door leading to her upstairs rooms was open. I went
      right in and up those stairs without knocking, greeting the
      lady with the remark: 'Well, I am here right on time. What
      room do you wish me to start in?' She was very much
      surprised, assuring me that I had the wrong number. But
      during my very courteous apologies I had managed to get my
      cleaner connected and in action. The result was that I
      walked out minus the cleaner, plus her contract and check
      for a substantial down payment." The readers of <i>Selling
      News</i> were apparently not expected to be less than
      enthusiastic at the prospect of a man invading a woman's
      apartment and setting up a cleaner in it without permission
      and under false pretenses. For if you could get away with
      such exploits, it helped business, and good business helped
      prosperity, and prosperity was good for the country.

      The advertisers met the competition of the new era with
      better design, persuasively realistic photographs, and
      sheer volume: the amount of advertising done in 1927,
      according to Francis H. Sisson, came to over a billion and
      a half dollars. They met it with a new frankness,
      introducing to staid magazine readers the advantages of
      Odo-ro-no and Kotex. And they met it, furthermore, with a
      subtle change in technique. The copywriter was learning to
      pay less attention to the special qualities and advantages
      of his product, and more to the study of what the mass of
      unregenerate mankind wanted--to be young and desirable, to
      be rich, to keep up with the Joneses, to be envied. The
      winning method was to associate his product with one or
      more of these ends, logically or illogically, truthfully or
      cynically; to draw a lesson from the dramatic case of some
      imaginary man or woman whose fate was altered by the use of
      X's soap, to show that in the most fashionable circles
      people were choosing the right cigarette in blindfold
      tests, or to suggest by means of glowing
      testimonials--often bought and paid for--that the
      advertised product was used by women of fashion, movie
      stars, and non-stop flyers. One queen of the films was said
      to have journeyed from California all the way to New York
      to spend a single exhausting day being photographed for
      testimonial purposes in dozens of costumes and using dozens
      of commercial articles, many of which she had presumably
      never laid eyes on before--and all because the appearance
      of these testimonials would help advertise her newest
      picture. Of what value were sober facts from the
      laboratory: did not a tooth-powder manufacturer try to meet
      the hokum of emotional toothpaste advertising by citing
      medical authorities, and was not his counter-campaign as a
      breath in a gale? At the beginning of the decade
      advertising had been considered a business; in the early
      days of Coolidge Prosperity its fulsome prophets were
      calling it a profession; but by the end of the decade many
      of its practitioners, observing the overwhelming victory of
      methods taken over from tabloid journalism, were beginning
      to refer to it--among themselves--as a racket.

      A wise man of the nineteen-twenties might have said that he
      cared not who made the laws of the country if he only might
      write its national advertising. For here were the sagas of
      the age, romances and tragedies depicting characters who
      became more familiar to the populace than those in any
      novel. The man who distinctly remembered Mr. Addison Sims
      of Seattle. . . . The four out of five who, failing to use
      Forhan's, succumbed to pyorrhea, each of them with a white
      mask mercifully concealing his unhappy mouth. . . . The
      pathetic figure of the man, once a golf champion, "now only
      a wistful onlooker" creeping about after the star players,
      his shattered health due to tooth neglect. . . . The poor
      fellow sunk in the corner of a taxicab, whose wife
      upbraided him with not having said a word all evening (when
      he might so easily have shone with the aid of the <i>Elbert
      Hubbard Scrap Book). . . .</i> The man whose conversation
      so dazzled the company that the envious dinner-coated
      bystanders could only breathe in amazement, "I think he's
      quoting from Shelley." . . . The woman who would
      undoubtedly do something about B. O. if people only said to
      her what they really thought. . . . The man whose friends
      laughed when the waiter spoke to him in French. . . . The
      girl who thought filet mignon was a kind of fish. . . . The
      poor couple who faced one another in humiliation after
      their guests were gone, the wife still holding the door
      knob and struggling against her tears, the husband biting
      his nails with shame (When Your Guests Are Gone--Are You
      Sorry You Ever Invited Them? . . . Be Free From All
      Embarrassment! Let the Famous <i>Book of Etiquette</i> Tell
      You Exactly What to Do, Say, Write, or Wear on Every
      Occasion). . . . The girl who merely carried the daisy
      chain, yet she had athlete's foot. . . . These men and
      women of the advertising pages, suffering or triumphant,
      became a part of the folklore of the day.

      Sometimes their feats were astonishing. Consider, for
      example, the man who had purchased Nelson Doubleday's
      <i>Pocket University,</i> and found himself, one evening,
      in a group in which some one mentioned Ali Baba:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Ali Baba? I sat forward in my chair. I could tell them all
      about this romantic, picturesque figure of fiction.<br>
      <br>
      "I don't know how it happened, but they gathered all around
      me. And I told them of golden ships that sailed the seven
      seas, of a famous man and his donkey who wandered unknown
      ways, of the brute-man from whom we are all descended. I
      told them things they never knew of Cleopatra, of the
      eccentric Diogenes, of Romulus and the founding of Rome. I
      told them of the unfortunate death of Sir Raleigh
      <i>(sic),</i> of the tragic end of poor Anne Boleyn. . .
      .<br>

      Skeptics might smile, thanking themselves that they were
      not of the company on that interminable evening; but the
      advertisement stuck in their minds. And to others, less
      sophisticated, it doubtless opened shining vistas of
      delight. They, too, could hold the dinner party spellbound
      if only they filled out the coupon. . . .

      By far the most famous of these dramatic advertisements of
      the Postwar Decade was the long series in which the awful
      results of halitosis were set forth through the depiction
      of a gallery of unfortunates whose closest friends would
      not tell them. "Often a bridesmaid but never a bride. . . .
      Edna's case was really a pathetic one." . . . "Why did she
      leave him that way?" . . . <i>"That's</i> why you're a
      failure," . . . and then that devilishly ingenious display
      which capitalized on the fears aroused by earlier tragedies
      in the series: the picture of a girl looking at a Listerine
      advertisement and saying to herself, "This <i>can't</i>
      apply to me!" Useless for the American Medical Association
      to insist that Listerine was "not a true deodorant," that
      it simply covered one smell with another. Just as useless
      as for the Life Extension Institute to find "one out of
      twenty with pyorrhea, rather than Mr. Forhan's famous
      four-out-of-fïve" (to quote Stuart Chase once more).
      Halitosis had the power of dramatic advertising behind it,
      and Listerine swept to greater and greater profits on a
      tide of public trepidation.

      As year followed year of prosperity, the new diffusion of
      wealth brought marked results. There had been a great boom
      in higher education immediately after the war, and the boom
      continued, although at a somewhat slackened pace, until
      college trustees were beside themselves wondering how to
      find room for the swarming applicants. There was an
      epidemic of outlines of knowledge and books of etiquette
      for those who had got rich quick and wanted to get cultured
      quick and become socially at ease. Wells's <i>Outline of
      History,</i> the best-selling non-fiction book of 1921 and
      1922, was followed by Van Loon's <i>Story of Mankind,</i>
      J. Arthur Thomson's <i>Outline of Science</i> (both of them
      best sellers in 1922), the Doubleday mail-order <i>Book of
      Etiquette</i> and Emily Post's <i>Book of Etiquette</i>
      (which led the non-fiction list in 1923), <i>Why We Behave
      Like Human Beings</i> (a big success of 1926), and <i>The
      Story of Philosophy,</i> which ran away from all other
      books in the non-fiction list of 1927.

      There was a rush of innocents abroad. According to the
      figures of the Department of Commerce, over 437,000 people
      left the United States by ship for foreign parts in the
      year 1928 alone, to say nothing of 14,000 odd who entered
      Canada and Mexico by rail, and over three million cars
      which crossed into Canada for a day or more. The innocents
      spent freely: the money that they left abroad, in fact
      (amounting in 1928 to some $650,000,000), solved for a time
      a difficult problem in international finance: how the
      United States could continue to receive interest on her
      foreign debts and foreign investments without permitting
      foreign goods to pass the high tariff barrier in large
      quantities.

      The United States became the banker and financial
      arbitrator for the world. When the financial relations
      between Germany and the Allies needed to be straightened
      out, it was General Charles G. Dawes and Owen D. Young who
      headed the necessary international commission's--not only
      because their judgment was considered wise, and impartial
      as between the countries of Europe, but because the United
      States was in a position to call the tune. Americans were
      called in to reorganize the finances of one country after
      another. American investments abroad increased by leaps and
      bounds. The squat limestone building at the corner of Broad
      and Wall Streets, still wearing the scars of the shrapnel
      which had struck it during the 1920 explosion, had become
      the undisputed financial center of the world. Only
      occasionally did the United States have to intervene by
      force of arms in other countries. The Marines ruled Haiti
      and restored order in Nicaragua; but in general the country
      extended its empire not by military conquest or political
      dictation, but by financial penetration.

      At home, one of the most conspicuous results of prosperity
      was the conquest of the whole country by urban tastes and
      urban dress and the urban way of living. The rube
      disappeared. Girls in the villages of New Hampshire and
      Wyoming wore the same brief skirts and used the same
      lipsticks as their sisters in New York. The proletariat--or
      what the radicals of the Big Red Scare days had called the
      proletariat--gradually lost its class consciousness; the
      American Federation of Labor dwindled in membership and
      influence; the time had come when workingmen owned
      second-hand Buicks and applauded Jimmy Walker, not
      objecting in the least, it seemed, to his exquisite
      clothes, his valet, and his frequent visits to the
      millionaire-haunted sands of Palm Beach. It was no accident
      that men like Mellon and Hoover and Morrow found their
      wealth an asset rather than a liability in public office,
      or that there was a widespread popular movement to make
      Henry Ford President in 1924. The possession of millions
      was a sign of success, and success was worshipped the
      country over.

      Business itself was regarded with a new veneration. Once it
      had been considered less dignified and distinguished than
      the learned professions, but now people thought they
      praised a clergyman highly when they called him a good
      businessman. College alumni, gathered at their annual
      banquets, fervently applauded the banker trustees who spoke
      of education as one of the greatest American industries and
      compared the president and the dean to business executives.
      The colleges themselves organized business courses and
      cheerfully granted credit to candidates for degrees in the
      arts and sciences for their work in advertising
      copy-writing, marketing methods, elementary stenography,
      and drug-store practice. Even Columbia University drew men
      and women into its home-study courses by a system of
      follow-up letters worthy of a manufacturer of
      refrigerators, and sent out salesmen to ring the door bells
      of those who expressed a flicker of interest; even the
      great University of Chicago made use of what André
      Siegfried has called "the mysticism of success" by heading
      an advertisement of its correspondence courses with the
      admonition to "DEVELOP POWER AT HOME, to investigate,
      persevere, achieve." . . . The Harvard Business School
      established annual advertising awards, conferring academic
      <i>éclat</i> upon well-phrased sales arguments for
      commercial products. It was not easy for the churches to
      resist the tide of business enthusiasm. The Swedish
      Immanuel Congregational Church in New York, according to an
      item in the <i>American Mercury,</i> recognized the
      superiority of the business to the spiritual appeal by
      offering to all who contributed one hundred dollars to its
      building fund "an engraved certificate of investment in
      preferred capital stock in the Kingdom of God." And a
      church billboard in uptown New York struck the same
      persuasive note: "Come to Church. Christian Worship
      Increases Your Efficiency. Christian F. Reisner, Pastor."

      In every American city and town, service clubs gathered the
      flower of the middle-class citizenry together for weekly
      luncheons noisy with good fellowship. They were growing
      fast, these service clubs. Rotary, the most famous of them,
      had been founded in 1905; by 1930 it had 150,000 members
      and boasted--as a sign of its international influence--as
      many as 3,000 clubs in 44 countries. The number of Kiwanis
      Clubs rose from 205 in 1920 to 1,800 in 1929; the Lions
      Clubs, of which the first was not formed until 1917,
      multiplied until at the end of the decade there were 1,200
      of them. Nor did these clubs content themselves with
      singing songs and conducting social-service campaigns; they
      expressed the national faith in what one of their founders
      called "the redemptive and regenerative influence of
      business." The speakers before them pictured the
      businessman as a builder, a doer of great things, yes, and
      a dreamer whose imagination was ever seeking out new ways
      of serving humanity. It was a popular note, for in hundreds
      of directors' rooms, around hundreds of conference tables,
      the American businessmen of the era of Coolidge Prosperity
      were seeing themselves as men of vision with eyes
      steadfastly fixed on the long future. At the end of the
      decade, a cartoon in the <i>New Yorker</i> represented an
      executive as saying to his heavy-jowled colleagues at one
      of these meetings: "We have ideas. Possibly we tilt at
      windmills--just seven Don Juans tilting at windmills." It
      was a perfect bit of satire on business sentimentality. The
      service club specialized in this sort of mysticism: was not
      a speaker before the Rotarians of Waterloo, Iowa, quoted by
      the <i>American Mercury</i> as declaring that "Rotary is a
      manifestation of the divine"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the association of business with religion was one
      of the most significant phenomena of the day. When the
      National Association of Credit Men held their annual
      convention at New York, there were provided for the three
      thousand delegates a special devotional service at the
      Cathedral of St. John the Divine and five sessions of
      prayer conducted by Protestant clergymen, a Roman Catholic
      priest, and a Jewish rabbi; and the credit men were
      uplifted by a sermon by Dr. S. Parkes Cadman on "Religion
      in Business." Likewise the Associated Advertising Clubs,
      meeting in Philadelphia, listened to a keynote address by
      Doctor Cadman on "Imagination and Advertising," and at the
      meeting of the Church Advertising Department the subjects
      discussed included "Spiritual Principles in Advertising"
      and "Advertising the Kingdom through Press-Radio Service."
      The fact that each night of the session a cabaret
      entertainment was furnished to the earnest delegates from
      11:30 to 2 and that part of the Atlantic City Beauty
      Pageant was presented was merely a sign that even men of
      high faith must have their fun.

      So frequent was the use of the Bible to point the lessons
      of business and of business to point the lessons of the
      Bible that it was sometimes difficult to determine which
      was supposed to gain the most from the association. Fred F.
      French, a New York builder and real-estate man, told his
      salesmen, "There is no such thing as a reason why not," and
      continued: "One evidence of the soundness of this theory
      may be found in the command laid down in Matthew vii:7 by
      the Greatest Human-nature Expert that ever lived, 'Knock
      and it shall be opened unto you.'" He continued by quoting
      "the greatest command of them all--'Love Thy Neighbor as
      Thyself'"--and then stated that by following such high
      principles the Fred F. French salesmen had "immeasurably
      strengthened their own characters and power, so that during
      this year they will serve our stockholders at a lower
      commission rate, and yet each one will earn more money for
      himself than in nineteen hundred twenty-five." In this case
      Scripture was apparently taken as setting a standard for
      business to meet--to its own pecuniary profit. Yet in other
      cases it was not so certain that business was not the
      standard, and Scripture complimented by being lifted to the
      business level.

      Witness, for example, the pamphlet on <i>Moses, Persuader
      of Men</i> issued by the Metropolitan Casualty Insurance
      Company (with an introduction by the indefatigable Doctor
      Cadman), which declared that "Moses was one of the greatest
      salesmen and real-estate promoters that ever lived," that
      he was a "Dominant, Fearless, and Successful Personality in
      one of the most magnificent selling campaigns that history
      ever placed upon its pages." And witness, finally, the
      extraordinary message preached by Bruce Barton in <i>The
      Man Nobody Knows,</i> which so touched the American heart
      that for two successive years--1925 and 1926--it was the
      best-selling non-fiction book in the United States. Barton
      sold Christianity to the public by showing its resemblance
      to business. Jesus, this book taught, was not only "the
      most popular dinner guest in Jerusalem" and "an outdoor
      man," but a great executive. "He picked up twelve men from
      the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an
      organization that conquered the world. . . . Nowhere is
      there such a startling example of executive success as the
      way in which that organization was brought together." His
      parables were "the most powerful advertisements of all
      time. . . . He would be a national advertiser today." In
      fact, Jesus was "the founder of modern business." Why, you
      ask? Because he was the author of the ideal of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gospel According to Bruce Barton met a popular demand.
      Under the beneficent influence of Coolidge Prosperity,
      business had become almost the national religion of
      America. Millions of people wanted to be reassured that
      this religion was altogether right and proper, and that in
      the rules for making big money lay all the law and the
      prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it strange that during the very years when the Barton
      Gospel was circulating most vigorously, selling and
      advertising campaigns were becoming more cynical and the
      American business world was refusing to exercise itself
      over the Teapot Dome disclosures and the sordid history of
      the Continental Trading Company? Perhaps; but it must be
      remembered that in all religions there is likely to be a
      gap between faith and works. The businessman's halo did not
      always fit, but he wore it proudly.

      So the prosperity band-wagon rolled along with throttle
      wide open and siren blaring. But what of the man on the
      driver's seat, the man whose name this era bore?
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not have a jutting chin, a Powerful Personality, or
      an irresistible flow of selling talk. If you had come from
      Timbuctoo and found him among a crowd of Chamber of
      Commerce boosters, he would have been the last man you
      would have picked as their patron saint. He had never been
      in business. His canonization by the hosts of quantity
      production and high-pressure salesmanship was a sublime
      paradox--and yet it was largely justified. Almost the most
      remarkable thing about Coolidge Prosperity was Calvin
      Coolidge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a meager-looking man, a Vermonter with a hatchet
      face, sandy hair, tight lips, and the expression, as
      William Allen White remarked, of one "looking down his nose
      to locate that evil smell which seemed forever to affront
      him." He was pale and diffident. In private he could be
      garrulous, but in public he was as silent as a cake of ice.
      When his firmness in the Boston police strike captured the
      attention of the country and brought him to Washington as
      Vice-President, not even the affable warmth of the Harding
      Administration could thaw him. The Vice-President has to go
      to many a formal dinner; Coolidge went--and said nothing.
      The hostesses of Washington were dismayed and puzzled.
      "Over the Alps lay Italy, they thought, but none of them
      had won the summit and so they couldn't be sure that the
      view was worth the climb," wrote Edward G. Lowry. Coolidge
      became President, and still the frost continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did this silence cloak a wide-ranging mind. Coolidge
      knew his American history, but neither he nor his intellect
      had ever ventured far abroad. Go through his addresses and
      his smug <i>Autobiography,</i> and the most original thing
      you will find in them is his uncompromising unoriginality.
      Calvin Coolidge still believed in the old American copybook
      maxims when almost everybody else had half forgotten them
      or was beginning to doubt them. "The success which is made
      in any walk of life is measured almost exactly by the
      amount of hard work that is put into it. . . . There is
      only one form of political strategy in which I have any
      confidence, and that is to try to do the right thing and
      sometimes be able to succeed. . . . If society lacks
      learning and virtue it will perish. . . . The nation with
      the greatest moral power will win. . . ." This philosophy
      of hard work and frugal living and piety crowned with
      success might have been brought down from some Vermont
      attic where <i>McGuffy's Reader</i> gathered dust. But it
      was so old that it looked new; it was so exactly what
      uncounted Americans had been taught at their mother's knee
      that it touched what remained of the pioneer spirit in
      their hearts; and Coolidge set it forth with refreshing
      brevity. So completely did it win over the country that if
      the President had declared that a straight line is the
      shortest distance between two points, one wonders if
      editorial pages would not have paid tribute to his concise
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a bold leader, nor did he care to be. He
      followed no gleam, stormed no redoubt. Considering the fact
      that he was in the White House for five years and seven
      months, his presidential record was surprisingly negative.
      But it was just the sort of record that he preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its foreign policy, his Administration made little
      effort to persuade the American people that they were not
      happily isolated from the outside world. Bankers might
      engage in determining the amount of German reparations,
      unofficial observers might sit in on European negotiations,
      but the Government, remembering the decline and fall of
      Woodrow Wilson, shrewdly maintained an air of magnificent
      unconcern. Coolidge proposed, as had Harding before him,
      that the United States should join the World Court, but so
      gently that when the Senate eventually ratified the
      proposal with reservations which the other member nations
      were unable to accept, and the President went out of office
      without having achieved his end, nobody felt that his
      prestige suffered much thereby. A second naval conference
      was held at Geneva in 1927, but ended in failure. A
      Nicaraguan revolution was settled--after considerable
      turmoil and humiliation--with the aid of the Marines and of
      Henry L. Stimson's plan for a new election under American
      supervision. An even more bitter dispute with Mexico over
      the legal status of oil lands owned by American interests
      was finally moderated through the wisdom and tact of
      Coolidge's Amherst classmate and ambassador, Dwight W.
      Morrow. But the most conspicuous achievement of the
      Coolidge Administration in foreign affairs was the leading
      part it took in securing the Kellogg-Briand Treaty
      renouncing war as an instrument of national policy--a fine
      gesture which every nation was delighted to make but which
      had very little noticeable influence on the actualities of
      international relations. Aside from the belated solution of
      the Nicaraguan and Mexican difficulties and the
      championship of this somewhat innocuous treaty, the policy
      of the Coolidge Administration was to collect the money due
      it (even at the expense of considerable ill-feeling), to
      keep a watchful eye on the expansion of the American
      financial empire, and otherwise to let well enough alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coolidge's record in domestic affairs was even less
      exciting. He was nothing if not cautious. When the Harding
      scandals came to light, he did what was necessary to set in
      motion an official prosecution, he adroitly jockeyed the
      notorious Daugherty out of the Cabinet, and from that
      moment on he exhibited an unruffled and altogether
      convincing calm. When there was a strike in the anthracite
      coal mines he did not leap into the breach; he let Governor
      Gifford Pinchot of Pennsylvania do it. On the one burning
      political issue of the day, that of prohibition, he managed
      to express no opinion except that the laws should be
      enforced. There was dynamite in prohibition; Calvin
      Coolidge remained at a safe distance and looked the other
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He maintained the <i>status quo</i> for the benefit of
      business. Twice he vetoed farm relief legislation--to the
      immense satisfaction of the industrial and banking
      community which constituted his strongest support--on the
      ground that the McNary-Haugen bills were economically
      unsound. He vetoed the soldier bonus, too, on the ground of
      its expense, though in this case his veto was overruled.
      His proudest boast was that he cut down the cost of running
      the Government by systematic cheeseparing, reduced the
      public debt, and brought about four reductions in federal
      taxes, aiding not only those with small incomes but even
      more conspicuously those with large. Meanwhile his
      Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, ingeniously helped
      business to help itself; on the various governmental
      commissions, critics of contemporary commercial practices
      were replaced, as far as possible, by those who would look
      upon business with a lenient eye; and the serene quiet
      which lay about the White House was broken only by
      occasional flattering pronouncements upon business and
      assurances that prosperity was securely founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      An uninspired and unheroic policy, you suggest? But it was
      sincere: Calvin Coolidge honestly believed that by
      asserting himself as little as possible and by lifting the
      tax burdens of the rich he was benefiting the whole
      country--as perhaps he was. And it was perfectly in keeping
      with the uninspired and unheroic political temper of the
      times. For the lusty businessmen who in these fat years had
      become the arbiters of national opinion did not envisage
      the Government as an agency for making over the country
      into something a little nearer to their hearts' desire, as
      a champion of human rights or a redresser of wrongs. The
      prosperity band-wagon was bringing them rapidly toward
      their hearts' desire, and politics might block the traffic.
      They did not want a man of action in the Presidency; they
      wanted as little government as possible, at as low cost as
      possible, and this dour New Englander who drove the
      prosperity band-wagon with so slack a rein embodied their
      idea of supreme statesmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesmanship of a sort Calvin Coolidge certainly
      represented. Prosperity has its undeniable advantages, and
      a President who is astute enough to know how to encourage
      it without getting himself into hot water may possibly be
      forgiven such complacency as appears in his
      <i>Autobiography.</i> There is perhaps a cool word to be
      said, too, for the prudence which deliberately accepts the
      inevitable, which does not even try to be bolder or more
      magnanimous than circumstances will safely permit. The
      great god Business was supreme in the land, and Calvin
      Coolidge was fortunate enough to become almost a demi-god
      by doing discreet obeisance before the altar.

      THE BALLYHOO YEARS

      All nations, in all eras of history, are swept from time to
      time by waves of contagious excitement over fads or
      fashions or dramatic public issues. But the size and
      frequency of these waves is highly variable, as is the
      nature of the events which set them in motion. One of the
      striking characteristics of the era of Coolidge Prosperity
      was the unparalleled rapidity and unanimity with which
      millions of men and women turned their attention, their
      talk, and their emotional interest upon a series of
      tremendous trifles--a heavyweight boxing-match, a murder
      trial, a new automobile model, a transatlantic flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the <i>causes célèbres</i> which thus stirred the
      country from end to end were quite unimportant from the
      traditional point of view of the historian. The future
      destinies of few people were affected in the slightest by
      the testimony of the "pig woman" at the Hall-Mills trial or
      the attempt to rescue Floyd Collins from his Kentucky cave.
      Yet the fact that such things could engage the hopes and
      fears of unprecedented numbers of people was anything but
      unimportant. No account of the Coolidge years would be
      adequate which did not review that strange procession of
      events which a nation tired of "important issues" swarmed
      to watch, or which did not take account of that remarkable
      chain of circumstances which produced as the hero of the
      age, not a great public servant, not a reformer, not a
      warrior, but a stunt flyer who crossed the ocean to win a
      money prize.

    <p>
      By the time Calvin Coolidge reached the White House, the
      tension of the earlier years of the Post-war Decade had
      been largely relaxed. Though Woodrow Wilson still clung
      feebly to life in the sunny house in S Street, the League
      issue was dead and only handfuls of irreconcilable
      idealists imagined it to have a chance of resuscitation.
      The radicals were discouraged, the labor movement had lost
      energy and prestige since the days of the Big Red Scare,
      and under the beneficent influence of easy riches--or at
      least of easy Fords and Chevrolets--individualistic
      capitalism had settled itself securely in the saddle. The
      Ku Klux Klan numbered its millions, yet already it was
      beginning to lose that naïve ardor which had lighted its
      fires on a thousand hilltops; it was becoming less of a
      crusade and more of a political racket. Genuine public
      issues, about which the masses of the population could be
      induced to feel intensely, were few and far between. There
      was prohibition, to be sure; anybody could get excited
      about prohibition; but because the division of opinion on
      liquor cut across party lines, every national politician,
      almost without exception, did his best to thrust this issue
      into the background. In the agricultural Northwest and
      Middle West there was a violent outcry for farm relief, but
      it could command only a scattered and half-hearted interest
      throughout the rest of a nation which was becoming
      progressively urbanized. Public spirit was at low ebb; over
      the World Court, the oil scandals, the Nicaraguan
      situation, the American people as a whole refused to bother
      themselves. They gave their energies to triumphant
      business, and for the rest they were in holiday mood.
      "Happy," they might have said, "is the nation which has no
      history--and a lot of good shows to watch." They were ready
      for any good show that came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now possible in the United States for more people to
      enjoy the same good show at the same time than in any other
      land on earth or at any previous time in history. Mass
      production was not confined to automobiles; there was mass
      production in news and ideas as well. For the system of
      easy nation-wide communication which had long since made
      the literate and prosperous American people a nation of
      faddists was rapidly becoming more widely extended, more
      centralized, and more effective than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, there were fewer newspapers, with larger
      circulations, and they were standardized to an
      unprecedented degree by the increasing use of
      press-association material and syndicated features. Between
      1914 and 1926, as Silas Bent has pointed out, the number of
      daily papers in the country dropped from 2,580 to 2,001,
      the number of Sunday papers dropped from 571 to 541, and
      the aggregate circulation per issue rose from somewhat over
      28,000,000 to 36,000,000. The city of Cleveland, which a
      quarter of a century before had had three morning papers,
      now had but one; Detroit, Minneapolis, and St. Louis had
      lost all but one apiece; Chicago, during a period in which
      it had doubled in population, had seen the number of its
      morning dailies drop from seven to two. Newspapers all over
      the country were being gathered into chains under more or
      less centralized direction: by 1927 the success of the
      Hearst and Scripps-Howard systems and the hope of cutting
      down overhead costs had led to the formation of no less
      than 55 chains controlling 230 daily papers with a combined
      circulation of over 13,000,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer did the local editor rely as before upon local
      writers and cartoonists to fill out his pages and give them
      a local flavor; the central office of the chain, or
      newspaper syndicates in New York, could provide him with
      editorials, health talks, comic strips, sob-sister columns,
      household hints, sports gossip, and Sunday features
      prepared for a national audience and guaranteed to tickle
      the mass mind. Andy Gump and Dorothy Dix had their millions
      of admirers from Maine to Oregon, and the words hammered
      out by a reporter at Jack Dempsey's training-camp were
      devoured with one accord by real-estate men in Florida and
      riveters in Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the number of national magazines with huge
      circulations had increased, the volume of national
      advertising had increased, a horde of publicity agents had
      learned the knack of associating their cause or product
      with whatever happened to be in the public mind at the
      moment, and finally there was the new and vastly important
      phenomenon of radio broadcasting, which on occasion could
      link together a multitude of firesides to hear the story of
      a World Series game or a Lindbergh welcome. The national
      mind had become as never before an instrument upon which a
      few men could play. And these men were learning, as Mr.
      Bent has also shown, to play upon it in a new way--to
      concentrate upon <i>one tune at a time.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that they put their heads together and deliberately
      decided to do this. Circumstances and self-interest made it
      the almost inevitable thing for them to do. They
      discovered--the successful tabloids were daily teaching
      them--that the public tended to become excited about one
      thing at a time. Newspaper owners and editors found that
      whenever a Dayton trial or a <i>Vestris</i> disaster took
      place, they sold more papers if they gave it all they
      had--their star reporters, their front-page display, and
      the bulk of their space. They took full advantage of this
      discovery: according to Mr. Bent's compilations, the
      insignificant Gray-Snyder murder trial got a bigger "play"
      in the press than the sinking of the <i>Titanic;</i>
      Lindbergh's flight, than the Armistice and the overthrow of
      the German Empire. Syndicate managers and writers,
      advertisers, press agents, radio broadcasters, all were
      aware that mention of the leading event of the day,
      whatever it might be, was the key to public interest. The
      result was that when something happened which promised to
      appeal to the popular mind, one had it hurled at one in
      huge headlines, waded through page after page of syndicated
      discussion of it, heard about it on the radio, was reminded
      of it again and again in the outpourings of
      publicity-seeking orators and preachers, saw pictures of it
      in the Sunday papers and in the movies, and (unless one was
      a perverse individualist) enjoyed the sensation of
      vibrating to the same chord which thrilled a vast populace.

      The country had bread, but it wanted circuses--and now it
      could go to them a hundred million strong.

      Mah Jong was still popular during the winter of
      1923-24--the winter when Calvin Coolidge was becoming
      accustomed to the White House, and the Bok Peace Prize was
      awarded, and the oil scandals broke, and Woodrow Wilson
      died, and General Dawes went overseas to preside over the
      reparations conference, and <i>So Big</i> outsold all other
      novels, and people were tiring of "Yes, We Have No
      Bananas," and to the delight of every rotogravure editor
      the lid of the stone sarcophagus of King Tutankhamen's tomb
      was raised at Luxor. Mah Jong was popular, but it had lost
      its novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during that winter--on January 2, 1924, to be
      precise--that a young man in New York called on his aunt.
      The aunt had a relative who was addicted to the cross-word
      puzzles which appeared every Sunday in the magazine
      supplement of the <i>New York World,</i> and asked the
      young man whether there was by any chance a book of these
      puzzles; it might make a nice present for her relative. The
      young man, on due inquiry, found that there was no such
      thing as a book of them, although cross-word puzzles dated
      back at least to 1913 and had been published in the
      <i>World</i> for years. But as it happened, he himself (his
      name was Richard Simon) was at that very moment launching a
      book-publishing business with his friend Schuster--and with
      one girl as their entire staff. Simon had a bright idea,
      which he communicated to Schuster the next day: <i>they</i>
      would bring out a cross-word-puzzle book. The two young men
      asked Prosper Buranelli, F. Gregory Hartswick, and Margaret
      Petherbridge, the puzzle editors of the <i>World,</i> to
      prepare it; and despite a certain coolness on the part of
      the book-sellers, who told them that the public "wasn't
      interested in puzzle books," they brought it out in
      mid-April. Their promotion campaign was ingenious and
      proved to be prophetic, for from the very beginning they
      advertised their book by drawing the following parallel:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      1921--Coué<br>
      1922--Mah Jong<br>
      1923--Bananas<br>
      1924--THE CROSS-WORD-PUZZLE BOOK
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Within a month this odd-looking volume with a pencil
      attached to it had become a best seller. By the following
      winter its sales had mounted into the hundreds of
      thousands, other publishers were falling over themselves to
      get out books which would reap an advantage from the craze,
      it was a dull newspaper which did not have its daily
      puzzle, sales of dictionaries were bounding, there was a
      new demand for that ancient and honorable handmaid of the
      professional writer, Roget's <i>Thesaurus,</i> a man had
      been sent to jail in New York for refusing to leave a
      restaurant after four hours of trying to solve a puzzle,
      and Mrs. Mary Zaba of Chicago was reported to be a
      "cross-word widow," her husband apparently being so busy
      with puzzles that he had no time to support her. The
      newspapers carried the news that a Pittsburgh pastor had
      put the text of his sermon into a puzzle. The Baltimore and
      Ohio Railroad placed dictionaries in all the trains on its
      main line. A traveler between New York and Boston reported
      that 60 per cent of the passengers were trying to fill up
      the squares in their puzzles, and that in the dining-car
      five waiters were trying to think of a five-letter word
      which meant "serving to inspire fear." Anybody you met on
      the street could tell you the name of the Egyptian sun-god
      or provide you with the two-letter word which meant a
      printer's measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cross-word puzzle craze gradually died down in 1925. It
      was followed by a minor epidemic of question-and-answer
      books; there was a time when ladies and gentlemen with
      vague memories faced frequent humiliation after dinner
      because they were unable to identify John Huss or tell what
      an ohm was. Not until after contract bridge was introduced
      in the United States in 1926 did they breathe easily.
      Despite the decline of the cross-word puzzle, however, it
      remained throughout the rest of the decade a daily feature
      in most newspapers; and Simon and Schuster, bringing out
      their sixteenth series in 1930, figured their total sales
      since early 1924 at nearly three-quarters of a million
      copies, and the grand total, including British and Canadian
      sales, at over two million.

      This craze, like the Mah Jong craze which preceded it, was
      a fresh indication of the susceptibility of the American
      people to fads, but it was not in any real sense a creature
      of the new ballyhoo newspaper technique. The newspapers did
      not pick it up until it was well on its way. The greatest
      demonstrations of the power of the press to excite the
      millions over trifles were yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, of course, plenty to interest the casual
      newspaper reader in 1924 and early 1925, when everybody was
      doing puzzles. There was the presidential campaign, though
      this proved somewhat of an anticlimax after the sizzling
      Democratic Convention at Madison Square Garden, that
      long-drawn-out battle between the forces of William G.
      McAdoo and Al Smith which ended in a half-hearted stampede
      to John W. Davis; so much emotional energy had been
      expended by the Westerners in hating the Tammany Catholic
      and by the Tammanyites in singing "The Sidewalks of New
      York," that the Democratic party never really collected
      itself, and the unimpassioned Calvin, with his quiet
      insistence upon economy and tax reduction and his knack for
      making himself appear the personal embodiment of
      prosperity, was carried into office by a vast majority.
      There was also the trial of Leopold and Loeb for the murder
      of Bobby Franks in Chicago. There was the visit of the
      Prince of Wales to Long Island, during which he danced
      much, played polo, went motor-boating, and was detected in
      the act of reading <i>The Life and Letters of Walter Hines
      Page.</i> (It was in 1924, by the way, that those other
      importations from Britain, the voluminous gray flannel
      trousers known as Oxford bags, first hung about the heels
      of the up-and-coming young male.) There was a noteworthy
      alliance between a representative of the nobility of France
      and a representative of the nobility of Hollywood: Gloria
      Swanson married the Marquis de la Falaise de la Coudray.
      There was a superb eclipse of the sun, providentially
      arranged for the delectation of the Eastern seaboard
      cities. There was Paavo Nurmi: watch in hand, his heels
      thudding on the board track, Nurmi outran the chesty
      taxi-driver, Joie Ray, and later performed the incredible
      feat of covering two miles in less than nine minutes. There
      was the hullabaloo over bringing the serum to Nome to end a
      diphtheria epidemic, which for a few days made national
      heroes of Leonard Seppalla, Gunnar Kasson, and the dog
      Balto. And there was Floyd Collins imprisoned in his cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the tragedy of Floyd Collins, perhaps, which gave
      the clearest indication up to that time of the unanimity
      with which the American people could become excited over a
      quite unimportant event if only it were dramatic enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floyd Collins was an obscure young Kentuckian who had been
      exploring an underground passage five miles from Mammoth
      Cave, with no more heroic purpose than that of finding
      something which might attract lucrative tourists. Some 125
      feet from daylight he was caught by a cave-in which pinned
      his foot under a huge rock. So narrow and steep was the
      passage that those who tried to dig him out had to hitch
      along on their stomachs in cold slime and water and pass
      back from hand to hand the earth and rocks that they pried
      loose with hammers and blow-torches. Only a few people
      might have heard of Collins's predicament if W. B. Miller
      of the <i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i> had not been
      slight of stature, daring, and an able reporter. Miller
      wormed his way down the slippery, tortuous passageway to
      interview Collins, became engrossed in the efforts to
      rescue the man, described them in vivid dispatches--and to
      his amazement found that the entire country was turning to
      watch the struggle. Collinses plight contained those
      elements of dramatic suspense and individual conflict with
      fate which make a great news story, and every city editor,
      day after day, planted it on page one. When Miller arrived
      at Sand Cave he had found only three men at the entrance,
      warming themselves at a fire and wondering, without
      excitement, how soon their friend would extricate himself.
      A fortnight later there was a city of a hundred or more
      tents there and the milling crowds had to be restrained by
      barbed-wire barriers and state troops with drawn bayonets;
      and on February 17, 1925, even the <i>New York Times</i>
      gave a three-column page-one headline to the news of the
      dénouement:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      FIND FLOYD COLLINS DEAD IN CAVE TRAP ON 18TH DAY; LIFELESS
      AT LEAST 24 HOURS; FOOT MUST BE AMPUTATED TO GET BODY OUT
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Within a month, as Charles Merz later reminded the readers
      of the <i>New Republic,</i> there was a cave-in in a North
      Carolina mine in which 71 men were caught and 53 actually
      lost. It attracted no great notice. It was "just a mine
      disaster." Yet for more than two weeks the plight of a
      single commonplace prospector for tourists riveted the
      attention of the nation on Sand Cave, Kentucky. It was an
      exciting show to watch, and the dispensers of news were
      learning to turn their spotlights on one show at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the Collins thriller, however, was as nothing beside
      the spectacle which was offered a few months later when
      John Thomas Scopes was tried at Dayton, Tennessee, for
      teaching the doctrine of evolution in the Central High
      School.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scopes case had genuine significance. It dramatized one
      of the most momentous struggles of the age--the conflict
      between religion and science. Yet even this trial, so
      diligently and noisily was it ballyhooed, took on some of
      the aspects of a circus.

      If religion lost ground during the Post-war Decade, the
      best available church statistics gave no sign of the fact.
      They showed, to be sure, a very slow growth in the number
      of churches in use; but this was explained partly by the
      tendency toward consolidation of existing churches and
      partly by the trend of population toward the cities--a
      trend which drew the church-going public into fewer
      churches with larger congregations. The number of church
      <i>members,</i> on the other hand, grew just about as fast
      as the population, and church wealth and expenditures grew
      more rapidly still. On actual attendance at services there
      were no reliable figures, although it was widely believed
      that an increasing proportion of the nominally faithful
      were finding other things to do on Sunday morning.
      Statistically, the churches apparently just about
      maintained their position in American life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it is difficult to escape the conclusion that they
      maintained it chiefly by the force of momentum--and to some
      extent, perhaps, by diligent attention to the things which
      are Cæsar's: by adopting, here and there, the acceptable
      gospel according to Bruce Barton; by strenuous membership
      and money-raising campaigns (such as Bishop Manning's
      high-pressure drive in New York for a "house of prayer for
      all people," which proved to be a house of prayer under
      strictly Episcopal auspices); and by the somewhat secular
      lure of church theatricals, open forums, basket-ball and
      swimming pools, and muscular good fellowship for the young.
      Something spiritual had gone out of the churches--a sense
      of certainty that theirs was the way to salvation. Religion
      was furiously discussed; there had never been so many books
      on religious topics in circulation, and the leading divines
      wrote constantly for the popular magazines; yet all this
      discussion was itself a sign that for millions of people
      religion had become a debatable subject instead of being
      accepted without question among the traditions of the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      If church attendance declined, it was perhaps because, as
      Walter Lippmann put it, people were not so certain that
      they were going to meet God when they went to church. If
      the minister's prestige declined, it was in many cases
      because he had lost his one-time conviction that he had a
      definite and authoritative mission. The Reverend Charles
      Stelzle, a shrewd observer of religious conditions, spoke
      bluntly in an article in the <i>World's Work:</i> the
      church, he said, was declining largely because "those who
      are identified with it do not actually believe in it." Mr.
      Stelzle told of asking groups of Protestant ministers what
      there was in their church programs which would prompt them,
      if they were outsiders, to say, "That is great; that is
      worth lining up for," and of receiving in no case an
      immediate answer which satisfied even the answerer himself.
      In the congregations, and especially among the younger men
      and women, there was an undeniable weakening of loyalty to
      the church and an undeniable vagueness as to what it had to
      offer them--witness, for example, the tone of the
      discussions which accompanied the abandonment of compulsory
      chapel in a number of colleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      This loss of spiritual dynamic was variously ascribed to
      the general let-down in moral energy which followed the
      strain of the war; to prosperity, which encouraged the
      comfortable belief that it profited a man very considerably
      if he gained a Cadillac car and a laudatory article in the
      <i>American Magazine;</i> to the growing popularity of
      Sunday golf and automobiling; and to disapproval in some
      quarters of the political lobbying of church organizations,
      and disgust at the connivance of many ministers in the
      bigotry of the Klan. More important than any of these
      causes, however, was the effect upon the churches of
      scientific doctrines and scientific methods of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prestige of science was colossal. The man in the street
      and the woman in the kitchen, confronted on every hand with
      new machines and devices which they owed to the laboratory,
      were ready to believe that science could accomplish almost
      anything; and they were being deluged with scientific
      information and theory. The newspapers were giving columns
      of space to inform (or misinform) them of the latest
      discoveries: a new dictum from Albert Einstein was now
      front-page stuff even though practically nobody could
      understand it. Outlines of knowledge poured from the
      presses to tell people about the planetesimal hypothesis
      and the constitution of the atom, to describe for them in
      unwarranted detail the daily life of the cave-man, and to
      acquaint them with electrons, endocrines, hormones,
      vitamins, reflexes, and psychoses. On the lower
      intellectual levels, millions of people were discovering
      for the first time that there was such a thing as the
      venerable theory of evolution. Those who had assimilated
      this doctrine without disaster at an early age were
      absorbing from Wells, Thomson, East, Wiggam, Dorsey, and
      innumerable other popularizers and interpreters of science
      a collection of ideas newer and more disquieting: that we
      are residents of an insignificant satellite of a very
      average star obscurely placed in one of who-knows-how-many
      galaxies scattered through space; that our behavior depends
      largely upon chromosomes and ductless glands; that the
      Hottentot obeys impulses similar to those which activate
      the pastor of the First Baptist Church, and is probably
      already better adapted to his Hottentot environment than he
      would be if he followed the Baptist code, that sex is the
      most important thing in life, that inhibitions are not to
      be tolerated, that sin is an out-of-date term, that most
      untoward behavior is the result of complexes acquired at an
      early age, and that men and women are mere bundles of
      behavior-patterns, anyhow. If some of the scientific and
      pseudoscientific principles which lodged themselves in the
      popular mind contradicted one another, that did not seem to
      matter: the popular mind appeared equally ready to believe
      with East and Wiggam in the power of heredity and with
      Watson in the power of environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the sciences it was the youngest and least
      scientific which most captivated the general public and had
      the most disintegrating effect upon religious faith.
      Psychology was king. Freud, Adler, Jung, and Watson had
      their tens of thousands of votaries; intelligence-testers
      invaded the schools in quest of I.Q.s; psychiatrists were
      installed in business houses to hire and fire employees and
      determine advertising policies; and one had only to read
      the newspapers to be told with complete assurance that
      psychology held the key to the problems of waywardness,
      divorce, and crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word science had become a shibboleth. To preface a
      statement with "Science teaches us" was enough to silence
      argument. If a sales manager wanted to put over a promotion
      scheme or a clergyman to recommend a charity, they both
      hastened to say that it was scientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the prestige of science upon churchmen was
      well summed up by Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick at the end of
      the decade:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The men of faith might claim for their positions ancient
      tradition, practical usefulness, and spiritual
      desirability, but one query could prick all such bubbles:
      Is it scientific? That question has searched religion for
      contraband goods, stripped it of old superstitions, forced
      it to change its categories of thought and methods of work,
      and in general has so cowed and scared religion that many
      modern-minded believers . . . instinctively throw up their
      hands at the mere whisper of it. . . . When a prominent
      scientist comes out strongly for religion, all the churches
      thank Heaven and take courage as though it were the highest
      possible compliment to God to have Eddington believe in
      Him. Science has become the arbiter of this generation's
      thought, until to call even a prophet and a seer scientific
      is to cap the climax of praise."
    </p>
    <p>
      So powerful was the invasion of scientific ideas and of the
      scientific habit of reliance upon proved acts that the
      Protestant churches--which numbered in their membership
      five out of every eight adult church members in the United
      States--were broken into two warring camps. Those who
      believed in the letter of the Bible and refused to accept
      any teaching, even of science, which seemed to conflict
      with it, began in 1921 to call themselves Fundamentalists.
      The Modernists (or Liberals), on the other hand, tried to
      reconcile their beliefs with scientific thought: to throw
      overboard what was out of date, to retain what was
      essential and intellectually respectable, and generally to
      mediate between Christianity and the skeptical spirit of
      the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the Fundamentalists seemed almost hopeless.
      The tide of all rational thought in a rational age seemed
      to be running against them. But they were numerous, and at
      least there was no doubt about where they stood.
      Particularly in the South they controlled the big
      Protestant denominations. And they fought strenuously. They
      forced the liberal Doctor Fosdick out of the pulpit of a
      Presbyterian church and back into his own Baptist fold, and
      even caused him to be tried for heresy (though there was no
      churchman in America more influential than he). They
      introduced into the legislatures of nearly half the states
      of the Union bills designed to forbid the teaching of the
      doctrine of evolution; in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
      South Carolina they pushed such bills through one house of
      the legislature only to fail in the other; and in
      Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Mississippi they actually
      succeeded in writing their anachronistic wishes into law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Modernists had the <i>Zeitgeist</i> on their side, but
      they were not united. Their interpretations of God--as the
      first cause, as absolute energy, as idealized reality, as a
      righteous will working in creation, as the ideal and goal
      toward which all that is highest and best is moving--were
      confusingly various and ambiguous. Some of these
      interpretations offered little to satisfy the worshiper:
      one New England clergyman said that when he thought of God
      he thought of "a sort of oblong blur." And the Modernists
      threw overboard so many doctrines in which the bulk of
      American Protestants had grown up believing (such as the
      Virgin birth, the resurrection of the body, and the
      Atonement) that they seemed to many to have no religious
      cargo left except a nebulous faith, a general benevolence,
      and a disposition to assure everyone that he was really
      just as religious as they. Gone for them, as Walter
      Lippmann said, was "that deep, compulsive, organic faith in
      an external fact which is the essence of religion for all
      but that very small minority who can live within themselves
      in mystical communion or by the power of their
      understanding." The Modernists, furthermore, had not only
      Fundamentalism to battle with, but another adversary, the
      skeptic nourished on outlines of science; and the sermons
      of more than one Modernist leader gave the impression that
      Modernism, trying to meet the skeptic's arguments without
      resorting to the argument from authority, was being forced
      against its will to whittle down its creed to almost
      nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the decade the three-sided conflict
      reverberated. It reached its climax in the Scopes case in
      the summer of 1925.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tennessee legislature, dominated by Fundamentalists,
      passed a bill providing that "it shall be unlawful for any
      teacher in any of the universities, normals and all other
      public schools of the State, which are supported in whole
      or in part by the public school funds of the State, to
      teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine
      creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach
      instead that man has descended from a lower order of
      animals."
    </p>
    <p>
      This law had no sooner been placed upon the books than a
      little group of men in the sleepy town of Dayton,
      Tennessee, decided to put it to the test. George Rappelyea,
      a mining engineer, was drinking lemon phosphates in
      Robinson's drug store with John Thomas Scopes, a likeable
      young man of twenty-four who taught biology at the Central
      High School, and two or three others. Rappelyea proposed
      that Scopes should allow himself to be caught red-handed in
      the act of teaching the theory of evolution to an innocent
      child, and Scopes--half serious, half in joke--agreed.
      Their motives were apparently mixed; it was characteristic
      of the times that (according to so friendly a narrator of
      the incident as Arthur Garfield Hays) Rappelyea declared
      that their action would put Dayton on the map. At all
      events, the illegal deed was shortly perpetrated and Scopes
      was arrested. William Jennings Bryan forthwith volunteered
      his services to the prosecution; Rappelyea wired the Civil
      Liberties Union in New York and secured for Scopes the
      legal assistance of Clarence Darrow, Dudley Field Malone,
      and Arthur Garfield Hays; the trial was set for July, 1925,
      and Dayton suddenly discovered that it was to be put on the
      map with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something to be said for the right of the people
      to decide what should be taught in their tax-supported
      schools, even if what they decided upon was ridiculous. But
      the issue of the Scopes case, as the great mass of
      newspaper readers saw it, was nothing so abstruse as the
      rights of taxpayers versus academic freedom. In the eyes of
      the public, the trial was a battle between Fundamentalism
      on the one hand and twentieth-century skepticism (assisted
      by Modernism) on the other. The champions of both causes
      were headliners. Bryan had been three times a candidate for
      the Presidency, had been Secretary of State, and was a
      famous orator; he was the perfect embodiment of
      old-fashioned American idealism--friendly, naïve,
      provincial. Darrow, a radical, a friend of the underdog, an
      agnostic, had recently jumped into the limelight of
      publicity through his defense of Leopold and Loeb. Even Tex
      Rickard could hardly have staged a more promising contest
      than a battle between these two men over such an emotional
      issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange trial. Into the quiet town of Dayton
      flocked gaunt Tennessee farmers and their families in
      mule-drawn wagons and ramshackle Fords; quiet, godly people
      in overalls and gingham and black, ready to defend their
      faith against the "foreigners," yet curious to know what
      this new-fangled evolutionary theory might be. Revivalists
      of every sort flocked there, too, held their meetings on
      the outskirts of the town under the light of flares, and
      tacked up signs on the trees about the courthouse--"Read
      Your Bible Daily for One Week," and "Be Sure Your Sins Will
      Find You Out," and at the very courthouse gate:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      THE KINGDOM OF GOD
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The sweetheart love of Jesus Christ and Paradise Street is
      at hand. Do you want to be a sweet angel? Forty days of
      prayer. Itemize your sins and iniquities for eternal life.
      If you come clean, God will talk back to you in voice.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the atmosphere of Dayton was not simply that of rural
      piety. Hot-dog venders and lemonade venders set up their
      stalls along the streets as if it were circus day.
      Booksellers hawked volumes on biology. Over a hundred
      newspapermen poured into the town. The Western Union
      installed twenty-two telegraph operators in a room off a
      grocery store. In the courtroom itself, as the trial
      impended, reporters and cameramen crowded alongside
      grim-faced Tennessee countrymen; there was a buzz of talk,
      a shuffle of feet, a ticking of telegraph instruments, an
      air of suspense like that of a first-night performance at
      the theater. Judge, defendant, and counsel were stripped to
      their shirt sleeves--Bryan in a pongee shirt turned in at
      the neck. Darrow with lavender suspenders, Judge Raulston
      with galluses of a more sober judicial hue--yet fashion was
      not wholly absent: the news was flashed over the wires to
      the whole country that the judge's daughters, as they
      entered the courtroom with him, wore rolled stockings like
      any metropolitan flapper's. Court was opened with a pious
      prayer--and motion-picture operators climbed upon tables
      and chairs to photograph the leading participants in the
      trial from every possible angle. The evidence ranged all
      the way from the admission of fourteen-year-old Howard
      Morgan that Scopes had told him about evolution and that it
      hadn't hurt him any, to the estimate of a zoologist that
      life had begun something like six hundred million years ago
      (an assertion which caused gasps and titters of disbelief
      from the rustics in the audience). And meanwhile two
      million words were being telegraphed out of Dayton, the
      trial was being broadcast by the <i>Chicago Tribune's</i>
      station WGN, the Dreamland Circus at Coney Island offered
      "Zip" to the Scopes defense as a "missing link," cable
      companies were reporting enormous increases in
      transatlantic cable tolls, and news agencies in London were
      being besieged with requests for more copy from
      Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Russia, China, and Japan.
      Ballyhoo had come to Dayton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bitter trial. Attorney-General Stewart of
      Tennessee cried out against the insidious doctrine which
      was "undermining the faith of Tennessee's children and
      robbing them of their chance of eternal life." Bryan
      charged Darrow with having only one purpose, "to slur at
      the Bible." Darrow spoke of Bryan's "fool religion." Yet
      again and again the scene verged on farce. The climax--both
      of bitterness and of farce--came on the afternoon of July
      20th, when on the spur of the moment Hays asked that the
      defense be permitted to put Bryan on the stand as an expert
      on the Bible, and Bryan consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great was the crowd that afternoon that the judge had
      decided to move the court outdoors, to a platform built
      against the courthouse under the maple trees. Benches were
      set out before it. The reporters sat on the benches, on the
      ground, anywhere, and scribbled their stories. On the
      outskirts of the seated crowd a throng stood in the hot
      sunlight which streamed down through the trees. And on the
      platform sat the shirt-sleeved Clarence Darrow, a Bible on
      his knee, and put the Fundamentalist champion through one
      of the strangest examinations which ever took place in a
      court of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked Bryan about Jonah and the whale, Joshua and the
      the sun, where Cain got his wife, the date of the Flood,
      the significance of the Tower of Babel. Bryan affirmed his
      belief that the world was created in 4004 B.C. and the
      Flood occurred in or about 2348 B.C.; that Eve was
      literally made out of Adam's rib; that the Tower of Babel
      was responsible for the diversity of languages in the
      world; and that a "big fish" had swallowed Jonah. When
      Darrow asked him if he had ever discovered where Cain got
      his wife, Bryan answered: "No, sir; I leave the agnostics
      to hunt for her." When Darrow inquired, "Do you say you do
      not believe that there were any civilizations on this earth
      that reach back beyond five thousand years?" Bryan stoutly
      replied, "I am not satisfied by any evidence I have seen."
      Tempers were getting frazzled by the strain and the heat;
      once Darrow declared that his purpose in examining Bryan
      was "to show up Fundamentalism . . . to prevent bigots and
      ignoramuses from controlling the educational system of the
      United States," and Bryan jumped up, his face purple, and
      shook his fist at Darrow, crying, "To protect the word of
      God against the greatest atheist and agnostic in the United
      States!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a savage encounter, and a tragic one for the
      ex-Secretary of State. He was defending what he held most
      dear. He was making--though he did not know it--his last
      appearance before the great American public which had once
      done him honor (he died scarcely a week later). And he was
      being covered with humiliation. The sort of religious faith
      which he represented could not take the witness stand and
      face reason as a prosecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of July 21st Judge Raulston mercifully
      refused to let the ordeal of Bryan continue and expunged
      the testimony of the previous afternoon. Scopes's lawyers
      had been unable to get any of their scientific evidence
      before the jury, and now they saw that their only chance of
      making the sort of defense they had planned for lay in
      giving up the case and bringing it before the Tennessee
      Supreme Court on appeal. Scopes was promptly found guilty
      and fined one hundred dollars. The State Supreme Court
      later upheld the anti-evolution law but freed Scopes on a
      technicality, thus preventing further appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theoretically, Fundamentalism had won, for the law stood.
      Yet really Fundamentalism had lost. Legislators might go on
      passing anti-evolution laws, and in the hinterlands the
      pious might still keep their religion locked in a
      science-proof compartment of their minds; but civilized
      opinion everywhere had regarded the Dayton trial with
      amazement and amusement, and the slow drift away from
      Fundamentalist certainty continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporters, the movie men, the syndicate writers, the
      telegraph operators shook the dust of Dayton from their
      feet. This monkey trial had been a good show for the front
      pages, but maybe it was a little too highbrow in its
      implications. What next? . . . How about a good clean fight
      without any biology in it?

      The year 1925 drew slowly toward its close. The
      <i>Shenandoah</i>--a great navy dirigible--was wrecked, and
      for a few days the country supped on horror. The Florida
      real-estate boom reached its dizziest height. And then the
      football season revealed what the ballyhoo technique could
      do for a football star. Nobody needed a course in biology
      to appreciate Red Grange.

    <p>
      The Post-war Decade was a great sporting era. More men were
      playing golf than ever before--playing it in baggy
      plus-fours, with tassels at the knee and checked stockings.
      There were five thousand golf-courses in the United States,
      there were said to be two million players, and it was
      estimated that half a billion dollars was spent annually on
      the game. The ability to play it had become a part of the
      almost essential equipment of the aspiring business
      executive. The country club had become the focus of social
      life in hundreds of communities. But it was an even greater
      era for watching sports than for taking part in them.
      Promoters, chambers of commerce, newspaper-owners, sports
      writers, press agents, radio broadcasters, all found profit
      in exploiting the public's mania for sporting shows and its
      willingness to be persuaded that the great athletes of the
      day were supermen. Never before had such a blinding light
      of publicity been turned upon the gridiron, the diamond,
      and the prize ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men who had never learned until the nineteen-twenties the
      difference between a brassie and a niblick grabbed their
      five-star editions to read about Bobby Jones's exploits
      with his redoubtable putter, Calamity Jane. There was big
      money in being a successful golf professional: Walter
      Hagen's income for several years ranged between forty and
      eighty thousand dollars, and for a time he received thirty
      thousand a year and a house for lending the prestige of his
      presence and his name to a Florida real-estate development.
      World Series baseball crowds broke all records. So intense
      was the excitement over football that stadia seating fifty
      and sixty and seventy thousand people were filled to the
      last seat when the big teams met, while scores of thousands
      more sat in warm living-rooms to hear the play-by-play
      story over the radio and to be told by Graham McNamee that
      it certainly was cold on the upper rim of the amphitheater.
      The Yale Athletic Association was said to have taken in
      over a million dollars in ticket money in a single season.
      Teams which represented supposed institutions of learning
      went barnstorming for weeks at a time, imbibing what
      academic instruction they might on the sleeping-car between
      the Yankee Stadium and Chicago or between Texas and the
      Tournament of Roses at Pasadena. More Americans could
      identify Knute Rockne as the Notre Dame coach than could
      tell who was the presiding officer of the United States
      Senate. The fame of star football players, to be sure, was
      ephemeral compared with that of Jones in golf, or of Ruth
      in baseball, or of Tilden in tennis. Aldrich, Owen, Bo
      McMillin, Ernie Nevers, Grange, the Four Horsemen, Benny
      Friedman, Caldwell, Cagle, and Albie Booth all reigned
      briefly. But the case of Red Grange may illustrate to what
      heights a hero of the stadium could rise in the consulship
      of Calvin Coolidge, when pockets were full and the art of
      ballyhoo was young and vigorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harold E. Grange--the middle name is Edward--was born in
      Forksville, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania, on June 13,
      1903," announced a publicity item sent out to the press to
      put the University of Illinois on the map by glorifying its
      greatest product. "His father, Lyle N. Grange, in his youth
      had been the king of lumberjacks in the Pennsylvania
      mountains, being renowned for his strength, skill, and
      daring. His mother, a sweet and lovely girl, died when
      'Red' was five years old, and it was this which determined
      his father to move from Pennsylvania to Wheaton, Illinois.
      . . . The father, who never married again, is deputy
      sheriff at Wheaton."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the publicity item (which continues in this rhapsodic
      tone for many a paragraph) is perhaps too leisurely.
      Suffice it to say that Red Grange--the "Wheaton iceman," as
      they called him--played football exceedingly well for the
      University of Illinois, so well that at the end of the
      season of 1925 (his senior year) he decided not to bother
      any further with education at the moment, but to reap the
      harvest of his fame. Let a series of items summarizing the
      telegraphic press dispatches tell the story:

      The public is Fickle, however. Within a few months Gertrude
      Ederle and the first mother to swim the English Channel
      were being welcomed in New York with thunderous applause.
      Dempsey and Tunney were preparing for their Philadelphia
      fight, and the spotlight had left Red Grange. Five years
      later he was reported to be working in a night club in
      Hollywood, while that other hero of the backfield, Caldwell
      of Yale, was running a lunchroom in New Haven. <i>Sic
      transit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The public mania for vicarious participation in sport
      reached its climax in the two Dempsey-Tunney fights, the
      first at Philadelphia in September, 1926, the second at
      Chicago a year later. Prize-fighting, once outlawed, had
      become so respectable in American eyes that gentlefolk
      crowded into the ringside seats and a clergyman on Long
      Island had to postpone a meeting of his vestrymen so that
      they might listen in on one of the big bouts. The
      newspapers covered acres of paper for weeks beforehand with
      gossip and prognostications from the training-camps; public
      interest was whipped up by such devices as signed
      articles--widely syndicated--in which the contestants
      berated each other (both sets of articles, in one case,
      being written by the same "ghost"), and even a paper so
      traditionally conservative in its treatment of sports as
      the <i>New York Times</i> announced the result of a major
      bout with three streamer headlines running all the way
      across its front page. One hundred and thirty thousand
      people watched Tunney outbox a weary Dempsey at
      Philadelphia and paid nearly two million dollars for the
      privilege; one hundred and forty-five thousand people
      watched the return match at Chicago and the receipts
      reached the incredible sum of $2,600,000. Compare that sum
      with the trifling $452,000 taken in when Dempsey gained his
      title from Willard in 1919 and you have a measure of what
      had happened in a few years. So enormous was the
      amphitheater at Chicago that two-thirds of the people in
      the outermost seats did not know who had won when the fight
      was over. Nor was the audience limited to the throng in
      Chicago, for millions more--forty million, the radio people
      claimed--heard the breathless story of it, blow by blow,
      over the radio. During the seventh round--when Tunney fell
      and the referee, by delaying the beginning of his count
      until Dempsey had reached his corner, gave Tunney some
      thirteen seconds to recover--five Americans dropped dead of
      heart failure at their radios. Five other deaths were
      attributed to the excitement of hearing the radio story of
      the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally remarkable was the aftermath of these two mighty
      contests. Dempsey had been a mauler at the beginning of the
      decade; he was an ex-mauler at its end. Not so Tunney. From
      the pinnacle of his fame he stepped neatly off on to those
      upper levels of literary and fashionable society in which
      heavyweight champions, haloed by publicity, were newly
      welcome. Having received $1,742,282 in three years for his
      prowess in the ring, Tunney lectured on Shakespeare before
      Professor Phelps's class at Yale, went for a walking trip
      in Europe with Thornton Wilder (author of the best-selling
      novel of the year, <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i>),
      married a young gentlewoman of Greenwich, Connecticut, and
      after an extensive stay abroad returned to the United
      States with his bride, giving out on his arrival a prepared
      statement which, if not quite Shakespearian or Wilderesque
      in its style, at least gave evidence of effort:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It is hard to realize as our ship passes through the
      Narrows that fifteen months have elapsed since the
      <i>Mauretania</i> was carrying me in the other direction.
      During those fifteen months Mrs. Tunney and I have visited
      many countries and have met some very interesting people.
      We thoroughly enjoyed our travels, but find the greatest
      joy of all in again being home with our people and
      friends.<br>
      <br>
      The echo of a rumor at home that I am contemplating
      returning to the boxing game to defend the heavyweight
      championship reached me in Italy. This is in no sense true,
      for I have permanently ended my public career. My great
      work now is to live quietly and simply, for this manner of
      living brings me most happiness.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The sports writers were decidedly cool toward Tunney's
      post-boxing career. But he was simply exercising the
      ancient democratic prerogative of rising higher than his
      source. Ballyhoo had exalted him to the skies, and he took
      advantage of it to leave the dubious atmosphere of the
      pugilistic world and seek more salubrious airs.

      As 1925 gave way to 1926, the searchlight of public
      attention had shifted from Red Grange to the marriage of
      Irving Berlin and Ellin Mackay, showing that the curiosity
      of millions is no respecter of personal privacy; to the
      gallant rescue of the men of the steamship <i>Antinoë</i>
      in mid-ocean by Captain Fried of the <i>President
      Roosevelt;</i> to the exclusion from the United States of
      Vera, Countess Cathcart, on the uncomplimentary ground of
      moral turpitude; to Byrd's daring flight over the North
      Pole; and, as the summer of 1926 arrived, to the
      disappearance from a bathing beach of Aimee Semple
      McPherson, evangelist of a Four-Square Gospel made in
      California--a disappearance that was to prove the first of
      a series of opera-bouffe episodes which for years attracted
      wide-eyed tourists in droves to Mrs. McPherson's Angelus
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer passed--the summer when the English Channel was
      full of swimmers, the brown jacket of <i>The Private Life
      of Helen of Troy</i> ornamented thousands of cottage
      tables, girls in knee-length skirts and horizontally
      striped sweaters were learning to dance the Charleston, and
      the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial was sinking deeper and
      deeper into the red despite the aid of the Dempsey-Tunney
      fight. Toward the season's end there was a striking
      demonstration of what astute press-agentry could do to make
      a national sensation. A young man named Rudolph Alfonzo
      Raffaele Pierre Filibert Guglielmi di Valentina
      d'Antonguolla died in New York at the age of thirty-one.
      The love-making of Rudolph Valentino (as he had
      understandably preferred to call himself) had quickened the
      pulses of innumerable motion-picture addicts; with his
      sideburns and his passionate air, "the sheik" had set the
      standard for masculine sex appeal. But his lying in state
      in an undertaker's establishment on Broadway would hardly
      have attracted a crowd which stretched through eleven
      blocks if his manager had not arranged the scenes of grief
      with uncanny skill, and if Harry C. Klemfuss, the
      undertaker's press agent, had not provided the newspapers
      with everything they could desire--such as photographs,
      distributed in advance, of the chamber where the actor's
      body would lie, and posed photographs of the funeral
      cortège. (One of these latter pictures, according to Silas
      Bent, was on the streets in one newspaper before the
      funeral procession started.) With such practical
      assistance, the press gave itself to the affair so
      whole-heartedly that mobs rioted about the undertaker's and
      scores of people were injured. Sweet are the uses of
      publicity: Valentino had been heavily in debt when he died,
      but his posthumous films, according to his manager's
      subsequent testimony, turned the debt into a $600,000
      balance to the credit of his estate. High-minded citizens
      regretted that the death of Charles William Eliot, which
      occurred at about the same time, occasioned no such
      spectacular lamentations. But the president emeritus of
      Harvard had had no professional talent to put over his
      funeral in a big way.

      Tunney beat Dempsey, a hurricane contributed the
      <i>coup-de-grâce</i> to the Florida boom, Queen Marie of
      Rumania sniffed the profits of ballyhoo from afar and made
      a royal visit to the United States; and then for months on
      end in the winter of 1926-27 the American people waded deep
      in scandal and crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four long years since the Reverend Edward W. Hall
      and Mrs. Eleanor R. Mills had been found murdered near the
      crab-apple tree by DeRussey's Lane outside New Brunswick,
      New Jersey. In 1922 the grand jury had found no indictment.
      But in 1926 a tabloid newspaper in search of more
      circulation dug up what purported to be important new
      evidence and got the case reopened. Mrs. Hall was
      arrested--at such an unholy hour of the night that the
      reporters and photographers of this tabloid got a
      scoop--and she and her two brothers, Henry and Willie
      Stevens, were brought to trial, thus providing thrills for
      the readers not only of the tabloid in question, but of
      every other newspaper in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most sensational scene in this most sensational trial
      of the decade took place when Jane Gibson, the "pig woman,"
      who was supposed to be dying, was brought from her hospital
      to the courtroom on a stretcher and placed on a bed facing
      the jury. Mrs. Gibson told a weird story. She had been
      pestered by corn-robbers, it seemed, and on the night of
      the murder, hearing the rattle of a wagon that she thought
      might contain the robbers, she saddled Jenny, her mule, and
      followed the wagon down DeRussey's Lane, "peeking and
      peeking and peeking." She saw a car in the Lane, with two
      people in it whom she identified as Mrs. Hall and Willie
      Stevens. She tethered Jenny to a cedar tree, heard the
      sound of a quarrel and a voice saying, "Explain these
      letters"; she saw Henry and Willie Stevens in the gleam of
      a flashlight, she heard shots, and then she fled in terror
      all the way home--only to find that she had left a moccasin
      behind. Despite her fear, she went all the way back to get
      that moccasin, and heard what she thought was the
      screeching of an owl, but found it was a woman crying--"a
      big white-haired woman doing something with her hand,
      crying something." She said this woman was Mrs. Hall. All
      this testimony the "pig woman" gave from her bed in a
      wailing voice, while trained nurses stood beside her and
      took her pulse; then, crying out to the defendants, "I have
      told the truth! So help me God! And you know I've told the
      truth!" she was borne from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testimony of the "pig woman" did not gain in force from
      what was brought out about her previous checkered career;
      it would have made even less impression upon the jury had
      they known that their "dying witness," whose appearance in
      the courtroom had been so ingeniously staged, was destined
      to live four years more. Mrs. Hall and her brothers came
      magnificently through their ordeal, slow-witted Willie
      Stevens in particular delighting millions of murder-trial
      fans by the way in which he stoutly resisted the efforts of
      Senator Simpson to bullyrag him into confusion. The new
      evidence dug up by the tabloid--consisting chiefly of a
      calling-card which was supposed to have Willie Steven's
      fingerprint on it--did not impress the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the prosecution's case thus collapsed, the
      reputation of the Stevens family had been butchered to make
      a Roman holiday of the first magnitude for newspaper
      readers. Five million words were written and sent from
      Somerville, New Jersey, during the first eleven days of the
      trial. Twice as many newspapermen were there as at Dayton.
      The reporters included Mary Roberts Rinehart, the novelist,
      Billy Sunday, the revivalist, and James Mills, the husband
      of the murdered choir-singer; and the man who had claimed
      the mantle of Bryan as the leader of Fundamentalism, the
      Reverend John Roach Straton, wrote a daily editorial
      moralizing about the case. Over wires jacked into the
      largest telegraph switchboard in the world traveled the
      tidings of lust and crime to every corner of the United
      States, and the public lapped them up and cried for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So insistently did they cry that when, a few short months
      later, an art editor named Albert Snyder was killed with a
      sash-weight by his wife and her lover, a corset salesman
      named Judd Gray, once more the forces of ballyhoo got into
      action. In this case there was no mystery, nor was the
      victim highly placed; the only excuses for putting the
      Snyder-Gray trial on the front page were that it involved a
      sex triangle and that the Snyders were ordinary people
      living in an ordinary New York suburb--the sort of people
      with whom the ordinary reader could easily identify
      himself. Yet so great was the demand for vicarious horrors
      that once more the great Western Union switchboard was
      brought into action, an even more imposing galaxy of
      special writers interpreted the sordid drama (including
      David Wark Griffith, Peggy Joyce, and Will Durant, as well
      as Mrs. Rinehart, Billy Sunday, and Doctor Straton), and
      once more the American people tasted blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interval between the Hall-Mills case and the
      Snyder-Gray case, they had had a chance to roll an even
      riper scandal on their tongues. Frances Heenan Browning,
      known to the multitude as "Peaches," brought suit for
      separation from Edward W. Browning, a New York real-estate
      man who had a penchant for giving to very young girls the
      delights of a Cinderella. Supposedly sober and reputable
      newspapers recited the unedifying details of "Daddy"
      Browning's adventures; and when the <i>New York
      Graphic,</i> a tabloid, printed a "composograph" of
      Browning in pajamas shouting "Woof! Woof! Don't be a goof!"
      to his half-clad wife because--according to the
      caption--she "refused to parade nude," even the <i>Daily
      News,</i> which in the past had shown no distaste for
      scandal, expressed its fear that if such things went on the
      public would be "drenched in obscenity."
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many people felt as the <i>Daily News</i> did, and
      regarded with dismay the depths to which the public taste
      seemed to have fallen. Surely a change must come, they
      thought. This carnival of commercialized degradation could
      not continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change came--suddenly.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the Brevoort and Lafayette Hotels in New York,
      Raymond Orteig, had offered--way back in 1919--a prize of
      $25,000 for the first non-stop flight between New York and
      Paris. Only a few days after the conclusion of the
      Snyder-Gray trial, three planes were waiting for favorable
      weather conditions to hop off from Roosevelt Field, just
      outside New York, in quest of this prize: the
      <i>Columbia,</i> which was to be piloted by Clarence
      Chamberlin and Lloyd Bertaud; the <i>America,</i> with
      Lieutenant-Commander Byrd of North Pole fame in command;
      and the <i>Spirit of St. Louis,</i> which had abruptly
      arrived from the Pacific coast with a lone young man named
      Charles A. Lindbergh at the controls. There was no telling
      which of the three planes would get off first, but clearly
      the public favorite was the young man from the West. He was
      modest, he seemed to know his business, there was something
      particularly daring about his idea of making the perilous
      journey alone, and he was as attractive-looking a youngster
      as ever had faced a camera man. The reporters--to his
      annoyance--called him "Lucky Lindy" and the "Flying Fool."
      The spotlight of publicity was upon him. Not yet, however,
      was he a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of May 19, 1927, Lindbergh decided that
      although it was drizzling on Long Island, the weather
      reports gave a chance of fair skies for his trip and he had
      better get ready. He spent the small hours of the next
      morning in sleepless preparations, went to Curtiss Field,
      received further weather news, had his plane trundled to
      Roosevelt Field and fueled, and a little before eight
      o'clock--on the morning of May 20th--climbed in and took
      off for Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something very like a miracle took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the word been flashed along the wires that
      Lindbergh had started than the whole population of the
      country became united in the exaltation of a common
      emotion. Young and old, rich and poor, farmer and
      stockbroker, Fundamentalist and skeptic, highbrow and
      lowbrow, all with one accord fastened their hopes upon the
      young man in the <i>Spirit of St. Louis.</i> To give a
      single instance of the intensity of their mood: at the
      Yankee Stadium in New York, where the Maloney-Sharkey fight
      was held on the evening of the 20th, forty thousand
      hard-boiled boxing fans rose as one man and stood with
      bared heads in impressive silence when the announcer asked
      them to pray for Lindbergh. The next day came the
      successive reports of Lindbergh's success--he had reached
      the Irish coast, he was crossing over England, he was over
      the Channel, he had landed at Le Bourget to be
      enthusiastically mobbed by a vast crowd of Frenchmen--and
      the American people went almost mad with joy and relief.
      And when the reports of Lindbergh's first few days in Paris
      showed that he was behaving with charming modesty and
      courtesy, millions of his countrymen took him to their
      hearts as they had taken no other human being in living
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every record for mass excitement and mass enthusiasm in the
      age of ballyhoo was smashed during the next few weeks.
      Nothing seemed to matter, either to the newspapers or to
      the people who read them, but Lindbergh and his story. On
      the day the flight was completed the <i>Washington Star</i>
      sold 16,000 extra copies, the <i>St.</i> <i>Louis
      Post-Dispatch</i> 40,000, the <i>New York Evening World</i>
      114,000. The huge headlines which described Lindbergh's
      triumphal progress from day to day in newspapers from Maine
      to Oregon showed how thorough was public agreement with the
      somewhat extravagant dictum of the <i>Evening World</i>
      that Lindbergh had performed "the greatest feat of a
      solitary man in the records of the human race." Upon his
      return to the United States, a single Sunday issue of a
      single paper contained one hundred columns of text and
      pictures devoted to him. Nobody appeared to question the
      fitness of President Coolidge's action in sending a cruiser
      of the United States navy to bring this young private
      citizen and his plane back from France. He was greeted in
      Washington at a vast open-air gathering at which the
      President made--according to Charles Merz--"the longest and
      most impressive address since his annual message to
      Congress." The Western Union having provided form messages
      for telegrams of congratulations to Lindbergh on his
      arrival, 55,000 of them were sent to him--and were loaded
      on a truck and trundled after him in the parade through
      Washington. One telegram, from Minneapolis, was signed with
      17,500 names and made up a scroll 520 feet long, under
      which ten messenger boys staggered. After the public
      welcome in New York, the Street Cleaning Department
      gathered up 1,800 tons of paper which had been torn up and
      thrown out of windows of office buildings to make a
      snowstorm of greeting--1,800 tons as against a mere 155
      tons swept up after the premature Armistice celebration of
      November 7, 1918!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindbergh was commissioned Colonel, and received the
      Distinguished Flying Cross, the Congressional Medal of
      Honor, and so many foreign decorations and honorary
      memberships that to repeat the list would be a weary task.
      He was offered two and a half million dollars for a tour of
      the world by air, and $700,000 to appear in the films; his
      signature was sold for $1,600; a Texas town was named for
      him, a thirteen-hundred-foot Lindbergh tower was proposed
      for the city of Chicago, "the largest dinner ever tendered
      to an individual in modern history" was consumed in his
      honor, and a staggering number of streets, schools,
      restaurants, and corporations sought to share the glory of
      his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was there any noticeable group of dissenters from all
      this hullabaloo. Whatever else people might disagree about,
      they joined in praise of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To appreciate how extraordinary was this universal
      outpouring of admiration and love--for the word love is
      hardly too strong--one must remind oneself of two or three
      facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindbergh's flight was not the first crossing of the
      Atlantic by air. Alcock and Brown had flown direct from
      Newfoundland to Ireland in 1919. That same year the N-C 4,
      with five men aboard, had crossed by way of the Azores, and
      the British dirigible R-34 had flown from Scotland to Long
      Island with 31 men aboard, and then had turned about and
      made a return flight to England. The German dirigible ZR-3
      (later known as the <i>Los Angeles)</i> had flown from
      Friedrichshafen to Lakehurst, New Jersey, in 1924 with 32
      people aboard. Two Round-the-World American army planes had
      crossed the North Atlantic by way of Iceland, Greenland,
      and Newfoundland in 1924. The novelty of Lindbergh's flight
      lay only in the fact that he went all the way from New York
      to Paris instead of jumping off from Newfoundland, that he
      reached his precise objective, and that he went alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, there was little practical advantage in such
      an exploit. It brought about a boom in aviation, to be
      sure, but a not altogether healthy one, and it led many a
      flyer to hop off blindly for foreign shores in emulation of
      Lindbergh and be drowned. Looking back on the event after a
      lapse of years, and stripping it of its emotional
      connotations, one sees it simply as a daring stunt
      flight--the longest up to that time--by a man who did not
      claim to be anything but a stunt flyer. Why, then, this
      idolization of Lindbergh?
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation is simple. A disillusioned nation fed on
      cheap heroics and scandal and crime was revolting against
      the low estimate of human nature which it had allowed
      itself to entertain. For years the American people had been
      spiritually starved. They had seen their early ideals and
      illusions and hopes one by one worn away by the corrosive
      influence of events and ideas--by the disappointing
      aftermath of the war, by scientific doctrines and
      psychological theories which undermined their religion and
      ridiculed their sentimental notions, by the spectacle of
      graft in politics and crime on the city streets, and
      finally by their recent newspaper diet of smut and murder.
      Romance, chivalry and self-dedication had been debunked;
      the heroes of history had been shown to have feet of clay,
      and the saints of history had been revealed as people with
      queer complexes. There was the god of business to
      worship--but a suspicion lingered that he was made of
      brass. Ballyhoo had given the public contemporary heroes to
      bow down before--but these contemporary heroes, with their
      fat profits from moving-picture contracts and ghost-written
      syndicated articles, were not wholly convincing. Something
      that people needed, if they were to live at peace with
      themselves and with the world, was missing from their
      lives. And all at once Lindbergh provided it. Romance,
      chivalry, self-dedication--here they were, embodied in a
      modern Galahad for a generation which had foresworn
      Galahads. Lindbergh did not accept the moving-picture
      offers that came his way, he did not sell testimonials, did
      not boast, did not get himself involved in scandal,
      conducted himself with unerring taste--and was handsome and
      brave withal. The machinery of ballyhoo was ready and
      waiting to lift him up where every eye could see him. Is it
      any wonder that the public's reception of him took on the
      aspects of a vast religious revival?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindbergh did not go back on his admirers. He undertook a
      series of exhibition flights and good-will
      flights--successfully and with quiet dignity. He married a
      daughter of the ambassador to Mexico, and in so doing
      delighted the country by turning the tables on ballyhoo
      itself--by slipping away with his bride on a motor-boat and
      remaining hidden for days despite the efforts of hundreds
      of newspapermen to spy upon his honeymoon. Wherever he
      went, crowds fought for a chance to be near him, medals
      were pinned upon him, tributes were showered upon him, his
      coming and going was news. He packed away a good-sized
      fortune earned chiefly as consultant for aviation
      companies, but few people grudged him that. Incredibly, he
      kept his head and his instinct for fine conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he remained a national idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even three and four years after his flight, the roads about
      his New Jersey farm were blocked on week-ends with the cars
      of admirers who wanted to catch a glimpse of him, and it
      was said that he could not even send his shirts to a
      laundry because they did not come back--they were too
      valuable as souvenirs. His picture hung in hundreds of
      schoolrooms and in thousands of houses. No living
      American--no dead American, one might almost say, save
      perhaps Abraham Lincoln--commanded such unswerving fealty.
      You might criticize Coolidge or Hoover or Ford or Edison or
      Bobby Jones or any other headline hero; but if you decried
      anything that Lindbergh did, you knew that you had wounded
      your auditors. For Lindbergh was a god.

    <p>
      Pretty good, one reflects, for a stunt flyer. But also, one
      must add, pretty good for the American people. They had
      shown that they had better taste in heroes than anyone
      would have dared to predict during the years which
      immediately preceded the 20th of May, 1927.

      After Lindbergh's flight the profits of heroism were so
      apparent that a horde of seekers after cash and glory
      appeared, not all of whom seemed to realize that one of the
      things which had endeared Lindbergh to his admirers had
      been his indifference both to easy money and to applause.
      The formula was simple. You got an airplane, some financial
      backing, and a press agent, and made the first non-stop
      flight from one place to another place (there were still
      plenty of places that nobody had flown between). You
      arranged in advance to sell your personal story to a
      syndicate if you were successful. If necessary you could
      get a good deal of your equipment without paying for it, on
      condition that the purveyors of your oil or your flying
      suit or your five-foot shelf might say how useful you had
      found it. Having landed at your destination--and on the
      front pages--you promptly sold your book, your
      testimonials, your appearance in vaudeville, your
      appearance in the movies, or whatever else there was demand
      for. If you did not know how to pilot a plane you could
      still be a passenger; a woman passenger, in fact, had
      better news value than a male pilot. And if flying seemed a
      little hazardous for your personal taste, you could get
      useful publicity by giving a prize for other people to fly
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Chamberlin followed Lindbergh across the Atlantic,
      Charles A. Levine, the owner of the plane, was an extremely
      interested passenger. He got an official welcome at New
      York. Everybody was getting official welcomes at New York.
      Grover Whalen, the well-dressed Police Commissioner, was
      taking incessant advantage of what Alva Johnston called the
      great discovery that anybody riding up Broadway at noon
      with a motorcycle escort would find thousands of people
      gathered there in honor of luncheon. British open golf
      champions, Channel swimmers, and the Italian soccer team
      were greeted by Mr. Whalen as deferentially as the Persian
      Minister of Finance and the Mayor of Leipzig, and it was
      always fun for the citizenry to have an excuse to throw
      ticker tape and fragments of the Bronx telephone directory
      out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Byrd and his men hopped off from Roosevelt Field a few
      weeks after Chamberlin and Levine, and came down in the
      sea--but so close to the French coast that they waded
      ashore. Brock and Schlee not only crossed the Atlantic, but
      continued on in a series of flights till they reached
      Japan. And then a good-looking dentist's assistant from
      Lakeland. Florida, named Ruth Elder, who had been taking
      flying lessons from George Haldeman, got a citrus-grower
      and a real-estate man to back her, and Haldeman to pilot
      her, and set out to become the first woman transatlantic
      airplane rider. She dropped into the sea much too far out
      to wade ashore, as it happened; but what matter? She and
      Haldeman were picked up providentially by a tanker; her
      manager did good business for her; and she got her
      welcome--though the City of New York spent only $333.90 on
      greeting her, as compared with more than $1,000 for Levine,
      $12,000 for the President of the Irish Free State, $26,000
      for Byrd, and $71,000 for Lindbergh.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Ruth Elder there were so many flights, successful or
      disastrous, that one could hardly keep track of them. They
      were always front-page news, but they were less exciting
      than the unveiling of the new Ford (in December, 1927) and
      the sinking of the steamship <i>Vestris,</i> which (late in
      1928) was so hysterically reported that one might have
      imagined it to be the greatest marine disaster in history.
      There were no more Lindberghs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession of sporting heroes continued. Bobby Jones
      went on from triumph to triumph, until no one could doubt
      that he was the greatest golfer of all time. Babe Ruth
      remained the home-run king. Cagle and Booth gave the
      football writers a chance to be the romantic fellows they
      longed to be. Tilden was slipping, but could still beat
      almost anybody but a Frenchman. Prize-fighting, however,
      languished, and there were signs that the public taste in
      sporting exhibitions was becoming a little jaded. The
      efforts to find something novel enough to arouse the
      masters of ballyhoo became almost pathological: Marathon
      dancers clung to one another by the hour and day and week,
      shuffling about the floor in an agony of weariness, and the
      unhappy participants in C. C. Pyle's "Bunion Derby" ran
      across the continent with results painful both to their
      feet and to Mr. Pyle's fortunes as a promoter. Thousands
      stood and gaped while Alvin Shipwreck Kelly sat on a
      flagpole. There was still money in breaking records, even
      if your achievement was that of perching on a flagpole in
      Baltimore for 23 days and 7 hours, having your food and
      drink hoisted to you in a bucket, and hiring a man to shout
      at you if you showed signs of dozing for more than twenty
      minutes at a time. But nobody seemed to be persuaded that
      there was anything epic about Mr. Kelly. Flagpole sitting
      and Marathon dancing were just freak shows to watch in an
      idle moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the bloom of youth was departing from ballyhoo: the
      technique was becoming a little too obvious. Perhaps
      Lindbergh had spoiled the public for lesser heroes. Perhaps
      the grim execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927 and the
      presidential campaign of 1928 reminded a well-fed people
      that there were such things as public issues, after all.
      But perhaps, too, there was some significance in the fact
      that in March, 1928, only a few months after the new Ford
      appeared and less than a year after Lindbergh's flight, the
      Big Bull Market went into its sensational phase. A
      ten-point gain in Radio common in a single day promised
      more immediate benefits than all the non-stop flyers and
      heavyweight champions in the world.

    <p>
      By the end of the war with Germany, social compulsion had
      become a national habit. The typical American of the old
      stock had never had more than a half-hearted enthusiasm for
      the rights of the minority; bred in a pioneer tradition, he
      had been accustomed to set his community in order by the
      first means that came to hand--a sumptuary law, a vigilance
      committee, or if necessary a shotgun. Declarations of
      Independence and Bills of Rights were all very well in the
      history books, but when he was running things himself he
      had usually been open to the suggestion that liberty was
      another name for license and that the Bill of Rights was
      the last resort of scoundrels. During the war he had
      discovered how easy it was to legislate and propagandize
      and intimidate his neighbors into what seemed to him
      acceptable conduct, and after peace was declared he went on
      using the same sort of methods to see that they continued
      to conform.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Liberty-loan campaigns--with a quota for everybody and
      often a threat for those who were slow to contribute--he
      turned to community-chest drives and college-endowment-fund
      drives and church-membership drives and town-boosting
      drives and a multitude of other public campaigns:
      committees and subcommittees were organized, press agents
      distributed their canned releases, orators bellowed, and
      the man who kept a tight grip on his pocketbook felt the
      uncomfortable pressure of mass opinion. From the coercion
      of alien enemies and supposed pro-Germans it was a short
      step, as we have seen, to the coercion of racial minorities
      and supposed Bolsheviks. From war-time censorship it was a
      short step to peace-time censorship of newspapers and books
      and public speech. And from legislating sobriety in
      war-time it was a short step to imbedding prohibition
      permanently in the Constitution and trying to write the
      moral code of the majority into the statute-books.
      Business, to be sure, was freed of most of the shackles
      which had bound it in 1917 and 1918, for the average
      American now identified his own interests with those of
      business. But outside of business he thought he knew how
      people ought to behave, and he would stand for no nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the early days of the Big Red Scare, the American
      middle-class majority met with little resistance in its
      stern measures against radicalism and its insistence upon
      <i>laissez faire</i> for business. While labor was being
      cowed by the police or lured into compliance by stock
      ownership and the hope of riches, the educated liberals who
      a few years before had been ready to die at the barricades
      for minimum-wage laws and equal suffrage and the right to
      collective bargaining were sinking into hopeless
      discouragement. Politics, they were deciding, was a vulgar
      mess; the morons always outnumbered the enlightened, the
      tobacco-spitting district leaders held the morons in a firm
      grip, and the right to vote was a joke. Welfare work was
      equally futile: it was stuffy, sentimental, and
      presumptuous. The bright young college graduate who in 1915
      would have risked disinheritance to march in a Socialist
      parade yawned at Socialism in 1925, called it old stuff,
      and cared not at all whether the employees of the Steel
      Corporation were underpaid or overpaid. Fashions had
      changed: now the young insurgent enraged his father by
      arguing against monogamy and God.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, the middle-class majority turned from
      persecuting political radicals to regulating personal
      conduct, they met with bitter opposition not only from the
      bright young college graduate but from the whole of a newly
      class-conscious group. The intellectuals of the
      country--the "civilized minority," as the <i>American
      Mercury</i> liked to call them--rose in loud and bitter
      revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were never an organized group, these embattled
      highbrows. They differed vehemently among themselves, and
      even if they had agreed, the idea of organizing would have
      been repugnant to them as individualists. They were widely
      dispersed; New York was their chief rallying-point, but
      groups of them were to be found in all the other urban
      centers. They consisted mostly of artists and writers,
      professional people, the intellectually restless element in
      the college towns, and such members of the college-educated
      business class as could digest more complicated literature
      than was to be found in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>
      and <i>McCall's Magazine;</i> and they were followed by an
      ill-assorted mob of faddists who were ready to take up with
      the latest idea. They may be roughly and inclusively
      defined as the men and women who had heard of James Joyce,
      Proust, Cézanne, Jung, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey,
      Petronius, Eugene O'Neill, and Eddington; who looked down
      on the movies but revered Charlie Chaplin as a great
      artist, could talk about relativity even if they could not
      understand it, knew a few of the leading complexes by name,
      collected Early American furniture, had ideas about
      progressive education, and doubted the divinity of Henry
      Ford and Calvin Coolidge. Few in numbers though they were,
      they were highly vocal, and their influence not merely
      dominated American literature but filtered down to affect
      by slow degrees the thought of the entire country.
    </p>
    <p>
      These intellectuals felt the full disenchantment of the
      Peace of Versailles while the returning heroes of
      Armageddon were still parading past the reviewing-stands.
      The dreary story of a brutal war and a sordid settlement
      was spread before their resentful eyes in books like Sir
      Philip Gibb's <i>Now It Can Be Told,</i> John Dos Passos's
      <i>Three Soldiers,</i> E. E. Cummings's <i>The Enormous
      Room,</i> and John Maynard Keynes's <i>Economic
      Consequences of the Peace.</i> They were early converts to
      the devastating new psychology; the more youthful of them,
      in fact, were petting according to Freud while their less
      tutored contemporaries were petting simply because they
      liked it and could get away with it. Many of the
      intellectuals had felt the loss of certainty which resulted
      from new scientific knowledge long before the word
      Fundamentalism had even been coined or the Einstein theory
      had reached the research laboratories. Their revolt against
      the frock-coated respectability and decorous formality of
      American literature had been under way for several years;
      Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Carl Sandburg, Edgar Lee
      Masters, Robert Frost, Vachel Lindsay, Amy Lowell, and the
      Imagists and exponents of free verse had been breaking new
      ground since before the war. When twenty of the
      intellectuals collaborated in the writing of
      <i>Civilization in the United States</i> (published in 1922
      under the editorship of Harold Stearns) they summed up the
      opinion of thousands of their class in their agreement that
      "the most amusing and pathetic fact in the social life of
      America today is its emotional and æsthetic starvation."
      But the revolt of the highbrows against this emotional and
      æsthetic starvation, and against "the mania for petty
      regulation" to which it led, would hardly have gathered
      imposing force as soon as it did had Sinclair Lewis not
      brought out <i>Main Street</i> in October, 1920, and
      <i>Babbitt</i> some two years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of these two books was overwhelming. In two
      volumes of merciless literary photography and searing
      satire, Lewis revealed the ugliness of the American small
      town, the cultural poverty of its life, the tyranny of its
      mass prejudices, and the blatant vulgarity and insularity
      of the booster. There were other things which he failed to
      reveal--such as the friendly sentiment and easy generosity
      of the Gopher Prairies and Zeniths of America--but his
      books were all the more widely devoured for their very
      one-sidedness. By the end of 1922 the sale of <i>Main
      Street</i> had reached 390,000 copies. The intellectuals
      had only to read Lewis's books to realize that the
      qualities in American life which they most despised and
      feared were precisely the ones which he put under the
      microscope for cold-blooded examination. It was George F.
      Babbitt who was the arch enemy of the enlightened, and it
      was the Main Street state of mind which stood in the way of
      American civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      After <i>Babbitt,</i> a flood of books reflected the
      dissatisfaction of the highbrows with the rule of America
      by the businessman and their growing disillusionment. The
      keynoter of this revolt, its chief tomtom beater, was H. L.
      Mencken.

      For several years Mencken, a Baltimorean trained in
      newspaper work on the <i>Baltimore Sun,</i> had been
      editing the <i>Smart Set</i> in company with George Jean
      Nathan. The <i>Smart Set</i> did not prosper; its name and
      its somewhat dubious previous reputation were against it.
      When it was languishing Alfred A. Knopf, the
      book-publisher, engaged Mencken and Nathan to conduct a new
      monthly magazine addressed to the intellectual left wing,
      and the first issue of the <i>American Mercury</i> appeared
      at the close of 1923. This--if you are uncertain about
      dates--was a few weeks before Woodrow Wilson's death; it
      was at the moment when Senator Walsh was trying to find out
      who had bestowed money upon Secretary Fall, when Richard
      Simon was about to hatch the <i>Cross-Word Puzzle Book</i>
      idea, and the Bok Peace Prize was about to be awarded to
      Charles H. Levermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green cover of the <i>Mercury</i> and its format were
      as sedate as the marble-trimmed façade of Mencken's house
      in Baltimore, but its contents were explosive. It carried
      over from the <i>Smart Set</i> as regular features
      Mencken's literary notes, Nathan's theatrical criticisms, a
      series of editorial jottings which had been called
      Répétition Generale and now became Clinical Notes, and a
      museum of American absurdities known as Americana. Every
      month Mencken occupied several pages with a polemic against
      the lowbrow majority and its works. The magazine lustily
      championed writers such as Dreiser, Cabell, Sherwood
      Anderson, Willa Cather, and Sinclair Lewis, who defied the
      polite traditions represented by the American Academy of
      Arts and Letters; it poured critical acid upon
      sentimentality and evasion and academic pomposity in books
      and in life; it lambasted Babbitts, Rotarians, Methodists,
      and reformers, ridiculed both the religion of Coolidge
      Prosperity and what Mencken called the "bilge of idealism,"
      and looked upon the American scene in general with raucous
      and profane laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Mercury</i> made an immediate hit. It was new,
      startling, and delightfully destructive. It crystallized
      the misgivings of thousands. Soon its green cover was
      clasped under the arms of the young iconoclasts of a score
      of college campuses. Staid small-town executives, happening
      upon it, were shocked and bewildered; this man Mencken,
      they decided, must be a debauched and shameless monster if
      not a latter-day emissary of the devil. When Mencken
      visited Dayton to report the Scopes trial and called the
      Daytonians yokels, hillbillies, and peasants, the Reverend
      A. C. Stribling replied that Mencken was a "cheap
      blatherskite of a pen-pusher"; and to such retorts there
      was a large section of outraged public opinion ready to cry
      Amen. After a few years so much abuse had been heaped upon
      the editor of the <i>Mercury</i> that it was possible to
      publish for the delectation of his admirers a
      <i>Schimpflexicon</i>--a book made up entirely of highly
      uncomplimentary references to him. Meanwhile the
      circulation of his magazine climbed to more than 77,000 by
      1927; and in that same year Walter Lippmann called him,
      without exaggeration, "the most powerful personal influence
      on this whole generation of educated people."
    </p>
    <p>
      To many readers it seemed as if Mencken were against
      everything. This was not true, but certainly rebellion was
      the breath of his life. He was "against all theologians,
      professors, editorial-writers, right thinkers, and
      reformers" (to quote his own words). He was "against
      patriotism because it demands the acceptance of
      propositions that are obviously imbecile--<i>e.g.,</i> that
      an American Presbyterian is the equal of Anatole France,
      Brahms, or Ludendorff." He did not believe that "civilized
      life was possible under a democracy." He spoke of
      socialists and anarchists as fools. He was against
      prohibition, censorship, and all other interferences with
      personal liberty. He scoffed at morality and Christian
      marriage. There was an apparent inconsistency in this
      formidable collection of prejudices: how, some of his
      critics asked, could one expect an aristocracy of
      intellect, such as he preferred, to permit such liberties
      as he insisted upon, unless it happened to be made up
      entirely of Menckens--a rather unlikely premise?
      Inconsistencies, however, bothered Mencken not at all, and
      at first bothered few of his followers. For it was not easy
      to be coolly analytical in the face of such a prose style
      as he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought to his offensive against the lowbrows an
      unparalleled vocabulary of invective. He pelted his enemies
      with words and phrases like mountebank, charlatan,
      swindler, numskull, swine, witch-burner, <i>homo
      boobiens,</i> and imbecile; he said of sentimentalists that
      they squirted rosewater about, of Bryan that "he was born
      with a roaring voice and it had a trick of inflaming
      half-wits," of books which he disliked that they were
      garbage; he referred to the guileless farmers of Tennessee
      as "gaping primates" and "the anthropoid rabble." On
      occasion--as in his scholarly book on <i>The American
      Language</i>--Mencken could write measured and precise
      English, but when his blood was up, his weapons were gross
      exaggeration and gross metaphors. The moment he appeared
      the air was full of flying brick-bats; and to read him for
      the first time gave one, if not blind rage, the sort of
      intense visceral delight which comes from heaving baseballs
      at crockery in an amusement park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years when Mencken's wholesale idol-smashing first
      attracted wide attention, be it remembered, were the very
      years when the prosperity chorus was in full voice, Bruce
      Barton was revising Christian doctrine for the
      glorification of the higher salesmanship, the
      Fundamentalists were on the rampage against evolution, and
      the Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public
      Morals was trying to mold the country into sober
      conformity. Up to this time the intellectuals had been
      generally on the defensive. But now, with Mencken's noisy
      tub-thumping to give them assurance, they changed their
      tone. Other magazines joined, though less stridently, in
      the cry of dissent: <i>Harper's</i> put on an orange cover
      in 1925 and doubled its circulation by examining American
      life with a new critical boldness, <i>The Forum</i> debated
      subjects which Main Street considered undebatable, the
      <i>Atlantic</i> published the strictures of James Truslow
      Adams, and by the end of the decade even <i>Scribner's</i>
      was banned from the newsstands of Boston for printing a
      Hemingway serial. Books reflecting the intellectual
      minority's views of the United States and of life gushed
      from the presses. Slowly the volume of protest grew, until
      by 1926 or 1927 anybody who uttered a good word for Rotary
      or Bryan in any house upon whose walls hung a reproduction
      of Picasso or Marie Laurencin, or upon whose shelves stood
      <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> or <i>Notes on Democracy,</i> was
      likely to be set down as an incurable moron.

      What was the credo of the intellectuals during these years
      of revolt? Not many of them accepted all the propositions
      in the following rough summary; yet it suggests, perhaps,
      the general drift of their collective opinion:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. They believed in a greater degree of sex freedom than
      had been permitted by the strict American code; and as for
      discussion of sex, not only did they believe it should be
      free, but some of them appeared to believe it should be
      continuous. They formed the spearhead of the revolution in
      manners and morals which has been described in Chapter
      Five. From the early days of the decade, when they thrilled
      at the lackadaisical petting of F. Scott Fitzgerald's young
      thinkers and at the boldness of Edna St. Vincent Millay's
      announcement that her candle burned at both ends and could
      not last the night, to the latter days when they were all
      agog over the literature of homosexuality and went by the
      thousand to take Eugene O'Neill's five-hour lesson in
      psychopathology, <i>Strange Interlude,</i> they read about
      sex, talked about sex, thought about sex, and defied
      anybody to say No.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In particular, they defied the enforcement of propriety
      by legislation and detested all the influences to which
      they attributed it. They hated the Methodist lobby, John S.
      Sumner, and all other defenders of censorship; they
      pictured the Puritan, even of Colonial days, as a
      blue-nosed, cracked-voiced hypocrite; and they looked at
      Victorianism as half indecent and half funny. The literary
      reputations of Thackeray, Tennyson, Longfellow, and the
      Boston <i>literati</i> of the last century sank in their
      estimation to new lows for all time. Convinced that the era
      of short skirts and literary dalliance had brought a new
      enlightenment, the younger intellectuals laughed at the
      "Gay Nineties" as depicted in <i>Life</i> and joined Thomas
      Beer in condescending scrutiny of the voluminous dresses
      and fictional indirections of the Mauve Decade. Some of
      them, in fact, seemed to be persuaded that all periods
      prior to the coming of modernity had been ridiculous--with
      the exception of Greek civilization, Italy at the time of
      Casanova, France at the time of the great courtesans, and
      eighteenth-century England.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Most of them were passionate anti-prohibitionists, and
      this fact, together with their dislike of censorship and
      their skepticism about political and social regeneration,
      made them dubious about all reform movements and
      distrustful of all reformers. They emphatically did not
      believe that they were their brothers' keepers; anybody who
      did not regard tolerance as one of the supreme virtues was
      to them intolerable. If one heard at a single dinner party
      of advanced thinkers that there were "too many laws" and
      that people ought to be let alone, one heard it at a
      hundred. In 1915 the word reformer had been generally a
      complimentary term; in 1925 it had become--among the
      intellectuals, at least--a term of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. They were mostly, though not all, religious skeptics. If
      there was less shouting agnosticism and atheism in the
      nineteen-twenties than in the eighteen-nineties it was
      chiefly because disbelief was no longer considered
      sensational and because the irreligious intellectuals,
      feeling no evangelical urge to make over others in their
      own image, were content quietly to stay away from church.
      It is doubtful if any college undergraduate of the
      'nineties or of any other previous period in the United
      States could have said "No intelligent person believes in
      God any more" as blandly as undergraduates said it during
      the discussions of compulsory college chapel which raged
      during the 'twenties. Never before had so many books
      addressed to the thinking public assumed at the outset that
      their readers had rejected the old theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. They were united in a scorn of the great bourgeois
      majority which they held responsible for prohibition,
      censorship, Fundamentalism, and other repressions. They
      emulated Mencken in their disgust at Babbitts, Rotarians,
      the Ku Klux Klan, Service-with-a-Smile, boosters, and
      super-salesmen. Those of them who lived in the urban
      centers prided themselves on their superiority to the
      denizens of the benighted outlying cities and towns where
      Babbittry flourished; witness, for example, the motto of
      the <i>New Yorker</i> when it was first established in the
      middle of the decade: "Not for the old lady from Dubuque."
      Particularly did they despise the mobs of prosperous
      American tourists which surged through Europe; one could
      hardly occupy a steamer chair next to anybody who had
      Aldous Huxley's latest novel on his lap without being told
      of a delightful little restaurant somewhere in France which
      was quite "unspoiled by Americans."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. They took a particular pleasure in overturning the idols
      of the majority; hence the vogue among them of the practice
      for which W. E. Woodward, in a novel published in 1923,
      invented the word "debunking." Lytton Strachey's <i>Queen
      Victoria,</i> which had been a best seller in the United
      States in 1922, was followed by a deluge of debunking
      biographies. Rupert Hughes removed a few coats of whitewash
      from George Washington and nearly caused a riot when he
      declared in a speech that "Washington was a great
      card-player, a distiller of whisky, and a champion curser,
      and he danced for three hours without stopping with the
      wife of his principal general." Other American worthies
      were portrayed in all their erring humanity, and the
      notorious rascals of history were rediscovered as
      picturesque and glamorous fellows; until for a time it was
      almost taken for granted that a biographer, if he were to
      be successful, must turn conventional white into black and
      <i>vice versa.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      7. They feared the effect upon themselves and upon American
      culture of mass production and the machine, and saw
      themselves as fighting at the last ditch for the right to
      be themselves in a civilization which was being leveled
      into monotony by Fordismus and the chain-store mind. Their
      hatred of regimentation gave impetus to the progressive
      school movement and nourished such innovations in higher
      education as Antioch, Rollins, Meiklejohn's Experimental
      College at Wisconsin, and the honors plan at Swarthmore and
      elsewhere. It gave equal impetus to the little-theater
      movement, which made remarkable headway from coast to
      coast, especially in the schools. The heroes of current
      novels were depicted as being stifled in the air of the
      home town, and as fleeing for their cultural lives either
      to Manhattan or, better yet, to Montparnasse or the
      Riviera. In any café in Paris one might find an American
      expatriate thanking his stars that he was free from
      standardization at last, oblivious of the fact that there
      was no more standardized institution even in the land of
      automobiles and radio than the French sidewalk café. The
      intellectuals lapped up the criticisms of American culture
      offered them by foreign lecturers imported in
      record-breaking numbers, and felt no resentment when the
      best magazines flaunted before their eyes, month after
      month, titles like "Our American Stupidity" and "Childish
      Americans." They quite expected to be told that America was
      sinking into barbarism and was an altogether impossible
      place for a civilized person to live in--as when James
      Truslow Adams lamented in the <i>Atlantic Monthly,</i> "I
      am wondering, as a personal but practical question, just
      how and where a man of moderate means who prefers simple
      living, simple pleasures, and the things of the mind is
      going to be able to live any longer in his native country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of the American intellectuals of the nineteen-twenties,
      let it be repeated, subscribed to all the propositions in
      this credo; but he or she who accepted none of them was
      suspect among the enlightened. He was not truly civilized,
      he was not modern. The prosperity band-wagon rolled on, but
      by the wayside stood the highbrows with voices upraised in
      derision and dismay.

      Mencken enjoyed his battle enormously, cynic though he was.
      He went on to meet the armed men, and said among the
      trumpets, Ha-ha. Everything might be wrong with American
      civilization, but at least it made a lovely target for his
      blunderbuss. "If you find so much that is unworthy of
      reverence in the United States, then why do you live here?"
      he asked himself in the Fifth Series of his
      <i>Prejudices,</i> only to answer, "Why do men go to zoos?"
      Nobody had such a good time in the American zoo as Mencken;
      he even got a good laugh out of the Tennessee anthropoids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so, however, with most of his <i>confrères</i> in the
      camp of the intellectuals. The word disillusionment has
      been frequently employed in this history, for in a sense
      disillusionment (except about business and the physical
      luxuries and improvements which business would bring) was
      the keynote of the nineteen-twenties. With the majority of
      Americans its workings were perhaps unconscious; they felt
      a queer disappointment after the war, they felt that life
      was not giving them all they had hoped it would, they knew
      that some of the values which had once meant much to them
      were melting away, but they remained cheerful and full of
      gusto, quite unaware of the change which was taking place
      beneath the surface of their own minds. Most of the
      intellectuals, however, in America as elsewhere, knew all
      too well that they were disillusioned. Few of them,
      unfortunately, had grown up with as low expectations for
      humanity as Mencken. You cannot fully enjoy a zoo if you
      have been led to think of it as the home of an enlightened
      citizenry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intellectuals believed in a greater degree of sex
      freedom--and many of them found it disappointing when they
      got it, either in person or vicariously through books and
      plays. They were discovering that the transmutation of love
      into what Krutch called a "carefully catalogued psychosis"
      had robbed the loveliest passages of life of their poetry
      and their meaning. "Emotions," as Krutch said, "cannot be
      dignified unless they are first respected," and love was
      becoming too easy and too biological to be an object of
      respect. Elmer Davis referred in one of his essays to the
      heroine of a post-war novel who "indulged in 259 amours, if
      I remember correctly, without getting the emotional wallop
      out of any of them, or out of all of them together, that
      the lady of Victorian literature would have derived from a
      single competently conducted seduction." This busy heroine
      had many a literary counterpart and doubtless some in real
      life; and if one thing became clear to them, it was that
      romance cannot be put into quantity production, that the
      moment love becomes casual, it becomes commonplace as well.
      Even their less promiscuous contemporaries felt something
      of the sense of futility which came when romantic love was
      marked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      As enemies of standardization and repression, the
      intellectuals believed in freedom--but freedom for what?
      Uncomfortable as it was to be harassed by prohibition
      agents and dictated to by chambers of commerce, it was
      hardly less comfortable in the long run to have their
      freedom and not know what to do with it. In all the
      nineteen-twenties there was no more dismal sight than that
      described by Richmond Barrett in an article in
      <i>Harper's</i> entitled "Babes in the Bois"--the sight of
      young Americans dashing to Paris to be free to do what
      Buffalo or Iowa City would not permit, and after being
      excessively rude to everybody they met and tasting a few
      short and tasteless love-affairs and soaking themselves in
      gin, finally passing out undecoratively under a table in
      the Café du Dôme. Mr. Barrett, to be sure, was portraying
      merely the lunatic fringe of the younger generation of
      intellectuals; but who during the nineteen-twenties did not
      recognize the type characterized in the title of one of
      Scott Fitzgerald's books as "All the Sad Young Men"? Wrote
      Walter Lippmann, "What most distinguishes the generation
      who have approached maturity since the débâcle of idealism
      at the end of the war is not their rebellion against the
      religion and the moral code of their parents, but their
      disillusionment with their own rebellion. It is common for
      young men and women to rebel, but that they should rebel
      sadly and without faith in their rebellion, and that they
      should distrust the new freedom no less than the old
      certainties--that is something of a novelty." It may be
      added that there were older and wiser heads than these who,
      in quite different ways, felt the unanswerability of the
      question, After freedom, what next?
    </p>
    <p>
      They believed also, these intellectuals, in scientific
      truth and the scientific method--and science not only took
      their God away from them entirely, or reduced Him to a
      principle of order in the universe or a figment of the mind
      conjured up to meet a psychological need, but also reduced
      man, as Krutch pointed out in <i>The Modern Temper,</i> to
      a creature for whose ideas of right and wrong there was no
      transcendental authority. No longer was it possible to say
      with any positiveness, This is right, or, This is wrong; an
      act which was considered right in Wisconsin might be
      (according to the ethnologists) considered wrong in Borneo,
      and even in Wisconsin its merits seemed to be a matter of
      highly fallible human opinion. The certainty had departed
      from life. And what was worse still, it had departed from
      science itself. In earlier days those who denied the divine
      order had still been able to rely on a secure order of
      nature, but now even this was wabbling. Einstein and the
      quantum theory introduced new uncertainties and new doubts.
      Nothing, then, was sure; the purpose of life was
      undiscoverable, the ends of life were less discoverable
      still; in all this fog there was no solid thing on which a
      man could lay hold and say, This is real; this will abide.

      Yet in all this uncertainty there was new promise for the
      intellectual life of the country. With the collapse of
      fixed values went a collapse of the old water-tight
      critical standards in the arts, opening the way for fresh
      and independent work to win recognition. Better still, the
      idea was gaining ground that this fresh and independent
      work might as well be genuinely native, that the time had
      come when the most powerful nation in the world might rid
      itself of its cultural subjection to Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still hard to persuade the <i>cognoscenti</i> that
      first-class painting or music might come out of America.
      Rejecting scornfully the pretty confections of the
      Academicians, art collectors went in so wholeheartedly for
      the work of the French moderns and their imitators that the
      United States became almost--from the artistic point of
      view--a French colony. American orchestras remained under
      the domination of foreign conductors, played foreign
      compositions almost exclusively, and gave scant opportunity
      to the native composer. Even in art and music, however,
      there were signs of change. Artists were beginning to open
      their eyes to the pictorial possibilities of the skyscraper
      and the machine, and collectors waited only for George
      Bellows to die to bid up his rugged oils and lithographs of
      the American prize-ring. Music-lovers recognized at last
      the glory of the Negro spirituals, dabbled with the idea
      that George Gershwin might bridge the gap between popular
      jazz and vital music, permitted singers with such
      un-European names as Marion Talley and Lawrence Tibbett to
      become stars at the Metropolitan, and listened approvingly
      to an American opera (without, to be sure, an American
      subject) composed by Deems Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In architecture there was a somewhat more eager welcome for
      the indigenous product. Though the usual American country
      house was still a Georgian manor-house or a French
      farmhouse or a Spanish villa fitted out with bathrooms and
      a two-car garage, but trying to recapture, even in Lake
      Forest, what the real-estate agents called "Old World
      charm"; though the American bank was still a classical
      temple and there were still architects who tried to force
      the life of a modern American university into a medieval
      Gothic frame; nevertheless there was an increasing
      agreement with Lewis Mumford that new materials and new
      uses for them called for new treatment without benefit of
      the Beaux Arts. The <i>Chicago Tribune's</i> competition
      early in the decade, and particularly the startling design
      by Saarinen which won second prize, suggested new
      possibilities for the skyscraper--possibilities at which
      Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright and Cass Gilbert's
      Woolworth Building had already hinted. The skyscraper was
      peculiarly American--why not solve this problem of steel
      construction in a novel and American way? Gradually an
      American architecture began to evolve. Goodhue's Public
      Library in Los Angeles, his Nebraska State Capitol, Arthur
      Loomis Harmon's Shelton Hotel in New York, the
      Barclay-Vesey Telephone Building (by McKenzie, Voorhees
      &amp; Gmelin and Ralph Thomas Loamas), and other fine
      achievements at least paved the way for something which
      might be the logical and beautiful expression of an
      American need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in literature the foreign yoke was almost
      completely thrown off. Even if the intellectuals bought
      more foreign books than ever before and migrated by the
      thousands to Montparnasse and Antibes, they expected to
      write and to appreciate American literature. Their writing
      and their appreciation were both stimulated by Mencken's
      strenuous praise of uncompromisingly native work, by the
      establishment of good critical journals (such as the
      <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i>), and by researches
      into the American background which disclosed such native
      literary material as the Paul Bunyan legends and the cowboy
      ballads and such potential material as the desperadoes of
      the frontier and the show-boats of the rivers. There was a
      new ferment working, and at last there was an audience
      quite unconvinced that American literature must be forever
      inferior or imitative. Certainly a decade which produced
      Sinclair Lewis's <i>Arrowsmith,</i> Dreiser's <i>An
      American Tragedy,</i> Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to
      Arms,</i> Willa Cather's novels, Benet's <i>John Brown's
      Body,</i> some of the plays of Eugene O'Neill, and such
      short stories as Ring Lardner's "Golden Honeymoon"--to make
      invidious mention of only a few performances--could lay
      claim to something better than mere promise for the future.

      Gradually the offensive against Babbittry spent itself, if
      only because the novelty of rebellion wore off. The
      circulation of the <i>Mercury</i> (and with it, perhaps,
      the influence of its editor) reached its peak in 1927 and
      thereafter slowly declined. The <i>New Yorker</i> forgot
      the old lady from Dubuque and developed a casual and
      altogether charming humor with malice toward none; the
      other magazines consumed by the urban intelligentsia tired
      somewhat of viewing the American scene with alarm. Sex
      fiction began to seem a little less adventurous and the
      debunking fad ran its course. And similarly there began to
      be signs, here and there, that the mental depression of the
      intellectuals might have seen its worst days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1929--the very year which produced Krutch's <i>The
      Modern Temper,</i> a dismally complete statement of the
      philosophical disillusionment of the times--Walter Lippmann
      tried to lay the foundations for a new system of belief and
      of ethics which might satisfy even the disillusioned. The
      success of <i>A Preface to Morals</i> suggested that many
      people were tired of tobogganing into mental chaos. That
      same year there was a great hue and cry among the highbrows
      over humanism. The humanist fad was not without its comic
      aspect, since very few of those who diligently talked about
      it were clear as to which of three or four varieties of
      humanism they had in mind, and such cloistered beings as
      Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt were hardly the leaders
      to rally a popular movement of any dimensions; but it gave
      further evidence of a disposition among the doubters to dig
      in and face confusion along a new line of defense. There
      was also a widespread effort to find in the scientific
      philosophizing of Whitehead and Eddington and Jeans some
      basis for a belief that life might be worth living, after
      all. Perhaps the values which had been swept away during
      the post-war years had departed never to return, but at
      least there was a groping for new ones to take their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was, it came none too soon. For to many men and
      women the new day so sonorously heralded by the optimists
      and propagandists of war-time had turned into night before
      it ever arrived, and in the uncertain blackness they did
      not know which way to turn. They could revolt against
      stupidity and mediocrity, they could derive a meager
      pleasure from regarding themselves with pity as members of
      a lost generation, but they could not find peace.

      If in the year 1919--when the Peace Treaty still hung in
      the balance, and Woodrow Wilson was chanting the praises of
      the League, and the Bolshevist bogey stalked across the
      land, and fathers and mothers were only beginning to worry
      about the younger generation--you had informed the average
      American citizen that prohibition was destined to furnish
      the most violently explosive public issue of the
      nineteen-twenties, he would probably have told you that you
      were crazy. If you had been able to sketch for him a
      picture of conditions as they were actually to
      be--rum-ships rolling in the sea outside the twelve-mile
      limit and transferring their cargoes of whisky by night to
      fast cabin cruisers, beer-running trucks being hijacked on
      the interurban boulevards by bandits with Thompson
      sub-machine guns, illicit stills turning out alcohol by the
      carload, the fashionable dinner party beginning with
      contraband cocktails as a matter of course, ladies and
      gentlemen undergoing scrutiny from behind the curtained
      grill of the speakeasy, and Alphonse Capone,
      multi-millionaire master of the Chicago bootleggers,
      driving through the streets in an armor-plated car with
      bullet-proof windows--the innocent citizen's jaw would have
      dropped. The Eighteenth Amendment had been ratified, to go
      into effect on January 16, 1920; and the Eighteenth
      Amendment, he had been assured and he firmly believed, had
      settled the prohibition issue. You might like it or not,
      but the country was going dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in recent American history is more extraordinary,
      as one looks back from the nineteen-thirties, than the ease
      with which--after generations of uphill fighting by the
      drys--prohibition was finally written upon the
      statute-books. The country accepted it not only willingly,
      but almost absent-mindedly. When the Eighteenth Amendment
      came before the Senate in 1917, it was passed by a
      one-sided vote after only thirteen hours of debate, part of
      which was conducted under the ten-minute rule. When the
      House of Representatives accepted it a few months later,
      the debate upon the Amendment as a whole occupied only a
      single day. The state legislatures ratified it in short
      order; by January, 1919, some two months after the
      Armistice, the necessary three-quarters of the states had
      fallen into line and the Amendment was a part of the
      Constitution. (All the rest of the states but two
      subsequently added their ratifications--only Connecticut
      and Rhode Island remained outside the pale.) The Volstead
      Act for the enforcement of the Amendment, drafted after a
      pattern laid down by the Anti-Saloon League, slipped
      through with even greater ease and dispatch. Woodrow Wilson
      momentarily surprised the country by vetoing it, but it was
      promptly repassed over his veto. There were scattered
      protests--a mass-meeting in New York, a parade in
      Baltimore, a resolution passed by the American Federation
      of Labor demanding modification in order that the workman
      might not be deprived of his beer, a noisy demonstration
      before the Capitol in Washington--but so half-hearted and
      ineffective were the forces of the opposition and so
      completely did the country as a whole take for granted the
      inevitability of a dry régime, that few of the arguments in
      the press or about the dinner table raised the question
      whether the law would or would not prove enforceable; the
      burning question was what a really dry country would be
      like, what effect enforced national sobriety would have
      upon industry, the social order, and the next generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did it happen? Why this overwhelming, this almost
      casual acceptance of a measure of such huge importance?
    </p>
    <p>
      As Charles Merz has clearly shown in his excellent history
      of the first ten years of the prohibition experiment, the
      forces behind the Amendment were closely organized; the
      forces opposed to the Amendment were hardly organized at
      all. Until the United States entered the war, the prospect
      of national prohibition had seemed remote, and it is always
      hard to mobilize an unimaginative public against a vague
      threat. Furthermore, the wet leadership was discredited;
      for it was furnished by the dispensers of liquor, whose
      reputation had been unsavory and who had obstinately
      refused to clean house even in the face of a growing
      agitation for temperance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the United States into the war gave the dry
      leaders their great opportunity. The war diverted the
      attention of those who might have objected to the bone-dry
      program: with the very existence of the nation at stake,
      the future status of alcohol seemed a trifling matter. The
      war accustomed the country to drastic legislation
      conferring new and wide powers upon the Federal Government.
      It necessitated the saving of food and thus commended
      prohibition to the patriotic as a grain-saving measure. It
      turned public opinion against everything German--and many
      of the big brewers and distillers were of German origin.
      The war also brought with it a mood of Spartan idealism of
      which the Eighteenth Amendment was a natural expression.
      Everything was sacrificed to efficiency, production, and
      health. If a sober soldier was a good soldier and a sober
      factory hand was a productive factory hand, the argument
      for prohibition was for the moment unanswerable. Meanwhile
      the American people were seeing Utopian visions; if it
      seemed possible to them that the war should end all wars
      and that victory should bring a new and shining world
      order, how much easier to imagine that America might enter
      an endless era of efficient sobriety! And finally, the war
      made them impatient for immediate results. In 1917 and
      1918, whatever was worth doing at all was worth doing at
      once, regardless of red tape, counter-arguments, comfort,
      or convenience. The combination of these various forces was
      irresistible. Fervently and with headlong haste the nation
      took the shortcut to a dry Utopia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost nobody, even after the war had ended, seemed to have
      any idea that the Amendment would be really difficult to
      enforce. Certainly the first Prohibition Commissioner, John
      F. Kramer, displayed no doubts. "This law," he declared in
      a burst of somewhat Scriptural rhetoric, "will be obeyed in
      cities, large and small, and in villages, and where it is
      not obeyed it will be enforced. . . . The law says that
      liquor to be used as a beverage must not be manufactured.
      We shall see that it is not manufactured. Nor sold, nor
      given away, nor hauled in anything on the surface of the
      earth or under the earth or in the air." The Anti-Saloon
      League estimated that an appropriation by Congress of five
      million dollars a year would be ample to secure compliance
      with the law (including, presumably, the prevention of
      liquor-hauling "under the earth"). Congress voted not much
      more than that, heaved a long sigh of relief at having
      finally disposed of an inconvenient and vexatious issue,
      and turned to other matters of more pressing importance.
      The morning of January 16, 1920, arrived and the era of
      promised aridity began. Only gradually did the dry leaders,
      or Congress, or the public at large begin to perceive that
      the problem with which they had so light-heartedly grappled
      was a problem of gigantic proportions.

    <h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously the surest method of enforcement was to shut off
      the supply of liquor at its source. But consider what this
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coast lines and land borders of the United States
      offered an 18,700-mile invitation to smugglers. Thousands
      of druggists were permitted to sell alcohol on doctors'
      prescriptions, and this sale could not be controlled
      without close and constant inspection. Near-beer was still
      within the law, and the only way to manufacture near-beer
      was to brew real beer and then remove the alcohol from
      it--and it was excessively easy to fail to remove it from
      the entire product. The manufacture of industrial alcohol
      opened up inviting opportunities for diversion which could
      be prevented only by watchful and intelligent
      inspection--and after the alcohol left the plant where it
      was produced, there was no possible way of following it
      down the line from purchaser to purchaser and making sure
      that the ingredients which had been thoughtfully added at
      the behest of the Government to make it undrinkable were
      not extracted by ingenious chemists. Illicit distilling
      could be undertaken almost anywhere, even in the
      householder's own cellar; a commercial still could be set
      up for five hundred dollars which would produce fifty or a
      hundred highly remunerative gallons a day, and a one-gallon
      portable still could be bought for only six or seven
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet all these potential threats against the Volstead
      Act, the Government appropriations provided a force of
      prohibition agents which in 1920 numbered only 1,520 men
      and as late as 1930 numbered only 2,836; even with the
      sometimes unenthusiastic aid of the Coast Guard and the
      Customs Service and the Immigration Service, the force was
      meager. Mr. Merz puts it graphically: if the whole army of
      agents in 1920 had been mustered along the coasts and
      borders--paying no attention for the moment to medicinal
      alcohol, breweries, industrial alcohol, or illicit
      stills--there would have been one man to patrol every
      twelve miles of beach, harbor, headland, forest, and
      river-front. The agents' salaries in 1920 mostly ranged
      between $1,200 and $2,000; by 1930 they had been
      munificently raised to range between $2,300 and $2,800.
      Anybody who believed that men employable at thirty-five or
      forty or fifty dollars a week would surely have the expert
      technical knowledge and the diligence to supervise
      successfully the complicated chemical operations of
      industrial-alcohol plants or to outwit the craftiest
      devices of smugglers and bootleggers, and that they would
      surely have the force of character to resist corruption by
      men whose pockets were bulging with money, would be ready
      to believe also in Santa Claus, perpetual motion, and
      pixies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even this body of prohibition agents, small and
      underpaid as it was in view of the size and complexity of
      its task and the terrific pressure of temptation, might
      conceivably have choked off the supply of alcohol if it had
      had the concerted backing of public opinion. But public
      opinion was changing. The war was over; by 1920 normalcy
      was on the way. The dry cause confronted the same emotional
      let-down which defeated Woodrow Wilson and hastened the
      Revolution in Manners and Morals. Spartan idealism was
      collapsing. People were tired of girding up their loins to
      serve noble causes. They were tired of making the United
      States a land fit for heroes to live in. They wanted to
      relax and be themselves. The change of feeling toward
      prohibition was bewilderingly rapid. Within a few short
      months it was apparent that the Volstead Act was being
      smashed right and left and that the formerly inconsiderable
      body of wet opinion was growing to sizable proportions. The
      law was on the statute-books, the Prohibition Bureau was
      busily plying its broom against the tide of alcohol, and
      the corner saloon had become a memory; but the liquorless
      millennium had nevertheless been indefinitely postponed.

      The events of the next few years present one of those
      paradoxes which fascinate the observer of democratic
      government. Obviously there were large sections of the
      country in which prohibition was not prohibiting. A
      rational observer would have supposed that the obvious way
      out of this situation would be either to double or treble
      or quadruple the enforcement squad or to change the law.
      But nothing of the sort was done. The dry leaders, being
      unwilling to admit that the task of mopping up the United
      States was bigger than they had expected, did not storm the
      Capitol to recommend huge increases in the appropriations
      for enforcement; it was easier to denounce the opponents of
      the law as Bolshevists and destroyers of civilization and
      to hope that the tide of opinion would turn again. Congress
      was equally unwilling to face the music; there was a
      comfortable dry majority in both Houses, but it was one
      thing to be a dry and quite another to insist on
      enforcement at whatever cost and whatever inconvenience to
      some of one's influential constituents. The Executive was
      as wary of the prohibition issue as of a large stick of
      dynamite; the contribution of Presidents Harding and
      Coolidge to the problem--aside from negotiating treaties
      which increased the three-mile limit to twelve miles, and
      trying to improve the efficiency of enforcement without
      calling for too much money from Congress--consisted chiefly
      of uttering resounding platitudes on the virtues of law
      observance. The state governments were supposed to help the
      Prohibition Bureau, but by 1927 their financial
      contribution to the cause was about one-eighth of the sum
      they spent enforcing their own fish and game laws. Some
      legislatures withdrew their aid entirely, and even the
      driest states were inclined to let Uncle Sam bear the brunt
      of the Volstead job. Local governments were supposed to war
      against the speakeasy, but did it with scant relish except
      where local opinion was insistent. Nor could the wets, for
      their part, agree upon any practical program. It seemed
      almost hopeless to try to repeal or modify the Amendment,
      and for the time being they contented themselves chiefly
      with loud and indignant lamentation. The law was not
      working as it had been intended to, but nobody seemed
      willing or able to do anything positive about it one way or
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rum-ships plied from Bimini or Belize or St. Pierre,
      entering American ports under innocent disguises or
      transferring their cargoes to fast motor-boats which could
      land in any protected cove. Launches sped across the river
      at Detroit with good Canadian whisky aboard. Freighters
      brought in cases of contraband gin mixed among cases of
      other perfectly legal and properly labeled commodities.
      Liquor was hidden in freight-cars crossing the Canadian
      border; whole carfuls of whisky were sometimes smuggled in
      by judicious manipulation of seals. These diverse forms of
      smuggling were conducted with such success that in 1925
      General Lincoln C. Andrews, Assistant Secretary of the
      Treasury in charge of enforcement, hazarded the statement
      that his agents succeeded in intercepting only about 5 per
      cent of the liquor smuggled into the country; and the value
      of the liquor which filtered in during the single year 1924
      was estimated by the Department of Commerce at $40,000,000!
      Beer leaked profusely from the breweries; alley breweries
      unknown to the dry agents flourished and coined money. The
      amount of industrial alcohol illegally diverted was
      variously estimated in the middle years of the decade at
      from thirteen to fifteen million gallons a year; and even
      in 1930, after the Government had improved its technique of
      dealing with this particular source of supply (by careful
      control of the permit system and otherwise), the Director
      of Prohibition admitted that the annual diversion still
      amounted to nine million gallons, and other estimates ran
      as high as fifteen million. (Bear in mind that one gallon
      of diverted alcohol, watered down and flavored, was enough
      to furnish three gallons of bogus liquor, bottled with
      lovely Scotch labels and described by the bootlegger at the
      leading citizen's door as "just off the boat.")
    </p>
    <p>
      As for illicit distilling, as time went on this proved the
      most copious of all sources of supply. At the end of the
      decade it furnished, on the testimony of Doctor Doran of
      the prohibition staff, perhaps seven or eight times as much
      alcohol as even the process of diversion. If anything was
      needed to suggest how ubiquitous was the illicit still in
      America, the figures for the production of corn sugar
      provided it. Between 1919 and 1929 the output of this
      commodity increased <i>sixfold,</i> despite the fact that,
      as the Wickersham Report put it, the legitimate uses of
      corn sugar "are few and not easy to ascertain." Undoubtedly
      corn whisky was chiefly responsible for the vast increase.

      This overwhelming flood of outlaw liquor introduced into
      the American scene a series of picturesque if unedifying
      phenomena: hip flasks uptilted above faces both masculine
      and feminine at the big football games; the speakeasy,
      equipped with a regular old-fashioned bar, serving
      cocktails made of gin turned out, perhaps, by a gang of
      Sicilian alky-cookers (seventy-five cents for patrons, free
      to the police); well-born damsels with one foot on the
      brass rail, tossing off Martinis; the keg of grape juice
      simmering hopefully in the young couple's bedroom closet,
      subject to periodical inspection by a young man sent from a
      "service station"; the business executive departing for the
      trade convention with two bottles of gin in his bag; the
      sales manager serving lavish drinks to the visiting buyer
      as in former days he had handed out lavish boxes of cigars;
      the hotel bellhop running to Room 417 with another order of
      ginger ale and cracked ice, provided by the management on
      the ironical understanding that they were "not to be mixed
      with spirituous liquors"; federal attorneys padlocking
      nightclubs and speakeasies, only to find them opening
      shortly at another address under a different name; Izzy
      Einstein and Moe Smith, prohibition agents extraordinary,
      putting on a series of comic-opera disguises to effect
      miraculous captures of bootleggers; General Smedley Butler
      of the Marines advancing in military formation upon the
      rum-sellers of Philadelphia, and retiring in disorder after
      a few strenuous months with the admission that politics
      made it impossible to dry up the city; the Government
      putting wood alcohol and other poisons into industrial
      alcohol to prevent its diversion, and the wets thereupon
      charging the Government with murder; Government agents,
      infuriated by their failure to prevent liquor-running by
      polite methods, finally shooting to kill--and sometimes
      picking off an innocent by-stander; the good ship <i>I'm
      Alone,</i> of Canadian registry, being pursued by a revenue
      boat for two and a half days and sunk at a distance of 215
      miles from the American coast, to the official dismay of
      the Canadian Government; the federal courts jammed with
      prohibition cases, jurymen in wet districts refusing to
      pronounce bootleggers guilty, and the coin of corruption
      sifting through the hands of all manner of public servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the contribution of the prohibition régime to
      temperance, at least it produced intemperate propaganda and
      counter-propaganda. Almost any dry could tell you that
      prohibition was the basis of American prosperity, as
      attested by the mounting volume of savings-banks deposits
      and by what some big manufacturer had said about the men
      returning to work on Monday morning with clear eyes and
      steady hands. Or that prohibition had reduced the deaths
      from alcoholism, emptied the jails, and diverted the
      workman's dollar to the purchase of automobiles, radios,
      and homes. Almost any wet could tell you that prohibition
      had nothing to do with prosperity but had caused the crime
      wave, the increase of immorality and of the divorce rate,
      and a disrespect for all law which imperiled the very
      foundations of free government. The wets said the drys
      fostered Bolshevism by their fanatical zeal for laws which
      were inevitably flouted; the drys said the wets fostered
      Bolshevism by their cynical lawbreaking. Even in matters of
      supposed fact you could find, if you only read and
      listened, any sort of ammunition that you wanted. One never
      saw drunkards on the streets any more; one saw more
      drunkards than ever. Drinking in the colleges was hardly a
      problem now; drinking in the colleges was at its worst.
      There was a still in every other home in the mining
      districts of Pennsylvania; drinking in the mining districts
      of Pennsylvania was a thing of the past. Cases of poverty
      as a result of drunkenness were only a fraction of what
      they used to be; the menace of drink in the slums was three
      times as great as in pre-Volstead days. Bishop A and Doctor
      B and Governor C were much encouraged by the situation;
      Bishop X and Doctor Y and Governor Z were appalled by it.
      And so the battle raged, endlessly and loudly, back and
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mass of statistics dragged to light by professional
      drys and professional wets and hurled at the public need
      not detain us here. Many of them were grossly unreliable,
      and the use of most of them would have furnished an
      instructor in logic with perfect specimens of the <i>post
      hoc</i> fallacy. It is perhaps enough to point out a single
      anomaly--that with the Eighteenth Amendment and the
      Volstead Act in force, there should actually have been
      constant and vociferous argument throughout the
      nineteen-twenties over the question whether there was more
      drinking or less in the United States than before the war.
      Presumably there was a good deal less except among the
      prosperous; but the fact that it was not transparently
      obvious that there was less, showed how signal was the
      failure of the law to accomplish what almost everyone in
      1919 had supposed it would accomplish.

      By 1928 the argument over prohibition had reached such
      intensity that it could no longer be kept out of
      presidential politics. Governor Smith of New York was
      accepted as the Democratic nominee despite his unterrified
      wetness, and campaigned lustily for two modifications:
      first, an amendment to the Volstead law giving a
      "scientific definition of the alcoholic content of an
      intoxicating beverage" (a rather large order for science),
      each state being allowed to fix its own standard if this
      did not exceed the standard fixed by Congress; and second,
      "an amendment in the Eighteenth Amendment which would give
      to each individual state itself, only after approval by a
      referendum popular vote of its people, the right wholly
      within its borders to import, manufacture, or cause to be
      manufactured and sell alcoholic beverages, the sale to be
      made only by the state itself and not for consumption in
      any public place." The Republican candidate, in reply,
      stepped somewhat definitely off the fence on the dry side.
      Herbert Hoover's dry declaration, to be sure, left much
      unsaid; he called prohibition "a great social and economic
      experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose,"
      but he did not claim nobility for its results. The
      omission, however, was hardly noticed by an electorate
      which regarded endorsement of motives as virtually
      equivalent to endorsement of performance. Hoover was
      considered a dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republican candidate was elected in a landslide, and
      the drys took cheer. Despite the somewhat equivocal results
      of various state referenda and straw ballots, they had
      always claimed that they had a substantial majority in the
      country as well as in Congress; now they were sure of it.
      Still the result of the election left room for haunting
      doubts. Who could tell whether the happy warrior from the
      East Side had been defeated because he was a wet, or
      because he was a Roman Catholic, or because he was
      considered a threat to the indefinite continuance of the
      delights of Coolidge Prosperity, or because he was a
      Democrat?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Herbert Hoover had done more than endorse the motives
      of the prohibitionists. He had promised a study of the
      enforcement problem by a governmental commission. Two and a
      half months after his arrival at the White House, the
      commission, consisting of eleven members under the
      chairmanship of George W. Wickersham of New York, was
      appointed and immersed itself in its prodigious task.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the Wickersham Commission emerged from the sea
      of fact and theory and contention in which it had been
      delving, and handed its report to the President, the
      Post-war Decade was dead and done with. Not until January,
      1931, nineteen months after his appointment, did Mr.
      Wickersham lay the bulky findings of the eleven
      investigators upon the presidential desk. Yet the report
      calls for mention here, if only because it represented the
      findings of a group of intelligent and presumably impartial
      people with regard to one of the critical problems of the
      nineteen-twenties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a paradoxical document. In the first place, the
      complete text revealed very clearly the sorry inability of
      the enforcement staff to dry up the country. In the second
      place, each of the eleven commissioners submitted a
      personal report giving his individual views, and only five
      of the eleven--a minority--favored further trial for the
      prohibition experiment without substantial change; four of
      them favored modification of the Amendment, and two were
      for outright repeal. But the commission <i>as a whole</i>
      cast its vote for further trial, contenting itself with
      suggesting a method of modification if time proved that the
      experiment was a failure. The confusing effect of the
      report was neatly satirized in Flaccus's summary of it in
      F. P. A.'s column in the <i>New York World:</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Prohibition is an awful flop.<br>
                We like it.<br>
      It can't stop what it's meant to stop.<br>
                We like it.<br>
      It's left a trail of graft and slime,<br>
      It's filled our land with vice and crime,<br>
      It don't prohibit worth a dime,<br>
                Nevertheless we're for it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if the Wickersham report was confusing, this was highly
      appropriate; for so also was the situation with which it
      dealt. Although it seemed reasonably clear to an impartial
      observer that the country had chosen the wrong road in
      1917-20, legislating with a sublime disregard for
      elementary chemistry--which might have taught it how easily
      alcohol may be manufactured--and for elementary
      psychology--which might have suggested that common human
      impulses are not easily suppressed by fiat--it was
      nevertheless very far from clear how the country could best
      extricate itself from the morass into which it had so
      blithely plunged. How could people who had become
      gin-drinkers be expected to content themselves with light
      wines and beers, as some of the modificationists suggested?
      How could any less drastic system of governmental
      regulation or governmental sale of liquor operate without
      continued transgression and corruption, now that a large
      element had learned how to live with impunity on the fruits
      of lawbreaking? To what sinister occupations might not the
      bootlegging gentry turn if outright repeal took their
      accustomed means of livelihood away from them? How could
      any new national policy toward alcohol be successfully put
      into effect when there was still violent disagreement, even
      among those who wanted the law changed, as to whether
      alcohol should be regarded as a curse, as a blessing to be
      used in moderation, or as a matter of personal rather than
      public concern? Even if a clear majority of the American
      people were able to decide to their own satisfaction what
      was the best way out of the morass, what chance was there
      of putting through their program when thirteen dry states
      could block any change in the Amendment? No problem which
      had ever faced the United States had seemed more nearly
      insoluble.

      In 1920, when prohibition was very young, Johnny Torrio of
      Chicago had an inspiration. Torrio was a formidable figure
      in the Chicago underworld. He had discovered that there was
      big money in the newly outlawed liquor business. He was
      fired with the hope of getting control of the dispensation
      of booze to the whole city of Chicago. At the moment there
      was a great deal too much competition; but possibly a
      well-disciplined gang of men handy with their fists and
      their guns could take care of that, by intimidating rival
      bootleggers and persuading speakeasy proprietors that life
      might not be wholly comfortable for them unless they bought
      Torrio liquor. What Torrio needed was a lieutenant who
      could mobilize and lead his shock troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a graduate of the notorious Five Points gang in New
      York and a disciple of such genial fellows as Lefty Louie
      and Gyp the Blood (he himself had been questioned about the
      murder of Herman Rosenthal in the famous Becker case in
      1912), he naturally turned to his <i>alma mater</i> for his
      man. He picked for the job a bullet-headed
      twenty-three-year-old Neapolitan roughneck of the Five
      Points gang, and offered him a generous income and half the
      profits of the bootleg trade if he would come to Chicago
      and take care of the competition. The young hoodlum came,
      established himself at Torrio's gambling-place, the Four
      Deuces, opened by way of plausible stage setting an
      innocent-looking office which contained among its
      properties a family Bible, and had a set of business cards
      printed:

      Torrio had guessed right--in fact, he had guessed right
      three times. The profits of bootlegging in Chicago proved
      to be prodigious, allowing an ample margin for the
      mollification of the forces of the law. The competition
      proved to be exacting: every now and then Torrio would
      discover that his rivals had approached a speakeasy
      proprietor with the suggestion that he buy their beer
      instead of the Torrio-Capone brand, and on receipt of an
      unfavorable answer had beaten the proprietor senseless and
      smashed up his place of business. But Al Capone had been an
      excellent choice as leader of the Torrio offensives; Capone
      was learning how to deal with such emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within three years it was said that the boy from the Five
      Points had seven hundred men at his disposal, many of them
      adept in the use of the sawed-off shotgun and the Thompson
      sub-machine gun. As the profits from beer and
      "alky-cooking" (illicit distilling) rolled in, young Capone
      acquired more finesse--particularly finesse in the
      management of politics and politicians. By the middle of
      the decade he had gained complete control of the suburb of
      Cicero, had installed his own mayor in office, had posted
      his agents in the wide-open gambling-resorts and in each of
      the 161 bars, and had established his personal headquarters
      in the Hawthorne Hotel. He was taking in millions now.
      Torrio was fading into the background; Capone was becoming
      the Big Shot. But his conquest of power did not come
      without bloodshed. As the rival gangs--the O'Banions, the
      Gennas, the Aiellos--disputed his growing domination,
      Chicago was afflicted with such an epidemic of killings as
      no civilized modern city had ever before seen, and a new
      technique of wholesale murder was developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the standard methods of disposing of a rival in this
      warfare of the gangs was to pursue his car with a stolen
      automobile full of men armed with sawed-off shotguns and
      sub-machine guns; to draw up beside it, forcing it to the
      curb, open fire upon it--and then disappear into the
      traffic, later abandoning the stolen car at a safe
      distance. Another favorite method was to take the victim
      "for a ride": in other words, to lure him into a supposedly
      friendly car, shoot him at leisure, drive to some distant
      and deserted part of the city, and quietly throw his body
      overboard. Still another was to lease an apartment or a
      room overlooking his front door, station a couple of hired
      assassins at the window, and as the victim emerged from the
      house some sunny afternoon, to spray him with a few dozen
      machine-gun bullets from behind drawn curtains. But there
      were also more ingenious and refined methods of slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take, for example, the killing of Dion O'Banion, leader of
      the gang which for a time most seriously menaced Capone's
      reign in Chicago. The preparation of this particular murder
      was reminiscent of the kiss of Judas. O'Banion was a
      bootlegger and a gangster by night, but a florist by day: a
      strange and complex character, a connoisseur of orchids and
      of manslaughter. One morning a sedan drew up outside his
      flower shop and three men got out, leaving the fourth at
      the wheel. The three men had apparently taken good care to
      win O'Banion's trust, for although he always carried three
      guns, now for the moment he was off his guard as he
      advanced among the flowers to meet his visitors. The middle
      man of the three cordially shook hands with
      O'Banion--<i>and then held on</i> while his two companions
      put six bullets into the gangster-florist. The three
      conspirators walked out, climbed into the sedan, and
      departed. They were never brought to justice, and it is not
      recorded that any of them hung themselves to trees in
      remorse. O'Banion had a first-class funeral, gangster
      style: a ten-thousand-dollar casket, twenty-six truck-loads
      of flowers, and among them a basket of flowers which bore
      the touching inscription, "From Al."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1926 the O'Banions, still unrepentant despite the loss
      of their leader, introduced another novelty in gang
      warfare. In broad daylight, while the streets of Cicero
      were alive with traffic, they raked Al Capone's
      headquarters with machine-gun fire from eight touring cars.
      The cars proceeded down the crowded street outside the
      Hawthorne Hotel in solemn line, the first one firing blank
      cartridges to disperse the innocent citizenry and to draw
      the Capone forces to the doors and windows, while from the
      succeeding cars, which followed a block behind, flowed a
      steady rattle of bullets, spraying the hotel and the
      adjoining buildings up and down. One gunman even got out of
      his car, knelt carefully upon the sidewalk at the door of
      the Hawthorne, and played one hundred bullets into the
      lobby--back and forth, as one might play the hose upon
      one's garden. The casualties were miraculously light, and
      Scarface Al himself remained in safety, flat on the floor
      of the Hotel Hawthorne restaurant; nevertheless, the
      bombardment quite naturally attracted public attention.
      Even in a day when bullion was transported in armored cars,
      the transformation of a suburban street into a
      shooting-gallery seemed a little unorthodox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war continued, one gangster after another crumpling
      under a rain of bullets; not until St. Valentine's Day of
      1929 did it reach its climax in a massacre which outdid all
      that had preceded it in ingenuity and brutality. At
      half-past ten on the morning of February 14, 1929, seven of
      the O'Banions were sitting in the garage which went by the
      name of the S. M. C. Cartage Company, on North Clark
      Street, waiting for a promised consignment of hijacked
      liquor. A Cadillac touring-car slid to the curb, and three
      men dressed as policemen got out, followed by two others in
      civilian dress. The three supposed policemen entered the
      garage alone, disarmed the seven O'Banions, and told them
      to stand in a row against the wall. The victims readily
      submitted; they were used to police raids and thought
      nothing of them; they would get off easily enough, they
      expected. But thereupon the two men in civilian clothes
      emerged from the corridor and calmly mowed down all seven
      O'Banions with sub-machine gun fire as they stood with
      hands upraised against the wall. The little drama was
      completed when the three supposed policemen solemnly
      marched the two plain-clothes killers across the sidewalk
      to the waiting car, and all five got in and drove
      off--having given to those in the wintry street a perfect
      tableau of an arrest satisfactorily made by the forces of
      the law!
    </p>
    <p>
      These killings--together with that of "Jake" Lingle, who
      led a double life as reporter for the <i>Chicago
      Tribune</i> and as associate of gangsters, and who was shot
      to death in a crowded subway leading to the Illinois
      Central suburban railway station in 1930--were perhaps the
      most spectacular of the decade in Chicago. But there were
      over five hundred gang murders in all. Few of the murderers
      were apprehended; careful planning, money, influence, the
      intimidation of witnesses, and the refusal of any gangster
      to testify against any other, no matter how treacherous the
      murder, met that danger. The city of Chicago was giving the
      whole country, and indeed the whole world, an astonishing
      object lesson in violent and unpunished crime. How and why
      could such a thing happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that prohibition--or, if you prefer, the refusal of
      the public to abide by prohibition--caused the rise of the
      gangs to lawless power would be altogether too easy an
      explanation. There were other causes: the automobile, which
      made escape easy, as the officers of robbed banks had
      discovered; the adaptation to peace-time use of a new
      arsenal of handy and deadly weapons; the murderous
      traditions of the Mafia, imported by Sicilian gangsters;
      the inclination of a wet community to wink at the
      by-products of a trade which provided them with beer and
      gin; the sheer size and unwieldiness of the modern
      metropolitan community, which prevented the focusing of
      public opinion upon any depredation which did not
      immediately concern the average individual citizen; and, of
      course, the easy-going political apathy of the times. But
      the immediate occasion of the rise of gangs was undoubtedly
      prohibition--or, to be more precise, beer-running. (Beer
      rather than whisky on account of its bulk; to carry on a
      profitable trade in beer one must transport it in trucks,
      and trucks are so difficult to disguise that the traffic
      must be protected by bribery of the prohibition staff and
      the police and by gunfire against bandits.) There was vast
      profit in the manufacture, transportation, and sale of
      beer. In 1927, according to Fred D. Pasley, Al Capone's
      biographer, federal agents estimated that the Capone gang
      controlled the sources of a revenue from booze of something
      like sixty million dollars a year, and much of
      this--perhaps most of it--came from beer. Fill a man's
      pockets with money, give him a chance at a huge profit, put
      him into an illegal business and thus deny him recourse to
      the law if he is attacked, and you have made it easy for
      him to bribe and shoot. There have always been gangs and
      gangsters in American life and doubtless always will be;
      there has always been corruption of city officials and
      doubtless always will be; yet it is ironically true, none
      the less, that the outburst of corruption and crime in
      Chicago in the nineteen-twenties was immediately occasioned
      by the attempt to banish the temptations of liquor from the
      American home.

      The young thug from the Five Points, New York, had traveled
      fast and far since 1920. By the end of the decade he had
      become as widely renowned as Charles Evans Hughes or Gene
      Tunney. He had become an American portent. Not only did he
      largely control the sale of liquor to Chicago's ten
      thousand speakeasies; he controlled the sources of supply,
      it was said, as far as Canada and the Florida coast. He had
      amassed, and concealed, a fortune the extent of which
      nobody knew; it was said by federal agents to amount to
      twenty million. He was arrested and imprisoned once in
      Philadelphia for carrying a gun, but otherwise he seemed
      above the law. He rode about Chicago in an armored car, a
      traveling fortress, with another car to patrol the way
      ahead and a third car full of his armed henchmen following
      behind; he went to the theater attended by a body-guard of
      eighteen young men in dinner coats, with guns doubtless
      slung under their left armpits in approved gangster
      fashion; when his sister was married, thousands milled
      about the church in the snow, and he presented the bride
      with a nine-foot wedding cake and a special honeymoon car;
      he had a fine estate at Miami where he sometimes
      entertained seventy-five guests at a time; and high
      politicians--and even, it has been said, judges--took
      orders from him over the telephone from his headquarters in
      a downtown Chicago hotel. And still he was only thirty-two
      years old. What was Napoleon doing at thirty-two?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile gang rule and gang violence were quickly
      penetrating other American cities. Toledo had felt them,
      and Detroit, and New York, and many another. Chicago was
      not alone. Chicago had merely led the way.

      By the middle of the decade it was apparent that the gangs
      were expanding their enterprises. In Mr. Pasley's analysis
      of the gross income of the Capone crew in 1927, as
      estimated by federal agents, the item of $60,000,000 from
      beer and liquor, including alky-cooking, and the items of
      $25,000,000 from gambling-establishments and dog-tracks,
      and of $10,000,000 from vice, dance-halls, roadhouses, and
      other resorts, were followed by this entry: Rackets,
      $10,000,000. The bootlegging underworld was venturing into
      fresh fields and pastures new.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word "racket," in the general sense of an occupation
      which produces easy money, is of venerable age: it was
      employed over fifty years ago in Tammany circles in New
      York. But it was not widely used in its present meaning
      until the middle nineteen-twenties, and the derived term
      "racketeering" did not enter the American vocabulary until
      the year when Sacco and Vanzetti were executed and
      Lindbergh flew the Atlantic and Calvin Coolidge did not
      choose to run--the year 1927. The name was a product of the
      Post-war Decade; and so was the activity to which it was
      attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the murderous activities of the bootlegging gangs,
      racketeering grew out of a complex of causes. One of these
      was violent labor unionism. Since the days of the Molly
      Maguires, organized labor had now and again fought for its
      rights with brass knuckles and bombs. During the Big Red
      Scare the labor unions had lost the backing of public
      opinion, and Coolidge Prosperity was making things still
      more difficult for them by persuading thousands of their
      members that a union card was not the only ticket to good
      fortune. More than one fighting labor leader thereupon
      turned once more to dynamite in the effort to maintain his
      job and his power. Gone was the ardent radicalism of 1919,
      the hope of a new industrial order; the labor leader now
      found himself simply a man who hoped to get his when others
      were getting theirs, a man tempted to smash the scab's face
      or to blow the roof off the anti-union factory to show that
      he meant business and could deliver the goods. In many
      cases he turned for aid to the hired thug, the killer; he
      protected himself from the law by bribery or at least by
      political influence; he connived with businessmen who were
      ready to play his game for their own protection or for
      profit. These unholy alliances were now the more easily
      achieved because the illicit liquor trade was making the
      underworld rich and confident and quick on the trigger and
      was accustoming many politicians and businessmen to
      large-scale graft and conspiracy. Gangsters and other
      crafty fellows learned of the labor leader's tricks and
      went out to organize rackets on their own account. Thus by
      1927 the city which had nourished Al Capone was nourishing
      also a remarkable assortment of these curious enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them were labor unions perverted to criminal ends;
      some were merely conspiracies for extortion masquerading as
      labor unions; others were conspiracies masquerading as
      trade associations, or were combinations of these different
      forms. But the basic principle was fairly uniform: the
      racket was a scheme for collecting cash from businessmen to
      protect them from damage, and it prospered because the
      victim soon learned that if he did not pay, his shop would
      be bombed, or his trucks wrecked, or he himself might be
      shot in cold blood--and never a chance to appeal to the
      authorities for aid, because the authorities were
      frightened or fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the cleaners' and dyers' racket, which collected
      heavy dues from the proprietors of retail cleaning shops
      and from master cleaners, and for a time so completely
      controlled the industry in Chicago that it could raise the
      price which the ordinary citizen paid for having his suit
      cleaned from $1.25 to $1.75. A cleaner and dyer who defied
      this racket might have his place of business bombed, or his
      delivery truck drenched with gasoline and set on fire, or
      he might be disciplined in a more devilish way: explosive
      chemicals might be sewn into the seams of trousers sent to
      him to be cleaned. There was the garage racket, product of
      the master mind of David Ablin, alias "Cockeye" Mulligan:
      if a garage owner chose not to join in the Mid-West Garage
      Association, as this enterprise was formally entitled, his
      garage would be bombed, or his mechanics would be slugged,
      or thugs would enter at night and smash windshields or lay
      about among the sedans with sledge-hammers, or tires would
      be flattened by the expert use of an ice-pick. There was
      the window-washing racket; when Max Wilner, who had been a
      window-washing contractor in Cleveland, moved to Chicago
      and tried to do business there, and was told that he could
      not unless he bought out some contractor already
      established, and refused to do so, he was not merely
      slugged or cajoled with explosives--he was shot dead. The
      list of rackets and of crimes could be extended for pages;
      in 1929, according to the State Attorney's office, there
      were ninety-one rackets in Chicago, seventy-five of them in
      active operation, and the Employers' Association figured
      the total cost to the citizenry at $136,000,000 a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the favorite weapon of the bootlegging gangster was the
      machine gun, so the favorite weapon of the racketeer was
      the bomb. He could hire a bomber to do an ordinary routine
      job with a black-powder bomb for $100, but a risky job with
      a dynamite bomb might cost him all of $1,000. In the course
      of a little over fifteen months--from October 11, 1927, to
      January 15, 1929--no less than 157 bombs were set or
      exploded in the Chicago district, and according to Gordon
      L. Hostetter and Thomas Quinn Beesley, who made a careful
      compilation of these outrages in <i>It's a Racket,</i>
      there was no evidence that the perpetrators of <i>any of
      them</i> were brought to book.
    </p>
    <p>
      A merry industry, and reasonably safe, it seemed--for the
      racketeers. Indeed, before the end of the decade
      racketeering had made such strides in Chicago that
      businessmen were turning in desperation to Al Capone for
      protection; Capone's henchmen were quietly attending union
      meetings to make sure that all proceeded according to the
      Big Shot's desires, and it was said that there were few
      more powerful figures in the councils of organized labor
      than the lord of the bootleggers had come to be.
      Racketeering, like gang warfare, had invaded other American
      cities, too. New York had laughed at Chicago's lawlessness,
      had it? New York was acquiring a handsome crop of rackets
      of its own--a laundry racket, a slot-machine racket, a fish
      racket, a flour racket, an artichoke racket, and others too
      numerous to mention. In every large urban community the
      racketeer was now at least a potential menace. In the
      course of a few short years he had become a national
      institution.

      This outburst of unbuttoned rhetoric was written in the
      autumn of 1925, when the Scopes trial was receding into
      memory, Santa Barbara was steadying itself from the shock
      of earthquake, Red Grange was plunging to fame, the
      cornerstone of Bishop Manning's house of prayer for all
      people was about to be laid, Brigadier-General Smedley
      Butler was wishing he had never undertaken to mop up
      Philadelphia, <i>The Man Nobody Knows</i> was selling its
      ten thousands--and the Florida boom was at its height. The
      quotation is not, as you might imagine, from the collected
      lyrics of an enraptured schoolgirl, but from the conclusion
      of an article written for the <i>Miamian</i> by the
      vice-president of a bank. It faintly suggests what happened
      to the mental processes of supposedly hard-headed men and
      women when they were exposed to the most delirious fever of
      real-estate speculation which had attacked the United
      States in ninety years.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing languorous about the atmosphere of
      tropical Miami during that memorable summer and autumn of
      1925. The whole city had become one frenzied real-estate
      exchange. There were said to be 2,000 real-estate offices
      and 25,000 agents marketing house-lots or acreage. The
      shirt-sleeved crowds hurrying to and fro under the widely
      advertised Florida sun talked of binders and options and
      water-frontages and hundred-thousand-dollar profits; the
      city fathers had been forced to pass an ordinance
      forbidding the sale of property in the street, or even the
      showing of a map, to prevent inordinate traffic congestion.
      The warm air vibrated with the clatter of riveters, for the
      steel skeletons of skyscrapers were rising to give Miami a
      skyline appropriate to its metropolitan destiny.
      Motor-busses roared down Flagler Street, carrying
      "prospects" on free trips to watch dredges and
      steam-shovels converting the outlying mangrove swamps and
      the sandbars of the Bay of Biscayne into gorgeous Venetian
      cities for the American homemakers and pleasure-seekers of
      the future. The Dixie Highway was clogged with automobiles
      from every part of the country; a traveler caught in a
      traffic jam counted the license-plates of eighteen states
      among the sedans and flivvers waiting in line. Hotels were
      overcrowded. People were sleeping wherever they could lay
      their heads, in station waiting-rooms or in automobiles.
      The railroads had been forced to place an embargo on
      imperishable freight in order to avert the danger of
      famine; building materials were now being imported by water
      and the harbor bristled with shipping. Fresh vegetables
      were a rarity, the public utilities of the city were trying
      desperately to meet the suddenly multiplied demand for
      electricity and gas and telephone service, and there were
      recurrent shortages of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Miami grew! In 1920 its population had been only
      30,000. According to the state census of 1925 it had jumped
      to 75,000--and probably if one had counted the newcomers of
      the succeeding months and Miami's share of the visitors who
      swarmed down to Florida from the North in one of the
      mightiest popular migrations of all time, the figure would
      have been nearer 150,000. And this, one was told, was only
      a beginning. Had not S. Davies Warfield, president of the
      Seaboard Air Line Railway, been quoted as predicting for
      Miami a population of a million within the next ten years?
      Did not the Governor of Florida, the Honorable John W.
      Martin, assert that "marvelous as is the wonder-story of
      Florida's recent achievements, these are but heralds of the
      dawn"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was making money on land, prices were climbing to
      incredible heights, and those who came to scoff remained to
      speculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Miami alone booming. The whole strip of coast line
      from Palm Beach southward was being developed into an
      American Riviera; for sixty-odd miles it was being rapidly
      staked out into fifty-foot lots. The fever had spread to
      Tampa, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and other cities and towns
      on the West Coast. People were scrambling for lots along
      Lake Okeechobee, about Sanford, all through the state; even
      in Jacksonville, near its northern limit, the "Believers in
      Jacksonville" were planning a campaign which would bring
      their city its due in growth and riches.

    </p>
    <p>
      For this amazing boom, which had gradually been gathering
      headway for several years but had not become sensational
      until 1924, there were a number of causes. Let us list them
      categorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. First of all, of course, the climate--Florida's
      unanswerable argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The accessibility of the state to the populous cities of
      the Northeast--an advantage which Southern California could
      not well deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The automobile, which was rapidly making America into a
      nation of nomads; teaching all manner of men and women to
      explore their country, and enabling even the small farmer,
      the summer-boarding-house keeper, and the garage man to
      pack their families into flivvers and tour southward from
      auto-camp to auto-camp for a winter of sunny leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The abounding confidence engendered by Coolidge
      Prosperity, which persuaded the four-thousand-dollar-a-year
      salesman that in some magical way he too might tomorrow be
      able to buy a fine house and all the good things of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. A paradoxical, widespread, but only half-acknowledged
      revolt against the very urbanization and industrialization
      of the country, the very concentration upon work, the very
      routine and smoke and congestion and twentieth-century
      standardization of living upon which Coolidge Prosperity
      was based. These things might bring the American
      businessman money, but to spend it he longed to escape from
      them--into the free sunshine of the remembered countryside,
      into the easy-going life and beauty of the European past,
      into some never-never land which combined American sport
      and comfort with Latin glamour--a Venice equipped with
      bathtubs and electric iceboxes, a Seville provided with
      three eighteen-hole golf courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The example of Southern California, which had advertised
      its climate at the top of its lungs and had prospered by so
      doing: why, argued the Floridians, couldn't Florida do
      likewise?
    </p>
    <p>
      7. And finally, another result of Coolidge Prosperity: not
      only did John Jones expect that presently he might be able
      to afford a house at Boca Raton and a vacation-time of
      tarpon-fishing or polo, but he also was fed on stories of
      bold business enterprise and sudden wealth until he was
      ready to believe that the craziest real-estate development
      might be the gold-mine which would work this miracle for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crazy real-estate developments? But were they crazy? By
      1925 few of them looked so any longer. The men whose
      fantastic projects had seemed in 1923 to be evidences of
      megalomania were now coining millions: by the pragmatic
      test they were not madmen but--as the advertisements put
      it--inspired dreamers. Coral Gables, Hollywood-by-the-Sea,
      Miami Beach, Davis Islands--there they stood: mere patterns
      on a blue-print no longer, but actual cities of brick and
      concrete and stucco; unfinished, to be sure, but growing
      with amazing speed, while prospects stood in line to buy
      and every square foot within their limits leaped in price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long years before, a retired Congregational minister named
      Merrick had bought cheap land outside Miami, built a
      many-gabled house out of coral rock, and called it "Coral
      Gables." Now his son, George Edgar Merrick, had added to
      this parcel of land and was building what the
      advertisements called "America's Most Beautiful Suburb."
      The plan was enticing, for Merrick had had sense enough to
      insist upon a uniform type of architecture--what he called
      a "modified Mediterranean" style. By 1926 his development,
      which had incorporated itself as the City of Coral Gables,
      contained more than two thousand houses built or building,
      with "a bustling business center, schools, banks, hotels,
      apartment houses and club houses"; with shady streets,
      lagoons, and anchorages. Merrick advertised boldly and in
      original ways: at one time he engaged William Jennings
      Bryan to sit under a sun-umbrella on a raft in a lagoon and
      lecture (at a handsome price) to the crowds on the
      shore--not upon the Prince of Peace or the Cross of Gold,
      but upon the Florida climate. (Bryan's tribute to sunshine
      was followed with dancing by Gilda Gray.) Merrick also knew
      how to make a romantic virtue of necessity: having
      low-lying land to drain and build on, he dug canals and
      imported real gondolas and gondoliers from Venice. The
      Miami-Biltmore Hotel at Coral Gables rose to a height of
      twenty-six stories; the country club had two eighteen-hole
      golf courses, and Merrick was making further audacious
      plans for a great casino, a yacht club, and a University of
      Miami. "Ten years of hard work, a hundred millions of hard
      money, is what George Merrick plans to spend before he
      rests," wrote Rex Beach in a brochure on Coral Gables. "Who
      can envisage what ten years will bring to that wonderland
      of Ponce de Leon's? Not you nor I. Nor Mr. Merrick, with
      all his soaring vision." (Alas for soaring vision! Among
      the things which ten years were to bring was an
      advertisement in the <i>New York Times</i> reminding the
      holders of nine series of bonds of the City of Coral Gables
      that the city had been "in default of the payment of
      principal and interest of a greater part of the above bonds
      since July 1, 1930.")
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other miracle-workers besides Merrick. Miami
      Beach had been a mangrove swamp until Carl G. Fisher cut
      down the trees, buried their stumps under five feet of
      sand, fashioned lagoons and islands, built villas and
      hotels, and--so it was said--made nearly forty million
      dollars selling lots. Joseph W. Young built
      Hollywood-by-the-Sea on the same grand scale, and when the
      freight embargo cut off his supply of building materials,
      bought his own seagoing fleet to fetch them to his growing
      "city." Over on the West Coast, D. P. Davis bought two
      small islets in the bay at Tampa--"two small marshy clumps
      of mangrove, almost submerged at high tide"--and by
      dredging and piling sand, raised up an island on which he
      built paved streets, hotels, houses. On the first day when
      Davis offered his lots to the public he sold three million
      dollars' worth--though at that time it is said that not a
      single dredge had begun to scoop up sand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the public bought. By 1925 they were buying anything,
      anywhere, so long as it was in Florida. One had only to
      announce a new development, be it honest or fraudulent, be
      it on the Atlantic Ocean or deep in the wasteland of the
      interior, to set people scrambling for house lots.
      "Manhattan Estates" was advertised as being "not more than
      three-fourths of a mile from the prosperous and
      fast-growing city of Nettie"; there was no such city as
      Nettie, the name being that of an abandoned turpentine
      camp, yet people bought. Investigators of the claims made
      for "Melbourne Gardens" tried to find the place, found
      themselves driving along a trail "through prairie muck
      land, with a few trees and small clumps of palmetto," and
      were hopelessly mired in the mud three miles short of their
      destination. But still the public bought, here and
      elsewhere, blindly, trustingly--natives of Florida,
      visitors to Florida, and good citizens of Ohio and
      Massachusetts and Wisconsin who had never been near Florida
      but made out their checks for lots in what they were told
      was to be "another Coral Gables" or was "next to the right
      of way of the new railroad" or was to be a
      "twenty-million-dollar city." The stories of prodigious
      profits made in Florida land were sufficient bait. A lot in
      the business center of Miami Beach had sold for $800 in the
      early days of the development and had resold for $150,000
      in 1924. For a strip of land in Palm Beach a New York
      lawyer had been offered $240,000 some eight or ten years
      before the boom; in 1923 he finally accepted $800,000 for
      it; the next year the strip of land was broken up into
      building lots and disposed of at an aggregate price of
      $1,500,000; and in 1925 there were those who claimed that
      its value had risen to $4,000,000. A poor woman who had
      bought a piece of land near Miami in 1896 for $25 was able
      to sell it in 1925 for $150,000. Such tales were legion;
      every visitor to the Gold Coast could pick them up by the
      dozen; and many if not most of them were quite true--though
      the profits were largely on paper. No wonder the rush for
      Florida land justified the current anecdote of a native
      saying to a visitor, "Want to buy a lot?" and the visitor
      at once replying, "Sold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Speculation was easy--and quick. No long delays while
      titles were being investigated and deeds recorded; such
      tiresome formalities were postponed. The prevalent method
      of sale was thus described by Walter C. Hill of the Retail
      Credit Company of Atlanta in the Inspection Report issued
      by his concern: "Lots are bought from blueprints. They look
      better that way. . . . Around Miami, subdivisions, except
      the very large ones, are often sold out the first day of
      sale. Advertisements appear describing the location,
      extent, special features, and approximate price of the
      lots. Reservations are accepted. This requires a check for
      10 per cent of the price of the lot the buyer expects to
      select. On the first day of sale, at the promoter's office
      in town, the reservations are called out in order, and the
      buyer steps up and, from a beautifully drawn blueprint,
      with lots and dimensions and prices clearly shown, selects
      a lot or lots, gets a receipt in the form of a 'binder'
      describing it, and has the thrill of seeing 'Sold' stamped
      in the blue-lined square which represents his lot, a space
      usually fifty by a hundred feet of Florida soil or swamp.
      There are instances where these first-day sales have gone
      into several millions of dollars. And the prices! . . .
      Inside lots from $8,000 to $20,000. Water-front lots from
      $15,000 to $25,000. Seashore lots from $20,000 to $75,000.
      And these are not in Miami. They are miles out--ten miles
      out, fifteen miles out, and thirty miles out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The binder, of course, did not complete the transaction.
      But few people worried much about the further payments
      which were to come. Nine buyers out of ten bought their
      lots with only one idea, to resell, and hoped to pass along
      their binders to other people at a neat profit before even
      the first payment fell due at the end of thirty days. There
      was an immense traffic in binders--immense and profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steadily, during that feverish summer and autumn of 1925,
      the hatching of new plans for vast developments continued.
      A great many of them, apparently, were intended to be
      occupied by what the advertisers of Miami Beach called
      "America's wealthiest sportsmen, devotees of yachting and
      the other expensive sports," and the advertisers of Boca
      Raton called "the world of international wealth that
      dominates finance and industry . . . that sets fashions . .
      . the world of large affairs, smart society and leisured
      ease." Few of those in the land-rush seemed to question
      whether there would be enough devotees of yachting and men
      and women of leisured ease to go round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere vast new hotels, apartment houses, casinos were
      being projected. At the height of the fury of building a
      visitor to West Palm Beach noticed a large vacant lot
      almost completely covered with bathtubs. The tubs had
      apparently been there some time; the crates which
      surrounded them were well weathered. The lot, he was
      informed, was to be the site of "One of the most
      magnificent apartment buildings in the South"--but the
      freight embargo had held up the contractor's building
      material and only the bathtubs had arrived! Throughout
      Florida resounded the slogans and hyperboles of boundless
      confidence. The advertising columns shrieked with them,
      those swollen advertising columns which enabled the
      <i>Miami Daily News,</i> one day in the summer of 1925, to
      print an issue of 504 pages, the largest in newspaper
      history, and enabled the <i>Miami Herald</i> to carry a
      larger volume of advertising in 1925 than any paper
      anywhere had ever before carried in a year. Miami was not
      only "The Wonder City," it was also "The Fair White Goddess
      of Cities," "The World's Playground," and "The City
      Invincible," Fort Lauderdale became "The Tropical
      Wonderland," Orlando "The City Beautiful," and Sanford "The
      City Substantial."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily the turgid stream of rhetoric poured forth to the
      glory of Florida. It reached its climax, perhaps, in the
      joint Proclamation issued by the mayors of Miami, Miami
      Beach, Hialeah, and Coral Gables (who modestly referred to
      their county as "the most Richly Blessed Community of the
      most Bountifully Endowed State of the most Highly
      Enterprising People of the Universe"), setting forth the
      last day of 1925 and the first two days of 1926 as "The
      Fiesta of the American Tropics"--"our Season of Fiesta when
      Love, Good Fellowship, Merrymaking, and Wholesome Sport
      shall prevail throughout Our Domains." The mayors promised
      that there would be dancing: "that our Broad Boulevards,
      our Beautiful Plazas and Ballroom Floors, our Patios, Clubs
      and Hostelries shall be the scenes where Radiant
      Terpsichore and her Sparkling Devotees shall follow with
      Graceful Tread the Measure of the Dance." They promised
      much more, to the extent of a page of flatulent text
      sprinkled with capitals; but especially they promised "that
      through our Streets and Avenues shall wind a glorious
      Pageantry of Sublime Beauty Depicting in Floral Loveliness
      the Blessing Bestowed upon us by Friendly Sun, Gracious
      Rain, and Soothing Tropic Wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presumably the fiesta was successful, with its full quota
      of Sparkling Devotees and Sublime Beauty. But by New Year's
      Day of 1926 the suspicion was beginning to insinuate itself
      into the minds of the merrymakers that new buyers of land
      were no longer so plentiful as they had been in September
      and October, that a good many of those who held binders
      were exceedingly anxious to dispose of their stake in the
      most Richly Blessed Community, and that Friendly Sun and
      Gracious Rain were not going to be able, unassisted, to
      complete the payments on lots. The influx of winter
      visitors had not been quite up to expectations. Perhaps the
      boom was due for a "healthy breathing-time."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      [3]
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, it was due for a good deal more than
      that. It began obviously to collapse in the spring and
      summer of 1926. People who held binders and had failed to
      get rid of them were defaulting right and left on their
      payments. One man who had sold acreage early in 1925 for
      twelve dollars an acre, and had cursed himself for his
      stupidity when it was resold later in the year for
      seventeen dollars, and then thirty dollars, and finally
      sixty dollars an acre, was surprised a year or two
      afterward to find that the entire series of subsequent
      purchases was in default, that he could not recover the
      money still due him, and that his only redress was to take
      his land back again. There were cases in which the land not
      only came back to the original owner, but came back
      burdened with taxes and assessments which amounted to more
      than the cash he had received for it; and furthermore he
      found his land blighted with a half-completed development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as it began to be clear that a wholesale deflation was
      inevitable, two hurricanes showed what a Soothing Tropic
      Wind could do when it got a running start from the West
      Indies.
    </p>
    <p>
      No malevolent Providence bent upon the teaching of humility
      could have struck with a more precise aim than the second
      and worst of these Florida hurricanes. It concentrated upon
      the exact region where the boom had been noisiest and most
      hysterical--the region about Miami. Hitting the Gold Coast
      early in the morning of September 18, 1926, it piled the
      waters of Biscayne Bay into the lovely Venetian
      developments, deposited a five-masted steel schooner high
      in the street at Coral Gables, tossed big steam yachts upon
      the avenues of Miami, picked up trees, lumber, pipes,
      tiles, débris, and even small automobiles and sent them
      crashing into the houses, ripped the roofs off thousands of
      jerry-built cottages and villas, almost wiped out the town
      of Moore Haven on Lake Okeechobee, and left behind it some
      four hundred dead, sixty-three hundred injured, and fifty
      thousand homeless. Valiantly the Floridians insisted that
      the damage was not irreparable; so valiantly, in fact, that
      the head of the American Red Cross, John Barton Payne, was
      quoted as charging that the officials of the state had
      "practically destroyed" the national Red Cross campaign for
      relief of the homeless. Mayor Romfh of Miami declared that
      he saw no reason "why this city should not entertain her
      winter visitors the coming season as comfortably as in past
      seasons." But the Soothing Tropic Wind had had its revenge;
      it had destroyed the remnants of the Florida boom.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1927, according to Homer B. Vanderblue, most of the
      elaborate real-estate offices on Flagler Street in Miami
      were either closed or practically empty; the Davis Islands
      project, "bankrupt and unfinished," had been taken over by
      a syndicate organized by Stone &amp; Webster; and many
      Florida cities, including Miami, were having difficulty
      collecting their taxes. By 1928 Henry S. Villard, writing
      in <i>The Nation,</i> thus described the approach to Miami
      by road: "Dead subdivisions line the highway, their pompous
      names half-obliterated on crumbling stucco gates. Lonely
      white-way lights stand guard over miles of cement
      sidewalks, where grass and palmetto take the place of homes
      that were to be. . . . Whole sections of outlying
      subdivisions are composed of unoccupied houses, past which
      one speeds on broad thoroughfares as if traversing a city
      in the grip of death." In 1928 there were thirty-one bank
      failures in Florida; in 1929 there were fifty-seven; in
      both of these years the liabilities of the failed banks
      reached greater totals than were recorded for any other
      state in the Union. The Mediterranean fruitfly added to the
      gravity of the local economic situation in 1929 by ravaging
      the citrus crop. Bank clearings for Miami, which had
      climbed sensationally to over a billion dollars in 1925,
      marched sadly downhill again:

      And those were the very years when elsewhere in the country
      prosperity was triumphant! By the middle of 1930, after the
      general business depression had set in, no less than
      twenty-six Florida cities had gone into default of
      principal or interest on their bonds, the heaviest defaults
      being those of West Palm Beach, Miami, Sanford, and Lake
      Worth; and even Miami, which had a minor issue of bonds
      maturing in August, 1930, confessed its inability to redeem
      them and asked the bondholders for an extension.

    <p>
      The cheerful custom of incorporating real-estate
      developments as "cities" and financing the construction of
      all manner of improvements with "tax-free municipal bonds,"
      as well as the custom on the part of development
      corporations of issuing real-estate bonds secured by new
      structures located in the boom territory, were showing
      weaknesses unimagined by the inspired dreamers of 1925.
      Most of the millions piled up in paper profits had melted
      away, many of the millions sunk in developments had been
      sunk for good and all, the vast inverted pyramid of credit
      had toppled to earth, and the lesson of the economic
      falsity of a scheme of land values based upon grandiose
      plans, preposterous expectations, and hot air had been
      taught in a long agony of deflation. For comfort there were
      only a few saving facts to cling to. Florida still had her
      climate, her natural resources. The people of Florida still
      had energy and determination, and having recovered from
      their debauch of hope, were learning from the relentless
      discipline of events. Not all Northerners who had moved to
      Florida in the days of plenty had departed in the days of
      adversity. Far from it: the census of 1930, in fact, gave
      Florida an increase in population of over 50 per cent since
      1920--a larger increase than that of any other state except
      California--and showed that in the same interval Miami had
      grown by nearly 400 per cent. Florida still had a future;
      there was no doubt of that, sharp as the pains of enforced
      postponement were. Nor, for that matter, were the people of
      Florida alone blameworthy for the insanity of 1925. They,
      perhaps, had done most of the shouting, but the hysteria
      which had centered in their state had been a national
      hysteria, enormously increased by the influx of outlanders
      intent upon making easy money.

      The Florida boom, in fact, was only one--and by all odds
      the most spectacular--of a series of land and building
      booms during the Postwar Decade, each of which had its
      marked effect upon the national economy and the national
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very outset of the decade there had been a
      sensational market in farm lands, caused by the phenomenal
      prices brought by wheat and other crops during and
      immediately after the war. Prices of farm property leaped,
      thousands of mortgages and loans were based upon these
      exaggerated values, and when the bottom dropped out of the
      agricultural markets in 1920-21, the distress of the
      farmers was intensified by the fact that in innumerable
      cases they could not get money enough from their crops to
      cover the interest due at the bank or to pay the taxes
      which were now levied on the increased valuation. Thousands
      of country banks, saddled with mortgages and loans in
      default, ultimately went to the wall. In one of the great
      agricultural states, the average earnings of <i>all</i> the
      national and state banks during the years 1924-29, a time
      of great prosperity for the country at large, were less
      than 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent; and in seven
      states of the country, between 40 and 50 per cent of the
      banks which had been in business prior to 1920 had failed
      before 1929. Just how many of these failures were directly
      attributable to the undisciplined rise and subsequent fall
      in real-estate prices it is, of course, impossible to say;
      but undoubtedly many of the little country banks which
      suffered so acutely would never have gone down to ruin if
      there had been no boom in farm lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the decade, but especially during and
      immediately after the Florida fever, there was an epidemic
      of ambitious schemes hatched by promoters and boosters to
      bring prosperity to various American cities, towns, and
      resorts, by presenting each of them, in sumptuous
      advertisements, circulars, and press copy put out by
      hustling chambers of commerce, as the "center of a rising
      industrial empire" or as the "new playground of America's
      rich." Some of these ventures prospered; in California, for
      example, where the technique of boosting had been brought
      to poetic perfection long years previously, concerted
      campaigns brought industries, winter visitors, summer
      visitors, and good fortune for the businessman and the
      hotel-keeper alike. It was estimated that a million people
      a year went to California "just to look and play"--and, of
      course, to spend money. But not all such ventures could
      prosper, the number of factories and of wealthy
      vacationists being unhappily limited. City after city,
      hoping to attract industries within its limits, eloquently
      pointed out its "advantages" and tried to "make its
      personality felt" and to "carry its constructive message to
      the American people"; but at length it began to dawn upon
      the boosters that attracting industries bore some
      resemblance to robbing Peter to pay Paul, and that if all
      of them were converted to boosting, each of them was as
      likely to find itself in the role of Peter as in that of
      Paul. And exactly as the developers of the tropical
      wonderlands of Florida had learned that there were more
      land-speculators able and willing to gamble in houses
      intended for the polo-playing class than there were members
      of this class, so also those who carved out playgrounds for
      the rich in North Carolina or elsewhere learned to their
      ultimate sorrow that the rich could not play everywhere at
      once. And once more the downfall of their bright hopes had
      financial repercussions, as bankrupt developments led to
      the closing of bank after bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, all through the decade, but especially during its
      middle years, there was a boom in suburban lands outside
      virtually every American city. As four million discouraged
      Americans left the farms, and the percentage of
      city-dwellers in the United States increased from 51.4 to
      57.6, and the cities grew in size and in stridency, and
      urban traffic became more noisy and congested, and new high
      buildings cut off the city-dweller's light and air, the
      drift of families from the cities to the urban-rural
      compromise of the neighboring countryside became more
      rapid. Here again the automobile played its part in
      changing the conditions of American life, by bringing
      within easy range of the suburban railroad station, and
      thus of the big city, great stretches of woodland and field
      which a few years before had seemed remote and
      inaccessible. Attractive suburbs grew with amazing speed,
      blossoming out with brand-new Colonial farmhouses (with
      attached garage), Tudor cottages (with age-old sagging
      roofs constructed by inserting wedge-shaped blocks of wood
      at the ends of the roof-trees), and Spanish stucco
      haciendas (with built-in radios). Once more the real-estate
      developer had his golden opportunity. The old Jackson farm
      with its orchards and daisy-fields was staked out in lots
      and attacked by the steam-shovel and became Jacobean
      Heights or Colonial Terrace or Alhambra Gardens, with paved
      roads, twentieth-century comforts, Old World charm, and
      land for sale on easy payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the immediate outskirts of great cities such as New
      York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Detroit huge tracts were
      less luxuriously developed. The Borough of Queens, just
      across the East River from New York, grew vastly and
      hideously: its population more than doubled during the
      decade, reaching a total of over a million. Outside Detroit
      immense districts were subdivided and numerous lots in them
      were bought by people so poor that they secured permits to
      build "garage dwellings"--temporary one-room shacks--and
      lived in them for years without ever building real houses.
      So furious was the competition among developers that it was
      estimated that in a single year there were subdivided in
      the Chicago region enough lots to accommodate the growth of
      the city for twenty years to come (at the rate at which it
      had previously grown), and that by the end of the decade
      enough lots had been staked out between Patchogue, Long
      Island, and the New York City limits to house the entire
      metropolitan population of six million.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the Florida boom had a picturesque influence on
      suburban developments. Many of them went Venetian. There
      was, for example, American Venice, thirty-four miles from
      New York on Long Island, where the first bridge to be built
      was "a replica of the famous Della Paglia Bridge at
      Venice," and the whole scene, according to the promoters,
      "recalls the famous city of the Doges, only more
      charming--and more homelike." "To live at American Venice,"
      chanted one of the advertisements of this proposed retreat
      for stockbrokers and insurance salesmen, "is to quaff the
      very Wine of Life. . . . A turquoise lagoon under an
      aquamarine sky! Lazy gondolas! Beautiful Italian gardens! .
      . . And, ever present, the waters of the Great South Bay
      lapping lazily all day upon a beach as white and fine as
      the soul of a little child." And there was Biltmore Shores,
      also developed on Long Island (by William Fox of the movies
      and Jacob Frankel of the clothing business) where, in 1926,
      "an artistic system of canals and waterways" was advertised
      as being "in progress of completion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Venetian phase of the suburban boom was of short
      duration: after 1926 the mention of lagoons introduced
      painful thoughts into the minds of prospective purchasers.
      But the suburban boom itself did not begin to languish in
      most localities until 1928 or 1929. By that time many
      suburbs were plainly overbuilt: as one drove out along the
      highways, one began to notice houses that must have stood
      long untenanted, shops with staring vacant windows,
      districts blighted with half-finished and abandoned
      "improvements"; one heard of suburban apartment houses
      which had changed hands again and again as mortgages were
      foreclosed, or of householders in uncompleted subdivisions
      who were groaning under a naïvely unexpected burden of
      taxes and assessments. Yet even then it was clear that,
      like Florida, the suburb had a future. The need of men and
      women for space and freedom, as well as for access to the
      centers of population, had not come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final phase of the real-estate boom of the
      nineteen-twenties centered in the cities themselves. To
      picture what happened to the American skyline during those
      years, compare a 1920 airplane view of almost any large
      city with one taken in 1930. There is scarcely a city which
      does not show a bright new cluster of skyscrapers at its
      center. The tower-building mania reached its climax in New
      York--since towers in the metropolis are a potent
      advertisement--and particularly in the Grand Central
      district of New York. Here the building boom attained
      immense proportions, coming to its peak of intensity in
      1928. New pinnacles shot into the air forty stories, fifty
      stories, and more; between 1918 and 1930 the amount of
      space available for office use in large modern buildings in
      that district was multiplied approximately by ten. In a
      photograph of uptown New York taken from the neighborhood
      of the East River early in 1931, the twenty most
      conspicuous structures were all products of the Post-war
      Decade. The tallest two of all, to be sure, were not
      completed until after the panic of 1929; by the time the
      splendid shining tower of the Empire State Building stood
      clear of scaffolding there were apple salesmen shivering on
      the curbstone below. Yet it was none the less a monument to
      the abounding confidence of the days in which it was
      conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confidence had been excessive. Skyscrapers had been
      over-produced. In the spring of 1931 it was reliably stated
      that some 17 per cent of the space in the big office
      buildings of the Grand Central district, and some 40 per
      cent of that in the big office buildings of the Plaza
      district farther uptown, were not bringing in a return;
      owners of new skyscrapers were inveigling business concerns
      into occupying vacant floors by offering them space
      rent-free for a period or by assuming their leases in other
      buildings; and financiers were shaking their heads over the
      precarious condition of many realty investments in New
      York. The metropolis, too, had a future, but speculative
      enthusiasm had carried it upward a little too fast.

      After the Florida hurricane, real-estate speculation lost
      most of its interest for the ordinary man and woman. Few of
      them were much concerned, except as householders or as
      spectators, with the building of suburban developments or
      of forty-story experiments in modernist architecture. Yet
      the national speculative fever which had turned their eyes
      and their cash to the Florida Gold Coast in 1925 was not
      chilled; it was merely checked. Florida house-lots were a
      bad bet? Very well, then, said a public still enthralled by
      the radiant possibilities of Coolidge Prosperity: what else
      was there to bet on? Before long a new wave of popular
      speculation was accumulating momentum. Not in real-estate
      this time; in something quite different. The focus of
      speculative infection shifted from Flagler Street, Miami,
      to Broad and Wall Streets, New York. The Big Bull Market
      was getting under way.

    <h2>
      THE BIG BULL MARKET
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      One day in February, 1928, an investor asked an astute
      banker about the wisdom of buying common stocks. The banker
      shook his head. "Stocks look dangerously high to me," he
      said. "This bull market has been going on for a long time,
      and although prices have slipped a bit recently, they might
      easily slip a good deal more. Business is none too good. Of
      course if you buy the right stock you'll probably be all
      right in the long run and you may even make a profit. But
      if I were you I'd wait awhile and see what happens."
    </p>
    <p>
      By all the canons of conservative finance the banker was
      right. That enormous confidence in Coolidge Prosperity
      which had lifted the businessman to a new preëminence in
      American life and had persuaded innumerable men and women
      to gamble their savings away in Florida real estate had
      also carried the prices of common stocks far upward since
      1924, until they had reached what many hard-headed
      financiers considered alarming levels. Throughout 1927
      speculation had been increasing. The amount of money loaned
      to brokers to carry margin accounts for traders had risen
      during the year from $2,818,561,000 to $3,558,355,000--a
      huge increase. During the week of December 3, 1927, more
      shares of stock had changed hands than in any previous week
      in the whole history of the New York Stock Exchange. One
      did not have to listen long to an after-dinner
      conversation, whether in New York or San Francisco or the
      lowliest village of the plain, to realize that all sorts of
      people to whom the stock ticker had been a hitherto alien
      mystery were carrying a hundred shares of Studebaker or
      Houston Oil, learning the significance of such recondite
      symbols as GL and X and ITT, and whipping open the early
      editions of afternoon papers to catch the 1:30 quotations
      from Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speculative fever had been intensified by the action of
      the Federal Reserve System in lowering the rediscount rate
      from 4 per cent to 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent in
      August, 1927, and purchasing Government securities in the
      open market. This action had been taken from the most
      laudable motives: several of the European nations were
      having difficulty in stabilizing their currencies, European
      exchanges were weak, and it seemed to the Reserve
      authorities that the easing of American money rates might
      prevent the further accumulation of gold in the United
      States and thus aid in the recovery of Europe and benefit
      foreign trade. Furthermore, American business was beginning
      to lose headway; the lowering of money rates might
      stimulate it. But the lowering of money rates also
      stimulated the stock market. The bull party in Wall Street
      had been still further encouraged by the remarkable
      solicitude of President Coolidge and Secretary Mellon, who
      whenever confidence showed signs of waning came out with
      opportunely reassuring statements which at once sent prices
      upward again. In January 1928, the President had actually
      taken the altogether unprecedented step of publicly stating
      that he did not consider brokers' loans too high, thus
      apparently giving White House sponsorship to the very
      inflation which was worrying the sober minds of the
      financial community.
    </p>
    <p>
      While stock prices had been climbing, business activity had
      been undeniably subsiding. There had been such a marked
      recession during the latter part of 1927 that by February,
      1928, the director of the Charity Organization Society in
      New York reported that unemployment was more serious than
      at any time since immediately after the war. During January
      and February the stock market turned ragged and unsettled,
      and no wonder--for with prices still near record levels and
      the future trend of business highly dubious, it was
      altogether too easy to foresee a time of reckoning ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the business analysts and forecasters--a
      fraternity whose numbers had hugely increased in recent
      years and whose lightest words carried weight--was anything
      but exuberant. On January 5, 1928, Moody's Investors
      Service said that stock prices had "over-discounted
      anticipated progress" and wondered "how much of a
      readjustment may be required to place the stock market in a
      sound position." On March 1st this agency was still uneasy:
      "The public," it declared, "is not likely to change its
      bearish state of mind until about the time when money
      becomes so plethoric as to lead the banks to encourage
      credit expansion." Two days later the Harvard Economic
      Society drew from its statistical graphs the chilly
      conclusion that "the developments of February suggest that
      business is entering upon a period of temporary
      readjustment"; the best cheer which the Harvard
      prognosticators could offer was a prophecy that
      "intermediate declines in the stock market will not develop
      into such <i>major</i> movements as forecast business
      depression." The National City Bank looked for gradual
      improvement in business and the Standard Statistics Company
      suggested that a turn for the better had already arrived;
      but the latter agency also sagely predicted that the course
      of stocks during the coming months would depend "almost
      entirely upon the money situation." The financial editor of
      the <i>New York Times</i> described the picture of current
      conditions presented by the mercantile agencies as one of
      "hesitation." The newspaper advertisements of investment
      services testified to the uncomfortable temper of Wall
      Street with headlines like "Will You 'Overstay' This Bull
      Market?" and "Is the Process of Deflation Under Way?" The
      air was fogged with uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anybody who had chosen this moment to predict that the bull
      market was on the verge of a wild advance which would make
      all that had gone before seem trifling would have been
      quite mad--or else inspired with a genius for mass
      psychology. The banker who advised caution was quite right
      about financial conditions, and so were the forecasters.
      But they had not taken account of the boundless commercial
      romanticism of the American people, inflamed by year after
      plentiful year of Coolidge Prosperity. For on March 3,
      1928--the very day when the Harvard prophets were talking
      about intermediate declines and the <i>Times</i> was
      talking about hesitation--the stock market entered upon its
      sensational phase.

      Let us glance for a moment at the next morning's paper,
      that arm-breaking load of reading-matter which bore the
      date of Sunday, March 4, 1928. It was now many months since
      Calvin Coolidge had stated, with that characteristic
      simplicity which led people to suspect him of devious
      meanings, that he did not "choose to run for President in
      1928"; and already his Secretary of Commerce, who eight
      years before had been annoyed at being called an amateur in
      politics, was corralling delegates with distinctly
      professional efficiency against the impending Republican
      convention. It was three months since Henry Ford had
      unveiled Model A, but eyes still turned to stare when a new
      Ford went by, and those who had blithely ordered a sedan in
      Arabian Sand were beginning to wonder if they would have to
      wait until September and then have to take Dawn Gray or
      leave it. Colonel Lindbergh had been a hero these nine
      months but was still a bachelor: on page 21 of that Sunday
      paper of March 4, 1928, he was quoted in disapproval of a
      bill introduced in Congress to convert the Lindbergh
      homestead at Little Falls, Minnesota, into a museum.
      Commander Byrd was about to announce his plans for a flight
      to the South Pole. Women's skirts, as pictured in the
      department store advertisements, were at their briefest;
      they barely covered the kneecap. The sporting pages
      contained the tidings that C. C. Pyle's lamentable Bunion
      Derby was about to start from Los Angeles with 274
      contestants. On another page Mrs. William Jay, Mrs. Robert
      Low Bacon, and Mrs. Charles Cary Rumsey exemplified the
      principle of <i>noblesse oblige</i> by endorsing Simmons
      beds. <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i> was advertised as
      having sold 100,000 copies in ninety days. The book section
      of the newspaper also advertised <i>The Greene Murder
      Case</i> by S. S. Van Dine (not yet identified as Willard
      Huntington Wright), Willa Cather's <i>Death Comes for the
      Archbishop,</i> and Ludwig Lewisohn's <i>The Island
      Within.</i> The theatrical pages disclosed that "The Trial
      of Mary Dugan" had been running in New York for seven
      months, Galsworthy's "Escape" for five; New York
      theater-goers might also take their choice between "Strange
      Interlude," "Show Boat," "Paris Bound," "Porgy," and "Funny
      Face." The talking pictures were just beginning to rival
      the silent films: Al Jolson was announced in "The Jazz
      Singer" on the Vitaphone, and two Fox successes "with
      symphonic movietone accompaniment" were advertised. The
      stock market--but one did not need to turn to the financial
      pages for that. For on page 1 appeared what was to prove a
      portentous piece of news.

      General Motors stock, opening at 139
      <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> on the previous morning, had
      skyrocketed in two short hours to 144
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, with a gain of more than five
      points since the Friday closing. The trading for the day
      had amounted to not much more than 1,200,000 shares, but
      nearly a third of it had been in Motors. The speculative
      spring fever of 1928 had set in.

      On Monday General Motors gained 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
      points more, on Tuesday 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>; there
      was great excitement as the stock "crossed 150." Other
      stocks were beginning to be affected by the contagion as
      day after day the market "made the front page": Steel and
      Radio and Montgomery Ward were climbing, too. After a pause
      on Wednesday and Thursday, General Motors astounded
      everybody on Friday by pushing ahead a cool 9
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> points as the announcement was
      made that its Managers Securities Company had bought
      200,000 shares in the open market for its executives at
      around 150. And then on Saturday the common stock of the
      Radio Corporation of America threw General Motors
      completely into the shade by leaping upward for a net gain
      of 12 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> points, closing at 120
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.

    <p>
      What on earth was happening? Wasn't business bad, and
      credit inflated, and the stock-price level dangerously
      high? Was the market going crazy? Suppose all these madmen
      who insisted on buying stocks at advancing prices tried to
      sell at the same moment! Canny investors, reading of the
      wild advance in Radio, felt much as did the forecasters of
      Moody's Investors Service a few days later: the practical
      question, they said, was "how long the opportunity to sell
      at the top will remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      What was actually happening was that a group of powerful
      speculators with fortunes made in the automobile business
      and in the grain markets and in the earlier days of the
      bull market in stocks--men like W. C. Durant and Arthur
      Cutten and the Fisher Brothers and John J. Raskob--were
      buying in unparalleled volume. They thought that business
      was due to come out of its doldrums. They knew that with
      Ford production delayed, the General Motors Corporation was
      likely to have a big year. They knew that the Radio
      Corporation had been consolidating its position and was now
      ready to make more money than it had ever made before, and
      that as scientific discovery followed discovery, the future
      possibilities of the biggest radio company were exciting.
      Automobiles and radios--these were the two most
      characteristic products of the decade of confident mass
      production, the brightest flowers of Coolidge Prosperity:
      they held a ready-made appeal to the speculative
      imagination. The big bull operators knew, too, that
      thousands of speculators had been selling stocks short in
      the expectation of a collapse in the market, would continue
      to sell short, and could be forced to repurchase if prices
      were driven relentlessly up. And finally, they knew their
      American public. It could not resist the appeal of a
      surging market. It had an altogether normal desire to get
      rich quick, and it was ready to believe anything about the
      golden future of American business. If stocks started
      upward the public would buy, no matter what the forecasters
      said, no matter how obscure was the business prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were right. The public bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday the 12th of March put the stock market on the front
      page once more. Radio opened at 120
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>--and closed at 138
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. Other stocks made imposing
      gains, the volume of trading broke every known record by
      totaling 3,875,910 shares, the ticker fell six minutes
      behind the market, and visitors to the gallery of the Stock
      Exchange reported that red-haired Michael Meehan, the
      specialist in Radio, was the center of what appeared to be
      a five-hour scrimmage on the floor. "It looked like a
      street fight," said one observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday the 13th was enough to give anybody chills and
      fever. Radio opened at 160, a full 21
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> points above the closing price
      the night before--a staggering advance. Then came an
      announcement that the Stock Exchange officials were
      beginning an investigation to find out whether a technical
      corner in the stock existed, and the price cascaded to 140.
      It jumped again that same day to 155 and closed at 146, 7
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> points above Monday's closing, to
      the accompaniment of rumors that one big short trader had
      been wiped out. This time the ticker was twelve minutes
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it went on, day after day and week after week. On
      March 16th the ticker was thirty-three minutes late and one
      began to hear people saying that some day there might occur
      a five-million-share day--which seemed almost incredible.
      On the 20th, Radio jumped 18 points and General Motors 5.
      On March 26th the record for total volume of trading was
      smashed again. The new mark lasted just twenty-four hours,
      for on the 27th--a terrifying day when a storm of
      unexplained selling struck the market and General Motors
      dropped abruptly, only to recover on enormous buying--there
      were 4,790,000 shares traded. The speculative fever was
      infecting the whole country. Stories of fortunes made
      overnight were on everybody's lips. One financial
      commentator reported that his doctor found patients talking
      about the market to the exclusion of everything else and
      that his barber was punctuating with the hot towel more
      than one account of the prospects of Montgomery Ward. Wives
      were asking their husbands why they were so slow, why they
      weren't getting in on all this, only to hear that their
      husbands had bought a hundred shares of American Linseed
      that very morning. Brokers' branch offices were jammed with
      crowds of men and women watching the shining transparency
      on which the moving message of the ticker tape was written;
      whether or not one held so much as a share of stock, there
      was a thrill in seeing the news of that abrupt break and
      recovery in General Motors on March 27th run across the
      field of vision in a long string of quotations:
    </p>
    <p>
      GM 50.85 (meaning 5,000 shares at 185) 20.80. 50.82. 14.83.
      30.85. 20.86. 25.87. 40.88. 30.87. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      New favorites took the limelight as the weeks went by.
      Montgomery Ward was climbing. The aviation stocks leaped
      upward; in a single week in May, Wright Aeronautical gained
      34 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> points to reach 190, and
      Curtiss gained 35 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to reach 142.
      Several times during the spring of 1928 the New York Stock
      Exchange had to remain closed on Saturday to give brokers'
      clerks a chance to dig themselves out from under the mass
      of paper work in which this unprecedented trading involved
      them. And of course brokers' loans were increasing; the
      inflation of American credit was becoming steadily
      intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reserve authorities were disturbed. They had raised the
      rediscount rate in February from 3
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 4 per cent, hoping that if a
      lowering of the rate in 1927 had encouraged speculation, a
      corresponding increase would discourage it--and instead
      they had witnessed a common-stock mania which ran counter
      to all logic and all economic theory. They raised the rate
      again in May to 4 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent, but
      after a brief shudder the market went boiling on. They sold
      the Government bonds they had accumulated during 1927, and
      the principal result of their efforts was that the
      Government-bond market became demoralized. Who would ever
      have thought the situation would thus get out of hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter part of May, 1928, the pace of the bull
      market slackened. Prices fell off, gained, fell off again.
      The reckoning, so long expected, appeared at last to be at
      hand. It came in June, after several days of declining
      prices. The Giannini stocks, the speculative favorites of
      the Pacific coast, suddenly toppled for gigantic losses. On
      the San Francisco Stock Exchange the shares of the Bank of
      Italy fell 100 points in a single day (June 11th),
      Bancitaly fell 86 points, Bank of America 120, and United
      Security 80. That same day, on the New York Curb Exchange,
      Bancitaly dove perpendicularly from 200 to 110, dragging
      with it to ruin a horde of small speculators who, despite
      urgent warnings from A. P. Giannini himself that the stock
      was overvalued, had naïvely believed that it was "going to
      a thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, June 12th, this Western tornado struck Wall
      Street in full force. As selling orders poured in, the
      prophecy that the Exchange would some day see a
      five-million-share day was quickly fulfilled. The ticker
      slipped almost two hours behind in recording prices on the
      floor. Radio, which had marched well beyond the 200 mark in
      May, lost 23 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> points. The day's
      losses for the general run of securities were not, to be
      sure, very large by subsequent standards; the <i>New York
      Times</i> averages for fifty leading stocks dropped only a
      little over three points. But after the losses of the
      preceding days, it seemed to many observers as if the end
      had come at last, and one of the most conservative New York
      papers began its front-page account of the break with the
      unqualified sentence, "Wall Street's bull market collapsed
      yesterday with a detonation heard round the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      (If the Secretary of Commerce had been superstitious, he
      might have considered that day of near-panic an omen of
      troubles to come; for on that same front page, streamer
      headlines bore the words, "HOOVER CERTAIN ON 1ST BALLOT AS
      CONVENTION OPENS.")
    </p>
    <p>
      But had the bull market collapsed? On June 13th it appeared
      to have regained its balance. On June 14th, the day of
      Hoover's nomination, it extended its recovery. The promised
      reckoning had been only partial. Prices still stood well
      above their February levels. A few thousand traders had
      been shaken out, a few big fortunes had been lost, a great
      many pretty paper profits had vanished; but the Big Bull
      Market was still young.

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after the somewhat unenthusiastic nomination of
      Herbert Hoover by the Republicans, that coalition of
      incompatibles known as the Democratic party nominated
      Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, a genial son of the
      East Side with a genius for governmental administration and
      a taste for brown derbies. Al Smith was a remarkable
      choice. His Tammany affiliations, his wetness, and above
      all the fact that he was a Roman Catholic made him
      repugnant to the South and to most of the West. Although
      the Ku Klux Klan had recently announced the abandonment of
      its masks and the change of its name to "Knights of the
      Great Forest," anti-Catholic feeling could still take ugly
      forms. That the Democrats took the plunge and nominated
      Smith on the first ballot was eloquent testimony to the
      vitality of his personality, to the wide-spread respect for
      his ability, to the strength of the belief that any
      Democrat could carry the Solid South and that a wet
      candidate of immigrant stock would pull votes from the
      Republicans in the industrial North and the cities
      generally--and to the lack of other available candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign of 1928 began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious campaign. One great issue divided the
      candidates. As already recorded in Chapter Ten, Al Smith
      made no secret of his distaste for prohibition; Hoover, on
      the other hand, called it "a great social and economic
      experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose,"
      which "must be worked out constructively." Although
      Republican spellbinders in the damply urban East seemed to
      be under the impression that what Hoover really meant was
      "worked out of constructively," and Democratic spellbinders
      in the South and rural West explained that Smith's wetness
      was just an odd personal notion which he would be powerless
      to impose upon his party, the division between the two
      candidates remained: prohibition had forced its way at last
      into a presidential campaign. There was also the ostensible
      issue of farm-relief, but on this point there was little
      real disagreement; instead there was a competition to see
      which candidate could most eloquently offer largesse to the
      unhappy Northwest. There was Smith's cherished water-power
      issue, but this aroused no flaming enthusiasm in the
      electorate, possibly because too many influential citizens
      had rosy hopes for the future of Electric Bond &amp; Share
      or Cities Service. There were also, of course, many less
      freely advertised issues: millions of men and women turned
      to Hoover because they thought Smith would make the White
      House a branch office of the Vatican, or turned to Smith
      because they wished to strike at religious intolerance, or
      opposed Hoover because they thought he would prove to be a
      stubborn doctrinaire, or were activated chiefly by dislike
      of Smith's hats or Mrs. Smith's jewelry. But no aspect of
      the campaign was more interesting than the extent to which
      it reflected the obsession of the American people with
      bull-market prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, there was no formidable third party in the
      field in 1928 as there had been in 1924. The whispering
      radicals had been lulled to sleep by the prophets of the
      new economic era. The Socialists nominated Norman Thomas,
      but were out of the race from the start. So closely had the
      ticker tape bound the American people to Wall Street, in
      fact, that even the Democrats found themselves in a
      difficult position. In other years they had shown a certain
      coolness toward the rulers of the banking and industrial
      world; but this would never do now. To criticize the
      gentlemen who occupied front seats on the prosperity
      band-wagon, or to suggest that the ultimate destination of
      the band-wagon might not be the promised land, would be
      suicidal. Nor could they deny that good times had arrived
      under a Republican administration. The best they could do
      was to argue by word and deed that they, too, could make
      America safe for dividends and rising stock prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This they now did with painful earnestness. For the
      chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, Al Smith
      chose no wild-eyed Congressman from the great open spaces;
      he chose John J. Raskob, vice-president and chairman of the
      finance committee of the General Motors Corporation,
      vice-president of the General Motors Acceptance
      Corporation, vice-president and member of the finance
      committee of the E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Company,
      director of the Bankers Trust Company, the American Surety
      Company, and the County Trust Company of New York--and
      reputed inspirer of the bull forces behind General Motors.
      Mr. Raskob was new to politics; in <i>Who's Who</i> he not
      only gave his occupation as "capitalist," but was listed as
      a Republican; but what matter? All the more credit to Al
      Smith, thought many Democrats, for having brought him at
      the eleventh hour to labor in the vineyard. With John J.
      Raskob on the Democratic side, who could claim that a
      Democratic victory would prevent common stocks from selling
      at twenty times earnings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raskob moved the Democratic headquarters to the General
      Motors Building in New York--than which there was no more
      bullish address. He proudly announced the fact that Mr.
      Harkness, "a Standard Oil financier," and Mr. Spreckels, "a
      banker and sugar refiner," and Mr. James, "a New York
      financier whose interests embrace railroads, securities
      companies, real estate, and merchandising," did not
      consider that their interests were "in the slightest degree
      imperiled by the prospect of Smith's election." (Shades of
      a thousand Democratic orators who had once extolled the New
      Freedom and spoken harsh words about Standard Oil magnates
      and New York financiers!) And Mr. Raskob and Governor Smith
      both applied a careful soft pedal to the ancient Democratic
      low-tariff doctrine--being quite unaware that within two
      years many of their opponents would be wishing that the
      Republican high-tariff plank had fallen entirely out of the
      platform and been carted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Republicans, they naturally proclaimed
      prosperity as a peculiarly Republican product, not yet
      quite perfected but ready for the finishing touches.
      Herbert Hoover himself struck the keynote for them in his
      acceptance speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the oldest and perhaps the noblest of human
      aspirations," said the Republican candidate, "has been the
      abolition of poverty. . . . We in America today are nearer
      to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the
      history of any land. The poorhouse is vanishing from among
      us. We have not yet reached the goal, but, given a chance
      to go forward with the policies of the last eight years, we
      shall soon, with the help of God, be in sight of the day
      when poverty will be banished from this nation. There is no
      guarantee against poverty equal to a job for every man.
      That is the primary purpose of the policies we advocate."
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was to come when Mr. Hoover would perhaps regret
      the cheerful confidence of that acceptance speech. It left
      only one loophole for subsequent escape: it stipulated that
      God must assist the Republican administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoover was hardly to be blamed, however, for his
      optimism. Was not business doing far better in the summer
      of 1928 than it had done during the preceding winter? Was
      not the Big Bull Market getting under way again after its
      fainting fit in June? One drank in optimism from the very
      air about one. And, after all, the first duty of a
      candidate is to get himself elected. However dubious the
      abolition of poverty might appear to Hoover the engineer
      and economist seated before a series of graphs of the
      business cycle, it appeared quite differently to Hoover the
      politician standing before the microphone. Prosperity was a
      sure-fire issue for a Republican in 1928.
    </p>
    <p>
      Al Smith put up a valiant fight, swinging strenuously from
      city to city, autographing brown derbies, denouncing
      prohibition, denouncing bigotry, and promising new salves
      for the farmer's wounds; but it was no use. The odds
      against him were too heavy. Election Day came and Hoover
      swept the country. His popular vote was nearly 21,500,000
      Smith's 15,000,000; his electoral vote was 444 to Smith's
      87; and he not only carried Smith's own state of New York
      and the doubtful border states of Oklahoma, Tennessee, and
      Kentucky, but broke the Solid South itself, winning
      Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and even Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a famous victory, and in celebration of it the stock
      market--which all through the campaign had been pushing
      into new high ground--went into a new frenzy. Now the bulls
      had a new slogan. It was "four more years of prosperity."

      During that "Hoover bull market" of November, 1928, the
      records made earlier in the year were smashed to flinders.
      Had brokers once spoken with awe of the possibility of
      five-million-share days? Five-million-share days were now
      occurring with monotonous regularity; on November 23rd the
      volume of trading almost reached seven million. Had they
      been amazed at the rising prices of seats on the Stock
      Exchange? In November a new mark of $580,000 was set. Had
      they been disturbed that Radio should sell at such an
      exorbitant price as 150? Late in November it was bringing
      400. Ten-point gains and new highs for all time were
      commonplace now. Montgomery Ward, which the previous spring
      had been climbing toward 200, touched 439
      <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> on November 30. The copper stocks
      were skyrocketing; Packard climbed to 145; Wright
      Aeronautical flew as high as 263. Brokers' loans? Of course
      they were higher than ever; but this, one was confidently
      told, was merely a sign of prosperity--a sign that the
      American people were buying on the part-payment plan a
      partnership in the future progress of the country. Call
      money rates? They ranged around 8 and 9 per cent; a little
      high, perhaps, admitted the bulls, but what was the harm if
      people chose to pay them? Business was not suffering from
      high money rates; business was doing better than ever. The
      new era had arrived, and the abolition of poverty was just
      around the corner.

      In December the market broke again, and more sharply than
      in June. There was one fearful day--Saturday, December
      7th--when the weary ticker, dragging far behind the trading
      on the floor, hammered out the story of a 72-point decline
      in Radio. Horrified tape-watchers in the brokers' offices
      saw the stock open at 361, struggle weakly up to 363, and
      then take the bumps, point by point, all the way down to
      296--which at that moment seemed like a fire-sale figure.
      (The earnings of the Radio Corporation during the first
      nine months of 1928 had been $7.54 per share, which on the
      time-honored basis of "ten times earnings" would have
      suggested the appropriateness of a price of not much over
      100; but the ten-times-earnings basis for prices had long
      since been discarded. The market, as Max Winkler said, was
      discounting not only the future but the hereafter.)
      Montgomery Ward lost 29 points that same nerve-racking
      Saturday morning, and International Harvester slipped from
      368 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 307. But just as in June,
      the market righted itself at the moment when demoralization
      seemed to be setting in. A few uneasy weeks of ragged
      prices went by, and then the advance began once more.

      The Federal Reserve authorities found themselves in an
      unhappy predicament. Speculation was clearly absorbing more
      and more of the surplus funds of the country. The inflation
      of credit was becoming more and more dangerous. The normal
      course for the Reserve banks at such a juncture would have
      been to raise the rediscount rate, thus forcing up the
      price of money for speculative purposes, rendering
      speculation less attractive, liquidating speculative loans,
      and reducing the volume of credit outstanding. But the
      Reserve banks had already raised the rate (in July) to 5
      per cent, and speculation had been affected only
      momentarily. Apparently speculators were ready to pay any
      amount for money if only prices kept on climbing. The
      Reserve authorities had waited patiently for the
      speculative fever to cure itself and it had only become
      more violent. Things had now come to such a pass that if
      they raised the rate still further, they not only ran the
      risk of bringing about a terrific smash in the market--and
      of appearing to do so deliberately and wantonly--but also
      of seriously handicapping business by forcing it to pay a
      high rate for funds. Furthermore, they feared the further
      accumulation of gold in the United States and the effect
      which this might have upon world trade. And the Treasury
      had a final special concern about interest rates--it had
      its own financing to do, and Secretary Mellon was naturally
      not enthusiastic about forcing the Government to pay a
      fancy rate for money for its own current use. It almost
      seemed as if there were no way to deflation except through
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reserve Board finally met the dilemma by thinking up a
      new and ingenious scheme. They tried to prevent the
      reloaning of Reserve funds to brokers without raising the
      rediscount rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On February 2, 1929, they issued a statement in which they
      said: "The Federal Reserve Act does not, in the opinion of
      the Federal Reserve Board, contemplate the use of the
      resources of the Federal Reserve Banks for the creation or
      extension of speculative credit. A member bank is not
      within its reasonable claims for rediscount facilities at
      its Federal Reserve Bank when it borrows either for the
      purpose of making speculative loans or for the purpose of
      maintaining speculative loans." A little less than a
      fortnight later the Board wrote to the various Reserve
      Banks asking them to "prevent as far as possible the
      diversion of Federal Reserve funds for the purpose of
      carrying loans based on securities." Meanwhile the Reserve
      Banks drastically reduced their holdings of securities
      purchased in the open market. But no increases in
      rediscount rates were permitted. Again and again, from
      February on, the directors of the New York Reserve Bank
      asked Washington for permission to lift the New York rate,
      and each time the permission was denied. The Board
      preferred to rely on their new policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate result of the statement of February 2, 1929,
      was a brief overnight collapse in stock prices. The
      subsequent result, as the Reserve Banks proceeded to bring
      pressure on their member banks to borrow only for what were
      termed legitimate business purposes, was naturally a
      further increase in call-money rates. Late in March--after
      Herbert Hoover had entered the White House and the previous
      patron saint of prosperity had retired to Northampton to
      explore the delights of autobiography--the pinch in money
      came to a sudden and alarming climax. Stock prices had been
      falling for several days when on March 26th the rate for
      call money jumped from 12 per cent to 15, and then to 17,
      and finally to 20 per cent--the highest rate since the
      dismal days of 1921. Another dizzy drop in prices took
      place. The turnover in stocks on the Exchange broke the
      November record, reaching 8,246,740 shares. Once again
      thousands of requests for more margin found their way into
      speculators' mail-boxes, and thousands of participators in
      the future prosperity of the country were sold out with the
      loss of everything they owned. Once again the Big Bull
      Market appeared to be on its last legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon several of the New York banks decided to
      come to the rescue. Whatever they thought of the new policy
      of the Federal Reserve Board, they saw a possible panic
      brewing--and anything, they decided, was better than a
      panic. The next day Charles E. Mitchell, president of the
      National City Bank, announced that his bank was prepared to
      lend twenty million dollars on call, of which five million
      would be available at 15 per cent, five million more at 16
      per cent, and so on up to 20 per cent. Mr. Mitchell's
      action--which was described by Senator Carter Glass as a
      slap in the face of the Reserve Board--served to peg the
      call money rate at 15 per cent and the threatened panic was
      averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon stocks not only ceased their precipitous fall,
      but cheerfully recovered!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson was plain: the public simply would not be shaken
      out of the market by anything short of a major disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next month or two stocks rose and fell
      uncertainly, sinking dismally for a time in May, and the
      level of brokers' loans dipped a little, but no general
      liquidation took place. Gradually money began to find its
      way more plentifully into speculative use despite the
      barriers raised by the Federal Reserve Board. A corporation
      could easily find plenty of ways to put its surplus cash
      out on call at 8 or 9 per cent without doing it through a
      member bank of the Federal Reserve System; corporations
      were eager to put their funds to such remunerative use, as
      the increase in loans "for others" showed; and the member
      banks themselves, realizing this, were showing signs of
      restiveness. When June came, the advance in prices began
      once more, almost as if nothing had happened. The Reserve
      authorities were beaten.

      By the summer of 1929, prices had soared far above the
      stormy levels of the preceding winter into the blue and
      cloudless empyrean. All the old markers by which the price
      of a promising common stock could be measured had long
      since been passed; if a stock once valued at 100 went to
      300, what on earth was to prevent it from sailing on to
      400? And why not ride with it for 50 or 100 points, with
      Easy Street at the end of the journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      By every rule of logic the situation had now become more
      perilous than ever. If inflation had been serious in 1927,
      it was far more serious in 1929, as the total of brokers'
      loans climbed toward six billion (it had been only three
      and a half billion at the end of 1927). If the price level
      had been extravagant in 1927 it was preposterous now; and
      in economics, as in physics, there is no gainsaying the
      ancient principle that the higher they go, the harder they
      fall. But the speculative memory is short. As people in the
      summer of 1929 looked back for precedents, they were
      comforted by the recollection that every crash of the past
      few years had been followed by a recovery, and that every
      recovery had ultimately brought prices to a new high point.
      Two steps up, one step down, two steps up again--that was
      how the market went. If you sold, you had only to wait for
      the next crash (they came every few months) and buy in
      again. And there was really no reason to sell at all: you
      were bound to win in the end if your stock was sound. The
      really wise man, it appeared, was he who "bought and held
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Time and again the economists and forecasters had cried,
      "Wolf, wolf," and the wolf had made only the most fleeting
      of visits. Time and again the Reserve Board had expressed
      fear of inflation, and inflation had failed to bring hard
      times. Business in danger? Why, nonsense! Factories were
      running at full blast and the statistical indices
      registered first-class industrial health. Was there a
      threat of overproduction? Nonsense again! Were not business
      concerns committed to hand-to-mouth buying, were not
      commodity prices holding to reasonable levels? Where were
      the overloaded shelves of goods, the heavy inventories,
      which business analysts universally accepted as storm
      signals? And look at the character of the stocks which were
      now leading the advance! At a moment when many of the
      high-flyers of earlier months were losing ground, the
      really sensational advances were being made by the shares
      of such solid and conservatively managed companies as
      United States Steel, General Electric, and American
      Telephone--which were precisely those which the most
      cautious investor would select with an eye to the long
      future. Their advance, it appeared, was simply a sign that
      they were beginning to have a scarcity value. As General
      George R. Dyer of Dyer, Hudson &amp; Company was quoted as
      saying in the <i>Boston News Bureau,</i> "Anyone who buys
      our highest-class rails and industrials, including the
      steels, coppers, and utilities, and holds them, will make a
      great deal of money, <i>as these securities will gradually
      be taken out of the market."</i> What the bull operators
      had long been saying must be true, after all. This was a
      new era. Prosperity was coming into full and perfect
      flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there remained doubters. Yet so cogent were the
      arguments against them that at last the great majority of
      even the sober financial leaders of the country were won
      over in some degree. They recognized that inflation might
      ultimately be a menace, but the fears of immediate and
      serious trouble which had gripped them during the preceding
      winter were being dissipated. This bull market had survived
      some terrific shocks; perhaps it was destined for a long
      life, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every side one heard the new wisdom sagely expressed:
      "Prosperity due for a decline? Why, man, we've scarcely
      started!" "Be a bull on America." "Never sell the United
      States short." "I tell you, some of these prices will look
      ridiculously low in another year or two." "Just watch that
      stock--it's going to five hundred." "The possibilities of
      that company are <i>unlimited."</i> "Never give up your
      position in a good stock." Everybody heard how many
      millions a man would have made if he had bought a hundred
      shares of General Motors in 1919 and held on. Everybody was
      reminded at some time or another that George F. Baker never
      sold anything. As for the menace of speculation, one was
      glibly assured that--as Ex-Governor Stokes of New Jersey
      had proclaimed in an eloquent speech--Columbus, Washington,
      Franklin, and Edison had all been speculators. "The way to
      wealth," wrote John J. Raskob in an article in the
      <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> alluringly entitled "Everybody
      Ought to Be Rich," "is to get into the profit end of wealth
      production in this country," and he pointed out that if one
      saved but fifteen dollars a month and invested it in good
      common stocks, allowing the dividends and rights to
      accumulate, at the end of twenty years one would have at
      least eighty thousand dollars and an income from
      investments of at least four hundred dollars a month. It
      was all so easy. The gateway to fortune stood wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, one heard, the future of American industry was
      to be assured by the application of a distinctly modern
      principle. Increased consumption, as Waddill Catchings and
      William T. Foster had pointed out, was the road to plenty.
      If we all would only spend more and more freely, the smoke
      would belch from every factory chimney, and dividends would
      mount. Already the old economic order was giving way to the
      new. As Dr. Charles Amos Dice, professor of the somewhat
      unacademic subject of business organization at Ohio State
      University, wrote in a book called <i>New Levels in the
      Stock Market,</i> there was taking place "a mighty
      revolution in industry, in trade, and in finance." The
      stock market was but "registering the tremendous changes
      that were in progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Professor Dice spoke of changes in finance, he
      certainly was right. The public no longer wanted anything
      so stale and profitless as bonds, it wanted securities
      which would return profits. Company after company was
      taking shrewd advantage of this new appetite to retire its
      bonds and issue new common stock in their place. If new
      bonds were issued, it became fashionable to give them a
      palatably speculative flavor by making them convertible
      into stock or by attaching to them warrants for the
      purchase of stock at some time in the rosy future. The
      public also seemed to prefer holding a hundred shares of
      stock priced at $50 to holding twenty shares priced at
      $250--it made one feel so much richer to be able to buy and
      sell in quantity!--and an increasing number of corporations
      therefore split up their common shares to make them
      attractive to a wide circle of buyers, whether or not any
      increase in the dividend was in immediate prospect. Many
      concerns had long made a practice of securing new capital
      by issuing to their shareholders the rights to buy new
      stock at a concession in price; this practice now became
      widely epidemic. Mergers of industrial corporations and of
      banks were taking place with greater frequency than ever
      before, prompted not merely by the desire to reduce
      overhead expenses and avoid the rigors of cut-throat
      competition, but often by sheer corporate megalomania. And
      every rumor of a merger or a split-up or an issue of rights
      was the automatic signal for a leap in the prices of the
      stocks affected--until it became altogether too tempting to
      the managers of many a concern to arrange a split-up or a
      merger or an issue of rights not without a canny eye to
      their own speculative fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years rival capitalistic interests, imitating the
      brilliant methods of Sidney Z. Mitchell, had sought to
      secure control of local electric light and power and gas
      companies and water companies and weld them into chains;
      and as the future possibilities of the utilities seized
      upon the speculative imagination, the battle between these
      groups led to an amazing proliferation of utility holding
      companies. By the summer of 1929 the competing systems had
      become so elaborate, and their interrelations had become so
      complicated, that it was difficult to arrive at even the
      vaguest idea of the actual worth of their soaring stocks.
      Even the professional analyst of financial properties was
      sometimes bewildered when he found Company A holding a
      20-per-cent interest in Company B, and B an interest in C,
      while C in turn invested in A, and D held shares in each of
      the others. But few investors seemed to care about actual
      worth. Utilities had a future and prices were going
      up--that was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile investment trusts multiplied like locusts. There
      were now said to be nearly five hundred of them, with a
      total paid-in capital of some three billion and with
      holdings of stocks--many of them purchased at the current
      high prices--amounting to something like two billion. These
      trusts ranged all the way from honestly and intelligently
      managed companies to wildly speculative concerns launched
      by ignorant or venal promoters. Some of them, it has been
      said, were so capitalized that they could not even pay
      their preferred dividends out of the income from the
      securities which they held, but must rely almost completely
      upon the hope of profits. Other investment trusts, it must
      be admitted, served from time to time the convenient
      purpose of absorbing securities which the bankers who
      controlled them might have difficulty in selling in the
      open market. Reprehensible, you say? Of course; but it was
      so easy! One could indulge in all manner of dubious
      financial practices with an unruffled conscience so long as
      prices rose. The Big Bull Market covered a multitude of
      sins. It was a golden day for the promoter, and his name
      was legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the huge pyramid of capital rose. While
      supersalesmen of automobiles and radios and a hundred other
      gadgets were loading the ultimate consumer with new and
      shining wares, supersalesmen of securities were selling him
      shares of investment trusts which held stock in holding
      companies owned the stock of banks which had affiliates
      which in turn controlled holding companies--and so on <i>ad
      infinitum.</i> Though the shelves of manufacturing
      companies and jobbers and retailers were not overloaded,
      the shelves of the ultimate consumer and the shelves of the
      distributors of securities were groaning. Trouble was
      brewing--not the same sort of trouble which had visited the
      country in 1921, but trouble none the less. Still, however,
      the cloud in the summer sky looked no bigger than a man's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many Americans actually held stock on margin during the
      fabulous summer of 1929 there seems to be no way of
      computing, but it is probably safe to put the figure at
      more than a million. (George Buchan Robinson estimated that
      three hundred million shares of stock were being carried on
      margin.) The additional number of those who held common
      stock outright and followed the daily quotations with an
      interest nearly as absorbed as that of the margin trader
      was, of course, considerably larger. As one walked up the
      aisle of the 5:27 local, or found one's seat in the trolley
      car, two out of three newspapers that one saw were open to
      the page of stock market quotations. Branch offices of the
      big Wall Street houses blossomed in every city and in
      numerous suburban villages. In 1919 there had been 500 such
      offices; by October, 1928, there were 1,192; and throughout
      most of 1929 they appeared in increasing numbers. The
      broker found himself regarded with a new wonder and esteem.
      Ordinary people, less intimate with the mysteries of Wall
      Street than he was supposed to be, hung upon his every
      word. Let him but drop a hint of a possible split-up in
      General Industries Associates and his neighbor was off
      hot-foot the next morning to place a buying order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich man's chauffeur drove with his ear laid back to
      catch the news of an impending move in Bethlehem Steel; he
      held fifty shares himself on a twenty-point margin. The
      window-cleaner at the broker's office paused to watch the
      ticker, for he was thinking of converting his laboriously
      accumulated savings into a few shares of Simmons. Edwin
      Lefèvre told of a broker's valet who had made nearly a
      quarter of a million in the market, of a trained nurse who
      cleaned up thirty thousand following the tips given her by
      grateful patients; and of a Wyoming cattleman, thirty miles
      from the nearest railroad, who bought or sold a thousand
      shares a day--getting his market returns by radio and
      telephoning his orders to the nearest large town to be
      transmitted to New York by telegram. An ex-actress in New
      York fitted up her Park Avenue apartment as an office and
      surrounded herself with charts, graphs, and financial
      reports, playing the market by telephone on an increasing
      scale and with increasing abandon. Across the dinner table
      one heard fantastic stories of sudden fortunes: a young
      banker had put every dollar of his small capital into
      Niles-Bement-Pond and now was fixed for life; a widow had
      been able to buy a large country house with her winnings in
      Kennecott. Thousands speculated--and won, too--without the
      slightest knowledge of the nature of the company upon whose
      fortunes they were relying, like the people who bought
      Seaboard Air Line under the impression that it was an
      aviation stock. Grocers, motormen, plumbers, seamstresses,
      and speakeasy waiters were in the market. Even the
      revolting intellectuals were there: loudly as they might
      lament the depressing effects of standardization and mass
      production upon American life, they found themselves quite
      ready to reap the fruits thereof. Literary editors whose
      hopes were wrapped about American Cyanamid B lunched with
      poets who swore by Cities Service, and as they left the
      table, stopped for a moment in the crowd at the broker's
      branch office to catch the latest quotations; and the
      artist who had once been eloquent only about Gauguin laid
      aside his brushes to proclaim the merits of National Bellas
      Hess. The Big Bull Market had become a national mania.

      In September the market reached its ultimate glittering
      peak.

      It was six months, now, since Herbert Hoover had driven
      down Pennsylvania Avenue in the rain to take the oath of
      office as President of the United States. He had appointed
      the Wickersham Commission to investigate law enforcement in
      general and prohibition in particular. At the President's
      instance Congress had passed the Agricultural Marketing
      Act; and Alexander Legge had assumed, among his duties as
      chairman of the new Federal Farm Board, the task of
      "preventing and controlling surpluses in any agricultural
      commodity." The Kellogg-Briand Treaty had been proclaimed
      in effect, and Ramsay MacDonald was preparing to sail for
      the United States to discuss a new treaty for the reduction
      of naval armaments. The long wrangle over the Harding oil
      scandals was at last producing definite results: Colonel
      Stewart, buried under a mountain of Rockefeller proxies,
      had left the chairmanship of the Standard Oil Company of
      Indiana, and Harry F. Sinclair was sitting in jail. Colonel
      Lindbergh, true to his rôle as the national super-hero, had
      married Miss Anne Morrow. Commander Byrd, the man who put
      heroism into quantity production, was waiting in the
      Antarctic darkness of "Little America" for his chance to
      fly to the South Pole. Nonstop flyers were zooming about
      over the American countryside, and emulation of the heroes
      of the air had reached its climax of absurdity in the
      exploit of a twenty-two-year-old boy who had climbed into
      the cabin of the <i>Yellow Bird</i> and had been carried as
      a stowaway by Assolant and Lefèvre from Old Orchard, Maine,
      to the Spanish coast. And on the sands of a thousand
      American beaches, girls pulled down the shoulder-straps of
      their bathing suits to acquire fashionably tanned backs,
      and wondered whether it would be all right to leave their
      stockings off when they drove to town, and whether it was
      true, as the journals of fashion declared, that every
      evening dress must soon reach all the way to the ground.

      This was the season when Tilden won his seventh and last
      American amateur tennis championship. It was Bobby Jones's
      penultimate year as monarch of amateur golfers--his seventh
      successive year as winner of either the amateur or the open
      championship of the United States. Babe Ruth was still
      hammering out home runs as successfully as in 1920, but he
      too was getting older: a sporting cycle was drawing to its
      close. Dempsey had lost his crown to Tunney, Tunney had
      hung it on the wall to go and foregather with the
      <i>literati,</i> and there was no one to follow them as a
      magnet for two-million-dollar crowds.

      Everybody was reading <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>
      and singing the songs which Rudy Vallee crooned over the
      radio. The literary journals were making a great fuss over
      humanism. But even sun-tan and Ramsay MacDonald's proposed
      good-will voyage and humanism and <i>All Quiet</i> were
      dull subjects for talk compared with the Big Bull Market.
      Had not Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company just expressed its
      confidence in the present level of prices by sponsoring the
      Blue Ridge Corporation, an investment trust which offered
      to exchange its stock for those of the leading "blue chips"
      at the current figures--324 for Allied Chemical and Dye,
      293 for American Telephone, 179 for Consolidated Gas, 395
      for General Electric, and so on down the list?

      Stop for a moment to glance at a few of the prices recorded
      on the overworked ticker on September 3, 1929, the day when
      the Dow-Jones averages reached their high point for the
      year; and compare them with the opening prices of March 3,
      1928, when, as you may recall, it had seemed as if the bull
      market had already climbed to a perilous altitude. Here
      they are, side by side--first the figures for March, 1928;
      then the figures for September, 1929; and finally the
      latter figures translated into 1928 terms--or in other
      words revised to make allowance for intervening split-ups
      and issues of rights. (Only thus can you properly judge the
      extent of the advance during those eighteen confident
      months.)

      Note: The prices of General Electric, Radio, Union Carbide,
      and Woolworth are here adjusted to take account of
      split-ups occurring subsequent to March 3, 1928. The prices
      of American Telephone, Anaconda, Montgomery Ward, United
      States Steel, Westinghouse, and Electric Bond <i>&amp;</i>
      Share are adjusted to take account of intervening issues of
      rights; they represent the value per share on September 3,
      1929, of a holding acquired on March 3, 1928, the
      adjustment being based on the assumption that rights
      offered in the interval were exercised.

      One thing more: as you look at the high prices recorded on
      September 3, 1929, remember that on that day few people
      imagined that the peak had actually been reached. The
      enormous majority fully expected the Big Bull Market to go
      on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the blood of the pioneers still ran in American veins;
      and if there was no longer something lost behind the
      ranges, still the habit of seeing visions persisted. What
      if bright hopes had been wrecked by the sordid
      disappointments of 1919, the collapse of Wilsonian
      idealism, the spread of political cynicism, the slow decay
      of religious certainty, and the debunking of love? In the
      Big Bull Market there was compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the American could spin wonderful dreams--of a
      romantic day when he would sell his Westinghouse common at
      a fabulous price and live in a great house and have a fleet
      of shining cars and loll at ease on the sands of Palm
      Beach. And when he looked toward the future of his country,
      he could envision an America set free--not from graft, nor
      from crime, nor from war, nor from control by Wall Street,
      nor from irreligion, nor from lust, for the Utopias of an
      earlier day left him for the most part skeptical or
      indifferent; he envisioned an America set free from poverty
      and toil. He saw a magical order built on the new science
      and the new prosperity: roads swarming with millions upon
      millions of automobiles, airplanes darkening the skies,
      lines of high-tension wire carrying from hilltop to hilltop
      the power to give life to a thousand labor-saving machines,
      skyscrapers thrusting above one-time villages, vast cities
      rising in great geometrical masses of stone and concrete
      and roaring with perfectly mechanized traffic--and smartly
      dressed men and women spending, spending, spending with the
      money they had won by being far-sighted enough to foresee,
      way back in 1929, what was going to happen.

      Early in September the stock market broke. It quickly
      recovered, however; indeed, on September 19th the averages
      as compiled by the <i>New York Times</i> reached an even
      higher level than that of September 3rd. Once more it
      slipped, farther and faster, until by October 4th the
      prices of a good many stocks had coasted to what seemed
      first-class bargain levels. Steel, for example, after
      having touched 261 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> a few weeks
      earlier, had dropped as low as 204; American Can, at the
      closing on October 4th, was nearly twenty points below its
      high for the year; General Electric was over fifty points
      below its high; Radio had gone down from 114
      <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 82 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bad break, to be sure, but there had been other bad
      breaks, and the speculators who escaped unscathed proceeded
      to take advantage of the lessons they had learned in June
      and December of 1928 and March and May of 1929: when there
      was a break it was a good time to buy. In the face of all
      this tremendous liquidation, brokers' loans as compiled by
      the Federal Reserve Bank of New York mounted to a new high
      record on October 2nd, reaching $6,804,000,000--a sure sign
      that margin buyers were not deserting the market but coming
      into it in numbers at least undiminished. (Part of the
      increase in the loan figure was probably due to the piling
      up of unsold securities in dealers' hands, as the spawning
      of investment trusts and the issue of new common stock by
      every manner of business concern continued unabated.)
      History, it seemed, was about to repeat itself, and those
      who picked up Anaconda at 109 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> or
      American Telephone at 281 would count themselves wise
      investors. And sure enough, prices once more began to
      climb. They had already turned upward before that Sunday in
      early October when Ramsay MacDonald sat on a log with
      Herbert Hoover at the Rapidan camp and talked over the
      prospects for naval limitation and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something was wrong, however. The decline began once more.
      The wiseacres of Wall Street, looking about for causes,
      fixed upon the collapse of the Hatry financial group in
      England (which had led to much forced selling among foreign
      investors and speculators), and upon the bold refusal of
      the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities to allow
      the Edison Company of Boston to split up its stock. They
      pointed, too, to the fact that the steel industry was
      undoubtedly slipping, and to the accumulation of
      "undigested" securities. But there was little real alarm
      until the week of October 21st. The consensus of opinion,
      in the meantime, was merely that the equinoctial storm of
      September had not quite blown over. The market was
      readjusting itself into a "more secure technical position."

      In view of what was about to happen, it is enlightening to
      recall how things looked at this juncture to the financial
      prophets, those gentlemen whose wizardly reputations were
      based upon their supposed ability to examine a set of
      graphs brought to them by a statistician and discover, from
      the relation of curve to curve and index to index, whether
      things were going to get better or worse. Their opinions
      differed, of course; there never has been a moment when the
      best financial opinion was unanimous. In examining these
      opinions, and the outgivings of eminent bankers, it must
      furthermore be acknowledged that a bullish statement cannot
      always be taken at its face value: few men like to assume
      the responsibility of spreading alarm by making dire
      predictions, nor is a banker with unsold securities on his
      hands likely to say anything which will make it more
      difficult to dispose of them, unquiet as his private mind
      may be. Finally, one must admit that prophecy is at best
      the most hazardous of occupations. Nevertheless, the
      general state of financial opinion in October, 1929, makes
      an instructive contrast with that in February and March,
      1928, when, as we have seen, the skies had not appeared any
      too bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some forecasters, to be sure, were so unconventional as to
      counsel caution. Roger W. Babson, an investment adviser who
      had not always been highly regarded in the inner circles of
      Wall Street, especially since he had for a long time been
      warning his clients of future trouble, predicted early in
      September a decline of sixty or eighty points in the
      averages. On October 7th the Standard Trade and Securities
      Service of the Standard Statistics Company advised its
      clients to pursue an "ultra-conservative policy," and
      ventured this prediction: "We remain of the opinion that,
      over the next few months, the trend of common-stock prices
      will be toward lower levels." Poor's <i>Weekly Business and
      Investment Letter</i> spoke its mind on the "great
      common-stock delusion" and predicted "further liquidation
      in stocks." Among the big bankers, Paul M. Warburg had
      shown months before this that he was alive to the dangers
      of the situation. These commentators--along with others
      such as the editor of the <i>Commercial and Financial
      Chronicle</i> and the financial editor of the <i>New York
      Times</i>--would appear to deserve the 1929 gold medals for
      foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if ever such medals were actually awarded, a goodly
      number of leather ones would have to be distributed at the
      same time. Not necessarily to the Harvard Economic Society,
      although on October 19th, after having explained that
      business was "facing another period of readjustment," it
      predicted that "if recession should threaten serious
      consequences for business (as is not indicated at present)
      there is little doubt that the Reserve System would take
      steps to ease the money market and so check the movement."
      The Harvard soothsayers proved themselves quite fallible:
      as late as October 26th, after the first wide-open crack in
      the stock market, they delivered the cheerful judgment that
      "despite its severity, we believe that the slump in stock
      prices will prove an intermediate movement and not the
      precursor of a business depression such as would entail
      prolonged further liquidation." This judgment turned out,
      of course, to be ludicrously wrong; but on the other hand
      the Harvard Economic Society was far from being really
      bullish. Nor would Colonel Leonard P. Ayres of the
      Cleveland Trust Company get one of the leather medals. He
      almost qualified when, on October 15th, he delivered
      himself of the judgment that "there does not seem to be as
      yet much real evidence that the decline in stock prices is
      likely to forecast a serious recession in general business.
      Despite the slowing down in iron and steel production, in
      automobile output, and in building, the conditions which
      result in serious business depressions are not present."
      But the skies, as Colonel Ayres saw them, were at least
      partly cloudy. "It seems probable," he said, "that stocks
      have been passing not so much from the strong to the weak
      as from the smart to the dumb."
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Irving Fisher, however, was more optimistic. In
      the newspapers of October 17th he was reported as telling
      the Purchasing Agents Association that stock prices had
      reached "what looks like a permanently high plateau." He
      expected to see the stock market, within a few months, "a
      good deal higher than it is today." On the very eve of the
      panic of October 24th he was further quoted as expecting a
      recovery in prices. Only two days before the panic, the
      <i>Boston News Bureau</i> quoted R. W. McNeel, director of
      McNeel's Financial Service, as suspecting "that some pretty
      intelligent people are now buying stocks." "Unless we are
      to have a panic--which no one seriously believes--stocks
      have hit bottom," said Mr. McNeel. And as for Charles E.
      Mitchell, chairman of the great National City Bank of New
      York, he continuously and enthusiastically radiated
      sunshine. Early in October Mr. Mitchell was positive that,
      despite the stock-market break, "The industrial situation
      of the United States is absolutely sound and our credit
      situation is in no way critical. . . . The interest given
      by the public to brokers' loans is always exaggerated," he
      added. "Altogether too much attention is paid to it." A few
      days later Mr. Mitchell spoke again: "Although in some
      cases speculation has gone too far in the United States,
      the markets generally are now in a healthy condition. The
      last six weeks have done an immense amount of good by
      shaking down prices. . . . The market values have a sound
      basis in the general prosperity of our country." Finally,
      on October 22nd, two days before the panic, he arrived in
      the United States from a short trip to Europe with these
      reassuring words: "I know of nothing fundamentally wrong
      with the stock market or with the underlying business and
      credit structure. . . . The public is suffering from
      'brokers' loanitis.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Mr. Mitchell by any means alone in his opinions. To
      tell the truth, the chief difference between him and the
      rest of the financial community was that he made more
      noise. One of the most distinguished bankers in the United
      States, in closing a deal in the early autumn of 1929, said
      privately that he saw not a cloud in the sky. Habitual
      bulls like Arthur Cutten were, of course, insisting that
      they were "still bullish." And the general run of traders
      presumably endorsed the view attributed to "one large
      house" in mid-October in the <i>Boston News Bureau's</i>
      "Broad Street Gossip," that "the recent break makes a firm
      foundation for a big bull market in the last quarter of the
      year." There is no doubt that a great many speculators who
      had looked upon the midsummer prices as too high were now
      deciding that deflation had been effected and were buying
      again. Presumably most financial opinion agreed also with
      the further statement which appeared in the "Broad Street
      Gossip" column on October 16th, that "business is now too
      big and diversified, and the country too rich, to be
      influenced by stock market fluctuations"; and with the
      editorial opinion of the <i>News Bureau,</i> on October
      19th, that "whatever recessions (in business) are noted,
      are those of the runner catching his breath. . . . The
      general condition is satisfactory and fundamentally sound."
    </p>

      The disaster which was impending was destined to be as
      bewildering and frightening to the rich and the powerful
      and the customarily sagacious as to the foolish and unwary
      holder of fifty shares of margin stock.

      The expected recovery in the stock market did not come. It
      seemed to be beginning on Tuesday, October 22nd, but the
      gains made during the day were largely lost during the last
      hour. And on Wednesday, the 23rd, there was a perfect
      Niagara of liquidation. The volume of trading was over
      6,000,000 shares, the tape was 104 minutes late when the
      three-o'clock gong ended trading for the day, and the
      <i>New York Times</i> averages for fifty leading railroad
      and industrial stocks lost 18.24 points--a loss which made
      the most abrupt declines in previous breaks look small.
      Everybody realized that an unprecedented number of margin
      calls must be on their way to insecurely margined traders,
      and that the situation at last was getting serious. But
      perhaps the turn would come tomorrow. Already the break had
      carried prices down a good deal farther than the previous
      breaks of the past two years. Surely it could not go on
      much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Thursday, October 24th.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that momentous day stocks opened moderately steady in
      price, but in enormous volume. Kennecott appeared on the
      tape in a block of 20,000 shares, General Motors in another
      of the same amount. Almost at once the ticker tape began to
      lag behind the trading on the floor. The pressure of
      selling orders was disconcertingly heavy. Prices were going
      down. . . . Presently they were going down with some
      rapidity. . . . Before the first hour of trading was over,
      it was already apparent that they were going down with an
      altogether unprecedented and amazing violence. In brokers'
      offices all over the country, tape-watchers looked at one
      another in astonishment and perplexity. Where on earth was
      this torrent of selling orders coming from?
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact answer to this question will probably never be
      known. But it seems probable that the principal cause of
      the break in prices during that first hour on October 24th
      was not fear. Nor was it short selling. It was forced
      selling. It was the dumping on the market of hundreds of
      thousands of shares of stock held in the name of miserable
      traders whose margins were exhausted or about to be
      exhausted. The gigantic edifice of prices was honeycombed
      with speculative credit and was now breaking under its own
      weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear, however, did not long delay its coming. As the price
      structure crumbled there was a sudden stampede to get out
      from under. By eleven o'clock traders on the floor of the
      Stock Exchange were in a wild scramble to "sell at the
      market." Long before the lagging ticker could tell what was
      happening, word had gone out by telephone and telegraph
      that the bottom was dropping out of things, and the selling
      orders redoubled in volume. The leading stocks were going
      down two, three, and even five points between sales. Down,
      down, down. . . . Where were the bargain-hunters who were
      supposed to come to the rescue at times like this? Where
      were the investment trusts, which were expected to provide
      a cushion for the market by making new purchases at low
      prices? Where were the big operators who had declared that
      they were still bullish? Where were the powerful bankers
      who were supposed to be able at any moment to support
      prices? There seemed to be no support whatever. Down, down,
      down. The roar of voices which rose from the floor of the
      Exchange had become a roar of panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      United States Steel had opened at 205
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. It crashed through 200 and
      presently was at 193 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. General
      Electric, which only a few weeks before had been selling
      above 400, had opened this morning at 315--now it had slid
      to 283. Things were even worse with Radio: opening at 68
      <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, it had gone dismally down
      through the sixties and the fifties and the forties to the
      abysmal price of 44 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. And as for
      Montgomery Ward, vehicle of the hopes of thousands who saw
      the chain store as the harbinger of the new economic era,
      it had dropped headlong from 83 to 50. In the space of two
      short hours, dozens of stocks lost ground which it had
      required many months of the bull market to gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this sudden decline in values might not have been
      utterly terrifying if people could have known precisely
      what was happening at any moment. It is the unknown which
      causes real panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose a man walked into a broker's branch office between
      twelve and one o'clock on October 24th to see how things
      were faring. First he glanced at the big board, covering
      one wall of the room, on which the day's prices for the
      leading stocks were supposed to be recorded. The LOW and
      LAST figures written there took his breath away, but soon
      he was aware that they were unreliable: even with the
      wildest scrambling, the boys who slapped into place the
      cards which recorded the last prices shown on the ticker
      could not keep up with the changes--they were too numerous
      and abrupt. He turned to the shining screen across which
      ran an uninterrupted procession of figures from the ticker.
      Ordinarily the practiced tape-watcher could tell from a
      moment's glance at the screen how things were faring, even
      though the Exchange now omitted all but the final digit of
      each quotation. A glance at the board, if not his own
      memory, supplied the missing digits. But today, when he saw
      a run of symbols and figures like

      he could not be sure whether the price of "6" shown for
      Radio meant 66 or 56 or 46; whether Westinghouse was
      sliding from 189 to 187 or from 179 to 177. And presently
      he heard that the ticker was an hour and a half late; at
      one o'clock it was recording the prices of half-past
      eleven! All this that he saw was ancient history. What was
      happening on the floor now?
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten-minute intervals the bond ticker over in the corner
      would hammer off a list of selected prices direct from the
      floor, and a broker's clerk would grab the uncoiling sheet
      of paper and shear it off with a pair of scissors and read
      the figures aloud in a mumbling expressionless monotone to
      the white-faced men who occupied every seat on the floor
      and stood packed at the rear of the room. The prices which
      he read out were <i>ten or a dozen or more points below
      those recorded on the ticker.</i> What about the stocks not
      included in that select list? There was no way of finding
      out. The telephone lines were clogged as inquiries and
      orders from all over the country converged upon the Stock
      Exchange. Once in a while a voice would come barking out of
      the broker's rear office where a frantic clerk was
      struggling for a telephone connection: "Steel at
      ninety-six!" Small comfort, however, to know what Steel was
      doing; the men outside were desperately involved in many
      another stock than Steel; they were almost completely in
      the dark, and their imaginations had free play. If they put
      in an order to buy or to sell, it was impossible to find
      out what became of it. The Exchange's whole system for the
      recording of current prices and for communicating orders
      was hopelessly unable to cope with the emergency, and the
      sequel was an epidemic of fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that broker's office, as in hundreds of other offices
      from one end of the land to the other, one saw men looking
      defeat in the face. One of them was slowly walking up and
      down, mechanically tearing a piece of paper into tiny and
      still tinier fragments. Another was grinning shamefacedly,
      as a small boy giggles at a funeral. Another was abjectly
      beseeching a clerk for the latest news of American &amp;
      Foreign Power. And still another was sitting motionless, as
      if stunned, his eyes fixed blindly upon the moving figures
      on the screen, those innocent-looking figures that meant
      the smash-up of the hopes of years. . . .

      A few minutes after noon, some of the more alert members of
      a crowd which had collected on the street outside the Stock
      Exchange, expecting they knew not what, recognized Charles
      E. Mitchell, erstwhile defender of the bull market,
      slipping quietly into the offices of J. P. Morgan &amp;
      Company on the opposite corner. It was scarcely more than
      nine years since the House of Morgan had been pitted with
      the shrapnel-fire of the Wall Street explosion; now its
      occupants faced a different sort of calamity equally near
      at hand. Mr. Mitchell was followed shortly by Albert H.
      Wiggin, head of the Chase National Bank; William Potter,
      head of the Guaranty Trust Company; and Seward Prosser,
      head of the Bankers Trust Company. They had come to confer
      with Thomas W. Lamont of the Morgan firm. In the space of a
      few minutes these five men, with George F. Baker, Jr., of
      the First National Bank, agreed in behalf of their
      respective institutions to put up forty million apiece to
      shore up the stock market. The object of the
      two-hundred-and-forty-million-dollar pool thus formed, as
      explained subsequently by Mr. Lamont, was not to hold
      prices at any given level, but simply to make such
      purchases as were necessary to keep trading on an orderly
      basis. Their first action, they decided, would be to try to
      steady the prices of the leading securities which served as
      bellwethers for the list as a whole. It was a dangerous
      plan, for with hysteria spreading there was no telling what
      sort of <i>débâcle</i> might be impending. But this was no
      time for any action but the boldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bankers separated. Mr. Lamont faced a gathering of
      reporters in the Morgan offices. His face was grave, but
      his words were soothing. His first sentence alone was one
      of the most remarkable understatements of all time. "There
      has been a little distress selling on the Stock Exchange,"
      said he, "and we have held a meeting of the heads of
      several financial institutions to discuss the situation. We
      have found that there are no houses in difficulty and
      reports from brokers indicate that margins are being
      maintained satisfactorily." He went on to explain that what
      had happened was due to a "technical condition of the
      market" rather than to any fundamental cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the news that the bankers were meeting circulated on the
      floor of the Exchange, prices began to steady. Soon a brisk
      rally set in. Steel jumped back to the level at which it
      had opened that morning. But the bankers had more to offer
      the dying bull market than a Morgan partner's best bedside
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about half-past one o'clock Richard Whitney,
      vice-president of the Exchange, who usually acted as floor
      broker for the Morgan interests, went into the "steel
      crowd" and put in a bid of 205--the price of the last
      previous sale--for 10,000 shares of Steel. He bought only
      200 shares and left the remainder of the order with the
      specialist. Mr. Whitney then went to various other points
      on the floor, and offered the price of the last previous
      sale for 10,000 shares of each of fifteen or twenty other
      stocks, reporting what was sold to him at that price and
      leaving the remainder of the order with the specialist. In
      short, within the space of a few minutes Mr. Whitney
      offered to purchase something in the neighborhood of twenty
      or thirty million dollars' worth of stock. Purchases of
      this magnitude are not undertaken by Tom, Dick, and Harry;
      it was clear that Mr. Whitney represented the bankers'
      pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desperate remedy worked. The semblance of confidence
      returned. Prices held steady for a while; and though many
      of them slid off once more in the final hour, the net
      results for the day might well have been worse. Steel
      actually closed two points higher than on Wednesday, and
      the net losses of most of the other leading securities
      amounted to less than ten points apiece for the whole day's
      trading.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, it had been a frightful day. At seven o'clock
      that night the tickers in a thousand brokers' offices were
      still chattering; not till after 7:08 did they finally
      record the last sale made on the floor at three o'clock.
      The volume of trading had set a new record--12,894,650
      shares. ("The time may come when we shall see a
      five-million-share day," the wise men of the Street had
      been saying twenty months before!) Incredible rumors had
      spread wildly during the early afternoon--that eleven
      speculators had committed suicide, that the Buffalo and
      Chicago exchanges had been closed, that troops were
      guarding the New York Stock Exchange against an angry mob.
      The country had known the bitter taste of panic. And
      although the bankers' pool had prevented for the moment an
      utter collapse, there was no gainsaying the fact that the
      economic structure had cracked wide open.

    <p>
      Things looked somewhat better on Friday and Saturday.
      Trading was still on an enormous scale, but prices for the
      most part held. At the very moment when the bankers' pool
      was cautiously disposing of as much as possible of the
      stock which it had accumulated on Thursday and was thus
      preparing for future emergencies, traders who had sold out
      higher up were coming back into the market again with new
      purchases, in the hope that the bottom had been reached.
      (Hadn't they often been told that "the time to buy is when
      things look blackest"?) The newspapers carried a very
      pretty series of reassuring statements from the occupants
      of the seats of the mighty; Herbert Hoover himself, in a
      White House statement, pointed out that "the fundamental
      business of the country, that is, production and
      distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous
      basis." But toward the close of Saturday's session prices
      began to slip again. And on Monday the rout was under way
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The losses registered on Monday were terrific--17
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> points for Steel, 47
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> for General Electric, 36 for
      Allied Chemical, 34 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> for
      Westinghouse, and so on down a long and dismal list. All
      Saturday afternoon and Saturday night and Sunday the
      brokers had been struggling to post their records and go
      over their customers' accounts and sent out calls for
      further margin, and another avalanche of forced selling
      resulted. The prices at which Mr. Whitney's purchases had
      steadied the leading stocks on Thursday were so readily
      broken through that it was immediately clear that the
      bankers' pool had made a strategic retreat. As a matter of
      fact, the brokers who represented the pool were having
      their hands full plugging up the "air-holes" in the
      list--in other words, buying stocks which were offered for
      sale without any bids at all in sight. Nothing more than
      this could have been accomplished, even if it could have
      been wisely attempted. Even six great banks could hardly
      stem the flow of liquidation from the entire United States.
      They could only guide it a little, check it momentarily
      here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the ticker dropped ridiculously far behind, the
      lights in the brokers' offices and the banks burned till
      dawn, and the telegraph companies distributed thousands of
      margin calls and requests for more collateral to back up
      loans at the banks. Bankers, brokers, clerks, messengers
      were almost at the end of their strength; for days and
      nights they had been driving themselves to keep pace with
      the most terrific volume of business that had ever
      descended upon them. It did not seem as if they could stand
      it much longer. But the worst was still ahead. It came the
      next day, Tuesday, October 29th.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big gong had hardly sounded in the great hall of the
      Exchange at ten o'clock Tuesday morning before the storm
      broke in full force. Huge blocks of stock were thrown upon
      the market for what they would bring. Five thousand shares,
      ten thousand shares appeared at a time on the laboring
      ticker at fearful recessions in price. Not only were
      innumerable small traders being sold out, but big ones,
      too, protagonists of the new economic era who a few weeks
      before had counted themselves millionaires. Again and again
      the specialist in a stock would find himself surrounded by
      brokers fighting to sell--and nobody at all even thinking
      of buying. To give one single example: during the bull
      market the common stock of the White Sewing Machine Company
      had gone as high as 48; on Monday, October 28th, it had
      closed at 11 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>. On that black
      Tuesday, somebody--a clever messenger boy for the Exchange,
      it was rumored--had the bright idea of putting in an order
      to buy at 1--and in the temporarily complete absence of
      other bids he actually got his stock for a dollar a share!
      The scene on the floor was chaotic. Despite the jamming of
      the communication system, orders to buy and sell--mostly to
      sell--came in faster than human beings could possibly
      handle them; it was on that day that an exhausted broker,
      at the close of the session, found a large waste-basket
      which he had stuffed with orders to be executed and had
      carefully set aside for safekeeping--and then had
      completely forgotten. Within half an hour of the opening
      the volume of trading had passed 3,000,000 shares, by
      twelve o'clock it had passed 8,000,000, by half-past one it
      had passed twelve 12,000,000, and when the closing gong
      brought the day's madness to an end the gigantic record of
      16,410,030 shares had been set. Toward the close there was
      a rally, but by that time the average prices of fifty
      leading stocks, as compiled by the <i>New York Times,</i>
      had fallen nearly forty points. Meanwhile there was a
      near-panic in other markets--the foreign stock exchanges,
      the lesser American exchanges, the grain market.
    </p>
    <p>
      So complete was the demoralization of the stock market and
      so exhausted were the brokers and their staffs and the
      Stock Exchange employees, that at noon that day, when the
      panic was at its worst, the Governing Committee met quietly
      to decide whether or not to close the Exchange. To quote
      from an address made some months later by Richard Whitney:
      "In order not to give occasion for alarming rumors, this
      meeting was not held in the Governing Committee Room, but
      in the office of the president of the Stock Clearing
      Corporation directly beneath the Stock Exchange floor. . .
      . The forty governors came to the meeting in groups of two
      and three as unobtrusively as possible. The office they met
      in was never designed for large meetings of this sort, with
      the result that most of the governors were compelled to
      stand, or to sit on tables. As the meeting progressed,
      panic was raging overhead on the floor. . . . The feeling
      of those present was revealed by their habit of continually
      lighting cigarettes, taking a puff or two, putting them out
      and lighting new ones--a practice which soon made the
      narrow room blue with smoke. . . ." Two of the Morgan
      partners were invited to the meeting and, attempting to
      slip into the building unnoticed so as not to start a new
      flock of rumors, were refused admittance by one of the
      guards and had to remain outside until rescued by a member
      of the Governing Committee. After some deliberation, the
      governors finally decided not to close the Exchange.

      It was a critical day for the banks, that Tuesday the 29th.
      Many of the corporations which had so cheerfully loaned
      money to brokers through the banks in order to obtain
      interest at 8 or 9 per cent were now clamoring to have
      these loans called--and the banks were faced with a choice
      between taking over the loans themselves and running the
      risk of precipitating further ruin. It was no laughing
      matter to assume the responsibility of millions of dollars'
      worth of loans secured by collateral which by the end of
      the day might prove to have dropped to a fraction of its
      former value. That the call money rate never rose above 6
      per cent that day, that a money panic was not added to the
      stock panic, and that several Wall Street institutions did
      not go down into immediate bankruptcy, was due largely to
      the nerve shown by a few bankers in stepping into the
      breach. The story is told of one banker who went grimly on
      authorizing the taking over of loan after loan until one of
      his subordinate officers came in with a white face and told
      him that the bank was insolvent. "I dare say," said the
      banker, and went ahead unmoved. He knew that if he did not,
      more than one concern would face insolvency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day--Wednesday, October 30th--the outlook suddenly
      and providentially brightened. The directors of the Steel
      Corporation had declared an extra dividend; the directors
      of the American Can Company had not only declared an extra
      dividend, but had raised the regular dividend. There was
      another flood of reassuring statements--though by this time
      a cheerful statement from a financier fell upon somewhat
      skeptical ears. Julius Klein, Mr. Hoover's Assistant
      Secretary of Commerce, composed a rhapsody on continued
      prosperity. John J. Raskob declared that stocks were at
      bargain prices and that he and his friends were buying.
      John D. Rockefeller poured Standard Oil upon the waters:
      "Believing that fundamental conditions of the country are
      sound and that there is nothing in the business situation
      to warrant the destruction of values that has taken place
      on the exchanges during the past week, my son and I have
      for some days been purchasing sound common stocks." Better
      still, prices rose--steadily and buoyantly. Now at last the
      time had come when the strain on the Exchange could be
      relieved without causing undue alarm. At 1:40 o'clock
      Vice-President Whitney announced from the rostrum that the
      Exchange would not open until noon the following day and
      would remain closed all day Friday and Saturday--and to his
      immense relief the announcement was greeted, not with
      renewed panic, but with a cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout Thursday's short session the recovery continued.
      Prices gyrated wildly--for who could arrive at a reasonable
      idea of what a given stock was worth, now that all settled
      standards of value had been upset?--but the worst of the
      storm seemed to have blown over. The financial community
      breathed more easily; now they could have a chance to set
      their houses in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that the worst of the panic was past. But not
      the worst prices. There was too much forced liquidation
      still to come as brokers' accounts were gradually
      straightened out, as banks called for more collateral, and
      terror was renewed. The next week, in a series of short
      sessions, the tide of prices receded once more--until at
      last on November 13th the bottom prices for the year 1929
      were reached. Beside the figures hung up in the sunny days
      of September they made a tragic showing:

      The <i>New York Times</i> averages for fifty leading stocks
      had been almost cut in half, falling from a high of 311.90
      in September to a low of 164.43 on November 13th; and the
      <i>Times</i> averages for twenty-five leading industrials
      had fared still worse, diving from 469.49 to 220.95.

      The Big Bull Market was dead. Billions of dollars' worth of
      profits--and paper profits--had disappeared. The grocer,
      the window-cleaner, and the seamstress had lost their
      capital. In every town there were families which had
      suddenly dropped from showy affluence into debt. Investors
      who had dreamed of retiring to live on their fortunes now
      found themselves back once more at the very beginning of
      the long road to riches. Day by day the newspapers printed
      the grim reports of suicides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coolidge-Hoover Prosperity was not yet dead, but it was
      dying. Under the impact of the shock of panic, a multitude
      of ills which hitherto had passed unnoticed or had been
      offset by stock-market optimism began to beset the body
      economic, as poisons seep through the human system when a
      vital organ has ceased to function normally. Although the
      liquidation of nearly three billion dollars of brokers'
      loans contracted credit, and the Reserve Banks lowered the
      rediscount rate, and the way in which the larger banks and
      corporations of the country had survived the emergency
      without a single failure of large proportions offered real
      encouragement, nevertheless the poisons were there:
      overproduction of capital; overambitious expansion of
      business concerns; overproduction of commodities under the
      stimulus of installment buying and buying with stock-market
      profits; the maintenance of an artificial price level for
      many commodities; the depressed condition of European
      trade. No matter how many soothsayers of high finance
      proclaimed that all was well, no matter how earnestly the
      President set to work to repair the damage with soft words
      and White House conferences, a major depression was
      inevitably under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was that all. Prosperity is more than an economic
      condition; it is a state of mind. The Big Bull Market had
      been more than the climax of a business cycle; it had been
      the climax of a cycle in American mass thinking and mass
      emotion. There was hardly a man or woman in the country
      whose attitude toward life had not been affected by it in
      some degree and was not now affected by the sudden and
      brutal shattering of hope. With the Big Bull Market gone
      and prosperity going, Americans were soon to find
      themselves living in an altered world which called for new
      adjustments, new ideas, new habits of thought, and a new
      order of values. The psychological climate was changing;
      the ever-shifting currents of American life were turning
      into new channels.

      The Post-war Decade had come to its close. An era had

      Not without long and unhappy protest did the country accept
      as an inevitable fact the breakdown of Coolidge-Hoover
      Prosperity. It was a bitter draught to swallow; especially
      bitter for the Republican party, which had so far forgotten
      the business cycle's independence of political policies as
      to persuade itself that prosperity was a Republican
      invention; and bitterest of all for Herbert Hoover, who had
      uttered such confident words about the abolition of
      poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the stock market went over the edge of Niagara in
      October and November, 1929, and the decline in business
      became alarming, the country turned to the President for
      action. Something must be done immediately to restore
      public confidence and prevent the damage from spreading too
      far. Mr. Hoover was a student of business, a superlative
      organizer, and no novice in the art of directing public
      opinion; whatever his deficiencies might be in dealing with
      politicians and meeting purely political issues, the
      country felt that in a public emergency of this sort he
      would know what to do and how to do it if anybody on earth
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President acted promptly. He promised a reduction in
      taxes. He called a series of conferences of business
      leaders who expressed public disapproval of the idea of
      lowering wages. He recommended the building of public works
      to take up the impending slack in employment. And he and
      his associates resolutely set themselves to build up the
      shaken morale of business by proclaiming that everything
      was all right and presently would be still better; that
      "conditions"--as the everlasting reiterated phrase of the
      day went--were "fundamentally sound." "I am convinced that
      through these measures we have reëstablished confidence,"
      said the President in his annual message in December. When
      the year 1930 opened, Secretary Mellon predicted "a revival
      of activity in the spring." "There is nothing in the
      situation to be disturbed about," said Secretary of
      Commerce Lamont in February. . . . "There are grounds for
      assuming that this is about a normal year." In March Mr.
      Lamont was more specific: he predicted that business would
      be normal in two months. A few days later the President
      himself set a definite date for the promised recovery:
      unemployment would be ended in sixty days. On March 16th
      the indefatigable cheer-leader of the Presidential
      optimists, Julius H. Barnes, the head of Mr. Hoover's new
      National Business Survey Conference, spoke as if trouble
      were already a thing of the past. "The spring of 1930,"
      said he, "marks the end of a period of grave concern. . . .
      American business is steadily coming back to a normal level
      of prosperity."
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it seemed as if the Administration would succeed
      not only in preventing drastic and immediate wage cuts, but
      in restoring economic health by applying the formula of
      Doctor Coué. After sinking to a low level at the end of
      1929 and throwing something like three million men upon the
      streets, the industrial indices showed measurable signs of
      improvement. The stock market collected itself and began a
      new advance. Common stocks had not lost their lure; every
      speculator who had not been utterly cleaned out in the
      panic sought eagerly for the hair of the dog that bit him.
      During the first three months of 1930 a Little Bull Market
      gave a very plausible imitation of the Big Bull Market.
      Trading became as heavy as in the golden summer of 1929,
      and the prices of the leading stocks actually regained more
      than half the ground they had lost during the
      <i>débâcle.</i> For a time it seemed as if perhaps the
      hopeful prophets at Washington were right and prosperity
      was coming once more and it would be well to get in on the
      ground floor and make up those dismal losses of 1929.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in April this brief illusion began to sicken and die.
      Business reaction had set in again. By the end of the
      sixty-day period set for recovery by the President and his
      Secretary of Commerce, commodity prices were going down,
      production indices were going down, the stock market was
      taking a series of painful tumbles, and hope deferred was
      making the American heartsick. The Coué formula was
      failing; for the economic disease was more than a temporary
      case of nervous prostration, it was organic and
      deep-seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimly but with a set smile on their faces, the physicians
      at Washington continued to recite their lesson from
      <i>Self-Mastery Through Conscious Auto-Suggestion.</i> They
      had begun their course of treatment with plentiful
      publicity and could not well change the prescription now
      without embarrassment. Early in May Mr. Hoover said he was
      convinced that "we have now passed the worst and with
      continued unity of effort we shall rapidly recover." On May
      8th the governor of the Federal Reserve Board admitted that
      the country was in "what appears to be a business
      depression" <i>("appears to be"</i>--with factories
      shutting down, stocks skidding, and bread-lines stretching
      down the streets!), but that was as far as anybody at
      Washington seemed willing to go in facing the grim reality.
      On May 28th Mr. Hoover was reported as predicting that
      business would be normal by fall. The grim farce went on,
      the physicians uttering soothing words to the patient and
      the patient daily sinking lower and lower--until for a time
      it seemed as if every cheerful pronouncement was followed
      by a fresh collapse. Only when the failure of the treatment
      became obvious to the point of humiliation did the
      Administration lapse into temporary silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the economic diseases from which business was
      suffering? A few of them may be listed categorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Overproduction of capital and goods. During the
      nineteen-twenties, industry had become more mechanized, and
      thus more capable of producing on a huge scale than ever
      before. In the bullish days of 1928 and 1929, when
      installment buying and stock profits were temporarily
      increasing the buying power of the American people,
      innumerable concerns had cheerfully overexpanded; the
      capitalization of the nation's industry had become
      inflated, along with bank credit. When stock profits
      vanished and new installment buyers became harder to find
      and men and women were wondering how they could meet the
      next payment on the car or the radio or the furniture,
      manufacturers were forced to operate their enlarged and
      all-too-productive factories on a reduced and unprofitable
      basis as they waited for buying power to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Artificial commodity prices. During 1929, as David
      Friday has pointed out, the prices of many products had
      been stabilized at high levels by pools. There were pools,
      for example, in copper and cotton; there was a wheat pool
      in Canada, a coffee pool in Brazil, a sugar pool in Cuba, a
      wool pool in Australia. The prices artificially maintained
      by these pools had led to overproduction, which became the
      more dangerous the longer it remained concealed. Stocks of
      these commodities accumulated at a rate out of all
      proportion to consumption; eventually the pools could no
      longer support the markets, and when the inevitable day of
      reckoning came, prices fell disastrously.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A collapse in the price of silver, due partly to the
      efforts of several governments to put themselves on a gold
      basis--with a resulting paralysis to the purchasing power
      of the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The international financial derangement caused by the
      shifting of gold in huge quantities to France and
      particularly to the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Unrest in foreign countries. As the international
      depression deepened, the political and economic dislocation
      caused by the war became newly apparent; the chickens of
      1914-18 were coming home to roost. Revolutions and the
      threat of revolutions in various parts of the world added
      to the general uncertainty and fear, and incidentally
      jeopardized American investments abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The self-generating effect of the depression itself.
      Each bankruptcy, each suspension of payments, and each
      reduction of operating schedules affected other concerns,
      until it seemed almost as if the business world were a set
      of tenpins ready to knock one another over as they fell;
      each employee thrown out of work decreased the potential
      buying power of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally--

      7. The profound psychological reaction from the exuberance
      of 1929. Fundamentally, perhaps, the business cycle is a
      psychological phenomenon. Only when the memory of hard
      times has dimmed can confidence fully establish itself;
      only when confidence has led to outrageous excesses can it
      be checked. It was as difficult for Mr. Hoover to stop the
      psychological pendulum on its down-swing as it had been for
      the Reserve Board to stop it on its up-swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened after the failure of the Hoover campaign of
      optimism makes sad reading. Commodity prices plunged to
      shocking depths. Wheat, for instance: during the last few
      days of 1929, December wheat had brought $1.35 at Chicago;
      a year later it brought only 76 cents. July wheat fell
      during the same interval from $1.37 to 61 cents. Mr.
      Legge's Federal Farm Board was not unmindful of the
      distress throughout the wheat belt caused by this frightful
      decline; having been empowered by law to undertake the task
      of "preventing and controlling surpluses in any
      agricultural commodity," it tried to stabilize prices by
      buying wheat during the most discouraging stages of the
      collapse. But it succeeded chiefly in accumulating
      surpluses; for it came into conflict with a law older than
      the Agricultural Marketing Act--the law of supply and
      demand. When the dust cleared away the Farm Board had
      upward of two hundred million bushels of wheat on its
      hands, yet prices had nevertheless fallen all the way to
      the cellar; and although Mr. Legge's successor claimed that
      the Board's purchases had saved from failure hundreds of
      banks which had loaned money on the wheat crop, that was
      scant comfort to the agonized farmers. A terrific drought
      during the summer of 1930 intensified the prostration of
      many communities. Once more the farm population seemed
      pursued by a malignant fate. They had benefited little from
      Coolidge Prosperity, and now they were the worst sufferers
      of all from the nightmare of 1930-31.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile industrial production was declining steadily. By
      the end of 1930 business had sunk to 28 per cent below
      normal. Stock prices, after rallying slightly during the
      summer of 1930, turned downward once more in September, and
      by December a long series of shudders of liquidation had
      brought the price-level well below the post-panic level of
      the year before. Alas! the poor Bull Market! Radio common,
      which had climbed to such dizzy heights in 1928 and 1929,
      retraced its steps down to--yes, and past--the point at
      which it had begun its sensational advance less than three
      years before; and in many another stock the retreat was
      even longer and less orderly. The drastic shrinkage in
      brokers' loans testified to the number of trading accounts
      closed out unhappily. The broker had ceased to be a man of
      wonderful mystery in the eyes of his acquaintances; he was
      approached nowadays with friendly tact, as one who must not
      be upset by unfortunate references to the market. Several
      brokerage houses tumbled; blue-sky investment companies
      formed during the happy bull-market days went to smash,
      disclosing miserable tales of rascality; over a thousand
      banks caved in during 1930, as a result of the marking down
      both of real estate and of securities; and in December
      occurred the largest bank failure in American financial
      history, the fall of the ill-named Bank of the United
      States in New York. Unemployment grew steadily, until by
      the end of 1930 the number of jobless was figured at
      somewhere in the neighborhood of six million; apple
      salesmen stood on the street corner, executives and clerks
      and factory hands lay awake wondering when they, too, would
      be thrown off, and contributed anxiously to funds for the
      workless; and a stroller on Broadway, seeing a queue
      forming outside a theater where Charlie Chaplin was opening
      in "City Lights," asked in some concern, "What's that--a
      bread-line or a bank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1931 there were faint signs of improvement and the
      deflated stock market took cheer, but by March the
      uncertain dawn was seen to have been false, and throughout
      the spring months the decline was renewed. Production ebbed
      once more; commodity prices fell; stock prices faded until
      the panic levels of November, 1929, looked lofty by
      comparison; and discouragement deepened as dividends were
      reduced or omitted and failures multiplied. Would the
      bottom never be reached?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rosy visions of 1929 had not been utterly effaced: it
      was significant that the numbers of holders of common stock
      in most of the large corporations increased during 1930.
      Investors stubbornly expected the tide to turn some day,
      and they wanted to be there when it happened. Yet the shock
      of the drop into the apparently bottomless pit of
      depression was telling on their nerves. "There are far too
      many people, from businessmen to laborers," declared an
      advertisement inserted in the New York papers by the
      <i>Evening World</i> in December, 1930, "who are giving a
      too eager ear to wild rumors and spiteful gossip tending to
      destroy confidence and create an atmosphere of general
      distrust. The victims of vague fear, on the street and in
      the market place, are a menace to the community. . . . They
      are the feeders of that mob psychology which creates the
      spirit of panic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mob psychology"! There had been mob psychology in the days
      of the Big Bull Market, too. Action and reaction--the
      picture was now complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years earlier, when Mr. Hoover had discussed the
      abolition of poverty, he had prudently added the words
      "with God's help." It must have seemed to him now that God
      had prepared for him a cruelly ironic jest. Mr. Hoover was
      hardly more responsible for the downfall of the business
      hopes of the nineteen-twenties than for the invasion of
      Belgium; yet he who had won renown by administering relief
      to the Belgians had now been called upon to administer
      relief to the Americans, lest the poverty of which he had
      once spoken so lightly make tragic inroads among them. He
      was an able economist and an able leader of men in public
      crises; yet his attempts to lead business out of depression
      had come to conspicuous failure. Other businessmen of wide
      experience had been as unconvinced as he that the deflation
      would have to be prolonged and painful; yet when business
      was on the road to ruin, these men forgot their own former
      optimism and blamed the President for lack of foresight,
      lack of leadership, lack of even elementary common sense.
      They had not been forced to put themselves unforgettably on
      record; he had. They were not expected to reintroduce
      prosperity; he was. By the spring of 1931 the President's
      reputation had declined along with prices and profits to a
      new low level, and the Democrats, cheered by striking gains
      in the November elections, were casting a hopeful eye
      toward 1932. Observing the plight of Mr. Hoover, Calvin
      Coolidge, syndicating two hundred daily words of mingled
      hard sense and soft soap from his secure haven at
      Northampton, must have thanked Heaven that he had not
      chosen to run for President in 1928; and Governor Smith
      must have felt like the man who just missed the train which
      went off the end of the open drawbridge. Doubtless the
      Administration's campaign of optimism had been overzealous,
      but Mr. Hoover's greatest mistake had been in getting
      himself elected for the 1928-32 term.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that what had taken place since the Big Bull
      Market was more than a cyclical drop in prices and
      production; it was a major change in the national economy.
      There were encouraging signs even when things were at their
      worst: the absence of serious conflict between capital and
      labor, for instance, and the ability of the Federal Reserve
      System to prevent a money panic even when banks were
      toppling. Doubtless prosperity was due ultimately to return
      in full flood. But it could not be the same sort of
      prosperity as in the nineteen-twenties: inevitably it would
      rest on different bases, favor different industries, and
      arouse different forms of enthusiasm and hysteria. The
      panic had written <i>finis</i> to a chapter of American
      economic history.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There were other signs of change, too, as the
      nineteen-thirties began. Some of them had begun long before
      the panic; others developed some time after it; but taken
      together they revealed striking alterations in the national
      temper and the ways of American life.
    </p>

      One could hardly walk a block in any American city or town
      without noticing some of them. The women's clothes, for
      instance. The skirt length had come down with stock prices.
      Dresses for daytime wear were longer, if only by a few
      inches; evening dresses swept the ground. Defenders of the
      knee-length skirt had split the air with their protests,
      but the new styles had won out. Bobbed hair was
      progressively losing favor. Frills, ruffles, and flounces
      were coming in again, and the corset manufacturers were
      once more learning to smile. A measure of formality was
      gradually returning: witness the long white gloves, the
      masculine silk hats and swallow-tail coats. Nor did these
      changes follow any mere whim of manufacturers and stylists.
      Manufacturers and stylists may issue decrees, but not
      unless the public is willing to follow does the fashion
      actually change. Did not the clothing business try to bring
      back the long skirt early in the nineteen-twenties, but
      without success? The long skirts and draperies and white
      gloves of 1930 and 1931 were the outward signs of a subtle
      change in the relations between the sexes. No longer was it
      the American woman's dearest ambition to simulate a
      flat-breasted, spindle-legged, carefree, knowing adolescent
      in a long-waisted child's frock. The red-hot baby had gone
      out of style. Fashion advertisements in 1930 and 1931
      depicted a different type, more graceful, more piquant,
      more subtly alluring; decorum and romance began to come
      once more within the range of possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the fashions suggested was borne out by a variety of
      other evidence. The Revolution in Manners and Morals had at
      least reached an armistice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that there was any general return to the old
      conventions which had been overthrown in the
      nineteen-twenties. The freedom so desperately won by the
      flappers of the now graying "younger generation" had not
      been lost, and it was difficult to detect much real change
      in the uses to which this freedom was put. What had
      departed was the excited sense that taboos were going to
      smash, that morals were being made over or annihilated, and
      that the whole code of behavior was in flux. The wages of
      sin had become stabilized at a lower level. Gone, too, at
      least in some degree, was that hysterical preoccupation
      with sex which had characterized the Post-war Decade. Books
      about sex and conversation about sex were among the
      commodities suffering from overproduction. Robert Benchley
      expressed a widely prevalent opinion when he wrote in his
      dramatic page in the <i>New Yorker,</i> late in 1930, "I am
      now definitely ready to announce that Sex, as a theatrical
      property, is as tiresome as the Old Mortgage, and that I
      don't want to hear it mentioned ever again--I am sick of
      rebellious youth and I am sick of Victorian parents and I
      don't care if all the little girls in all sections of the
      United States get ruined or want to get ruined or keep from
      getting ruined. All I ask is: don't write plays about it
      and ask me to sit through them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently a great many playgoers and readers were
      beginning to feel as Mr. Benchley did. George Jean Nathan
      noted the arrival on Broadway of a new crop of romantic and
      poetic playwrights, and reported that "the hard-boiled
      school of drama and literature . . . is all too evidently
      on the wane." Henry Seidel Canby, writing in the
      <i>Saturday Review of Literature,</i> came to the same
      conclusion. Reticence had returned from exile; indeed, even
      before the Post-war Decade closed, "Journey's End," which
      managed to make war real without the wholesale introduction
      of profanity or prostitutes, had been applauded with
      something like relief. The contrast between "Journey's End"
      and "What Price Glory?" was suggestive of the change in the
      popular temper. The success of such novels as <i>The Good
      Companions, Angel Pavement,</i> and <i>The
      Water-Gypsies</i> was perhaps a further indication of the
      change. There were enough exceptions to the rule to remind
      one that easy generalizations are dangerous, but two
      conclusions seemed almost inescapable: sex was no longer
      front-page news, and glamour was coming into its own again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, for that matter, were people quite so positive now
      that every manifestation of Victorianism and of the
      eighteen-nineties was to be laughed at uproariously by
      "moderns." Collectors were beginning to look with less
      scornful eyes upon Victorian furniture, and people who had
      read <i>The Mauve Decade</i> and the debunking biographies
      with an air of condescension toward pre-war conventions
      found themselves looking with wistful eyes, only a few
      years later, at William Gillette's revival of "Sherlock
      Holmes" and at the sentimentalization of the 'nineties in
      "Sweet Adeline."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people of the early nineteen-thirties presumably
      knew just as much about life as those of the early and
      middle twenties, but they were less conspicuously and
      self-consciously intent upon showing the world what
      advanced young devils they were. LaMar Warrick, who taught
      at a large Middle Western university, reported in
      <i>Harper's</i> in the autumn of 1930 that the biological
      novels of Aldous Huxley, the biological psychology of John
      B. Watson, and the biological philosophies of Bertrand
      Russell were "fast becoming . . . out of date" among the
      students in her classes. She found the new younger
      generation tiring of what one of these students called "a
      modernism which leaves you washed out and cynical at
      thirty." A staff reporter for the <i>Des Moines Sunday
      Register</i> queried professors and undergraduates at three
      colleges in Iowa as to the validity of Mrs. Warrick's
      contentions, and an impressive majority of those with whom
      he talked told him that what she had said held true in Iowa
      as well as in Illinois. One young Iowan remarked that at
      his college there was not now a single "Flaming Mamie" who
      could be compared with "the girls who five years ago were
      wearing leopard-skin coats, driving expensive roadsters,
      and generally raising hell." That hell-raising was actually
      on the decline seemed almost too much to expect of
      inflammable human nature; but at least the burden of
      testimony suggested that ostentatious hell-raising was not
      quite so certain a way to social renown as in the heyday of
      flapperism.

      The Revolt of the Highbrows had spent its force. The voice
      of H. L. Mencken no longer shook the country from
      Provincetown to Hollywood, and people who were always
      denouncing George F. Babbitt and the dangers of
      standardization were beginning to seem a little tiresome.
      Many of the once distraught intellectuals were now
      wondering if life was such a ghastly farce as they had
      supposed. The philosophical and literary theme of futility
      had been almost played out. Even Hemingway, whom the young
      <i>émigrés</i> to Montparnasse in 1926 or thereabouts had
      hailed as a major prophet of the emptiness of everything,
      struck a new note, almost a romantic note, in his
      <i>Farewell to Arms,</i> published late in 1929; this novel
      told the story not of a series of shallow and fleeting
      passions, but of a great love which possessed the very
      values of whose future Joseph Wood Krutch had despaired.
      Lewis Mumford declared in 1931 that Mr. Krutch should have
      realized that civilization had merely been molting a dead
      skin, not going into dissolution; speaking for the young
      intellectuals of the nineteen-thirties, Mr. Mumford
      announced that "the mood of defeat is dead. We have not yet
      hauled down our flag, because, like Whitman's Little
      Captain, we can still say collectively, <i>We have not yet
      begun to fight."</i> Here again, easy generalizations are
      dangerous; yet one doubts if any representative of the
      intelligentsia could have spoken of fighting in 1925 and
      felt that he was representing the opinion of his up-to-date
      contemporaries. The fashionable posture in 1925 had not
      been belligerent; it had been the posture of graceful
      acquiescence in defeat. Now the mood of intellectual
      disillusionment was passing; the garment of hopeless
      resignation began to look a little worn at the elbows.
    </p>

      Whether religion was regaining any of its lost prestige was
      doubtful. The net gain in membership of all the churches in
      the United States was only a trifle over one-tenth of one
      per cent in 1930--the smallest gain since Dr. H. K. Carroll
      began his annual compilation in 1890. But at least the
      religious scene had changed. The Fundamentalists and
      Modernists were tiring of their battle. Dayton had become
      ancient history. The voice of science no longer seemed to
      deny so loudly and authoritatively the existence of
      spiritual values in the universe; and when readers of
      Eddington and Jeans concluded that there was a crack in the
      airtight system of scientific materialism after all, and
      the modernist clergy hastened to report that the crack was
      wide enough to admit God, their assertion attracted less
      excited rebuttal than formerly, if only because the new
      scientific philosophies were too hard to understand and the
      argument had been going on for so many weary years. The
      voice of psychology, once so deafening and bewildering, had
      especially lost authority; it was evident that neither
      Freud nor Watson had infallible answers for all the
      problems of humanity, and that the psychologists were no
      more united than the Democrats. Those who watched the
      religious life of the colleges as the nineteen-twenties
      gave way to the nineteen-thirties doubted if the ranks of
      the agnostics were decreasing, but found, nevertheless, a
      change in the general attitude: fewer young men and women
      bristled with hostility toward any and all religion, and
      there was a more widespread desire, even among the
      doubters, to find some ground for a positive and fruitful
      interpretation of life. What was true of the colleges was
      presumably true of the country as a whole: although the
      churches were hardly gaining ground, neither perhaps, was
      religion losing it. Like manners and morals, religion
      showed signs of stabilization on a different basis. Whether
      the change was more than temporary remained to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great American public was just as susceptible to fads
      as ever. Since the panicky autumn of 1929, millions of
      radios had resounded every evening at seven o'clock with
      the voices of Freeman F. Gosden and Charles J. Correll,
      better known as Amos 'n' Andy; "I'se regusted" and "Check
      and double check" had made their way into the common
      speech, and Andy's troubles with the lunchroom and Madam
      Queen had become only less real to the national mind than
      the vicissitudes of business and the stock market. In
      September, 1930, the Department of Commerce had found at
      least one thoroughly prosperous business statistic to
      announce: there were almost 30,000 miniature golf courses
      in operation, representing an investment of $125,000,000,
      and many of them were earning 300 per cent a month. If the
      American people were buying nothing else in the summer of
      1930, they were at least buying the right to putt a golf
      ball over a surface of crushed cottonseed and through a tin
      pipe.
    </p>

      Yet the noble art of ballyhoo, which had flourished so
      successfully in the nineteen-twenties, had lost something
      of its vigor. Admiral Byrd's flight to the South Pole made
      him a hero second only to Lindbergh in the eyes of the
      country at large, but in the larger centers of population
      there was manifest a slight tendency to yawn: his exploit
      had been over-publicized, and heroism, however gallant,
      lost something of its spontaneous charm when it was
      subjected to scientific management and syndicated in daily
      dispatches. A few months after Byrd reached the South Pole,
      Coste and Bellonte made the first completely successful
      non-stop westward flight across the Atlantic; yet at the
      end of 1930 it was probable that fewer Americans could have
      identified the names of Coste and Bellonte than the name of
      Ruth Elder. Heroism in the air was commonplace by this
      time. Endurance flyers still circled about day after day in
      quest of new records, but they were finding the crowds more
      sparse and the profits in headlines and in cash less
      impressive. As for Shipwreck Kelly, premier flagpole sitter
      of the nineteen-twenties, he was reported to have descended
      from the summit of the Paramount Building in 1930 because
      no one seemed to be watching. Bathing-beauty contests?
      Something had happened to them, too. Atlantic City had
      given up its annual beauty pageant in 1927. And in all 1930
      there was not one first-class murder trial of nation-wide
      interest, not one first-class prize-fight, not one great
      new sporting hero crowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, a sporting era was passing. Rickard, who had known
      how to surround two heavyweight fighters with a
      two-and-a-half-million-dollar crowd, was dead; pugilism had
      fallen again into shady repute. Dempsey was in retirement.
      Tunney was reading Shakespeare. Ruth still hammered out
      home runs, but Jones and Tilden had both turned
      professional, and Knute Rockne, the greatest football coach
      of the nineteen-twenties, had been killed in an airplane
      accident, to the official regret of the President of the
      United States. With the passing of Grover Whalen to the
      aisles of Wanamaker's, New York City, the fountain-head of
      ballyhoo, had lost some of its lavish taste for welcoming
      heroes to the Western Hemisphere; the precipitation of
      ticker tape and torn-up telephone books in lower Broadway
      in 1930 was the smallest in years. Perhaps hard times were
      responsible for the decline of the hero racket. But perhaps
      there was more to it than that. The ballyhoo technique
      possessed no longer the freshness of youth. Times had
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The post-war apathy toward politics and everything
      political continued apparently undiminished. In the autumn
      of 1929, when Ramsay MacDonald came to America with a
      message of peace and good will strikingly reminiscent of
      the preachments of Woodrow Wilson, he was received with
      astonishing enthusiasm, and for a time it seemed as if
      idealism were about to manifest itself once more as in the
      days before the coming of complacent normalcy. The mood
      persisted long enough for the London Treaty for renewed
      limitation of naval armaments to pass the Senate with
      flying colors, much to the credit of President Hoover and
      Secretary Stimson; otherwise, however, cynicism and
      hopelessness still prevailed. Chicago threw out the
      notorious Thompson and the Tammany scandals in New York
      City aroused some resentment; but the general attitude as
      the summer of 1931 approached still seemed to be "What's
      the use of trying to do anything about it?" and the
      racketeer still flourished like a hardy weed, as did the
      bootlegger, the rumrunner, and the prohibition issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the country still expected as little as ever of
      politics and politicians, and still submitted to the rule
      of the gangster, at least it was somewhat less satisfied
      with <i>laissez-faire</i> for business than in the days of
      Calvin Coolidge. The public attitude during the depression
      of 1930-31 presented an instructive contrast with that
      during previous depressions. The radical on the soap-box
      was far less terrifying than in the days of the Big Red
      Scare. Communist propaganda made amazingly little headway,
      all things considered, and attracted amazingly little
      attention; for one reason, perhaps, because many of the
      largest employers met the crisis with far-sighted
      intelligence, maintaining the wage-rate wherever possible
      and reducing hours rather than throwing off employees; for
      another reason, because during the Big Bull Market
      innumerable potential radicals had received from the
      stock-market page a conservative financial education.
      Naturally, however, there was a general sense that
      something had gone wrong with individualistic capitalism
      and must be set right--how could it be otherwise, with the
      existing system dragging millions of families down toward
      hunger and want?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a new interest in the Russian experiment, not
      unmixed with sober fear. Maurice Hindus's <i>Humanity
      Uprooted,</i> which had come out during the month of the
      panic and had sold very slowly at first, became a best
      seller during the gloomy autumn of 1930. In the summer of
      1929 Russia had seemed as remote as China; in 1931, with
      breadlines on the streets, the Russian Five-Year Plan
      became a topic of anxious American interest. The longer the
      paralysis of industry lasted--and how it lasted!--the more
      urgent became the demand for some measure of American
      economic planning which might prevent such disasters from
      recurring, without handing over undue power to an
      incompetent or venal bureaucracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the return of full prosperity this demand would
      doubtless weaken; nevertheless the inevitable slow drift
      toward collectivism, interrupted during the bumptiously
      successful nineteen-twenties, promised to be haltingly
      resumed once more. Despite the obvious distaste of the
      country for state socialism or anything suggesting it,
      there was no denying that the economic system had proved
      itself too complex, and machine production too powerful, to
      continue unbridled. The chief difficulty, perhaps, was to
      find any persons or groups wise enough to know how to apply
      the bridle and persuasive enough to be allowed to keep
      their grip upon it. The experience of the past few years
      had given no very convincing evidence of the ability of
      financiers or economists to diagnose the condition of the
      country's business, or of the emotional public to respond
      to treatment. Yet there stood the problem, a problem hardly
      dreamed of by most Americans when Coolidge Prosperity was
      blooming; and as 1931 dragged along, month after month,
      without any immediate promise of business revival, no other
      problem seemed to the country half so vital or so pressing.

      Many of these specific signs of change were of uncertain
      significance; possibly some of them were illusory. Yet the
      United States of 1931 was a different place from the United
      States of the Post-war Decade; there was no denying that.
      An old order was giving place to new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the mists of distance would soften the outlines of the
      nineteen-twenties, and men and women, looking over the
      pages of a book such as this, would smile at the memory of
      those charming, crazy days when the radio was a thrilling
      novelty, and girls wore bobbed hair and knee-length skirts,
      and a trans-Atlantic flyer became a god overnight, and
      common stocks were about to bring us all to a lavish
      Utopia. They would forget, perhaps, the frustrated hopes
      that followed the war, the aching disillusionment of the
      hard-boiled era, its oily scandals, its spiritual
      paralysis, the harshness of its gaiety; they would talk
      about the good old days. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to come in the nineteen-thirties?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one thing could one be sure of. It would not be
      repetition. The stream of time often doubles on its course,
      but always it makes for itself a new channel.

      SOURCES AND OBLIGATIONS

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I am under an immense debt to certain writers upon whose
      books I have drawn extensively in this chronicle. Naturally
      I have made frequent use, not only in Chapter Five, but
      elsewhere, of the extraordinarily varied and precise
      information collected in <i>Middletown,</i> that remarkable
      sociological study of an American city by Robert S. Lynd
      and Helen Merrell Lynd; I do not see how any conscientious
      historian of the Postwar Decade could afford to neglect
      this mine of material. The concluding chapters of <i>The
      Rise of American Civilization,</i> by Charles A. Beard and
      Mary R. Beard, have been helpful at many points,
      particularly in the preparation of my short account of the
      Washington Conference and the situation which led up to it.
      William Allen White's biography of Woodrow Wilson and his
      extended portraits of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge
      in <i>Masks in a Pageant</i> have been especially useful
      not only for the specific information which they contain,
      but also for their suggestive interpretations of these
      three Presidents. To Charles Merz I am indebted for many
      facts and conclusions about the prohibition experiment,
      which I have drawn from <i>The Dry Decade,</i> his
      admirably impartial account of the first ten years of
      prohibition; and also for other facts assembled by him in
      his other books, <i>And Then Came Ford</i> and <i>The Great
      American Bandwagon.</i> Finally, I have made constant use
      of the <i>World Almanac,</i> which is responsible for many
      of the statistics embodied in this volume; of the <i>New
      York Times Index;</i> and above all of the files of the
      <i>New York Times</i> itself in the New York Public
      Library. A book of this sort must inevitably rely very
      largely on contemporary newspaper and magazine sources; the
      newspapers are invaluable not only for their news accounts
      of important events, but also for the light which their
      advertising columns and picture sections throw upon the
      fashions, ideas, and general atmosphere of the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account of the beginnings of radio broadcasting in
      Chapters One and Four is based partly upon an address given
      on April 21, 1928, by H. P. Davis, vice-president of the
      Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, before the
      Harvard Business School.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preparation of Chapter Two ("Back to Normalcy"), I
      found Ray Stannard Baker's <i>Woodrow Wilson and World
      Settlement</i> especially valuable for its exhaustive
      account of Wilson's part in the Peace Conference. Mr.
      Baker's findings have of course been compared with those of
      Colonel House, Secretary Lansing, and others. Lodge's
      secret memorandum to Henry White was disclosed in Allan
      Nevins's biography of White. The description of Woodrow
      Wilson in the last days of his life is based on a personal
      visit to him in November, 1923.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapter Three ("The Big Red Scare"), I owe many of the
      facts about the Palmer raids to the account in Zechariah
      Chafee's <i>Freedom of Speech.</i> Senator Husting's pledge
      was quoted on the cover of the <i>New Republic</i> at the
      time of the coal strike of 1919. Much of the material about
      the super-patriots is derived from a series of articles
      contributed to the <i>New Republic</i> in 1924 by Sidney
      Howard. The account of the Chicago race-riot is based on
      the careful study embodied in Charles S. Johnson's <i>The
      Negro in Chicago;</i> and the account of the Wall Street
      explosion contains many facts from an article by Sidney
      Sutherland in <i>Liberty</i> for April 26, 1930.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapter Four ("America Convalescent") the facts cited
      about the Sacco-Vanzetti propaganda came largely from a
      series of contemporary news stories in the <i>New York
      World.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapter Five ("The Revolution in Manners and Morals") draws
      freely upon <i>Middletown,</i> as previously stated; upon
      Professor Paul H. Nystrom's <i>Economics of Fashion;</i>
      and upon Walter Lippmann's <i>A Preface to Morals</i> and
      Joseph Wood Krutch's <i>The Modern Temper.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing Chapter Six ("Harding and the Scandals") I have
      made much use of White's <i>Masks in a Pageant</i> and
      Beard's <i>The Rise of American Civilization,</i> as stated
      above; of M. E. Ravage's <i>The Story of Teapot Dome,</i> a
      lively account of the progress of the oil cases up to 1924;
      and of Bruce Bliven's series of articles on the Ohio Gang
      in the <i>New Republic.</i> The quotation from Harry M.
      Daugherty which appears at the beginning of the chapter is
      printed as arranged and repunctuated by Mr. Bliven in one
      of his <i>New Republic</i> articles. George G. Chandler of
      the Philadelphia law firm of Montgomery &amp; MacCracken
      gave me valuable help in connection with the account of the
      oil scandals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapter Seven ("Coolidge Prosperity") is based in
      considerable degree upon the facts and generalizations in
      Stuart Chase's concise book, <i>Prosperity, Fact or
      Myth,</i> and also cites numerous figures drawn from
      <i>Recent Economic Changes.</i> The sections on the
      supersalesmen and on religion and business embody a
      quantity of material set forth by that able student of the
      ways of businessmen, Jesse Rainsford Sprague, in various
      articles in <i>Harper's Magazine.</i> Some of the data
      about the service clubs I owe to Charles W. Ferguson, who
      gathered them in the preparation of his forthcoming book,
      <i>The Joiners;</i> some of the facts about business
      courses and business methods in the universities come from
      Abraham Flexner's <i>Universities: American, English,
      German.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic idea of Chapter Eight ("The Ballyhoo Years") is
      Silas Bent's, as any reader of his book, <i>Ballyhoo,</i>
      will be aware. I have taken many facts from that book. The
      statistical data on the status of religion during the
      decade are drawn from the "Preliminary Report on Organized
      Religion for the President's Study of Social Trends," by C.
      Luther Fry, to which Robert S. Lynd was good enough to give
      me access. The account of the Dayton trial makes
      considerable use of Arthur Garfield Hays's narrative in
      <i>Let Freedom Ring.</i> Richard F. Simon, of Simon &amp;
      Schuster, provided me with much material about the
      cross-word-puzzle craze, and W. B. Miller, formerly of the
      <i>Louisville Courier-Journal,</i> told me at first hand
      the story of the Floyd Collins episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am under special obligation both to Walter Lippmann's
      <i>A Preface to Morals</i> and to Joseph Wood Krutch's
      <i>The Modern Temper</i> for their remarkable analyses of
      disillusionment in the nineteen-twenties; the discussion of
      disillusionment in Chapter Nine ("The Revolt of the
      Highbrows") could never have been written without the aid
      of Mr. Krutch's penetrating book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapter Ten ("Alcohol and Al Capone") makes especially
      lavish use of four sources: Charles Merz's <i>The Dry
      Decade,</i> the Wickersham Report, Fred D. Pasley's
      fascinating <i>Al Capone,</i> and <i>It's a Racket,</i> by
      Gordon L. Hostetter and Thomas Quinn Beesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many figures and incidents and the quotation from Walter C.
      Hill in Chapter Eleven ("Home, Sweet Florida") are from two
      articles by Homer B. Vanderblue in the <i>Journal of Land
      and Public Utility Economics,</i> Volume 3. Among other
      sources, Gertrude Mathews Shelby's "Florida Frenzy" in
      <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for January, 1926, was especially
      valuable. The data about rentals of New York City office
      space were given me by the real-estate officer of a large
      local financial institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapter Thirteen ("Crash!") I have cited a number of
      facts set forth by Richard Whitney in an address on "The
      Work of the New York Stock Exchange in the Panic of 1929,"
      given before the Boston Association of Stock Exchange Firms
      on June 10, 1930.
    </p>
    <p>
      The optimistic statements by leaders of the Hoover
      Administration, cited in the last chapter ("Aftermath"),
      were collected in an article by James Truslow Adams
      ("Presidential Prosperity") in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for
      August, 1930.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are only a few of the innumerable sources drawn upon
      in the book; I single them out for mention only because
      they are not cited in the text or because my debt to them
      is especially large.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am exceedingly grateful to numerous friends who have been
      kind enough either to hunt up material for me or to take
      the time to read and criticize parts of the manuscript;
      particularly to Rollin Alger Sawyer of the New York Public
      Library, Arthur Besse, John G. MacKenty, Earle Bailie, C.
      Alison Scully, Myra Richardson, Gordon Aymar, Agnes Rogers
      Hyde, Stuart Chase, Robert K. Haas, Arthur C. Holden, and
      Emily Linnard Cobb. I must especially thank Charles Merz
      for encouraging me, at the outset, to undertake what has
      proved an endlessly fascinating task. And finally I must
      record the fact that up to the time of her death, my wife,
      Dorothy Penrose Allen, helped me more than I can ever
      acknowledge.
