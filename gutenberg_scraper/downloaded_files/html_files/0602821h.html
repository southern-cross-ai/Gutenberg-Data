  <h1>The Bride</h1>

  <h4>by</h4>

  <h2>M.P. Shiel</h2>


  <h3>First published in <i>The English Illustrated Magazine</i>, May 1902<br>
  This e-book edition: Project Gutenberg Australia, 2014</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><i>"He shall not see the rivers, the floods,<br>
  the brooks of honey and butter"</i>&mdash;Job.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THEY met at Krupp and Mason's, musical-instrument-makers, of
  Little Britain, E.C., where Walter had been employed two years, and then came
  Annie to typewrite, and be serviceable.</p>

  <p>They began to "go out" together after six o'clock; and when Mrs. Evans,
  Annie's mamma, lost her lodger, Annie mentioned it, and Walter went to live
  with them at No. 13 Culford Road, N.; by which time Annie and Walter might
  almost be said to have been engaged. His salary, however, was only thirty
  shillings a week.</p>

  <p>He was the thorough Cockney, Walter; a well-set-up person of thirty,
  strong-shouldered, with a square brow, a moustache, and black acne-specks in
  his nose and pale face.</p>

  <p>It was on the night of his arrival at No. 13, that he for the first time
  saw Rachel, Annie's younger sister. Both girls, in fact, were named
  "Rachel"&mdash;after a much-mourned mother of Mrs.</p>

  <p>Evans'; but Annie Rachel was called "Annie," and Mary Rachel was called
  "Rachel." Rachel helped Walter at the handle of his box to the top-back room,
  and here, in the lamplight he was able to see that she was a tallish girl,
  with hair almost black, and with a sprinkling of freckles on her very white,
  thin nose, on the tip of which stood collected, usually, some little sweats.
  She was thin-faced, and her top teeth projected a little so that her lips
  only closed with effort, she not so pretty as pink-and-white little Annie,
  though one could guess, at a glance, that she was a person more to be
  respected.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of him?" said Annie, meeting Rachel as she came
  down.</p>

  <p>"He seems a nice fellow," Rachel said: "rather goodlooking. And strong in
  the back, you bet."</p>

  <p>Walter spent that evening with them in the area front-room, smoking a foul
  bulldog pipe, which slushed and gurgled to his suction; and at once Mrs.
  Evans, a dark old lady without waist, all sighs and lack of breath, decided
  that he was "a gentlemanly, decent fellow." When bed-time came he made the
  proposal to lead them in prayer; and to this they submitted, Annie having
  forewarned them that he was "a Christian." As he climbed to his room, the
  devoted girl found an excuse to slip out after him, and in the passage of the
  first floor there was a little kiss.</p>

  <p>"Only one," she said, with an uplifted finger.</p>

  <p>"And what about his little brother, then?" he chuckled&mdash;a chuckle
  with which all his jokes were accompanied: a kind of guttural chuckle, which
  seemed to descend or stick straining in the throat, instead of rising to the
  lips.</p>

  <p>"You go on," she said playfully, tapped his cheek, and ran down. So Walter
  slept for the first night at Mrs. Evans'.</p>

  <p>On the whole, as time passed, he had a good deal of the society of the
  women: for the theatre was a thing abominable to him, and in the evenings he
  stayed in the underground parlour, sharing the bread-and-cheese supper, and
  growing familiar with the sighs of Mrs. Evans over her once estate in the
  world. Rachel, the silent, sewed; Annie, whose relation with Walter was still
  unannounced, though perhaps guessed, could play hymn-tunes on the old piano,
  and she played.</p>

  <p>Last of all, Walter laid down the inveterate wet pipe, led them in prayer,
  and went to bed. Most mornings he and Annie set out together for Little
  Britain.</p>

  <p>There came a day when he confided to her his intention to ask for a rise
  of "screw," and when this was actually promised by His Terror, the Boss,
  there was joy in heaven, and radiance in futurity, and secret talks of rings,
  a wedding, "a Home." Annie felt herself not far from the kingdom of Hymen,
  and rejoiced. But nothing, as yet, was said at No. 13: for to Mrs. Evans'
  past grandeurs thirty shillings a week was felt to be inappropriate.</p>

  <p>The nest Sunday, however, soon after dinner, this strangeness occurred:
  Rachel, the silent, disappeared. Mrs. Evans called for her, Annie called, but
  it was found that she was not in the house, though the putting away of the
  dinner-things, her usual task, was only half accomplished.</p>

  <p>Not till tea-time did Rachel return. She was then cold, and somewhat
  sullen, and somewhat pale, her lips closing firmly over her projecting teeth.
  When timidly questioned&mdash;for her resentment was greatly
  feared&mdash;-she replied that she had just been looking in upon Alice
  Soulsby, a few squares away, for a little chat: and this was the truth.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, the whole truth; she had also looked in at the Church
  Lane Sunday School on her way: and this fact she guiltily concealed. For half
  an hour she had sat darkly at the end of the building in a corner, listening
  to the "address." This address was delivered by Walter. To this school every
  Sunday, after dinner, he put down the beloved pipe to go. He was in fact, its
  "superintendent."</p>

  <p>After this, the tone and temper of the little household rapidly changed,
  and a true element of hell was introduced into its platitude. It became,
  first of all, a question whether or not Rachel could be "experiencing
  religion," a thing which her mother and Annie had never dreamt of expecting
  of her. Praying people, and the Salvationist, had always been the contempt of
  her strong and callous mind. But on Sunday nights she was now observed to go
  out alone, and "chapel" was the explanation which she coolly gave. Which
  chapel she did not specify: but in reality it was the Newton Street Hall, at
  which Walter frequently exhorted and "prayed." In the Church Lane schoolroom
  there was prayer-meeting on Thursday evenings; and twice within one month
  Rachel sallied forth on Thursday evening&mdash;soon after Walter. The secret
  disease which preyed upon the poor girl could hardly now be concealed. At
  first she suffered bitter, solitary shame; sobbed in a hundred paroxysms;
  hoped to draw a veil over her infirmity. But her gash was too glaring. In the
  long Sabbath evenings of summer he preached at street corners, and sometimes
  secretly, sometimes openly, Rachel would attend these meetings, singing
  meekly with the rest the undivine hymns of the modern evangelist. In his
  presence, in the parlour, on other nights, she quietly sewed, hardly
  speaking. When, at 7 p.m., she heard his key in the front door her heart
  darted toward its master; when in the morning he flew away to business her
  universe was cinders.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder to me what's coming to our Rachel lately," said Annie in
  the train, coming home; "you're doing her soul good, or something, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He chuckled, with slushy suction-sounds about the back of the tongue and
  molars.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that be jiggered for a tale!" he said: "she's all right."</p>

  <p>"I know her better than you, you see. She's quite changed&mdash;-since
  you've come. Looks to me as if she's having a touch of the blues, or
  something."</p>

  <p>"Poor thing! She wants looking after, don't she?" Annie laughed, too: but
  less brutally, more uneasily. Walter said: "But she oughtn't to have the
  blues, if she's giving her heart to the Lord!</p>

  <p>"People seem to think a Christian must be this and that. A Christian, if
  it comes to that, ought to be the jolliest fellow going!"</p>

  <p>This was on a Thursday, the night of the Church Lane prayer-meeting, and
  Walter had only time to rush in at No. 13, wash his face, snatch his Bible,
  and be off. Rachel, for her part, must verily now have been badly bitten with
  the rabies of love, or she would have felt that to follow to-night, for the
  third time lately, could not fail to incur remark. But this consideration
  never even entered a mind now completely blinded and entranced by the
  personality of Walter.</p>

  <p>Through the day her work about the house had been rushed forward with this
  very object, and at the moment when he banged the door after him she was
  before her glass, dressing in blanched, intense and trembling flurry, and
  casting as she bent to give the last touches to her fringe, a look of
  bitterest hate at the projection of her lip above the teeth.</p>

  <p>This night, for the first time, she waited in the chapel till the end of
  the service, and walked slowly homeward on the way which she knew that Walter
  would take; and he came striding presently, that morocco Bible in his hand,
  nearly every passage in which was neatly under-ruled in black and red
  inks.</p>

  <p>"What, is that you?" he said, taking into his a hand cold with sweat.</p>

  <p>"It is," she answered, in a hard, formal tone.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say you've been to the meeting?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"Why, where were my eyes? I didn't see you."</p>

  <p>"It isn't likely that you would want to, Mr. Teeger."</p>

  <p>"Go on&mdash;drop that! What do you take me for? I'm only too glad! And I
  tell you what it is, Miss Rachel, I say to you as the Lord Jesus said to the
  young man: 'Thou art not far from the kingdom of heaven.'"</p>

  <p>She was in it!&mdash;near him, alone, in a darkling square, yet suffering,
  too, in the flames of a passion such as perhaps consumes only the strongest
  natures.</p>

  <p>She caught for support at his unoffered arm; and when he bent his steps
  straight homeward, she said trembling violently: "I don't wish to go home as
  yet. I wish to have a little walk. Do you mind, Mr. Teeger?"</p>

  <p>"Mind, no. Come along, then," and they went walking among an intricacy of
  streets and squares, he talking of "the Work," and of common subjects. After
  half an hour, she was saying:</p>

  <p>"I often wish I was a man. A man can say and do what he likes; but with a
  girl it's different."</p>

  <p>"There's you, now, Mr. Teeger, always out and about, having people
  listening to you, and that. I often wish I was only a man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, it all depends how you look at it," he said. "And, look here,
  you may as well call me Walter and be done."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shouldn't think of that," she replied. "Not till&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her hand trembled on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Well, out with it, why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Till&mdash;till we know something more definite about you&mdash;-and
  Annie."</p>

  <p>He chuckled slushily, she now leading him fleetly round and round a
  square.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you girls again!" he cried, "been blabbing again like all the girls!
  It takes a bright man to hide much from them, don't it?"</p>

  <p>"But there isn't much to hide in this case, as far as I can see&mdash;is
  there?"</p>

  <p>Always Walter laughed, straining deep in the throat. He said: "Oh,
  come&mdash;that would be telling, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>After a minute's stillness, this treacherous phrase came from Rachel:
  "Annie doesn't care for anyone, Mr. Teeger."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come&mdash;that's rather a tall order, any one. She's all right."</p>

  <p>"But she doesn't. Of course, most girls are silly, and that, and like to
  get married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's only nature, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>This was a joke; and downward the laugh strained in his throat, like
  struggling phlegm.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they don't understand what love is," said Rachel.</p>

  <p>"They haven't an idea. They like to be married women, and have a husband,
  and that. But they don't know what love is&mdash;-believe me! The men don't
  either." How she trembled!&mdash;her body, her dying voice&mdash;she pressing
  heavily upon him, while the moon triumphed now through cloud glaring a moment
  white on the lunacy of her ghostly face.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know&mdash;I think I understand, lass, what it is," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"You don't, Mr. Teeger!"</p>

  <p>"How's that, then?"</p>

  <p>"Because, when it takes you, it makes you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, let's have it. You seem to know all about it."</p>

  <p>Now Rachel commenced to tell him what "it" was&mdash;in frenzied
  definitions, and a power of expression strange for her. It was a lunacy, its
  name was Legion, it was possession by the furies; it was a spasm in the
  throat, and a sickness of the limbs, and a yearning of the eye-whites, and a
  fire in the marrow; it was catalepsy, trance, apocalypse; it was high as the
  galaxy, it was addicted to the gutter; it was Vesuvius, borealis, the sunset;
  it was the rainbow in a cesspool, St. John plus Heliogabalus, Beatrice plus
  Messalina; it was a transfiguration, and a leprosy, and a metempsychosis, and
  a neurosis; it was the dance of the mænads, and the bite of the tarantula,
  and baptism in a sun: out poured the wild definition in simple words, but
  with the strife of one fighting for life. And she had not half done when he
  understood her fully; and he had no sooner understood her, than he was
  subdued, and succumbed.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;" he faltered.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Teeger," she answered, "there's none so blind as those who will
  not see."</p>

  <p>His arm stole round her shuddering body.</p>

  <p>Everyone is said to have his failing; and this man, Walter, in no respect
  a man of strong mind, was certainly on his amatory side, most sudden,
  promiscuous, and infirm. And this tendency was, if anything, heightened by
  the quite sincere strain of his mind in the direction of "spiritual things":
  for, under sudden temptation, back rushed his being, with the greater rigour,
  into its natural channel. On the whole, had he not been a Puritan, he would
  have been a Don Juan.</p>

  <p>In an instant Rachel's weight was hanging upon his neck, he kissing her
  with passion.</p>

  <p>After this she said to him: "But you are only doing this out of pity,
  Walter. Tell the truth, you are in love with Annie?"</p>

  <p>He, like Peter, tumbled at once into a fib. "That's what you say!"</p>

  <p>"You are," she insisted, filled with the bliss of the fib.</p>

  <p>"Bah! I'm not. Never was. You are the girl for me."</p>

  <p>When they went home, they entered the house at different times, she first,
  he waiting twenty minutes in the street.</p>

  <p>The house was small, so the sisters slept together in the second-floor
  front room; Walter in the second-floor back; Mrs. Evans in the first-floor
  back, the first-floor front being "the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>The girls, therefore, generally went to bed together: and that night, as
  they undressed, there was a row.</p>

  <p>First, a long silence. Then Rachel, to say something, pointed to some new
  gloves of Annie's, asking: "How much did you give for those?"</p>

  <p>"Money and kind words," replied Annie.</p>

  <p>This was the beginning.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no need to be rude about it," said Rachel. She was happy,
  in paradise, despised Annie that night.</p>

  <p>"Still," said Annie, after a silence of ten minutes before the glass,
  "still, I should never run after a man like that. I'd die first."</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," replied Rachel.</p>

  <p>"You have. I should be ashamed of myself, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"Talk away. You're a little fool."</p>

  <p>"It's you. Throwing yourself at the head of a man who doesn't care for
  you. What can you call yourself?"</p>

  <p>Rachel laughed&mdash;happily, yet dangerously.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother yourself my girl," she said.</p>

  <p>"Think of going out every night to meet a man in that way: look here, it's
  too disgusting of you, girl!"</p>

  <p>"Is it?"</p>

  <p>"You can't deny that you were with Mr. Teeger to-night?"</p>

  <p>"That I wasn't."</p>

  <p>"It's false! Anyone can see it by the joy in your face."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose I was, what about it?"</p>

  <p>"But a woman should be decent, I think; a woman should be able to command
  her feelings, and not expose herself like that. Believe me, it gives me the
  creeps all over to think of."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, don't be jealous, my girl."</p>

  <p>The gentle Annie flamed!</p>

  <p>"Jealous! of you!"</p>

  <p>"There isn't any need, you know&mdash;not yet."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not! There never will be need! Do you take Mr. Teeger for a
  raving lunatic? I should go and have some false teeth put in first if I were
  you!"</p>

  <p>Thus did Annie drop to the rock-bed of vulgarity; but she knew it to be
  necessary in order to touch Rachel, as with a white-hot wire, on her very
  nerve of anguish, and, in fact, at these words Rachel's face resembled white
  iron, while she cried out, "Never mind my teeth! It isn't the teeth a man
  looks at! A man knows a finely built woman when he sees her&mdash;not like a
  little dumpy podge!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you. You are very polite," replied Annie, browbeaten by an
  intensity fiercer than her own. "But still, it's nonsense, Rachel, to talk of
  my being jealous of you. I knew Mr. Teeger six months before you. And you
  won't know him much longer either, for I don't want to have mother disgraced
  here, and this is no fit place for him to lodge in. I can easily make him
  leave it soon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this thing Rachel flew, with minatory palm over Annie's cheek, ready to
  strike. "You dare do anything to make him go away! I'll tear your
  little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Annie winked, flinched, uttered a sob, no more fight left in her.</p>

  <p>So for two weeks the situation lasted. Only, after that night, so intense
  grew the bitterness between the sisters, that Annie moved down to the
  first-floor back, sleeping now with Mrs.</p>

  <p>Evans who dimly wondered. As for Walter, meanwhile, his heart was divided
  within him. He loved Annie; he was fascinated and mesmerised by Rachel. In
  another age and country he would have married both. Every day he came to a
  different resolve, not knowing what to do. One thing was evident&mdash;a
  wedding-ring would be necessary, and he purchased one, uncertain for which of
  the girls.</p>

  <p>"Look here, lass," he said to Annie in the train, coming home, "let us put
  a stop to this. The boss doesn't seem to be in a hurry about that rise of
  screw, so suppose we get spliced, and be done?"</p>

  <p>"Privately?"</p>

  <p>"Rather. Your ma and sister mustn't know,&mdash;not just yet a while."</p>

  <p>"And you will still keep on living at the house?"</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, for the time being."</p>

  <p>She looked up into his face and smiled. It was settled. But two nights
  afterwards he met Rachel on his way home from prayer-meeting; at first was
  honest and distant; but then committed the incredible weakness of going with
  her for a walk among the squares, and ended by winning from her an easily
  granted promise of marriage, on the same terms as those arranged within
  Annie.</p>

  <p>When, the next day at lunch-time, he put his foot on the threshold of the
  Registrar's office to give notice, he was still in a state of agonized
  indecision as to the name which he should couple with his own.</p>

  <p>When the official said, "Now the name of the other party?" Walter
  hesitated, shuffled with his feet, then answered:</p>

  <p>"Rachel Evans."</p>

  <p>Not till he was again in the street did he remember that Rachel was the
  name of both the girls, and that liberty of choice between them still
  remained to him.</p>

  <p>Now, from the day of "notice" to the day of wedlock, an interval of
  twenty-one clear days must by law, elapse, and Walter, though weak enough to
  inform both the sisters of the step he had taken, was careful to give them
  only a vague idea of the date fixed. His once clear conscience, meanwhile,
  was grievously troubled, his feet in a net; he feared to speak to God; and
  went drifting like flotsam on the river of chance.</p>

  <p>And chance alone it was which at last cast him upon the land. The fifth
  day before the marriage was a Bank Holiday, and he had arranged with Rachel
  to go out with her that day to Hyde Park, she to wait for him at an arranged
  spot at two o'clock. At two, then, at a street-corner, stood Rachel waiting,
  twirling her parasol, walking a little, returning. Walter, however, did not
  appear, and what could have happened was beyond her divination. Had he
  misunderstood or missed her? Though incredible, it was the only thing to
  think. To Hyde Park, at any rate, she went alone, feeling desolate and
  ennuyée, in the vague hope of there meeting him.</p>

  <p>What had happened was this: Walter had been half-way toward the rendezvous
  with Rachel, when he was met in the street by Annie, who had gone to spend
  the day with a married friend at Stroud Green, but had returned, owing to the
  husband's illness. Seeing Walter, her face lit up with smiles.</p>

  <p>"Harry's down with the influenza," she said, "so I couldn't stay and bore
  poor Ethel. Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>For the first time since his "conversion" twelve years before, Walter,
  with a high flush, now consciously lied.</p>

  <p>"Only to the schoolroom," he said, "to hunt for something."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am open to be taken out, if any kind friend will be so kind," she
  said fondly.</p>

  <p>Now he had that morning vowed to himself to wed Rachel; and by this vow he
  now again vowed to be bound. All the more reason why, for the last time, he
  should "take out" Annie.</p>

  <p>"Come along, then, old girl," he gaily said: "where shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go to Hyde Park," said Annie. And to Hyde Park they went, Walter,
  ever and anon, stabbed by the bitter memory of waiting Rachel.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock the two were walking along the north bank of the
  Serpentine westward toward a two-arched bridge, which is also pierced by a
  third narrow arch over the bank: to this narrow arch, since it was drizzling,
  they were making for shelter, when Rachel, a person of the keenest vision,
  sighted them from the south bank. She was frantic at once. Annie, who was
  supposed to be at Stroud Green! What treachery! This, then, was why . . . She
  ran panting along the bank, toward the bridge, then over it, northward, and
  now heard the two under the arch, who stood there talking&mdash;of the
  wedding. Unfortunately, just here is a block of masonry, which prevented
  Rachel from leaning directly over the arch to listen. Yet the necessity to
  hear was absolute: so she ran back clear of the masonry, and bent far over
  the parapet, outwards and sideways toward the arch, straining neck, body,
  ears, and anyone looking into those staring eyes then would have comprehended
  the doctrine of the Ferine Soul. But she was at a disadvantage, heard only
  murmurs, and&mdash;was that a kiss? Further and further forth she strained.
  And now suddenly, within a cry, she is in the water, where it is shallow near
  the bank. In the fall her head struck upon a stone in the mud.</p>

  <p>For three days she screamed continuously the name of Walter, filling the
  street with it, calling him hers only. On the third night, in the midst of a
  frightful crisis of cries, she suddenly died.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Rachel, don't say you are dead!" cried Annie over her.</p>

  <p>The death occurred two days before the marriage-day, and on the next,
  Walter, well wounded, said to Annie: "This knocks our little affair on the
  head, of course."</p>

  <p>Annie was silent. Then, with a pout, she said: "I don't see why. After
  all, it was her own fault, entirely. Why should we suffer?"</p>

  <p>For the feud between the sisters had become cruel as death; and it
  outlasted death: Annie, on the subject of Rachel and Walter, being no longer
  a gentle girl, but marble, without respect or pity.</p>

  <p>And so, in spite of the trepidations and hesitancy of Walter, the marriage
  took place, even while Rachel lay stretched on the bed in the second-floor
  front of No. 13.</p>

  <p>The ceremony did not, however transpire without hitch and omen. It was
  necessary, first of all, for Walter to forewarn Annie that he had given
  notice of her to the Registrar by her second name of "Rachel"&mdash;a
  mad-looking proceeding that was almost the cause of a rupture which nothing
  but Walter's most ardent pleadings could steer him clear of. At any rate it
  was to "Rachel," and not to "Annie" that he was, as a matter of fact, after
  all married.</p>

  <p>After the ceremony, performed in their lunch-time, they returned to
  business together in Little Britain.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock the same night, as he was going up to bed, she ran after
  him, and in the passage there was a long, furtive kiss&mdash;their last on
  earth.</p>

  <p>"Twelve o'clock?" he whispered intensely.</p>

  <p>She held up her forefinger. "One!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, say twelve!"</p>

  <p>She did not answer, but drew her palm playfully, across his cheek, meaning
  consent, for Mrs.</p>

  <p>Evans was an inveterately heavy sleeper. He went up. And, careful to leave
  his door a little ajar, he extinguished his candle, and went to bed. In the
  apartment nearby lay stark in the dark&mdash;with learned, eternal eyelids
  and drowsy brow&mdash;the dead.</p>

  <p>Walter could not but think of this presence close at hand. "Well, poor
  girl!" he sighed. "Poor Rachel! Well, well. His way is in the sea, after all,
  and His path in the Great Deep, and His footsteps are not known." Then he
  thought of Annie&mdash;the little wife! But instead of Annie, there was
  Rachel. The two women fought vehemently for his thought&mdash;and ever the
  dead was stronger than the living. . . . Instead of Annie there was
  Rachel&mdash;and again Rachel.</p>

  <p>At last he could hear twelve strike from a steeple, and sat up in bed,
  listening eagerly for the door to open, or a footfall on the floor.</p>

  <p>A little American clock ticked in the room; and in the flue of the chimney
  was a sough and chaunt just audible.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she was intensely with him, filling the chamber&mdash;-from
  nowhere. He had heard no footstep, no opening of the door: yet certainly, she
  was with him now, all suddenly, close to him, over him, talking breathlessly
  to him.</p>

  <p>His first sensation was a shuddering which strongly shook him from head to
  foot, like the shuddering of Russian cold. She held him down by the
  shoulders; was stretched at length on the bed, over him; and the room seemed
  full of a rustling and rushing, very strange, like starched muslins rushing
  out in stormy agitation. She was speaking, too, to him in breathless haste,
  whimpering a secret gibberish which whimpered like a pup for
  passion&mdash;about love and its definition, and about the soul, and the
  worm, and Eternity, and the passion of death, and the nuptials of the tomb,
  and the lust and hollowness of the void. And he, too, was speaking,
  whispering through his pattering teeth, saying: "Sh-h-h, Rachel&mdash;Annie,
  I mean&mdash;sh-h-h, my girl&mdash;your ma will hear! Rachel,
  don't&mdash;sh-h-h, now!" But even while he kept up this "sh-h-h
  dear&mdash;sh-h-h, now," he was conscious of the invasion of a strange rage,
  of such a strength as if energy was being vehemently pumped into him from
  some behemoth omnipotence. The form above him he could hardly discern, the
  room was so dark, but he felt that her garment was flowing forth from her
  neck in a continuous flutter, with the rustling of the starch of a thousand
  shrouds, like the outflow of a pennant in wind; and the quivering gauze
  seemed now to swell and fill the chamber, and now to sink again to the size
  of woman. And ever the rhapsody of love and death went on, mixed with the
  chattered "Sh-h-h, Rachel&mdash;Annie, I mean," of Walter; till, suddenly, he
  was involved in an embrace so horrible, felt himself encompassed by a might
  so intolerable, that his soul fainted within him. He sank back; thought span
  and failed in darkness beneath the spell of that lullaby; he muttered,
  "Receive my spirit. . . ."</p>

  <p>After two days Walter, still unconscious, died. His disfigured body they
  placed in a grave not far from Rachel's.</p>
