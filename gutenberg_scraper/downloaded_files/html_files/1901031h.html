<p>William Bradley's journal is an <i>unpublished</i> manuscript.
Australian copyright law recently changed to allow publication of
thousands of such documents. The production of this ebook is a
celebration of this change in the law which sees the liberation of
numerous documents, which have languished in the stack areas of
public libraries, so that they can be freely accessed.</p>

<p>I have not changed the text of the transcript, but have added a table
of contents and included the images from the journal. If you prefer

<p>&mdash;Colin Choat</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>The following is quoted from <i>Copyright Term Changes Coming
2019</i> published by the Australian Libraries Copyright Committee.
It can be downloaded from <a href=
"http://libcopyright.org.au/sites/libcopyright.org.au/files/documents/Copyright%20Term%20Changes%20in%202019_0.pdf">
Australian Libraries Copyright Committee</a> site.</p>

<p class="newspaper">In 2017 the Australian government introduced
major changes to the copyright term provisions of the Australian
Copyright Act, as part of the Copyright Amendment (Disability
Access and Other Measures) Act 2017. These changes replace
Australia's existing copyright term provisions with new rules that
make them more consistent for different materials, and provide
clearer rules for materials whose author is not known. As a result
the copyright term of materials in Australia will be simpler and
fairer and a large number of old materials previously locked up
will be freed for use by all.<br>
<br>
The new term provisions have been introduced primarily to end the
outdated concept of perpetual copyright for unpublished works. This
legacy rule meant that unpublished materials like letters and
diaries never fell into the public domain. This means that
materials that are hundreds of years old&mdash;such as the Captain
Cook diaries and the Jane Austen letters held in the collection of
Australia's National Library&mdash;were still protected by
copyright in Australia. Under the new rules, materials in Australia
will have the same protection whether or not they are
published.<br>
<br>
The result of these changes is that on 1 January 2019 (when they
came into effect) hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions, of
theses diaries, letters and other old unpublished works held in our
national collections, instantaneously entered the public domain,
making them free for anyone to access and use.</p>

<h2>A Voyage to New South Wales</h2>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="dec86" id="dec86"></a>December
1786</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 1]</p>

<p>According to previous advertisements, Tenders were received for
Transports to carry Convicts to Botany Bay on the Coast of New
South Wales &amp; taken up the 12th of Sep.r 1786 in 5 Vessels
measuring about 300 Tons more than advertised for: The Berwick
Store Ship about that time was taken into Dock at Deptford. it
being intended that she should be fitted as a Man of War for this
Expedition. The Grantham Packet was purchased into the service to
be employed as a Tender, but on examination was found very rotten
&amp; totally unfit for the Voyage, in consequence of which, the
Supply Navy Transport was ordered to Deptford &amp; fitted in lieu
of the Grantham. Three Ships measuring 990 tons were also taken up
as Store Ships &amp; stowed under the direction of Cap.n Tier Agent
for Transports in the River. The 25th of October the Berwick
Storeship was Commissioned &amp; named the Sirius, Cap.n Phillip
(the intended Governor of the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 2]</p>

<p>New Colony) was appointed to the Command of her: The Supply was
also commission'd &amp; the command of her given to Lieu.t H.L.
Ball. The 28th the Sirius having a few hands began rigging &amp;c.
from which to the 8th of December we were employed getting ready
for Sea, which was much retarded by bad weather &amp; unavoidable
delays in being furnish'd with some part of the Stores. The
Provisions with which we were supplied were of the best quality,
Wheat, Sugar, Essence of Malt, Mustard seed &amp; other articles
usually supplied in long Voyages we were also furnish'd with, &amp;
an unlimited Order for Officers Stores.</p>

<p>Tuesday. Dec.r 5. Capn Hunter came on board &amp; on the same
day, the Officers had directions from Capn Phillip to receive his
Orders for carrying on the duty; the 9th. we sailed down the River
&amp; Moored the same afternoon in Long Reach, just off Purfleet,
We rec.d our Guns, Powder &amp;c. here &amp; were ready with a
Pilot on board the 15th to proceed at the shortest notice.</p>

<p>The 15th two of the Transports passed us bound to the Port where
their proportion of Convicts were to be embarked, the three Store
Ships also passed bound to the Mother bank, the place of
Rendezvous.</p>

<p>The 21st another of the Transports pass'd; there now remained
only two at Gallions (Alexander &amp; Lady Penryhne) both of which
were to take in their proportion of Convicts from the Hulk at
Woolwich &amp; from Newgate &amp; the Sirius detained at Long Reach
to escort them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 3]</p>

<p>Some alterations were found necessary to be made to the
securities already fitted in those ships from the representation of
the Officer commanding the party of Marines on board the Alexander,
it was also judged necessary to make some alterations in the
handcuffs.</p>

<p>On the 27th. these Ships were again reported ready but were
detained as no Orders had been yet given to discharge any Convicts
from the Hulks to these Transports.</p>

<p>The Board of Longitude furnished the following Instruments for
the use of the Voyage &amp; new Colony, An Astronomical Quadrant of
one foot Radius. A 3½ feet treble object Glass achromatic telescope
by Dolland with a wire Micrometer for measuring diff.ce of R[t].
Ascension &amp; Declination, also a Micrometer with oblique wires
&amp; a Quadrant fixed to it with a moveable short Telescope to
take the distance of any object (nearly) from bright fixed stars. A
Night Glass. An Astronomical Clock. A Journeyman Clock. An Alarum
Clock. An Old Sextant by Ramsden. A portable Barometer &amp; two
Thermometers. These Instruments Captain Phillip gave a receipt for,
promising to return them to the Board (the dangers of the Sea &amp;
other unavoidable acccident excepted) at his return or a receipt
from such Officer as may supercede him in the Command. Lieu.t Dawes
of the Marines a Voluntier for the Botany Bay detachment having
been introduced to Dr. Maskelyne the Astronomer Royal, he was
acknowledged a proper person to make such observations on shore as
might be judged of use.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 4]</p>

<p>The 24th. The Supply anchored in Long Reach.</p>

<p>By Order of the King in Council the Admiralty were to appoint a
second Captain to the Sirius, with the Rank of Post Captain &amp;
pay of a 6th Rate with 4 servants, with full Power to Command Her
in absence of the Principal Captain, but nevertheless subject to
his Control &amp; Orders: In consequence of this Cap.n John Hunter
was appointed 2nd Cap.n of the Sirius (bearing date 15th
Dec.r).</p>

<p>In the beginnning of January. A ship of 350 Tons was taken up
the first Tonnage being found very insufficient.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jan87" id="jan87"></a>January 1787</p>

<p>January. 4th. Orders were received at Woolwich for the Convicts
to be embarked on board the Alexander but some of them being in a
deplorable situation from disease could not be received. A part of
the women Convicts were put on board the Lady Penryhne, these ships
were still detained, not having their full proportion of Convicts
on board.</p>

<p>13th. The Supply sailed for the Nore.</p>

<p>The 18th. We received Orders to proceed to Portsmouth with the
Alexander &amp; Lady Penryhne as soon as they joined us: These
Orders were pleasing to us, &amp; particularly so; as the situation
of the Sirius with respect to her being kept in constant readiness
for Sea while lying off Purfleet was render'd very precarious being
subject in light winds &amp; calm thick weather (which we had much
of) to have Vessels driving on board us every Tide; We had several
foul</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 5]</p>

<p>of us, one of which carried away the Spritsail yard, which was
the only damage we received from them; The Supply had her Bowsprit
carried away by a large ship falling on board her. &amp; which was
the cause of her being ordered to the Nore.</p>

<p>The 19th. It was discover'd that some of the Convicts on board
the Alexander had got their handcuffs off, what they could promise
themselves from such an attempt appears strange, as it would have
been impossible for any of them to have effected their escape, with
the Guard &amp; precautions used on board that ship had they all
been loose in the place of their confinement; They were handcuff'd
two together or had chains on, those that were handcuffed were
never seperated but obliged to move together upon all
occasions.</p>

<p>Between decks, in which these People were confined was guarded
by a strong Bulk head abaft with loop holes &amp; filled w nails;
Marine Centinels at the hatchway, where a ladder was put down
occasionally &amp; when down particularly attended by those
Centinels: A Guard Boat also was constantly attending those ships
after sunset while at Gallions.</p>

<p>The 21st. An Officer was sent from the Sirius to the Alexander
(whose Mast heads we could see over the land) to order a signal by
which we might be informed when the remainder of the Convicts were
embarking &amp; also a signal to let us know when the Alexander was
going to get under weigh; the intention of these signals was that
the Sirius might</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 6]</p>

<p>be unmoored ready to join them as they came down.</p>

<p>25th. Orders were receiv'd to proceed to Portsmouth with [ye]
Alexander &amp; Lady Penryhne without waiting for them to compleat
their number of Convicts, the wind setting in at East prevented
those ships from joining us immediately as order'd; the Lady
Penryhne joined us.</p>

<p>The 28th &amp; went on to Gravesend having occasion to stop
there.</p>

<p>The 29th the Alexander passed us &amp; proceeded to Gravesend
where they had likewise occasion to stop.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 30th. We sailed from Long Reach &amp; passed the
Alexander &amp; Lady Penryhne, they not being ready were order'd to
follow us to the Nore as soon as possible, in the afternoon we
moored at the Nore in 12f.m water, Nore light NWbW. Minster Church
sw. Here the Supply joined us from the Little Nore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="feb87" id="feb87"></a>February
1787</p>

<p>February. 1st. The Transports joined us; the Complement of women
Convicts had been compleated (104) while at Gravesend.</p>

<p>2nd. The weather was so very unsettled &amp; thick that we could
not move till 11 AM when it clearing away with a breeze at WSW,
sailed immediately, the Supply Armed Tender, Alexander &amp; Lady
Penryhne Transports in Company, it soon falling Calm we Anchor'd
between the E.t buoy of the Oaze &amp; W. buoy of the Mouse at the
entrance of the Nubb Channel in 9f.m water.</p>

<p>The 3rd at 7 AM weigh'd &amp; made sail with the wind at SW
&amp; run through the Queen's Channel as soon as the Tide flowed
sufficiently. It blowing very strong &amp; it being</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 7]</p>

<p>impossible to get into the Downes before night, we Anchored in
Margate Road. Sunday. 4th. At 5 AM weigh'd &amp; made sail; at 11
Anchored in the Downes, the wind setting in at SW, Moored the ship.
The 5th the wind at SE made the Signal &amp; Unmoored; the Lady
Penryhne got under sail &amp; passing near us ask'd permission to
go out &amp; Bring too off the Foreland, which was granted on
account of her heavy sailing, at 11 AM. we weigh'd with the Supply
&amp; Alexander but the wind coming to the So.ward &amp; the flood
tide made, we were obliged to Anchor again in the Downes, the Lady
Penryhne did not return on our coming to an Anchor altho' near
enough to see the Signal plainly.</p>

<p>The 6th, the wind being fix'd at SW.t &amp; the weather having a
bad appearance Moored the ship &amp; made every preparation to ride
out a Gale of wind which came as expected &amp; blew very strong
all the 7th. Sunday. 11th. It again blew a Gale of wind at SSW, the
Bt B.r anchor came home, the ship did not bring up 'till both
Anchors were ahead; we had a cable &amp; half on the Bt B.r at the
time, which gave us reason to suppose that our Anchors were not
sufficient for the ship or she would not have started with such a
scope of Cable when most of the marchant ships held fast. Tuesday.
13th. The Gale abated &amp; the wind came to WNW, Hove up the S.l
B.r &amp; got every thing ready to proceed whenever the wind should
favour us: The 15th The wind back'd to the sw &amp; by Noon blew a
hard Gale of Wind</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 8]</p>

<p>from that Q.r we were again under the necessity of giving the
Ship a large scope of Cable &amp; striking every thing close down;
several Ships drove this day &amp; the Houghton E.t Indiaman very
near us, which obliged us to veer away 2 Cables &amp; let go the
S.l Bower to check the ship from [indecipherable word] on board her
on the weather side, the Houghton took the first opportunity of the
tide making strong to windward to heave both her Anchors up &amp;
give us a clear birth.</p>

<p>Saturday 17th Moderate weather, at day light unmoored &amp; got
every ready for sailing the moment the wind should favour us;
Sunday 18th. Wind at NW moderate breeze weigh'd &amp; made sail but
the wind coming to WSW Anchored again. 19th Mod.r Breeze at NW, at
4 AM weigh'd &amp; stood out of the Downes. H.M. armed Tender
Supply &amp; Alexander Transport in C.o At 11 the tide being done
&amp; falling Calm, anchored off Dungeness, the Lighthouse W½S 3 or
4 Miles. By the mean of 23 good observations taken in the Downes I
make the Latitude of the S.o Foreland 51º.12'N0. 20th. At 3 PM the
tides making to the Wr.ward weigh'd with a light breeze at NW which
increased &amp; veered to the N.oward as the evening came on, at 6
passed Dungeness &amp; at day light saw Beachy Head NEbN 6 miles:
At Noon Lat. Obs. 50º.32½' Beachy Head NE. 4 leagues. 21st P.M.
wind variable with thick weather AM at 9 saw the Isle of Wight the
weather clear'd up with a mod.r breeze at NE. Thursday 22nd. At 2
PM Anchored at the Mother bank &amp; Moored immediately; found</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 9]</p>

<p>the Scarborough &amp; Lady Penryhne Transports &amp; the 3 Store
Ships lying here. Friday. 23rd. The Prince of Wales Transport
arrived.</p>

<p>While we lay in the Downes we found it necessary that some
alteration should be made in the Hawse peices as the Cables had
formerly work'd on the Spar deck with the Windlass &amp; now on the
Gun Deck with a Messenger, The shipwrights came on board to make
those necessary alterations. The 24th. A party of Marines embarked
on board, as did those belonging to the Supply; &amp; that part of
the Detachment for the Scarborough Transport.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="mar87" id="mar87"></a>March 1787</p>

<p>Friday. March 2nd: 210 Convicts arrived at Portsmouth in Waggons
under a Guard of Light Horse, but it blowing a Gale of wind at SW.
they could not be taken off to the Transports, they were carried on
board the Gorgon lying in Blockhouse Hole, under charge of the
Guard ships Boats: Sunday morn.g it became moderate, they were
taken to the Motherbank in Sailing Lighters belonging to the Dock
Yard &amp; put on board the Alexander &amp; Scarborough
Transports.</p>

<p>The 8th. We received 3 Anchors in lieu of the Bowers &amp; Spare
Anchor which we had before found very insufficient to ride the Ship
in a Gale of wind: the 9th Camp Equipage for 660 Tents were rec.d
&amp; distributed to the different Ships. The 15th. the Friendship
Transport arrived from Plymouth &amp; the Charlotte the next day
both which had taken their proportion of Men &amp; Women Convicts
at Plymouth.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Convicts on board the Alexander having
been</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 10]</p>

<p>embarked near 8 months &amp; being rather sickly it was judged
necessary that she should be smoked &amp; whitewash'd; for this
purpose two deck'd Lighters were furnish'd from the Dock Yard to
receive such of the Convicts as it was necessary to remove while it
was doing. The 23rd the Essex Hulk was order'd to be fitted to
receive those Convicts, but the Alexander being well clean'd,
whitewash'd, smoked &amp; spunged with Oil of Tar &amp; the sick
recovering fast it was not judged necessary to use a Hulk or even
to keep both Lighters, one of which was returned &amp; the other
kept for the their being whitewash'd, which number was so trifling
that this Lighter was also returned as soon as most of the
Alexander's sick had recover'd.</p>

<p>The 24th. Our Complement of Seamen was filled up with Volunteers
from the Guard ships.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="apr87" id="apr87"></a>April 1787</p>

<p>April. 7. Lord Hood hoisted his Flag on b.d the Triumph in
Portsmouth Harbour, saluted d.o with 13 Guns. About this time we
were supplied with two Cw.t of Portable Soup in addition to the
proportion allowed the Ship (50lb) which altogether was but a small
allowance for such a voyage, but small as it was even that was not
allowed by the Sick &amp; Hurt Board until an order for that
purpose was obtained from the Admiralty. Fresh Beef was supplied
for the Convicts &amp; Wine allowed for such of the Sick as the
Surgeon might judge necessary. An</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 11]</p>

<p>additional proportion of Vinegar was allowed to all the Ships
&amp; a quantity of Oil of Tar. May 3rd. Two Men Convicts 36 Women
w 2 Children arrived at Portsmouth &amp; were immediately
embarked.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="may87" id="may87"></a>May 1787</p>

<p>May. 7th. Captain Phillip arrived at Portsmouth, He brought with
him a Timekeeper made by Mr Kendal &amp; a Sextant; both furnish'd
by the Board of Longitude for the use of the Voyage. The Timekeeper
was sent by an Officer to the Royal Academy at Portsmouth &amp;
left in charge of Mr Bayley the Head Master. The 10th We were paid
2 months advance &amp; the signal made to prepare for sailing. The
11th. Waiting only for a wind to carry the ships to sea, an Officer
was sent to bring on board the Timekeeper the rate of its going
determined by Mr Bayley the 3 days which He had it, lost 1",38 pr
day.</p>

<p>The precautions necessary to prevent the Timekeeper from being
let down were order'd by Capt Phillip who with Cap.n Hunter or Mr
Dawes were always to be present at the winding it at Noon &amp; it
was order'd to be the duty of the Lieutenant who brought 12 O'clock
to see it done &amp; the Officer who releived him was not to take
charge of the deck 'till he was informed that it was done, the
Centinel at the Cabin door was also order'd to plant himself inside
the Cabin on hearing the Bell ring at Noon &amp; not to go out to
be releived until he was told or saw that the Timekeeper was wound
up by one of the Officers: The management of the Timekeeper for
keeping the Longitude by it was given to</p>

<p>Saturday. 12th. His Majesty's Ship Hyaena, Capn DeCourcy joined
us at the Motherbank being order'd under our Command &amp; to
accompany us a certain distance. AM. Unmoored &amp; weigh'd with a
breeze at SE, working to the E.t ward to get round St. Helens
before night but the wind failing us toward the evening &amp; the
eastern tide done we were obliged to Anchor at Spithead: The Convoy
anchor'd as they could between the Motherbank &amp; Spithead.</p>

<p>The 14th. At Noon Lat:d Obs. 49º:58½' N &amp; Longitude by the
Timekeeper 3º:42'W.t Start p.t bore NEbN 5 Leag.s: Spoke the Convoy
to enquire if they had left any one behind, found that the 3rd Mate
of the Charlotte the Provost Martial &amp; 5 of the Crew of the
Fishburne were left behind. The 15th at Noon, were off Plymouth
Sound, in the evening saw a Frigate standing towards us but being
little wind she did not get near enough to speak to us; Nothing
material happen'd till the 21.st on which day the Hyaena partd.
Company for England; during the time she was with us she performed
every service that a Ship could do, to admiration &amp; had the
heaviest sailing ship of the Convoy in tow a great part of the
time.</p>

<p>This same day the Irons were order'd to be taken off the
Convicts, except any whose ill behaviour made it necessary by way
of punishment to have them kept on: This lenient step towards
making those unhappy wretches comfortable was very ill receiv'd on
board the Scarborouogh, two of the Convicts belonging to her being
brought on board the Sirius the same evening for Mutinous
behaviour, they were severely punished &amp; sent on board the P.r
of Wales Transport heavily iron'd. Since leaving Spithead we had
only a day or two unpleasant pleasure &amp; thought ourselves very
fortunate in getting so soon &amp; well clear of the Land; Lat:e

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 18]</p>

<p>from the NE quarter which run us the length of Madeira.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 29th. The Supply ahead made the Signal for seeing Land
which was at first supposed to be Porto Sancto, but as we came in
with it, found it to be the Deserters &amp; the weather so thick
that the Island of Madeira could not be seen as we passed.</p>

<p>The Deserters are generally spoken of as the third, after the
Island of Madeira &amp; Porto Sancto &amp; as a barren rock; there
are 3 Island Deserters, two of considerable height &amp; 3 Miles
extent, the other a small one, lies nearer Madeira, there is a
passage between these Islands, as also between them &amp; Madeira
which is 6 or 7 leagues to the N.o &amp; W.t of them; the N.o most
Deserter we observ'd in Latitude 32º:27'N.o Longitude by Timekeeper
16º:35'W Variation 18º.W.t.</p>

<p>The 31st. Made the Salvages bearing SWbS. we found the situation
of this Island very different from what is laid down in the Chart:
By a good mer.n Observation we made the Latitude of this Island
30º:12'N.o &amp; Longitude by Timekeeper 15º:56'W, this Island has
some high land on it &amp; when it bore W.t a high round hill was
over the middle of the Island: By calculation from angles taken
&amp; a Base by the Ships run I make the length of this Island 1,8
Mile in a N70ºW direction true bearing. We saw 4 rocks to the NW of
it which can only be spoken of as rocks above water tho' they are
some height; I have seen them in passing to the W.t ward when the
large Island could not be seen through the Haze, we passed to the
E.t ward at about 4 leagues.</p>

<p class="caption">'Santa Cruz on the SE side of Teneriffe; Sirius
&amp; Convoy in the Roads. June 1787. The Peak Shewing in a Gap
betweeen two other Mountains'</p>

<p>The NE wind left us the day before we made the Salvages in
Latitude 32º:19'N.o Longitude 16º:30'W &amp; hauled round to the
W.t &amp; SW which winds continued to the 2nd of June when it again
favour'd us &amp; at 5 AM. Saw the Island of Teneriffe bearing
SWbS, the weather being hazey the peak did not shew itself.</p>

<p>The 3rd. at 7 PM Anchor'd &amp; Moored in Santa Cruz road with
the Supply &amp; Convoy in 13f.m E.t p.t of the Bay (La Rocquet p.t
&amp; by some taken for P. de Nago) N. 78ºE. Franciscan Church with
a very remarkable white steeple S.73ºW. The Fort to the S.o ward of
the Town SW, Peak WSW. Off shore about ½ a Mile, we found the
ground all round us a sandy bottom, yet we used the precaution of
buoying up the Cables. In making Teneriffe to the SW of you &amp;
the weather hazey you will not see the Peak, but fall in with Punta
de Nago a very high land making in a steep bluff, off which are
several high ragged rocks, which shew themselves as you come well
in with the land: We steer'd close in with this point &amp; run
from it WSW [p] Compass 12 Miles as near as we could estimate; As
we sailed along the land we shut in Punta de Nago w Antekara p.t
&amp; Antekara p.t with La Rocquet p.t before we got into the
Anchoring ground. Antekara p.t is just opening with La Rocquet when
NEbN by Compass; La Rocquet p.t from our Anchoring birth in the
road makes in a ragged Bluff with a little Sugar loaf top'd Rock
just open without it: I would recommend Anchoring so far in as to
shut the other points in for clear ground.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 20]</p>

<p>Before we Anchor'd the Master of the Port accompanied by several
Officers came on board to make the necessary enquiries. Next day
Cap.t Phillip with the Officers of the Squadron &amp; Garrison
waited on the Governor, who return'd the Visit two days after on
board the Sirius. This Island has a very ragged appearance &amp; at
first sight be supposed to be incapable of producing any thing,
there are many spots well cultivated in the Island &amp; very
productive besides the Vineyards. The Season was very unfavorable
for us to get supplies of Fruit, Grapes not ripe, Oranges, Lemons
&amp;c. very scarce as was every kind of Fruit except Figs. We were
tolerably supplied with Fresh Beef, Poultry &amp; wine very
good.</p>

<p>The Road of Santa Cruz is on the SE side the Island &amp; is
open to the S.o &amp; SE winds which makes it very dangerous to lay
there in the winter season when those winds prevail; We had the
breeze fresh from the sea in the day &amp; off the Land early in
the evening while we lay there. There is a Stone Pier run out for
the purpose of shiping or landing goods &amp; is the only safe
landing place near the Town. To the S.o ward of the Pier there are
some windmills which shew very conspicuous coming in from the Sea:
The water for shipping is convey'd to the Pier, were we filled in
the Boat with a Hose: this water comes from the same rivulet that
supplies the Town, to which it is brought a considerable distance
along the Rocks in spouts open at</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 21]</p>

<p>the top on an easy descent, just allowing the water a free
passage: they are led across several deep Gullies &amp; every where
supported with posts to prevent their being carried away by the
great torrents that rush down in the rainy season. The Latitude
observed on board the Sirius was 28º:30'Nr &amp; the Longitude by
Timekeeper 16º:16'W. The Peak we estimated to be in 28º:18'N.o
&amp; 16º:31'W.</p>

<p>The Country above the City of Santa Cruz rises more gradual than
any of this part of the Coast, which is cheifly very high ragged
Mountains; In the part that we anchored in, the Peak shew'd itself
between two of the highest Hills &amp; was by us supposed to be a
part of one of them 'till a very clear morning convinced us of its
being the Peak it bore WSW by Compass. There are two small
Batteries near the Pier &amp; some others scatter'd along the
Coast, by which the Road is secured. They are making great progress
in their Silk &amp; woolen manufactories, many poor are supported
by subscription &amp; employed in these Houses of Industry: The
Silk is entirely the produce of the Islands. The wool is imported
from Europe which they mix with that of the Canary Islands, They
also make tape, coarse cloths from Flax imported from Holland
cheifly.</p>

<p>The 7th of June, Being the Festival of Corpus Christi, the Boats
belonging to the Transports were order'd not to land, that this</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 22]</p>

<p>Religious Ceremony might not be interrrupted by the Enormities
which English Seamen are too apt to commit in foreign Ports. This
Festival is kept on the Thursday next after Trinity Sunday; The
Religious observance of carrying the Host is on this day kept with
great pomp &amp; solemnity in all Roman Catholic Countries &amp; is
announced early in the morning by ringing the Bells of all the
Convents, Monasteries &amp; Churches in the Town.</p>

<p>Several of the Officers of our Squadron went on shore to see the
procession, which assemble at 10 O'clock at a particular Church,
where after having performed Mass, the Host, or consecrated wafer
(which on certain festivals &amp; other occasions they offer up as
a Host or sacrifice for the Sins of Mankind) inclosed in a glass
case, is taken down from a little recess over the Altar &amp;
deliver'd to the Priest who is to carry it through the whole of the
procession; A Canopy is held over it by four other Priests &amp;
the congregation having arranged themselves in the order in which
they are to parade the Town, the Military Guard, Officers of state
&amp; the Dignitaries of the Church lead the procession in great
solemnity out of the Church at which instant the Guns begin firing
from the Forts, Martial Musick playing &amp;c. Those people who did
not attend Mass, appear at their windows &amp; Doors, even the Sick
are brought to the window &amp; if any principal person, the
Procession stops opposite to the House of the sick, holding up the
Host, say</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 23]</p>

<p>a few prayers &amp; proceed; when they have paraded the Streets
of the Town, they return to the Church &amp; having placed the Host
from whence it was taken, they all repair to their respective
Houses &amp; pass the remainder of the day chearfully. It is
required of every person passing thro' the street at the time the
Host is going by, that they kneel &amp; uncover their head, the
latter of which is always expected from a Foreigner.</p>

<p>Sunday. 10th. Sailed from Santa Cruz &amp; after being becalm'd
two days between Teneriffe &amp; Grand Canaria, had the wind from
NW to NE. During these two days we had the Peak clear several
times. The peak is by some said to be a Volcano &amp; frequently to
issue stones &amp;c; An Officer who had resided in Santa Cruz a
considerable time, informed me that nothing but smoke had come from
it for several years &amp; that at very distant intervals; the
perpendicular height is computed by Dr. Heberden at 15396 feet; it
is not safe at all seasons to ascend the Peak the best time is in
the Months of July &amp; August; the snow at the foot being then
mostly dissolved: No one belonging to our Squadron went to it: the
oblique height is reckon'd at 15 miles: The officer beforementioned
also informed me that Oratavia, situated on the W. side of the
Island was originally a great place of Trade &amp; principal sea
Port, but from an Earthquake in 1704 the Port was fill'd up &amp;
the Anchoring ground left was scarcely such as would afford
security for</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 24]</p>

<p>one ship: The Town of Oratavia now stands on the spot where the
ships formerly Anchored; the ships that go there are now obliged to
keep in constant readiness to clear the land if the wind should
come on shore there not being any shelter. The Island of Teneriffe
is reckon'd 50 Miles in length &amp; 25 broad; As we sailed to the
S.o ward along the Island, the Town of Candelaria shew'd open'd to
us, it is near the sea &amp; by strangers may be mistaken for Santa
Cruz if they fall in to the S.o ward in making the Island; It is
not so large or is there a Church in it so conspicuous as that of
S.t Franciscan in Santa Cruz. It may also be known by the bearings
of the Peak if you see it; the peak over the S.o part of Santa Cruz
is WSW &amp; over Candelaria West by Compass, the land about &amp;
to the S.o ward of Candelaria is not so ragged as it is all about
&amp; to the N.o ward of Santa Cruz. The Marquis of Branceforte
Brigadier in the Spanish Service is the present Governor, An
Italian, &amp; very much esteem'd for his great Benevolence &amp;
many other excellent Virtues.</p>

<p>June. 15th. At Noon cross'd the Tropic of Cancer &amp; had the
Sun in the Zenith at nearly the same instant, Thermometer then at
74; the NE Trade seem'd to be fix'd.</p>

<p>17th. A large ship pass'd us to the No. ward, but not near
enough to distinguish what she was.</p>

<p>18th. In the evening drawing near the Isle of Sal, shorten'd</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 25]</p>

<p>sail &amp; kept the Supply ahead. AM. soon after day light saw
the Island of Sal bearing SWbS, pass'd along the East side of
it.</p>

<p>19th At 2 PM. Saw the Island of Bona Vista, at 4. the S.o end of
it bore due West 6 or 7 Mile; we pass'd along the E.t side of it
within a mile &amp; half of the reef: Brot too in the evening not
having run for the night to the Isle of May. In falling in with
these Islands (the weather is generally hazey) Sal may be known
from Bona Vista by the high Sugar Loaf Hill on the N.o end of it,
which being situated toward that end of the Island remains fixed as
you run along the East side, whereas in Bona Vista the highest land
forms a similar Sugar Loaf &amp; being towards the middle of the
Island, travels along the other land as you pass it.</p>

<p>We saw the Reef off this Island break very furiously &amp;
sailed along the E.t side of it within 1 ½ Mile of the breakers.
They appear to run from the land off the white sandhills &amp; when
the highest Sugar Loaf bears w½s you are nearly abreast the N.o
part of them, they extend some Miles along the Coast apparently at
the distance of 3 Miles from the shore: People who have fallen in
with this reef differ as to the situation of it; some place it off
the NE &amp; others off the SE part of the Island: The bearing
beforementioned of the high sugar loaf w½s appear'd to us in a line
with the N.o part of the breakers; several ships have narrowly
escaped being wreck'd upon this Reef, some</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 26]</p>

<p>from mistaking the Island &amp; others from supposing it did not
lay so far from the shore. The N.o end of Sal is in the Latitude
16º:50'N &amp; the S.o end 16º:40'N. Longitude by Timekeeper
23º:02'W. Variation Obs.d 11º:30'W. S.o end of Bona Vista by good
observation on board the Sirius 15º:59'N.o &amp; 23º:02'W by the
Timekeeper.</p>

<p>The 19th. at day light saw the Isle of May, the S. end NWbW 4
miles (at 4 PM the S.o end of Bona Vista bore N.78ºW pr Compass 6
mile, from which we ran swbs. 37 mile &amp; then brought too with
our Head off shore, after making Sail &amp; running 2 mile wbs saw
the Isle of May as beforementioned).</p>

<p>In passing the Isle of May you may run close along the E.t side
of it &amp; steer over west or w½s pr Compass for St. Iago which
course carried us in with that Island about 2 leagues to windward
port praya Bay. The latitude of the S.o end of May reduced back
from the next Noon is 15º:09'N &amp; 23º:07' W; at 10 AM saw the
Island of S.t Iago, in running along the coast of it to Port Praya,
there is the appearance of a Bay, but it cannot be mistaken for
Port Praya when the direction of the Coast is attended to, the land
from the E.t point of Praya Bay to the N.o ward lays nearly NNE
&amp; the whole land which opens to the W.ward of this point wbs or
w½s pr Compass: About Noon were standing in for Port Praya Bay,
when on hauling round the reef off the E.t point of the Bay, just
within it &amp; had the Fort open, were taken aback, the Convoy in
a</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 27]</p>

<p>cluster round us, no true wind blowing, but catspaws from every
point of the Compass &amp; a heavy swell setting in upon the shore,
which circumstances altogether render'd our getting in with the
Convoy very hazardous from the danger of falling on board each
other in such a swell as well that of being near the E.tern Reef,
it was therefore judged most safe to endeavor to get the Convoy
from the land into the true wind, which was done in about 2 Hours
&amp; we again proceeded with a fresh breeze at East.</p>

<p>Standing in for the E.t point of Praya Bay, the W. p.t will shew
itself as will the W. end of the Island; As you draw near the
E.tern reef Quail Island will shew itself as will the Fort which
stands on a high rock &amp; is on with Quail Island when bearing
N.o by Compass on which bearing a high round hill will partly be
over both. There are reefs which generally shew off both points of
the Bay. It is generally recommended to keep close in with the
Land, 'till you open the Reef of the W. point of the Bay &amp; then
haul close round the E.tern Reef Bring the Flagstaff NW or NW½N,
the E.t point EbS &amp; the outer point swbw from 10 to 7 fathom
water. It is not safe to lay in this Bay during the winter months;
so early as August Capt Wallis had very bad weather: Observed the
Lat.e of Port Praya on board the Sirius 14º:54'.N.o Longitude by
the Timekeeper 23º:40'W;</p>

<p>23.rd In Latitude 9º:48'N Longitude 23º:00'W lost the NE
Trade</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 28]</p>

<p>&amp; had frequent Squalls, variable winds with heavy rain
Thunder &amp; Light'ning: &amp; by the 25th it seem'd to have quite
blown itself out; the wind varying NE to SE, S.o, W. &amp;
frequently NW; then variable winds continued to the 28th when it
fix'd between the S.o &amp; SW., then in Lat: 7º:29'No Longitude
21º:41'W.</p>

<p>29th. AM. Saw a large ship to windward who bore down to us &amp;
hoisted Portuguese Colours, found her to be a ship from Lisbon
bound to the Coast of Brasil.</p>

<p>30th. PM after dark, a Devil Fish was hooked, as he lay on the
surface of the water, before he could be hoisted in 3 very large
sucking Fish were soon on him one of which was struck &amp; got in
&amp; was the largest I ever saw; it was 2Ft.:9In long. It being
dark when this Monster was got in, he was kept on the quarter deck
all night, but was dead as soon as out of the water from having had
several Harpoons &amp;c. stuck in him: In the morning 2 sucking
fish 7 inches long &amp; quite white were taken from within him out
at his mouth perfectly alive; when this Fish was open'd there was
not any thing found in his Stomach or Intestines or had he any
teeth: He had 5 Gills of each side evenly &amp; oppositely placed,
within which those white sucking fish had fixed themselves; the
belly of this Fish white, the back dark brown &amp; much resembling
a large skate; He had two horns projecting from the upper part of
the head just over his eyes.</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original

<p>Some of the people eat of this Fish but it was not thought good.
From the 29th to the 1st of July had the winds cheifly from the sw
with frequent squalls, heavy rains &amp;c which obliged us to keep
on to the E.t ward.</p>

<p>July. 2nd. PM. The wind came to S.o. Tack'd &amp; stood to the
Wt. ward, we found by the Timekeeper a very strong Easterly current
for some days past; The Portuguese ship which had sailed in Company
till now, parted, not being able even to keep up with our heavy
sailing Convoy.</p>

<p>July. 5th. The wind again coming to the ssw &amp; sw obliged us
to stand to the E.t ward. From this prospect of our making a
tedious passage, the Crews, Marines &amp; Convicts on board the
Transports were put to an allowance of 3 pints of water pr.
day.</p>

<p>The 6th. AM. Saw a sloop standing to the W.t ward.</p>

<p>The 7th. the wind again coming to the S.o ward we stood to the
W.t ward: we had been forced so far to the E.t ward as 18º:22'W.
when between the parallel of 9½º &amp; 5½ºN. by variable winds,
before we got</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 30]</p>

<p>what might any way be called the SE Trade which this day came on
at S.o &amp; SbE: In the evening spoke the sloop, from London bound
to Falkland Islands, 12 weeks from England &amp; 5 from the Isle of
May; they had been 3 weeks between the parallels of 9º &amp; 5ºN
with S.o &amp; SW winds.</p>

<p>Sunday. 8th. Saw a large ship coming down before the wind she
hoisted Portuguese Colours &amp; pass'd to the E.t ward without
passing near enough to speak her.</p>

<p>11th. An Albacore was struck, that weigh'd 80 lb. &amp; several
smaller We examined this &amp; several others Albacores &amp;
Bonetta's &amp; in both found the white appendage to the Heart
(which is generally allowed to be the reason for the Albacore
having that name) exactly the same &amp; not the Heart as supposed
by Seamen in general; it is closely connected to the Heart which is
considerably large &amp; of a dull reddish colour.</p>

<p>12th. The Master of the Lady Penryhne Transport brought on board
three of his people who had been guilty of Mutiny in refusing to
steer the Ship as directed by the Master, by which means she was
very far to leeward out of her station: they were kept on board the
Sirius &amp; three men sent in lieu to assist in working that
Ship.</p>

<p>15th. At 5 PM. Crossed the Equinoctial Line in Longitude 26º
West, Variation of the Compass 5º:50'W: Being now much favoured by
having the SE trade well to the E.t ward &amp; a prospect of</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 31]</p>

<p>making a quicker passage than could be supposed when the
allowance of water was reduced, it was this day increas'd to 2
quarts p day.</p>

<p>27th. Observed the Supply &amp; one of the Transports heave to
suddenly &amp; half an hour afterwards make sail, the Supply
informed us that the Alexander had lost a man overboard.</p>

<p>28th. PM. Blew strong from the ESE &amp; continued to the</p>

<p>29th AM when we again had the usual moderate weather &amp; the
wind from E.t to NE. This day we changed the variation from W.t to
E.t Latitude at the time the observation giving E.t variation was
taken, 18º:30'S. Long.e 32º W. Variation 0º:01'Et.</p>

<p>August. 2nd. Spoke a portuguese Brig bound to Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>3rd. at 3 PM. saw Cape Frio, W.t pr Compass 12 leagues; The NE
winds which had favoured since the 29th. Ul.t did not fail us until
we got under the Land to the W.t ward of Cape Frio which we did by
midnight, when it became light &amp; variable &amp; as usual in
these Climates alternately inclining from the Land &amp; sea. By
the preceding Meridian Observation we make the Cape in 23º:00'S.o
&amp; by the Timekeeper 41º:44'W. The Cape as we take it is the
outer point of the Island making in a saddle &amp; which lies to
the S.o ward a short distance off the p.t on the Mainland which the
portuguese call the Cape, the Coast to the N.o ward lies NNW &amp;
round Cape Frio it lays nearly E.t &amp; W.t more than 20 leagues
to Rio Janeiro, the land bold all the way, but</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 32]</p>

<p>the bottom is not all clear in many parts near the shore; It is
recommended to keep to the S.o ward till you are past a large bight
formed by the Cape Island &amp; the land to the NW, into which
there is often so strong a set as to make it dangerous, At Noon
Lat.de observed 23º:14'S.o Cape Frio NEbE½ E 12 leagues; W.t ern
Extreme W¾N, about 5 leagues from the Land abreast of us &amp; saw
the Land about the Harbour distinctly.</p>

<p>4th. In the evening Light airs from the land, we lay too all the
night endeavoring as the wind varied to keep her head to the W.twd.
we had from 42 to 47f.m water, oaze with shells &amp; one cast
47f.m fine sand, very black, our distance from the shore as near as
we could estimate was 4 leagues; At Noon. Latitude Obs. 23º:17'S.o
Sugar Loaf at the entrance of Rio Janeiro NWbW½W pr Compass 8 or 9
leagues.</p>

<p>Sunday. 5th. The False Sugar Loaf WNW½W 4 or 5 leagues, had
36f.m sand &amp; shells, Brot too for the night about 5 miles from
the land, sounded every hour 34, 33, 34f.m sand &amp; shells, At
day light found that we had drifted considerably to the E.t ward
&amp; scarce any in shore to the N.o ward, from which the soundings
appear to run regular from the shore.</p>

<p>Monday 6th. At 9 PM Anchored with the Convoy about 5 mile
without the entrance of Rio Janeiro in 13f.m water, found the
sounding regular, when anchored, the Island Raze SbW½W. Sugar Loaf
NW½N. the 2 payas in one NEbE &amp; Corkavado w½s by Compass. The
Harbour is easily found when the land is sufficiently clear</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 33]</p>

<p>to see the making of it: As you sail to the W.t ward you will
see a Sugar Loaf hill sloping to the W.t ward &amp; trenching away
to the E.t ward, this piece of land lies a small distance to the
E.t ward of the entrance; the land to the W.t ward is very
remarkable &amp; that near the W.t ern extremity is a very high
overhanging Mountain (called Corkavada) &amp; is about 2 leagues to
the W.t ward of the entrance: If the weather is clear you will see,
lying without it, Rodondo an Island round at top &amp; may be seen
a great distance in clear weather, It is SbW 7 Miles from the
entrance of Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>We pass'd Cape Frio at the distance of 6 Miles &amp; steerd wbs
by Compass, run 12 leagues &amp; shorten'd Sail, this course rather
carried us off the shore than in with it: when you have run this
distance or before, you will see two Islands (Maricas) off which
the ground is foul &amp; very unsafe to Anchor near, these Islands
are the first you meet with on the Coast between Cape Frio &amp;
Rio Janeiro, some of the land you pass has much the appearance of
an Island, but is not. As you proceed to the W. t ward &amp; after
seeing Rodondo, you will see another Island close to it (Raze)
which altho' not seen so soon as Rodondo it lays to the E.t ward of
it. It is generally recommen.d to steer for those Islands,
particularly if going in with Rio Janeiro after dark; By preserving
sight of one of them you may Anchor in a good Road within those
Islands in</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 34]</p>

<p>in 13f.m clear sandy bottom, bringing Raze S.o or SbW of you
&amp; not more than 2 Miles from it, you will then be about 5 miles
from the Harbour &amp; in a situation that will enable you in case
of bad weather coming on, to lead out to sea if the wind should be
such as would not admit of running for the Harbour which lies from
Raze N½E 6 or 7 miles. There are several Islands lying without the
Harbour between all of which are passages &amp; between Raze &amp;
Rodondo a very good one of 2 miles steep too on both sides; &amp;
between Rodondo &amp; a rock just off it is a passage for small
Vessels: There is also a passage between Paya &amp; Maya Islands on
the E.t side the Bay &amp; usually left on the starboard hand; the
Sugar loaf is just on the opening between these Islands when
bearing NWbW½W or WNW &amp; if under a necessity a Ship may with
safety run right thro' in for the Sugar Loaf; but unless press'd it
would be imprudent.</p>

<p>As you generally have Sea &amp; Land breezes, the best Pilotage
is to run well in with Rodondo &amp; Raze &amp; having open'd the
Harbour steer for it. You have good Anchoring ground &amp; regular
soundings within the Island Raze.</p>

<p>Monday 6: At day light, an officer was sent into the Harbour to
the Viceroy to inform him who we were &amp; the occasion of our
calling at this Port. At 11. he returned. The Viceroy very readily
consented to our being supplied with every necessary for the use of
the Convoy &amp; Convicts &amp;c...</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 35]</p>

<p>Tuesday. 7th. At 1 PM. the sea breeze set in, weigh'd &amp;
stood in for the Harbour, the Master of the Port came on board. It
being little wind we did not get off the E.t p.t of the entrance on
which stands Santa Cruz Fort till past 5, we saluted that Fort with
13 Guns which was immediately returned with an equal number, at 7.
Came too in 17f.m with the Supply &amp; Convoy off the City of S.t
Sebastians.</p>

<p>As you steer in for the Harbour, the water shoals gradually to 7
&amp; 6f.m just without &amp; nearly opposite the East p.t of the
entrance when it deepens suddenly to 18 &amp; 20 &amp; keeps from
20, 18 to 16 as you Sail up to S.t Sebastians: Ships generally go
higher up &amp; haul round the Island of Cobras which lies just off
the NE end of the Town; is well Fortified &amp; has Stores Houses
on it for the use of heavying down &amp; refitting Ships. If
necessity should require it a Ship may pass between the Sugar Loaf
&amp; the Island that lays just without it (Catumduba) as likewise
to the W.t ward of Square Island which lies on the entrance &amp;
is a Fortified Rock, this Channel is very narrow having a reef
runnning from the Wt point of the Island &amp; all found(?) ground;
It is most adviseable in all cases when it can be done to use the
direct passage from the Island Raze into the Harbor, for safety,
propriety &amp; expedition</p>

the Squadron &amp; Garrison paid respects to the Viceroy, they

<p>receiv'd with much kindness. The Viceroy contrary to the usual
custom, order'd that all the English Officers might be permitted to
go wherever they thought proper without being subject to those
restrictions complained of by Cap.n Cook in his first voyage &amp;
others who have visited Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>9th: Capn Phillip &amp; Mr Dawes went to look at a room which
had been granted for the purpose of making the necessary
Observations for the Timekeeper &amp;c., but it not being thought
proper for the purpose, Capn Phillip obtained leave from the
Viceroy to make use of an Island (Enradas) lying to the NE of the
Town, which spot being approved, a Tent was erected on the 11th
&amp; on the 12th the Instruments landed &amp; fixed under the
direction of M.r Dawes.</p>

<p>The 13th the Timekeeper was sent to the Tent &amp; all boats
belonging to the Transports strictly forbid landing on that

<p>Flag was hoisted on board the Sirius. On this day it is the
custom for all the Military to pay respects to the Viceroy &amp; a
general salute from all the Forts; Cap.n Phillip with the English
Officers paid the compliment of observing this custom &amp; by a
Royal Salute from the Sirius when their Forts saluted. The very
kind behaviour of the Vicveroy &amp; the great attention we
received from the Officers in general, was quite sufficient to make
every English Officer in that Port, rejoice at having an
opportunity of shewing respect to him &amp; them. The Guard Boat
attended our Squadron, apparently as matter of form, the Transports
boats were even permitted to land in any part of the Harbour or Bay
without being followed or in the smallest degree restricted by
them. Water is well supplied &amp; brought to the wharf fronting
the Palace in pipes &amp; led though spouts to the boat from which
you fill with a hose: Fresh Beef &amp; every refreshment to be
found in the climate we were here supplied with, the yams I think
exceed those of any other country I have ever seen, Oranges
astonishingly plenty &amp; so very cheap that the people in the
Guard boat would frequently amuse themselves with throwing some
hundreds to the Convicts in the different Transports from their
Boat.</p>

<p>We have proofs already of the great neglect in fitting the Ship,
Decks &amp; upper works so leaky as to make it necessary to employ
Caulkers on board, the skirting boards over the Copper were so
badly secured as to have been washed off on both sides; while the
Ship was on the heel to fix other skirting boards, we took the
opportunity of driving 2 bolts &amp; 2 spike nails of the white
composition 12 inches below the wale &amp; laid them over with
Copper, to try if the copper would make any impression on this
Composition.</p>

<p>31st. M.r Morton, Master of the Sirius was Invalided, having
receiv'd a hurt on the passage from Teneriffe which render'd him
for a time incapable of duty, this was a real loss to the ship He
being an attentive, active &amp; experienced man &amp; well
qualified for the station. M.r Seally &amp; Mr Rotton two of the
Master's Mates were also invalided their Health being in so bad a
state as to make it necessary &amp; there being an English Ship

England. Mr Kelty a Master in the Navy &amp; serving as mate on

we paid them on the Prince of Brazil's Birth day. When we were

almost every kind the Country produced were procured for Capt
Phillip, amongst which were the Cochineal, Coffee Jalup, Citron,
Tobacco, Cocoa, Oranges of different sorts, Limes sweet Lemons,

<p>To the 6th. we had light variable breezes, when it fixed at E.t
&amp; NE with a fresh gale which carried us into 26ºS.o &amp; 39ºW;
then changed to SW in a very hard squall with heavy rain.</p>

<p>Thunder &amp; Light'ning at 2 AM the 8th from which time until
the 20th had favorable winds, frequently shifting from No, NW to SW
&amp; S.o &amp; sometimes blowing strong.</p>

<p>20th: In Lat: 32º S.o..25º W. had the wind from SE to E.t.</p>

<p>On the 23rd NNE &amp; N.o from which point it blew strong
several hours &amp; suddenly shifted to the SW after we had got
further to the S.o ward. From the 23rd we had the wind alternately
NW &amp; SW, with short intervals of light breezes from the SE if
we got any thing to the N.o ward, which we lost again by keeping
more to the S.oward, a convincing proof I think that keeping to the
S.o ward is the best chance of making a passage to the E.t
ward.</p>

<p>Monday. 1st: At 8 AM pass'd the Meridian of Greenwich in
Latitude 34º:40'S.o.</p>

<p>6th. AM. The Alexander making the signal to speak us, Brot too
for her Boat; the Master of her &amp; one of the Marine Officers
came on board; We found that some part of the Crew of that ship had
leagued themselves with the Convicts to furnish them with materials
to endeavor to effect an escape at the Cape of Good Hope &amp; that
one of them had already furnish'd them with an Iron Crow for the
purpose; However impossible it might be for them to execute any
Plan of that nature, it was judged proper by Captain Phillip that
the ringleader &amp; 3 others of the Crew should be removed on
board the Sirius, which was immediately done &amp; 4 Seamen sent in
lieu to the Alexander to assist in working her: The Convict who
endeavor'd to escape at Teneriffe was the projector of the Plan, he
was then very heavily Iron'd &amp; now stapled down to the deck,
one of the Convicts whose life was in danger on board the Alexander
having given information of their plan, was removed to the
Scarborough.</p>

<p>Saturday. 13th. PM. The Supply was order'd a head during the
night, it being then intended to run in for the Land all night but
the wind increasing &amp; coming dead upon the shore, it was
thought best to bring too 'til day light, when we again made sail
&amp; at sunrise saw the Cape of Good Hope SEbE 10 leag.s... the
wind favoring us we anchored &amp; Moored in Table Bay with</p>

<p>the Supply &amp; Convoy the same evening: Green point N45ºW
Lions Rump S.85ºW Wharf. S.32ºW. Roben Island N8½ºW to N2ºW: in 6
f.m water BtBr. to the NE, small Bower to the SW 1 Mile from the
Cape Town.</p>

<p>An Officer was sent to the Governor, who assured us that we
should be supplied with every thing wanting as far as it could be
done; but that the opinion of the Council must be had before he
could answer the whole of our demand. The Governor assured the
Officer that our salute should be returned Gun for Gun by the Fort,
this was required in consequence of its having been customary here
for the Governor to order an Indiaman in the Bay to take up
salutes. At sunrise saluted the Fort w. 13 guns which was answer'd
by the same number from the Fort.</p>

<p>16th: Capn Phillip accompanied by the Officers paid respects to
the Governor, who shortly after returned the compliment at the
House where Capn Phillip lived &amp; invited all the English
Officers to dine with him the next day.</p>

<p>17th: Eight of the Main deck Guns were struck down in the Hold
&amp; the deck clear'd for the reception of Cattle, for which
purpose stalls, &amp;c. were built fore &amp; aft the deck just
leaving room to work the Cables.</p>

<p>In consequence of Cap.n Phillip having written to the Governor
to say that if He had not an immediate answer concerning the
Supplies for us, that he must take such steps as would enable</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 43]</p>

<p>us to proceed without them.</p>

<p>An order was given the 23rd to supply all our demands; All the
Staves, Hoops &amp;c. were now collected from the different Ships
in addition to those of the Sirius, that as much Water, Flour,
Spirits &amp; every article for the people &amp; Cattle might be
taken as could possibly be stowed.</p>

<p>25th: A Danish Indiaman arrived from China, she left 2 French
Kings Ships at Macao that had been on discoveries out round Cape
Horn, among the Islands &amp; had then returned from the N.o ward
as far as they could penetrate.</p>

<p>28th: The women Convicts on b.d the Friendship were removed on
board the Charlotte, P.re of Wales &amp; Lady Penryhne &amp; those
cabins which they occupied were fitted for sheep.</p>

<p>November 1st. Arrived the Ranger East India Packet from England:
Sailed in August, brought an account of our having a Fleet of
Observation ready, under the Command of Commodore Leveson Gower
&amp; that affairs in Europe were in a very unsettled state
occasioned by dissentions in Holland.</p>

<p>The 6th this Packet sailed for Bengal.</p>

<p>Saturday. 10th. The Cattle &amp; every thing being on board,
Unmoored &amp; dropt farther out into the Bay as did most of the
Convoy.</p>

<p>13th: At 2 PM weigh'd &amp; made sail, Supply &amp; Convoy in
C.o with a fresh Gale from the S.o ward: At 6 spoke the Kent of
London 4 months from England had been Whaling in St Helena Bay. As
we ran out to the N.o ward of Roban Island, we passed</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 44]</p>

<p>the shoal part of it in 7f.m, the Borrowdale at the same time ½
a Cable's length within us; While we lay in Table Bay Fresh
Provisions, Loaves &amp; Vegetables were supplied every day to the
Seamen, Marines &amp; Convicts.</p>

<p>The quantity of Cattle &amp;c. taken on board the Sirius, was
that of the Governors, there only being a Bull, a Bull Calf 3 Cows
&amp; 2 Rams on board her of the Publick Stock, the other part of
which was on board the Fishburne, Borrowdale &amp; Friendship &amp;
was only 40 Sheep, 1 Ram 26 Sows, 2 Boars &amp; 4 Goats. The Lady
Penryhne had on board 1 Stallion 3 Mares &amp; their Colts &amp;
were all again w. foal. The Golden Grove was appropriated to the
use of other Individuals.</p>

<p>The following is an account of a Malay who just before our
arrival, had thrown the whole Cape Town into the utmost confusion
by running a Muck.</p>

<p>This horrible desperado was a Native of Batavia &amp; a person
of some consequence among his Countrymen, but was banished to the
Cape of Good Hope for some Crime which he had committed, &amp;
because the Governor would not permit him to return to Batavia he
became exasperated with revenge &amp; in order to enable himself to
put it into execution, He worked himself up into a phrensy by
smoking Opium; then armed himself with a variety of weapons, rush'd
forth in the dusk of the evening, Killed or wounded every Man</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 45]</p>

<p>who was unfortunate enough to fall in his way; He stabbed the
Centinel at the Gate of the Company's Gardens &amp; taking his Post
waited in expectation of seeing the Governor come out, who narrowly
escaped the fate intended for him by its falling on another person
who accidentally came that way. On being pursued he fled with
incredible swiftness to the Table Mountain where he remained two
days, still raging from the effects of Opium &amp; defeated every
person who was sent to take him alive; for two days none dare stir
from within doors, neither Master nor Slave, for the Governor had
given an Order, as the most likely manner of destroying him should
he appear in the Town; That whatever Malay was seen was to be
killed by the Soldiers.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day he was taken alive on the Table
Mountain; doing much injury in resisting those who took him. He was
taken immediately to the place of Execution, where he suffer'd a
lingering &amp; horrid death. He was broken alive on the Wheel, His
Head &amp; Limbs were sever'd from his body &amp; distributed in
different parts of the Country.</p>

<p>He killed 14 Inhabitants &amp; double that number badly wounded.
It was remark'd that his madness fell only on Men; Women passed him
unhurt &amp; it was as extraordinary as unfortunate that, amongst
those which his rage destroyed, were some of the most deserving
&amp; promising young Men in the Town. This madness is called at
Batavia running a Muck, &amp; has</p>

<p class="caption">'Cape Town, Table Mountain etc. Sirius &amp;
Convoy in Table Bay, November. 1787'</p>

<p>happened there several times, but was the first Instance ever
known at the Cape.</p>

<p>The Government of the Cape is vested in a Governor &amp; Council
together with a Court of Justice: The Members of the Council are,
the Governor, Lieut Governor, Commanding Officer of the Troops
&amp; four of the Council, with these all regulations for the
management of the Colony Originate; &amp; from them all Orders
&amp; Decrees Issue; The Council of Justice is composed of the
Fiscal &amp; 12 Members. The Fiscal, who is the first Officer of
Justice is Independent, He hears all causes &amp; prescribes all
punishments. He has People under his directions, who constantly
patrole the streets armed, for the apprehending all disorderly
persons; Every 14 days Offences are tried. The Punishments
inflicted here, are Breaking upon the Cross, upon the Wheel
impalements, flogging to that degree that Death is frequently the
effects of its severity; Over the door of a small wooden House,
wherein are kept the Instruments of Execution, is the following
Inscription, in Latin:</p>

<p>("Happy is the Man whom other Mens misfortunes make wary.")</p>

<p>In this Town are two Churches, One for the Calvinists the other
for the followers of Martin Luther; in the former is a neat &amp;
handsome Organ; the Women sit in Chairs in the body of the Church,
the men in pews round the sides. Marriage Ceremonies are performed
on Sunday only &amp; the parties dress'd in Black.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 47]</p>

<p>13th At 7 PM. Took our Departure from the Lions Rump bearing
S39ºE 6 leagues, the wind continuing at S.o and SbE obliged us to
stand on to the westward; the rate of the Timekeeper by
Observations during our stay in Table Bay was determined at losing
3",17 p.r day.</p>

<p>It is generally recommended to Ships sailing from Table Bay, to
go out to the N.o ward of Robin Island, as there is frequently a
strong set down upon the rocks which lie off the SE. side of it
&amp; being very liable to get be-calmed under the high land on the
S.o side of Table Bay, it is thought dangerous to attempt that
passage unless the wind is well to the N.o ward of East.</p>

<p>Going into Table Bay, it is best to keep well to the S.o ward to
prevent being driven down on those rocks: You may haul close round
Green Point in 7, 6 or 5f.m water: after you pass Green Point, if
the wind should be from SE, you must be cautious not to stand very
far over on the NE side of the Bay, there being a great deal of
foul ground &amp; shoal water on that shore. There is much foul
ground in the Bay, which may easily be avoided, unless a great
number of Ships are in the Bay, You must pass the outermost Fort
before you have clear ground, and</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 48]</p>

<p>when the Sugar Loaf is half way between that &amp; the New Fort,
you may anchor in any depth under 12f.m clear ground. The berth I
would chuse for a large Ship, is, the Sugar Loaf directly over the
New Fort in 8 or 9f.m water. There is good anchorage under Robin
Island, should you be going in the N.o passage &amp; baulked by a
shift of wind &amp;c:</p>

<p>Thursday. 15. The wind coming to the westward of South at 9 AM
Tack'd &amp; stood to the E.t ward, but in a few hours it backing
again to SbE &amp; SSE obliged us again to stand to the westward.
Went to an allowance of 2 quarts of water p.r day each Man. This
day, Captain Phillip made known his intentions of proceeding to
Botany Bay in the Supply when we were to the eastward of the Cape
of Good Hope &amp; that one of the Lieutenants of the Sirius should
go with him, this was proposed to me &amp; immediately accepted,
but Cap.t Hunter objecting to the First Lieutenant being taken out
of the Ship, Cap.t Phillip order'd the 2nd. Lieu.t to be ready to
accompany him.</p>

<p>Monday. 19th. Being Calm all day, the luggage of Captain Phillip
&amp;c. was put on board the Supply as were eleven Artificers
belonging to the Sirius, that every thing might be ready when the
Governor should leave the Sirius: We received 9 Men from the
Supply.</p>

<p>20th: Officers &amp; Ships Companies put to an allowance of
three</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 49]</p>

<p>pints of water p day; AM. At 8 after being Calm &amp; breeze
sprung up at NNE which at last enabled us to steer to the E.t ward,
after having been carried into the Longitude of 10½ºE by S.o &amp;
SE winds without having it once in our power to stand to the E.t
ward more than 2 hours, a great number of whales, several close
alongside the Ship.</p>

<p>Sunday. 25th. AM. Made those Ships Signals that were to proceed
ahead; at 11, Capt Phillip, L.t King, &amp; L.t Dawes of the
marines belonging to the Sirius went on board the Supply, to which
Ship the Timekeeper was removed from the Sirius. Major Ross with
the Adjutant went on board the Scarborough Transport which Ship
with the Friendship was to proceed under the Command of L.t
Shortland Agent of Transports in the Alexander.</p>

<p>At Noon, They all parted Company leaving the Sirius to follow
with the heavy sailing Ships (3 Transports &amp; 3 Store Ships)
Latitude 38º:47S.o Long.e [indecipherable word] 25º:53'E.t
Timekeeper 22º:36' E.t</p>

<p>Next day [26th] at Noon the Supply was in sight from the Mast
H.d bearing SEbE &amp; the Agents Division SE 6 mile: Finding that
we had been carried considerably to the N.o ward, we alter'd the
Course to the S.o ward &amp; in the afternoon the Supply &amp;
Agents Division were out of sight.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="dec87" id="dec87"></a>December

<p>Saturday. December 8th: Lat: 40º:21'S.o Long.e 53º:07' E.t had
32º:12'W. Variation which was the greatest we had: The 13th Cross'd
the Meridian of Kergulans Land in Latitude 40º:58'.S. &amp; the
16th about</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 50]</p>

<p>Noon, that of S.t Pauls in Latitude 41º:08', between the Cape of
Good Hope &amp; these Islands we kept the parallels of 39, 40 &amp;
41 as we approached: from an Idea of preserving clear weather by
not running near either of those Islands, in this we were very
successful, not having any Fogs &amp; very little thick weather
&amp; continued fair wind, shifting frequently from SSW to W, NW
&amp; N.o &amp; sometimes blowing strong for a few hours, in
general a steady fresh Gale.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 19th. The wine being out, our allowance was order'd a
Quart of Grog &amp; a Quart of water p. day.</p>

<p>Sunday. 23rd: Saw a Sea Otter, he followed the ship a
considerable time: the haze round the Horizon this afternoon had
much the appearance of Land being near. AM a great number of Whales
were seen about the Ship.</p>

<p>31st: Expecting to have Strong winds as we approach'd the Land,
Bent a new Foresail, Fore &amp; Main Top Sails,, which was not done
a day too soon, the New Year came in with a Hard Gale at WNW, which
lasted only a few Hours: In the space of half an hour while the
Squalls were violent, the Barometer rose &amp; fell 8 times, from
29.36 to 29.63.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jan88" id="jan88"></a>January 1788</p>

<p>Jan.y 5th. Having had several very good sets of Observations of
the [sun] &amp; [moon] &amp; supposing they would be the last
before seeing the Land, at 4 PM. Made sig.l for the Convoy to come
our stern &amp; observe the Longitude in by Observation;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 51]</p>

<p>135º:30' East the Longitude at Noon was shewn to them. This
night a luminous appearance or substance was seen, &amp; very
different from what I ever heard of being noticed by any one: they
resemble lights floating on the surface of the water &amp;
disappear when turn'd as the sea washed over them, they keep the
same appearance when close alongside as at a distance; several of
them passed close to us as the Ship run through them; &amp; were
seen on the surface more than a mile ahead; we endeavor'd without
success to get some of them, they immediately got the name of
Pursers Lanthorns.</p>

<p>Sunday. 6. At 11 PM. The Aurora Australis was very bright, with
many beautiful red streamers which appear'd to run from about 45º
of Al.t to the clouds that were in that part of the Horizon, it was
seen very faint some nights before.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 8th. At ½ p.t 1 PM. Saw Van Diemans Land, we were only
8 weeks from the Cape of Good Hope &amp; since the 23rd of November
on which day we regained the meridian of that Cape after having
been forced 9º to the W.ward, we had scarce an hour foul wind; but
even this good fortune was not enough to preserve the Cattle on
board the Sirius, which were so badly provided for as to be nearly
starved, three of the Cows calved on the passage the whole of which
died, the Cows having scarce sufficient to keep themselves alive,
could not support the young; One of the Cows big with calf also
died before we made the Land.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 52]</p>

<p>At 2. PM. Saw the Mewstone N36ºE by Compass 4 or 5 leagues We
were in Latitude 44º:04'S.o &amp; stood in NE: at 4 passed the
Mewstone about 6 mile to the S.o ward of it; at 5 Saw the Eddystone
to the E.t ward of Swilly, the whole space between those Rocks
appear'd from the Mast Head to be full of broken water &amp; some
tops of rocks shewing themselves above the Surface; we stood on for
the South Cape &amp; pass'd it at 2 or 3 Mile distance; we now
steer'd ENE &amp; pass'd to the N.o ward of Swilly at 9 or 10 Miles
distance. We made the Mewstone within 5 Miles as laid down by
Captain Cook. By the mean result of all the Observations taken on
b.d the Sirius by Captain Hunter &amp; Myself we reduce the p.t of
this land, as follows</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p>The p.t of the SW Cape we were at a loss to determine, but
concluded it must be that which makes like the Ramhead of Plymouth
&amp; particularly so from the situation of the Mewstone.</p>

<p>Between the SW &amp; S.o Capes we saw many Islands, High rocks
&amp; the appearance of Harbors from the double landma[rks] behind
the Coast &amp; the Islands lying off it: One particularly when the
Mewstone bore N14ºE by Compass, seem'd to be</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 53]</p>

<p>formed by low land to the W.ward making in a bluff &amp; has the
appearance of an Island with a very remarkable rock just open of it
bearing N.o; as we passed along the same appearance of a Harbour
continued altho' the bearings of the Mewstone &amp; Rock
beforementioned had been alter'd some points; as we got to the
E.tward of it, the low bluff Island appear'd to be very near or a
part of the W.t side of the Harbour which it form'd &amp; 2 small
Islands were seen lying off, what might be term'd the entrance of
the Bay which from the double lands seem'd to branch off in two
arms, one to the NE &amp; the other NW.</p>

<p>We much lamented it not being in our power to determine this, or
ascertain the situation of the points of land with each other by
keeping close in shore, which one could have done as we had the
wind, but having a Convoy of heavy sailing Ships with us it would
have been dangerous.</p>

<p>This appearance of a Harbour which we so particularly noticed
lies to the W.tward of the peak'd Hill &amp; appears to be formed
on the E.t side by the land under a remarkable ragged high hill to
the W.tward of the Peak, when that Hill bears from NNE to N.o &amp;
when it bears NW the whole appearance of the Bay is shut in by a
point projecting from the land to the Westward.</p>

<p>The land in general is moderately high, the Coast rocky &amp;
apparently steep too; the Country in land from the SW Cape appears
barren, we did not see a Tree between it &amp; the land about the
S.o Cape, the top part of which &amp; all the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 54]</p>

<p>land to the E.tward is coverd with Trees thick together, some
growing a considerable height before they Branch. The Coast about
the S.o Cape is a dark rock &amp; towards the pitch of it, has a
large notch, which shews when you are to the W.tward of it; there
appears just to the E.tward of this point another projecting point
cover'd with trees, but the land between falling rather to the
N.oward, I set down the first as the S.o Cape of Van Dieman[s]
Land, a little to the W.tward of which is a very remarkable white
patch in the rocks near the Sea.</p>

<p>The Peak'd Hill is also a good mark for knowing the S.o Cape,
but I do not know a better, than, that there are not any high trees
on the Hills to the W.tward of it that we could see.</p>

<p>The wind continued Wterly all day very fresh &amp; fell little
wind in the evening at 10 It was variable mostly between the N.o
&amp; E.t We had luckily got to the E.tward of Swilly when the
W.terly wind left us &amp; being well in with the Main Land were
enabled to carry the Convoy clear to the E.tward of all danger from
the Rocks of Swilly &amp; the Eddystone, both of which we saw the
next morning at day light, both in one bearing WSW 4 or 5
leagues.</p>

<p>As we pass'd along the shore after dark, Fires were seen to the
E.tward of &amp; about the S.o Cape &amp; between the S.o &amp; SW
Capes. We saw Snow on the high peak'd Hill as we passed.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 9th. At 7 AM The wind changed in a hard Squall

round hill a little to the N.owd of it; but it is necessary to
observe that there are two Islands near it &amp; that the Land to
the N.oward of the red land forming the point, is very white.</p>

<p>Sunday. 20th: At 2 PM. Saw the white cliffs mention'd by Cap.n
Cook to be 10 miles to the S.oward of Botany Bay; I do not
altogether think it a certain mark for knowing when you are near
Botany Bay, there being many white Sand Hills that shew like Cliffs
coming up the Coast; the land from these White Cliffs to the
N.oward is tolerably even.</p>

<p>At 4. Saw the entrance of Botany Bay, appearing in the middle of
land that shew'd like an Island lying a small distance from the
shore, We saw the neck of land by which it is joined to the other
land when 8 or 9 miles to the S.oward of the entrance of Botany
Bay, it has a sandy beach, the shore cover'd with wood, in the
sandy beach is the appearance of a Gully or opening.</p>

<p>The land about the entrance of Botany Bay appears in hummocks
&amp; Rocky; &amp; with a Glass pt Solander, the S.o point of the
Bay may be seen like a perpendicular notch cut in the rocks near
the middle of the land, like an Island.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 58]</p>

<p>Those cliffs 10 miles to the S.oward of Botany Bay make in 5
cliffs as you come near abreast of them &amp; the Portsdown clump
of Trees is on the N.omost of them when bearing W.t soon after
which, that clump loses its remarkable appearance.</p>

<p>At Sun Set, the entrance of Botany Bay bore N.19ºW 7 or 8 Mile
shorten'd Sail &amp; made the Signal for the Convoy to pass in
succession within hail, they were order'd to be very attentive
during the night &amp; to keep their Stations strictly when we made
sail in the morning: AM. At day light made sail for the Bay with a
mod.t breeze at SE &amp; when within about 2 miles of the S.o Head
saw the Supply in the Bay &amp; soon after the 3 Transports that
had been dispatch'd under the Command of the Agent.</p>

<p>The Master of the Supply came on board as we approach'd the
entrance, He informed us that they had only been arrived two days
&amp; the Agent one day before us &amp; the heavy ships; at 8.
Anchored with the Convoy in Botany Bay &amp; moored
immediately.</p>

<p>p.t Solander SSE }</p>

<p>Cape Banks ESE} in 8 f.m water.</p>

<p>We found that the Governor had without much difficulty met some
of the Natives on the N.o side of the Bay &amp; after convincing
them of his good intentions, they receiv'd some trifling presents
from him which they handed to each other without much concern. They
were quite naked &amp; had</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 59] 1788. January. much the appearance of
being well disposed toward us. We saw 8 of them setting on the
rocks as we came into the Bay, they called to us, some of them
walked along the Shore &amp; others kept setting on the rocks: The
Boats met with Natives in every part of the Bay but no women had
yet been seen.</p>

<p>Captain Hunter went on board the Supply to the Governor &amp;
with him visited the South Shore taking a Guard of Marines with
them. Near the place the Governor landed at, we saw several of the
Natives in small parties of two, three &amp; five together,
frequently advancing &amp; again retreating; The Governor advanced
by himself &amp; laid down some presents for them then retired, one
of the Natives immediately advanced, picked it up &amp; handed it
to the others apparently pleas'd, by Noon we saw that our People
&amp; the Natives were mixed together, the Boat Crews amused
themselves with dressing the Natives w paper &amp; other whimsical
things to entertain them, with which they were pleas'd for the
moment.</p>

<p>Monday. 21. PM. An Officer &amp; party of Men were sent from the
Sirius to clear away to a run of water on the S.o side of the Bay:
The Natives were well pleas'd with our People until they began
clearing the Ground at which they were displeased &amp; wanted them
to be gone; At sun set when the Boats left the shore, several of
the Natives came down to the water side &amp; then went to their
Huts. Mr King returned</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 60]</p>

<p>having been up an inlet on the S.o side 5 miles; He found the
Country something better than what it was round the Bay but not any
water; Mr King seeing some Natives on a point of land, he backed
the Boat to them to endeavor to have some intercourse with them,
One of the Natives threw a Spear at which all the rest seem'd much
displeas'd, after which they came close to the Boat &amp; were
quite friendly; they expressed a wish to know whether the People in
our Boat were Men or Women &amp; made themselves understood by
bringing some of their women down, pointing to themselves, our
people &amp; the women alternately, who as the Men were entirely
naked, they were immediately satisfied in this particular by one
person in the Boat which served to convince them all were the
same.</p>

<p>The Natives that appear'd on the N.o side the Bay express'd the
same wish of knowing whether our People were Men or Women, after
being satisfied on that head, one of them ran in amongst the
Bushes, made himself a Belt of Grass &amp; came dancing out with it
round his waist with leaves hung over it; they were much inclin'd
to steal any kind of Cloth or covering &amp; did steal some bags
which were sent on shore for Hay. AM. At day light the Governor,
Captain Hunter, the Master of the Sirius &amp; Supply went in the
Long boat &amp; 2 Cutters, to look into Port Jackson, not</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 61]</p>

<p>finding any situation at Botany Bay fit for settling &amp;
particularly from Ships in the Bay being so much exposed to the Sea
in bad weather as to render their situation very dangerous. Mr King
&amp; Mr Dawes were again sent up the Inlet to determine as near as
they could the extent of it.</p>

<p>Major Ross attended the operations on shore &amp; as our
settling here was not yet determined on; it was not judged proper
to land any of the Convicts but the necessary works were carried on
by the Marines &amp; Seamen. Two of the Seamen on the N.o shore
straggling into the woods without Arms or any thing to protect
themselves sailor like, met with some Natives, Men, Women &amp;
Children who very very friendly, met them without fear &amp;
eagerly accepted of a Jacket which one of the Sailors gave them,
they were all entirely naked.</p>

<p>22nd: Clearing the Ground on the S.o side the Bay it appear'd
worse the lower we went down &amp; in digging a sawpit, the whole
depth of it was little else but sand, &amp; swamps all round. Some
Dogs were seen with the Natives that came amongst us.</p>

<p>When the Sein was hauled this evening, several of the Natives
were by &amp; when they saw the quantity of Fish brought on shore
at once were much astonished which they expressed by a loud &amp;
long shout, they took some of the Fish, (which the Officer
permitted) &amp; ran away directly; Some of the Officers going to
that part of the Wood, to which they retreated occasioned</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 62]</p>

<p>them to stop &amp; make signs that they did not like to be
followed, on which they were left to themselves to walk off with
their Fish: We met with more success with the Sein than before; in
a Cove round the point just within Bare Island; In this Cove we
found better water &amp; easier to be got at than any place we had
yet tried.</p>

<p>Mr King &amp; M.r Dawes returned after having been by their
account about 12 Miles up the W.tern Inlet without being able to
determine how much further it run.</p>

<p>AM. None of the Natives appear'd on the S.o side, but a great
number on the N.o shore, they struck the Fish as the Sein was
hauled ashore with their Spears &amp; ran off with them sensible
that what they had done was wrong.</p>

<p>23rd: PM. A Black man was landed among the working Party with
whom the Natives were much pleas'd &amp; seem'd astonished that he
did not understand them, they wished him to stay with them &amp;
followed the Boat that he was in as far as they could, as the Boat
left the shore they retired apparently as well satisfied as if the
Man of their own Complexion had remained with them.</p>

<p>A great number of rats were seen &amp; a flying Squirrel: The
Natives we met with here were of the middle size, men wore their
beards long, their hair much clotted with dirt, they appear a
straight well limbed people &amp; very active; The weapons</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 63]</p>

<p>they had with them were either a Spear, a Lance for striking
Fish or a Club; Most of those we had seen, have lost one of their
fore teeth, apparently drawn or punch'd out, &amp; altho' few were
seen with the Bone or Stick across the nose as mentioned by Capn
Cook; they had most of them the Hole through the nose. They all
expressed great curiousity as to our Sex having our beards shaved
&amp; being clothed they could not tell what to take us for.</p>

<p>24th: P.M. The Governor with the Boats return'd from the
N.oward, having discover'd Port Jackson to be an exceeding fine
Harbour with many Coves all forming Inner Harbours, the Soil far
preferable to that at Botany Bay &amp; in some parts a good Soil
&amp; well supplied with water. These discoveries at once
determined the Governor to remove the Ships as soon as possible
&amp; proceed himself in the Supply immediately, for which purpose
a proportion of Convicts &amp; Guard of Marines were order'd to go
with the Supply.</p>

<p>AM. At Day light, Two strange sail appear'd in the Offing which
prevented the Governor proceeding in the Supply, He wishing to know
what they were first: The wind blowing strong off the land, they
lost ground every tack &amp; were too far out for a Boat to venture
to them; we perceived their Colours to be French at their nearest
approach.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 64]</p>

<p>Friday. 25th. The Transports were reported ready to proceed with
the Sirius, The French Ships were out of sight at 6 O'Clock. We
received the Timekeeper from the Supply where it had unfortunately
been let down on the passage to this place.</p>

<p>AM. The Supply got under sail with 2 Long boats, at 6 the signal
was made for the Convoy to get under weigh which most of them did,
the flood tide ran so strong that they fell to leeward on which the
signal was made to Anchor. The Supply after having made several
Tacks in the entrance of the Bay, finding the Tide too strong, Bore
away &amp; came in again. At 9 she weigh'd, at 10 made the signal
&amp; weigh'd with the Convoy, but coming on very thick &amp; the
Golden Grove having parted her Cable, at Noon, made the signal
&amp; anchor'd again; The Supply clear without the Heads.</p>

<p>Saturday. 26th: PM. The weather too thick to move the Convoy.
AM. At day light Fine weather with a moderate breeze at SE: The
French Ships standing in for the Bay, An Officer was sent on board
of them, found them to be the Boussole &amp; Astrolabe, French
Kings Ships on Discoveries; Had been to the N.oward, &amp; called
at Kamschatka &amp; China: last from the Navigators Islands.</p>

<p>As soon as the tide made out of the Bay, weigh'd with the
Convoy: At Noon, working out of the Bay.</p>

<p>Sunday. 27th: At 1 PM. were clear of the Bay &amp; steer'd for
Port</p>

<p class="caption">'Entrance of Port Jackson 27 Janury 1788'</p>

<p>Jackson, At 3. Seeing that all the Convoy were out, made Sail
&amp; at 4, were within the Heads of Port Jackson, up which Harbour
we ran about 5 Miles &amp; Anchored at the entrance of the Cove in
which the Supply was lying &amp; where the Marines &amp; Convicts
that came in here were encamped; the Convoy all anchored in &amp;
off the Cove before dark.</p>

<p>The entrance of Port Jackson is about 10 miles to the N.oward of
Botany Bay &amp; is some dis.ce within the N.o extreme of land in
sight when without the Bay, the best mark to know when you draw
near it coming from the S.oward, is, some remarkable sandhills over
a sandy Bay 2 or 3 miles to the S.oward of the S.o Head, the shore
from this Bay to the S.o Head is High rocky cliffs.</p>

<p>Monday. 28th: All the Carpenters &amp; Artificers belonging to
the Sirius &amp; Convicts were employed clearing away the Ground
round the encampment. AM. Went with Cap Hunter, the Master &amp;
one of the Mids about surveying the Harbour: On a point of land in
the lower part of the Harbour, between Middle Head &amp; Bradley
point we saw several of the Natives on the upperpart of the rocks
who made a great noise &amp; waved to us to come on shore, there
being a great surf we could not land at the Point we wished, which
they observing, pointed to the best place to land &amp; came down
unarm'd to meet us, we of course landed</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 66]</p>

<p>unarm'd, taking care that arms were ready for us at a moments
notice; Having some angles to measure from this point, two of the
Officers went to the outer p.t of the rocks for that purpose, the
others remained with the Natives who were all much disposed to good
humour &amp; pleased with us.</p>

<p>On our landing we observed some women at the place the Men came
down from, they would not come near us, but peep'd from behind the
rocks &amp; trees; when the Boats put off, the Men began dancing
&amp; laughing &amp; when we were far enough off to bring the place
the Women were at in sight, they held their arms extended over
their heads, got on their legs &amp; danced 'till we were some
distance, then followed us upon the rocks as far as the Boats went
along that shore:</p>

<p>In course of the forenoon we went to a Cove within the Inner S.o
Head (Camp Cove) where we were cordially received by 3 Men, who
left their women sitting in a Canoe at the other end of the beach,
we made a fire on shore &amp; dined in the Boats, while our people
were cooking the dinner, the natives were amongst them playing,
looking at the Boat, manner of Cooking &amp;c. &amp; were without
any weapons the whole time, they laid their Spears down on the sand
between the women &amp; the place they met us at; when we left them
&amp; rowing towards the point where the women were they got out of
the Canoes &amp; ran into the woods, the Men followed us along the
shore.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 67]</p>

<p>Tuesday. 29th: Landing'd on a point forming the NW or Middle
Branch to which we were followed by several of the Natives along
the rocks, having only their sticks which they use in throwing the
Lance, with them, A Man followed at some distance with a bundle of
Lances; they pointed with their sticks to the best landing place
&amp; met us in the most chearful manner, shouting &amp; dancing,
the women kept at a distance near the Man with the Spears, this
mark of attention to the women in shewing us, that altho' they met
us unarmed, that they had Arms ready to protect them, increas'd my
favourable opinion of them very much; some of these people having
peices of tape &amp; other things tied about them, we conclude them
to be some of those people whom the Governor had met here before,
these people mixed with ours &amp; all hands danced together.</p>

<p>From here we went to Grotto point, Moored the Boats for the
night &amp; made a Tent Fore &amp; Aft the Longboat, in which we
all slept.</p>

<p>AM. Went over to Shell Cove &amp; left this Branch, taking it as
reported by those who examined it when the Boats first came into
this Harbour; as we left this branch we met several Canoes with one
Man in each of them, they had so much confidence in us as to come
close alongside our Boats. After fixing the place of the Rock &amp;
extent of the shoal water round it we went into the North Arm. As
we were going in to the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 68]</p>

<p>first Cove on the E.t side called Spring Cove; we were joined by
3 Canoes with one Man in each, they hauled their Canoes up &amp;
met us on the beach leaving their Spears in the Canoes, we were
soon joined by a dozen of them &amp; found three amongst them with
trinkets &amp;c. hanging about them, that had been given to them a
week before by the Governor on his first visit to this place.</p>

<p>Our people &amp; these mixed together &amp; were quite sociable,
dancing &amp; otherwise amusing them, One of our people combed
their hair with which they were much pleased; several women
appear'd at a distance, but we could not prevail on the Men to
bring them near us;</p>

<p>We had here an opportunity of examining their Canoes &amp;
Weapons, the Canoe is made of the bark taken off a large Tree of
the length they want to make the Canoe, which is gather'd up at
each end &amp; secured by a lashing of strong Vine which runs
amongst the underbrush, one was secured by small line, they fix
spreaders in the inside, the paddles are about 2 feet long in shape
like a pudding stirrer, these they use one in each hand &amp; go
along very fast setting with their legs under them &amp; their
bodies erect &amp; altho' they do not use outriggers I have seen
them paddle through a large Surf without oversetting or taking in
more water than if rowing in smooth water; from their construction
they are apt to leak when any weight is in them, the Man nearest
that part of the Canoe</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 69]</p>

<p>where the water lies, heaves it out behind him with a peice of
wood in the hollow of his hand still keeping his body erect as when
rowing, they are by far the worst Canoes I ever saw or heard of; I
have seen some so small as 8 feet long &amp; others twice that
length; In these Canoes they will stand up to strike fish at which
they seem expert.</p>

<p>The lances which they had here with them, were, One sort about
12 feet in length with 4 barbed prongs made of bone &amp; fastened
on to the prong by a stiff Gum, these 4 prongs are secured to the
stick &amp; spread equally, about a foot in length; A smaller one
of the same kind &amp; one with a single stick barbed at &amp;
above the point, the long spears are indented at the end, for to
receive a peg which is fixed on a stick 2 or 3 feet long &amp;
which they apply to throw the lance any considerable distance, the
other end of this stick has a sharp, hard shell fixed on it which
serves for opening shell fish, getting them off the rocks &amp;
various other purposes.</p>

<p>The Governor's plan with respect to the Natives, was, if
possible to cultivate an acquaintance with them without their
having an Idea of our great superiority over them, that their
Confidence &amp; Friendship might be more firmly fixed: we could
not persuade any of them to go away in the Boat with us.</p>

<p>Having occasion to measure another Base line we landed at the
upper part the N.o arm for that purpose, while we were about it 2
of the Natives came down seem'd pleas'd to meet</p>

<p class="caption">'First interview with the Native Women at Port
Jackson New South Wales'</p>

<p>us &amp; much astonish'd at what we were doing, there people
pass'd on to the place where our fire was &amp; mixed with our
people, they were neither of them armed; soon after &amp; as we
were going along the beach a Man &amp; a very old Woman met us,
they stoped with us a short time &amp; then walk'd on to the place
our People were at; this was the first Woman that came among us,
she appear'd feeble with Old Age, very dark &amp; ugly, we could
not from her judge what the Younger Ones might be, but we had now
some hopes that by the Old Woman coming to us, that the others who
we saw on the beach close by the woods would allow us an interview
as we approach'd them they ran away &amp; as soon as we retired
they shew'd themselves again &amp; had a party of very stout Armed
Men near them, we used many entreaties without effect, the Ladies
still kept their distance.</p>

<p>When we had done what we had to do, we returned to the Boat
leaving two of the Officers on shore with the people who were
cooking, that nothing improper might be done by them as we had now
many of the Natives assembled about us &amp; armed &amp; several
more coming along the beach, 2 Muskets were handed to our people on
shore &amp; the other Arms kept ready in the Long boat, these
people all came among us &amp; laid their Lances down on the beach,
the Old Woman made herself very comfortable &amp; was with us</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 71]</p>

<p>from our first meeting with her, she &amp; her Companions
express'd a wish to know whether we were Men or Women. These people
wanted every thing from us that they saw us make use of or that we
had about us, we did not give them any thing in hopes of bringing
the women among us by keeping what articles we had to give them
&amp; signified to the Men that we would give all to the women if
they would come from the woods where they were sitting looking at
us.</p>

<p>30th: PM: This scheme at last succeeded, for as we left the
beach to dine in the Boats, which lay close too, the women came,
having a party of Armed Men with them who had each a Green bough in
their his hand which they waved as they advanced, the came near us
&amp; sat down amongst our other visitors, the party of Arm'd Men
stood by them &amp; never laid down their Spears.</p>

<p>We made signs to them, that if they would stay, we would bring
them ashore some things which we shew'd to them, We took every
precaution to prevent improprieties being committed by ordering the
people out of the Small Boat &amp; Captain Hunter w the 3 Officers
went in her from the Longboat to go on shore, leaving the Musquets
in the Longboat loaded in case their might be occasion to use them,
as we approach'd the shore the women retired on which we
immediately put back to the Longboat making the same Signs as we
had done before; An Old Man then called to the Women &amp; the
greatest</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 72]</p>

<p>part of them returned &amp; came to the Old Man who walked close
down to the water side as we approach'd: The Armed Men w the boughs
posted themselves together just by &amp; every one of the Men now
took up their Spears &amp; kept them poised ready for throwing
standing close to the edge of the beach &amp; rocks, when the boat
landed, the Old Man came to the side of her &amp; wanted the things
which we had held out to the Women to take to them; which we
refused &amp; signified to them that we must give the things to the
Women ourselves.</p>

<p>The Old Man finding us determined, spoke to the women &amp; one
of them came in to the water to the side of the Boat, we ornamented
this naked Beauty with Strings of Beads &amp; buttons, round her
neck, arms &amp; wrists she appear'd rather frighten'd altho' she
affected a laugh &amp; seem'd pleas'd with her presents, when she
retired several of the other women came to the side of the Boat,
attended by the Old Man, we ornamented these the same as the first;
some came without fear, others trembling &amp; laughing hesitating
before they would come &amp; some just near enough to reach the
things; two of them could not be persuaded to come within 2 or 3
yards of the Boat, to those we threw some things &amp; gave the Old
Man some for them, the whole of this time the Men who kept their
lances ready were silent &amp; attentive to what was doing, two Men
were placed on a seperate rock we supposed to keep a look out upon
the Long boat. After</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 73]</p>

<p>having disposed of our trifling presents we went off to the Long
boat, as soon as we put off the Men held their Spears carelessly
&amp; began shouting, laughing &amp; dancing; we counted 72 besides
Women &amp; Children this was more than twice the number ever yet
seen together before; either in this Harbour or Botany Bay.</p>

<p>The Men we met with here were in general stout &amp; well limbed
the women excepting the very old Woman, were young &amp; in general
shorter than the Men, very straight limbed &amp; well featured
their voice a pleasing softness, they were all entirely naked old
&amp; young: The Men had their beards long &amp; very bushy their
hair hangs upo about their heads clotted with dirt &amp; Vermin
some of them had the teeth of some Animal &amp; peices of bone
stuck in their hair with gum, they are so dirty that it is hard to
tell the real colour of their hides, which I think is nearly black,
their noses somewhat flat &amp; all those that we noticed had a
hole bored, through which they sometimes put a stick or small bone
but of all this party only one wore it;</p>

<p>Most of these men had lost one of the fore teeth &amp; their
skins are much scar'd &mdash; not like those commonly seen from
wounds, this as well the loss of a particular tooth is a Custom
observed amongst them, that we cannot yet learn the reason for,
they walk very upright &amp; very much with their hands behind
them; Most of the Spears this party had, were a single hard sharp
pointed stick secured as the others with gum to a long &amp; light
stick 12 or 16 feet in length</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 74]</p>

<p>&amp; a single barbed spear; the former they threw at a mark
tolerable exact 60 yards, they use a throwing stick which is about
3 feet long with a kind of peg secured on one end which they apply
to the end of the spear, keeping hold of the other end of the
throwing stick steady the spear &amp; direct it with the fore
finger &amp; thumb, this stick being applied increases its velocity
very much: several of these Men were mark'd with streaks of red
&amp; white particularly the armed party that came from the woods
with the women: we saw two Huts a little from one part of the
beach, but their residence we find cheifly under the shelving
rocks; The afternoon being far gone we left these people earlier
than we should have otherwise done, that we might Sound about the
lower part of the Harbour as we returned to the Ships.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="feb88" id="feb88"></a>February
1788</p>

<p>Saturday 2nd Febry: We did not meet with any Natives again till
this day, at day light saw several Canoes in the Cove we were
surveying, they all fled some out of the Cove &amp; others up to a
Cove. (Lane Cove) We could not by any means get these People near
us, Having occasion to go to the bottom of the inner Cove where
several of them had gone w their Canoes, they thought we were
following them &amp; push'd up a Creek to avoid us.</p>

<p>Sunday. 3. PM. In a Cove to the NW 3 Miles above the Ship we saw
several Natives, some sitting round a fire, others</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 75]</p>

<p>were just landing with their Canoes, the moment they perceiv'd
us, they ran off in great confusion &amp; hurry not taking time to
make the Canoes fast or haul them ashore, these people had a dog
with them: We found Muscles on the Fire, others in their Canoes
&amp; some dropt between both; their fright was so great that they
went off without taking their fishing lines, Spears or any thing
with them, these we suppose to be of the number who fled up the
Harbour when we arrived, we left string of beads, Cards, peices of
Cloth &amp;c. about their Fire &amp; in the Canoes &amp; were very
particular not to move any one of their things.</p>

<p>AM. As we proceeded up the Harbour, the Natives all fled in
their canoes as far &amp; as fast as they could; About 4 Mile
higher than where the Ship lay, the Country was open &amp; improved
the farther we went up &amp; in most places not any underwood,
Grass very long.</p>

<p>Monday. 4th. PM. Followed many openings to the NW &amp; pass'd a
narrow Channel into a wide space which would not be in our power to
survey before night &amp; there being assembled up here an
astonishing number of the Natives all arm'd, with Flats on which
the Boats might ground in this channel &amp; put us much in their
power, not having any people but the Boats Crews with us &amp;
being 8 Miles from the Ship, Capt.n Hunter thought that taking the
necessary precautions would employ too many of our people for us to
go on with</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 76]</p>

<p>the plan we were prosecuting; we therefore returned &amp; moored
the Boats for the night at Dawes Island.</p>

<p>AM. Went into the SW Branch, found it terminate in snug Coves,
surrounded with Mangroves, rather shoal water.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 5th. PM: Returned to the ship: At day light having a
Guard of Marines, proceeded to the upper part of the Harbour again,
passed several natives in the Coves as we went up &amp; some on
shore near the place where we left the beads &amp; other things,
who followed along the rocks calling to us, we landed to cook our
Breakfast on the opposite shore to them (Breakfast p.t)</p>

<p>We made signs to them to come over &amp; waved green boughs,
soon after which 7 of them came over in two Canoes &amp; landed
near our Boats, they left their Spears in the Canoes &amp; came to
us; we tied beads &amp;c. about them &amp; left them our fire to
dress their Muscles which they went about as soon as our Boats put
off.</p>

<p>At Noon, we were far enough to see the termination of the
Harbour as far as Navigable for ships, being all Flats above us
with narrow passages that we supposed might run a considerable
distance but very shoal. As we returned to the ship we saw Natives
in almost every part of the Harbour in small parties. In one of the
Coves we found a peice of a Cake which appear'd to be made of the
Wild Fig. We saw them cheifly in small parties &amp; to appearance
have not any fixed habitation, moving about the Harbor as</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 77]</p>

<p>they find will afford them the best means of subsistence. In the
North Arm, I suppose them to be a people inhabiting that part of
the Harbour, this I judge from the number of Women &amp; Children
that were with them &amp; the appearance of their being governed by
a cheif, from the attention they paid to the Old Man at our
interview with the Women, The party of Arm'd Men being selected
&amp; painted on the foreheads &amp; breast &amp; their being with
the women when they first appear'd shews that they were for their
protection &amp; favors my opinion. We did not see any thing of the
kind in any other part of the Harbour or notice that one Man held
himself superior to any other.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 6th: The survey of the Harbour was finish'd in as
accurate a manner as the time would admit of, yet in a place so
very extensive it is possible for rocks to be hidden &amp; holes of
deep water near the bluff lands to be, without our being able to
get exactly on them; The entrance of the Harbour is about 10 Miles
to the N.oward of Botany Bay, the best mark to know when you draw
near it coming from the S.oward is some remarkable Sand Hills over
a Sandy Bay these Sand Hills are near 3 Mile to the S.oward of the
entrance, &amp; from the point of this sandy Bay, the shore is all
rocky Cliffs to the Inner S.o Head; as you approach the entrance
from the S.oward, the Heads have an unfavorable</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 78]</p>

<p>appearance; As you sail into the opening between the Outer Heads
which is near 2 Miles across, steep too on both sides, you will see
on the S.o shore a point off which is a small reef made by the
fallen rocks &amp; breaks as far out as any danger can be; (&amp; a
steep Rocky Head to the WNW called Middle Cape as it seperates the
Branches.) As you pass this point or Inner So Head the Harbour
opens to the SW in which reach of the Harbor &amp; more than 1/3
over from a sandy Cove on the S.o shore formed by a remarkable
green point, is a Rock which dries at ½ ebb &amp; a flat round it
of considerable extent, there is a bar of clear flat sand all the
way from this rock to the Inner S.o Head with 3½ fathom at low
water, it is not very broad &amp; when past it you have deep water
between the rock &amp; the S.o shore, the marks for which channel
are the Inner N.o &amp; S.o Heads on. The marks for the Rock are
the outer p.t of the N.o Head just on with the inner S.o Head &amp;
the Green point on with a remarkable gully seen over the Land to be
close to the Outer S.o Head. In passing to the W.tward of the rock
you will go over a flat which extends from the shoal of the rock
over to the next point above the middle Cape there is 4 &amp; 4½
f.m on it &amp; shoals gradually to 3 towards the shoal which a
little dis.e above the rock you may cross in 3 f.m. As soon as past
the p.t above Middle Cape you have deep water &amp; may Anchor or
work from Shore to Shore; there is no danger afterward that we
could discover. As you sail thro' this reach of</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 79]</p>

<p>the Harbour which lays SWbS by Compass you will see 2 Islands
which before you get the length of, the Harbour will open W. or W¼S
of you round a projecting point &amp; a white rocky small Island
shew itself right in the Stream of the Harbour you may pass on
either side of it &amp; about ½ a mile higher up is the Cove where
the Settlement is fixed, off both points of which is a small ledge
which dries at low water the greater part of it, the shore round
both sides of the Cove is steep too. With a leading wind I would
recommend steering in for the land of the Mididle Cape which lays
nearly WNW by Compass from the inner S.o Head &amp; keep that shore
on board 'til above the rock; The N.o arm has good clear ground
&amp; depth of water: The Harbour is Navigable for Ships 12 Miles
E.t and W.t &amp; the branches extend 6 miles N.o &amp; S.o. It is
one continuation of Harbour within Harbour formed by snug Coves
with good depth of water &amp; fresh water in many of them; Those
Coves above where the ships lay were surrounded by Mangroves &amp;
had mud flats at the bottom, those below had sandy beaches most of
them. The Entrance is in Latitude 33º:50'.S.o. Longitude
151º:26'E.t The Flag Staff at the settlement 33º:51':¾S.o &amp;
151º:20'E.t Variation of the Compass 10º:30'E.t Flows full &amp;
change ¼ pt 8 &amp; rises from 5 to 8 feet much influenced by the
winds.</p>

<p>We found Fish plenty altho' the Harbour is full of sharks, there
is a great quantity of shell fish in the Coves that have</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 80]</p>

<p>mud flats at the bottom, Oysters very large; We found Wild
Spinage, Samphire &amp; other leaves of Bushes which we used as
vegetables. An Island near a mile below the settlement was granted
for the use of the Sirius to make a Garden of.</p>

<p>Thursday. 7th. PM. The Light'ning which had been frequent &amp;
very severe since our arrival was particularly so this evening, a
Tree was struck &amp; shiver'd near the encampment 6 Sheep, 1 Lamb
&amp; 1 Hog that were near the Tree were killed by the same
light'ning &amp; others much scorched, the Centinel on post near
the Tree was knock'd down &amp; lost his sight; The Thunder Squalls
for the last 3 nights were excessive severe.</p>

<p>AM. Being the morning appointed for reading the Governors
Commission &amp;c. all the Officers attended; at the Hour appointed
the Convicts were collected &amp; the Marines formed under arms,
the Commission was then read by the Judge Advocate, &amp; the other
publick authorities by which the settlement was to be govern'd;
besides the Civil Law according to the method used in England,
another Court for the Trial of Capital Crimes was establish'd by
Act of Parliament, this Court is called a Court of Criminal
Judicature to be composed of the Judge Advocate &amp; six Officers
of His Majesty's Forces by Sea &amp; Land, the Majority of whose
Opinions to be the sentence if not touching Life or Limb, in which
case five of the seven must concur in Opinion before sentence</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 81]</p>

<p>can be given. The Governor has the right of approving all
sentences &amp; mitigating punishments &amp; of granting
Pardon.</p>

<p>Friday. 8th. AM. Two Natives came to the Camp, the Governor gave
a Hatchet &amp; several other things but could not persuade them to
stay. A Kanguroo was killed which was the first we had brought
in.</p>

<p>Saturday. 9th. PM: The Captain of the Astrolabe came round from
Botany Bay to pay respects to Governor Phillip &amp; to leave the
French Commodores dispatches for Europe to go by our Transports. We
found that they had been obliged to fire on the Natives at Botany
Bay to keep them quiet: We also learnt from them that they had
lately suffer'd much loss at the Navigators Islands, from some
offence having been given to the Natives they took the opportunity
of their Longboat being aground to close on them with clubs while
others threw stones &amp; forced them from the shore to 2 small
Boats which they luckily had with them or all must have fallen,
they fired &amp; killed many of the Natives but were obliged to
retreat with the loss of the Captain of the Astrolabe 7 other
Officers &amp; 4 of their People &amp; many others badly wounded,
they broke the Boat to peices in their Savage Frenzy.</p>

<p>Monday. 11th: A Criminal Court of Judicature was held on 3
Convicts, whose Sentence was immediately put in execution after
being read to them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 82]</p>

<p>Tuesday 12th. A Boat belonging to the Sirius being up the
Harbour found 4 Convict Women straggling about the Rocks one of
whom made her escape into the Woods &amp; no doubt perish'd.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 13th. Several Kanguroo were seen &amp; a Bird
resembling the Ostrich.</p>

<p>Thursday. 14th. Twenty of the Natives came to the Governors
Farm. On seeing the Sheep they exclaimed Kanguroo, they would not
come nearer the Camp: In the morning the Supply sailed for Norfok
Island, with Lieut King, a Masters Mate, Surgeons Mate &amp; 4
Artificers belonging to the Sirius; 9 Men &amp; 6 Women Convicts.
Mr King had some Sheep, Hogs, Poultry, Seed &amp; Plants, with
tools &amp; implements &amp; clearing &amp; Cultivating the
Ground.</p>

<p>Friday. 15th. The Governor went with 3 Boats Marin'd &amp; Arm'd
up the Harbour, taking the 1st Lieu.t &amp; Master with him; we
were some distance up the Harbour before any of the Natives were
seen, the first party of them were 8 sitting under a hollow rock
round a fire, one of the men stood up &amp; spoke to us, the rest
did not appear to be the least disturbed as they neither moved nor
spoke; we stoped at a Neck of land to Breakfast, we were soon met
there by a Native arm'd, He laid down his Spear as soon as he
join'd us; &amp; had more curiousity than any we had before met
with, he examin'd every thing very attentively &amp; went into all
our Boats from one to the other</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 83]</p>

<p>in the Long boat he sat down &amp; with the help of one of the
People he contrived to manage an Oar, though very awkwardly: The
Governor gave this Man a hatchet &amp; a looking glass which went
when he looked into, he looked immediately behind the Glass to see
if any person was there, &amp; then pointed to the Glass &amp; the
shadows which he saw in the water signifying they were similar:
Another man joined us soon after &amp; a third was laying off in a
Canoe; wanting to see him get out of the Canoe we enticedly him on
shore, he had a stone slung by way of an Anchor which he let go
just as the Canoe took the ground, he stept one leg out of the
Canoe keeping the weight of his body in its center 'till he had
foot hold of the shore to remove it to that leg, in this manner he
landed without any risk of oversetting the Canoe. We next proceeded
up to the beginning of the Flats, where we landed &amp; went 2 or 3
Miles into the Country, found the Trees a considerable distance
apart &amp; the Soil in general good Grass very long &amp; no
underwood.</p>

<p>16th: At 1 PM. returned to the Boats &amp; after Dinner went in
the smallest boat over the Flats past a Mangrove Island &amp;
followed a Creek some distance to the W.tward when it branched away
to the NW &amp; SW which last we followed 4 miles as near as we
could judge, the lake or drain is very shoal &amp; where we stop'd
was entirely fill'd up with fallen trees from both sides, the water
falling fast we had barely time to get down</p>

<p>Boats, which when we join'd returned to the Ship. A Marine was
missing in the woods.</p>

<p>AM. In a Cove where our People were hauling the Sein, the
Natives Men &amp; Women joined them &amp; assisted for which they
had some Fish given them &amp; were very thankful.</p>

<p>Sunday. 17th: AM. The Marine that lost himself, came in, He met
with several of the Natives who were all very friendly they wanted
his Musquet but did not offer to take it by force when he refused
to let them have it; He saw a great number of Kanguroo, One of
which he killed &amp; brought to the Camp with him. Three people
belonging to the French Ships came over from Botany Bay, they met
with but few of the Natives; we found that the Natives at Botany
Bay had been endeavoring to steal several things from them which
obliged them to fire on them once or twice.</p>

<p>Monday. 18th: Several of the Natives appear'd on the points of
land near where the Ship lay, the fishing boat coming past them put
ashore &amp; gave them some fish which they eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 19. Governor Phillip removed from the Ship &amp; took
up his Residence on shore.</p>

<p>AM. Several of the Natives came down the Harbour &amp; kept in a
Bay near the Ship; 7 of them in 4 Canoes passed thro' the Cove
between the Sirius &amp; Transports &amp; went close past one</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 85]</p>

<p>our boats with great confidence; One of them landed on the East
point of Sydney Cove to meet some of our people who were there from
this they went to our Garden Island &amp; found means to steal two
Iron shovels &amp; a pick axe, the pick axe the Gardners obliged
them to bring back &amp; lay it themselves in the very spot they
had taken it from, the Shovels the escaped with, but not without
their skin being well pepper'd with small shot.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 20th: Several Canoes pass'd the Ship in which were
women &amp; Children, they stayed all night on a point close to the
Ship &amp; then went down the Harbour.</p>

<p>Thursday. 21st: Having had a great deal of dry, Hot weather it
was observed that several of the Streams of fresh water had stoped
&amp; others run very slow. Some of the Officers of the Boussole
came from Botany Bay to visit the Governor, they inform us that the
Natives are exceedingly troublesome there &amp; that wherever they
meet an unarmed Man they attack him,</p>

<p>Saturday. 23. A General Muster of the Convicts discover'd that 9
men &amp; 1 woman were still missing, the woman is the same that
ran into the woods the 12th when our Boat took her 3 Companions
straggling; this afternoon the left arm &amp; hand of a white man
or woman floated past the ship, had the appearance of having been a
considerable time in the Water.</p>

<p>Monday. 25th: Our fishing boat met with a great number of Canoes
in the Cove where they went to haul the Sein, in</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 86]</p>

<p>several of which were women fishing who felt no kind of
interruption from our Boat being amongst them.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 26th: Cap Hunter went to Botany Bay in the Longboat to
visit the French Officers.</p>

<p>27th: Three Convicts were condemn'd to Death by a Criminal Court
for stealing provisions from the Store: The allowance to the
Convicts had been this day increas'd &amp; were receiving such
addition at the time the Theft was Committed; One of them was
Executed the same afternoon &amp; the others repreiv'd 24
Hours.</p>

<p>Thursday 28th: The weather was such that our Boat could not get
out of Botany Bay, Captain Hunter walked over with some of the
French Officers. At 6 in the evening the Criminals who had been
repreiv'd were taken to the place of Execution, they were pardon'd
on condition of being banished from the Settlement.</p>

<p>29th: The same Criminal Court met again to try the rest of the
Criminals, one was admitted King's Evidence, 2 condemn'd to Death
&amp; 1 acquitted for stealing wine from the Contractor, Another
was sentenced to Death for stealing provisions from one of the
other Convicts; At 4. Their sentences were read to them &amp; they
were taken to the place of Execution where instead of meeting the
Fate they deserved, they received an extraordinary mark of the
Governors lenity, He pardon'd them on condition of their being
banish'd from the Settlement &amp; one</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 87]</p>

<p>he reserved to be the Common Executioner.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="mar88" id="mar88"></a>March 1788</p>

<p>Saturday. 1 March. The Long boat returned from Botany Bay, the
French Ships had launch'd their Boats which they had built in lieu
of those destroyed at Navigators Isles &amp; proposed sailing in a
few days.</p>

<p>Sunday. 2nd. At day light the Governor with his Cutter,
accompanied by the 1st Lieu.t of the Sirius in her Long boat &amp;
the Master in one of the Transports Long boat with a party of
Marines in addition to the Boats Crews, for the purpose of
examining Broken Bay victualled for 7 days, the Long boat in which
the Master was, proved so very heavy &amp; unhandy that we waited
in Spring Cove 'til she came up with us &amp; clear'd her, the
Governor took the Master into his Boat &amp; sent back that
Longboat, We were met in this Cove by several of the Natives, A
Woman who was fishing in a Canoe, landed with very little
persuasion she was excessively Ugly &amp; very big with child,
there being many women fishing in their Canoes about the Cove, the
Governor did not give any things to the Men; None of the other
Women came ashore but all came alongside our Boats with their
Canoes, the Men kept on the beach: the generality of this party of
women were Old, ugly &amp; ill shaped. The Governor here exchanged
a Straw Hat for a spear, which when he was taking to our Boat,
another of them took hold of it, on which the Man who had the Hat
ran to him &amp; explained</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 88]</p>

<p>that it had been exchanged, he let it go &amp; seem pleased.</p>

<p>At 8. Went out of Port Jackson, when off the Harbour, the Heads
of Broken Bay are within the N.o extreme of Land; the S.o Head is
15 Miles to the N.oward of the No Head of Port Jackson, round which
head the Coast forms a deep bight &amp; has a Cove or bend where a
Boat may shelter from this the beach runs about 3 Miles to the
N.oward to a reef of rocks which break some distance out &amp;
round which is a bight with a long sandy beach on which close round
this reef of rocks a boat may land if caught upon the shore &amp;
not able to reach either of the Harbours: all round this bight the
Natives appear'd on the high land, from this there did not appear
to be any shelter for Boats in any of the Sandy Bays; as we passed
the sandy bay next the S.o Head of Broken Bay, we were met by 3
Canoes having one Man &amp; 5 Women in them, they came alongside of
our Boats quite familiarly: The Governor push'd over to the N.o
shore in the Cutter.</p>

<p>The tide set so strong to the S.oward, that it was with
difficulty the Long boat could get round the S.o Head. As the
evening closed we lost sight of the Cutter &amp; as we approached
the N.o shore of Broken Bay we made Signals by flashing of Powder
&amp; saw lights immediately after on the N.o shore to which we
rowed &amp; found to be the Natives lights, we then hauled off
&amp; fired a Musquet which was immediately answer'd &amp; we soon
saw the Cutter &amp; at 9 at Night Moored the Boats in a Cove</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 89]</p>

<p>on the N.o side of the Bay off which the Surf broke violently:
When the Cutter first landed, they were met by a great number of
the Natives, Men, Women &amp; Children, the Men were all armed with
Spears, Clubs, Stone Hatchets &amp; Wooden Swords, they were all
very friendly &amp; when the Long boat landed were without arms, we
passed the night in this Cove on board the Boats every body.</p>

<p>Monday. 3rd: At day light went into the N.o branch of the
Harbour which has a shoal &amp; narrow entrance just within which
we stoped, found the Natives familiar, they had several Huts here
which were merely small sticks placed against each other &amp;
cover'd over with bark; In these Huts were several Women Old &amp;
young, they were much terrified at first, but soon were composed
&amp; familiar on having presents made them: they had several Cray
fish about these Huts.</p>

<p>As we proceeded up this branch after passing a very shoal flat
&amp; two or three Coves, we found set out so strong that we could
not pull ahead through between two projecting points, on which we
landed in a Cove adjacent; Here we were met by several Natives, Men
&amp; Women who all came freely about us. All the Women we met with
in this Bay two only excepted had lost two joints of the little
finger on the left hand, which custom like others we are at a loss
to account for: It was supposed by some to be the pledge on the
Marriage Ceremony, or on their having Children, I cannot agree in
that opinion as one of the exceptions was</p>

<p>an Old who had had Children &amp; the other a young woman who
had not. The others who had all been subject to this Custom were of
both descriptions, Old &amp; Young. This was not observed at Port
Jackson as a custom among them but noticed in some &amp; supposed
to have been done by accident. We found most of the women had the
Hole bored through the Nose the same as the Men. When the Tide had
slacken'd we pushed up &amp; found several small inlets between
Mangroves, on one of which Islands we stop'd &amp; pitch'd the
Tents; had very hard rain all the morning</p>

<p>Tuesday. 4th. PM While the Tents &amp; Clothes were drying, some
of the Natives landed &amp; were easily kept at a proper distance
from the Clothes; A Crab was caught &amp; proved very good.</p>

<p>AM. At day light proceeded up, found it to be an extensive &amp;
very shoal peice of water, too much so for the Boats to go over the
flats without the risk of being left dry on the Ebb tide. We found
Natives all the way up. Not being able to determine the extent of
this peice of water, we returned to the Cove in which we first
stoped: where we found a Straw Hat &amp; some strings of beads
which favours the opinion of their not having any fixed residence
as nothing of that kind had been given them here &amp; several were
both at Port Jackson &amp; at Botany Bay; After staying a short
time here we went over to the S.o side of the Bay into the SW arm
off which is an</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 91]</p>

<p>Island, We moored the Boats about 3 Miles up this Branch, had
heavy rain, Thunder &amp; Light'ning all night.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 5th AM: Followed the sw. arm up to the head found
several Coves &amp; good depth of water all the way up which I
suppose to be about 7 Miles, we left two openings to the S.oward
without looking into them &amp; left this Arm without examining a
large opening to the NW out of it about a mile &amp; half above the
Island: We went into the S.o Arm were caught suddenly by a thunder
squall &amp; had much difficulty in getting in:</p>

<p>In a Cove just within the entrance we were met by an Old Man
&amp; Boy. He had a stone in his hand which he laid down as he came
towards us, he shew'd us the best landing place, brought us a stick
of Fire &amp; some Water signifying to us that the rain was very
cold, we gave them fish &amp; the Governor exchanged some things
for Spears, this Man was but little scar'd about the body.</p>

<p>Thursday. 6. PM. Continuing to rain we secured every thing for
the night, the Old Man was with us till the evening.</p>

<p>AM. Went up this Arm, saw several of the Natives in every Cove,
the Old Man &amp; boy followed us round to one of the Coves &amp;
shew'd us water; We stop'd in a Cove on the E.t side about 3 Miles
up, several women in Canoes were fishing two of them came ashore
the one an Old &amp; Ugly, the other a young woman tall &amp; was
the handsomest woman I have seen amongst</p>

<p>them, she was very big with Child, her fingers were complete as
were those of the Old Woman. One of the Women made a fishing hook
while we were by her, from the inside of what is commonly called
the pearl oyster shell, by rubbing it down on the rocks until thin
enough &amp; then cut it circular with another, shape the hook with
a sharp point rather bent in &amp; not bearded or barbed, in this
Cove we met with a kernel which they prepare &amp; give their
Children, I have seen them eat it themselves, they are a kind of
nut growing in bunches somewhat like a pine top &amp; are poisonous
without being properly prepared the method of doing which we did
not learn from them. Hard rain the greatest part of these 24
Hours.</p>

<p>Friday. 7. Were at the upper part of the S.o Arm, found in every
part of it, very good depth of water except a Flat at the entrance
from the Et point 2/3 of the way over, between which &amp; the
W.tern shore is a Channel with 3 f.m. at low water &amp; that depth
close to the rocks, the Land on the E.t side of this Arm is in
general good &amp; clear, on the W.t side all Rocks &amp; thick
woods.</p>

<p>AM Left the S.oern Arm &amp; went again into the SW Arm to look
into that opening to the NW, found but few of the Natives in it: We
landed on an Island about 2 miles up this branch, on which we
secured every thing for the night got a great quantity of Mullet in
the Sein from which we called it Mullet Island, there is long flat
to the SE &amp; a reef</p>

<p>of rocks, round which is the bay for hauling th Sein, we found
some Huts on the Island, but only 3 Natives came to us this
evening.</p>

<p>Saturday. 8. AM. Several of the Natives came to us, painted very
whimsically with pipe Clay &amp; red Ochre both which is plenty on
the Island, the pipe clay just under the Sand on the beach round
the rocks. We followed this branch up to the NW some distance,
found openings to the N.oward &amp; NW &amp; on the W.t side of
this opening to the NW, there appear'd to be an Island with
passages round it on both sides, but we only examined that opening
to the NW above Mullet Island which was found to be very shoal,
that to the N.oward not having more than 6 feet water across the
entrance just within the points forming it prevented our looking
farther into it: About Noon having finished our superficial
examination which was much hinder'd by constant heavy rains, we
returned to a Cove at the Outer part of the S.o Arm to be ready to
go out of the Bay.</p>

<p>Sunday. 9th. PM. The Old Man &amp; Boy came to us as before,
with several more of the Natives, they had many things given to
them but that did not keep them from stealing, after dark the Old
Man took an Iron spade &amp; was going off with it, he was seen
from the Longboat, pursued &amp; brought back with it by one of the
people on shore: The Governor chastised him for it, which so
enraged him that he run off &amp; very soon</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 94]</p>

<p>returned with his party all with their Spears ready to throw
when a Musquet was fired which made them stop &amp; a second
Musquet drove them away for the night.</p>

<p>AM. At day light, the Old Man &amp; his Companions came to us
just the same as if nothing had happen'd &amp; without Arms: About
6 O'Clock we left Broken Bay &amp; got into Spring Cove in Port
Jackson at 11.</p>

<p>Monday. 10th. PM. Landed in a Cove above Spring Cove &amp; in
Camp Cove, in which last we saw several of the Natives who ran away
all but two, those stayed on the beach &amp; one of them shew'd us
the marks on his body where he had been beat &amp; also cut on the
Shoulder by the people who landed here from two Boats, He made
signs to us that the barbed spear had been jab'd several times into
his shoulder: about 6. returned to the Ship.</p>

<p>An Emew had been shot while we were away &amp; proved very good
eating. Some of the Convicts straggling into the woods met with
several of the Natives, a quarrel ensued, who were the agressors is
hard to say, but the Convicts were some of them wounded &amp; one
since dead. One of the Seamen belonging to the Lady Penryhne
Transport, who had been missing some days, was found in the woods
by a man employed shooting for the Governor. He had been stript of
all his clothes, not able to stand &amp; scarce sensible.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 11th. Were informed by the Man empd to get Greens for
the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 95]</p>

<p>sick, that the French Ships were sailed from Botany Bay.</p>

<p>Thursday. 13th. The Governor met the Officers on the subject of
Grants of Land, they were informed that it was not in his authority
to do it: peices of Ground for Gardens &amp; for feeding their
stock He allowed for present use but not as Grants of Land.</p>

<p>Sunday. 16th: Some of the Natives came to a place where a party
of the Convicts had been left to cut rushes &amp; finding them
unarmed wanted to steal their tools, being opposed they threw their
Spears at the Convicts which they very wisely picked up &amp; broke
to peices, when they had thrown all their Spears &amp; saw them all
broken to peices, they threw a few stones &amp; ran away, one of
the Convicts was wounded.</p>

<p>Monday. 17th: A Man employed shooting for the Governor, had been
[5] days absent. He reported on his return that he had been taken a
considerable distance into the Country by the Natives, that he had
killed a Kanguroo which they took from him, broiled it &amp; eat it
all together.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 19th. The Supply arrived from Norfolk Island having
left Mr King with the People &amp; stores there &amp; the Jolly
Boat belonging to the Sirius: On their passage to Norfolk Island
they discovered an Island in Latitude 31º:36' South &amp; Longitude
159º E.t Lieu.t Ball named it Lord Howes Island, they arrived off
Norfolk Island &amp; landed on the NE side of it the 2nd Ins.t, A
surge of the Sea washed one of their</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 96]</p>

<p>People from a rock where he was standing &amp; was drown'd, it
was supposed he had been drawn under a shelving rock as they could
not see any thing of the body. They could not find any place on
this side the Island where the provisions &amp; stores could be
landed; On the 6th. they were landed on the S.o side the Island
where there is a small Gully through a reef which dries at half
tide that will just admit a Boat &amp; is very dangerous when any
swell is on the shore. They had much bad weather during the passage
&amp; the prevailing wind SE, they found part of the bones of a
very large whale above high water mark.</p>

<p>Pidgeons &amp; other Birds they found plenty upon the Island,
the Supply called at Lord Howes Island on her return &amp; got
several Turtle, the soil on the Island appear'd good &amp; there
were found a great quantity of Ground Birds which were very good
&amp; easily taken.</p>

<p>Thursday. 20th: Captain Meridith up the Harbour met several of
the Natives on the land opposite to Dawes Island, they were very
familiar &amp; had many things from him, but after he left them,
droping his boat along the shore, a spear was thrown that passed
near him, He levell'd his Musquet which they perceiving got behind
the Trees, He fired a Ball among them on which they shouted but did
not all run away. A Convict who had been out to gather Greens with
another Convict return'd, having met with a party of the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 97]</p>

<p>Natives who beat him severely with their throwing sticks &amp;
then let him go, the other escaped through a thick brush which the
Natives don't like to get into. An Eagle was shot measuring 7 feet
from wing to wing, the feathers black &amp; white: A very beautiful
Bird was shot by one of the Officers that seem'd to partake of two
species, the head &amp; upper part of the body the Parrot, the
lower part &amp; feet that of the pigeon.</p>

<p>Sunday. 23. An Officer was sent to Botany Bay for the purpose of
seeing if any ship was there &amp; how the Natives were disposed:
He did not see any vessel there, met a great number of Natives who
were all friendly. A shark was caught this day 13 feet long &amp;
6½ round after his jaws were taken out they passed over the largest
man in the Ship without touching, the liver gave us 26 gallons of
oil, he had 4 hooks cut from within him besides that which caught
him.</p>

<p>Monday. 24th. Lieut Dawes of the Marines, a Corporal &amp; 8
priv.ts were lent from the Sirius to do duty on shore the Battalion
being weaken'd by sickness.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 25th: The people employed making Bricks, were met by
some of the Natives who threw stones at them &amp; ran away. This
day, the Scarborough, Lady Penryhne &amp; Charlotte Transports were
discharged being clear, these ships by contract are allowed 2
months pay from their being clear'd on account of their having a
Voyage to China to perform as also an additional</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 98]</p>

<p>sum on the Ton to the other Transports on account of their being
discharged &amp; not kept in pay till their return to England.</p>

<p>Thursday. 27th: Several canoes passed down the Harbour, one of
which stop'd to fish between the Ship &amp; the shore w 2 women in
her, they remained 'til near sunset but would not come to the
Ship.</p>

<p>Saturday. 29th. Several Men, Women &amp; Children were fishing
abreast the Ship where they kept all day &amp; landed on a point of
land near us in the evening.</p>

<p>Sunday. 30. Natives as yesterday, on our boat going towards them
they paddled to the shore &amp; ran into the woods &amp; came out
again as soon as our boat left them, We did not interrupt them
again, they staid to the 2nd April &amp; then went two Coves higher
up this party consisted of 17 Canoes with 30 people in them: Some
of our Officers were on shore on at point which they passed near,
one Canoe landed &amp; had some baize given them the other Canoes
all lay off; The Surgeon wounded &amp; brought down a Crow in their
sight &amp; endeavor'd to get the Canoes to land by waving the
wounded Bird to them, finding that they would not land the Surgeon
threw the Bird toward to them, which having recover'd itself flew
away &amp; joined some others that were in a Tree close by, this
uncommon circumstance which could not appear to them short of our
having power to give &amp; take life, astonished them so much, that
they</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 99]</p>

<p>remained quite silent some time &amp; then all joined in a loud
exclamation of wonder.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="apr88" id="apr88"></a>April 1788</p>

<p>Thursday. 3rd. Another party came up the Harbour &amp; occupied
the Caves &amp;c. which the former had left, [Out] boat went to
them with peices of cloth &amp;c.; the Women all ran into the
Woods, the men remained &amp; met our boat; they had several things
given them among which was a shirt one of them put it on, this new
skin he seem'd much pleas'd with, but appear'd to be deprived of
the use of his limbs while within it, they could not be prevailed
on to come to the Ship.</p>

<p>Friday. 4th: Natives as yesterday &amp; the former party fishing
higher up in sight of the Ship.</p>

<p>Sunday 6th: Some of the officers went to Botany Bay, No Ship
there, they found that the Inscription which had been painted on
board &amp; fixed on a Tree near the place the French Abbé who died
was buried while those Ships were at Botany Bay, was torn down by
the Natives, the inscription was not so much defaced but that it
was copied by one of the Gentlemen &amp; the same order'd by
Governor Phillip to be engraved on a peice of Copper &amp; nailed
in the place the other had been taken from.</p>

<p>Thursday. 10th: The Governor &amp; party being in that part of
the Harbour round Middle Cape, found an entrance round a long sandy
point into a very extensive peice</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 100]</p>

<p>of water which branched away in three directions &amp; good
depth of water after having pass'd over the flat at the
entrance.</p>

<p>Sunday 13th. The Governor went down the Harbour to visit the
Coves in the lower part of it, He crossed the neck from the N.o
Cove &amp; found at the end of the beach at the back of it a peice
of stagnate brackish water.</p>

<p>Monday. 14th: Cap Hunter traced the N.omost branches of the
Middle Harbour, to endeavour to know if they had any communication
with that peice of water found yesterday: the N.omost branch was
found to end in a flat, dry at low water &amp; about 2 miles above
it a large run of fresh water. This day two Natives landed on the
p.t of the Cove where the Observatory is fixed, but could not be
persuaded to go into Camp.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 15th: The Governor &amp; party were landed in the N.o
Cove, for the purpose of going some distance into the Country &amp;
to examine that peice of stagnate water beforementioned.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 16th: A Boat went to the N.o Cove to bring this party
back should they return: while the Boat was laying there we walked
across the neck, where some Canoes were just landing which they did
with ease altho' a very great surf was running, they met us &amp;
walked over with us to the place where our Boat was laying, they
staid with us half an hour, several women appear'd at a distance
but would not come to us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 101]</p>

<p>Thursday. 17th: Lieut Ball with some of the Governor's party
crossed the Branches of Middle Harbour &amp; returned to the N.o
shore opposite to Sydney Cove; they left the Governor at the
N.omost branch leading to a large run of water up which they meant
to go the next day. Mr Ball found all the Country he crossed to be
a jumble of rocks &amp; thick woods, except one small spot about a
mile to the NW of the place he came to.</p>

<p>Friday. 18th: Went up the N.o Branch of the Middle Harbor to
meet the party which we did just below the Flats. The Governor had
traced the run of water some miles found the Country in general
Rocks &amp; Woods; the peice of water near the Sea they found to be
a stagnate pool into which the sea breaks over the shore in bad
weather.</p>

<p>Saturday. 19th: Some Canoes landed on Garden Island, had some
things given to them &amp; went away immediately.</p>

<p>Sunday. 20th. Some Officers went to Botany Bay &amp; a boat was
sent without the Heads of the Harbour, from a report having been
made to the Governor that distant Guns had been heard: The Officers
&amp; Boat returned in the evening, nothing at Botany Bay, or to be
seen in the Offing.</p>

<p>Monday. 21st: Captain Hunter with the Officers who had before
assisted him, went with two boats to survey the branches of the
Middle Harbour.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 102]</p>

<p>Tuesday. 22nd: On a point where we landed, found the earth
thrown up in the manner of a Grave, which we turned up &amp; found
the ashes of some deceased person &amp; by the burnt wood laying
near it we suppose it to have been consumed on that spot, the ashes
appear'd to be heap'd together on the surface of the ground &amp;
cover'd with earth, some peices of bones were found not quite
consumed but too much so to know what part of the body they
belonged to; from a greater quantity of the ashes at one end than
at the other, I suppose the body to have been laid at length before
the fire is applied to the Pile &amp; conclude that they dispose of
the dead in the same manner. Saw very few of the Natives.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 23rd: Examined all the N.omost branch &amp; Moored
the boats below the flats leading up to the large run of Water,
pass'd several of the Natives on &amp; fishing off the Middle
Cape.</p>

<p>Thursday. 24th: As the tide flowed we went over the flats in the
small boat, found many winding reaches with holes of 2 &amp; 3
fathom water in some of them: As we went up we saw one Old Man
setting upon the rocks by his Canoe, at about ½ flood we got nearly
up to the fresh water in the boat: When we returned we found the
Old Man with our people, they entertained him with dancing, combing
his hair &amp; beard &amp; shew'd him how to smoke a pipe, two or
three whiffs perfectly satisfied that part of his curiousity &amp;
set him coughing.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 103]</p>

<p>We gave him roasted Oysters which he eat as fast as he could get
them &amp; on giving him a bunch of them roasted he open'd them
with his thumb as easy as we could with a knife, He got into the
Long boat &amp; examined every part of her attentively. All the
Natives in this part of the Harbour, except the Old Man were very
shy &amp; would not come near us we did not find any Huts, they
were in Caves formed by shelving rocks at the outer part they make
a fire which serves both for roasting their Fish &amp; giving them
heat during the night.</p>

<p>Friday. 25th: A Boat was sent to the upper part of the Harbor to
attend the Governor who with a party of Officers &amp; Marines had
been landed there the 22nd. to make an excursion to the W.tward.
Some Officers who had been at Botany Bay return'd In going there
they crossed from the upper part of the SW arm to the NW branch of
Botany Bay which they found but a very short distance across a
swamp, they met several of the Natives, all very friendly; One
party which they met at the close of the evening shew'd them a Hut,
making signs for them to sleep there, they also brought them Fire
&amp; Water &amp; came to visit them in the morning. This night 5
Sheep were killed by some Animal.</p>

<p>Sunday. 27th. Officers visited Botany Bay, no ship there, they
met the Natives in great numbers along the shore of the upper part
of the Bay where they slept near a large party</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 104]</p>

<p>of them: the Natives were very friendly, gave the Officers Fish
&amp; remain'd the night near them &amp; parted in the morning very
friendly: there were many Women &amp; Children amongst them.</p>

<p>Monday. 28th. The Marines who were with the Governor return'd, a
small boat was detained up the Harbour to examine a lake which run
to the W.t ward above the Flats. The Governor had been several
miles into the Country all of which was found to be a clear open
Country &amp; good Soil. They found a channel up the lake to a
large run of water, where there was a kind of slate found in great
quantities.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 29th: The Carpenter was employed fixing new skirting
boards under the Whales &amp; while the ship was on the Heel for
that purpose, the white Composition Bolts &amp; Nails which had
been driven for experiment at Rio Janeiro were examined and found
to be very much decay'd being eaten into by [indecipherable word]
Copper: some of the Iron Bolts in the Butts were also examined
&amp; found but little touched.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 30th. At one haul of the Sein we caught Fish enough
to serve the Ships Company, Hospital, Battalion &amp; great part of
the Convicts.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="may88" id="may88"></a>May 1788</p>

<p>Friday. 2nd. May: AM. A Convict was executed for robbing a Tent
&amp; some other Convicts who had been guilty of Theft, were
flogged at the Tree while the other was hanging over their heads,
to endeavor if possible to strike these abandon'd</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 105]</p>

<p>wretches with Terror.</p>

<p>Sunday. 4th: Some of the Officers sailing in one of the Boats,
met with several of the Natives who they mixed with &amp; were very
sociable, the Natives gave them Fish &amp; they shaved the Natives
in return which they appear'd much pleased with, Several Women
peeping behind the trees came forward at times &amp; were order'd
back by the Men.</p>

<p>Monday. 5th: A party of Seamen from the Sirius were employed
Hutting the Women Convicts. The Lady Penryhne Transport sailed for
China.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 6th: The Scarborough Transport sailed for China &amp;
the Supply for Lord Howes Island.</p>

<p>Thursday. 8th. The Charlotte Transport sailed for China.</p>

<p>Friday. 9th. An Officer went up the Harbour with proper people
to examine the slate up the creek above the flats, it was found to
be a kind of rock &amp; slate together &amp; not fit to work into
slate for covering a House or other use.</p>

<p>Saturday. 10th: Many Natives, Men &amp; Women about our fishing
boat: A shark followed this boat on her coming up the Harbour, he
got hold of the blade of one of the Oars &amp; when shook from that
he went to the rudder &amp; did not quit it till he was struck with
the Tiller: The fish caught for several days past has been very
trifling which we suppose to be occasioned by the cold weather.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 106]</p>

<p>Sunday. 11th. Officers at Botany Bay, no Ship there, they
painted on some conspicuous rocks near the entrance that the
Settlement was made at Port Jackson: they met with a great number
of the Natives &amp; very friendly; during the night the Natives
kept a continual noise &amp; appear'd to keep a good look out; 3
Emews were seen between Port Jackson &amp; Botany Bay but not
within shot. A Boat down the Harbour met with several of the
Natives who appear'd to be very hungry, they had not any fish with
them &amp; eat the Salt Meat which our people gave them.</p>

<p>Monday. 11th: A party went up the Harbour to the lake or
creeking running to the NW above the flats, we went about 3 Miles
up; to a very fine run of water, the Country on both sides pleasant
&amp; the ground apparently fit for opening with far less trouble
than any in the other parts of the Harbour &amp; the Soil good; a
little above the part where the fresh water meets the tide is the
place supposed would produce slate, but had been found on
examination not fit for working: We tried it as Coal without
success: found a great number of Cranes &amp; other Birds about
&amp; above the flats, all very shy.</p>

<p>Thursday. 15th: Some of the Officers shooting up the Middle
Harbour, on their return landed in a Cove where they saw some
Natives to whom they gave the Birds they had.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 107]</p>

<p>Sunday. 18. A party visited some of the Coves down the Harbour
where some of the Natives were seen, they were all friendly, they
seem'd to be very badly off for food not having any Fish, at
another Cove where we landed an Old Woman with a Child remained
with the Men who met us, they had two fires under a very large
hollow rock, we did not find any fish with these people, they were
most of them chewing a root much like fern; we passed close to two
Men on a rock who were so intent upon fishing that they did not
notice us, nor did they strike a fish the whole of the time that we
were near them.</p>

<p>Monday. 19th. Several Natives were seen on a point of land just
above the Ship: About Noon 4 Canoes with Men &amp; Women in them
passed up the Harbour.</p>

<p>Thursday. 22. A Black Swan was kill'd which measured 6 feet 3
inches from Wing to wing, all black except just the tip of the
wings which were white. Two of the Convalescent Convicts were sent
out to get greens for the Hospital, they were met by a party of the
Natives about a mile from the Camp, the Natives attack'd them,
first by throwing stones which they were returning when they used
their spears. One of the Convicts escaped with a barbed spear broke
in him entering at the small of the back &amp; was obliged to be
cut out, he reported that the other Convict was killed</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 108]</p>

<p>and that the Natives had stript him &amp; taken the body away
with them.</p>

<p>Friday. 23rd. Some Canoes landed at Major Ross Garden up the
Harbour, they stole a Jacket &amp; several other things which were
afterwards found in one of the Canoes by some of the Convicts who
followed them along the shore to the next Cove where they landed
&amp; we have reason to suppose that one of the Natives was
murder'd by them but the proof could not be got, they were
dismiss'd without coming before a Criminal Court. Lieu.t Dawes was
this day discharged from the Sirius to the Battalion.</p>

<p>Saturday. 24th: Went to the South Head, observed the Latitude
33º:50':43".So &amp; Captain Hunter 33º:51':07"S.o Saw several
Women fishing in Canoes without the Head, they noticed us
immediately &amp; made a great noise, we threw them a handkercheif
over the precipice which we saw them take up &amp; throw by in one
end of the Canoe. Two Canoes came alongside the Sirius with little
persuasion, but the Natives would not come on board, they had fish,
bread, beef &amp; pork given to them all of which they eat with an
eagerness that convinced us they must have been very hungry, they
remainded alongside our boat some time &amp; were shaved, which
seem'd to please them much, they afterwards landed abreast of the
Ship &amp; stay'd there all day.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 109]</p>

<p>A Calf at the Governors Farm was found wounded by a Spear.</p>

<p>Sunday. 25th: A Hat, Shirt &amp; peice of a Jacket were found in
the woods &amp; known to have belonged to the Convict who was
reported by his wounded Companion to have been stript &amp; killed,
the hat &amp; jacket had marks of Spears having passed through
them.</p>

<p>The Supply returned from Lord Howe Island, they were very
unfortunate in not getting any Turtle &amp; losing one of her
Anchors there. The Scarborough, Charlotte &amp; Lady Penryhne
Transports were all at Lord Howe Island while the Supply was there,
the Scarborough &amp; Charlotte sailed from thence together &amp;
the Penryhne by herself.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 27th. A Kanguroo was killed which weigh'd 140 Lbs. the
largest yet met with; His length from head to tail 7Ft: 3in: of the
Tail 3f.t 4in: circumference of the tail at the rump 17 inches,
fore legs 1 foot, hind legs 2f.t 7 inches.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 28th. Went to the N.o Head to observe the Latitude
but it blew too hard to make an accurate Observation; we landed in
Spring Cove &amp; found it an easy walk to the N.o Head; the land
about the N.o head is sandy ground between the top of the rocks,
cover'd with a variety of brush wood &amp; shrubs some of which
have very pretty blossoms; On our return to Spring Cove, we
observed a Cave in which there</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 110]</p>

<p>was a man &amp; a little girl, they were so intent upon the
motions of our people on the beach, that they did not see us until
we were close upon them, the Man was not the least alarm'd but the
child was exceedingly terrified &amp; clung round the Old Man
endeavouring to hide herself from us, the Girls fingers were
complete, we gave the Man several Birds which were shot, he just
pluck'd a few of the feathers broiled &amp; eat the birds, bones,
guts &amp; all except a part of the head &amp; the feet.</p>

<p>A Kanguroo was killed, that was found to have a Spear broken in
him, a proof that the Natives seek other food besides fish.</p>

<p>Friday 30th. Observed the Latitude at the S.o Head 33º:50':42"S.
&amp; Capn Hunter 33º:51':09".S: saw several of the Natives on the
high land, they were gathering a kind of fruit which they soaked in
water &amp; suck'd. On our return to the Cove where we landed we
found a Native in a tree gathering a fruit of the size of a small
pine &amp; of a beautiful pale yellow, he got it by fixing a four
pronged Spear over the stalk &amp; twisting them off, it had a
sweet taste; we found two children, a Boy &amp; a Girl near the
tree in which the Man was, the children did not appear frighten'd
when we took hold of them, the Girls fingers were complete as were
the boy's teeth, When the Man had got a good quantity of this
spungy fruit He, with the Children walked along the beach &amp;
sat</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 111]</p>

<p>down by the side of a pool of fresh water, to which place we
followed him, they eat or rather sucked the whole of what they had
gather'd frequently dipping them in the water; they then returned
to the place where we first met with them, they eagerly accepted of
a Gull which we gave them. On our return to the Sirius, we found
that some of the Natives had been alongside &amp; examined the
outside of the Ship with great attention particularly the figure,
they appear'd to be the same that visited the Ship some days
before, as they had been shaved, they landed at the Observatory p.t
stoped a short time &amp; went up the Harbour. Capn Campbell going
to the SW arm with Boats to bring down rushes for thatching his
House, on landing at the place where two Convicts had been left
with a tent for the purpose of cutting those rushes, he found the
Tent but not the Men, finding some blood near the Tent the followed
it to the Mangrove bushes where they found both Men dead &amp;
laying at some distance from each other; One of them had 3 Spears
in him &amp; one side of his head beat in: The other Man had no
apparent wound but a blow on the fore head.</p>

<p>Saturday. 31st: The Governor with a party went to the place
where the two Men had been killed by the Natives, the boat returned
leaving them in a Natives path which they meant to follow until
they met with the Natives. The Officer who was in the boat called
at the Lt Governors farm as he returned</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 112]</p>

<p>&amp; was there informed that a Convict had killed one of the
Natives some days before by cutting him across the belly with his
knife, I have no doubt but this Native having been murder'd
occasioned their seeking revenge &amp; which proved fatal to those
who were not concern'd. They have attack'd our people when they
have met them unarmed, but that did not happen until they had been
very ill treated by us in the lower part of the Harbour &amp; fired
upon at Botany Bay by the French.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jun88" id="jun88"></a>June 1788</p>

<p>Sunday. 1st June. The Governor &amp; party return'd by land to
Sydney Cove: He had followed the path to the NW arm of Botany Bay,
met with a party of Armed Natives of 210; The Governor &amp; one of
their principal people, met unarmed, one of the Natives advanced to
shew a wound which he had received in the shoulder apparently with
an Axe; they were all friendly, the Women shew'd every disposition
to be very familiar; a quantity of dried fish was found among these
people &amp; bones which from the size were supposed to belong to
the Kanguroo. Orders were this day given, that no party under 6
armed Men were to go into the woods on account of the Natives being
so numerous.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 4th. Being the first Birth Day of the King to be
celebrated in this New Colony the Sirius &amp; Supply saluted the
Rising &amp; setting Sun &amp; at the usual Hour 1 in the after[n]
w 21 Guns each: When the Sirius &amp; Supply had finished at</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 113]</p>

<p>1 O'clock, the Transports all except the Alexander, which ship
wore the Agent's pendant, saluted one after the other with 5 Guns
each. At the Governors House, after dinner, the County in which
Port Jackson is situated was named Cumberland, boundaries of which
is Broken Bay to the N.oward &amp; Botany Bay to the S.oward as far
in land as a range of Mountains seen from Port Jackson to the
W.tward. The extent of the Territory of New South Wales is from
Cape Yorke or N.o p.t of the Coast, to the S.o Cape of Van Diemans
Land &amp; as far West as 135 degrees of East Longitude from
Greenwich.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 11th: Went to the N.o Head to observe the Latitude,
had a very good observation 33º:49':23".So: Capn Hunter
33º:49':16". On the pitch of the N.o Head we saw a Man immediately
under the overhanging Cliff, on our calling to him, he answer'd
&amp; made signs where the road was to come down. The Rocks under
the Cliff appear to be a large flat with deep water close to the
edge of it; on our return we were joined by 2 Men &amp; 2 boys of
about 14 years Old, they laid down their Spears &amp; made signs
for us not to fire our Musquets, they had a quantity of shell fish
in a net which had been taken out of the shell, these they offer'd
to us eating one themselves at the same time, we tasted &amp;
return'd them: they walked to the Cove with us &amp; then went
along on the rocks up the North Arm. Several parties were sent in
quest of the Bull &amp; Cow which</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 114]</p>

<p>belonged to the settlement they having been missing some days;
One of the Convicts having absented himself about the same time, it
was supposed he had driven them away. These parties were continued
for several days without success, in all directions.</p>

<p>Saturday. 14th: The Governor made known his intention of sending
the P.ce of Wales Transport to England, this Ship had been fitting
for sea several days &amp; said to be going to Norfolk Island until
the question was ask'd by Capn Tench. A Convict was poison'd by
eating some fruit which he got in the Woods.</p>

<p>Friday. 20th. Seven Canoes passed through the Cove within the
Sirius, 20 Men, 12 Women &amp; 1 Child; the Child was carried upon
one of the Mens shoulders as he passed. In a Cove down the Harbour
an old Man was found nearly dead, with some young Men &amp; Women
with him, he was laying on his back appear'd worn out with age,
they had a fire on each side of him to keep him warm.</p>

<p>Saturday. 21st: A kind of fruit had been discover'd here a pure
ascid &amp; found very good in Scorbutic cases, as we had several
people down with the Scurvy, a party was employed to get those
berries.</p>

<p>Sunday. 22nd. A shock was felt about 4 in the afternoon, which
much astonished all who noticed it, the weather Calm &amp;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 115]</p>

<p>very clear &amp; of moderate heat, Thermometer at 58, the water
perfectly smooth, this shock was distinctly felt on board the Ships
in the Cove &amp; by several people on shore, who supposed it to be
the shock of an Earthquake, it was not noticed on board the Sirius
which ship lay just off the Cove in the Stream.</p>

<p>Monday. 23rd: The Convict who had been supposed to have driven
the Cows away was brought in &amp; tried the next day for a robbery
he had committed before he absented himself &amp; was sentenced to
Death as was another Convict for robbing one of the Officers
Tents.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 25th. Several Canoes came down the Harbour &amp;
passed within the Ship, some of the Men came alongside we gave them
some fish &amp; several other things, they were much pleas'd &amp;
gave us some Oysters in return, these people seem'd to suffer much
from the Cold.</p>

<p>About ½ an hour before Noon those two Men under Sentence of
Death were Executed.</p>

<p>Friday. 27th. A Flying Fox was killed that measured 3 feet from
wing to wing, this was the first met with.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jul88" id="jul88"></a>July 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday. July. 1st: It having blown a Gale of wind dead upon the
shore for 48 Hours, we went down the Harbour to get on the high
land of one of the Heads to look round that part of the Harbour
which is exposed to the Sea, for any broken water or foul ground
that may shew itself in so great a Sea;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 116]</p>

<p>We found the Swell too great to attempt landing near the Middle
Head as we intended; We went to the a Cove near the land of the S.o
Head &amp; walked over to the Sea face near the S.o Head, where we
had a good view of the Sea &amp; of all that part of the Harbour
open to it, could not see the least appearance of any foul ground
except the rock marked in the Chart &amp; which was seen when the
boats first visited this Harbour &amp; that shoal did not appear of
greater extent than we had before determined it; If the flat round
this rock was not a perfect smooth bottom, I am confident that with
the Sea that was running it would break.</p>

<p>Monday. 7th. A considerable party of the Natives were met with
about 2 Miles from the Camp.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 8th: Went down to one of the lower Coves &amp; walked
over to the Sand Hills which are given as a mark for a Ship coming
from the S.oward to know when they are near to Port Jackson, We
found a good path over the neck of land, &amp; not half an hours
walk.</p>

<p>Thursday. 10th: The Governor's fishing boat, met a great number
of the Natives in the lower part of the Harbour, as they were
hauling the Sein, the People gave fish to all the Natives, but they
were not satisfied with that, they closed upon the people employed
in the Boat &amp; took what they pleas'd, their Musquet happening
to be left in the Boat.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 117]</p>

<p>Friday. 11th. One of the People killed a Male &amp; Female
Kanguroo &amp; took a young one alive, which was sent on board the
Alexander Transport to go to England.</p>

<p>Monday. 14: The Alexander, P.ce of Wales, Borro[u]dale &amp;
Friendship Transports sailed for England under the direction &amp;
Command of Lieut Shortland Agent for Transports, these Ships were
all in a distress'd state when they sailed both as to sickness,
want of provisions &amp; furniture; we made a party to the S.o Head
to see them off the land, they had a fresh Gale from the SW &amp;
were soon out of sight steering to the N.oward; On our return we
went into Camp Cove where we found a Man &amp; two Children who
appear'd to be starving we gave them Salt Beef which eagerly took
&amp; eat immediately, whilst the boats remained in the Cove, the
Man went into the woods &amp; brought in a root which he roasted,
beat it with a stone which he frequently wet with a stone his mouth
&amp; when it was properly prepared he gave it to the Children to
eat, the Man had many sores about him &amp; was really a miserable
object, the Boy &amp; Girl appear'd to be about 5 or 6 years of
age, the Boys teeth were complete as were the Girls fingers. We saw
several Women fishing near the Cove but they would not land; we had
two Seins with us, both of which were hauled several times without
one fish being taken, some Birds were shot, all of which were given
to the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 118]</p>

<p>Old Man &amp; his Children.</p>

<p>Thursday. 17. Boards of direction were sent to Botany Bay to be
fixed on Bare Island which is near the entrance, so that any Ship
that may arrive there would be informed that we were at Port
Jackson, this party met with but few of the Natives. One of our
Boats down the Harbour had several stones thrown at her on landing,
a musquet fired at them set them off. The Supply sailed for Norfolk
Island with Provisions &amp; stores.</p>

<p>Friday. 18. Several of the Women Convicts met with a party of
the Natives in a Cove where they were employed, they Natives did
not appear to notice the difference of dress but soon found which
Sex they were of.</p>

<p>Sunday. 27th. Convicts gathering greens for the use of the sick
were attack'd by the Natives, one of them got clear &amp; ran into
Camp leaving his Companion to do the best he could for himself; He
was soon found by a Marine who happen'd to be near, but not before
he was wounded by a Spear which passed through one side of his face
to his neck.</p>

<p>Monday. 28. A Sailor straggling into the woods met several of
the Natives who threw stones at him &amp; followed him when he
attempted to run away, He with great presence of mind stoped &amp;
presented a stick at them in manner of a Musquet, at which they
stop'd &amp; by that means he got</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="aug88" id="aug88"></a>August 1788</p>

<p>August. 7. The Lt Governor's House which was building of stone
&amp; several feet above the ground, gave way with the heavy rains
&amp; fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Sunday. 10th: Two Kanguroo were killed at one shot, they were in
the act of propagating the species which from the construction of
their generative parts they perform with their rumps to each
other.</p>

<p class="footnote">[NOTE: In the journal, The parageraph above was
crossed through with a single slanting line]</p>

<p>Friday. 15th: Fourteen Canoes passed, going down the Harbour 12
of them had a man in each the other two empty &amp; towed by
them.</p>

<p>Saturday. 16th. Several Canoes went up the Harbour.</p>

<p>Sunday. 17th. The Governor &amp; Capt Hunter went down the
Harbor with two boats &amp; the 1st Lieu.t &amp; Master up the
Harbour with 2 boats to examine all the Coves &amp; collect as near
as possible the number of Canoes &amp; Natives then about the
Harbour, these were met with, 67 Canoes, 94 Men, 34 Women &amp; 9
Children: all those that we met with in the upper part of the
Harbour were very friendly &amp; one party of them which we met
with took the shellfish off their fire &amp; brought us to eat;
Those met with in N.o arm of the Harbour were not so friendly, for
while speaking with the boat in which Captain Hunter was a Spear
was thrown which passed about 6 feet right over the midships of the
boat, they immediately run away &amp; were followed by the charge
in one of the musquets which luckily</p>

<p class="caption">'A View in upper part of Port Jackson; when the
Fish was shot.'</p>

<p>for them happen'd to be only loaded with small shot; some time
after this, when the two boats had joined &amp; were passing the
same place, several Women came down &amp; used every endeavor to
entice the boats to land. As we were coming down the Harbour the
Master shot a fish of 1½ lb weight in a a branch of a high tree
which we got &amp; eat, this fish was in the claws of a large Hawke
when fired at, drop'd the fish &amp; flew away.</p>

<p>Monday. 18: A Canoe with 3 Men in her followed our fishing boat
up the Harbour &amp; came alongside the Ship but could not be
persuaded to come on board.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 19. The Governor w a party land at the bay nearest the
Sand hills to walk along the Shore to Botany Bay.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 20th. They returned, met many Natives &amp; on a part
of the Coast near Botany Bay was the remains of a Whale which had
been thrown ashore apparently a considerable time since, On this,
the Natives were then feasting.</p>

<p>Thursday. 21st: Several Natives passed through Sydney Cove &amp;
landed with 2 Canoes on the West point; whilst these people engaged
the attention of the Officer on one side, the rest went round &amp;
seeing a Goat on the other side killed it with a spear &amp; made
off with it in a Canoe towed by one of the others, they were
pursued but not until it was too late, either to recover the Goat
or discover the theif.</p>

<p>Friday. 22. The Governor landed in the N.o arm to go to the
N.oward.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 121]</p>

<p>Met a great number of Natives there with 50 Canoes.</p>

<p>Sunday. 24. Two Boats were sent down to attend the Governor in
case of his return; they found a great number of the Natives in the
Cove where they lay with the boats, they observed several small
parties join those who were first seen: the Women came to the water
side &amp; used every means to entice our boats to land: when the
boats had been there about an hour, the Men formed into two parties
&amp; fought some time with Spears &amp; using Oval Sheilds, some
fought with Clubs &amp; sticks; when they began the women &amp;
Children scream'd &amp; ran about seemingly much frighten'd &amp;
some of them came close down upon the beach off which the boats
lay, some spears were thrown at our boats &amp; fell so near them
as to be picked up.</p>

<p>One of the Officers was of opinion that this was a sham fight,
from their holding frequent parlies &amp; only one seen to fall: at
Sunset when the boats left the Cove, they set up a loud &amp;
apparently Contemptuous shout &amp; came close to the water side,
except a party of very tall Stout Men, who remained among the long
grass &amp; had the appearance of being chosen either as a Guard
for the Women or a reserved party; In this Branch of the Harbour we
have experienc'd that they have hostile intentions when they
suppose our people in their power: there were about 200 of them
collected together during the time the Boats stay'd</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 122]</p>

<p>in the Cove &amp; all arm'd with Spears &amp; Clubs. This day a
Convict was examined who said he had discover'd a Mine, which had
some Gold in it, but for some time would not tell where it was,
unless he was promised pardon &amp; a sum of Money, finding that he
could not obtain it, he said he would shew any Officer the Lt
Governor might send with him, where it lay.</p>

<p>Monday. 25th: Captain Campbell went with the Convict to the spot
where he expected to find the Mine, the Man led him away to the
land about the S.o Head &amp; found means to escape through the
bushes, he returned to the Camp by Noon telling the Lt Governor
that Captain Campbell was at the Mine &amp; wished a Guard to be
sent to him; it was 4 o'clock before Capt Campbell got into Camp at
which time the Convict could not be found:</p>

<p>In the evening the Governor returned soon after which this
Convict the Goldfinder surrender'd himself up saying it was his
intention to divert the time until the return of the Governor &amp;
that to him he would declare every thing, in the mean time he was
punished with 50 lashes for his conduct respecting Capt Campbell
&amp; then sent with another Officer who had orders given him in
the Man's presence to put him to Death if he Offer'd to escape or
play any more tricks, soon after the Boat left Sydney Cove, he
declared to the Officer, that the</p>

<p>Ore produced was the work of his own hands from Brass Copper
&amp; a Guinea mix'd with it in a composition which he had prepared
for that purpose &amp; that he had hopes of selling a considerable
quantity of it to the Transports when they might be just on Sailing
&amp; that he had not made any discovery, but was persuaded by the
woman who lived with him to do it.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 26th: The Supply arrived from Norfolk Island; whilst
she was at that Island August 6. A Boat which had been order'd to
lay just within the p.t of the reef in Case of an accident
happening to the Supply's boat then coming in, was carried out by
the strength of the outset so far as to oblige them to pull across
the swell to regain the landing place in effecting which the Surf
rose suddenly on her the consequence of which was, the Boat
lost:</p>

<p>Mr. Ja.s Cunningham Mate of the Sirius, one Seaman belonging to
the Sirius, one to the Supply &amp; one Convict were drowned, the
other Man who was in the Boat, a Convict saved himself by swimming
through one of the channels thro' the reef. The accounts of the
produce of the Island are very favorable &amp; flattering to the
Settlement, the pines are said to be fit for all purposes &amp; of
sufficient size to Mast a First rate with the Stick, there are
several other kinds of wood besides the Pine with which the Island
abounds: Mr King the Commandant</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 124]</p>

<p>is so sanguine as to expect that in the course of 3 years the
Island would support itself: Landing is very difficult &amp;
frequently dangerous, sometimes altogether impracticable for Day
&amp; Weeks together; the Boat in which Mr Cunningham was lost was
before overset on the same reef &amp; one Marine belonging to the
Sirius drown'd.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="sep88" id="sep88"></a>September
1788</p>

<p>September. 1. A Convict at Major Ross's farm was wounded by a
spear being thrown at him from behind a tree by a Native, who ran
away immediately.</p>

<p>It had been determin'd that the Sirius should visit some of the
Islands near the Settlement, every preperation was made for the
Voyage; But early in this month her destination was alter'd, it
appearing that a considerable quantity of the Vegetable part of the
Provisions in the settlement was damaged &amp; that the produce of
Grain was likely to be very small great part of the seed not
producing any thing, in consequence of this, It was thought
necessary that the Sirius should land some of her Guns, Heavy
Stores &amp; provisions, reserving a sufficient proportion for a
passage to the Cape of Good Hope at which place it was intended she
should take in as much as could be stowed of such articles as were
most wanted in the Settlement, where they woul be distress'd for
some articles if a Supply did not arrive in the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 125]</p>

<p>course of the ensuing Season</p>

<p>The latter end of September, a Midshipman, 2 Seamen, a Corporal
&amp; 5 private Marines belonging to the Sirius, 20 Men &amp; 12
Women Convicts were put on board the Golden Grove Transport to
proceed under the direction of the Master of the Supply to Norfolk
Island to be left there in addition to those people already on that
Island with Mr King, taking 12 Months provisions of all Species for
the whole N.o of people.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="oct88" id="oct88"></a>October 1788</p>

<p>October. 1st. The Sirius &amp; Golden Grove dropt down the
Harbour, &amp; in the night the Golden Grove sailed for Norfolk
Island.</p>

<p>Having pass'd part of a Summer &amp; one Winter in New South
Wales; I shall give a collected account of the Natives &amp;c.
before we quit Port Jackson, from occurrencies which has in the
Course of that time come within my certain knowledge. In the course
of the last month, the Natives appear to be very numerous &amp; the
Fish to come in great quantities into the Harbour, from which
circumstance I still support the opinion of their not having any
fixed residence &amp; that the Fish as well as considerable part of
the Natives incline to the N.oward during the Winter.</p>

<p>What has been experienced lately in several instances meeting
with the Natives, has occasioned me to alter those very favorable
opinions I had formed of them, &amp; however much I wished to
encourage the Idea</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 126]</p>

<p>of their being Friendly disposed, I must acknowledge now
convinc'd that they are only so, when they suppose we have them in
our power or are well prepared by being armed. Latterly they have
attack'd almost every person who has met with them that has not had
a musquet &amp; have sometimes endeavoured to surprise some who
had; We have also experienced that they have great cunning, which
was twice particularly shewn in stealing a Goat each time, this
they effected by a part of them engaging the attention of those who
they supposed might interrupt them whilst others would spear'd the
Animal &amp; put it into a Canoe, paddled away directly &amp; by
the time the animal could be miss'd they had been gone too long to
follow them with any chance of success.</p>

<p>The Musquet now seems to be the only thing to keep them in Awe,
which when they notice we have, &amp; they are disposed to come
among us, they are familiar &amp; friendly. That some of them have
been killed by Musquet balls, both at Port Jackson by our People
&amp; at Botany Bay by the French I have not the least doubt.</p>

<p>The Instruments &amp; Weapons, that I have seen, Are Spears some
with 4 prongs 3, 2, &amp; single for fishing the points of all
which are barbed with shell or bone secured to its respective prong
with stiff Gum, the single one is generally barbed at the point
&amp; at several parts above it in the same</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 127]</p>

<p>manner; they are seldom without a Spear which they use as an
Offensive Weapon, the sharp pointed end is made of very hard wood 2
or 3 feet in length &amp; taper'd to a point (I never saw any of
those barbed), this is secured as are the prongs of the fishing
spear to a long &amp; light stick which they find about the low Gum
Trees &amp; which they make to the length they want by lashings
&amp; Gum at the different parts where they join it, generally from
18 to12 feet in length. I have seen them add a joint to the fishing
spear by letting one part into the other &amp; use it
immediately:</p>

<p>I think the Spear may be easily avoided if you see the Man who
is going to throw it, in two or three instances when they have
attacked our People, their spears were taken up &amp; broken as
fast as thrown; those Convicts who were killed were either
surprised or held a Contest with them until surrounded; They no
doubt endeavour to be assured that those whom they mean to treat
unfriendly are not provided with fire arms before they make an
attempt &amp; those Boats at which they have thrown stones &amp;
spears appear'd to them unprepared, but twice they experienc'd that
the people in the boats were perfectly ready altho' the musquets
where not shewn until it was necessary to fire on them. For short
distances &amp; commonly in striking Fish they throw the Spear by
hand, but other times they use a stick about 3 feet long, with a
peg at one end, which is applied to the end of the Spear, then
balanced they just steady the Spear</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 128]</p>

<p>with a finger &amp; thumb &amp; apply the force of the arm to
the Stick on which they spear is poised, they throw it from 60 to
90 yards. I have seen them throw it very true at 60 yards; On the
other end of the throwing stick is fixed a shell which they use in
getting shellfish from the rocks &amp; various other purposes as we
would a knife or chissel.</p>

<p>They use Targets made from the bark of the Gum Tree &amp; I have
some of the outside part of the Tree itself when the Tree has been
burn'd inside which is here a very common practice for getting the
Opossum &amp;c. out of them or some purpose we are yet unacquainted
with: I have seen there sheilds or Targets with the points of
spears broken in them &amp; some holes which had the appearance of
the spear or pointed part of it having passed through; It was
noticed by the Officers who were in our Boat[s] in the N.o arm of
the Harbour &amp; present at a real or sham fight among the
Natives, that they use the Target for security against the Spear.
The other Instruments of War which I have seen are the Club, Wooden
Sword &amp; Scimeter.</p>

<p>The Club is 3 or 4 feet long, of very hard &amp; heavy wood of
diff.t shapes, some are pointed so that it may be used to make a
charge with as well as to give a very violent blow</p>

<p>The Sword is somewhat of the shape of the common hanger with the
handle or hilt carved so as to give them a good hold of it: It is
made of very hard wood, smooth &amp; sharp at both</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 129]</p>

<p>edges coming to a tolerable sharp point, they are from 2 to 3
feet long &amp; as many inches broad or more.</p>

<p>The Scimeter is of the same hard wood, of a Curve with two
handles to it &amp; appears to be used to repel the blow of the
Club or Sword &amp; from its construction, will as well as fend off
a blow occasionally give a very heavy one.</p>

<p>The Implements or Tools which we found among them are very
miserable tools indeed: &amp; they do not appear to have one which
is not absolutely necessary for furnishing the means of subsistence
to themselves which appears to be their only care.</p>

<p>The Stone Hatchet is made of a hard stone much like Flint,
sharped at the edge, secured to a stick about 2 feet long by fixing
in with Gum &amp; lashing &amp; is a miserable blunt tool -</p>

<p>The adze is made of the same stone &amp; secured to a stick in a
similar manner as the hatchet but of shape somewhat like our
Carpenters adze but 100 strokes with it would not do the same
execution as one with ours.</p>

<p>They use a wedge of the same kind of stone, with a junk of wood
for a Mallet or Maul. These tools appear all to be used in
providing the Canoe &amp; sheilds from the Trees, which with such
wretched implements is a work of great labour; they cut the bark
round to the length they want &amp; enter the wedges leaving it in
that state some time before they take it off altogether: Many of
them has been met with &amp; several</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 130]</p>

<p>times seen at work on the Canoe &amp; Sheild: Some have been
considerably above the reach of any Man, they notch the Trees to
enable them to get up for this &amp; other purposes.</p>

<p>The Canoes we met with are by far the worst I ever heard of,
being nothing more than a peice of Bark gather'd up &amp; lashed at
both ends with spreaders of small sticks inside by way of thwarts.
I have seen them from 10 to upwards of 20 feet in length &amp;
observe that when employed fishing have seldom more than two people
in them, when moving their station I have seen 4 &amp; once 6 in a
Canoe, we never met with any that had outriggers or any kind of
sail, we have met with them without the Harbour between Port
Jackson &amp; Broken Bay when there has been a great swell on the
shore.</p>

<p>They row with paddles in shape like a pudding stirrer about 2 or
3 feet long, which they use one in each hand &amp; take the stroke
alternately as one hand comes aft, the other is applied forward. I
have noticed them when in a great hurry apply both at the same
which occasions them to stoop forward, at other times they sit
perfectly upright &amp; are very expert in preserving the
equilibrium so necessary to prevent oversetting.</p>

<p>The Men sit upon their heels with their legs under them &amp;
their feet [stucky] out behind them: The women sit with their knees
up to their chin &amp; their feet cross'd before them, they all sit
in the bottom of the Canoe with their face forward</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 131]</p>

<p>they have generally fern &amp; some sea weed under them &amp;
under the fire which they are scarce ever without in the middle of
the Canoe; When Men &amp; Women are in the same Canoe I have always
observed that the woman sat forward &amp; the Man abaft, the Women
sitting forward have their backs to the fire which occasions many
of them to be mark'd which appear'd to us at first like that of
their having been severely scourged.</p>

<p>Having fire in the Canoe I take to be for the purpose of getting
fire when they land &amp; for warmth, more than that of dressing
food in the Canoe, I have seen them broil fish in the Canoe once or
twice when alongside the Sirius, but in general they put all that
was given to them among what they had before got themselves. We
never yet got an opportunity of seeing the method they use to
produce Fire &amp; from their always carrying it about with them
suppose it to be a difficult process or a work of labour &amp;
time:</p>

<p>The young Children in the Canoes are sometimes laid across the
Mother's lap, setting between her knees &amp; sometimes on the Mens
shoulders, holding fast by his head neither of which prevents
either Man or Woman from using both paddles; from the wretch'd
construction of these Canoes they take in a great deal of water;
which they throw out with a flat stone or slate, taking it in the
hollow of the hand they throw the water out behind them without
getting up in the Canoe, this for the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 132]</p>

<p>time prevents the person who is baling, from using both paddles;
this method of freeing the Canoe is very hurtful to them as they
apply the edge of the stone every time to touch the bottom of the
Canoe, that part wears away &amp; when into a hole, they patch up
with Gum &amp; sometimes use the leaves of the Cabbage trees with
it, but from these holes enlarging they are frequently obliged to
lay the Canoe by before the other parts are decay'd; they get in
&amp; out with great ease, tho' it is not without great difficulty
&amp; attention that any one of us can without oversetting when
they land at the rocks, they lay the Canoe alongside of them
keeping fast by a peice of line; when at a beach or Mud flat they
haul the Canoe ashore after them or heave a stone overboard with a
fishing line fast to it as soon as they take the ground to prevent
their driving off; they frequently haul their Canoes up upon the
rocks at those places where the shelving rocks afford themselves
shelter.</p>

<p>In the Summer, the Sea seems to furnish the Natives good
subsistence, Fish being then in great plenty in &amp; about the
Harbours, among which are the Jew Fish, Snapper, Mullet, Mackrel,
Whiting, Dory, rock Cod, leather jackets &amp; various others, some
of a species which had never been seen by any of us; There are
great numbers of the Sting ray &amp; shark, both which I have seen
the Natives throw away when given to them &amp; often refuse them
when offer'd. We met with</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 133]</p>

<p>several Fish that seem'd to partake of the shark, the upper part
being that of the skate or other flat fish with the back fins &amp;
tail of the shark: This kind of mixt breed is also found among the
Beasts &amp; Birds, the Quadrupeds, the Dog excepted partake of the
Kanguroo &amp; Opossum, many having the false belly &amp; hind legs
&amp; feet similar to those of the Kanguroo. The Birds frequently
partake of the Parrot.</p>

<p>The Natives strike fish with their barbed Spears from the rocks
&amp; sometimes from the Canoe in with they stand up: in general we
observe the Canoe occupied by the Women who fish with hook &amp;
line, which I never noticed any of the Men to use or that the women
use the Spear. The line appears to be made from the inside / bark
of the Cabbage tree, it is laid of two strands well twisted &amp;
strong. Their hooks seem to be made both from the claws of Birds
&amp; the inside of a shell resembling the pearl Oyster Shell, from
the latter I have seen a hook made, they rub it down on the rocks
until fit for their purpose &amp; then shape the hook in a curve
with a sharp shell or stone; we found vast quantities of Oysters
&amp; other shell fish in the Harbour &amp; Oysters of an amazing
size in the uppermost Coves. At Broken Bay we saw several very fine
Cray fish &amp; one tolerable size Crab, but did not ever meet with
either at Port Jackson. For a considerable time after our arrival
it was supposed that the food of the Natives was entirely Fish,</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 134]</p>

<p>but the winter convinced us, that if they had not some other
resource great numbers of them must perish, as it is, they are very
hard put to it when the Fish is scarce; they we have been several
days together without getting half a bucket of fish with the Seine
&amp; having met some of the Natives in a most deplorable situation
for want of food in the winter Months. At those times they will eat
any thing &amp; have been seen to take up the carcase of a sheep
that had been thrown overboard as eagerly as if the animal had been
just killed; I have several times met with small parties of them
seeking roots &amp; spungy substances which grow on some of the
Trees &amp; yeild a small seed &amp; sweet juice which the Birds
feed on: The fern &amp; some other roots they prepare by moistening
&amp; beating between two stones a considerable time before they
use it.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but they lay wait for the Kanguroo &amp; Birds
many of the trees are notch'd that has not had a Canoe taken from
them from which I suppose they get into these Trees to seek or wait
for any thing that may come in their way, About the open ground
where the Kanguroo frequent we have met with a kind of hunting
wigwam, consisting of two sides made of bark over some small sticks
just meeting each other &amp; open at both ends, in the sides they
have a hole or two to look out; The Dogs Hunt the Kanguroo we have
prove of by one being shot close at the heels of a Kanguroo. In
an</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 135]</p>

<p>excursion made to Botany Bay, near the Sea Coast, many of the
Natives were found feasting on the remains of a Whale that had been
thrown on shore by the Sea: they have no idea of dressing fish any
other than by laying it on the fire; One of them very eager to
steal a fish which he saw in a pot at our fire in one of the Coves,
put his hand in to snatch it out but the water being just boiling
he let the fish go &amp; appear'd to be much surprised. We found a
kind of wild fig &amp; notice that the Natives use it; they also
use a nut which grows in clusters to the size &amp; shape of the
top of the pine, One of the Convicts was poison'd by eating them,
in what manner the Natives prepare them I do not know but I tasted
some at Broken Bay &amp; thought them good.</p>

<p>We never met with the smallest appearance of any kind of
Cultivated ground: We found wild spinage, samphire &amp; parsley
&amp; small quantity of sorel &amp; wild celery, all of which with
the leaves of several kinds of bushes were used by us for want of
better vegetables which were not yet supplied from the Garden, as
will appear from our whole stock of vegetables on board the Sirius
for her intended voyage was a dozen heartless Cabbages &amp; as
many young Brocoli plants &amp; those the produce of the Governors
Garden. Soon after our arrival a berry in appearance like an unripe
currant was found in many parts of the Harbour; a very strong pure
ascid &amp; of infinite use</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 136]</p>

<p>in removing the Scurvy from those on board who had been attack'd
by that disease: We also found a plant which grew about the rocks
&amp; amongst the underwood entwined, the leaves, of which boiled
made a pleasant drink &amp; was used as Tea by our Ships Company:
It has much the taste of Liquorish &amp; serves both for Tea &amp;
Sugar &amp; is recommended as a very wholesome drink &amp; a good
thing to take to Sea.</p>

<p>The Quadrupeds we met with here, were the Dog, of the common
size much resembling the Jackal: The Kanguroo which is an Animal we
have reason to suppose is not known in any other Country, are of a
Dunn &amp; reddish Fox colour, the fur on the young ones is
tolerable good, the body of this animal seems to be of a peculiar
structure, narrow shoulders the fore legs small &amp; short having
5 toes on each foot or paw; regularly placed the middle the
longest; this animal is very large &amp; strong about the loins,
the hind legs long &amp; of great strength, they seldom use the
fore feet in moving, but bound along with great swiftness upon the
hind legs, in doing which the tail which is large &amp; powerful
affords them much assistance they have but 3 toes on the hind feet,
one large long one with a very strong nail on it, this is between
the two others which are smaller than those of the fore feet &amp;
one of those has a double nail, which I never heard of being met
with in any other Animal &amp; in this is general in the vast
number</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 137]</p>

<p>[shot there never was one exception, they also differ from other
Animals in having the testes situated before the penis which comes
out thru' the external orifice of the anus, the Female has but one
external orifice within which is seated the parts necessary for
propagation, it is not ascertained whether they bring forth the
young in the false belly or whether in the same] manner as other
animals &amp; afterwards put it into the false belly to nourish
it.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[NOTE: In the journal, The parageraph above was
crossed through with a single slanting line]</p>

<p>The Teats are situated in the false belly &amp; the young one
has been found fix'd on the Teat when just formed &amp; not half
the length of a mans finger; they young ones of considerable size
has been found &amp; killed in the false Belly;</p>

<p>The Kanguroo have been killed from the smallest size to that of
160 Lb weight the dimensions of which were from the head to the
tail 7Ft:03In, of the tail 3Ft:04in: fore legs 1Ft:3in, hinder legs
2Ft:09in the tail at the root 18 inches in circumference; the head
is much the shape of the Horses head, small &amp; rather longer
ears which they turn right round &amp; hear the least noise, windy
weather is reckon'd best for shooting them, the woods being then in
motion &amp; making a noise prevents them hearing the approach of
any person, we think the Meat very good having been so long without
other fresh provision, but in any other situation I cannot think it
would be esteem'd as such. We found great numbers of the Opossum,
Squirrels, rats of various kinds &amp; many of which partake of</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 138]</p>

<p>the Kanguroo, the hind legs &amp; tail being similar, &amp; the
females of the Opossum having the false belly. The flying Fox, or
large bat is common here as are flying squirrels. The Birds we met
with here; are Gulls of many kinds, Black Swans, Eagles, Hawkes,
Crows, Cranes, Curlieu, Heron Bustards Quails, Cockatoos, Parrot,
&amp; Paroquets of beautiful plumage, we found but few pidgeons
&amp; met with a great variety of small birds extremely beautiful
&amp; some of the birds most unaccountably partaking of the parrot
in some degree.</p>

<p>The Ostrich &amp; Emew have been seen &amp; one Emew killed,
which was allowed to be very fine eating &amp; the best Bird in the
Country on account of its size.</p>

<p>Many kinds of Snakes were met with &amp; Lizards, Guanas
Turpins, Centipieds of an incredible length, one which was justly
called a Millepied measured 2Ft:6in in length &amp; was taken on
Garden Island; The Ants &amp; Musquitos we found very troublesome,
of the former we saw a great variety the sting of the large white
Ant is very painful.</p>

<p>The Natives that we met with during our stay at Port Jackson
&amp; visiting Broken &amp; Botany Bays, were in general of the
middle stature, very active, but do not appear to be that strong,
robuste people which Savages are usually found to be, there is a
great sameness in their features, noses rather flat voice of the
Men harsh; The Women</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 139]</p>

<p>have remarkable soft voices &amp; the younger Women much
expression in their countenances, they are very dark &amp; keep
their skins so dirty that it is hard to tell the true colour of
them, their hair is clotted with dirt &amp; full of vermin, &amp;
as they never wash themselves unless by chance or accident, the
beauty which many of them from regularity of features &amp;
pleasing countenances would be allowed to have, is destroyed. The
Men wear their beards long, their hair which is full of dirt &amp;
vermin they were wear loose or rather clotted with both, &amp;
sometimes ornamented with the teeth, claws &amp;c. of animals stuck
in their hair with gum, several of them have been shaved by our
people &amp; one party after having gone through this operation,
came alongside the Ship again in a few days making signs that they
wished to have it repeated:</p>

<p>We never could prevail on any of them to come on board altho'
they would frequently run all over our boats. Of the whole number I
ever saw or met with, there were only two who were not entirely
naked &amp; those seem'd to be lame, the one an Old Woman, the
other a young boy; some of the women I have seen with a string tied
loose about their necks. The Men have many large scars about their
bodies which they signified to us was done by a sharp shell, but on
what account we could not discover. The Men having lost one of
their front teeth is except a few instances a general custom as is
that of the women losing two</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 140]</p>

<p>joints of the little finger on the left hand; all these customs
we are yet at a loss to account for, but that they are not a badge
of disgrace or infamy is evident from being so general &amp; that
they are fond of shewing them to us when we notice it; one of them
in a party I fell in with up the Harbour took a deal of pains to
shew us the difference between the Ornamental Scars &amp; those
from the wounds of the Spear, he had three of them in his body. The
inside part of the nose between the two nostrils being bored,
appears to be common but not general in both Sexes, they thrust a
bone or stick through it at times, but are very seldom found
wearing it there. Several have been met with very whimsically
painted with red Ochre &amp; pipe Clay both which we find plenty
of; they are great Theives which is common among Savages.</p>

<p>In many places we found straggling Huts, but I never saw more
than 8 or 10 together, these are if possible more wretched than
their Canoes, they are made with small boughs or rather sticks,
cover'd in a miserable manner with bark &amp; leaves of the Cabbage
tree: their height will not admit of entering without stooping or
crawling in; They appear to live cheifly in the Caves &amp; hollows
of the rocks, which Nature has supplied them with, the rocks about
the shore being all mostly shelving &amp; overhanging so as to
afford a tolerable retreat to these miserable creatures &amp;
frequently after</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 141]</p>

<p>passing a whole day in search of food without being able to
procure as much as would make half a reasonable meal they make a
fire at the outer part of these dismal holes which throws a heat
in, but so hard press'd are these poor Devils in the Winter, that
from the hours we have seen them fishing with a light in the Canoe,
they are frequently without two hours rest to themselves, Hunger is
so pressing a call that they cannot quit their endeavors to satisfy
it for any other enjoyment: In heavy rains I have seen the Women
hold a peice of bark over their heads so as to throw the rain clear
of them, but I never notice the Men make any difference, only that
they are not so active in the rain &amp; appear to be cramped. To
speak of the Virtue of the Ladies of this Country, I beleive no one
in the Colony can boast of having received favours; Whether they
are bound by any tie or their Connexions made by promiscuous
intercourse is hard for us to determine; it has been generally
observed that they are very jealous of the women being among us
when we happen to fall in where they are &amp; that the Women are
kept at a distance when we do not come unawares upon them, &amp; a
guard with several lances always ready for their protection has
been usually found; they are very impatient to revenge an affront,
&amp; very soon forget injuries, or any offence that has been given
to them. There has</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 142]</p>

<p>been two hundred of them met with together about Botany Bay, but
except that &amp; the N.o arm of Port Jackson, they are seldom seen
more than 20 or 30 &amp; frequently two &amp; three together: That
large body of them met with @ Botany Bay had a quantity of dried
fish with them, which was the only time that any ^thing) of the
kind had been seen.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by a Convict who absented himself &amp;
remained some days in the Woods, that the Natives were Cannibals,
&amp; that he had seen a party of them eat the flesh of one who
they had killed, the authority is not good yet I think that
circumstance of their taking one of the convicts into the woods
with them after having killed &amp; strip'd him favours the mans
report; &amp; that but a short time before he was executed for the
robbery that induced him to absent himself he affirm'd the truth of
his report; this expedient of flying to the woods for shelter has
been tried by several of them &amp; have found that they have been
obliged to return &amp; be hanged or suffer the most shocking
death; that of being starved. We have every reason to suppose that
they burn the dead, from the number of graves we have open'd &amp;
seen in those which were open'd we found the ashes with many peices
of bone not quite consumed, the ashes appear to be thrown together
&amp; cover'd with earth until raised much as those commonly met
with; it was the appearance</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 143]</p>

<p>that led us first to open one which we met with newly made. They
do not appear to observe any kind of religion.</p>

<p>The land on that part of the Coast which we fell in with is
moderately high &amp; the Sea face rocky, with many sandy beaches
between the projecting points; some parts appear'd barren, others
pleasant Downes, particularly that about the white Cliffs to the
S.oward of Botany Bay which we called Portsdown from a remarkable
clump of trees on it; The land over the sandy bays is in general
woody, as is a very considerable part of the higher lands: A great
distance inland from the Coast about Port Jackson are a chain of
very high Mountains, towards which many excursions has been plann'd
but none yet executed:</p>

<p>Towards the upper part of Port Jackson the Country opens &amp;
is cover'd with long grass growing under the trees, there are some
spots of clear ground round P Jackson but none of considerable
extent until near the head of it, from which, along by the flats
&amp; creeks it improves &amp; near the fresh water at the top of
the creek it is a fine open Country &amp; good soil, to this part
which is called Rose Hill &amp; is about 12 Miles above Sydney
Cove, it is intended early in the present Month to detach a Capt
&amp; Company of Marines with a proportion of Convicts for the
purpose of clearing &amp; cultivating that part of the Country,
which will no doubt</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 144]</p>

<p>be of great use to the Settlement. The wood for building is not
very good, the Gum tree grows very large but the grain is so short
that it is neither strong nor durable, there is a kind of pine
&amp; a bastard kind Mahogany, all of which are used, the latter
makes tolerable good furniture.</p>

<p>The Stock brought to Port Jackson has turn'd to little account,
the sheep nearly all dead, the Bull &amp; Cows missing, either
killed by the Natives or run wild in the woods. Hogs which appear
to thrive the best will be lost for want of food, before grain can
be raised for their support, the cabbage tree affords good food
while it lasts but there is great difficulty in getting it. All
kinds of poultry thrive very well &amp; Goats particularly well,
the great want is grain to support the stock.</p>

<p>To speak of the Seasons &amp; Weather; from our partial trial of
both, I have observed that the weather is generally unsettled at
New &amp; full Moon, at which times on our first arrival we had
tremendous thunder squalls: The Wind frequently changes suddenly to
the S.oward in a strong Gust &amp; generally blows hard afterwards;
We have remarked also that Lightning to the S.oward is an
indication of such strong Winds coming, but I have frequent known
them come on in a sudden gust without a moments warning or any
apparent alteration in the Heavens: In Moderate fair weather, the
Land &amp; Sea Breezes are regular &amp; fresh.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 145]</p>

<p>We found very great &amp; sudden changes in the degree of heat a
shift of wind would rise or lower the Thermometer 14º in less than
10 Minutes on board the Sirius &amp; on shore considerably more. We
observe a change in the face of the Country as the winter
approaches, altho' the Trees are not strip'd of their leaves, there
being a constant succession, which we also found in the vegetable
production of the woods, but during the Winter neither the Grass or
the Trees have the fine green appearance as on our first arrival.
We found a very great variety of shrubs which had beautiful bloom
but scarce any smell in them.</p>

<p>The progress made in the New Settlement, or what the Colony may
promise from its present state I cannot pretend to judge of further
than that I think the quantity of ground clear'd is very
inconsiderable.</p>

<p>November. 2nd: Sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, we left the
Supply at Port Jackson, with the Fishburne &amp; Golden Grove
Transports, both of which it was supposed would be clear'd &amp;
Sail for England in November. We had a fresh Gale &amp; S.o which
soon gave us a good Offing.</p>

<p>3rd. At Noon, we were 37 leagues to the E.tward of P.t Jackson a
strong Gale S.oerly which continued to the 6th: when in 35º:22 S.o
156º:51' Et it hauled round to the East &amp; NE.t</p>

<p>8th: Blew a Strong Gale at NE &amp; at Noon came to the
N.oward.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 146]</p>

<p>8th: It was this day determined to pursue the route to the
E.tward round Cape Horn as the most certain passage from what had
been experienced by others in high S.oern Latitude getting to the
W.tward; &amp; particularly as the Ship had sprung a leak the day
we sailed from Port Jackson was thought the more unfit to beat
against the W.terly winds:</p>

<p>From the 8th to the 11th: Wind &amp; weather very changeable,
then a strong Western Gale promised a good run to the E.tward</p>

<p>13th: We pass'd the South Cape of New Zeeland at 40 leag.s
distance. The 16th: in Latitude 51º.S.o 176ºEt, we again met with
SE &amp; E.tly winds with fine settled weather; these winds
continued to the 22nd veering from SE to E.t &amp; NE by which we
were enabled to make some small progress to the E.tward altho' in 6
days, it was only as many degrees of Longitude.</p>

<p>23rd. A Fresh Gale sprung up from the W.tward &amp; continued to
the 30th in Lat: 53º:38' S.o 203º:45' Et weather mostly fair; the
30th it fell Calm, we had a great quantity of Birds about the Ship,
in the evening a breeze sprung up which was very variable &amp; the
weather unsettled.</p>

<p>31st: Saw several Divers, small Gulls &amp; two Sea Otters.</p>

<p>Long: 227º:30'Et the wind again came to the E.tward with a clear
serene sky, several Pintadoe Birds &amp; Gulls were constantly
about the ship, 3 Pintadoe Birds were caught with hook &amp; line
over the stern; as soon as they were taken they threw up a quantity
of an oily substance; we frequently observed them to feed on some
floating matter which appear'd to us to be what might come from the
fish &amp; float about upon the surface.</p>

<p>9th: The wind again favour'd us &amp; blew strong w hail &amp;
snow.</p>

<p>18: We were under a necessity of putting a stop to the serving
of Essence of Malt having been supplyied with so small a quantity,
part of which was kept at Port Jackson &amp; the quantity remaining
was now not sufficient for those who were attack'd with the
Scurvy.</p>

<p>20th: Several porpoises striped black &amp; white were about the
Ship &amp; a great quantity of Gulls &amp; many Pintadoe birds.</p>

<p>22nd. At Noon, Latd: 57º:17' So Long. 280º:10' Et, saw an Island
of Ice in the course of the day pass'd several more, many Whales
&amp; a variety of Gulls about the Ship.</p>

<p>24th. Had very hazey W.r with hail &amp; snow, passed between
several Islands of Ice: Gulls &amp; pintadoe Birds &amp; a Sea
Otter about [t] ship.</p>

<p>25th. Pass'd several very large &amp; high Islands of Ice, had
frequent Squalls of hail &amp; snow; AM. Soon after day light
several flocks of Ducks &amp; one of Geese flew over the Ship to
the N.oward.</p>

<p>At Noon, we were by Observations of the [sun] &amp; [moon] taken
at 8 AM exactly in the Longitude of Cape Horn &amp; by the Meridien
Observ.n</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 148]</p>

<p>10 leagues S.o of it: we hauled in NebN &amp; the 26th at 6 PM
made the Land on the S.o Coast of Terra del Fuego or the Isl.ds off
it, from NbW to WNW then in Lat: 56º:08.S. I take the W.tern
extreme of Land to be that about Cape Horn: On making this land the
dead reckoning was between 3º &amp; 4º to the E.tward; we took a
fresh departure from the Latitude &amp; Longitude observed.</p>

<p>The Timekeeper was near a degree to the E.tward of the
observations &amp; had been so the three last setts: It appear'd to
be full as much on making the land, but not having an opportunity
of determining exactly which point of land was Cape Horn it was
continued by the same rate allowed on leaving P.t Jackson. We have
some reason to suppose that the cold weather to the S.oward might
affect the Timekeeper, as during the winter months at Port Jackson,
the rate of losing increased to 7" pr day &amp; before we sailed
had regularly come back to 4".77 at which it was fixed. We have
always kept the result of the Lunar Observations carried on by the
daily difference of Longitude, or as often as the weather would
permit, given by the Timekeeper between the times of those
Observations: We observ'd the variation of the Compass off Cape
Horn 25º:00' E.t. As we approach'd Cape Horn we kept the parallel
of 56º:30' S. to see if the Island called Diego Ramirez was, or was
not there to be found: There is not any Island so situated, it was
clear enough for us to see land 7 or 8 leagues, the whole day.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 149]</p>

<p>We conclude that in the Old Charts it is misplaced &amp; that it
is Barnevells Isle which is near the shore in Capn Cooks chart: In
the Vol. of Dr. Hawkesworth which relates to that part of Capn
Cooks first voyage is a Chart which calls an Island, Diego Ramirez
laying S.o or SbW from Cape Horn in Lat.d 56º:30' S.o:</p>

<p>After passing Cape Horn, the wind which had been blowing strong
for several days from the SW &amp; NW, changed &amp; became
variable w fine moderate weather.</p>

thick fog &amp; rain, sometimes light breezes &amp; suddenly

<p>The weather very unsettled: at Noon, the wind fix'd at WSW &amp;
blowed a Hard Gale of wind, which continued to the 19th in the
evening when it became moderate &amp; the wind veering to the SW
clear'd up the weather, this evening the variation of the Compass
was observed 00:04Et. Latd. 45:34 So.Longe. 340:32Et. We passed a
great quantity of Seaweed &amp; many Ice Islands.</p>

<p>21st. One Ice Island only was seen which was the last we met
with, when we passed it, our Latd. 44:16.So. Longe.343:32.Et.; this
the longest day in the So.ern Hemisphere was excessive cold. We
first met with Ice Islands November 23rd. in Lat:37:17.S.&amp;
280:10Et., so that we were 28 days floating with these lumps of
misery in sight &amp; run 836 leagues through between them, which
was frequently rendered very dangerous from the thick fogs which we
had much of after passing Cape Horn, we have been 12 hours
sometimes without being able to see 1 mile round the ship. No
particular occurrence happen'd till the ever memorable 25th on
which day at noon we arrived at the Meridian of Greenwich having
since last passing it, sailed East round the So.Pole: we therefore
drop 360 degrees of Longitude &amp; begin East Longitude again,
repeating Thursday 25th December to make our time correspond with
that at Greenwich: In this Voyage we have had two Christmas days
&amp; it being leap year 367 in the year, what few if any
Navigators can boast of.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 152]</p>

<p>The wind continued in the NW &amp; SW quarters.</p>

<p>29th: At 11 P.M. A large Meteor with an apparent Ball of fire of
a Conic Shape was seen to the NW. It rose 5 degrees above the
Horizon &amp; continued to a minute in sight falling or setting 4
points to the No'ward of its bearing first noticed. The whole space
in that Qr. Of a deep reddish yellow for two minutes before the
glare disappear'd.</p>

<p>As we drew near the Cape of Good Hope we found a very strong NW
current &amp; the wind hauled round, SSW, So. to SE.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jan89" id="jan89"></a>January 1789</p>

<p>Thursday Jan.y. 1st.: Having had some very good observations of
the [sun] &amp; [moon], we stood in for the land till 12 at night,
then off till 2 AM &amp; at 4 saw the Table land Sb E 13
leagues.</p>

<p>At Noon Do. SbE 8 Leag's. Wind variable.</p>

<p>By [sun] &amp; [moon ] the preceding day brought on by
Timekeeper. SSE 7 Leag's. The Timekeeper on making the land
appear'd to be 1½ degree too far to the Et'ward.</p>

<p>Friday. 2nd. At 4 P.M. Finding we could not weather Roben
Island, we bore away &amp; at 5 Anchored on the NE side of it in
9fm. Flag at the Fort W. N. end of the Island NW. So. end SWbW off
shore ¾ of a mile; An officer was sent on shore to the Island but
the Commandant not speaking English (and would not allow the slaves
who could to come up) very little information could be got. He
ordered Bread, many sorts of Friut &amp; Vegetables to be put into
our Boat for the use of the sick</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 153]</p>

<p>&amp; very politely requested, if we had not an immediate
opportunity of getting up to Table Bay, that we could accept as a
testimony of his good wishes all that his garden could afford, the
fruit and vegetables which he sent to out boat afforded a very
seasonable releif to those poor wretches who were in the last stage
of the Scurvy &amp; with the knowledge that we were now within
reach of the means of releif saved several of their lives;</p>

<p>we had 40 Men not able to move &amp; 10 who kept watch that were
deprived of the use of one arm or leg with the Scurvy, the whole
Ships Company were weakly &amp; affected by the disorder in some
degree; we lost 3 men the passage 2 of them just as we came in the
with land:</p>

<p>At daylight nest morning weighed &amp; made sail up to Table
Bay, where we moored at 10 O'Clock we found a Dutch Frigate &amp;
several Merchant Ships of different nations but not one English
among the whole: An officer from the Dutch Frigate came on b'd. to
pay respects for his captain to the English Man of War, this
Compliment &amp; the great hospitality we rec'd. from the
Commandant of Roben Island was very different to what we
experienced on our passage out last year, which alteration we were
at a loss to account for until the return of the Officer who had
been sent to wait on the Governor when we heard of the changes in
Europe &amp; the new Alliances that had been made: We had not the
least</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 154]</p>

<p>account of any of our Transports which sailed from Port Jackson
for England near 3 months before we did.</p>

<p>Sunday: 4th: The sick were landed, a House without the Town
toward the Lions Rump being hired for that purpose.</p>

<p>Monday 5th: A Dutch Ship arrived from Rio Janiero, they informed
us that two of our Transports, the P're. of Wales &amp; Borrowdale
were there when she sailed; the P're. of Wales had lost her
Bowsprit, the Master and great part of the people were dead &amp;
the rest in such a state that when the Harbor Master went on board
her, he was obliged to take his Boats Crew to get her into an
Anchor: the Borrowdale did not arrive there for sometime after the
P're. of Wales, nor had she suffer'd so much.</p>

<p>Wednesday 7. In a strong SE gale our Bt.Br. Cable parted, we
brought up immediately with the Sheet.</p>

<p>Sunday. 11th. Having started all the salt water &amp; got all
the lumber &amp; weight out of the Ship that was to be landed:
Heel'd Ship to examine the leaks; found a large bolt hole, the bolt
having been eaten entirely through. We found two other spike nail
holes through the skirting boards, plugged &amp; secured them all
&amp; we found the Ship did not make much water afterwards.</p>

<p>Monday. 19th. A Dutch Frigate arrived from Batavia, had been 37
days out; they informed us that the Alexander Transport, Lieut.
Shortland Agent was there: He with the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 155]</p>

<p>Alexander &amp; Friendship persever'd in the passage to the
No'ward when the P're. of Wales &amp; Borrowdale parted Co. off
Port Stephens. In the streights of Macassar they were in so
distress'd a situation from sickness as to be under the necessity
of sinking the Friendship that with both Crews they might be able
to Navigate the Alexander &amp; when she arrived at Batavia the
Dutch Frigate that gives us this account sent an Officer &amp;
people on board her to furl the Sails &amp; secure the Ship; They
continued on board with some people from an English East Indiaman
to refit the rigging &amp; while their own miserable Crew were
landed for their recovery: when this Ship left Batavia the
Alexander was fitted ready for Sea &amp; waited only for the
recovery of her people.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 27th. Came in a Portuguese Ship, that had been blown
out of this Bay &amp; kept at Sea 5 weeks in a wretched situation
having but few of the Crew on board when she drove to Sea &amp; 400
Slaves all sickly &amp; of which they did not bring in 100
again.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="feb89" id="feb89"></a>February
1789</p>

<p>Tuesday. 3rd Feb'ry. A Brig much like a Man of War passed
between Green Pt. &amp; Roben Island, hauled in for the Bay then
bore up &amp; run to Sea to the No'ward of Roben Island:</p>

<p>Friday. 6th. A large French Ship passed through the Bay in the
same manner as the Brig had done.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 11th. Had accounts from a dutch ship from Rio
Janiero, that the Borrowdale &amp; P're. of Wales Transports</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 156]</p>

<p>were both ready for Sea &amp; at Single Anchor the middle of
Dec'r.</p>

<p>Wednesday.18th. The Alexander arrived, We found by Lieut.
Shortland that the accounts given by the Dutch Frigate correspond
with his account of their distresses.</p>

<p>Lieut. Shortland discover'd a dry sand bank with a shoal of
considerable extent &amp; an Island on the Coast of New South
Wales; the sand bank he fixes in 29(:20(.S. 158( 48( Et. Which he
called Middleton's Shoal: The Island he fixes in 28(:10(.So.
159(.50( Et. Lies from the Shoal by their run N35(E 97 miles this
he named Sr.Chas. Middleton's Island.</p>

<p>Thursday. 19th: The Haspy So.Sea Whaler arrived, she left
England in October, by her we hear that there had not any Transport
been taken up New South Wales but that they only waited for the
accounts of our Arrival in that country.</p>

<p>Friday. 20th: Having taken in as much of those articles as were
most wanted at Port Jackson as the Ship could stow, at 10 AM
weighed &amp; made sail, at Noon were hauling out round the No. end
of Roben Island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="mar89" id="mar89"></a>March 1789</p>

<p>From which to the 10th of March, we had unfavorable winds, we
also experienced very strong &amp; strange Currents for until 5th
they run to the NW &amp; when in Lat'd. 40(.S. Long' 20( Et. They
took a turn &amp; set with greater force to the Et. &amp; SE: The
5th the weather was very unsettled &amp; fogs banks very like 2
Islands. It came on to blow a Gale of wind suddenly at So. &amp;
continued between So.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 157]</p>

<p>&amp; to the 9th. On the 10th. The weather clear'd up with a
fresh gale at SW in Latd. 41(:52(.S. Long'd.22(:11( E &amp; but
little current by the Timekeeper; the 12th. It fell calm, after
which a fresh gale sprung up at NE &amp; blowed a Hard Gale of Wind
on the 15th on which day it shifted to NW in a heavy squall. The
Wind continued between NNE, SW &amp; Wt. to the 7th. April with few
&amp; short intervals of SW winds, which usually came after heavy
rain with the NW winds; during this time we had very unsettled
weather with some hard Gales, violent squalls &amp; a very high
confused Sea.</p>

<p>The 22nd of March it blowed so hard &amp; the sea so high &amp;
irregular that altho' the wind was abaft the beam the ship could
not bear the reef'd Foresail, this obliged us to bring too under
the balanced Mizen for some hours till the sea became more
regular.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="apr89" id="apr89"></a>April 1789</p>

<p>7th Had moderate breezes from the NNW &amp; NNE with clear
weather,</p>

<p>the 11th the weather became squally with Fog &amp; rain, 16th
Fair weather for a few hours, enabled us to get some good
observations of [sun] &amp; [moon] &amp; a Meridian Alt. for the
Latitude, 5 minutes after which a thick fog came on again &amp;
continued to the 19th with very unsettled weather sometimes Calm,
then blow very strong a few hours &amp; fall Calm again. The 19th.
a Hard Gale of wind came on suddenly at SW &amp; on the 20th came
to the So'ward &amp; blew with such violence that we could not
carry either of the reef'd Courses, this day</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 158]</p>

<p>we were so unfortunate as to have three storm staysails give way
at nearly the same time, that we had only the balanced Mizen left:
the 21st. Knowing that we were settling down upon the land &amp;
being doubtful of clearing it as the wind came to SSE, we set the
reef'd Foresail before night in case of falling suddenly in the
Swilly, we passed this night in the most anxious situation but saw
nothing.</p>

<p>22nd. Soon after noon the double reef'd Mainsail was set the
wind being dead upon the shore &amp; blew with great violence with
thick rain at 3P.M. Saw the land on the lee bow, the weather too
thick to make out what part of the Coast it was &amp; not being
able to weather it, we wore, in hopes of clearing the land to the
W.ward, the Ship was already much pressed with sail yet in our
situation it was necessary to make more to beat clear either to the
W'ward or E'ward, to effect which One reef was let out of the
Mainsail, the balance taken off the Mizen &amp; the close reef'd
Fore &amp; Main Topsails set over the single reef'd Courses &amp;
all hands stationed ready, whatever might happen; as 1st to fall in
with the land to the W'ward could not weather it &amp; had just
room the wear clear, it was very dark, violent squalls with heavy
rain; the Hand of Providence now interfered, the Ship lay two
points higher standing to the Et.ward than she did before on the
same tack, which gave us some small degree of hopes that</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 159]</p>

<p>we should clear the land: At 2 AM. We again fell in with the
land to the Et.ward about a point before the lee beam, we had no
alternative being close under it to push on with our only chance,
this proved a most fortunate circumstance for had we seen it on the
lee bow so near us we should have wore &amp; then all hands must
have perish'd; this land was no sooner abaft the beam than the ship
broke off those two points which had enabled her to reach to
windward of it at about 2 Miles dis't. but how near we passed to
those rocks lying off it we are ignorant of as breakers could not
be distinguish'd from that of the Sea which was all a breach to the
Horizon:</p>

<p>This point of land appeared to be Tasmans head for we saw the
land on to the N.ward as we passed it; from which it appears that,
that point which we could not weather standing to the W.ward was
the So.Cape of Van Diemans land, we passed to windward of Maria's
Islands, saw them twice; during the whole of the time from our
first seeing the land till clear of Maria's Islands, the Ship was
so press'd as to keep the pumps constantly going, the Sea washed
away the Figure Head &amp; a part of the Cutwater. In the situation
the Ship was in all night, it was really pleasing to find the whole
Ships Company with Confidence in their Officers &amp; a just sense
of their danger particularly attentive &amp; cheerfully alert. Soon
after we had passed</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 160]</p>

<p>Maria's Islands it fell little wind for some hours &amp; then
blew again with great violence, we found that the knees on which
the security of the Bowsprit in part depended, were started &amp;
worked considerably, we therefore got all the weight from the
Bowsprit &amp; some additional securities to it. To the 25th we had
very unsettled weather this &amp; the 26th Mod't. light Breezes
which continued to 7 PM of the 27th when it suddenly came on a Gale
of Wind with Thunder, Light'ning &amp; heavy rain, At Noon. Mod't
Weather.</p>

<p>28: To 6 PM Light Breezes with rain wind variable: At 7 Blow'd
strong &amp; came on as suddenly as the last evening, the wind in
the night shifted frequently Wt. to No. &amp; a great confused
Sea.</p>

<p>29th: The gale continued with frequent &amp; heavy squalls at
Wt. &amp; NW, much light'ning in the night.</p>

<p>30th. AM The weather became Modt. &amp; fair, wind No'erly.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="may89" id="may89"></a>May 1789</p>

<p>May.1st: At 5 P.M It again came on to blow very hard at No.
&amp; shifted to SW at 2 AM in a violent squall &amp; severe
light'ning; At Noon Moderate.</p>

<p>2. Fresh Gales from SW to WNW with frequent hard squalls</p>

<p>3d. Towards the evening fell little wind &amp; calm at
times.</p>

<p>4th Calm till 5P.M then suddenly come on a fresh Gale at ENE.
Much light'ning during the night.</p>

<p>5th: Steady fresh gale from ENE to SE with fair weather.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 161]</p>

<p>6th: Coming on to blow very strong from the So'ward, we at Noon
fell in with the land to leeward of Port Jackson, the No.Head bore
S.50(W dist. 10 leagues: Found the Timekeeper [? 1 ¼] degree to the
W'ward.</p>

<p>7th: Wind continued to the So'ward. The ship fell to
leeward.</p>

<p>8th: At 4 PM fell calm, at 10 a breeze from the land enabled us
to stand along shore to the So'ward till 6 AM when the wind again
came to the So'ward/ At Noon after Tacking twice, we were reaching
in for the No.Head of Port Jackson</p>

<p>9th: Falling to leeward of the No.Head we made a trip with
success &amp; at 3 pass'd between the Heads; at 6 Anchored in
Sydney Cove where we found the Supply.</p>

<p>We found that a Native Man had been taken by force by Lieut.Ball
Commander of the Supply, for the Governor it not be(^ing) possible
to persuade any of them to come amongst us; He was for some time
kept with an Iron about his leg &amp; when on board the Supply
going down the Harbour, he jump'd overboard but was taken up &amp;
prevented from joining his Countrymen &amp; Old Companions who were
near. He was so well reconciled to his situation when we arrived
that he was allowed to walk about by himself; His Irons were taken
off, when an Old Man &amp; his child were brought up to Sydney Cove
with the small pox out on them soon after this Old Man, another
Native Man was found.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 162]</p>

<p>in the same situation, with a child laying by him, both of which
were brought up to the Hospital; The Native at the Governors
(Arrabanoo) met them without fear of the disorder by which it was
then supposed that he was ignorant of that disorder or that he had
had it &amp; was recover'd. The two Men died before we arrived, but
the children were then on the recovery: From the great number of
dead Natives found in every part of the Harbour, it appears that
the small pox had made dreadful havock among them, we did not see a
Canoe or a Native the whole way coming up the Harbour &amp; were
told that scarce any had been seen lately except laying dead in
&amp; about their miserable habitations, whence it appears that
they are deserted by their Companions as soon as the disorder comes
out on them &amp; those who are attack'd wt. this disorder</p>

<p>left to shift for themselves: We judge this from their having
been found not buried in every part of the Harbour, some has been
found with a child laying dead close to them &amp; some who have
apparently used their utmost exertions to get at water, having been
found laying dead between a Cave &amp; a run of Water. How this
disease came among them, or whether they were strangers to it
before is doubtful. The two children beforemention'd, recover'd
soon after our arrival &amp; were placed; the Boy with the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 163]</p>

<p>Surgeon at the Hospital he was about 7 year of age, &amp; the
girl about 13 was put under the charge of the Parsons Wife.</p>

<p>A party of Marines was discharged from the Sirius to compleat
the Battalion, which had been reduced during our absence by 6
having been executed together for robbing the provisions store, 1
killed in a quarrel with other Marines &amp; 3 lost in the woods
&amp; perished. Capt. Shea we also found had been dead a
considerable time.</p>

<p>The Golden Grove Transport in her passage to Norfolk Island in
October 1788 discover'd a shoal of considerable extent &amp; which
we suppose from the account of its situation, to be the same that
Mr.Shortland discover'd &amp; named Middletons Shoal in July last
&amp; gave an account of at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>18th. Arrabanoo, the Native of the Governor's died of the small
pox which it is supposed he caught from the Native Children he was
taken ill about the time of their recovery: He was a great loss
being quite familiarized &amp; very happy, quite one of the
Governor's family &amp; had got some of our language as well as
communicated much of theirs; He was remarkably good temper'd &amp;
had he lived would no doubt been of infinite use to us.</p>

<p>19th. A party from the Sirius to Rose Hill, to which place a
Company of Marines &amp; considerable numbers of Convicts</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 164]</p>

<p>had been detached in October last for the purpose of cultivating
that part of the Country, their situation is pleasant, the soil
good, the Country open &amp; promises much to the success of the
Colony; It is 12 miles above Sydney Cove &amp; 4 from the flatts
from which a creek runs up Navigable for Barges or Lighters,
observing the tides. We met with 6 Canoes as went up &amp; saw the
same number of Fires as we returned in the Cove just below the
flatts.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jun89" id="jun89"></a>June 1789</p>

<p>June. 2nd. Twenty Canoes passed Sydney Cove going down the
Harbour, this was the first time any number of them had been seen
together since the small pox having been among them.</p>

<p>Saturday.6th. The Supply sailed for Norfolk Island with an
Officer &amp; additional number of Marines &amp; Provisions for
that Island: The Governor &amp; Capt. Hunter went to the</p>

<p>N.ward to trace those parts of Broken Bay which had been left
unexamined, the Master of the Sirius &amp; a Mid. was sent round
with two boats to meet the party who walked over:</p>

<p>Thursday.11th. A Native Man was met with at Botany Bay who had
just recover'd of the small pox, He had as child with him &amp;
made signs that the Mother of it had died of that disease.</p>

<p>Wednesday.17th. The Governor &amp; Party returned from
Broken</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 165]</p>

<p>Bay; In the branch running to the NW out of the SW arm they
discover'd that an opening round an Island, which had not been
examined before, led to a fresh water River up which they went
about 20 Miles from the Island at the mouth of it, when they were
obliged to return for want of Provisions to enable them to proceed,
when they gave up their pursuit they had 6 fm. water &amp; made use
of it both for drinking &amp; cooking. They met with but few
Natives &amp; found some that died of the small pox laying near the
path between Port Jackson &amp; Broken Bay. In a Cove of the So.
Arm they met with a woman who had just recover'd but was so reduced
&amp; weak that she could not accompany her Companion who ran away
on the boat coming in near where they were, this poor creature
crawled in among the long Grass to hide herself &amp; was by chance
found in that situation, after having received every releif that
could be given her, she became familiar as her fears subsided, but
was not to be found when the Boats came away: By Capt. Hunters
Observation taken near the Inner So.Head of Broken Bay it appears
to be 15 Miles to the N.ward of Port Jackson.</p>

<p>Friday.19th. The Sirius went over the (th) above on the No. side
of the Harbour, to be clear'd &amp; refitted for the purpose of
examining the Ground Tier &amp; strength'ning her upper</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 166]</p>

<p>works with Riders: in the night 3 of the Natives appear'd on the
shore near the Ship, where they remained a short time &amp; went
away, they did not speak &amp; we observed them creeping along to
avoid making any noise, this appear'd to be a visit of curiosity to
see who they had near them.</p>

<p>Saturday.20th. In Spring Cove 70 of the Natives were seen in one
party by our fishing boat.</p>

<p>Thursday.25th. The Governor went to Rose Hill in consequence of
receiving information of a large peice of Water being discover'd
some distance to the W.ward of Rose Hill, but he being anxious to
pursue his discovery of the River in Broken Bay left this for the
present.</p>

<p>Monday.29th: The Governor, Capt.Hunter &amp; party went to
Broken Bay to trace the River to its source, The Master as before
went round to meet this Party in the South Arm with three weeks
Provisions.</p>

<p>Tuesday.30th. An Officer return'd from a Visit to those at Rose
Hill, during his stay there, they made a party to the W.ward 18 or
20 Miles when they were obstructed by water, which they found to be
fresh &amp; apparently a part of a very considerable river; they
found Natives there who had traps for catching Ducks great
quantities of which were seen; they also had snares for taking
Opossums &amp; other Animals.</p>

<p>This part of the River</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 167]</p>

<p>which Capt. Tench fell in with bore nearly West, from Rose Hill,
estimated distance 18 Miles; It is conjectured to be a part of that
River which the Governor is now gone to trace; they did not observe
any tide but a constant set to the NEbN in which direction the
branch they fell in with lay; Its breadth they reckon about 80
fathoms &amp; to appearances deep water; Capt. Tench attempted
crossing it in an Old Canoe which was found there, but was obliged
to give it up by her filling, the Banks appear'd very high &amp; as
if they were subjected to great Torrents in Rainy Season; In this
excursion they met with level open Country for some Miles &amp; the
Grass short, so as not to be troublesome in walking.</p>

<p>Near the banks on the Et. Side they found a party of Natives
sitting round a fire broiling a Kanguroo Rat, they all ran away as
soon as they discover'd any Person near them. Amongst other things
found there, was a peice, made of the skins of small animals sew'd
or laced together, somepart was of the Opossum skin, the rest of
some animal the fur much superior; these were curiously carved on
the inside, every skin having a different pattern &amp; the whole
formed a peice that was supposed they might use to cover a child
with: The Needle they use was found; It is a hard</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 168]</p>

<p>peice of wood much in size &amp; shape of a small bodkin, with
which they make holes (it not having an eye) to receive the thread
which was found &amp; appears to be the sinewy fibres from the tail
of some small animal.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jul89" id="jul89"></a>July 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday.7th. A second party return'd from Rose Hill after having
visited the River that had been discover'd to the Wt.ward, some
small distance lower down than the former party had been, they
supposed it to be fordable but did not venture on account or a
strong set &amp; a fall with it: One of the part crossed it in an
Old Canoe buoy'd up bundles of Reeds &amp; the wild fig tree which
they found would swim, they found Wild Yams on both sides of the
River.</p>

<p>Tuesday.14th. Finding that the Governor was in the Nt. Arm we
sent a boat for him &amp; his party, on this boat landing to the
utter astonishment of all in her they saw the Sailmaker who had
been missing 3 days, going about the Hill close to the Ship
Saturday afternoon, he lost himself &amp; wandered into the woods;
parties were sent in all directions each day to look for him &amp;
to no purpose &amp; boats along the shore Monday &amp; Tuesday, on
which days Guns were fired on board the Sirius to direct him to the
Ship, the Guns on Tuesday morn'g being heard by the Governors party
in the lower part</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 169]</p>

<p>of the Harbour, they supposed to cause to be a Man lost &amp; in
their walk towards Middle Harbor to look for a Boat found the print
of a Man's foot with a shoe on which served to convince them that
they had judged right &amp; determin'd them to search for him; they
fired a volley of Musquets &amp; were soon after by a single
Musquet, which being repeated on both sides, they soon came within
hail &amp; calling to the lost Man to stand still they soon found
him; His joy on seeing them was such that for some time he was like
an Idiot.</p>

<p>This Man experienced a most singular deliverance from perishing
in the Woods; He had not more than half a dozen charges of powder
when he left the Ship &amp; no provisions; altho' he tried to fire
his Musquet till he wore the flint to a stump he could not get it
to go off, only at night to get a fire to rest by; from this
circumstance alone he was enabled to answer the Governors Party
when they first began firing vollies for him then he again had the
same good fortune, his Gun not missing fire on either of these
occasions &amp; his stock of Amunition just sufficient for those
purposes. The Governor return'd the same evening to Sydney Cove,
they had traced all the braches of the River which they discover'd
in their last visit to Broken Bay; About 3 Mile within</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 170]</p>

<p>the entrance of the River it branched away to the So. 6 or 7
Miles in which were other inconsiderable &amp; shoal branches from
this the Main River run some Miles then taking a SW direction &amp;
branching away to the No'ward which branch was extensive but shoal
water. Capt. Hunter observed the Latitude 3 Miles below that past
where it was too shoal for the boats to proceed, to be 33:21So. The
Main Channel to the SW took many windings, following which until
they got into very shoal water with very large hard stones of which
the Natives make their hatchets &amp;c. &amp; at the beginning of
the falls, they found themselves at the foot of a hill which they
ascended, Capt. Hunter observed the Latitude on it 33:37So.The
Governor named it Richmond Hill.</p>

<p>As they proceeding up the River, the Trees had much the
appearance of there being great torrents in a rainy Season, Grass
Mud &amp; peices of timber were found in them measured 30 feet from
the surface of the River to that of the Tree where they had been
lodged in the great freshes or Torrents. This River by Captn.
Hunters estimated distances following the course of the Main River
runs 55 Miles to Richmond Hill which is by do. 27 Miles West &amp;
by Observation 2 Miles So. of the Inner South Head of Broken Bay;
This</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 171]</p>

<p>River, the Governor named the Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>Thursday.16th. The Boats returned from Broken Bay, they met with
a Man Woman &amp; Child, the woman was the same that they met with
before in the So.Arm just recovering from the Small Pox, who was
now quite recover'd of the disease but one of her legs was
contracted, this Family would have been taken by force but the wind
not being fair, the Officer in the Boat did not think it a proper
opportunity.</p>

<p>Friday.31st. The Parson &amp; the Native Girl went down the
Harbor to endeavour to have an interview with the Natives, they met
with a party of them, some of whom the Girl said were her
relations, she told them how well she was treated that she had
recover'd by the care taken of her &amp; that whe was very happy
&amp; used every persuasion to get one or more of them to return
with her, but to no purpose.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="aug89" id="aug89"></a>August 1789</p>

<p>Sunday. Augt. 2nd. The Surgeon General with the Native boy went
about the Harbour for the same purpose, they soon met with a party
of the Natives who knew the boy, but they could not prevail on any
(of them) to come with them, the boy was much inclined to join the
naked tribe.</p>

<p>Saturday.8th. The Supply arrived; having landed the party of
Marines, Stores &amp;c. at Norfolk Island, she proceeded in search
of Middleton's Shoal &amp; Island discover'd by Mr. Shortland but
did not meet with either, after having passed over</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 172]</p>

<p>their situation as given by him; Nor did theyi meet with that
shoal seen by Mr Blackburne in the Golden Grove &amp; was supposed
to be part of that which Mr. Shortland had named Middletons
Shoal.</p>

<p>Monday. 10th. The Carpenter with a part of the Crew only, came
on board to examine into &amp; repair the Ships defects for which
purpose she had long since been clear'd.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 18th. A Party went down the Harbour to take a Native if
a good opportunity affor'd, they met with several in the No.Arm
&amp; found them very friendly, they did not take much notice of
the Native boy who accompanied the Party or the Boy of them, they
were a considerable time with them but had not an opportunity of
taking one.</p>

<p>Thursday. 27th. Capt. Hunter went by the Sea Coast to Broken
Bay, to examine the Bays &amp;c. between Port Jackson &amp; it; Two
boats were sent round with the 1st. Lieut. to meet them &amp;
proceed on the Survey of Broken Bay, at 2 in the afternoon the
boats arrived at Broken Bay, &amp; met Capt. Hunter there the next
morning. During our stay in the So.Arm , only three of the Natives
were met with &amp; but few other seen.</p>

<p>Tuesday. Sept.8th. Having survey'd the Bay, South &amp; SW Arms
up to near the entrance of the Hawkesbury, return'd to Port
Jackson.</p>

<p>Broken Bay is easily known when to the So.ward of it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 173]</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="sep89" id="sep89"></a>September
1789</p>

<p>By the land of the So.Head which forms a high round bluff to the
Sea from a low neck, &amp; when the entrance of the Bay is well
open another bluff Head will shew itself, round which is the South
Arm; As you approach the entrance an Island which lies in the Bay
&amp; off the So. &amp; SW Arms will appear &amp; very high toward
the Sea, this is the mark to lead you into either of those Arms
passing the the So.ward of the Island, the SW Arm lays from it
about SW ½W by Compass, &amp; the South Arm nearly So..</p>

<p>The South Arm has fresh water in several of the Coves; there is
a flat at the entrance which extends more than 2/3 of the Channel
over from the Et. Point, between which &amp; the Wt. shore is 3 fm.
at low water &amp; shoaling very gradually on the bank: Going into
this Arm steer in for the Wt. point keeping the land forming the
Et. Point or Inner So.Head open until well over on the Wt. shore,
which keep on board 'till the No.Head of the Bay comes on with the
Inner So.Head, then you may haul over to the Et.ward, after passing
this flat there is not any thing found that will take a ship up in
the fair way up to the Arm or into any of the Coves, that a Ship
may chuse a birth as may be most convenient.</p>

<p>Just within the inner South Head, Capt. Hunter observed the
Latitude 33:35½.S.&amp; at the upper part of the So. Arm 33:41.
This Arm the Governor has named Pitt Water.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 174]</p>

<p>There is a middle ground with less than 3 fathoms on it in some
parts, near the entrance(^or outer part) of the SW Arm, there is
good room on both sides it shoals gradually to the Middle ground
when near it, the Et. side is deepest water &amp; best channel as
you are landlock'd on that side when abreast of the Middle ground.
There is a rock lays a small distance of the Pt. forming the Arm
above two little sandy bays which you avoid by not opening the
No.Head of the Bay with the Et. end of the Island until the length
of that point, then by keeping it just open you avoid the Middle
Ground to the Et.ward, the water near the shore on the Et. side is
deep:</p>

<p>When you are the length of the No. point forming a branch to the
NW out of this Arm you are above the Middle Ground &amp; may anchor
where you please in this Arm in which are several branches &amp;
Coves forming very good Harbour with good depth of water &amp;
fresh water in several of the Coves: the branch leading to the NW
has a large flat near ½ way over from the No. shore, to which in
the Channel up it shoals gradually to 3 feet.</p>

<p>As you come into this branch, an Island will shew itself to the
NNW about 2 Miles up, there is a flat round to the So. &amp;
Et.ward some parts of which dry at low water, but there is a very
good Channel round the No. part of it &amp; when to the No'ward
&amp; Wt'ward of this Island the opening leading to the Hawkesbury
River will shew itself to the Wt'ward, between two Islands which
forms the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 175]</p>

<p>entrance of it, in going to which you leave two large openings
to the No.ward, these are large peices of water but too shoal for
anything except boats.</p>

<p>The rive Hawkesbury following the Course of the Main Channel is
by Captain Hunter's estimated distance 55 Miles, to the falls, near
the foot of Richmond Hill on which Capt. Hunter Obs'd Latitude
33:37.S., &amp; near the top of a shoal branch of the River leading
to the No.ward 33:21.S. which is some miles to the No.ward of any
part of the No. Arm of the Bay as examined by our Boats.</p>

<p>The North Arm of Broken Bay is very shoal, with a large flat
laying off the entrance of it on which the Sea breaks a
considerable distance out except in very fine weather: It is only
fit for boats through a very narrow Channel &amp; frequently
dangerous.</p>

<p>The Bay, except that part on the No. side just mention'd,
appears to be clear ground with regular soundings in Behind both
the rocky points at the So. end of the sandy beaches in the Bay is
good shelter for Boats in any weather, or for small Vessels to push
for if caught in the Bay &amp; not able to reach the So. or SW
Arms; I think either of these bights far more safe than to attempt
the No. Arm. By Captain Hunter's Observation the entrance of Broken
Bay is 16 Miles to the No.ward of Port Jackson, the Coast</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 176]</p>

<p>between forms several bights, two of which a boat might shelter
in if caught upon the shore &amp; could not reach either of the
Harbours, the one is round the No.Head of Port Jackson between the
high Cliffs &amp; the Sandy beach, the other is in that bight off
which is a reef of rocks about 3 Miles to the No.ward of Port
Jackson; going along the shore to &amp; from Broken Bay twice in
the Boats I observed that the flood set to the So.ward &amp; the
ebb to the No.ward regular; We observed the tides at Broken Bay to
be nearly the same as at Port Jackson.</p>

<p>Tuesday.15th. A Party went to visit the River to the W.ward of
Rose Hill; they found that the freshes had been very great &amp;
marks of its rising near 30 feet, the course of the stream when
they left it they supposed to be 7 knots.</p>

<p>Sunday.20th. Captain Hunter with the Masters of the Sirius &amp;
Supply went to Botany Bay to survey it</p>

<p>Thursday.24th: The Purser of the Sirius being down the Harbor to
get Cabbage Tree, was met by some Natives who took an opportunity
of stealing his Axes &amp; running away on being pursued they left
two children behind them, these were taken to the boat, very soon
pacified &amp; even went to sleep in the boat, one 7 or 8 the other
not more than 2 years old, some considerable time after this, the
Men appear'd again &amp; were given to understand that they
should</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 177]</p>

<p>not have the Children until they brought back the Axes, they
after some hesitation fetch'd the axes &amp; took the Children,
they did not seem to care about the eldest but were very anxious
about the little one.</p>

<p>Saturday.26th: The Man usually employ'd shooting for the Ship;
was near the Middle Harbor suddenly attack'd attack'd by the
Natives with stones, he did not see them till a stone passed close
to his head, looking round he saw 3 of them with Clubs &amp; spears
advancing toward him, he gave them the contents of his Musquet
which then was loaded with small shot, this they did not mind only
by standing still &amp; gave a shout, in a very short time He saw
50 of them had got together &amp; were advancing towards him wt.
spears &amp; clubs making a great noise; He was now well prepared
having loaded with large Buck shot while they were collecting: He
stood his ground to receive them, letting them advance to within
about 50 yards fired among the thick of them, two fell, the others
ran off immediately taking their two dead or wounded Companions
with them, the Man being alone did not follow them.</p>

<p>Wednesday.30th. Captain Hunter returned from Botany Bay, having
survey'd the Bay &amp; taken an eye sketch of the branches, all
except that to the NW which they only traced a few miles; they met
but few Natives</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 178]</p>

<p>those were all friendly. In some of the Caves, skeletons of some
&amp; loose bones of others were found, who had no doubt died of
the small pox by their bodies not having been removed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="oct89" id="oct89"></a>October 1789</p>

<p>Monday. 5th: October. A Vessel of 12 Tons was launch'd which was
the first built in the Country: Her construction was that of the
Lighter &amp; of an easy draught of water for the purpose of
carrying Stores &amp; Provisions over the Flats to Rose Hill.</p>

<p>Wednesday.7. The Governor was to Rose Hill to trace a peice of
water near it, supposed by those who first fell in with it to
communicate with the NW Arm of Botany Bay.</p>

<p>Saturday.10. He returned, fell in with a fresh water River about
4 Miles from Rose Hill to the So.ward &amp; which had many
windings, they followed the course of it down on one side of the
banks, not having a boat, as far as the Gullies, which they were
obliged to walk round would admit of, they found a rise of 4 feet
where the water was fresh &amp; some distance below that part they
met the Salt Water, which had every appearance of communicating
with Botany Bay or a small distance to the So.ward of it with the
Sea, but this for want of a Boat they could not ascertain, being
upon the forked part of</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 179]</p>

<p>a branch, at one part of which a Kanguroo was closely pursued by
the Greyhound that they had with them &amp; took to the Water, the
Dog followed &amp; got hold of the Kanguroo, the Kanguroo attack'd
the Dog &amp; tore him so much that one of the People was obliged
to go in &amp; cut the Kanguroo's throat to save the Dog.</p>

<p>Saturday. 31st. The Sirius, Supply, Battalion &amp; Convicts put
to 2/3 allowance of Provisions.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="nov89" id="nov89"></a>November
1789</p>

<p>Saturday. Nov.7th: Having repaired the defects of the Sirius
compleated her bottom &amp; fixed the necessary Riders; We went
over to Sydney Cove where the repairs to the upper works could be
more conveniently done.</p>

<p>Sunday 8th: Mr. Hill one of the Mates having been absent since
Thursday &amp; finding that he had left Sydney Cove early Friday
morning &amp; landed on the No.shore to walk round to the Cove
where the Ship was refitting we concluded some accident had
happen'd to him, several parties were sent to the No.shore, Boats
up &amp; down the Harbour to endeavor to meet with him, Guns were
fired onb'd. the Sirius every two hours from daylight till 8 at
night, all to no purpose.</p>

<p>Monday.9. Parties &amp; Boats as yesterday without success.</p>

<p>Tuesday.10th. Parties &amp;c. continued: One of the Boats was
attack'd by the Natives in the No.Arm, these people had met the
boats crew &amp; been some time together quite friendly</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 180]</p>

<p>Soon after the Natives left them, they were surprised with
several Spears flying among them &amp; not a Native to be seen at
that moment, they soon appear'd &amp; were advancing toward the
boat, when a Musquet ball was fired among them they stop'd which
gave the people time to get out of their reach with the boat, none
of our people were hurt altho' the Spears passed through amongst
them.</p>

<p>Wednesday.11th. The Supply sailed for Norfolk Island with
Convicts &amp; Provisions for that place.</p>

<p>Thursday.12th. We left off firing Guns, the Parties &amp; boats
all returned without meeting with the smallest trace of the
unfortunate young man, who, there is scarce a doubt had been kill'd
by the Natives, many of them at that time being about the
No.shore.</p>

<p>Sunday.15th. A Man belonging to the Supply who had left her
before she sailed &amp; ran into the Woods, gave himself up, he had
been absent 11 days, he heard all our Guns, but his intentions not
being to return just then, he did not avail himself of so favorable
an opportunity of directing himself back; but after this he was
reduced to the necessity of returning to take the punishment
awaiting him or perish in the Woods.</p>

<p>Saturday.21st. The Sirius fishing boat was attack'd by the
Natives in one of the lower Coves just as they were leaving</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 181]</p>

<p>the shore, four Musquet balls were fired before the Natives
retreated, their spears passed over &amp; in the boat, one struck
in her &amp; broke, very luckily they all passed clear of the
people in the boat. Another boat was also attacked this day, laying
at a Grapnel off a point of the No.Arm, several spears were thrown,
on which the people moved farther off; A great number of Natives
then appear'd, the Women came close to the rocks &amp; used every
wanton lure to entice our people to land, when the Women came
forward a party of Men were observed to walk away, no doubt to be
ready for an attack if our people had been so improvident as to
land, this artifice having been practised by them before, the
people were well aware of it.</p>

<p>Wednesday.25th: Governor Phillip judging it necessary that a
Native should be taken by force, (no endeavor to persuade them to
come among us having succeeded) I was order'd on this service,
having the Master, two Petty Officers &amp; a Boats Crew with me in
one of the Governors boats: As we went down the Harbour we got some
fish from the boats that lay off the No.Arm fishing &amp; proceeded
up the Arm in which we saw a great number of Natives on both sides
&amp; several landed on the beach at the No.Cove hauling their
canoes up after them; As we got near the upper part of the No.Cove,
we held two</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">'Taking of Colbee &amp; Benalon. 25 Novr
1789'</p>

<p>large fish up to them &amp; had the good luck to draw two of
them away from a very large party by this bait, these People came
around the rocks where they left their spears &amp; met us on the
beach near the boat &amp; at a distance from their Companions
sufficient to promise success without losing any lives, they
eagerly took the fish, four of the boats crew were kept in the boat
which was winded &amp; back'd close to the beach where the tow
Natives &amp; the rest of our People were, they were dancing
together when the Signal was given by me and the two poor devils
were seiz'd &amp; handed into the boat in an instant; The Natives
who were very numerous all round us, on seeing us seize those two,
immediately advanced with their Spears &amp; Clubs, but we were too
quick for them, being out of reach before they got to that part of
the beach where the boat lay, they were entering on the beach just
as every body was in the boat &amp; as she did not take the ground
we pulled immediately out without having occasion to fire a
Musquet; The noise of the Men, Crying &amp; screaming of the Women
&amp; Children together with the situation of the two miserable
wretches in our possession was really a most distressing scene;
they were much terrified, one of them particularly so, the other
frequently called out to those on shore apparently very much
enraged with them, they followed the boat on both sides as far as
the points of the Cove &amp; then</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 183]</p>

<p>Returned to the beach, we saw them take up the two fish which
their two unfortunate friends dropt on being seiz'd; On our landing
at Sydney Cove we were met by Nanbarry, the Native boy who was much
pleas'd &amp; called them by name Colbey &amp; Bennalon, Colbey we
have frequently heard spoken of by the Boy as a great Warrior &amp;
a leading Man among them; they were taken to the Governors House
where they were soon met by Abooroo, the Native Girl she called
them by name the same as the boy had done &amp; was quite frantic
with Joy; they were assured by these Children that they would be
well treated thereafter allowed to return to their friends, but all
that could be said or done was not sufficient to remove the pang
which they naturally felt at being torn away from their Friends; or
to reconcile them to their situation.</p>

<p>It gave me great satisfaction to find by the Children that
neither of them had Wife or Family who would feel their loss, or to
be distress'd by their being taken away, it was by far the most
unpleasant service I ever was order'd to Execute. These People were
shaved, wash'd &amp; cloathed; an Iron shackle was put on one leg
with a rope made fast to it &amp; a Convict charged with each of
them, they were very sullen &amp; sulky, continued so several days,
yet it did not by any means affect their appetite if we may judge
from the quantity they now eat, which is beyond every thing
incredible (12 lb of fish does but little towards satisfying</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 184]</p>

<p>them for one meal). They made several attempts to get away by
gnawing the Rope in the night, but being unacquainted with the
securities on doors &amp; windows; they might have as well remained
fast, when their keepers awaked they found them groping about the
room to find an opening by which they might escape.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="dec89" id="dec89"></a>December
1789</p>

<p>Tuesday. Decr. 1: The 1st. Lieut. &amp; Master of the Sirius
were sent the examine the NW branch of Botany Bay, on the 5th
returned I found it to be a Creek of about 8 Miles length to the NW
with a winding shoal Channel &amp; end in a drain to a swamp, all
salt water: Saw several Natives in small parties, they would not
come near us; On our return we landed in a bay about 3 Miles to the
No.ward pf Botany Bay, the wind was fresh &amp; a considerable
swell right on the shore, yet we landed smooth at the beach where
there is a fine Run of Water the inner Pts. of this Bay are open
from SEbS to ESE, the water shoaling gradually wt. soft bottom to
the beach the inner points which break the Sea off are about a
Cable or Cable &amp; half across &amp; 5 fathom water Midchannel,
within the outer Pt. Is 7 fm. from which it runs up rather more
than ½ Mile to the NW &amp; is a very good place for a Boat to stop
in going along shore &amp; night coming on, or a contrary tide
coming on.</p>

<p>Wednesday.9th: Lieut. Dawes with a party went to Rose Hill for
the purpose of penetrating to the Wt.ward towards the
Mountains.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 185]</p>

<p>Saturday.12th: Notwithstanding the two Natives had got
themselves loose several times &amp; were prevented from escaping,
Colbey this evening got away by the very same means which had
before been detected, the Man who had charge of him was severely
punish'd for his neglect, &amp; the Man who had charge of Benallon
was now chain by the wrist, the other end being fasten'd to the
shackle on Benallon's leg instead of a rope which was before used:
Benallon was nearly loose when the other was miss'd &amp; in a
minute more would have been after him, he was much alarmed, no
doubt expecting punishment or to be put to death: in the course of
two or three days he became quite composed, &amp; seem reconciled
better to his situation than before; He came on board the Sirius
without the smallest apprehensions for his safety; He looked with
attention at every part of the Ship &amp; expressed much
astonishment particularly at the Cables.</p>

<p>Thursday.17. Mr. Dawes &amp; party return'd found it
impracticable to get near the Mountains in the direction which they
went.</p>

<p>Tuesday.22. The Supply arrived from Norfolk Island: She brought
very favorable accounts of the Crops of Corn; called at Lord Howes
Island, very little success in getting Turtle.</p>

<p>Sunday.27th, Mr.King 2nd Lieut. Of the Sirius being established
by the Governor, Commandant at Norfolk Island was discharged from
the Ship &amp; Mr.Maxwel 3d. Lieut. being Insane was invalided</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 186]</p>

<p>Mr. Newton Fowell &amp; Mr. Henry Waterhouse were appointed to
act as second &amp; third Lieutenants.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jan90" id="jan90"></a>January 1790</p>

<p>January.8th. The Supply sailed for Norfolk Island with Convicts
&amp; Provisions.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 20th. A look out Post was establish'd at the South
Head: Capt. Hunter with a Party went to that station.</p>

<p>Friday.29th. The 1st. Lieut. with a Party went to the South Head
to releive the look out Post. Black Kangoroo seen about there.</p>

<p>Sunday.31st.: Caesar, a notorious Convict a Native of Madagascar
deliver'd himself up to the Officer at Rose Hill, He had been
absent since the 22nd of December when he ran off with a Canoe from
Garden Island &amp; on the 23rd. paid them a visit in the night
&amp; stole a Musquet, which he dropt in a Garden a Rose Hill a few
nights since being closely pursued: The account he fives of his
subsisting himself so long a time was, that where he saw a party of
Natives with any thing on, or about their Fire, that he frighten'd
them away by coming suddenly on them &amp; swaggering with his
Musquet, then help'd himself to whatever they had left; in this
manner he made out very well without ammunition, sometimes robbing
Gardens: When he lost the Musquet he found it impossible to subsist
himself, he was then attack'd by the Natives &amp; wounded in
several places &amp; escaped from a party of them through a very
thick brush when he surrender'd himself.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 187]</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="feb90" id="feb90"></a>February
1790</p>

<p>Wednesday.3rd. The Governor &amp; Benallon visited the Look out
Post Benallon being now well reconciled generally accompanies the
Governor in little excursions: He threw a Spear on the South Head
against a strong wind 98 Yards, which was considerably farther than
I ever noticed before: In their return to Sydney Cove they saw some
Women on a point of land near Rose Bay to which they rowed, throw'd
them a Jacket &amp; several other things, among this party was a
Woman whom</p>

<p>Benallon was very fond of (Barang-ooroo) &amp; with whom he had
much conversation, he wanted her to come to the Boat telling her
that he was fast by the leg &amp; could not get the them, they
learn'd from these Women, that Colbey was then fishing on the other
side of the Hill, that he could not get the shackle from his
leg.</p>

<p>Sunday.7. Nanbaray (the Native Boy) was at the look out Post on
a visit, this day among other amusements he went through the
ceremony of a Burial; which he did by first digging a Grave, put
into it a quantity of dry sticks: the body was laid at length in
green brush which he tied at both ends &amp; placed it upon the dry
sticks, then piled sticks over it above the surface of the ground
&amp; signified that they set fire to the pile &amp; threw ashes
&amp; earth all together leaving the ground in shape of the Grave
usually met with: That part of the ceremony of lighting the fire he
was obliged to omit not being strong enough to get it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 188]</p>

<p>He shew'd us the manner in which it was done by two sticks, one
placed horizontally, the other pointed is applied to this which by
constant friction, makes a small hole through which fire is
communicated to some very dry stuff placed under for that purpose,
it appears to be rather tedious &amp; laborious.</p>

<p>Wednesday.10th A Sail was seen in the Offing which was soon
known to be the Supply: she falling in to leeward of Port Jackson
bore away for Botany Bay.</p>

<p>Friday.12. The Supply arrived at Port Jackson, she left a Party
on Lord Howe Island in her passage to Norfolk Island for the
purpose of getting Turtle, she took the People off in her return,
they did not get any Turtle.</p>

<p>Sunday. 14th: The Sirius was order'd to be got ready for Sea, it
being judged that the state of the Colony with respect to
Provisions was such, as made it necessary that she should be sent
for Supplies to releive it &amp; China was determined as a proper
place for that purpose: Some days after this Plan was chang'd &amp;
it was judged necessary to divide the People in the Settlement;
Norfolk Island was fixed on to remove the Lieut.Governor with his
Part of the Battalion &amp; Convicts; it was therefore order'd that
the Sirius &amp; Supply should take those People to Norfolk Island
&amp; return to Port Jackson after which if there was not a Ship
arrived from England, the Sirius was to go to China as before
resolved on. The Governor &amp; one of the Mates</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 189]</p>

<p>with 6 People took charge of the look out Post.</p>

<p>Tuesday.2. March. Having got the Provisions &amp; Stores on
board for Norfolk Island, we went out of Sydney &amp; Anchored in
the Stream.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 3rd. Rec'd on board the Sirius Major Ross, 4 Lieuts.2
Serj. 2 Corpls. 2 Drums &amp; 20 private Marines: The Supply rec'd
1 Captain 1 Lieut. 2 Serjants, 2 Corporals &amp; 26 private.</p>

<p>Thursday. 4th: Rec'd on board the Sirius 96 Men &amp; 65 Women
Convicts with 23 Children; the Surgeon &amp; Assistant who were
appointed to Norfolk Island. The Supply rec'd 20 Men &amp; 2 Women
Convicts &amp; 3 Childn.</p>

<p>Friday. 5th. Sailed with the Supply in Company, but the weather
being squally &amp; very unsettled we came too in the lowerpart of
the Harbour.</p>

<p>Saturday 6. Wind fresh from the So.ward Sailed out of Pt.
Jackson Supply in Co. the 8th we found by Observation for the
Latitude &amp; Timekeeper that the Current had set us 38 of Latd.
to the No.ward &amp; 49 of longde. to the Et.ward: Weather
Moderate, Wind So.erly.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 9th: At 1 PM. Saw Lord Howe Island, Mt.Gower NEbE 23
leagues, Mt. Gower &amp; Mt. Lidgbird with these bearings make in
two round hills with a space between them &amp; in clear weather
Ball's Pyramid lying to the SE of Mt. Gower may be seen nearly at
as great a distance in a peak; the land which joins the two
Mountains is not to be seen 'till much nearer 15 or 16 leagues
&amp; the low land of the Island not till within 6 or 7 leagues:
found a Current which set us this day 16 No. &amp; 49 of Longitude
Et.. The Supply stood</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 190]</p>

<p>into the Bay to try if any Turtle could be got.</p>

<p>Wednesday, 10th: PM passed through between Balls Pyramid &amp;
Mt. Gower, they bear from each other S51E &amp; N57 W by Compass 5
or 6 leagues distant: To the So.ward of the Pyramid which is a very
high inaccessible peaked Rock are several Rocks which shew above
water, between Lord Howe Island &amp; the Pyramid is a clear
passage, we had soundings near Mt. Gower but none before or after,
we found a very strong Current setting through to the NE.</p>

<p>From good Meridian Observation &amp; good Altitudes for the

<p>Variation of the Compass. 9:30 Et.</p>

<p>After leaving Ld. Howe Island we did not find any Current until
we came near the stream of Norfolk Island, when we again found a
strong Et.erly Current: We made Norfolk Island Saturday 13th at 2
AM Brot too at 4 &amp; made sail in for the Island at daylight, as
we came in with Sydney Bay. (So. side of the Isld.) saw the Signal
that there was no landing; the Supply was sent to see if landing
was good in Balls Bay on the Et. side of the Island; Lt.Ball could
not land but back'd the boat in so as to throw a letter on shore to
the Commandant: We then went round to the No. side of the Island
&amp; found landing practicable at low water in Cascade Bay.</p>

<p>Sunday 14. Landed the Marines &amp; Men Convicts early in the
afternoon &amp; the next morning the Lt. Governor &amp; part of the
Women Convicts in Cascade Bay, by backing the Boat in from which
they jump on a Rock , one at a time keeping the boat on her Oars
&amp; frequently obliged to pull out several times before a boat
load can be landed: the Rock on which you land you cannot pass from
after ½ flood it being seperated from the shore &amp; there being
always a surge upon the shore would be dangerous crossing after ½
flood or till ½ ebb, this Rock being detached &amp; steep too makes
safe landing in So.erly winds, the Rock</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 192]</p>

<p>for landing lies to the Et.ward of the stoney beach some
distance.</p>

<p>Monday, 15th: The wind coming to the Et.ward we had drifted so
far to leeward that it was a considerable time before we could get
the Ship far enough to windward for the boats to reach the landing
place, about Noon we landed the remainder of the Women Convicts
&amp; thought ourselves exceeding fortunate in having made so good
a passage &amp; having had so good an opportunity of landing so
great a number of people, but the most difficult part yet remained,
that of landing the Provisions &amp; Stores for them &amp; which
could only be done in Sydney Bay, where the settlement is made:
While off Cascade Bay we made the landing place by several
Observations in Latitude 29:02½. Longitude 168:02E by
Timekeeper</p>

<p>Tuesday.16th. Coming on a Gale of Wind at East, Bore away &amp;
Run under the lee of the Island; Sent on board the Supply as much
Provisions as she could stow, that no time might be lost in getting
it landed should the Supply have an opportunity of getting into
Sydney Cove before the Sirius which was reasonable to suppose she
would from her superiority in Sailing &amp; working.</p>

<p>Wednesday.17th. It blew very strong from the Et.ward; We were
beating up under a press of Sail, but could not reach Sydney Bay
before the evening, when it was would be too late &amp; too much
wind to send a boat: The Supply at Noon was</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 193]</p>

<p>well in with the Bay.</p>

<p>Thursday.18th. The Gale increased with very heavy squalls, the
Supply got far enough in to send a boat on shore, on the return of
which Mr.Ball, bore away &amp; informed us that landing was
dangerous &amp; as the weather had a very bad appearance, He
recommended standing off as the night came on, which we did under
the reef'd Foresail &amp; Storm Staysails: We lost sight of the
Supply in the night: At Noon we were about 10 leagues to the
leeward of Phillip Island.</p>

<p>Friday. 19th. PM. The Gale moderated, we made what sail the Ship
would bear to endeavour to beat up to Norfolk Island, in the night
the wind coming to the SE enabled us to fetch so far to windward as
to have Norfolk Island on the lee bow at daylight: AM At 9 standing
in far close in with Phillip Island, saw the Supply under Norfolk
Island; the Signal being up on shore for good landing &amp; that
Longboats might land, stood in for Sydney Bay, Out 3d. Reef
Topsails, steer'd close in with the So.point of Nepean Island, wore
&amp; brot too Mail Topsail to the Mast with the Ship's;head to the

couldnot weather the Reef, the wind baffled &amp; baulk'd the Ship

<p>(Anchoring when the Ship miss'd stays would have been
unavoidable destruction, the bottom being full of spiral Rocks, the
lee part of the Bay &amp; the shore inaccessible). The Ship settled
in upon the shore, shoal'd the water to 5 fathom: Put the Ship
stays; when she getting fresh stern way right in upon the shore,
Cut away the small Bower Anchor let go the TopSl. Halliards &amp;c.
but before the Cable could check her she struck violently on the
Reef which lays along parallel to the shore in Sydney Bay &amp;
some distance from it; the Carpenter almost immediately reported
the Ship Bulged &amp; 7 feet water in the Hold.</p>

<p class="caption">'Part of the Reef in Sydney Bay, Norfolk Island,
on which the Sirius was wreck'd. 19 March 1790.'</p>

<p>the QrMaster then attending in the Main Hold called up that the
Water was flowing in fast; Cut away all the Masts, The Ship by the
heavy surf which broke over her was thrown well in upon the Reef;
It being impossible to hold an Idea of getting her off again, every
body was employ'd getting Provisions as it could be got at, on the
Gun deck &amp; securing it there; Lt.Ball came as near the Ship in
his boat as he could to ask if the Supply could be of any use;
Capt.Hunter told him No! that the Sirius was gone &amp; desired him
to take care of the Supply; the Surf increasing in the evening
&amp; the weather having a bad appearance, Mr. King, who had now
been more than 2 years on the Island signified to us, that it would
be dangerous to remain in the Ship all night.</p>

<p>We got a Hawser from the Ships Qr. To the shore by means of a
Cask floating a small rope through the Surf, which the People on
shore got hold of &amp; hauled the end of the Hawser on shore, we
got a heart on it for as traveller &amp; fixed hauling lines, by
which the People belonging the Island hauled a part of the Ships
Company ashore though the Surf to the Reef, from which they crossed
to the shore in a small boat employ'd inside the Reef for that
purpose, the Reef being cover'd at ½ flood &amp; night coming on,
more than half of the Ships Company were left on board; As the tide
flowed the Cable</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 196]</p>

<p>Check'd her so much that at high water her situation was alter'd
3 or 4 points more in &amp; out, she struck violently at high water
time, but at low water lay quiet AM. At daylight began to get more
of the People on shore the surf still very high &amp; the tide rose
too much for those on the Reef to work before all the People could
be removed from the Ship.</p>

<p>Sunday.21st: PM. At 3 all the People were got on shore in which
we were so fortunate as not to lose a life; several were so near
drown'd as to be quite senseless for a time. Altho' we had all
escap'd from Shipwreck with our lives, yet our situation with
respect to Provisions was alarming &amp; very precarious, it being
doubtful whether any could be saved or not. In the Morning Lt.Ball
came over from Cascade Bay, He informed us that both Friday &amp;
Saturday the Tide set to the Wt.ward the whole of each day except
about 2 hours, a circumstance he had never met with before at this
Island; On the contrary we had always been given to understand that
the Ebb set to the Et.ward &amp; run 9 hours &amp; that the flood
was only a drain to the Wtward &amp; run about 3 hours; To this
unaccountable change in the Current usually found we attribute the
first cause of the Ship being lost, for it was more than 2 hours
Ebb or Eastern tide when we brot too</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 197]</p>

<p>with the Ships head SSW., in full assurance that we had a strong
weathertide we stood nearer in than we should otherwise have done
before we brought too, One boat was loaded &amp; sent away before
we observed her settle in upon the Shore.</p>

<p>Monday. 22nd: We got over from Cascade Bay 3 Tieaces of Pork
&amp; 8 Barrels of Flour which was all the Provisions the Supply
could spare us, &amp; even this in our situation was an object; We
had now landed near 400 people &amp; scarce any of the Provisions,
when the unfortunate accident happen'd. The Timekeeper was saved
&amp; sent aboard the Supply. AM. Martial Law was proclaimed &amp;
half allowance of Provision order'd.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 23rd. The Master &amp; Mates with a gang of hands got
on board to get ready for sending Provisions on shore the Supply
came off Sydney Bay but the surf was to high to send the People who
were to embark in her; she bore away &amp; run to leeward to
Cascade Bay.</p>

<p>Wednesday.24th. PM. Made an unsuccessful attempt to get a Cask
of Provisions on shore:</p>

<p>AM. Sent over to Cascade Bay where they embarked on board the
Supply for Port Jackson the 2nd &amp; 3rd Lieuts. 4 Midshipmen, a
Surgeons Mate, 23 Seamen &amp; 2 Marines: Mr.King the late
Commandant on this Island also went on board the Supply to proceed
to Port Jackson; this forenoon we were fortunate enough</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 198]</p>

<p>to get 18 Cask of Provisions on shore.</p>

<p>Thursday.25th: PM. The Supply sailed for Port Jackson, this
&amp; the following days till the 28th. we had good enough in
getting Provisions from the Ship &amp; several other articles of
consequence.</p>

<p>Sunday.28th AM. Very heavy Surf, the small bower Cable parted;
the Surf hove the Ship further in upon the Reef &amp; not having
any thing to keep her bow steady, she complained very much, The
Master who was on board expected that she would part at High water:
It was the next lowwater time before those on board could venture
to come on shore which they with great difficulty did without the
loss of any.</p>

<p>Monday.29th. Surf very high: At high water the Surf hove the
Ship's Head round in upon the Reef &amp; further in upon it bodily;
this made it necessary to get a Hawser with a Traveller to the bow
of the Ship &amp; to cut the Bridle Port so as to allow of Cask
&amp; large articles of Stores going out.</p>

<p>Which was done the 30th the Surf being more Moderate.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="apr90" id="apr90"></a>April 1790</p>

<p>From which day to the 14th of April we were employed from ½ Ebb
to ½ Flood getting on shore every article of stores belonging to
the ship and the Colony that could be got at, 16 Half Barrels of
powder were also got on shore, the remainder being spoiled was
started into the Sea in the Magazine. The situation of the Ship,
being bulged</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 199]</p>

<p>fore &amp; aft, many of the beams fallen &amp; the lower deck
given way, the Sheet &amp; Bt.Br. Cable were left on board &amp;
many other Stores, it being impossible to remove them without
cutting so much through the deck &amp; beams as to render the
attempt dangerous: With the quantity of Provisions which we had
been so fortunate as to save, there appear'd on a Survey to be in
the Settlement 14 Weeks at ½ allowance.</p>

<p>Parties were allowed to go for Birds, for the Seamen, Marines
&amp; Convicts twice a week each &amp; limited not to bring more
than a Proportion of 3 for each Man: These Birds are very numerous
&amp; burrow in the ground about the Hills particularly about Mount
Pitt which is the highest land in the Island; It was the practice
before we came to dig them out of their holes in the day time, but
the People now take them as they settle in the evening &amp; early
part of the night &amp; were they not restricted they could bring
away almost any number:</p>

<p>These Birds are nearly the same as the English Puffin or Manks
Puffin as described in Brooks's Natural History found on the Isle
of Man &amp; Scilly Isles: &amp; is the size of a tame Pigeon; The
colour on the upper parts is brown or black, &amp; on the under
brown &amp; white legs black. The bill is narrow &amp; black, about
an inch &amp; half in length, the upper chap is crooked at the
point like that of a Cormorant &amp; at the base there is a bald
skin in which</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 200]</p>

<p>the nostrils are placed. The wings are long &amp; the tail is a
palm in length, It feeds at Sea &amp; although such incredible
number settle on the Hills to get into their Holes at the approach
of night, a great number has been taken in the daytime by being dug
out with a grubbing hoe or brought our by terrier dogs, they lay
but one Egg which is larger than that of the Common Hens, they are
said to be in &amp; about this Island from March to August</p>

<p>when the young are ready to fly they all go off together; about
which time another sort is said to come, but not in such numbers;
these Birds are a great resource to us, they enable us to go with
the Cultivation of the land for the Crops which we must soon depend
on if we are not releived, &amp; which I fear will not keep us
without feeling pangs of extreme hunger.</p>

<p>Fish (with which to Sea abounds) is too precarious to be
consider'd as any resource on account of the Surf; It being
impossible to keep a Boat for that purpose at any other part of the
Island except at Sydney Bay in which is a Reef from the Et.point to
the bight on the W. side which is dry at ½ tide but no landing on
it with a boat, there are two small Gullies in the Reef close to
each other that will just admit a Boat (in one of which there is
not breadth for a common 6 Oar'd Cutters Pass) &amp; that only when
there is but very little Surf on the Reef, it is frequently many
days together that the boats cannot go out &amp; is unless very</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 201]</p>

<p>smooth always dangerous; I shall collect into a separate Table,
from the general one of Weather &amp;c. an account of the Surf from
the time of our being wreck'd to the time of our happy deliverance
whenever it comes; &amp; bring it in Course with leaving the
Island, distinguishing the days on which the Boat could go out for
Fish (&amp; no opportunity is lost), &amp; those of High Surf to
prevent it.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 20th.. Half a pound weight of Salt Provisions were
order'd to be deducted from the weeks allowance &amp; parties
allowed to get Birds every day to make up the deficiency.</p>

<p>Thursday.22nd: Went out in the Cutter to sound round Nepean
Island, between it &amp; the Et. point of Sydney Bay found a Rock
about Midchannel or rather nearer the Island wt. only 2 ½ âm. on it
at low water &amp; another not so much as 1/3 over from the Et.
point of Sydney Bay wt. 3 ½ fm. on it both which was were seen to
break some days before, between these Rocks is 9 fm. the 5 &amp; 9
again , It appears to be all foul &amp; very uneven bottom from
more than Mid Channel around to the NE part of the land forming the
Et. point of Sydney Bay; The passage through if a Ship should be
obliged to it, is to keep the Island close on board, but I do not
by any means recommend it as a safe passage: There is a very
dangerous Reef off the SE part of Nepean Island, which lies nearly
SE from it about ½ mile to the outer Rock;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 202]</p>

<p>on which the sea only breaks in bad weather or great Swell. We
passed between this &amp; a rock dry at low water &amp; had 8 fm.
crossing the ledge &amp; 12 on each side about ¼ of a Mile from the
Island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="may90" id="may90"></a>May 1790</p>

<p>Sunday. May 2nd: The Birds taken at Mount Pitt being found very
sufficient to Supply every person, orders were given not to shoot
any Birds on the Island during the continuance of the Mount Pitt
Birds.</p>

<p>Friday.14th: A Council was held by the Lt.Governor &amp; all the
Commission'd Officers, to take into consideration the present
reduced state of the Provision Store &amp; to consult upon what
measures were most proper to be pursued in Order to preserve Life
until such time as we might be releived by some supplies arriving;
&amp; bring the Season round that we may expect some releif from
the Crops which the ground already clear'd &amp; clearing may
produce; all which having been duly consider'd, the Ration of
Provisions was reduced to the following quantity 3Lb of Flour, 1
½Lb of salt Beef or 17 Oz. of Pork &amp; 1Lb of Rice or Calavances
pr week to each Man and Woman: To Children more than 1 year old
half the aforementioned Ration &amp; to Children under 1 year 1 ½
lb of Flour &amp; 1 lb of Rice pr week; At which allowance there
remain in Store 17 Weeks Flour, 16 Beef &amp; Pork together &amp;
21 of Rice &amp; Calavances together: The Parties for Birds were
now</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 203]</p>

<p>increased &amp; allowed to bring in as many as they thought
proper there not yet appearing to be the smallest decrease in the
numbers.</p>

<p>Saturday 22nd. A Practice being made known which several of the
People going for Birds had, of destroying them for the sake of the
Egg after they had taken as many birds as they as they wanted to
carry away &amp; leave the Birds laying about so as to become a
nuisance round the hills, the Parties were not allowed to go out
till 3 in the afternoon &amp; to return by 10 at night, these Birds
were now so plenty that the People could get as many as they wanted
&amp; the practice which of destroying &amp; throwing away the Bird
having been put a stop to, they seldom brought in any but those
with the Egg in them, letting the other go again after taking them;
Our People generally return about 8 O'clock loaded, they have
between 3 &amp; 4 Miles to go for them to Mount Pitt &amp; the
hills about it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jun90" id="jun90"></a>June 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday. June 1st: Went out to sound between Nepean Island &amp;
the East point of Sydney Bay about those Rocks which I was on with
the boat the 22nd. of last month, found a flat with 5fm. round the
rock nearest the Island &amp; discover'd the bottom to be full of
spiral rocks or large stones laying on a flat Coral bed, these
Rocks lie just at the edge of a Bed of Rocks which appear to spread
nearly over to Nepean Island the sounding very irregular, on the
rock next to Pt. Hunter 3 ½ &amp; on that</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 204]</p>

<p>nearest Nepean Island only 2 ½ fm.. I crossed the Channel &amp;
found the bottom very uneven &amp; all Rocky, &amp; although I had
not less then 5 fathom except on those rocks beforemention'd I
think it probable that in many parts there may be much less from
the rippling of the tide &amp; from the breakers which we see in
bad weather; I also went along by the Island to try for a passage,
the sounds within ½ a Cables length of it are more regular than any
other part of the Channel 7 &amp; 6 fm. but the tide making very
strong prevented my being able to determine whether there was a
safe passage through or not, The Supply has gone through but I
think it rather dangerous, the rocks which are known are so small
that many of the same kind may have as yet been passed over without
being noticed.</p>

<p>Wednesday.2nd; A large patch of level ground about 2 Miles to
the Westward, which was said could easily be clear'd was fix'd on
as an elligible situation to detach some people to for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Friday.4th: At Noon, the Detachment of Marines fired 3 vollies
in honour of the Day.</p>

<p>Tuesday.15. The Fishing Boat was suddenly overtaken by a Gale of
Wind, that she could not reach the landing place in Sydney Bay or
land if she could have got to windward which obliged them to run
under the lee of the Island.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 205]</p>

<p>Our People were sent over &amp; had the good luck to save the
Boat by hauling her up in Balls Bay on the Et. end of the
Island.</p>

<p>Thursday.17. A Captain &amp; Company of Marines &amp; a party of
Convicts were detach'd to the ground lately discover'd, for the
purpose of cleaning it for Cultivation: It was named Charlotte
Feild.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 23. The Coble was launched from Balls Bay &amp;
brought round, this was the first day that it was practicable on
account of the Surf since the day that she was obliged to run to
leeward of the Island.</p>

<p>Thursday 24th: Got some empty Casks from the Ship, she was found
to be bulged the whole way fore &amp; aft on both sides &amp; the
keel broke right up into the after hold</p>

<p>Tuesday.29th: The Fishing business was given into charge of the
Officers &amp; People belonging to the Sirius, that the two Crews
of Convicts kept for the Coble might be turn'd to cleaning ground;
We also made hooks &amp; lines for carrying it on with. The Birds
at Mount Pitt are yet taken in the usual quantities without
appearing to have diminished in their numbers, which has already
far surpass'd every thing we can have an Idea of, but the Divine
Hand of Providence; Fish we have been very badly off for this Month
being mostly high Surf.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 206]</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jul90" id="jul90"></a>July 1790</p>

<p>Monday.19th. The reduced state of the Provisions Store made it
absolutely necessary that the issuing Salt Provisions however small
the Ration should be stopt while any Birds were to be had.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="aug90" id="aug90"></a>August 1790</p>

<p>August 3. The Lieut.Governor assembled the Council for the
purpose of determining on the best plan in our distress'd situation
to secure to ourselves the means of subsistence until we may be
releived by the arrival of some Ship, the Birds now became scarce
&amp; the young being nearly ready to fly are about to leave the
Island: a Reduction of Provisions to 2lb of Flour &amp; 1 pint of
Rice pr Week was judged necessary to take place on Saturday the 7th
following; It having been as Practice for some people to abscond
from their Work &amp; take to the woods living by plunder &amp; the
section of the Articles of War relating to Martial Law being
established not being affecting the lives of such People without
their having robb'd or plunder'd being fully proved, it became
absolutely necessary from the situation we were reduced to, that a
Law should be established deeming such as quitted their Work &amp;
were absent one week to be Out Lawed &amp; to be put to Death if
met with, or if brought in to be punished with Death on a proof of
their having been absent one week.</p>

<p>The 4th: The appearance of a Ship to the Et.ward &amp;
working</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 207]</p>

<p>up towards the Island, filled every Soul with a most Heart felt
Pleasure &amp; extravagant Joy, some crying some laughing, Running
about like People without Reason, Parties were sent to Balls Bay
&amp; Cascade Bay not doubting but b a boat would land there, but
after standing close in with Cascade Bay about 4 O'Clock in the
afternoon She bore away &amp; made sail to the No.ward, the Gloom
with which the Island was now overspread our feelings on this
disappointment cannot be expressed by words, such a sudden change
almost threw every body into a state of despondency, the only Idea
that could be suggested to rouse &amp; give us hopes was that there
were Ships at Port Jackson &amp; that this Ship might have been
order'd to shew herself off the Island, but the Commander of her
not having any intercourse with us when he could so easily have
done it &amp; without loss of time is I think unpardonable &amp;
not worthy the character of a Man but rather that of a Brute: This
disappointment had a very bad effect on the Working People who now
consider'd themselves as without a hope of releif &amp; the Birds
being scarce impressed the Idea of distress more fully on their
mind: The Idea of there having been arrivals at Port Jackson was
encouraged by all the Officers, yet it had but little effect on the
lower class.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 208]</p>

<p>Saturday.7th. At daylight a sail being seen to the Southward
again fill'd us with a sudden joy &amp; hopes of being speedily
releived from the gloomy prospects now before us, this was the day
appointed for reading the Proclamation beforementioned respecting a
new Law &amp; &amp; further reductions of Provisions, but it was
deferr'd, a Ship being in sight although at too great a distance
for a Boat to reach her:</p>

<p>Sunday.8th. At 3PM A Boat was sent out to the Ship in the Offing
the Boat was scarce without the Reef when they saw another Ship
coming close round the Island &amp; to which they went found her to
be the Surprise Transport form Port Jackson with Convicts &amp;
Provisions for this Island, that the Ship in the Offing was the
Justinian also with Provisions &amp; that the Ship that passed was
the Lady Juliana which Ship had been clear'd at Port Jackson &amp;
dispatched on her Voyage to China; The Justinian &amp; Surprise
being also charter'd for China, we are yet without an opportunity
of being removed form Norfolk Island: Besides these Ships, the
Neptune &amp; Scarborough had arrived at Port Jackson &amp; altho'
all these arrivals were in the beginning of June and in the course
of the same month it was not judged necessary to send releif to the
unfortunate on Norfolk Island 'till the 27th July &amp; 1st August
on which days the Justinian &amp; Surprise left Port Jackson, The
reason for their having been so long detained seems</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 209]</p>

<p>only to be known to our very Humane Governor , who no doubt must
have felt much for the distress'd situation of the five hundred
Inhabitants on Norfolk Island: If we even allow him to possess only
those feeling which a reasonable being would have for a fellow
creature, it is unaccountable what could have kept him from
releiving us sooner. These Transports besides Provisions, Stores
&amp; Convicts brought out part of the Forest Rangers an independt.
Corps raised for the Protection of the Colony in New South
Wales:</p>

<p>We are informed that the Gorgon was very soon expected at Port
Jackson with the new Lieut.Governor &amp; the remainder of the
Forest Rangers; Provisions Stores &amp;c. The Marines are to be
releiv'd by this Corps &amp; we are informed by the Governor that
the Officers &amp; Company of the Sirius are also to return to
England in the Gorgon. The Guardian a new 44 Gun Ship, Commanded by
Lieut.Riou which sailed from England in Sepr. 89, with Provisions
&amp; Stores &amp; very amply supplied with every necessary for the
Settlement, had taken a great quantity of Cattle &amp; other
articles on board at the Cape of Good Hope &amp; proceeding on her
voyage, in Latd. 44° So. &amp; Longde. 44° Et. unfortunately run
upon a peice of drift Ice from an Ice Island which she struck on
her bow, the Ice overset &amp; as she passed struck her abaft
carrying away the Rudder &amp; part of the stern post, In this
situation, which</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 210]</p>

<p>was thought impossible for her to keep above water long, she was
deserted by part of the Officers &amp; Crew who having permission
took to the Boats, The Long boat in which was the Master, was taken
up by a French Ship; which Ship the Justinian spoke with, the
account they gave of the Guardian was that she had founder'd; This
circumstance induced the Master of the Justinian to push for New
South Wales with touching at the Cape of Good Hope supposing the
Colony was much distress'd,</p>

<p>By Letters recd. from Lieut.Riou we find that the Guardian was
brought into the Cape &amp; after laying some time was hauled on
shore in Table Bay; We also hear that the Supply sailed from Port
Jackson the 17th of April for Batavia, at which place a Ship was to
be hired to take in Provisions for the releif of the Settlement,
that she was order'd to call at Norfolk Island but not to lose more
than 5 days in doing it; We conclude that the strong Easterly Winds
which at that time prevailed, prevented Lieut.Ball from making the
Island.</p>

<p>The Governor has by these Ships order'd Spars for Masts to be
got ready against the arrival of the Gorgon, which are intended to
be taken in her to England for trial at the Kings Dock Yards. The
1st Lieut. of the Sirius was sent on board on of these Ships &amp;
a Mid. On board the other to assist them with the knowledge our own
misfortunes had given us of the place: The 17th. A Cutter belonging
to the Sirius with Provisions &amp; Convicts in was thrown</p>

Surprise standing into Sydney Bay. 23 August 1790'</p>

<p>upon the Reef by a sudden Surf, the Boat instantly went to
peices, 2 Seamen, 1 Convict Man, 3 Women &amp; 1 Child were
drown'd; Clearing these Ships was render'd very tedious by the Surf
until the 22nd. When the weather settled Modt. &amp; but little
Surf on the 27th they were both clear'd, the same day Martial Law
was discontinued, the cause for which it was judged necessary being
done away by the Supply of Provisions landed from the two Ships,
whole allowance was now issued</p>

<p>Monday. 30th. P.M. The Surprise sailed for China &amp; at 11 AM
the Justinian. The Island being now releiv'd &amp; at full
allowance of Provisions, every Publick work went on in the usual
way according to the directions given by Major Ross who had a
detached Party about 2 Miles to the Wt.ward of Sydney Bay building
Huts &amp;c. for the reception of People who were to be sent there
to Cultivate that part of the Island. A Person who had been sent
for the purpose of Manufacturing the Flax was settled at Cascade
Bay at which part of the Island there was little else done altho'
by far the most elligible part for settling The Hills surrounding
the Valley first Cultivated by Mr. King employed the other
labouring People.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="feb91" id="feb91"></a>February
1791</p>

<p>February.6th. 1791. At daylight a Sail was discover'd to the SW
which proved to be the Supply from Port Jackson</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 212]</p>

<p>at which place she had been 3 months before Governor Phillip
thought proper to send her for that information so necessary for
him, it was now 11 months since our misfortunes had brought us to a
miserable &amp; uncertain state &amp; altho' there were Ships that
could have returned after releiving the Island in August</p>

<p>last, time enough to have saved the Season to China, it was not
thought necessary to remove the Sirius's Ships Company, or to have
any return from the Island altho' the last accounts of us were that
not a Cask of Provision was at that time saved from the wreck but
that some had been lost in making the attempt.</p>

<p>The Supply made a tolerable passage to Batavia, discover'd a
shoal off the Coast of New South Wales No. end of it in Latitude
21°:24'So. Longitude 159°:24'Et.&amp; passed to the No.ward of it;
They made the East part of that Land named by Mr Shortland New
Georgia &amp; pass'd along the East Coast of it till Squally
Weather obliged them to leave it steer to the No.ward; They arrived
at Batavia the of July soon after which Mr. King sailed in a Dutch
Packet with dispatches for England. Lieut. Ball took on board as
much Provisions as the Supply could store &amp; hired a Dutch Snow
which was also loaded &amp; sailed soon after the Supply from
Batavia, She arrived safe, was clear'd &amp; ready to sail when the
Supply left Port Jackson: The Season while the Supply was at
Batavia</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 213]</p>

<p>was very unhealthy, several of her People died there; &amp; Lt.
Fowell who was sent to conduct the third Vessel to Port Jackson
died on board the Supply soon after she sailed, He having been
taken on board her as the only chance of saving his life when the
Fever attack'd him, One of the Midshipmen was left in his stead;
The whole of the Crew belonging to the Dutch Vessel also died &amp;
left only the Commander who had to get Hands to man his Vessel a
second time. They brought some account of a War between Great
Britain &amp; Spain but by no means circumstantial or, from good
Authority.</p>

<p>Saturday.12th: PM. Captain Hunter with the Officers &amp; Crew
of the Sirius embarked on board the Supply &amp; sail'd immediately
for Port Jackson, where we arrived the 26th</p>

<p>Directions &amp;c. for Ships going to Norfolk Island. Norfolk
Island is situated in 29°:03' So.Latd. &amp; 168°:02' Et.Longde. is
5 miles in Length Et. &amp; Wt. &amp; about 3 No. &amp; So.. Three
miles to the So.ward of Norfolk Island is Phillip Isd, about a Mile
&amp; ¼ in length &amp; ½ Mile in breadth, there is a high
Sugarloaf Peak runs up from the So. side of it which may be seen as
far as the highest part of Norfolk Island, between there is a
smaller Island called Nepean Island about ½ mile from the Et. point
of Sydney Bay, which is situated on the So. side of Norfolk Island
&amp; where the Settlement was made in March 1788; This Bay is
shelter'd somewhat by Nepean &amp; Phillip Islands from the Et.
&amp;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 214]</p>

<p>SE winds, but the ground is very bad for Anchoring, that which
is clear of Rocks being loose sand &amp; Coral that a Ship would
find it difficult to Ride in a fresh breeze of Wind; There is a
Reef of Clay &amp; Coral extends along the Bay which dries from ½
ebb to ½ flood, the outer part more than half a Cable's length from
the shore, through this Reef just to the Wt.ward of the Flagstaff
are is the channel leading to the landing places which is nothing
but a Gully through between the end of this Reef which dries all
the way from the Et point of Sydney the Bay &amp; Rocks just below
the surface to the westward of it, round this point of the Reef one
passage runs in through the Coral Reef in an angle to the Flagstaff
&amp; is the safest channel being shelter'd by the Pt. of the Reef
when round it &amp; those stones which had hitherto render'd it
dangerous for Boats at low water being removed;</p>

<p>The other channel is straight in from the end of the Reef,
through broken parts of the Coral Reef to the Wt.ward of the
Flagstaff &amp; in the narrowest part is not room for a 6 sand
Cutters Oars, which together with its being exposed to a second
Surf after having passed the end of the Reef makes it very
dangerous &amp; it was much more so before a middle Rock (which
Boats could not pass over at low water) was removed by the Sirius's
People at the same time they clear'd the other Channel; There is
always an Outset in both Passages &amp; sometimes so strong that I
have seen a Boat with 6 Oars several minutes without being able to
get ahead, It is generally strongest just as the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 215]</p>

<p>Reef begins to be cover'd, or when the Surf is high &amp; beats
over the Et.ern part of it, there being a large space of water
between the Flagstaff &amp; that ) Et. pt. within the Reef, which
forces itself at these times over that part of the Reef that dries
to the Flagstaff &amp; forms a passage to the landing place through
which it runs out like a sluice; From the knowledge have of this
circumstance, I think it but common Justice to the memory of Mr.
Cunningham who was drowned in this passage to declare that the
reflection cast on him in a Book publish'd by Stockdale &amp; said
to be compiled from papers furnished by the Publick Boards is not
only unjust, but that he lost his life using his utmost endeavours
to obey the Orders of Mr. King the Commandant which were an
impossibility to effect, instead of not attending to them as is so
shamefully &amp; falsely represented in that Publication.</p>

<p>There is no danger in approaching Norfolk Island or those
adjacent from the Sea there not being anything laying more than ½ a
Mile from the Shore; Ships coming to this Island with, West, SW or
So.ly winds scarce ever meet with an opportunity of landing in
Sydney Bay on their arrival: It would be much better for a Ship to
wait a smooth time (which frequently happens for several days
together) than to risk a Boat when the Surf is high at times altho'
smooth at intervals. In general there is landing in Sydney Bay with
the wind from the SE round to the No.ward to West.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 216]</p>

<p>but when to the So.ward of West or SE very seldom. Sometimes the
Surf rises without any apparent cause, I have seen a very heavy
Surf when the wind has been two days off the land after its rising.
When there is no landing in Sydney Bay there is generally smooth
water in Cascade Bay about a Mile round the NE end of the Island,
the landing is on a black rock standing out from but joining the
shore &amp; steep too, a little to the Et.ward of a kind of stoney
beach composed of very large stones, to this Rock the Boats back
in, Here People &amp; small packages may be landed, &amp; I think
the landing of Provisions very practicable by fixing a Derrick in
the Black Rock which is of sufficient Base &amp; making a Rowling
way from it to the Valley at the Beach where the Flax Manufactory
is carrying on &amp; where a store could be built to receive it
till it could be convey'd over to the General Store:</p>

<p>If this was done a Ship would never long be detained as she
could be clearing on one side of the Island or the other. Sydney
&amp; Cascade Bays are the only places where Provisions or Stores
can be landed, but People may at times be landed in Balls Bay which
is to the So.ward of the NE Pt. of the Island, at Duncombe Bay,
which is between Cascade Bay &amp; the NW point of the Island &amp;
at Ansons Bay which is situated round a Point about a mile to the
So.ward of the NW Point, from either of these it would be
impossible to remove Stores or Provisions</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 217]</p>

<p>on account of the Perpendicular Hills that surround them. The
ground off the N.side of the Island is much clearer of Rocks than
off the So.side, A Ship may lay safely &amp; smooth with SW or
So.ly winds off Cascade or Duncombe Bay &amp; by anchoring prevent
being driven away to the Et.ward: There is also good Anchoring
Ground to the NE of Nepean Island, the Flagstaff on with Pt. Hunter
in 14 fms. Mud &amp; sand &amp; is the only muddy bottom I know
about the Island. There is a Reef off the West Point of Sydney Bay
running, SEbS from near ½ a mile from the shore to the outer sunken
Rocks, which being just below the Surface at low water it always
breaks, unless the Sea is uncommonly smooth; The Tides in general
are equal each way, Flood runs to the SWbS &amp; Ebb to the NEbS
Ebbs &amp; flows very regular by the shore &amp; is high water Full
&amp; change ¼ before 8 O'Clock, The Tide makes two Hours sooner on
the Norfolk Island shore than in the Stream or over by Phillip
Island;</p>

<p>We have experienced that the Tides are subject to unaccountable
turns, sometimes running the greatest part of the day to the SW
&amp; sometimes the contrary, altho' this but very seldom happens
it makes it necessary for the safety of a Ship that she should
bring too &amp; lay the Tide before she comes into the Bay within a
line drawn from the outer Rocks of the Reef off the Wt. point to
the So. part of Nepean Island 7 fm. is full near enough to come
to</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 218]</p>

<p>the back of the reef in the most favourable time; The SE &amp;
So,ly winds are baffling, frequently shifting several points
particularly when close over to Norfolk Island, which should be
attended to, for if a Ship cannot lay up SSW the Et.ern Tide will
throw heave her in upon the Shore: The West side of the Bay is full
of Rocks &amp; not safe for a Ship to go farther over than to bring
the two Flag Staffs in one.</p>

<p>There is a bed of Rocks to the Wt.ward of the little Bay in
Nepean Island &amp; more than a Cables length from it, on some
parts of which there is not more than 3 ¼ fathoms at low water,
this lies much in the way coming into the Bay from the Et.ward
&amp; makes it dangerous for a Ship to go within the Island unless
the wind is steady &amp; off the shore, or a strong weather tide,
as there is not any safe passage between Nepean Island &amp; the
Et. point of Sydney Bay the whole being a bed of Rocks on several
of which is only 3 &amp; on two of them only 2 fathom at low water
&amp; probably many more not yet discover'd; I have crossed this
Channel several times &amp; kept sight of the bottom all across, by
which alone I was enabled to find the top of those Rocks, which are
so small that they might be pass'd over unnoticed in a Boat rowing
across &amp; keeping the lead going in the usual way, the middle is
all a Rocky flat of 5 fathom with Rocks or Stones rising from &amp;
laying upon it; Within less than ½ a Cable of the Island Is the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 219]</p>

<p>part I would recommend if a Ship should be under a necessity of
attempting it; The Supply has been through, but that was before any
dangers were discover'd in it, she was fortunate enough to pass
clear of all. Going through between Phillip &amp; Nepean Islands,
take care of a reef which runs off to the Et.wd. of the So. end of
Nepean Id. about a ¼ of a mile to the outer sunken Rock between
which &amp; the outer part of the reef that dries at low water is a
passage wt. 8 &amp; 10 fathom through which a Ship may go, but
unless press'd I would recommend going round it, which you do by
keeping the Wt.ern extreme of Norfolk Id. open to the So.ward of
Nepean Id. until you open the Points of Balls Bay, when you may
haul round to the NEt.</p>

<p>The marks for this outer sunken Rock is the two points of Balls
Bay on &amp; the Bluff on the SE part of Nepean Id. sight on wt.
the dry Reef, It breaks in bad weather &amp; has 10 fathom close
round it. There are several ragged Rocks running out from that part
o! f Phillip Island opposite to Sydney Bay, one of which is but
just above the Surface &amp; lies farther from the Island than the
others they are steep too &amp; deep water round them: SSE ½ Mile
from the Wt. end of Phillip Island is a little rock above water,
from which all round the So. side of the Island appears to be foul
ground. There are sunken Rocks off the NE Pt. of Norfolk Island
which do not always break, they lay NE from it about ¼ of a Mile
&amp;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 220]</p>

<p>20 fm. just without it, It is necessary to give it a good birth
in hauling round for Cascade Bay; There is sounding 30 &amp; 40
fathoms some Miles round Norfolk Island. In Sydney Bay, The flood
runs SWbS. Ebb. NEbN On the Et. &amp; Wt. ends...So.ward. Ebb to
the No.ward as the Land lies &amp; on the No. side nearly West
&amp; East, The Flood sets strong over the NE end of Phillip Island
&amp; along by the shore as the Land lies, the Ebb the same over
the Wt. end:</p>

<p>Between the Islands the Tides are very strong; It flows¼ before
at full &amp; change rises 6 or 7 feet &amp; makes 2 Hours sooner
on the Norfolk Island shore than in the Stream or by Phillip
Island.</p>

<p>A Ship may water in Sydney Bay very well wt. small Casks
particularly if the Island Boats are used for that purpose.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island is a very healthy situation as will appear from
there having being been only 3 natural deaths since it was first
settled in March. 1788 (The Casual deaths are 2 killed by Trees
falling on them &amp; 14 drown'd) at which time a small party was
sent under the Command of Lieut. King of the Sirius, since which
time the number of Inhabitants have been continually increasing by
draughts from Port Jackson &amp; in March. 1790 the Lieut. Governor
with 2 Companies of Marines &amp; 200 Convicts were sent there,
&amp; Lieut. King removed: After the Sirius was wreck'd the number
of People on the Island was 507 &amp; in August following 200 more
were sent from Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 221]</p>

<p>The soil is in most parts good &amp; by those who are Judges
from having been long used to Farming, said to be capable of
producing anything, the Ground has been much infested with the
Caterpillars which runs over it clearing all before them, &amp;
particularly this last Season, when the Crops were scarce Seed Corn
for the Ground.</p>

<p>The Pines which are in size equal to any in the World, are said
to be by the Carpenters of very bad quality, not having any
Terpentine in the Tree will never be fit for Masts; What little
terpentine they have is between the bark &amp; the tree, the body
of the Tree has a moisture like water all through it, which makes
it very heavy &amp; when that water is drained from it, they think
the wood of no substance: However we have cut down &amp; left there
a Top Mast &amp; Topsailyard for a 74 Gun Ship a 32 Gun Frigate
&amp; a Sloop of War, &amp; a rough spar ready to be taken to
England for trial as order'd: In getting those 7 spars, 34 Trees
were cut down, 27 of which proved defective: It makes good plank
for Flooring &amp;c..</p>

<p>There is several other kinds of wood on the Island, a Great
variety of the Fern Tree &amp; great quantities of the Palm
Cabbage.</p>

<p>The Birds which so providentially afforded us subsistence form
March until August, when releif arrived from Port Jackson cannot
again be expected for some years, from the vast number of Eggs
&amp; young Birds that were destroyed &amp; the ground</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 222]</p>

<p>in which they burrowed being torn up; But for a small number of
Inhabitants the Birds may always a resource in case of accident
happening to a Ship with Supplies or other failure.</p>

<p>I do not think that Fish can ever be consider'd as a resource to
trust to, from the danger &amp; difficulty of getting them &amp;
the scarcity of them in the Winter Season, during August, Sepr.</p>

<p>October &amp; till the latter end of November, we did not get
Fish, the Boat returning several times without one &amp; whilst the
Justinian &amp; the Surprise were about the Island from the 4th to
the 30th of August there was not a fish caught on board either of
them altho' they tried on every side of the Island. They are very
plenty in the Summer Season mostly of the Snapper kind, many sharks
are met with &amp; during the Months of July &amp; August several
Whales were about &amp; between the Islands. The No. of People on
Norfolk Island after we re embarked were, as follows;</p>

<pre>

Officers, Marines &amp; Free People  93
Men Convicts...........             227
Women Convicts...........           245
Children of Do...........            62

Total                               627

</pre>
The Ground cleared at Norfolk Island when we left of it was 130
Acres from the best accounts I could get, including Gardens,
Private &amp; Public; Tobacco thrives very well as does the
Plaintain &amp; Sugar Cane, the Vines were just

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 223]</p>

<p>beginning to bear this Season; The Ground is certainly capable
of producing every thing usually found in the same Climate &amp;
altho' the Crop of Corn belonging to the Public failed the last
Season, there were some remarkable fine Crops on the ground
belonging to some of the Officers who had followed the same Plan
&amp; as had been at first adopted which was not the case with that
belonging to the Government however the whole of that failure is
laid to the Catterpillars. The Island is very well water'd except
just at the Wt. &amp; NW end, &amp; there in the Summer Season the
runs or streams are quite dried up, at all the other parts of the
Island it has never failed It rises from Springs in different parts
of the Island One of which takes its course through the Valley
first clear'd &amp; empties itself in a little Bay formed by the
Et. Pt. of Sydney Bay, it passes under ground &amp; forces itself
up through a hole in the Rocks (which dry at low water) a fathom
deep. Neither Phillip or Nepean Islands have any water on them from
which circumstance &amp; the great difficulty of landing on them
they are of no other use to Norfolk Island except than that of
breaking the Sea from Sydney Bay in SE or Et.erly winds: The whole
three taken together do not contain more that 16 Square Miles which
is but a small spot for the purpose that Government been have sent
so many People to.</p>

<p class="caption">'Governor's House at Sydney, Port Jackson
1791'</p>

<p>It was the 22nd. before we made Lord Howes Island, which we
passed 15 leagues to the No.ward of, at which dis'ce. the land
joining the two Mountains is just seen; We had very unsettled
weather, arrived at Port Jackson the 26th where we found the Dutch
Snow laying &amp; that there had not been any Arrivals from England
since those Ships that arrived last June, charter'd for China; In
consequence of which &amp; having been particularly disappointed at
not yet seeing the Gorgon who was to have sailed immediately after
those Ships, the Governor had detained the Dutch Snow &amp; enter'd
into a Contract with the Master of her to carry the Officers &amp;
Crew of the Sirius to England.</p>

<p>We found that the Natives had lately become familiar; several of
them staying cheifly in the Camp &amp; at the Governors: Benallon
had sometime since, made his escape &amp; join'd his Old Friend
Colbey &amp; other Companions; Early in Sepr. The Governor hearing
that Benallon &amp; Colbey had been seen in Collins Cove in the No.
Arm went down there &amp; after passing some time in the most
familiar &amp; friendly manner was suddenly wounded with a Spear;
the particulars of which occurrence I take from Lt. Waterhouse who
was present at the time &amp; saw the whole transactions; His words
are:</p>

<p class="newspaper">On Tuesday 7th Sepr. Ulto. I went down the
Harbour with the Governr. &amp; Capt. Collins to the look out Post
at the South Head at which</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 226]</p>

gave directions for building a Column or Land mark for Ships coming
in from the Sea &amp; was returning up with the harbour when a Boat
that was coming up from Collins Cove (after having land'd a party
who were going to Broken Bay) made Signals to speak with us; on
their coming up, the Coxswain inform'd the Governor that the
Gentlemen going to Broken Bay had had a long conference with Colbey
&amp; Benallon in Collins Cove that they had enquired for every
person whom they knew &amp; particularly for the Governor, that
Benallon had sent him a piece of Whale &amp; said he would return
with the Governor if he would go down to him; in consequence of
which the Govr. went immediately to the look out post it being the
nearest place &amp; got everything that he thought would be
acceptable &amp; frunish'd themselves with 4 Musquets &amp; a
pistol; went down into Collins Cove. In our way down we found that
only two of the musquets could be fired both of which were loaded
as was the Pistol; when we got into Collins Cove, we saw several
Natives assembled round a fire opposite to a Whale that had been
thrown ashore; the Govr. stood up &amp; ask'd (in the Native
tongue) where was Benallon, he answer'd immediately that it he was
there; He told him that he was the Governor, his Father, which name
Benallon had desired to go call him by while living with him: The
Governor after desiring Capt. Collins &amp; me to stay by the Boat
&amp; have the Musquets</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 227]</p>

<p class="newspaper">ready, stept out &amp; advanced up the beach
with his hands &amp; Arms open, they did not seem much inclined to
come down, however the Governor persever'd &amp; follow'd them into
the Woods 'till out of our sight &amp; had a parley with some of
them, One of whom (found afterwards to be Benallon) repeatedly
called him Go- vernor &amp; Father after which &amp; having shook
hands together the Governor return'd to the Boat &amp; took a Man
up with him with some Wine, Beef &amp; Bread &amp; some presents;
On his holding up the bottle one of them call'd out Wine &amp;
repeated several English words, two of them came forward &amp;
rec'd the things &amp; one of them drank some Wine; In a short time
the Governor came again to the Boat, told Capt. Collins what he had
done, but that Colbey or Benallon was not there, &amp; ask'd Capt.
Collins to walk up with him, desiring me still to remain by the
Boat; as they went up I frequently heard a man on the right of them
call out Benallon &amp; told him of something he had observed as we
kept the Boat on her Oars (which might reasonably occasion some
mistrust as the same precaution was observed when they were
forcibly taken away &amp; in the same Cove where the Boat was now
laying) "Shortly afterwards a an come to me, said that Benallon
&amp; Colbey were there &amp; that Benallon had enquired for me
&amp; that the Governor desired that I would come up, which I
immediately did: On my getting up the bank I perceiv'd several of
the Natives on each side &amp;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 228]</p>

<p class="newspaper">eight or ten in the front all arm'd with
Spears except Colbey &amp; Benallon with whom the Governor appear'd
to be in earnest Conversation; I went up to them, but did not know
Benallon until he was pointed out to me, I then recollected him
very well &amp; we shook hands, I ask'd him several questions
alluding to circumstances that had happen'd while he lived with us,
which he perfectly understood &amp; both him &amp; Colbey ask'd me
several q. Benallon at the time the Governor was up had a
remarkable good spear, which he ask'd for, but Benallon either
could not or would not understand him but took the Spear &amp; laid
it down in the Grass, during all which time perfect Harmony
subsisted. The Natives appear'd now to be closing round us, of
which the Governor took notice &amp; said he thought we had better
retreat, there were then 19 arm'd Men near us &amp; many more that
we could not see; The Governor then assur'd Benallon he would
return in two days &amp; bring with him the Clothes he used to wear
&amp; 2 Hatchets (which they are remarkably fond of.) one for
Colbey &amp; one for himself with which they seem'd much pleas'd
&amp; often repeated it that it might not be forgot: Just as we
were going, Benallon pointed out &amp; named several of the Natives
that were about us, one in particular to whom the Governor
presented his hand &amp; advanced towards him, at which he seem'd
frighten'd, &amp; seiz'd the Spear that Benallon had laid down in
the Grass &amp; immediately</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 229]</p>

<p class="newspaper">threw it with great violence, all those who
were near retreat'd with great precipitation; The Spear struck the
Governor, enter'd the right shoulder ju &amp; went through about 3
inches just behind the should blade close to the back bone; I
immediately concluded that He was killed &amp; supposed there was
not a chance for any of us to escape I turn'd round to run for the
Boat as I perceived C.Collins running that way &amp; calling to the
People in the Boat to bring Musquets up, The Governor also
attempted to run holding the Spear with both hands to keep the end
off the ground, but owing to the length of it, the end took the
ground &amp; stop'd him short (I suppose it was 12 feet long) He
then beg'd me for God sake to haul the Spear out, which I
immediately stop'd to do, when I recollected that I should only
haul the barb into his flesh again which we knew to be an inch
long, I then determin'd on breaking it off &amp; bent it down for
that purpose, but owing to its length could not do it, I then bent
it upward but could not break it; just at this instant another
Spear came &amp; grazed the skin off between the thumb &amp;
forefinger of my right hand. I own it frighten'd me &amp; I believe
added to my exertions; for the next sudden jerk it broke short off;
Spears were then fly- ing very thick, one of which I perceiv'd fall
close at Capt Collins feet as he was speaking to the Boat Crew; The
Governor then fired a pistol, which with a Musquet that was fired
by the Sailors who had then got between the Natives &amp; us,
enabled</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 230]</p>

<p class="newspaper">us to get down to the beach. The Governor was
lifted into the Boat he being very faint; Capt. Collins soon joined
us with the Boat Crew, when we put off, &amp; got up to Sydney
within two hours, when the Surgeons who were immediately sent for
made us all happy by confidently assuring the Governor there were
not any fatal consequences to be apprehended, the Spear was then
extracted &amp; in 6 weeks he was able to get about again.</p>

<p>There are different opinions as to Colbey &amp; Benallon being
accessary to this assault, which I cannot but mistrust was the
case: However they were afterwards encouraged to come up to the
Camp, which was soon effected &amp; now they are cheifly about the
Governors House with many more of their Friends; Benallon has a
House built for him on the Et. point of Sydney Cove which he &amp;
his companions frequently visit; Notwithstanding this apparently
friendly intercourse I cannot think they are to be trusted, from
their having so frequently attack'd those who they thought were not
provided wt. fire Arms &amp; surprising &amp; Murdering some who
had Musquets. In one instance soon after our arrival from Norfolk
Island, Benallon &amp; his friends behav'd very well in swimming
off to a Boat that had overset just off Sydney Cove, they brought
the People Boat &amp; every thing belonging to her safe ashore
&amp; helped them to repair the Boat &amp; launch her again;
Benallon's Sister</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 231]</p>

<p>&amp; two children (who she swam to shore with) were in the Boat
when she overset. The Governor &amp; those Gentlemen who attend to
the getting a Vocabulary of the Native language have made
considerable progress in it, but many of the Customs of these
Savages yet remain doubtful as to the cause.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="mar91" id="mar91"></a>March 1791</p>

<p>While we were at Port Jackson, I went wt. the Governor &amp; a
Party to Benallon's House on the Et. pt. of the Cove to see a Dance
according to previous notice given to Benallon who had assembled
many of his friends for the purpose of entertaining us; they began
soon after dark, having several small fires for the purpose of
giving light, they placed us in a Ring within which they were to
perform; their Musick was that of a Man beating two sticks &amp;
singing to it &amp; some of the Women who did not dance,
accompanied the Musick by beating on their thighs with the hollow
of their hands, the dance began with the little Boys &amp; then the
Men join'd in, they danced a variety of figures all of which were
observed to have regularity &amp; good order in them, so much that
if any of the fires were in their way they danced through them, the
number that danced were 24 Men, Women &amp; Children, there were
several more there &amp; plenty of Spears laying by them; after
entertaining us about an hour &amp; they supposed we were going,
Benallon asked if we would have one more dance which was agreed to
&amp; we then parted, several of the Children returning with
us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 232]</p>

<p>I also went to Rose Hill, of which I can say but little, but the
Soil does not go any depth; a few inches in many parts goes into a
perfect sand &amp; it is but in small patches in)any part that the
Soil is a foot deep: the Return got from the last Crop only bore
the proportion of 5 to 2 that was sowed; which is only 2 ½ for one,
It is the opinion of some that it never will produce good Crops of
Corn, the quantity of ground clear'd at Rose Hill this 9th March,
is Land clear'd for Corn 213 Acres; Land for Buildings Gardens
&amp;c. 80 Acres, &amp; 121 Acres in three Parks, Total 414 Acres;
but it is to be observed that the Trees are only cut down &amp;
removed, &amp; the ground clear'd &amp; turn'd up with the Roots of
the Trees remaining in it, that all the labour is with the Grubbing
Hoe &amp; Spade, the Plough cannot be used 'till the ground is more
effectually clear'd. There has been several excursions made into
the Country all of which serve but to furnish as many Proofs of the
Sterility of the inland parts of the County of Cumberland, the
other parts of the Coasts or Country have not yet been examined.

</p>

<p class="date-jnl">Account of the different kinds of Timber &amp;
the use it is fit for; in Port Jackson</p>

<p>No.1. Gum Tree, the Gum very dark; the Wood white fit for little
but the fire, but very good for that.</p>

<p>2: Iron Wood, No Gum in it, grows very tall &amp; large all
about; but near Rose Hill in particular, fit for large Beams,
Girders, &amp;c. a very good Timber for such large uses tho' very
hard to cut &amp; to work.</p>

<p>3. Corkwood, called so because the bark is like Cork, grows near
the Sea side, just within the Harbour, none in land, not even so
far as Sydney, it is a very good Timber tho' very scarce, No Gum in
it, the largest that has been seen was about 2 feet diameter, fit
for almost any purpose; but for Boats &amp; for light boarding in
particular, such as doors &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. The Peppermint Tree, so called because the leaves taste
strongly like peppermint &amp; give an Oil, much like the Oil of
Peppermint; would make very good &amp; handsome furniture, but has
not been at all used by us in Buildings, because it does not run
sufficiently long before it branches, there is some gum in it.</p>

<p>5. The Tea Tree, so called because a little of the leaves being
put into the Native Tea gives it a pleasant spicey taste; works
very easy &amp; smooth, more fit for furniture than any thing else,
they are mostly unsound, tho' no Gum in them.</p>

<p>6. The Swamp Mahogany, grows in, or close to swamps some of it
turns out very good Timber &amp; perhaps all would if not very Old,
fit for furniture, or framing, such as doors &amp;c. the largest to
be sound is about 18 inches diameter, No Gum in it to damage it at
all.</p>

<p>7. The High Ground Mahogany, grows on higher ground, is best
wood for furniture of any in the Country; it runs to about 2 ½ feet
diameter &amp; sound, fit for doors, wainscots, door frames
&amp;c.</p>

<p>8. Brown Bark'd Gum Tree, exceeding good Timber for large uses,
grows in the Kanguroo Ground &amp; about Rose Hill, to the height
of 80 to 100 feet without a branch, some have been cut which were 9
or 10 inches diameter at about 80 feet from the base &amp; quite
sound, if is fit for very large beams &amp;c. boards for flooring,
door frames &amp; for every use in common: No Gum to hurt in
it.</p>

<p>9. Blue Bark'd Gum Tree, but little different from that last
mentioned &amp; nothing inferior in respect to size or use.</p>

<p>10. Turpentine Tree, so called because a very small quantity of
a kind of Turpentine is found between the bark &amp; the Timber
&amp; the largest from 3 to 4 feet in diameter at the base, fit for
any kind of building uses, board, flooring &amp;c. No Gum in
it.</p>

<p>11. Pine Tree, so called for no other reason than that the
leaves nearly resemble those of the Pine Tree, very good framing
Timber, also for laths, shingles, flooring &amp;c. No Gum in
it.</p>

<p>12. Honeysuckle Tree, called so because it bears a flower which
contains a great quantity of Honey grown in Sandy &amp; rocky
ground has been used particularly for Staves &amp; felloes of
wheels, Wheelbarrows &amp; some boards &amp;c. does not often grow
to more than 10 to 12 feet high &amp; from one to two feet
diameter, very crooked, no Gum in it.</p>

"acc-bounty"></a>Account of the Bounty by Lieut. Bligh</p>

<p>Bounty Arm 'd Vessel:</p>

<p>I introduce here among my general memorandums, as it in some
degree relates to the New Colony &amp; Public Service.</p>

<p>Cape of Good Hope Decr.. 20th..1789 Sir Having been so
unfortunate as to lose His Maj. arm'd Vessel Bounty; I have
transmitted to you an account of the failure of the voyage I had
the Honor to be entrusted with &amp; also a description list of the
Pirates. I passed through Endeavor Streights in the Latitude of
10:30. So. between the Prince of Wales's Islands about which are a
number of dangerous shoals: I saw but a few Islands to the No.ward
of me &amp; I have reason to think that a tolerable fair passage
may be found through to the Wt.ward about the Latitude of 10°:00'S.
I was to have explored this streight, which I should have done from
the side of New Guinea. Coupang in Timor lies 12 miles to the NE of
the SW part of the Island in Latitude 10°:12'S. Longitude by my
account 125°:45'E but by the Dutch 121°:5'Et. It is a safe &amp;
convenient Road &amp; affords good water which can be conveniently
got; other Supplies are doubtful, but what Cattle they can spare
are tolerably good: It is a pleasant Village situated on the sides
of a fine River; the Resident with four other people in the Civil
department &amp; about 30 Soldiers are the whole of the Europeans.
The No.side of the Island is the most elligible way for a Ship to
come from the Et.ward, One Ship Trades here</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 234]</p>

<p>for the Dutch Et. India Company &amp; are not allow'd to lie in
the road before the 10th of March; In April the Et.erly Monsoon is
set in &amp; continues until the middle of October or beginning of
November, the wind is however a little variable until December when
the Wt. Monsoon is steady with Rains as the Et. Monsoon is in May
with fine weather: The Island Pamow gives good anchoring places in
the Wt. Monsoon. Oranges, Limes, Breadfruit, fine CocoaNuts,
Nanca's Karambola's &amp; other Fruit are to be got at Timor, the
Horses are small &amp; but few Sheep or Goats; No more Rice or
Indian Corn is cultivated than is used. They have the Mountain Rice
which does not require any more water than the common rain. There
are some Portuguese Settlements on the No. part of the Island, who
are from report a very miserable set of People. I have thought it
my Duty to say so much of Timor as it is a place but little known
&amp; lies elligible for a Stopping place if Endeavour Streights is
found a safe route for Shipping.</p>

<p>Lt. Blighs account of the Bounty.</p>

<p>Lieut. W. Bligh presents the following account of the loss of
His Majesty's Arm'd Vessel Bounty, unto His Excellency Arthur
Phillip Esqr. &amp;c.&amp;c.&amp;c.</p>

<p>On the 23rd. of December 1787. I sailed from Spithead with
H.M.S. Bounty under my Command for Otaheite, there to take on board
the Breadfruit Plant for the West Indies. The Burthen of the Ship
was nearly 215 Tons; Her extreme length on deck 90Ft..10In. &amp;
breadth from outside to outside of the bends 24Ft..3 in. A Flush
deck &amp; a pretty Figure Head of a Woman in Riding Habit; She
mounted 4 four pounders &amp; 10 Swivels &amp; her Complement
was,</p>

<p>1. Lieut &amp; Commander 2. Masters Mates 1. Gunmen Mate<br>
1. Master 2. Midshipmen 1. Carpenters Mate<br>
1. Boatswain 1. Clerk 1. Sailmaker<br>
1. Gunner 2. Qr. Masters 1. Armourer<br>
1. Carpenter 1. Qr.Masr.Mate 1. Carpenters Crew<br>
1. Surgeon 1. Boatswains Mate 1. Corporal<br>
24 Able Seamen<br>
Total. 45 One of which is a Widows Man. There was likewise a
Botanist &amp; his Assistant.</p>

<p>On the 23rd. of March 1788. I doubled Staten Land &amp;
attempted to make my passage round Cape Horn to the Wt.ward between
the Latd. Of 59° &amp; 61°, but I met with such dreadful
tempestuous weather &amp; high Seas with Hail &amp; Snow Storms,
that altho' I tried 30 days I could not accomplish it; I
therefore</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 236]</p>

<p>(as my people were getting ill &amp; as I had the Honour to have
the most discretionary Orders to do as I thought best for the
Voyage) determined to bear away for the Cape of Good Hope on the
23rd of April &amp; repass'd Staten Land the next day: On the 24th
of May I Anchored in False Bay &amp; having Refitted &amp;
Compleated my Stores &amp; Provisions, I sailed on the 1st of July,
arrived at Van Diemans Land 20th of August &amp; after wooding
&amp; watering, I sailed from thence the 4th September.</p>

<p>On the 19th Sepr. After having pass'd the So. part of New
Zealand I discovered very dangerous Rocky Islots never known
before, they extend 3 ½ Miles Et. &amp; Wt. &amp; 1 ½ No. &amp; So.
they lie from the Traps off the So. end of New Zealand, S89°Et 146
Leags. Latd. Of them in 47°:44'So. Longitude 179°:09'Et. called
them Bounty Isles. I arrived at Otaheite the 26th of October &amp;
remain'd until the 4th April 1789 when I sailed with 1015
Breadfruit Plants &amp; many other Fruit kind in all 774 Pots, 39
Tubs &amp; 24 Boxes. Obsd. In Totourah Harbour 17°.31':30"So.
210°.31':37"Et. I anchor'd at Anamocka the 24th April &amp; left it
the 26th.</p>

<p>On the 28th A little before Sunrise Fletcher Christian who was
Mate of the Ship &amp; Officer of the Watch, with the Ships
Corporal came into my Cabin while I was asleep &amp; seizing me
tied my hands, assisted by others who were also in the Cabin all
arm'd with Musquets &amp; Bayonets; I was now threaten'd with
instant death if I spoke a word, I however called for assistance
&amp; awakening every one; but the Officers who were</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 237]</p>

<p>in their Cabins were secured by Centinels at their doors, so
that no one could come to me; The Arms were all taken possession of
&amp; I was forced on deck in my shirt with my hands tied behind my
back &amp; secured by a Guard abaft the Mizn.Mast during which the
Mutineers express'd much joy that they would soon again see
Otaheite.</p>

<p>I now demanded of Christian the cause of such a violent act, but
no other answer was given but hold your tongue Sir, or you are dead
this instant &amp; holding me by the line which tied my hands he
often threaten'd to stab me in the breast with a Bayonet he held in
his right hand. I however did my utmost to rally the disaffected
Villains to a sense of their duty but to no effect.</p>

<p>The Boatsn. was order'd to hoist the Launch out &amp; while I
was kept under a guard abaft the Mizen Mast the Officers &amp; Men
not concern'd in the Mutiny were order'd into the Boat, this being
done I was told by Christian Capt.Bligh, your Officers &amp; Men
are now in the boat &amp; you must go with them, &amp; with the
guard they carried me across the deck with their Bayonets presented
on every side, when making another effort, one Villain said to the
other, blow his brains out. I was at last forced into the Boat
&amp; we wore then veer'd astern in all 19 Souls. I was at this
time 10 leagues from Tofoa the NW most of the Friendly Islands. The
Boatswain &amp; Carpenter with some other whilst the Boat was
alongside collected several necessary</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 238]</p>

<p>things &amp; water, &amp; with some difficulty a Compass &amp;
Quadrant were got, but Arms of no kind, nor any Maps or drawings of
which I had a valuable collection. The Boat was very deep &amp;
much lumber'd &amp; in this condition we were cast adrift with
about 28 Gallons of Water 150 lbs of bread 30 lb of Pork 6 Quarts
of Rum &amp; 6 Bottles of Wine; the day was Calm attended with
light breezes &amp; I got to Tofoa by 7 O'clock in the evening but
found no place to land the shore being so steep &amp; rocky:</p>

<p>On the 30th I found landing in a Cove on the NWpart of the
Island &amp; here I remain'd in search of Supplies until the 2nd of
May when the Natives discovering that we had no fire Arms, they
made an attack upon us with Clubs &amp; Stones; In the course of
which I had the misfortune to lose a very worthy man (John Norton
Qmaster) &amp; most of us hurt, more or less; Getting into our Boat
was no security, for they followed us in Canoes loaded with stones,
which they threw with much force &amp; exactness, happily night
saved the rest of us.</p>

<p>I had determined to go to Amsterdam in search of Poulahow the
King but taking this transaction as a sample of their natural
dispositions, there was little hopes to expect much from them; for
I consider 'd their good behaviour hitherto as owing to a dread of
our fire Arms, &amp; now knowing that we had none, would not be the
case &amp; that supposing our lives were safe, our Boat &amp; every
thing would be taken from us</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 239]</p>

<p>&amp; thereby I should never be able to return. I was also
earnestly solicited by all hands to take them towards home &amp;
when I told them no hopes of releif remain'd for us but what I
might find at New Holland until I came to Timor a distance of 1200
leagues they all agreed to live on one Ounze of Bread pr Day &amp;
a Jill of Water; I therefore after recommending this promise
forever to their Memory, bore away for New Holland &amp; Timor
across a Sea but little known &amp; in a small Boat deep loaded
with 18 People, without a Single Map of any kind &amp; nothing but
my own recollection &amp; general knowledge of the situation of
places to direct us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we lost part of our Provisions, our stock now only
consisted of 20 lbs of Pork, 3 bottles of wine, 5 of Rum &amp; 150
lbs of Bread &amp; 28 Gallons of Water. I steer'd to the WNW with
Strong Gales &amp; bad weather suffering every Calamity &amp;
distress.</p>

<p>I discover'd many Islands &amp; at last on the 28 May, the Coast
of New Holland &amp; enter'd a break in the Reef in Latitude about
12°:50'.S. &amp; Longitude 145°:00' Et. I kept on in the direction
of this Coast to the No.ward, touching at such places as I found
convenient, refreshing my People by the best means in my power,
these Refreshments consisted of Oysters &amp; a few Clams, we were
greatly benefited by them &amp; a few good nights rest; On the 4th
of June I past the No. part of New Holland, steer'd for Timor &amp;
made it on the 12th</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 240]</p>

<p>Lt. Blighs account of the Bounty.</p>

<p>which was a happy sight for every one, particularly several who
perhaps could not have existed a week or a day longer.</p>

<p>I followed the direction of the So.side of the Island &amp; on
the 14th in the afternoon saw the Island of Rotty &amp; West part
of Timor, round which I got that night &amp; took a Malay on board
to shew me Coupang where he informed me the Governor resided; On
the next morning before day I anchored under the Fort &amp; about
11 O'Clock I saw the Governor who received me with great Humanity
&amp; kindness; Necessary directions were instantly given for our
support &amp; perhaps a more miserable set of Beings were never
seen. Thus happily ended through the assistance of Divine
Providence without accident, a Voyage of the most extraordinary
Nature that ever happened in the World, let it be taken in its
Extent Duration &amp; so much want of the Necessaries of Life.</p>

description list will shew the Strength of the Pirates. I remained
at Timor till the 20th of August when I sailed &amp; arrived at

on the 16th of October &amp; arrived at the Cape of Good Hope 16 of

<p>Sign'd. W Bligh. Lt. Commander</p>

<p class="footnote">[Inserted between pages 244-245]</p>

<p>The Mutineers after turning Capt. Bligh adrift, made sail &amp;
steer'd for the Island Tubai, at which place they had determin'd to
Fortify &amp; settle themselves, but on their arrival, found
themselves destitute of almost every necessary towards effecting
their purpose; it was then agreed to go to Otaheite for those
necessaries, making the best story they could to deceive the
Natives, in which they succeeded by telling that they had been at
an Island, where they had met their old friend Capt. Cook, (who
they had supposed was dead) &amp; that he had kept Capt. Bligh
&amp; all those who were with him, at Tubai, &amp; sent Mr.
Christian with the Ship for what supplies they could grant.</p>

<p>They readily beleiv'd the story &amp; were so overjoy'd at
hearing that Capt. Cook was alive &amp; again in that part of the
world, that they furnish'd Christian with every thing he wanted
&amp; even gave them a Bull &amp; Cow; with these they again all
went to Tubai &amp; went on with every success towards settling;
but soon quarrelling among themselves, Christian lost his Authority
&amp; nothing was done; He then took their opinions the majority of
which were for going to Otaheite, to which place Christian carried
them &amp; afterwards left the Island with the remainder &amp; some
Natives of Otaheite &amp; which is the last account gain'd of
Christian by the Pandora.</p>

<p>Those who were left at Otaheite, built a Schooner in which some
of them had embark'd under the direction of Morrison the Bos.Mate,
but soon losing confidence in him they again return'd to Otaheite;
where Churchill was made a Cheif by the Natives &amp; killed by
Thompson in a quarrel, the consequence of which was that they
Natives killed Thompson &amp; offer'd him up as a human sacrifice
according to the Custom used among them.</p>

with the Schooner, were:</p>

<p>On Monday the 28th March We sailed out of the Harbour with a
light land breeze, as we stood off shore we saw the Column or Land
Mark on the So. Head to the distance of 6 leags. Yet I think a
Stranger who did not exactly know where to look for it would not
discover it at more than half that distance except coming along the
Shore from the Southward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="apr91" id="apr91"></a>April 1791</p>

<p>We were to have called at Norfolk Island in our way to the
No.ward, but were so unfortunate as to be driven to the So.ward two
degrees by a series of contrary winds &amp; bad weather &amp; which
prevented our making any progress to the No.ward 'till the 14th of
April when the wind came to the So.ward. &amp; hauling round to the
SE &amp; Et.ward. as we approach'd Norfolk Island forced us 20
leagues to leeward of it when we crossed its Parallel, which
circumstance together with that of the wind appearing to be steady
&amp; fixed at East, it was determined not to lose time in
endeavoring to beat up to it, but proceed immediately on our</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 247]</p>

<p>Voyage, intending to pass to the So.ward &amp; Et.ward of New
Caledonia but the wind inclining continued so far to the Eastward
that, on the 23rd. [April] we made the Isle of Pines &amp; could
not weather it; We stood off for the night &amp; in again at
daylight &amp; finding that we could not get to windward of it we
bore away at 9 O'Clock to run to the Wt'ward.</p>

<p>Sunday. 24th: Standing along by the shore passed 5 low Islands
which seem'd to encircled by a Reef, At ½ pt. 2PM: We hauled off
without the outermost land then in sight, about 4 Breakers were
seen to the SbW &amp; soon after to the SW &amp; more to the Wt.
&amp; seem'd to be connected having some small Islands within it;
We now discover'd that we had mistaken the Isle of Pines for Queen
Charlottes Foreland &amp; that we had got into the bight between
the Isle of Pines &amp; the Shoals to the SW of it, the Wind &amp;
a great Swell setting right over them, our situation was very
dangerous;</p>

<p>We continued all night to work the Ship with a great press of
Sail to keep her to windward in which we succeeded so well as to be
able to stretch along the Reef at daylight &amp; passed the So.
extremity of it at 10 AM at 3 Miles distant; Near the So.ext. is a
considerable opening &amp; smooth water within it, over which the
Reef was seen to the NW as far as the eye could reach from the
MastHead. We did not see breakers close home to the Foreland but
from some small Islands shewing themselves between it &amp; the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 248]</p>

<p>Breakers which we saw, gave us reason to suppose that it is one
extensive Reef from that land running about SEbS 32 Miles to the
So. Extremity round which we passed; &amp; lies from the Highland
of the Isle of Pines SWbS¼W by Compass 29 Miles &amp; is in
23°:00'So.Lat: 167°:17'Et.Long.&amp;c, according to our Longitude
corrected; It is a very dangerous Reef &amp; appears to be on
considerable breadth. The SE Trade appeared steady which with which
we steer';d to the No.ward giving the West side of New Caledonia a
reasonable birth;</p>

<p>On the 29th the Trade freshen'd into a Gale with very squally
weather in Latd.20:39 Longte. 162:18 Et. &amp; continued, sometimes
blowing very strong with much rain.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="may91" id="may91"></a>May 1791</p>

<p>Till the 5th May in 11°:56'S...163°:58'Et., at 8PM it suddenly
fell Calm &amp; variable light Airs; After which we had moderate
breezes with frequent Squalls &amp; variable winds; We passed
between Queen Charlottes Islands &amp; the Land discover'd by
Lieut. Ball in the Supply last year with seeing either.</p>

<p>Our Longitude when we pass'd the Parellel of Gonont Island was
nearly the same as Capt. Carteret had fixed West Coast of that
Island to lie in; Our Longitude being determined from Observations
taken some days before &amp; after I am inclined to think the error
is likely to be with him &amp; that He has placed them too far too
the Wt.ward; how much is impossible for us to say, but it was
observed</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 249]</p>

<p>that nearly about passing the parallel of those Islands we had
every indication of Land being very near us to the Et.ward.</p>

<p>Monday. 9th at 7 AM Saw Land to the WNW which had the appearance
of being an Island, soon after saw another to the Et.ward of it; at
9 Bore away &amp; stood towards them, At 10 saw 2 more Islands
&amp; at Noon another came open with the Island first seen, they
are very small Islands 5 in number forming an Irregular figure that
11 Miles would circumscribe; We saw broken water between some of
them but passed at too great a distance to ascertain whether they
are all connected by a Reef or not.</p>

<p>From our Latitude we at first supposed this Land to be Carterets
Island but we soon satisfied that it could not be, from the extent
of this little Groupe; &amp; to be more clear, we stood to the
No.ward for Gowers Island &amp; not meeting with it convinced us
that this was a new discovery; The middle of the Groupe is in
8°:26'So.Latd &amp; 163°:07'Et. by Observation of the [sun] &amp;
[moon] taken the preceding day, they lie N14E.. 50 leagues from the
Et.most Pt. of Balls Maiden Land (disc. by him in the Supply last
year). They are cover'd with Trees of the Palm &amp; Cocoa Nut
&amp; some large trees on one of them; We did not see the least
appearance of Inhabitants: Just to the No.ward of these Islands is
we found a ripling like a Race, thro' which we passed in a few
minutes.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 250]</p>

<p>We steer'd from these Islands WNW with a fine steady Et.ly wind
&amp; on Thursday 12th at 9 AM. Saw breakers on the Starboard bow;
immediately after which, saw the Sea break nearly in the Ships
wake, which shoal she must have passed over very close; the Water
being exceedingly smooth 'till near 9 O'Clock it did not break when
the Ship passed it &amp; it was but seldom that it did break
afterward; those on the bow were a continual foam of broken Water
&amp; it appear'd to be sand banks by the colour of the Water round
them; at ½ pt.10 We were abreast of the No.most at 3 Miles
distance, when more breakers were seen on the larboard beam &amp;
abaft it, in two detached shoals, We could not clear these, or the
others before seen, by hauling our Wind on either Tack, we
therefore stood on our Course &amp; passed clear through.</p>

<p>How far they extend NE &amp; SW we could not ascertain, their
Extent NW &amp; SE is 7 Miles by our Run &amp; the breadth of the
Channel through which we passed is 8 Miles from Shoal to Shoal; We
could not get any soundings 130 fm. in passing through; the middle
of this Channel which is called Wachraamheydt Passage from the name
of Ship lies in 6°:52'So.. 161°:06'E by [sun] &amp; [moon]. &amp;
is situated N52°W...51 leags. from the little groupe of Islands
disc. the 9th: They are very dangerous shoals, those to the No.ward
of us broke in 6 detach'd Parts &amp; those to the So.ward in 2,
One of which was an extensive Range of broken water, they appear to
be but little below</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 251]</p>

<p>the surface steep too &amp; no part dry. Steering on the same
course WNW on Satruday.14th. At daylight; saw Land from NW to SE,
appear'd to be several Islands; At 6, Thirty two, including Rocks
above water; were counted from the Masthead; At 7. There were 20
distinctly seen; small, low &amp; well cover'd with Trees, the
largest Island is about 4 Miles in length Et. &amp; Wt. Our Course
carried us along nearly parallel to them; At 9. Another Island was
seen to the NNW of the Wt.most of those first seen; Some rocks were
seen above water, but as we did not pass nearer than 9 Miles we
could not determine whether any of them were joined or surrounded
by a Reef:</p>

<p>About 10, we saw 6 Canoes with Sails coming from different parts
of the Land towards us; We still kept on our Course that it was
Noon before any of them came up with us &amp; then only one Canoe
with 9 People in, they came close to the Ship, but would not come
on board, Some Nails, Beads &amp;c. were thrown to them &amp; they
in return threw back pieces of Cocoa Nuts: They were tall &amp;
stout; One of them was painted Red over the face &amp; appear'd to
be a cheif or leading Man, they were not provided with anything for
Trade, not nor had they any Weapons with them, their Hair, or long
wool was tied close upon the head as is the Custom in many parts of
the Et.Indies; they either had not any beards, or were close
shaved, they wore ornaments</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 252]</p>

<p>Ornaments round their Necks, Arms &amp;c. the cheif of which
appear'd to be Hair plaited with Bone &amp; Shells made fast to the
ends, they wore ornaments also through the Nose, &amp; which we
took to be hair plaited or twisted &amp; put through on both sides
so as to lo hang down as low as the lips, on the ends of some of
these were fasten'd peices of Shells in imitation of teeth; they
appear'd to be very friendly disposed &amp; wanted us to go to the
Islands, they were naked except a peice of Matting round the waist;
Some of the Gentlemen on board observed that they were tatowed but
I noticed nothing but the marks of paint or dirt on any of their
bodies.</p>

<p>The Canoe I take to between 30 &amp; 40 feet in length, very
narrow, with an Outrigger, the sides consisted of two planks laced
or sew'd together &amp; brought to a point at both ends rather
inclining downwards than rising, they use single paddles &amp; have
a Latteen Sail, they were about half an hour with us &amp; some of
the others close up, when the breeze freshening we left them. These
Islands have every appearance of Supplying the Inhabitant very
plentifully with the necessaries of Life. It is probable that these
Islands extend farther to the Et.ward, as the Et.most of those we
saw, was on the quarter &amp; 7 leagues distant when the first seen
at daylight. Those which we saw &amp; determined the situation of,
extend from 5°:18' to 5°:29'.So.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 253]</p>

<p>&amp; from 159°:14' to 159°:36'Et. by [sun] &amp; [moon].
Variation of the Compass 8°:00'Et.. These Islands lie NWbW 44
leagues form the Shoals which we passed through the 12th &amp;
might afford releif to any who may be so unfortunate as to get on
those Shoals, provided they could escape with their Boats or
otherwise, if the Ship could not be removed. Whether this is a new
discovery, or part of those Islands seen by an American Vessel
bound to China in 1787, I am doubtful.</p>

<p>A great quantity of our Water having leak'd out owing to the
badness of the Casks, we were furnish'd with at Port Jackson, made
it absolutely necessary that we should recruit it we therefore
steer'd for Cape St.George intending to water at one of the Ports
in the Streight between New Britain &amp; New Zealand that Capt.
Carteret had visited, we found the Et.ly winds very weak at this
time: Wednesday. 18th. At ½ pt. 8AM Saw land, which was soon
discover'd to be low Islands cover'd with Trees &amp; from our
situation they were the SE.most of the 9 Islands mention'd by Capt.
Carteret; at the same time we saw high Land to the SW which had
every appearance of forming a streight between the Land discover'd
by Mr.Ball in the Supply &amp; the Louisiade New Georgia of Lt.
Shortland: We stood for the Islands till within 3 Miles of the
So.most &amp; then along by a reef which run off WbS from it &amp;
seem'd to surround the other Islands</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 254]</p>

<p>in sight; they extend North 5 Miles &amp; WNW 8 Miles from the
So.most of them: The Reef seem'd to be a sandy spit with some Rocks
on it &amp; dry in many parts &amp; in one place between the
So.most &amp; Wt.most of these Islands just round the Pt. of the
Spit along which we passed there was an opening seen &amp; the
appearance of deepwater &amp; good shelter within it; We saw
several of the Natives on the dry sand &amp; some Canoes came out
&amp; made towards us, but the Breeze freshening, they could not
come up; These Islands are small &amp; have a beautiful appearance
being cover'd with Cocoa Nuts &amp; other Trees with sandy beaches
to the water side.</p>

<p>Thursday. 19th: We steer'd WbS &amp; W½S along by the shore of
either New Georgia or the Louisiade at the distance of 10 or 12
leags. &amp; which had the appearance of being Islands, At 2,AM We
passed the Wt.ern extremity of the Land seen at SunSet at 5 leagues
distance sounded frequently 130 fm. no ground; At 5AM Saw Sir Chal.
Hardy's Island bearing N.2°W 5 leagues &amp; Land which had the
appearance of being an Island S48°E 6 leagues which we conclude is
the Land mentioned by Capt. Carteret Winchelsea Island, &amp;

at 2AM &amp; had much the appear'ce of being a projecting point of
the Main Land when to the Et. of it, it is very high, running out
to the No.ward in a low sandy point on which the Sea breaks very
high; We did</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 255]</p>

<p>not see any land to the Southward of it; At 5 AM Had several
very good Observations for the Longitude by the Moon &amp; á Aquila
from which the Latitudes Obsn. This &amp; the preceding Noons I fix
the following places.</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p>Friday 20th: At 6Pm Saw Cape St.George bearing N80°E 7 leagues
&amp; the No. extreme of New Ireland N26°W, Hitherto we had not met
with any Current to speak of, but this night bringing too off Cape
St.George we were carried to the So.ward out of sight of it; At 6
AM We again got sight of it &amp; the wind being favourable we
steer'd right in for it. Cape St.George by our Observations is in
4°:51'So. &amp; 153°:15'Et. which is only 30 6m. to the Et.wd. of
that given in the New Requisite Tables &amp; 56m. to the Et. of
Capt Carterets, we also found nearly the same difference between
Capt Carterets account of the 9 Islands, Sr. C.Hardys &amp;
Winchelsea Islands.</p>

<p>Saturday. 21. The wind So.ly wt. light breeze, AM Stood for
Gowers Harbour, but had so light a breeze the tide or Current
carried</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 256]</p>

<p>carried us so far to the Wt.ward, that when a fresh Seabreeze
came in from the SEbS we could not fetch it but stood in for the
Land to leeward of it.</p>

<p>Sunday.22nd. At 2PM Bore away for Carterets Harbour which Port
we unfortunately overshot; Having missed both Harbours we stood for
the NW along the shore in hopes of finding a watering place; At 8.
It fell Calm &amp; continued so with variable light Airs 'till 2AM
the next day when a breeze sprung up from the SW enabled us to get
the length of the Et.pt. of the Duke of Yorks Island; whilst we
were thus becalm'd we did not observe a NW Current setting through
but an equal tide as much one way as the other &amp; the same on
both shores, We sent the Boat along the shore of New Britain Cape
Bulbes &amp; Cape Palliser to look for Anchorage but they did not
find any.</p>

<p>Monday.23rd.. AM At day light being off the NEpt. Of the Duke of
Yorks Island sent the Boat to examine the Coast on the No. side of
it &amp; look for water; following with the Vessel, The Boat was
met by a great number of the Natives in their Canoes, they were
very friendly, exchanged some Cocoa Nuts for peices of Iron hoop,
Our People gave them 2 kegs to fill with water, which they return'd
with to them in a few minutes; they were very numerous all along
the shore, walking along as the Ship pass'd &amp; the Canoes
accompanied the Boat; We did not find Anchoring ground 'till</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 257]</p>

<p>near the NW part of the Island, where we follow'd the Boat into
a very fine Cove where we anchored at Noon in 25fm.. Natives very
numerous &amp; friendly, some of them came on board. Tuesday.24th:
PM. An Officer was sent on shore to look for the watering place;
found one in the SE bend of the Cove; the Natives were very
numerous &amp; all Armed wt. Spears, Clubs or Slings &amp; Nets
full of Stones, they walked into the water to meet the Boat as we
landed &amp; seem'd quite familiar, but as our party was going up
into the Wood with them they were met by an Old Man who insisted
that they should return to the beach, this Old fellow appearing to
have the Controul of the Multitude &amp; seeming to be much
displeas'd it was judged best to return on board, they all came to
the Water side with us, the same as on our landing:</p>

<p>Soon after the Boat return'd, two Guns were fired from the
Vessel into the Woods, this occasion'd those Natives who were on
board to Jump overboard instantly &amp; all the Canoes pulled to
the Shore; Great numbers of the Natives had assembled on the beach,
several of them blowing a white powder out of their hands which
appear'd like smoke; this seem'd to shew displeasure &amp; a degree
of defiance, it was observed that the Men who did it always
advanced on the beach &amp; blew it off towards the Ship; Some of
them in Canoes in</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 258]</p>

<p>passing the Ship did the same; They were blowing Conchs &amp;
making a great noise all night &amp; it appear'd by their
frequently calling to each other at different stations that they
kept a look out upon us; At daylight, An Armed Party was sent on
shore with the Waterers &amp; arm'd Boat to lay off &amp; Cover
them; they found the Natives troublesome &amp; seem'd to be much
disposed to quarrel they blew off the white powder in several of
our People's faces.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 25th. PM. The Natives still continued to be very
troublesome &amp; at length threw some stones which struck the
Armed Boat, on which a firing began from the Boat &amp; Armed Party
on shore &amp; several Guns with Round &amp; Grape were fired from
the Ship into the woods in different parts of the Cove, the Natives
instantly fled, &amp; when any of them came in sight they were
fired at by the Arm'd Party, which effectively kept the watering
place clear. AM At daylight We weigh'd &amp; warped the Ship over
towards the watering place &amp; moored with a Hawser, Head &amp;
Stern to keep our broadside to bear both on the watering place
&amp; that part of the beach where the Natives had assembled; We
fired some Guns with Round Shot into the Woods before our Party
landed, they were not the least interrupted; Many of the Natives
left this Cove with their Canoes, whilst others came in from the
Wt.ward offering Cocoa Nuts &amp; by signs gave us to understand,
that</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 259]</p>

<p>it was not them that had behaved ill; No notice was taken of
them, they soon went leisurely out of the Cove: In all parties of
them were seen about the Cove but not one appear'd near the
watering place.</p>

<p>Thursday. 26th. In the evening, as soon as our People had left
the Shore, several of the Natives came down on the beach near the
Watering place with green boughs in their hands &amp; unarm'd,
bringing Cocoa Nuts &amp; shewing every sign of their earnest
wishes to make peace, others brought Cocoa Nuts, Plantains &amp;c.
and laid them down on the beach in two heaps &amp; on the top of
each was put a young dog with its legs tied: As soon as the Boats
came off, one of them was sent with an Officer to receive their
Peace Offering &amp; establish friendly intercourse with them;</p>

<p>On the Officers landing, He was presented with two long boughs
about which were several platted lines made fast at the top &amp;
about half way down the Stick the bight hanging slack, when these
were received they express'd great Joy &amp; immediately shouting a
kind of Song brought every thing to the Boats that had been laid in
the two heaps on the beach &amp; the two little dogs: In return
they had a Dog &amp; Bitch Spaniel given to them, with which they
were much pleas'd &amp; shouting a Song retired in small parties.
In the morning several of them came to the watering place but
unarmed, they brought Cocoa Nuts with them for our</p>

<p>People &amp; so much afraid of giving offense that they would
scarce move or speak for sometime without observing the
countenances of our People to see if they were pleas'd; several
Canoes came about the Ship but very few Cocoa Nuts or other useful
articles could be procured; Some Spears, Slings &amp;c. were
exchanged for mere trifles, Iron they do not value.</p>

<p>Friday.27th. The Water being complete soon after Noon, I had the
Boats to survey the Cove; having occasion to Land near the Water
place, We were met by a great number of the Natives who presented
the bough the same as yesterday &amp; then carried several Cocoa
Nuts to the Boats; We returned on board about Sunset had only time
just to Survey the Cove without examing further to the Wt.ward,
than to see that there was another Cove &amp; the appearance of a
very good Harbor round the Wt.Point of it.</p>

<p>AM At daylight, sent the Boats for a turn of water to fill all
up, this morning several Women came in Canoes to the Ship, which
was now intirely surrounded by the Natives of all descriptions, but
very few useful articles were exchanged. At 9 A Breeze springing up
from the SE Weigh'd &amp; stood out of the Cove. The Master of the
Transport now to with his own Officers now took charge of
Navigating the Vessel &amp; of the respective Watches, which had
hitherto been done by Captain Hunter &amp; the Officers</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 261]</p>

<p>belonging to the Sirius We were very unlucky in not having an
opportunity of getting any Observations for the Longitude, we
therefore determine it from those taken off Cape St.George.
152°:37'Et. Latitude Obsn. At Anchor 4°:08'So. This Cove lies
within a Mile of a small woody Island forming the NW point of Duke
of Yorks Island &amp; is very convenient for a Ship to stop at
coming through St.Georges Channel, off the Et.pt. of the Bay ½ a
Cables length is a Reef of Rocks running out from the Shore after
passing which, there is no danger, the Soundings in the Bay are 20
&amp; 25 fm. muddy bottom by the lead but the People fishing
brought up several large peices of Coral Rocks; There is another
Cove just round the Wt. point of this which has good Anchorage in
it &amp; to the SW of that there is every appearance of a fine
Harbour.</p>

<p>Although we only got a few Cocoa Nuts &amp; Yams we saw that the
Island produced Breadfruit, Plantains Bananas, Mangoes &amp;
several other fruits, very fine Sugar Cane, Beetle Nuts, the Wild
Nutmeg; Cocoa Nuts &amp; Yams in great abundance: They have Hogs,
Dog &amp; Poultry among them but we could not procure any of
either. The Men in general are stout &amp; well made, long woolly
hair &amp; beards which most of them keep cover'd with a powder
that appear'd to us to be made from burnt Coral, It is white when
first used but the heat of the Sun turns it to a reddish brown
&amp; in time takes great part of the hair off, the Women that</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 262]</p>

<p>we saw were very diminutive &amp; ugly; Both Sexes go quite
Naked, they have a variety of Ornaments which they wear cheifly
about the Neck &amp; round the Arms, consisting of Bone, Shell
&amp; the teeth of some Animal. They are of very different
complexions some being quite black &amp; others not darker than the
Malays; they appear to live in society their Huts being many of
them close together, they have inclosures for their Plantains
&amp;c. but as not one went into the Country we only conjecture
that it is in most parts cultivated &amp; from the very Robust
appearance of the Men, they no doubt live in plenty.</p>

<p>Some of the Gentlemen planted Indian Corn, Garavances, Peas,
Pumpkins, Melons &amp; made them understand that the Produce from
them was good to eat; &amp; the Corn particularly so for their
Poultry. Their Huts are not above 5 feet high with a small door
&amp; without any window, the floor is hard clay &amp; very smooth
&amp; before each Hut is a small clear plot. Their weapons are
Spears, Clubs &amp; Slings with which they throw stones; Spears
&amp; Clubs they have a great variety of &amp; appear to be used in
close fighting; The Sling is made of Flax neatly twisted each part
about 4 feet long of the size of a small fishing line, these are
made fast to a kind of basket 3 inches long &amp; 1 ½ broad in
which they put the stone, they carry nets filled with stones about
with them They Fish with Spears, Nets which are very neatly</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 263]</p>

<p>made &amp; strong, they also use hooks &amp; lines. We did not
observe any of their Spears either for fishing or fighting to be
barbed. They shew great ingeniousness in the workmanship of their
Canoes, Weapons &amp;c being all neatly carved &amp; ornament'd,
the bottom of the Canoe is hollowed out of a Tree, on which is a
streak of 9 inches or a foot very neatly &amp; securely on each
side &amp; brought to a point at both ends, on each of which is
fixed (not very firm) a kind of Ornamental Prow turning abruptly
up, inclin'g inwards &amp; coming in a Curve to a point; they are
of different lengths from 12 to 30 &amp; 40 feet &amp; none more
that 16 inches in breadth, they have an Outrigger which is neatly
but not firmly fixed; the Paddles are single blade which is broad
&amp; with which they row very fast, they are ornamented with Carve
work &amp; Paint: We did not observe that any of them used a
Sail.</p>

<p>Saturday. 28th: Wind at SE, steer'd to the Westward along by the
shore of New Ireland at about 12 leagues distant; At 8.AM Saw
Sandwich Island, the Latd. &amp; Longitude of the So.Coast of it I
fix from Observn. &amp; bearing at Noon, Etpt. 2°:58'So....150°:26'
Et. West Point 2°:56'So. ... 150°:06' Et.</p>

<p>Sunday.29th. At 3PM Pass'd the Wt.end of Sandwich Island at 5
leagues distance, the length of the Island Et &amp; Wt. is 21 Miles
&amp; does not appear to be more than 4 or 5 No. &amp; So. the
Coast of New Ireland is about 5 leagues from the No.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 264]</p>

<p>side of it: This Island has every appearance of being equally
fertile with Duke of York Island &amp; considerably larger; there
does not appear to be any danger about the shore; &amp; which seems
to promise good shelter for shipping. We did not see any Canoes, I
suppose our distance &amp; being directly to windward prevented
their coming out to us: At 5 saw the Wt.part of New Ireland &amp;
the Islands laying off it &amp; New Hanover which we passed in the
night at 7 leags. distance: AM At 5 saw the Portland Isles from
NobW to NW &amp; pass'd them steering WbS by Compass at the
distance of 4 Miles from the So.most of them &amp; which appear'd
to be near the middle of the Groupe; it is situated in 2 2°: 38'So.
Latitude We saw 9 Islands all small &amp; cover'd with Trees they
extend Et. &amp; Wt. from 149°:10' to 149°:06'Et.: It is necessary
to observe that from the constant cloudiness of the weather, that
those place since passing Cape St.George which we have determined
the situation of as near as circumstances would admit, may be
liable to some error.</p>

<p>We found St. Georges Channel a very clear good Navigation &amp;
affords refreshments to those passing through without much loss of
time; We found a regular tide until the length of Sandwich Island,
where we found a strong Wt.erly current which appear'd to alter its
direction to the No.ward between New Hanover &amp; New Ireland; We
did not see the appearance of any Shoal</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 265]</p>

<p>all through the Channel, nor could we ever get sounds but just
off &amp; in the Cove where we anchored; The shore of New Ireland
is very Mountainous &amp; appears to be but thinly inhabited; New
Britain is moderately high cover'd with Trees, appears to be
cultivated &amp; very full of Inhabitants; near the No. pt. of New
Britain is three Hills or Mountains called by Capt. Carteret the
Mother &amp; Daughters from one of which a vast column of smoke
almost constantly issued. We found the winds variable between Cape
St.George &amp; Sandwich Island.</p>

<p>Monday.30th. Squally unsettled weather: At 7AM Saw an Island to
the NW, At 9 saw 2 more which at Noon we discover'd to join &amp;
form one large Island.</p>

<p>Tuesday.31st.. Modt. &amp; fair weather, at 3PM Saw a Canoe wt.
a Sail standing out from the Island first seen, but the Ship being
to windward &amp; a fresh breeze we soon lost sight of her, At 4
this Island bore No.7 Miles from which I fix its situation
2°:19'So. &amp; 147°:52'Et., it is about 1¼Mile in length &amp; has
a very beautiful appearance, the shore towards the Wt.end off which
lies a Reef, is rocky Cliffs &amp; to the Et.ward &amp; top sides
of the Hills it is cover'd with trees, with some open patches
delightfully green on the sides as we stood on to the Wt.ward we
saw another Island; the wind being from the So.ward could not
weather the large Island, we brought too for the night &amp; at day
light</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 266]</p>

<p>found ourselves nearly in the same situation as when we brought
too; Many other Islands were seen bearing from So.25°W round to the
Wt.ward &amp; No.ward to N23°Et. &amp; the Island we passed
yesterday bore No.80°Et. 15 Miles; Some Canoes came off from the
large Island; at 8 we were within 4 Miles of it &amp; nearly Calm;
the Canoes came near the Ship but would not come alongside: I take
them to be about 30 feet in length, they had a Platform or Stage in
each, in the Midships which went out some distance on the Outrigger
on the larboard side &amp; projected with a rising over the
starboard side, they had there were People on these Stages besides
those who paddled, the greatest number I saw in one Canoe were 5 on
the Stage and 6 at the paddles, one of those on the Stage had
evidently the Command of the Canoe, they had Bows &amp; Arrows with
them, but we saw nothing Hostile in their manner;</p>

<p>We had reason to suppose they had been visited before, from
their signifying to us by signs that they wanted to exchange some
things with us &amp; one of them went regularly through the motions
of shaving himself, These people were ornamented with Shells &amp;
Bones in Rings round their Arms &amp; hanging about their necks,
the had something about their Waist which was supposed to be Bow
Strings; The Man who we supposed to Command had his hair tied on
the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 267]</p>

<p>top of his head &amp; was painted on the face &amp; breast, they
were near half an hour about the Ship, a fresh breeze springing up
from the So.ward with rain they left us, We steer'd to the Wt.ward
to get through between some of the Islands but finding them very
thick in that direction &amp; some shoals shewing themselves we
bore away to the NW for a passage between two Islands that appear'd
to be clear.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jun91" id="jun91"></a>June 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday. 1st. June. Modt. Breezes &amp; showers of Rain PM At
1. Passed through between two of the Islands (had no soundings)
&amp; saw a very extensive Island to the Wt.ward; We steer'd WNW
for the Et.most part of it &amp; at day light found it to be the NE
point of a very large Island the No. Coast of which lay nearly Et.
&amp; Wt. as far West as the eye could reach from the MastHead; We
did not see the appearance of any Islands or Rocks laying off the
No.ward of it: the Wind shifting to the WSW prevented our ranging
along the shore; The extremes of this Island seen &amp; some of the
other Islands, are determined by the Latitude Obsd. &amp; Longitude
corrected, as follows.</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p>There are several Islands laying to the ENE of these, the tops
of which were only seen from the Mast Head.</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; original
journal]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 268]</p>

<p>This Land comprehends a very extensive &amp; beautiful Country
to appearance: &amp; divided into a numerous cluster of small
Islands besides two of considerable Extent both of which appear to
afford shelter for a Ship; they appear to be full of People &amp;
are apart of those Islands named by Capt. Carteret Admiralty
Islands; He passed to the So.ward of the large Island &amp; did not
see those which we sailed through in passing to the No.ward.</p>

<p>Wednesday 3rd. AM Saw 3 Islands through which passed &amp; by
Angles taken &amp; the Ships run I fix them in
1°:33'So...145°:34'Et. &mdash; 0°:51'So...146°:17'Et. &amp;
0°:44'So.. 145°:54'Et. they appear'd high but of no considerable
extent.</p>

<p>Monday. 6th. Cross'd the Line in 144°:48'Et. Longitude Varn. Of
the Compass 5°:00'Etly.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jul91" id="jul91"></a>July 1791</p>

<p>From this time to the 12th of July we had variable light breezes
&amp; a strong Et.erly Current which we found by Lunar Observations
had set the Ship 10 Deg 21 Min to the Et.ward of the Log in that
time sometimes going at the Rate of 40 Miles pr.day &amp; at other
times less, this very unfavourable circumstance &amp; with every
prospect of its continuance, occasioned a</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 269]</p>

<p>Consultation to determine what was best to be done; It was the
general opinion that it was absolutely necessary that we should
make the best of our way to Macao in China circumstanced as we were
with respect to Provisions which as now become very short, the Wind
being at SW We bore away on the 13th &amp; steer'd to the No.ward:
AM At 9. Saw Land, it appear'd to be an Island brg. NbW soon after,
we saw 2 other Islands to the NWbN; As we approach'd the first, we
found that they were all three connected by a Reef &amp; dry sand
bank extending 7 Miles in nearly a WNW direction &amp; 3 Miles in
breadth the Et.most of these woody patches which at first appear'd
to be seperate Islands is about a Mile in length &amp; lies in
8°:06'No...140°:30'Et. deduced from Lunar Observations taken two
days before &amp; 2 days after;</p>

<p>The two Wt.most patches are very small &amp; close together
&amp; lie in 8°:08'No. ..140°:23'Et. It breaks very heavy upon the
Sand all round, except just to the Et.ward of the two woody patches
on the No.side of the Sand, where there appears to be a small
opening; We passed the Et. pt. of this Island at about 3 Miles
distant, Saw several of the Natives come out of the wood to the
beach but did not see any of their Canoes or Habitations, We had an
amazing number of Birds &amp; fish about the Ship &amp; many
Bonettas were caught.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 270]</p>

<p>Thursday.14th:The wind hauling round to the Et. &amp; No.ward we
could not pass to the Et.ward of a Group of the New Carolines which
were near, we therefore run close along to the So.ward of them, but
it being thick rainy weather we did not see any of them 'till the
18th when we discover'd Land &amp; which proved to the Et. West
most of the Caroline Islands At Noon they were seen to be 3 Islands
&amp; a rock above water the No.part of the middle Island which is
the largest &amp; has some high Land upon it lies in 9°:35'N.
..137°:39'Et. by Obsn. of the Moon &amp; [stars] at 10 the
following evening, they are well cover'd with Trees of which we had
but an imperfect sight as we passed at 19 Miles distance from the
nearest;</p>

<p>At ½ pt. 4 when the largest Island bore S13°W pr. Compass 24
Miles we came suddenly over a ledge of Rocks, saw the bottom very
plain &amp; had 15 fm. but I think we were in less water before the
lead was hove, this ledge appear'd to extend to a considerable
distance both to the No. &amp; So. of us in a NbE &amp; SbW
direction, we stood on our Course NWbW &amp; in about 10 minutes
had no Soundings, I suppose it to be 2 or 3 Cables length in
breadth &amp; every appearance of deep water round it, there was a
considerable Swell &amp; had it communicated with the Islands in
sight, I think we should have seen breakers between us &amp; the
Shore, of which there was no appearance all round; These Islands
are called Ladda in the Old Charts</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 271]</p>

<p>&amp; are to SW of the Groups called the New Carolines. It was
now judged more elligible to alter our route &amp; instead of going
to Macao, to go for the Port of Manilla; we accordingly shaped a
Course for Cape Espintu Sancto at the entrance of the Channel
leading to it; the wind favour'd us 'till Sunday the 24th in Latd.
11°:57'No. ..131°:27'Et., when it came to the No.ward &amp; then
round to the Wt.ward wt. Squally Wtr.</p>

<p>The 26th. It increased to a strong Gale with which we kept on
the Tack that would keep us most in with the Land, the Gale blew
with great violence 'till the 29th with very heavy Squalls; The
weather clear'd up with SSW wind &amp; continued with moderate
weather &amp; a few Squalls between SSW &amp; West of which changes
we took every advantage, to get in with the Land.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="aug91" id="aug91"></a>August 1791</p>

<p>On the 3rd. of August we found that the Observation gave a
degree to the So.ward of the Log for the last two days &amp; we saw
the looming of the Land to the Wt.ward;</p>

<p>We were in this situation 45 leagues from Cape St.Espintu Sancto
brg. N70°W of us, the wind settled at SSW &amp; SW blowing a steady
fresh Gale, &amp; altho' the streight leading to the Port of
Manilla was to leeward of us &amp; at so short a distance, It was
now determined to beat to Windward along the Et. side of St. Johns
&amp; Mindanao &amp; make the passage through the streight of
Macassar, which had before been deem'd Impracticable [...] at
the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 272]</p>

<p>time that Macao as first determined on. As we came near the East
Cost of the Phillipine Islands found a Strong So.erly Current which
set from 25 to 50 Miles pr.day, wind So. &amp; SW: Thursday 4th
August, Saw Land to the WSW but at too great a distance to
ascertain what part it was; We had variable light airs &amp; Calm
all night, At daylight Saw the Land again to WSW of considerable
extent, We stood in WbN, I take the N.most part of this Land to be
the N or NE Point of the Island of St. John, stretching out to the
No.ward in a low point from very high Land;</p>

<p>This Pt. by our Observations is in 9°:30'No. ..126°:30'Et. which
situation nearly corresponds with the Dutch Est. India Directory
but not with ours; We continue to work to the So.ward with great
success the Current setting more than 1 Knot pr. hour to the
So.ward; the Weather was hazey &amp; clouds hanging heavy over the
Land prevented our having a good view of it &amp; ascertaining any
of the projecting Points or Bays that may be there; A few miles to
the So.ward of the NE Pt. of St.Johns is the appearance of an
Island laying near the Shore &amp; shelter behind it.</p>

<p>Saturday.6th. Had some good Observations of the [sun] &amp;
[moon] from which &amp; the Latitude at Noon I fix the situation of
a projecting Pt. running out to the No.ward &amp; appear'd to form
a Bay behind it. 7°:41'No. ..126°:28'Et. we were abreast of it at 6
leagues distance, the No. extreme of Land then in sight</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 273]</p>

<p>bore NNW a low point; &amp; the other Extreme SbW, High
Land.</p>

<p>Sunday. 7th. Clouds hung so heavy over the Land that it could
not be distinctly seen, wind from the SbE to SW found the Current
had set us 51 Miles to windward these 24 Hours; At Noon Could just
discern the Land through the Haze to the WSW.</p>

<p>Monday. 8th. Stood off to the SE 'till 8 P.M, then Tack'd &amp;
stood to the Wt.ward &amp; at 6 AM Saw an Island with a remarkable
Peak on it &amp; low land to the Wt.ward: At Noon it bore ESE 7
leagues from which I make its situation 5°:33'No. Latd. &amp;
Longd. by Ships Run from [sun] &amp; [moon] yesterday 126°:35'Et.:
Suppose it to be the Island called Palmas in the Old Charts: found
the Current had set us 32 Miles to the So.ward these 24 hours.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 9th. AM. Saw Land to the WNW, we had light breezes from
SSW to WSW , At Daylight Saw the South Pt. of Mindanao &amp; the
Islands laying off to the So.ward of it, the SE Point then bore
N2°W 9 leagues, had very good observations of the [sun] &amp;
[moon] in the afternoon &amp; of the [stars] on the opposite side
in the evening; I fix the SE Pt. of Mindanao (or middle Pt. between
that So. Pt &amp; Cape St.Augustine) in 6°:00'No. .. 125°:49'Et.
&amp; Cape St.Augustine from Capt Carterets run 6°:12'No.
126°:30'Et. We did not find any Current these 24 hours; the Land of
the So.Coast of Mindanao is very high, running down to those parts
which appear to be projecting points &amp; terminating in Land of
moderate height.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 10th: Modt. Breezes wt. fair weather, Wind
So.erly</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 274]</p>

<p>we gained but little to the Wt.ward: AM At 9 finding that we
could weather the Islands, we bore away for a passage between the
two Et.most of them, but on seeing breakers in the passage we stood
back till the Boat was got out &amp; went ahead when we followed
her through.</p>

<p>Thursday. 11th: Found the Passage a very good &amp; safe one,
the Reefs on both sides shewing themselves &amp; the depth of water
20 to 13 fathom, Rocky near the Reef &amp; muddy in the Channel
through which we passed, there is a reef laying some distance off
the Et. side of the middle Island along parallel to the shore which
being near the Surface always shews itself: There is also a Reef
laying ½ Mile or more from the Et.most of the Islands running out
to the ENE from it, the Sea breaks very heavy on it &amp; some of
the Rocks are above water: several of the Natives appear'd on the
Middle Island &amp; retired as we approach'd.</p>

<p>We stood tothe Westward &amp; Tack'd occasionally as the Wind
favored most; About 5PM Standing over for the largest of these
Islands called by Capt. Carteret Hummock Island, Saw 2 Canoes or
Boats coming towards us, with white Flags which was answer'd by our
hoisting a White Flag at the Ensign Staff; One of them a Canoe came
alongside before dark, asked many questions concerning the Vessel
her destination &amp; informed us that the Raja lived on the So.
side of the largest Island which they call Loorongo:</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 275]</p>

<p>&amp; that He was appointed; by the Dutch Et.India Company; from
Ternate to Govern at these Islands, the Dutch having establish'd a
Trade with them &amp; that their small Vessels frequently came wt.
Trade from Ternate an Island to on the Wt. side of Gilolo where the
Dutch have a Settlement. They asked for a paper, with the Ships
name, Captains name, where Bound to &amp;c. for the Raja, which was
given to them &amp; they went away well satisfied. Having Malays on
bd. &amp; a Native of Ternate we understood each other perfectly by
Conversation, they were most.ly of them cloth'd with Jackets
Trowsers &amp;c. &amp; armed with a Cress or long Dagger;</p>

<p>About 8 O'Clock the others who were in a large Boat came close
up under the Stern, ask'd many questions, said that they had things
to sell, but that it being dark they would not dispose of any until
the morning, they said that they would shew us a good Anchoring
place &amp; left us, steering over for the Middle Island where we
should have followed had not the Wind prevented us; We therefore
stood over towards Hummock Isl. or Loorongo in hopes of getting
good Anchorage there, when with 1 ½ or 2 Miles of the Shore got
Soundings, 80 fm. &amp; at Noon Came too in 25 fm. Sand &amp;
Shells about ¾ of a Mile from the Shore abreast of us on the NE.

<p>No.most of the 3 Islands N37°E: The So.Coast of Mindanao from
N40°W to N26°E about 5 leagues distance: Soon after we anchored,
several of the Natives came on board, appear'd very well disposed
&amp; traded very fairly; Most of them had Cresses by their
sides.</p>

<p>Friday 12th. P.M: A Boat with some people of consequence came
off with a Dutch Flag flying; they brought an answer to the Letter
sent to the Raja last night &amp; which mention'd that we could get
Wood &amp; Water; Goats, Poultry &amp;c. but that they had but
little Rice or Paddy to spare, they also brought on board what they
called a Pass dated. 1791 from the Dutch Company, Authorising the
Raja to Govern these Islands &amp; the Vessels trading here from
Ternate; Several of the Natives came on board but few articles were
purchased this afternoon;</p>

<p>The Boats were sent for a turn of Water &amp; returned before
dark with a Raft of 14 Casks they found it a very good watering
place &amp; convenient except just at low water when the Reef dries
some distance off, the Natives shew'd where to fill the Water &amp;
then retired. AM. Soon after Sunrise several of the Natives came
off bringing many useful necessaries to Trade with us, Poultry,
Sago, Tobacco, Honey, Wax, Sugar Cane &amp; various fruits were
exchanged for Cloath, Iron, Buttons, Knives &amp;c. in all which
they</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 277]</p>

<p>dealt very fairly &amp; honestly; Watering went on very well:
Many of the Natives brought fruit &amp;c. to Trade to the watering
place &amp; exchanged with out People for what things they had to
give them; Our Party on shore were not armed any part of the
time.</p>

<p>Saturday.13th. The Raja came on board; He was saluted with 3
Guns as was the second in Command when He came; &amp; on their
leaving the Ship they were saluted by with a Volley of Small Arms
from the Poop; An Armed Party having been previously station'd
there in case these People might shew any hostile intentions which
not appearing in the smallest degree the Musquets were discharged
as a Salute:</p>

<p>The Raja promised to come the next day &amp; bring a sufficient
quantity of Rice &amp; Paddy for all our People, He had a present
of a Peice of Silk given him by the Master of the Vessel: He was on
board about an hour in the course of which time he shew'd a Paper
signed by Capt. Vanholm, Commodore of the States Ships then
employed in India, appointing him the King of these Islands, Many
useful necessaries were procured this day &amp; 10 Bags of Paddy on
the Publick account. AM At daylight when the Boat was towing a Raft
of Casks on shore it came on to blow very fresh from the WSW by
which several of Casks were lost &amp; we were prevented from
Compleating our water.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 278]</p>

<p>Sunday.14th: PM. It continuing to blow fresh from the WSW it was
judged necessary to go the Sea before night with what water &amp;
refreshments we had procured; About 5 O'Clock the Raja came on
board according to his promise, but instead of bringing the
articles he mention'd yesterday; He only brought 20lb of Rice, On
which the Commander of the Vessel remonstrated &amp; told him that
he had broke his word &amp; I have reason to think threaten'd him
with Confinement until those things were brought, He having
declared that to be his intentions, but as their Conversation was
in the Malay language, what passed could not be well understood by
us farther than by their actions;</p>

<p>The instant Words arose which I supposed to be threats, An Old
Man who stood near drew his Cress &amp; would have immediately
stabb'd the Commander of the Vessel had not the Raja prevented him;
the Raja then went to the Ships side where his Boat was, &amp;
several of his People coming in with their Cresses drawn, He made a
stand as if he meant an attack, but by this time several of the
Officers were armed &amp; all hands coming aft with handpikes,
Capston Bars &amp;c. they made a very precipitate retreat throwing
themselves over the quarter into their Boat &amp; some into the
water, they immediately cut the Boat adrift, the Raja himself after
throwing a Spear into</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 279]</p>

<p>the Ship took an Oar to endeavour to get the Boat away from us;
She was scarce astern of us when a Strong Party was collected on
the Poop at Small Arms, who kept up a very smart fire on them for
some time; Every ball going through their awning of Slit Bamboo
into the Boat, great execution must have been done the whole of
them except the Raja &amp; one man being in the body of the Boat,
some were seen to fall in attempting to get to the Oars &amp; we
have great reason to think that the Raja fell at one of the
Oars.</p>

<p>Some Great Guns were fired when they had got a little dis'ce.
off but only the Grape shot struck the Boat, the round shot going
over her; The Boat belonging to the Ship was at this time returning
from the Shore with some Goats &amp; other articles which one of
the Natives of some consequence had sent off as a present;</p>

<p>Our watering party were luckily all on board, but unfortunately
one of the Malays who had been left to take care of some Casks that
had drifted on shore was not thought of 'till it was too late, as
there was a necessity for our going to Sea immediately, Night
coming on, the Ship having drove close to a Reef &amp; the lee tide
nearly made against us &amp; which would set us over the Reef &amp;
only one little Boat that we could have sent to the shore. We
weigh'd &amp; stood out to the Et.ward about 8 O'Clock.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 280]</p>

<p>The road in which we anchored is shelter'd from the NE to the
So.ward &amp; Wt.ward to West, by the Pt. of the Island Loorongo
&amp; those laying near it, the bottom does not appear to be good
holding ground as we drove without any Sea setting in upon us;
There is every appearance of good shelter in deep Coves along the
West side of the Middle Island, as also of as clear passage out
from thence to the So.ward but for want of a Boat we could not
ascertain either;</p>

<p>These Islands afford plenty of Goats, Poultry Sago, Yams, Sweet
Potatoes, Honey &amp; Wax in great quantities, Tobacco, Sugar Cane
exceedingly large &amp; fine &amp; all the Fruits usually found
between the Tropics, We saw some Nutmegs, but whether they got them
from the Dutch or were the produce of the Island we could not
learn; they have Turtle about these Islands the Shell of which is
an Article of Commerce: A Ship might get every refreshment here
provided a friendly intercourse with the Natives could be
establish'd.</p>

<p>Our Anchorage lies in 5°:26'N &amp; 125°:12'Et. from as mean of
50 Observations of the [moon] &amp; [stars] on each side of her,
from which &amp; the Bearings taken, I make the So. Point of
Mindanao to lie in 5°:40'N &amp; 125°:08'Et: The Hummock on Hummock
Island or Loorongo 5°:23'No...125°:09'Et. &amp; the small Islands
the No.most of the three 5°:36'N. .. 125°:21'E.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 281]</p>

<p>Variation of the Compass 1°:00' Et.</p>

<p>Monday.15th. Wind SW to So. Passed 5 Islands to the Wt.ward of
us, &amp; saw more to the SW &amp; one very large one to the SSW
before night; between those two of the Islands first seen there
appear'd to be a Reef; but the distance we passed from the others
prevented our being able to see whether they had any dangers about
them; We had but little wind all night &amp; at day light found
that the Current had set us close up the Islands &amp; Rocks laying
about to the NW &amp; NE of the large Island:</p>

<p>About 11 We were set close in between two of the Islands,
Hoisted a Boat &amp; sent her to examine the passage &amp; if they
found it clear they were order'd to go on to the Small Island &amp;
try if any thing was to be got there; We had drifted considerably
within this Island when a fresh breeze spring up Made Signal for
the Boat, she returned without having landed but was near enough to
see several Natives on the beach &amp; that the Island was cover'd
with Cocoa Nut &amp; Plantain Trees &amp; had the appearance of a
litt le Garden: Sounded 70fm. Sand.</p>

<p>Tuesday.16th. P.M: We had just got without this Passage again
when it Calm we were carried along by the Current to the Wt.ward
close along by the other small Islands &amp; had no Soundings,
about 12 the Land wind came off with which we stood clear out to
Sea between the NW Pt of Po.Sanguy, &amp; an Island laying about 9
Miles to the No.ward of it: These Islands being</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 282]</p>

<p>cover'd with Cocoa Nuts &amp; Plantains have a beautiful
appearance; We saw some Canoes fishing but they did not regard us.
In passing from Loorongo to Po.Sanguy we found a Chain of small
Islands all in sight of each other, the Situation of those that se
saw are as follows:</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p>We had light breezes cheifly from SSE to SW &amp; having clear
weather &amp; good Observation every day for the Longitude were
able to determine our situation very near &amp; found a little
westerly Current: We pass'd a great quantity of drift wood &amp;
some very large Trees.</p>

<p>Thursday.25th: Saw the Land &amp; at Noon the NW Point of
Celebes bore SbE 11 leagues: the Wind when we had any was cheifly
from the SW, we had much Calm &amp; made but little progress, It
was not 'till the 28th that we brought the NW Pt. of Celebes to
bear East of us, we then began to feel a Southerly Current tho' not
very strong &amp; consider'd</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 283]</p>

<p>ourselves as then entering the Streights of Macassar. From our
Situation at Noon the last 4 days &amp; the bearings taken I make
the NW Point of Celebes to lie in 1°:19'N &amp; 121deg;:02'Et: And
another Point to the So. &amp; Wt. of it &amp; which has much the
appearance of an Island 1°:09'N. .. 120°:35'Et. We found the
Variation of the Compass so trifling, that the Compass would
sometimes give five a few Miles Et. &amp; sometimes Wt.</p>

<p>Monday.29th: A Fresh breeze Sprung up from the SSW with which we
stood over f towards the Borneo shore; the wind continued steady
till 4 AM when it shifted to the Wt.ward in a heavy &amp; sudden
squall; blew Strong for about an hour &amp; then settled in a
moderate breeze at WSW: from which Qt. we have mostly found the
winds prevail even so far to the Et.ward as the New Carolines.</p>

<p>30th at 6 PM Saw the Et. Coast of Borneo bearing WSW 12 leagues
&amp; the Taba Island (the So.most) WNW 4 leags. We had then run 93
Miles from the NW Pt. of Celebes on nearly a West Course, which
differs considerably from Capt. Carterets run in the Swallow, At.
10 AM Saw both shores being then in Latitude 1°:00'N &amp; which I
take to be the narrowest part of the streight &amp; which by
Observations &amp; bearings taken I make 70 Miles: The Mountains
shew on both sides before you see the Land of the Sea Coast; the
Wind when we had any was cheifly from the So. to SW &amp; sometimes
light Land winds for a few hours from the Celebes shore.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 284]</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="sep91" id="sep91"></a>September
1791</p>

<p>We cross'd the Line Sepr. 2nd. In Longitude 119°:25'Et. at 13
Miles distance from an Island laying under the Line &amp; close to
the Celebes shore, having Light airs &amp; Calm we made very little
progress. On the 7th at Noon Saw a Point on the Celebes shore
bearing East 8 leagues which was the So.most part of it that we saw
&amp; lies in 1°:47'So. .. 119°:19'Et. by Observation.</p>

<p>The 9th: Standing over towards Borneo, at day light saw breakers
to the SWbW &amp; an Island behind them; At Noon the Island bore
WSW &amp; was seen over a range of very heavy breakers, with some
rocks shewing above water, which I take to be the NE part of the
shoals &amp; from which we were then 3 Miles: That part lays in
Latde. 2°:57'So. .. 117°:57'Et. We could not ascertain the
situation of the Island not knowing the distance it was at the back
of the reef; It appear'd to be surrounded with very dangerous
shoals extending some Miles both to the NW &amp; SE of that part to
which we were nearest: We had 35 fm. sandy bottom 12 Miles to the
NEbE of them.</p>

<p>They are call'd the Triangles in the Dutch Chart, but no notice
seems to be taken of them in ours, unless they are there called the
little Pater Nosters &amp; then they are very erroneously placed:
We cross'd the whole of their extent in Latitude in the day time
2°:15' to 2°: 31' So. as given by Capt Carteret at the distance of
10 to 18 leagues from the Celebes Shore with seeing any thing &amp;
run between 80 &amp; 90 Miles</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 284]</p>

<p>We cross'd the Line Sepr. 2nd. In Longitude 119°:25'Et. at 13
Miles distance from an Island laying under the Line &amp; close to
the Celebes shore, having Light airs &amp; Calm we made very little
progress. On the 7th at Noon Saw a Point on the Celebes shore
bearing East 8 leagues which was the So.most part of it that we saw
&amp; lies in 1°:47'So. .. 119°:19'Et. by Observation.</p>

<p>The 9th: Standing over towards Borneo, at day light saw breakers
to the SWbW &amp; an Island behind them; At Noon the Island bore
WSW &amp; was seen over a range of very heavy breakers, with some
rocks shewing above water, which I take to be the NE part of the
shoals &amp; from which we were then 3 Miles: That part lays in
Latde. 2°:57'So. .. 117°:57'Et. We could not ascertain the
situation of the Island not knowing the distance it was at the back
of the reef; It appear'd to be surrounded with very dangerous
shoals extending some Miles both to the NW &amp; SE of that part to
which we were nearest:</p>

<p>We had 35 fm. sandy bottom 12 Miles to the NEbE of them. They

2°:15' to 2°: 31' So. as given by Capt Carteret at the distance of
10 to 18 leagues from the Celebes Shore with seeing any thing &amp;
run between 80 &amp; 90 Miles</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 286]</p>

<p>Being only a low Sand Bank of small extent It lies in 3°:35'So.
.. 1187deg;:01'Et. by [moon] &amp; [stars] &amp; bears from the
Triangles So.6°E 38 Miles: AM. At daylight saw Land bearing WSW½W 3
leags. which we soon discovered to be some small Islands called the
Brothers, laying off the large Island Po. Laudt on the SE end of
Borneo, they bear from the shoal S84°W 59 Miles: After passing the
Spit to the So.ward of the Sand bank we had 22 &amp; 20 fm. Sand
&amp; Mud all across to the Brothers &amp; 17 when within 3 Miles
of them, they are in 3°:41'So. .. 117°:02'Et.</p>

<p>Monday.12th. We found that the swell &amp; a strong indraught
between Po. Laudt &amp; Borneo carry the Ship in upon the shore
that laying up SWbS we could not clear the land; We stood into 12
fm. &amp; then stretch'd off in hopes of getting out to the Et.ward
of the Brothers again, which we could not accomplish 'till the
13th. in the AM, At Noon on which day they bore WSW 16 Miles so
that we were again carried into the Streight after having supposed
ourselves clear.</p>

<p>While between the Brothers &amp; Borneo we found the sounding
very regular from 20 to 12 fm. blue mud; at the dist. of 7 to 2
leagues from the shore. The Shore of Borneo appear'd low &amp;
woody with many openings &amp; some Islands laying off between Po.
Laudt &amp; Borneo; there is a hill which shews over the lowland
&amp; is the only high land that we saw between Po. Laudt &amp; a
projecting point which we take to be</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 287]</p>

<p>the South Pt. of Borneo &amp; it is a low woody Point; We saw
Land without it to the SW which appear'd to us to be Islands, on
one of which is two Mountains or very high hills exactly resembling
each other, this was supposed by some to be the South Pt. of
Borneo; I think it doubtful which of the two is the So.Pt. this
last mentioned in Lat: 4°:14'So. 116°:20'Et. or the low Woody Pt.
beforementioned in 3deg;:59'So. .. 116°:34'Et.</p>

<p>The 14th &amp; 15th: We endeavor'd to work up to the SW but lost
ground the wind inclining to the Wt.ward of So. &amp; a great swell
running in upon the shore; We were then under a necessity of
stretching out to the Et.ward as the only chance of getting far
enough to the So.ward to weather the Brothers of So. part of
Borneo; We fell to the No.ward of the sand bank Zeelandt &amp; at 8
AM the 17th saw it bearing WbS 5 or 6 Mile, from which I judge that
we passed to the No.ward of it in the night at 5 or 6 Miles disce.
making an EbN or ENE½E Course from the Brothers &amp; had from 17
to 25 fm. across &amp; 28 to 30 passing along to the Et.ward of it
at 4 ½ Miles distance, the wind favoring us we stretch'd to the
So.ward &amp; had 30 fm. at Noon the Sand Bank bearing NbE. 12
Miles.</p>

<p>It is very low &amp; appears to be just a heap of sand, we did
not see any thing like a bush upon it &amp; cannot be seen more
than 6 or 7 Mile from a Ship's deck: There appears to be good
soundings to it on all sides except the So. off which runs the Spit
that</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 288]</p>

<p>we pass'd over; &amp; from the Rocks that we then saw laying on
the bottom &amp; the irregular soundings, I think the South side
should be passed with great caution &amp; not within 7 Miles. We
were just a week from having pass'd it the first time &amp; found
the situation we had then fixed it in, to correspond with our run
this time from the Brothers &amp; which is settled by several Lunar
Observations.</p>

<p>Sunday. 18th. At Noon, In Latitude 4°:03'So. &amp; 117°:48'Et. I
consider ourselves clear of the Streight of Macasser in which we
were 24 days from making the NW Pt. of Celebes. I would not by any
means recommend this passage for Ships bound to the Wt.ward, the SW
wind being so prevalent all through &amp; indeed we found them at
times as far to the Et.ward as St.George Channel &amp; after
passing through it we were forced to the No.ward of the Admiralty
Islands by SW winds &amp; after laying more than 4 weeks becalm'd
&amp; swept away to the Et.ward by a Current, the SW wind again
prevail'd with which we stood to the No.ward , had the easterly
trade for a day or two in 9°Latd.No. &amp; then found the SW
Monsoon meet us again along to the So.ward of the New Carolines,
Coast of Mindanao &amp; through the Streight of Macasser. We saw
many Proas, all of which appear'd to be for Plunder as they never
kept a steady Course as if bound on any Trade.</p>

Batavia. 24 Sepr 1791. Waakzamheydt'</p>

<p>which we suppose to be Little Po. Laudt, we saw as large &amp; a
small Island, the SE Part of which is in 4°:53'So. ..116°:16'Et..
We passed to the So.ward of them &amp; had 25 fm. Muddy bottom:</p>

<p>Wednesday. 21st.: At 12 PM. Saw Solombo NNW 3 or 4 Miles, the
Soundings between little Po. Laudt &amp; it were from 25, 28, 20,
18 &amp; 16 when abreast of Solombo &amp; soon after we pass'd it
32. I make the So. side of Solombo 5°:41'So. ..114°:14'Et. by [sun]
&amp; [moon].</p>

<p>Friday.23rd: At 6.AM Saw Carimon Java brg. West 6 or 7 leagues.
We passed to the So.ward of them at 4 or 5 leagues distance:
Carimon Java appears to be a large Island with 2 rem'ble hills upon
it, with several small Islands laying off both to the Et.ward &amp;
Wt.ward &amp; several rocks above water scatter'd about the
Islands: The Latitude of the middle of the So. side of the large
Island is 5°:51'So. &amp; Longitude 110°:35'Et. they are several
Miles in Circuit.</p>

<p>Saturday. 24th. AM Soon after Sunrise a very sudden change in
the weather (which was clear &amp; serene) took place Clouds came
very fast from over the Land with several whirlwinds pools all
about, two of which pass'd very near the Vessel, these</p>

<p>were succeeded by tremendous Water Spouts which drove the Water
up as high as our lower Mast heads in a foam all round them &amp;
making a rapid progress along the Water, two of these came very
near us at which we fired 2 Shot, without effect; they pass'd clear
to leeward</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 291]</p>

<p>&amp; in half an hour afterwards dispersed, when the weather
clear'd up again.</p>

<p>Sunday. 25th. At 5PM. Saw the land of Java WbS &amp; the
Boomkins NW 9 or 10 Miles: They are two low Islands laying about
NNW &amp; SSE of each other cover'd with Trees; there is a Reef
laying off to the No.ward of them on which is some rocks above
water. We pass'd 8 Miles to the So.ward of the innermost: the
middle of the So. side of which is in 5°:55'No. Longde.
..108°:37'Et.</p>

<p>From Solombo to Carimon Java, is S87°:23'W ...........219
Miles<br>
Carimon Java to the Boomkins S88°:40'W ...........118<br>
Boomkins to Carawary Pt. S86°:42'W ........... 87.<br>
By our Observations the Boomkins appear to be much misplaced in the
Directory, as are Solombo &amp; Carimon Java with respect to
Latitude.</p>

<p>Monday. 26th. Pass'd several Ships &amp; Vessels working along
shore to the Et.ward, at Sunset, saw Carawary Pt. S.55°W 4 or 5
leags. the Pt. next to the Et.ward of Carawang Pt. has some
remarkable Trees on it which look like Ships at an Anchor &amp; is
a very good mark coming from the Et.ward along the Coast of Java to
know when you are near Carawary Pt.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 27th: At 5PM. Anchored in Batavia Road in 3 fm. found
several Dutch Indiamen, 2 French Ships &amp; an English Snow
belonging to Bombay laying there. Edam. N17°E Onrust N46°W. Church
at Batavia S12°E 1 Mile from the shore.</p>

<p class="caption">28a. 'Batavia'<br>
28b. 'Onrust in Batavia Bay'</p>

<p>We were 26 weeks from Port Jackson &amp; arrived with the whole
Ships Company in good health. By the Commander of the English Snow
we heard of the War in India &amp; of the Fleet fitted out in
consequence of the dispute with Spain, of the Great Naval Promotion
&amp; that the Gorgon with the Lt.Governor for New South Wales
&amp; the other Ships for Port Jackson were at the Cape of Good
Hope in August last.</p>

<p>Thursday. 29th: The Vessel went to Onrust to be refitted for the
Voyage to Europe: &amp; returned to Europe Batavia the 12th October
on which day a Squadron of Dutch Men of War arrived.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="oct91" id="oct91"></a>October.
1791</p>

<p>Saturday. 15th Octr. The Dutch Master of the Waakzaamheyd was
turn'd out of her for Insolent &amp; other improper behaviour
behaviour &amp; his Crew all previously discharged agreeable to the
Contract made between him &amp; Governor Phillip, the English
Colours &amp; Pendant were hoisted the Ship being left to the
direction of Capt. Hunter We had hitherto continued healthy but now
began to feel the effects of the Climate which is certainly one of
the worst in the World &amp; had been particularly so these last 2
years the number which have died at Batavia in that time is
incredible &amp; not to be ascertain'd with certainty. At Onrust
which may be consider'd their Dockyard where they heave their Ships
down &amp;</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 293]</p>

<p>repair all defects they have now only 200 Carpenters &amp; other
artificers &amp; Labourers left out of 2000 which were employed
there 2 years ago, that they have lost 1800 on the Island, besides
the Supplies of some few which every Indiaman from Holland brings
out with them for that purpose the Master Carpenter told me, that
He was one of the only 5 European Carpenters left alive there: We
were told at Batavia on our arrival that the sickness was just then
inconsiderable to what it had been &amp; from what our Officers
saw, who lived ashore at Batavia the Mortall )ity was then very
great.</p>

<p>Thursday. 20th: AM Sailed from Batavia Road but having some
Stores to take in at Onrust we anchor'd there about Noon &amp; on
the 22nd. At daylight Sailed &amp; stood out to the Wt.ward between
Middleburg &amp; Ontory Java; not being able to weather the shoal
point off Man Eaters Island. We anchored at Noon in 4 ½ fm. Sand
&amp; Mud the Beacon on the Spit brg. SWbW ½ Mile &amp; Maneaters
Island WSW; Sent the Master to examine the Channel, found it a very
good one; We found the Shoals had marks on them, but some being
beacons, &amp; others Buoys we were sometimes a little at a loss
but pass'd very well through by a Dutch Chart which we got at
Batavia; the next morning we weigh'd &amp; stood to the Wt.ward
with the Land Wind between Pulo</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 294]</p>

<p>Pulo Baby &amp; Bantam Point: but not being able to weather
St.Nicholas Pt. when the Sea breeze came in we anchored off it in
22 fm. The Pt. bearing WSW 2 Miles. While at anchor we found a
strong Wt.ly current &amp; at day light weigh'd again, working to
the SW through the Streight of Sunda.</p>

<p>Tuesday 25th: PM. Spoke an English Ship from Bombay, bound to
Batavia; by Her we heard that all was Peace in Europe: A Dutch Boat
came on board soon after from Anger Point, with Turtle &amp;c. to
sell, there was a Dutchman in her who brought a book to take an
account of the Ships name &amp;c.: By examining this Book for
English Ships that might have pass'd the Streight lately; we found
that the Leopard Capt. Blankett with a small Squadron &amp; Convoy
from China amongst which were the 5 Ships from Port Jackson has
pass'd this Streight in April last. The wind fixing at SSE we
continued to work to windward through the Streight which we clear'd
the 26th. having Java Head E½S 8 or 9 Leagues: At 6 AM. The 26th.
the Weather became Squally with rain &amp; continued so till the
30th. in 10°So. Latde. When the SE trade appear'd to be fixed &amp;
blew a steady Fresh Gale.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="nov91" id="nov91"></a>November
1791</p>

<p>Tuesday. 1 Novr. At 3PM. Saw Cocos or Keelings Islands from N8°W
to N35°W about 5 leagues distance: At 4 the Middle of them No. 5
leagues from which I fix the situation of the So. side of those
Islands 12°:03'So. &amp; 98°:20'Et. by our account</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 295]</p>

<p>from Java Head: There are 3 distinct Islands &amp; some Rocks
above water with very heavy breakers all about them, they extend
about 3 leagues Et. &amp; Wt. are very dangerous being so very low,
that they cannot be seen more than 5 leagues: We find their
Longitude nearly the same as given by Capt. Hudson in Herberts East
India Directory but differ in Latde. 13 Miles, Probably he may have
pass'd to the No.ward of them &amp; given the Latitude of the No.
side of them &amp; it being hazey when our Observation was taken
there might be an error of 2 or 3 Miles in that: We could not
ascertain their extent No. &amp; So.. The SE Trade continued till
the 20th November between EbS &amp; SSE sometimes light &amp;
sometimes Squally, but in general a steady Fresh Gale &amp; fair
weather: On the 28th. it became rather variable but cheifly from
the NE to the SE &amp; So.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="dec91" id="dec91"></a>December
1791</p>

<p>December 14th. At 4 AM. In Latde. 35°:53'So. Longde. 21°:59'Et.
got soundings 70 fm. Sand &amp; Mud, Cape Lagullas then bearing
N51°:45'W true brg. 36 leagues &amp; had 27 ½°;Wt. variation, from
which situation we steer'd NWbW pr. Compass 24 Miles, NW 22 &amp;
had 53 fm. Sand &amp; Stones, then NbW 26 &amp; had 60 fm. coarse
sand &amp; stones then NbW 26 and had 60 fm. coarse sand &amp;
broken shells: We then hauled in NNE at 5 AM the 15th &amp; after
running 10 Miles saw the Land from NNW to NNE off shore 6 or 7
leagues. We then steer'd NW 20 Miles inclining in with the Land to
Noon at which time we knew to be Cape Lagulhas &amp; bore NbW by
Compass 4 leagues &amp; which by Observation I make in Lat</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 296]</p>

<p>34°:46'So. from which &amp; taking its Longitude 20°:15'Et. of
Greenw'h. the situation of the Ship at 4AM the 14th is reduced back
by the Log. Cape Lagulhas (the most So.ern part of the Land forming
it) is a low Sandy Point, the land moderately high behind it &amp;
coming from the SE has much the appearance of being a sandy beach
in a bend of the Coast which falls in a bight to the NE round it
but as you come near the shore makes in a projecting Point &amp; is
the most So.ern point of the whole Coast. It may also be known by
the Gunners Quoin which is a high hill about 4 leagues to the
Wt.ward of it much resembling the Bill of Portland when to the
Et.ward of Wt.wd. of it, but loses its remarkable appearance when
abreast of it. For a considerable distance both to the Et. &amp;
Wt.ward of Cape Laghulas at the distance of 4 leagues from the
Shore the water was of a green muddy colour &amp; appear'd to be
shoal, but as we did not heave the lead, can only judge from the
appearance.</p>

<p>16th. Decr. At 8 AM Pass'd the Cape of Good Hope at 7 or 8 Miles
distance with a fresh Gale at SE: Saw the Bellows break very
high.</p>

<p>Saturday. 17th. PM. Standing in for Table Bay, met the SE wind
out of the Bay so strong that it obliged us to Anchor 2 Miles to
the No.ward of the proper Anchorage. We saw</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 297]</p>

<p>an English Ship of War &amp; Brig in the Road: A Boat from the
Ship soon informed us that it was the Providence Sloop &amp;
Assistant Brig going to the Society Islands for the Bread fruit
plants. The Providence commanded by Capt. Bligh who soon after his
return to England when forced away from the Bounty, was made Port
Captain &amp; these Vessels fitted out for the same Voyage. We
found also that the Pitt Indiaman was in the Road bound to New
South Wales. She had on board Major Grosse the New Lieut.Governor
of that Territory with part of his Corp. &amp; Men &amp; Women
Convicts. By meeting with these Ships we got accounts from England
to the latter end of July which in our situation was very
Interesting. We found heard that the Gorgon had sailed from the
Cape last July &amp; that al the other Ships for New South Wales
had passed all well. We made several unsuccessful attempts to get
up to the Anchorage off the Cape Town but &amp; lost ground every
time &amp; on the 20th at 4 PM. It blew so violent that we found
the Ship would not ride with 2 Anchors ahead &amp; a whole Cable
upon each, we therefore cut &amp; run out to Sea (to prevent
driving too near the No. shore &amp; then not be able to do it) to
the No.ward of Roben Island &amp; were so fortunate as to regain
the Bay &amp; anchor off the Cape Town</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 298]</p>

<p>the 22nd. at 6PM: We stood in for Bay with the Signal of
Distress &amp; had every assistance from the Providence &amp; other
Ships that could be given &amp; before dark got an Anchor &amp;
Cable from the Shore with which we moored.</p>

<p>Friday.23rd. The Swan Sloop of War arrived from England bound to
the Et. Indies, sailed from England 23 Sepr. last. The same evening
the Providence &amp; Assistant sailed on their Voyage.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="jan92" id="jan92"></a>January 1792</p>

<p>January 12th 1792. After having refitted the Ship &amp; waited
several days for the recovery of the Sick, we were under the
necessity of leaving 5 of them at the Hospital; the others were
taken on board but by no means perfectly recover'd: The Wind being
unfavorable it was the 18th. before we could get to Sea. At Noon
Passing Roben Island. Whilst we were at the Cape: We fitted the
Spare Main TopMt. for a Mizen Mast &amp; got down the TrySail Mast
&amp; Gaft as the Vessel was in want of After Sail: Having
experienced that She was considerably over Masted, we reef'd both
the TopMast 4 feet &amp; made some other necessary alterations for
the security of the Masts. We had the Wind from the So. to the SW
till in the Latde. of 23° when we got the SE Trade which in general
was Moderate &amp; fair weather.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="feb92" id="feb92"></a>February

<p>Made the Island of St,Helena the 4th of February &amp; Anchored
off James's</p>

<p class="page-jnl"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[Page

<p class="caption">'James's Valley St Helena 1792'</p>

<p>Valley at Noon the same day.</p>

<p>In standing towards St.Helena, it is best to keep to the SE of
the Island before you get close in with it. It may be approached
without fear. The only Landing places are on the NW side of the
Island &amp; the anchoring ground off the Town being not more than
One Mile &amp; the outer edge of the bank not more than two Miles,
it is necessary to keep the shore close aboard as you haul round
the NE end of the Island (Barn Pt.) which you may know coming from
the SE by a very ragged hill on the Et side &amp; about a Mile to
the So.ward of it, with a small Sugar Loaf top &amp; a look out
house on it, where they hoist Signal Flags &amp; shew balls; before
you get the length of that Hill, you will see the top of Sugar Loaf
Hill with a Flag &amp; Fort on it shewing over the Land between
this look out &amp; Barn Pt. When you pass Barn Pt. which you may
do at a Cables length distance haul close up for Sugar Loaf Pt.
which runs steep down to the Sea from the Fort beforemention'd
&amp; is about 2 Miles to the Wt.ward of Barn Point. It is
necessary to keep close in with Sugar Loaf Pt. if the Trade wind is
fresh, otherwise I think not nearer than ½ a Mile as the Wind
baffles very much when the Trade is not brisk: As you approach
Sugar Loaf Pt. you open the Road, which bears from it about SWbW p.
Compass: between 2 &amp; 3 Miles.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 300]</p>

<p>A small distance to the So.ward pf Sugar Loaf Pt. is Rupert's
Valley (or rather Gulley) off which you have Anchorage if press'd
to it: The hill forming this Valley to the SW also forms James's
Valley to the NE: It has a square Fort near the Water &amp; another
Fort or Battery on the top &amp; is called Munden's Pt. The
Anchoring ground is off James's Valley. 12 or 15 fm. is a very good
birth, you will then be rather more than ¼ of a Mile from the
beach. I would recommend always to Moor, or steady with the Stream,
being subject to have strong flaws off the Land &amp; between those
flaws, baffling Winds from all quarters. We found Watering very
convenient; there being a Wharf &amp; Crane built farther out than
that one formerly used for the purpose, &amp; proper Moorings laid
down off it for a Boat to go &amp; lay with Stoppers to veer in
&amp; haul out occasionally by Stern &amp; Head Ropes: the Boat
lays in deep Water, &amp; the Crane projecting well over the Boat
the Empty Casks are got up &amp; full ones struck over, with great
ease &amp; expedition. It very seldom happens that the Surf is so
great as to prevent Watering, but that may always be seen. On
coming in with Sugar Loaf Pt.; it is necessary to send a Boat a
head &amp; inform the Fort which is near the Water on the Pt. what
Ship it is, &amp; they convey that information</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 301]</p>

<p>as to the Nation, Force &amp;c. by Signals to James Valley. Capt
Hunter was saluted with 11 Guns on his going on Shore &amp; on
embarking to go to Sea. We found every thing very scarce &amp; dear
except Fish, occasioned by their having had two very dry Seasons
following. Variation Obsn. in the Road. 15°:30'W</p>

<p>Monday. 13th: at 3 PM. Sailed from St.Helena &amp; passed to the
Wt.ward of Ascension the 20th.: We saw a Ship in close but did not
speak with her. We cross'd the Line the 27th of Febry. in 22°:18'W
Longitude.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="mar92" id="mar92"></a>March 1792</p>

<p>We kept the Trade fresh till the 1st.March when it became Light
&amp; variable &amp; sometimes Squally before we got into the NE
Trade which we did on the 5th of March in Latde. 5°:09'No. &amp; 25
°Wt. Longitude. We were carried to the Westward to 46 degrees of
Longitude &amp; in the Parallel of 28 ½° No. Latitude; when on the
30th March, the Wind back'd round to the Et.ward &amp; SE &amp;
soon became Variable as generally found in the Western Ocean.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="apr92" id="apr92"></a>April 1792</p>

<p>April 8th: Pass'd the Meridian of Corvo 31 Leagues to the
Northward of it: Spoke an American Ship from Bristol by whom we
heard all was Peace in England.</p>

<p>Sunday 22nd. At 4 PM. Saw the Lizard brg. N.15°E 6 Leagues, do.
by last Lunar Observations N.47°E 9 Leags. At 9.AM Saw Portland
brg. NNE 4 or 5 leagues &amp; at Noon were nearly abreast</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 302]</p>

<p>of St.Albans the weather very hazey over the Land.</p>

<p>Monday 23rd. At 1 PM Saw the Isle of Wight &amp; took a Pilot on
board; At 5 pass'd the Needle Rocks &amp; at 8 Anchored in
Portsmouth Harbor off the Common Hard. Found Vice Admiral Roddams
Flag flying on board the Duke with the Guardships belonging to the
Port in the Harbor.</p>

<p>Friday. 27th: A Court Martial was held on board of the Brunswick
to try Capt. Hunter, the Officers &amp; Crew of the Sirius for the
loss of the said Ship; when it appear'd that every thing was done,
that could be done; to save the Ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><a name="may92" id="may92"></a>May 1792</p>

<p>Capt. Hunter, the Officers &amp; Crew were Honorably Acquitted
&amp; removed from the Waakzaamheydt to the Admiral's Ship, where
they were paid off the 4th May 1792.</p>
