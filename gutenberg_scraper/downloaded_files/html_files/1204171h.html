<p><u>Production Notes:</u><br></p>
<p>In this format, it has not been feasible to preserve the
individual page titles, marginal paragraph headlines or dates,
which form valuable markers in the printed text. However, where
judged useful, dates and other comments have been interpolated in
[square brackets; also used by the author].</p>
<p><u>Modified Version</u>: In this version, the Contents pages
immediately follow the title. All chapters and plates have been
numbered sequentially.</p>
<p>In the book, the author's words appear in normal font size,
whereas quoted documents are generally shown in a smaller font.
In order that these two be more easily distinguished, the author
has been accorded a <i>serif</i> font, while sources quoted are
shown in <i>sans serif</i>. The numerous footnotes, many of them
quite long, can be readily dealt with at the bottom of a page in
a book. In this format however, to promote continuity, the notes
have been numbered sequentially and placed at the end of each
chapter. Here also, source documents (where quoted at reasonable
length), are shown <i>sans serif</i>.</p>
<p>Several other typographical schemes in the original have a
less obvious intent; however, these have all been followed where
feasible. Emphasis has been on legibility and hence minimal or no
reduction in font size.</p>
<p>Click the number in {curly brackets} to go to the note;
afterwards click or touch {<u>return</u>} to resume reading.</p>
<p>The final table in "3.16 The Statistics of Transportation" has
been transformed (rows and columns interchanged) to better suit
the present format.</p>
<p>The Analytical Index has also been included. To assist in
finding an internal reference given by page number, including
those styled "Ante, p. x" or "Post, p. y", a table has been added
at the end, after the Index.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a><i>PREFACE.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> attainment by the colony of the Centennial
period of its existence, appeared to the Government of New South
Wales an appropriate occasion for the preparation, at the public
cost, of a comprehensive history, embodying information
obtainable from all known sources, and of such an authentic
character as to form a reliable basis for the labours of the
future historian. The duty of preparing this important work
having been entrusted to me, it seemed necessary, in order to do
justice to the valuable collection of records placed in my hands
by the Government, to make them the groundwork of a narrative
written on an essentially different plan from that of any
previous one on the subject. <a href="#note-001" name=
"noteref-001" id="noteref-001">{1}</a></p>
<p>In no account of the country yet published have the records
relating to its early years been made use of, at any length.
There is but one in which they are quoted or referred to;
<a href="#note-002" name="noteref-002" id="noteref-002">{2}</a>
but the plan on which it was written did not permit of extensive
references to them, and consequently an occasional paragraph from
the despatches furnishes the only indication of the mine beneath.
At the same time, the exigency of space apparently required the
author to condense the history of the colony to an extent which
rendered any adequate treatment of the subject impossible. The
narrative of events from 1787 to 1792&#8212;the term of Phillip's
command&#8212;is compressed into some eighty pages. In three
other well known works, not even a reference to the records can
be found; and the narrow limits within which the writers moved
may be seen from the fact that the period in question is disposed
of in forty pages by one, in fifty by a second, and in less than
seventy by a third. <a href="#note-003" name="noteref-003" id=
"noteref-003">{3}</a></p>
<p>It is obvious that the events connected with the foundation of
the colony, extending as they did over several years, cannot be
satisfactorily treated on such a plan, in any work pretending to
be historical. When a mass of material, more than enough in
itself to form a volume, is condensed into a few pages, the
result cannot be history in the proper sense of the term; it is,
in fact, nothing more than elaborated almanac. For many reasons,
the period in question might be termed the most important as well
as the most interesting in our annals, and the records relating
to it cannot fail to command attention wherever the history of an
infant nation is regarded with interest&#8212;whether as a matter
of national concern, or simply as a field for the development of
novel theories in politics and sociology.</p>
<p>No one can read the letters and despatches written by Phillip
without feeling the varied interest&#8212;human as well as
historical&#8212;that attaches to them. Extending as they do over
the whole period of his connection with the colony, they contain
all the essential facts connected with its foundation and its
years of infancy, when its life seemed so often trembling in the
balance; but at the same time we have something more than the
essential facts; for we find them everywhere interwoven with many
little details of social life, as well as of Phillip's personal
experience, which often, no doubt, fall far below "the dignity of
history", but are much too valuable as well as interesting to be
omitted. His despatches were written out from his journal, and
consequently they possess the peculiar charm which makes all
journals more or less attractive; great historical events and
little personal matters being mixed up in the narrative just as
they are in daily life. Many of the trifling details with which
the reader will meet in these pages may perhaps lead him to
ask&#8212;why should such trivial passages be printed in a
history? A little consideration, however, will show that they
have their historical as well as their personal value. Even when
we find Phillip repeating himself, as he often does, his
repetitions are worth preserving, because they serve to show how
his mind was working at the time, and in that way they reveal the
character of the man as well as the circumstances by which he was
surrounded. For similar reasons it has been thought proper to
publish his written words exactly as he wrote them, without
making any attempt to correct his spelling and grammar, or to
smooth the rugged surface of his style.</p>
<p>The historical value of these records will be appreciated when
it is remembered that no similar series exists in the case of any
other country. If we turn for comparison to the history of the
American colonies, the difference is as great as that between a
landscape lying in the sunshine, and one dimly seen through the
mists and clouds of winter. In the preface to a history of the
province of New York, written in 1756, the author
said&#8212;"Except some accounts of the settlements in
Massachusetts Bay and Virginia, all the other histories of our
plantations upon the continent are little else than collections
of falsehoods, and worse than none." It is not quite clear from
this passage whether the exception was intended to include the
most famous of all the American chronicles&#8212;"the Generall
Historie of Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles, by
Captain John Smith, sometymes Governour in those Countryes, and
Admirall of New England"; but it is certainly open to some such
criticism. Captain Smith's work is the best specimen of a
personal narrative of American colonisation which English
literature can produce; and it is worth while to consider its
literary character in order to appreciate our own good fortune in
the matter of historical materials. <a href="#note-004" name=
"noteref-004" id="noteref-004">{4}</a> The reader can form a good
estimate of the Captain's value as a chronicler from a passage in
his dedication to the duchess of Richmond, in which he recounts
some of the romantic passages in his life:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The beauteous Lady Tragabigdanza, when I was a slave
to the Turks, did all she could to secure me. When I overcame the
Bashaw of Nalbrits in Tartaria, the charitable Lady Callamata
supplied my necessities. In the utmost of many extremities, that
blessed Pokahontas, the great King's daughter of Virginia, oft
saved my life. When I escaped the cruelty of pirates and most
furious storms, a long time alone in a small boat at sea, and
driven ashore in France, the good lady Madam Chanoyes bountifully
assisted me.</blockquote>
<p>Captain Phillip had not any such conquests as these to boast
of; we do not know that he captivated a single princess among the
sable tribes he met with in such numbers on these shores, and so
far the tale he has to tell derives no charm from romance. No
blessed Pokahontas figures in his story; but what it wants in
point of sentiment is more than atoned for by its realistic
pictures of the life around him. The American chronicler leaves
his reader in doubt as to when he is relating plain facts and
when he is merely filling up gaps with imaginary adventures.
Phillip never leaves us in doubt as to any matter he deals with;
although his language has neither point nor polish, it is
minutely circumstantial and therefore free from
suspicion&#8212;free, too, from the stilted phraseology of
official correspondence.</p>
<p>Similar criticism might be applied to those of his
contemporaries,&#8212;Collins, Hunter, King, Tench, and
White&#8212;who wrote their journals from day to day during the
first years of the settlement. The sketches left by these men,
each of whom wrote from a different point of view, combine to
make up a perfectly faithful picture of the great event in which
they were concerned&#8212;a picture as accurate in every line as
a photograph; for had the sketchers been using sunlight instead
of ink for the scenes they described, their work could not have
been more true to nature than it is. Where in the history of
colonisation shall we look for equally faithful work on the part
of chroniclers? In the records left by Phillip and his
companions, the natural evolution of that complex organism which
we call society may be studied as minutely as the naturalist
examines the movements of an insect under a microscope. The
rudimentary limbs and organs may be seen slowly developing
themselves out of the embryo; struggling into existence, it is
true, under the most unfavourable conditions, and frequently
threatened with death from inanition; but still showing a native
vigour which enabled them to survive the perils that surrounded
them, and attain their full development in later years.</p>
<p>For the purpose of constitutional study in particular, the
importance of such records as these cannot be overestimated.
Every one who has sought to master the constitutional history of
England knows how difficult it is to get any clear understanding
of the origin of those institutions, legal and political, which
make up what is called the English Constitution. It was not until
the scholars of the present day made their laborious
investigations among the records of the Saxon and the Norman
period that the student was enabled to trace those institutions
back through successive ages to their earliest forms; to see, for
instance, the right of trial by jury, of personal liberty, of
parliamentary government, of free speech, and every other right
valued by Englishmen, growing out of their rude surroundings as
easily as he can follow the gradual developments of vertebrate
life in the collections of a museum. Great as the difference is
between a colony and its parent State, there is no absurdity in
comparing the constitutional growth of one with that of the
other. The lapse of a hundred years has given this country a
history, and the peculiar circumstances under which it has grown
to its present dimensions lend an unusual interest to the
examination of its successive stages&#8212;from the small
military camp under Governor Phillip, to the great group of
colonies in the present day. <a href="#note-005" name=

<p>The final section of this volume contains the Bibliography of
Terra Australis, New Holland, and New South Wales to the year
1820, in which many historical references of some interest will
be found, as well as a catalogue of all the various publications
on the subject. "Knowledge", said Dr. Johnson, "is of two kinds.
We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find
information upon it. When we inquire into any subject, the first
thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it.
This leads us to look at catalogues, and the backs of books in
libraries." The force of this remark will be appreciated by every
one who has paid any attention to the history of this country. To
know what books have treated of it, from the earliest times to
the present day, is an essential preliminary to the study; but
hitherto the bibliography of the subject has been left almost
untouched. The present attempt being the first of the kind that
has been made here, the result cannot pretend to be complete;
like the rest of the work, it has had to contend with very
adverse conditions as regards time and materials. Before such a
catalogue can be made, it would be necessary to search the public
libraries of Holland, France, Spain, and Portugal, as well as
those of England; because there can be no doubt that many
publications relating to this part of the world&#8212;from the
first indications of its existence down to recent
periods&#8212;have appeared from time to time in those countries,
of which at present we know nothing.</p>
<p>It is much to be wished that some effort should be made for
the purpose of obtaining as complete a collection of those
publications as can now be made; and also that the Dutch, French,
Spanish, and Portuguese archives should be carefully searched for
the purpose of procuring authentic copies of all State papers
relating to this country. It is not until these materials shall
have been obtained that we can hope to arrive at any satisfactory
conclusions with respect to the only portion of our history that
still remains buried in obscurity. By a remarkable fatality,
almost every writer who has had to deal with the past ages of
Australia has felt impelled to begin with an account of the early
voyages of discovery&#8212;on much the same principle that
historians of old used to commence with the creation of the
world. To deal with the subject of discovery, in the darkness
which still surrounds it, is hardly a less difficult task than
that of the learned Burgomaster Witsen, when he undertook to
write on the Migrations of Mankind. We have only to recall the
various theories with respect to the question of priority among
the discoverers in order to see the existing state of confusion.
There are at least five such theories still in existence: one
sets up the Malays and the Chinese as the first discoverers;
another the French; a third, the Portuguese, a fourth, the
Spaniards; and a fifth, the Dutch. Each of these theories is
supported by a great deal of argument and some evidence; but
nothing seems to come of either but doubt and despair. To show
how unsettled the question still remains, it is enough to mention
that Major, in 1859, considered it highly probable that the
Portuguese discovered the country between 1511 and 1529, and
almost certain that they discovered it before 1542; but having
found a mappemonde in the British Museum two years afterwards, he
came to the conclusion that the country was positively discovered
by the Portuguese in 1601&#8212;the Dutch being thus summarily
dispossessed of an honour they had enjoyed for more than two
centuries. Further researches enabled the lucky discoverer of the
map to satisfy himself that it was "an abominable imposture", and
the laurel crown was thereupon handed back to the Dutch. <a href=
"#note-006" name="noteref-006" id="noteref-006">{6}</a>
Unfortunately, however, the detection of the imposture escaped
the notice of many who had read the account of the
map&#8212;among them being the author of a valuable work on the
History of Australian Exploration, in whose pages it appears as
unquestioned evidence of "a Portuguese discovery of Australia
immediately preceding the Dutch one". <a href="#note-007" name=
"noteref-007" id="noteref-007">{7}</a> However interesting the
point of priority may be, it is a matter of little importance
compared with a reasonably accurate knowledge of the whole
subject&#8212;for which we must wait until it is treated, like
any other branch of inquiry, according to the critical methods of
the present day.</p>

The collection comprises authentic copies of the records relating
to New South Wales, preserved in the Public Record Office in
London, and also in various departments of the State; the copies
having been made under instructions from the Colonial Secretary
(Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G.) by Mr. James Bonwick, an experienced
archivist, whose contributions to Australian history are well
known in the colonies. It also includes original records in the
office of the Colonial Secretary at Sydney; others lent by the

<h3><i>AN INTRODUCTORY SKETCH.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>AT</small> the time when Cook sailed into Botany Bay in
1770 most Englishmen, it might be said, knew as much about New
Holland as they did about the countries lying round the North
Pole, They knew that there was a large tract of land to the south
of New Guinea, which had been so far explored that its existence
was an ascertained fact; but they knew very little more than
that. The big folios in which all the known voyages and travels
in different parts of the world had been collected by
enterprising publishers from time to time&#8212;and which had for
many years supplied the place of the old romances of chivalry
among the reading public&#8212;told them very little about New
Holland. The latest edition of Harris's collection of voyages
(1764), gave them only the voyages of de Quiros, Pelsart, Tasman,
and Dampier. Callander's collection, entitled Terra Australis
Cognita (1766-8), contained those voyages and also a short
historical summary of the Dutch explorations from 1616 to 1705.
These portions of the collection were&#8212;like the rest of
it&#8212;mere translations from a French original. By far the
most popular publications on the subject were the various
editions of Dampier. His New Voyage Bound the World appeared in
1697, and his Voyage to New Holland in the year 1699 was
published in 1703; each passing rapidly through several editions.
How much they suited the taste of the age may be seen in a French
translation published at Amsterdam in 1701-5, in four neat
duodecimos&#8212;evidently intended for the ship's cabin as well
as the library on shore. Dampier's popularity seems to have
spread over all Europe, and naturally, for up to that time no
such tales of the sea had appeared in print. There was none of
the romance about them which made the voyages of the great
discoverers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries seem so
marvellous; but they were distinguished from all other works of
the kind by the author's power of observation and the graphic
style of his narrative, which almost rivalled that of his
contemporary De Foe. <a href="#note-008" name="noteref-008" id=
"noteref-008">{1}</a> Other navigators might have been as exact
in their nautical and astronomical calculations, but they did not
enter into competition with him in the art of
story-telling&#8212;an art which lost none of its power from
being clothed in the homely language of a sailor. So far as New
Holland was concerned, his account of it became stereotyped in
the memory of his countrymen; an unfortunate fact for the country
itself, since the impression left behind was as unfavourable as
it could well be. The land rose up before the reader's
imagination in the shape of a barren, sandy region, "destitute of
Water, except you make Wells", and of everything else that could
make a new country attractive to either trader or traveller;
inhabited, too, by a race of beings described as the lowest and
most degraded type of mankind. Such were the ideas associated
with every mention of New Holland, down to the time when the
lieutenant in command of the Endeavour determined to explore its
eastern coast on his way home from New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is not a very difficult task to identify the known
geography of the country at that time; and it is well worth the
trouble to do so, in order to get some clear idea of the opinions
held by Cook and his companions on the subject. We have only to
recall to mind the various works then in circulation, and to
glance in imagination at the book-shelves in the cabins of the
Endeavour. The little library on board, we may be sure, comprised
every work of any value to the geographer and naturalist in the
South Sea. First on the list we may place the two quartos
published by de Brosses in 1756, containing a complete collection
of all the known voyages to the South Lands&#8212;(p. 575); the
first volume of which contained the Dutch voyages <i>en
Australasie</i>, with a chapter (xxvi) on the Dutch discoveries
in New Holland. The charts published with each volume showed the
position and extent of <i>Nouvelle Hollande</i> as it was then
known, and were no doubt consulted with peculiar interest as the
Endeavour neared its eastern coast. When he was leaving it in
September, 1770, Cook mentioned them in his journal:&#8212;"The
charts with which I compared such parts of this coast as I
visited, are bound up with a French work entitled Histoire des
Navigations aux Terres Australes, which was published in 1756,
and I found them tolerably exact." Looking at one of these
charts, we observe that there is nothing to indicate the
existence of the straits between the mainland and Van Diemen's
Land; but the passage now known as Torres Straits is distinctly
shown, although in the text the author repeatedly expresses a
doubt whether the mainland touched New Guinea or not.</p>
<br>

"Plate-1-1"></a><img alt="" width="650" src=
"1204171h-images/Plate-1-1.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Nouvelle Hollande.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Why this doubt should have been expressed by de Brosses when
the position of the straits is shown so clearly in his charts, is
a question not easily answered. The discovery of the fact that
Torres had sailed through the straits in 1606 is attributed to
Dalrymple, who made it known to the world in his Account of the
Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean previous to 1764,
published in 1767&#8212;a work which we may safely assume had its
place in the Endeavour's library&#8212;(p. 576). Flinders states
in his introduction that "the existence of such a strait was
generally unknown until 1770, when it was again discovered and
passed by our great circumnavigator. Captain Cook." In making
this statement, he seems to have repeated a remark made in the
introduction (p. xvi) to Cook's Third Voyage, where the reader is
told that "though the great sagacity and extensive reading of Mr.
Dalrymple had discovered some traces of such a passage having
been found before, yet those traces were so obscure and so little
known in the present age that", among other things, "the
President de Brosses had not been able to satisfy himself about
them." <a href="#note-009" name="noteref-009" id=
"noteref-009">{2}</a> But unless he had satisfied himself on the
subject, why did he construct his maps of New Holland and New
Guinea in such a manner as to show the straits? This is one of
the many little puzzles connected with Australian geography of
the last century which deserve the attention of those who are
interested in it. The only answer to the question seems to be
that de Brosses looked upon New Holland as an island, probably
considering that fact established; but not having seen the
Relation written by Torres of his passage through the straits, he
thought that there was just room for a doubt on the subject.
Nothing was known about Tasman's second voyage in his time.</p>
<p>Dalrymple's Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries
in the South Pacific Ocean was another work of great authority at
the time it was published&#8212;1770. It contained a chart of the
South Pacific, "pointing out the discoveries made therein
previous to 1764", which showed Torres' track in 1606 through the
straits. The work made its appearance too late to form part of
the Endeavour's library; but its influence on the geographical
speculation of the age may be seen at a glance if we compare the
introduction and the chapter entitled "Investigation of what may
be farther expected in the South Sea", with the introduction to
Cook's Voyage towards the South Pole. Dalrymple was an enthusiast
on this subject, but he was not entitled to any credit for
originality in his speculations; he merely revived the old theory
of the southern continent, but he did it with so much force of
argument and illustration that an expedition to determine the
question was a natural result. It was perhaps unfortunate for us
that his work was not published before the Endeavour sailed;
because we may be allowed to suppose that if Cook had had an
opportunity of reading it, his attention would have been directed
to the name <small>AUSTRALIA</small>, from its frequent
appearance in capital letters&#8212;suggesting the idea that the
author intended to point it out as the proper name for the
country. By such an accident, the land discovered by Cook mighty
peradventure, have escaped the unsatisfactory name it has since
borne.</p>
<p>Callander's translation of de Brosses appeared in
1766-68&#8212;(p. 576); the second and third volumes being
published only two months before the Endeavour sailed; but we may
take it for granted that they were not left behind. The three
volumes had the advantage of being published in a handy form; but
the literary execution was slovenly, and it is manifest that
Callander was not a geographer of much discrimination. He
published two charts, reproductions from the French work, the
larger one showing the outlines of New Holland and the
discoveries of de Quiros. Let us suppose that, as soon as the
Endeavour was steered westward from Cape Farewell in New Zealand,
Cook and his companions read the following account of the country
they were about to explore:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><i>New Holland</i> is that vast region which extends
from the sixth to the 34th degree of south latitude, and from
longtitude 124 degrees to 187. To the north it has the
<i>Molucca</i> islands, or the sea of <i>Lanchidol</i>. To the
west and south the <i>Indian</i> Ocean, and the <i>Pacific</i> to
the east. But, in this immense stretch of land, we are acquainted
only with some parts of the coast lying separated from each
other, without being able to affirm whether they compose one
continent or (as it is more likely) they are large islands
separated from each other by canals or arms of the sea, the
narrowest of which have been supposed by navigators to be the
mouths of rivers. Neither are we yet assured if <i>New
Holland</i> joins <i>New Guinea</i> on the north, or <i>Van
Diemen's Land</i> to the south. <i>Tasman</i> has verified by his
course that <i>New Zealand</i>, lying to the south-east, is
totally separated by the sea from the continents and islands that
lie nearer the equator.<br>
<br>
The principal countries of <i>New Holland</i> we are as yet
acquainted with are, <i>Carpentaria</i> to the north-east, the
coast of which, forming a great bay, faces to the west. At the
entry of this bay are the <i>Molucca</i> islands; to the north
lie the lands of <i>Arnheim</i> and <i>Diemen</i>, which last is
different from the <i>Diemen</i> of <i>Abel Tasman</i>: To the
north-west lies the land of <i>De Witte</i>. Towards the west lie
<i>Endracht</i> or <i>Concordia</i>, <i>Edels</i>, and
<i>Lewin</i>. This last occupies the point which lies south-west.
To the south lies the land of <i>Peter Nuytz</i>, and further
south, but trending eastwards, the land of <i>Diemen</i>, if
indeed this last should be comprehended under the division we are
now describing.<br>
<br>
In running along the east coast of this country, back towards the
Equator, we find the <i>Terra Australis del Espiritu Santo</i>,
discovered by Quiros. But all this vast interval, lying behind
<i>Lewin</i> and <i>Quiros</i>' discovery, is so little known
that we cannot tell what part of it is land and what is sea. This
tract extends from latitude 43 degrees south to latitude 19
degrees, and has not hitherto been visited, at least as far as we
know.</blockquote>
<p>The last paragraph shows that Callander, following de Brosses,
imagined that the land discovered by de Quiros formed part of the
mainland, as shown on the chart. But this error was detected by
Cook before he passed out of the reefs into the open sea. How
correctly he had judged the matter may be seen from his statement
on the 13th August, 1770, when he wrote:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The islands which were discovered by Quiros, and
called Australia del Espiritu Santo, lie in this parallel; but
how far to the eastward cannot now be ascertained: in most charts
they are placed in the same longitude with this country which, as
appears by the account of his voyage that has been published, he
never saw; for that places his discoveries no less than two and
twenty degrees to the eastward of it. <a href="#note-010" name=
"noteref-010" id="noteref-010">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>It is worth while to remember that Dampier intended, in 1699,
to begin his discoveries "upon the Eastern and least known Side
of the Terra Australis." He did not carry out that intention
because he was afraid of "compassing the South of America in a
very high Latitude in the depth of the Winter there"; and also
for another reason which he stated in these words&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>For should it be ask'd why at my first making that
Shore, I did not coast it to the Southward, and that way try to
get round to the East of <i>New Holland</i> and <i>New
Guinea</i>; I confess I was not for spending my Time more than
was necessary in the higher Latitudes; as knowing that the Land
there could not be so well worth the discovering, as the Parts
that lay nearer the Line, and more directly under the Sun.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>IT</small> is necessary here to clear away a very
prevalent misapprehension with respect to the land known to
geography as Terra Australis, or Terra Australis Incognita. It
has been supposed by many writers that the southern continent
which formed the main object of Cook's first voyage was identical
with the country then known as New Holland. The great discovery
that he had in view had nothing to do with that part of the
world. His object was to settle the question&#8212;about which
the geographers were still uncertain&#8212;whether the southern
continent, classically termed the Terra Australis, really existed
or not. As he put it in the introduction to his Second Voyage, he
had to determine "whether the unexplored part of the southern
hemisphere be only an immense mass of water, or contain another
continent." The geographers were not at all curious about the
precise position and extent of New Holland; in fact they had not
manifested any curiosity about it at all; but the question of the
unknown continent was the most important problem in their science
at that time.</p>
<p>The common misconception on this subject may perhaps be traced
to a mistaken construction of the word <i>Terra</i>. As used by
the old geographers, it evidently meant a continent as
distinguished from an island. When, for instance, the Spaniards
passed from Hispaniola to the mainland, they called it the
<i>Tierra firme</i>, to distinguish it from the islands. So, too,
when the geographers gave the name Terra Australis Incognita to
the undiscovered land in the south, they were thinking of a vast
continent stretching from east to west through the South Pacific,
and running round the South Pole. The land discovered by the
Dutch&#8212;which they afterwards called Hollandia Nova in their
charts and Nieuw Holland in their conversation&#8212;was always
supposed to be either one island or several islands separated by
straits. In the sixteenth century, it was described on the map
drawn by John Rotz (1542) as The Londe of Java; the idea being
that it was an immense island&#8212;a sort of appendage to the
little Java. On the other hand, the map drawn by Pierre
Descelliers in 1550,&#8212;(p. 91), represents the unknown
continent running round the South Pole, marked <i>La Terre
Australle</i>. Both these maps have been accepted by modern
geographers as authentic. <a href="#note-012" name="noteref-012"

<br>
<b>The Londe of Java.</b></p>
<br>
<p>When the Dutch began their explorations of our coast in the
seventeenth century, they usually named their discoveries either
after the captains who made them, or the ships in which they
sailed. Dirk Hartog's discovery on the west coast was named Landt
de Endraght, after his ship; the land of Leeuwin was also called
after the ship; De Witt's Land obtained its name from the
captain; so also did the Land of Peter Nuyts, Edel's Land, and
Arnhem's Land. After the second voyage of Tasman in 1644, the
country was called Hollandia Nova; a name which passed into
common use among European geographers, in its translated forms,
until it was superseded by Australia. But according to
Flinders&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>the original name, used by the Dutch themselves until
some time after Tasman's second voyage in 1644, was Terra
Australis or Great South Land; and when it was displaced by New
Holland, the new term was applied only to the parts lying
westward of a meridian line passing through Arnheim's Land on the
north and near the isles of St. Francis and St. Peter on the
south; all to the eastward, including the shores of the Gulph of
Carpentaria, still remained as Terra Australis. <a href=
"#note-013" name="noteref-013" id=
"noteref-013">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p>The only authority mentioned by Flinders for this statement is
a chart published by Thevenot in 1667, which "was originally
taken from that done, in inlaid work, upon the pavement of the
new Stadt House at Amsterdam." A chart done on a pavement does
not appear to furnish much reliable evidence; but on the strength
of it Flinders seems to have come to the conclusion that Terra
Australis was the proper name for the whole country in his own
day; and for that reason he sought to revive its use, in
preference even to the name Australia. A little consideration
will show that he had no substantial grounds for his conclusion.
There is nothing to prove that the chart referred to by Thevenot
was authentic; or that it was designed by geographers; or that it
was in any other way entitled to be considered an authority.
There is room for doubt on all these points. Burney tells us that
Sir Joseph Banks, during his stay at Amsterdam in 1773, "was at
much pains in making enquiry concerning the Stadt House map; but
he could obtain no proof of the work having been visible within
the memory of man." <a href="#note-014" name="noteref-014" id=
"noteref-014">{7}</a> If no one in Amsterdam I had ever heard of
it at that time, there can be no certainty that it ever existed,
seeing that national records are usually preserved with some
care. The idea that the Dutch called the undiscovered portion of
the country Terra Australis, as stated by Flinders, is disposed
of by Burney's description of the map:&#8212;"Eastward on the
same land, but without defined limits, is inserted the name
<i>Terre Australe</i>, which, being in the French language, was
probably an explanatory addition introduced by M. Thevenot
himself."</p>
<p>Let us now consider the evidence on the other side. In the
first place, there is the striking fact that Cook does not speak
of the country as Terra Australis, but as New Holland. When
considering his route after having explored New Zealand, he
said:&#8212;"It was therefore resolved that we should return by
the West Indies, and that with this view we should, upon leaving
the coast [of New Zealand] steer westward till we should fall in
with the east coast of New Holland." There can be no doubt that
Cook had carefully studied all the published voyages of discovery
in the South Pacific; while the fact that he determined to
explore the east coast of New Holland shows that the geography of
that country had attracted his attention. Why then should he
speak of it as New Holland, if Terra Australis was not only "the
original name", but the one by which it continued to be known in
his own time?</p>
<p>In the second place, we have only to consult the authorities
of his day to see that he used the name which every one else
used. In the charts published by Dalrymple and Callander, it was
named New Holland; and in those of de Brosses, it was marked
Nouvelle Hollande. The name was continued by later geographers.
Pennant's Outlines of the Globe (1800), and Pinkerton's Modern
Geography (1802)&#8212;pp. 590-1, were the principal works of the
kind at that time; and in each the country was described as New
Holland.</p>
<p>In the third place, the name Terra Australis was not used in
the instructions given to Tasman, nor in any of the extracts from
the Dutch archives and publications collected by Major <a href=
"#note-015" name="noteref-015" id=
"noteref-015">{8}</a>&#8212;from which it may be inferred that
the Dutch geographers did not at any time apply that name to the
country in question. It is singular that an author of the present
day, having this fact before him in his own pages, should
nevertheless have followed the example set by Flinders in
adopting a misleading title for his work. The inaccuracy may be
compared with another in p. lxxiii of the same treatise, where it
is said that "Quiros came to a land which he named Australia del
Espiritu Santo"; the name actually given being&#8212;<i>la
Austrialia del Espiritu Santo</i>, Burney pointed out in 1813
that the Dutch did not apply the name Terra Australis to their
discoveries:&#8212;"Throughout the instructions to Tasman for his
second voyage, the Terra Australis is called the Groote Zuidland,
or On-bekende Zuid-land, i.e., the Great or the Unknown South
Land." <a href="#note-016" name="noteref-016" id=
"noteref-016">{9}</a> But Burney did not see the absurdity of his
calling the country Terra Australis, when the men who had made
its exploration their business for at least a century never did
so.</p>
<p>In the fourth place, the French geographers, whose opinions
are entitled to very great weight, appear to have uniformly
observed the Dutch practice in this matter; that is, in not
confounding New Holland with Terra Australis. It is evident from
the work of de Brosses that when he spoke of the <i>Terres
Australes</i>, he meant nothing more than the lands discovered in
the South Seas. He drew a clear line of distinction between the
unknown continent and the discoveries in New Holland, New Guinea,
and New Zealand, of which he says (tom. i, p. 16)&#8212;<i>ce
n'est peut-&#234;tre pas un seul continent. Il y a toute
apparence que ces grandee contr&#233;es sont isol&#233;es par
plusieurs d&#233;troits inconnus</i>. Although this passage is
correctly translated by Callander (vol. i, p. 10), he
interpolates nearly six pages (pp. 43-48) in the text of de
Brosses for the purpose of developing his own ideas on the
subject; beginning with the contradictory statement that "New
Guinea, Carpentaria, New Holland, Diemen's Land, and the country
discovered by Quiros, make all one great continent, from which
New Zealand seems to be separated by a strait."</p>
<p>Callander's title may be largely responsible for the confusion
of ideas which misled Burney and Flinders, as well as others;
although the name Terra Australis was applied to this country in
many publications before his time. Dampier, for instance, in his
New Voyage Bound the World, spoke of it as&#8212;"New Holland, a
part of Terra Australis Incognita". But he, too, thought that New
Holland was an island;&#8212;"I found that other parts of this
great Tract of <i>Terra Australis</i>, which had hitherto been
represented as the Shore of a Continent, were certainly Islands;
and 'tis probably the same with <i>New Holland</i>." <a href=
"#note-017" name="noteref-017" id="noteref-017">{10}</a></p>
<p>The fact that he believed the country to be an island at the
same time that he spoke of it as part of the unknown continent,
shows how unsettled his opinion was about it. At the time he
wrote, there was nothing but uncertainty on the subject; Tasman's
second voyage had not been made known to the world; and even the
hydrographers of a much later period had not succeeded in getting
any accurate ideas. In the introduction to his Collection of
Voyages in the South Pacific, published by Dalrymple in
1770&#8212;two years after Cook set sail on his voyage in the
Endeavour&#8212;he gave it as his opinion, based on a
long-continued study of the subject, that "it is more than
probable that another continent will be there found [in the South
Pacific], extending from 30&#176; south towards the pole." He
believed, too, that the continent in question had "been seen on
the west side by Tasman in 1642, and on the east by Juan
Fernandes above half a century before, and by others after him,
in different latitudes from 64&#176; to 40&#176; south." These
confident assertions proved to be nothing more than imagination;
and it was to settle the question raised by them that Cook was
sent a second time into the South Pacific.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the name Terra Australis was
sometimes applied to the discovered portions of this country two
centuries ago, there was no more reason for giving it to them
than there would have been for giving it to the New Hebrides or
Juan Fernandez. A chart of the islands discovered in the South
Sea to the year 1620, published in Burney's Collection of
Voyages, shows an outline of the north-west coast marked "Part of
the Great Terra Australis"; and speaking of the discoveries of de
Quiros, he said:&#8212;"The Australia del Espiritu Santo was long
supposed to be part of the Great Terra Australis, and in some
charts of so recent a date as the middle of the eighteenth
century, the two lands are drawn joined." He referred to the
charts published by de Brosses, which were drawn by the
geographer in ordinary to the King of France&#8212;a title
conferred by letters patent as a reward for distinguished
services. The French cartographers were celebrated for their
charts and mappermondes even in the earliest years of their
art.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>TO</small> understand exactly what the old geographers
had in their minds when they wrote about Terra Australis, we must
go back at least three centuries, when the theory of its
existence was in high favour among them. What they thought about
it may be seen in the map of the world published with the account
of Frobisher's voyages in the year 1578, and the description of
the country given by the writer:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><i>Terra Australis</i> seemeth to be a great firme
land, lying under and aboute the south pole, being in many places
a fruitefull soyle, and is not yet thorowly discovered, but onlye
seene and touched on the north edge therof, by the travaile of
the Portingales and Spaniards, in their Voyages to their East and
Weast <i>Indies</i>.<br>
<br>
It is included almost by a paralell, passing at 40 degrees in
south latitude, yet in some places it reacheth into the sea with
greate promontories, even into the tropicke Capricornus. Onely
these partes are best knowen, as over against <i>Capo d' buona
Speranza</i> (where the Portingales see popingayes commonly of a
wonderfull greatnesse), and againe it is knowen at the south side
of the straight of Magellanus, and is called Terra del
Fuego.</blockquote>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Plate-1-3" id=
"Plate-1-3"></a><img alt="" width="650" src=
"1204171h-images/Plate-1-3.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Terra Australis.</b></p>
<br>
<blockquote>It is thoughte this southlande, about the pole
Antartike, is farre bigger than the north land aboute the pole
Artike; but whether it be so or not, we have no certaine
knowledge, for we have no particular description hereof, as we
have of the lande under and aboute the north pole. <a href=
"#note-018" name="noteref-018" id=
"noteref-018">{11}</a></blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps the earliest description we have of the
supposed continent from, the pen of an English geographer. How
the idea was gradually developed in succeeding ages may be seen
from a short statement of it in Purchas, whose folios appeared in
1625. Speaking of "the Lands on the Southerne side of the
[Magellan] Straits", he says:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>This Land about the Straits is not perfectly
discovered, whether it be Continent or Islands. Some take it for
Continent and extend it more in their imagination than any man's
experience, towards those Islands of <i>Saloman</i> and New
Guinee, esteeming (of which there is great probability) that
<i>Terra Australis</i> or the Southerne Continent, may for the
largeness thereof, take up a first place in order, and the first
in greatnesse in the division and parting of the Whole
World.</blockquote>
<p>As stated by Burney, the Tierra del Fuego was considered to be
"part of a great continent, extending both eastward and westward
to New Guinea, and round the South Pole, occupying nearly all the
space which had not been cut off by the tracks of European
navigators; and this ideal continent they have not left destitute
of its capes and gulfs." <a href="#note-019" name="noteref-019"
id="noteref-019">{12}</a> The opinions of the men who furnished
the world with geography in those days have not yet lost their
interest for us, and therefore a further passage from Purchas may
be quoted for the purpose of showing how they arrived at
conclusions which nowadays seem so extraordinary. He gives as his
authority one Master Brerewood, professor of Astronomy in Gresham
College from 1596 to 1613:</p>
<blockquote>Master <i>Breerewood</i>, our Learned Countryman,
persuadeth himself that it is as large as the Easterne Continent,
which containeth Europe, Africa, and Asia altogether. His reasons
are that, touching Latitude, it is known to approach neere (if
not on this side) the <i>&#198;quator</i>; and touching
Longitude, to runne along in a continuall circuit about the
Earth, fronting both the other Continents.<br>
<br>
Another reason, which he deemeth of more certain importance, is
this, that the Land to the North side of the Line in the other
Continents of the Old and New World is at least four times as
large as that part of them which lyeth to the South. Now for as
much of the face of the Sea is level (so hee argueth) being
therefore called <i>&#198;quor</i> and <i>Aqua</i>; and,
secondly, the Earth being equally poised on both sides of her own
Centre; and, thirdly, this Centre being but one to the Water and
the Earthy even no other than the Centre of the World: it
followeth thereupon that the Earth should in answerable measure
and proportion lift itselfe, and appear above the face of the
Sea, on the South side of the Line, as it doth on the North; and
consequently what is wanting in the South parts of the other
Continents towards the countervailing of the North parts (which
is about three parts of both the other Continents layed together)
must of necessitie be supplyed in this Continent of the South.
<a href="#note-020" name="noteref-020" id=
"noteref-020">{13}</a></blockquote>
<p>Master Brerewood was a contemporary of Bacon and Raleigh, and
it is not unlikely that he discussed this subject with them; but
unfortunately we have no indication of their ideas about it. All
we know is that the ponderous reasoning which satisfied the
learned professor seemed to satisfy his great contemporaries as
well as the little ones, for there was no division of opinion
among them. The theory maintained its vitality until it was
exploded by Captain Cook&#8212;who, by the way, thought that de
Quiros was "the first who had any idea of the existence of a
southern continent." <a href="#note-021" name="noteref-021" id=
"noteref-021">{14}</a> That was a mistake. The idea had been
floating about in the minds of men for ages before the Spaniard
became possessed of it; as he said in his eighth petition to the
King of Spain, it had grown up with him from his cradle. Probably
he heard of it as soon as he began to take any interest in
nautical matters. He lived in a time when men of all maritime
countries were full of speculations&#8212;mercantile as well as
theoretical&#8212;with respect to undiscovered lands beyond their
own seas; and he seems to have been about the last of the
enthusiastic sailors of his own race who, from the days of Prince
Henry of Portugal, had made the discovery of new worlds the great
ambition of their lives. Of all the early navigators who had
sailed the South Pacific, he is the only one of whom it can be
said with certainty that he set out on his voyage with the
distinct intention of discovering the ideal Terra Australis.</p>
<p>Geography is not usually a rich field for poetic invention;
but the unknown continent appealed so powerfully to the
imagination that it could not expect to escape poetic treatment.
In a long forgotten poem by T. K. Hervey entitled
<small>AUSTRALIA</small>&#8212;which reached a third edition in
1829&#8212;the author gives a prophetic vision of the ruin of old
England, and then proceeds to describe her revival in a southern
empire; logically approaching the subject with a sketch of the
imaginary continent. The unhappy fate of Magellan and Columbus
having been deplored, the poet proceeds:&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">While Science wept above each hallowed grave,<br>
And mourned her gallant wanderers of the wave,<br>
Hope smiled to think they had not lived in vain,<br>
And Fancy built new regions in the main:&#8212;<br>
Far o'er the billowy waste she proudly trod,<br>
To teach the wonders and the ways of God;<br>
And where the vast antarctic waters roll,<br>
She reared a continent against the Pole!</p>
<p>The result of Cook's explorations is described with equal
accuracy:&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">Before his daring soul and piercing eye,<br>
Behold that polar vision darkly fly!<br>
See, from its throne upon the waters, hurled<br>
The shapeless phantom of a southern world!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> chapter in which Botany Bay is described in
the account of Cook's first voyage was written by the editor,
Hawkesworth, from the journals kept by Cook and Banks. It is
unfortunate that we can only conjecture from internal evidence
which portion of the material was supplied by one and which by
the other; still more so that instead of having their
descriptions of the country in their own words, we have merely a
reproduction of them by the editor. The impression made upon
Banks in particular by his examination of the country was so deep
that it lasted throughout his life; but there is no indication of
it in Hawkesworth's narrative. There is nothing in it to show
that Banks had formed any opinion of the country as a field for
settlement; and yet there can be no doubt that his mind was full
of that idea while he was walking about the shores of Botany Bay.
It is equally certain that from the time he returned to England
in July, 1771, to the end of his days, he never lost his interest
in it; that he used every means in his power to promote the
occupation of the country by the Government; that he took a very
active part in the measures ultimately adopted for that purpose;
and that he watched over the varying fortunes of the little
colony with as much anxiety as if he had held a grant from the
Crown of the whole territory, after the fashion in which such
grants were made in the days of Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>
<p>Why it was that he thought so much of the country is a matter
not easily understood at first sight. As a piece of scenery,
Botany Bay could hardly be compared with Queen Charlotte's Sound
in New Zealand, where the Endeavour had been lying for three
weeks shortly before she reached our coasts: but with all its
charms of winding bays and coves, and hills covered with
impenetrable forests, echoing the melody of birds which "seemed
to be like small bells, most exquisitely tuned", the Sound did
not make any other impression on Banks than that of the transient
pleasure which every traveller receives from a scene of wild
uncultivated beauty. That it did not suggest any idea of
colonisation may be understood from the fact mentioned by Cook as
the result of his survey&#8212;"we found no flat large enough for
a potatoe garden." The contrast between the scenery of Botany Bay
and that which had just been left behind in New Zealand gave rise
to very animated discussions on board the Endeavour. The densely
timbered hills in one, and the gentle undulations of the other,
had each their advocates; but we may imagine Banks summing up the
characteristics of the two countries by saying that while the
Sound was a magnificent place for tourists to roam about in
Botany Bay was designed by nature as a field for colonists. There
was no difficulty in finding flats there large enough for many
potato gardens. The whole country about the bay seemed to rise
and fall for miles around like the lazy billows of the Pacific on
a summer day; there were no impenetrable masses of heavy timber,
the trees standing so far apart as to give the appearance of an
English park. The general impression with respect to the scenery
of the bay has seldom done justice to it; but that Cook and his
friends thought well of it is manifest from their description. A
few lines from Hawkesworth&#8212;whose narrative, by the way,
never rises beyond a cold expression of approval whatever the
scene he describes&#8212;will be sufficient to show what they
thought of it.</p>
<blockquote>We found the soil to be either swamp or light sand,
and the face of the country finely diversified by wood and lawn.
The trees are tall, straight, and without underwood, standing at
such a distance from each other that the whole country, at least
where the swamps do not render it incapable of cultivation, might
be cultivated without cutting down one of them; between the trees
the ground is covered with grass, of which there is great
abundance, growing in tufts about as big as can well be grasped
in the hand, which stand very close to each other. The trees over
our head abounded with birds of various kinds, among which were
many of exquisite beauty, particularly loriquets and cockatoos,
which flew in flocks of several scores together.</blockquote>
<p>The country examined on that occasion was the southern shore
of the bay, near the point at which Cook had landed&#8212;and
which is now identified by a monument erected in 1870 to
commemorate the event. On another day, "while Mr. Banks was
gathering plants near the watering place", Cook went with
Solander and one of his officers to examine the country at the
head of the bay&#8212;by which he probably meant that part of it
lying near the mouth of George's River; although he makes no
mention either of that or of the other river since named after
him. Here he seems to have been still more pleased with what he
saw:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We went up the country for some distance, and found
the face of it nearly the same with that which has been described
already, but the soil was much richer; for instead of sand, I
found a deep black mould, which I thought very fit for the
production of grain of any kind. In the woods we found
interspersed some of the finest meadows in the world: some places
however were rocky, but these were comparatively few: the stone
is sandy, and might be used with advantage for
building.</blockquote>
<p>"Cook's meadows" became a standing joke in the settlement
formed by Phillip on the shores of Sydney Cove. All the officers
on board the First Fleet had read his account of Botany Bay
before they left England&#8212;it is not difficult to imagine how
eagerly they took up the third volume of Hawkesworth for the
purpose; and on their arrival they expected to find themselves in
possession of ready-made meadows, where the plough might be
driven without cutting down a tree. Because they did not land on
the exact spot described by Cook, they considered themselves
cruelly deceived; and in the bitterness of their disappointment
they wrote very angry letters to their friends in England,
denouncing the country and everything in it. One of these
indignant gentlemen wrote that they were all "very much surprised
at Mr. Cook's description of Botany Bay"; and another that "the
country for several miles round the bay does not afford a spot
large enough for a cabbage garden, that was fit for cultivation"
(pp. 503-7). Nevertheless, the natural meadows were there all the
time, and Cook's observations were as exact in this as they are
known to be in every other instance. The explanation of the
difference between his account of the country and that of the
angry correspondents is, that they made the mistake of applying
his description to all parts of it, instead of to one. Their
knowledge of the land was practically confined to the northern
shore&#8212;and to that part of it which lay between it and
Sydney Cove. Phillip described it as "a poor sandy heathy full of
swamps"; but it is now largely occupied by market gardens. This
northern shore was examined by Cook, towards the sea coast, and
he wrote of it as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We found this place without wood, and somewhat
resembling our moors in England; the surface of the ground,
however, was covered with a thin brush of plants, about as high
as the knees; the hills near the coast are low, but others rise
behind them, increasing by a gradual ascent to a considerable
distance, with marshes and morasses between.</blockquote>
<p>When the French naturalist, P&#233;ron, visited the colony in
1802, he described the western shore of the bay as having <i>un
aspect enchanteur</i>, which he attributed to the rank vegetation
of the swamps caused by the flooding of the two rivers flowing
into the bay; concluding that <i>le capitaine Cook et ses
illustres compagnons y furent tromp&#233;s</i>. There is no
reason to suppose that they were deceived in the least; nor can
there be any question as to the accuracy of their description.
The only matter for surprise is that they spoke with so much
reserve about the natural attractions of the country. The most
conspicuous feature about it was the remarkable beauty of the
native plants, and especially of the wild flowers, which were
certainly not the product of a swamp, because they are found in
their greatest luxuriance in a light sandy soil, near the sea
coast. But Hawkesworth tells us little or nothing on this
subject, although it may be taken for granted that there was a
good deal about it in Banks's journal. All we learn is that "the
great quantity of plants which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander
collected in this place induced me to give it the name of Botany
Bay;" and again, "there are a few shrubs, and several kinds of
the palm; mangroves also grow in great plenty near the head of
the bay." These passages were written by Cook, who was not a
botanist. That Banks saw something more than a "few shrubs"
there, may be gathered from a letter written by him to the
Under-Secretary at the Home Office many years
afterwards:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">London, 27 April, 1789.   </p>
<br>
Sir,&#8212;Concluding that it will be thought a desirable Object
to bring home for his Majestie's Botanic Garden at Kew some of
the many beautifull and usefull Plants with which the Country in
the neighborhood of Jackson's Bay is known to abound I beg leave
to suggest to you Sir that if the Tafferell of the Ship Guardian
be fitted for the reception of Pots in the same manner as was
done in the case of the bounty, and one Line along the sides of
the Great Cabbin she will be able without any inconvenience to
the officers to bring home a great number.<br>
<br>
If this Plan is approved I shall be happy to pay all the
attention in my power to the Execution of it which as the Bounty
has been so lately fitted cannot be a matter of the least
difficulty.</blockquote>
<p class="blok">     I have the honor to be with much respect</p>
<p class="blok" align="center">Your Most Obedient and Most Humble
Servant<br></p>
<p class="blok" align="right"><small>JOS. BANKS</small>.   </p>
<p class="blok">Evan Nepean, Esq.</p>
<p>The date of this letter shows that it was written exactly
nineteen years from the day on which Banks and Cook made their
first attempt to land on the coast near Botany Bay&#8212;which
they entered on the following day. That was a long space of time;
but "the many beautifull and usefull plants" which had been seen
about the bay had not been forgotten; and the first opportunity
was taken for the purpose of procuring specimens from Port
Jackson. It was in the beginning of winter that Banks saw the
plants in their native soil, but at that season of the year the
land was no longer covered with the wonderful wild flowers which
have always attracted so much admiration. If he had been there in
the summer months, when the flowers were in full bloom, he might
have fancied himself in some deserted garden in the East, in
which an endless variety of tropical plants had been left to
spread themselves over the ground in wild confusion.</p>
<p>It was not, however, with the eyes of a botanist only that
Banks looked upon this country. Although his opportunities for
examining it were very limited&#8212;owing, we may suppose, to
Cook's anxiety to reach England as soon as possible&#8212;he saw
enough to convince him that it was eminently suited for
colonisation; the climate was perfect, and a soil which, in its
natural state, could produce such vegetation as he saw, could be
made with little labour to grow anything. If only the Endeavour
had run into one or other of the nearest bays to the
north&#8212;Port Jackson or Broken Bay&#8212;it would have been
his good fortune to see his first impressions more than
confirmed, and he would then have been able to proclaim on his
return homo that the English flag had been hoisted on the finest
field for colonisation in the world. Even as things stood, he had
no hesitation in giving his opinion in very confident terms. When
examined as a witness before a Committee of the House of Commons,
appointed in 1779 to inquire into the state of the gaols and the
question of transportation, he spoke strongly in favour of Botany
Bay as a field of operations, arguing that its soil and climate
were such as would soon enable a settlement to become
self-supporting. As his evidence on the subject may be said to
form the starting point of our history, it is worth while to
reproduce it. It should be recollected that he was addressing a
number of gentlemen whose minds were concentrated on one
question&#8212;what should be done with the felons?</p>
<blockquote><i>Joseph Banks, Esquire</i>, being requested, in
case it should be thought expedient to establish a colony of
convicted felons in any distant part of the globe, from whence
their escape might be difficult, and where, from the fertility of
the soil, they might be enabled to maintain themselves, after the
first year, with little or no aid from the mother country, to
give his opinion what place would be most eligible for such
settlement, informed your Committee that the place which appeared
to him best adapted for such a purpose was <i>Botany Bay</i>, on
the coast of <i>New Holland</i>, in the Indian Ocean, which was
about seven months' voyage from England; that he apprehended
there would be little probability of any opposition from the
natives, as during his stay there in the year 1770 he saw very
few, and did not think there were above fifty in all the
neighbourhood, and had reason to believe the country was very
thinly peopled; those he saw were naked, treacherous, and armed
with lances, but extremely cowardly, and constantly retired from
our people when they made the least appearance of resistance. He
was in this bay in the end of April and beginning of May, 1770,
when the weather was mild and moderate; that the climate, he
apprehended, was similar to that about Toulouse, in the south of
France, having found the Southern Hemisphere colder than the
Northern, in such proportion that any given climate in the
Southern answered to one in the Northern about ten degrees nearer
to the pole; the proportion of rich soil was small in comparison
to the barren, but sufficient to support a very large number of
people; there were no tame animals, and he saw no wild ones
during his stay of ten days, but he observed the dung of what was
called the <i>Kangourous</i>, which were about the size of a
middling sheep, but very swift and difficult to catch; some of
those animals he saw in another part of the bay upon the same
continent; <a href="#note-022" name="noteref-022" id=
"noteref-022">{15}</a> there were no beasts of prey, and he did
not doubt but our sheep and oxen, if carried there, would thrive
and increase; there was great quantity of fish, he took a large
quantity by hauling the seine, and struck several
stingrays&#8212;a kind of skate&#8212;all very large; one weighed
three hundred and thirty-six pounds. The grass was long and
luxuriant, and there were some eatable vegetables, particularly a
sort of wild spinage; the country was well supplied with water;
there was abundance of timber and fuel, sufficient for any number
of buildings which might be found necessary.<br>
<br>
Being asked, how a colony of that nature could be subsisted in
the beginning of their establishment? he answered&#8212;They must
certainly be furnished at landing, with a full year's allowance
of victuals, raiment, and drink; with all kinds of tools for
labouring the earth, and building houses; with black cattle,
sheep, hogs, and poultry; with seeds of all kinds of European
corn and pulse; with garden seeds; with arms and ammunition for
their defence, and they should likewise have small boats, nets,
and fishing tackle, all of which, except arms and ammunition,
might be purchased at the Cape of Good Hope; and that afterwards,
with a moderate portion of industry, they might undoubtedly
maintain themselves without any assistance from England. He
recommended sending a large number of persons, two or three
hundred at least; their escape would be difficult, as the country
was far distant from any part of the globe inhabited by
Europeans.<br>
<br>
And being asked, whether he conceived the mother country was
likely to reap any benefit from a colony established in Botany
Bay? he replied&#8212;If the people formed among themselves a
civil government, they would necessarily increase, and find
occasion for many European commodities; and it was not to be
doubted, that a tract of land such as New Holland, which was
larger than the whole of Europe, would furnish matter of
advantageous return. <a href="#note-023" name="noteref-023" id=
"noteref-023">{16}</a></blockquote>
<p>Several other witnesses were examined by the Committee with
respect to places on the African coast at which penal settlements
might be formed. The Committee did not express any opinion about
Botany Bay or any other place; but they were evidently in favour
of a settlement being formed on the plan suggested by Banks. They
observed in their report&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>That the plan of establishing a colony or colonies of
young convicts in some distant part of the globe, and in new
discovered countries, where the climate is healthy and the means
of support attainable, is equally agreeable to the dictates of
humanity and sound policy, and might prove in the result
advantageous both to navigation and commerce.</blockquote>
<p>But there was a difficulty in the way which would require
fresh legislation to remove. The existing laws on the subject of
transportation applied only to the colonies and plantations in
North America, and the War of Independence&#8212;then at its
height&#8212;had closed their ports to the convict ships. The
Committee therefore recommended&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>That it might be of public utility if the laws which
now direct and authorize the transportation of certain convicts
to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in North America, were
made to authorize the same to any other part of the globe that
may be found expedient. <a href="#note-024" name="noteref-024"
id="noteref-024">{17}</a></blockquote>
<p>The resolutions of the Committee were agreed to by the House,
and it was thereupon ordered that leave should be given to bring
in a bill to explain and amend the laws relating to the
transportation of offenders. The effect of the legislation
subsequently adopted on that subject is stated at p. 449. Turning
to page 428, it will be seen that Matra quotes these resolutions
of the Committee at the end of his sketch, connecting them with
Sydney's remark to him about transportation to New South Wales;
from which it may be inferred that the Minister had directed his
attention to the report, and that, having looked it up to
ascertain its bearing on his proposals, he then added the
concluding paragraphs for the purpose of pointing out the
advantages offered by his scheme from that particular point of
view. Perhaps he began to see, at the same time, that it was
hopeless to talk about the American loyalists or any other free
settlers.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> evidence given by Banks before the
Committee did not produce any immediate result; but he had sown
an acorn which was destined to come up and flourish in its
appointed time. The question of the felons and what should be
done with them vexed the souls of successive Parliaments and
Ministries; it was discussed by philanthropists from one point of
view and by politicians from another; but nothing came of their
discussions but accumulations of pamphlets and parliamentary
papers, with a great work on the State of the Prisons from John
Howard and a very little one from Jeremy Bentham, fantastically
called a Panopticon, in which the philosopher developed "a new
principle" of constructing and managing prisons. While the
American war lasted, Lord North and his colleagues had no time to
spare for matters of that kind; and the Governments which
immediately succeeded his were too short-lived to accomplish any
substantial legislation&#8212;the real cause of their
inefficiency being the blank indifference to questions of social
reform which characterised all the politics and politicians of
the time.</p>
<p>Better prospects dawned upon the country with the advent of
Pitt's administration in 1783. It lasted for eighteen years, and
the first ten of them being years of peace, the Ministry had
leisure enough to frame any scheme of reform they might please,
as well as the power to carry it into effect. Soon after peace
had been declared with the United States, the colonists who had
remained loyal pressed their claims on Parliament for
compensation for the losses they had sustained in the war. They
had been driven out of their homes, outlawed and ruined men, and
were consequently forced to seek a refuge from the tempest
wherever they could find one. Most of them went to the British
North American provinces and settled there. Among the proposals
made for relieving their distress, it was suggested in 1783 by an
Englishman named Matra that some of them should be settled at
Botany Bay. He drew up an outline of his ideas on the subject,
enlisted the support of Sir Joseph Banks, and formally submitted
his plan to the Government. Looking at his proposals in the
present day, there need be no hesitation in saying that if the
Government had adopted them as they stood and carried them out in
a manner worthy of the country, it would have formed the most
statesmanlike achievement in the history of Pitt's
administration.</p>
<p>But the temper of the age did not favour colonising
experiments in which the colonists were to be free agents, while
the expenditure was to be met by the public Treasury. Nothing of
that kind, at any rate, would go down with the Ministry. The Home
Office, which had charge of all matters relating to the colonies,
was then presided over by Lord Sydney&#8212;a politician better
known among his contemporaries by the familiar name of Tommy
Townshend. His genius was not accustomed to the work of evolving
original conceptions, or even of revolving old ones, when they
happened to be rather more comprehensive than usual. He was one
of those light-hearted politicians who habitually look upon
politics as things of the present hour, and who frame their
measures in the same happy state of mind in which they pull on
their gloves or pull off their boots&#8212;to suit their
convenience at the time. So that when the enthusiastic Matra
approached his lordship with his new and original scheme for
founding a great colony with the American loyalists, the only
encouragement he obtained was a remark that New South Wales might
be a very proper place for the convicts under sentence of
transportation. Matra no doubt felt the chill which every great
originator has been doomed to feel, as soon as the project warmed
by the fire of genius has been brought into contact with the cold
surface of practical politics.</p>
<p>There the matter rested for two years, and might have rested
for many years more, had it not been taken up by another
enthusiast. Sir George Young; but although he combined a high
position in the navy with a good deal of private and official
influence, he was not much more successful than
Matra&#8212;probably owing to the fact that he, too, was in
favour of sending out the American loyalists. There can be no
doubt, however, that this second appeal had the effect of driving
the matter still further into the official mind; so that when
another year had been suffered to go by, it was at last resolved
that the materials supplied by Matra and Young should be utilised
for the purpose of framing a little plan of an essentially
different character&#8212;one which would exactly meet the
political difficulty of the hour, while it carefully excluded the
purely enthusiastic idea of founding a great colony of the old
heroic type.</p>
<p>Slow as the progress was and tedious the delay, let it be
remembered that, but for the really important person who stood
behind the scenes, the negotiations which occupied the interval
between August 1783 and August 1786 might have extended over a
much longer space of time; and might peradventure have come to
nothing after all. The idea of founding a colony at Botany Bay
clearly originated with Banks; it was proposed by him in 1779;
from him it passed to others, and was at last formulated in set
terms for the approval of the Government by men who quoted Banks
as the great authority on the subject. Ministers in their turn
consulted him with as much confidence as the promoters of the
scheme had done; and it was undoubtedly on his strong persuasion
that the order was at last given for the equipment and despatch
of an expedition to the shores of New South Wales.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> relation in which Banks stood towards the
colony from that time corresponded with the position he occupied
in the initial stages of the movement. His interest in it might
be described as a paternal one; his right to be consulted in
every measure concerning it was freely recognised by successive
Ministers; and there is no exaggeration in saying that, during
the active portion of his life, no measure of any importance was
adopted without his opinion having been taken on the subject. It
is not easy to find a parallel instance in the history of
colonisation; but if we suppose that Sir Walter Raleigh's
attempts to found a colony in North America had succeeded, we can
imagine how anxiously he would have watched its progress, how
steadily he would have used his influence with Burleigh to
promote its interests, and how confidently he would have foretold
its success in future years. The fact that he held a proprietary
interest in Virginia would not justify the cynical belief that he
looked upon it as a mere mercantile speculation; we may credit
him with an unselfish desire to extend the dominions and the
power of his country, at the same time that he hoped to profit by
the results of a venture in which he had sunk &#163;40,000 in
days when money was very scarce in England. Banks, on the other
hand, had no commercial objects of his own in view when he
proposed the colonisation of New South Wales, and therefore his
position in the matter, from first to last, was wholly free from
the suspicion of self-seeking. The two men might be taken as
types of their respective ages; each was an Englishman of the
heroic stamp, whose national instinct taught him to look beyond
the seas for the true source of his country's greatness. Banks
was born to rule; no one can look at the lion-like head and
figure of the man, as we see it in his portrait, without feeling
that nature destined him for a throne of some kind. The only
visible sceptre he held belonged to the world of science; his
realm was the Royal Society, over which he ruled like an absolute
monarch; but practically his influence extended far beyond its
boundaries. He took no active part in politics; and yet how
clearly his political power shows itself in a few lines written
by him on a loose sheet of paper, which still lies among his
manuscripts:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I could not take office and do my duty to the colony,
my successor would naturally oppose my wishes; I prefer therefore
to be friendly with both sides.<br>
<br>
Feb., 1789.</blockquote>
<p>Whether these lines formed portion of a private letter, or
were written in reply to some offer of Ministerial office, it is
impossible to say. Lord Hawkesbury was appointed President of the
Council of Trade and Plantations in 1786, and the office may have
been offered to Banks on account of his peculiar qualifications
for it. The reason he gives for his refusal is very suggestive;
he "could not do his duty to the colony" if he were to take
office&#8212;in other words, he looked upon his duty to it as a
father looks upon his responsibility for a child. If he took
office in one administration, he would not be able to exercise
any influence when another came into power; and as the laws of
party government required that each new Minister should oppose
the wishes of his predecessor, he felt bound to keep out of any
political complications that threatened to restrict his means of
doing good at Botany Bay. So completely have these passages in
his life been forgotten that they reveal themselves now, to one
who reads his unpublished correspondence, like the meaning of an
ancient manuscript. Among the many illustrations that might be
given for the same purpose, we may content ourselves for the
present with a letter to his friend Captain Bligh, in which he
offers him the government of the colony. It was written on March
15, 1805:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>My dear sir,&#8212;An opportunity has occurred this
day which seems to me to lay open an opportunity of being of
service to you and as I hope I never omit any chance of being
useful! to a friend whom I esteem as I do you I lose not a minute
in apprising you of it.<br>
<br>
I have always since the first institution of the new colony at
New South Wales taken a deep interest in its success and have
been constantly consulted by his Majesty's ministers through all
the changes there have been in the department which directs it
relative to the more important concerns of the colonists.<br>
<br>
At present King the Governor is tired of his station and well he
may be so he has carried into effect a reform of great extent
which militated much with the interest of the soldiers and
settlers there he is consequently disliked and much opposed and
has asked leave to return.<br>
<br>
In conversation I was this day asked if I knew a man proper to be
sent out in his stead one who has integrity unimpeached a mind
capable of providing its own resources in difficulties without
leening on others for advice firm in discipline civil in
deportment and not subject to whimper and whine when severity of
discipline is wanted to meet [emergencies]. I immediately
answered as this man must be chosen from among the post-captains
I know of no one but Captain Bligh who will suit but whether it
will meet his views is another question.<br>
<br>
I can therefore if you chuse it place you in the government of
the new colony with an income of &#163;2,000 a year and with the
whole of the Government power and stores at your disposal so that
I do not see how it is possible for you to spend &#163;1,000 in
truth King who is now there receives only &#163;1,000 with some
deductions and yet lives like a prince and I believe saves some
money but I could not undertake to recommend any one unless
&#163;2,000 clear was given as I think that a man who undertakes
so great a trust as the management of an important colony should
be certain of living well and laying up a provision for his
family.<br>
<br>
I apprehend that you are about 55 years old if so you have by the
tables an expectation of 15 years' life and in a climate like
that which is the best I know a still better expectation but in
15 years &#163;1,000 a year will at compound interest of 5 per
cent, have produced more than &#163;30,000 and in case you should
not like to spend your life there you will have a fair claim on
your return to a pension of &#163;1,000 a year.<br>
<br>
besides if your family goes out with you as I conclude they would
your daughters will have a better chance of marrying suitably
there than they can have here for as the colony grows richer
every year and something of trade seems to improve I can have no
doubt but that in a few years there will be men there very
capable of supporting wives in a creditable manner and very
desirous of taking them from a respectable and good family.<br>
<br>
Tell me my dear sir when you have consulted your pillow what you
think of this to me I confess it appears a promising place for a
man who has entered late into the status of a post-captain and
the more so as your rank will go on for Phillip the first
Governor is now an admiral holding a pension for his services in
the country.</blockquote>
<p>Every paragraph in this letter deserves to be studied, for the
light it throws upon the history of the time as well as on the
character of the man who wrote it. How large a share he had in
the actual government of the colony becomes obvious when we find
him offering the appointment of Governor to one of his friends
and fixing the salary of the office. The conversation referred to
probably took place with Viscount Castlereagh, who administered
the Colonial and War Department in 1805, Pitt being then a second
time Prime Minister. Bligh's adventures in the character of a
Governor have a new source of interest for us in the fact that he
was selected by Banks as the most capable man of his class for a
position which he failed so conspicuously to maintain.<br>
<br></p>
<p align="center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br>
<br></p>
<blockquote>The gentleman being gone, and Dr. Johnson having left
the room for some time, a debate arose between the Rev. Mr.
Stockdale and Mrs. Desmoulins, whether Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander
were entitled to any share of glory from their expedition [with
Cook in the Endeavour]. When Dr. Johnson returned to us, I told
him the subject of their dispute. <small>JOHNSON</small>: "Why,
sir, it was properly for botany that they went out; I believe
they thought only of 'culling of simples.'" <a href="#note-025"
name="noteref-025" id="noteref-025">{18}</a></blockquote>
<p>If Banks went out only for culling of simples, assuredly no
man ever came back with such results to show for his journey.
Even Johnson's Dictionary looks a very small performance when
placed beside the map of Australia.</p>
<p>The wonderfully small views of great things which the Dr.
could take when it pleased him to do so, is shown in another
conversation about the great voyages. During the preparations for
Cook's second expedition, the "share of glory" obtained by Banks
and Solander seems to have excited the ambition of many
others&#8212;among them being Johnson himself:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><small>BOSWELL</small>: "Had not you some desire to
go upon this expedition, sir?"<br>
<br>
<small>JOHNSON:</small> "Why, yes; but I soon laid it aside. Sir,
there is very little of intellectual, in the course. Besides, I
see but at a small distance. So it was not worth my while to go
to see birds fly, which I should not have seen fly; and fishes
swim, which I should not have seen swim."</blockquote>
<p>There was a third party, it seems, who was entitled to a
"share of glory" from the great expedition, and whose claims were
frankly admitted by the Dr.&#8212;as appears from a letter he
wrote to Banks on the subject:&#8212;</p>

</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> reading the evidence given by Banks before
the Committee, it is not pleasant to find him identifying himself
so readily with. the proposal to establish a penal settlement at
Botany Bay. He made no remonstrance against it when examined on
the subject; nor did he express any preference for colonising
with free settlers at that or any other time. We may easily
believe that, if the Government had adopted the proposal for
sending out the American loyalists, he would have been at least
equally pleased; but there is no ground for supposing that he saw
any objection to the substitution of convicts, still less that
his moral instinct revolted against it. While, however, we feel
surprise and disappointment when a man of his character becomes
conspicuous among the patrons of a system which is now
universally detested, it should not be forgotten that his views
on the subject were not so much his own as those of the age in
which he lived. It is not just to condemn even the foremost men
of their time because they were not in advance of it. They must
be judged by the recognised standards of their day, not by those
of our own. All through the eighteenth century, the
transportation system flourished in the sunshine of public and
parliamentary opinion. The only protests against it came from the
American colonists, who not only saw but felt its hideous
iniquity; but their remonstrances were never heard in
England&#8212;or if heard were never listened to. Like the cries
of India that Burke spoke about in 1783, they were "given to seas
and winds, to be blown about over a remote and unhearing ocean."
The feeling that ran through the colonies on this subject has
been so carefully excluded from modern history that its existence
has been forgotten; but if evidence of it is required, it may be
seen in a letter from one of the colonists which appeared in a
history of New York written in 1756&#8212;see p. 556. They were
made to feel the bitter degradation involved in the system, not
only in the revolting spectacle of chain-gangs marching through
their streets, but in the scornful estimate of American society
held by all classes in the mother country. The long list of
offences charged against King George in the Declaration of
Independence did not contain any mention of the wrong he had done
in flooding the colonies with criminals; but the sense of injury
and the deep-seated resentment which had been burning in the
hearts of the colonists for a century, may well be reckoned among
the causes which led to their rebellion; just as the
discontinuance of the system on the outbreak of war was assuredly
counted among the greatest gains derived from it.</p>
<p>A year before the war broke out, Burke warned the House of
Commons against "the fierce spirit of liberty" that had grown
with the growth of the colonists, and increased with the increase
of their wealth. It was aptly described as fierce; and what could
be more calculated to make it so than the sight of slaves and
convicts landed year after year on their shores from English
ships?</p>
<p>But while Banks may not have seen any reason to quarrel with
the transportation system in itself, it is surprising that he
should have indorsed a proposal to plant a colony of
felons&#8212;to use the words of the Committee&#8212;in a distant
part of the globe, in the expectation that they would be able to
maintain themselves, after the first year, with little or no aid
from the mother country. His technical knowledge of plants and
his experience as a farmer would, one would suppose, have enabled
him to see the danger of such an undertaking. But it does not
appear that he gave any attention to that view of the question,
either in his evidence before the Committee, or in the advice he
subsequently gave the Government when the expedition under
Phillip was being put together. In that respect he was not at all
singular, for nobody seems to have given the matter any
consideration. It was taken for granted that the colony would
require nothing more than a year or two's supply of salt
provisions to start it on a career of successful agricultural
industry. Phillip was placed under peremptory instructions to see
to the cultivation of the land immediately after his arrival; but
the means put in his hands for the purpose were ludicrously
inadequate. Nearly all the seed sent out proved useless for
cultivation; the agricultural tools were of the kind usually sent
out for barter on the Gold Coast; and when it came to actual
operations in the field, Phillip could hardly find a man who had
any knowledge of farming. The result was that, when the salt
provisions began to fail, death by starvation threatened every
one in the place. They escaped that fate simply through the
prudent management of Phillip, who stood to his post like a Roman
sentry through years of crushing anxiety.</p>
<p>There is another view of the matter that deserves to be
considered. It is hard to believe that Banks could have been
blind to the folly of supposing that a settlement so formed could
possibly become self-supporting after a year or two; or so
inhuman as to shut his eyes to the inevitable result if it did
not. Making every allowance for his confidence in the natural
resources of the country, a moment's thought should have
satisfied him that the success of the expedition was at least
problematical; if there was a fair chance of success, there was
an equal risk of failure; and in the event of any disaster
overtaking it, the consequences would be fatal not only to the
felons&#8212;whose fate perhaps was regarded with
indifference&#8212;but to the officers and men of the military
and civil establishments, with the wives and children dependent
on them. Considerations of this kind could hardly fail to present
themselves to a man who felt his responsibility for the part he
had taken in the business&#8212;one who was neither a dreamer nor
a theorist, nor yet a politician harassed out of his peace of
mind by a public question he was wholly unable to deal with. At
this point, then, one of two things may be supposed to have
happened. Either he consulted the Minister in order to satisfy
himself about the arrangements that were being made to ensure
success; or else he relied so implicitly on the necessary
measures being adopted by the Government that he did not attempt
to offer his advice at that stage. It is not difficult to imagine
the result of a conversation between him and Sydney on such a
topic. He would have been laughed out of his anxiety by the
genial Minister, who would have assured him that every possible
precaution was being taken to make the scheme a success. He
himself had enough to do in drawing up the official documents;
but there was Nepean&#8212;the permanent Under Secretary&#8212;to
look after all the details; he could be trusted to see that the
men sent out were of the right sort&#8212; young able-bodied
fellows, such as the Committee had spoken of&#8212;and that they
were well supplied with the proper tools, seeds, and plants. Then
they had got a really good man in Phillip; they could safely
leave everything else to him; he would see that the settlement
became self-supporting in a year or two. That was the central
point of the whole scheme, and he would be made to understand
that from the day of their arrival at Botany Bay, everyone must
look for his support to the land, and not to the casks of
beef.</p>
<p>No conversation of that kind passed between Banks and the
Minister, simply because it did not occur to the father of the
colony that there could be any necessity for satisfying himself
about the management of affairs. The actual course of events at
that stage may be seen in the memoranda and letters written by
Phillip before the expedition left England&#8212;(pp. 37-53). The
anxious little Captain&#8212;he is described as a little man with
a "thin aquiline nose under a large cocked hat" (p.
498)&#8212;had no sooner received notice of his appointment than
he began to busy himself with the preparations for the voyage. No
such fleet had ever been got together before; nor had any captain
of a man-of-war ever found himself in charge of such a convoy.
Convict ships had crossed the Atlantic often enough; but there
was neither novelty nor romance about their movements. Phillip
was in charge of a large fleet, bound for a port into which only
one ship had sailed since the sun first shone upon its waters; he
had not only to navigate an unknown sea, but to found a colony
which he felt would one day become an empire. The sense of
responsibility that weighed upon him thrills through every line
he wrote about the great work he had in hand; and for four or
five months at least before he sailed, he rarely suffered a week
to pass by without a letter to the Minister or the Under
Secretary, touching the various points that required attention.
He racked his brains to provide against all possible
contingencies, especially against scurvy; for the six small
transports were crowded with convicts who had been hurried on
board in a shamefully neglected condition&#8212;so neglected that
Phillip was obliged to supply them. with clothing, and to borrow
soap from the marines in order that the men and women might be
well scrubbed before the ships put to sea&#8212;(pp. 43, 48, 49,
67, 490). Phillip believed in the virtue of soap and water. The
first blackfellow whom he captured and tamed in the colony was
put in a tub and scrubbed, while he and his officers stood by to
watch the process; but he did not care to preside at the
cleansing of seven hundred and fifty-six convicts covered with
rags and filth.</p>
<p>In the midst of all his anxious care and attention&#8212;which
embraced everything he could think of, from capital punishment
down to the "women's cloathes"&#8212;the most important point of
all never presented itself to his mind. In these days the founder
of a projected colony would probably ask for some information
about his colonists before he ventured to start on his
expedition; seeing that the success of it would entirely depend
on their capacity for colonising work. Agricultural labourers and
mechanics of all kinds would be required as soon as tents were
pitched; and if no such men were in the ships, starvation would
threaten the settlement on the one hand, and sickness from
exposure on the other. Obvious as these matters seem to be now,
they did not occur to Phillip until he was forced to think of
them when he began to direct farming and building operations at
Sydney Cove. He did not see the men and women placed under his
charge until the fleet reached Santa Cruz; he had not even seen a
list of their names and occupations. If he had known half as much
about them before he sailed as he knew in the first week or two
after he had landed, he would not have incurred the risk he did
without strenuous efforts to remedy a neglect that he would have
known to be fatal.</p>
<p>How is this oversight to be explained? The answer will be
found by looking at the transportation system as Phillip looked
at it. In his days it was an organised branch of the Government
service, and had been so for a century. Convicts of both sexes
were taken from the gaols, put on board the hulks, and shipped in
the transports to the American colonies, with as much official
supervision as letters and newspapers were sent through the post.
The persons sent to the colonies were supposed to be fitted for
the work to be done there; the very Act of Parliament which
authorised their transportation professed to enact it as a means
of supplying the great demand for labour among the colonists. The
men and women destined for Botany Bay were also supposed to be
selected in the same manner;&#8212;who could imagine that it
would be otherwise? If any doubt had been expressed on the
matter, it would have been set at rest by pointing to the success
of the American system. In the face of that experience, it is not
surprising if Phillip, like every one else, assumed that the
people placed on board his ships belonged to the proper class for
such a service.</p>
<p>Brought into contact with this system as he was for the first
time in his life, he did not see&#8212;it was hardly possible
that he should have seen&#8212;a broad distinction between the
method of dealing with convicts in the American colonies, and
that which was about to be established under his government.
Every convict transported across the Atlantic had been sold on
arrival to the highest bidder for the term of his sentence; and
as prices were regulated by values in the market, the people put
up for sale were usually worth buying. That was a substantial
check on the exportation of worthless material; but there was no
check of any kind when the stream was diverted to the South
Pacific; and the result was that no attempt was made to select
men and women of the kind recommended by Bacon&#8212;"gardeners,
ploughmen, labourers, smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen,
fowlers, with some few apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and
bakers." My lord Sydney never gave the matter a thought; neither
did his Under Secretary. The selection was left in the hands of
the gaolers, who picked out the men and women they wished to get
rid of. So that when Phillip came to know something of them, he
had to tell Sydney that more than fifty among them were disabled
by old age and disease before they left England; while very few
of the rest were of any use to him&#8212;(p. 297). That there was
less of accident than design in this matter may be suspected from
the fact that, notwithstanding Phillip's complaints, the very
next transport brought a number of women whom the Judge-Advocate
described as "loaded with the infirmities incident to old age"
(p. 278). How was Phillip to guard himself and the settlement
against such a wrong? There was nothing to arouse a suspicion in
his mind while he was in England; his faith in the efficiency of
the service was implicit. Banks was equally trustful and
confiding; so in fact was every one else. It is always so in
matters of administration; things get into a groove, which every
one takes to be the right one until a catastrophe happens, and
then every one pretends to be shocked.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> change which Banks brought about in public
opinion with respect to the climate, soil, and natural resources
of New South Wales cannot be thoroughly understood until we have
realised what that opinion actually was in his time. Until he
spoke on the subject, the general estimate of New
Holland&#8212;as it was then called&#8212;was unfavourable to the
last degree; and that this estimate extended throughout Europe is
evident from the fact that in an age when all the sea-faring
nations were particularly active in seeking new fields for
commercial operations, not one of them made any serious attempt
to establish trading posts on its shores&#8212;still less to
occupy the country. The Dutch settlements in Java and the Spanish
in Peru placed facilities for the purpose in the hands of their
merchants which would not have been neglected, if there had been
any tendency to believe in the prospect of commercial returns for
the enterprise. During the third quarter of the last century, the
French had begun to look to the South Seas as a promising field
for exploration if not for commercial ventures; but they, too,
were so possessed with the universal belief that New Holland was
not worth the cost of an expedition, that none was sent to it. It
seems to have been looked at in much the same light as we have
been accustomed to look at Africa&#8212;a sort of Dark Continent,
with a hot climate and a barren soil, peopled with miserable
savages, and incapable of being turned to any good account. The
general impression with respect to it, as a field for
colonisation, may be seen in the account which de Brosses gives
of it, when speaking of the different places in the South Seas
that might be occupied for that purpose. His object was to point
out the advantages that might be obtained by the establishment of
colonies in that part of the world, and consequently he had no
reason to depreciate the countries he described:</p>
<blockquote>New Zealand and Van Diemen's Land are too distant
[for colonising purposes], being situated towards the south pole
and altogether unknown. We do not quite know whether anything can
be expected from them. Landing is a very difficult matter on any
part of the coast of the great continent which our charts
delineate under the name New Holland. Its west coast is
obstructed by an endless number of little islands which lie off
it. The country near the sea is altogether sterile and bare; like
a new surface which the sea has recently left above the waves,
before the action of the sun and rain, and the successive
accumulations of the <i>d&#233;bris</i> of light vegetation, has
had time to form a soil sufficiently solid to give the plants and
trees the nourishment that nature usually gives them. Those
growing on the west coast look half dead. The country offered
nothing to those who visited it that was at all curious, except a
kind of wood that might be useful for painters, being redder than
the sassafras of Florida, trees yielding a gum like dragon's
blood, and cockle shells of a singular beauty, of which there are
some so large that Dampier found an empty one weighing two
quintals and a half. The natives are thoroughly brutal, stupid,
incapable of work, and insensible to the advantages of trade.
<a href="#note-027" name="noteref-027" id=
"noteref-027">{20}</a></blockquote>
<p>This was the impression made upon the ablest geographer of his
time by a careful study of all the published voyages to the
country. Dampier's mark is legible in every line of the
description; and the accounts gleaned from the Dutchmen seem to
have tallied with everything that he had written on the subject.
The net result was that New Holland was pronounced unfit for
colonisation, and New Britain was recommended as the best
available field in the South Sea for the energies of French
emigrants&#8212;(p. 576). New Zealand and Van Diemen's Land were
looked upon as quite out of the question, principally because
they were situated so far south. The idea seems to have been that
the climate in those islands would be too severe for
Europeans&#8212;Mediterranean sailors would never go into higher
latitudes than they could help&#8212;and that the natural
products could not be worth the trouble of cultivation. Some
reason for that impression may be seen in Dampier's remark that
countries lying in such latitudes could not be compared with "the
Parts that lay nearer the Line, and more directly under the Sun."
Englishmen in his days still cultivated the superstitious belief
that all the wealth of the world was concentrated in tropical
countries&#8212; a belief which gave rise to the great
discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The
Portuguese struggled to reach India by an eastern route, and so
made their way round the Cape of Good Hope; while the Spaniards,
moved by the same ambition, sought to reach the same goal by
sailing west, and so passed through the straits of Magellan. Then
began the great contest among the maritime nations of Europe for
gold and spices. Long after Dampier's time, the trade with the
East was considered the richest of all trades; and the richest
part of it was the spices. It is not easy in the present day to
understand why such articles as cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs
should have been looked upon with eyes of envy by the merchants
of four great colonising nations. The massacre of the English by
the Dutch at Amboyna, in 1623, is a memorable proof of the
jealous spirit which prevailed among the nations on that subject.
The Dutch were regarded as the great monopolisers of the trade;
and they were supposed to have deliberately suppressed the
accounts of their explorations of New Holland, for the purpose of
concealing their discoveries and keeping all the nutmegs to
themselves.</p>
<p>The faith in spices as a source of national wealth flourished
down to the end of the last century. It shows itself in Matra's
proposal for colonising this country. "Part of it lies in a
climate parallel to the Spice Islands, and is fitted for the
production of that valuable commodity, as well as the sugar-cane,
tea, coffee, silk, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and the other
articles of commerce that have been so advantageous to the
maritime powers of Europe"&#8212;(p. 423). Thus he actually heads
the whole list of products with the spices, as if sugar, tea,
cotton, and tobacco were quite inferior articles. And as if that
was not enough, he returns to the subject in another paragraph in
which he refers to the Moluccas&#8212;then the principal seat of
the trade, carefully watched by the Dutch. "As part of New South
Wales lies in the same latitude as the Moluccas, and is even very
close to them, there is every reason to suppose that what nature
has so bountifully bestowed on the small islands may also be
found on the larger. But if, contrary to analogy, it should not
be so, the object is easily supplied, for as the seeds [of
spices] are procured without difficulty, any quantity may
speedily be cultivated"&#8212; (p. 426). Matra's example was
followed by Sir George Young, who gave it as his opinion that
"the country is everywhere capable of producing all kinds of
spice, likewise the fine oriental cotton, indigo, coffee,
tobacco, with every species of the sugar-cane; also tea, silk,
and madder"&#8212;(p. 430). Considering the great sagacity
displayed by both those men in their estimate of a country
practically unknown to the world of their time, it is a whimsical
fact that their predictions on the subject of the spice trade
still remain to be realised. Of all the products mentioned by
them, the cloves and nutmegs have hitherto made the smallest
show; every ounce of them consumed in the colony from the days of
Phillip having been grown for us by our old friends the
Dutch&#8212;the great purveyors of spices to mankind.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>IF</small> we now compare Matra's description of this
country&#8212;redolent as it is of spices and all manner of good
things&#8212;with the melancholy picture of it presented by de
Brosses less than thirty years before, we may ask&#8212;how is
this difference in opinion to be accounted for? The Frenchman was
not in any way interested in depreciating New Holland or any
other part of the <i>Terres Australes</i> as a field for
colonisation; we have seen that he wrote for the purpose of
stimulating his countrymen to form settlements in that part of
the world, wherever it could be done with any prospect of
success; and the chapter in which he expanded his ideas on the
subject had more to do with the colonisation that subsequently
took place than is usually suspected. It would be no answer to
say that Cook's account of his explorations brought about the
change in public opinion. Matra, it is true, quotes his Voyage,
but there is no resemblance between their accounts of the
country. The chapter in which its resources are summed up by
Hawkesworth is painfully cold and flat.</p>
<blockquote>It is upon the whole rather barren than fertile, yet
the rising ground is checquered by woods and lawns, and the
plains and vallies are in many places covered with herbage; the
soil, however, is frequently sandy, and many of the lawns, or
savannahs, are rocky and barren, especially to the northward,
where, in the best spots, vegetation was less vigorous than in
the southern part of the country; the trees were not so tall, nor
was the herbage so rich. The grass in general is high, but thin,
and the trees, where they are largest, are seldom less than forty
feet asunder; nor is the country inland, as far as we could
examine it, better clothed than the sea coast. The banks of the
bays are covered with mangroves, to the distance of a mile within
the beach, under which the soil is a rank mud, that is always
overflowed by a spring tide; farther in the country we sometimes
met with a bog, upon which the grass was very thick and
luxuriant, and sometimes with a valley, that was clothed with
underwood; the soil in some parts seemed to be capable of
improvement, but the greater part is such as can admit of no
cultivation. The coast, at least that part of it which lies to
the northward of 25&#176; S., abounds with fine bays and
harbours, where vessels may lie in perfect security from all
winds.</blockquote>
<p>There is no ground for complaint on the score of exaggeration
here. <a href="#note-028" name="noteref-028" id=
"noteref-028">{21}</a> No one who read the chapter could have
formed a high opinion of the country it described; and it is
certain that the general public were not at all impressed with
the notion that New South Wales was destined to be a great
colony. The fact that ten years passed by from the publication of
Hawkesworth's volumes to the date of Matra's pamphlet, without
any sign of a movement in the shape of colonisation, is enough to
show that the public mind had not even conceived an idea of that
kind. How the ordinary Englishman looked at the contents of those
quartos, while they were still fresh in the minds of men, may be
seen in Boswell's account of a conversation about
them:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><small>JOHNSON</small>: "A book may be good for
nothing; or there may be only one thing in it worth knowing; are
we to read it all through? These voyages (pointing to the three
large volumes of Voyages to the South Seas which were just come
out), <i>who</i> will read them through? A man had better work
his way before the mast than read them through; they will be
eaten by rats and mice before they are read through. There can be
little entertainment in such books; one set of savages is like
another." <a href="#note-029" name="noteref-029" id=
"noteref-029">{22}</a></blockquote>
<p>If the account of the great voyage made no deeper impression
on Dr. Johnson's mind than that, it is not likely that other men
would have seen much more in it than he did. And since the
exuberant ideas we find in Matra's sketch of the country are not
to be found in Hawkesworth, from what source of information were
they obtained? The only other source open to him was Sir Joseph
Banks; and it may therefore be inferred that the facts and
arguments which he urged on the attention of the Government were
derived from the conversations that had taken place between them.
Men in search of information about a particular country usually
consult those who can speak of it from their own personal
knowledge; and there can be no doubt that Matra had no sooner
made up his mind to develop his ideas in a practical form than he
betook himself to Banks, and obtained from the fountain-head the
hints which he afterwards developed in his sketch. Banks was a
traveller as well as a philosopher; he had sailed round the globe
when he was a young man of twenty-five; and as the pivot of the
whole scheme was a geographical one, he could have no difficulty
in foreseeing the substantial advantages that would ultimately
accrue from it to England. Conceive him, then, standing before a
map of the world and pointing out to Matra how, with a colony at
Botany Bay, England would be in a position to hold both her
enemies&#8212;the Dutch and Spaniards&#8212;in check; because she
could as easily threaten Timor, Batavia, and the Moluccas with
one squadron, as she could operate against Callao and the Spanish
merchant ships with another. They could not do any harm by
attacking the colony, because it could be secured against any
attack they might venture to make. That was a political
consideration which alone would justify the establishment of a
colony. The commercial advantages were not less obvious; because
another glance at the map would show that, with a territory
comprising such a variety of climate, tropical and temperate, and
a soil producing the very richest vegetation, there could be no
room for doubt as to the results of colonisation. At this point.
Banks would naturally bring his varied botanical knowledge to
bear on the subject; all the plants known to commerce would be
enumerated, and the probability of their successful cultivation
in New South Wales would be demonstrated by the experience of
other countries lying in the same parallels of latitude.</p>
<p>Possibly there was a good deal of tropical luxuriance about
his eloquence on this subject which&#8212;to minds not touched
with Matra's enthusiasm&#8212;might have suggested the idea of a
traveller's love of exaggeration; but no one doubts now that he
spoke truthfully as well as prophetically. Phillip confirmed
every word he said when writing a few months after his arrival at
Sydney Cove&#8212;(p. 338):&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The climate is equal to the finest in Europe, and we
very seldom have any fogs. All the plants and fruit-trees brought
from the Brazil and the Cape, that did not die on the passage,
thrive exceedingly well; and we do not want vegetables, good in
their kind, which are natural to the country.</blockquote>
<p>But long after Phillip's evidence on these points had been
published in English newspapers, the cynical spirit of disbelief
that has always hung like a cloud over the country met him
wherever he went. Ten years after the occupation of it had begun,
he told Governor Hunter that he had been "uniformly contradicted,
except by Governor Phillip" (p. 85), whenever he gave his opinion
about its soil and climate. There was some authority, too, for
the contradiction; for had not the Frenchmen, who dropped into
Botany Bay just as the First Fleet was sailing out of it, made it
known to the world that "in their whole voyage they nowhere found
so poor a country nor such wretched, miserable people"? (p. 33
n). How they would have ridiculed the idea, had it been mentioned
to them by Phillip's officers, of their coming to take possession
of such a place! They would not have taken it as a gift from his
Britannic Majesty&#8212;not even with all the convicts thrown in.
The volumes of their countryman de Brosses were on board their
ships; they had all read his description of New Holland and its
inhabitants; and they were prepared to indorse every word of it.
Even the poor natives had nothing to recommend them, although
they could whistle the air of <i>Malbrooke</i> as soon as they
heard it&#8212;(121 n).<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p><small>LET</small> us now turn for a few moments from the
geographers and the Frenchmen to the artists, and endeavour to
ascertain what they thought of the country which others held in
such little account. Men who form their notions of the earth from
poring over maps and charts, or twirling a globe on its pivot,
are not usually men of imagination; and no one would expect to
meet with poetic descriptions of scenery in French voyages of
discovery. English artists, on the other hand, are usually
credited with the intuitive perceptions of genius when they take
the field in search of landscapes; and in their written accounts
of a new country, visited in the interests of their art, we
expect to find, at the very least, some freedom from prejudice,
if not that glow of enthusiasm which men feel when their
imaginations are stimulated by beautiful scenery never seen
before.</p>
<p>On board the Endeavour there was a young artist, named Sydney
Parkinson, who had been engaged by Banks for the special purpose
of sketching all the picturesque and novel subjects they expected
to meet with in the course of their three years' voyage. He not
only took sketches but he kept a journal, which, after his death,
was published by his brother in a large quarto, "embellished", as
the title-page says, "with twenty-nine views and designs,
engraved by capital artists"&#8212;(p. 578). Out of the
twenty-nine embellishments, there is only one referring to this
country; and that represents "two natives of New Holland
advancing to combat"&#8212;the enemy being Cook and his landing
party at Botany Bay. Two illustrations were supplied to Cook's
Voyage&#8212;one being a view of the Endeavour River, with the
ship high and dry on the bank; and the other, a sketch of a
kangaroo. These productions may be taken to convey Parkinson's
opinion of this part of the world from a professional point of
view. The inference is that he did not see any scenery in New
South Wales worth sketching. What was he doing, one is inclined
to ask, during the eight days that he passed in Botany Bay? If he
could see nothing worth notice about the bay itself, he had only
to go in a boat up the two rivers running into it, in order to
find a succession of beautiful views lying before him. But it
does not appear that he went up the rivers at all; and as for the
bay, it seems to have made no sort of pleasant impression on
him.</p>
<p>There were two other artists on board the same
ship&#8212;William Hodges and James Webber&#8212;whose portfolios
were also published&#8212;(p. 595). The whole collection contains
only two drawings referring to this country, both of which were
studies of aboriginal life. One of them was painted in oil on a
piece of sail-cloth, while the ship was in the Endeavour River,
the artist having lost his materials when she struck the reef. No
attempt was made by these gentlemen to paint a landscape during
their stay on the coast; the only source of interest they found
in the country seems to have been the natives, whose
"bottle-noses" were immortalised by Dampier.</p>
<p>None of these artists having left on record any expression of
opinion with respect to the character of the scenery in this part
of the world, we can only look to their published sketches in
order to find out what they thought about it. If they had
considered it worth the trouble of reproduction with brush or
pencil, we may suppose that they would not have omitted any
opportunity in their way, seeing that they had undertaken a
perilous voyage of three years' duration for the purpose of
exercising their art in new fields. Their silence, therefore,
sufficiently indicates their judgment on the subject. That it
does so there can be no doubt; and the inference is confirmed by
the unhesitating statements of another artist, who came out some
years afterwards on an exactly similar mission.</p>
<p>When the Investigator sailed from England in 1801, under the
command of Matthew Flinders, who was commissioned to survey the
coasts of this country, she carried a draftsman named William
Westall, appointed by the Admiralty at the instance of Sir Joseph
Banks. What Westall thought of Australian scenery may be seen in
a letter to his patron accounting for his determination to visit
Ceylon and India for professional purposes, instead of returning
to England with the sketches he had taken in New Holland. It is
necessary to explain that the Investigator having been condemned
in Sydney Cove in 1803, before Flinders had time to accomplish
his work, he went on board the Porpoise as a passenger to
England. On his way through Torres Straits, the ship struck on a
reef; and Flinders returned to Sydney in an open boat to obtain
assistance for the crew, who were left on the wreck to await his
return. The only vessel at the Governor's disposal&#8212;a little
schooner named the Cumberland, of twenty-nine tons&#8212;was
placed at his service; and in her he returned to the wreck, took
off the crew, and then sailed for England, putting in at Port
Louis on his way, where he was made prisoner by the French.
Westall seems to have left him at Sydney, and gone on board a
ship bound for China.</p>
<p class="blok" align="right">Ship Carron, Canton
River,          <br>
<br>
January 31, 1804.      </p>
<blockquote>Sir,<br>
<br>
As my returning to England direct for the purpose of executing
the sketches that were saved from the Porpoise must appear
absolutely necessary, I shall lay before you the principal
reasons that have induced me to take India in my route home.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to say the voyage to New Holland has not answered my
expectations in any one way; for though I did not expect there
was much to be got in New Holland, I should have been fully
recompensed for being so long on that barren coast by the
richness of the South Sea Islands which, on leaving England, I
had reason to suppose we should have wintered at, instead of Port
Jackson. I was not aware the voyage was confined to New Holland
only; had I known this, I most certainly would not have engaged
in a hazardous voyage where I could have little opportunity of
employing my pencil with any advantage to myself or my
employers.<br>
<br>
I mentioned these circumstances to Mr. Lance, and my desire of
going to Ceylon, a country where I could scarcely fail of
success, for the rich and picturesque appearance of that island,
every part affording infinite variety, must produce many subjects
to a painter extremely valuable. And as no painter has yet been
there, what I should acquire would be perfectly new and probably
interesting, from the island being one of the richest in India,
and lately acquired.<br>
<br>
Mr. Lance said that as I had so few sketches of New Holland,
there could be no necessity for my returning immediately to
England; that I had now an opportunity of going to India which I
ought by no means to lose; and if I did go he said he would
undertake (as he was very intimate) to make my excuses to you. I
cannot enough acknowledge the attention that gentleman has shown
me since my arrival in China (which increases my obligations to
you, for I believe Mr. Lance has been attentive to me merely
because I was by you appointed). What I have seen of the country
about Canton I am entirely indebted to him for; he has given me
letters from Mr. Drummond and the Committee to the Governors of
Ceylon, Penang, Madriz, and Bombay; and in short it is entirely
by his advice and direction that I did not immediately return
with the sketches, which, before I had seen him, I had fully
determined.<br>
<br>
These, sir, are the principal reasons that have determined me to
remain some time longer from England; knowing that it will be
very much more to my advantage (though against my inclination,
for I would rather return) going to Ceylon and the countries that
the East India Company have lately acquired, than to return with
subjects which, when executed, can neither afford pleasure from
exhibiting the face of a beautiful country, nor curiosity from
their singularity: New Holland in its general appearance
differing little from the northern parts of England.<br>
<br>
I have now, sir, nothing more to add except that, if I thought
you would be displeased that I do not return with the drawings
that are remaining, I would most certainly relinquish my design
of going to India, as I am bound by duty as well as inclination
to fulfil in every respect my engagements with yourself and the
Lords of the Admiralty.</blockquote>

WESTALL.      </small></p>
<p>Banks's face, when he read that letter, would have made quite
a nice study for Sir Joshua. The idea of an artist, specially
selected for the purpose, devoting three years to the work of
illustrating New Holland, and then declaring that he had seen
nothing to illustrate, seems excessively comic in the present
day; but Banks did not see anything funny about it. We may fancy
him reading Westall's letter over and over again, in the vain
effort to understand what it meant. Was it possible that, in the
whole extent of his voyage, from King George's Sound to Port
Jackson, thence to the Gulf of Carpentaria, thence to Timor, and
back to Sydney Cove, with all the excursions inland, Westall did
not see anything worth describing? "That barren coast"! "So few
sketches of New Holland"! Why, he does not even express a regret
for the loss of his sketches in the wreck; nor does he take the
trouble to send a list of those that were saved. Evidently, then,
he did not take the slightest interest in them, and did not
conceive it possible that any one else could do so.</p>
<p>If we turn over the leaves of the Voyage to Terra Australis,
written by Flinders, we can see what Westall had been about all
this time. In the first volume, there is a plate showing a View
from the south side of King George's Sound, where Flinders began
his survey; then there is another, showing the Entrance of Port
Lincoln, taken from behind Memory Cove; a third, in which he
gives a View on the North side of Kangaroo Island; and a fourth
contains a View of Port Jackson, taken from South Head. The
sketches in the second volume were taken on the north coast, and
are of much the same character as the others.</p>
<p>The Investigator was at anchor in Sydney Cove from May to
July, 1802&#8212;over two months, so that this extraordinary
artist, as he seems to us, had opportunity enough for studying
the scenery there. But he did not see any beauty in it&#8212;not
even in "our beautiful harbour"! His silence is quite as
suggestive as his innuendoes. He stood on the South Head, and
drew a hard outline of the port as it lay before him on a May
morning, with its little islands still as Nature made them; and
he seems to have considered that one such sketch was quite enough
to show people in England "the finest harbour in the
world"&#8212;as Phillip called it. No doubt he visited the
different coves in the ship's boat, and, like Judge-Advocate
Collins, was "struck with horror at the bare idea of being lost
in them"&#8212;(p. 153 n); they were all so much alike, then,
that no man could tell one from another&#8212; timbered down to
the water's edge, and with hardly a sign of habitation. Whether
he went up Middle Harbour, or up the Hawkesbury&#8212;which
Anthony Trollope, in 1871, pronounced a better piece of river
scenery than either the Rhine or the Upper Mississippi&#8212;we
don't know. Nor have we any idea whether he made an excursion
outside the boundaries of Sydney town. He must have heard enough
about the Blue Mountains to stimulate any imagination that was
not "duller than the fat weed that rots itself at ease at Lethe
wharf". For among the men he met there was George Caley&#8212;the
botanist sent out by Banks to collect for the Royal Gardens at
Kew&#8212;who was always moving about in search of specimens, and
who is still remembered by the famous repulse he met with among
the ranges; and there was the energetic young Ensign Barrallier,
equally eager to distinguish himself in exploration, and whose
ambition it was to be the first man across the Blue Mountains
into the unknown country beyond them. Governor King's celebrated
joke&#8212;sending Barrallier on an embassy to the King of the
Blue Mountains in order to detach him from the Corps&#8212;was
quite fresh when the Investigator returned to the Cove; and as
King took great interest in exploration, the conversation at his
table naturally turned on the mysterious mountains, the unknown
rivers, the wonderful harbours, the Mediterranean sea, and every
other physical feature of the country, as well as its peculiar
vegetation and the <i>grotesquerie</i> of its animal life. Could
any artist on his travels have wished for better guides?</p>
<p>Westall's indifference becomes doubly singular when we
recollect that all through his voyage he was in daily communion
with Flinders, whose devotion to his work reached its climax in
martyrdom." So devoted was he that the disappointment he endured
when forced by the state of his ship to discontinue his voyage
wrung these words from him:&#8212;"The accomplishment of the
survey was, in fact, an object so near my heart that could I have
foreseen the train of ills that were to follow the decay of the
Investigator, and prevent the survey being resumed&#8212;and had
my existence depended upon the expression of a wish&#8212;I do
not know that it would have received utterance." No exaggeration
there, for it is borne out by the melancholy record of his life.
But what a contrast it presents with Westall's letter! One man
prepared to sacrifice life itself if only he could accomplish the
great object of his ambition; the other absolutely too
indifferent to seek fitting subjects for his pencil!</p>
<p>The difference between the two men was simply this: the sailor
was a man whose genius led him instinctively to the work of
exploration, and who devoted himself to it, not for the sake of
profit or reward&#8212;he got neither&#8212;but because he loved
the work for its own sake, and saw in it a straight road to
immortality. The artist was nothing more than a commercial
gentleman, who knew too well that he could make neither money nor
reputation out of any Views of New Holland he might publish in
London. There was no market for them there, the British
public&#8212;with the exception of a few men like Banks and
Phillip&#8212;having no taste for colonial scenery. No wonder,
then, that he looked upon the wreck of the Porpoise as a happy
release, because it put an end to the dismal expedition he had
foolishly joined, and gave him a chance of getting away to
brighter scenes&#8212;Ceylon and India&#8212;where subjects of
intense interest in England, full of colour, life, and movement,
were waiting for the artist's touch.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p><small>THE</small> perverse tenacity with which Englishmen
generally have held on to their unpleasant impressions with
respect to this country, is one of the most conspicuous features
in its social history. It would not be too much perhaps to say
that it has hardly yet overcome the inveterate prejudice which,
originating in the gloomy accounts of its earliest explorers, led
one of the most speculative of Frenchmen in the last century to
pronounce it unfit for colonisation, and subsequently condemned
it to the dismal fate of a penal settlement, to be populated by
British I criminals for over half a century. Banks could find
only two men in his time to whom he could appeal for confirmation
of his own opinion in its favour; and the proportion of those who
believed in it to those who did not, increased at a very slow
rate for many years afterwards. Undoubtedly the publication of
Phillip's despatches did a great deal to justify all that Banks
had said; and the official volume in which they were given to the
world was probably published for the purpose of justifying the
Government in the eyes of the public, and pacifying the
unfriendly critics of their action. But there were other pens
besides Phillip's at work; and the accounts written by them for
the benefit of friends in England met with equal publicity and
were read perhaps with much more confidence. They related the
bitter experience of men whose sufferings, brought about by the
mismanagement of the Government, were invariably debited to the
unfortunate colony, for which in most cases they had nothing
better to say than the Israelites of old had to say for Egypt. It
was not unnatural that men trembling for their very existence
should feel nothing but despair in their hearts when they sat
down to describe the scene of their misery; and that they should
rail at the deceptive visions on which their fancy had been fed
in England of grassy meadows ready for the plough, where they
could see nothing but rocks and gum-trees; and of a land
abounding in the richest products of tropical islands, where no
better result than a miserable existence could be gained from the
most painful toil.</p>
<p>Long after that dreadful time had passed away, and when the
success of the colony was no longer a matter of uncertainty or
doubt, it still had to struggle against the gulf-stream of
depreciation which had always swept so strongly toward its
shores. The traveller who looks down from the summit of Mount
Gambier upon the dark-blue waters of the lake below, sheltered
from rude winds by terraced walls on which the grass grows as
smooth and green as on a lawn, may find it hard to realise the
fact that he stands on the edge of a volcano, and that the scene
of silent beauty on which he gazes was once a field of raging
oceanic fires. It is not less difficult for those who know the
colony only in its present stage to bring before the mind's eye
the period of what might be called its volcanic action&#8212;when
elemental forces were at work in constructing the materials of
its future wealth and greatness by the agency of hell-fire and
lava. Looking as we do now on great cities and cultivated fields,
marked by every sign of an enterprising and prosperous
population, we see no trace of the time when the only evidence of
civilised life was found in convicts' huts and soldiers'
barracks. With the exception of a few streets, roads, and public
buildings, every vestige of those times has disappeared from
view; and the antiquarian who seeks to reconstruct the city of
the dead finds his efforts baffled at every step of his
investigation. But for the literature of the old days&#8212;the
long forgotten books and newspapers, and the piles of buried
records on which the dust of a hundred years has settled
down&#8212;it would not be possible to form any accurate
conception of the ideas which prevailed about the colony
throughout the long period in which it was known to Englishmen as
Botany Bay, and when the name they gave it meant all that was
abominable in the eyes of decent people. There is no exaggeration
in the statement of a recent writer referring to this country as
it was known in England less than forty years ago:&#8212;"Most
people still thought of Australia as a vast desert, remarkable
only for containing a den of thieves and murderers, called
'Botany Bay'." <a href="#note-030" name="noteref-030" id=
"noteref-030">{23}</a></p>
<p>The "vast desert" which Englishmen used to summon up before
the mind's eye whenever Australia was mentioned, reminds one of
the picture which de Brosses had drawn of the country a century
before. The only essential difference between the two is that the
English sketch has a den of thieves and murderers in one corner
of it, while the French one has nothing but a few sickly trees to
relieve its dreariness. There was something in the shape of
evidence to support the popular impression in England, because
Sturt's theory about the great central desert had just been
published at the time referred to. He made his first acquaintance
with the interior when he entered the country watered by the
Macquarie, Bogan, and Darling, a drought of three years' duration
being then at its height. Looking day after day for well-watered,
grassy table-lands, and finding only plains that looked "dismally
brown", where "the emus, with outstretched necks, gasping for
breath, searched the channels of the river for water, in vain",
he came to the conclusion that the country he saw was unfit for
occupation&#8212;a desert that not even the natives would care to
penetrate. But every acre of it is now, and has been for many
years, under pastoral lease, roamed over by sheep and cattle in
thousands, notwithstanding its want of water in dry seasons; and
the distant banks of the Darling, far beyond the limit of his
exploration, have long since been connected with Sydney by the
rail and the telegraph.</p>
<p>In his last expedition, Sturt strove to reach the centre of
the continent, the great object of his ambition; but he was
driven back by the stony desert, of which he left such a terrible
picture that it filled the mind with an idea of hopeless
desolation&#8212;as if the interior of the country consisted of
nothing better than sandy plains and ridges, in which the only
sign of life to be met with was an occasional flock of birds or a
famished aboriginal. The desert that filled his heart with
despair in 1844 is no more dreaded now than the barren plains in
which he struggled during his first expedition. Speaking of the
place at which he camped for six months, and which he described
as "the only spot in that wide-spread desert where our wants
could have been permanently supplied", Favenc says:&#8212;"In the
ranges where Sturt spent his summer months of detention, there is
now one of the wonderful mining townships of Australia, where men
toil as laboriously as in a temperate zone; and the fires of the
battery and the smelting furnace burn steadily, day and night, in
sight of the spot where Poole [his second in command] lies
buried." <a href="#note-031" name="noteref-031" id=
"noteref-031">{24}</a> Fifteen years after Sturt met with the
disappointment which he felt so bitterly that he said, "I could
calmly have laid my head on that desert never to raise it again",
the draftsman of his expedition, McDowall Stuart, camped in the
centre of the continent, where he found grass and water in
abundance; and his track on a later expedition, in which he
succeeded in making his way to the shores of the Indian Ocean,
was afterwards followed in the construction of the great overland
line of telegraph connecting Australia with the rest of the
civilised world.</p>
<p>The prejudice in favour of the vast desert theory seems to
have been so confirmed in the minds of Englishmen, that it
continued to survive long after the results of later explorations
showed its unsoundness. Western Australia, in particular, was
regarded as almost unfit for settlement at any distance outside
Perth, although Grey in 1837 and Frank Gregory in 1861 had done
so much to show that good country is to be found there as well as
elsewhere. A singular illustration of the prevalent ideas may be
seen in a letter written by Sir William Denison from Sydney in
1857, in which he summarised the results of an expedition sent
out under A. C. Gregory, in 1855, for the purpose of discovering
traces of Leichhardt, and also exploring the country in the far
north. The line of exploration began at the mouth of the Victoria
River on the north-west coast, followed it up to its sources,
crossed the watershed, thence back to the dep&#244;t&#8212;from
which a fresh start was made eastward to the Roper; thence round
the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Gilbert; from which
the explorers travelled in a south-easterly direction homewards.
The journals kept during the expedition, which lasted sixteen
months, do not give much precise information about the nature of
the country traversed; but although the reports brought back were
not calculated to create a rush of stock-owners to the north,
they were not so discouraging as to prevent the gradual extension
of settlement which has since taken place. The exploration of the
Victoria proved the existence of good pastoral country in that
direction; and even if the Plains of Promise did not realise the
anticipations formed of them by their discoverer, they were at
least seen to be well fitted for occupation. Now let us see how
Denison described the results:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Last year, or rather in 1855, an expedition was sent
to explore the north-western part of the continent. The men
returned a few weeks ago, and the result of the information
obtained is, that Australia consists of a narrow belt of good
land to the south, east, and north, varying from, say, 250 miles
in width to 60. On the west coast the desert, which fills up the
whole interior, abuts on the coast. In fact, five-sixths of the
whole block of land is desert; yet we constantly hear people
talking of the destinies of this great continent as being similar
to those of America! The destinies of a dry, arid, unproductive
country, without rivers or means of internal communication, what
are they? The people who talk in this way can have a very slight
conception of the influence which water, and the means of water
communication, exercise upon the destinies, as they term it, of a
people.</blockquote>
<p>The tone of this letter is enough to show the state of mind in
which it was written. Denison was evidently pleased, as if he
felt that the result of the expedition had entirely confirmed his
own ideas on the subject. Australia was a desert, with just a
narrow strip of coast line fit for occupation. Even that was some
advance on Payne's account of the country&#8212;a vast desert,
with a den of thieves and murderers at Botany Bay. Denison knew
better than that, because he had been Governor of Van Diemen's
Land before he came on to Sydney in 1855. Still he had the
stereotyped English ideas on the subject, and "the people who
talked of their destinies" seemed to him in need of a little
caustic treatment. He could hardly have failed to see that
Gregory's observations did not even touch the question as to the
character of "the whole block of land". That could not be
answered even by a careful examination of all the explorations
made since the Blue Mountains were passed. We have only to follow
the track of each explorer upon the map in order to see how very
limited the range of observation was in each case; and then,
recollecting how much the result would necessarily depend on the
seasons, the equipment of the party, and the skill, judgment, and
experience of the leader, we can see how absurd it is to suppose
that any one expedition could be held to determine the character
of the unknown interior. It is not known even now, although the
light of thirty years' additional experience has been thrown upon
the subject; and it will not be known until the pressure of
population is felt here as it is felt in older countries.</p>
<p>Although he made no mention of them in his letter, the actual
facts of Gregory's expedition could not have been unknown to
Denison. At the time he wrote he was Governor of New South Wales,
and the report of an exploring expedition at that
period&#8212;sent out by his own Government&#8212;would
necessarily attract his attention. The peculiar representation of
the matter which he thought fit to circulate in England can not
be easily accounted for, unless we suppose that he was so much
influenced by preconceived opinions as to be unable to state the
case fairly. The letter he wrote in 1857 was published by him in
1870. <a href="#note-032" name="noteref-032" id=
"noteref-032">{25}</a></p>
<p>School children in England and the colonies are still taught
that "there are vast tracts in the interior of Australia which
are absolutely desert, and for ever doomed to remain without
inhabitants, these lying more to the west than to the east; and
there are other large tracts that can produce only a scanty
herbage fit for nothing but sheep-rearing, and in many cases not
to be depended on in all years for that." <a href="#note-033"
name="noteref-033" id="noteref-033">{26}</a> This
statement&#8212;evidently written by one who had no personal
knowledge of the country&#8212;is not based on the evidence of
recent explorers, but is a scientific deduction from the climatic
peculiarities of the country, and the resemblance which they are
supposed to bear to those of South Africa. Such a line of
argument can not be safely applied to this country. Experience
has shown that even actual observation is not always a reliable
guide to theoretic conclusions&#8212;Oxley and Sturt, for
instance, were both scientific observers, but each of them
propounded a theory about "vast tracts in the interior", which
subsequent exploration proved to be a mere nightmare. They
overlooked two important considerations in estimating the
character and probable value of the country they criticised; one
being the effect of settlement on its physical features, and the
other, the existence of accumulated stores of water beneath the
surface. The nature and extent of the change brought about by
occupation of new country can be accurately measured by those
only who have witnessed it; and perhaps more remarkable proofs of
such changes could hardly be found than have frequently been seen
here. In the days when Oxley and Sturt rode through the interior,
like two Arab sheiks on the road to Mecca, men were only
beginning to learn the lessons which Nature had to teach them.
The sudden termination of large rivers in extensive marshes led
Oxley to conclude that they discharged their waters into a great
inland sea&#8212;a theory which he supported with as much
confidence as if he had actually stood upon its shores. The
buried waters which he and many others sought to trace in vain
are now, after the lapse of seventy years, being brought to light
for the first time by the Artesian bore; and the experience of a
few years will probably serve to settle the vexed question of
physical geography which puzzled not only the explorer, but all
the philosophers of his time. <a href="#note-034" name=
"noteref-034" id="noteref-034">{27}</a></p>
<p>The progress of settlement in that portion of the interior
which not long ago was branded on the map as the Great Central
Desert attracts so little attention, even among ourselves, that
it is not surprising if it is wholly unknown beyond our own
borders. It is only by an accident, as it seems, that any
definite intelligence reaches us from the remote points occupied
as outposts by the invaders of the wilderness. While these pages
are being printed, a remarkable illustration of this fact
presents itself in the shape of a telegram from Euriowrie, a post
and telegraph station eight hundred and seventy miles north-west
of Sydney, announcing the arrival of a caravan of sixty-three
camels at Tibooburra a few days before, laden with goods for
Euriowrie and Queensland. "They formed quite a procession through
the town, each fastened by a gaily coloured cord in single file,
the Afghan drivers being gorgeously attired in many coloured
silks, shawls, gold lace, and turbans. The team has been
thirty-six days coming from Farina on the trans-continental
railway, and only one beast was lost on the trip of three hundred
and fifty-five miles." A glance at the map will show that this
Oriental substitute for the old bullock-team travelled through
the country penetrated by Eyre in 1840, when he reached the
summit of Mount Hopeless, and by Sturt in his famous journey of
1844-5, when he discovered Cooper's Creek. Each of those
adventurous explorers, whom no difficulty or danger could deter,
returned in despair from the scene of desolation that lay before
him. Now we have a trans-continental line of railway from
Adelaide to Port Darwin in course of construction through the
heart of it. Farina being one of its stations&#8212;four hundred
and seven miles north from the starting point, and near the range
from which Eyre looked round him, in vain, to find some means of
crossing Lake Torrens to the unknown country beyond it.</p>

whether the charge of exaggeration reference to the published

it. His preface says that the manuscript was read over to Cook
before it was published, and was approved of by him. That he was
not pleased with his editor's work may be suspected from the fact
that the title page of the account of his second voyage states
that it was "Written by James Cook".</p>

the blacks with their spears do it? The argument seemed
conclusive; and yet we know now that the interior carried a large

<h3>1.1 PROPOSALS FOR COLONISING NEW SOUTH WALES.
<small>[1783]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>AMONG</small> the various documents relating to New
South. Wales preserved in the Public Record Office in London,
there are two remarkable papers in which the writers submitted
their views to the Government of the day for the colonisation of
the territory discovered by Captain Cook. Looking at them in the
light of contemporary history, it will be seen that they form
distinct links in the chain connecting the expedition of 1787 to
Botany Bay with the great historical events of preceding years.
The first of these papers, which bears date August 23rd, 1783,
was written by a gentleman named James Maria Matra, who, though
now wholly unknown, appears from his correspondence to have been
a man of some note in the political world of his time. He is
entitled to the credit of having made the first formal proposal
for the colonisation of New South Wales; and there is little
doubt that, although the project he submitted to the
Government&#8212;the Coalition Government of Fox and Lord North
was then in power&#8212;was not adopted in its original form, the
ultimate scheme carried out by the Pitt Ministry was elaborated
from the materials which he had put together.</p>
<p>From a letter addressed by Matra to Evan Nepean, <a href=
"#note-035" name="noteref-035" id="noteref-035">{1}</a> the Under
Secretary for the Home Department, in October, 1784, it appears
that his proposal had been formally laid before the Government.
He said:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>You will therefore do me a particular pleasure if, to
the great trouble you have already taken in pushing forward this
business for me, you would be so obliging as to tell me if the
Ministry have come to a decided resolution to reject the plan; or
if there be any chance of its being entered on in the spring
season.</blockquote>
<p>It also appears from a note appended to his paper that Matra
had been in personal communication on the subject with Lord
Sydney, <a href="#note-036" name="noteref-036" id=
"noteref-036">{2}</a> who expressed an opinion to the effect that
the new territory would be a suitable place for convicts. "When I
conversed with Lord Sydney on this subject, it was observed that
New South Wales would be a very proper region for the reception
of criminals condemned to transportation." This intimation of his
lordship's views led Matra to add some suggestions on that point;
but he had not made any reference to it in his original
sketch.</p>
<p>From another letter written by Matra to Nepean, it appears
that Pitt's Attorney-General, Pepper Arden, had also been
consulted in the matter, and that he had been supplied with some
further information about the sailing route of the China
ships&#8212;"the only difficulty"&#8212;added Matra&#8212;"I can
think of in the way of the South Sea scheme."</p>
<p>The repeated and emphatic reference to Sir Joseph Banks, which
appears in the course of Matra's paper, shows that the
distinguished naturalist had signified his approval of it in
strong terms. It may be inferred that his personal influence with
the Government, which was very great, had been exerted in favour
of the project, and it was undoubtedly at his suggestion that
Botany Bay was selected as the field of operations when it was
resolved to colonise New South Wales. Thirteen years had passed
since he had collected his botanical specimens about the shores
of the bay, and during that time no movement had been made for
the occupation of the country; although he had given strong
evidence in favour of it before a select committee of the House
of Commons in 1779.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government having remained in office only a few
months&#8212;from April to December, 1783&#8212;it is not
probable that any colonising project, however sound in itself,
could have met with much consideration in the midst of the
political uncertainties which surrounded the Cabinet. On the
formation of Pitt's administration, Matra seems to have renewed
his negotiations on the subject, and pressed the matter on the
attention of Lord Sydney. It was referred by the Minister to Lord
Howe, <a href="#note-037" name="noteref-037" id=
"noteref-037">{3}</a> the First Lord of the Admiralty, for his
opinion of it, and the Admirals ideas were communicated
immediately afterwards in a remarkable letter to his lordship,
dated 26 December, 1784:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I return, my dear lord, the papers you left with me
to-day, which are copies only of the former sent to me on the
same subject on Friday evening.<br>
<br>
Should it be thought advisable to increase the number of our
settlements on the plan Mr. Matra has suggested, I imagine it
would be necessary to employ ships of a different construction,
Frigates are ill-adapted for such services. I conceive that ships
of burthen to contain the various stores, provisions, implements,
&amp;c., wanted for the first colonists meant to be established
there, and composing the chief part of the company of the ship,
should be provided for the purpose; though an armed vessel of
suitable dimensions might be previously appointed to inspect and
fix on the preferable station for forming the intended
establishment.<br>
<br>
The length of the navigation, subject to all the retardments of
an India voyage, do not, I must confess, encourage me to hope for
a return of the many advantages, in commerce or war, which Mr.
Matra has in contemplation.</blockquote>
<p>The scheme being thus questioned by the Admiralty, no further
action appears to have been taken with respect to it. It seems
probable, however, that Matra, not satisfied with Lord Howe's
unfavourable opinion of his project, determined to seek another
channel for it, and for that purpose placed himself in
communication with Sir George Young, who is described in a letter
from Pepper Arden, the Attorney-General, to Lord Sydney, as "of
the navy". <a href="#note-038" name="noteref-038" id=
"noteref-038">{4}</a> He appears to have thoroughly sympathised
with Matra's ideas on the subject; his experience in the navy
leading him to appreciate the prospective importance of a colony
in the South Sea to the commerce as well as the naval power of
the mother country. Guided by this experience, he prepared a
condensed edition of Matra's proposals, presenting them in a
shape somewhat more consistent with official views on the subject
of colonisation. His plan was introduced to Lord 1786 Sydney's
notice in a letter from Pepper Arden, dated 13th January, 1785,
in the course of which he said,&#8212;"Lord Mansfield mentioned
the subject to me, and desired Sir George Young would call upon
me to explain his ideas."</p>
<p>Although there is no express allusion in Sir George's paper to
Matra's proposals, no one can compare the two documents without
seeing that the one formed the basis of the other&#8212;the only
essential difference between them being that Sir George Young's
sketch presented a condensed, and in some respects a more
practical view, of the subject. The identity of the two schemes
may be shown by analysing the arguments used by the two writers,
and comparing them one with another. Briefly stated, those relied
upon by Matra were as follows:&#8212;</p>
<p>1. The proposed colony of New South Wales might 'in time atone
for the loss of the American colonies.'</p>
<p>2. The new territory offered almost every conceivable
inducement to colonisation. "The climate and soil are so happily
adapted to produce every various and valuable production of
Europe and of both the Indies that, with good management and a
few settlers, in twenty or thirty years they might cause a
revolution in the whole system of European commerce, and secure
to England a monopoly of some part of it, and a very large share
in the whole."</p>
<p>3. The colony might afford an asylum for the American
colonists who had remained loyal and had suffered for their
loyalty to the Crown during the war. These settlers might be
expected to form the basis of the future population of New South
Wales. The proposal for its settlement had met with the approval
of many Americans of that class, who had been consulted on the
subject with a view to their taking part in it.</p>
<p>4. The expense of founding a settlement as proposed need not
exceed &#163;3,000. It would be sufficient, in the first
instance, to despatch two ships of the peace establishment with
two companies of marines and about twenty artificers, "who are
all the emigration required from the parent State." These men
could be left at the new settlement to prepare for the reception
of the intended settlers. The ships could take in a supply of
live stock, seed, and fruit-trees at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>5. One of the ships might be despatched from the colony to New
Caledonia, Otaheite, and the neighbouring islands, "to procure a
few families thence, and as many women as may serve for the men
left behind."</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Banks was of opinion that "any number of useful
inhabitants" might be drawn from China, "agreeably to an
invariable custom of the Dutch in forming or recruiting their
Eastern settlements". <a href="#note-039" name="noteref-039" id=
"noteref-039">{5}</a></p>
<p>6. The proposed colony would improve the trade with China, and
open up commercial intercourse with Japan, Korea, and the
Moluccas. The timber and flax of New Zealand might become
articles of commerce, of great importance to the naval interests
of England. "There is also a prospect of considerably extending
our woollen trade."</p>
<p>7. "Those who are alarmed at the idea of weakening the mother
country by opening a channel for emigration "might console
themselves by reflecting that "it is more profitable that a part
of our countrymen should go to a new abode where they may be
useful to us, than to the American States."</p>
<p>8. The geographical position of New South Wales might give it
"a very commanding influence in the policy of Europe." In the
event of war with Holland or Spain, it would furnish England with
a naval station of the greatest value.</p>
<p>9. The common apprehension of danger resulting to the mother
country from voluntary emigration was not a matter for serious
consideration, when viewed in connection with the commercial and
political advantages to be derived from it.</p>
<p>10. Convicts might be transported to the new territory under
much more favourable circumstances as regards expense and other
practical considerations, than to any other country, and with far
greater opportunities for their ultimate reformation.</p>
<p>Such was Matra's line of argument. Sir George Young sketched
the prospective advantages of the settlement in the following
form:&#8212;</p>
<p>1. The geographical position of the country placed it within
easy communication with the Spanish settlements in South America
on the one hand, and with China, the Spice Islands, and the Cape
of Good Hope on the other. The facilities for extensive trade
thus disclosed were not all; for should war break out between
England and Spain, English ships would then have the immense
advantage of a great naval station in the South Sea.</p>
<p>2. The variety of soil and climate comprised within the
territory would enable the colonists to produce almost all the
products known to the commerce of European nations,&#8212;"not to
mention the great probability of finding in such an immense
country metals of every kind."</p>
<p>3. The settlement of "a territory so happily situated" would
not only lead to the establishment of "a very extensive
commerce", but would "greatly increase our shipping and number of
seamen". In addition to many other products, the New Zealand flax
plant might be largely cultivated, and by that means the English
navy might be rendered independent of Russia for its supply of
cordage and canvas.</p>
<p>4. The settlement of the country would not tend to "depopulate
the parent State", as the settlers would be principally collected
from the Friendly Islands and China; the only men required from
England being a few skilled workmen, who might be drawn from the
ships sent out on the service.</p>
<p>5. The American colonists who had been loyal to the Crown in
the War of Independence would find in New South Wales "a fertile,
healthy soil, far preferable to their own", where they might be
established "with a greater prospect of success than in any other
place hitherto pointed out for them."</p>
<p>6. The expense involved in carrying out this plan could not
exceed &#163;3,000, seeing that ships-of-war might be as cheaply
fed and paid in the South Sea as in the British Channel.</p>
<p>7. The expense of transporting felons might be considerably
reduced by sending them to the new territory, while the danger of
their returning from it would be much less than in the case of
other countries. The transportation might be cheaply carried out
by means of the China ships of the East India Company, which, by
altering their route after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, might
land the felons on the coast of New South Wales, and then proceed
to their destination.</p>
<p>While the identity of these schemes is obvious, it is not less
clear that they formed the starting-point of the expedition
subsequently sent out. Although it assumed a very different shape
when actually executed, we have only to read Lord Sydney's letter
to the Treasury of the 18th August, 1786, <a href="#note-040"
name="noteref-040" id="noteref-040">{6}</a> and the instructions
to Governor Phillip on his departure, to see that the whole
scheme, modified, as it was, by the exigencies of the
transportation question, originated in the plan formulated by
Matra and revised by Sir George Young. Very little is said in the
official documents with reference to the commercial or political
advantages so forcibly urged by those gentlemen; the whole
project had apparently dwindled down to a plan for ridding the
country of its surplus criminals. Matra's idea was that the
colony might be settled by the unfortunate loyalists scattered
throughout the American colonies, who were at that time looking
out for new homes. As it turned out, none of them emigrated to
New South Wales; the expedition to Botany Bay was composed
exclusively of convicts, with the military and civil officials
required to govern them. The official instructions to Governor
Phillip embodied two or three of Matra's suggestions&#8212;the
cultivation of the New Zealand flax plant, and the despatch of a
ship to the islands for the purpose of procuring women; but
curiously enough, these suggestions were the only points of his
project which proved impracticable. The flax plant was never
cultivated in any part of New South Wales, and never realised the
anticipations formed of it, even in Norfolk Island. Nor did
Phillip make any attempt to bring women from the islands, knowing
that "it would answer no other purpose than that of bringing them
to pine away in misery." The proposal was a worse than
thoughtless one.</p>
<p>But although the schemes elaborated by Matra and Sir George
Young were not officially adopted by the Government, they appear
to have been subjected to further revision at the hands of
officials, the result being seen in the shape of a paper, without
name or date, entitled&#8212;"Heads of a Plan for effectually
disposing of convicts, by the establishment of a colony in New
South Wales." <a href="#note-041" name="noteref-041" id=
"noteref-041">{7}</a> In this plan we find the details of the
expedition to Botany Bay foreshadowed with remarkable precision.
All mention of free settlers has disappeared, and from first to
last the project is confined to a proposal for "effectually
disposing of convicts". That these "heads of a plan" were drawn
up by some one in the confidence of the Government is shown by
the fact that, in his letter to the Treasury of the 18th August,
1786, and also in his subsequent letter to the Admiralty, in
which instructions were given for the equipment of the
expedition. Lord Sydney made special reference to the
paper:&#8212;"I enclose to your lordships herewith the heads of a
plan upon which the new settlement is to be formed." A review of
the records on this subject seems to show that in the interval of
three years which elapsed between the date of Matra's project and
the letters referred to, the proposals for colonising Now South
Wales had been subjected to several processes of revision,
resulting in the plan finally adopted.</p>
<p>It is evident that the plans proposed to the Government were
drawn up under very different influences from those which finally
determined the matter. Both Matra and Sir George Young pointed to
the American loyalists as the proper men to send out to New South
Wales; they were practical settlers, accustomed to the struggles
of colonial life, and they were entitled to the assistance of the
Government in their search for new homes. But the Home Secretary
was not troubled about the loyalists, while he was very much
troubled about the convicts. The hulks and gaols were crowded
with criminals condemned to transportation, and where were they
to be sent when the American ports were no longer open?</p>
<p>Although Matra's proposal was ultimately shaped so as to suit
the Minister's convenience, it is not possible to read his
long-forgotten essay without seeing how clearly, even in the dim
distance, the "heroic work of colonisation" occupied the
background of the picture which represents the departure of the
First Fleet for the shores of New South Wales. The mean
proportions which the scheme assumed in Sydney's hands should not
blind us to the fact that it originated in a desire to establish
free settlers in a new colony, under conditions which would
enable them to turn to account the great natural resources of the
country, not only to their own benefit but to that of the
nation.</p>
<p>Here he disappears from the page of history; but Sir 1793-8
George Young again becomes visible for a moment in the act of
presenting a little petition to Sydney:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>To the Right Honorable Lord Sydney, one, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The Petition of Sir George Young, Knight, and John Call, Esquire,
in behalf of themselves and others, sheweth,&#8212;that your
petitioners have it in contemplation to form a settlement on a
small uninhabited island, first discovered by Captain Cook and by
him named Norfolk Island, lying in the latitude 29&#176; 2'
south, and longitude 168&#176; 16' east from Greenwich, in the
Pacific Ocean; in order to promote the cultivation of the New
Zealand flax-plant, and the growth of pine timber for masts,
being persuaded that if they are fortunate enough to succeed in
their undertaking, it will be attended with great national
utility, by furnishing a future supply of those valuable
articles&#8212;cordage and masts&#8212;for his Majesty's
ships-of-war in India, which have hitherto been obtained at an
enormous expense owing to the difficulty of conveying them
thither, and from their scarcity have often reduced the maritime
force employed in the East Indies to great inconvenience and
distress.<br>
<br>
Your petitioners therefore, considering the great expence and
risque they must necessarily incur in prosecuting an enterprise
in which, if they succeed, the nation cannot fail of being
benefited, humbly solicit from his Majesty a grant to them and
their heirs for ever of the said island, to be held of the Crown
as of the Manor of East Greenwich.<br>
<br>
London, May 24th, 1788.</blockquote>
<p>The reticence which the Government had observed in connection
with their plans for colonising New South Wales may be seen in
the fact that even Sir George Young&#8212;who was in a position
to obtain information from official sources&#8212;was ignorant of
their intentions as regards Norfolk Island. At the time that he
presented his petition, Lieutenant King had been in occupation of
it for over three months; but Sir George had not even a suspicion
that instructions had been given to Phillip to hoist the British
flag there as soon as possible after his arrival.<br>

Nepean's name is frequently met with in the official
correspondence connected with the expedition to Botany Bay, and
the subsequent colonisation of New South Wales. His name was
given by Governor Phillip to the river Nepean on its discovery in
1789. He was Under Secretary when George the Third summarily
dismissed Fox and Lord North from office, on the 18th December,
1783, and was sent by the King with a verbal message to Lord
North, requiring him to send the seals of office to the Palace by
the hands of the Under Secretary. "It was one o'clock in the
morning, and Lord North had retired to rest with Lady North, when
Sir Evan Nepean knocked at his bed-chamber door, and desired to
see him on most important business. 'Then,' said the discarded
Minister, 'you must see Lady North too'; at the same time
intimating his determination not to get out of bed. Sir Evan
Nepean having accordingly been admitted and declared his errand.
Lord North delivered to him the key of the closet in which the
seals of office were kept, and then quietly turned round to sleep
again."&#8212;Jesse, Memoirs of George the Third, vol. ii, p.
448; Massey, Reign of George the Third, vol. iii, p. 209, note.
He was created a baronet in 1802; sat in the House of Commons,
was sworn of the Privy Council, and held the offices of Secretary
to the Admiralty and Chief Secretary for Ireland; being
subsequently appointed one of the Lords of the Admiralty and also
Governor of Bombay. He died in 1822.</p>

Post, p. 429.&#8212;Sir George Young was an officer of
distinction. He served at the taking of Louisburg in 1758, at
Quebec in 1759, at the Havannah in 1762, and at Pondicherry in
1778. He was an admiral of the White squadron, and died in 1810,
at the age of 78. Some confusion has existed between his name and
that of a contemporary, Sir George Yonge (pronounced Young), who
was Secretary of War in the Shelburne administration of 1782, and
subsequently in Pitt's. Among the despatches from the English
Government in 1792 may be seen a letter from Sir George Yonge
addressed to Governor Phillip, dated from the War Office, 24
July, 1792. Sir George's name appears in the list of Ministers
present at a meeting of the Privy Council, at which "the King's
Most Excellent Majesty" presided, and which was held at the Court
at St. James's, on the 10th December, 1786, "William Pitt, Esq.",
being also present. It was then ordered that a second captain
should be appointed to the "man-of-war that shall proceed with
the transport vessels appointed to convey the convicts to Botany
Bay", with power to command in the absence of the principal
captain. Captain Hunter was appointed second captain, Phillip
being the principal.</p>

The employment of Chinese in the settlement of new countries was
a familiar idea down to a much later period. Dr. Lang, for
instance, proposed a settlement of the kind for the cultivation
of the tea-plant "at one of the northern settlements of New South
Wales, as, for instance, at Port Macquarie ... The Dutch have
long been alive to the benefits likely to result to their nation
from the settlement of numerous families of Chinese in their
colonial territories. Chinese are very numerous in the city of

<h3>1.2 TRANSPORTATION AND COLONISATION.</h3>
<br>
<p>THE employment of convicts in the formation of new colonies, a
practice which probably originated in the ancient custom of
employing slave labour on public works, was a common one among
the colonising nations of Europe from the earliest times. By two
edicts issued in 1497, the Spanish Government authorised judicial
transportation of criminals to the West Indies, and gave certain
criminals the option of transporting themselves to Hispaniola
(St. Domingo) at their own expense, to serve for a specified time
under Columbus. The first Europeans who landed on the coast of
Brazil were two convicts, who were left ashore by the Portuguese
in 1500. <a href="#note-042" name="noteref-042" id=
"noteref-042">{1}</a> The commission given by the King of France
in 1540 to Jacques Cartier, or Quartier, as Captain-General on
his second voyage to Canada, authorised him to choose fifty
persons out of such criminals in prison as should have been
convicted of any crimes whatever, excepting treason and
counterfeiting money, whom he should think fit and capable to
serve in the expedition. Another French expedition to Canada,
which set sail in 1598 under the command of the Marquis de la
Roche, carried forty convicts who were left on the Isle of
Sables, about fifty leagues to the south-east of Cape Breton, for
the purpose of forming a settlement there. In the same manner.
Sir Martin Frobisher was supplied, by the Queen's order, with
certain "prisoners and condemned men" when he sailed in 1577 on
his second voyage "for the discoverie of a new passage to Cataya,
China, and the East India, by the North-west", and also for the
discovery of "golde mynes" among the icebergs. His instructions
directed him to "sett on land upon the coast of Friesland vi of
the condemned persons which you carie with you, with weapons and
vittualls such as you may conveniently spare, to which persons
you shall give instructions howe they may by their good behaviour
wyn the goodwill of the people of that country, and also learn
the state of the same." <a href="#note-043" name="noteref-043"
id="noteref-043">{2}</a> And lastly, the colonists sent out to
North America by the Government of Sweden in 1638, when Fort
Christina in Delaware was founded, were composed largely of
convicts from the prisons of Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>It was natural that this system, once introduced, should be
utilised for other purposes than that of laying the foundations
of new settlements. The difficulty of obtaining free settlers for
the work operated long after that stage in the history of a
colony had been passed; and as the demand for labour in the
colonies far exceeded the supply, the employment of prisoners
became a matter of practical necessity as well as one of State
policy.</p>
<p>This difficulty was aggravated by another influence which
operated largely in the same direction. Down to a comparatively
recent period, the various States of Europe, so far from
suffering from redundant populations, were harassed with the fear
of losing that portion of them which formed the main reservoirs
of their military strength. One result of this apprehension was a
settled aversion to the emigration of able-bodied men to new
countries, on the ground that it tended to depopulate the parent
State. The "depopulation" theory became a potent factor,
especially in England, in checking the tendency to emigration to
the colonies, and continued to be so until the evils of a surplus
population had grown into a great national question. <a href=
"#note-044" name="noteref-044" id="noteref-044">{3}</a></p>
<p>A third cause was at work throughout the same period and in
the same direction; and that was the necessity for finding some
effectual means for disposing of the convicted criminals who were
always accumulating in the small, ill-constructed, and
unwholesome gaols of former times. Transportation under such
circumstances naturally became a favourite theory of penal
discipline among reformers and philanthropists, the arguments in
its favour being mainly these:&#8212;1, It freed the country from
large numbers of the criminal classes, as well as from the
dangers attending over-crowded gaols; 2, It was calculated to
promote the prosperity of the colonies; 3, It offered a better
prospect of reformation to the convicts who were sent abroad than
could possibly be afforded them in the gaols; and 4, It served to
mitigate the severity of the old criminal laws, which prescribed
the penalty of death for many offences now punished with a few
months' imprisonment. For these reasons the system held its
ground firmly for fully three centuries.</p>
<p>Its Commencement may be dated from the fifteenth century, and
so far as England is concerned, it may be said to have terminated
in 1867. The Portuguese, who are credited with having been "the
first European nation to employ transportation and penal labour
in the colonies as a mode of punishment", <a href="#note-045"
name="noteref-045" id="noteref-045">{4}</a> made large use of
their Brazilian and other possessions for the reception of
convicts. If they were the first to introduce this system for
penal purposes, England was "the first country which
systematically used her dependencies as places for the reception
and punishment of convicts." <a href="#note-046" name=
"noteref-046" id="noteref-046">{5}</a> The transportation of
convicts from England to the North American colonies began in the
reign of James I, was largely resorted to in the time of Charles
II, and early in the eighteenth century was reduced to a regular
system. One reason why it came so largely into use was because
"it was found that the Government might save the expense of
maintaining convicts by selling them as slaves for a term of
years or for life, to a Virginia or Maryland planter. <a href=
"#note-047" name="noteref-047" id="noteref-047">{6}</a> The
Government, of course, did not sell the convicts directly, but it
empowered the shipowners who contracted for their transportation
to sell them, by giving the former a statutory right of property
in their service. <a href="#note-048" name="noteref-048" id=
"noteref-048">{7}</a> The Government transferred them to the
contractors, who in their turn transferred them to the
planters&#8212;the Government in that way relieving itself of all
cost and responsibility. But although the system of contract was
continued for some years when convicts were sent out to
Australia, they ceased to be made the subject of actual sale. A
different method of dealing with them was adopted; the Government
retained its control over them from first to last, paid for their
transportation at a fixed rate, and afterwards <a href=
"#note-049" name="noteref-049" id="noteref-049">{8}</a> permitted
their assignment to colonists on certain terms.</p>

"In 1824, by statute 5 George IV, c. 84, a new element was
introduced into the system of transportation, by giving to the
Governor of a penal colony a property in the services of a
transported offender for the period of his sentence, and
authorising him to assign over such offender to any other
person."&#8212;Mills, Colonial Constitutions, p. 346. The element
referred to was not altogether new. Governor Phillip was
instructed to obtain an assignment to himself, from the masters
of the transports in the First Fleet, of the servitude of the
convicts on board for the remainder of the terms specified in
their sentences; and he was authorised, in 1789, to assign to
each grantee of lands in the colony any number of convicts that
he might judge sufficient on certain conditions. The section
(viii) of the Act referred to by Mills is as follows:&#8212;<br>
<br></p>
<blockquote>And be it further enacted that so soon as any such
offender shall be delivered to the Governor of the colony, or
other person or persons to whom the contractor shall be so
directed to deliver him or her, the property in the service of
such offender shall be vested in the Governor of the colony for
the time being, or in such other person or persons; and it shall
be lawful for the Governor for the time being, and for such other
person or persons, whenever he or they shall think fit, to assign
any such offender to any other person for the then residue of his
or her term of transportation, and for such assignee to assign
over such offender, and so often as may be thought fit; and the
property in the service of such offender shall continue in the
Governor for the time being, or in such other person or persons
as aforesaid, or his or their assigns, during the whole remaining
term of life or years for which such offender was sentenced or
ordered to be transported.</blockquote>

<h3>1.3 TRANSPORTATION TO AMERICA.</h3>
<br>
<p>TRANSPORTATION to the American plantations is said to have
become a common sentence in the English Criminal Courts about the
time of the Restoration&#8212;1660, <a href="#note-050" name=
"noteref-050" id="noteref-050">{1}</a> Cromwell sent large
numbers of his royalist prisoners to the West Indies; <a href=
"#note-051" name="noteref-051" id="noteref-051">{2}</a> but
although many convicts of all classes were afterwards sent there,
they were few in comparison with the numbers sent to America. The
extent to which transportation to that country was carried may be
gathered from many casual references in the pages of
contemporary-writers. When, for instance, Bacon wrote in his
Essays that "it is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the
scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with
whom you plant", he was evidently pointing to Virginia. He was a
shareholder in the trading Company formed by London merchants and
others for the purpose of colonising that country, and which, in
1608&#8212;the second edition of the Essays was published in
1612&#8212;sent out an expedition of nine ships with five hundred
settlers on board. These men "were for the most part the very
scum of the earth&#8212;men sent out to the New World because
they were unfit to live in the Old." <a href="#note-052" name=
"noteref-052" id="noteref-052">{3}</a> Speaking of a later
period, the same authority says:&#8212;"Most of the colonists
were no better than criminals; indeed, the colony had got so evil
a name in England that few respectable men would go out." De Foe,
whose pictures of contemporary life are none the less reliable
because they were used for the purposes of fiction, has left some
remarkably graphic sketches of the transportation system, of the
traffic in indented servants, and of the kidnapping practices to
which it gave rise. <a href="#note-053" name="noteref-053">{4}</a> Not only were the gaols cleared from time
to time by the removal of their inmates to the ships employed in
carrying them over to the plantations, but the very streets of
London and other large cities were swept by kidnappers in search
of their prey. The method of dealing with the convicts and
indented servants, who were shipped to the plantations in the
West Indies as well as to those in America, is described by a
historian of Jamaica, whose work was written and published at a
time when information on the subject might be readily gathered
from men's mouths, instead of being laboriously compiled from
dusty records. <a href="#note-053">{4}</a> The author, seeking to justify the planters
from the charge of cruelty to their slaves so often alleged
against them, asserts that the cruelty was not practised by the
planters but by their overseers, who were sent out to the
plantations from England. The colonists were thus made to suffer
in reputation for the vicious brutality of men thrust upon them
by the English Government; and incidentally he
remarks&#8212;"America has been made the very common sewer and
dungyard to Britain." Similar language seems to have been
frequently applied to the West Indies. <a href="#note-054" name=
"noteref-054" id="noteref-054">{5}</a> Perhaps the truth could
hardly be better expressed than it is by Bancroft:&#8212;"The
history of our colonisation is the History of the crimes of
Europe."</p>
<p>Owing, however, to the absence of statistics on the subject,
there are no very accurate means in the present day of
ascertaining the extent to which transportation to America was
carried during the period of one hundred and twenty
years&#8212;say from 1650 to 1775&#8212;in which it may be said
to have flourished. According to an official estimate, <a href=
"#note-055" name="noteref-055">{6}</a> written
in 1787, the average annual number transported during the seven
years from 1769 to 1775 was about 1,100. If we take the average
number at 1,000 throughout the whole period, the result would be
a total of 120,000. That estimate is probably within the mark,
because it takes no account of the large numbers who were sent
out for political offences after the rebellions of 1685, 1715,
and 1745. Nor does it take any account of the offenders who were
allowed to transport themselves&#8212;a privilege frequently
granted in the case of men arrested on suspicion but not brought
to trial, as well as in cases of conviction. In any case,
therefore, it might be fairly assumed that while the total number
of convicts of all classes transported to America could not have
been less than 120,000, it was probably far larger. Dr. Lang
mentions, <a href="#note-055">{6}</a> in his Transportation and Colonisation,
that according to an estimate which Lord Auckland caused to be
prepared in connection with the work entitled Governor Phillip's
Voyage, the average number of convicts annually sent out to
America amounted to 2,000. His own calculation is that the number
did not exceed 500 annually, or a total of 50,000 altogether. But
this estimate appears to be as much below the mark as Lord
Auckland's seemed to him above it.</p>
<p>The reticence of American writers on this subject renders it
difficult to obtain any exact information with respect to it. A
curious instance of national sensitiveness may be seen in a
statement made by Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration
of Independence, who was Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781,
Minister at the Court of France from 1784 to 1789, and President
of the United States from 1801 to 1809. In a note written for the
information of the author of an article on the <i>Etats Unis</i>
in the <i>Encyclop&#233;die M&#233;thodique</i>, he stated that
"the malefactors sent to America were not sufficient in number to
merit enumeration, as one class out of three which peopled
America." And he added: "It was at a late period of their history
that this practice began. I have no book by me which enables me
to point out the date of its commencement. But I do not think the
whole number sent out would amount to 2,000; and being
principally men eaten up with disease, they married seldom and
propagated little. I do not suppose that themselves and their
descendants are at present 4,000, which is little more than
one-thousandth part of the whole inhabitants." <a href=
"#note-056" name="noteref-056" id="noteref-056">{7}</a></p>
<p>It is not easy to reconcile this estimate&#8212;which bears no
date, but was written about 1785&#8212;with that of the official
charged with the transportation of convicts to America, whose
letter on the subject has been already referred to. Jefferson's
calculation was not based on any statistical or official
information, and is evidently at variance with the facts as they
appear in the records.</p>
<p>Later writers of American history would appear to have adopted
the great President's views on this subject. Their pages may be
searched in vain for any account of the transportation system,
although it formed so conspicuous a chapter in the annals of
American colonisation. The convict element in the composition of
early American society has long since dropped out of sight; so
much so, indeed, that it is difficult now to find even an
allusion to it in the literature of the present century. <a href=
"#note-057" name="noteref-057" id="noteref-057">{8}</a> The
explanation is not difficult. The convicts, scattered over the
immense territory of the plantations, were so rapidly absorbed in
the general population that all traces of their identity were
soon lost in the crowd; a result largely owing to the means of
reformation afforded them by free grants of land and assistance
in the work of cultivation.</p>
<p>Transportation to New South Wales ceased in 1841, and the
total number of convicts sent out to the colony up to that date
is calculated at 83,000. <a href="#note-058" name="noteref-058"
id="noteref-058">{9}</a> Of this portion of its population it may
be said that the process of absorption which took place in the
American colonies has been witnessed here&#8212;largely
accelerated by the great gold discoveries which began ten years
after the system was discontinued. Those discoveries may be said
to have dispersed the scattered remnants of the old convict days,
as effectually, if not as rapidly, as bush fires have consumed
the decayed vegetation of a forest.</p>
<p>Transportation to Van Diemen's Land and Norfolk Island ceased
in 1853, and to Western Australia in 1867, For nearly eighty
years, in face of all the accumulated evidence against it, this
system was carried out as resolutely under one form of government
as another&#8212;with the same faith in its equity under Lord
John Russell in 1840 as under Lord Sydney over half a century
before; and but for the determined resistance of the colonies to
its continuance, it would probably have been in existence at the
present day. So little do merely moral considerations avail, when
weighed in the balance against political convenience.</p>

<h3>1.4 THE EXPEDITION TO BOTANY BAY. <small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p>THE colonies in British America continued to receive convicts
for some years after the Declaration of Independence by the
United States in 1776, followed by the Treaty of Versailles in
1783, had put an end to the system of transportation to the
States. Among the records of the Home Office are two warrants,
dated 1783 and 1784, and addressed to the superintendent of the
convicts on the river Thames, requiring him to deliver certain
convicts then on board the hulks to the contractor for their
transportation to America. <a href="#note-059" name="noteref-059"
id="noteref-059">{1}</a> These warrants are sufficient to show
that transportation to America did not, as is often supposed,
entirely cease after the War of Independence. <a href="#note-060"
name="noteref-060" id="noteref-060">{2}</a></p>
<p>When the independence of the United States was recognised by
England, by the Peace of Versailles, the Government found itself
under the necessity of finding some other outlet for the
fast-accumulating population of the gaols. The coasts of Africa
were at first thought of as the most suitable place for the
reception of convicts, and many were sent there; but the
unhealthiness of the climate proved so fatal to them that
transportation to that country was wholly abandoned in 1785.</p>
<p>The final determination of the Government was made known in a
letter from Lord Sydney to the Lords of the Treasury, dated 18th
August, 1786:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The several gaols and places for the confinement of
felons in this kingdom being in so crowded a state that the
greatest danger is to be apprehended, not only from their escape
but from infectious distempers which may hourly be expected to
break out amongst them, his Majesty, desirous of preventing by
every possible means the ill consequences which might happen from
either of these causes, has been pleased to signify to me his
royal commands that measures should immediately be pursued for
sending out of his kingdom such of the convicts as are under
sentence or order of transportation.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus, sloop, which, upon the recommendation of a
Committee of the House of Commons, had been sent to explore the
southern coast of Africa, in order to find out an eligible
situation for the reception of the said convicts, where, from
their industry, they might soon be likely to obtain means of
subsistence, having lately returned, and it appearing by the
report of her officers that the several parts of the coast which
they examined between the latitudes 15&#176; 50' south and the
latitude of 33&#176; are sandy and barren, and from other causes
unfit for a settlement of that description, his Majesty has
thought it advisable to fix upon Botany Bay, situated on the
coast of New South Wales, in the latitude of about 33&#176;
south, which, according to the accounts given by the late Captain
Cook, as well as the representations of persons <a href=
"#note-061" name="noteref-061" id="noteref-061">{3}</a> who
accompanied him during his last voyage, and who have been
consulted upon the subject, is looked upon as a place likely to
answer the above purposes.<br>
<br>
I am therefore commanded to signify to your lordships His
Majesty's pleasure that you do forthwith take such measures as
may be necessary for providing a proper number of vessels for the
conveyance of seven hundred and fifty convicts to Botany Bay,
together with such provisions, necessaries, and implements for
agriculture as may be necessary for their use after their
arrival. <a href="#note-062" name="noteref-062" id=
"noteref-062">{4}</a></blockquote>
<p>It would appear from this letter that the sole motive of the
expedition to Botany Bay was to relieve the gaols. But there is
abundant evidence to show that other and higher considerations
had been at work for some time previously; and that although the
relief of the prisons was the immediate object in view, the real
motives which led to the expedition were of a much larger and
more statesman-like character.</p>
<p>The work of colonisation had so long been associated in the
minds of colonising nations with the employment of convict labour
that, when a new colony was projected, the despatch of convicts
to its shores was usually accepted as an indispensable part of
the programme. This fact in the history of colonisation has so
far been lost sight of by many writers in the present century,
that transportation to Botany Bay has generally been treated as
the central idea of the whole movement; and its history has too
often been written as if "the new intended settlement" was from
the first intended to be nothing more than a strictly penal
one&#8212;a mere substitute for hulks and penitentiaries.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there is some colour for this view of the matter.
When the Government had determined to form a settlement on the
coast of New South Wales, they did not announce that they were
about to do so, but contented themselves with an intimation that
they proposed to transport a number of felons in order to relieve
the gaols. In the speech with which George the Third opened
Parliament on the 23rd January, 1787, the only reference to the
subject was the following:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>A plan has been formed, by my direction, for
transporting a number of convicts in order to remove the
inconvenience which arose from the crowded state of the gaols in
different parts of the kingdom; and you will, I doubt not, take
such further measures as may be necessary for this purpose.
<a href="#note-063" name="noteref-063" id=
"noteref-063">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>Nor was anything said about the matter in the debate on the
address in reply, beyond a remark from the mover to the effect
that transportation was a measure of absolute necessity, "no
penitentiary houses having been built, though an Act had passed
for their erection."</p>
<p>Judging from the extremely curt allusion to the matter in the
King's speech, it would appear that the Government did not think
it expedient to invite discussion with respect to their
colonising project. No debate seems to have taken place at any
stage of the business, even the bill "to enable his Majesty to
establish a Criminal Judicature on the eastern coast of New South
Wales and the parts adjacent" having passed without comment.
<a href="#note-064" name="noteref-064" id="noteref-064">{6}</a>
The measure seems to have been treated as if it contained nothing
beyond a provision for the disposal of felons. Possibly the
Government may have been influenced by the objections urged in
different quarters to any proposal for the establishment of a new
colony. They had to encounter objections from the East India
Company to any interference with their commercial monopoly;
objections from philosophers who considered colonies a source of
weakness to the mother country; objections from critics who
looked upon the eastern coast of New Holland as, "perhaps, the
most barren, least inhabited, and worst cultivated country in the
Southern Hemisphere"; <a href="#note-065" name="noteref-065" id=
"noteref-065">{7}</a> and objections from humanitarians who
argued that, if the Government "had chosen to embrace the single
purpose of forming a settlement at Botany Bay, they would be
justly censurable in inviting the industrious and reputable
artisan to exchange his own happy soil for the possession of
territory, however extensive, in a part of the world as yet so
little known. <a href="#note-066" name="noteref-066" id=
"noteref-066">{8}</a></p>
<p>But notwithstanding the indifference with which the proposed
expedition appears to have been received in political circles, a
glance at contemporary history is enough to show that there were
other objects in view in the minds of English statesmen besides
the relief of overcrowded gaols. In the first place, the loss of
the American colonies naturally provoked a desire to found other
colonies, which in course of time might compensate England for
them; and in the second place, there was the clear political
necessity of occupying the territory discovered by Captain Cook,
in order to prevent its occupation by the French.</p>
<p>The sequence of events during the twenty-five years which
preceded the expedition under Governor Phillip is too strikingly
suggestive to be overlooked. We have only to review the great
historical occurrences of that time in order to see the
connection between them.</p>
<p>1. The Peace of Paris in 1763 put an end to the long struggle
between France and England for the possession of Canada and
India. The French having lost both, it was inevitable that they
should seek to retrieve the disaster by fresh discoveries in
other parts of the world.</p>
<p>2. Accordingly, an expedition of discovery in the South Sea
was despatched under the command of Louis de Bougainville,
Colonel of Foot and Commodore, in 1766. He sailed round the
world&#8212;the first achievement of the kind in the history of
French navigation&#8212;and discovered various islands in the
Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>3. The English expedition under Captain Cook, "for making
discoveries in the southern hemisphere", followed in 1768, and
the publication of his voyages in 1773 directed attention to one
of the greatest fields for colonisation that had yet been made
known.</p>
<p>4. The French Government despatched another expedition in
1772, under Captain Marion Du Fresne, to make discoveries in the
Southern Ocean. He touched at Van Diemen's Land and New Zealand,
but added little or nothing to their geography.</p>
<p>5. A second expedition under Captain Cook was despatched in
1772 for the purpose of making discoveries in the unexplored part
of the southern hemisphere. New Caledonia and Norfolk Island were
discovered on this voyage.</p>
<p>6. A third expedition under the same commander was sent out to
the Pacific Ocean in 1776, to make discoveries in the northern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>7. By the Peace of Versailles in 1783, England recognised the
independence of the American colonies, which were thus finally
lost to her.</p>
<p>8. The French Government sent out a third expedition in 1785,
under the command of La P&#233;rouse, for the purpose of making
discoveries and also examining portions of New Holland and New
Zealand.</p>
<p>9. In 1786 Botany Bay was fixed upon as the site of the
intended settlement on the coast of New South Wales, and in May,
1787, the fleet sailed under the command of Governor Philip,
whose last lines from England showed how thoroughly he
appreciated the national importance of the work in which he was
engaged.</p>
<p>These events lead to the conclusion that, whether Lord Sydney
and his colleagues confined their attention to the state of the
gaols or not, there was a motive-power of a very different
character at work, irresistibly impelling them to undertake the
colonisation of New South Wales. <a href="#note-067" name=

<h3>1.5 PHILLIP'S COMMISSION. <small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IF</small> there were any serious doubt as to the real
nature of the expedition on which Phillip was despatched, it
might be settled by reference to the terms of his Commission,
illustrated as it is by the official Instructions which
accompanied it. <a href="#note-068" name="noteref-068">{1}</a> There is certainly nothing in the former
that could lead the reader to suppose that the sole object of the
expedition was the establishment of a penal settlement; nor could
a stranger to our history even gather from it that such a
settlement was contemplated. The Commission conferred much the
same powers on Phillip as those with which the Governors sent out
to the colonies and plantations in North America and the West
Indies used to be invested in days when "assemblies of
freeholders" were unknown. All these Commissions seem to have
been framed more or less on the same lines, and according to
precedents established in the early days of the colonial system;
<a href="#note-068">{1}</a>
the points of difference observable among them being attributable
to difference in the positions occupied by the various
Governors&#8212;some being appointed to Crown colonies, others to
colonies possessing legislative institutions. Phillip was sent
out as the Governor of a Crown colony, and consequently there was
practically no limitation of his powers. <a href="#note-069"
name="noteref-069" id="noteref-069">{2}</a> He was appointed
"Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over our territory
called New South Wales, extending from the northern Cape or
extremity of the coast called Cape York to the southern extremity
or South Cape, <a href="#note-070" name="noteref-070" id=
"noteref-070">{3}</a> and of all the country inland westward as
far as the 135th degree of east longtitude, including "all the
islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean; and of all towns,
garrisons, castles, forts, and all other fortifications or other
military works which may be hereafter erected upon the said
territory or any of the said islands."</p>
<p>The jurisdiction thus created was evidently designed to answer
a higher purpose than that of establishing a place for the
reception of convicts. Any of the adjacent islands ill the
Pacific Ocean&#8212;Norfolk Island or New Caledonia, for
instance&#8212;might have been sufficient for that purpose, and
might probably have been even better adapted to it than the
mainland; but the territory placed under Phillip's administration
comprised the best half of New Holland, and taking possession of
it was in fact taking possession of the whole. That the intention
of the British Government in occupying New South Wales was to
colonise it is further shown in the direction&#8212;"that you
take the oath required to be taken by Governors in the
plantations, to do their utmost that the several laws relating to
trade and the plantations be duly observed." The laws referred to
were the celebrated Trade and Navigation Laws, passed for the
purpose of keeping the colonial trade in the hands of 1787
British merchants; but unless it was intended that New South
Wales should be colonised and commercial relations established
between it and the mother country, the reference to those laws
would have been curiously out of place in Phillip's Commission.
<a href="#note-071" name="noteref-071" id=
"noteref-071">{4}</a></p>
<p>The several powers and authorities conferred upon him were
such as would be required for the establishment of a civil
government in any new settlement, of whatever elements its
population might be composed. He was empowered&#8212;(1) to keep
and use the "Great Seal of our said territory and its
dependencies"; (2) to administer oaths; (3) to appoint Justices
of the Peace, coroners, constables, and other necessary officers,
for the administration of justice; (4) to grant pardons and to
remit fines; (5) to grant custody of idiots and lunatics; (6) to
levy forces for defence; (7) to execute martial law in time of
invasion or at other lawful times; (8) to build and arm
fortifications for defence; (9) to punish mutiny in ships-of-war
according to martial law; (10) to punish offences committed on
shore by men belonging to the navy; (11) to issue public moneys
by warrant; (12) to grant lands; (13) to appoint fairs, marts,
and markets, and also ports and harbours for shipping.</p>
<p>Equally significant is the following passage in the
Instructions with reference to Norfolk Island:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Norfolk Island being represented as a spot which may
hereafter become useful, you are, as soon as circumstances will
admit of it, to send a small establishment thither to secure the
same to us, and prevent its being occupied by the subjects of any
other European Power.</blockquote>
<p>The only other Power which was at all likely to occupy Norfolk
Island was France; and the order to take possession of it as soon
as possible shows that the probability of its being occupied by
the French was distinctly present to the mind of the British
Government. The repeated injunctions conveyed to Phillip to lose
no time in sailing with his fleet and in disembarking on his
arrival, point to the same conclusion. Possibly it was
apprehended that the expedition sent out by the French Government
in 1785, under the command of La P&#233;rouse, <a href=
"#note-072" name="noteref-072" id="noteref-072">{5}</a> included
some design to occupy the great territory discovered by Captain
Cook. That such an apprehension would not have been altogether an
unreasonable one under the circumstances&#8212;although, as a
matter of fact, it would have been unfounded&#8212;is a very
natural inference from the chronic state of jealousy which then
existed between the two Powers. There is nothing, however, in the
"Private Instructions from the King to the Sieur de la
P&#233;rouse", published by the French Government with the
narrative of his voyage, that can be said to justify the
suspicion. He was directed to examine the north and west coasts
of New Holland; consequently he could not have had any design
upon the east or south coast. During his stay in Queen
Charlotte's Sound, he was to "gain intelligence whether the
English have formed, or entertain the project of forming, any
settlement on these islands (of New Zealand); and if he should
hear that they have actually formed a settlement, he will
endeavour to repair thither in order to learn its condition,
strength, and object." <a href="#note-073" name="noteref-073" id=
"noteref-073">{6}</a> From which it would appear that, although
the voyage was one of discovery, it was also designed to be the
means of acquiring information with respect to new settlements by
the English in New Zealand. It would also seem that the French
Government had entertained the project of occupying those islands
even at that time. <a href="#note-074" name="noteref-074" id=
"noteref-074">{7}</a></p>
<p>Although it is tolerably clear from La P&#233;rouse's
instructions that the French Government had no intention of
anticipating the British in their occupation of New South Wales,
a strong impression to the contrary has always prevailed in some
quarters. The idea seems to have been suggested by the track of
the French ships, as marked on the chart of their voyage from
Kamschatka to Botany Bay. But if any suspicion as to their
intentions had occurred to Governor Phillip, he would not have
omitted to mention it in his first despatch from Sydney Cove,
when referring to the French ships. It may also be assumed that
either Captain Hunter or Lieutenant King, of the Sirius, would
have made some allusion to it, when writing on the subject. But
neither they, nor Judge-Advocate Collins, nor Captain Tench, each
of whom also made specific reference to it, appear to have had
any impression of the kind. The records left by these authorities
point distinctly the other way. Captain Tench, for instance, in
the lively account he gives of the unexpected appearance of the
strangers, says:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"By this time the alarm had become general, and
everyone appeared lost in conjecture. Now they were Dutchmen sent
to dispossess us, and the moment after, store-ships from England,
with supplies for the settlement. The improbabilities which
attended both these conclusions were sunk in the agitation of the
moment. It was by Governor Phillip that this mystery was at
length unravelled, and the cause of the alarm pronounced to the
two French ships which, it was now recollected, were on a voyage
of discovery in the southern hemisphere. Thus were our doubts
cleared up and our apprehensions banished." <a href="#note-075"
name="noteref-075" id="noteref-075">{8}</a></blockquote>
<p>It seems to have been forgotten that, if the French Government
had intended at that time to take possession of any part of the
east coast of New Holland, there was nothing to prevent La
P&#233;rouse from exploring to the southward of Point Hicks, and
hoisting the French flag at any place he pleased in that
direction. The country of which Captain Cook took possession on
the 21st August, 1770, extended from latitude
38&#176;&#8212;Point Hicks&#8212;to latitude 10&#176; south; but
although the territory claimed in Phillip's Commission covered
the whole of the coast line from Cape York to the South Cape, and
all the country inland westward as far as the 135th degree of
east longtitude, it was still open to the French to claim, by
virtue of prior discovery, any part of the territory not included
in Cook's boundaries, or not Actually occupied by the English.
Had the exploration of the southern coast, made by Baudin in
1801-2, not been anticipated by Flinders, it is difficult to see
how the right of the French to occupy the territory they claimed
could have been denied; still more so had La P&#233;rouse thought
proper to explore to the southward of <i>Pointe de Hick</i>,
instead of passing his time idly in Botany Bay. In that case the
territory now included in the boundaries of Victoria and South
Australia might have been added to the French dominions. The
reason why he did not do so may, perhaps, be found in the
statement made by Collins when referring to his departure.
<a href="#note-076" name="noteref-076" id="noteref-076">{9}</a>
He felt so little interest in the country that he did not think
it worth his while to examine it. French opinion on that subject,
however, was considerably changed in 1800, when Consul Bonaparte
despatched the expedition under Baudin for the purpose of making
discoveries&#8212;apparently with a view to the annexation of all
the unoccupied territory that could be found. The <i>Terre
Napol&#233;on</i>, which figures so prettily on the map published
with P&#233;ron's <i>Voyage</i>, is a significant illustration of
the great Emperor's ambition.</p>

Edwards, History of the West Indies, vol. ii, page
395:&#8212;"Mr. Stokes, the late Chief Justice of Georgia,
relates that a Governor of a province in North America (at that
time a British colony) ordered the Provost-Marshal to hang up a
convict some days before the time appointed by his sentence and a
rule of Court for his execution. 'He meant well', says Stokes,
'but being a military man, conceived that as he had power to
reprieve after sentence, he had power to execute also when he
pleased, and the criminal was actually hanged as the Governor
ordered, nor could his Excellency be persuaded that, by this very
act, he was himself committing felony.' And of another military
Governor, it is said that he 'took it into his head to suspend a
gentleman from his seat in the Council, for no other reason than
marrying his daughter without his consent.'"</p>

Tasman calls South Cape, bore north four leagues off

The extent of the restrictions placed upon the colonies at that
time with respect to their commercial relations with other
countries may be understood from the following passage in the
preface to the History of New Holland, 1787, page
viii:&#8212;"Botany Bay and the rest of New South Wales may be
rendered, in the hands of this nation, a more important
instrument for the improvement of her commerce; a passive
instrument, it is true; for notwithstanding the extent of its
coast, that country, supposing it already colonised, can never,
while the charter of the East India Company exists, possess a
commerce of its own. It might, perhaps, appear impossible to
prevent the inhabitants of a whole colony, especially if
increased to any magnitude, from becoming merchants on their own
account; but besides the restriction which it is in the power of
the mother country to impose, a single Act of the Legislature,
rendering any person possessed of property in Great Britain or
Ireland disqualified to become possessors of fixed property in
New South Wales would, it is imagined, go a great way to effect
such a prevention. Thus the traffick, in particular, of the
English East India Company, would be as inaccessible to the
colonists of New South Wales, though settled on the borders of
the East, as to the inhabitants of the island of St. Helena."</p>

The name is sometimes spelt Peyrouse, as, for instance, in
Phillip's Voyage, where it is stated that the latter "is the
right form of that officer's name"; p. 68 n. But as it is spelt
P&#233;rouse in the authorised French edition of his voyage,
published in 1799, and also on the medal struck on the occasion
of the expedition, there can be little doubt that Peyrouse was
not then considered the right form of the name in France;

The apprehension of French settlement on the coast of New South
Wales continued to agitate the British mind for many years after
Phillip left the colony. During Governor King's administration,
1800-1806, the excitement caused by this apprehension reached its
climax when the ships sent out by Napoleon in 1800 were known to
be cruising in these seas. To appreciate the reasons for the
excitement, the reader has only to compare P&#233;ron's <i>Voyage
de D&#233;couvertes aux Terres Australes</i>, published by the
French Government in 1807, with the Voyage to Terra Australis,
written by Flinders and published in 1814.</p>

Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay, p. 50.&#8212;The
latest reference to French designs appeared in an article
published in the London <i>Globe</i> newspaper on the 26th
January, 1858, on the occasion of the New South Wales Centenary,
in which the writer said:&#8212;"It is not generally realised
that a matter of no more than three days prevented New South
Wales from becoming French instead of British territory, and very
possibly from remaining so to this hour&#8212;to the exceeding
simplification of the question of recidivists and Noum&#233;an
<i>&#233;vad&#233;s</i>. It was a race to Botany Bay between
Captain Phillip, riding for England, and de La P&#233;rouse,
riding for France; and Captain Phillip's fleet beat the Boussole
and the Astrolabe by just three days. De la P&#233;rouse arrived
to find the first English Governor in possession; submitted to
the inevitable with national courtesy; and sailed off&#8212;to be
lost on a coral reef, and to have his fate wrapped in mystery for
forty years. The birth of New South Wales, as a colony, took
place therefore under more than ordinary romantic circumstances
... The whole past history of Australasia, in the largest sense,
has hung upon that accident."</p>

<h3>1.6 PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXPEDITION.
<small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> instructions sent from Whitehall to the
Treasury and the Admiralty by Lord Sydney for the equipment of
the ships required on the expedition appear to indicate all the
deliberation which might be expected on such an occasion. As it
turned out, however, there was but too much reason for the
complaints made on the subject by Governor Phillip. There was
evidence of so much neglect and inattention to the most essential
matters that, judging from his repeated remonstrances, it would
appear as if the necessary preparations had been left to take
care of themselves. For the negligence displayed in almost every
instance, the contractors and subordinate officials charged with
the management of details were no doubt mainly responsible: but
seeing that the expedition was formed for the avowed purpose of
founding a colony as well as transporting convicts, it is
singular that so little precaution should have been taken to
ensure its success. That it did meet with success must be largely
attributed to the prudence, sagacity, and foresight displayed by
Phillip, from the time he assumed command of it to the day when
he left the colony.</p>
<p>Some idea of the difficulties he had to contend with from the
first, and which might have been avoided by proper attention to
the actual requirements of the expedition, may be gathered from
the following facts:&#8212;</p>
<p>1. The convicts put on board the transports, numbering seven
hundred and fifty-six in all, of whom five hundred and sixty-four
were men and one hundred and ninety-two were women, were not by
any means adapted to the work of colonising. Instead of being
selected for their probable usefulness on landing in a new
country, as labourers and skilled workmen, they were mostly unfit
for any useful employment. Fifty-two of them were incapacitated
for work of any kind by old age and incurable complaints, and
consequently had to be kept on the sick list after their arrival,
at a time when the infant colony was threatened with
starvation.</p>
<p>2. The convicts were put on board without sufficient clothing
supplies of clothing, a neglect especially felt in the case of
the women; and the hardship was aggravated by the want of such
simple necessaries as needles and thread, so that when their
clothes fell to pieces they could not be repaired.</p>
<p>3. The supply of anti-scorbutics on board the fleet was very
insufficient. The outbreak of scurvy at sea was prevented by the
supplies of fresh provisions obtained at Teneriffe, Rio, and the
Cape; but when it broke out after the arrival at Port Jackson,
the medical staff found themselves without the necessary means of
treatment for the sick.</p>
<p>4. Although Governor Phillip was instructed to "proceed to the
cultivation of the land" immediately after his arrival, under the
idea that the convicts would be able to provide the means of
subsistence, and for that purpose supplies of seed, grain, and
farming implements had been put on board the ships, no men were
sent out who had any knowledge of farming or of the management of
stock.</p>
<p>5. The number of carpenters among the convicts was so
small&#8212;there were only twelve, and several of them were sick
on their arrival&#8212;that ships' carpenters had to be hired
from the fleet. A similar difficulty presented itself in the case
of other mechanics required in the construction of houses and
public buildings. <a href="#note-077" name="noteref-077" id=
"noteref-077">{1}</a></p>
<p>6. There were no men on board the fleet who had any knowledge
of useful sciences, such as botany, geology, mineralogy, and
natural history; and consequently there was no means of
ascertaining the various resources of the country, and applying
the knowledge to the wants of the settlement.</p>
<p>7. Nor were there any persons skilled in technical arts, such
as flax-dressing, although the Governor was instructed to
cultivate flax as a means of acquiring clothing for the convicts,
as well as for maritime purposes.</p>
<p>8. No persons were sent out in charge of the convicts in the
capacity of overseers or superintendents; and as the Governor was
consequently under the necessity of selecting such officers from
among the convicts, the difficulty of maintaining order among
them was much greater than it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p>9. No instructions were conveyed to the officers of the
marines for the purpose of ensuring their obedience to the
Governor's orders; the consequence being that they were no sooner
encamped than they refused to obey any orders outside their
ordinary duty, insisting that they would not interfere with the
convicts under any circumstances, except as a garrison force.</p>
<p>10. The Judge-Advocate appointed to preside over the Courts of
civil and criminal jurisdiction was a captain of marines, without
any legal training or experience; and although those Courts were
instructed to administer justice "according to the laws of
England", the presiding judge had no qualifications of the kind
required for a purely judicial position. The Governor was thus
left without any legal advice on which he could rely, and law was
administered on strictly military principles.</p>
<p>These were some of the difficulties which Phillip had to
encounter day by day, and which were, no doubt, doubly trying to
him from the fact that they might have been so easily avoided by
proper attention in the first instance. But serious as they were,
they were greatly aggravated by the subsequent despatch of
convict ships, one after another, at a time when the settlement
was suffering from want of the actual necessaries of life; ships,
too, sent out with so little regard for human life that
pestilential fevers broke out among their wretched passengers,
carrying off large numbers of them at sea, and leaving the rest
in so disabled a state that on their arrival they had to be kept
in hospital among a starving population.</p>
<p>From the time of his appointment to that of his departure on
the 13th May, 1787, Phillip&#8212;judging from his
correspondence&#8212;appears to have been energetically employed
in supervising the arrangements made for the expedition,
inquiring into various details connected with it, and otherwise
preparing for his new sphere of action. How minutely he examined
every point that presented itself to his mind at this time may be
seen from a "memo." preserved in the Record Office, bearing no
date, but evidently written soon after he had received his
appointment. It contains a striking passage, in which, as on
other occasions, he expressed his opinion of the great future
which lay before the colony:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>By arriving at the settlement two or three months
before the transports, many and very great advantages would be
gained. Huts would be ready to receive the convicts who are sick,
and they would find vegetables, of which it may naturally be
supposed they will stand in great need, as the scurvy must make a
great ravage amongst people naturally indolent and not
cleanly.<br>
<br>
Huts would be ready for the women; the stores would be properly
lodged and defended from the convicts, in such manner as to
prevent their making any attempt on them. The cattle and stock
would be likewise properly secured, and the ground marked out for
the convicts; for lists of those intended to be sent being given
to the commanding officers, mentioning their age, crimes, trades,
and character, they might be so divided as to render few changes
necessary, and the provisions would be ready for issuing without
any waste. But if convicts, provisions, &amp;c., most be landed a
few days after the ships' arrival, and consequently nearly at the
same time, great inconvenience will arise, and to keep the
convicts more than a few days on board, after they get into a
port, considering the length of time which they must inevitably
be confined, may be attended with consequences easier to conceive
than to point out in a letter. Add to this, fevers of a malignant
kind may make it necessary to have a second hospital.<br>
<br>
A ship's company is landed, huts raised, and the sick provided
for in a couple of days; but here the greater number are
convicts, in whom no confidence can be placed, and against whom
both person and provisions are to be guarded. Everything
necessary for the settlement would be received at the Cape on
board by the commanding officer, and nothing left for the
transports but a certain proportion of live stock.<br>
<br>
The confining the convicts on board the ships requires some
consideration. Sickness must be the consequence in so long a
voyage (six months may be allowed for the voyage&#8212;that is,
from the time of leaving England to the arrival in Botany Bay),
and disagreeable consequences may be feared if they have the
liberty of the deck. The sooner the crimes and behaviour of these
people are known the better, as they may be divided, and the
greatest villains particularly guarded against in one
transport.<br>
<br>
The women in general, I should suppose, possess neither virtue
nor honesty. But there may be some for theft who still retain
some degree of virtue, and these should be permitted to keep
together, and strict orders to the master of the transport be
given that they are not abused and insulted by the ship's
company&#8212; which is said to have been the case too often when
they were sent to America.<br>
<br>
At the ports we put into for water, &amp;c., there may be some
sick that may have fever of such a nature that it may be
necessary for the safety of the rest to remove them out of the
ship. In such a case, how am I to act?<br>
<br>
The greatest care will be necessary to prevent any of the
convicts from being sent that have any venereal complaints.
During the passage, when light airs or calms permit it, I shall
visit the transports to see that they are kept clean, and receive
the allowance ordered by Government; and at these times shall
endeavour to make them sensible of their situation, and that
their happiness and misery is in their own hands; that those who
behave well will be rewarded by being allowed to work
occasionally on the small lots of land set apart for them, and
which they will be put in possession of at the expiration of the
time for which they are transported.<br>
<br>
On landing in Botany Bay, it will be necessary to throw up a
slight work as a defence against the natives&#8212;who, though
only seen in small numbers by Captain Cook, may be very numerous
on other parts of the coast&#8212;and against the convicts; for
this, my own little knowledge as a field engineer will be
sufficient, and will be the work of a few days only; but some
small cannon for a redoubt win be necessary. Within the lines the
stores and provisions will be secured, and I should hope that the
situation I should be able to take may admit of having the small
rivers between the garrison and the convicts so situated that I
may be able to prevent their having any intercourse with the
natives.<br>
<br>
I shall think it a great point gained if I can proceed in this
business without having any dispute with the natives, a few of
which I shall endeavour to persuade to settle near us, and who I
mean to furnish with everything that can tend to civilise them,
and to give them a high opinion of their new guests; for which
purpose it will be necessary to prevent the transports' crews
from having any intercourse with the natives, if possible. The
convicts must have none, for if they have, the arms of the
natives will be very formidable in their hands, the women abused,
and the natives disgusted.<br>
<br>
The keeping of the women apart merits great consideration, and I
don't know but it may be best if the most abandoned are permitted
to receive the visits of the convicts in the limits allotted them
at certain hours, and under certain restrictions. Something of
this kind was the case on Mill Bank formerly. The rest of the
women I should keep apart, and by permitting the men to be in
their company when not at work they will, I should suppose,
marry, in which case they should be encouraged, if they are
industrious, by being allowed to work one day in the week more
than the unmarried on their own lots of ground.<br>
<br>
The natives may, it is probable, permit their women to marry and
live with the men after a certain time, in which case I should
think it necessary to punish with severity the man who used the
woman ill; and I know of no punishment likely to answer the
purpose of deterring others so well as exiling them to a distant
spot, or to an island, where they would be obliged to work hard
to gain their daily subsistence, and for which they would have
the necessary tools; but no two to be together, if it could be
avoided.<br>
<br>
Rewarding and punishing the convicts must be left to the
Governor; he will likely be answerable for his conduct, and
death, I should think, will never be necessary. In fact, I doubt
if the fear of death ever prevented a man of no principle from
committing a bad action. There are two crimes that would merit
death&#8212;murder and sodomy; for either of these crimes I
should wish to confine the criminal till an opportunity offered
of delivering him as a prisoner to the natives of New Zealand,
and let them eat him. The dread of this will operate much
stronger than the fear of death.<br>
<br>
As the getting a large quantity of stock together will be my
first great object, till that is obtained the garrison should, as
in Gibraltar, not be allowed to kill any animal without first
reporting his stock and receiving permission. This order would
only be necessary for a certain time, and I mention it here only
to show the necessity of a military government; and as I mean in
every matter of this kind to set the example, I think that I can
say this will never occasion any uneasiness. But, if it should,
it will be absolutely necessary, otherwise we shall not do in ten
years what I hope to do in four.<br>
<br>
Women may be brought from the Friendly and other islands, a
proper place prepared to receive them, and where they will be
supported for a time, and lots of land assigned to such as marry
with the soldiers of the garrison.<br>
<br>
As I would not wish convicts to lay the foundations of an Empire,
I think they should ever remain separated from the garrison and
other settlers that may come from Europe, and not be allowed to
mix with them, even after the seven or fourteen years for which
they are transported may be expired.<br>
<br>
The laws of this country will, of course, be introduced in New
South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place
from the moment his Majesty's forces take possession of the
country&#8212;that there can be no slavery in a free land, and
consequently no slaves.<br>
<br>
The cloathing for the convicts will last for a certain time,
after which, what means should I have of furnishing them with
materials for their making their own cloathes?<br>
<br>
It will be necessary to know how far I may permit the seamen and
marines of the garrison to cultivate spots of land when the duty
of the day is over; and how far I can give them hopes that the
grounds they cultivate will be secured to them hereafter;
likewise, how far I may permit any of the garrison to remain,
when they are ordered home in consequence of relief.<br>
<br>
By what I am informed, hatchets and beads are the articles for
barter, with a few small grindstones for the Chiefs; and as when
they use a light they hold it in their hands, small tin lamps on
a very simple construction must be very acceptable.<br>
<br>
Ships may arrive at Botany Bay in future. On account of the
convicts, the orders of the port for no boats landing but in
particular places, coming on shore and returning to the ships at
stated hours, must be strictly enforced.<br>
<br>
The saddles I mentioned will be absolutely necessary for two or
three horsemen, who will examine the country to a certain
distance, when it might be dangerous to attempt it with half the
garrison; for I am not of the general opinion that there are very
few inhabitants in this country, at least so few as have been
represented; but this article I take upon myself, as likewise the
knives, &amp;c., that I mentioned.<br>
<br>
Such fruit trees and cuttings that will bear removing should be
added to the seeds carried from England, as likewise roots that
will bear keeping that length of time out of the ground.<br>
<br>
Two or three of the horses in question will be highly necessary,
and there is no time to lose in giving the order, if
intended.<br>
<br>
A certain quantity of the articles of husbandry, stores, corn,
seeds, and of the articles for traffick, should be put on board
the Berwick, <a href="#note-078" name="noteref-078" id=
"noteref-078">{2}</a> that in case of an accident we may not be
in immediate want of those things, and the same on board the
store-ship in which the Lieutenant-Governor goes.</blockquote>
<p>In addition to this memo., Phillip addressed several letters
to the Home Department in reference to various matters of detail
requiring attention. On the 4th January, 1787, he addressed
Nepean as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As it has been found necessary to add additional
security to the hatchways, and to alter the handcuffs on board
the Alexander, the same will be necessary to be done on board the
different ships as they arrive at Portsmouth; consequently orders
should be sent down to that port to inform your office, or the
Navy Board, when such alterations are made, otherwise the
convicts may be sent from town before the ships are ready to
receive them.<br>
<br>
I likewise beg leave to observe that the number of scythes (only
six), of razors (only five dozen), and the quantity of buck and
small shot (only two hundred lb.), now ordered, is very
insufficient; and that twenty scythes, twelve dozen of razors (at
12s. a dozen), and five of small shot, chiefly buck, in addition
to the above, is very necessary.<br>
<br>
I have likewise to request that you will please to inform me in
what manner those people are to be paid who superintend the
convicts in their various occupations, for some people there mast
be named for that purpose, and no one will undertake this
business without some reward, though it may be very small, being
held out to them; as likewise those who must be employed in
issuing the daily provisions. These people cannot well be taken
from the garrison; I think they may from the ship.<br>
<br>
The knowing what provisions, &amp;c., are on board the different
ships is very necessary, as I find there are some things put on
board the transports by the agent that cannot possibly remain
there. I therefore beg that I may have the account as soon as it
can possibly be given.<br>
<br>
Several of the staff have requested that I would once more apply
to you for a twelvemonths' advance, as they find themselves much
distressed in fitting for the voyage, and the uncertainty of
which makes their agents unwilling to advance the sum they find
absolutely necessary to fit out&#8212;and they feel it the more
as the officers of marines have now received a year's advance;
indeed I doubt if one or two of the assistant surgeons will be
able to leave town without the advance.</blockquote>
<p>Another letter to Nepean followed on the 11th of the same
month:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>By letters from Lieutenant Shortland and the
surgeon's assistant on board the Alexander, I find that one
hundred and eighty-four men are put on board that ship, and
fifty-six women on board the Lady Penrhyn; that there are amongst
the men several unable to help themselves, and that no kind of
surgeon's instruments have been put on board that ship or any of
the transports. You will, sir, permit me to observe that it will
be very difficult to prevent the most fatal sickness amongst men
so closely confined; that on board that ship which is to receive
two hundred and ten convicts there is not a space left for them
to move in sufficiently large for forty men to be in motion at
the same time&#8212;nor is it safe to permit any number of men to
be on deck while the ship remains so near the land.<br>
<br>
On this consideration, I hope that you will order the Alexander
and Lady Penrhyn to join his Majesty's ship Sirius immediately,
and proceed to Spithead, where more liberty may be allowed the
convicts than can be done with safety in the river; and those
that are waiting to compleat the number to be sent out in those
ships may be sent round to Portsmouth with the other convicts,
for the most fatal consequences may be expected if the full
number is kept on board any length of time before we sail.<br>
<br>
You will, I presume, see the necessity of ordering some surgeon's
instruments to be sent on board the ships that carry the
convicts; and I hope that no more will be embarked till the ships
are ready to sail, and which they cannot be for a week after they
get to Spithead.</blockquote>
<p>On the 28th February he wrote to Sydney on similar topics. The
particular matters he referred to may seem very small at this
distance of time; but in his eyes they were evidently essential
to the health of his people:</p>
<blockquote>Having received the enclosed reports respecting the
marines and convicts now embarked on board the Alexander and Lady
Penrhyn, transports, I beg to submit it to your lordship whether
it may not be advisable to make some alteration in the
provisions, by allowing the marines a proportion of floor, in
lieu of a certain proportion of salt meat, and some addition to
the provisions served to the convicts. At present a convict has
only, for forty-two days, 16 lb. of bread, as will appear to your
lordship by the enclosed list.<br>
<br>
And I likewise beg leave to solicit your lordship that orders may
be given for the supplying both marines and convicts with fresh
meat and vegetables while they remain at Spithead, and that a
small quantity of wine may be allowed for the sick.<br>
<br>
P.S.&#8212;I likewise beg leave to represent to your lordship
that the contractors having a power of substituting &#189; lb. of
rice in lieu of 1 lb. of flour will be very severely felt by the
convicts.</blockquote>
<p>The specific powers with which he thought it advisable that he
should be invested, in order to provide against any emergencies
that might arise, formed the subject of a letter to the Under
Secretary, dated March 1st. He begins by pointing out that, as he
is placed under the control of the Home Office in all matters, it
is necessary that his instructions should be as precise as
possible.</p>
<blockquote>From the letter I have received from the Admiralty,
and of which I enclose a copy, you will see that respecting my
11th, 12th, and 13th queries, the Board declines giving any
answer. As I am to be entirely under the direction of the
Secretary of State immediately after I arrive on the coast of New
South Wales, for what regards the Naval Department as well as
respecting the settlement, I must request your particular
attention to the following circumstances in drawing up my
instructions:&#8212;<br>
<br>
That I am directed to order wine to be purchased on the passage,
at Teneriffe, or where it can be procured; for circumstances may
prevent my taking on board the quantity intended at Teneriffe, or
perhaps any part of it, and it may be got at the Cape or
elsewhere.<br>
<br>
That I may employ one of the transports as a hospital ship, if I
find it necessary on the passage.<br>
<br>
That I order the marines and convicts to be supplied with fresh
meat and vegetables at such places as I may stop at on the
passage, and to order the Commissary to draw bills on the
Treasury for such supplies.<br>
<br>
That I have the power of exchanging any part of the garrison with
the marines embarked on board the ships, or of incorporating the
marines now belonging to the ships with those of the garrison, if
the service requires it.<br>
<br>
That I am directed to appoint officers to fill such stations as
may become vacant by death or otherwise.<br>
<br>
That I am directed to discharge from the ships such officers and
men as may not be necessary for the navigating of the ships, and
which may be necessary in the garrison, such people being
desirous of remaining in the settlement.<br>
<br>
That I make the settlement in such port as I may find the most
convenient and best to answer the intentions of Government.<br>
<br>
That I send one of the ships to Charlotte Sound, in the Islands
of New Zealand, for the flax-plant, and to the Friendly Islands
for the bread-fruit; and as women will be there procured, that I
put an officer on board such transport.<br>
<br>
That the terms by which lands are to be granted are pointed out
by the article which gives me the power of granting lands.<br>
<br>
That I have a power of exiling to New Zealand or the neighbouring
islands any convicts that may be condemned to death.<br>
<br>
That I have the power of emancipation.<br>
<br>
The power of suspending and sending home such officer who, from
his situation, cannot be tried by a court-martial.<br>
<br>
That in case of sending home the Sirius, I have orders from the
Secretary of State to take the command of such ships or vessels
as remain on the coast, by hoisting a distinguishing pendant on
board such ship or tender, as I may judge necessary (such pendant
not to give me any claim to the pay of a commanding officer), in
order to retain the command by sea, to be more at liberty to
visit the coast, and to retain the command of the ships or
vessels that remain.<br>
<br>
That I have a power to change the species of provisions served to
the marines and convicts; for if salt meat is issued, without any
proportion of flour&#8212;as has been hitherto done by the
contractor to the marines embarked on board the
Alexander&#8212;the scurvy must prove fatal to the greatest part.
Of the marines already embarked two months, one in six are sent
to the hospital since that ship's arrival at
Spithead.</blockquote>
<p>And, on a later occasion, he wrote another series of memoranda
on similar points:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It must be left to me to fix at Botany Bay, if I find
it a proper place; if not, to go to a port a few leagues to the
northward, where there appears to be a good harbour and several
islands. As the natives are very expert in setting fire to the
grass, the having an island to secure our stock would be a great
advantage, and there is none in or off Botany Bay. <a href=
"#note-079" name="noteref-079" id="noteref-079">{3}</a><br>
<br>
It certainly will not be advisable to send out any more convicts
till my situation is known; and the strength of the garrison must
always be in proportion to the number of convicts, till the
garrison is of a certain force.<br>
<br>
Any man who takes the life of a native will be put on his trial
the same as if he had killed one of the garrison. This appears to
me not only just, but good policy.<br>
<br>
These women from the islands cannot be sent for till provision is
made to receive them, and they will certainly be free to choose
husbands, or to live in private within certain bounds. Any
insults offered to them will be punished with severity, and this
their situation will require.<br>
<br>
A power to exile to New Zealand any convict that may be condemned
under certain circumstances appears to me very necessary, and may
be attended with good consequences.<br>
<br>
Instructions how to proceed in case of being opposed by any
European ships when I arrive on the coast.<br>
<br>
How and when are the contingent expenses to be drawn for, and on
whom?<br>
<br>
Mr. Rose informed me that I was to receive as Governor,
&#163;<u>        </u><br>
<br>
Allowed for a secretary, &#163;<u>        </u><br>
<br>
Allowed for paper, &#163;<u>        </u><br>
<br>
What is the authority which fixes these
appointments?</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen from his last queries that up to this time
Phillip had, apparently, been more mindful of the public interest
than of his own. He did not even know what salary and allowances
it was proposed to attach to his appointment. As to that matter,
he was informed in a letter from Whitehall, dated 20th April,
that&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It will be proposed to Parliament in a few days to
fix your salary as Governor at &#163;1,000 per annum nett, which,
with the pay of the Sirius, is judged to be a proper allowance
for the support of the stations you are appointed to fill. You
will also be allowed a contingent charge of 5s. per diem for the
pay of a secretary, and &#163;20 per annum for
stationery.</blockquote>
<p>On another delicate matter, he was roughly told
that&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>With regard to the compensation you solicit by way of
table money, I am to inform you that no allowance whatever of
that sort can be granted to you.</blockquote>
<p>In answer to his memo. with respect to the site of the
intended settlement, he received very pointed
instructions:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>There can be no objection to your establishing any
part of the territory or islands upon the coast of New South
Wales, in the neighbourhood of Botany Bay, which you may consider
as more advantageously situated for the principal settlement; but
at the same time you must understand that you are not allowed to
delay the disembarkation of the establishment upon your arrival
on the coast, upon the pretence of searching after a more
eligible place than Botany Bay.</blockquote>
<p>In another letter to Sydney, written on the 12th March,
Phillip&#8212;evidently feeling the weight of responsibility that
lay on his shoulders, and anxious to avoid the false position in
which he might ultimately find himself placed through the
negligence of others&#8212;sought to impress on his lordship the
necessity for immediate action in order to avert disaster. From
the manner in which the marines and convicts were crowded
together on board the ships, coupled with the unsatisfactory
arrangements for victualling them, he thought it "more than
probable" that half the men might be lost on the voyage. But for
his persistent representations on these matters, it is not at all
unlikely that the First Fleet&#8212;instead of arriving, as it
did, with healthy crews and passengers&#8212;would have
experienced much the same fate as that which befell the
second:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As the Navy Board have informed me that no alteration
can be made respecting the victualling of the marines during the
passage, it is to prevent my character as an officer from being
called in question, should the consequence I fear be realised,
that I once more trouble your lordship on this subject.<br>
<br>
The contracts for the garrison and convicts were made before I
ever saw the Navy Board on this business, and though I never have
had it in my power officially to interfere, in any respect, yet I
have repeatedly pointed out the consequences that must be
expected from the men being crowded on board such small ships,
and from victualling the marines according to the contract, which
allows no flour, as is customary in the Navy. This must be fatal
to many, and the more so as no anti-scorbutics are allowed on
board the transports for either marine or convict; in fact, my
lord, the garrison and convicts are sent to the extremity of the
globe as they would be sent to America, a six weeks' passage.<br>
<br>
I see the critical situation I may be in after losing part of the
garrison, that is at present very weak, when the service for
which it is intended is considered; but I am prepared to meet
difficulties, and I have only one fear. I fear, my lord, that it
may be said hereafter the officer who took charge of the
expedition should have known that it was more than probable he
lost half the garrison and convicts, crowded and victualled in
such a manner for so long a voyage. And the public, believing it
rested with me, may impute to my ignorance or inattention what I
have never been consulted in, and which never coincided with my
ideas, to avoid which is the purport of this letter; and I
flatter myself your lordship will hereafter point out the
situation in which I have stood through the whole of this
business, should it ever be necessary.</blockquote>
<p>Knowing that it was his "duty to repeat complaints that may be
redressed", Phillip sent a still more emphatic representation of
the state of affairs to the Under Secretary, under date March
18th:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>A letter which I have received from the surgeon
states the situation of the convicts to be such that I am under
the necessity of requesting you to lay their case before Lord
Sydney, that directions may be given to the Commissioners of the
Navy for the ordering lighters from Portsmouth Yard to the
Alexander to receive the convicts while the ship is cleaned and
smoked; and though I have so often solicited that essence of malt
or some anti-scorbutic may be allowed, I cannot help once more
repeating the necessity of it. And, putting the convicts out of
the question, which humanity forbids, the sending of the marines
that are on board the transports such a voyage as they are going
in a worse state than ever troops were sent out of the kingdom,
even to the nearest garrison&#8212;for, taking off the tonnage
for the provisions and stores, they have not one ton and a half a
man&#8212;cannot, I am certain, be the intention of his Majesty's
Ministers; yet it is absolutely the case, and I have repeatedly
stated this fact. Fresh meat for all the convicts, I was
informed, had been ordered in consequence of the representation I
made as soon as the ships got round to Portsmouth; but the sick
only have fresh meat. Wine, at the discretion of the surgeon, is
very necessary for the sick, as the convicts are not allowed
anything more than water.<br>
<br>
The necessity of making one of the transports an hospital ship is
obvious, and, I think, cannot be deferred. The Friendship, as
having the smallest number of convicts on board, I propose for
that purpose.<br>
<br>
The giving cloathes to those convicts who have been embarked at
Plymouth is so very necessary that I have ordered it to be done,
and presume the Navy Board will replace the cloathing; but as
there are more convicts to be sent on board the different ships,
unless orders are being given for their being washed and cloathed
on their leaving the prison, or the hulks, all that we may do
will be to no purpose.<br>
<br>
These complaints, my dear sir, do not come unexpected, nor were
they unavoidable. I foresaw them from the beginning, and
repeatedly pointed them out when they might have been so easily
prevented at a very small expense, and with little trouble to
those who have had the conducting of this business. At present
the evils complained of may be redressed, and the intentions of
Government by this expedition answered. But if now neglected it
may be too late hereafter, and we may expect to see the seamen
belonging to the transports run from the ships to avoid a jail
distemper, and may be refused entrance into a foreign port.<br>
<br>
The situation in which the magistrates sent the women on board
the Lady Penrhyn stamps them with infamy; though almost naked and
so very filthy that nothing but cloathing them could have
prevented them from perishing, and which could not be done in
time to prevent a fever, which is still on board that ship, and
where there are many with venereal complaints that must spread in
spite of every precaution I may take hereafter, and will be fatal
to thousands.<br>
<br>
There is a necessity for doing something for the young man who is
on board the ship as surgeon, or I fear that we shall lose him,
and the a hundred women will be left without any assistance,
several of them with child. Let me repeat my desire that orders
immediately may be given to increase the convict allowance of
bread&#8212;16 lb. of bread for forty-two days is very little; to
supply all the convicts with fresh meat while they remain at
Portsmouth, the sick with some small quantity of wine; lighters
to be ordered to attend the Alexander while that ship is smoaked,
&amp;c.; to wash and cloathe the convicts that are still to be
sent down before they are put on board the transports; and to
have one of the transport's ordered to serve as a hospital
ship.<br>
<br>
This is a long letter, but it is my duty to repeat complaints
that may be redressed, and which I am certain you desire equally
with myself.</blockquote>
<p>Other little matters that had occurred to him subsequently
were touched upon in a further letter to Nepean, dated April
11th. The request for "sour krout and portable soup <a href=
"#note-080" name="noteref-080" id="noteref-080">{4}</a> for the
convicts that may be sick" shows his extreme desire to secure
their health on the passage:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>When you find a quarter of an hour, be so good as to
give me a line to the Navy Board, sufficiently explicit to
prevent any further delays, with respect to the ordinary caps for
the convicts, one Porter and hogshead of porter in bottles as a
present to the commanding officer in the island from which we are
to procure stock, and ducats to the value of &#163;30 for the
same purpose. The beer may be bought at Portsmouth, and I will
find room for it on board the Sirius.<br>
<br>
A line likewise is necessary to the Admiralty, that I may have an
order to receive on board the Sirius the Commissary and the
servant to the Judge-Advocate; likewise for victualling the forty
marines' wives, and to desire that sour krout and portable soup
may be ordered for the convicts that may be sick. There is some
krout in store at the victualling office.<br>
<br>
P.S.&#8212;By some mistake one hundred and nine women and
children are put on board the Lady Penrhyn, though that ship was
only intended to carry one hundred and two and with propriety
should not have more than two-thirds of that number.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip was thus under the necessity of imploring the
Government from day to day to supply the actual necessaries which
experience had shown to be indispensable for the preservation of
health on long voyages. The indifference shown by his Majesty's
Ministers evidently tried his temper, and he had at last become
very uneasy, if not alarmed, at the prospect before him. Not only
were the marines as well as the convicts likely to suffer from
the want of ordinary supplies, but the women had been put on
board in such a state&#8212;"almost naked and so very
filthy"&#8212;that sickness and disease were tolerably certain to
break out among them. The state of things on board his ships may
be judged by comparing his accounts of it with Captain Cook's
description of the equipment of the Resolution and Adventure in
1772. No expense was spared on that occasion. The ships</p>
<blockquote>were fitted in the most complete manner, and supplied
with every extra article that was suggested to be necessary. Lord
Sandwich <a href="#note-081" name="noteref-081" id=
"noteref-081">{5}</a> paid an extraordinary attention to this
equipment, by visiting the ships from time to time, to satisfy
himself that the whole was completed to his wish, and to the
satisfaction of those who were to embark in them. Nor were the
Navy and Victualling Boards wanting in providing them with the
very best of stores and provisions, and whatever else was
necessary for so long a voyage. We were supplied with wheat in
lieu of so much oatmeal, and sugar in lieu of so much oil; we
had, besides, many extra articles, such as malt, sour krout,
salted cabbage, portable broth, saloup, mustard, marmalade of
carrots, and inspissated juice of wort and beer. <a href=
"#note-082" name="noteref-082" id=
"noteref-082">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p>Neither Lord Sydney nor Lord Howe thought it necessary to
visit Phillip's ships in order to satisfy himself as to their
equipment; nor was the Commodore indulged in any such luxuries as
marmalade of carrots or inspissated juice of wort and beer. The
foundation of a colony was evidently not a matter of much
importance compared with a voyage of discovery in search of a new
continent towards the South Pole.</p>
<p>Phillip's last letter from England was written on board the
Sirius, then lying on the Motherbank, off the Isle of Wight, on
the 11th May. Notwithstanding all his efforts to comply with the
repeated orders to sail as soon as possible, he had not been able
to satisfy himself about the supply of necessaries, and was
obliged to sail without the "women's cloathes", which had been so
neglected by the authorities. Much as those articles were needed,
however, and anxious as he was to provide for the comfort of the
women, he would not "wait a single hour" for the missing
garments, but would be on his way to the new land "as soon as
there is the least chance of getting down Channel."</p>
<blockquote>Since my letter of this morning, I have seen the
bread which the contractor offered for the convicts, in the room
of what was to be baked, and which could not have been ready
before Monday&#8212; it is good, though coarse, and I have
ordered it to be sent on board this evening.<br>
<br>
The order Major Ross received from the Admiralty respecting the
marines has the following words: "To be properly victualled by a
Commissary." On this they grounded their letters of complaint;
but this business is now settled&#8212;all are satisfied I return
you Lord Sydney's letter, and hope we shall not give you any
further trouble. Had I sailed when first I came down, some of the
ships must have gone short of water, which is not yet compleat,
but will, I hope, this evening; and we must likewise have left
all the necessaries for the sick behind (they not coming down
before last night), as well as a great deal of provisions; in
fact, it was not possible to sail before this day, and now,
unfortunately, the wind is westerly and blows fresh The reason
the contractor assigns for not having the provisions on board
sooner was, having only three ovens to bake the bread, and in
doing which he has lost no time since he received the Navy
Board's order. I shall not lose a moment after there is the least
chance of getting down Channel; on that you may depend.<br>
<br>
No spirits can be received at present on board any of the ships;
but the greatest economy will be used in purchasing as much as
the ship can stow when in the Brazil, where it is reasonable.<br>
<br>
I have received the warrant for appointing Courts-martial, the
Articles of War, and the order for the Commissary's purchasing
three years' spirits. The two letters for the Vice-Kings and the
Governor of the Cape are not yet received; but I must beg of you,
my dear sir, to point out to the Navy Board that for women's
cloathes I have no resource, and desire them to order that they
may be sent down. The agent for the transports, who has
corresponded with that Board on the subject, says he has expected
them for some time. Be assured that I shall not wait a single
hour for them after it is possible to sail. I had desired that
the Sirius and Supply, armed tender, might not be paid the two
months' advance till the day before I intended to sail, and that
was done yesterday.<br>
<br>
It is not in my power to send you my lists at present more
correct than those you have received from Major Ross; but you
shall have one by the return of the Hy&#230;na, for I hope we
shall not remain here long enough to make it out, as it will take
some days to examine the different ships.</blockquote>
<p>And having at last got his ships as well provided for the
voyage as he could contrive to do, by repeated appeals to the
authorities at Whitehall, he closed his correspondence with
Nepean for the time, with a passage in which he allowed himself
to become prophetic:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Once more I take my leave of you, fully sensible of
the trouble you have had in this business, for which at present I
can only thank you; but at a future period, when this country
feels the advantages that are to be drawn from our intended
settlement, you will enjoy a satisfaction that will, I am sure,
make you ample amends.</blockquote>

The same mistake was made when H.M.S. Calcutta was sent out in
1803 to establish a colony at Port Phillip. "'The people
wherewith you plant', says Lord Bacon in his Essay on
Plantations, 'ought to be gardeners, ploughmen, labourers,
smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers, with some few
apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and bakers.' How little such a
selection is attended to in the transportation of convicts to New
South Wales was sufficiently exemplified on board the Calcutta,
where, out of three hundred and seven convicts, there were but
eight carpenters and joiners, three smiths, one gardener, twenty
labouring farmers, two fishermen, nine taylors, and four
stonemasons. The remainder may be classed under the heads of
gentlemen's servants, hair-dressers, hackney coachmen, chairmen,
silk-weavers, calico-printers, watch-makers, lapidaries,

Phillip had evidently read Captain Cook's account of the attempt
made by the natives on the Endeavour River to burn his tents by
setting fire to the grass, on the 9th July, 1770, because he
would not give them any turtle. But as Cook made no mention of
"several islands" in Port Jackson, while he described Port
Stephens as an inlet sheltered from all winds, with "three small
islands" at the entrance, Phillip was probably thinking of that
port.&#8212;Hawkesworth, vol. iii, p. 508.</p>

<h3>1.7 A VAIN PETITION. <small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>WHILE</small> Phillip was thus employed in getting his
ships ready for sea&#8212;running backwards and forwards between
the Navy and the Victualling Boards, the Admiralty and
Whitehall&#8212; two Roman Catholic priests came forward with a
petition addressed to Lord Sydney, praying that they might be
allowed to go out with the Fleet as spiritual advisers to their
co-religionists on board. In a letter addressed, without date, to
his lordship, one of them pointed out that there were probably
not less than three hundred of the convicts belonging to their
denomination, woefully in need of religious instruction, and
earnestly desirous that some minister of their own faith might be
suffered to go with them. He also urged that the presence of
Catholic priests among them might not only be of great service in
cultivating a spirit of obedience to their officers, but might be
the means of making them in the end useful members of society in
the new world. The appeal was thus adroitly based on political as
well as religious grounds; but unfortunately it made no
impression on the Minister. The prayer was not granted; and
judging from the fact that no reply to the letter can be found
among the records, it may be inferred that none was sent.
<a href="#note-083" name="noteref-083" id=
"noteref-083">{1}</a></p>
<blockquote>My Lord,&#8212;You have been apprised of the desire
which two clergymen of the Catholic persuasion have to instruct
the convicts, who are of their faith, who are destined for Botany
Bay. I beg leave to inform your lordship of my sentiments
concerning their request. There are not less probably than three
hundred, ignorant, you may imagine, of every principle of duty to
God and man. The number is great, and consequently constitutes an
object of consequence to every man who has the happiness of his
neighbours at heart That the Catholics of this country are not
only of inoffensive principles, but that they are zealously
attached to the Constitution of it, I may presume, is well known
to your lordship. For my part, who am one of those clergymen who
wish to take care of the convicts of my persuasion, I beg to
acquaint your lordship that if I be so happy as to be permitted
to go, that I trust my endeavours to bring these unhappy people
to a proper sense of their duty as subjects and citizens may be
attended with some salutary consequence. They earnestly desire
some Catholic clergyman may go with them, and I trust to the
known humanity of Government that a request which seems to
promise some hopes of their reformation will not be denied. It is
well known that these people will not pay the attention to other
ministers which they do to their own. Perhaps, also, the presence
of such may be of great use to make them readily obey every order
of their governors, and I have no doubt our conduct will meet the
approbation of them.<br>
<br>
I sincerely pity these poor people, not so much for the
disagreeable situation into which they have brought themselves,
as for the misdemeanours which have made them deserving of it.
Yet I trust, if their ignorance be removed, and their obligations
as men and Christians be forcibly inculcated to them, that this
may be a means under Providence of their becoming useful to
themselves, and perhaps afterwards to their country.<br>
<br>
At least this I sincerely wish, nor do I think I can ever be as
happy elsewhere as in the place of their destination, employed in
using my endeavours to bring them out of the wretched state of
depravity into which they have fallen. I entreat, therefore, most
humbly that this our request may be granted. These poor people
will bless and thank you. I shall take care that they be not
forgetful of their obligations to Government and Lord
Sydney.</blockquote>

WALSHE</small>,     <br>
Priest    </p>
<blockquote>My lord,&#8212;We are not so presumptuous as to wish
support from Government; we offer our voluntary services; we
hope, however, not to offend in entreating for our
passage.</blockquote>
<p>If the statement made by Mr. Justice Burton on the authority
of the Rev. Samuel Marsden represents the facts of the case, Lord
Sydney's indifference to the Roman Catholic appeal needs no
explanation. Ministers of religion, whatever the sect they might
belong to, did not appear to the official mind as at all
necessary members of a colonising expedition. Whether or not the
appointment of a chaplain to the First Fleet was obtained only
through the intervention of Sir Joseph Banks at the last moment,
there is no doubt that the subsequent expedition to Port
Essington sailed without any chaplain at all. The neglect in one
case is the best explanation that can be given of the
indifference in the other.</p>
<p>It would certainly not be just to find fault with Phillip,
because, while engaged in cataloguing in his "memo." all the
needful means he could think of for governing the peculiar people
committed to his charge, he did not see the necessity for
providing a moral police force as well as an armed one. Neither
to him nor to Lord Sydney did it occur that any better means of
control for such a population could be found than those which had
already been provided, in the shape of marines with fixed
bayonets. It was not until Phillip had begun to form his
settlement at Sydney Cove that the serious nature of the
oversight presented itself to his mind. One of the very first
things he had to do was to appoint overseers or superintendents
for the purpose of keeping the convicts in order; but no men of
the proper kind having been sent out, he was obliged to appoint
convicts to that position. The inevitable results soon made their
appearance; the so-called superintendents were either unable or
unwilling to exercise any authority over the men, who were thus
left to please themselves about the way in which their work
should be done. Under such circumstances, it was a very difficult
matter to get any work out of them at all. In this exigency
Phillip was driven to appeal to the military for assistance, and
accordingly requested the officers of the garrison to exercise
their influence over the men by encouraging those whom they saw
disposed to be diligent, and threatening the idle and disorderly
with punishment. The officers, under Major Ross's instructions,
bluntly refused to do anything of the kind, saying that they
would not "interfere with the convicts" in any shape, except as a
garrison force.</p>
<p>The most essential means for the good government of the
community was thus absolutely wanting, and the natural results
soon showed themselves. It might have been foreseen in the first
instance that physical force alone is not enough to rule any
people, even the most degraded; and that without some efficient
moral influence at work, it is not possible to keep the
constituent elements of society in working order. The defect was
first felt by Phillip in the absence of overseers&#8212;the
non-commissioned officers, so to speak, whose services he needed
so much from day to day. But it was afterwards felt in the
absence of a sufficient number of religious instructors, as well
as of ordinary teachers. No schoolmaster, or teacher of any kind,
formed part of the first establishment, although there were many
children among the soldiers' families as well as among the
convicts; and although it must have been known that even the men
and women needed instruction in one way as much as the children
did in another. One minister of religion only had been sent
out&#8212;the Rev. Richard Johnson, "one of the people called
<i>Methodists</i>"; <a href="#note-084" name="noteref-084" id=
"noteref-084">{2}</a> and he was loft to preach in the open air
until he found means to put up a thatch-roofed building for
religious service. Had the petition of the Roman Catholic priests
met with more consideration than it did, Phillip's labours would
have been greatly lessened in his efforts to reform the degraded
characters around him. The combined influence of the clergy would
have been on his side, and he might have been spared the
humiliation of applying to the marines for aid in one of his
greatest difficulties, and being refused. He was thus forced to
govern with the lash and the hangman's rope.</p>
<p>How much misery and how much crime might have been avoided had
Lord Sydney and his colleagues but recognised one of the simplest
truths in political philosophy, by arming Phillip with the moral
and religious assistance he required, may be left to conjecture.
But in this, as in many other instances, may be seen how hard and
merciless was the age in which they lived. The statesmen of that
time had not yet learned that every government lives under a
moral obligation to prevent crime as well as to punish it; and
when, notwithstanding the severity of their laws, they found its
growth unchecked, they saw no other remedy but that of increased
severity. A short shrift and a bloody shroud was the usual fate
of the unhappy wretches condemned to die, even when the crime was
not more serious than a theft committed under the pressure of
hunger. Many of these criminals, too, were mere boys, in most
cases wholly uneducated, who had been left in childhood to seek
their means of living in the streets.</p>
<p>How the question of juvenile crime and depravity was looked at
by Pitt and his colleagues may be seen in a speech delivered by
the Solicitor-General in the House of Commons in June, 1785, when
moving for leave to bring in a bill 1787 "for the better securing
the peace." <a href="#note-085" name="noteref-085" id=
"noteref-085">{3}</a> After describing the extraordinary
prevalence of crime in the metropolis, he referred to "the crowds
that every two or three months fell a sacrifice to the justice of
their country, with whose weight the gallows groaned"; and he
then mentioned "as a certain truth, that of the whole number
hanged in the metropolis, eighteen out of every twenty were under
the age of twenty-one." To remedy this evil, the Government
proposed&#8212;not to establish a system of State schools
combined with juvenile reformatories&#8212;but to effect certain
changes in the regulation of the police. There was no proposal to
deal with juvenile delinquents as they are dealt with in the
present day; they were left to take their chance as before.
Something might be done, he seemed to think, for&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>friendless and deserted children who were at present
picked up at the age of eight years and regularly educated to the
trade of villainy. He should wish them to be taken up and sent to
the Marine Society; but as the governors of that institution
might possibly object, on the ground of temporary inconvenience,
to take them in, he feared it would be necessary to find some
other establishment for them.</blockquote>
<p>Beyond that, however, the Government were not prepared to so.
Legislators in those days, and in much later times, did not
believe in the efficacy of education as a means of preventing
crime. Sir Samuel Romilly mentions that in 1807 he supported a
bill which proposed to establish schools for the education of the
poor in all the parishes of England; but, he adds,&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"The bill will certainly be lost. Many persons think
that the subject requires further consideration and a more
matured plan; but I am afraid that a much greater portion of the
House think it expedient that the people should be kept in a
state of ignorance." <a href="#note-086" name="noteref-086" id=

Mr. Justice Burton, in his work on The State of Religion and
Education in New South Wales, published in 1840, states, on the
authority of the Rev. Samuel Marsden, who acted as chaplain in
the colony from 1794 to 1838, that "when the First Fleet was on
the point of sailing, in the year 1787, no clergyman had been
thought of, and that a friend of his own, a pious man of some
influence, anxious for the spiritual welfare of the convicts,
made a strong appeal to those in authority upon the subject, and
through the interest of the late Bishop Porteus with Sir Joseph
Banks the Rev. Richard Johnson was appointed chaplain."<br>

Burton also mentions, in a foot-note, that "an oversight equally

sailed "with upwards of five hundred souls, unprovided with any

<h3>1.8 THE FLEET AT SEA. <small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IT</small> was on the 13th of May that Phillip, having
hoisted his flag on board the Sirius as Commodore of the
squadron, gave the signal to weigh anchor, and the ships under
his command, one after another, spread their sails to the wind.
They were accompanied by another man-of-war, the Hy&#230;na, a
frigate of twenty-four guns, which was under orders to see them
clear of the Channel and bring back a final letter from Phillip.
The navigation of the Channel was the most difficult part of the
voyage; but good fortune was with them from the first, and the
ships got into the Atlantic without any accident. It was a week,
however, before Phillip could sit down and write his first
despatch. The sea was running high, and his table was so unsteady
that he could not write at ease; his despatch was therefore
merely a short note, addressed to Nepean. The Commodore was
evidently in good spirits; having cleared the Channel, "I look on
all our difficulty as ended." The only matter that seemed to
trouble him much was the "women's cloathing", which he had been
compelled to leave behind.</p>
<blockquote>As we are now nearly one hundred leagues clear of the
Channel, the Hy&#230;na leaves us this evening to return to
Plymouth, but the sea runs too high to send on board the
different transports to get any particular account of the state
of the convicts. I have therefore only to repeat what I said in
my last from the Motherbank, that a great part of the women's
cloathing was not come down from London when we sailed, nor did I
receive the letters for the Vice-King. The Provost-Marshal, who
had not been seen for a considerable time before we sailed, is
left behind, and as it will be very necessary to have such an
officer on the spot, I have ordered Mr. Henry Brewer to act as
such, and shall be glad if he is approved of. I enclose a copy of
the last returns, and shall send you a more particular account
from Teneriffe. At present our motion is such that I find it very
difficult to sit at table; but the weather is good, and tho' the
Charlotte and Lady Penrhyn sail very badly, the clearing the
Channel is one great point gained, and with which I look on all
our difficulty as ended.</blockquote>
<p>But one difficulty was no sooner ended than another presented
itself in an unexpected shape:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Since I sealed my letters I have received a report
from the officers on board the Scarborough respecting the
convicts, who, it is said, have formed a scheme for taking
possession of the ship. I have order'd the ringleaders on board
the Sirius, and should not mention the affair at this moment, as
I have no time to enter into particulars, but that I suppose it
will be mentioned in letters from that ship. I did intend to
write to Lord Sydney, but it is late, and I wish the boats on
board the different ships. You may assure his lordship of my
respects, and tell him the reason that prevents my writing to
him.</blockquote>
<p>Two of the ringleaders in this conspiracy were flogged, and
then removed into another ship. The sudden extinction of their
scheme produced a wholesome effect on the minds of the convicts,
for they seem to have remained quiet during the rest of the
voyage. A different tale is told by the records in the Home
Office of a similar conspiracy which took place a few years
previously. The ship Mercury, bound to America with one hundred
and seventy convicts on board, was seized by them; the captain
and his officers were put in irons "after a very bloody
resistance, in which many of the convicts were wounded"; but the
men having brought the ship into Torbay, their career was very
soon closed. "They hoisted out the boat, and about sixty went on
shore, armed; a second attempt to land was made by the remainder
next morning; but the captain and his people, having got free
from their chains", and obtained assistance from a King's ship,
immediately secured them.</p>
<p>It was not until the ship cast anchor in the harbour of Santa
Cruz in the Isle of Teneriffe, on the 3rd June, that Phillip had
an opportunity of seeing the whole of the people committed to his
charge. He found them quiet and contented, but noticed some
"compleat villains" among them. During their stay in port, they
shared with the crews and marines the good things provided for
them, in the shape of fresh meat, vegetables, and fruit, for the
purpose of protecting them against attacks of scurvy. While here,
Phillip wrote a letter to Lord Sydney, in which he mentioned the
singular fact discovered after they had set sail, that the
marines had been sent to sea without any supply of "musquet
balls", or even paper for making "musquet cartridges." It was
fortunate that the convicts did not make the same discovery while
they were at sea.</p>
<blockquote>I have the honor to inform your lordship that I
anchored here the 3rd inst. with his Majesty's ship under my
command, the Supply, tender, store-ships, and transports.<br>
<br>
By the enclosed list your lordship will see that the convicts are
not so sickly as when we sailed, and while we remain here the
Commissary will be able to procure them fresh meat at a very
moderate expense.<br>
<br>
I understood when the marines who were to form the garrison were
embarked that they would be furnished with ammunition, but since
we sailed find that they were only supplied with what was
necessary for immediate service while in port, and we have
neither musquet balls nor paper for musquet cartridges, nor have
we any armourers' tools to keep small arms in repair.<br>
<br>
I am therefore to request that your lordship will be pleased to
give orders that those articles may be sent out by the first
ship, and for which, as well as for the women's cloathing that
was left behind, we shall be much distressed. I hope the
transports will be able to compleat their water by the 9th, and
shall not lose an hour after that is done.</blockquote>
<p>He wrote at the same time to Nepean:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have the pleasure of informing you that I anchored
here the 3rd, late in the evening, and by the returns made to
Lord Sydney you will see that the convicts are in a better state
than when we sailed.<br>
<br>
The procuring fresh meat being absolutely necessary, and wishing
that it would be done with as little expense to Government as
possible, I have ordered bread to be issued to the marines and
convicts from the store-ships, for it could not be got here but
at a very high price. The butter intended for the use of the
garrison will be good for very little, and much wasted before we
land from being in single firkins. A proportion of butter I have
therefore ordered also to be served while we remain here, and by
which means the marines and convicts will have fresh provisions
at a less expense to Government (including the value of the
biscuit and butter) than if they had continued on salt
provisions.<br>
<br>
As we have sailed without either musquet cartridges for the use
of the garrison, or paper or ball to make them, we shall have
none but what little the Sirius can supply. This I have mentioned
in my letter to Lord Sydney. Nor have we any tools to keep the
small arms in repair, the want of which will put us to many
inconveniences.<br>
<br>
In my letter by the Hy&#230;na I mentioned the apprehensions the
officers of the Scarborough were under, and tho' I did not think
they had reason to be seriously alarmed, as some of the convicts
had behaved very ill, two of the supposed ringleaders were
ordered on board the Sirius, punished, and then sent on board the
Prince of Wales, where they still remain. In general the convicts
have behaved well. I saw them all yesterday for the first time;
they are quiet and contented, tho' there are amongst them some
compleat villains.<br>
<br>
I shall sail the moment the transports have compleated their
water, and hope that will be done by Saturday or Sunday. The
Spanish packet that sails this afternoon gives me this
opportunity of writing, and I shall leave duplicate to be
forwarded by the next conveyance, as it will be a very
considerable time after this before I shall have an opportunity
of writing again.<br>
<br>
As the store-ships cannot receive any more wine for the garrison,
spirits will be procured for them at Rio de Janeiro.</blockquote>
<p>The next port at which they touched was that of Rio de
Janeiro, where they anchored on the 6th August and remained till
the 4th September. The time was pleasantly spent by the English
officers, the Viceroy insisting on showing his guests every
possible mark of attention&#8212;Phillip being accorded the same
honours as himself. He had not forgotten that Phillip had served
for some time in the Portuguese navy during the war with Spain,
and as the Englishman could speak the Portuguese language freely,
their intercourse was free from the usual difficulties
experienced by foreigners. The reception met with at Rio forms a
striking contrast with the treatment to which Captain Cook was
subjected during his stay in the same port, in November, 1768. No
person on board his ship was allowed to land, except himself, and
he was attended by an officer wherever he went&#8212;a
distinction he would gladly have dispensed with. <a href=
"#note-087" name="noteref-087" id="noteref-087">{1}</a></p>
<p>The letters written at Rio say very little about the
hospitalities shown by the Viceroy, but they give very minute
details about matters connected with the fleet and the people on
board. The first letter to Lord Sydney was a short
one:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Having sailed from Teneriffe the 10th of June, I
anchored off this harbour the 5th of this month, of which I had
the honor of informing your lordship by a ship that past us, and
the 6th, in the evening, anchored in the harbour with the tender,
store-ships, and transports.<br>
<br>
I inclose returns of the detachment and of the convicts, who, as
well as the officers and seamen belonging to the ships, continue
very healthy.<br>
<br>
In my letter to Mr. Nepean I have mentioned particulars
respecting the provisions, spirits, &amp;c., procured here, and I
have the honor of assuring your lordship that every little
assistance we have wanted in this port has been most readily
granted by the Vice-King, and to whom I feel myself under
particular obligations for the attention he has shown to me and
the officers under my command.<br>
<br>
The convicts have been very plentifully supplied with fresh
provisions, and that at a small expense, 3&#190;d. a head per
day, all expenses included. The allowance of meat to the convicts
has been 20 oz. every day, and they are much healthier than when
we left England. Only fifteen convicts and one marine's child
have died since we left Spithead.</blockquote>
<p>This was followed by a longer communication, chiefly
remarkable for its reference to the purchase of rum at Rio. Even
Phillip's sagacity did not enable him to foresee the dangerous
consequences likely to follow from its use in the settlement, and
he made his purchase of "one hundred and fifteen pipes of rum"
with as little suspicion as if it had been so much small beer.
Captain Tench informs us that the Portuguese at Rio had not
"learnt the art of making palatable rum", the quantity purchased
being "very ill-flavoured."</p>
<blockquote>By my letters of the 5th and 10th of June from Santa
Cruz, I had the honor of informing you of the impossibility of
receiving any wine on board for the use of the garrison, that the
marines and convicts received six days' fresh provisions, and
that the Commissary had drawn for &#163;76 1s. 9d., the expenses
at that port. I likewise mentioned the slops for the women not
being sent down before we sailed, and the want of musquet balls
and paper cartridges for the use of the garrison, as likewise
tools to keep the small arms in repair; those articles will, I
hope, be sent out in the ship that goes for the bread-fruit.<br>
<br>
The Provost-Martial having remained in England, I recommended Mr.
Henry Brewer as a proper person to fill that post, and I shall
order him to do the duty till I receive instructions on that
head.<br>
<br>
With respect to the women's cloathing, it was made of very slight
materials, much too small, and in general came to pieces in a few
weeks. If materials are sent out, it will be much cheaper to
Government, and the cloathes will be better made.<br>
<br>
As few vegetables could be procured at Santa Cruz, I should have
stopped for twenty-four hours at Port Praya, <a href="#note-088"
name="noteref-088" id="noteref-088">{2}</a> but when off that
port light airs of wind and a strong current making it probable
some of the ships might not get in, I did not think it prudent to
attempt it.<br>
<br>
We anchored off Rio Janeiro the 5th of this month, of which I had
an opportunity of informing you by a ship that passed us, and the
6th, in the evening, got into the harbour with the Supply tender,
store-ships, and transports.<br>
<br>
I have the pleasure of saying that every assistance we have
wanted in this port has been most readily granted.<br>
<br>
One hundred and fifteen pipes of rum has been purchased for the
use of the garrison, when landed, and for the use of the
detachment at this port.<br>
<br>
The marines and convicts have had fresh provisions since in port,
and as I found at Teneriffe that &#190; lb. of beef was not
sufficient for a convict for the day, and that no butter or
cheese could be procured here, the beef being exceedingly good
and very cheap, I ordered each person victualled by the
Commissary 1&#188; lb. of beef and 1 lb. of rice, and to the
children of the marines and convicts &#190; lb. of meat and 1 lb.
of rice, with vegetables each day.<br>
<br>
The marines and their wives have had the usual quantity of
spirits. The allowance for the convicts when at sea being so
small was the reason I ordered them, while in port, the same
allowance as the officers and men belonging to the garrison,
spirits excepted. The victualling all these, who are under the
inspection of the Commissary, including fixing and every other
expense, amounts to no more than 3&#190;d. a head per day.<br>
<br>
Wine is not to be bought at present but from those who retail it,
there being none in store, consequently is dearer than in
general, and the rum on our coming in, there being little in the
place, rose more than 25 per cent.<br>
<br>
One hundred sacks of casava <a href="#note-089" name=
"noteref-089" id="noteref-089">{3}</a> have been purchased, which
will be issued to the convicts when the bread is expended, and
will be cheaper to Government; it costs only 5s.
8<small><small><b>7/8</b></small></small>d., and the sacks, being
of strong Russia, will be used hereafter in cloathing the
convicts many of whom are nearly naked.<br>
<br>
As the Vice-King offered anything the King's stores furnished
that might be wanted, ten thousand musquet balls have been
purchased from the arsenal, the Sirius not being able to supply
the garrison with a sufficient quantity to serve till ball might
be sent from England.<br>
<br>
Before we sailed from Portsmouth two medicine-chests were fitted
for the transports that had none, and at Teneriffe soap was
bought to repay what the convicts had received before we sailed
from England from the marines. These articles and some few others
were too trifling to draw for on the Treasury, and were paid by
me.<br>
<br>
Some expenses have now attended the procuring seeds and plants
that could not be purchased, and it will be necessary to satisfy
those people whose store we have occupied with some tents that
have been damaged and sent on shore to air, and where we have had
officers and men since we have been here, with the timekeeper and
the necessary instruments to determine its rate of going; as
likewise the captain of the port, with his boat's crew, who, the
day we came in, attended to give any assistance the transports
might want, we then having only a light air of wind, and this I
do, having refused the paying the customary fees which are paid
by their own merchants' ships as well as strangers. It is &#163;3
12s. on coming in, the same on going out, and 5s. 6d. a day while
they remain at anchor in the port. This was demanded for the
transports, but never insisted on after I had said it could not
be paid, as the ships had King's stores on board. And as these
articles are such as do not permit vouchers, I have not thought
it right to order the Commissary to pay them, but have drawn on
the Treasury for &#163;135, which will be sufficient for the
whole. It is little more than half the sum which must have been
paid for the store, had it been hired.<br>
<br>
With respect to the convicts, they have been all allowed the
liberty of the deck in the day, and many of them during the
night, which has kept them much healthier than could have been
expected.<br>
<br>
It has been necessary, that the store-ships might receive the
spirits, to move part of the provisions from them into the
transports, and I am sorry to say that, what with some of the
provisions being in very slight casks, and very little attention
having been paid to the stowage, we have had much trouble in
moving the casks, and some tents and slops that were only in
wrappers were damaged. I fear many articles will be destroyed
before they are landed, and which it is not now possible to
prevent.<br>
<br>
I have been able to procure all such fruit and plants as I think
likely to thrive on the coast of New South Wales, particularly
the coffee, indigo, cotton, and cochineal.</blockquote>
<p>In a letter written at Rio to Nepean, Phillip referred to an
official reception at the Viceroy's palace, but made no attempt
to describe the ceremonies:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The 21st being the Prince of Portugal's birthday, and
the Vice-King receiving the compliments of all the officers, I
waited on him with those I had presented to him on our arrival.
The Sirius fired twenty-one guns, having the flag of Portugal
hoisted at the fore-topmast, and the Union at the mizen. He
seemed much pleased with this compliment, and we part perfectly
satisfied with each other.<br>
<br>
Three slight shocks of an earthquake have been felt at Trinidad,
where the Portuguese still keep a small garrison.</blockquote>
<p>Surgeon White has left us a pretty account of a reception at
the palace, on the occasion of Phillip's final visit <a href=
"#note-090" name="noteref-090" id=
"noteref-090">{4}</a>:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>On our landing, the same officer who had attended us
upon every other public occasion conducted us to the
presence-chamber. As we passed, every military and public honour
was paid to the Commodore; the colours were laid at his feet, as
they hitherto had been whenever he landed in his public
character; a token of respect that is never bestowed on any
person but the Governor himself. When we arrived at the palace,
an officer of the household, who was waiting to receive us,
conducted us through a most delightful recess, hung round with
bird-cages, whose inhabitants seemed to vie with each other both
in the melody of their notes and the beauty of their plumage. The
passage we walked through was adorned on each side with
odoriferous flowers and aromatic shrubs; which, while they
charmed the eye, spread a delightful fragrance around. This
passage led to a private room, on the outside of the door of
which we were received by the Viceroy, who stood uncovered, and
noticed each person separately in the most friendly and polite
manner. His excellency preceded us into the room, and having
requested all of us to be seated, placed himself by the Commodore
in a position that fronted us. In return for oar thanks, he said,
"it gave him infinite pleasure and satisfaction to find that the
place had afforded us the supplies we stood in need of." To this
he added that "the attention of the inhabitants, which we were
good enough to notice, was much short of his wishes." "We then
arose and took our leave; but not before his excellency had
expressed a desire of hearing from the Commodore, with an account
of his success in the establishment of the new
colony.</blockquote>
<p>A final letter was written to Nepean on the 3rd
September&#8212;the day before the fleet sailed from Rio. Phillip
had every reason to be satisfied with the attentions paid to him
and his officers during their stay there, which evidently formed
a very pleasant break in the long voyage. Everything had gone
well so far; but his letters show the extreme anxiety with which
he scrutinised every detail connected with the health of his
people.</p>
<blockquote>I have been prevented sailing this morning from the
accounts being not yet finally settled&#8212;that is, the
vouchers not yet sent off. I sail to-morrow, and at the Cape
shall have more time, for here, as the only one that understands
the language, I have been obliged to be linguist and commissary.
By the master of the Sirius you will have some private as well as
public letters, and by a ship going to Lisbon you will receive
this and copies of my public letters sent by the master; who, as
he met with his accident in doing his duty on board the ship,
will, I hope, get some little provision.<br>
<br>
I have told you in one of my letters how far the Vice-King (the
same who was here when I past for India) has carried his
politeness, and that tho' I desired much to be received here as
the captain of the Sirius only, and for which I had particular
reason, he refused my request, and gave it out in orders that I
received the same honor as himself, that is, as Captain-General.
This has prevented my having any house on shore, and that for
obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
I have endeavored to explain to Mr. Rose why I have drawn on the
Treasury for &#163;135. The little matters paid by me when the
ships were at Portsmouth, and the expenses here in procuring
seeds and plants that are not publicly sold, could not be paid
for by the Commissary. To have hired a store and the island would
have been more than the whole sum. The things have been grants as
favours, but returns expected, and I made them first at my own
expense, till I found I was &#163;100 out of pocket, and then
thought that Government had not been so very liberal to me as to
make it necessary to pay such a compliment.<br>
<br>
If I can preserve the seeds and plants procured here, I shall be
very indifferent about those articles at the Cape. Sir Joseph
Banks will receive from the master a small box that contains some
plants he was very anxious to procure.<br>
<br>
The rams are in good health, and my breeding sows, as well as the
ladies, seem well calculated for the end proposed.<br>
<br>
I intend making a very short stay at the Cape, as the ships are
now in much better order than when they left
England.</blockquote>
<p>The last letter written on the voyage out was addressed to
Nepean from the Cape of Good Hope, undated. The fleet had
anchored in Table Bay on the 13th October, and remained there
till the 12th of the following month. Mynheer Von Graaffe, the
Dutch Governor of the Cape, did not pay such attentions to his
visitors as the Viceroy of the Brazils had done; but they were
supplied with provisions for the fleet, as well as the plants and
live stock required for the colony.</p>
<blockquote>You will please to inform the Right Hon. the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty that I sailed from Rio Janeiro the
4th of September and anchored here the 13th of October with the
ships under my command. Having immediately on my arrival
requested permission to procure refreshments and such provisions
as were wanted for her Majesty's ship Sirius and Supply tender, I
was informed that, the crops of corn having failed the year
before last, the inhabitants had been reduced to the greatest
distress, and that I could not be permitted to purchase any flour
or bread. I, however, obtained an order for three days' bread for
all the ships; and as I found on inquiry that the last year's
crops had been very good, I requested, by letter to the Governor
and Council, permission to purchase what provisions were wanted
for the Sirius and Supply, as likewise corn for seed, and what
was necessary for the live stock intended to be embarked at this
place. The three days granted for the bread being expired, leave
was given for three days longer, and which permission was
afterwards continued till the 23rd, when I received an answer
from the Council, who had taken that time to deliberate on my
letter of the 15th, granting permission to receive bread daily
for the use of the ships while we remained in this port, and the
same evening I received a letter from the Governor granting all
my demands.<br>
<br>
Our passage from Rio de Janeiro was very favourable. The number
of sick on our arrival here was twenty marines and ninety-three
convicts. The Sirius and Supply had only eight sick on board, and
as all the ships were very amply supplied with soft bread,
vegetables, and fresh meat, I did not think it necessary to land
any of the sick. Their lordships will see by the returns that
there are very few sick at present.<br>
<br>
We are now ready for sea. What live cattle the ships can stow are
now getting on board, with such grain and seeds as was wanted,
and I shall sail immediately. The remaining so long before I
could obtain leave to procure the necessaries we wanted has
detained me longer in this port than I wished, but it will, I
hope, be the means of keeping the people in health for the rest
of the passage.</blockquote>
<p>While at the Cape, Phillip availed himself of every
opportunity for the purpose of procuring the plants and seed
required for his farming operations. "As it was earnestly wished
to introduce the fruits of the Cape into the new settlement.
Captain Phillip was ably assisted in his endeavours to procure
the rarest and the best of every species, both in plant and seed,
by the King's botanist." <a href="#note-091" name="noteref-091"
id="noteref-091">{5}</a> The collection made, both at the Cape
and at Rio, included almost every kind of useful plant considered
likely to thrive in the new country. With most of them Phillip's
expectations were fully realised from the first; but it took time
and experience to learn that the coffee, cocoa, cotton, and
banana plants, collected at Rio, required a rather more tropical
climate than that of Botany Bay. Nor were the ipecacuanha and
jalap plants, laid in at Rio, destined to take any place in the
list of exports from the colony; but the orange, lime, and lemon
trees obtained there made ample amends for failure in other
directions. <a href="#note-092" name="noteref-092" id=
"noteref-092">{6}</a> The selection made at the Cape proved an
unqualified success; the plants included the vine, quince, apple,
pear, and strawberry, with the oak, myrtle, and fig trees, the
bamboo and the sugar-cane, as well as grain seed of every
kind.</p>
<p>Sheep, cattle, and horses were also obtained at the Cape, but
the selection was not made with anything like the care devoted to
the plants. All the stock taken on board on public account
were&#8212;one stallion, three mares, three colts, two bulls, six
cows, forty-four sheep, four goats, and twenty-eight hogs.
<a href="#note-093" name="noteref-093" id="noteref-093">{7}</a>
Phillip and the officers of the marines made private purchases on
their own account, but, as Captain Tench informs us, their
original intentions on this head were materially affected by the
prices they were asked to pay. This consideration probably
deterred Phillip from making a larger investment than he did; but
the list of his purchases seems painfully economical when
compared with the extent and nature of the territory for which
the stock was intended. With all his confidence in the future of
the colony, no idea of its capabilities for stock-breeding ever
entered his mind. The one fact which ultimately more than
satisfied all his predictions never oven occurred to him; and
hence it was that he sailed away from the Cape to the greatest
pastoral country in the world with a few head of cattle and
sheep, barely sufficient to stock the farm of an ordinary
settler.<br>

<h3>1.9 ENGLAND A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. <small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> fact that Phillip's expedition attracted
very little public attention in England is one of the most
striking circumstances connected with it. Measured by its
results, it may be said to have been one of the greatest events
in English history during the eighteenth century, just as Sir
Walter Raleigh's attempts to colonise North America formed one of
the greatest events of the sixteenth; but few except Phillip seem
to have formed any conception of its real importance. The
Ministers who organised it and carried it into execution
introduced it to the notice of Parliament simply as a plan for
the disposal of felons and the relief of gaols. No one in the
House of Commons had much to say about it. Lord Sydney claimed no
credit for it. Pitt never made any reference to it. Burke, whose
sympathy with the American colonists had been so strongly moved
for many years previously, and who, beyond all his
contemporaries, had learned to appreciate the importance of the
colonies, was silent upon the subject. He touched the skirts of
it, so to speak, in 1785, when he pleaded for some merciful
consideration towards the unfortunate people who were then
awaiting transportation, crowded together in the gaols to the
number of 100,000. The swampy coasts of Africa were then supposed
to be their destination. It was understood that the Government
had some design of establishing Convict settlements in that part
of the world, notwithstanding its known unhealthiness; and
probably Burke's protest against any such project, which he
pronounced inhuman, had some share in its ultimate abandonment.
There can be no doubt that "the idea of colonising Africa with
felons", to which he alluded, had assumed some shape, however
indefinite, in the minds of Ministers. The despatch of the
Nautilus to the African coast, to which Lord Sydney referred in
the letter already quoted, is sufficient evidence on that point.
The ship was sent on the recommendation of a Committee of the
House of Commons, to "explore the southern coast of Africa in
order to find out an eligible situation for the reception of
convicts, where, from their industry, they might soon be likely
to obtain means of subsistence"&#8212;in other words, to become
self-supporting. In pursuance of these instructions, the eastern
coast was carefully explored from Port Mozambique to the southern
borders of Kaffirland; but the report brought back by the
Nautilus was so unfavourable&#8212;the coast being pronounced
"unfit for settlements"&#8212;that the scheme was immediately
abandoned. The Government then fell back on the proposals made
for colonising New South Wales.</p>
<p>The silence which prevailed in Parliament with respect to the
Expedition was not owing to the existence of far more important
events, such as wars abroad or disturbances at home. It was a
year of profound peace in England. The long and disastrous
struggles in which the country had been engaged for many years
previously had been brought to an end shortly before. The war
with the American colonies, which began in 1775, was finally
closed in 1783; and the contest with France and her allies, Spain
and Holland, was brought to an end in the same year. For ten
years afterwards England lived at peace with her neighbours,
until the great war of the French Revolution broke out. There was
no foreign complication, therefore, to distract the national
attention while Sydney and his colleagues were maturing their
plans for the establishment of a new colony in the southern
hemisphere; and even supposing that all proposals of the kind had
become absolutely distasteful to the British public by reason of
their bitter experience in North America, it is difficult to find
a reasonable explanation of the profound indifference with which
the Expedition of 1787 was regarded in political circles. It did
not occur to the most far-sighted statesmen of the day that a new
empire might date its history from the day on which Commodore
Phillip's fleet should furl its sails in Botany Bay. There was no
Canning to rise in the House of Commons and declare that he had
called into existence a new world in order to redress the balance
of the old. If we turn to the political history of the time, in
order to ascertain the momentous questions which absorbed the
attention of Parliament, there is nothing that can be placed in
comparison, as a matter of historical importance, with the
colonisation of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The great subjects of parliamentary discussion at that time
have all faded more or less in to oblivion; even the speeches of
the most renowned orators of the day awake but a languid interest
in the reader. Perhaps no questions gave rise to greater
excitement in political and social circles during the year 1787
than those which turned on the rumoured marriage of the Prince of
Wales&#8212;afterwards George the Fourth&#8212;with Mrs.
Fitzherbert, and the payment of his Royal Highnesses debts.
Public interest became intense when Fox made his celebrated
declaration on "direct authority", that the alleged marriage "not
only never could have happened legally, but never did happen in
any way whatever." This sensation, however, had hardly subsided
than another took its place, when it became known that the
marriage had really happened after all, and that the great orator
had been painfully duped by his princely friend. Such were the
absorbing topics of discussion in the month of April, 1787; now,
they barely deserve a place in the history of the nation. During
Phillip's last days in England before the departure of the Fleet,
Burke, Fox, and Sheridan were addressing the House from day to
day on "the articles of charge against Mr. Hastings." On the 10th
of May, Burke's motion "that the said W. Hastings, esquire, be
impeached of High Crimes and Misdemeanors", having been carried,
the majority of the Commons immediately attended Mr. Burke to the
bar of the House of Peers, where he solemnly impeached Mr.
Hastings accordingly. On the following day he reported to the
House that he had been to the bar of the House of Lords in
obedience to their commands, The great and there, in the name of
the House of Commons and of all the Commons of Great Britain,
impeached Warren Hastings, esquire, of High Crimes and
Misdemeanors. <a href="#note-094" name="noteref-094" id=
"noteref-094">{1}</a> The ex-governor of Bengal then succeeded
the Prince of Wales as the centre of attraction in English
politics; Mrs. Fitzherbert and her marriage ceased to monopolise
the conversation of society, and the approaching trial before the
Peers was looked upon as one of the monumental events of English
history.</p>
<p>That was the great sensation of the day; and in the midst of
all the excitement it occasioned the Sirius and her convoy set
sail for their destination without the faintest demonstration of
public interest in the matter. It was not even recognised as a
national event in the historical records of the time. The
comprehensive summary of contemporary history originated by
Burke, and known as the Annual Register, made no mention of it in
its chronicle of passing events. <a href="#note-095" name=
"noteref-095" id="noteref-095">{2}</a> Strangely enough, the
indifference with which it was regarded at the time seems to have
influenced later historians to such an extent that they have all
apparently agreed to ignore it. Massey's History of the Reign of
George the Third, for instance&#8212;a work professedly written
"to illustrate not only the Political and the Military but the
Social History of England" during that period&#8212;does not
contain the slightest reference to it; and yet Massey wrote as
late as 1863. A history of the reign of Elizabeth, or of the
reign of James the First, which should make no mention of the
attempts to colonise North America, would certainly not be
considered either a complete or a philosophical one; but all the
histories that have been written of the times of George the Third
may be searched in vain for a sketch of Captain Phillip or an
account of the First Fleet. Had it been a secret expedition
against a Spanish outpost or a French colony, it would no doubt
have been watched with the liveliest interest, and its movements
would have figured conspicuously in the annals of the time; but
being nothing more than a colonising movement, there seems to
have been little in it either to attract the notice or touch the
sympathies of the nation. <a href="#note-096" name="noteref-096"

<h3>1.10 SIR JOSEPH BANKS. <small>[1787-1810]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THERE</small> were one or two sections of society, no
doubt, which may be supposed to have taken some active interest
in the movement. Cook's First Voyage of Discovery, written by
Hawkesworth and published in 1773, had made a deep impression on
the scientific mind at the time, and the feeling was revived when
it became known that the Government had determined to occupy the
territory which the celebrated seaman had explored on the east
coast of New Holland. The only living man of note who had any
personal knowledge of the country was Sir Joseph Banks, to whom
the nation was indebted for all that it cared to hear about New
South Wales. It was from his "accurate and circumstantial journal
of the voyage", <a href="#note-097" name="noteref-097" id=
"noteref-097">{1}</a> we may believe, that Hawkesworth wrote his
pretty descriptions of the meadows and lawns of Botany Bay, the
beautiful wild flowers, the birds of exquisite plumage, the
delightful climate, the kangaroo and the turtle, the Indians
fishing in their canoes, and the various incidents which the
explorers met with on their excursions inland. Sir Joseph was
President of the Royal Society, the most enthusiastic patron of
science known in English history, in great favour with George the
Third, and a man of unbounded influence with the Government
throughout the active portion of his life. "He it was," wrote
Lord Brougham, speaking from his personal knowledge of the man,
"who may be truly said to have planted and founded the colony of
Botany Bay." <a href="#note-098" name="noteref-098" id=
"noteref-098">{2}</a> If he was not the planter and founder of
the colony, he might be fairly described as its patron saint. He
was consulted by Lord Sydney before the Cabinet had resolved to
send a out an expedition, and it was on his recommendation that
the bay was fixed upon as "the site of the new intended
settlement." For many years afterwards and through many changes
of administration, his advice was sought on every matter of
importance connected with the colony. The collection of letters
and other documents which he left behind him at his death, known
as the Brabourne <a href="#note-099" name="noteref-099" id=
"noteref-099">{3}</a> papers. contains abundant evidence of the
anxious interest he continued to feel in the progress of the
settlement. Every one connected with it seemed to know that Sir
Joseph was the proper person to communicate with when anything
required to be done at head-quarters. Many striking instances
might be quoted from his correspondence; but the following will
be sufficient for the purpose.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Plate-1-4" id=
"Plate-1-4"></a><img alt="" src="1204171h-images/Plate-1-4.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Sir Joseph Banks</b></p>
<br>
<p>The Rev. Samuel Marsden, who came out to the colony in 1794
and who combined farming and wool-growing with his missionary
labours, wishing to obtain "some of the choicest fruits we have
not got, and also two good English rams", wrote him from Sydney,
on April 27th, 1803, and began by saying:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Honoured sir,&#8212;I flatter myself you will excuse
the liberty I bare taken in addressing these few lines to you.
Tho' I have not the honour of any personal knowledge of you, yet,
sir, from your known ardent wish to promote the good of the
colony, I have presumed to trouble you with this
sheet.</blockquote>
<p>Another correspondent, William Wilson, captain of merchant
ship, writing from Monument Yard on June 24th, 1806, mentioned
that when he commanded a ship six years previously he had sailed
to New South Wales, and had visited the island of Otaheite on
three occasions:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>By these voyages I have learnt that both the
islanders there, and the colonists of New South Wales, justly
look up to you as the patron and promoter of their
prosperity.</blockquote>
<p>And in a memorial which Wilson enclosed, praying for relief
against the arbitrary action of the East India Company in seizing
a ship and cargo of seal skins and oil from the colony, he
said:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The colony of New South Wales and its dependencies,
daily rising in importance to the mother country, the
inhabitants, many of whom have never forfeited one priviledge of
British subjects, look homeward with anxiety for encouragement to
the industry which is excited among them. In their remote
situation, solicitude for a conservator of their rights and a
promoter of their welfare naturally directs their attention to
you, honourable sir, who from the circumstance of your assent to
the settlement being made, it is hoped will, by a continuance of
support, not only be instrumental in rendering the colonists
comfortable in a great degree among themselves, but even be the
means of carrying civilisation and all the blessings connected
with it to the thousands of islanders in their
neighbourhood.</blockquote>
<p>In many letters written by Matthew Flinders in 1801 on board
H.M.S. Investigator at Sheerness, before his departure on the
voyage which made him famous, the writer poured out his thanks to
Sir Joseph for all that he had already done on his behalf.
Flinders seems to have consulted him on every point connected
with his expedition, especially when it was necessary to stir up
the Navy and Victualling Boards, or to approach the Lords of the
Admiralty for some special concession. And when mentioning that
he had at last received his commission, he added that he felt
himself entirely indebted to Sir Joseph's influence and kindness
for it. In other letters, written from the Isle of France in
1804-5-6-7, when poor Flinders was kept in close confinement as a
State prisoner by the French Governor de Caen, he appealed to "my
patron", Sir Joseph, for assistance in his calamity.</p>
<p>Another unfortunate officer in the navy figures prominently
among his correspondents. One of the earliest letters in the
collection is from William Bligh, the celebrated lieutenant of
the Bounty. It is dated August 6th, 1787, and confirms Brougham's
statement that it was Sir Joseph "who suggested the means of
transplanting the bread-fruit tree from the South Sea Islands to
the West Indies." Bligh wrote immediately after his arrival in
London:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I arrived yesterday from Jamaica, and should
instantly have paid my respects to you had not Mr. Campbell told
me you were not to return from the country until Thursday. I have
heard the flattering news of your great goodness to me, intending
to honor me with the command of the vessel which you propose to
go to the South Seas.</blockquote>
<p>This letter is followed by a series of other communications
from Bligh, written in the same strain. One of the most
remarkable is dated from Timor, June 14th, 1789&#8212;two days
after he had arrived there&#8212;enclosing a narrative of the
mutiny among the sailors of the Bounty, and of his voyage in the
open boat to Timor. "I have not given so full an account to the
Admiralty", he says. The correspondence was continued for many
years afterwards, including the period during which he was
Governor of New South Wales. In one of his letters, dated 30th
June, 1808, he gave his patron a lengthy "account of the
Rebellion" headed by Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston. On both these
occasions Bligh's first thought evidently was to place Sir Joseph
Banks in possession of the facts of his case; reporting events to
him with as much minuteness as if he had been writing a despatch
to the official head of his department. His unfortunate history
for twenty years reveals itself with curious distinctness in the
discoloured but still legible sheets, of paper preserved by his
friend.</p>
<p>There was no point of resemblance between Flinders and Bligh
as regards personal character; but each of them was a victim of
unexpected disaster, and each showed the same attachment to Sir
Joseph Banks. It is curious to observe how they both turned
instantly and hopefully to him when misfortune overtook them, as
if they felt instinctively that either his hand must help them,
or none at all.</p>
<p>These are memorable instances of the singular influence
exercised by Sir Joseph with respect to men and matters connected
with New South Wales. A remarkable illustration of his fatherly
interest in it may be found in a draft letter written by him to
the Secretary of the Treasury in June, 1798. The necessity for
exploring the interior of the colony with a view to the
development of its resources had evidently occupied his
attention; and in the course of his letter he sketched out a plan
for the purpose, in which he seems to have felt great confidence.
He began by pointing out how much this matter had been
neglected:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We have now possessed the country of New South Wales
more than ten years; and so much has the discovery of the
interior been neglected that no one article has hitherto been
discovered, by the importation of which the mother country can
receive any degree of return for the cost of founding and
hitherto maintaining the colony.</blockquote>
<p>A country so extensive must possess a large river system and
raw material of some kind:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It is impossible to conceive that such a body of
land, as large as all Europe, does not produce vast rivers
capable of being navigated into the heart of the interior; or
that, if properly investigated, such a country, situate in a most
fruitful climate, should not produce some native raw material of
importance to such a manufacturing country as England
is.</blockquote>
<p>A celebrated traveller had just arrived in England, fresh from
the work of exploration:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Mr Mungo Park, <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"
id="noteref-100">{4}</a> lately returned from a journey in
Africa, where he penetrated farther into the inland than any
European before has done, by several hundred miles, and
discovered an immense navigable river running westward, which
offers the means of penetrating into the centre of that vast
continent, ... offers himself as a volunteer to be employed in
exploring the interior of New Holland, by its rivers or
otherwise, as may in the event be found most
expedient.</blockquote>
<p>His character and qualifications were beyond
question:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>His moral character is unblemished, his temper mild,
and his patience inexhaustible, as he has proved during his
African expedition. He is sufficiently versed in astronomy to
make and to calculate observations to determine both latitude and
longitude; he knows geography enough to construct a map of the
countries he may visit; draws a little; has a competent knowledge
of botany and zoology; and has been educated in the medical
line.<br>
<br>
He is very moderate in his terms; he will be contented with 10s.
a day and his rations, and happy if his pay is settled at 12s.
The amount of his outfit for instruments, arms, presents,
&amp;c., will not, I think, exceed &#163;100, He will want a
decked vessel of about thirty tons, under the command of a
lieutenant, with orders to follow his advice in all matters of
exploring. Such a vessel may easily be built in the colony, if
the one already there, which is found to have very bad qualities
as a sea boat, cannot be made sufficiently trustworthy; and
Lieutenant Flinders, a countryman of mine, a man of activity and
information, who is already there, will, I am sure, be happy if
he is entrusted with the command, and will enter into the spirit
of his orders, and agree perfectly with Park.<br>
<br>
The crew of such a vessel need not, in my opinion, consist of
more than ten men&#8212;four for boat-keepers and six to proceed
in the country with one or both the commanders, as may happen,
when the land journies are to be attempted.</blockquote>
<p>In the event of this project being carried into execution. Sir
Joseph expressed his readiness to draw up instructions for the
parties and to correspond with them during the execution of their
plans, under the superintendence of the Treasury&#8212;"such
hopes have I of material discoveries being made, and such zeal do
I feel for the prospects of a colony in the founding of which I
bore a considerable share."</p>
<p>This proposal, however, does not seem to have met with any
acceptance at the hands of the Government, who were probably too
much occupied with the war in which they were then engaged with
France to think of fitting out exploring expeditions to New South
Wales. Had the suggestion been adopted, it may well be supposed
that, although Mungo Park's idea of exploring the interior by
sailing up large navigable rivers might not have been realised,
he and Flinders together could hardly have failed to anticipate
some of the discoveries made in later years. But the plan was
more feasible on paper than it would have been found in practice.
In that respect it resembles a proposal made by Flinders to Sir
Joseph Banks, in a letter written from Wilhelm's Plains in the
Isle of France, March 20th, 1806:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Should a peace speedily arrive, and their lordships
of the Admiralty wish to have the N.W. coast of Australia
examined immediately, I will be ready to embark on any ship
provided for the service that they may chuse to send out. My
misfortunes have not abated my ardour in the service of science.
. . .<br>
With five or six asses to carry provisions (and they can be
procured here), expeditions might be made into the interior of
Australia from the head of the Gulph of Carpentaria in 18&#176;,
and from the head of the Great Gulph on the south coast in
32&#176;, until the courses should nearly meet: five hundred
miles each way would most probably be sufficient, since the
country does not appear to be mountainous; a view of my general
chart will exemplify this. In case of being again sent to
Australia, I should much wish that this was a part of my
instructions.</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it was a fortunate thing for Flinders that his the
project for exploring the interior "with five or six asses to
carry provisions" was not adopted, or the world might have lost
his subsequent contributions to geographical science. But
although the idea of exploring Australia in that fashion may
provoke a smile, a somewhat similar one was not unsuccessful in
later years. When Captain Grey set out from Hanover Bay in 1837
on his exploring tour in the north-west, he took with him
twenty-six ponies, for which he had sent to Timor. Although they
were "very small and perfectly wild", they proved useful, if they
did not exactly answer the purpose. <a href="#note-101" name=
"noteref-101" id="noteref-101">{5}</a></p>
<p>Sir Joseph was never tired of expressing his conviction as to
the great future which lay before the colony; nor was his
confidence in it ever shaken, even in the darkest hours of its
early years. Among the many expressions of his opinion on the
subject to be found in his correspondence, the following passages
in letters to Governor Hunter, written in 1797 and 1799, deserve
attention:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The climate and soil are, in my own opinion, superior
to most which have yet been settled by Europeans. I have always
maintained that assertion, grounded on my own experience, but
have been uniformly contradicted, except by Governor Phillip,
till your last favors have taken away all doubts from the minds
of those who have been permitted to peruse them.<br>
<br>
Your colony is already a most valuable appendage to Great
Britain, and I flatter myself we shall, before long, see her
Ministers made sensible of its real value. Rest assured in the
meantime that no opportunity will be lost by me of impressing
them with just ideas of the probable importance to which it is
likely before long to attain, and to urge them to pay it that
degree of attention which it clearly deserves at their
hands.</blockquote>
<p>He was writing in a time of gloom and disaster in Europe, and
naturally turned his eyes to the star rising in the southern
sky:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I see the future prospect of empire and dominion
which now cannot be disappointed. Who knows but England may
revive in New South Wales when it has sunk in
Europe?</blockquote>

The gradual development of the art of exploration is an
interesting feature in its history. For means of carriage our
first explorers, when they left the rivers, had to depend on
their own backs; then came the pack-horse, the bullock-team, the
dray and cart, with boats for river work, and lastly camels.
Oxley, in 1817, travelled with boats and bullock-teams; Sturt, in
1828, relied on bullock-teams and pack-horses; Mitchell started
on his expedition of 1835 with two boats carried on a
boat-carriage, seven carts drawn by bullocks, and seven
pack-horses; Eyre set out in 1840 with drays and pack-horses;
Leichhardt, in 1844, travelled with eight bullocks carrying
pack-saddles; in 1847 he took with him one hundred and eighty
sheep, two hundred and seventy goats, forty bullocks, fifteen
horses, and thirteen mules; while Burke and Wills, in 1860,
travelled in unprecedented pomp with twenty-seven camels, led by
sepoys, with waggons and pack-horses bringing up the rear.</p>

<h3>1.11 AUSTRALIA A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
<small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>WHO</small> it was that originally applied the name
Australia to the land once known to geographers, incorrectly, as
Terra Australis, and afterwards as New Holland, has been a
standing subject of discussion for many years. When Phillip was
sent out on his colonising expedition, the word Australia was
certainly not in common use. The whole of the territory included
within the limits of his Commission was known as New South Wales;
the rest of the continent still retaining the title given by the
Dutchmen to that portion of it which they claimed by virtue of
discovery. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102" id=
"noteref-102">{1}</a> It was not till many years afterwards that
these names gave place to that of Australia as the designation of
the whole continent. Flinders has been generally credited with
the selection, or at least with the first public application of
the word, in his Voyage to Terra Australis, published in 1814, in
which he wrote:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the
original term. Terra Australis, it would have been to convert it
into Australia, as being more agreeable to the ear and an
assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the
earth.</blockquote>
<p>The collection of charts published with the narrative of his
voyage contains a preliminary one entitled&#8212;"General Chart
of Terra Australis, or Australia." This chart having necessarily
come into the hands of navigators and geographers, it may be
supposed that the name applied to the country by Flinders was
gradually adopted by them in the first instance, and so met with
general acceptation. The change of name suggested by him seems to
have been effected during the ten years which succeeded the
publication of his work. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"
id="noteref-103">{2}</a> But it would not be correct to say that
he was the first geographer to make use of the word. He had seen
it in Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages in the South Pacific
<a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104" id=
"noteref-104">{3}</a>&#8212;a work which, comprising, as it did,
all the geographical knowledge on the subject at that time, was
certainly well known to Flinders. The author was a great
authority on geography during the period in which he
wrote&#8212;a fact sufficiently shown by his appointment as
hydrographer to the Admiralty. In the introduction to his
Collection of Voyages, alluding to the different divisions of his
work adopted by de Brosses in his <i>Histoire des Navigations aux
Terres Australes</i>, Dalrymple said:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have inserted another head of partition,
<small>AUSTRALIA</small>, comprehending the discoveries at a
distance from America to the eastward.</blockquote>
<p>Under this title he classified "all the lands and islands to
the eastward of South America." The idea was probably suggested
by the name Austral-Asia, applied by de Brosses' to the
discoveries in the South Pacific, exclusive of those to which he
had given the names Magellanica and Polynesia. <a href=
"#note-105" name="noteref-105" id="noteref-105">{4}</a> As de
Brosses may be fairly credited with the authorship of the term
Australasia, there seems equal reason for attributing to
Dalrymple the definite application of the name Australia to this
country, although he gave a much more extended meaning to it in
his work than we do now. The <i>Histoire</i> was published in
1756, fourteen years before Dalrymple's work appeared;
consequently the two publications were in the hands of every
French and English geographer of the time. That Flinders was well
acquainted with the writings of the English geographer is evident
from his work; he quotes in his introduction, for instance, a
paper translated by Dalrymple, of which he says that it
"furnishes more regular and authentic accounts of the early Dutch
discoveries in the East than anything with which the public was
before acquainted." The paper referred to was "a copy of the
instructions to Commodore Abel Jansz Tasman for his second voyage
of discovery", which had been procured from the Dutch explorers,
authorities by Sir Joseph Banks.</p>
<p>Although Flinders expressed his appreciation of the name which
soon afterwards became an established title in geography, it is
singular that he should have rejected it in favour of the old
term Terra Australis. That he did so, 1787 and after mature
consideration of the matter, is clear from his own
words:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It is necessary to geographical precision that so
soon as New Holland and New South Wales were known to form one
land, there should be a general name applicable to the whole; and
this essential point having been established in the present
voyage with a degree of certainty sufficient to authorise the
measure, I have, with the concurrence of opinions entitled to
deference, ventured upon the re-adoption of the original Terra
Australis; and of this term I shall hereafter make use when
speaking of New Holland and New South Wales in a collective
sense; and when using it in the most extended signification, the
adjacent isles, including that of Van Diemen's Land, must be
understood to be comprehended.</blockquote>
<p>This attempt to revive Terra Australis as the designation of
the continent was not destined to succeed; on the contrary, the
name seems to have wholly disappeared at the very time when it
was expected to become popular again. It might be supposed that a
practical seaman like Flinders would have been the last to adopt
a suggestion which could only find favour among the pedantic
geographers of his day, whose attention was concentrated on the
mere history of discovery in the South Sea. Historical continuity
was no doubt in favour of the old classical phrase; but as soon
as the navigation of the Pacific became a mercantile speculation
rather than a voyage of discovery, the question of terminology
had to be settled by shipowners and their captains, whose
necessities would require a more appropriate name than either
Terra Australis or New Holland. The admirable charts constructed
by Flinders of course superseded the old ones, from which
geographers and navigators alike had previously derived their
information respecting the Great South Land. Each of his charts
was entitled&#8212; "Chart of Terra Australis", excepting the
preliminary one, which, as already mentioned, was
termed&#8212;"General Chart of Terra Australis, or Australia."
The Narrative of his Voyage, too, was described on the title-page
of his work as a Voyage to Terra Australis. Thus he made it clear
that, notwithstanding his personal preference for Australia, he
had finally settled in his own mind the name which the country
was to bear in future times.</p>
<p>It may be said, no doubt, that if Flinders was not the first
to apply the term Australia to this continent, neither was
Dalrymple; seeing he found the original form of the
word&#8212;<i>Austrialia</i>&#8212;in a memorial presented by de
Quiros to the King of Spain, which appeared in a work well-known
to geographers&#8212;Purchas, His Pilgrimes, published in 1625.
The word Australia is substituted for Austrialia in a note
appended to this memorial, entitled&#8212;"a note of <i>Australia
del Espiritu Santo</i>, written by Master Hakluyt." <a href=
"#note-106" name="noteref-106" id="noteref-106">{5}</a> The
memorial was also translated and published by Dalrymple in his
Collection of Voyages, and consequently he had the indirect
authority of de Quiros for applying the name of Australia to all
the lands and islands to the eastward of South America. The land
discovered by the Portuguese navigator was named by him <i>la
Austrialia del Espiritu Santo</i>, <a href="#note-107" name=
"noteref-107" id="noteref-107">{6}</a> which Dalrymple translated
"The Australia del Espiritu Santo"&#8212;a curious compound of
English and Spanish. The literal rendering of the title would
be&#8212; "The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit"; and in
substituting "The Australia" for "The Southern Land", Dalrymple
was apparently exercising his own judgment in the selection of an
appropriate name. But de Quiros, again, was not in any sense the
originator of the name in question; he did nothing more than
translate the old Latin term into Spanish, just as the French
geographers rendered it into their language in the shape of <i>La
Terre Australe</i>. One of the earliest records in which that
title can be found is an old French map&#8212;"<i>faicte &#224;
Argues</i> par Pierre Descelliers, pbre: (pr&#233;sbytere) Jan:
1550"&#8212;in which a conjectural outline of the Great South
Land is named <i>La Terre Australle</i>. <a href="#note-108"
name="noteref-108" id="noteref-108">{7}</a> The derivation of
Australia from the old Latin, French, and Spanish names is so
obvious that it would be useless to discuss the question of its
authorship. The most rational supposition is that it came into
vogue in much the same manner as the word America derived its
existence from Amerigo&#8212;by a species of spontaneous
generation. The distinction of authorship cannot be claimed
either for Flinders, Dalrymple, de Quiros, or any other
geographer in whose writings it may have appeared; but
undoubtedly the publication in 1814 of the chart in which
Flinders distinctly gave this name to the continent, may be said
to have been mainly instrumental in fixing its place finally in
our geography. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109" id=

<b>New Holland</b></p>
<br>
<p>As there is no reason for supposing that the name Australia
came into general use before 1820, it is clear that in Phillip's
days it was to all intents and purposes unknown. New South Wales
for the territory he was sent to govern, and New Holland for the
rest of the continent, were the only names with which he could
have been acquainted. Even if we suppose that he had met with the
word Australia in Dalrymple's pages, he could not officially
recognise any other names than those which he found on the charts
which had been placed in his hands. Practically there was but one
chart&#8212;that which had been constructed by Captain Cook while
exploring the eastern coast from Point Hicks to Cape York. The
rest of the continent was known only through the imperfect charts
which had been made up from the voyages of the Dutch navigators
and Dampier. How imperfect those charts were may be seen at a
glance by comparing the map of New Holland, published by
Stockdale in 1787, <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110" id=
"noteref-110">{9}</a> with a map of Australia at the present
time. The straits which separated the coast-line of New Holland
from that of Van Diemen's Land had not been discovered, and the
latter was consequently regarded as forming part of the mainland.
Phillip's jurisdiction was supposed to stretch in an unbroken
line from the South Cape to Cape York; and even the configuration
of the southern coast, including that of Van Diemen's Land, was a
matter of conjecture.</p>

"The original name, used by the Dutch themselves until some time
after Tasman's second voyage in 1644, was Terra Australis or
Great South Land; and when it was displaced by New Holland, the
new term was applied only to the parts lying westward of a
meridian line passing through Arnheim's Land on the north, and
near the Isles of St. Francis and St. Peter on the south; all to
the eastward, including the shores of the Gulph of Carpentaria,
still remained as Terra Australis."&#8212;Flinders, Introduction,

In the first edition of his Description of the Colony, published
in 1819, Wentworth referred to it simply as situated on the east
coast of New Holland; but in the third edition, published in
1824, he added, that "the most eminent modern geographers have
given to it the very appropriate name of Australia." The change
of name would seem to have taken place between those dates.
O'Hara's History of New South Wales, the first edition of which
appeared in 1817, and the second in 1818, made no mention of
Australia in either, using the old name only. As it may be
assumed that neither O'Hara nor Wentworth would have overlooked a
point of so much interest as the adoption of a new name for the
territory, had it occurred previously to the time when they
compiled their works, the change may be said to date from about
1820. See note, p. 92.</p>

An Historical Collection of the several Voyages and Discoveries
in the South Pacific Ocean, by Alexander Dalrymple, Esq., London,
1770. In his work on the Early Voyages to Terra Australis, now
called Australia, published by the Hakluyt Society in 1859, the
author, R. H. Major, speaks of Dalrymple as one "to whom, perhaps
next to Hakluyt, this country is the most largely indebted for
its commercial prosperity." According to the introduction to
Cook's Third Voyage, it was owing to "the great sagacity and
extensive reading of Mr. Dalrymple" that Torres' track through
the straits named after him was brought to light, the geographer
having pointed it out in his Chart of Discoveries in the South
Pacific Ocean before 1764. Dalrymple was born in 1737 and died in
1808. Among his numerous productions was an anonymous pamphlet,
published in 1786, in which he attacked the proposal to found a
colony at Botany Bay; post, p. 468.</p>

Captain Sturt, alluding in the preface to his Two Expeditions,
1833, to the change of name from New Holland to Australia which
had taken place "of late years", said:&#8212;"The change was, I
believe, introduced by the celebrated French geographer, Malte
Brun, who, in his division of the globe, gave the appellation of
Austral-asia and Polynesia to the new discovered lands in the
Southern Ocean." So far from introducing the name in question,
Malte Brun endeavoured to suppress it in favour of his own
invention&#8212;Oceanica:&#8212;"The fifth part of the world will
be called Oceanica, and its inhabitants Oceanians; names which
will supersede the unmeaning or inaccurate designations of
Australasia, Notasia, Austral India, and Australia." Nor was it
Malte Brun, but de Brosses, who introduced the names of
Australasia and Polynesia. The first volume of the <i>Geographie
Universelle</i> appeared in 1810.</p>

He is supposed to have given this name for two reasons; first,
because Philip the Third, King of Spain, was head of the House of
Austria; and secondly, because possession of the country had been
taken on the King's birthday, the festival of the Holy Spirit.
<i>Austrialia</i> was therefore a distinctly different word from
Australia. The eastern coast of New Holland, previous to the time
of Cook's discoveries, was known on the maps by the name given by
de Quiros. In the <i>Carte G&#233;n&#233;rale</i>, published in
1756 by de Brosses with his <i>Histoire des Navigations</i>, the
eastern coast is marked <i>Terre du St. Esprit</i>, and a point
on the coast is termed <i>Manicolo</i>, The New Hebrides had not
then been explored, and geographers had generally accepted de
Quiros' assertion that he had discovered the veritable <i>Terra
Australis</i>. Captain Cook, when sailing off Cape Tribulation,
in June, 1770, wrote:&#8212;"We were now near the latitude
assigned to the islands which were discovered by Quiros, and
which some geographers, for what reason I know not, have thought
fit to join to this land." For many years after Cook's time, de
Quiros was looked upon as the first discoverer of the country.
Wentworth, in his Account of the British Settlements in
Austral-asia, 1824, wrote:&#8212;"New Holland is said to have
been discovered by the Spanish captain, Don Pedro Fernando de
Quiros, in 1609"; although in the first edition of his work the
discovery was attributed to the Dutch in 1616. He had either not
read, or had forgotten, the summary of Australian discovery given
by Flinders in the introduction to his Voyage, p. viii, in which
the claim of de Quiros to the discovery in question takes its
proper place.</p>

The original map is in the British Museum, but fac-similes of it
were obtained for the Public Libraries of Sydney. Melbourne, and
Adelaide. In another map of the same period, attributed to John
Rotz, hydrographer, 1542, an outline of a large southern island
is named the <i>Londe of Java</i>. A curious resemblance between
some of the names marked op this map of <i>Jave la Grande</i> and
those given by Captain Cook to his discoveries, formed the
subject of some animated discussions among the geographers,
reviewed by Major in his Early Voyages to Terra Australis.<br>
<br>
Captain Burney also remarked the resemblance in his History of
the Discoveries in the South Sea, 1803, vol. i, p.
381:&#8212;"The coast here (of <i>Jave la Grande</i>) has nearly
the same direction with the corresponding part of New Holland,
but is continued far to the south; and by a very extraordinary
coincidence, immediately beyond the latitude of 30 degrees, the
country is named <i>Coste des herbaiges</i>, answering in climate
and in name to Botany Bay. The many instances of similitude to
the present charts, which are to be found in the general outline
of this land, it is not easy to imagine were produced solely by
chance."<br>
<br>
These maps formed the subject of an interesting Paper read by J.
H. Maiden, Esq., F.L.S., F.R.G.S., Curator of the Technological
Museum at Sydney, before the New South Wales branch of the Royal
Geographical Society of Australasia, on the 26th August, 1886;

"In a despatch to Lord Bathurst, of April 4th, 1817, Governor
Macquarie acknowledges the receipt of Captain Flinders' charts of
'Australia'. This is the first time that the name of Australia
appears to have been officially employed. The Governor underlines
the word. He states that it was in pursuance of his lordship's
despatch of April 18th, 1816, that the expedition for prosecuting
the discoveries recently made to the westward of the Blue
Mountains has been fitted out; and, in a private letter to Mr.
Secretary Goulburn, M.P., of December 21st, 1817, says, speaking
of the expedition which had sailed that very morning for the west
coast of Australia:&#8212;Lieutenant King expects to be absent
from Port Jackson between eight and nine months; and, I trust, in
that time, will be able to make very important additions to the
geographical knowledge already acquired of the continent of
<i>Australia</i>; which, I hope, will be the name given to this
country in future, instead of the very erroneous and misapplied
name hitherto given to it of New Holland, which, properly
speaking, only applies to part of this immense
continent."&#8212;Labilliere's Early History of Victoria, p.
184.<br>
<br>
The natives of Australia are referred to by de Brosses,
<i>Histoire</i>, p. 17, as <i>les Australiens</i>; but he does
not apply the name to the country. So also in a French work of
fiction&#8212;<i>Les Avantures de Jacques Sadeur</i>, published
in Geneva in 1676&#8212;the savages are described as <i>les
Australiens</i>, but the corresponding name is not applied to the
country; although in the English translation it is applied. This
work, which was published in 1693, appears to be the second
English publication in which the name Australia can be found. In
Callander's translation, from de Brosses, of "Gonneville's Voyage
to Australasia", the word "Australians" is used as equivalent to
<i>les Austraux</i>.<br>
<br>
In Bayle's Dictionary, the first edition of which appeared in
1710, the word "Australia" occurs three times in note [G], art.
Sadeur. "Lastly, the relations of voyages being very much in
vogue at that time, he compleated his works by his Australia, as
he calls it." The country was not called Australia in Sadeur, but
<i>la Terre Australe</i>. Bayle also speaks of "the Australians"
in note [D].<br>
<br>
It may be mentioned here that Captain Cook, under date 13 August,
1770, speaks of "the islands which were discovered by Quiros, and
called <i>Australia del Espiritu Santo</i>", The name Australia
was consequently not unknown to Cook.<br>
<br>
In the introduction to Cook's Third Voyage, published in 1784,
the writer asks, p. xiii,&#8212;"Who has not heard, or read, of
the boasted <i>Tierra Australia del Espiritu Santo</i> of
Quiros?"<br>
<br>
The following passage occurs in a work on the Zoology of New
Holland, published by Dr. George Shaw in 1794 (p. 2):&#8212;<br>
<br>
"The vast island or rather continent of Australia, Australasia,
or New Holland, which has so lately attracted the particular
attention of European navigators and naturalists, seems to abound
in scenes of peculiar wildness and sterility."<br>
<br>
The terms <small>GREATER AUSTRALIA</small> and <small>LESSER
AUSTRALIA</small> are employed in a chart of the Missionary Ship
Duff's voyage in 1796-7-8, to distinguish those countries of the
Pacific Ocean which lie southward of the tropics. The Voyage was
published in 1799.<br>
<br>
And in the "Chart of the islands discovered in the South Sea to
the year 1620", prefixed to vol. ii of Burney's History of the
Voyages and Discoveries in the South Sea (1806), the islands
discovered by de Quiros are marked "<small>AUSTRALIA</small>
<i>del Espiritu Santo</i>";&#8212;that name being used frequently
by the same author in his account of the voyage of de Quiros, pp.
299-320; see also Appendix No. II.</p>

<h3>1.12 PHILLIP AND HIS WORK. <small>[1788-1792]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THERE</small> are few materials of much interest in the
present day&#8212;if we except his letters and despatches from
Sydney Cove&#8212;for a biography of Arthur Phillip. The scanty
details of his career prior to the expedition of 1787 that have
come down to us represent him as a naval officer of merit, but
without many opportunities for distinction. <a href="#note-111"
name="noteref-111">{1}</a> He held the rank of a
post-captain in the Navy when appointed Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of the new colony. But although Lord Howe was
unable to see any special qualifications in Captain Phillip for
such a command, <a href="#note-111">
{1}</a> the event proved that the great admiral's
judgment was as much at fault in that instance as it was when he
expressed his doubts about the prospects of a settlement in New
South Wales. Phillip's career in the colony showed that he
possessed in full measure the qualifications required for the
position in which he was placed. Had it been otherwise, he could
not have shown the readiness of resource he did under the
unexampled difficulties by which he was surrounded from first to
last. But for his unwearied attention to every detail connected
with the despatch of the First Fleet, it is not probable that the
voyage would have met with the remarkable success which attended
it. We have only to contrast it with that of the Second Fleet in
1790 in order to see how easily the whole expedition might have
been wrecked&#8212;not by storm and tempest, but by mere neglect
of duty. Making every allowance for favourable winds and weather
while at sea, it must still be admitted that nothing but the
anxious precautions taken by Phillip in England and on his way
out could have enabled him to bring his ships into harbour, after
an eight-months' voyage through unknown seas, without having met
with disaster in any shape, either to the ships or the people on
hoard them. Surgeon White, the medical officer in charge of the
settlement, recorded his feelings as he saw the ships at anchor
in Botany Bay:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>To see all the ships safe in their destined port,
without ever having by any accident been one hour separated, and
all the people in as good health as could be expected or hoped
for, after so long a voyage, was a sight truly pleasing, and at
which every heart must rejoice. <a href="#note-112" name=
"noteref-112">{2}</a></blockquote>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Plate-1-6" id=
"Plate-1-6"></a><img alt="" src="1204171h-images/Plate-1-6.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Arthur Phillip</b></p>
<br>
<p>Another authority was equally emphatic:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Thus, after a passage of exactly thirty-six weeks
from Portsmouth, we happily effected our arduous undertaking,
with such a train of unexampled blessings as hardly ever attended
a fleet in a like predicament Of two hundred and twelve marines
we lost only one, and of seven hundred and seventy-five convicts
put on board in England but twenty-four perished in our route.
<a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>Judge-Advocate Collins, too, with judicial precision and
solemnity of statement, summed up the case in these
terms:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Thus, under the blessing of God, was happily
completed in eight months and one week a voyage which, before it
was undertaken, the mind hardly dared venture to contemplate, and
on which it was impossible to reflect without some apprehension
as to its termination. This fortunate completion of it, however,
afforded even to ourselves as much matter of surprise as of
general satisfaction; for in the above space of time we had
sailed 5,021 leagues, had touched at the American and African
continents, and had at last rested within a few days' sail of the
antipodes of our native country, without meeting with any
accident in a fleet of eleven sail, nine of which were
merchantmen that had never before sailed in that distant and
imperfectly explored ocean.<br>
<br>
And when it is considered that there was on board a large body of
convicts, many of whom were embarked in a very sickly state, we
might be deemed peculiarly fortunate that, of the whole number of
all descriptions of persons coming to form the new settlement,
only thirty-two had died since their leaving England, among whom
were to be included one or two deaths by accidents; although
previous to our departure it was generally conjectured that
before we should have been a month at sea, one of the transports
would have been converted into an hospital ship. But it
fortunately happened otherwise; and the spirits visible in every
eye were to be ascribed to the general joy and satisfaction which
immediately took place on finding ourselves arrived at that port
which had been so much and so long the theme of our
conversations.</blockquote>
<p>There was every reason, indeed, for rejoicing, when the
history of the Second Fleet is borne in mind. But the
Judge-Advocate did not show much acumen when he ascribed this
singular good fortune entirely to the refreshments at Rio de
Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope, and "the excellent quality of
the provisions" with which the ships were supplied by the
contractor in England. Provisions alone would not have brought
the fleet into Port Jackson with so much cause for
congratulation. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114">{4}</a> It was owing to the provident care and
foresight of its chief that the expedition met with unexpected
good fortune at every stage; just as the success achieved by
Captain Cook in his voyages was due rather to his own skill and
good management than to the mere equipment of his vessels.
<a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115">{5}</a></p>
<p>We have only to trace the history of Phillip's administration
in order to see the same characteristics attended generally by
similar results. From his landing at Botany Bay to his departure
from the colony, he displayed all the energy, decision, and good
sense which the manifold difficulties of his position seemed to
require. The sound judgment shown in his selection of a site for
the new settlement relieved it at once from the imminent risk of
failure which would have hung over it, had he blindly followed
his instructions and pitched his tents on the shores of Botany
Bay. No spot on the coast of New South Wales was better adapted
for the purpose than Sydney Cove <a href="#note-116" name=
"noteref-116">{6}</a> when Phillip first saw it;
it remains to this day, and will always remain, the central point
of Australian settlement. How much the fate of other colonies has
been affected by well or ill-chosen sites for their capital
cities, there is evidence enough in their history to show.
<a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117">{7}</a>
The selection of Sydney Cove seemed natural and easy enough, no
doubt, after it had once been made; but the judgment shown in
picking it out at a first glance might be compared with that of a
victorious general in time of war, who takes up his position on
the field and wins his battle. It is in acts of this description
that the leaders of men show their capability for command; and
undoubtedly Phillip gave good proof of his capacity in this
instance.</p>
<p>But no sooner had Phillip overcome the preliminary obstacles
in his way than he was called upon to encounter the still greater
difficulties which beset his path from day to day. He stood in a
wilderness, of which he knew nothing, but which he was called
upon to subdue with the aid of the most unpromising materials
that could have been placed in his hands. He had to lay the
foundation of a colony which, as he felt, would in the future
prove to be the foundation of an empire; <a href="#note-118"
name="noteref-118">{8}</a> to establish the
machinery of a civil government; to provide for the
administration of justice; to explore the territory inland and
along the coast; to discover and develop its native resources; to
secure friendly relations with the aboriginals by whom he was
surrounded; and to govern, a community largely composed of the
worst elements of society. Such wore his functions as Governor of
the territory; but he had a still harder task to perform. He had
to face the results of the cruel negligence which left the
settlement without any regular supply of provisions for long
intervals of time, during which the people under his charge were
threatened with a lingering death. That was by far the most
trying as well as the most important of his many duties; but it
was done, and neither in that nor in any other instance did he
seek any credit for his work.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to claim anything like genius for Phillip,
for there is nothing to indicate that he possessed Letters and
any of the higher forms of intellectual power. His letters and
despatches show him to have been a man of ordinary education, and
without any pretension to scientific or literary attainments. But
every line he has written is full of interest for us at the
present day; although the reader must be prepared to make large
allowances in the matter of grammar and spelling, while there is
not even a suspicion of style about his compositions. Perhaps
they are all the more interesting on that account, because there
is evidently nothing artificial or theatrical about them. There
is no diplomacy in his language; he says exactly what he thinks,
and says it in the very words he might have used in conversation.
The result is that his despatches have all the force of an
original narrative, and the story he tells is as well told as we
need wish it to be. If we compare his writings with the polished
editions of them published in such works as Phillip's Voyage and
other compilations of the same kind, we feel at once how much
they have lost in point of liveliness and truth to nature. The
story, for instance, told by himself of his interviews with the
natives at Broken Bay, is quite a different piece of work from
the same story re-written with editorial point and precision of
language. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119">{9}</a></p>
<p>A naval officer who had been at sea from the age of sixteen
could hardly be expected to distinguish himself outside the
ordinary work of his profession. Although it is correct to say
that Phillip "raised himself by his merit and his services to
distinction and command". he cannot be well classed with Drake,
Dampier, or Cook, seeing that he never had the opportunities for
acquiring such distinction as fell to their lot. They were men
who achieved renown by exploits which have made their names
historical, but Phillip's performances were of a much less
ambitious type. Yet, placed in the position in which he found
himself, it is difficult to see how he could have done more than
he did. He accomplished his task successfully, so far as success
was attainable with the limited means at his command. Although he
was not embarrassed with the bitter local questions which so
often disturbed his successors' peace of mind, he had problems to
solve which tried his temper and taxed his resources; and the
fact that he succeeded in solving them one after another must be
placed to his credit in estimating his character as a ruler. "The
policy of the Government", in his day, consisted mainly in
finding something to eat. At the distance of a hundred years, it
is not easy to realise the situation in which he was so often
placed when, by the non-arrival of expected supplies from
England, the little settlement at Sydney Cove was absolutely in
danger of starvation. Infant colonies had been left to perish
from want of food in other parts of the world, <a href=
"#note-120" name="noteref-120" id="noteref-120">{10}</a> and on
more than one occasion it seemed probable enough that Phillip's
efforts to found a colony would have met with the same fate. Had
he been improvident or neglectful in his administration,
disastrous consequences might have happened; but by the prudent
handling of his resources from day to day, he contrived to avert
each impending calamity, and the colony prospered.</p>
<p>There is some satisfaction in relieving his memory from a
charge which has been unjustly laid to it. He has been held
responsible for the extreme severity with which criminal offences
of all kinds were punished during his term of office, as if it
rested with him to prescribe the sentence in every case as well
as to sanction its execution. It has been freely insinuated, too,
that he must be held responsible for the severity which continued
to mark the administration of the criminal law in this colony
long after he had disappeared from the scene; as if his
successors had merely continued a system which he had
established. One writer says of him:&#8212;"His punishments were
not frequent, but prompt and terrible." <a href="#note-121" name=
"noteref-121" id="noteref-121">{11}</a> The punishments inflicted
on criminals during his time were certainly prompt and terrible,
but they were not his; they were inflicted by the Criminal Court,
composed of six officers and the Judge-Advocate. That Court was
practically a Court-martial; and although it was supposed to
administer justice "according to the laws of England", it did so
after a strictly military fashion. When we read, for instance,
that "Joseph Hunt, a soldier in the detachment, having been found
absent from his post when stationed as a centinel, was tried by a
Court-martial and sentenced to receive seven hundred lashes",
<a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122" id="noteref-122">{12}</a>
we have a key to the whole system which prevailed in Phillip's
time. But personally he had nothing more to do with it, so far as
the infliction of punishment was concerned, than the Governor of
the present day has to do with the sentences passed on prisoners
in the Criminal Courts. The frequent occurrence of such "prompt
and terrible punishments" in the first years of the settlement
has naturally, perhaps, created an impression that they were the
work of a cruel temper inflamed by the consciousness of arbitrary
power. So far, however, from that being the case, there is no
difficulty in showing that Phillip's disposition was not by any
means a cruel one. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123" id=
"noteref-123">{13}</a> Many instances might be given of his
leniency. When, for instance, he was attacked and wounded by a
native with a spear he made no attempt to retaliate; but as soon
as he had recovered from the wound, he visited the natives in
order to show them that "no animosity was retained on account of
the late accident, nor resentment harboured against any but the
actual perpetrator of the act." <a href="#note-124" name=
"noteref-124" id="noteref-124">{14}</a> His power to pardon,
reprieve, and remit sentences was freely exercised. Of six
convicts sentenced to death at the second sitting of the Criminal
Court one was pardoned and four reprieved, the latter being
"afterwards exiled to a small island within the bay, where they
were kept on bread and water." A King's birthday was always
accompanied with a release of prisoners. <a href="#note-125"
name="noteref-125" id="noteref-125">{15}</a></p>
<p>His own opinion was that hanging is not the most effective
punishment, simply because it does not deter men of criminal
tendencies from committing crime. In the "memo." in which he
jotted down his ideas about the government of the projected
colony, he anticipated the question of capital punishment as
applied to the convicts, expressing himself strongly against it:
"Death, I think, will never be necessary". There were only two
crimes which would merit death, in his opinion; and for either of
them he would substitute exile to some "cruel island in the
far-off sea", as a far more potent deterrent than the hangman's
rope, check. Whether he was altogether serious in his proposal to
confine the criminal in such cases "till an opportunity offered
of delivering him as a prisoner to the natives of New Zealand and
let them eat him", may be doubted; at any rate he did not ask for
legislative powers to that effect. <a href="#note-126" name=
"noteref-126" id="noteref-126">{16}</a> Perhaps it was intended
as a jocular suggestion from the quarter-deck, as the best-known
method of instilling fear into the minds of hardened offenders.
Among sailors of the old school, no punishment was more dreaded
than that of being left ashore in an unknown country, with the
prospect of being either eaten by savages or condemned to lead a
savage life among them. <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"
id="noteref-127">{17}</a> Had the matter rested entirely in
Phillip's discretion, he would have substituted exile for death
in extreme cases, not for the purpose of condemning the criminal
to be devoured by cannibals, but in order that he might endure
the prolonged suffering inseparable from isolation, and at the
same time do some service to the State by forming connections
among the natives, with the view of Diplomatic reconciling them
to the presence of Europeans in their country. The five men whom
he reprieved in the first month of his administration he had
determined to exile to that part of the territory then known as
the South Cape, <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128" id=
"noteref-128">{18}</a> but that intention was never carried out,
probably because, having no means of sending them there, he sent
them to Norfolk Island instead; or perhaps to the "small rocky
island near the entrance of the cove" officially called Rock
Island, but known among the convicts as Pinchgut&#8212;from the
bread and water which formed their rations when sent there.
Speaking in his memo, of the relations which might arise between
the convicts and the native women, he said:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I should think it necessary to punish with severity
the man who used the women ill; and I know of no punishment
likely to answer the purpose of deterring others so well as
exiling them to a distant spot, or to an island.</blockquote>
<p>That was clearly his idea of a really effective punishment.
But it was no part of his functions as a Governor to prescribe
pains and penalties for offences within the jurisdiction of the
Criminal Court. That was a matter in which he could not
interfere, otherwise than by exorcising the prerogative of mercy.
Nor is there much reason to believe that Phillip had any more
faith in the lash as a means of correction than he had in the
gallows. His experience in the navy must have made him only too
familiar with the custom of flogging, seamen in his days being
ruthlessly flogged for petty broaches of naval discipline. The
same practice prevailed in the army. Under any circumstances it
was, perhaps, inevitable that a Court composed of military and
naval men should use the lash as a convenient means of
punishment. Any other form of correction for minor offences was
hardly known to men of that time. There was no gaol or place of
detention for prisoners in the colony; imprisonment, moreover,
meant loss of labour; and even if the letter of the law had left
the members of the Court to the exercise of their own discretion
in the choice of penalties the lash would necessarily, under such
circumstances, have taken the place of imprisonment. <a href=
"#note-129" name="noteref-129" id="noteref-129">{19}</a></p>
<p>Nor the least noticeable feature in Phillip's character is the
spirit of self-denial manifested by him throughout the trying
times in which he ruled. Most, if not all, of those around him
were loud in their complaints against the country; but he appears
to have been so confident in its future that the privations he
had to undergo made little impression on him. Chief in the ranks
of the discontented stood Major Ross, commanding officer of the
marines and Lieutenant-Governor of the colony. It was apparently
his ambition from the first to find every possible occasion for
embarrassing Phillip in the discharge of his duties. Perhaps the
Major's outbreaks may be accounted for in some measure by his
personal grievances, which were set out at length in a letter to
Nepean, written from Sydney Cove in July, 1788. <a href=
"#note-130" name="noteref-130" id="noteref-130">{20}</a> It
presents a curious contrast, in tone and temper, with the letters
written by Phillip; for while the Major's abounds in petty
complaints, the Governor's are absolutely silent with respect to
everything in the shape of personal inconvenience. Yet it is
certain that he had to bear his full share of the cruel
privations which were endured by everyone in the settlement at
that time; and whether he bore them patiently or not, there is
nothing to show that he ever uttered a murmur on his own account.
Whatever complaint he had to make was directed to the remedy of
some public grievance&#8212;certainly not to any grievance of his
own. If he was silent on the subject of his own troubles, he was
equally reserved with respect to the sacrifices he felt called
upon to make in the public interest. Had it not been recorded by
Collins, nothing would have been known in the present day of the
self-denial he displayed when, at a time of scarcity fast
approaching to famine, he surrendered his own small supplies to
the public stock:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The Governor, from a motive that did him immortal
honour, gave up three hundred-weight of flour, which was his
excellency's private property, declaring that he wished not to
see anything more at his table than the ration which was received
in common from the public store, without any distinction of
persons; and to this resolution he rigidly adhered, wishing that
if a convict complained, he might see that want was not unfelt
even at Government House. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"
id="noteref-131">{21}</a></blockquote>
<p>While this was the spirit in which Phillip met the privations
he had to encounter, the Lieutenant-Governor found time to write
a letter of complaint to England, in which the Governor was
represented as offensively arbitrary and inconsiderate,
subjecting the officers of the garrison to unnecessary hardships
and indignities, apparently for no other purpose than that of
swelling his own importance at their expense:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I believe there never was a set of people so much
upon the parrish as this garrison is; and what little we want,
even to a single nail, we must not send to the Commissary for it,
but must apply to his excellency; and when we do, he allways
sayes&#8212;"there is but little come out",&#8212;and of course
it is but little we get, and what we are obliged to take as a
mark of favor.</blockquote>
<p>There were other officers attached to the establishment who
had complaints to make on their own account. One of them, for
instance, wrote a letter to Sir Joseph Banks in November, 1788,
in which he complained of the hardship he had undergone in having
to cut thatch and wattles for his own hut, and concluded by
assuring his friend that although he might have "a flattering
public account" he need not rely upon it; adding that "every
gentleman here, two or three excepted, concurs with me in
opinion, and sincerely wish that the expedition may be recalled."
Surgeon White, whose Journal is scrupulously free from any
remarks calculated to prejudice the colony in the eyes of the
British public, described it in a subsequent letter to Sir Joseph
Banks as "a country and place so forbidden and so hateful as only
to merit execration and curses." <a href="#note-132" name=
"noteref-132">{22}</a> He was not the only one
who held that opinion; Major Ross, in a letter to Nepean, said he
did not "scruple to pronounce that in the whole world there is
not a worse country than what we have yet seen of this." <a href=
"#note-132">{22}</a></p>
<p>Phillip seems to have stood almost alone in his disregard of
present privations and his confidence in the future of the
country. The grievances which appeared so unendurable to the men
who surrounded him, he spoke of as "the little difficultys we
have met with, which time and proper people for cultivating the
land will remove." The spirit in which he had settled down to his
work may be judged from the assurance he gave Lord Sydney while
in the midst of his troubles:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Anxious to render a very essential service to my
country by the establishment of a colony which, from its
situation, must hereafter be a valuable acquisition to Great
Britain, no perseverance will be wanting on my part, and which
consideration alone would make amends for the being surrounded by
the most infamous of mankind. Time will remove all difficulties.
As to myself, I am satisfied to remain as long as my services are
wanted; I am serving my country, and serving the cause of
humanity.</blockquote>

Sir Joseph Banks, in a letter dated August 16, 1791, addressed to
Mr. Richards, the contractor, said:&#8212;"It appears clear,
however, from the remarkable healthyness of the crews that went
out with Governor Phillip, and from the as remarkable
unhealthyness of some transports that have arrived since, that
the good sense and personal attention of the commanders to

the principal cause of the success with which they can be carried

Lieutenant-Governor Collins abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for
settlement in 1803, and removed his establishment to the banks of
the river Derwent in Tasmania. It is not probable that such a
mistake would have been made by Phillip. Nor would he have had
any difficulty in determining the question as to the best site
for a settlement on the South Australian coast. The first
settlers on that territory occupied Kangaroo Island, but Colonel
Light, the surveyor sent out by the Home Government in 1836,
removed the settlement to the plain on which Adelaide now stands.
When Governor Hindmarsh arrived some months afterwards he
condemned the site, and proposed to remove the settlement to
Encounter Bay. The contention on this point lasted for over a
year, and was not settled until the Home Government interfered by
recalling the Governor and sending out another, who confirmed the
action of the surveyor.</p>

None of his officers seemed to share his predictions as to the
future of the settlement. Tench wrote:&#8212;"Speculators who may
feel inclined to try their fortunes here will do well to weigh
what I have said. If golden dreams of commerce and wealth flatter
their imaginations, disappointment will follow; the remoteness of
situation, productions of the country, and want of connection
with other parts of the world, justify me in the
assertion."&#8212;Narrative, p. 138. Collins did not permit
himself to indulge in any dreams of a brilliant future. "As to
its utility, besides the circumstance of its freeing the mother
country from the depraved branches of her offspring, it may prove
a valuable nursery to our East India possessions for soldiers and
seamen."&#8212;Preface, p. ix. Hunter did not commit himself to
any expression of opinion, beyond saying that if the Government
should determine to persevere in establishing a settlement upon
an extensive plan, it would be attended with considerable expense
to the nation. It would be necessary to stock the country with
cattle, and to find people to look after the
cattle.&#8212;Journal, p. 202. He was so thoroughly practical
that, although he surveyed Port Jackson, he had not a word to say
for it as regards its attractions, his attention being apparently
absorbed by the natives whom he met along its shores. Surgeon
White records that when Phillip returned to Botany Bay from his
first visit to Port Jackson, he and his friends were "full of
praises on the extent and excellence of the harbour." And his own
impression is thus stated:&#8212;"Port Jackson I believe to be,
without exception, the finest harbour in the universe, and at the
same time the most secure." But he had nothing further to say in
commendation of the country; on the contrary, he wrote a very
depressing letter about it from Sydney Cove in April, 1790; post,
p. 506.</p>

have offered the same excuse for his literary deficiencies that
Captain Cook did, when, in concluding the introductory discourse
to his Second Voyage, he desired the reader "to excuse the
inaccuracies of style", and to recollect that "it is the
production of a man who has not had the advantage of much school
education, but who has been constantly at sea from his youth; and
though, with the assistance of a few good friends, he has passed
through all the stations belonging to a seaman, from an
apprentice boy in the coal trade to a Post-Captain in the Royal
Navy, he has had no opportunity of cultivating letters."</p>

Bennett, History of Australian Discovery and Colonisation, 1865,
p. 169. The punishments inflicted by Phillip for disobedience of
his General Orders were prompt, but not terrible. When, for
instance, a party of convicts set out with the intention of
avenging the death of a comrade, who had been killed by the
natives, Phillip sentenced them to receive one hundred and fifty
lashes each, and to wear a fetter for a twelve-month. Judged by
the standard of that day, the punishment was a mild one; for
there could not well have been a more aggravated case of
insubordination. As Collins expressed it (p. 58), the men in
question had "daringly and flagrantly broken through every order
which had been given to prevent their interfering with the
natives",&#8212;a matter of the highest importance in Phillip's
eyes.</p>

In Phillip's Voyage, p. 68, he is described as "intelligent,
active, persevering, with firmness to make his authority
respected, and mildness to render it pleasing." That was the
opinion expressed of him in England; and a similar estimate seems
to have been formed of his character by his critics in the
colony. Collins, for instance (p. 72), speaking of the capture of
Caesar&#8212;a notorious offender who had incurred the penalty of
death&#8212;says that "the Governor, with the humanity that was
always conspicuous in his exercise of the authority vested in
him, directed that he should be sent to Garden Island, there to
work in fetters; and in addition to his ration of provisions, he
was to be supplied with vegetables from the garden." And West, in
his History of Tasmania, vol. ii, p. 144, states that "the

Phillip's despatch, post, p. 274. According to White, Journal, p.
128, three men were convicted on the 27th February, 1788, of
"feloniously and fraudulently taking away from the public store
beef and pease, the property of the Crown"; but one only was
executed. They were all, "about 6 o'clock the same evening, taken
to the fatal tree", but two "were respited until 6 o'clock the
next evening. When that awful hour arrived, they were led to the
place of execution, and just as they were on the point of
ascending the ladder, the Judge-Advocate arrived with the
Governor's pardon, on condition of their being banished to some
uninhabited place. On the 29th, two men were convicted of
stealing wine, and sentenced to death; but one being "an ignorant
black youth was pardoned by the Governor, and the other, another
black, "had his sentence of death, while at the gallows, changed
to banishment." At a later period Norfolk Island was utilised for
this purpose. A soldier condemned to death in September, 1789,
for a rape on a child of eight years of age, having been
recommended to mercy, was pardoned "on condition of his residing,

<p><small>NOT</small> only had Phillip put on record his aversion
to extreme measures in dealing with offenders, but he also
indicated the course of action which he proposed to adopt for the
purpose of ensuring order and good conduct among the people under
his charge. In his despatches of the 9th July and 30th October,
1788, he speaks in feeling terms of "the little plan I had formed
in the passage for the government of these people", which he had
been obliged to give up on account of the stubborn disinclination
of Major Ross to "interfere with the convicts"&#8212;as he put
it. The little plan which had suggested itself to Phillip's mind
as a better means for maintaining order than the frequent use of
the lash, or even the gallows, was simply that the officers
should use their personal influence among the men for the purpose
of encouraging them in well-doing, whenever an opportunity might
offer. The request he made of them soon after landing was as
follows:&#8212;"That officers would, when they saw the convicts
diligent, say a few words of encouragement to them; and that when
they saw them idle, or met them straggling in the woods, they
would threaten them with punishment." There was not much in this,
as Phillip said, that "would degrade either the officer or the
gentleman"; but the officers, acting under the Major's
inspiration, did not look at it in that light. They were not
concerned in promoting order and good conduct among the convicts.
They were sent out on garrison duty; their official instructions
were comprised in "a letter sent from the Admiralty to the
Commanding Officers of Marines at Portsmouth and Plymouth"; they
would govern themselves by that letter, and not by any requests
they might receive from Governor Phillip. On these grounds they
absolutely declined to "interfere with the convicts" in any way,
even to the extent of giving an occasional word of encouragement
to the diligent, or a caution to the idle; although, at the same
time, they claimed a right to convict labour in the cultivation
of their gardens. So punctilious were they with respect to the
strict lines of their military duty, as they conceived it, that
they thought "the being obliged to sit as members of the Criminal
Court an hardship", because they were not paid for it. "They did
not suppose that they were sent out to do more than garrison
duty"; and they thought themselves "hardly dealt by in that
Government had not determined what lands were to be given them."
These demands were no doubt designed to bring pressure to bear
upon Phillip, in order that he might obtain from the Home
Government the concessions to which they considered themselves
entitled. They thought they ought to have their grants of land
immediately, as well as convict labour for its cultivation; and
also that they ought to be paid for their services in the
Criminal Court. Because he did not adopt their views on these
points, they had no hesitation in giving him plainly to
understand that they "declined the least interference with the
convicts, unless when they are immediately employed for their own
conveniency, or when they are called out at the head of their
men."</p>
<p>Phillip thus found himself, soon after his arrival in the
colony, in a position which every day threatened to bring him
into collision with the head of the military force; and the
attitude assumed by Major Ross was such as to leave very little
hope of satisfactory relations being ever established between
them. This was the beginning of the dissension between the civil
and the military authorities which continued through succeeding
administrations, and finally culminated in the deposition of
Governor Bligh. It owed its origin to the absence of any
instructions from the Home Government with respect to the exact
position of the military force in relation to the Governor. The
necessity for some such definition of duty did not present itself
to the Government when the expedition was being organised; nor
did it occur to Phillip, since there is no reference to it in his
letters. Probably both he and Lord Sydney took it for granted
that the Act of Parliament passed in 1787 rendered any special
instructions from the Admiralty unnecessary. But they might have
known that nothing, according to historical precedents, was more
likely to happen under such circumstances than dissension between
the two powers. The antagonism which grew up between Governor
Phillip and Major Ross was but a reproduction, on a very small
scale, of the violent struggles between the civil and military
authorities which formed the prelude to many of the great
revolutions recorded in history. That the difference between
himself and the Major was not carried to violent extremes must be
attributed to Phillip's tact, good temper, and self-control. He
had provocation enough, had he been irritable and vindictive, to
justify him in any steps he might have thought fit to take for
the purpose of asserting his authority as Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief. But he wisely refrained from taking any steps
of the kind, contenting himself with proper representations of
the matter to the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Major Ross was evidently disposed to act an aggressive part at
every opportunity. Not satisfied with thwarting Phillip's good
intentions with respect to the management of the convicts, he
endeavoured to place still more serious obstructions in his path.
He incited his officers to raise technical objections as to the
Governor's power to summon them to attend the sittings of the
Criminal Court. One <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133" id=
"noteref-133">{1}</a> of them having declined to sit, Phillip
appointed a Court of Inquiry to investigate the matter; but the
only conclusion the Court could come to was, that they did not
think themselves "competent to give an opinion on a private
dispute, which appeared to them to involve in itself a point of
law." He then proceeded to convene the Court in the usual way,
but was again met by further objections from Major Ross. How the
matter ended will be seen from Phillip's statement in his
despatch:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I had sent for several of the officers before the
Court met, in order to point out the consequences which would
follow their refusal of so essential a part of their duty; and
the officers I saw on that occasion assured me that they had
never doubted its being a part of their duty after they heard the
Act of Parliament and the Commission read which established that
Court; but Major Ross, on the 6th May, telling me that he was
still of opinion that many of his officers did not think the
sitting as members of the Criminal Court any part of their duty,
I desired that he would assemble the officers, that their
separate opinions might be taken on that head.</blockquote>
<p>The result was that all the officers who were assembled, to
the number of thirteen, gave it as their opinion that they were
bound to sit. Ross then turned upon Phillip and charged him with
being "oppressive" in his conduct, as if he had taken advantage
of the officers' good nature to convert into a duty what they had
merely volunteered to do as a matter of courtesy. But as Phillip
did not continue the discussion, it came to nothing, and Major
Ross was left to mature some other project for the purpose of
embarrassing the Governor. He was not long in doing so. In one of
Phillip's despatches written in February, 1790, he informed Lord
Sydney of another complication in which he had found himself
involved with the Major. In order to prevent the nightly
plundering of the gardens which supplied the settlement with
vegetables&#8212;at that time a matter of great importance, owing
to the small stock of provisions remaining in the public
store&#8212;the Governor had made an order directing the
night-watch, then composed of convicts, to detain any soldier or
seaman who might be found straggling or in the convicts' huts
"after the tap-too has beat", and to give information at the
nearest guard-house. A soldier having been detained under this
regulation, Major Ross immediately interfered.</p>
<blockquote>He sent the next morning to tell the Judge-Advocate
that he considered a soldier's being stopped when not committing
any unthreatened lawful act as an insult offered to the corps,
and that they would not suffer themselves to be treated in that
manner, or be controlled by the convicts, while they had bayonets
in their hands.</blockquote>
<p>When this intimation was reported to Phillip by the
Judge-Advocate, the allusion to the bayonets was cautiously
omitted, Collins probably thinking that it might be a little too
much for his temper. The order was thereupon modified, and by a
new one the night-watch was directed&#8212;"not, in future, to
stop any soldier unless he is found in a riot, or committing an
unlawful act, in which case such soldier is immediately to be
taken to the nearest guard."</p>
<p>Major Ross sought to justify his interference in this matter
on the ground that the order objected to had "put the soldiers
under the command of the convicts"; although he knew that
soldiers were in the habit of robbing the gardens, and could not
be checked by any other means. The withdrawal of the order
amounted to saying that they might continue to rob the gardens as
much as they pleased, since the night-watch would not be likely
to interfere with them after that. Phillip, as he expressed it,
found himself "driven to the necessity of withdrawing an order
calculated for the public service"; he had either to withdraw the
order or defy the Major of marines. He was no doubt considerably
galled when he was afterwards told about the "bayonets"; and he
felt it due to himself to explain his position when writing his
account of it to Sydney. He did so by adding the following
paragraph in a parenthesis:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Here I beg leave to observe to your lordship that the
last sentence, respecting the bayonets, was never mentioned to me
till this business was settled. I should not have been induced to
withdraw the order which directed the night-watch to stop a
soldier by so pointed a menace, for I should not have thought it
could tend to the good of his Majesty's service.</blockquote>
<p>But the Major now felt that he was even with Phillip. If he
had been obliged to give way on the Criminal Court question, he
had compelled the Governor to withdraw his obnoxious order. This
was the spirit in which the Lieutenant-Governor played fast and
loose with the public service. It was nothing to him whether or
not the soldiers under his command stole other people's
vegetables, in a time of famine, every night; the corps was not
to be insulted by placing them under the control of the police.
Nor did it matter much in his eyes whether or not the Criminal
Court was prevented from sitting, and offenders were allowed to
go free; it was an "oppressive duty" for an officer of marines to
take part in the administration of justice, unless he was paid
for it.</p>
<p>It was a very fortunate thing that the Major was not always
successful in checkmating the Governor. Had he succeeded on the
Criminal Court question, for instance, the administration of law
would have been brought to a dead stop, the Governor's authority
would have been set at defiance, and the convicts would have been
left to do as they pleased. The Major's tendency to carry things
to extremes was displayed but too clearly in this instance. Apart
from all sense of public duty, the terms of the Act were so clear
that no room for a reasonable doubt could have been left in the
mind of any officer who read it. Captain Tench and twelve other
officers admitted that they always thought it their duty, from
the moment that they heard the Act of Parliament read, to sit as
members of the Court. Nor is it likely that any officer would
have formed a different opinion, had he not been encouraged to do
so by the Commandant&#8212;who slyly told them that if they
objected to sit, he knew of "no Article of War to compel them."
There was no Article of War on the subject; nor were there any
instructions from the Admiralty, as there should have been; but
there was the Act of Parliament, which, in definite language and
with unmistakable intention, pointed out the duty it imposed on
every officer of his Majesty's forces by sea and land within the
colony.</p>
<p>Whether or not Major Ross entertained any doubt in his own
mind as to the duty imposed on the officers of the detachment by
the Act of Parliament, it is clear that in acting as he did on
this and other occasions he had quite forgotten the promise
voluntarily made by him in a letter to Nepean, written from
Portsmouth a few days before he sailed on the
expedition:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have now only to add that this is the first
instance in which the corps of marines has been employed in any
way out of the usual line of duty, and as I firmly believe that
any part of it being so employed is entirely owing to your
friendly wish of drawing the corps forth from that subordinate
obscurity in which it has hitherto moved,&#8212;impressed with
this belief, permit me to offer you my own as well as the
sincerest thanks of the officers of the detachment under my
command for the generous opinion you have shown in favour of the
corps, and to assure you that every nerve shall be strain'd in
the faithful and diligent discharge of our duty; and I entertain
not a doubt but that the conduct of the whole will be such as
will not only do credit to your recommendation, but give
satisfaction to Administration. These much-wished for objects
obtained, I shall then ardently hope that what you once hinted to
me might be the consequence will with your assistance take place,
and that we shall no more return to our original obscurity, but
become an active corps of your own creation.</blockquote>
<p>Major Ross's eccentric conduct in these instances seems to
have been the result of a peculiar temper rather than a studied
display of insubordination. If he could not avoid coming into
collision with the Governor, he was on no better terms with the
Judge-Advocate or his own officers. On one occasion he made a
formal complaint against Captain Collins, who, wrote Phillip, "in
his turn, represented his having been treated in such a manner by
the Lieutenant-Governor and Captain Campbell, before convicts and
others, that he wished to resign his office." <a href="#note-134"
name="noteref-134" id="noteref-134">{2}</a> The Major not only
quarrelled with the adjutant and quarter-master, but placed a
captain and four subalterns under arrest for no other reason than
that they, as members of a Court-martial assembled to try a
soldier for assault, had passed a sentence of such a nature as,
in his opinion, tended greatly to the subversion of all military
discipline. The idea of punishing the members of a Court-martial
because their sentence did not meet with his approval is
characteristic of the man. They were no more liable to punishment
for such a cause than judges or magistrates would have been under
similar circumstances. If any notice required to be taken of
their action at all, the proper remedy lay in an appeal to a
General Court-martial, in order to have the sentence revised. But
the Major evidently wanted something more than revision; he
wished to bring his officers to trial in order to have them
punished. In that matter he was disappointed, owing to a little
difficulty which unexpectedly presented itself at the last
moment. It was assumed that a General Court-martial required
thirteen members to compose it, and as there were only nineteen
officers in the detachment, of whom five were then under arrest,
and one was ill, it was not possible to get a General
Court-martial together. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"
id="noteref-135">{3}</a> The result was that nothing could be
done; the Major had to forego his revenge, and Phillip ordered
the five officers to return to duty, until a sufficient number of
officers to form a General Court-martial could be assembled.</p>
<p>This disturbance was no sooner disposed of than it seems to
have been followed by another, which gave rise to more technical
discussions on points of military law between the Governor and
the marines. Phillip apologised to Lord Sydney for troubling him
with the details of it in a despatch, but excused himself on the
ground that "the very unpleasant situation of the detachment
doing duty in this country, from the discontents between the
Commandant and the officers", rendered it necessary to do
so&#8212;especially as it was not in his power "to restore that
harmony which is so very requisite in our situation." He had
received a letter from Major Ross requesting him to assemble a
General Court-martial for the purpose of hearing a charge which
the Major had made against one of his officers "for neglect of
duty, contempt, and disrespect to him. The Governor issued his
warrant accordingly, but when the thirteen officers were
assembled, a question was raised as to the legality of the
proceedings. The warrant was issued under the authority of his
Majesty's Commission for assembling General Courts-martial; but
the marines "declared that they could not sit under that warrant,
being amenable only to the authority of the Commissioners for
executing the office of Lord High Admiral of Great Britain."
<a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136" id="noteref-136">{4}</a>
Phillip endeavoured to get over the difficulty by appointing a
Court of Inquiry to "inquire into the particulars of the charge,
and to report whether there was or was not sufficient ground for
a General Court-martial"; intending, if the report should require
any further proceeding, to have the charge fully examined and
reported on by another Court of Inquiry. But the officers to whom
the question was referred had no sooner met than technical
objections again made their appearance; and it was finally
resolved that, although the members of the Court might have
proceeded to hear the case before the application for a
Court-martial had been made, they were precluded from doing so by
the issue of the Governor's warrant. <a href="#note-137" name=
"noteref-137" id="noteref-137">{5}</a></p>
<p>In this dilemma Phillip directed the Judge-Advocate to take
the evidence on both sides, intending to send the depositions to
England with the officer under arrest. Before that could be done,
however. Major Ross came to the rescue with a letter in which he
informed Phillip that "the officer had fully satisfied him
respecting the charge", and desired that he might be "permitted
to withdraw his request for a Court-martial." The officer was
thereupon ordered to return to his duty, and there the matter
ended. It may well be supposed, however, that it did not end so
far as the principal figures in the little drama were concerned.
Phillip was not at all inclined to submit quietly either to
personal affronts, or to official acts evidently intended to make
him feel that the Governor-in-Chief was dependent on the military
for assistance in carrying on the government. Feeling that the
safety of the settlement was at stake in every stage of the
conflict, he refrained from taking any step which might have
borne the appearance of retaliation, and allowed Major Ross to
pursue his own course until the proper time arrived for checking
it. When it came, Phillip disposed of him not only without any
display of temper or resentment, but, on the contrary, with every
appearance of confidence in his discretion&#8212;by sending him
to Norfolk Island with a commission as Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

Captain James Campbell, an especial friend of the Major's. In a
letter to Evan Nepean, written shortly before his leaving
England, Ross implored the Under Secretary to obtain some
appointment tor his friend, suggesting that he might be made
Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court instead of himself (Ross): "If
the above cannot possibly be done for him, do, for God's sake,
endeavour at something else for him. An addition to his present
income is not, I am convinced, his principal object; what I
myself wish for him, and what I am sure his own only wish is,
some kind of appointment that would have him some little
consequence in himself as well as in the eyes of his brother
officers going with him, all of whom, with respect to length of
service, are but as of yesterday. You, my dear sir, have no idea
how much I am interested in this affair, nor how very severely I
shall feel myself mortified if something or other cannot be done
for him before we quit this country."</p>

of the Mutiny Act, 1805, which provided that any General
Court-martial holden in New South Wales might consist of any
number of commissioned officers not less than five. But, before
this Act, it was provided in previous Mutiny Acts that a General
Court-martial might consist either of thirteen or nine
commissioned officers, as the case might require, "unless the

The facts are stated by Collins, p. 44. The officers do not seem
to have had any doubt as to their power to decide a purely legal
question of jurisdiction. "A General Court-martial assembled by
special warrant for the trial of a particular person named in
that warrant must discharge their duty by taking cognisance of
the crime and pronouncing sentence, either of condemnation or of
acquittal from the matter of charge. It has been doubted whether
it is competent for a Court so constituted to exercise any
judgment as to the legality of the trial, or the amenability of
the prisoner to their jurisdiction. The Naval Court-martial
appointed to try Captain Norris, in 1744, for misbehaviour and
cowardice in the sea-fight of Toulon, thought proper to avoid
giving any sentence, either of condemnation or acquittal, or
determining that they had no right to take trial of the charge,
as the accused person had previously given up his commission, and
was not in his Majesty's pay; although Captain Norris himself had
desired a Court-martial, which had accordingly been granted to
him. The proceedings of the Court were called for in the House of
Commons and referred to a committee, on whose report a motion was
made and passed, that those proceedings were arbitrary and
illegal. Yet there would seem to be little doubt that, if the
objection to the legality of the trial is self-evident and
insurmountable, the Court may suspend procedure till the
objection is canvassed by the proper authority; as, for example,
if the prisoner is not subject to Military Law, or if the crime
should be a civil offence, as murder, highway robbery, rape,
&amp;c., falling binder the cognisance of the ordinary municipal
Courts."&#8212;Tytler, p. 142. ln this case the objection was not
self-evident and insurmountable, and therefore the Court might
well have proceeded to hear the case, and then referred their
difficulty to the Governor, instead of deciding it themselves
without reference to him or to any one else.</p>

This appears to have been a new point in the practice of military
law. The officers having previously decided that the Governor's
warrant was valueless, and consequently that no Court-martial
could be held under it, nothing could be gained by holding a
Court of Inquiry, seeing that such a proceeding is of value only
as a preliminary to a trial by Court-martial. It answers the same
purpose as an investigation before a Grand Jury or a magistrate
in the ordinary Courts; the province of the Court of Inquiry
being to "determine, on such evidence as can be brought before
them, whether there is or is not sufficient cause for bringing
particular persons to trial for the offence or crime before a
General Court-martial."&#8212;Tytler, 341.</p>

<h3>1.14 PHILLIP AND THE NATIVES. <small>[1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> temper in which Phillip was disposed to
rule the little 1788 community placed under his charge may be
seen in the line of conduct he adopted towards the native race.
The lively interest he took in it forms one of the most
conspicuous features of his despatches. It was not merely because
he had been instructed "by every possible means to open an
intercourse with the natives and to conciliate their affections",
that he took every opportunity for doing so. He evidently felt a
personal pleasure in the task. It was the first time in his life
in which he had found himself in contact with "the Indians"; and
the study of their character, customs, and language was full of
interest for him. For that, quite as much as for any official
reason, he entered in his journal every little incident that
occurred in the course of his communications with them. The Home
Secretary, let us hope, fully appreciated the very elaborate
information in his despatches with respect to the aboriginals;
smiling, perhaps, to find him so much absorbed in his inquiries
as to their peculiar customs&#8212;as, for instance, that of
cutting off the two first joints of the little finger on the left
hand of their women. But matters of this kind, trivial as they
may seem nowadays, serve to show that he was at least sincere in
professing anxiety to promote their welfare by every means in his
power.</p>
<blockquote>The natives have ever been treated with the greatest
humanity and attention, and every precaution that was possible
has been taken to prevent their receiving any insults; and when I
shall have time to mix more with them, every means shall be used
to reconcile them to live amongst us, and to teach them the
advantages they will reap from cultivating the land.</blockquote>
<p>Although he never succeeded in teaching them to cultivate the
land, he contrived to reconcile some of them at least to living
amongst the white men. This result was owing largely, if not
entirely, to his own example. Finding it impossible to cultivate
friendly relations with them in the absence of an interpreter, he
determined to secure one of them for the purpose of training him;
and accordingly a young man named Arabanoo was captured in
December, 1788. The experiment promised to be successful, the
native having taken kindly to the ways of the white men.
Phillip's method of teaching him may be gathered from the little
sketch which Captain Hunter gives of his tea-table in the
following month of May:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As soon as the ship was secured, I went on shore to
wait on the Governor, whom I found in good health; he was sitting
by the fire, drinking tea with a few friends, among whom I
observed a native man of this country, who was decently cloathed,
and seemed to be as much at his ease at the tea-table as any
person there; he managed his cup and saucer as well as though he
had been long accustomed to such entertainment. <a href=
"#note-138" name="noteref-138" id=
"noteref-138">{1}</a></blockquote>
<p>The poor fellow did not live long enough to realise the hopes
that were entertained of him:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Five or six days after my arrival poor Arabanoo was
seized with the small-pox, and although every possible means for
his recovery were used, he lived only to the crisis of the
disease. Every person in the settlement was much concerned for
the loss of this man.</blockquote>
<p>The loss must have been keenly felt by Phillip, whose hopes of
friendly communication with the natives were then, for the time
at least, extinguished. But his first experiment having been so
far a success, he determined to make another; and in November of
the same year two natives were seized and brought up to the
settlement. Their names were Coalby and Bennilong; but both of
them made their escape before they had been many weeks in
captivity, and rejoined their friends in the bush. They were
afterwards induced to pay friendly visits to the
settlement:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As the Governor and every other person in the
settlement had ever been kind to them, they were inclined to
depend on the Governor's promise, and did come to Sydney; were
kindly received, went from house to house, and saw all their old
acquaintances; they received many little presents, and returned
to their friends when they thought proper. This confidential
visit from two men, who appeared to have some influence among
their countrymen, soon brought about a more general intercourse,
and the next visit from those men brought the same favour from
their wives and families, whose example was followed by many
others; so that every gentleman's house was now become a resting
or sleeping place for some every night; whenever they were
pressed for hunger, they had immediately recourse to our
quarters. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139" id=
"noteref-139">{2}</a></blockquote>
<p>It was by these means that Phillip endeavoured to establish a
good understanding with the natives, and as far as it was
possible for him to succeed in such a matter, he may be said to
have succeeded. But it was not possible for him to make everyone
else follow his example, or even obey his orders <a href=
"#note-140" name="noteref-140" id="noteref-140">{3}</a> the
savages, friendly at first, were provoked from time to time by
the convicts, and of course retaliated; every act of retaliation
increased the ill-feeling on both sides, and at last led the way,
in after times, to open violence and bloodshed. <a href=
"#note-141" name="noteref-141" id="noteref-141">{4}</a></p>
<p>So far as his own efforts were concerned, Phillip appears to
have been peculiarly fortunate in his intercourse with the
natives, seldom failing to make friends of them at once whenever
he met them. A passage in Lieutenant King's Journal, <a href=
"#note-142" name="noteref-142" id="noteref-142">{5}</a> in which
he relates his adventure with the natives at Botany Bay on the
day the Sirius arrived there, furnishes an illustration on this
point. King and his party had met several of them and endeavoured
to gain them over:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I advanced before them, unarmed, presenting some
beads and ribbands; two of the natives advanced armed, but would
not come close to me; I then dropped the beads and baize which I
held out for them, and retreated; they took it up and bound the
baize about their heads. They then in a very vociferous manner
desired us to begone; and one of them threw a lance wide of us,
to show how far they could do execution.</blockquote>
<p>King, who was accompanied by Lieutenant Dawes and three
marines, thought it judicious to beat a retreat, and accordingly
did so, the natives following them up; but&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>they were ten times more vociferous, and very soon
after a lance was thrown amongst us, on which I ordered one of
the marines to fire with powder only, when they ran off with
great precipitation. I embarked, and Governor Phillip joined me
from the south side of the bay, where he had found the natives
very sociable and friendly. We relanded on Lance Point [so named
by King from the lance having been thrown to frighten him] and
the same body of natives appeared, brandishing their lances and
defying us. However, we rowed close in shore, and the Governor
disembarked with some presents, which one of them came and
received. Thus peace was established, much to the satisfaction of
all parties.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip had no difficulty in making friends of the men whom
King found it necessary to frighten with gunpowder. Why the
natives readily made peace with one man while they repelled the
other, is a question that can only be answered in one way. The
result could not have been owing to any other cause than
Phillip's tact, courage, and self-possession in dealing with
them. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143" id=
"noteref-143">{6}</a> Another instance of his success may be seen
in the incident which occurred on a subsequent occasion. Having
set out in search of some natives who had killed two men at
Rushcutters' Bay, he suddenly came upon a large number of them,
"and in less than three minutes we were surrounded by two hundred
and twelve men." It was a critical moment, and no doubt he felt
the danger of his position:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Had I gone up to them with all the party, though only
twelve, or hesitated a moment, a lance would have been thrown,
and it would have been impossible to have avoided a
dispute.</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, he had time enough to halt his men while he
advanced alone, and by that means he avoided the collision which
otherwise would have been inevitable. The event justified his
theory that the only means of warding off a conflict with the
natives was to place confidence in them.</p>
<p>Another instance of his coolness in these cases may be found
in his account of a trip to Broken Bay. A native who had shown
signs of friendship towards the white men, having helped himself
to a spade, was promptly corrected by Phillip, who gave him two
or three slaps on the shoulder and pushed him away.</p>
<blockquote>This destroyed our friendship in a moment, and
seizing a spear he came close up to me, poised it, and appeared
determined to Poising a Strike; but whether from seeing that his
threats were not regarded for I chose rather to risk the spear
than fire on him, or from any thing the other natives said who
surrounded him, after a few moments he dropped his spear and left
us.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip modestly adds that he mentioned the circumstance to
show that the natives did not want personal courage, for several
officers and men were then near him. But it also showed that he
himself had something more than personal courage; the coolness
and self-possession he displayed when his life was threatened
were remarkable. Most men in his place would have fired at the
savage the moment they saw him poise the spear, and the act would
have been considered justifiable; for even if the spear was not
poised with the intention of throwing it, Phillip could not have
known that; and it was not thrown simply because the man was
disarmed by his heroism. On a subsequent occasion he was not so
fortunate, being seriously wounded by a spear thrown at him by a
native who had been introduced to him by Bennilong at Manly Cove.
Such an event was sufficient to show the necessity for caution as
well as courage in dealing with savages, whose action is
habitually guided by the impulse of the moment. <a href=
"#note-144" name="noteref-144" id="noteref-144">{7}</a></p>
<p>His narrow escape from death on that occasion did not deter
him from acting in his usual manner towards the natives. He knew
that the man who threw the spear was not actuated by treachery,
but was acting in self-defence, being under the impression, when
Phillip advanced towards him with open hands, that he was about
to be seized and carried off in the same way that other natives
had been captured by the Governor's orders. Nothing indeed that
had occurred during his intercourse with the tribes had led him
to regard the natives as treacherous. <a href="#note-145" name=
"noteref-145" id="noteref-145">{8}</a> An unfavourable opinion on
that point was expressed by Captain Hunter and Surgeon White,
based on the fact that the natives frequently attacked white men
whom they happened to meet unarmed, while they never interfered
with those who carried arms. These attacks, however, were
probably&#8212;as Phillip always believed&#8212;acts of
retaliation. In the first months of the settlement the canoes and
spears, which they had been accustomed to leave on the beaches,
were frequently carried off by the convicts and the seamen of the
transports; for which revenge was taken whenever an opportunity
offered, according to native law. The aggressors, in all cases,
were necessarily the men who had not only driven the natives out
of their hunting-grounds, but had taken away their means of
livings&#8212;especially the fish. <a href="#note-146" name=
"noteref-146" id="noteref-146">{9}</a> Phillip recognised their
right to that kind of property by ordering the boating parties
always to give the natives a share of any fish that might be
caught. He relates that on one occasion&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Twenty of the natives came down to the beach, each
armed with a number of spears, and seized on a part of the fish
caught in the seine. While the greatest number were seizing the
fish, several stood at a small distance with their spears poised,
ready to throw them if any resistance had been made; but the
coxswain very prudently permitted them to take what they chose,
and they parted good friends. They at present find it very
difficult to support themselves.</blockquote>
<p>If we compare this passage with one in Cook's Voyage, under
date 19 July, 1770, describing an attempt made by the natives on
the Endeavour River to seize some turtle on board his ship, there
will be no difficulty in understanding the native view of the
matter. In both cases it is evident that the act&#8212;which to
the European mind would present the appearance of an impudent
attempt at robbery&#8212;was in fact an assertion of right on the
part of the native owners. <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"
id="noteref-147">{10}</a></p>
<p>There was one occasion, however, on which Phillip felt called
upon to alter his usual line of conduct towards the natives, with
the view of teaching them a much-needed lesson. In the month of
December, 1790, <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148" id=
"noteref-148">{11}</a> a party consisting of a Serjeant of
marines and three convicts&#8212;among whom was a man named
McEntire, "the Governor's game-keeper"&#8212;was sent out for the
purpose of shooting kangaroos at Botany Bay, in order to increase
the stock of provisions, which had then become alarmingly small.
During the night, they were disturbed in their camp by a noise
among the bushes near them, which they found was occasioned by
some natives&#8212;two of whom were seen creeping towards them
with spears in their hands, while three others appeared a little
behind. McEntire then got up, saying that he knew them, and
laying down his gun, went towards them. They retreated slowly
while he followed and began talking in a friendly way with them.
One of them suddenly jumped on a fallen tree, and without giving
the least warning of his intention, launched his spear at
McEntire with such force as to drive it seven and a half inches
into his left side. The unfortunate man lingered for some weeks
afterwards and then died. Phillip was at Rose Hill when the
affair occurred, but on the day after he returned to Sydney, and
immediately issued the following order:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Several tribes of the natives still continue to throw
spears at any man they meet unarmed, by which several have been
killed, or dangerously wounded:&#8212;The Governor, in order to
deter the natives from such practices in future, has ordered out
a party to search for the man who wounded the convict McEntire in
so dangerous a manner on Friday last, though no offence was
offered on his part, in order to make a signal example of that
tribe. At the same time, the Governor strictly forbids, under
penalty of the severest punishment, any soldier or other person
not expressly ordered out for that purpose, ever to fire on any
native, except in his own defence; or to molest him in any shape,
or to bring away any spears, or other articles, which they may
find belonging to these people. The natives will be made severe
example of whenever any man is wounded by them; but this will be
done in a manner which may satisfy them, that it is a punishment
inflicted on them for their own bad conduct, and of which they
cannot be made sensible, if they are not treated with kindness
while they continue peaceable and quiet.<br>
<br>
A party, consisting of two captains, two subalterns, and forty
privates, with a proper number of non-commissioned officers from
the garrison, with three days' provisions, &amp;c., are to be
ready to march to-morrow morning at daylight, in order to bring
in six of those natives who reside near the head of Botany Bay;
or, if that should be found impracticable, to put that number to
death.</blockquote>
<p>Captain Tench proceeds to relate that, having been appointed
to command the party, he received further instructions from
Phillip personally to the following effect:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>That we were, if practicable, to bring away two
natives and to put to death ten; that no hut was to be burned;
that all women and children were to remain uninjured, not being
comprehended within the scope of the order; that our operations
were to be directed either by surprise or open force; that after
we had made any prisoners all communication, even with those
natives with whom we were in habits of intercourse, was to be
avoided, and none of them suffered to approach us; that we were
to cut off and bring in the heads of the slain, for which purpose
hatchets and bags will be furnished; and, finally, that no signal
of amity or invitation should be used in order to allure them to
us, or if made on their part should be answered by us; for that
such, conduct would not only be present treachery, but give them
reason to distrust every future mark of peace and friendship on
our part.</blockquote>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the soldiers did not
succeed in surprising any of the suspected tribe. It is evident
that Phillip at that time had not made himself acquainted with
the habits and customs of the natives when on the warpath, or he
would not have entertained the idea of despatching a large armed
force in order to seize the men he wanted. But his determination
to inflict punishment for an act which he looked upon as wanton
murder shows that his usual course of action towards the natives
was not dictated by any misplaced feeling of sympathy, but was
the result of his deliberate convictions on the subject. Lenient
and forbearing as he was towards them, he was not prepared to
condone an unprovoked outrage on their part. In this instance
there is some reason to believe that the opinion he had formed of
the matter was not altogether a sound one. Tench informs us that
"from the aversion uniformly shown by all the natives to this
unhappy man (McEntire), he had long been suspected by us of
having, in his excursions, shot and injured them." The manner in
which the crime was committed would certainly lead one to suppose
that it was entirely an act of revenge, provoked by some previous
aggression on the part of the victim; and so far it would serve
to confirm Phillip's original theory with respect to the many
attacks upon unarmed men of which complaint was made.</p>
<p>Looking back now on his benevolent but unavailing efforts to
civilise the natives, it seems matter for regret that so little
should have been done by the Home Government&#8212; either in his
time or in that of his successors&#8212;to establish some
definite principles of action for the purpose of reclaiming them.
The task of civilising a savage race was altogether beyond the
power of any one man in the colony to accomplish, especially at a
time when the struggle for existence was so sharply felt. It was
pre-eminently the work of a central Government; the means of
doing it, as well as the moral obligation to do it, lay there,
and not with the embarrassed head of the colonial administration;
still less with the scattered settlers, who so soon found
themselves engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle with the natives.
There is nothing to show that the Government entertained even the
idea of improving their mode of life. Phillip was instructed to
open an intercourse with them and to conciliate their affections;
every one in the colony was to be enjoined to live in amity and
kindness with them; they were not to be wantonly destroyed or
unnecessarily interrupted in their occupations. But nothing was
said about civilising them. That was Phillip's idea, conceived as
soon as he found himself in their midst, and carried out as far
as his means and opportunities would allow. Savages, however, are
not to be reclaimed by individual acts of kindness; if the work
is to be done at all, it can only be done on an organised
system.</p>
<p>That much might have been effected in that direction under the
influence of a sound method of administration, devised and
controlled by the Home Government, will hardly be denied. Sir
George Grey offered several practical suggestions in a "report
upon the best means of promoting the civilisation of the
aboriginal inhabitants of Australia", submitted by him to Lord
John Russell in 1840. Among these suggestions was one that might
at least have been tested in Australia, as it has been to some
extent in India: that savage customs, inconsistent with civilised
life, and necessarily tending to perpetuate savagery, should be
prohibited. <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149" id=
"noteref-149">{12}</a> The report was "approved", and copies of
it were sent to the Governors of the Australian colonies and New
Zealand; but there the matter ended. The natives all over
Australia have been left in the enjoyment of their most
brutalising laws and customs, and the consequence has justified
Sir George Grey's contention. The only measures that have been
adopted with a view to their redemption are, the establishment of
schools for aboriginal children and the distribution of rations
and clothing among the old and infirm. According to the last
report of the Aborigines Protection Board, the census taken in
October, 1887, showed that the total number in New South Wales
for that year, including full-blood and half-castes, was 7,902,
of whom 5,042 were full-blood, and 2,860 were half-castes. The
number of children attending school in the preceding year was
384; and the amount distributed during that year for supplies was
&#163;3,608.</p>
<p>The race is fast disappearing in this colony, and the date of
its final disappearance cannot be very far off. Phillip estimated
that there were fully 1,500 natives living about the shores of
Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay in his time; but there
are none to be seen now. Taking his estimate as a basis for
calculation, there were probably many thousands at that time
scattered over the immense territory included in the boundaries
of New South Wales; and at the present day, had not their natural
increase been summarily checked by contact with civilisation,
instead of the melancholy remnant of the tribes now struggling
against destiny, large masses of them would have been gaining
their own subsistence at the spear's point. That would have
occurred in the ordinary course of nature. Whether the interests
of civilisation are better served by the destruction of the race
than they would have been by its preservation and redemption, is
a question for philosophers to settle. That they were not by
nature incapable of being civilised&#8212;so far, at least, as
any savage race can be civilised at all&#8212;is now generally
admitted. From the time&#8212;just two centuries ago <a href=
"#note-150" name="noteref-150" id=
"noteref-150">{13}</a>&#8212;when Dampier pronounced them "the
miserablest People in the World", they remained for many years
after the occupation of the country under that stigma; but it has
long since been rejected as unfounded and unjust. Sir George Grey
considered them "as apt and intelligent as any other race of men
I am acquainted with"; <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151" id=
"noteref-151">{14}</a> and many other well-qualified observers
have expressed similar opinions. In the journals of Australian
explorers may be found many tributes to their intelligence and
fidelity, as well as to their wonderful faculties as bushmen.
"They have been described", said Sir T. L. Mitchell, "as the
lowest in the scale of humanity, yet I found those who
accompanied me superior in penetration and judgment to the white
men composing my party. . . . It would ill become me to disparage
the character of the aborigines, for one of that unfortunate race
has been my 'guide, companion, councillor, and friend', on the
most eventful occasions during this last journey of discovery."
<a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152" id="noteref-152">{15}</a>
No one has spoken more emphatically in their favour than Edward
John Eyre, the explorer, although no one had more cause to
complain of their so-called treachery. He, like Grey, suffered
severely from a wanton act of aggression on the part of the
natives; but, like Grey, he could discriminate between deliberate
treachery and mere impulse; and even where treachery was proved,
he did not dream of condemning a whole race for the wrong-doing
of a few. Notwithstanding his personal grievance, he could speak
of them as "a people hitherto considered the lowest and most
irreclaimable of mankind, but whose natural capabilities and
endowments are, I feel assured, by no means inferior to those of
the most favoured nations." <a href="#note-153" name=
"noteref-153" id="noteref-153">{16}</a> This may seem rather an
extreme assertion; but it is confirmed by the independent
testimony of many capable judges. Of all men whose opinions might
be safely taken on such a question, there are certainly none more
entitled to respect than Grey, Mitchell, and Eyre. Taken
together, the chapters on the manners and customs of the natives
written by Grey and Eyre form perhaps the best critical
dissection of the aboriginal character that has yet been
published. Although each of these writers looked at his subject
from a totally different standpoint, their conclusions are
singularly uniform, not only as to the capacity but as to the
character and disposition of the native race. If kindness to
strangers in distress or devotion to a dying master be any test
of good feeling, it would be difficult to find in history more
touching instances than those recorded of the blacks at Cooper's
Creek in the last hours of Burke, Wills, and King, and of the
faithful savage who watched over Kennedy in the agony of
death.</p>
<p>Much has been said and written about the cruelty shown by the
settlers to the natives from the earliest times; and no one can
justify the many murderous acts by which it was sought to hold
them in check when their numbers made them formidable. But the
ultimate question that arises out of this matter is&#8212;with
whom lay the responsibility? It was a war of races, and the
consequences of such a struggle were inevitable. That they might
have been avoided, or at least greatly alleviated, is plain from
this consideration; theoretically, the law recognised no
distinction between black and white; it held the life of one as
dear as that of the other; but practically it deprived the native
of the protection which it gave the European by rejecting his
evidence in Court. <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154" id=
"noteref-154">{17}</a> If, therefore, he could not look to the
law as a means of redress, it was but natural that he, as a
savage, should seek a remedy in his own way. This was but one of
many evil consequences which flowed from the want of an
intelligent system in dealing with the question, and which should
have been established by the Home Government concurrently with
the occupation of the territory.</p>

Journal, p. 132. Tench gives us a similar picture of the
Governor's dinner-party on New Year's Day, 1789:&#8212;"To-day,
being New Year's Day, most of the officers were invited to the
Governor's table. Manly [Arabanoo was so named by Phillip because
he was captured at Manly Cove, his native name not being then
known], dined heartily on fish and roasted pork; he was seated on
a chest near a window, out of which, when he had done eating, he
would have thrown his plate, had he not been prevented. During
dinner-time, a band of music played in an adjoining apartment;
and after the cloth was removed, one of the company sang in a
very soft and superior style; but the powers of melody were lost
on Manly, which disappointed our expectations, as he had before
shown pleasure and readiness in imitating our
tunes."&#8212;Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson,
p. 13. Their musical capacity was noticed by Tench while the
ships were at Botany Bay:&#8212;"The Indians, though terrified at
the report (of the gun), did not run away; but their astonishment
exceeded their alarm, on looking at the shield which the ball had
perforated. As this produced a little shyness, the officer, to
dissipate their fears and remove their jealousy, whistled the air
of Malbrooke, which they appeared highly charmed with, and
imitated him with equal pleasure and readiness. I cannot help
remarking here, what I was afterwards told by Monsieur De
P&#233;rouse, that the natives of California, and throughout all
the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and in short wherever he had
been, seemed equally touched and delighted with this little
plaintive air."&#8212;Narrative, p. 58.</p>

The difficulty experienced by Phillip in enforcing obedience to

have been ill-used, or that some misunderstanding has taken

"Every tribe has its own district, the boundaries of which are
well-known to the natives generally; and within that district all
the wild animals are considered as much the property of the tribe
inhabiting, or rather ranging on, its whole extent, as the flocks
of sheep and herds of cattle that have been introduced into the
country by adventurous Europeans, are held by European law and
usage the property of their respective owners."&#8212;Dr. Lang,
quoted in Captain Grey's Journals of Two Expeditions, 1841, vol.
ii, p. 283.<br>
<br>
"The foundation of their social edifice may, like that of
civilised nations, be said to rest on an inherent sense of the
rights of property. As strongly attached to that property, and to
the rights which it involves, as any European political body, the
tribes of Australia resort to precisely similar measures for
protecting it, and seek redress and revenge for its violated laws
through the same means as an European nation would, if similarly
situated. Thus, if his territory has been trespassed upon, in
hunting, by a neighbouring tribe, compensation or a reparation of
the insult is asked refused, war ensues; and when both tribes
display equal force and courage, in most cases ends in a feud
which is bequeathed to future generations."&#8212;Strzelecki,

Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia,
1845, pp. 412-4. This passage contains a strong confirmation of
the opinion which Mitchell had formed of them ten years
previously. He said then:&#8212;"My experience enables me to
speak in the most favourable terms of the aborigines, whose
degraded position in the midst of the white population affords no
just criterion of their merits. The quickness of apprehension of
those in the interior is very extraordinary, for nothing in all
the complicated adaptations we carried with us either surprised
or puzzled them. They are never awkward; on the contrary, in
manners and general intelligence they appear superior to any
class of white rustics that I have seen. Their powers of mimicry
seem extraordinary, and their shrewdness shines even through the
medium of imperfect language, and renders them, in general, very
agreeable companions."&#8212;Three Expeditions, 1838, vol. ii, p.
334.<br>
<br>
In the same volume (p. 346) the author said:&#8212;"Some adequate
provision for their civilisation and maintenance is due on our
part to this race of men, were it only in return for the means of
existence of which we are depriving them. The bad example of the
class of persons sent to Australia should be counteracted by some
serious efforts to civilise and instruct these aboriginal
inhabitants."<br>
<br>
Lieutenant-Col. Mundy, who was appointed Deputy Adjutant-General
in the Australian Colonies in 1846, gave the result of his
observations on the subject in equally strong terms:&#8212;"Yet,
low in the scale of humanity as is the grade of the Australian
savage, I agree with those who believe the assumption unfair that
he is incapable of attaining the same standard of intelligence as
the European. No really effectual and properly sustained plan for
his amelioration has as yet been extended to him. Efforts,
prodigal indeed in zeal and money, have been made to civilise and
christianise him, but they have hitherto met with signal
failure.... The promptitude with which the Australian blacks,
enrolled in the police, have acquired a proficiency not only in
the manual parts of their duties, but in discipline, abstinence
from drink, obedience to orders, &amp;c., affords satisfactory
testimony of their aptitude for better things. For bush duties,
especially against their own countrymen, the native police is
infinitely more effective than the English police. Nor is there,
I think, anything very extravagant in the assumption that the
creature who has sufficient skill and energy to construct the
spear and boomerang, to transfix the kangaroo at sixty paces,
strike down the bird on the wing, ensnare the river fish with his
nets, and pierce the sea fish with his harpoon, who can
manufacture his canoe and its implements, is capable, also, of
learning more useful though in fact less ingenious arts and
sciences."&#8212;Our Antipodes, 4th edition, 1857, p. 52.</p>

"The fact of the natives being unable to give testimony in a
Court of Justice is a great hardship on them, and they consider
it as such; the reason that occasions their disability is at
present quite beyond their comprehension, and it is impossible to
explain it to them. I have been a personal witness to a case in

<h3>1.15. PHILLIP AND EXPLORATION. <small>[1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>PHILLIP'S</small> place in the ranks of Australian
explorers seems to have been but faintly recognised in history.
Notwithstanding the fact that his name stands first on the list,
and that his discoveries were of very great importance, it has
been his unhappy fate to have his name and memory associated so
closely with the dismal days of the convict era that his
achievements outside that gloomy circle have been almost ignored.
When he told Sydney of the only consolation he had for his
unpleasant position&#8212;the reflection that he was rendering a
very essential service to his country by founding a colony
destined to prove the most valuable acquisition Great Britain
ever made, it did not occur to him that his career in it would
be, in many minds at least, identified with so much of the least
attractive portion of its history. It was no doubt with a sense
of relief that he turned his steps away so frequently from the
Camp at Sydney Cove towards the sea-coast or the bush, for the
purpose of making himself acquainted with the character of his
new dominions. However much he may have been impelled by that
feeling, the love of travel and adventure must have been strong
within him, for he was always moving from one point to another
within the limited area of exploration then open to him. <a href=
"#note-155" name="noteref-155" id="noteref-155">{1}</a> His
energy and activity in the character of an explorer were
conspicuously shown from the very day of his arrival. He had no
sooner dropped anchor in Botany Bay than he set to work to
examine its capabilities as a harbour; and then, turning his
attention to the land, he endeavoured to satisfy himself as to
its suitability for a settlement. A very slight inspection of the
surrounding country was enough to convince him that a better site
would have to be sought for at once. Point Sutherland was the
only place that could be found for the purpose in the bay, but
the ground about it was spongy, and swamps would necessarily
prove unhealthy. To save time&#8212;mindful, no doubt, of
Sydney's imperious injunction not to "delay the disembarkation of
the establishment upon the pretence of seeking a more eligible
place than Botany Bay"&#8212;instructions were given to have the
ground cleared for landing, and he then sailed away in an open
boat, regardless of his dignity as a Governor-in-Chief, for the
nearest bay to the north, of which he knew nothing beyond what he
had read about it in Cook's Voyage. <a href="#note-156" name=
"noteref-156" id="noteref-156">{2}</a></p>
<p>If Phillip had reason to congratulate himself on the good
fortune which had so far attended his voyage, his heart must have
rejoiced within him when his boats, after entering the heads of
Port Jackson, began to work their way through its waters. As he
passed from cove to cove, carefully examining each to ascertain
its fitness for the site of a settlement, he no doubt experienced
much the same sensations as the long-forgotten Portuguese
navigator, Martin de Souza, when he discovered the other great
harbour of the world&#8212;that of Rio de Janeiro&#8212;in 1531.
Phillip, it is true, could not make any claim to the honour of
being the discoverer as well as the explorer of Port Jackson; but
he was the first European to gaze upon its waters and make them
known to the world. Unfortunately, however, he left no record of
his impressions as the novelty and grandeur of the scenery were
displayed before him. In his despatch to Lord Sydney he contented
himself with saying that he "had the satisfaction of finding the
finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line
may ride in the most perfect security". Fresh from the great
harbour of the Brazils, he had no doubt compared the two well in
his own mind before pronouncing judgment so emphatically in
favour of Port Jackson. <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"
id="noteref-157">{3}</a> The exploration of such a
harbour&#8212;which removed at once every possible doubt with
respect to the ultimate success of the expedition&#8212;was a
signal triumph for Phillip and a rich reward for his labours; and
at the same time it probably acted as a powerful stimulus to
further exertions in the same direction. If the prospect of
making some great discovery with which their names would be for
ever identified in history has stirred the ambition of so many
explorers since his time, it may be safely assumed that he too
was inspired with much the same feeling. That he was so
influenced by this success in a field of action altogether new to
him is evident from his despatches; and he lost no time in
following up his first achievement. As soon as the ships had come
round from Botany Bay, the people had been landed, the tents
pitched, clearing begun, and the colony proclaimed. Lieutenant
King was despatched to Norfolk Island for the purpose of
occupying it; and Phillip then, on the 2nd of March, set off to
explore Broken Bay, where Captain Cook, at sunset of the day on
which he had passed Port Jackson, had noticed "some broken land
that seemed to form a bay."</p>
<p>The immediate object of this excursion was "not only to survey
the harbour; if any were found to exist, but to examine whether
there were within it any spots of ground capable of cultivation,
and of maintaining a few families." <a href="#note-158" name=
"noteref-158" id="noteref-158">{4}</a> Of the two purposes, the
discovery of good farming land was much the more important; for
up to that time no such land had been found either at the
settlement or near it; and as Phillip had been told to look to
the soil as a principal means of supporting his people, the
necessity for getting a large area under cultivation as soon as
possible had become urgent. He did not succeed in finding any
land of the kind required, except near the southern entrance of
the bay, where he came upon "the finest piece of water I ever
saw"&#8212;which he immediately named Pittwater, after the great
Prime Minister. There he found "some good situations where the
land might be cultivated"; but they were not adapted for his
purposes, although there was no want of water; "we found small
springs of water in most of the coves, and saw three cascades
falling from a height which the rains then rendered
inaccessible", Phillip spent eight days in rowing about the three
branches of the harbour and examining the coves; but "the almost
continual rains prevented any kind of survey." The bay was
afterwards surveyed by Captain Hunter, in August, 1789. It proved
to be a very fine piece of scenery, spreading itself out in four
large branches; but the entrance of the northern branch&#8212;now
called Brisbane Water&#8212;was obstructed by a sand-bar, "that
had only water for small vessels." The rainy weather rendering it
impossible to explore either the bay or its shores
satisfactorily, Phillip was compelled to return sooner than he
otherwise would have done; and "some of the people feeling the
effects of the rain", he had to return by water instead of by
land, and was thus prevented from examining "a part of the
country which appeared open and free from timber."</p>
<p>During his interviews with the natives at Broken Bay he had
many opportunities of observing their peculiar customs, which
puzzled him a good deal&#8212;especially that of cutting off two
joints from the little finger of the left hand among the women.
He noticed also that the men had the right front tooth in the
upper jaw knocked out, wore a piece of wood or bone in the nose,
and were scarified about the breast and arms. Some of their
graves were opened, and from the ashes found in them he "had no
doubt but that they burn their dead."</p>
<p>The next expedition set out on the 15th of April, when Phillip
endeavoured to explore the country on the sea-coast a little to
the north of Port Jackson. Landing at Shell Cove, between Manly
Beach and the North Head, <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"
id="noteref-159">{5}</a> he found, further on, "a passage with
deep water into a branch of the harbour that runs to the
north-west." On examining this part of the country he came across
"a run of fresh water that came from the westward", and a few
days afterwards he proceeded to trace it up to its source. In the
course of this journey a large lake was met with and examined,
but not without great labour, as it was "surrounded with a bog
and a large marsh, in which we were frequently up to our middle."
This lake is known to excursionists of the present day as Lake
Narrabeen, and is frequently visited by coach on the road from
Manly to Pittwater. Here Phillip saw a black swan for the first
time, and thought it "a noble bird." It took the party three
days' hard work to get round the swamps and marshes which they
met with on their way; but the traveller nowadays is not
obstructed in that manner, the swamps and marshes having long
since disappeared under the influence of drainage and
cultivation. The result justifies the philosophic reflections
indulged in on this subject by the editor of Phillip's Voyage, on
"the great improvement which may be made by the industry of a
civilised people in this country." <a href="#note-160" name=
"noteref-160" id="noteref-160">{6}</a></p>
<p>Phillip made one or two other discoveries besides that of the
lake on this occasion. When about fifteen miles from the coast he
had "a very fine view of the mountains inland"&#8212;by which he
meant the celebrated range afterwards known as the Blue
Mountains. Those to the north he named the Carmarthen Hills,
those to the south the Lansdowne, and one that rose up between
them Richmond Hill&#8212; after some political celebrities of the
time. While gazing I the distant range an idea occurred to him
which led to one of his most important discoveries. "From, the
rising these mountains I did not doubt but that a large river
would be found"; and in order to satisfy himself on that point he
determined to make another exploration in a different
direction.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he set off again a week afterwards, and having
landed near the head of the harbour, tried to make his way
through the country before him straight to the mountains. This
might be called the first of the many attempts to explore the
Blue Mountains made during a period of twenty-five years; for it
was not until 1813 that the colonists succeeded in cutting a
passage through them. Phillip had not gone far on his way before
he was stopped by the scrub which he called "a close
cover"&#8212;and was obliged to return. On the following day, a
fresh start was made. By keeping along the banks of a small creek
for about four miles the party managed to escape the scrub, and
then came upon some unusually good country&#8212;"as fine as any
I ever saw"&#8212;the trees growing from twenty to forty feet
apart from each other, and no scrub, except where the soil was
poor. It was this sort of country that charmed the eyes of
Captain Cook and his friends when, "properly accoutred for the
expedition", they made their little "excursions into the country"
at Botany Bay&#8212;finding in one direction "the face of the
country finely diversified by wood and lawn", and in another
"some of the finest meadows in the world." Phillip was so pleased
with the undulating landscape before him, with its wild flowers
and birds of brilliant plumage flitting through the trees, that
he found ordinary English unequal to the expression of his
feelings, and therefore gave it the name of Belle
Vue&#8212;probably in recollection of some pleasant landscape in
the old world.</p>
<p>But the river was not discovered; it had taken the party five
days to make thirty miles, and there was yet no sign of it. The
provisions they had taken with them would not last long enough to
enable them to make any further attempt on that occasion to reach
the mountains, and Phillip suffered so much from a pain in the
side&#8212;brought on by sleeping for several nights on damp
ground at Broken Bay&#8212;that he was obliged to return; but he
did so with the intention of renewing the attempt in a few days.
The good country they had seen, and the prospect of discovering a
large river, "made everyone, notwithstanding the fatigue,
desirous of being of the party"; and they were not a little
encouraged to make another attempt by the traces of the natives
which they had seen. Phillip says he "was surprised to find
temporary huts made by the natives far inland, where they must
depend solely on animals for food." He did not know then what
their resources were, but took it for granted that when they left
the sea-coast wild animals were their only source of supply. His
conjectures as to their habits at this time are not a little
amusing. He could not understand how they could live at any
distance from the coast, unless wild animals were very plentiful
and easily caught; being under the impression that fish was their
principal means of subsistence. "Whether they live in the woods
by choice, or are driven from the society of those who inhabit
the sea-coast, or whether they travel to a distant part of the
country, I can form no judgment at present." Evidently he was
still much more of a sailor than a bushman, and the idea of such
savages living wholly in the bush all the year round seemed out
of the question to him. It had not yet occurred to him that the
bush maintained its tribes as well as the sea-coast, and that
wherever the explorer might go in the interior he would be sure
to meet with the natives. The only point on which he was quite
clear was, that "when they go inland they certainly do not carry
any fish to support them." <a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161"
id="noteref-161">{7}</a></p>
<p>The most helpful discovery inland made by Phillip during his
first year of office was that of some good farming land near the
head of the harbour, where he found "a tract of country running
to the westward for many miles which appears to be in general
rich, good land." The necessity for cultivating land largely in
order to support his people had been daily making itself more and
more felt, the land about Sydney Cove being found practically
useless for the purpose. The first farm made in the colony was at
Farm Cove&#8212;whence its name&#8212;and there nine acres were
laid down in corn soon after the settlement was formed: but nine
acres were obviously not enough to support over a thousand
persons, and Phillip was consequently driven to explore the
surrounding country in search of better soil. Hence his frequent
journeys north, south, and west. The only available land which he
succeeded in finding for some time was near the head of the
harbour, at a place which he named Rose Hill&#8212; not knowing
at the time that the native name was Parramatta. Here, in
November, 1788, he commenced operations on a large scale, and
with so much success that Rose Hill soon became an important
establishment. <a href="#note-162" name="noteref-162" id=
"noteref-162">{8}</a> His own experience as a gentleman farmer
while settled at Lyndhurst, in the New Forest, was probably
turned to some practical account here; at any rate, it lent some
little attraction to his labours. <a href="#note-163" name=
"noteref-163" id="noteref-163">{9}</a> When Captain Hunter
visited the place in May, 1789, after his voyage to the Cape of
Good Hope for provisions, he was surprised to find the little
settlement in a very flourishing condition; and in July, 1790,
Phillip "laid down the lines of a regular town" there; the
principal street being one mile in length, with a breadth of two
hundred and five feet. The regular town was afterwards named
Parramatta by Phillip, on the 4th June, 1791&#8212;that being the
King's birthday.</p>
<p>The Rose Hill experiment led to other results besides an
extension of farming operations. It convinced Phillip that the
only means by which the cultivation of the soil could be carried
on with permanent success, so as to render the colony independent
of supplies from England, was to introduce free settlers, and
supply them with convict labour on certain terms until they had
established themselves. It was entirely owing to his repeated and
emphatic representations on this subject that the Home Government
consented, in 1792, to send out free settlers; and the method of
dealing with convict labour, afterwards known as the Assignment
system, is clearly traceable to the same source. The first
settlers&#8212;there were only five of them&#8212;arrived early
in 1793, after Phillip had left the colony; and each received a
small grant of land "at the upper part of the harbour above the
Flats". to which they gave the name of Liberty Plains. One of the
conditions under which they engaged to settle in the colony was
that "the service of convicts should be assigned to them free of
expence, and those convicts whose services might be assigned to
them should be supplied with two years' rations and one year's
clothing". Such was the commencement of the Assignment system, of
which so much was afterwards heard. Under Phillips's
recommendation, it was originally limited to certain cases and
conditions, for the purpose of inducing free settlers to reside
in the colony and cultivate lands to be granted by the Crown.
Subsequently, however, it was developed into a very different
arrangement, under which the services of convicts might be
obtained by anyone who could feed and clothe them; and it
remained in force until the great abuses to which it naturally
gave rise ultimately led to its extinction in 1838.</p>
<p>Another excursion was made on the 22nd August in the same
year, when Phillip, who was accompanied by Lieutenants Johnston
and Cresswell, Surgeon White, and six soldiers, set out to
examine the coast between the North Head and Broken Bay. They
landed at Manly Cove and proceeded northward along the coast for
about six miles, when they were forced to halt until the tide had
run out of a lagoon, so that they could ford it. The next day
they reached the south branch of Broken Bay; but finding the
country rather too rugged for them, they returned to the
sea-shore, in order to examine the south part of the entrance
into the bay. All along the shore they met parties of the
natives, with whom they exchanged civilities. On the following
day they returned to the branch of the bay which they had seen,
making their way to it by means of a native path. At the head of
it they found a freshwater river, which took its rise, a little
above, out of a swamp. They made no discovery of any importance,
but the trip served to increase their knowledge of the country in
that direction, and enabled Mr. White to obtain several specimens
of its natural history.</p>
<p>To remove all doubt as to the capability of Botany Bay for the
purposes of settlement, and also to extend his knowledge of its
branches, Phillip sailed round with a small party in boats,
leaving Sydney on the 11th December, and remaining out for five
days. During that time he examined the different branches of the
bay, now known as Cook's River, George's River, and Woronora
River. He left no account of his trip, and consequently we have
no knowledge of the opinion he formed with respect to the country
examined; but the result confirmed him in his first impression as
to the impolicy of founding a settlement in that direction.</p>
<p>The next and perhaps the most important of Phillip's
expeditions of discovery started from head-quarters on the 6th of
June, 1789. Since his last visit to Broken Bay he had been
compelled to defer his projected excursions to the north-west for
several reasons. Not only had his health suffered from exposure,
but the departure of the Sirius for the Cape of Good Hope in
October of the previous year had deprived him of the society of
Captain Hunter and his officers, as well as of the use of her
boats and crew. The exploration of the large river of which he
had been dreaming ever since he had found himself in full view of
the Blue Mountains would require their assistance, as it would be
necessary to ascend the river from its mouth, to take soundings
and measurements, and to examine the country as they went on. The
return of the Sirius in May, 1789, enabled Phillip to carry out
his intentions, and accordingly a large party was at once
organised for the purpose. Two boats were sent on to Broken Bay
with provisions, and in a third were Phillip, Captain Hunter and
two of his officers; Captain Collins the Judge-Advocate, Captain
George Johnston of the marines&#8212;then aide-de-camp to the
Governor, and afterwards a very conspicuous character in our
history&#8212;and Surgeon White, "all armed with musquets,
&amp;c." They landed "on the north part of Port
Jackson"&#8212;probably at Manly Cove&#8212;and proceeded along
the coast towards Broken Bay, crossing many long sandy beaches
and struggling through the bush on the hill-sides, occasionally
meeting with a path "which the natives in travelling along the
coast had trod very well down." These paths spared them a good
deal of hard work in making their way through the rugged country
in which they found themselves as soon as they began to face the
hills. <a href="#note-164" name="noteref-164" id=
"noteref-164">{10}</a></p>
<p>When they had reached the shores of Broken Bay, where they
found the boats waiting for them, they proceeded to explore the
various branches of it which had been partially examined on
Phillip's previous visit. Two days were devoted to this work, and
on the third, while sailing up the north-west branch, they saw a
point of high land which had the appearance of an island.
<a href="#note-165" name="noteref-165" id="noteref-165">{11}</a>
Being determined to satisfy themselves on that point, they
proceeded to examine it, and while doing so they were led into a
branch which had not before been discovered. Following that up,
they found a good depth of water and every other indication of
the opening of an extensive river. The whole of the day was spent
in rowing up the stream, and in the evening they landed on a low
marshy point, where they pitched their tents for the night. Their
progress next morning was delayed by fogs until ten o'clock, when
the sun enabled them to find their way up the windings of the
river. The day was passed in a careful examination of the tides
and the general character of the river and surrounding country;
but they could go no further then for want of provisions, and
were compelled to return when evening came on. They had gone
about twenty miles from the entrance of the south-west branch;
but the banks of the river were so very steep where they were
that "there was not a spot on which we could erect a tent except
where it was marshy ground". The only landing-place they could
find was "a parcel of rocks", and there they passed the night.
The next day they had a fair wind, blowing fresh, and
consequently were able to sail down to Pittwater, where they
camped, and afterwards remained a few days in order to
recruit.</p>
<p>Phillip's satisfaction at this point may be easily imagined;
his confident prediction of the year before that a great river
would be found flowing from the distant mountains was now
confirmed; and if he had had a doubt remaining in his mind as to
the ultimate success of his settlement, it left him here. For a
large river meant a large stretch of fertile country on its
banks, of a very different character from that at Rose Hill or
any other place in its neighbourhood, with easy carriage for
produce by water. As soon as the river banks could be occupied
and farmed&#8212;especially if free settlers could be sent oat
for the purpose&#8212;there would be an end to all fears as to
the supply of food for the people at Sydney Cove; nor would there
be any necessity for sending the Sirius to the Cape or the Supply
to Batavia for the purpose of obtaining provisions. This was the
point which he had so long been struggling to reach; and having
at last arrived at it, he lost no time in following up his latest
discovery.</p>
<p>As soon as he had got back to Sydney Cove, he gave orders for
the preparation of another expedition, being determined to trace
the river to its distant source in the Blue Mountains. The party
included the same men as before, with an addition of five
marines, numbering altogether about forty, "all well armed and
capable of making a powerful resistance", in case they should be
attacked by the natives. They left Sydney Cove on the 28th of
June, one boat being sent on to the south branch of Broken Bay.
The land party walked, as before, from the north part of Port
Jackson to Pittwater, which they reached in five hours&#8212;very
good time, considering that each man had to carry his knapsack
and gun, and that the country they had to pass through was very
rough. No boat having made its appearance when they arrived at
Pittwater, they had to walk round all the bays, woods, and swamps
between the head and the entrance of that branch of the bay, in
order to meet the boats; and then they found the day so far gone
that there was nothing left to do but to pitch their tents for
the night.</p>
<p>The next morning they set off in the boats at daybreak; passed
Mullet Island&#8212;so named from the quantity of mullet and
other fish they had caught there on their last visit to it&#8212;
and then got into the river, reaching a point within three or
four miles of the place at which they had turned back three weeks
before. There they camped for the night. On the following day
they started again at daybreak, and after they had gone a very
short distance they found the river divided into two branches,
one leading to the north-west and the other to the south.
Following the former, they rowed all day up the stream, the banks
of which were generally "immense perpendicular mountains of
barren rock"; in some places "low marshy points covered with
reeds or rushes" intervening between the banks and the mountains.
Having found a tolerably dry spot at the foot of one of these
hills, they camped for the night.</p>
<p>Their progress next day was considerably checked by large
trees which had fallen from the banks, reaching almost across the
river. It was now so narrow as hardly to deserve the name; and at
last they found they had scarcely room for the oars or water
enough to float the boats. Nothing was left but to go back; their
estimated distance at this point from Mullet Island being
thirty-four miles. Continuing their way down, they entered the
southern branch of the river by six o'clock in the evening, and
then camped. Proceeding up this part of it next day, they found
it again divided into two other branches. Taking the one to the
north, they found the water gradually becoming shoally, the depth
being four to twelve feet; but Phillip, thinking that "it might
lead to a good country, determined to go as high as the boats
could find water." They followed the windings of the stream as
far as they could go, and managed to cover about thirteen miles
of it; the banks being much the same as those of the last, "high,
steep, and rocky mountains, with many trees growing down their
sides from between the rocks, where no one would believe there
could be any soil to nourish them." Here Captain Hunter found the
height of the opposite shore to be two hundred and fifty feet
perpendicular above the level of the river, which was thirty
fathoms wide at that point.</p>
<p>Passing next day into the second southern branch of the river
they found deeper water, and rowed for thirteen or fourteen miles
before camping for the night; but the country around them "wore a
very unpromising aspect, being either high rocky shores or low
marshy points." On the following day they went up about fourteen
miles, the banks of the river being low and covered with trees
which they called pine-trees, from the resemblance of its leaf to
that of the European pine. The banks at this part of the river
had the appearance of being ploughed up, "as if a vast herd of
swine had been living on them." When they went on shore to
examine the ground they found "the wild yam in considerable
quantities, but in general very small, not larger than a walnut."
The natives had done the ploughing.</p>
<p>While the boats were passing through a reach of the river, the
great range of mountains, of which they had caught distant
glimpses on former occasions, seemed suddenly quite close to
them&#8212;as if a veil of clouds had rolled away in a moment.
Phillip, generally happy in his selection of names, called them
the Blue Mountains. <a href="#note-166" name="noteref-166" id=
"noteref-166">{12}</a> No doubt he began to realise, while gazing
at the stupendous masses of rock split up into numberless gorges
densely covered with timber, how difficult a task lay before the
man who should venture to explore them. But his present purpose
was not to force a passage, like another Hannibal, through the
Alpine range before him, but to trace the river he had found to
its source, and ascertain as far as possible how far the
neighbouring country would serve the pressing needs of the
settlement.</p>
<p>After passing the night at the foot of a hill, they continued
their voyage up the river at daybreak on the following day, still
finding deep water and a wide channel. But as they went on the
water gradually became shallow and the channel narrow, showing
that they were not very far from the source in the mountains.
Towards evening, they found themselves at the foot of a mountain
covered with lofty trees. but free from scrub; the country all
around being pleasant to look upon, rich with grass, and without
any of those rocky patches which met their eyes so often in other
directions. The charms of the scenery led them to move some
distance up the hill before they camped. In the stillness of the
night they were startled by the roar of distant waters falling
over rocks, and concluded at once that there was a cataract in
the way which would stop their progress up the river.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy themselves on that point, they walked to
the top of the hill next morning, when they saw an immense range
of mountains only five or six miles off; between this range and
the hill on which they stood&#8212;which Phillip had named
Richmond Hill&#8212;lay a deep valley; while in the range itself
they distinctly saw "a remarkable gully or chasm" about five
miles away. On each side of this gigantic gap stood two hills,
which Phillip had named the Carmarthen and Lansdowne Hills. After
they had done justice to the scenery here, they descended the
hill towards the river; but as it was low water and the boats
could hardly float in it, they determined to wait for the next
tide, and to spend the intervening time in exploring the country.
They found it perfectly clear of scrub, the trees standing wide
apart and all of a great height. The soil, too, was good; a small
patch of it was turned up under Phillip's instructions, and a few
potatoes, some Indian corn, melon, and other seeds were sown. It
is pleasant to learn that it "was a common practice when a piece
of ground, favourable from its soil and being in an unfrequented
situation, was found, to sow a few seeds of different kinds",
<a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167" id="noteref-167">{13}</a>
and leave them to the kindly influences of nature. Some of the
little gardens which had thus been planted in the wilderness were
afterwards visited and found to be thriving, while others showed
no return for the labour. This little instance of carefulness and
forethought is characteristic of Phillip. Some of our subsequent
explorers adopted a similar practice during their journeys in the
far interior. It was on the same principle&#8212;suggested
probably by Sir Joseph Banks&#8212;that Captain Cook used to
leave pigs on the islands he visited; but in none of these cases
were the benevolent anticipations realised, either as to the pigs
or the gardens.</p>
<p>On the rising of the tide, the explorers returned to the river
in the hope that they would soon be able to trace it to its
source. They had not gone more than half a mile beyond the foot
of Richmond Hill when they found the stream again dividing into
two narrow branches, from one of which the water came down with a
rush over a fall of stones apparently lying across its entrance.
They now understood the noise of falling waters which had
attracted their attention while lying round their camp-fires on
the previous evening. Notwithstanding the noise, however, there
was not depth enough for the boats to proceed any further; they
were therefore obliged to give up the search, and with it the
hope of tracing the river to its source in that direction. The
next five days were occupied in the return to Mullet Island, many
of the smaller branches being examined on the way.</p>
<p>While they were looking about them at the falls they were
surprised to observe the signs of recent floods in the river; and
further examination revealed to them the immense force of a
mountain torrent descending from such a range as that before
them. They saw large logs of timber, which had been lodged from
thirty to forty feet above the level of the river, caught on
their way down by the clefts in the branches of trees which had
been strong enough to resist the onward sweep of the current. All
these trees had been bent by the irresistible power of the flood;
but most of them had been laid level with the ground on which
they stood, "with their tops pointing down the river, as much as
I ever saw a field of corn after a storm." The capacity for
working wreck and ruin possessed by this little mountain torrent
was evident enough even twelve or fourteen miles lower down,
where the same sort of flood-marks were visible at twenty-eight
feet above the surface of the water; although the common rise and
fall of the tide did not appear to be more than six feet. But it
was left for later colonists to learn at their cost what "a flood
in the Hawkesbury" might mean at times.</p>
<p>The return of the explorers to Sydney Cove was marked by an
incident, graphically described by Captain Hunter, <a href=
"#note-168" name="noteref-168" id="noteref-168">{14}</a> which
shows how very difficult it was in those days to move about the
country, even in the neighbourhood of the settlement. When they
had arrived at the north part of Port Jackson&#8212;somewhere
near Manly&#8212;they were unable to reach the settlement, no
boat having been sent to meet them; and consequently they had to
choose between walking round Middle Harbour to the cove in which
the Sirius was lying, or walking back to Broken Bay, where they
had left their boats. They were rescued from this dilemma by two
of the men swimming across a narrow part of Middle Harbour, and
thence making their way to Sirius Cove. "I cannot help here
remarking", says Captain Hunter, "how providential it was that we
did not all agree to walk round the north-west harbour"; and he
then proceeds to describe their meeting with the unfortunate
sailmaker of the Sirius, who had been four days lost in the bush,
and was nearly dying from hunger and exhaustion. The picturesque
places about the harbour, now so easily visited by holiday
parties in the course of a day, were then traversed with very
great fatigue and no little danger of being lost in the bush and
starved to death. <a href="#note-169" name="noteref-169" id=
"noteref-169">{15}</a> The little journeys undertaken by Phillip
from time to time may seem very small performances at the present
day; but the difficulty of penetrating the country even for
twenty or thirty miles inland can only be understood when we have
fully realised the struggles of our hardy pioneers to reach the
great barrier which blocked the way to the unknown plains of the
west. It was only by repeated efforts to reach the mountains that
the nature of the task was really comprehended. How little was
known of it in the first instance may be seen in Captain Tench's
unsuspecting allusion to it:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>At the distance of sixty miles inland, a prodigious
chain of lofty mountains runs nearly in a north and south
direction, further than the eye can trace them. Should nothing
intervene to prevent it, the Governor intends shortly to explore
their summits; and I think there can be little doubt that his
curiosity will not go unrewarded. <a href="#note-170" name=
"noteref-170" id="noteref-170">{16}</a></blockquote>
<p>It took twenty-five years, and many painful efforts, to reach
those summits. Phillip seems to have satisfied himself during his
exploration of the Hawkesbury that in his weakened state of
health the task was beyond his powers; at any rate he made no
serious attempt to scale the mountains himself. But in December,
1789, a few months after his return from his last expedition, he
despatched a small party under Lieutenant Dawes <a href=
"#note-171" name="noteref-171" id="noteref-171">{17}</a> for that
purpose. They were out for nine days, and were then obliged to
return; for in that time they had done nothing beyond struggling
through the gullies and up the rocky hills which met them
everywhere. Dawes calculated that he had reached within eleven
miles of the range, and seemed to think that he had done
something in getting so far&#8212;as no doubt he had; but the
mountains were practically as far off as ever. Collins (p. 89)
gives the following account of this expedition:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Early in this month, Lieutenant Dawes, with a small
party, taking with them just as much provisions as they could
conveniently carry, set off on an attempt to reach the western
mountains by and from the banks of the freshwater river, first
seen some time since by Captain Tench, and supposed to be a
branch of the Hawkesbury. From this excursion he returned on the
ninth day without accomplishing his design, meeting with nothing
after quitting the river but ravines that were nearly
inaccessible. He had, notwithstanding the danger and difficulty
of getting on through such a country, reached within eleven miles
of the mountains, by computation. During his toilsome march he
met with nothing very remarkable, except the impressions of a
cloven foot of an animal, differing from other cloven feet by the
great width of the division in each. He was not fortunate enough
to see the animal that had made them. <a href="#note-172" name=
"noteref-172" id="noteref-172">{18}</a></blockquote>
<p>Another important discovery&#8212;that of the Nepean
River&#8212;was made by Captain Tench in June, 1789. Having been
placed in command of the redoubt at Rose Hill shortly before that
date, he was unable to join the expedition which resulted in the
discovery of the Hawkesbury; but the success achieved on that
occasion inspired him with the ambition of acquiring some
distinction in the capacity of an explorer. "Stimulated", as he
put it, "by a desire of acquiring a further knowledge of the
country", he set out from Rose Hill at daybreak on the 26th June,
accompanied by the assistant surgeon of the settlement, the
surgeon's mate of the Sirius, two marines, and a convict. They
directed their march to a hill five miles off, in a westerly
direction, which commanded "a view of the great chain of
mountains called Carmarthen Hills, extending from north to south
further than the eye can reach." Here they paused, gazing for a
time at "the wild abyss" of impassable ranges which rose up
before them, and considering the direction they should take.
After some consultation, they determined to steer west and by
north by compass, the make of the land in that quarter indicating
the existence of a river. They continued their march all
day&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>through a country untrodden before by an European
foot. Save that a melancholy crow now and then flew croaking
overhead, or a kangaroo was seen to bound at a distance, the
picture of solitude was complete and undisturbed. At four o'clock
in the afternoon we halted near a small pond of water, where we
took up our residence for the night, lighted our fire, and
prepared to cook our supper&#8212;that was, to broil over a
couple of ramrods a few slices of salt pork and a crow which we
had shot. At daylight we renewed our peregrination; and in an
hour afterwards we found ourselves on the banks of a river,
nearly as broad as the Thames at Putney, and apparently of great
depth, the current running very slowly in a northerly direction.
Vast flocks of wild ducks were swimming in the stream; but after
being once fired at, they grew so shy that we could not get near
them a second time. Nothing is more certain than that the sound
of a gun had never before been heard within many miles of this
spot.</blockquote>
<p>They followed the course of the river for the rest of that
day, making slow progress "through reeds, thickets, and a
thousand other obstacles, over coarse sandy ground which had been
recently inundated, though full forty feet above the present
level of the river." They came upon many traces of the natives,
"sometimes in their hunting-huts&#8212;sometimes in marks on
trees which they had climbed&#8212;or in squirrel-traps&#8212;or
in decoys for ensnaring birds." Having remained out for three
days, Tench returned to Rose Hill "with the pleasing intelligence
of our discovery." The river was then named the Nepean by
Phillip, after his friend Evan Nepean. The country they passed
through was described as tolerably plain and little encumbered
with underwood, except near the river side. <a href="#note-173"
name="noteref-173" id="noteref-173">{19}</a></p>
<p>The next attempt to penetrate the country was again made by
Tench in August, 1790. In company with Dawes and Worgan, formerly
surgeon of the Sirius, he proceeded in a south-west direction as
far as a hill which he called Pyramid Hill. They came upon a
river&#8212;"unquestionably the Nepean at its source"&#8212;to
which they gave the name of the Worgan. Towards the end of the
month, the same party made another excursion to the north-west of
Rose Hill, when they again fell in with the Nepean, and traced it
to the spot where Tench discovered it fourteen months before. No
discoveries were made on these occasions, but something was added
to the knowledge of the country. <a href="#note-174" name=
"noteref-174" id="noteref-174">{20}</a></p>
<p>The unsuccessful attempts made by Dawes and others to reach
the Blue Mountains did not, however, deter Phillip from making an
effort to do so; and for that purpose he equipped another
expedition, which set out from Rose Hill on the 11th April, 1791.
<a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175" id="noteref-175">{21}</a>
The party comprised, besides himself. Tench and Dawes,
Judge-Advocate Collins and his servant, three convicts who were
considered good shots, eight soldiers with two Serjeants, and
Surgeon White; provisions for seven days being taken with them.
"Every man (the Governor excepted)"&#8212;Tench tells
us&#8212;"carried his own knapsack, which contained provisions
for ten days; if to this be added a gun, a blanket, and a
canteen, the weight will fall nothing short of forty pounds.
Slung to the knapsack are the cooking kettle and the hatchet,
with which the wood to kindle the nightly fire and build the
nightly hut is to be cut down." Two friendly natives, Colebe and
Ballederry&#8212;the latter had been living at Phillip's house
for some time&#8212;being anxious to go with them, were allowed
to do so, as "much information was expected from them." This was
the first occasion on which convicts and blacks were employed in
the work of exploration; but they were frequently taken on
subsequent expeditions. The line of march taken by Phillip was
from Rose Hill to the Hawkesbury, opposite Richmond Hill, then
across the river, and so on to the mountains. Foreseeing that a
few hours' rain at that time of the year might flood the river
and so render their return a difficult matter, he proposed to
cross it with only half-a-dozen persons, leaving the rest to
construct a raft of light wood for the purpose of punting them
over on their return; or if no wood could be found for that
purpose, to help them across with lines which were taken with
them. The first day's travelling was directed towards the
north-west, so as to cross a part of the country which had not
yet been explored. After passing several deep ravines and going
round the heads of others, over a barren but well-timbered
country, they found some good land before them, but it did not
last long; for after a few hours walking they came to a dry, arid
soil, mostly covered with loose stones. Having met with some
pools of good water towards evening, they made their fires near
them and laid down for the night. During the day they had seen
large numbers of kangaroos&#8212;of which there were two
varieties, a large grey one (patagorang), and a small red one
(baggaray). So plentiful were these animals that in one herd
alone there could not have been less than forty.</p>
<p>Starting again the next morning, a few hours brought them to
the river, which at that point was about three hundred feet wide,
with high banks; the soil about it being a light sand, extending
several hundred yards from the river, and covered with fine
straight timber. They were now eighteen and a half miles from
Rose Hill. As the current in the river was running down, they set
off to follow its windings; a man being told off to count his
paces as he went, in order that "they might always know their
situation in the woods, and the direction it would be necessary
to take when they returned across the country." The party marched
in Indian file, "the person who went first always falling into
the rear whenever he found himself fatigued." During the day they
saw "several good situations", as Phillip termed
them&#8212;meaning sites for farms&#8212;on both sides of the
river. As they moved along its banks, wild ducks were seen in
great numbers on the water, but they were too shy to give anyone
a shot at them. In the afternoon, they came upon a creek which
they found too deep to cross, and were therefore obliged to leave
the river in order to pass round the head of the creek; when they
had done so, "they found themselves on the borders of a river not
more than eighty feet wide", with low banks covered with brush.
The land rose so much on their right that they could not see more
than a hundred yards about them, and what they did see was not
pleasant to look upon, being mostly a poor stony soil. The
country through which they were moving was not by any means easy
walking for men carrying their own provisions, so that they did
not object to halt at four o'clock and make their fires for the
night.</p>
<p>On the third day they continued following up the creek, which
had now dwindled into a good-sized ditch, until they reached the
head of it, where they were able to cross over. They then struck
for the north-west in order to get to the river again; but they
were soon stopped by a deep gully. On ascending a hill to their
left, they saw the country open towards the west, and thought
they could distinguish Richmond Hill&#8212;the southern extremity
of the range&#8212;apparently about thirteen miles distant. To
the little hill on which they stood Phillip gave the name of
"Tench's Prospect Hill", that officer having then seen Richmond
Hill from it for the first time. Here they seem to have found
themselves in a difficulty, not knowing in what direction they
should proceed. At last they determined to return to the point at
which they had made the river the day before, and then to trace
it westward until they had got opposite Richmond Hill. So they
trudged back again to the head of the creek which they had
crossed at noon; and when they had reached it they thought they
had taken quite enough exercise for that day, and accordingly sat
down to tea round their camp-fires.</p>
<p>They did not make a very early start next morning, as it was
half-past seven when they crossed the creek. They then had some
easy walking through a country full of timber and pleasing to the
eye, but with a poor soil covered all over with stones. The next
thing they came to was a swamp, where they had a little
duck-shooting before they crossed it; after which they had no
difficulty in reaching that part of the river where they had
turned off from it on the second day of their journey. Thus they
had not much to congratulate themselves upon for their four days'
exertions. At this point, however, fortune befriended them in the
shape of an old native, whom they saw paddling his own canoe in
the river. They made their two natives coo-ee to him and invite
him to come over, which he did without any hesitation, happening
to know one of them. The stranger followed the explorers up the
river in his boat; but as soon as he saw that they did not know
how to save themselves unnecessary fatigue in walking, he was
kind enough to leave it at once and take the lead, quickly
bringing them into a path made by the natives along the river.
Here they moved along easily; and after they had camped for the
night they were joined by another native with a lively little
boy, who soon became friendly with them, intimating their
intention to stay, though they had left their families on the
opposite bank of the river. In return for a biscuit, the old man
who had acted as a guide gave an exhibition of his agility in
climbing a tree&#8212;the finest exhibition of the kind which
Phillip had yet seen.</p>
<p>On resuming the journey next day, the party continued to
follow the natives' path along the bank until they came to
another creek&#8212;too wide to be crossed by cutting down a
tree, and too deep to be forded. They had no choice, therefore,
but to follow its windings until they supposed themselves at the
head of it, and then they made for the river again. But they had
not gone far before they found they had only rounded a small
branch of the creek; so that they had to follow up the principal
branch of it&#8212;a task which occupied them for the rest of the
day and gave them infinite labour to do it. In the afternoon they
found it divide again into two branches, either of which might
have been crossed on a tree; but by this time they were all worn
out with fatigue, and therefore decided to take
rest&#8212;especially as it threatened to rain heavily and they
had no tent.</p>
<p>Here the two natives, who had been grumbling a good deal
during the last day or two, began to grumble in a still louder
key. One of them talked pathetically about his absent wife and
child; while the other, when he saw the rain coming, reminded
Phillip that there were good houses at Sydney and Rose Hill, but
none there; no fish and no melon. They would not have felt any
remorse in leaving the party had they not been afraid to return
by themselves, knowing the danger of hostile spears. They had
joined the expedition in the belief that it was a hunting
excursion, got up for the purpose of shooting ducks and
patagorangs; but when they saw that Phillip did not stop at the
places where good sport might have been had, they began to wonder
why he had left Rose Hill, and pressed him to return. The two
natives were not the only members of the party who were
dissatisfied with the results of the expedition. It was clear to
all of them that their chance of exploring the Blue Mountains was
a very poor one, seeing that they could not do a day's journey
without being stopped by a creek or a gully, compelling them to
go round it, and thus bringing them back to the place from which
they started. Finding that the next two days would be taken up in
getting to the opposite side of a creek not one hundred feet
wide, Phillip determined to return at once to Rose Hill, sixteen
miles from their camp. The next morning they started on their
homeward journey and reached the settlement in the afternoon.</p>
<p>During this excursion they had a good opportunity for
observing the singular precautions adopted by the natives when
meeting each other unexpectedly in the bush; and as it was
probably owing to neglect of similar precautions on the part of
Europeans that many of the unfortunate collections took place
with the natives, it is worth while to give Phillip's account of
them. Soon after their camp-fires were lighted on the first
evening they were out, the voice of a native calling his dog was
heard in the bush; and as their natives wished to interview him,
they coo-eed, and were answered by him. As his voice grew nearer,
they desired the party to lie down and keep silence. They then
advanced a little from their camp; but as the stranger approached
they retreated, and as they advanced he was equally cautious.
Meanwhile a light was seen moving towards them; they went forward
to meet it, and on coming up to the bearer of it a conversation,
at a respectful distance, took place between the parties. The
fire&#8212;a piece of lighted bark from the tea-tree&#8212;was
carried by a little boy who was made to walk in front, so that
the man behind could see if the others were armed or not, while
he kept himself behind the trees. When the friendly natives came
up to him they told the boy their names and that of the tribe to
which they belonged; the boy in return giving similar information
on his side. The stranger then making his appearance, they gave
him the names of the party, who were still at the camp-fire. On
Phillip's approach the boy ran away but the man stood his ground,
evidently not much at ease when he saw four or five white men
near him&#8212;though none of them had arms in his hands. They
were all introduced to the stranger by name, <a href="#note-176"
name="noteref-176" id="noteref-176">{22}</a> and invited him to
come to their fire, some fifty yards off; but he declined to do
so on the plea that he had left his family behind him.</p>
<p>After the discovery of the Nepean in June, 1789, a question
had arisen among the explorers whether that river and the
Hawkesbury were really separate streams, or whether one was
merely an affluent of the other. In order to settle the matter,
Tench and Dawes&#8212;who seem to have interested themselves
greatly in the work of exploration&#8212;made two excursions, one
in August, 1790, which proved fruitless so far as this question
was concerned; and the other in May, 1791. <a href="#note-177"
name="noteref-177" id="noteref-177">{23}</a> The two officers,
accompanied by two soldiers, started from Rose Hill, intending to
make for that part of the river opposite Richmond Hill at which
Phillip's party had arrived. The journey resulted in their
ascertaining that the two rivers were in reality but one.
<a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178" id="noteref-178">{24}</a>
Tench's narrative of this expedition is distinguished by a
sympathetic expression of his gratitude towards certain natives
whom they met on their arrival at Richmond Hill. Finding it
necessary to cross the river at that place, they were obliged to
seek their assistance; and so far from taking advantage of
helpless strangers, they cheerfully helped them out of their
difficulty. After the party had been ferried across the river,
the natives brought over the knapsacks and guns which had been
left behind, and delivered them to their owners without making
any attempt to seize or even handle them:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>During this long trial of their patience and
courtesy, in the latter part of which I was entirely in their
power from their having possession of our arms, they had
manifested no ungenerous sign of taking advantage of the
helplessness and dependence of our situation, no rude curiosity
to pry into the packages with which they were entrusted, and no
sordid desire to possess the contents of them; although among
them were articles exposed to view of which it afterwards
appeared they knew the use and longed for the benefit. Let the
banks of those rivers "known to song"; let him whose travels have
lain among polished nations, produce me a brighter example of
disinterested urbanity than was shown by these denizens of a
barbarous clime to a set of destitute wanderers on the side of
the Hawkesbury.</blockquote>
<p>This is a well deserved tribute to the merits of the
aboriginal character; but it is not more emphatic than similar
expressions of opinion on the part of Tench's contemporaries. It
is well worthy of note that all who were at all qualified to form
an opinion&#8212;especially Phillip, Hunter, and Collins, as well
as Tench&#8212;seem to have formed a high opinion of the natives
they met with, and to have been animated by the kindliest
feelings towards them, notwithstanding their occasional outbreaks
of savagery. As to their mental capacity. Tench did not hesitate
to declare that "the natives of New South Wales possess a
considerable portion of that acumen, or sharpness of intellect,
which bespeaks genius." <a href="#note-179" name="noteref-179"
id="noteref-179">{25}</a></p>
<p>In following the course of Phillip's explorations&#8212;which
are not always easily made out from the only records of them that
have come down to us&#8212;the reader will find considerable
assistance in a chart of the country constructed by Lieutenant
Dawes, bearing date March, 1791. It will be seen that the whole
extent of the country of which Phillip and his contemporaries had
acquired any knowledge lay between Botany Bay and Broken Bay, and
was practically bounded to the west by the rivers Hawkesbury and
Nepean. The country beyond the Nepean had been penetrated, in
December, 1789, as far as the hill marked Mount Twiss on the
chart; but the difficulties attending any attempt to explore in
that direction are amusingly indicated by the remarks which Dawes
has sprinkled over his map Beyond Mount Twiss another mountain
was seen, named Round Hill; and we are told that "of this hill
the Governor desired that the summit might be attained, if
possible; but on arriving at the western brow of it, a rugged
country between it and Round Hill appeared." At another part we
read that "all this country, as far as the eye can reach from
very high hills, appears very mountainous and covered with
trees." Statements of this kind may be taken to represent all
that was then known of the country between the rivers and the
Blue Mountains. But of Phillip's energy and determination to gain
a satisfactory knowledge of the country some idea may be formed
by the dotted lines marked on the chart, running from Rose Hill
and Prospect Hill to the banks of the Hawkesbury and the Nepean.
Dawes tells us that "the dotted lines show where it is intended
to travel in the course of the winter months ensuing, of May,
June, July, and August." From which it may be seen that plans had
been formed for a thorough examination of the country lying
between those boundaries.</p>

<br>
<p>Some portion of this work had been carried out in August,
1790; for it appears from the chart that an expedition had set
out from Prospect Hill on the 1st August in that year; had passed
beyond the "probable course of the river" (Nepean) to within a
short distance of Pyramid Hill to the south on the 3rd; had then
turned back towards the river, crossed it, and moved in a
north-east direction, where it came on the 5th to a "country of
coppices", and thence homewards to Prospect Hill. Another
expedition seems to have started from that point later in the
same month, travelling north-west till it came to "a lake of
muddy water about thirty feet wide, apparently deep; in flood it
rises twenty feet; the opposite bank rises beautifully to the
height of about fifty feet." Thence the party struck off towards
the Hawkesbury, passing through "swampy country" till it reached
the river at a point above Richmond Hill; then following along
the banks, where they found that "this bank is very sandy", and
again, "sandy, the opposite bank is the same"; turning off
towards home and passing through country described as "land
various; in some parts very good, in others indifferent"; further
on meeting with some better soil, "here the land in many places
is very good"; and finally reaching home on August 27. It was in
this way that the early settlers got to know the nature of the
country round about them.</p>
<p>The last effort at exploration made by Tench and Dawes was in
July, 1791, when they went in search of a large river supposed to
exist a few miles to the southward of Rose Hill. They did not
succeed in finding anything better than a salt-water creek
running into Botany Bay, and on its banks they passed a miserable
night from want of water to quench their thirst; for as they
believed that they were going to a river they "thought it
needless to march with full canteens." The most noticeable event
on this occasion was the extraordinary degree of cold experienced
on the road, when they were six miles south-west of Rose Hill.
Tench's description of the scene is of sufficient interest to
deserve quotation:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The sun arose in unclouded splendour, and presented
to our sight a novel and picturesque view; the contiguous country
as white as if covered with snow, contrasted with the foliage of
trees flourishing in the verdure of tropical luxuriance Even the
exhalation which steamed from the lake beneath contributed to
heighten the beauty of the scene. Nothing but demonstration could
have convinced me that so severe a degree of cold ever existed in
this low latitude. Drops of water on a tin-pot, not altogether
out of the influence of the fire, were frozen into solid ice in
less than twelve minutes. Part of a leg of kangaroo, which we had
roasted for supper, was frozen quite hard, all the juices of it
being converted into ice. On those ponds which were near the
surface of the earth, the covering of ice was very thick; but on
those which were lower down, it was found to be less so in
proportion to their depression; and wherever the water was twelve
feet below the surface (which happened to be the case close to
us), it was uncongealed. <a href="#note-180" name="noteref-180"
id="noteref-180">{26}</a></blockquote>
<p>Such is the history of exploration during Phillip's time. The
narrative of his little excursions may provoke a smile at the
present day, when contrasted with the exploits of later explorers
who succeeded in crossing the continent from north to south and
from east to west, in face of all the difficulties and dangers
presented by mountain ranges, sandy deserts, flooded rivers, and
sometimes hostile savages. There is no more comparison between
Phillip's achievements and theirs, in one sense, than there is
between a harbour excursion and an ocean voyage. But a little
consideration will be enough to show that any such conclusion
would be unjust to the founder of the colony. If his performances
will not bear comparison with those of his more distinguished
successors in the same fields it is because the difficulties in
his path were, after all, as great in their way as any that
others had to contend with. We have only to realise the position
in which he was placed in order to see that, under the conditions
he had to contend against, it was scarcely possible that the work
of exploration could be attended with any marked success. The
only means by which it could be accomplished at that time was by
boats; for the moment that an exploring party set out to face the
bush their progress was checked at every step. They took no
horses either to ride or to carry provisions; consequently every
man in the party had to walk, carrying his own supplies as well
as his arms and ammunition; and as no one could possibly carry
more than enough to supply him for eight or ten days, the limits
of their exploring powers were very soon reached. If we add to
all this the extreme fatigue of travelling in such a manner,
without any means of fording a river or even a creek, without
even a tent to sleep in at night, and with the constant
apprehension of an attack from the natives, it will be seen that
exploration under such circumstances was all but hopeless.</p>
<p>But for the discovery of the Hawkesbury, it would hardly have
been possible to have made any way at all into the surrounding
country. It was almost equivalent to the making of a road.
Followed as it was shortly afterwards by the discovery of the
Nepean, it enabled Phillip to gain some insight into the
character of the country inland. Had the work of exploration been
understood in his days, the advantage thus gained might certainly
have been turned to better account. A dep&#244;t, for instance,
might have been established at the foot of Richmond Hill, which
would then have become a basis for further operations; and from
that point excursions might have been made to the north-west with
much less difficulty than when starting from Rose Hill. But
neither Phillip nor any of his officers had yet learned the art
of making their way through an unknown country, such as that
which lay around them. They could not go five miles into the bush
without running the risk of losing themselves. When they went on
an overland expedition, one man of the party was told off to
count his paces in order that they might have some idea as to
where they were and how far they had travelled; a small pocket
compass being the only instrument they had to guide them.
Exploring in that fashion was mere groping in the dark. The
explanatory notes made by Lieutenant Dawes on his map&#8212;the
first exploring map constructed in the colony&#8212;show how much
the land lay in darkness before him, with here and there a ray of
light breaking through it. It was a matter of common occurrence
for men to lose themselves in the bush, even in the neighbourhood
of Sydney Cove and within sight of the harbour; so much so that
the annual returns of casualties included a column under the
heading&#8212;"Lost in the Bush."</p>
<p>The work actually accomplished by Phillip in this direction
during his five years of office was nevertheless of the highest
importance. Apart from the elaborate surveys of Botany Bay, Port
Jackson, and Broken Bay, which were made by Captain Hunter under
his direction&#8212;his exploration of the Hawkesbury and of the
country which lay between it and Sydney Cove not only rescued the
settlement from the peril of ultimate failure, but it may be said
to have laid the foundation of all subsequent discoveries. No one
can read the journals of Australian explorers without observing
how much they were all indebted to the labours of those who had
successively gone before them. If Oxley paved the way for
Cunningham, Sturt, and Mitchell, they in their turn acted as
unseen guides to Eyre and Grey, who again inspired Leichhardt,
Burke, Stuart, and others with the hope of penetrating the
continent from sea to sea. But Oxley, with whom the history of
scientific exploration may be said to have begun, could not have
accomplished what he did if Lawson, Blaxland, and Wentworth had
not succeeded in finding a way for him over the Blue Mountains
four years before he started from Bathurst Plains to trace the
Macquarie and the Lachlan. Nor again could they have performed
that task had it not been for the exertions of those who went
before them in opening up the country to the banks of the Nepean
and the Hawkesbury. Even the men who absolutely failed in their
attempts to cross the mountains&#8212;Bass, Barrallier, and
Caley, to say nothing of those who preceded them&#8212;may be
said to have materially assisted Lawson and his party in solving
the problem which had defied their own painful efforts. It was in
this spirit that Forrest, who crossed from Perth to Adelaide
round the Great Australian Bight, acknowledged that "the records
of Eyre's expedition were of the greatest service to me, by at
least enabling me to guard against a repetition of the terrible
sufferings he endured." <a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181"

La P&#233;rouse thought that "the Bay of Avatscha (in Kamschatka)
is certainly the finest, safest, and most commodious that is
possible to be found in any part of the globe." He
added:&#8212;"Its entrance is narrow, and ships would be obliged
to pass under the guns of the forts that might be erected. The
bottom is mud, and excellent holding ground. Two spacious
harbours, one on the east and the other on the west, are capable
of receiving the whole of the French and English navies." It was
in September, 1787, that the Boussole and the Astrolabe were
lying in the bay of Avatscha; and on the 26th January of the
following year they dropped anchor in Botany Bay. La P&#233;rouse
remained there till the 10th of March, but never felt sufficient
interest in Port Jackson to visit it, although he heard many
descriptions of it from Lieutenant King and the other English
officers whom he met while at Botany Bay.</p>

There is another Shell Cove in Middle Harbour, between Hunter's
Kay and the Spit; and a third between Mossman's Bay (formerly
called Great Sirius Cove) and Neutral Bay, so named by Phillip
when he directed that all foreign ships entering the harbour
should anchor there. "The Governor, thinking it probable that
foreign ships might again visit this coast, and perhaps run into
this harbour for the purpose of procuring refreshments, directed
Mr. Blackburn to survey a large bay on the North Shore,
contiguous to this cove; and a sufficient depth of water being
found, his excellency inserted in the Port Orders that all
foreign ships coming into this harbour should anchor in this bay,
which he named Neutral Bay, bringing Rock Island to bear S.S.E.,
and the hospital on the west side of Sydney Cove to bear S.W. by

"On the coast fish makes a considerable part of their food, but
when that cannot be had, it seems hardly possible that, with
their spears, the only missile weapon yet observed among them,
they should be able to procure any kind of animal
food."&#8212;Phillip's Voyage, p. 102.<br>
<br>
"The sea-coast, we have every reason at present to believe, is
the only part of this country which is inhabited by the human
race; the land seems to afford them but a very scanty
subsistence."&#8212;Hunter, p. 65.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Vancouver, not finding any fish-bones or
oyster-shells about the native camps at King George's Sound,
concluded that the coast natives went inland for
food.&#8212;Voyage, October, 1791.<br>
<br>
The difficulty suggested by such casual observations as
Vancouver's about the oysters is explained by the following
passage from Eyre's Journals, referring to the oyster-beds he met
with at Streaky Bay:&#8212;"Many drays might easily be loaded,
one after the other, from these oyster-beds. The natives of the
district do not appear to eat them, for I never could find a
single shell at any of their encampments. It is difficult to
account for the taste or prejudice of the native which guides him
in his selection or rejection of particular kinds of food. What
is eaten readily by the natives in one part of Australia is left
untouched by them in another; thus the oyster is eaten at Sydney,
and I believe at King George's Sound, but not at Streaky Bay. The
unio or fresh-water muscle is eaten in great numbers by all the
natives of New South Wales and South Australia, but Captain Grey
found that a Perth native, who accompanied him on one of his
expeditions, would not touch this kind of food even when almost
starving. Snakes are eaten by some tribes, but not by others; and
so with many other kinds of food which they make use
of."&#8212;Journals, vol. i, p. 195.<br>

"No part of the country is so utterly worthless as not to have
attractions sufficient occasionally to tempt the wandering savage
into its recesses In the arid, barren, naked plains of the north,
with not a shrub to shelter him from the heat, not a stick to
burn for his fire (except what he carried with him), the native
is found, and where, as far as I could ascertain, the whole
country around appeared equally devoid of either animal or
vegetable life. In other cases, the very regions which, in the
eyes of the European, are most barren and worthless, are to the
native the most valuable and productive. Such are dense brushes
or sandy tracts of country covered with shrubs, for here the
wallabie, the opossum, the kangaroo rat, the bandicoot, leipoa,
snakes, lizards, iguanas, and many other animals, reptiles,
birds, &amp;c, abound; whilst the kangaroo, the emu, and the
native dog are found upon their borders, or in the vicinity of
those small grassy plains which are occasionally met with amidst
the closest brushes."&#8212;Eyre, Journals, p. 351.</p>

"The month of November commenced with the establishment of a
settlement at the head of the harbour. On the 2nd, his excellency
the Governor went up to the Crescent with the Surveyor-General,
two officers, and a small party of marines, to choose the spot,
and to mark out the ground for a redoubt and other necessary
buildings; and two days after a party of ten convicts, being
chiefly people who understood the business of cultivation, were
sent up to him, and a spot upon a rising ground, which his
excellency named Rose Hill, in compliment to G. Rose, Esq., one
of the Secretaries of the Treasury, was ordered to be cleared for
the first habitations. The soil at this spot was of a stiff
clayey nature, free from that rock which everywhere covered the
surface of Sydney Cove, well clothed with timber, and
unobstructed by underwood."&#8212;Collins, p. 45.</p>

He had luckily brought out with him from England a man-servant
who, according to Collins (p. 64), "joined to much agricultural
knowledge a perfect idea of the labour to be required from, and
that might be performed by, the convicts; and whose figure was
calculated to make the idle and the worthless shrink if he came
near them." This man was said to be the only free person the

Frequent reference is found in the Journals of subsequent
explorers to the native paths met with in the interior, and which
frequently proved of essential service in leading them to water.
Captain Sturt came upon the Darling River while following a track
made by the natives:&#8212;"As the path we had observed was
leading northerly, we took up that course, and had not proceeded
more than a mile upon it when we suddenly found ourselves on the
banks of a noble river."&#8212;Two Expeditions, p. 85. Eyre was
indebted to these paths on several occasions for water while
making his way among the sand-drifts along the Great Australian
Bight to King George's Sound.</p>

Hunter, p. 152; Captain Grey made an elaborate attempt to
introduce plants, seeds, and animals in this manner during his
expedition to the north-west coast in 1837. A large stock was
collected by him in England, at Teneriffe, the Cape, and Timor.
On leaving Hanover Bay, where he had made a garden, he
wrote:&#8212;"I considered what a blessing to the country these
plants must eventually prove, if they should continue to thrive
as they had yet done; and as I called to mind how much
forethought and care their transportation had occasioned, I would
very gladly have passed a year or two of my life in watching over
them, and seeing them attain to a useful maturity. One large
pumpkin plant in particular claimed my notice. The tropical
warmth and rain, and the virgin soil in which it grew, had
imparted to it a rich luxuriance; it did not creep along the
ground, but its long shoots were spreading upwards amongst the
trees. The young cocoa-nuts grew humbly amidst the wild plants
and reeds&#8212;their worth unknown. Most of these plants I had
placed in the ground myself, and had watched their early
progress; now they must be left to their fate." Eleven Timor
ponies were turned out at the same place:&#8212;"Two good mares
which were among them might possibly be the means of giving a
very valuable race of horses to this country. The companions of
our weary wanderings were turned loose,&#8212;a new race upon the
land; and, as we trusted, to become the progenitors of a numerous
herd."&#8212;Journals, p. 2.36. Planting vegetables on the
islands they called at was a common practice among the whalers;

Captain Grey came upon similar tracks while exploring in the
north-west, between Hanover Bay and the river Glenelg:&#8212;"I
have to record the remarkable fact of the existence in these
parts of a large quadruped with a divided hoof. This animal I
have never seen, but twice came upon its traces. On one occasion
I followed its track for above a mile and a half, and at last
altogether lost it in rocky ground. The foot-marks exceeded in
size those of a buffalo, and it was apparently much larger, for
where it had passed through brushwood, shrubs of considerable
size in its way had been broken down, and from the openings there
left I could form some comparative estimate of its bulk. These
tracks were first seen by a man who had joined me at the Cape,
and who had there been on the frontier during the Caffre war; he
told me that he had seen the <i>spur</i> of a buffalo, imagining
that they were here as plentiful as in Africa. I conceived at the
time that he had made some mistake, and paid no attention to him
until I afterwards twice saw the same traces
myself.&#8212;Journals, p. 242.</p>

<h3>1.16 EXPLORATION BY SEA. <small>[1788-92]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> course of events at sea during Phillip's
time is so much a matter of historical interest that, although
not immediately connected with his own work, it is well to bear
it in mind, if only for the purpose of obtaining a connected view
of the progress of exploration and discovery.</p>
<p>In February, 1788, Lieutenant Ball, of the Supply, while on
his way to Norfolk Island, discovered an island which he named
Lord Howe Island. On his voyage to Batavia and back in 1790 he
sailed round New Holland, and was the first navigator who is
known to have done so. <a href="#note-182" name="noteref-182" id=
"noteref-182">{1}</a></p>
<p>In July, 1789, Captain Cox of the brig Mercury discovered a
bay in the south coast of Van Diemen's Land, called Cox Bight;
and also another bay, known as Oyster Bay, on the inner side of
Maria's Island. <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183">{2}</a></p>
<p>Towards the end of the year 1791, Lieutenant McCluer, of the
Bombay marine, sighted Arnhem's Land and sailed along the coast,
westward, till he reached Cape Van Diemen. <a href="#note-183">{2}</a></p>
<p>Two of the transports which arrived in Port Jackson in August,
1791, brought with them intelligence of discoveries made during
their passage. The ship Atlantic, on the evening before her
arrival, ran into a harbour on the coast which the naval agent on
board named Jervis Bay. The Matilda anchored in a bay of one of
Schouten's Islands, off the east coast of Van Diemen's Land,
which the master named Matilda Bay. <a href="#note-184" name=
"noteref-184" id="noteref-184">{3}</a></p>
<p>On the 21st August, 1788, Lieutenant Bligh, then in command of
the Bounty, bound to the Society Islands on the bread-fruit
mission, anchored in Adventure Bay, on the east coast of Van
Diemen's Land, and remained there a fortnight, taking in wood and
water, and endeavouring to obtain some knowledge of the country
and its native population. He had seen the bay on a former
occasion, when sailing with Captain Cook in the Resolution and
Discovery, in January, 1777; but he found no sign of any European
vessels having been there since their visit. During his stay a
number of whales made their appearance in the bay, for several
days together. He sailed away from it on the 4th September, after
having made a very careful plantation of vegetables, grain, and
fruit-trees.</p>
<p>Early in May, 1789, Bligh began that portion of his celebrated
voyage in the Bounty's launch which took him along the north-east
coast of New Holland. On the 27th&#8212;a month after he had been
put over the ship's side by the mutineers&#8212;he recorded that
"we passed much driftwood this fore-noon, and saw many birds; I,
therefore, did not hesitate to pronounce that we were near the
reefs of New Holland",&#8212;known to him as the reefs on which
the Endeavour struck in 1770. His reason for making the coast so
far to the south was that he never doubted of numerous openings
in the reef, through which he could have access to the shore. On
the following day, "as we advanced within the reefs, the coast
began to show itself very distinctly, in a variety of high and
low land." Selecting one or two islands before him for a
resting-place, he "found a bay and a fine sandy point to land
at"; <a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185" id=
"noteref-185">{4}</a> and there they remained for two days,
recruiting themselves with oysters, wild fruit, and fresh water.
Keeping on his course till he had doubled Cape York, on the 3rd
of June he arrived at an island which he "found was only a rock
where boobies resort, for which reason I called it Booby Island.
Here terminated the rocks and shoals of the north part of New
Holland"; and he adds:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have little doubt but that the opening, which I
named the Bay of Islands, is Endeavour Straits; and that our
track was to the northward of Prince of Wales's Isles. <a href=
"#note-186" name="noteref-186" id=
"noteref-186">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>There is some interest in the passage in which Cook referred
to this "opening", on the 23rd August, 1770:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>To this channel, or passage, I have given the name of
the ship, and called it Endeavour Streights.</blockquote>
<p>Cook, it seems, had not then read Dalrymple's Account of the
Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean previous to 1764,
published in 1767&#8212;the year before the Endeavour
sailed&#8212;in which he showed that Torres had sailed through
the Straits in 1606.</p>
<p>When the news of Bligh's voyage reached the settlement at
Sydney Cove, it inspired some of the more daring convicts with
fresh hopes of escaping from their prison. <a href="#note-187"
name="noteref-187" id="noteref-187">{6}</a> The most adventurous
of the many attempts made for this purpose was that of a man
named William Bryant, who, accompanied by his wife and two
children and seven men, sailed away from the port in a cutter
which had been placed under his charge for fishing purposes. This
event took place on the night of the 28th March, 1791. Bryant and
two or three of the men with him had some knowledge of navigation
as well as the management of a boat; and having obtained a
compass, quadrant, and chart from the master of a Dutch vessel
lying in the harbour, they steered for Timor. Tench obtained the
following account from one of them:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>They coasted the shore of New Holland, putting
occasionally into different harbours which they found in going
along. One of these harbours, in the latitude of 30&#176; south,
<a href="#note-188" name="noteref-188" id="noteref-188">{7}</a>
they described to be of superior excellence and capacity. Here
they hauled their bark ashore, paid her seams with tallow, and
repaired her. But it was with difficulty they could keep off the
attacks of the Indians. These people continued to harass them so
much that they quitted the mainland and retreated to a small
island in the harbour, where they completed their design. Between
the latitude of 26&#176; and 27&#176;, they were driven by a
current thirty leagues from the shore among some islands, where
they found plenty of large turtles. Soon after they closed again
with the continent, where the boat got entangled with the surf
and was driven on shore, and they had all well nigh perished.
They passed through the Straits of Endeavour, and beyond the Gulf
of Carpentaria found a large fresh-water river which they
entered, and filled from it their empty casks.<br>
<br>
Until they reached the Gulf, they saw no natives or canoes
differing from those about Port Jackson; but now they were chased
by large canoes, fitted with sails and lighting-stages, and
capable of holding thirty men each. They escaped by dint of
rowing to windward. On the 5th of June, 1791, they reached Timor.
<a href="#note-189" name="noteref-189" id=
"noteref-189">{8}</a></blockquote>
<p>Here they were received with kindness by the Dutch, until the
arrival of Captain Edwards, of H.M.S. Pandora, at Timor, led to
their detection, when they were immediately arrested, lodged in
prison, and afterwards handed over to him to be conveyed to
England. Tench notices, as a peculiar coincidence, that the woman
and one of the men were in the same ship as himself when the
First Fleet sailed for Botany Bay; and that on the arrival of
H.M.S. Gorgon, in which he was a passenger, at the Cape of Good
Hope in March, 1792, they were put on board that ship to be taken
back to England for trial.</p>
<p>On the wreck of the Pandora during her voyage in search of the
Bounty mutineers, the officers and crew who had escaped from the
wreck, to the number of ninety-two, with ten prisoners, made a
voyage of eleven hundred miles in four of the ship's boats, from
the reef on which the ship struck along the northern coast of New
South Wales to Coepang. The wreck took place on the 28th August,
1791, and the boats reached Batavia on the 16th September.
<a href="#note-190" name="noteref-190" id=

<p>The expedition, comprising the ships Recherche and Esperance,
sent out by the French Government under the Command of
Rear-Admiral Bruni d'Entrecasteaux and Captain Huon de
Kermad&#233;c, for the purpose of ascertaining the fate of La
P&#233;rouse, anchored in Storm Bay on the 21st April, 1792; and
during their stay there, which lasted until the 16th of May, the
Frenchmen surveyed and named various places on the coast,
including d'Entrecasteaux Channel, the entrance to the rivers
Huon and Derwent, Bruni Island, Port Esperance, and Recherche
Bay&#8212;names which have since retained their places on the
map.</p>
<p>It was in September, 1791, while Phillip was exploring the
country around Rose Hill, that Captain Vancouver sighted the
south-west coast of New Holland and discovered King George's
Sound. He remained there for some weeks; and after having
explored the Sound and done full justice to the oysters, he
sailed away to the east&#8212;thus losing the opportunity of
making those discoveries which afterwards moved the ambitious
spirit of Flinders. The dangerous nature of the navigation along
the coast, added to want of time for prosecuting the work of
discovery in these seas. are the reasons given by Vancouver for
abandoning it at the very time when it seemed to promise good
results for his labour. It was in much the same way that Captain
Furneaux, after his separation from Captain Cook in 1773,
contented himself with a few days' sailing along the coast of Van
Diemen's Land from Adventure Bay, and then bore away to New
Zealand&#8212;leaving it to Bass to discover the straits which
have made his name immortal. "It is my opinion", said Furneaux,
"that there is no straits between New Holland and Van Diemen's
Land, but a very deep bay"; and yet he had left Adventure Bay
only four days before, "intending to coast it up along shore,
till we should fall in with the land seen by Captain Cook, and
discover whether Van Diemen's Land joins with New Holland." A
still more singular opinion was left on record by Captain Cook
after he had passed some days in Adventure Bay, on his third
voyage in January, 1777. As if he felt it necessary to offer some
reason for not having made further explorations while on the
coast, he wrote;&#8212;"Van Diemen's Land has been twice visited
before"; (by Tasman and Furneaux). <a href="#note-191" name=
"noteref-191" id="noteref-191">{10}</a> "I need hardly say that
it is the southern point of New Holland." When he sighted Point
Hicks, in 1770, he was in doubt as to whether Van Diemen's Land
formed part of New Holland or not, and accordingly said:&#8212;"I
cannot determine whether it joins to Van Diemen's Land or not."
Between that date and 1777 he seems to have made up his mind on
the point, relying on the report made by Furneaux.</p>
<p>These are curious instances of the indifference felt with
respect to the exploration of the coast of New Holland. The
discovery of a north-west passage, or a supposed continent
towards the South Pole, was looked upon as the only object that
could seriously deserve attention on the part of the Governments
as well as the great geographers of the time. In 1745, an Act of
Parliament offered a reward of &#163;20,000 for the discovery of
a passage from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific through
Hudson's Bay. When it became known that no such passage existed,
another Act, passed in 1776, offered the same reward for the
discovery "of any northern passage for vessels by sea between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans". Cook's second voyage was made for
the purpose of determining "whether the unexplored part of the
Southern hemisphere be only an immense mass of water, or contain
another continent"&#8212;a question of speculative geography,
which, as he states in his introduction, "had long engaged the
attention, not only of learned men, but of most of the maritime
powers of Europe." In pursuit of this object, he sailed south
among the icebergs with as much prospect of discovering another
continent as Frobisher had of finding the "golde mynes" he was
sent to search for in the northern seas. Judging from this
instance, speculative geography in the days of George the Third
seems to have been no wiser than speculative gold-mining in the
days of Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>It seems to have been assumed by the geographers, after the
publication of Cook's Second Voyage, that the question whether
Van Diemen's Land formed part of New Holland or not had been
satisfactorily settled by Captain Furneaux. The introduction to
the account of that voyage, published in 1784, after quoting
Cook's statement that he could not determine the question,
proceeds to say:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>But what was thus left undetermined by the operations
of his first voyage, was, in the course of his second, soon
cleared up; Captain Furneaux, in the Adventure, having explored
Van Diemen's Land from its southern point along the east coast,
far beyond Tasman's station, and on to the latitude 38&#176;,
where Captain Cook's examination of it in 1770 had
commenced.</blockquote>
<p>This statement, however, is not supported by Furneaux's
account of his voyage. He tells us that he discontinued his
northerly course at latitude 39&#176; and steered for New
Zealand, by doing which he just missed the discovery of the
straits.</p>
<blockquote>In the latitude 40&#176; 50', the land trends away to
the westward, which I believe forms a deep bay, as we saw from
the deck several smokes arising aback of the islands that lay
before it, when we could not see the least signs of land from the
mast-head.</blockquote>
<p>Thus, while Furneaux was making up his mind that "there is no
straits between Van Diemen's Land and New Holland, but a very
deep bay", the straits in question lay right before him. Had he
been really intent on settling the matter, he could have done it
in a few days. It was an easier thing, no doubt, to write "there
is no straits between New Holland and Van Diemen's Land", than to
sail along the coast and prove it. But if it is difficult to
understand how a professional explorer could so easily satisfy
himself on such a point, it is not less surprising to find the
geographers of the day readily accepting such a statement as a
satisfactory settlement of the question. How little attention was
devoted to the matter may be seen from another singular assertion
in the introduction to Cook's Third Voyage, published in
1784:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It is no longer a doubt that we have now a full
knowledge of the whole circumference of this vast body of land,
this fifth part of the world.</blockquote>
<p>Of the whole circumference in question, one portion only could
be said to have been at all known&#8212;the strip of coastline
explored by Cook. So far as the rest of it was concerned, the
knowledge possessed in his day was confined to the very meagre
information obtained from Dampier and the Dutch navigators who
had touched at different points of the coast&#8212;north,
north-west, and south. But they did not pretend to give the world
anything like a full knowledge of the country they had visited.
Even Dampier's narrative, precise as it is when compared with the
accounts left by the Dutchmen, is more like the composition of a
traveller seeking to gratify the curiosity of his readers with
strange tales, than the journal of an explorer devoted to
geographical discovery. He seems to be largely responsible for
the indifference with which the exploration of New Holland was
regarded in Europe, even down to the days of Captain Cook. The
picture he had drawn of the country was discouraging in the
extreme; and yet his examination of the north-west coast was but
a superficial one at best, extending over a very limited time and
confined within a narrow range of observation. The prevalence of
an unfavourable opinion with respect to the character of the
country will probably account for the neglect of its exploration.
If it had been regarded as a matter of any importance,
instructions would have been given to Captain Cook, or to some of
his contemporaries, to explore those portions of the coast-line
which had not been visited by the Dutch. But no such instructions
were given; and, as it turned out, the exploration of the eastern
coast was rather a matter of accident than design. Before he
sailed in the Endeavour, he was instructed to explore New Zealand
after the astronomical observations at Otaheite were completed,
and then to return to England by such route as he should think
proper. <a href="#note-192" name="noteref-192" id=
"noteref-192">{11}</a> When he had completed the examination of
the islands, he had to determine which of the three routes before
him he should take on his voyage home.</p>
<blockquote>I had myself a strong desire to return by Cape Horn,
because that would have enabled me finally to determine whether
there is or is not a southern continent; but against this it was
a sufficient objection that we must have kept in a high southern
latitude in the very depth of winter, with a vessel which was not
thought sufficient for the undertaking; and the same reason was
urged against our proceeding directly for the Cape of Good Hope
with still more force, because no discovery of moment could be
hoped for in that rout; it was therefore resolved that we should
return by the East Indies, and that with this view we should,
upon leaving the coast, steer westward, till we should fall in
with the east coast of New Holland, and then follow the direction
of that coast to the northward till we should arrive at its
northern extremity; but if that should be found impracticable, it
was further resolved that we should endeavour to fall in with the
land, or islands, said to have been discovered by Quiros.

Voyage towards the South Pole, general introduction, p. xx. Cook
passed nearly six months&#8212;from the 6th October, 1769, to the
31st March, 1770&#8212;in exploring the coasts of New Zealand,
during which he sailed round them and ascertained the existence
of the islands it comprises. But he was only four months on the
coast of New South Wales, nearly two of which were passed in the
Endeavour River; so that his available time for exploration was
limited to two months&#8212;one-third of the time devoted to New
Zealand. The reason for his careful examination of that country
may be found in "a favourite opinion amongst geographers", since
Tasman's time, that New Zealand was part of a southern continent.
The existence of such a continent was contended for by de Brosses
and Dalrymple on the ground that the ascertained body of land in
the northern hemisphere required a similar extent of it in the
southern, in order to balance the globe.</p>

<h3>1.17 PHILLIP AND HIS STAFF. <small>[1787-92]</small></h3>
<p align="right"><a href="#note-194" name="noteref-194" id=

<p><small>IT</small> is not possible to estimate Phillip's
position in the colony accurately without some reference to the
principal members of the establishment of which he was the head.
Each of these men bore an active part in carrying on the work
with which the Governor was entrusted, and the services rendered
by them in their several capacities deserve some distinct
recognition. Two of them. Hunter and King, succeeded him in the
government of the colony, and a third, Collins, became
Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land. In their cases as well
as in his, it is necessary, in order to understand the course of
events, to ascertain as far as possible the character of the
individual as well as the nature and extent of his work; but to
do this requires us to trace each man's career from the
beginning, as we find it recorded in the annals of the time. So
far as the principal figures on the stage are concerned, there is
not much difficulty in doing so, owing in a great measure to the
fact that they left behind them a good deal of useful material
for the purpose in the shape of their own journals. They stand
out distinctly enough. That Phillip was, on the whole, fortunate
in the selection of colleagues made for him in England may be
admitted, notwithstanding the complaints he had occasionally to
make. With one exception&#8212;that of the commanding officer of
the marines&#8212;they appear to have been all more or less
active, if not enthusiastic, in the performance of their duties.
He had a personal friend as well as an efficient officer in
Lieutenant King of the Sirius, whose services at Norfolk Island
proved of no little value to him. On the other hand, he was
painfully hampered by the want of cordiality shown by Major Ross;
while his difficulties were often aggravated by the fact that the
head of the judicial department was by no means qualified for the
post in which he found himself installed. With these exceptions,
Phillip seems to have had little reason to find fault with his
officers. Had fortune so far favoured him as to secure a zealous
co-operation on the part of the military, and a wise as well as a
humane administration of justice, many obstacles would have been
removed from his path, while his work would have been made
comparatively easy.</p>
<p>First on the list stands Captain Hunter of the Sirius, whose
Historical Journal forms a valuable contribution to the history
of the colony. The work affords good evidence of an intelligent
if not of a highly cultivated mind, and it shows in a very
conspicuous manner the great interest he felt in the foundation
of the colony. Recollecting that naval officers in his day were
not usually men of much educational attainments. Hunter's book
deserves to be regarded as a highly creditable performance. The
strictly nautical details to which he could hardly avoid giving a
prominent place in its pages, show him to have been an
accomplished as well as a careful seaman, although he was
unfortunate enough to lose the Sirius at the very time when her
services were of vital importance to the starving population of
Sydney Cove. <a href="#note-195" name="noteref-195" id=
"noteref-195">{2}</a> But his mind was large enough for something
more than navigation; and although he does not enter into any
expression of his personal views or feelings on the subject, his
reader soon begins to see that the captain of the Sirius had his
heart in the work in which he was engaged. He was an active as
well as a cordial colleague of Phillip in every thing that could
tend to promote the interest of the settlement. Difficulties did
not keep him idle. A few days after his arrival with the
transports in Port Jackson, he set off with a six-oared boat and
a smaller one, for the purpose of making as good a survey of the
harbour as circumstances would admit. His tracings of the survey,
as well as his chart of the coast between Botany Bay and Broken
Bay, published at page 101 of his quarto, remain to show how well
the work was done. The interest he took in the exploration of the
country inland led him to publish at the same time a "Map of all
those Parts of the Territory of New South Wales which have been
seen by any person belonging to the Settlement established at
Port Jackson", constructed by Lieutenant Dawes in March, 1791. As
the first of all our exploration maps, it has historical as well
as geographical interest, and deserves to be carefully studied by
those who would understand the history of Australian exploration
in its earliest stage. Another useful map, representing the
progress of the settlement, was drawn by Hunter in 1798, and
published by Collins in the second volume of his work, facing the
title-page. The original tracing contains a note in Hunter's
handwriting, informing us that "the red lines show the country
which has been lately walked over." The exploration of the
unknown interior interested him, apparently, quite as much as it
did Phillip, whom he accompanied on several expeditions. He was
one of the party which discovered the Hawkesbury River, and his
account of the journey is full of interest. It was on this
occasion that they met with the interesting little adventure with
the young native woman and her child, sketched by Hunter on the
spot, an engraving of which appears on his title-page. On this as
on other occasions he showed how warmly he seconded Phillip's
efforts to gain the good-will of the natives, by treating them
with kindness, especially when in distress.</p>
<p>The first flag-staff and look-out station at the South Head
were put up by Hunter at his own suggestion, at a time when every
eye in the settlement was anxiously turned in that direction in
the hope of seeing a ship from England with supplies. This was in
January, 1790, when the provisions in the public store were not
enough to last more than six months, even at half the usual
allowance.</p>
<blockquote>We all looked forward with hope for arrivals with a
relief; and that every assistance necessary for strangers might
be at hand, I offered, with a few men from the Sirius, to go down
to the south head of the harbour, there to build a look-out house
and erect a flag-staff upon the height, which might be seen from
the sea; and which might also communicate information of ships in
the offing to the Governor at Sydney Cove. The Governor approved
of my proposals. I went down with six men, and was accompanied by
Mr. White and Mr. Worgan, the surgeons of the settlement and
Sirius. We erected a flag-staff and lived in a tent for ten days,
in which time we compleated a tolerably good house. At the end of
ten days I was relieved by Mr. Bradley with a fresh party.
<a href="#note-196" name="noteref-196" id=
"noteref-196">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>During Phillip's residence in the colony. Hunter made a voyage
in the Sirius to the Cape of Good Hope to obtain further supplies
of provisions; sailing in September, 1788, and returning in May
of the following year. He concluded his account of the voyage
with a remark which shows the opinion he had formed with respect
to the existence of a strait between New Holland and Van Diemen's
Land&#8212;a matter which had been a subject of speculation for
many years among navigators.</p>
<blockquote>In passing (at a distance from the coast) between the
Islands of Schouten and Furneaux and Point Hicks&#8212;the former
being the northernmost of Captain Furneaux's observations here,
and the latter the southernmost part, which Captain Cook saw when
he sailed along the coast&#8212;there has been no land seen; and
from our having felt an easterly set of current, when the wind
was from that quarter (north-west), we had an uncommon large sea,
there is reason thence to believe that there is in that space
either a very deep gulf or a straight, which may separate Van
Diemen's Land from New Holland. <a href="#note-197" name=
"noteref-197" id="noteref-197">{4}</a></blockquote>
<p>The opinion then formed was afterwards confirmed by Bass's
voyage in the whaleboat. In December, 1797, when Hunter was
Governor of the colony, he supplied Bass with the boat and a crew
of volunteers from the men-of-war in port, for the purpose of
exploring the coast to the south and south-west. The results were
reported to the Secretary of State by Hunter in a despatch, in
which he said that Bass, when at Western Port,&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>found an open ocean westward, and by the mountainous
sea which rolled from that quarter, and no land discoverable in
that direction, we have much reason to conclude that there is an
open straight through, between the latitude 39&#176; and 40&#176;
south, a circumstance which, from many observations made upon
tides and currents thereabouts, I had long
conjectured.</blockquote>
<p>The existence of this strait was a subject of discussion in
Cook's time, but we have seen that Furneaux reported against it,
and his opinion apparently satisfied Cook. Hunter's observations
during the voyage with the First Fleet seem to have led him to a
different conclusion, in which he was confirmed on his subsequent
voyage from the Cape of Good Hope. Referring to the run up the
coast on the former occasion. Tench remarked:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Owing to the weather, which forebade any part of the
ships engaging with the shore, we are unable to pronounce whether
or not a straight intersects the continent thereabouts; though I
have been informed by a naval friend that, when the fleet was off
this part of the coast, a strong set off shore was plainly
felt.</blockquote>
<p>The naval friend was most probably Captain Hunter, whose skill
as a navigator was shown throughout the passage. When "the long
wished for shores of Van Diemen" appeared in sight, his
passengers were surprised to find that he had predicted the hour
at which land would be seen:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We made the land at two o'clock in the afternoon [of
the 7th January, 1788], the very hour we expected to see it from
the lunar observations of Captain Hunter, whose accuracy as an
astronomer and conduct as an officer had inspired us with equal
gratitude and admiration.</blockquote>
<p>After the wreck of the Sirius in March, 1790, at Norfolk
Island, Hunter remained there in weary captivity with the
officers and crew of the ship, to the number of eighty, for
eleven mouths, no means being available for taking them to
England. The Supply had been sent to Batavia in order that a
Dutch ship might be chartered and laden with provisions for the
settlement; and on her return she was again sent to Norfolk
Island in order to bring away the shipwrecked crew.</p>
<blockquote>This information I received with joy, as our
situation was now become exceedingly irksome; we had been upon
this small island eleven months, and during a great part of that
time, through various causes, had been oppressed by feelings more
distressing than I can find words to express.</blockquote>
<p>They left the island in February, 1791, and on reaching
Sydney, Hunter learned that Phillip had made a contract with the
master of the Dutch snow, then lying in the harbour, for the
passage of the officers and crew to England&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>a piece of information which I did not by any means
feel a pleasure in hearing; for, anxious as I was to reach
England as soon as possible, I should with much patience rather
have waited the arrival of an English ship, than embarked under
the direction or at the disposal of a foreigner.</blockquote>
<p>The mistrust of foreigners shown in this instance seems to
have been a common feeling among English officers at the time.
When King reached the Cape of Good Hope on his way to England in
October, 1790, he declined a passage in a French frigate because
he had heard rumours of a complication between England and Spain.
This state of suspicion was more than justified by the cruel
treatment which Flinders met with from the French, when he put in
to the Mauritius in distress in 1803. King had cautioned him
strongly before he sailed against going there.</p>
<p>Hunter, however, was obliged to resign himself to his fate,
and shortly afterwards sailed in the Dutchman for England via
Batavia and the Cape of Good Hope, reaching his destination in
April, 1792, after a voyage of nearly thirteen months. A letter
which he addressed to the Lords of the Admiralty on his return,
advocating the passage by Cape Horn on the homeward voyage, in
preference to that by the Cape of Good Hope, or northward
<i>vi&#226;</i> Batavia, throws a curious light on the state of
navigation at the time it was written.</p>
<p>In the curious group gathered together on the shores of Sydney
Cove, there was but one man with whom Phillip was connected by
old associations; and that was the second lieutenant of the
Sirius, Philip Gidley King, who had sailed with him on a cruise
to the East Indies in a frigate he commanded some six years
before the First Fleet left the Channel. There was a difference
of twenty years between them in point of age; Phillip being in
his fiftieth and King in his thirtieth year when they stood under
the British flag, drinking the health of King George and
prosperity to the colony of New South Wales. A portrait of the
young lieutenant, with a sketch of his previous career in the
navy, was published in Phillip's Voyage&#8212;where he is
described as "an officer much esteemed by Phillip as of great
merit in his profession; and highly spoken of in his letters as a
man whose perseverance in any service might be fully depended
on." So it proved. King's face in the portrait is clearly cut and
intelligent, with an expression that enables us to understand
Phillip's feeling towards him. The two men had formed a
friendship on board the Europe which lasted throughout their
lives. How strong and how enduring the tie that bound them may be
seen in a letter written from Bath by King, with a trembling
hand, seven days before his death in September, 1808, to his son,
"dear Phillip", so named after his old comrade:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As this letter may probably reach you before you
sail, I just write to say that I came here on Tuesday with Mr.
Lethbridge, on his return to London, merely to see Admiral
Phillip, whom I found much better than I possibly could expect
from the reports I had heard, although he is quite a cripple,
having lost the entire use of his right side; but his intellects
are very good, and his spirits are what they always were.
<a href="#note-198" name="noteref-198" id=
"noteref-198">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>This is the last glimpse we have of Phillip, after his return
to England. He lingered on till 1814. The meeting between the two
old ex-Governors at Bath, both in the last stage of weakness and
decay, furnishes a touching proof of the affection which had so
long existed between them.</p>

<b>Philip Gidley King</b></p>
<br>
<p>Although King had entered the navy when he was only twelve
years old, he managed to learn the French language sufficiently
for conversational purposes; an accomplishment which proved
useful when he paid a visit to La P&#233;rouse at Botany Bay, and
also when the French ships under Baudin anchored in Port Jackson
while he was Governor of the colony. He has left an interesting
account in his journal <a href="#note-199" name="noteref-199" id=
"noteref-199">{6}</a> of the visit to La P&#233;rouse, to whom he
was sent by Phillip in February, 1788, with offers of assistance.
He was accompanied by Lieutenant Dawes, and the young officers
were received with all the hospitality usual on such occasions.
After they had dined on board the Boussole, La P&#233;rouse and
his officers went on shore with them&#8212;at the point which now
bears his name&#8212;where, says King&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I found him quite established; he had thrown round
his tents a stockade, which was guarded by two small guns, and in
which they were setting up two long-boats, which he had in frame.
After these boats were built, it was the intention of M. Peyrouse
to go round New Ireland, through the Moluccas, and to pass to the
Island of France by the Streights of Sunda.</blockquote>
<p>The unhappy Frenchmen did not know then that a very different
track had been marked out for their ships on the chart of
destiny, After the party had gone through the stockade they went
to the observatory, where they found the astronomer of the
expedition at work in a tent; and as conversation naturally
turned on scientific matters, the Frenchmen paid a well-merited
compliment to Captain Cook, saying that at every place they had
touched at and been near, they had found all his nautical and
astronomical observations exact. La P&#233;rouse added, with the
epigrammatic point characteristic of French genius:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Enfin, Monsieur Cook a tant fait quil ne m'a rien
laiss&#232; a faire que d'admirer ses &#339;uvres.</blockquote>
<p>These are the last spoken words which history has preserved of
the unfortunate Frenchman; and King did good service to his
memory when he recorded them in his notes. <a href="#note-200"
name="noteref-200" id="noteref-200">{7}</a></p>
<p>Phillip lost no opportunity for promoting his friend's
interests. It was at his instance, no doubt, that King was
appointed to the Sirius; and one of the Governor's first official
acts, after the proclamation of the colony, was to send him to
Norfolk Island with a commission appointing him
commandant&#8212;thus placing him in the direct path to
promotion. The service was an important one, because it involved
the establishment of a branch colony to which the elder one would
have to look for assistance in the trying times that lay before
it. One of the immediate objects in view was the dressing of the
flax-plant, the Home Government having been led to believe that
the Royal Navy would soon be supplied with better sail-cloth and
cordage from Norfolk Island flax than from any other material
then known. That expectation was never realised, although
flax-dressing afterwards formed one of the principal industries
on the island for some years. The plant grew there as luxuriantly
as it did in New Zealand; but the art of manufacturing it was
unknown until April, 1793, when two natives of New Zealand were
seized and carried away from their homes for the purpose of being
employed as teachers. They were restored to their own country in
the following February, when, according to Collins (p. 346), they
had completed the purpose for which they were taken, by giving
such instructions in the process of preparing the flax-plant
that, even with very bad materials, a few hands could manufacture
thirty yards of good canvas in a week. They had not been
kidnapped by King's orders; but, nevertheless, in order to
satisfy himself that good faith was kept with them, he resolved
to see them home; and having appointed a deputy to carry on the
government during his absence from the island, he sailed with
them to New Zealand&#8212;an act of humanity which, however,
involved him in an unpleasant correspondence with Major Grose,
then administering the government of New South Wales.</p>
<p>King's tenure of office under Phillip's commission lasted
until March, 1790, when he was recalled for the purpose of being
sent to England with despatches, "in order to give such
information to his Majesty's Ministers respecting the settlement
I had established as could not be conveyed by letter." Probably
there was another reason for this mission, the state of affairs
at Sydney Cove being so desperate at that time that the necessity
for bringing it home to the minds of Ministers by personal
representations must have been strongly felt. King was
accordingly discharged from the Sirius and placed in the position
of an envoy, with the prospect of further promotion in addition
to a trip home. During his two years' residence on the island, he
had not spared himself in his efforts to cultivate the wilderness
of pines and supple-jacks which he was expected to convert into a
granary. His first garden was made in "a fine valley. in which a
number of plantain or banana trees were found, to which he gave
the name of Arthur's Vale in memory of his friend, whom he had
already commemorated by naming Phillip Isle&#8212;an island off
the coast&#8212;after him. The sort of country he had to operate
on at that time may be judged from his description of
it:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I took the first opportunity of examining the island
around me, and found it almost impenetrable from the size of the
trees and the entangled state of their roots, which were in
general two feet above the ground, and ran along it to a
considerable distance. On the spaces of ground unoccupied by
these roots there grew a kind of supple-jack, which in general
was as thick as a man's leg; these supple-jacks ran up the trees,
and as they grew in every direction they formed an impenetrable
kind of network; bending some trees to the ground and then taking
root again, they twined round other trees in the same manner,
until the whole became an impervious forest. As I had only twelve
men (one of whom was seventy-two years of age, and another a boy
of fifteen), exclusive of the mate and surgeon, my progress must
be very slow. <a href="#note-201" name="noteref-201" id=
"noteref-201">{8}</a></blockquote>
<p>When Cook landed on the island in October, 1774, he found the
ground, for about two hundred yards from the shore, "covered so
thick with shrubs and plants as hardly to be penetrated farther
inland."</p>
<p>King's work was evidently cut out for him when he was required
to commence farming in country of that description, without any
assistance in the shape of skilled labour. Having been at sea
since he was twelve years of age, he could hardly tell the
difference between one plant and another; he did not even know
the flax-plant when he saw it; <a href="#note-202" name=
"noteref-202" id="noteref-202">{9}</a> while the men sent with
him, unskilled as they were, were too few to enable him to make
much progress in clearing and cultivating. But difficulties
gradually gave way before his energy and perseverance; so that
when he left the island in March, 1790, he was in a position to
describe the result of his farming operations with no little
satisfaction, and to discourse on crops and soils as if he had
been a farmer all his life. Thirty acres of public land were
under cultivation when he left, where eighteen were covered with
private gardens; the population numbering four hundred and
eighteen, exclusive of eighty men belonging to the Sirius. His
management, therefore, had proved a success, and fully justified
the confidence which Phillip placed in him.</p>
<p>But King had other work to do on the island besides studying
seed-time and harvest. No chaplain had been sent with his little
company, for there was none to send; and consequently the duty of
giving religious instruction fell upon him. Every Sunday morning
at eleven the congregation were summoned to his cottage by the
church-bell, "which was a man beating on the head of an empty
cask"; when every one was required by general orders to "come
clean and orderly and behave themselves devoutly." He was a
Justice of the Peace, too, as well as a minister of religion, and
soon found himself called upon to exercise his magisterial
functions. He was, in fact, a complete Court of Criminal and
Civil Judicature in himself, although no commission had been
issued to him for that purpose beyond his appointment as a
magistrate. <a href="#note-203" name="noteref-203" id=
"noteref-203">{10}</a> Collins says (p. 14) that he was "sworn in
as a Justice of the Peace, taking the oaths necessary on the
occasion, by which he was enabled to punish such petty offences
as might be committed among his people, capital crimes being
reserved for the cognisance of the Criminal Court of Judicature
established here." But as almost all offences were capital crimes
at that time, the distinction had very little meaning, except
when a really serious case, such as murder, might occur. Soon
after his arrival, for instance. King detected one of the marines
in the act of stealing rum out of a small vessel in his (King's)
tent, where it had been placed for safety. The offence was
serious, and had it been committed at Sydney Cove, the case would
have been tried before the Criminal Court, and would have
resulted in a sentence of death. One of the most painful cases
brought before it was that of a young convict who, availing
himself, as Collins says (p. 32), of the opportunity that was
given on the evening of his Majesty's birthday, when everyone was
abroad looking at the bonfires, entered an officer's tent for the
purpose of stealing, but was surprised and secured after a
struggle in which the thief received a sword wound from the
officer. A peculiar interest attaches to this case, arising from
a pathetic letter written by, or rather for, the offender to his
mother on the eve of his execution, and published by Tench.
<a href="#note-204" name="noteref-204" id="noteref-204">{11}</a>
There was no essential difference between that case and the one
mentioned by King; but while one offender suffered death within
twenty-four hours after his conviction, the other was much more
mercifully dealt with. King might have reserved the case for
trial at Sydney, as he did on a subsequent occasion; but instead
of doing so, he assembled the people and ordered three dozen
lashes to be inflicted on the offender in their presence, first
"causing him to be led by a halter to the place of
punishment"&#8212;probably to remind him of the penalty he had
escaped. The flogging, however, did not produce the desired
effect; for three days afterwards a convict boy was detected in
the act of stealing the surgeon's allowance of rum in his tent.
Here was another offence for which sentence of death would have
been pronounced at head-quarters; but as the boy was only fifteen
years old&#8212;he had been transported for seven
years&#8212;King again dealt summarily with the case, ordering a
hundred lashes, "which I hoped would have a good effect."</p>
<p>The boy of fifteen got a hundred lashes because three dozen
had failed to make a good impression on the able-bodied marine.
The logic of the sentence is not convincing at the present day;
but it was evidently considered good reasoning at the time. The
case deserves attention as an illustration of the theory and
practice of the flogging system a century ago. King's views on
the subject were those of a naval officer; he administered
punishment in accordance with the practice on board his Majesty's
ships. He certainly had not gained any experience in that form of
discipline at Sydney Cove, which he had left before it was well
established there. Nor is there any reason to believe that he was
an unmerciful administrator of the law; on the contrary, his
summary dealing with these cases showed that he had no desire to
resort to extreme measures; while his action on the discovery of
a conspiracy among the convicts to seize a ship and make
prisoners of the guards, as well as himself, showed that he was
not disposed to abuse his powers. <a href="#note-205" name=
"noteref-205" id="noteref-205">{12}</a> The only punishment he
inflicted on that occasion was to put two of the ringleaders in
irons, and deprive them of their garden ground; one of them being
afterwards sent to Sydney for trial.</p>
<p>King sailed for England <i>vi&#226;</i> Batavia a few days
after his return to Sydney Cove in April, 1790, with despatches
from Phillip. The narrative of his voyage might form a curious
chapter in the history of navigation. The progress made in the
art during the last century could not be better illustrated than
it is in his experience on that occasion. The traveller
now-a-days between Sydney and London has many different routes to
choose from; each of them offering a variety of temptations in
the shape of luxurious voyaging, with an economy of time that
seems marvellous when compared with the eight or ten months
usually occupied on the passage home a hundred years ago. But the
only means of reaching England open to King was by way of
Batavia; and when there he had to trust to chance for a ship to
the Cape of Good Hope, and so on to England.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in obtaining a passage from Batavia to
England in a small packet belonging to the Dutch East India
Company, he sailed in August; but he had not been five days at
sea before the whole of the crew, captain included, with the
exception of four men, were rendered unfit for work by an attack
of putrid fever, caused by "the pestiferous air of Batavia." King
was thus forced to take command of the ship and to navigate her
with a crew of four men, while the rest, confined below, were
rapidly becoming delirious; even the surgeon on board being so
ill as to be incapable of rendering assistance. To prevent
contagion, he put up a tent on deck for himself and his crew,
whom he would not allow to go below. Under these circumstances,
he saw that there was nothing to do but to bear up for the Isle
of France, or Mauritius, where they arrived in a fortnight.
During that time, seventeen of the crew died. On reaching Port
Louis, a passage to France in a French frigate about to sail was
offered to King, but having "heard of a misunderstanding between
England and Spain", he thought it his duty to remain on board the
Dutch vessel, notwithstanding the risk of fever.</p>
<p>Having cleansed his ship and taken a fresh crew on board, he
sailed for the Cape of Good Hope in September, and anchored in
Table Bay after eighteen days at sea. There he found the
unfortunate Lieutenant Riou, of H.M.S. Guardian&#8212;which had
been wrecked by collision with an iceberg in December of the
previous year&#8212;"waiting for orders from England." A two
months' voyage from the Cape brought King to England on the 20th
December&#8212;the passage from Port Jackson having taken over
eight months.</p>
<p>On his arrival in London, King lost no time in delivering his
despatches to the Home Office and the Admiralty. The journal he
had kept at Norfolk Island was also handed in at the same time;
and was subsequently, at the instance of Sir Joseph Banks,
published in Captain Hunter's volume. During his interview with
Evan Nepean at the Home Office, King was surprised and pleased to
learn from him, for the first time, that a commission appointing
him Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island had been signed by his
Majesty and sent to his agent to be forwarded to him. He had not
then received an official letter written on the 1st February,
1790, by Lord Grenville&#8212;who had succeeded Sydney at the
Home Office&#8212;in the following terms:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have laid before the King the representations made
by Governor Phillip of your services since you have been employed
under his command, and I have the satisfaction to acquaint you
that his Majesty has, as a reward of those services, been pleased
to sign a commission appointing you Lieutenant-Governor of
Norfolk Island, to which appointment it is intended to propose in
the next estimate laid before the House of Commons an annual
allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds.</blockquote>
<p>His position in the service and consequent prospects of
promotion were thus assured, through the representations of his
friend. The day after he left his despatches, he had an interview
with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Chatham, the Prime
Minister's brother, who had succeeded Lord Howe; and on the
following day he saw Lord Grenville, who had probably some
misgivings as to the state of affairs at Sydney Cove, owing to
the wreck of the Guardian and the consequent loss of stores.
Their lordships wished to get some authentic information on the
subject, and had sent for King. The conversation which took place
at the two interviews was fortunately noted down by him shortly
afterwards, in the following words:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>On the 22nd December, 1790, I saw Lord Chatham, whose
enquirys were first directed to the situation of the colony in
New South Wales, and the prospects it afforded for maintaining
the colonists. As my stay at Port Jackson was so very short, I
could give his lordship no other information on that head than
stating the actual situation of the colony for want of provisions
and stores at the time I left it; and the great inconvenience
that would be experienced by the loss of the Sirius. In answer to
his lordship's questions respecting Norfolk Island, I gave him a
detail nearly similar to that contained in my journal, that I had
delivered to Mr. Stephens <a href="#note-206" name="noteref-206"
id="noteref-206">{13}</a> the preceding day.</blockquote>
<p>Lord Chatham did not seem to take much interest in the
prospects of the colony, beyond the pressing question of the
hour.</p>
<blockquote>Lord Grenville having desired to see me after I had
been with Lord Chatham, I waited on him the next morning, the
23rd. After several general questions, to which I gave nearly the
same answers as to my Lord Chatham, his lordship asked if I
thought the colony would experience any total want of provisions
before the probable time that the Neptune and other ships might
arrive there? In answer to this question, I informed his lordship
that when I left Port Jackson, the 21st April, 1790, the pork was
calculated to last out till ye 26th August, the rice and flour
until the 19th December, at the ration of 2 lb. of flour, 2 lb.
of rice, and 2 lb. of pork each man for seven days; and supposing
the ships were not more than ten weeks from the Cape of Good Hope
to Port Jackson, they would arrive two months before the pork was
expended; on which his lordship said he had little doubt that the
colony was amply relieved by the Justinian, which sailed a single
ship.</blockquote>
<p>This remark of his lordship's shows how easily Ministers
managed to satisfy themselves about the position of the colony,
notwithstanding the wreck of the Guardian. The Justinian, as
Collins tells us (p. 119), narrowly escaped being wrecked on the
coast of New South Wales; had that happened, the colonists might
have been starved out before relief was brought by the arrival of
the Supply from Batavia in September, 1790, followed by a Dutch
vessel in December. The Justinian arrived in June, after a five
months' voyage. A fortnight before her arrival, the Lady Juliana
came in with female convicts; and shortly afterwards three other
ships dropped anchor, filled with convicts in such a state of
exhaustion from illness that four hundred and eighty-eight of
them were placed in hospital as soon as they were landed. These
ships formed the Second Fleet.</p>
<blockquote>His lordship next asked if I thought the marines
would be desirous of remaining in the colony as soldiers or
settlers? I replied that I never had an opportunity of knowing
their opinions or wishes on that subject, but that I had my
doubts whether many of them would wish to remain when the relief
took place. On his lordship asking the same question respecting
the convicts, when their terms became expired, I said that I
believed returning to England was what they in general looked
forward to; but that I thought it probable, as the country
advanced in resources and cultivation, that many might be induced
to become settlers, and instanced the prospering state of one of
that description who I had settled before I left Norfolk
Island.</blockquote>
<p>No question about free settlers; even the idea of sending them
out had not yet assumed shape. The conversation ended with a
friendly remark from his lordship, which naturally led King to
put in a word or two for himself:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>His lordship then, with much politeness, expressed
his unwillingness (as I was so lately arrived) to propose my
immediate return to Norfolk Island. I assured his lordship I felt
it both my inclination and duty to be in readiness to go whenever
my services might be thought necessary; and after expressing the
sense I had of the honour done me by his Majesty's appointing me
Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island, I took the liberty of
saying that I hoped not to be thought presuming in soliciting the
honour of obtaining a step in the navy. His lordship politely
remarked that he should be happy to see my wish gratified, but
that promotion in the navy by no means rested with
him.</blockquote>
<p>After a stay of nearly three months in England, King set out
on his return to the seat of his government in H.M.S. Gorgon,
commanded by Captain Parker&#8212;after whom his son Phillip
Parker King was named. They sailed on the 15th March, and arrived
in Port Jackson on the 21st September, 1791. The voyage was a
pleasant one, judging from the account of it written by Captain
Parker's widow and published in 1795. King had many reasons to
enjoy the trip; he had not only his commission as a
Lieutenant-Governor, but also another as a master and commander
in the navy, having obtained the step for which he had asked Lord
Grenville. <a href="#note-207" name="noteref-207" id=
"noteref-207">{14}</a> In addition to the commissions, he had a
wife whom he had married during his stay in England. Mrs. Parker
tells us of many little excursions on shore at Teneriffe. Port
Praya, and the Cape, enjoyed by the passengers of the
Gorgon&#8212;amongst whom was Mr. Grimes, a surveyor, who was
sent in 1802 by Governor King to survey Port Phillip. This lady's
homely narrative gives us a sketch of social life in Sydney, at
the time of her arrival, which seems to show the bright side of a
picture too generally looked upon as without even a tint of
colour. Let us take her sketch of "Sidney Cove" to begin
with&#8212;the slopes of which, as she saw it, were still radiant
with green, although the ground was very rocky; stately trees
crowned the heights on either side; here and there a house or
public building, surrounded by huts; red-coated soldiers on
guard, with bayonets glistening in the sunlight, and gangs of
labourers at work in all directions. Here is her account of what
she saw on landing:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>When we went on shore, we were all admiration at the
natural beauties raised by the hand of Providence without expence
or toil: I mean the various flowery shrubs, natives of this
country, that grow apparently from rock itself. The gentle
ascents, the winding valleys, and the abundance of flowering
shrubs, render the face of the country very delightful. The shrub
which most attracted my attention was one which bears a white
flower very much resembling our English hawthorn; the smell of it
is both sweet and fragrant, and perfumes the air around to a
considerable distance. <a href="#note-208" name="noteref-208" id=
"noteref-208">{15}</a></blockquote>
<p>The Gorgon being the first man-of-war that had entered the
harbour since the foundation of the colony, her arrival formed an
important event in its social history, and one that was no doubt
particularly pleasing to Phillip and his officers. A lively
exchange of hospitalities took place between Government House and
the ship, at which many cherished memories of Old England were
revived. The anniversary of His Majesty's accession to the throne
occurring a few days afterwards, Phillip celebrated the occasion
by a dinner which, as Collins tells us, "was served to upwards of
fifty officers, a greater number than the colony had ever before
seen assembled together." The guests of course included the naval
officers in port. Then came a breakfast on board the Gorgon, at
which "the conversation was very interesting; the one party
anxiously making inquiries after their relatives in England, and
the other attentively listening to the troubles and anxieties
"which had been endured by the colonists. "Governor King and his
Lady", we are told, resided on shore at Governor Phillip's, "to
whose house the visitors generally repaired after breakfasting on
board", and from which parties were made for "several pleasant
excursions up the Cove to the settlement called Parramatta." The
trip up and down the river gave them an opportunity of seeing the
various points of beauty in that branch of the harbour, which
were fully appreciated. On reaching Parramatta, Phillip took his
friends to his house, described as 1791 "a small convenient
building placed upon a gentle ascent, and surrounded by about a
couple of acres of garden ground; this spot is called Rose Hill."
<a href="#note-209" name="noteref-209" id="noteref-209">{16}</a>
Here the day was spent and among the objects of interest that
attracted attention was "the beautiful plumage of the birds in
general, and of the emu in particular", two of which were met
with in the woods. During the stay of the Gorgon in port, the
excursions included visits to many of the little coves about the
harbour, where they found oysters as well as scenery to dwell
upon:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Here we have feasted upon Oisters just taken out of
the sea; the attention of our sailors, and their care in opening
and placing them round their hats in lieu of plates, by no means
diminished the satisfaction we had in eating them.</blockquote>

<b>The Governor's House at Rose Hill.</b></p>
<br>
<p>The ingenuity displayed in improvising plates out of their
hats was creditable to the jack-tars of the Gorgon; but the
oysters, alas! have gone, with the flowering shrubs and the birds
of brilliant plume. From scenes like these it may be gathered
that life in Sydney Cove, even in 1791, was not altogether
without its charms for those who had opportunities of enjoying
it. Phillip was evidently fond of showing his visitors all the
attractions of a new and beautiful country, and was probably not
a little proud of his dominions. "The fatherly attention of the
good Governor upon all occasions" is specially noted by his
guest, whose stay in Sydney was rendered "perfectly happy and
comfortable" by his kindness, combined with "the friendly
politeness of the officers." Good things were not altogether
wanting at their tables at this time&#8212;a happy contrast with
their sufferings of the previous year. Presents of eggs, milk,
and vegetables were frequently sent on board the Gorgon by the
military gentlemen on shore; kangaroo was considered a delicacy,
and emu was said to taste like beef. Thus the month in port went
pleasantly by; and when at last, on the 26th October, "Captain
King and his Lady, with Captain and Mrs. Paterson, and several
other military officers destined for Norfolk Island" had gone on
board the Atlantic, they were "accompanied to the end of the Cove
by the Governor, Judge-Advocate, Captain Parker, and many others,
who were anxious to be in their company as long as possible."</p>
<br>
<p>When Phillip determined to send King to England and to put
Major Ross in his place at Norfolk Island, he accomplished two
objects of some personal interest to himself; he removed one man
from a position which enabled him to prove obstructive, if not
mischievous, and he did a considerable service to the other. The
line of conduct adopted by the Major had rendered it difficult,
if not impossible, to look for any cordial co-operation from him;
and the only means by which the strained relations that had grown
up between them could be improved was by sending him to another
field of exertion. The necessity for distributing the population
at head-quarters, in consequence of the scarcity of provisions,
afforded Phillip an opportunity for doing so. Ross was
accordingly sent to Norfolk Island in the Sirius, with two
companies of marines and some two hundred convicts, early in
March, 1790. The ship had no sooner reached the island than she
was wrecked on the reefs, but without any loss of life. This
event gave rise to a singular display of authority on the part of
Major Ross:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The instant the ship struck, Lieutenant-Governor Ross
ordered the drums to assemble all the marines and convicts;
martial law was then proclaimed, and the people were told that if
anyone killed any animal or fowl, or committed any robbery
whatever, they would be instantly made a severe example of.
<a href="#note-210" name="noteref-210" id=
"noteref-210">{17}</a></blockquote>
<p>In other words, they would be tried by a Court-martial and
executed. This proceeding appears to have been the result of a
sudden panic which had seized the Major. The wreck of the Sirius
no doubt placed the people on the island in a difficult position;
their numbers had been largely increased by the new arrivals,
while the imminent loss of the stores and provisions on board
threatened them with starvation; their lives at any rate would
depend on rigid economy in the distribution of food. In this
emergency, it occurred to the Major that, as there was no Court
in the island empowered to inflict the penalty of death for
stealing provisions, many men might be tempted to take advantage
of the fact, and the public safety might be thereby endangered.
The only remedy he could think of was to substitute military law
for the civil, which practically meant taking the power of life
and death into his own hands. Hunter and King, accepting him as
an authority on the subject, allowed themselves to be persuaded
that this was the proper thing to be alone under the
circumstances. The arguments by which he justified his course of
action were recorded in King's journal at the time:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>At ten in the morning of the next day,
Lieutenant-Governor Ross, Captain Hunter, all the commissioned
officers of marines and of the Sirius, and myself, assembled in
the Government House, when the Lieutenant-Governor laid the
situation of the island before the meeting, and pointed out the
necessity of a law being made by which criminals might be
punished with death for capital crimes, there being no law in
force on the island that could notice capital offences: he also
proposed the establishment of martial law until further orders,
which was unanimously agreed to; and that in all crises where
sentence of death was pronounced, five persons out of seven
should concur in opinion.</blockquote>
<p>This proceeding is one of many illustrations met with in our
early history of the marked propensity shown by military men for
setting aside the magistrate, and assuming arbitrary power at a
moment's notice. There was no precedent for the act; nor was
there any authority for it; still less was there any
justification. The only justification recognised by English law
is necessity; but that means a necessity demonstrated by facts,
not an imaginary one. <a href="#note-211" name="noteref-211" id=
"noteref-211">{18}</a> At the very least, Ross might have waited
until his fears had been realised; and he might have waited in
safety, seeing that he had an overpowering force of marines, to
say nothing of the crew of the Sirius. Apart, moreover, from the
absence of any justification for his proceeding connected with
the existing state of affairs, there was the fact that the power
to proclaim martial law did not rest with him, but with the
Governor of the territory; the proclaiming of martial law being
at all times a matter for the consideration of the Executive
Government, and not of the military employed in enforcing it.
<a href="#note-212" name="noteref-212" id="noteref-212">{19}</a>
Although the Major held a dormant commission as
Lieutenant-Governor, that did not invest him with supreme power
at Norfolk Island while Phillip was at head-quarters. As a matter
of fact, at the time he undertook to establish military law his
position was simply that of Major of marines; King being still
commandant of the island. <a href="#note-213" name="noteref-213"
id="noteref-213">{20}</a> But although he was still commandant,
and as a magistrate had power to enforce law and order, calling
in the aid of the military if he found it necessary, <a href=
"#note-214" name="noteref-214" id="noteref-214">{21}</a> Ross did
not hesitate to supersede him in order to carry out his own ideas
of "good government".</p>
<p>The manner in which he accomplished this purpose was
characteristic. As soon as the wreck took place, he summoned a
meeting of "all the commissioned officers of his Majesty's navy
and marines at this place, for establishing such rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the good government of the
settlement on the present occasion." These gentlemen, who were
termed a "council", were peremptorily "required to meet the
Lieutenant-Governor at Government House" on the same day. When
the Council was assembled, a series of resolutions, embodying the
Major's ideas of good government, was drawn up and agreed to. The
first declared that seven commissioned officers should comprise a
General Court-martial; but that sentence of death should not be
passed in any case unless five members of the Court concurred in
the judgment.</p>
<p>By means of this resolution, Ross at once got rid of the
difficulties in the way of holding a General Court-martial, which
had proved insuperable at Sydney Cove. There it had been held
that such a Court could not be constituted unless thirteen
officers were present; and when that condition was complied with,
it was laid down by the marines that they could not act under any
warrant unless it came from the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty. For that reason they declined to recognise the
validity of a warrant issued by Phillip under the authority of
his Majesty's commission. The resolution, therefore, proposed to
create a Court at Norfolk Island for the trial of offences with
the same jurisdiction as the Criminal Court at Sydney Cove, to be
convened by no better authority than a warrant under the hand of
Major Ross.. It is true that when martial law is proclaimed, the
constitution of the Courts convened under it may be left to the
discretion of the officer charged with the duty of enforcing it;
and it is not absolutely necessary that there should be any Court
at all. <a href="#note-215" name="noteref-215" id=
"noteref-215">{22}</a> But that view of the matter holds good
only where military law has been legally proclaimed by the proper
authority, under circumstances which would be held to justify
such an interruption of the ordinary course of justice.</p>
<p>Another resolution declared that "all marauding or plundering,
whether of public or of private property, will be deemed capital
crimes"; in other words, a charge of theft would be followed by
sentence and execution. Thus the island was placed under military
law in its strictest form; King's command was extinguished, and
civil government on the island was at an end. <a href="#note-216"
name="noteref-216" id="noteref-216">{23}</a></p>
<p>The proceedings which took place on the occasion of the
proclamation formed a pretty little scene for a
melodrama:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>At eight o'clock in the morning, all persons on the
island were assembled near the lower flag-staff, on which the
Union was hoisted: the marines were drawn up in two lines,
leaving a space in the centre, at the head of which was the
Union. The colours of the detachment were then unfurled, and the
Sirius's crew were drawn up on the right, and the convicts on the
left, the officers being in the centre. The proclamation was then
read, declaring that the island was to be governed by martial law
until further orders; the Lieutenant-Governor next addressed the
convicts, and after pointing out the situation of the settlement,
he exhorted them to be honest, industrious, and obedient. This
being concluded, the whole gave three cheers; and every person,
beginning with the Lieutenant-Governor, passed under the Union
flag, taking off their hats as they passed it in token of an oath
to submit and be amenable to the martial law, which had then been
declared.</blockquote>
<p>Major Ross remained in charge of the island until King's
return in November, 1791, when the Major sailed for Sydney, and
shortly afterwards for England. On his departure, his position as
commanding officer of the forces was occupied by Major Grose, who
arrived in the Pitt, transport, in February, 1792, the first
detachment of the New South Wales Corps, of which he was major
commandant, having reached the colony in June, 1790. Grose's
career in the colony after Phillip had left it formed a singular
parallel to that of his predecessor. Under his rule as
Lieutenant-Governor, military power became supreme, the
magistrate was suppressed, and the colony was governed in much
the same fashion as a camp. Grose's commission as
Lieutenant-Governor of the colony was publicly read "on the
parade in front of the quarters", a month after his arrival; but
he did not enter into office until the following December, when
Phillip returned to England.</p>
<p>The appointment of a captain of marines to such a post as that
of Judge-Advocate at the foundation of the colony was a striking
departure from the ordinary rules of the service. The office was
a purely civil one; and in view of the fact that the
Judge-Advocate presided over the administration of law in the
settlement, the selection of a military man for the post can be
explained only on the ground that it was intended to administer
law in accordance with military rules and practice. Collins had
no judicial experience to guide him in his new career. He had not
acted as a Judge-Advocate in any of the military tribunals in
England; but he had no doubt seen many trials by Court-martial
during his time of active service in the navy. He held his
appointment at Sydney Cove until 1796, when he returned to
England; and after waiting some six or seven years for the
promotion he had earned by his services and sufferings in the
colony, he was appointed in 1803 Lieutenant-Governor of the
projected settlement on the shores of Port Phillip&#8212;which he
turned into a settlement on the shores of the Derwent. In
addition to his judicial duties, he acted as secretary to
Governor Phillip for some time after their arrival, and was
consequently brought into frequent and familiar contact with him.
The position he thus occupied peculiarly fitted him for another
and more important office which he conferred upon
himself&#8212;that of the annalist of the colony; a capacity in
which he did great service to the colonists as well as to the
Home Government. Although he confined his attention too
exclusively to the mere occurrences of the day&#8212;a process
which resulted in giving his work the character of an almanac, or
rather a calendar&#8212;the narrative itself is a faithful record
of the events connected with the foundation and early years of
the settlement, and entitles its author to the grateful
remembrance of his readers. The painful duties he was so
frequently called upon to discharge as Judge-Advocate had no
doubt coloured his impressions of surrounding circumstances, and
gave the gloomy character to his chronicle which makes itself so
forcibly felt in the present day. Writing day by day as if he had
the fatal black cap on his head, he could hardly avoid giving
prominence to the dismal scenes in which he was so often
compelled to take part.</p>
<p>His own character has been described by those who knew him as
essentially humane; he was more than merciful in his
administration of the government at Hobart Town. To a man of
cultivated mind as well as kindly feeling, the frequent discharge
of such judicial duties as fell to his lot must have been trying
at the least; and it may readily be believed that his influence
with the Governor was not seldom exercised for the purpose of
tempering justice with mercy. Perhaps nothing could more forcibly
illustrate the prevalent opinion with respect to the criminal
code then in force than the fact that, although it was
administered by a man whose personal sympathies must in many
cases have revolted against its extreme severity, he had not a
word to say in condemnation of it, the inference being that it
did not present itself to his mind as more severe than it should
be. On that point the Judge-Advocate probably held the same
opinion as the Judges in England, who were so much in the habit
of passing sentence of death for trifling offences at the
Criminal Assizes, that they learned to look upon such sentences
as absolutely necessary for the protection of society. <a href=
"#note-217" name="noteref-217" id="noteref-217">{24}</a> Every
sentence of death or flogging imposed by the Criminal Court for
the first eight years of its existence was pronounced by Collins;
and in many of those cases he knew, and recorded the fact, that
the crime for which punishment was exacted had been committed
under the pressure of starvation. <a href="#note-218" name=
"noteref-218" id="noteref-218">{25}</a> The terrible penalties
demanded by the law for such offences&#8212;in some cases death,
in others many hundreds of lashes&#8212;seem so inhuman at the
present day that the men who administered the law are too often
held responsible for its severity. But they were no more
accountable for it than the man who guides a steam-engine can be
held to answer for its movement. His position as Judge-Advocate
made Collins the mouthpiece of the law, but it gave him no
control over it; he had no alternative but to pronounce judgment
and sentence according to its letter. He had no discretionary
power whatever.</p>
<p>During the greater part of Phillip's time, the chief question
he had to deal with was the supply and distribution of food. The
very existence of the colony depended almost entirely on the
arrival of ships from England with provisions; and when the ships
did not arrive at the expected time, death from famine could only
be averted by the most rigid regulations with respect to the
allowance of food. To protect the public store against
depredation became a matter of urgent necessity; and the only
means of protecting&#8212;according to the ideas then in vogue
<a href="#note-219" name="noteref-219" id=
"noteref-219">{26}</a>&#8212;was to increase the punishment for
theft, although it frequently happened that the offenders, from
want of sufficient food, were admittedly "too weak" to endure
punishment at all. A terrible illustration of this dilemma may be
seen in Collins's book. After recording the death of a man who
had dropped down dead at the store to which he had gone for his
day's provisions&#8212;the cause of death being sheer
starvation&#8212;Collins proceeds to state that the Criminal
Court, when assembled to deal with a prisoner who had been caught
in the act of stealing potatoes in the clergyman's garden,
"finding that the severity of former Courts did not prevent the
commission of the same offence", varied the ordinary punishment
by directing that the prisoner before them should receive three
hundred lashes, lose his ration of flour for six months, and be
chained for that time to two other delinquents of the same class.
<a href="#note-220" name="noteref-220" id="noteref-220">{27}</a>
The effect of this sentence may be estimated from the fact that
"the Governor remitted, after some days' trial, that part of it
which respected the prisoner's ration of flour, without which he
could not long have existed." This case is chronicled by Collins
without any expression of opinion tending to show that it was
regarded as unmerciful; the salient feature in the case was,
apparently, that the potatoes were in danger. But in justice to
his memory it should not be forgotten that, at that time, the
protection of the stores was undoubtedly a matter of life and
death to the community. Nor was he singular in his opinion, when
compared with the legislators and moralists of the age.</p>
<p>The peculiar circumstances of the time led to a singular
distortion of views with respect to the moral nature of the
offences brought before the Court. While the heaviest punishment
that could be inflicted was unsparingly dealt out to those who
ran off with their neighbours' vegetables or helped themselves to
the contents of the public store, much more serious violations of
the moral code were looked upon as comparatively venial. Collins,
for instance, states that a soldier who was condemned to death in
July, 1789, for a criminal assault on a child eight years of age,
was recommended to mercy and pardoned by the Governor, "on
condition of his residing, during the term of his natural life,
at Norfolk Island." <a href="#note-221" name="noteref-221" id=
"noteref-221">{28}</a> At that time, residing at Norfolk Island
was practically no punishment, because there was a better supply
of fresh provisions there than there was at Sydney Cove. Whether
that was so or not, the mercy extended to the offender contrasts
strangely with the hard measure dealt out to others. In March of
the same year, "six marines, the flower of our battalion, were
hanged by the public executioner on the sentence of a Criminal
Court, composed entirely of their own officers, for having at
various times robbed the public stores of flour, meat, spirits,
tobacco, and many other articles." <a href="#note-222" name=
"noteref-222" id="noteref-222">{29}</a> There was no
recommendation to mercy in that case, although it was known that
the men had been tempted to commit the offence br the scarcity of
provisions, and the opportunity placed in their way. That the
extreme penalty of the law should be rigorously exacted for the
commission of petty thefts which now-a-days would entail nothing
more than a term of imprisonment, while a criminal assault on a
child should meet with so much merciful consideration, seems an
absurd inversion of all recognised principles in the
administration of justice. The only justification that can be
found for it lies in the critical condition of the community at
that time, which created a feeling of alarm for the public safety
rapidly developing into panic. Many analogies, however, might be
found in the history of much older and wiser communities than
that of Sydney Cove in the last century; for the influence of
panic may be frequently traced in the legislation of the present
day, as well be in the administration of justice.</p>

vessel, but was honourably acquitted. In the course of the trial,
it is reported that, when asked what had induced him to put the
ship about in such circumstances, he replied (for he was a shrewd

Journal, p. 170. An interesting relic of the Sirius may be seen
at the Electric Lighthouse near Watson's Bay, in the shape of an
old iron nine-pounder mounted on a carriage, with the following
inscription engraved on a copper plate affixed to the
breech:&#8212;<br>
<br>
"This gun, which formed a portion of the armament of H.M.S.
Sirius, the first man-of-war that entered Port Jackson, was
landed here shortly after the foundation of the colony for
signalling arrivals, &amp;c."<br>
<br>
How the gun came to be landed from the Sirius is told by Captain
Hunter (p. 89):&#8212;"In the month of September (1788), Governor
Phillip signified to me that it was his intention very soon to
despatch the Sirius to the Cape of Good Hope in order to purchase
such quantity of provisions as she might be capable of taking on
board; and that she might be made as light as possible for that
purpose, he desired that I would land eight or ten of her guns
and carriages, with any other articles which I judged the ship
could spare for the time she might be absent, and which might
answer the purpose of lightening the ship and the making of room.
In consequence of this order, eight guns, with their carriages,
and twenty-four rounds of shot for each gun, twenty half-barrels
of powder, a spare anchor, and various other articles were put on
shore at Sydney Cove."<br>
<br>
These guns were probably mounted in the first instance at the
redoubt built on Dawes' Point. The one now at the lighthouse is
the only one remaining of the whole number put on shore. Four of
them were sent down to South Head by Governor Macquarie soon
after his arrival and previous to the erection of the old
Macquarie lighthouse, to be used as signal guns. Some time
afterwards three of the guns were in course of removal to Sydney
in a boat, when it sank off Bradley's Head, and the guns were
never recovered.</p>

This passage bears a curious resemblance to one in Tench's
Narrative, p. 118, on the same subject:&#8212;"The general face
of the country is certainly pleasant, being diversified with
gentle ascents and little winding vallies, covered for the most
part with large spreading trees, which afford a succession of
leaves in all seasons. In those places where trees are scarce, a
variety of flowering shrubs abound, most of them entirely new to
an European, and surpassing in beauty, fragrance, and number all
I ever saw in an uncultivated state; among these, a tall shrub,
bearing an elegant white flower which smells like English may, is
particularly delightful, and perfumes the air around to a great
distance." Mrs. Parker evidently had this description before her

out the orders of the Crown to supersede all law by his own

Every magistrate has authority to command all subjects to assist
him in the suppression of riot, and has also authority to call in
military assistance when he thinks it necessary. In 1796, Lords
Eldon and Redesdale stated, in a report to the Duke of Portland
concerning the riots in the West of England:&#8212;"We apprehend
that the civil magistrates have the same power to call for the
assistance of the military, as they have to call for the
assistance of others of his Majesty's subjects.&#8212;Tovey,
Martial Law, p. 10. The Letters Patent constituting the Courts of
Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction expressly declared that all
justices of the peace in the colony should have "the same power
to keep the peace, suppress and punish riots", &amp;c., as
justices in England had; post, p. 536.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Cresswell, of the marines, who was sent with a
detachment to Norfolk Island in June, 1789, after the discovery
of the conspiracy to seize King, was sworn in as a Justice of the
Peace for the island before his departure. There were
consequently two magistrates there when martial law was
proclaimed.</p>

It is distinctly laid down that persons under martial
law&#8212;that is, in case of mutiny or rebellion&#8212;may be
summarily tried and convicted, without even the ordinary forms of
military law, and with only such inquiry, whether by
Court-martial or otherwise, as the circumstances admit of; and if
by Court-martial, then by such evidence as can be
obtained.&#8212;Finlason, Martial Law, p. 83.</p>

In the various cases in which martial law has been proclaimed in
British colonies (collected in Tovey on Martial Law, p. 152) the
act was justified by the outbreak of insurrection. The most
notable instance of the kind occurred in Jamaica in 1865, when
Governor Eyre proclaimed martial law in order to suppress riot
and disorder among the negroes. One of the ring-leaders having
been tried and executed by Court-martial, an indictment for
murder was presented against Governor Eyre in England, but the
bill was thrown out by the Grand Jury. Another indictment was
then laid against the commanding officer of the troops who had
presided at the Court-martial, but the bill was thrown out. In
the course of his charge to the Grand Jury Lord Chief Justice
Cockburn said:&#8212;"No one, I think, who has the faintest idea
of what the administration of justice involves, could deem the
proceedings on this trial consistent with justice, or, to use a
homely phrase, with that fair play which is the right of the
commonest criminal. All I can say is, that if on martial law
being proclaimed a man can lawfully thus be tried, condemned, and
sacrificed, such a state of things is a scandal and reproach to
the institutions of this great and free country. I enter my
solemn and emphatic protest against the lives of men being thus
dealt with in time to come."</p>

Sir Samuel Romilly relates that when he introduced a bill, in
1808, to repeal the Act of Elizabeth which made it a capital
offence to steal privately from the person of another, the reform
met with determined opposition from many eminent lawyers. Burton,
a Welsh Judge, objected to it because it proposed to leave the
offence mere larceny, punishable with only seven years
transportation. He thought the punishment should be
transportation for life; and said that unless that alteration
were made in the bill, he would vote against it. Lord
Ellenborough was of the same opinion.</p>

convicts conducted themselves with much greater propriety; not a

Tench, referring to the extreme distress prevalent in May, 1790,
described the measures adopted to suppress theft of provisions as
follows;&#8212;"Persons detected in robbing gardens or pilfering
provisions were never screened; because as every man could
possess by his utmost exertions but a bare sufficiency to
preserve life, he who deprived his neighbour of that little drove
him to desperation. No new laws for the punishment of theft were
enacted; but persons of all descriptions were publicly warned
that the severest penalties which the existing law would
authorise would be inflicted on offenders. Farther, to contribute
to the detection of villainy, a proclamation, offering a reward
of 60 lb. of flour, more tempting than the ore of Peru or Potosi,
was promised to anyone who should apprehend and bring to justice
a robber of garden ground",&#8212;Complete Account, p. 43.</p>

<h3>1.18 THE COURTS OF LAW.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> Letters Patent by which the Courts of Law
were established in the colony, under the authority of the Act of
Parliament passed in 1787, created a system of judicature of a
wholly novel description. Three Courts were thus instituted: a
Court of Civil Jurisdiction, composed of the Judge-Advocate and
two persons appointed by the Governor; a Court of Criminal
Jurisdiction, composed of the Judge-Advocate and six officers,
naval or military; and a Court of Vice-Admiralty, composed of
seven Commissioners selected from the civil service as well as
the naval and military. The jurisdiction conferred upon each of
these tribunals was practically unlimited.</p>
<p>The Civil Court was empowered to hear and determine, in a
summary way, actions relating to lands and houses. actions of
debt and contract, actions of trespass, "and all manner of other
personal pleas whatsoever." No limit was placed to the pecuniary
amount involved, and no exception was made as to any special
class of actions; nor was any distinction recognised between
Common Law and Equity. The process was simple. On a complaint in
writing made by the plaintiff, the Judge-Advocate issued a
warrant under his hand and seal directed to the Provost-Marshal,
stating the substance of the complaint, and requiring him to
summon the defendant to appear. If the amount in dispute exceeded
&#163;10, the officer was directed to bring the defendant
personally into Court or take bail for his appearance; the
defendant being further required to find security for the
satisfaction of any judgment that might be given against him.</p>
<p>The parties being before the Court, the first stage in the
proceedings was to swear its members. The Judge-Advocate
administered an oath to each of the officers that he would "well
and truly try the several issues brought before him, and give
true judgment according to the evidence." The officers having
been duly sworn, one of them then administered the same oath to
the Judge-Advocate, and the business proceeded. Witnesses on
either side&#8212;parties to the cause were not then competent
witnesses in English Courts&#8212;were duly sworn and examined,
their evidence taken in writing and signed by them. The Court
then gave judgment "according to justice and right"; the judgment
being followed by a warrant of execution, if necessary, against
the defendant's goods and chattels. Where there was no sufficient
distress, the defendant could be imprisoned until the debt and
costs were satisfied. But in that case, if the defendant made
oath that he had no means of maintaining himself in prison, the
complainant had to provide maintenance for him according to the
order of the Court; and if the amount was not paid for one week,
the debtor was discharged, such discharge from prison being also
a discharge from the debt. If, on the other hand, the defendant
gained the case, he had similar remedies for the recovery of
costs.</p>
<p>Either party who might find himself aggrieved by the judgment
had a right of appeal to the Governor, who was empowered to issue
the necessary process. Where the amount involved exceeded
&#163;300, the unsuccessful appellant might go to a higher
tribunal, by appeal to the Privy Council. But no appeal could lie
unless proceedings for the purpose were taken within eight days
from the date of the judgment of the Judge-Advocate's Court, or
fourteen days from that of the Governor's. Having regard to the
state of the colony, the provisions for appeal were extremely
liberal.</p>
<p>The Court of Criminal Jurisdiction&#8212;which also exercised
unlimited powers&#8212;was convened by a precept or warrant
issued by the Governor under his hand and seal at any time he
might think proper. There were no regular or appointed times for
its sitting during the early years of the settlement; it met
whenever it was summoned in the manner mentioned. The procedure
at the trial was short and simple. The charge against the
prisoner, which was required to be "reduced into writing and
exhibited by our Judge-Advocate", was not a formal indictment
drawn up with technical accuracy according to precedent, but a
plain statement of the offence committed. There was no room for
technicalities of any kind in the practice of the Court; there
were no lawyers in the colony to take technical objections; nor
were prisoners in those days allowed to have counsel on their
trial, even in England. The first Judge-Advocate was a military
man and not a lawyer; he was not even supposed to have any
knowledge of law or of legal forms.</p>
<p>The Court being assembled, its members&#8212;each of whom was
in full military dress&#8212;were sworn to "make true deliverance
between his Majesty the King and the prisoner brought before
them, and to give true judgment according to the evidence." The
Judge-Advocate presided and regulated the procedure; but although
he was a judge he was also a juryman, having a vote in the
deliberations of the jury. In this as well as in other respects,
the constitution of the Court differed materially from that of a
Court of Justice in England, where juries were supposed to be
sternly guarded against undue judicial influence, and the judge
could address the jury only in open Court.</p>
<p>When the prisoner was brought before his judges, the charge
was read over to him, and he was called upon to plead. Witnesses
were then examined for the Crown. The prosecution was not
conducted by the Judge-Advocate, according to the practice of
Courts-martial in England, but was left in the hands of the
person who had made the charge. <a href="#note-223" name=
"noteref-223" id="noteref-223">{1}</a> The prisoner was left to
conduct his defence in like manner. At the conclusion of the
case, the Court was cleared, the Judge-Advocate and the officers
deliberated over their verdict, and as soon as they had made up
their minds about it, the doors were thrown open again and
sentence was pronounced in public. In cases not involving the
punishment of death, a verdict of the majority was sufficient;
but where the charge was capital&#8212;and nearly every criminal
charge was capital in those days&#8212;the concurrence of five
members of the Court was necessary before the sentence could be
carried out. Where less than five concurred, the proceedings had
to be sent to the Home Government for their consideration. The
Governor's warrant was a necessary preliminary to an execution;
but he was empowered by his commission to grant a pardon in any
case, "treason and wilful murder only excepted", and also, on
extraordinary occasions, to reprieve a prisoner until final
instructions were received from England. <a href="#note-224"
name="noteref-224" id="noteref-224">{2}</a></p>
<p>The Court was expressly limited to two forms of
punishment&#8212;in capital cases death or flogging, and in
others, flogging only. No sentence of imprisonment instead of the
lash could be passed, nor was there power to impose a fine. A
power to impose fines would have been useless in the early days
of the settlement, because the prisoners would not have had the
means of paying them; and for a similar reason, terms of
imprisonment could not be well imposed, seeing that there was no
gaol in which the time could be served. To meet the latter
difficulty, prisoners were frequently sent for punishment to the
islands in the harbour, and subsequently to Norfolk Island. That
course was adopted by Phillip in many instances, and would
probably have been adopted in many more, if he had had the
necessary authority and the means to enforce his own views on the
subject; exile to an island being, from the first, his ideal form
of penal discipline.</p>
<p>While the Criminal Court was evidently formed on the basis of
the Court-martial in England, it was essentially different both
in its constitution and its practice. The first and most
important point in which this difference appears is the position
of the Judge-Advocate. In England, that office was held by a
lawyer whose duty it was, not to preside as a judge, but to
conduct the case and to advise the Court on legal points,
especially points of evidence. The strictly judicial duties were
discharged by the President of the Court; but as the person
appointed to that office was usually a military man, he was not
professionally qualified to deal with legal questions. Trial by
Court-martial, in England, was substantially conducted according
to the rules of the common law; and consequently it was necessary
that the Court should be properly advised on such matters of law
as might arise before it. That was the province of the
Judge-Advocate. He had no voice or vote so far as the judgment of
the Court was concerned, either on the main question or on
interlocutory points; he could only advise. Besides acting as
prosecutor for the Crown, he was also supposed to assist the
prisoner in his defence, in the same manner that judges in the
ordinary Criminal Courts are said to be of counsel for him. By
this means a fair trial was ensured for the prisoner; so far at
any rate that no advantage was taken of him in the examination of
witnesses or in the discussion of legal questions. <a href=
"#note-225" name="noteref-225" id="noteref-225">{3}</a></p>
<p>The Judge-Advocate of the Court created by the Letters Patent
of 1787 bore very little resemblance to the Judge Advocate of the
English Courts. The first person appointed to the office being a
captain of marines, he was not in a position to discharge the
duties of a legal adviser. The Court was consequently under the
necessity of administering the law without any legal advice
whatever. Being expressly required by the Letters Patent to act
"according to the laws of England", some knowledge of those laws
was evidently presumed; but it is not easy to understand how a
Court composed exclusively of military and naval officers could
be expected to administer such an intricate system of
jurisprudence as "the laws of England". <a href="#note-226" name=
"noteref-226" id="noteref-226">{4}</a> The ordinary Court-martial
was properly composed of such materials, because the offences
tried before it were simply breaches of military discipline, the
punishment for which was regulated by military law. But here the
Court was empowered to deal with the whole range of the criminal
law, including both common and statute law; and the trials,
moreover. were conducted by a judge who was required to act as a
prosecutor and a juryman at the same time. Collins was satisfied
that "when the state of the colony and the nature of its
inhabitants are considered, it must be agreed that the
administration of public justice could not have been placed with
so much propriety in any other hands". <a href="#note-227" name=
"noteref-227" id="noteref-227">{5}</a> No doubt it would have
been a matter of some difficulty to establish, at the foundation
of a colony, a Court of Justice strictly modelled according to
English precedent. A jury of twelve men, free from all Crown
influence, presided over by a judge learned in the law and
equally independent of the Crown, forms the essential feature of
an English Court of Justice; but such a jury could not have been
got together in the early years of the colony, seeing that there
were no free settlers at that period. That was one of the
unfortunate results of the system on which the colony was
founded. Every person charged with an offence was brought before
a tribunal, the judge of which knew nothing of law, while he was
not only a judge but a juryman; the other members of the Court
being officers in the pay of the Crown, whose notions of justice
were derived from their knowledge of Courts-martial. "He is
brought before a Court", says Collins, "composed of a judge and
six men of honour, who hear the evidence both for and against
him, and determine whether the crime exhibited be or be not made
out." To hear evidence is one thing, and to weigh it is another;
and unless the evidence taken before the Judge-Advocate's Court
was carefully weighed in every instance according to law, how
could he be satisfied that the crime was made out in any
case?</p>
<p>But the weighing of evidence is a branch of mental analysis
for which the usual training of soldiers and sailors furnishes no
qualifications. The danger, to which Courts-martial are
peculiarly liable, of arriving at wrong conclusions at the trial
of criminal charges, was painfully illustrated in a case
mentioned by Sir Samuel Romilly. A sailor was tried by
Court-martial in October, 1806, on a charge of mutiny, alleged to
have been committed by him nine years previously, when he was a
boy of sixteen. There was only one witness for the prosecution,
who swore positively that he had seen the prisoner taking an
active part in the mutiny; but at the same time he admitted that
he had not seen the accused since that time. The latter read a
written statement in defence, in which he begged for mercy on
account of his youth. He was sentenced to be hanged, and was
executed accordingly ten days after the trial. The case
subsequently came before the Attorney-General and Romilly, then
Solicitor-General; and from inquiries which they instituted, it
was clearly proved that the man was innocent. "He had applied to
another man to write a defence for him; and he had read it,
thinking it calculated to excite compassion, and more likely to
save him than a mere denial of the fact." <a href="#note-228"

<h3>1.19 CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>TO</small> understand the principles on which the
criminal laws were administered by the Judge-Advocate's Court
during the early years of the colony, it is necessary to
recollect what those laws were in England throughout the same
period. The progress of reform during the present century has
brought about so many and such radical changes in the
administration of justice, that we are apt to look back upon the
proceedings of the Judge-Advocate's Court as if they formed an
abnormal and unsightly excrescence on the fair body of English
jurisprudence. Apart from the summary method in which the
business of the Court was transacted, the want of all proportion
between crime and its punishment seems in most cases to have been
so excessive, that the severity of the law is usually attributed
to the personal disposition of those who administered it. They
have been regarded as the originators of a system under which all
notions of justice and humanity were carefully excluded from view
when an offender was brought up for trial; as if the infliction
of some brutal punishment for its own sake was the solo aim and
end of their proceedings. The cruel tortures of the lash are
supposed to have been recklessly inflicted, and the hangman's
rope to have been brought into requisition with almost as little
scruple as the dreaded scourge.</p>
<p>The fact is, however, that the founders of the colony were
hardly more responsible for the severity of the law than they
were for the conditions of the atmosphere they had to breathe.
The criminal laws which they brought with them from England had
been put on board their ships, so to speak, like the salt pork
and the weevilly flour; and they had to make the best of them.
Bad as they were, they were still the laws of England, and the
punishments which they entailed on offenders were not&#8212;as
they often appear to be&#8212;the inventions of malignant
gaolers, but the deliberate judgment of the Legislature. Long
after Phillip had retired from the scene of his struggles, the
laws which imposed the terrible sentences then in vogue remained
in force in England. It was a capital offence, for instance, to
pick a pocket&#8212;technically called "stealing privately from
the person"; a capital offence to steal privately in a shop goods
to the value of five shillings; to steal goods to the amount of
forty shillings in a dwelling-house or on a navigable river; to
steal linen from a bleaching-ground; to break and enter a
dwelling-house; to steal a letter; to steal a horse, an ox, or a
sheep; to be found begging, if a soldier or a sailor; to return
to England after having been transported, if the term had not
expired; to destroy any tree, plant, or shrub in a garden; to
hunt any deer unlawfully; to appear armed, or with the face
blacked or otherwise disguised, in any forest, warren, or place
where hares or rabbits were usually kept, or on any high road,
open heath, or common. The great number of offences of this
description which had been declared to be capital felonies seems
to have astonished even Blackstone, who loved to extol the
humanity of the laws of England. He pointed out in 1769 that
"among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to
commit, no less than one hundred and sixty have been declared by
Act of Parliament to be felonies without benefit of clergy."
<a href="#note-229" name="noteref-229" id=
"noteref-229">{1}</a></p>
<p>To realise the state of mind in which Phillip looked at the
question of crime and punishment, we have only to picture to
ourselves the scenes with which he had become familiar during his
career in England, before he took command of the Expedition. From
1755, when he entered the navy, to 1787, when he sailed with the
First Fleet, the criminal system of the last century may be said
to have been in full bloom; and although most of Phillip's time
was passed at sea, his visits to England, to say nothing of his
residence in the New Forest as a country gentleman, gave him
opportunities enough for seeing those peculiar spectacles which
justified Charles Knight in describing London at that time as
"the City of the Gallows." In going up the Thames, for instance,
the traveller would probably see the gibbet standing on its
banks, with the remains of mutineers, or persons who had
committed murder on the high seas, hanging from them in chains.
<a href="#note-230" name="noteref-230" id="noteref-230">{2}</a>
One of the docks in London was called Execution Dock, because
criminals of that class were usually condemned to suffer there.
After they had been hanged, their bodies were cut down and
removed to the gibbets on the banks of the Thames, where they
were left to hang in chains. If he entered London by
Oxford-street, Tyburn tree would certainly attract his attention,
especially when ten or twelve criminals were about to suffer in
the presence of a crowd of people gathered round it, indulging
themselves in the sports and pastimes usual on such occasions.
<a href="#note-231" name="noteref-231" id="noteref-231">{3}</a>
If he passed over any of the heaths, commons, or forests which
then surrounded London&#8212;say Blackheath, Wimbledon, or
Finchley Common&#8212; a gibbet with a highwayman hanging in
chains would probably form a conspicuous feature of the
landscape. Even in the crowded streets of the city, he might have
seen the gallows standing with its dreadful pendant. <a href=
"#note-232" name="noteref-232" id="noteref-232">{4}</a> In 1786,
a scaffold was erected opposite a house in Charlotte-street,
Rathbone Place, formerly inhabited by an attorney who had been
murdered in it. The murderer was hanged in front of it, according
to the prevalent custom of inflicting punishment on the spot
where the crime had been committed. Seven years afterwards, a
burglar was ordered for execution in Hatton Garden, near the
house he had robbed; but having escaped execution by suicide, his
body was exhibited in the neighbourhood, "extended upon a plank
on the top of an open cart, in his clothes and fettered".
<a href="#note-233" name="noteref-233" id="noteref-233">{5}</a>
This, perhaps the most loathsome practice of the time, continued
for many years afterwards. A similar case occurred in 1811, when
the cart containing the suicide's body was preceded by a long
procession composed of constables who cleared the way with their
staves, a newly organised horse patrol with drawn swords, parish
and peace officers, and the high constable of the county of
Middlesex on horseback. <a href="#note-234" name="noteref-234"
id="noteref-234">{6}</a> After the Lord George Gordon riots of
1780, the gallows was carried about from street to street of the
city, and the condemned men were hanged on the spot pointed out
by the witnesses as the scene of their outrages.</p>
<p>During the year in which Phillip sailed with the First Fleet,
the number of persons executed in England was one hundred and
one; crime at that time having apparently risen to its highest
level. In the twelve years between 1771 and 1783, no less than
four hundred and sixty-seven persons were hanged in London and
Middlesex&#8212;an average of rather less than forty per annum.
During the twenty-three years from 1749 to 1772, the number of
persons condemned to death at the Old Bailey was one thousand one
hundred and twenty-one, of whom six hundred and seventy-eight
suffered death&#8212;a yearly average of less than thirty.
<a href="#note-235" name="noteref-235" id="noteref-235">{7}</a>
These figures relate to London only; they do not include the
cases in the country towns to which the judges went on circuit at
the Assizes. Executions were, comparatively, almost as common in
the country as they were in the metropolis. The Lent Assizes of
1785 were followed by nine at Kingston, nine at Lincoln, and nine
at Gloucester, seven at Warwick, six at Exeter, six at
Winchester, and six at Salisbury, five at Shrewsbury, and so on
all over the country. The total number of capital sentences in
England for that year was two hundred and forty-two, out of which
there were one hundred and three executions. <a href="#note-236"
name="noteref-236" id="noteref-236">{8}</a></p>
<p>London itself stood without a rival among all the capital
cities of Europe in its display of public executions, just as it
did in the abominations of prison life. The contrast between the
criminal laws of England and those of other countries in Europe
may be seen in the facts mentioned by Howard. When in Amsterdam
on his tour of inquiry among the prisons of Europe, he found that
during the eight years before his arrival there in 1783, only
five criminals had been executed out of a population of two
hundred and fifty thousand&#8212;about one-third of that of
London. <a href="#note-237" name="noteref-237" id=
"noteref-237">{9}</a> In all the seven provinces which
constituted the Dutch Republic, there were seldom more than five
or six executions in the course of a year. These statistics are
quite enough to justify Sir James FitzStephen's statement that
the English people during the last century were, as a rule,
"singularly reckless about taking human life." <a href=
"#note-238" name="noteref-238" id="noteref-238">{10}</a> Many
allusions to this peculiar characteristic of the nation might be
quoted from the literature of the last century. Sheridan
illustrated it with his usual point when he asked, during the
debate on a bill making it capital to destroy any tree, shrub, or
plant in a garden&#8212;"was it under the pretence of protecting
nursery grounds that they proposed to make it felony in a
schoolboy to rob an orchard, or was it contended that gooseberry
bushes ought to be fenced round with gibbets?"</p>
<p>It was to this recklessness about taking human life that the
practice of duelling owed its popularity throughout the same
period. The laws made to prevent it were evaded, the Courts
winked at it when they could, and the opinion of
Parliament&#8212;no doubt in harmony with that of society&#8212;
seemed to be rather in its favour than otherwise. In the course
of a debate in the House of Commons on the duel between the Earl
of Shelburne and Mr. Pullarton in 1780, one member
asked:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Did the honorable gentleman think that any order or
resolution of the House, that any Act of the Legislature, could
prevent a gentleman going out, as it was termed, with another, if
he felt his honor injured? Had gentlemen so soon forgot that
there were Acts of Parliament against duelling now in being? The
very attempt to prevent one man fighting with another was absurd,
because it was impossible, by any regulation of Parliament, to
prevent it.</blockquote>
<p>To which Burke replied that the right honorable gentleman
could not surely imagine that he was so absurd as to attempt to
make laws for the restraint of the human feelings and passions.
<a href="#note-239" name="noteref-239" id="noteref-239">{11}</a>
He, therefore, saw nothing particularly reprehensible in the
practice; for either he had nothing to say against it, or he
thought it prudent to refrain from expressing his opinion. Pitt
and Fox each fought his duel.</p>
<p>There were other exhibitions of human suffering to be seen in
Phillip's time even more horrible than that of men hanging from
the scaffold in public places. The old law under which women were
burned as well as hanged for petit treason&#8212;that is, for
killing a husband or a master, or for coining&#8212;was not
abolished till 1789. In the year before, it was put in force
against a woman convicted of coining; but out of consideration
for her sex, she was first strangled and then burned. Having been
tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stake,
the steps on which she stood were drawn away and she was left
hanging; a chain attached to the stake was then fastened round
her body; two cartloads of wood were piled about her, and after
she had hung for half an hour the fire was kindled. The flames
soon burned the halter, when the body fell a few inches and hung
by the iron chain. This scene took place in front of Newgate
Gaol, in the presence of the usual crowd. Other executions of the
same kind took place in 1767, 1750, and 1726. In the last case
the woman was burned alive. "The fire reaching the hangman's
hands, he let go the rope by which she was to have been
strangled, and the flames slowly consumed her as she pushed the
blazing faggots from her, rending the air with her agonised
cries." <a href="#note-240" name="noteref-240" id=
"noteref-240">{12}</a></p>
<p>These were not the only cruel forms of punishment to which
women were subjected during the same period. They were frequently
ordered to be flogged or whipped, sometimes at the cart's tail in
public, and sometimes in prison. In 1764, for instance, a woman
was three times conveyed in a cart from Clerkenwell Bridewell to
Enfield, and publicly whipped at the cart's tail by the common
hangman. The offence for which she suffered was "cutting down and
destroying wood in Enfield Chase"&#8212;probably to light her
fire. <a href="#note-241" name="noteref-241" id=
"noteref-241">{13}</a> Women were not only whipped by order of
Court for the offences they had committed, but they were punished
in the same manner while in prison at the discretion of the
authorities. A whipping-post was set up in every prison yard, and
they were mercilessly castigated at it for neglect of duty or
insubordination; the punishment being inflicted on their bare
backs. This form of punishment lasted till 1820.</p>
<p>Female offenders seem to have been treated with quite as much
severity as the men, if not with more; they were not only burned
as well as hanged, not only flogged in public as well as in
private, but they were heavily ironed and often left in gaol
without clothes enough to preserve common decency. Phillip's
letters describe the condition of the women put on board the
transports in 1787 as disgusting; they were very filthy and
almost naked; and notwithstanding his repeated requests for
clothing, they were allowed to sail without it&#8212;a neglect
which seems to have been quite in keeping with official practice
long after the sailing of the First Fleet. When Mrs. Fry began
her visits to the female prisoners in Newgate in 1813, she found
them all in the state described by Phillip. Even before they were
lodged in gaol, they were shamefully neglected and
ill-treated.</p>
<blockquote>Many were brought to the prison almost without
clothes. If coming from a distance, as in the case of convicts
lodged in Newgate until embarkation, they were almost invariably
ironed, and often cruelly so. One lady saw the female prisoners
from Lancaster Castle arrive, not merely handcuffed, but with
heavy irons on their legs, which had caused swelling and
inflammation. Others wore iron hoops round their legs and arms,
and were chained to each other. On the journey, these poor souls
could not get up or down from the coach without the whole of them
being dragged together. <a href="#note-242" name="noteref-242"
id="noteref-242">{14}</a></blockquote>
<p>If this was the manner in which females were treated in 1813,
it is safe to infer that they did not meet with more
consideration in 1787. The women put on board the First Fleet had
no doubt been dragged about the country in irons from the time
they left the gaols till they were delivered on board the ships
at Portsmouth.</p>
<p>The practice of putting prisoners of both sexes in irons, even
before their trial, had been long established, although it was
known to be illegal&#8212;so far at least as concerned persons
awaiting trial. <a href="#note-243" name="noteref-243" id=
"noteref-243">{15}</a> The only excuse that could be offered for
it was, that it was difficult to prevent the escape of prisoners,
unless they were loaded with clanking irons, owing to the
insecurity of the buildings in which they were confined. This
cruelty was not only practised in the case of persons actually in
gaol, but those who were on their way to it were subjected to the
same hardship. There were no police vans or any other vehicles of
the kind to convey them from Court to prison; they were marched
through the streets in gangs, handcuffed to one another, or
linked to a long chain, men and women alike. Anyone who had money
to pay for a vehicle might have one, provided the escort warder
thought fit to make such a concession, or was honest enough to
get the vehicle after receiving the money. Prison vans did not
come into use until 1827, when "caravans", as they were called,
were introduced. <a href="#note-244" name="noteref-244" id=
"noteref-244">{16}</a></p>
<p>Flogging was a popular form of punishment from very early
times in England. It was freely administered to all kinds of
petty offenders&#8212;thieves, prostitutes, street brawlers,
rogues and vagabonds; the punishment taking place sometimes in
public and sometimes in the gaols. When it took place in public
the offender was tied to a cart's tail and flogged through the
streets, or at the market-place. In the time of Elizabeth, the
whipping-post was an established institution in every town and
village. The municipal records contain frequent allusions to the
practice. The fee paid to the officer of justice was usually
fourpence in each case. Sometimes women were employed to whip
offenders of their own sex. By an Act passed in the reign of
Elizabeth, every vagabond was to be publicly whipped and then
sent to the parish where he was born; and the law remained in
force till the reign of Anne. The poet Cowper, in one of his
letters, describes the flogging of a young thief through the town
of Olney. In London, the principal places for punishment of this
description appear to have been the Bridewells, or houses of
correction. The spectacle was open to the public and was largely
attended by sightseers. De Foe has described the scene with
characteristic force in his Life of Colonel Jack. According to
the practice of the time, the men and women taken into custody by
the watch were brought before the magistrates and usually
committed to Bridewell. They were then brought before the Court
of Governors on their usual sitting day; the offence in each case
was stated by the beadles, and the Court gave its decision,
generally to the effect that the offenders should be corrected on
the spot. The beadles at once prepared the culprits for
punishment by stripping their clothes off, and the flogging was
administered until the president thought proper to stop it, which
he did by rapping with a hammer on the table. At the close of
this ceremony, the prisoners were handed over to the officials to
pass the term of their imprisonment in beating hemp. <a href=
"#note-245" name="noteref-245" id="noteref-245">{17}</a></p>
<p>The practice of flogging in the army and navy was carried to
an extreme in Phillip's time which seems incredible in the
present day. The most notorious instance of excessive punishment
will be found in the trial of Governor Wall, who was executed in
1802 for having caused the death of a sergeant named Armstrong at
Goree, an island off the African coast, twenty years previously.
According to the statement made by the Attorney-General at the
trial, Armstrong's offence consisted in his having gone with
several other soldiers to the paymaster's house for a settlement
of their claims. Although he was not guilty of any mutinous or
disrespectful conduct. Wall, who was commandant of the garrison,
without any form of trial or inquiry, ordered him to be punished
with eight hundred lashes, and personally superintended the
flogging. The unfortunate man was stripped and tied to a
gun-carriage, and two black men were employed to flog him with a
rope one inch in diameter. He died in hospital five days
afterwards. <a href="#note-246" name="noteref-246" id=
"noteref-246">{18}</a></p>
<p>Although there was no doubt that Wall deserved punishment,
there was at least one consideration that might have been urged
in support of his plea for mercy. He was the victim of a vicious
system which had established itself in the army and navy, under
which it had become a common practice among commanders in both
services to inflict punishment on their own authority, without
the intervention of any Court-martial. Romilly mentions a case
which was brought before the Privy Council while he was
Solicitor-General in Fox's administration of 1806. A lieutenant
in the navy was charged with the murder of three seamen at Bombay
in the year 1801. They had been flogged without any Court-martial
having been held on them; and the punishment was inflicted with
such horrible severity that they all three died in less than
twenty-four hours after it was over. In the course of the
examination before the Council, it appeared that it was not
uncommon for officers of the navy to inflict very severe
punishment on their own authority, without any Court-martial;
their idea being that it was lawful to do so. <a href="#note-247"
name="noteref-247" id="noteref-247">{19}</a></p>
<p>Two other instances are mentioned by Romilly which seem to
have originated in the same spirit of reckless indifference to
results. One was that of a soldier at Gibraltar "whose only
offence was that he had come dirty upon the parade", and who was
thereupon flogged with such severity that he died a few days
afterwards. In the other case, a man who had been thirty years in
the Guards, and who had been removed into the veteran battalion
in the Tower as a reward for his good conduct throughout that
time, was sentenced at the age of sixty to receive three hundred
lashes, "because he had been absent a day" from duty. <a href=
"#note-248" name="noteref-248" id="noteref-248">{20}</a> Romilly
does not state that these punishments were inflicted without
trial, but a charge of "appearing dirty on parade" would seem to
be rather beneath the dignity of a military Court. The
Courts-martial of the flogging days, however, did not stand much
upon their dignity in these matters. Any breach of discipline,
however slight, was sufficient to set the law in motion. In 1792,
a sergeant named Grant was sentenced to one thousand lashes for
having enlisted two drummers of the Coldstream Guards into the
East India Company's service. And in 1832, a private in the Scots
Greys was tried and sentenced to two hundred lashes "for highly
unsoldierlike conduct in dismounting without leave, when taking
his lesson in the riding-school, and absolutely refusing to
remount his horse when ordered to do so". Many other instances of
the same kind might be quoted.</p>
<p>The manner in which this form of punishment was administered
in the army is forcibly described by Sir Charles Napier.
Referring to the time when he was a subaltern, he
says:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I then frequently saw six hundred, seven hundred,
eight hundred, nine hundred, and a thousand lashes sentenced by
regimental Courts-martial; and generally every lash inflicted. I
have heard of twelve hundred having been inflicted, but never
witnessed such an execution. Even a General Court-martial cannot
do this now. Its sentence cannot exceed two hundred lashes. I
then often saw the unhappy victim of such barbarous work brought
out from the hospital three and four times to receive the
remainder of his punishment, too severe to be borne without
danger of death at one flogging; and sometimes I have witnessed
this prolonged torture applied for the avowed purpose of adding
to its severity. On these occasions it was terrible to see the
new tender skin of the scarcely healed back again laid bare to
receive the lash. I declare that, accustomed as I was to such
scenes, I could not on these occasions bear to look at the first
blows: the feeling of horror which ran through the ranks was
evident, and all soldiers know the frequent faintings that take
place among recruits when they first see a soldier
flogged.</blockquote>
<p>Some commanders appear to have studied flogging as an art,
with a view to the infliction of the greatest possible torture on
the victim:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have heard, and I have no doubt of the fact because
it was generally talked of and admitted to be so, though I never
saw it, that there were commanding officers who distributed the
lashes from the poll of the neck to the heel; thus flaying the
shoulders, posteriors, thighs, and calves of the legs,
multiplying the torment enormously; but I believe it was done,
and legally, too, according to the wording of the sentence which
ordered or permitted such cruelty.</blockquote>
<p>But even artistic flogging was effective only up to a certain
point:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have seen many hundreds of men flogged, and have
always observed that when the skin is thoroughly cut up, or
flayed off, the great pain subsides. Men are frequently convulsed
and screaming during the time they receive from one lash to three
hundred lashes, and they bear the remainder, even to eight
hundred or a thousand lashes without a groan; they will often lie
as if without life, and the drummers appear to be flogging a lump
of dead raw flesh. <a href="#note-249" name="noteref-249" id=
"noteref-249">{21}</a></blockquote>
<p>Bad as matters were in the army, they were even worse in the
navy. The captain of a ship afloat was practically judge and jury
in all cases; public opinion rarely or never reached him, and he
was consequently under no restraint in the exercise of his
powers; while the prospect of obtaining redress by complaint to
the Admiralty was too remote in those days to afford any
protection to the men under his command. But that was not
all:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>One lash in the navy was considered equivalent in
severity to several in the army; and although the lashes were
numbered by dozens instead of hundreds, twelve stripes afloat
were fully equal to a hundred on shore. This was partly owing to
the make and material of the cat, and also to the mode of
flogging. The naval cat was altogether more formidable than the
military one, being made out of a piece of rope thicker than a
man's wrist, five feet in length all over, three of which were
stiff and solid stuff, and the remaining two feet ravelled into
hard twisted and knotted ends. <a href="#note-250" name=
"noteref-250" id="noteref-250">{22}</a></blockquote>
<p>The sentence of a Court-martial was not considered a necessary
preliminary to the use of the cat on board a man-of-war. There
may be some exaggeration in the stories told by Marryat on the
subject; but if his narratives were not always founded on fact,
his descriptions were drawn from his own experience during the
years he was at sea. The story of the captain of an eighteen-gun
brig ordering five dozen lashes to be given to a seaman for
spitting on the quarter-deck, may be a humourous invention; but
it is nevertheless a good illustration of the manner in which
punishment was usually administered in the navy at that period.
It was inflicted not only by the captains and superior officers,
but by the boatswain and boatswain's mates, who carried rattans
or rope's ends to quicken the movements of the men. The practice
continued for many years after the close of the last century. The
agitation in Parliament for its abolition began in 1811; but it
was not until 1859 that corporal punishment in the navy was
restricted to cases of insubordination or other serious offences,
established before a Court of inquiry held by a captain and two
lieutenants. <a href="#note-251" name="noteref-251" id=
"noteref-251">{23}</a> The results of the abolition form an
unanswerable argument in favor of the reform. At no time in the
history of the army and navy was discipline better than it is in
the present day, when flogging is never heard of; a fact which
justifies the conclusion that discipline might have been
maintained in both services throughout the whole of the flogging
period without any recourse to that method of correction.</p>
<p>The temper of the age with respect to the question of crime
and its punishment may perhaps be best understood by reviewing
the efforts made to reform the existing system. During the
eighteenth century no serious or systematic effort was made for
that purpose; it is doubtful, indeed, whether the House of
Commons would have listened to any proposals of the kind. The
Lords would certainly have rejected item as summarily as they
would have negatived a motion to extend the franchise to the
working classes, or a bill to abolish the penal laws against the
Roman Catholics. The political speeches and memoirs of the time
are curiously silent on the subject. No member of either House
had ventured to take up the question as Romilly took it up in
later years. Not one of the many great speeches delivered by
Burke, Pox, Pitt, and Sheridan was devoted to the question. While
boys were frequently hanged in rows for offences for which they
would now be sent to reformatories, the great statesmen and
orators of the day looked on in silence. They appear to have
taken little or no interest in social problems, partly because
such questions were lost sight of in the greater attractions of
foreign affairs, culminating at one time in the war of American
Independence, and at another in the French Revolution; and partly
because politicians had not then learned to look upon the reform
of social evils as of paramount importance to the welfare of the
nation. During Pitt's eighteen years of office he might have
effected any changes in the administration of justice he pleased;
but he left it as he found it, not having effected, or even
sought to effect, any material changes in it whatever.</p>
<p>No statesman of the day was better qualified than Burke to
deal with such a subject; he had not only studied jurisprudence,
but he had an instinctive perception of its principles; and yet
in the whole circuit of his studies there is no evidence that he
had devoted any serious attention to the reform of a system which
he knew to be radically defective. <a href="#note-252" name=
"noteref-252" id="noteref-252">{24}</a> A casual reference to the
matter may be found here and there in his speeches, enough to
show that the tendency of his own mind was wholly opposed to the
barbarous code and revolting methods of punishment then in
existence; but at the same time it is equally clear that, for
reasons we can only conjecture, he refrained from touching the
work of reform. On one occasion during the year 1780, he was
roused from his apparent indifference by an occurrence which had
come under his notice "in the newspapers of that morning." Two
men had been put in the pillory the day before, and had been so
cruelly ill-treated that one of them was killed outright, while
the other was removed in a dying state. Burke's statement of the
facts was prefaced by the following remarks:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>In making criminal laws, it behoved them materially
to consider how they proceeded, to take care wisely and nicely to
proportion the punishment so that it should not exceed the extent
of the punishment, crime, and to provide that it should be of
that kind which was more calculated to operate as an example and
prevent crimes than to oppress and torment the convicted
criminal. <a href="#note-253" name="noteref-253" id=
"noteref-253">{25}</a></blockquote>
<p>He did not give the House his opinion as to the actual
proportion between crime and punishment, but rather left it to
infer that, as a rule, one was "wisely and nicely" proportioned
to the other. The case to which he referred might well have led
him to look a little further than the mere facts connected with
it. One of the victims being not only short but short-necked,
could not reach the hole in the pillory made for the head,
whereupon "the officers of justice" forced his head through the
hole, so that he hung rather than walked as the pillory went
round. The result was that he soon grew black in the face, and
the blood forced itself out of his nostrils, eyes, and ears.
Knowing the treatment he would probably receive from the mob when
he was exposed to their violence, he had begged hard for mercy
before his punishment began; but his plea was not listened to,
and he was immediately attacked with so much fury that the
officers, in order to save him, opened the machine, when he fell
down dead.</p>
<p>Burke spoke of this atrocious proceeding as "a melancholy
circumstance"&#8212;language he might have used had he been
speaking of someone who had fallen down stairs and broken his
leg. No one in his day could use the language of invective with
more effect; but on this occasion he contented himself with a
very mild remonstrance. He asked the House whether it would not
be right to abolish a mode of punishment liable to such
perversion, and intimated at the same time that if no man would
take the matter in hand, he would bring in a bill for the
purpose. But no bill was brought in for the purpose either by him
or by any other member. The Attorney-General said in reply that
he would require to consult the judges before he could interfere;
but the result of his consultations, if any, was never seen.
<a href="#note-254" name="noteref-254" id=
"noteref-254">{26}</a></p>
<p>If Burke was disposed to be silent on the subject of reform,
he was equally reserved as to the moral effect of such a system
of punishment on the masses. He saw clearly enough, no doubt,
that under the debasing influence of public exhibitions, men had
become not only indifferent to suffering, but had learned to look
on it as a source of amusement. Had it not been so, such a scene
could not have been witnessed in the streets of London. But it
would have been useless to raise any question as to the moral
result of an established system. It was the settled conviction of
society that exhibitions of the kind were necessary in order to
deter people from committing crime; just as the practice of
mutilating and branding offenders was retained for centuries in
the belief that it was the best means of producing a good moral
impression on the multitude.</p>
<p>Educated as he was under such influences as these, it is not
to be wondered at that Phillip brought with him to Sydney Cove
the current doctrine of his times. When, for instance, in the
heat of his indignation at a deliberate murder committed by the
natives at Botany Bay, he instructed Captain Tench, before
setting out on an expedition in search of the murderers, to "cut
off and bring in the heads of the slain, for which purpose
hatchets and bags would be provided", he was manifestly
influenced by the eighteenth century belief in the efficacy of
ghastly spectacles. His idea was that, by fixing the heads of the
natives on poles around the settlement, he would deter others
from committing similar outrages. The effect of such a spectacle
would probably have been just the reverse. The feeling of
repulsion provoked by exhibitions of that kind on minds not
accustomed to them was shown in the case already referred to,
when a convict was flogged in the presence of the natives. The
only result was to make them sympathise with the sufferer and
turn against those who punished him, whom they had not yet
learned to look upon as "the officers of justice."</p>
<p>The reform of the criminal law made no appreciable progress
until it was taken in hand by Sir Samuel Romilly, who identified
himself with the cause as zealously as Wilberforce devoted
himself to the abolition of the slave trade. Compared with his
design, however, Romilly's actual achievements were very limited;
the greatest consisted in having thoroughly awakened men's minds
on the subject, and so prepared the way for his successors. The
determined opposition he met with, even in places where he might
reasonably have looked for sympathy, if not with active
assistance, is enough to show the nature of the task he had
undertaken. In 1808, he succeeded in passing a bill to repeal the
old Act which punished pocket-picking with death; but he met with
very different results two years afterwards, when he introduced
bills to substitute transportation for death in cases of stealing
in shops or dwelling-houses. The bills were passed in the
Commons, but were thrown out by a majority of nearly three to one
in the Lords. Among those who opposed the stealing-in-shops bill
were seven bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury among them.
Romilly charitably supposed that they voted against his bill "out
of servility towards the Government"; because he was unwilling to
believe that they, "recollecting the mild doctrines of their
religion, could have come down to the House spontaneously to vote
that transportation for life is not a sufficiently severe
punishment for the offence of pilfering five shillings worth of
property, and that nothing but the blood of the offender could
afford an adequate atonement for such a transgression." <a href=
"#note-255" name="noteref-255" id="noteref-255">{27}</a></p>
<p>It was not necessary to impute servility to the bishops in
order to account for their votes. They may be credited with
having acted conscientiously, seeing that their opinions
coincided with those of distinguished law lords, refined moral
philosophers and other eminent persons, including the members of
the Perceval Government. Perhaps the most popular as well as the
most authoritative work on moral and political philosophy in
their days was Paley's, originally published in 1785; and Paley
not only approved of but applauded the criminal laws of his time,
as the best possible method of administering penal justice. His
view was that the law of England, by the number of statutes
creating capital offences, swept into the net every crime which
under any possible circumstances might merit the punishment of
death; but that when the execution of the sentence came under the
consideration of the Executive, a small proportion only of each
class of offenders was singled out to serve as examples to the
rest. By this means, while few criminals actually suffered death,
"the tenderness of the law" could not be taken advantage of by
others. The happy result so arrived at proved "the wisdom and
humanity" of the the design. <a href="#note-256" name=
"noteref-256" id="noteref-256">{28}</a></p>
<p>To minds fed on such diet as that, any proposals for reform,
which had the appearance of relaxing the iron grasp of the law,
seemed to be so many dangerous innovations, threatening the
security of property and therefore the foundations of society.
Proposals for the education of the poor in public schools were
looked at in much the same light and met with almost as much
opposition. Every other movement in the direction of
reform&#8212;we might, perhaps, except John Howard's agitation
for the improvement of the prisons&#8212;met with a similar fate.
It was sufficient to stigmatise any scheme for reform as an
"innovation" in order to enlist against it every one who believed
in things as they were, instead of things as they should be. Even
the proposal to do away with the procession to Tyburn met with
opposition; and the kind of argument which was considered good
logic in 1783 may be seen in Dr. Johnson's remarks on the
subject:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"The age is running mad after innovation; and all the
business of the world is to be done in a new way; men are to be
hanged in a new way; Tyburn itself is not safe from the fury of
innovation." It having been argued that this was an
improvement:&#8212; "No, sir," said he, eagerly, "it is
<i>not</i> an improvement: they object that the old method drew
together a number of spectators. Sir, executions are intended to
draw spectators. If they do not draw spectators, they don't
answer their purpose. The old method was most satisfactory to all
parties; the public was gratified by a procession; the criminal
was supported by it. Why is all this to be swept
away?"</blockquote>
<p>To which Boswell thought it necessary to add:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I perfectly agree with Dr. Johnson on this head, and
am persuaded that executions now, the solemn procession being
discontinued, have not nearly the effect which they formerly had.
Magistrates, both in London and elsewhere, have, I am afraid, in
this had too much regard to their own ease. <a href="#note-257"
name="noteref-257" id="noteref-257">{29}</a></blockquote>
<p>While Phillip and his immediate successors in office have been
unsparingly criticised here for the apparent severity with which
the law was administered during their time, it is clear that, in
the eyes of their contemporaries in England, their administration
would probably have been considered rather too lenient than
otherwise. The prerogative of mercy was frequently exercised by
Phillip, and his example was followed by Hunter and King. A
striking illustration of English opinion on the subject presents
itself in a letter written by Sir Joseph Banks to Governor King
in 1804, in which he referred to this matter with marked
emphasis:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>There is only one part of your conduct as Governor
which I do not think right&#8212;that is, your frequent
reprieves. I would have justice, in the case of those under your
command who have already forfeited their lives and been once
admitted to a commutation of punishment, to be certain and
inflexible, and no one instance on record where mere mercy, which
is a deceiving sentiment, should be permitted to move your mind
from the inexorable decree of blind justice. Circumstances may
often make clemency necessary&#8212;I mean those of suspected
error in conviction, but mere whimpering soft-heartedness never
should be heard.</blockquote>
<p>The plain inference from this language is, that every convict
who committed a second offence, for which he was liable to death
as the law then stood, should be hanged without mercy. We have
only to recall the long list of capital offences at that time to
understand what Sir Joseph meant by "the inexorable decree of
blind justice." Had he not been generally credited by those who
knew him with great generosity and kindliness of disposition,
such a stern denunciation of "whimpering soft-heartedness" might
be quoted as evidence of a very different character.</p>
<p>The current of public opinion with respect to the criminal law
may be seen in the kind of legislation that met with favour in
Parliament, as well as in that which met with no favour at all.
While it proved to be such a very difficult matter to repeal a
law inflicting death for a trifling offence, nothing seemed
easier than to pass an Act imposing it for a new one, however
trivial it might be. Romilly mentions that, during the session of
1816, a bill was introduced in the Commons by a colliery
proprietor making it a capital offence to destroy any machinery
employed in a colliery, although there was a law already in
existence to that effect. The bill attracted no attention in the
House, but passed through all its stages as a matter of
course&#8212;"as if the life of a man was of so little account
with us that anyone might at his pleasure add to the long list of
capital crimes which disgrace our statute books." <a href=
"#note-258" name="noteref-258" id="noteref-258">{30}</a> Burke
made the same remark thirty years before.</p>
<p>The laws in question were made for the protection of property,
and were made at the instance of property owners&#8212;
merchants, manufacturers, and country gentlemen&#8212;who held
seats in Parliament.</p>
<blockquote>A merchant or squire goes into the House of Commons
exasperated by the loss of his broadcloth or the robbery of his
fish, and immediately endeavours to restrain the crime by severe
penalties. Hence it is that, every man judging that to be the
most deadly offence by which he is himself a sufferer, the
Parliament has permitted the statute book to be loaded with the
penalty of death for upwards of two hundred offences. <a href=
"#note-259" name="noteref-259" id=
"noteref-259">{31}</a></blockquote>
<p>When Burke went down to Bristol in 1780 to address his
constituents, a portion of his speech was occupied with an
elaborate defence of his votes in favour of a bill introduced
into the House of Commons during the previous session, dealing
with the law relating to imprisonment for debt; It proposed to
restrict in some measure the unlimited debt, power, then
exercised by creditors, of detaining a debtor in prison as long
as the debt was unpaid. Reform of that kind was not in favour
among the commercial classes of Bristol, who probably regarded it
as calculated to prejudice their securities. The absurdity as
well as the injustice of the system was exposed by Burke in a few
sentences, which display his intuitive perception of principles.
In the first place, he said, every man was presumed by the law to
be solvent&#8212;a presumption quite at variance with facts; and
secondly, imprisonment for debt was inflicted, not because an
impartial judge considered it necessary, but because an
interested and irritated individual chose to demand it; the judge
being a passive instrument in his hands. To such an extent had
this abuse been carried that the gaols were everywhere crowded
with miserable debtors, and Parliament was frequently obliged to
interfere. For a long time previously, "Acts of Grace" had been
passed once, and latterly twice, in every Parliament, by which
the gaol-doors were thrown open and their inmates released. These
Acts were described as</p>
<blockquote>a dishonourable invention by which, not from
humanity, not from Policy, but merely because we have not room
enough to hold these Victims of the absurdity of our laws, we
turn loose upon the publick three or four thousand naked wretches
corrupted by the habits, debased by the ignominy of a
prison.</blockquote>

offenders usually executed at Tyburn may be gathered from the
following:&#8212;"Yesterday morning, about nine o'clock, the
following malefactors were brought out of Newgate and carried to
Tyburn in three carts, where they were executed according to
their sentences, viz.:&#8212;Henry Berthand, for feloniously
personating one Mark Groves, the proprietor of &#163;100 three
per cent. annuities, and transferring the same as if he was the
real owner thereof; William Jones, for stealing in a warehouse,
in Aldersgate-street, a deal box containing a quantity of
haberdashery goods; Peter Verrier, accomplice with Charles Kelly,
executed for burglary in the house of Mrs. Pollard, in Great
Queen-street; William Odern, for robbing two women in Spawfields;
Charles Woolett, for robbing Bernard John Cheale, on the highway,
of a metal watch; John Graham, for feloniously altering the
principal sum of a bank note of &#163;15, so as to make the same
appear to be a bank note of &#163;50, with intent to defraud;
Charlotte Goodall and John Edmonds, for stealing in the
dwelling-house of Mrs. Fortesque, at Tottenham, where she lived
as servant, a great quantity of plate, linen, &amp;c.; Thomas
Cladenboul, for assaulting Robert Chilton on the highway and
robbing him of a gold watch; John Weatherley and John Lafee, for
feloniously and treasonably coining and counterfeiting the silver
moneys of the realm called shillings and sixpences. They all
behaved very penitent."&#8212; London Evening Post, 9 October,

to cases of piracy or mutiny; the bodies of murderers and
highwaymen were usually hung in that manner. A murderer was
hanged in chains on Rock Island in 1796; Collins, vol. ii, p. 10.
The practice of hanging in chains had fallen into disuse in
England by 1832; out an attempt was made to revive it at that
date, when the Act for dispensing with the dissection of
criminals was passed. A clause was inserted to the effect that
the bodies of all prisoners convicted of murder should either be
hung in chains, or buried under the gallows on which they had
been executed, according to the discretion of the Court.</p>

Griffiths, vol. ii, p. 3. The number of executions in England
during the present century decreased from year to year,
notwithstanding the rapid increase of population. Mulhall's
Dictionary of Statistics gives the number executed in England and
Wales from 1801 to 1820 at one thousand six hundred and
ninety-seven, or eighty-five per annum; between 1821 and 1830,
the number was six hundred and seventy-two, or sixty-seven per
annum; and between 1831 and 1850, the number was three hundred
and sixty-five, or eighteen per annum; the total number for the
half-century being two thousand seven hundred and thirty-four.
The population of England had increased from 8,800,000 in 1801 to
18,000,000 in 1851. The population in 1780 was 8,000,000.</p>

History of the Criminal Law, vol. i, p. 478. The recklessness was
shown not only in the multitude of cases in which life was taken,
but in the manner of taking it. By an Act passed in 1752, for
instance, murderers were allowed but one clear day to prepare for
death; and after execution their bodies were handed over to the
surgeon for anatomical practice. The frequency of executions may
be gathered from the following:&#8212;<br>
<br>
John Townshend, a Bow-street officer examined before a Committee
of the House of Commons in 1816, relates in his evidence that
Lord Chief Justice Eyre once went the Home Circuit, beginning at
Hertford and finishing at Kingston, when crimes were so desperate
that in his charge to the Grand Jury at Hertford he told them to
be careful what bills they found, for he had made up his mind,
whatever persons were convicted throughout the circuit for
capital offences, to hang them all. And he kept his word; he
saved neither man nor woman. In one case seven people, four men
and three women, were convicted of robbing a pedlar in a house in
Kent-street. "They were all convicted," says Townshend, "and all
hanged in Kent-street opposite the door; and, I think, on
Kennington Common eight more, making fifteen; all that were
convicted were hung." And, generally, he observes in another part
of his evidence, "with respect to the present time and the early
part of my time, such as 1781-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, where there
is one person convicted now, I may say I am positively convinced
there were five then; we never had an execution wherein we did
not grace that unfortunate gibbet with ten, twelve to thirteen,
sixteen, and twenty."&#8212;Charles Knight, "London", vol. iv, p.

The tenderness of the law seems to have been an article of faith
with many men besides Blackstone and Paley. Burke, for instance,
in a speech delivered in the House of Commons in 1785, spoke of
England as "a country which prided itself on the mild and
indulgent principles of its laws"; and again, of "the mild spirit
and principles of the English laws." Post, p. 491.<br>
<br>
Paley furnishes a curious illustration of the "wisdom and
humanity" of the laws in another part of his work, in which he
treats of relative duties in connection with property. If, he
says, you should see a flock of pigeons in a field of corn,
ninety-nine of them gathering all they got into a heap for one,
and that the weakest, perhaps worst, of the flock; and if one of
them, more hardy or hungry than the rest, should touch a grain of
the hoard, and if all the others should instantly fly upon it and
tear it to pieces, you would see nothing more than what is every
day practised and established among men; "ninety and nine toiling
and scraping together a heap of superfluities for one, oftentimes
the feeblest and worst of the whole set; and if one of the number
take or touch a particle of the hoard, the others joining against
him and hanging him for the theft."</p>

<h3>1.20 THE CHRONICLES OF SYDNEY COVE.
<small>[1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> value of contemporary records in connection
with the foundation of a colony was fortunately recognised in the
official circle which surrounded Phillip; and thus it happened
that no less than four members of his staff devoted their
attention from the first to the work of recording in their
journals from day to day the various events of importance
connected with the work they had in hand. Captain Hunter, Captain
Tench, Judge-Advocate Collins, and Surgeon White, each kept his
diary faithfully, and each did so with a view to the publication
of its contents. Lieutenant King also entered in his note-books
the various incidents of the voyage out in the First Fleet, and
the proceedings at Norfolk Island during the time he was in
command there; but he did not write for publication, although his
Norfolk Island journal was published in Captain Hunter's volume.
Taken altogether, these records comprise a very full and varied
account of the "transactions" connected with Phillip's
expedition. Each was written from a different standpoint, and
consequently each presents the reader with a different view of
the events recorded. Their subsequent appearance in print
attracted very considerable attention, not only in England, but
on the Continent&#8212;a fact attested by the appearance of
successive editions as well as of several translations into
foreign languages. <a href="#note-260" name="noteref-260" id=
"noteref-260">{1}</a></p>
<p>The first publication which gave the English public an 1789
authentic account of the results of Phillip's expedition was the
book commonly known as Phillip's Voyage <a href="#note-261" name=
"noteref-261" id="noteref-261">{2}</a>&#8212;a handsome quarto
volume, "embellished with fifty-five copper-plates", which made
its appearance in the year 1789. It was practically an official
production, published by John Stockdale, of Piccadilly, the
well-known Government printer of the day. The historical part of
the work was based on the despatches received from Phillip, the
latest date being November, 1788; the rest of the matter being
made up partly of descriptive sketches of animals, birds, and
fishes, illustrated by hand-painted engravings; and partly of
accounts of voyages made by some of the transports on their
return from the colony to Batavia, England, and China. Phillip's
despatches, "which were liberally communicated by Government",
were written out with editorial decorations by the compiler for
the purpose of presenting a connected narrative of events. The
portion of the work devoted to natural history was apparently
done by several hands, and judging from the appearance of the
illustrations, few of them were drawn and coloured from real
life. The Voyage proved a very readable publication, and no doubt
made a good impression on the public mind with respect to the
prospects of the distant settlement. The work passed through
three editions in the course of the following year, and was
shortly afterwards translated into French and German. It contains
a curiosity in the shape of an "elegant. vignette" on the
title-page, representing Hope standing in classical attire on the
shores of Sydney Cove and addressing words of encouragement to
Art and Labour, attended by Peace. This vignette was engraved
from a medallion, "which the ingenious Mr. Wedgwood caused to be
modelled from a small piece of clay brought from Sydney Cove."
The clay had been sent by Phillip through Lord Sydney to Sir
Joseph Banks, and had been handed by him to Wedgwood for the
purpose of being chemically analysed. It was then pronounced "an
excellent material for pottery", and an opinion was expressed
that "it might certainly be made the basis of a valuable
manufacture for our infant colony." The idea thus suggested was
illustrated by the medallion; and in order to give further effect
to it, the aid of poetic inspiration was sought in the person of
Dr. Erasmus Darwin&#8212;"a mighty master of unmeaning rhyme", as
Byron called him, and an old friend of Wedgwood's&#8212;who wrote
the prophetic lines describing the "Visit of Hope to Sydney Cove,
near Botany Bay", published with the vignette in Phillip's
Voyage. <a href="#note-262" name="noteref-262" id=
"noteref-262">{3}</a></p>
<p>The next publication in order of date was Captain Tench's
Narrative of the Expedition&#8212;a small octavo published in
1789, the author's introduction being dated from Sydney Cove,
July 10, 1788. In offering his little tract&#8212;as he called
it&#8212;to the public. Tench remarked that it was his wish to
supply amusement as well as information; and it may be admitted
that he was not unsuccessful in his effort&#8212; his book being
pleasant reading, notwithstanding an occasional glimpse of the
gloomy times he lived in. He was evidently an observant
traveller, with a keen eye for a picture or a dramatic situation;
disposed to take a genial view of everything, as far as he could;
and much given to poetical quotations and good stories. <a href=
"#note-263" name="noteref-263" id="noteref-263">{4}</a> He had a
faculty for description of which he does not seem to have been
conscious, or he would have been tempted to make greater use of
it. The excitement on board the Fleet at Botany Bay, when the two
French ships suddenly appeared in the offing, can be seen at a
glance in the following lines:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The thoughts of removal [from Botany Bay to Port
Jackson] banished sleep, so that I rose at the first dawn of the
morning. But judge of my surprise on hearing from a sergeant who
ran down almost breathless to the cabin where I was dressing,
that a ship was seen off the harbour's mouth! At first I only
laughed, but knowing the man who spoke to me to be of great
veracity, and hearing him repeat his information, I flew upon
deck, on which I had barely set my foot, when the cry of "another
sail" struck on my astonished ear. Confounded by a thousand ideas
which arose in my mind in an instant, I sprang upon the
barricado, and plainly descried two ships of considerable size
standing in for the mouth of the bay. <a href="#note-264" name=
"noteref-264" id="noteref-264">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>In another passage. Tench mentions his first meeting with the
natives on the south shore of Botany Bay. He had scarcely landed
with his party, when he and his party were met by "a dozen
Indians, naked as at the moment of their birth":&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I had at this time a little boy, of not more than
seven years of age, in my hand. The child seemed to attract their
attention very much, for they frequently pointed to him and spoke
to each other; and as he was not frightened, I advanced with him
towards them, at the same time baring his bosom and showing the
whiteness of his skin. On the cloaths being removed, they gave a
loud exclamation, and one of the party, an old man with a long
beard, hideously ugly, came close to us. I bade my little charge
not to be afraid, and introduced him to the acquaintance of this
uncouth personage. The Indian, with great tenderness, laid his
hand on the child's hat and afterwards felt his cloaths,
muttering to himself all the while.</blockquote>
<p>The scene is suggestive of the allegorical representations
which used to be in vogue at the Court of the Faerie
Queene&#8212;Civilisation, in the form of a fair European child,
making its first appearance on the shores of a new world, and
advancing towards Barbarism in its decay, represented by an
ancient Indian gazing wistfully into the child's face, and
"muttering to himself all the while."</p>
<p>A few lines enable him to describe the troops and prisoners at
work on the shores of Sydney Cove, immediately after their
landing:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The scene, to an indifferent spectator at leisure to
contemplate it, would have been highly picturesque and amusing.
In one place, a party cutting down the woods; a second, setting
up a blacksmith's forge; a third, dragging along a load of stones
or provisions; here an officer pitching his marquee, with a
detachment of troops parading on one side of him, and a cook's
fire blazing up on the other. <a href="#note-265" name=
"noteref-265" id="noteref-265">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p>In the following year appeared Surgeon White's Journal of a
Voyage to New South Wales <a href="#note-266" name="noteref-266"
id="noteref-266">{7}</a>&#8212;another fine quarto, somewhat
resembling Phillip's Voyage in appearance and contents. Mr. White
had the great advantage of a taste for natural history, and was
consequently in a position to enliven as well as to illustrate
his pages by descriptions of the new world of animal and
vegetable life in which he found himself. The birds are
exceedingly well drawn and coloured; but a curious difference may
be noticed between the representations of the same specimens in
White's Journal and in Phillip's Voyage. The cassowary, the
parrots and the cockatoos, for instance, which adorn the two
volumes, have very little resemblance with each other when placed
side by side for comparison; and as they all purport to be drawn
and coloured from nature, it is not easy to account for the
difference. So far as the history of the settlement is concerned,
White's volume is not of much importance; the record of events
dates only to November, 1788, and does not travel beyond the
limits of an ordinary journal. It contains a good deal of
information, however, not to be found in the pages of his
contemporaries, and is consequently entitled to a permanent place
in our historical collections.</p>
<p>The good reception which his little Narrative seems to have
met with naturally induced Captain Tench to follow it up with a
rather more ambitious effort, which appeared in 1793&#8212;the
same year in which Captain Hunter's book was published. In his
later work&#8212;entitled "A Complete Account of the Settlement
at Port Jackson"&#8212;Tench gave the "transactions of the
colony" year by year as he had noted them in his journal,
followed by extracts from his "travelling diaries" relating to
his exploring expeditions; the rest of the book being occupied
with miscellaneous remarks on the climate, the soil and its
productions, and the natives. His pages may be read without any
sensation of weariness, being full of anecdote and character. The
unhealthy society which surrounded the author did not depress his
mind to such an extent as to render him insensible or indifferent
to better things. He seems to have kept up his spirits in spite
of it, and to have written with a light heart; graphically, too,
like an artist sketching the scenes around him with pencil and
brush. The result is that his reader has a succession of pictures
passing before him, which serve to illustrate the chronicle of
events. In this respect Tench stands alone among his
contemporaries. Although he had no talent for sketching, like
Hunter, his work is essentially picturesque. The difference
between his method and theirs may be seen in the fact that there
is hardly a line in the bulky volumes they produced that can be
said to give the reader any idea of Phillip as a man. There is no
attempt to outline his character in any way, either directly or
indirectly. Not a word, for instance, of the many conversations
which he had with the captain of the Sirius and the
Judge-Advocate is preserved in their pages. It is consequently
difficult to form any clear idea as to Phillip's individuality
from all that they relate of him. The only writer of that time
who brings him distinctly before us is Tench. When summoned to
attend him for the purpose of receiving instructions as to the
military expedition to punish the natives at Botany Bay, Tench
had a long conversation with him, and luckily reported some of
his remarks <a href="#note-267" name="noteref-267" id=
"noteref-267">{8}</a>:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>To the latter of these causes&#8212;misapprehension
on the part of the natives&#8212;I attribute my own wound; but in
this business of McEntire, I am fully persuaded that they were
unprovoked, and the barbarity of their conduct admits of no
extenuation, for I have separately examined the sergeant, of
whose veracity I have the highest opinion, and the two convicts;
and their story is short, simple, and alike. I have in vain tried
to stimulate Baneelon and Colbee, and the other natives who live
among us, to bring in the aggressor. Yesterday, indeed, they
promised me to do it, and actually went away as if bent on such a
design; but Baneelon, instead of directing his steps to Botany
Bay, crossed the harbour in his canoe in order to draw the
foreteeth of some of the young men; and Colbee, in the room of
fulfilling his engagement, is loitering about the look-out house.
Nay, so far from wishing even to describe faithfully the person
of the man who has thrown the spear, they pretended that he has a
distorted foot, which is a palpable falsehood. So that we have
our efforts only to depend upon; and I am resolved to execute the
prisoners who may be brought in, in the most public and exemplary
manner, in the presence of as many of their countrymen as can be
collected, after having explained the cause of such a punishment;
and my fixed determination to repeat it, whenever any future
breach of good conduct on their side shall render it
necessary.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip seems to have had some doubt in his own mind as to the
wisdom of these measures&#8212;which involved the destruction of
ten lives&#8212;for Tench goes on to say that&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Here the Governor stopped, and addressing himself to
me said, if I could propose any alteration in the orders under
which I was to act, he would patiently listen to me. Encouraged
by this condescension, I begged leave to offer for consideration
whether, instead of destroying ten persons, the capture of six
would not better answer all the purposes for which the expedition
was to be undertaken; as out of this number a part might be set
aside for retaliation, and the rest, at a proper time, liberated
after having seen the fate of their comrades, and being made
sensible of the cause of their own detention. This scheme his
excellency was pleased instantly to adopt, adding, "If six cannot
be taken, let this number be shot. Should you find it practicable
to take so many, I will hang two, and send the rest to Norfolk
Island for a certain period, which will cause their countrymen to
believe that we have dispatched them secretly."</blockquote>
<p>Here we get a good illustration of Phillip's way of dealing
with matters requiring energy as well as promptness of decision;
and at the same time his views on the native question become as
distinctly perceptible as they are in his despatches. He had
evidently allowed his indignation at a wanton murder&#8212;as it
seemed to him&#8212;to overcome his judgment for the time; but
how ready he was to listen to any plea for mercy is seen in his
prompt concession to Tench.</p>
<p>The state of distress and consternation into which the
settlement was plunged when news arrived of the wreck of the
Sirius at Norfolk Island, and the subsequent rejoicing when a
ship at last arrived from England, are nowhere so well described
as in Tench's pages. <a href="#note-268" name="noteref-268" id=
"noteref-268">{9}</a> For months previously the non-arrival of
supplies had filled every mind with alarm, the stock of
provisions in the public store having become so small that the
rations had to be reduced to the lowest possible limit. In order
to relieve the pressure on the public resources, Phillip had
despatched the Sirius and Supply to Norfolk Island with several
hundred men and women on board; the Sirius being under orders to
sail to China, on her return, for supplies of salt provisions.
Her wreck increased the danger of the situation to a still more
serious point; for the only chance of saving the people from
starvation was to send the little brig Supply to Batavia. The
extent of the suffering endured at this crisis may be seen in the
following extract:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Three or four instances of persons who have perished
from want have been related to me. One only, however, fell within
my own observation. I was passing the provision store when a man,
with a wild haggard countenance, who had just received his daily
pittance to carry home, came out. His faltering gait and eager
devouring eye led me to watch him; and he had not proceeded ten
steps before he fell. I ordered him to be carried to the
hospital, where, when he arrived, he was found dead. On opening
the body, the cause of death was pronounced to be
inanition.</blockquote>
<p>When matters had reached this stage, nothing but the arrival
of a ship from England could have averted the most dreadful
consequences:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>A party of seamen were fixed on a high bluff called
the South Head, at the entrance of the harbour, on which a flag
was ordered to be hoisted whenever a ship might appear, which
should serve as a direction to her, and as a signal of approach
to us. Here, on the summit of the hill, every morning from
daylight until the sun sank, did we sweep the horizon in hope of
seeing a sail At every fleeting speck which arose from the bosom
of the sea, the heart bounded and the telescope was lifted to the
eye.</blockquote>
<p>They were in much the same plight as shipwrecked people
floating on a raft. The long-expected ship appeared at the very
moment when hope had given way to despair:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>At length the clouds of misfortune began to separate,
and on the evening of the 3rd of June, 1790, the joyful cry of
"the flag's up" resounded in every direction. I was sitting in my
hut, musing on our fate, when a confused clamour in the street
drew my attention. I opened my door, and saw several women with
children in their arms running to and fro with distracted looks,
congratulating each other, and kissing their infants with the
most passionate and extravagant marks of fondness. I needed no
more; but instantly started out and ran to a hill, where, by the
assistance of my pocket-glass, my hopes were realised. My
next-door neighbour, a brother officer, was with me; but we could
not speak: we wrung each other by the hand, with eyes and hearts
overflowing.</blockquote>
<p>It must have been a terrible pinch indeed that could make two
officers of marines in those days show such signs of emotion.</p>
<blockquote>Finding that the Governor intended to go immediately
in his boat down the harbour, I begged to be of his party. As we
proceeded, the object of our hopes soon appeared: a large ship,
with English colours flying, working in between the heads which
form the entrance of the harbour. The tumultuous state of our
minds represented her in danger, and we were in agony. Soon after
the Governor, having ascertained what she was, left us, and stept
into a fishing-boat to return to Sydney. The weather was wet and
tempestuous; but the body is delicate only when the soul is at
ease. We pushed through wind and rain, the anxiety of our
sensations every moment redoubling. At last we read the word
"London" on her stern. "Pull away, lads! She is from old England!
A few strokes more and we shall be aboard! Hurrah, for news from
our friends!"</blockquote>
<p>One of the most striking passages in Tench's work describes
the effect produced upon the minds of the natives by the flogging
of a prisoner. Although the man was punished for having stolen
some fishing tackle belonging to one of themselves, the only
effect of the exhibition was to create feelings of sympathy with
the offender and disgust at the exhibition itself:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The Governor ordered that he should be severely
flogged in the presence of as many natives as could be assembled,
to whom the cause of punishment should be explained. Many of
them, of both sexes, accordingly attended. There was not one of
them that did not testify strong abhorrence of the punishment and
equal sympathy with the sufferer.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip was anxious to show the natives that the law was no
respecter of persons; it did not occur to him that he was
exhibiting the law in a shape not at all calculated to create
respect for it, even in the minds of savages. The contrast
between the civilised and uncivilised codes on this point is
curious. Among the natives, a man who wronged another belonging
to the same tribe was compelled to stand and defend himself with
his shield, while his fellows hurled their spears at him. The
idea of flogging a man seemed to them a savage refinement of
cruelty. <a href="#note-269" name="noteref-269" id=
"noteref-269">{10}</a></p>
<p>Captain Hunter's book appeared as an official publication in
1793&#8212;a quarto, with maps and illustrations. <a href=
"#note-270" name="noteref-270" id="noteref-270">{11}</a> In every
way it was a creditable production, abounding in evidence of its
author's personal merit. Besides his own journal of the voyage
out with the First Fleet, of subsequent events at the settlement,
and of his voyage to Batavia and England, it includes Lieutenant
King's journal kept during his residence as Commandant at Norfolk
Island in 1788, and also his journal of a voyage to Batavia and
England; the history of the colony from June, 1790, to December,
1791, compiled from Governor Phillip's despatches; and it
concludes with the journal of a voyage in the Supply from Sydney
to England, written by her commander, Lieutenant Ball. Hunter's
narrative of events from the founding of the colony to his
departure in February, 1790, for Norfolk Island, where he was
wrecked, is well written, and forms a valuable chapter in the
annals of that time. His skill in sketching is shown in the View
of the Settlement on Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, 20th August,
1788, which faces page 77 of his volume. It is of peculiar
interest at the present day from the fact that it forms the
earliest illustration of the scene known to exist. Another sketch
of his appears as a vignette on the title-page, representing an
incident of the expedition to Broken Bay, in June, 1789, when the
Hawkesbury River was discovered. A young native woman was found
by the sailors hiding herself in the long grass, having been
unable to make her escape with her friends when they were alarmed
by the arrival of the white men. Hunter's account of the matter
brings Phillip personally on the scene <a href="#note-271" name=
"noteref-271" id="noteref-271">{12}</a>:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Information was immediately brought to the Governor,
and we all went to see this unhappy girl, whom we found just
recovered from the small-pox, and lame: she appeared to be about
seventeen or eighteen years of age, and had covered her
debilitated and naked body with wet grass, having no other means
of hiding herself; she was very much frightened on our
approaching her, and shed many tears, with piteous lamentations
We understood none of her expressions, but felt much concern at
the distress she seemed to suffer; we endeavoured all in our
power to make her easy, and with the assistance of a few
expressions which had been collected from poor Arabanoo while he
was alive, we soothed her distress a little, and the sailors were
immediately ordered to bring up some fire, which we placed before
her: we pulled some grass, dried it by the fire, and spread round
her to keep her warm; then we shot some birds, such as hawks,
crows, and gulls, skinned them, and laid them on the fire to
broil, together with some fish, which she eat; we then gave her
water, of which she seemed to be much in want, for when the word
"baa-do" was mentioned, which was their expression for water, she
put her tongue out to show how very dry her mouth was; and indeed
from her appearance and colour she had a considerable degree of
fever on her. Before we retired to rest for the night, we saw her
again, and got some firewood laid within her reach, with which
she might in course of the night recruit her fire; we also cut a
large quantity of grass, dried it, covered her well, and left her
to her repose, which, from her situation, I conjecture was not
very comfortable and refreshing.</blockquote>

<br>
<b>The Settlement At Sydney Cove</b></p>
<br>
<p>Phillip and his men spent the following day in exploring
Pittwater; but on their return in the evening, they lost no time
in looking after the poor girl they had left. Hunter goes on to
say:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Our tents were no sooner up than we went to visit our
young female friend, whom we found in a little bark hut upon the
beach; this hut was the place in which she and her friends were
enjoying themselves when the arrival of our boat alarmed them.
She was not alone as before, but had with her a female child,
about two years old, and as fine a little infant of that age as
ever I saw; but upon our approach (the night being cold and
rainy, and the child terrified exceedingly), she was lying with
her elbows and knees on the ground covering the child from our
sight with her body, or probably sheltering it from the weather,
but I rather think on account of its fears. The little infant
could not be prevailed on to look up; it lay with its face upon
the ground, and one hand covering its eyes. We supplied her as
before, with birds, fish, and fuel, and pulled a quantity of
grass to make her a comfortable bed, and covered her little
miserable hut so as to keep out the weather.</blockquote>
<p>The kindly feeling which animated Phillip and his friends in
their intercourse with the natives, could not be better
illustrated than it is in this passage; nor has the part of the
good Samaritan ever been more nobly played by British officers.
Phillip and Hunter were rough old sailors; they had been all
their lives at sea; but had they been shepherds with their crooks
in the days of pastoral poetry, they could not have shown a finer
feeling towards a damsel in distress. The facts, as told by
Hunter, deserve to rank among the pathetic tales of the
Australian bush; none the less touching because the central
figure happens to be carved in ebony. Incidents of this kind
should not be forgotten in estimating Phillip's character;
especially when we find it represented as wanting in the very
quality so conspicuously shown in this instance. <a href=
"#note-272" name="noteref-272">{13}</a></p>
<p>Last on the list of the old chronicles is the ponderous work
published by Judge-Advocate Collins in two quarto volumes, the
first of which appeared in 1798, <a href="#note-272">{13}</a> and the second in 1802.
<a href="#note-273" name="noteref-273">{14}</a>
There can be no doubt as to the value of the work for historical
purposes, seeing that it contains a mass of information with
respect to the colony which none of the writer's contemporaries
had been diligent enough to collect. But the merit of the
compilation is largely affected by the mistaken principle on
which the author worked, especially in the first volume. Instead
of writing an account of the colony, as his title-page expressed,
he wrote an account of a penal settlement&#8212;occupying himself
almost exclusively with the unhappy creatures who had been sent
to work out their redemption in chains. The impression left upon
the reader's mind is that of having waded through a lengthy
catalogue of crimes and their punishments, added to a dismal tale
of suffering and privation. From page to page he finds his
attention concentrated on the unsavoury details connected with
the early years of the settlement, almost everything that could
relieve the depth of shade in the picture being ignored. The
result is that he finds himself slowly descending from one bloomy
circle of the <i>Inferno</i> to another, each filled with a
succession of repulsive groups. There is little or nothing to
relieve the monotony of woe. There is not a word, for instance,
about the scenery of the harbour and the surrounding country,
which, by the way, seems to have left no other impression upon
Collins than one of loneliness and desolation. He found no such
source of encouragement as Phillip did in the prospect of future
greatness for the country, when the inevitable difficulties
attending the foundation of a colony had been overcome, and the
unbounded resources it contained had been fully developed by the
industry of successive generations. The work of exploration in
which Phillip, Hunter, Tench, and Dawes made themselves
conspicuous, had very little attraction for him. Although he
accompanied them on more than one occasion in their excursions,
he made very slight allusion to the matter in his book; in some
cases none at all. The discovery of the Hawkesbury did not by any
means inflame his imagination. He was a member of the expedition
which traced it up to Richmond Hill, and yet he disposed of the
whole matter in a paragraph as curt and dry as if he had been
describing the robbery of a cabbage-garden and the execution of
the thief. He makes no mention of the discovery of the Nepean,
beyond a passing allusion to "the freshwater river, first seen
some time since by Captain Tench, and supposed to be a branch of
the Hawkesbury." <a href="#note-274" name="noteref-274" id=
"noteref-274">{15}</a> But the discovery of those rivers was
undoubtedly a turning point in the history of the settlement, and
must have done much to dispel the doubts which had previously
hung over its future.</p>
<p>The monotonous tone of lamentation which marks so many of his
pages is mainly the result of a peculiar frame of mind, which led
him to concentrate his attention on the unpleasant side of every
picture placed before him. If an occasional gleam of humour had
lightened up his reflections on passing events, the narrative he
has left us would have been none the less faithful. But there is
no attempt at any time to deal pleasantly with the subject he has
in hand. He speaks sometimes like Virgil when conducting Dante
through the shades below; sometimes like a warder when showing an
inquisitive traveller through the corridors of a gaol, stopping
now and then at the doors of a cell to tell the dreadful story of
its inmate. Even when a fair opportunity comes in his way for
amusing himself and his readers with the scenes and topics to
which he alludes, he seems to turn away from it, as if the bare
suspicion of a jest would compromise his judicial dignity. Any
other writer in his place, suffering from a dearth of subjects
free from any criminal flavour, might have welcomed the
phenomenon recorded by him with respect to the breeding
operations of the settlement. "It was observed with concern," he
says (p. 76), "that hitherto by far a greater proportion of males
than females had been produced by the animals we had brought for
the purpose of breeding." This fact he does not attempt to
account for; he has no turn for speculation. He contents himself
with saying that "this, in any other situation, might not have
been so nicely remarked; but here, where a country was to be
stocked, a litter of twelve pigs whereof three only were females
became a subject of conversation and inquiry." It did not occur
to Collins, or any of his friends, that the pigs were only
carrying out the principle on which Lord Sydney had acted in
populating the colony&#8212;an excess of males to females, by
four to one. Another event which might have induced a less
serious chronicler to relax was the first performance of a play
by the convicts, "in a hut fitted up for the occasion." They were
allowed to amuse themselves in this manner on the occasion of his
Majesty's birthday in 1789, Farquhar's comedy&#8212;the
Recruiting Officer&#8212;being the piece selected. A sketch of
the performance, a copy of the prologue, or any other information
of the kind, might well have found a place in the chronicler's
papers; but he confines himself to the remark that the performers
"professed no higher aim than 'humbly to excite a smile,' and
their efforts to please were not unattended with success."</p>
<p>Collins having left the colony in September, 1796, and
remained in England until he received his commission as
Lieutenant-Governor of the projected colony at Port Phillip in
1803, the materials for the second volume of his work, published
in 1802, were necessarily furnished by another hand; but whose
the hand that furnished them was not mentioned by him, and
consequently the authorship of the second volume was never made
known. There is no difficulty, however, in discovering the
author; internal evidence being quite sufficient to show that the
journal which forms the contents of the volume was written by
Governor Hunter. He left the colony in September, 1800, and the
narrative closes with an account of his embarkation. The only
allusion made by Collins to the question of authorship is in his
preface, in which he says that the very flattering reception
which his first volume had met with had induced him to continue
his labours in the character of historian; having been furnished
with materials for this purpose, "on the authenticity of which I
can safely stake my credit." So far as style is concerned, there
is a good deal more resemblance than contrast between the two
volumes; Hunter having had no difficulty in adopting the
melancholy air and manner which distinguish his predecessor; as
if, when sitting down to write, he had wrapped himself up in the
inky cloak which Collins had left behind him for the purpose. The
reader is too often reminded of the propensity for moralising on
the iniquity of human nature which figures so prominently in the
first volume. At the same time, Hunter did not neglect the
opportunity for displaying the nature and extent of his own
services, as well as defending himself from charges which he knew
might be made against his administration. The energy
unconsciously displayed in passages of this description reveals
the author's hand; as, for instance, where he tells us (p.
86)&#8212;in reference to the trading monopoly which the officers
of the New South Wales Corps had succeeded in
establishing&#8212;"it must have been evident to every one who
had sense to see it, that the Governor, from the hour of his
arrival, had used his utmost endeavours to put an end to the
practice of so much imposition." That fact is not made at all so
clear to the reader as might be wished; more especially as
Hunter, for reasons which he does not explain, carefully refrains
from any explanation on the subject, or any allusion to the
officers concerned. His reserve is the more remarkable because,
during his residence among them, those gentlemen had encircled
him in their folds like so many cobras. He endured the painful
struggle for five years; and then, finding that the only means by
which he could shake them off was by leaving the colony in their
grasp, he said good-bye to them in an order in which he expressed
his admiration for their services, and the confidence he had so
long reposed in them.</p>

The evidence given by these translations of the interest felt
throughout Europe in the colonising experiment of the British
Government deserves notice. Phillip's Voyage, published in 1789,
was translated into French in 1791, and into German in 1789,
1791, and 1794. Hunter's Journal, published in 1793, appeared in
two different German editions in 1794, and in a Swedish one in
1797. Tench's Narrative, published in 1789, was republished in
Dutch in 1789, in French in 1789 and 1791, in Swedish in 1797;
his Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson, published
in 1793, was translated into German in 1794. White's Journal,
published in 1790, did not appear in a foreign language until
1795, when it was published in French. There is no trace of any
translation of Collins's Account, the first volume of which was
published in 1798, and the second in 1802; a fact which may be
accounted for partly by the unusual size of the work and partly
by its having appeared rather late in the field&#8212;the greater
part of its contents having been anticipated by earlier
publications.</p>

The effect produced by exhibitions of this kind upon the natives,
is shown in another instance. Collins records that, in November,
1796, "the Court having ordered that Francis Morgan (convicted of
murder) should be hung in chains upon the small island which is
situated in the middle of the harbour, and named by the natives
Mat-te-wan-ye, a gibbet was accordingly erected and he was hung
there, exhibiting an object of much greater terror to the natives
than to the white people, many of whom were more inclined to make
a jest of it; but to the natives his appearance was so
frightful&#8212;his clothes shaking in the wind and the creaking
of his irons, added to their superstitious idea of ghosts (for
these children of ignorance imagined that, like a ghost, this man
might have the power of taking hold of them by the throat) all
rendering him such an alarming object to them&#8212;that they
never trusted themselves near him, nor the spot on which he hung;
which, until this time, had ever been with them a favourite place
of resort."&#8212;Vol. ii, p. 10.</p>

<h3>2.1 THE FOUNDATION OF THE COLONY. <small>[1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>PHILLIP'S</small> first despatch from Sydney Cove is
dated 15th May, 1788. From the day of his arrival in the Supply,
on the 25th January, to the date of his despatch, his time had
been fully employed in getting the settlement into some degree of
order, and in exploring the country round about it. It was his
practice at that time to keep a journal, in which he set down
"the little incidents" of his life from day to day, and from
which he subsequently wrote his letters to the Secretary of
State. The first was necessarily a lengthy one, but its contents
are of peculiar interest in the present day. There is no similar
record in which the story of the foundation of a great colony is
told with so much personal interest. The events connected with
the settlement of the American colonies were not chronicled until
long after the principal actors had disappeared from the scene,
and consequently their early history is buried in obscurity. But
the despatches written by Phillip contain a narrative so clear
and graphic in its way that the reader can find no difficulty in
realising the scenes he describes, or in following the course of
events to which he refers.</p>
<p>It will be observed that he does not make any mention of the
public ceremony which took place on the 26th January&#8212;the
day after his arrival&#8212;when the British flag was unfurled at
the head of Sydney Cove. On the evening of that day, Phillip and
the party that had arrived with him in the Supply from Botany Bay
the day before, assembled at the point where they had first
landed in the morning, and on which a flagstaff had been erected.
There, with the Union Jack flying over their heads, he proposed
several toasts&#8212; King George the Third, the Royal Family,
and Success to the New Colony&#8212;which were duly honored by
the officers who stood round him; the ceremony concluding with
several volleys from the marines. The day had been uncommonly
fine, as Collins tells us; and it concluded with the safe arrival
of the Sirius and the other ships from Botany Bay&#8212;the
voyage thus terminating with the same good fortune that had
attended it so conspicuously from the beginning.</p>
<p>The formal proclamation of the colony did not take place until
the 7th of February, by which time all the people on board the
ships had been landed and placed under cover on shore. That was
"the memorable day which established a regular form of government
on the coast of New South Wales." <a href="#note-275" name=
"noteref-275" id="noteref-275">{1}</a> On the slope of Point
Maskelyne&#8212;afterwards known as Dawes' Point&#8212;the
marines were drawn up under arms, the convicts stationed apart,
and the Governor, surrounded by his officers, called upon Captain
Collins, the Judge-Advocate, to read aloud the various documents
which contained within them the essential powers of government.
The first was the Commission appointing Phillip Captain-General
and Governor-in-Chief in and over the territory of New South
Wales and its dependencies. <a href="#note-276" name=
"noteref-276" id="noteref-276">{2}</a> Then came the Act of
Parliament, passed the year before, to enable his Majesty to
establish a colony and a civil government, and for that purpose
to erect a Court of Criminal Judicature for the trial of outrages
and misbehaviours. After the Act, the Judge-Advocate proceeded to
read out the Letters Patent constituting the Courts of Civil and
Criminal Judicature, and also the Vice-Admiralty Court for the
trial of piracies and other offences on the seas. <a href=
"#note-277" name="noteref-277" id="noteref-277">{3}</a></p>
<p>When these documents had been disposed of, Phillip proceeded
to address the assembly; his remarks being directed in the first
instance to the soldiers, and in the second to the convicts.
Among those who were present on the occasion, there were three
members of his staff who attentively noted what he said, and
afterwards recorded their recollections of it&#8212;Captain
Collins, Captain Tench, and Surgeon White. Captain Hunter was
also present, no doubt, but he made no reference to the speech or
the proceedings in his book. The fullest report of the speech
appeared in Phillip's Voyage; but it is not easy to say on what
authority it was written, seeing that Phillip himself made no
allusion to it in his despatches. The only reference made by him
to the matter appears in his letter to Evan Nepean of the 9th
July, in which he said that "his Majesty's Commission, with that
for establishing the Courts of Civil and Criminal Judicature,
were read soon after landing". The speech, as it appears in
Phillip's Voyage, was probably written by the editor of that work
from some private account of it sent to the Government with the
despatches:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Governor Phillip advanced, and addressing first the
private soldiers, thanked them for their steady good conduct on
every occasion, an honour which was repeated to them in the next
general orders. He then turned to the convicts, and distinctly
explained to them the nature of their present situation. The
greater part, he bade them recollect, had already forfeited their
lives to the justice of their country; yet, by the lenity of its
laws, they were now so placed that, by industry and good
behaviour, they might in time regain the advantages and
estimation in society of which they had deprived themselves. They
not only had every encouragement to make that effort, but were
removed almost entirely from every temptation to guilt. There was
little in this infant community which one man could plunder from
another, and any dishonest attempts in so small a society would
almost infallibly be discovered. To persons detected in such
crimes, he could not promise any mercy; nor indeed to any who,
under these circumstances, should presume to offend against the
peace and good order of the settlement. What mercy could do for
them they had already experienced; nor could any good be now
expected from those whom neither past warnings, nor the
peculiarities of their present situation, could preserve from
guilt. Against offenders, therefore, the rigour of the law would
certainly be put in force, while they whose behaviour should in
any degree promise reformation might always depend upon
encouragement fully proportioned to their deserts.<br>
<p>He particularly noticed the illegal intercourse between the
sexes as an offence which encouraged a general profligacy of
manners, and was in several ways injurious to society. To prevent
this, he strongly recommended marriage, and promised every kind
of countenance and assistance to those who, by entering into that
state, should manifest their willingness to conform to the laws
of morality and religion. Governor Phillip concluded his address
by declaring his earnest desire to promote the happiness of all
who were under his government, and to render the settlement in
New South Wales advantageous and honourable to his country.
<a href="#note-278" name="noteref-278" id=
"noteref-278">{4}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The account written by Collins omits all reference to the
remarks addressed to the marines, and also the advice given to
the convicts on the subject of marriage:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The ceremony of reading these public instruments
having been performed by the Judge-Advocate, the Governor,
addressing himself to the convicts, assured them, among other
things, that "he should ever be ready to show approbation and
encouragement to those who proved themselves worthy of them by
good conduct and attention to orders; while, on the other hand,
such as were determined to act in opposition to propriety, and
observe a contrary conduct, would inevitably meet with the
punishment which they deserved." He remarked how much it was to
their interest to forget the habits of vice and indolence in
which too many of them had hitherto lived; and exhorted them to
be honest among themselves, obedient to their overseers, and
attentive to the several works in which they were about to be
employed. <a href="#note-279" name="noteref-279" id=
"noteref-279">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>While the wording of these reports presents some points of
difference, they nevertheless agree in substance. The words of
encouragement offered to industry and good conduct, and the
emphatic warning with respect to the consequences of any further
criminality&#8212;which naturally formed the essence of Phillip's
remarks&#8212;appear in each account of them. The advice to marry
is not mentioned by Collins or Tench; but the former relates
that, before the end of the month, "several couples were
announced for marriage"&#8212;a virtuous resolution which was
found to originate in a belief that "married people would meet
with various little comforts and privileges denied to those in a
single state." Phillip had foreseen the dilemma which was sure to
arise whenever the question of intercourse between the sexes
should become a subject for serious consideration, and had even
contemplated the expediency of expressly permitting prostitution,
within certain limits. <a href="#note-280" name="noteref-280" id=
"noteref-280">{6}</a> But the difficulty of dealing with such a
subject officially made itself felt as soon as he turned his
attention to it, and the result was that he made no regulation of
the kind, contenting himself with a strong exhortation in favour
of marriage. By refraining from making any order at all, he left
matters to take their own course. But on two points he felt
Compelled to legislate. One of his first public orders was
directed to the prevention of disease. Another was subsequently
framed for the purpose of correcting a curious notion which had
got abroad on the subject of marriage. It was commonly believed
that the ceremony performed in the colony was not valid, and that
husbands could throw off the conjugal tie at their pleasure when
leaving the country. Phillip therefore ordered that "none should
be permitted to quit the colony who had wives or children
incapable of maintaining themselves, and likely to become
burdensome to the settlement, until they had found sufficient
security for the maintenance of such wives or children as long as
they might remain after them." <a href="#note-281" name=
"noteref-281" id="noteref-281">{7}</a> It was in this matter that
the first fruits of the Government policy began to show
themselves. The exclusion of free settlers was, in fact, the
exclusion of morality itself. Apart from that, the necessity for
equalising the sexes on such an occasion should have been
obvious; but not only was that matter disregarded&#8212;the
proportion between males and females being nearly four to
one&#8212;but the women sent out were mostly, according to
Phillip, "very abandoned wretches." The result was beyond any
power to control.</p>
<p>Phillip began his first despatch to Lord Sydney <a href=
"#note-282" name="noteref-282" id="noteref-282">{8}</a> by
referring to his departure from the Cape, and his arrangements
for arriving early at the scene of operations in Botany
Bay:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I had the honor of informing your lordship by Captain
Cox, who was returning to Europe from Madras, that I was ready to
sail from the Cape of Good Hope, and which I did, with the ships
under my command, the 12th of November.<br>
<br>
The 25th, being eighty leagues to the eastward of the Cape, I
left the Sirius and went on board the Supply, tender, in hopes,
by leaving the convoy, to gain sufficient time to examine the
country round Botany Bay, and fix on the most eligible situation
for the colony before the transports arrived. At the same time I
ordered the agent for the transports in the Alexander to separate
from the convoy with that ship, the Scarborough, and Friendship.
They sailing better than the others, I had reason to expect their
arrival soon after the Supply, and by having the labour of the
convicts they had on board, much might be done in preparing for
the landing the stores and provisions.<br>
<br>
Major Ross now left the Sirius and went on board the Scarborough,
that he might be with that part of the detachment which would
probably be the first landed.<br>
<br>
Captain Hunter, in the Sirius, was to follow with the store-ships
and the remainder of the transports, and he had the necessary
instructions for his future proceedings, should the Supply meet
with any accident.<br>
<br>
The westerly winds we now had continued till the 3rd of January,
when we saw the coast of New South Wales, but the winds which had
been so favourable having seldom been to the eastward, and then
for a few hours only, blowing from the N.W. to the S.W.,
generally very strong gales, now left us, and we had variable
winds with a current that at times set very strong to the
southward, so that we did not arrive at Botany Bay before the
18th.<br>
<br>
The Alexander, Scarborough, and Friendship, came in the next day,
and the Sirius, with the rest of the ships, the day after. Those
ships had continued very healthy.<br>
<br>
The Supply sailing very badly had not permitted my gaining the
advantage hoped for; but I began to examine the bay as soon as we
anchored, and found that, tho' extensive, it did not afford
shelter to ships from the easterly winds, the greater part of the
bay being so shoal that ships of even a moderate draught of water
are obliged to anchor with the entrance of the bay open, and are
exposed to a heavy sea that rolls in when it blows hard from the
eastward.<br>
<br>
Several small runs of fresh water were found in different parts
of the bay, but I did not see any situation to which there was
not some very strong objection. <a href="#note-283" name=
"noteref-283" id="noteref-283">{9}</a> The small creek that is in
the northern part of the bay runs a considerable way into the
country, but it had only water for a boat; the sides of this
creek are frequently overflowed, and the low lands are a swamp.
The western branch runs up for a considerable distance, but the
officers I sent to examine it could not find any water except in
very small drains.<br>
<br>
The best situation that offered was near Point Sutherland, where
there was a small run of good water; but the ground near it, as
well as a considerable part of the higher ground, was spongy, and
the ships could not approach this part of the bay.<br>
<br>
Several good situations offered for a small number of people, but
none that appeared calculated for our numbers, and where the
stores and provisions could be landed without a great deal of
time. When I considered the bay's being so very open, and the
probability of the swamps rendering the most eligible situation
unhealthy, I judged it advisable to examine Port Jackson; but
that no time might be lost if I did not succeed in finding a
better harbour and a proper situation for the settlement, the
ground near Point Sutherland was in the meantime to be cleared,
and preparations made for landing under the direction of the
Lieutenant-Governor.<br>
<br>
As the time in which I might be absent, if I went in the Supply,
must have been very uncertain, I went round with three boats,
taking with me Captain Hunter and several officers, that, by
examining different parts of the port at the same time, less time
might be lost. <a href="#note-284" name="noteref-284" id=
"noteref-284">{10}</a><br>
<br>
We got into Port Jackson early in the afternoon, and had the
satisfaction of finding the finest harbour in the world, in which
a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect
security, and of which a rough survey, made by Captain Hunter and
the officers of the Sirius after the ships came round, may give
your lordship some idea.<br>
<br>
The different coves were examined with all possible expedition. I
fixed on the one that had the best spring of water, and in which
the ships can anchor so close to the shore that, at a very small
expense, quays may be made at which the largest ships may unload.
This cove, which I honored with the name of Sydney, is about a
quarter of a mile across at the entrance, and half a mile in
length.<br>
<br>
We returned to Botany Bay the third day, when I received a very
unfavourable account of the ground that was clearing. The ships
immediately prepared to go round, and the 25th, seven days after
I arrived in the Supply, I sailed in her for Port Jackson,
leaving Captain Hunter to follow with the transports, it then
blowing too strong for them to work out of the bay. They joined
me the next evening, and all the transports were moored in the
cove.</blockquote>
<p>The arrival of the French ships under La P&#233;rouse is
referred to by Phillip in a paragraph in which he gives the
result of Lieutenant King's interview with the French commander.
There is no mention of any personal communication between the
representatives of the two nations, or of any visit paid by La
P&#233;rouse to Phillip; but hospitalities were frequently
exchanged between the French and English officers, and great
cordiality seems to have been shown on both sides.</p>
<blockquote>Two sail had appeared off Botany Bay the 24th under
French colours, and anchored there before the Sirius
left&#8212;the Boussole and the Astrolabe. <a href="#note-285"
name="noteref-285" id="noteref-285">{11}</a> These ships were
commanded by Mons. de la P&#233;rouse, who, having expressed a
desire of sending letters to Europe, I sent an officer over, it
being only eight miles, to tell him in what time it was probable
the ships might sail. Captain Clonard had left the ships in one
of their boats the same morning, and Lieutenant Shortland, the
agent for the transports, is charged with the letters he brought;
they are addressed to the French ambassadors. The officer I sent
over was informed that Mons. de la P&#233;rouse sailed from
France in June, 1785, that he had been to Santa Catherina, had
run along the coast of Chili and California, and had been at
Easter Island, Nootka Sound, Cook's River, Kamschatka, Manilla,
Isles des Navigateurs, Sandwich and the Friendly Islands. He had
likewise anchored off Norfolk Island, but could not land on
account of the surf.</blockquote>
<p>After a short account of the massacre at Navigators' Islands,
by which the French lost the captain of the Astrolabe with eleven
officers and men, Phillip then returns to affairs at the
settlement, describing the difficulties encountered in the
efforts to clear the ground and put up the necessary buildings.
The trees growing at the head of Sydney Cove were so large that
the labour of removing them, after they were cut down, proved a
serious obstacle to progress; while the land in the neighbourhood
was so rocky that cultivation to any considerable extent seemed
out of the question. Phillip was consequently driven to
"prospect" the country in all directions for any available patch
of good soil that would serve the purpose of a farm&#8212;a very
different state of affairs from that which he had been led to
expect from the descriptions in Cook's Voyage of the rich meadow
lands at Botany Bay.</p>
<blockquote>The clearing the ground for the people, and for
erecting store-houses, was begun as soon as the ships got round,
a labour of which it will be hardly possible to give your
lordship a just idea.<br>
<br>
The necks of land that form the different coves, and near the
water for some distance, are in general so rocky that it is
surprising such large trees should find sufficient nourishment;
but the soil between the rocks is good, and the summits of the
rocks, as well as the whole country round us, with few
exceptions, are covered with trees, most of which are so large
that the removing them off the ground, after they are cut down,
is the greatest part of the labour; and the convicts, naturally
indolent, having none to attend them but overseers drawn from
amongst themselves, and who fear to exert any authority, makes
this work go on very slowly.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will permit me to observe that our situation,
though so very different from what might be expected, is
nevertheless the best that offered. My instructions did not
permit me to detain the transports a sufficient length of time to
examine the coast to any considerable distance. It was absolutely
necessary to be certain of a sufficient quantity of fresh water,
in a situation that was healthy, and which the ships might
approach within a reasonable distance for the conveniency of
landing the stores and provisions; and I am fully persuaded that
we should never have succeeded had it been attempted to move them
only one mile from where they were landed. There are some parts
of this harbour where the trees stand at a considerable distance
from each other, and where there are small runs of water, which
shall be cultivated when our numbers permit; and when the country
can be examined, I make no doubt but some good situations will be
found that have water, which I have never yet been able to find
either in Botany Bay, or in this harbour, but in very small
streams.<br>
<br>
Some land that is near, and where the trees stand at a
considerable distance from each other, will, as soon as convicts
can be spared, be cultivated by the officers for raising a little
corn for their stock, and this I have endeavoured to promote as
much as possible, for I fear the consequences if a ship should be
lost in her passage out with provisions. <a href="#note-286"
name="noteref-286" id="noteref-286">{12}</a><br>
<br>
As there are only twelve convicts who are carpenters, as many as
could be procured from the ships have been hired to work on the
hospital <a href="#note-287" name="noteref-287" id=
"noteref-287">{13}</a> and store-houses. The people were healthy
when landed, but the scurvy has for some time appeared amongst
them, and now rages in a most extraordinary manner. Only sixteen
carpenters could be hired from the ships, and several of the
convict carpenters were sick. It was now the middle of February;
the rains began to fall very heavy, and pointed out the necessity
of hutting the people; convicts were therefore appointed to
assist the detachment in this work.</blockquote>
<p>The immediate occupation of Norfolk Island being one of
Phillip's instructions, no time was lost in carrying it out.</p>
<blockquote>February the 14th the Supply sailed for Norfolk
Island, with Philip Gidley King, second lieutenant of his
Majesty's ship Sirius, for the purpose of settling that island.
He only carried with him a petty officer, surgeon's mate, two
marines, two men who understood the cultivation of flax, with
nine men and six women convicts. Their numbers shall be increased
when a small detachment of marines can be spared. I have the
honor of transmitting your lordship a copy of the order and
instructions <a href="#note-288" name="noteref-288" id=
"noteref-288">{14}</a> given to that officer, and I beg to
recommend him as an officer of merit, whose perseverance in that
or any other service may be depended on.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip then proceeds to relate his efforts to explore the
country in the neighbourhood of the settlement&#8212;the first
point to which he directed his steps being Broken Bay.</p>
<blockquote>The 2nd of March I went with a long-boat and cutter
to examine the broken land mentioned by Captain Cook, about eight
miles to the northward of Port Jackson. <a href="#note-289" name=
"noteref-289" id="noteref-289">{15}</a> We slept in the boat that
night within a rocky point in the northward part of the bay,
which is very extensive, as the natives, though very friendly,
appeared to be numerous; and the next day, after passing a bar
that had only water for small vessels, entered a very extensive
branch, from which the ebb tide came out so strong that the boats
could not row against it in the stream, and here was deep water.
It appeared to end in several small branches, and in a large
lagoon that we could not examine for want of time to search for a
channel for the boats amongst the banks of sand and mud. Most of
the land on the upper part of this branch was low and full of
swamps. Pelicans and a variety of birds were here seen in great
numbers leaving this branch, which I called the north-west
branch. We proceeded across the bay and went into the south-west
branch, which is very extensive, and from which a second branch
runs to the westward, affording shelter for any number of ships,
and as far as we examined, there is water for the largest ships,
having seven fathoms at the entrance and deeper water as you go
up, but the almost continual rains prevented any kind of survey.
Here the land is much higher than at Port Jackson, more rocky,
and equally covered with timber, large trees growing on the
summits of mountains that appeared to be accessible to birds
only.<br>
<br>
Immediately round the headland that forms the southern entrance
into the bay there is a third branch, which I think the finest
piece of water I ever saw, and which I honored with the name of
Pitt water; it is, as well as the south-west branch, of
sufficient extent to contain all the navy of Great Britain, but
has only eighteen feet at low water on a narrow bar, which runs
across the entrance; within the bar there are from seven to
fifteen fathoms water. The land here is not so high as in the
south-west branch, and there are some good situations where the
land might be cultivated. We found small springs of water in most
of the coves, and saw three cascades falling from a height which
the rains then rendered inaccessible. I returned to Port Jackson,
after being absent eight days in the boats. Some of the people
feeling the effects of the rain, which had been almost constant,
prevented my returning by land, as I intended, in order to
examine a part of the country which appeared open and free from
timber. <a href="#note-290" name="noteref-290" id=
"noteref-290">{16}</a></blockquote>
<p>Norfolk Island again forms a subject of comment&#8212;
Lieutenant Ball's return from it having enabled Phillip to give
some account of its capabilities, based on Lieutenant King's
report. The discovery of Lord Howe Island is also noted.</p>
<blockquote>Lieutenant Ball, who commands the Supply, arrived the
19th of March. He made Norfolk Island on the 29th of February,
and was five days before a place could be found at which it was
possible to land the provisions, and saw very few places at which
it was possible to land a man, so completely do the rocks
surround that island. They succeeded, however, having found a
small opening in a reef that runs across a bay that is at the
south end of the island, and the six months' provisions were all
safely landed. Lieutenant King describes this island as one
entire wood, without a single acre of clear land that had been
found when the Supply left them, and says that the pine trees
rise fifty and sixty feet before they shoot out any branches.
There are several other kinds of timber on the island, which, as
far as he could examine it, was a rich black mould with great
quantities of pumice stone. The trees are so bound together by a
kind of supple-jack that the penetrating into the interior parts
of the island was very difficult. Several good springs of water
were found, and I apprehend his Majesty's ships in the East
Indies may be supplied from this island with masts and yards,
which will render it a very valuable acquisition. The cultivation
of the flax plant will be attended to when people can be sent to
clear the ground.<br>
<br>
A small island being seen in the passage to Norfolk Island,
Lieutenant Ball examined it on his return, and says it abounds in
turtle, but unfortunately has no good anchoring-ground. He named
it after Lord Howe. It is in 31&#176; 36" south latitude, and
159&#176; E. longitude. Part of this island may be seen sixteen
leagues, and a rock that is five leagues to the southward and
eastward of this island may be seen eighteen leagues.<br>
<br>
The Charlotte, Scarborough, and Lady Penrhyn, transports, were
cleared of all their stores, and discharged from Government
employ the 24th and 25th of March, and left at liberty to proceed
to China when they judged proper; the other ships remain till
store-houses can be finished.</blockquote>
<p>The first sitting of the Criminal Court took place on the 11th
February, and was followed by another before the end of the
month, when six men were condemned to death. Phillip's reference
to the proceedings on that occasion shows his belief in exile as
a better means of punishment than hanging.</p>
<blockquote>Your lordship will not be surprised that I have been
under the necessity of assembling a Criminal Court. <a href=
"#note-291" name="noteref-291" id="noteref-291">{17}</a> Six men
were condemned to death&#8212;one, who was the head of the gang,
was executed the same day; the others I reprieved. They are to be
exiled from the settlement; and when the season permits, I intend
they shall be landed near the South Cape, where, by their forming
connections with the natives, some benefit may accrue to the
public. These men had frequently robbed the stores and the other
convicts. The one who suffered and two others were condemned for
robbing the stores of provisions the very day they received a
week's provision, and at which time their allowance, as settled
by the Navy Board, was the same as the soldiers, spirits
excepted; the others, for robbing a tent and for stealing
provisions from other convicts.<br>
<br>
Part of the live stock brought from the Cape, small as it was,
has been lost, and our resource in fish is also uncertain; some
days great quantities are caught, but never sufficient to save
any part of the provisions, and at times fish are scarce.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will, I presume, see the necessity of a regular
supply of provisions for four or five years; and of cloathing,
shoes, and frocks in the greatest proportion. The necessary
implements for husbandry, and for clearing the ground, brought
out, will with difficulty be made to serve the time that is
necessary for sending out a fresh supply.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip had not been long in the country before he began to
feel more than doubtful about the prospect of obtaining
sufficient supplies from it to keep his people alive. He saw that
little or nothing could be expected from the cultivation of the
soil for some time, partly because the land in the neighbourhood
of the settlement was unfit for the purpose, and partly because
there were no men in it who had any practical knowledge of
farming. Had it been otherwise, there would still have remained
the necessity of storing the crops raised during the first two
years for seed, the supply sent out in the first instance having
proved worthless. As he explained in a subsequent despatch, "all
the seed wheat, and the greatest part of the other grains and
seeds brought from England, had been heated in the long passage",
and very little of what was sown had vegetated.</p>
<p>Equal difficulties were experienced with the live stock. Sheep
and cattle did not seem to thrive on the native grasses; the
sheep were killed by them, and the cattle escaped into the
interior in search of better feed as soon as they got loose. The
natural resources of the country in the shape of fish and wild
game were too uncertain to depend upon. The fish deserted the
harbour at the approach of winter, and even in summer the supply
was never sufficient to prove a substitute for ordinary rations.
As soon as the pressure of hunger began to be felt, fishing and
shooting parties were organised and despatched in different
directions; but with all their efforts they could not do more
than furnish small quantities of fresh food, invaluable no doubt
to people who had to live mainly on salt provisions, but
altogether insufficient to depend upon. The wild vegetables,
fruits, and berries which grew in the neighbourhood were eagerly
sought after, and proved useful in the treatment of scurvy and
dysentery; the native tea plant was largely used as a substitute
for tea-leaves; but notwithstanding all the assistance that could
be obtained from these sources, the difficulty of keeping up the
supply of food increased steadily from day to day.</p>
<p>Phillip's foresight led him to dwell upon this matter with
increasing emphasis in every despatch he wrote. His uneasiness on
the subject is manifest in every line. He knew too well, from his
painful experience when preparing for the voyage out, how
difficult it was to awaken any interest in the official mind as
to the fate of the Expedition: he knew the risk of a store-ship
being lost on the passage, and the length of time that must
elapse before the loss could become known in England; and he knew
that fresh ship-loads of convicts, as useless as the first, would
probably be sent out to him without any regard to the position in
which he might be placed. His repeated references to these
matters, however&#8212;in his letters to Nepean as well as in his
despatches to Sydney&#8212;proved of no avail; the dismal events
he dreaded and predicted came to pass; and as a last resort he
recalled Lieutenant King from Norfolk Island early in 1790 and
sent him to England, in order to make the state of affairs known
to Ministers in some more moving shape than a despatch. If the
wreck of the Sirius in March of that year made every heart in the
little colony tremble, the loss of the Guardian in December,
1789, followed by the arrival of the Second Fleet with nearly a
thousand sickly convicts, was a still more appalling
disaster.</p>
<blockquote>The labour of the convicts shall be, as is directed,
for the public stock; but it is necessary to permit a part of the
convicts to work for the officers, who, in our present situation,
would otherwise find it impossible to clear a sufficient quantity
of ground to raise what is absolutely necessary to support the
little stock they have; and I am to request that your lordship
will be pleased to direct me to what extent that indulgence may
be granted the officers of the garrison.<br>
<br>
The Sirius shall be sent to the northward to barter for stock,
and which shall be employed solely for the purpose of increasing
the breed of such cattle as she may procure. The Supply is noways
calculated for this service, as in the least sea her decks are
full of water.<br>
<br>
The very small proportion of females makes the sending out an
additional number absolutely necessary; for I am certain your
lordship will think that to send for women from the islands, in
our present situation, would answer no other purpose than that of
bringing them to pine away in misery.</blockquote>
<p>One of the many mistakes made by the Government in organising
the Expedition is seen in Phillip's reference to the want of
proportion between the sexes. Out of a total number of seven
hundred and fifty-six convicts put on board the transports, there
were only one hundred and ninety-two women, or one in four; many
of whom were old and enfeebled by disease. The character of these
women, and the difficulty of holding them under restraint, may be
judged from Surgeon White's account of their gambols during the
passage out. <a href="#note-292" name="noteref-292" id=
"noteref-292">{18}</a> With such an excess of males to females,
it was a desperate effort of the imagination to suppose that the
morals of the community could be sensibly improved by means of
marriage; since if every woman had found a husband, there would
still have been three hundred and seventy-two men left without
any chance of obtaining wives. This defect in the organisation of
the colony was not unknown to the Government before the First
Fleet sailed; but they seem to have thought that an easy remedy
might be found by procuring women from the islands in the
Pacific. This idea appears to have been prevalent in England at
the time; probably originating in the highly-coloured
descriptions of female beauty in the tropical islands which
became popular after the publication of Cook's Voyages. Instead
of equalising the sexes in the first instance, the Government
instructed Phillip to get women from the islands at every
opportunity. <a href="#note-293" name="noteref-293" id=
"noteref-293">{19}</a> No objection to such a heartless
proceeding presented itself to Sydney or his colleagues, so long
as neither "compulsive measures" nor "fallacious pretences" were
made use of for the purpose; nor were they deterred by the
prospect of creating such a race as would have resulted from the
intermixture of convicts and savages.</p>
<p>Although Phillip, while in England, <a href="#note-294" name=
"noteref-294" id="noteref-294">{20}</a> entertained the common
idea that island women might be added to the population as easily
as live stock, a very short experience in the colony seems to
have satisfied him that it would "answer no other purpose than
that of bringing them to pine away in misery". The only course he
could adopt under the circumstances was to represent the futility
of the proposal, and the consequent necessity for sending out
more women as soon as possible. The result was that two hundred
and twenty-two females, "many of them", says Collins, "loaded
with the infirmities incident to old age", were sent out in the
next transport&#8212;the Lady Juliana&#8212;which arrived in
June, 1790, two years after Phillip's despatch was written. In
recording her arrival, Collins, apparently unmindful of the
social problem which Phillip had to solve, expressed his surprise
Unprofitable that "a cargo so unnecessary and unprofitable as two
hundred and twenty-two females" should have been sent out,
instead of a supply of provisions. But circumstances had altered
during the interval between the date of Phillip's request for
more women and the arrival of the Lady Juliana. The lapse of time
had brought a much more pressing difficulty to the
surface&#8212;that of providing the population with food.</p>
<blockquote>I have had the honor of informing your lordship that
this harbour is, in extent and security, very superior to any
other that I have ever seen, containing a considerable number of
coves formed by narrow necks of land, mostly rocks, covered with
timber; and the face of the country, when viewed from the
harbour, is the same, with few exceptions. The neck of land
between the harbour and the coast is mostly sand. Between that
part of the harbour in which the settlement is made and Botany
Bay, after you pass the wood which surrounds us, and which in
some parts is one and a half, in others three miles across, the
country is a poor sandy heath full of swamps. The country towards
the head of the bay <a href="#note-295" name="noteref-295" id=
"noteref-295">{21}</a> is covered with timber, and here the land
appears less rocky, and the trees stand in some parts at a
greater distance; but the head of the bay being left dry in
several parts at low water, and the winds being obstructed by the
woods and the different windings of the channel, must, I
conceive, render this part of the harbour unhealthy till the
country can be cleared. As far as the eye can reach to the
westward, the country appears to be one continued
wood.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip was not at all disposed to be enthusiastic in his
views of things, but there were at least two exceptions to the
rule. When he first mentioned the harbour of Port Jackson, he
pronounced it "the finest harbour in the world"; and, when
referring to it again, he declared it to be, "in extent and
security, very superior to any other that I have ever seen."
Familiar as he was with the principal harbours in the world, he
evidently ranked Port Jackson far beyond the best of them. He
spoke with equal confidence on another point&#8212;the future of
the colony he had founded. His opinion of it was expressed
repeatedly in the strongest terms, and that too at a time when
others were proclaiming it a failure, and writing pitiful
lamentations over it to their friends in England. Notwithstanding
the difficulties by which they were surrounded, it seemed to him
"the most valuable acquisition Great Britain ever made"; an
opinion which was not based on first impressions only, but on a
careful examination of the country, day by day.</p>
<blockquote>The timber is well described in Captain Cook's
Voyage, but unfortunately it has one very bad quality, which puts
us to great inconvenience; I mean the large gum-tree, which
splits and warps in such a manner when used green, and to which
necessity obliged us, that a store-house boarded up with this
wood is rendered useless. The timber which in its growth
resembles the fir-tree warps less, but we are already obliged to
fetch it from some distance, and it will not float. Here are a
variety of palm-trees, and the heaths that are free from timber
are covered with a variety of the most beautiful flowering
shrubs. Wild celery, spinage, samphire, a small wild fig, and
several cherries, which have proved very wholesome, particularly
the leaves of a small shrub which is found in such plenty that it
has not yet failed us, as most of the others have done. What
seeds could be collected are sent to Sir Joseph Banks, is
likewise the red gum taken from the large gum-tree by tapping,
and the yellow gum which is found on the dwarf palm-tree.<br>
<br>
The small quantity of flax that has been procured is sufficient
to show the quality, but the flax plant described by Captain Cook
I have never met with, nor had the botanists that accompanied
Monsieur de la P&#233;rouse found it when I saw them, and which
was some time after they arrived. And here, my lord, I must beg
leave to observe with regret that, being myself without the
smallest knowledge of botany, I am without one botanist, or even
an intelligent gardener, in the colony; it is not therefore in my
power to give more than a very superficial account of the produce
of this country, which has such a variety of plants that I
cannot, with all my ignorance, help being convinced that it
merits the attention of the naturalist and the botanist.<br>
<br>
The stone of this country is of three sorts; freestone, which
appears equal to Portland stone; a bad firestone; and a stone
that appears to contain a large proportion of iron. We have good
clay for bricks, but no chalk or limestone has yet been
found.</blockquote>
<p>The relations between the new arrivals and the native
inhabitants of the country being a matter of the highest
importance, it is not surprising to find the greater part of
Phillip's despatch occupied with extracts from his journal on the
subject. The interest he took in it is evident from the tone of
his remarks. He seems not to have lost any opportunity of going
among the natives whenever and wherever they were to be met with,
making particular inquiries into their habits and customs, and
endeavouring by every means in his power to conciliate them.
Notwithstanding the disturbances which took place occasionally
between them and the people under his command, his efforts to
establish good relations with the savages were tolerably
successful. Writing in 1796, Collins related (p. 543) that "after
many untoward occurrences and a considerable lapse of time, that
friendly intercourse with the natives which had been so earnestly
desired was at length established: and having never been
materially interrupted, these remote islanders have been shown
living in considerable numbers among us without fear or
restraint; acquiring our language; readily falling in with our
manners and customs; enjoying the comforts of our clothing, and
relishing the variety of our food. We saw them die in our houses,
and the places of the deceased instantly filled by others, who
observed nothing in the fate of their predecessors to deter them
from living with us, and placing that entire confidence in us
which it was our interest and our pleasure to cultivate."</p>
<blockquote>With respect to the natives, it was my determination
from my first landing that nothing less than the most absolute
necessity should ever make me fire upon them, and though
preserving this resolution has at times been rather difficult, I
have hitherto been so fortunate that it never has been necessary.
Mons. La P&#233;rouse while at Botany Bay was not so fortunate;
he was obliged to fire on them, in consequence of which, with the
bad behaviour of some of the transports' boats and some convicts,
the natives have lately avoided us, but proper measures are taken
to regain their confidence.<br>
<br>
The few hours I have to collect and put into method the
observations I have made of these people will, I hope, excuse me
to your lordship for sending only extracts from my journal, as
they have been set down when the little incidents occurred, and
from which a more just opinion of these people may be drawn than
I should perhaps be able to give.<br>
<br>
When I first landed in Botany Bay the natives appeared on the
beach, and were easily persuaded to receive what was offered to
them; and though they came armed, very readily returned the
confidence I placed in them by going to them alone and unarmed,
most of them laying down their spears when desired; and while the
ships remained in Botany Bay no dispute happened between our
people and the natives. <a href="#note-296" name="noteref-296"
id="noteref-296">{22}</a> They were all naked, but seemed fond of
ornaments, putting the beads or red baize that were given them
round their heads or necks. Their arms and canoes being described
in Captain Cook's Voyage, I do not trouble your lordship with any
description of them.<br>
<br>
When I first went in the boats to Port Jackson the natives
appeared armed near the place at which we landed, and were very
vociferous, but, like the others, easily persuaded to accept
whatever was offered them; and I persuaded one man, who appeared
to be the chief or master of the family, to go with me to that
part of the beach where the people were boiling their meat. When
he came near the marines, who were drawn up near the place, and
saw that by proceeding he should be separated from his
companions, who remained with several officers at some distance,
he stopped, and with great firmness seemed, by words and actions,
to threaten them if they offered to take any advantage of his
situation. He then went on with me to examine what was boiling in
the pot, and expressed his admiration to me in a manner that made
me believe he intended to profit from what he saw, and which I
made him understand he might very easily, by the help of some
oyster-shells. I believe they know no way of dressing their food
but by broiling, and they are seldom seen without a fire, or a
piece of wood on fire, which they carry with them from place to
place and in their canoes, so that I apprehend they find some
difficulty in procuring fire by any other means with which they
are acquainted. The boats, in passing near a point of land in
their Manly Cove, harbour, were seen by a number of men, and
twenty of them waded into the water unarmed, received what was
offered them, and examined the boats with a curiosity that gave
me a much higher opinion of them than I had formed from the
behaviour of those seen in Captain Cook's voyage, and their
confidence and manly behaviour made me give the name of Manly
Cove to this place.<br>
<br>
The same people afterwards joined us where we dined; they were
all armed with lances, two with shields and swords, the latter
made of wood, the gripe small, and I thought less formidable than
a good stick. As their curiosity made them very troublesome when
we were preparing our dinner, I made a circle round us; there was
little difficulty in making them understand they were not to come
within it, and they then sat down very quiet. The white clay
rubbed on the upper part of the face of one of these men had the
appearance of a mask; and a woman that appeared on some rocks
near which the boats passed was marked with white on the face,
neck, and breasts in such a manner as to render her the most
horrid figure I ever saw. They are not often seen marked in this
manner, and it is done only on some particular occasions. Several
women landed from their canoes the morning the boats stopped in a
small bay near the entrance of the harbour, when I was going to
examine the coast to the northward, and three of them were very
big with child. Ribbons, baize, &amp;c., they tied round their
necks when they were given to them. Several of them had children
with them in the canoes. They appeared to be less cheerful than
the men, and under great subjection. Two canoes with three women
in each, and one canoe with a man and woman, came off to us when
we were a mile from the land, and came alongside the boat to
receive some fish-hooks and lines which were offered them.<br>
<br>
In Broken Bay several women came down to the beach with the men
where we landed, one of whom, a young woman, was very talkative
and remarkably cheerful. They all readily assisted us in making a
fire, and behaved in the most friendly manner. In a bay in which
we landed to haul the seine, many of the natives joined us, and I
now observed that the women had lost two joints of the little
finger of the left hand. As they appeared to be all married
women, I supposed it to be a part of the marriage ceremony; but
in going into a hut where there were several women and children,
who did not seem inclined to show themselves, I found one woman
who appeared to have had children, and a very old woman, on
neither of whom this operation had been performed. There was
likewise a child of five or six years of age that had lost the
two joints. It is the women only that suffer this operation,
which&#8212;as it must be performed with the shell that serves
them, when fixed at the end of a short stick, as a chisel for
pointing their spears and for separating the oysters from the
rocks&#8212;must be a painful one. It is only on the little
finger of the left hand that it is performed. It cannot be any
part of the marriage ceremony, for I have seen several women with
child whose fingers were perfect, and, as I before observed, a
female child of five or six years of age that had suffered the
operation. I likewise saw some very young female children whose
fingers were perfect. <a href="#note-297" name="noteref-297" id=
"noteref-297">{23}</a><br>
<br>
The loins of many of the women appeared as if they had something
of a scrofulous disorder, but which I thought might be the marks
still remaining of a chastisement. They certainly are not treated
with any very great tenderness, and I believe are mostly employed
in the canoes, where I have seen them with very young infants at
the breasts. They appear very obedient to the men, and as they
are the weakest, so in this state of nature they appear to be
treated as the inferior. The women, as well as the men, seem fond
of little ornaments, but which they soon lay aside; and the
talkative lady, when she joined us in her canoe the day after we
first landed, stood up and gave us a song that was not
unpleasing.<br>
<br>
As most of the women have lost the two first joints of the little
finger on the left hand, so most of the men want the right front
tooth in the upper jaw, and have the gristle that separates the
nostrils perforated, frequently having a piece of stick or a bone
thrust through, and which does not add to their beauty. This is
general, but I saw some very old men that had not lost the tooth,
and whose noses were not perforated for this ornament. <a href=
"#note-298" name="noteref-298" id="noteref-298">{24}</a> On my
showing them that I wanted a front tooth it occasioned a general
clamour, and I thought gave me some little merit in their
opinion. Their bodies, chiefly about the breasts and arms, are
scarified, and sometimes the skin is raised for several inches
from the flesh, appearing as if it was filled with wind, forming
a round surface of more than a quarter of an inch diameter. They
have scars likewise in different parts of the body, and
frequently one on the instep; nor does the head always escape,
for one of them, putting aside the hair on the fore part of the
head, showed a scar, and then, pointing to one on the foot and
those on different parts of the body, gave us to understand that
he was honored by these marks from head to foot. <a href=
"#note-299" name="noteref-299" id="noteref-299">{25}</a> The
scars the men are fond of showing, but I did not think the women
seemed to be fond of showing the mutilated finger, and sometimes
found it rather difficult to know whether they had lost the joint
or not; for though they had not the smallest idea that one part
of the body required concealment more than the other, <a href=
"#note-300" name="noteref-300" id="noteref-300">{26}</a> they
appeared timid, would not approach so readily as the men did, and
sometimes they would not land from their canoes, but made signs
for us to give what we offered them to the men.<br>
<br>
When the south branch of Broken Bay was first visited, we had
some difficulty in getting round the headland that separates the
two branches, having very heavy squalls of wind and rain, and
when we attempted to land there was not sufficient water for the
boat to approach the rocks, on which were standing an old man and
a youth. They had seen us labour hard to get under the land, and
after pointing out the deepest water for the boats, brought us
fire, and going with two of the officers to a cave at some
distance, the old man made use of every means in his power to
make them go in with him, but which they declined, and this was
rather unfortunate, for it rained hard, and the cave was the next
day found to be sufficiently large to have contained us all, and
which he certainly took great pains to make them understand. When
this old man saw us prepare for sleeping on the ground, and
clearing away the bushes, he assisted, and was the next morning
rewarded for his friendly behaviour. Here we saw a woman big with
child that had not lost the joints of the little finger.<br>
<br>
When we returned two days afterwards to the spot where the old
man had been so friendly, he met us with a dance and a song of
joy. His son was with him. A hatchet and several presents were
made to them; and as I intended to return to Port Jackson the
next day, every possible means were taken to secure his
friendship; but when it was dark he stole a spade, and was caught
in the act. I thought it necessary to show that I was displeased
with him, and therefore when he came to me, pushed him away and
gave him two or three slaps on the shoulder with the open hand,
at the same time pointing to the spade. This destroyed our
friendship in a moment, and seizing a spear, he came close up to
me, poised it, and appeared determined to strike; but whether
from seeing that his threats were not regarded, for I chose
rather to risk the spear than fire on him, or from anything the
other natives said who surrounded him, after a few moments he
dropped his spear and left us. This circumstance is mentioned to
show that they do not want personal courage, for several officers
and men were then near me. He returned the next morning with
several others, and seemed desirous of being taken notice of, but
he was neglected, whilst hatchets and several other articles were
given to the others.<br>
<br>
The men hang in their hair the teeth of dogs and other animals,
lobsters' claws, and several small bones which they secure by
gum, but I never saw the women do this. Their food is chiefly
fish&#8212;the shark, I believe, they never eat&#8212;the fern
root, wild fig, and the kernels of a large fruit, that is not
unlike a pine-apple, but which when eaten by the French seamen
occasioned violent retchings. Their hooks are made from shells,
and their lines and nets, I believe, from the flax plant; but I
have some that were made from the fur of some animal, and others
that appeared to be made of cotton. The cray-fish and lobsters
they catch in small hoop-nets, the making of which shows some
art, yet they have no kind of cloathing; at the same time they
appear to be sensible of the cold, and to dislike the rain very
much, putting on their heads when it rains a piece of bark, under
which I have seen them shiver. Their huts are generally
surrounded by oyster and mussel shells, and their bodies smell of
oil. They cannot be called a very cleanly people, yet I have seen
one of them, after having in his hand a piece of pork, hold out
his fingers for others to smell to, with strong marks of disgust,
and though they seldom refused bread or meat, if offered them, I
have never been able to make them eat with us, and when they left
us they generally threw away the bread and meat; but fish they
always accepted, and would broil and eat it.<br>
<br>
The ground having been seen raised in several places, as is
common in England where poor people are buried, I had one of
these graves opened, and from the ashes had no doubt but that
they burn their dead. From the appearance of the ashes, the body
must be laid at length only a few inches below the surface, and
is, with the wood ashes made by burning the body, covered
slightly over with mould, fern, and a few stones. A grave was
opened by Captain Hunter in which part of a jawbone was found not
consumed by the fire, but we have seen very few of these graves,
and none near their huts. <a href="#note-301" name="noteref-301"
id="noteref-301">{27}</a><br>
<br>
It is not possible to determine with any accuracy the number of
natives, but I think that in Botany Bay, Port Jackson, Broken
Bay, and the intermediate coast, they cannot be less than fifteen
hundred. <a href="#note-302" name="noteref-302" id=
"noteref-302">{28}</a></blockquote>
<p>Having related the results of his experience among the natives
at length, Phillip returns to the subject of
exploration&#8212;which naturally attracted his attention quite
as much as the other. These were the primary objects of his
administration. It was necessary to conciliate the natives in
order to secure a peaceful occupation of the territory; and it
was equally essential to discover its capabilities and resources.
His references to the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury are
peculiarly interesting from the fact that, at the time he wrote,
both mountains and river were mere subjects for conjecture,
nothing being known about either.</p>
<blockquote>In going to examine a cove near the entrance of the
harbour (Shell Cove), I found a passage with deep water into a
branch of the harbour that runs to the north-west, and finding,
on examining, that there was a run of fresh water that came from
the westward. I went a few days after to examine the source. I
landed with four days' provisions, several officers, and a small
party of marines, and found to the northward of this part of the
harbour a large lake, which we examined, though not without great
labour, for it is surrounded with a bog and a large marsh, in
which we were frequently up to our middle. Here we saw a black
swan; it was larger than the common swan, and when it rose, after
being fired at, the wings appeared to be edged with white; there
is some red on the bill, and it is a noble bird. With great
labour, in three days we got round the swamps and marshes from
which all the freshwater drains that this harbour is supplied
with.<br>
<br>
The country we passed through when we left the low grounds was
the most rocky and barren I ever saw, the ascending and
descending of the mountains being practicable only in particular
places, but covered with flowering shrubs. And when about fifteen
miles from the sea-coast we had a very fine view of the mountains
inland, the northernmost of which I named Carmarthen Hills and
the southernmost Landsdown Hills; a mountain between I called
Richmond Hill; <a href="#note-303" name="noteref-303" id=
"noteref-303">{29}</a> and, from the rising of these mountains, I
did not doubt but that a large river would be found, in search of
which I set off the 22nd of April, with six days' provisions. We
were eleven officers and men, and landed near the head of the
harbour; here the country was good, but we soon came to a close
cover that we endeavoured for some time to get through, but were
obliged to return, and the next day passed this cover by keeping
along the banks of a small creek for about four miles. The three
following days we proceeded to the westward, finding the country
in general as fine as any I ever saw, the trees growing from
twenty to forty feet from each other, and, except in particular
places where the soil was stony and very poor, no underwood. The
country through which we passed was mostly level, or only rising
in small hills, which gave it a pleasing and picturesque
appearance. The fifth day we got to a rising ground, and for the
first time since we landed saw Carmarthen Hills, as likewise the
hills to the south-west. The country round this hill was so
beautiful that I called the hill Belle Vue, but the hills we
wished to reach still appeared to be at least thirty miles from
us.<br>
<br>
We had been five days out, and the want of provisions obliged us
to return to the spot we left by the track we went, otherwise our
journey might be lengthened several days longer than we expected
by meeting with deep ravines, which we might be obliged to go
round; and I believe no country can be more difficult to
penetrate into than this is. Though we always found pools of
water that had remained after the rainy season, yet, as that
could not be depended on, the water necessary for the day was
always carried, which, with the provisions, arms, and a couple of
tents, obliged every officer and man to carry a very heavy load,
but which at present was so much lightened, and having the trees
marked, in one day and a half we got back to the head of the
harbour. We had been thirty miles to the westward, and had seen a
country that might be cultivated with ease, and I intended
returning in a few days, in hopes of reaching the bottom of
Landsdown or Carmarthen Hills; and the traces of the natives
inland, added to the hopes of finding a large river, which the
appearance of the country promised, made every one,
notwithstanding the fatigue, desirous of being of the party. But
my having, when I went to Broken Bay, before I was perfectly
recovered from the complaint which had been so general, slept
several nights on the wet ground, brought on a pain in the side,
which the journey increased so much that I found a few weeks'
rest necessary after I returned.<br>
<br>
I have had the honor of informing your lordship that we now know
there is a good country near us, and it shall be settled and
cultivated early in the spring. In this journey I was surprised
to find temporary huts made by the natives far inland, where they
must depend solely on animals for food, and to procure which we
have never yet seen any other weapon than the spear, which is
certainly very inferior to our guns, which in this journey,
though we were in want of provisions for the last two days,
procured us barely sufficient for two meals. These huts consist
of only a single piece of bark, about eleven feet in length, and
from four to six feet in breadth, being, when stripped from the
tree, bent in the middle, and set up as children put up a card,
affording shelter against a shower of rain, if you sit under it.
The hut may perhaps only be intended to hide them from the
animals they lay in wait for.<br>
<br>
Near one of these huts we found some of the bones of a kangaroo,
and saw several trees that were on fire; the natives, I suppose,
had left them on our approach. I also found the root of fern, or
something like the fern root, that had been chewed by one of the
natives; he could only have left the spot a few minutes, but we
never saw any of them, and I believe their numbers in these woods
are very small. Whether they live in the woods by choice or are
driven from the society of those who inhabit the sea-coast, or
whether they travel to a distant part of the country, I can form
no judgment at present. The bark of many of the trees was cut in
notches, and at the foot of one tree we found the fur of a flying
squirrel. Many trees were seen with holes that had been enlarged
by the natives to get at the animal&#8212;either the squirrel,
kangaroo rat, or opossum&#8212;for the going in of which they
wait under their temporary huts; and as the enlarging of these
holes could only be done with the shell they use to separate the
oysters from the rocks, it must require great patience. Against
several trees, where the hole was near the ground but too high to
reach, boughs of trees were laid for to climb up by. We saw many
places where the natives had made fires, but at one place only
were any oyster or mussel shells seen, and there not more than
half a dozen, and no fish-bones; so that when they go inland they
certainly do not carry any fish to support them.</blockquote>
<p>The curious displays of aboriginal art to be seen on the rocks
near the sea-coast did not escape Phillip's attention. In his
time it is probable that nearly every flat rock about Port
Jackson, Botany Bay, and Broken Bay was ornamented with a
representation of animal life, or of native weapons, either
carved or painted; but very few specimens of the kind are to be
met with in the present day. <a href="#note-304" name=
"noteref-304" id="noteref-304">{30}</a></p>
<blockquote>In Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay we
frequently saw the figures of men, shields, and fish roughly cut
on the rocks, and on the top of a mountain I saw the figure of a
man in the attitude they put themselves in when they are going to
dance, which was much better done than I had seen before; and the
figure of a large lizard was sufficiently well executed to
satisfy everyone what animal was meant.<br>
<br>
In all the country through which I have passed I have seldom gone
a mile without seeing trees which appear to have been destroyed
by fire. We have seen very heavy thunderstorms, and I believe the
gum-trees strongly attract the lightning; but the natives always
make their fire, if not before their own huts, at the foot of a
gum-tree, which burns very freely, and they never put a fire out
when they leave the place.<br>
<br>
Near some water we saw the dung of some animal that fed on grass,
and which I thought could not be less than a horse. Kangaroos
were frequently seen, but very shy; and it is a little
extraordinary that more of these animals are seen near the camp
than in any other part of the country, notwithstanding they are
fired at almost daily. Black swans are found on most of the
lakes, and a bird as large as the ostrich was killed while I was
at Broken Bay. It differs both from the ostrich and the emu.
Several have been seen, but they are very shy, and much swifter
than the greyhounds. There are wild ducks, teal, and quails, with
great variety of small birds.<br>
<br>
On my return from this excursion I had the mortification to find
that five ewes and a lamb had been killed in the middle of the
day, and very near the camp; I apprehend by some native dogs.<br>
<br>
The beginning of May, the rainy season was once more supposed to
be set in, but after a week we had fine weather.<br>
<br>
The three transports for China sailed the 5th, 6th, and 8th of
May, and the Supply having been caulked, sailed the 6th to Lord
Howe Island, to endeavour to procure turtle in hopes of checking
the scurvy, with which most of the people are affected, and near
two hundred rendered incapable of doing any work. It is not
possible to send the Sirius to the northward, for she must then
have her carpenters, and only three of those hired from the
transports now remain; and tho' the detachment began to build
barracks for the use of the men and huts for the officers the
14th of February, and near a hundred convicts were given to
assist in this work, they are not yet finished, nor is the
hospital or the store-house that is to receive the provisions
still remaining on board three transports, and on these works the
carpenters of the Sirius are employed. I have before pointed out
the great labour in clearing the ground as one cause of our slow
progress.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will, I hope, excuse the confused manner in which I
have in this letter given an account of what has passed since I
left the Cape of Good Hope. It has been written at different
times, and my situation at present does not permit me to begin so
long a letter again, the canvas house I am under being neither
wind nor water proof.</blockquote>
<p>The second and third despatches were written on the 16th May,
and related chiefly to military matters. Their contents show that
unpleasant differences of opinion had already occurred between
Phillip and the officers of the marines, arising from their
determination to confine their services within the strict limits
of military duty. They declined to support the Government by
exercising a moral control over the convicts; they complained of
having to sit as members of the Criminal Court; and at the same
time they grumbled because they could not get their grants of
land immediately.</p>
<blockquote>I have in my first letter had the honor of observing
to your lordship the great want of proper persons for to
superintend the convicts. The officers who compose the detachment
are not only few in number, but most of them have declined any
interference with the convicts, except when they are employed for
their own particular service. I requested soon after we landed
that officers would occasionally encourage such as they observed
diligent, and point out for punishment such as they saw idle or
straggling in the woods; this was all I desired, but the officers
did not understand that any interference with the convicts was
expected, and that they were not sent out to do more than the
duty of soldiers. The consequence must be obvious to your
lordship: here are only convicts to attend the convicts, and who
in general fear to exert any authority, and very little labour is
drawn from them in a country which requires the greatest
exertions. In this declaration I do not mean to include the
Lieutenant-Governor, who has shown every attention that could be
expected from him, and the Judge-Advocate, acting as a Justice of
the Peace with a diligence that does him the greatest credit. The
convicts are under as good order as our present situation
permits.<br>
<br>
The sitting as members of the Criminal Court is thought a
hardship by the officers, and of which they say they were not
informed before they left England. It is necessary to mention
this circumstance to your lordship, that officers coming out may
know that a young colony requires something more from officers
than garrison duty.<br>
<br>
The not having the power of immediately granting lands the
officers likewise feel as a hardship. They say that they shall be
obliged to make their minds up as to the staying in the country
or returning, before they can know what the bounty of Government
intends them.</blockquote>
<p>The third despatch referred to some eccentric proceedings on
the part of Major Ross:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have the honor of transmitting your lordship copies
of the proceedings of a Battalion Court-martial, and the letters
which passed on that occasion, by which your lordship will see
the reasons assigned by the Commandant of the detachment for
putting the officers under arrest, as likewise the reasons given
by the Court for not altering the sentence.<br>
<br>
Battalion Court-martial being ordered by Major Ross, as
Commandant of the detachment, when he judged necessary, I was not
informed of the officers being under arrest till the next
morning, when he came to inform me, and I used every means in my
power to prevent a General Court-martial, the inconveniences of
which were obvious. Any accommodation being declined, I did not
judge it prudent to put the guards in the charge of sergeants,
which must have been done to assemble the Court, the number of
officers capable of doing duty being but thirteen. I therefore
ordered the officers to return to their duty till a General
Court-martial could be assembled.</blockquote>
<p>From an order signed by Lieut. George Johnston, Adjutant of
Orders, dated 22nd March, 1788, it appears that, on the previous
day, Major Ross had placed Captain Tench and four other officers
of the corps under arrest because they, while acting as President
and members of a Court-martial for the trial of a private
soldier, had passed a sentence which, in the Major's opinion,
tended to the subversion of all military discipline. He had also
requested that a General Court-martial might be ordered for the
trial of the officers, "for refusing to make any alteration in
the sentence", after they had been called upon to do so.</p>
<p>As an alternative to this proceeding the Major proposed that,
in order to restore harmony and support military discipline, the
matter should be submitted by the Judge-Advocate to the
determination of any number of officers. The gentlemen concerned,
however, declined to adopt that suggestion on the ground that,
having been put under arrest, nothing less than a legal decision
by a General Court-martial, "or a public reparation from their
Commandant", would clear their characters.</p>
<p>At this point a dilemma presented itself. The total number of
officers being only nineteen, of whom five were under arrest and
one was confined to his bed, thirteen only were left to sit as
members of the Court-martial and at the same time to do duty in
the Camp. The Court, therefore, could not be held without
depriving the settlement of the usual guards, inasmuch as not one
officer would have been No means of left for duty while it was
sitting. The conclusion arrived at was, that the documents
relating to the matter should be delivered to the Judge-Advocate,
in order that a General Court-martial might be assembled whenever
the service might permit; the officers under arrest to return to
their duty.</p>
<p>This disturbance having occurred in March, when the settlement
was barely two months old, it would seem that Major Ross's
eccentricities began to show themselves at a very early period of
his career. It was unfortunate that while the Judge-Advocate was
revolving the matter in his mind, it did not occur to him to
point out that nothing could be more subversive of military
discipline than the course proposed by the Commandant&#8212;that
of subjecting the members of a Court-martial to trial because
they had passed a sentence which did not meet with his approval,
and had subsequently refused to alter it at his request. There
were many obvious objections to such a course. In the first
place, there was no precedent for it; in the second, it was
contrary to the established course of proceedings in military as
well as other tribunals; in the third, it was calculated to
degrade the officers; and in the fourth, it sought to establish a
thoroughly vicious principle&#8212;that the deliberate sentence
of a Court-martial might be altered at the dictation of the
commanding officer.</p>
<p>In addition to these objections, there was the further one
that the settled course to pursue in such cases was, to appeal to
a General Court-martial in order that the sentence complained of
might be judicially reviewed. But the practice of military
tribunals not being very well known in the settlement at that
time. Major Ross's proposal was allowed to pass without
challenge, and was ultimately shelved in the manner stated. The
position to which military discipline was brought when it had
become possible that subalterns, placed under arrest by their
commanding officer, could demand a public apology from him, was
another matter which might, under different circumstances, have
become a matter for consideration.</p>
<p>A letter to Nepean, the Under Secretary, dated 5th July, was
sent with the despatches to Sydney. After some details with
respect to the allowance of spirits for the soldiers' wives and
the rations for the men, it said:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Every possible attention will be given to the
cultivation of the flax plant when circumstances permit, and on
our first arrival in this port it was frequently met with; but
when I judged the seed to be ripe and ordered it to be collected,
very little was found, and none in those places where it had been
seen in any quantity, which I impute to the natives pulling up
the plant when in flower to make their fishing-lines. A few
plants have been collected, and which are sent home under the
care of the agent of the transports.<br>
<br>
Sheep do not thrive in this country at present, but as many cows,
with one or two young bulls, as the ships intended for this
settlement that touch at the Cape can receive on board, will, I
hope, be ordered, as likewise seeds, and a few quarters of wheat,
barley, and Indian corn.<br>
<br>
Cloathing for the natives, if sent out, will, I dare say, be very
acceptable to them when they come amongst us. I should recommend
long frocks and jackets only, which will equally serve both men
and women.<br>
<br>
A great part of the cloathing I have, sir, already observed was
very bad, and a great part of it was likewise too small for
people of common size. If some coarse blankets were to be sent
out they would greatly contribute to preserve the health of the
convicts.<br>
<br>
In addition to the frocks and jackets for the natives, good
house-carpenters' axes, hats, hooks, and lines will be most
beneficial, as well as most acceptable to the
natives.</blockquote>
<p>A second series of despatches, bearing date 9th, 10th, and
12th July, was written by Phillip in continuation of those dated
15th and 16th May. The latter had apparently been written in
anticipation of the early departure of the transports bound for
England; but as they did not sail until the 14th July, another
opportunity was afforded for addressing the Home Secretary. The
two sets of despatches were received in London at the same
time&#8212;March, 1789. The first of those written in July gives
an interesting review of his proceedings since the month of
May:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I have had the honor of informing your lordship of
the situation of this colony prior to the 15th of May, since
which two stores have been finished, and the ships are now
landing the remainder of the stores and provisions.<br>
<br>
The hutting the battalion is still going on, and though from
seventy to one hundred convicts have been almost constantly
employed assisting in this business, it will not, I apprehend, be
finished before the end of July; and every day proves the
necessity of proper persons being sent out to superintend the
convicts. If a small number of carpenters and bricklayers are
sent out with proper people who are capable of superintending the
convicts, they will soon be rendered serviceable to the State,
and without which they will remain for years a burden to
Government. Numbers of them have been brought up from their
infancy in such indolence that they would starve if left to
themselves, and many (their numbers now exceed fifty), from old
age and disorders which are incurable, and with which they were
sent from England, are incapable of every kind of
work.</blockquote>
<p>The necessity for keeping up a regular supply of provisions
for four or five years at least is again referred to:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Thus situated, your lordship will excuse my observing
a second time that a regular supply of provisions from England
will be absolutely necessary for four or five years, as the crops
for two years to come cannot be depended on for more than what
will be necessary for seed, and what the Sirius may procure can
only be to breed from. Should necessity oblige us to make use of
what that ship may be able to procure, I do not apprehend that
the live stock she will bring in twelve months will be more than
a month's provision for the colony, and the Supply is totally
unfit for a service of this kind.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Ball returned the 25th from Lord Howe Island, where I
had sent him in hopes he would have been able to procure some
turtle for the sick; but the weather was bad, and that island not
having any good water will not be of any service to us, for
Lieutenant Ball did not see any turtle, nor does he suppose they
were bred there. The transports that sailed for China had my
directions not to go to that island, but they all appeared there
before the Supply left it, and one was near being lost. <a href=
"#note-305" name="noteref-305" id="noteref-305">{31}</a><br>
<br>
The store-ships and transports, as cleared, are ordered to
prepare to return to England immediately, but some of their
sheathing being much destroyed by the worms, it is necessary to
permit several of those ships to heave down.<br>
<br>
One of the convicts who, in searching for vegetables, had gone a
considerable distance from the camp, returned very dangerously
wounded in the back by a spear. He denies having given the
natives any provocation, and says that he saw them carrying away
a man that had gone out for the same purpose, and whom they have
wounded on the head. A shirt and hat, both pierced with spears
have been since found in one of the native huts, but no
intelligence can be got of the man; and I have not any doubt but
that the natives have killed him, nor have I the least doubt of
the convict being the aggressors. Eleven male and one female
convicts have been missing since we landed. A bull-calf has
likewise been wounded by a spear, and two goats have been killed
by some of our own people, the skin of one being found where the
natives never appear, so that the little stock we now have is
likely to decrease; and though robberies are punished with
severity, there is not a week passes but there are people who
lose their provisions and clothes, which in our present situation
it is impossible to prevent.<br>
<br>
I should hope that few convicts will be sent out this year or the
next, unless they are artificers, and after what I have had the
honor of observing to your lordship, I make no doubt but proper
people will be sent to superintend them. The ships that bring out
convicts should have at least the two years' provisions on board
to land with them; for the putting the convicts on board some
ships, and the provisions that were to support them in others, as
was done, I beg leave to observe, much against my inclination,
must have been fatal if the ship carrying the provisions had been
lost.</blockquote>

<br>
<b>The First Plan Of Sydney.</b><br>
<small>[Available at the National Library of Australia website as
NLA Map nk2456-124-v]</small></p>
<br>
<p>In the natural course of events, the growth of the social
organism with which Phillip was charged had now so far advanced
that the formation of a town had begun to occupy his attention.
With the assistance of his Surveyor-General, Mr. Alt, an ex-Baron
of Hesse Cassel, he designed a plan for the purpose, a copy of
which he enclosed in his despatch. His description of the infant
city shows how deeply he was impressed with the conviction that
it was destined to become prosperous as well as permanent; that
the huts and thatch-roofed buildings of his day would soon give
way to structures of a more durable kind; and that in place of a
few wretched stragglers from the army of civilised life, the
shores of Sydney Cove would in time be peopled with an energetic
population of free-men, attracted by the prospect of independence
in a new and beautiful country. That belief sustained him in all
his trials. Among the many proofs of political sagacity to be
found in the course of his administration, there was none more
remarkable than his suggestion for the prevention of narrow
streets, "and the many inconveniences which the increase of
inhabitants would otherwise occasion hereafter." Had his views on
this subject been carried out, narrow streets and irregular
buildings would never have disfigured one of the finest sites for
a city which the world can show. In this instance, however, it
was unfortunately destined that the foresight of a statesman
should be controlled by the force of ignoble circumstances.
Phillip at this time had no doubt dreamed the same dream that
Darwin afterwards clothed in resounding verse:&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">There shall broad streets their stately walls
extend,<br>
The circus widen and the crescent bend;</p>
<p>but to realise the dream proved a more difficult matter than
he had supposed. It was easy enough to plan streets two hundred
feet wide, and to mark out the sites for public buildings of
proportionate dimensions; but no sooner had he set to work than
he found himself compelled to abandon his scheme for want of the
necessary workmen; all the mechanics in the place being
insufficient for his purpose. Then he learned that there was no
means of making lime, and consequently that nothing could be done
in stone; whereupon he was obliged to fall back on bricks and
timber, and to content himself with a suggestion that lime should
be sent out as ballast in the transports. It was still more
aggravating to find that all the tools brought out from England
had proved to be of the very worst kind&#8212;"as bad as ever
were sent out for barter on the coast of Guinea."</p>
<blockquote>I have the honor to enclose your lordship the
intended plan for the town. The Lieutenant-Governor has already
begun a small house, which forms one corner of the parade; and I
am building a small cottage on the east side of the cove, where I
shall remain for the present with part of the convicts and an
officer's guard. The convicts on both sides are distributed in
huts, which are built only for immediate shelter. On the point of
land which forms the west side of the cove, an observatory is
building under the direction of Lieutenant Dawes, who is charged
by the Board of Longitude with observing the expected comet. The
temporary buildings are marked in black; those intended to
remain, in red. We now make very good bricks, and the stone is
good, but do not find either limestone or chalk. As stores and
other buildings will be begun in the course of a few months, some
regular plan for the town was necessary, and in laying out of
which I have endeavoured to place all public buildings in
situations that will be eligible hereafter, and to give a
sufficient share of ground for the stores, hospital, &amp;c., to
be enlarged as may be necessary in the future. The principal
streets are placed so as to admit a free circulation of air, and
are two hundred feet wide. The ground marked for Government House
is intended to include the main guard, Civil and Criminal Courts;
and as the ground that runs to the southward is nearly level, and
a very good situation for buildings, streets will be laid out in
such a manner as to afford a free air; and when the houses are to
be built, if it meets with your lordship's approbation, the land
will be granted with a clause that will ever prevent more than
one house being built on the allotment, which will be sixty feet
in front and one hundred and fifty feet in depth; this will
preserve uniformity in the buildings, prevent narrow streets, and
the many inconveniences which the increase of inhabitants would
otherwise occasion hereafter.<br>
<br>
The hospital is a building that will stand for some years; it is
clear of the town, and the situation is healthy. The barracks and
huts now building for the officers and men will stand three or
four years. If water could be found by sinking wells on the high
ground between the town and the hospital, I proposed building the
barracks on that spot, and surrounding with such works as we may
be able to make, and which I did intend beginning as soon as the
transports were cleared and the men hutted; but I now find that
without some additional workmen the progress must be so very slow
that the design is laid aside, and the only building I shall
attempt will be a store-house that will be secure, those we have
already built being not only in danger from fire, from being
thatched, but of material that will not stand more than two
years. The barracks and all buildings in future will be covered
with shingles, which we now make from a tree like the pine-tree
in appearance, the wood resembling the English oak.</blockquote>
<p>The monotony of daily life in the Camp was ever and anon
disturbed by a sudden alarm of an outrage committed by the
natives. At this time they were swarming in the neighbourhood of
the settlement, always on the look out for unarmed stragglers
whom they could pick off from behind a gum-tree, and whose lives
were taken without scruple in revenge for the canoes and
fishing-tackle stolen from them on the beaches. According to
native law, it was not at all necessary to identify the thief;
the tribe to which he belonged was held responsible for his act,
and had to pay the penalty. The memory of one of these tragedies
is perpetuated in the name given to a bay in the harbour, still
known as Rushcutters' Bay. Phillip's account of the matter
presents one of the best sides of his character:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The 30th of May two men employed collecting thatch at
some distance from the camp were found dead. One of them had four
spears in him, one of which had passed through his body; the
other was found at some distance, dead, but without any apparent
injury. This was a very unfortunate circumstance, and the more as
it will be impossible to discover the people who committed the
murder, and I am still persuaded the natives are not the
aggressors. These men had been seen with one of their canoes, but
I was not informed of that circumstance for some days. Though I
did not mean to punish any of the natives for killing these
people, which it is more than probable they did in their own
defence, or in defending their canoes, I wished to see them; and,
as they had carried away the rushcutters' tools, I thought they
might be found out and some explanation take place, for which
purpose I went out with a small party the next day, and landed
where the men were killed; but after traversing the country more
than twenty miles, we got to the north shore of Botany Bay
without meeting any of the natives; there we saw about twenty
canoes fishing.<br>
<br>
It was then sunset, and as we made our fires and slept on the
beach, I did not doubt but some of them would join us, but not
one appeared; and the next morning, though fifty canoes were
drawn up on the beach, we could not find a single person, but, on
our return, keeping for some time near the sea-coast, we came to
a cove where a number of the natives were assembled, I believe
more than what belonged to that particular spot. Though we were
within ten yards when we first discovered each other, I had
barely time to order the party to halt before numbers appeared in
arms, and the foremost of them, as he advanced, made signs for us
to retire; but upon my going up to him, making signs of
friendship, he gave his spear to another, and in less than three
minutes we were surrounded by two hundred and twelve men. Numbers
of women and children were at a small distance, and, whether by
their superiority of numbers, for we were only twelve, or from
their not being accustomed to act with treachery, the moment the
friendship I offered was accepted on their side they joined us,
most of them laying down their spears and stone hatchets with the
greatest confidence, and afterwards brought down some of their
women to receive the little articles we had to give them. I saw
nothing to induce me to believe these people had been concerned
in the murder which had been committed. We parted on friendly
terms, and I was now more than ever convinced of the necessity of
placing confidence in these people as the only means of avoiding
a dispute. Had I gone up to them with all the party, though only
twelve, or hesitated a moment, a lance would have been thrown,
and it would have been impossible to have avoided a dispute.<br>
<br>
Here we saw the first stream of fresh water I have seen in this
country, but the cove is open to the sea. When the natives saw we
were going on towards the next cove, one of them, an old man,
made signs to let him go first, and as soon as we were at the top
of the hill he called out, holding up both his hands (a sign of
friendship) to the people in the next cove, giving them to
understand that we were friends. We did not go to that cove, but
saw about forty men, so that unless these people had assembled on
some particular occasion, the inhabitants are still more numerous
than I had imagined I have before had the honor of observing to
your lordship that we had traced the natives thirty miles inland,
and this morning, in crossing the hills between Botany Bay and
Port Jackson, we saw smoke on the top of Landsdown Hill, so that
I think there cannot be any doubt of there being inhabitants
fifty miles inland.</blockquote>
<p>How little was known of the country at this time may be seen
in Phillip's innocent remark about the existence of natives fifty
miles inland. It had not even occurred to him as a probability
that the interior of New Holland might be peopled with
aboriginals, and that those whom he saw around him might be but a
handful of the many tribes moving over its immense surface. As a
matter of fact, nothing was then known about the country or its
inhabitants beyond what had been learned from Cook's Voyage. In
the eyes of its first settlers, the land was a wilderness, and
the natives were supposed to be confined to the sea-coast.</p>
<blockquote>His Majesty's birthday was observed with every
possible mark of attention our situation permitted. The three men
that had been reprieved from death in order to be exiled were
fully pardoned, and for the twenty-four hours I believe there was
not one heavy heart in this part of his Majesty's
dominions.</blockquote>
<p>The first celebration of a royal birthday in the colony took
place on the 4th of June, when King George the Third attained his
fiftieth year. All possible honour was paid to the occasion; and
so far as ceremonies are concerned, they differed little from
those of the present day. At sun-rise, at one o'clock, and at
sunset the two men-of-war in the harbour fired a salute of
twenty-one guns each; on shore the colours were hoisted at the
Flagstaff; at twelve o'clock, the battalion of marines was under
arms, and concluded its parade by firing three vollies, followed
by three rounds of cheering. Then came a <i>lev&#233;e</i> at
Government House, at which the Lieutenant-Governor, attended by
all the officers of his corps, the captains and other officers of
the men-of-war, the members of the Civil Service, and others,
paid their respects to his excellency in person. The
<i>lev&#233;e</i> was followed by a dinner at Government House at
two o'clock, when Phillip's French cook <a href="#note-306" name=
"noteref-306" id="noteref-306">{32}</a> had an opportunity for
displaying his ingenuity. The "band of musick" from the Sirius
played God Save the King and several excellent marches during the
dinner. "After the cloth was removed"&#8212;we are indebted to
Surgeon White <a href="#note-307" name="noteref-307" id=
"noteref-307">{33}</a> for these particulars&#8212;"his Majesty's
health was drank with three cheers." Then came the Prince of
Wales, the Queen and Royal Family, the Cumberland Family, his
Royal Highness Prince William Henry, and lastly, his Majesty's
Ministers, of whom some one was good enough to say that "they
might be <i>pitted</i> against any that ever conducted the
affairs of Great Britain."</p>
<p>After the toasts had been duly honoured, Phillip informed his
guests that he had determined to create a County and to name it
the County of Cumberland, after his Royal Highness, giving it
such boundaries as would make it the largest county in the world.
To the north, it would be bounded by the northernmost point of
Broken Bay; to the south, by the southernmost point of Botany
Bay; and to the west by the great range of mountains which he had
seen for the first time during his expedition of the 15th April.
He then went on to say that he had also intended to have named
the town they were building, and to have laid the
foundation-stone of it, on that day; but the unexpected
difficulties he had met with in clearing the ground, added to the
want of mechanics, had rendered it impossible to do so. He was
therefore obliged to postpone that ceremony until a future day.
The name which Phillip thought of giving the town was never
officially mentioned by him; but, says White, "we understand it
is to be <small>ALBION</small>."</p>
<p>While the gentlemen of the civil, military, and naval
establishments were thus enjoying themselves at Government House,
the people outside were not forgotten by the Governor. The
unhappy creatures lying under sentence at Rock Island were
released: some sailors of the Sirius who had got into trouble
were pardoned; while every soldier had a pint of porter in
addition to his allowance of grog, and every convict "half a pint
of spirits made into grog", that they all might drink his
Majesty's health and be happy. Even at this early period of his
administration, Phillip had gained a reputation for kindness and
generosity in dealing with his unfortunate subjects; for White,
in mentioning "this act of lenity and mercy", speaks of "many
others which the Governor had shown." Night-time was
distinguished by "an immense bonfire", in place of a general
illumination, which everybody went forth to see; the celebrations
of the day concluding with a supper at Government House, where
Phillip and his guests "terminated the day in pleasantry, good
humour, and cheerfulness."</p>
<p>During all the festivities of the occasion, however, it was
noticed that Phillip was "in great pain from a return of his
complaint"&#8212;an attack which had seized him in the side and
loins, brought on by his having slept several nights on the wet
ground at Broken Bay, before he was perfectly recovered from the
complaint which had attacked almost everyone after the arrival of
the Fleet. His sufferings had been aggravated by "a fall into a
hollow place in the ground, concealed by the long grass" while he
was out on his last expedition in April. But "though his
countenance too plainly indicated the torture which he suffered"
while entertaining his guests on the royal birthday, "he took
every method in his power to conceal it, lest it should break in
upon the festivity and harmony of the day." This attack seems to
have troubled him greatly for a long time afterwards. In
February, 1790, he told Evan Nepean, in reply to a passage in one
of Ross's letters twitting him with his absence from
head-quarters on "parties of pleasure", that "a journey I made
soon after we landed fixed a complaint in my side which has
rendered the fatigues of examining the country round us not
parties of pleasure, but parties in which nothing but a sense of
duty and necessity would make me engage"; and that his absence on
a certain occasion took place "at a time when my state of health
was such that I should have been pleased to remain in my bed,
rather than have gone to Rose Hill to sleep on the boards in a
hut." The complaint seems to have got worse in the following
year, since in March, 1791, he wrote to Lord Granville requesting
permission to return to England, stating as a reason that "a
complaint in the side, from which, in more than two years, I have
been seldom free", had impaired his health so much as to
incapacitate him at times for duty.</p>
<blockquote>If we had been unfortunate in our live stock in
general, I had the satisfaction of seeing the cows and horses
thrive; but the man who attended the former having left them for
a short time, they strayed and were lost The loss of four cows
and two bulls will not easily be replaced. Pardon, my lord, these
tedious relations of robberies and losses; it is the only means I
have of giving your lordship a faint idea of the situation in
which I am placed. Of the live stock purchased at the Cape, part
died on the passage, and the greatest part of what remained since
landing.<br>
<br>
Having reason to believe that one of the natives had been
murdered and several wounded, which it is probable occasioned the
attack on the rushcutters, I have promised to emancipate any
convict that will discover the aggressors; it will, I hope, at
least prevent anything of the kind in future.<br>
<br>
A convict who had committed a robbery and absconded the 5th of
June returned the 24th almost starved; he found it impossible to
subsist in the woods. One of the natives gave him a fish, but
then made signs for him to go away. He says he afterwards joined
a party of the natives, who would have burned him but that he got
away from them; and that he saw the remains of a human body on
the fire. In the woods he saw four of the natives who were dying,
and who made signs for food. This man was tried, pleaded guilty,
and suffered with another convict. He persisted in the story
respecting the natives intending to burn him, and I now believe
they find the procuring a subsistence very difficult, for little
fish is caught.<br>
<br>
The 22nd of this month (June) we had a slight shock of an
earthquake. It did not last more than two or three seconds. I
felt the ground shake under me, and heard a noise that came from
the southward, which I at first took for the report of guns fired
at a distance. <a href="#note-308" name="noteref-308" id=
"noteref-308">{34}</a><br>
<br>
Tho' we have had heavy rains at the change of the moon, this
cannot be called a rainy season. The climate is a very fine one,
and the country will, I make no doubt, when the woods are cleared
away, be as healthy as any in the world, but is, I believe,
subject to violent storms of thunder and lightning. Soon after we
landed several trees were fired by the lightning, and several
sheep and hogs killed in the camp.</blockquote>
<p>The climatic changes which took place during the early years
of the colony are frequently referred to by Phillip and his
contemporaries. The thunderstorms were sudden and violent; rain
fell in torrents; trees were frequently split by lightning, and
animals standing under them killed; in winter it was so cold that
ice was common at Parramatta, and large hailstones fell when it
rained; while the heat in summer, especially when the hot winds
blew, was intolerably severe. The cause of the extreme heat was a
subject of much discussion, some attributing it to the practice,
common among the natives, of setting the bush on fire. Tench made
a better guess when he accounted for it "by the wind blowing over
immense desarts, which, I doubt not, exist in a north-west
direction from Port Jackson." <a href="#note-309" name=
"noteref-309" id="noteref-309">{35}</a></p>
<p>The sudden variations of the weather were at first attributed
to the changes of the moon; but according to Tench, "lunar empire
afterwards lost its credit", and the violent outbursts of the
elements were regarded as peculiar to the country. Experience
proved them to be nothing more than the usual results of dense
vegetation in semi-tropical countries, unoccupied by civilised
men.</p>
<p>The difference in temperature felt at Sydney and Rose Hill,
only twelve miles apart, was a subject of common remark: the
extremes of heat and cold being felt at one place in much greater
intensity than at the other. But although the changes in the
weather were so frequent that "clouds, storms, and sunshine
passed in rapid succession", it was agreed that the climate
itself could not be healthier. Animals of all kinds seemed to
thrive under its influence; and as a conclusive proof of its
invigorating effect. Tench mentions that "women, who certainly
would never have bred in any other climate, here produced as fine
children as ever were born." <a href="#note-310" name=
"noteref-310" id="noteref-310">{36}</a></p>
<blockquote>Of the convicts, thirty-six men and four women died
on the passage, twenty men and eight women since landing, eleven
men and one woman absconded, four have been executed, and three
killed by the natives. The number of convicts now employed in
erecting the necessary buildings and cultivating the lands only
amounts to three hundred and twenty-six, and the whole number of
people victualled amounts to nine hundred and
sixty-six&#8212;consequently we have only the labour of a part to
provide for the whole.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will doubtless see the necessity of employing a
considerable force in the country, and I presume an addition of
five hundred men will be absolutely requisite to enable me to
detach three or four companies to the more open country near the
head of the harbour.<br>
<br>
I could have wished to have given your lordship a more pleasing
account of our present situation, and am persuaded I shall have
that satisfaction hereafter; nor do I doubt but that this country
will prove the most valuable acquisition Great Britain ever made;
at the same time no country offers less assistance to the first
settlers than this does; nor do I think any country could be more
disadvantageously placed with respect to support from the mother
country, on which for a few years we must entirely
depend.</blockquote>
<p>However depressed Phillip may have felt while recounting his
troubles and difficulties, his confidence in the future of the
colony seems to have become more and more a settled conviction
within him. Considering that he was not at all given to the use
of exaggerated language, and that his views of things were
decidedly prosaic, the expression of his opinion on this subject
is certainly remarkable.</p>
<p>Evidently relying on his good friend Evan Nepean for
assistance in his difficulties, Phillip lost no opportunity for
keeping him acquainted with the state of affairs in the
settlement. His despatches to the Secretary of State were usually
accompanied by letters to the Under Secretary, in which the
contents of the former were repeated in still plainer and more
emphatic language. The point which he was most anxious to impress
on the Ministerial mind at this time was, the necessity for
keeping up a regular supply of provisions.</p>
<p>Although the First Fleet had sailed with supplies calculated
to last for two years, <a href="#note-311" name="noteref-311" id=
"noteref-311">{37}</a> it had become manifest to Phillip, before
he had been six months in the country, that he would have to
depend on regular supplies from England for at least four or five
years to come. According to the original estimate, the provisions
put on board the ships were not expected to last more than two
years, and therefore another store-ship ought to have been at
anchor in the harbour during 1789. Unfortunately, Sydney was
sanguine enough to suppose that the cultivation of the land,
added to the natural products of the country, would enable
Phillip to procure the necessaries of life for his people with
very little difficulty. Any practical farmer might have pointed
out the danger of relying on such expectations; but it so
happened that the difficulties of farming in a new country were
never taken into calculation by the Government, until they forced
themselves on their attention through the medium of Phillip's
bitter experience.</p>
<blockquote>You will see by my letters to Lord Sydney that this
colony must for some years depend on supplies from England.<br>
<br>
The Sirius will be sent to the northward for live stock as soon
as we can spare her carpenters; and from what Monsieur la
P&#233;rouse said to Captain Hunter, one of the Isles des
Navigateurs is the most likely to furnish us with what we want;
but though these islands supply two or three ships very
abundantly, they will afford but very little towards the support
of this colony, the situation of which I have particularly
pointed out in my letters to Lord Sydney, and which I shall
recapitulate in this, as the ship by which I now write may arrive
before either of those that have my despatches on
board.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip's instructions authorised him to take on board, at any
place he might touch at on the voyage out, any number of black
cattle, sheep, goats, or hogs which he could procure, and also to
send the Sirius and the Supply to the islands in order to barter
with the natives for further supplies. For that purpose, he was
told, "a quantity of arms and other articles of merchandise" had
been put on board the ships; and he was expressly required to
confine his trading operations as much as possible "to such parts
as are not in the possession or under the jurisdiction of other
European Powers." <a href="#note-312" name="noteref-312" id=
"noteref-312">{38}</a> The ordinary construction of this language
would lead the reader to suppose that Phillip was left at liberty
to make what purchases of live stock he might think fit, at the
Cape or any other place; and that the authority to trade with the
natives of the islands for further supplies was given for the
purpose of enabling him to increase his stock from time to time
with greater facility than he could otherwise have done.</p>
<p>It seems tolerably clear, however, from the official
correspondence, that he was not left entirely to his own
discretion in the matter of purchases; but that he was
stringently cautioned against drawing bills on the Treasury,
either for live stock or anything else, for any larger amount
than he could possibly avoid. He was tied down to the strictest
economy in every particular. The apologetic character of his
letters, when referring to his drafts on the Exchequer, is
sufficient to show the limit of his powers in any matter
involving expenditure. Some live stock, of course, would have to
be taken on board the Fleet for immediate purposes on its
arrival, and for that reason he was authorised to make necessary
purchases on his way out; but for any. further supplies that
might be required he was directed to look to "the islands
adjacent"&#8212;that is, any islands in the South Pacific at
which live stock might be had. The secret of that singular
instruction, apparently, was economy; Sydney being evidently
under the impression that barter with the natives would be a much
cheaper transaction than buying openly in a Dutch market.
<a href="#note-313" name="noteref-313" id="noteref-313">{39}</a>
The accounts in Cook's Voyages of the facility with which his
ships had been supplied at different islands gave rise to that
impression; but his lordship overlooked the material difference,
pointed out by Phillip, between taking in provisions for two or
three ships and obtaining regular supplies for a colony. Another
and still more important point which did not occur to the
Minister was the very dangerous character of the navigation among
the islands at that time. The South Pacific was practically
unexplored, and Phillip was naturally reluctant to send either of
his ships on such a perilous cruise.</p>
<blockquote>The Lieutenant-Governor has about four acres of land
in cultivation; I have from eight to ten in wheat and barley. The
officers will be able to raise sufficient to support the little
live stock they have, and which is all that can be expected from
them. All the corn raised this year and the next will be saved
for seed, and, if necessity should oblige us to use it, would be
only a few days support for the colony, and from the rats and
other vermin the crops are very uncertain.<br>
<br>
All the provisions we have to depend on until supplies arrive
from England are in two wooden buildings, which are thatched. I
am sensible of the risk, but have no remedy.<br>
<br>
The greatest part of the stock brought from the Cape is dead, and
from the inattention of the men who had the care of the cattle,
those belonging to Government and two cows belonging to myself,
are lost. As they have been missing three weeks, it is probable
they are killed by the natives. All my sheep are dead, and a few
only remain of those purchased for Government.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip does not mention in his despatches that he had caused
a return to be prepared by the Commissary, showing the exact
number of live stock in the settlement on the 1st May. <a href=
"#note-314" name="noteref-314" id="noteref-314">{40}</a>
Including under that head horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs,
the number brought from the Cape on public account was
ninety-one; but no record was kept of the stock brought by
private individuals. On the 1st May, the population of the Cove
could only muster one hundred and thirty-six out of the total
number of animals landed in January. As the difference between
the two totals amounts to forty-five only, it follows that either
the importations on private account were very small, or the
mortality was very great. Phillip mentions in his despatch of
28th September that he had brought over seventy sheep with him on
his own and on Government account, but that one only remained
alive when he wrote. The natural grass was considered to be fatal
to them; for those which were fed by their owners outside their
tents managed to survive their companions.</p>
<p>The loss of the cattle referred to by Phillip&#8212;two bulls
and five cows&#8212;became in later years one of the romantic
incidents of the time. After many ineffectual attempts to recover
the runaways, all hope of seeing them again was at last
abandoned; the general theory being that they had been killed and
eaten by the natives. <a href="#note-315" name="noteref-315" id=
"noteref-315">{41}</a> It was not until November, 1795, that the
cattle were heard of again, when reports were brought in to
Governor Hunter to the effect that they had multiplied into a
herd, and were to be seen grazing on the banks of the Nepean, in
pastures as rich as those of a typical English landscape. The
narrative of their recovery in Collins furnishes almost the only
instance in which that severe writer allows himself to speak
approvingly of Australian scenery. <a href="#note-316" name=
"noteref-316" id="noteref-316">{42}</a> Not the least remarkable
fact connected with this event is the peculiar display of
instinct which led cattle, bred at the Cape of Good Hope, to such
distant pasturage.</p>
<p>To show still more conclusively how dependent the colony was
on supplies from England, Phillip proceeds to point out that the
nearest places to which he could send for assistance in an
emergency&#8212;the Cape of Good Hope and Batavia&#8212; were too
remote to be of much service. He would not feel justified in
sending a ship to either of those places "unless in case of the
greatest necessity"; and if it should come to that, he was afraid
that it would in all probability be too late. Neither the Sirius
nor the Supply was noted for its sailing capacity; the latter,
according to King, sailed "very ill", while the former, a
store-ship converted into a man-of-war for the expedition, had
become leaky; and as one took sixty-six days and the other
sixty-eight to make the run from the Cape to Botany Bay, it was
clear that a voyage to the Cape and back would be attended with
great delay in any case. But the necessity for adopting this
course came upon Phillip sooner than he had expected when writing
to Nepean. He found himself compelled to send the Sirius to the
Cape for a six months' supply of flour and other necessaries in
less than three months afterwards; the voyage there and back
occupied seven months, and the ship narrowly escaped being
wrecked on Tasman's Head. <a href="#note-317" name="noteref-317"
id="noteref-317">{43}</a> Even if these ships had been better
fitted for such a service than they were, the navigation of the
adjacent seas was so little known at the time, and consequently
so dangerous, that even the route by which they should sail was a
matter of grave uncertainty among seamen. <a href="#note-318"
name="noteref-318" id="noteref-318">{44}</a></p>
<blockquote>With respect to any resources that the Cape of Good
Hope might afford, I have only to observe that during the strong
westerly winds that prevail all the year between that Cape and
the southern extremity of this country would render a passage to
the Cape very tedious, if attempted to the southward, and little
less so if ships go to the northward. Batavia and our own
settlements are at a great distance, and when the transports are
sailed I shall have only the Sirius to employ on a service of
this kind; and as I should not think myself at liberty to send
either to the Cape or to the East Indies, unless in a case of the
greatest necessity, it would in all probability then be too late.
I mention these circumstances just to show the real situation of
the colony, and I make no doubt but that supplies will arrive in
time, <i>and on which alone I depend</i>.<br>
<br>
The provisions sent to support this colony for two years being
put on board three ships was running a very great risk, for had
they separated and afterwards been lost, the consequence is
obvious, for this country at present does not furnish the
smallest resource except in fish, and which has lately been so
scarce that the natives find great difficulty in supporting
themselves.<br>
<br>
Any accident of this kind will be guarded against, of course, and
soldiers or convicts when sent out will be put on board the ships
with provisions to serve them for two years after they land; and
in our present situation I hope few convicts will be sent out,
for one year at least, except carpenters, masons, and
bricklayers, or farmers, who can support themselves and assist in
supporting others. Numbers of those now here are a burthen and
incapable of any hard labour, and unfortunately we have not
proper people to keep those to their labour who are capable of
being made useful.<br>
<br>
Officers decline the least interference with the convicts, unless
when they are immediately employed for their (the officers') own
conveniency, or when they are called out at the head of their
men. The saying of a few words to encourage the diligent when
they saw them at work, and the pointing out the idle, when they
could do it without going out of their way, was all that was
desired. The convicts were then employed clearing the ground on
which the officers were encamped, and this they refused. They did
not suppose that they were sent out to do more than garrison
duty; and these gentlemen (that is, the majority of the officers)
think the being obliged to sit as members of the Criminal Court a
hardship, and for which they are not paid, and likely think
themselves hardly dealt by in that Government had not determined
what lands were to be given them. But I presume an additional
force will be sent out when the necessity of making detachments
in order to cultivate lands in the more open country is known,
and from four to six hundred men will, I think, be absolutely
necessary.</blockquote>
<p>In explaining to Nepean the position taken up by the officers
of marines, in reply to the suggestions made to them for the
management of the convicts, Phillip referred to the matter
without any display of irritation. Situated as he was at that
time, nothing could have been more disheartening than the studied
selfishness and want of consideration shown by those gentlemen.
Without any overseers or superintendents, and consequently
without any means of exercising moral control over the convicts,
the Governor had a right to expect the cordial co-operation of
the officers in preserving order and promoting good conduct among
the degraded creatures by whom they were surrounded. It would not
have cost the marines anything to comply with his wishes, while
the results he hoped for would probably have followed from the
line of policy which he sought to establish. The only alternative
was to leave the course of events to shape its own channel.</p>
<blockquote>If fifty farmers were sent out with their families,
they would do more in one year in rendering this colony
independent of the mother country, <i>as to provisions</i>, than
a thousand convicts. There is some clear land which is intended
to be cultivated at some distance from the camp, and I intended
to send out convicts for that purpose under the direction of a
person that was going to India in the Charlotte transport, but
who remained to settle in this country, and has been brought up a
farmer, but several of the convicts (three) having been lately
killed by the natives, I am obliged to defer it until a
detachment can be made.</blockquote>
<p>His Majesty, a injunction that "you do, immediately upon your
landing, proceed to the cultivation of the land", was painfully
present to Phillip's mind from the day he landed at Sutherland
Point and looked anxiously about him for the meadows he expected
to find there. But in his efforts to carry out his instructions,
day by day served to reveal some new difficulty. In the first
place, he could not find any land that was fit to cultivate, for
some months after his arrival; in the second, he had no persons
at his disposal who understood the work of cultivation; in the
third, the farming implements with which he was supplied were of
the least serviceable kind; and in the fourth, nearly all the
seed he had brought with him had gone bad. Under such
circumstances, his agricultural prospects could not have been a
subject for rejoicing.</p>
<p>The most discouraging of all his difficulties was the
worthless character of the men whom he had to depend upon in his
farming operations. They neither understood the work itself, nor
would they make the least effort to learn it; in his own words,
"the dread of work was greater in their eyes than the fear of
punishment." They would not have been so difficult to deal with
had there been a sufficient number of properly qualified
overseers to look after them; but when those officials had to be
chosen from among themselves, it soon became clear that men so
selected either had not any influence over the others, or they
had no wish to exercise the authority entrusted to them. It was
not less clear that they had very little interest in making their
former companions work against their will. After much painful
experience, the conclusion was at last forced upon Phillip that,
in the hands of such men, the cultivation of soil was a
systematic deception; and that the only means by which the colony
could be made self-supporting was by settling farmers on the
land, supplying them with a certain amount of convict labour, as
well as provisions for two years, under proper regulations. In
deference to his urgent and repeated representations on this
head, the Government ultimately consented to adopt his
suggestions; and from that point the prosperity of the colony may
be said to have begun. But no free settlers were sent out until
1793.</p>
<blockquote>The natives are far more numerous than they were
supposed to be. I think they cannot be less than one thousand
five hundred in Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay,
including the intermediate coast. I have traced them thirty miles
inland, and, having lately seen smoke on Landsdown Hills, which
are fifty miles inland, I think leaves no doubt but that there
are inhabitants in the interior parts of the country.<br>
<br>
Lists of what articles are most wanted will be sent by the
Commissary; and I am very sorry to say that not only a great part
of the cloathing, particularly the women's, is very bad, but most
of the axes, spades, and shovels the worst that ever were seen.
The provision is as good. Of the seeds and corn sent from
England, part has been destroyed by the weevil; the rest is in
good order.<br>
<br>
The person I have appointed Provost-Marshall is likewise very
useful in superintending the carpenters The person sent out by
the contractor, who assists the Commissary in the delivery of
provisions, one that was clerk of the Sirius, a master smith, and
two farmers, are very useful people, and I beg leave to recommend
them to Government. The granting them lands would draw their
attention from their present occupations.</blockquote>
<p>The person appointed Provost-Marshal was Henry Brewer, a
midshipman of the Sirius, who was appointed on the voyage out, as
mentioned by Phillip in one of his letters from Rio. The title
was a military one, and in the army the duties of the office were
analogous to those of the head of a police department. <a href=
"#note-319" name="noteref-319" id="noteref-319">{45}</a> The
Provost-Marshal appointed by Phillip was not attached to the
garrison but to the settlement, and consequently he was a civil
and not a military officer. The appointment, however, serves to
illustrate the distinctly military character of the organisation
under which the colony was founded. It was essentially a Camp in
the first instance, and was governed according to military ideas.
Phillip made the appointment in question under section II of the
Act of 1787, which directed the Provost-Marshal to execute the
judgments pronounced by the Criminal Court. <a href="#note-320"
name="noteref-320" id="noteref-320">{46}</a> Every sentence
passed by that Court was carried out under his supervision, and
he was responsible for its due execution.</p>
<blockquote>The Fishburn store-ship is detained until a proper
place can be provided for the spirits; and the rains have for
some days prevented the landing the remainder of the provisions
from the Golden Grove, therefore those two ships will sail
together, I hope by the end of August; the other ships have all
cleared, and preparing to sail.</blockquote>
<p>The Fishburn and the Golden Grove sailed for England on the
19th November, carrying the despatches written between that date
and the 2nd October. By "the other ships", Phillip meant the
Alexander, Prince of Wales, Friendship, and Borrowdale, which
sailed on the 14th July, carrying the despatches written
previously. There were thus only two opportunities for sending
letters direct to England during the year. The three ships which
sailed for China in the first week of May did not carry any mail
for England. They were under charter to the East India Company,
to carry cargoes of "tea and other merchandize" from Canton to
London. They had been unloaded in Sydney Cove much more quickly
than the other ships, on account of the express instructions
given on that point, "a very considerable saving" being thereby
effected in freight.</p>
<blockquote>The masters of the transports having left with the
agents the bonds and whatever papers they received that related
to the convicts, I have no account of the time for which the
convicts are sentenced, or the dates of their convictions. Some
of them, by their own account, have little more than a year to
remain, and I am told will apply for permission to return to
England or to go to India in such ships as may be willing to
receive them. If lands are granted them, Government will be
obliged to support them for two years; and it is more than
probable that one half of them, after that time is expired, will
still want support. Until I receive instructions on this head, of
course, none will be permitted to leave the settlement; but if,
when the time for which they are sentenced expires, the most
abandoned and useless were permitted to go to China in any ships
that may stop here, it would be a great advantage to the
settlement.</blockquote>
<p>The dilemma in which Phillip was placed when it was discovered
that through the negligence of the Government officials and the
masters of the transports, there was no means of ascertaining the
terms for which the convicts had been sentenced, or even the
dates of their convictions, proved an awkward one when the men
concerned came forward to claim their discharge. According to the
law then in force, the servitude of the prisoners had been
transferred from the Crown to the masters of the transports, who
had entered into bonds for the performance of their contracts to
transport them; and Phillip was instructed to take care, before
the transports were discharged, to obtain an assignment of the
servitude from the masters to himself. <a href="#note-321" name=
"noteref-321" id="noteref-321">{47}</a> The discovery that all
the official papers relating to the convictions had been left
behind was no doubt made when he called upon the masters to
execute these assignments. Had the officials in charge of the
business done their duty, he would not have been left without the
necessary information. A list of the convicts sent out in the
First Fleet, specifying their names, where convicted, date of
conviction, and the terms of their sentences, was published as an
appendix to Phillip's Voyage; and if such a list had been placed
in his hands before he sailed, no difficulty could have arisen in
the matter.</p>
<p>According to the list of names published in that work, out of
a total of seven hundred and seventy-five persons transported,
there were only twenty sentenced to fourteen years and thirty-six
to life. The rest were sentenced to seven years, or less. The
number of persons convicted of serious offences did not,
therefore, exceed fifty-six; a very small proportion to the whole
number. Under the penal legislation of the time, a sentence of
five or seven years' transportation was passed only in cases of
minor offences; so that the great majority of the persons sent
out in the First Fleet did not by any means represent the worst
sections of the criminal class.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there was no difference, so far as the
sentence was concerned, between one for five years and one for
life; seeing that there was no chance of escape from the
settlement in either case. Jeremy Bentham argued that the convict
whose sentence had expired was entitled to a return passage to
England, and that detention in the colony after expiration of the
term was false imprisonment:&#8212;"Was it [the intention] that
they should be left fixed for life on the spot to which they were
consigned with such nicety of discrimination for fourteen, seven,
and five years? If so, what is the sentence, or the pretended
execution of it, but a mockery of justice?" <a href="#note-322"
name="noteref-322" id="noteref-322">{48}</a></p>
<blockquote>A convict who fled to the woods after committing a
robbery returned after being absent eighteen days, forced in by
hunger. He had got some small support from the people and the few
fish left by accident on the beach, after hauling the seine, and
had endeavoured to live amongst the natives, but they could give
him but little assistance. He says that they are now greatly
distressed for food, and that he saw several dying with hunger.
It is possible that some of the natives at this time of the year
might find it easier to support themselves on birds and such
animals as shelter themselves in the hollow trees, than on fish;
but then, I think, they would not go to the top of the mountains,
where at present it must be very cold. I intend going to
Landsdown or Carmarthen Hills as soon as the weather permits, if
it is possible, and which will explain, what is at present a
mystery to me, how people who have not the least idea of
cultivation can maintain themselves in the interior parts of this
country. When I went to the westward in hopes of being able to
reach the mountains, we carried six days' provisions, and
proceeded five days to the westward. Returning we were very short
of provisions, and our guns only procured us two scanty
meals.</blockquote>
<p>The mystery which puzzled Phillip and his contemporaries so
much&#8212;how the natives contrived to keep themselves alive in
the bush&#8212;remained a mystery for many years after his time.
It was not until the explorers of comparatively recent days made
their way into the interior, that the means of subsistence
available to the natives inland became known. The idea that the
native population was confined to the sea-coast was almost
universally entertained, in the first instance; and the interior
of the country was looked upon as an uninhabited wilderness, in
which it would be impossible to find sufficient food to maintain
life for a week. Hence the stories about natives seen "dying with
hunger" in the bush, and human bodies roasting on their
fires&#8212;as if they had been driven to cannibal practices in
order to save themselves from starvation. The fact was that,
except in times of drought, the inland natives were well supplied
by nature. <a href="#note-323" name="noteref-323" id=
"noteref-323">{49}</a></p>
<blockquote>I shall now conclude with saying that I have no doubt
but that the country will hereafter prove a most valuable
acquisition to Great Britain, though at present no country can
afford less support to the first settlers, or be more
disadvantageously placed for receiving support from the mother
country, on which it must for a time depend. It will require
patience and perseverance, neither of which will, I hope, be
wanting on my part.</blockquote>
<p>Here Phillip closed his letter; but the two following
paragraphs were afterwards added:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>His Majesty's Commission, with that for establishing
the Courts of Civil and Criminal Judicature, were read soon after
landing; and as it is necessary in public acts to name the
county, I named it Cumberland, and fixed its boundaries by
Carmarthen and Landsdown Hills to the westward, by the northern
parts of Broken Bay to the northward, and by the southernmost
part of Botany Bay to the southward.<br>
<br>
I have enclosed copies of a letter I have received from the
surgeon, reporting the state of the hospital and the great
necessity of <i>blankets</i> and <i>sheets</i>, as well as sugar,
and those articles coming; under the denomination of necessaries,
and the want of which is equally felt by the marines and
convicts.</blockquote>
<p>The necessity of providing for the wants of the sick was
frequently referred to in Phillip's letters before the First
Fleet sailed. Although there was every reason to anticipate
attacks of scurvy and other complaints, not only during the
passage but after the arrival of the ships in port, the most
ordinary precautions seem to have been neglected. With all his
efforts to procure the requisite supplies, Phillip was unable to
provide the medical staff with the common necessaries of which
they were in daily need. From the Surgeon's letter to which he
referred, it appears that blankets and sheets had not been sent
out, and the patients were consequently left to lie on their beds
without them&#8212; one of the results being that "attention to
cleanliness was utterly impossible." The ordinary articles of
hospital diet were also wanting; there was no sugar, sago,
barley, rice, oatmeal, or vinegar; and the patients were
consequently dieted on salt provisions, "without any possibility
of a change." At the time Phillip wrote on this subject, there
were over one hundred persons on the sick list; and the hospital
tents had been fully occupied from the arrival of the Fleet.
According to White, no sooner had the tents been put up than they
were "filled with patients afflicted with the true camp dysentery
and the scurvy. More pitiable objects were perhaps never seen.
Not a comfort or convenience could be got for them, besides the
very few we had with us." <a href="#note-324" name="noteref-324"
id="noteref-324">{50}</a></p>
<p>In another last note to Nepean, Phillip mentioned some other
necessaries which were very much needed at the same time. The
italics in this letter, as well as the spelling, are his own.</p>
<blockquote>To the articles which I have mentioned as more
immediately wanted, the following, tho' so very necessary, have
escaped my memory till this moment:&#8212;<i>Leather for soals
for the men's shooes and the materials for mending them</i>.
Shooes here last but a very short time, and the want of these
materials, and thread to mend the cloathing, will render it
impossible to make them serve more than half the time for which
they were intended. This country requires warm cloathing in the
winter. The rains are frequent, and the nights very cold.<br>
<br>
Vinegar will be very acceptable; it is much wanted.</blockquote>
<p>The next despatch to Lord Sydney was written in compliance
with the Royal instruction that full reports should be
transmitted with respect to the natives, and also concerning "the
actual state and quality of the soil at and near the settlement,
the probable and most effectual means of improving and
cultivating the same, and of the mode, and upon what terms and
conditions, the lands should be granted." <a href="#note-325"
name="noteref-325" id="noteref-325">{51}</a> Phillip was not at
this time in a position to report specially upon either of these
topics. All the information he had been able to gather about them
he had already conveyed to the Home Secretary; but conceiving
that something in the shape of a formal report was expected from
him, he proceeded to summarise the results of his reflections in
the following manner:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>In obedience to the instructions I received under the
Royal Sign Manual respecting the natives, and transmitting an
account of the nature and quality of the soil in and near the
settlement, and the mode, and upon what terms and conditions,
according to the best of my judgement, lands may be
granted,&#8212;<br>
<br>
I have the honor of informing your lordship that the natives have
ever been treated with the greatest humanity and attention, and
every precaution that was possible has been taken to prevent
their receiving any insults; and when I shall have time to mix
more with them, every means shall be used to reconcile them to
live amongst us, and to teach them the advantages they will reap
from cultivating the land, which will enable them to support
themselves at this season of the year, when fish are so scarce
that many of them perish with hunger&#8212;at least I have strong
reason to suppose that to be the case. Their number in the
neighbourhood of this settlement, that is, within ten miles to
the northward and ten miles to the southward, I reckon at one
thousand five hundred.<br>
<br>
With respect to the soil, I have had the honor of informing your
lordship that near the head of the harbour there is a tract of
country running to the westward for many miles, which appears to
be in general rich good land. The breadth of this tract of
country I have not yet been able to examine, but I believe it to
be considerable. These lands and several particular spots may be
settled, and the ground cleared of timber, without the great
labour we experience in the situation in which I have been
obliged to fix the colony.<br>
<br>
Farmers and people used to the cultivation of lands, if sent out
(and without which agriculture will make but a very slow
progress), must be supported by Government for two or three
years, and have the labour of a certain number of convicts to
assist them for that time, after which they may be able to
support themselves, and to take the convicts sent out at the
expense which Government is put to for their transportation; but
then, I presume, none should be sent whose sentence is for a less
term than fourteen years. A yearly fine to be paid for the lands
granted, after the fifth year, the fine to be in grain, and in
proportion to the crop; and this, I should hope, would be the
only tax laid on the crops, giving the Church lands in the room
of tythes.<br>
<br>
The sending out settlers who will be interested in the labour of
the convicts, and in the cultivation of the country, appears to
me to be absolutely necessary.<br>
<br>
Lands granted to officers or settlers will, I presume, be on
condition of a certain proportion of the land so granted being
cultivated or cleared within a certain time, and which time and
quantity can only be determined by the nature of the ground and
situation of the lands. And, in that case, when lands are granted
to officers the garrison must be sufficient for the service of
the place, and to permit such officers occasionally to be absent
at the lands they are to cultivate, and for a certain time. They
likewise must be allowed convicts, who must be maintained at the
expense of the Crown.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will be pleased to consider this opinion as given
in obedience to orders, on a subject which requires more
consideration than I can give it at present, and at a time when I
have only a very superficial knowledge of the country for a few
miles around.</blockquote>
<p>Although Phillip's knowledge of the country was necessarily
superficial, his remarks on the subject contain the germ of the
policy which was subsequently adopted by the Government, and
which ultimately led to the successful results obtained under
later administrations. The only practicable means by which the
labour of the convicts could be utilised was by assigning them to
settlers, whose sense of self-interest would induce them to
supervise their labourers efficiently, and by that means extract
from them a reasonable amount of work. This system differed
essentially from the American, which amounted to nothing more
than a sale of the convict from the master of the transport to
the planter, for the unexpired term of the sentence,&#8212;the
Government having nothing to do with the transaction. Under
Phillip's proposals, the Government did not part with their
control over the convicts after the assignment, while the terms
of the bargain gave the employer every reason to treat his
servants properly. That this system ultimately gave rise to many
lamentable abuses does not prove that Phillip's policy was
unsound; because the abuses did not show themselves until it had
been carried to a point which he had never contemplated when
drafting his ideas on the subject.</p>
<p>The ships were now nearly ready for sea, and Phillip wrote
final letters to Sydney and Nepean a few days before they sailed.
In one to the Under Secretary, he mentions that he had sent three
copies of his despatches by different ships&#8212;the object
being to ensure not only the safety, but the earliest possible
delivery, of his correspondence. When he wrote by different
ships, he was always under a doubt as to whether "the letter last
written might not be the first received." There was no means in
those days of calculating, with any degree of accuracy, the
probable time of a ship's arrival in England.</p>
<p>As these ships were the first to undertake a voyage from Port
Jackson to England, the route by which they were to go became a
question of great importance, as well as interest, to all
concerned; and Phillip accordingly took the opinions of the
masters on the subject. Of the different routes before them, the
southern one by Van Diemen's Land was condemned because the
season was too far advanced, while the passage by Cape Horn was
objected to by the Governor. It was therefore agreed that they
should go to the northward, either through Endeavour
Straits&#8212;as they were then called&#8212;or round New Guinea;
although such a course would involve "exploring a passage through
an unknown sea perplexed with islands, by men destitute of charts
or observations of former navigators." <a href="#note-326" name=
"noteref-326" id="noteref-326">{52}</a></p>
<blockquote>By the Alexander, under the care of Lieutenant
Shortland, agent for the transports, I have sent despatches for
the Right Honourable the Lord Sydney and for yourself, with a
rough survey Despatches, of Port Jackson. Duplicates of these
despatches go by the Friendship under the care of Lieutenant
Collins, of the marines, triplicates of most by the master of the
Borrowdale, and a quadriplicate of my publick letter to you by
the Prince of Wales. With your despatches I have sent duplicates
and triplicates of my publick letters to the Admiralty and Navy
Board, and I have taken the liberty of troubling you with some
private letters.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Shortland is likewise charged with a box of letters
from Monsieur la P&#233;rouse for the French
Ambassador.</blockquote>
<p>The box of letters for the French Ambassador in London
contained La P&#233;rouse's account of his voyage from Kamschatka
to Botany Bay, and of his stay there from the 26th January to the
10th March. He had no doubt a good deal to say about the English
ships he had met coming out of the bay while he was beating in,
and of the subsequent proceedings of their commodore. In the last
lines written by him in the published narrative of his Voyage, he
wrote that the lieutenant sent on board his ship "appeared to
make a great mystery of Commodore Phillip's plan, and we did not
take the liberty of putting any questions to him on the subject.
The crew of the English boat, less discreet than their officer,
soon informed our people that they were going to Port Jackson,
sixteen miles north of Point Banks, where Commodore Phillip had
himself reconnoitred a very good harbour, which ran ten miles
into the land to the south-west, and in which the ships might
anchor within pistol-shot of the shore, in water as smooth as
that of a basin." <a href="#note-327" name="noteref-327" id=
"noteref-327">{53}</a> The reason why the French ships stayed so
long was not known to Phillip; nor did he express any curiosity
on the subject. The box of letters reached the French Ambassador
in March of the following year; and that was the last tidings
received from poor Jean Fran&#231;ois Galaup de la
P&#233;rouse.</p>
<blockquote>Yesterday twenty of the natives came down to the
beach, each armed with a number of spears, and seized on a good
part of the fish caught in the seine. The coxswain had been
ordered, however small the quantity he caught, always to give
them a part whenever any of them came where he was fishing, and
this was the first time they ever attempted to take any by force.
While the greatest number were seizing the fish, several stood at
a small distance with their spears poised, ready to throw them if
any resistance had been made, but the coxswain very prudently
permitted them to take what they chose, and parted good friends.
They at present find it very difficult to support themselves.<br>
<br>
In consequence of what happened yesterday, no boat will in future
go down the harbour without an officer.</blockquote>
<p>Two short notes were written to Sydney, "just before the mail
closed",&#8212;as we should say&#8212;in which Phillip addressed
him as a personal friend. In the first he referred, with
unconscious pathos, to the painful position in which he found
himself placed, cut off from all society and surrounded by the
most infamous of mankind; showing at the same time what support
he derived, in the midst of his trials and privations, from the
consciousness that he was doing good work in the world. Two other
points are not less noticeable in this letter,&#8212;his
confidence in the future of the colony, and the warmth of his
friendship for King.</p>
<blockquote>The public letters to your lordship will show the
situation of this settlement and the little difficultys we have
met with, which time, an additional force, and proper people for
cultivating the land will remove; and your lordship may be
assured that, anxious to render a very essential service to my
country by the establishment of a colony, which from its
situation must hereafter be a valuable acquisition to Great
Britain, no perseverance will be wanting on my part, and which
consideration alone could make amends for the being surrounded by
the most infamous of mankind.<br>
<br>
It is to your lordship and to Nepean only that I make a
declaration of this kind. Time will remove all difficulties, and
with a few families who have been used to the cultivation of
lands this country will wear a more pleasing aspect, and those
who are to come out, knowing what the country really is, will be
less disappointed. As to myself, I am satisfied to remain as long
as my services are wanted. I am serving my country, and serving
the cause of humanity.<br>
<br>
I flatter myself that by the return of the ships that brought [?
brings] us out provisions, and <i>on which is placed our sole
dependence</i>, I shall be able to give your lordship a more
satisfactory account of this country.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Philip Gidley King, the second lieutenant of the
Sirius, who is at Norfolk Island, is a very steady, good officer,
He, too, is cut off from all society, and is in a situation that
will require patience and perseverance, both of which he
possesses, with great merit in the service as an officer. As such
I beg leave to recommend him to your lordship. The rank of master
and commander he well earned in the late war, and I should be
very happy if he now attained it thro' your lordship. <a href=
"#note-328" name="noteref-328" id=
"noteref-328">{54}</a></blockquote>
<p>The last note sent to Sydney informed him of certain presents
shipped on board the Alexander for friends in England, including
some birds from Lord Howe Island for Lady Chatham.</p>
<blockquote>The kangurroo <a href="#note-329" name="noteref-329"
id="noteref-329">{55}</a> for your lordship is the largest I have
yet seen. As it stands, it measures five feet nine inches. This
extraordinary animal makes the same use of its fore feet as a
monkey does. Major Ross has one alive. It is young, very tame,
and comes to you and embraces your hands with the fore feet. The
female was killed, and the young one remained by the
body.</blockquote>
<p>The Sirius being under orders to sail for the Cape of Good
Hope as soon as she could be got ready for sea, Phillip prepared
a despatch for the Home Secretary on the 28th September, to be
forwarded by Captain Hunter from the Cape. His original intention
was to send the ship northward&#8212;to Savu or the Navigators'
Islands&#8212;for live stock; but finding that there was no means
at that time of keeping them alive in the colony&#8212;"many
being under the necessity of frequently killing a part of what
they have for want of food to support them"&#8212;he determined
to send to the Cape for seed grain, flour, and other necessaries.
The Sirius accordingly sailed on the 2nd October.</p>
<p>The most important intelligence which Phillip had to
communicate on this occasion was the cheering prospects of the
little settlement at Norfolk Island. The good news received from
Lieutenant King, the energetic Commandant, had evidently put him
in good spirits; and in that pleasant frame of mind he proceeded
to describe the position of affairs on the island. Knowing that
great hopes were entertained in England with respect to the
probable supply of timber, canvas, and cordage for the use of the
navy, he felt some satisfaction in stating that the pine-trees
and the flax-plant were likely to answer all the expectations
that had been formed of them. The celebrity which he fondly hoped
would be acquired for those productions was never obtained; nor
had he any conception at that time of the very different
reputation which the island was destined to acquire.</p>
<blockquote>Extracts from my letters by the ships which sailed in
July accompany this letter; and I have now the honor of informing
your lordship that the Supply sailed for Norfolk Island the 17th
of July, and returning the 26th of August, brought me the
following particulars from the Commandant of that island. He says
that, immediately after being landed, they proceeded to clear
ground sufficient for building huts for themselves and a
store-house, the whole island not affording a single acre free
from timber. They were landed on the south-west end of the
island, a rough sketch of which I received from that officer, and
have the honor of enclosing your lordship. The bay in which they
landed is sheltered by a reef of coral rock, through which there
is a passage for a boat, but which, with the tide of flood when
the wind is westerly, makes the landing dangerous; and a
midshipman who was ordered to lay within the reef in order to
attend the boats coming on shore, imprudently letting the boat
drive into the surf, was lost with four men. This was the second
time the boat had been overset with that midshipman in her, and
the first time one man was lost.<br>
<br>
The want of a good landing-place and security for vessels in the
winter is the only thing to be wished for, the island being in
every other respect one of the finest in the world. The earth is
very rich&#8212;mould to the depth of five and six feet wherever
they have dug so deep&#8212;and all the grain and garden seeds
which have been put into the ground growing in the most luxuriant
manner. This island, from the great quantity of pumice-stone
found there, must formerly have been a volcano, the mouth of
which, it is probable, will be found on the top of a small
mountain near the middle of the island, which he [lieutenant
King] has named Mount Pitt. The island is exceedingly well
watered, a strong stream, which rises at or near Mount Pitt,
running through a very fine valley, sufficiently strong to turn a
mill, though divided into several branches; and very fine springs
of water are found in different parts of the island.<br>
<br>
There are several small bays, and there are some hopes of finding
a better landing-place; but the necessity of employing everyone
in sheltering themselves and the provisions from the weather, the
small number of people&#8212;only seventeen men and six
women&#8212;and the whole island being covered with wood, which a
sort of supple-jack interwoven with the trees renders almost
impassable, have hitherto prevented its being examined. With this
small number Mr. King has cleared sufficient ground to have
vegetables of every kind in the greatest abundance, three acres
in barley, part of which had been first sown with wheat, but none
of which came up, the grain being injured by the weevil; and
ground was ready to receive rice and Indian corn when the Supply
was there. All his people were in good houses, and he says that
he has no doubt but that within three years they shall be in such
a situation as to support themselves, with the assistance of a
small proportion of salt provisions; and that they will not stand
in need of that after the fourth year. They have fish in great
abundance, some turtle in the season, great number of pigeons,
and have found the plantain growing wild.<br>
<br>
The flax-plant (some roots of which I shall send by the Sirius to
the Cape to be forwarded to England) is found very luxuriant all
over the island, growing to the height of eight feet.
Unfortunately, the person I sent who called himself a
flax-dresser, cannot prepare it, as this plant requires a
different treatment in the dressing to what the European
flax-plant does. Your lordship, I presume, will order proper
persons to be sent out, by which means that island will, in a
very short time, be able to furnish a considerable quantity of
flax. The pine-trees, in the opinion of the carpenter of the
Supply, who is a good judge, are superior to any he has ever
seen; and the island affords excellent timber for ship-building,
as well as for masts and yards, with which I make no doubt but
his Majesty's ships in the East Indies may be supplied, as
likewise with pitch and tar, the only difficulty being the want
of a good landing-place; and I have not the least doubt but that
one will be found in the small bays; or if not, Mr. King proposes
blowing up two or three small rocks which make the reef
dangerous; but if disappointed in both, there will be no danger
in the summer-time; and I am assured by the master of the Supply
it will be safer for a ship to load with masts and spars at
Norfolk Island than it is in Riga Bay, where so many ships load
yearly.<br>
<br>
The Supply has been twice to the island, but in this season we
have blowing weather, and that has prevented our receiving any
spars. The Golden Grove will sail the beginning of October, with
one petty officer, a sergeant, corporal, and six marines, twenty
men and ten women convicts, and eighteen months' provisions, for
the island; and by that ship I expect spars, some of which shall
be sent to the Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy that they may
be properly examined, as I believe the wood is nearly as light as
the best Norway masts, and grows to a most extraordinary size,
some of the trees measuring from one hundred and sixty to one
hundred and eighty feet, and rise eighty feet without a branch.
The turpentine from them is very white, and in the opinion of
those who have seen it, is of the purest kind. The fern-tree is
likewise found of a good height, measuring from seventy to eighty
feet, and affords good food for the hogs, sheep, and goats, all
of which thrive; and I shall send them what live stock we now
have remaining of what was purchased on account of Government. No
quadrupeds have been seen, except rats, which at present overrun
the island, but which the cats and terrier dogs intended to be
sent will, I hope, soon destroy. Until that is done, their crops
must suffer very considerably. There are likewise great plenty of
cabbage-trees, but not a single blade of grass has been seen on
the island, the pigeons, sheep, and goats eating the leaves of
the shrubs and of particular trees, with which they grow very
fat. Two canoes were found on the rocks, probably driven from New
Zealand.<br>
<br>
They had not such heavy storms of thunder as we have experienced,
and the people have been very healthy.<br>
<br>
I think this island will answer the most sanguine expectations,
and am satisfied that the officer who commands there will, in a
very few years, not only put that island in a situation to
support itself, but to assist this colony.</blockquote>
<p>All that was known about Norfolk Island in England having been
derived from the account of it in Cook's Voyage towards the South
Pole, it was no doubt pleasing news for the Home Secretary to
learn that any sanguine expectations could be formed of it,
seeing that Cook's description of its resources was not by any
means enthusiastic. He stayed there only during the day on which
he discovered it&#8212;the 10th October, 1774; and his remarks
about the flax-plant and the pine-trees contain no suggestions as
to their probable value for naval purposes. That idea seems to
have owed its origin to his description of the plant and the
trees in New Zealand. At Norfolk Island, he said&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We observed many trees and plants common at New
Zealand; and in particular the flax-plant, which is rather more
luxuriant here than in any part of that country; but the chief
produce is a sort of spruce pine, which grows in great abundance
and to a large size, many of the trees being as thick, breast
high, as two men could fathom, and exceedingly straight and tall.
This pine is of a sort between that which grows in New Zealand,
and that in New Caledonia; the foliage differing something from
both; and the wood not so heavy as the former, nor so light and
close grained as the latter. <a href="#note-330" name=
"noteref-330" id="noteref-330">{56}</a></blockquote>
<p>It will be seen, on reference to Matra's and Sir George
Young's proposals for the colonisation of New South Wales, that
English manufacturers had expressed their opinions strongly in
favour of the New Zealand flax as material for navy cordage,
canvas, and other purposes; and one of the arguments urged in
support of the proposals was that the plant might be cultivated,
and that the New Zealand timber might be obtained for masts and
ship-building. These points were also dwelt upon in the Heads of
a Plan. But nothing was said in those documents about the native
flax and timber of Norfolk Island. From Sir George Young's
petition for a grant of that island, it might be inferred that
the idea of occupying it with a view to those particular
industries originated with him&#8212;in other words, that he had
suggested the matter to the Government. It deserves to be noted
that, notwithstanding the importance attached to the products in
question, no proposal was made for the colonisation of New
Zealand, although Captain Cook had pointed out its advantages for
the purpose. <a href="#note-331" name="noteref-331" id=
"noteref-331">{57}</a></p>
<blockquote>As soon as the rains permitted the getting the
provisions on shore from the two remaining store-ships they were
cleared, except of the spirits, which are on board of one of
them, and which will be landed the end of this month. It was my
intention to send the two store-ships away together, and expected
they would be ready to sail the first week in October; and the
Sirius was ordered to be ready to sail about the same time to the
northward, in order to procure live stock; but it was now found
that very little of the English wheat had vegetated, and a very
considerable quantity of barley and many seeds had rotted in the
ground, having been heated in the passage, and some much injured
by the weevil; all the barley and wheat, likewise, which had been
put on board the Supply at the Cape, were destroyed by the weevil
The ground was therefore necessarily sown a second time with the
seed which I had saved for the next year, in case the crops in
the ground met with any accident The wheat sent to Norfolk Island
had likewise failed, and there did not remain seed to sow one
acre. I could not be certain that the ships which are expected
would bring any quantity of grain, or if put on board them, that
they would preserve it good by a proper attention to the stowage,
to the want of which I impute our present loss.<br>
<br>
The colony not being in a state to support any considerable
quantity of live stock, many being under the necessity at present
of frequently killing a part of what they have for want of food
to support them, I should be obliged to kill what the Sirius
might procure, and which could not be expected to exceed ten or
fourteen days' provision for the settlement. And we now have not
more than a year's bread in store, having been obliged to furnish
the Sirius and the Supply with provisions. On these
considerations, but more immediately from the fear of not having
grain to put into the ground next year, when we shall have a more
considerable quantity of ground to sow, I have thought it
necessary to order the Sirius to go to the Cape of Good Hope in
order to procure grain, and at the same time what quantity of
flour and provisions she can receive.<br>
<br>
Captain Hunter is likewise ordered to purchase what necessaries
the surgeon of the hospital demands for six months, no
necessaries of any kind, according to his letter which is
enclosed, having been sent out. Fifteen pipes of wine were
purchased at Rio de Janeiro, which were all that could be
procured, and I presume, as thirty pipes were ordered, the
remainder will be sent out by any ship that may stop at
Teneriffe. I have only ordered a sufficient quantity of
necessaries to be purchased for that time, as a demand has been
made in my first letter to your lordship. The cellar for a
receiving the spirits will be finished, and the Fishburn
store-ship cleared and ready to sail, by the time the Golden
Grove returns from Norfolk Island, when both ships shall be
immediately ordered to England.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will see by the returns the state of the garrison
and the provisions remaining in store. What the Sirius will bring
will be mostly flour, and that she may take on board as large a
quantity as possible, I have ordered some of her guns to be
landed. I presume that your lordship will see the necessity of
this colony having always a certain quantity of provisions in
store.<br>
<br>
As soon as the Sirius sails, I intend going up the harbour to the
ground pointed out in my former letters as more easily cultivated
than the lands round us, with a small detachment, consisting of
two lieutenants, one captain, and twenty-five non-commissioned
officers and privates, and forty or fifty convicts, who will be
employed in cultivating the ground. I purpose remaining with this
party until they are settled, and have no doubt, when settlers
come out and proper people to superintend the convicts that will
be employed for the Crown, but that two or three years will give
this country a very different aspect, and in the meantime the
clearing the ground near the settlement shall not be
neglected.<br>
<br>
The hutting the detachment has been going on under the direction
of the Major-Commandant. The officers have all separate houses,
and, except one or two, are now under cover. The barracks are
still in hand. There being some carpenters and sawyers in the
different companies, I ordered them to be employed as such; and
it being customary to pay the soldiers when so employed, and
Major Ross thinking they could not otherwise be set to work as
artificers, I have enclosed this report of such as have been
employed for your lordship's approbation.<br>
<br>
I have likewise the honor of enclosing your lordship his returns
of such officers as wish to be relieved at the expiration of the
three years for which they were sent out, and of those who are
desirous of remaining; as likewise copies of his letter and my
answer, respecting the encouragement offered by Government to
settlers.</blockquote>
<p>The list of officers and men who wished to be relieved at the
expiration of their term of three years shows that out of the
total number of one hundred and sixty privates there was only one
man who desired to remain as a settler; and only two
officers&#8212;Tench and Dawes&#8212;with one private, who would
remain as soldiers for another term of three years. <a href=
"#note-332" name="noteref-332" id="noteref-332">{58}</a> Three
officers, of whom one was Lieutenant George Johnston, were unable
to make up their minds on the matter; one serjeant and one
private were willing to stay as soldiers. Altogether, there were
only nine men in the detachment who had any thought of remaining
in the colony even for a few years. The rest, with Major Ross at
their head, were unanimous in their desire to leave. Evidently,
therefore, they had seen very little in the country to attract
them, or to create any desire to make their homes in it. But at
this time nothing had been officially settled with respect to
"the encouragement offered by Government to settlers"; nor was
the matter settled until the special Instructions on the subject,
signed at Whitehall on the 24th August, 1789, reached the colony.
In the absence of this information, there was no inducement to
the soldiers to offer themselves as settlers; a fact which may
possibly account for the state of the return sent in by Major
Ross. <a href="#note-333" name="noteref-333" id=
"noteref-333">{59}</a></p>
<blockquote>The barracks, officers' houses, hospital,
store-houses for the use of the detachment and for the public
stores, are buildings that will stand for some years, as they
will hereafter be walled up with brick or stone, if limestone can
be found in the country, or if sent out as ballast in the
transports.<br>
<br>
The detachment is now enclosing ground for their gardens, and we
have about six acres of wheat, eight of barley, and six acres of
other grain, all which, as well as such garden seeds as were not
spoiled, promised well; and though the soil is in general a light
sandy soil, it is, I believe, as good as what is commonly found
near the sea-coast in other parts of the world. The great
inconvenience we find is from the rocks and the labour of
clearing away the woods which surround us, and which are mostly
gum-trees of a very large size, and which are only useful as
firewood, though I think that when we can cut them down in the
winter and give them time to season, they may be made useful in
building. <a href="#note-334" name="noteref-334" id=
"noteref-334">{60}</a><br>
<br>
The fish begin to return with the warm weather, but I fear we
shall never be able to save any part of the provisions by the
quantity that will be taken.<br>
<br>
The rainy season is, I hope, nearly over, and though we have had
very heavy rains they have not been more frequent than was
expected, and were chiefly confined to a few days near the full
and change of the moon.<br>
<br>
The climate is equal to the finest in Europe, and we very seldom
have any fogs. All the plants and fruit-trees brought from the
Brazil and the Cape that did not die on the passage thrive
exceedingly well; and we do not want vegetables, good in their
kind, which are natural to the country. <a href="#note-335" name=
"noteref-335" id="noteref-335">{61}</a><br>
<br>
With respect to the sending to the islands for women, your
lordship will, I believe, think that in the present situation of
this colony it would be only bringing them to pine away a few
years in misery; and I am very sorry to say that those we have
are most of them very abandoned wretches; still, more women will
be necessary when more convicts are sent out.<br>
<br>
Stone houses that will not be in danger from fire will, if
possible, be erected in the course of the summer, as likewise a
place of worship; and if ships coming out bring limestone as
ballast these very necessary works will go on fast. At present we
are obliged to lay the bricks and stones in clay, and of course
to make the walls of an extraordinary thickness; and even then
they are not to be depended on.</blockquote>
<p>The building of a place of worship during the summer months
was one of the many improvements which Phillip had designed in
connection with the foundation of a town; but it was never
carried out, owing&#8212;as Collins says&#8212;to "the pressure
of other works". <a href="#note-336" name="noteref-336" id=
"noteref-336">{62}</a> It was not until July, 1793, that the
building of a place of worship was begun, and then it was at the
expense of the chaplain, the Rev. Richard Johnson. Although his
Majesty had instructed Phillip, by all proper methods, to enforce
a due observance of religion and good order among the inhabitants
of the new settlement, and to take such steps for the due
celebration of public worship as circumstances would permit,
<a href="#note-337" name="noteref-337" id="noteref-337">{63}</a>
nothing was done for the purpose of enabling him to carry out
this instruction beyond the appointment of a chaplain. It was
quite consistent with the character of the age that the interests
of religion were considered to be duly provided for, when a
chaplain had been appointed at ten shillings a day and his
rations. No provision was made for the necessary expenses
connected with religious services; still less for the erection of
a proper building.</p>
<blockquote>This country is supposed to have mines of iron and
tin, or silver, by those who have been used to work in mines; but
I give no encouragement to search after what, if found in our
present situation, would be the greatest evil that could befall
the settlement.<br>
<br>
A convict used to work in the Staffordshire lead mines says the
ground we are now clearing contains a large quantity of that
metal; and copper is supposed to lie under some rocks which have
been blown in sinking a cellar for the spirits. I have no doubt
but that the earth contains iron and other metals, and that mines
may hereafter be worked to great advantage. The red used by the
painters, and which they call Spanish brown, is found in great
abundance; and the white clay with which the natives paint
themselves is still in greater plenty, and which the Abb&#233;
that came out with Monsieur la P&#233;rouse as a naturalist told
me, if cleared of the sand (which may be done with little
trouble), would make good china. Specimens were sent to Sir
Joseph Banks, and a stone taken out of a slate quarry that I
thought contained some metal. <a href="#note-338" name=
"noteref-338" id="noteref-338">{64}</a></blockquote>
<p>Tench mentions that "previous to leaving England, I remember
to have frequently heard it asserted that "the discovery of mines
was one of the secondary objects of the Expedition." <a href=
"#note-339" name="noteref-339" id="noteref-339">{65}</a> There
was no foundation for that assertion; and it probably owed its
origin to nothing more than the vague association of ideas which
for centuries past had connected colonising enterprises with
mining experiments. The existence of metals and minerals in New
South Wales was assumed simply because the territory was known to
be extensive and fertile; but no indications of any such deposits
had ever been found on its coasts. "The great probability of
finding, in such an immense country, metals of every kind", was
urged by Sir George Young as a reason for its colonisation. But
as neither a geologist nor a mineralogist was appointed when the
Expedition was organised, it may be inferred that Lord Sydney did
not attach any value to the probability of such discoveries being
made. That the idea of finding valuable ores of some kind was
prevalent in the settlement may be seen in Phillip's reference to
the subject. Rumors were circulated from time to time about
mysterious mines which were said to exist in its neighborhood;
but he wisely set his face against any attempt to divert the
people from their proper occupations&#8212;public works and the
cultivation of the soil. At the same time he did not neglect any
opportunity for, ascertaining the riches of the earth. The
attention paid to the subject is shown in Tench's statement with
reference to the exploring expeditions to Broken Bay and
elsewhere. "On all these excursions we brought away, in small
bags, as many specimens of the soil of the country we had passed
through as could be conveniently carried; in order that, by
analysis, its qualities might be ascertained." <a href=
"#note-340" name="noteref-340" id="noteref-340">{66}</a> No signs
of gold were found on those occasions.</p>
<blockquote>Your lordship will, I hope, judge it expedient to
send out settlers to whom a certain number of convicts may be
given. They, my lord, will be interested in cultivating the
lands, and when a few carpenters and bricklayers are sent out who
will act as overseers, and have some little interest in the
labour of the convicts who are under their care, a great deal of
labour will be done by those who are employed in the public
works.<br>
<br>
I have in a former letter mentioned that a couple of decked
vessels of thirty or forty tons burthen, if sent out in frames,
and two or three good shipwrights, would be of great service.
<a href="#note-341" name="noteref-341" id=
"noteref-341">{67}</a><br>
<br>
The natives, though very friendly whenever they are met by two or
three people who are armed, still continue to attack any of the
convicts when they meet them in the woods, and two or three have
been lately wounded by them. I have been with a small party to
examine the land between the harbour and Broken Bay. We went as
far as Pittwater, and saw several of the natives, but none came
near us. There are several hundred acres of land free from
timber, and very proper for cultivation when a small settlement
can be made on the coast. On our return to the boats, near the
mouth of the harbour, we found about sixty of the natives, men,
women, and children, with whom we stayed some hours. They were
friendly, but, as I have ever found them, since they find we
intend to remain, they appeared best pleased when we were leaving
them, though I gave them many useful articles; and it is not
possible to say whether it was from fear or contempt that they do
not come amongst us. I have already had the honor of informing
your lordship of the little we know of these people. Most of the
women and all the females I saw had lost two joints from the
little finger of the left hand, and two women were scarred on the
shoulders like the men&#8212;the first I had seen. The women,
when we first came on the beach, were in their canoes fishing,
which is their constant employment, the men chiefly employing
themselves in making canoes, spears, fizgigs, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The day before we returned, the boat that was waiting for us near
the harbour's mouth saw about two hundred men, who were assembled
in two parties, and who after some time drew up opposite to each
other, and from each party men advanced singly and threw their
spears, guarding themselves at the same time with their shields.
I suppose this to have been no more than an exercise, for the
women belonging to both parties remained together on the beach,
though towards the end of the combat they are said to have run up
and down, uttering violent shrieks.<br>
<br>
As it had been supposed that many of the natives had left this
part of the coast on account of the great scarcity of fish, the
different parts of the harbour were examined in one day, and the
canoes counted; not more than sixty-seven canoes and one hundred
and thirty-three people were seen, but it was the season in which
they make their new canoes, and large parties were known to be in
the woods for that purpose. <a href="#note-342" name=
"noteref-342" id="noteref-342">{68}</a> I went a few days after
to examine the coast between this harbour and Botany Bay, in
which journey few of the natives were seen; but a young whale
being driven on the coast, all we met had large pieces, which
appeared to have been lain on the fire until the outside was
scorched, in which state they eat it. These people last summer
would neither eat shark nor stingaray; but the scarcity of fish
in the winter, I believe, obliges them to eat anything that
affords the smallest nourishment. They have two kinds of root
which they chew after roasting; one is the fern root. They eat
together, that is, in families, and seldom broil their fish (the
only way they ever dress it) for more than a few minutes.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to have been so long without knowing more of these
people, but I am unwilling to use any force, and hope this summer
to persuade a family to live with us, unless they attempt to burn
our crops, of which I am apprehensive, for they certainly are not
pleased with our remaining amongst them, as they see we deprive
them of fish, which is almost their only support; but if they set
fire to the corn, necessity will oblige me to drive them to
greater distance, though I can assure your lordship that I shall
never do it but with the greatest reluctance and from absolute
necessity.<br>
<br>
As there are paths which are much frequented between this harbour
and Broken Bay, I apprehend they frequently change their
situation, but have no reason to suppose they go to the northward
in the winter and return in the summer.<br>
<br>
The kangaroo is the only animal of any size that we have yet
seen, and they are frequently killed. They are of two sorts, one
seldom weighing more than sixty pounds; these live chiefly on the
high grounds. The hair is of a reddish cast, and the head shorter
than the large sort, some of which have been killed that weighed
one hundred and fifty pounds. Both are of the opossum kind, and
the young ones, several of which have been taken, grow very tame
in a few days, but none have ever lived more than two or three
weeks.<br>
<br>
I have now given up all hopes of recovering the two bulls and
four cows that were lost; and one sheep only remains of upwards
of seventy which I had purchased at the Cape on my own account
and on Government's account. It is the rank grass under the trees
which has destroyed them, for those who have only had one or two
sheep, which have fed about their tents, have preserved them.<br>
<br>
Hogs and poultry thrive and increase fast. Black cattle will
thrive full as well: and as we shall be able in future to guard
against their straying, your lordship will please to determine
whether it would not be necessary to order any ship that was
coming to the settlement with provisions, to purchase at the Cape
as many cows as could be conveniently received on board, with a
couple of young bulls. But the ship for that purpose should be
able to stow them between decks: and I beg leave to observe that
a forty or fifty gun ship that brought out provisions and stores,
leaving her guns out, would answer the purpose better than any
transport, and at once stock this settlement. Savu is at too
great a distance for the Sirius to be employed on that service to
any extent. <a href="#note-343" name="noteref-343" id=
"noteref-343">{69}</a><br>
<br>
Your lordship will, I hope, excuse so long a detail of matters
trifling in themselves, and which I should not have dwelt on but
that I wished the situation of the colony to be known as fully as
possible.</blockquote>
<p>A letter to Nepean, of the same date, was written to accompany
this despatch, for the purpose of reminding him of the pressing
wants of the settlement. The people at this time had neither
needles nor thread, and consequently could not mend their
clothes; no leather, nails, or cobblers'-wax to keep their shoes
together; no bedding to lie upon, for sheets and blankets had not
been thought of. Phillip ventured to suggest, probably because
they were still suffering from scurvy and other kinds of
sickness, that "some kind of bedding" was necessary for them, as
well as "some kind of covering" for the children. They, it seems,
had been kept on very short commons from the first, since the
good-hearted Governor had been obliged, "in several instances",
to order them half the man's allowance, or even
two-thirds&#8212;that being the woman's share. The ordinary
ration for a child was one-third of a man's; and as at this time
they were all fed on salt provisions&#8212; there being no such
luxuries as barley, sago, oatmeal, or any other children's food
in the stores, except rice&#8212;the little folks had uncommonly
hard times of it. The stock of cows having been lost early in
June, there was no milk and no fresh butter in the settlement;
the salt butter had disappeared, and was replaced by "the like
quantity of sugar", as Collins says (p. 81)&#8212;that is, six
ounces per week. Although the people were on full rations at this
time, there was nothing to eat but salt beef, salt pork, flour,
rice, and pease&#8212;with such vegetables as could be grown
about the huts, or gathered wild in the bush. Fish was
occasionally procured in the summer, and sometimes a bird or even
a kangaroo might be shot by those who had guns. For bread, there
was flour made into cakes, without milk or eggs. At a later
period, when vegetables were easily got, it was usual to boil the
flour with greens, instead of baking it into cakes. <a href=
"#note-344" name="noteref-344" id="noteref-344">{70}</a> The
daily meals did not include tea; there was nothing to drink but
water and the bad Portuguese rum taken on board at Rio for the
soldiers and their wives. How niggardly the allowance was may be
seen by comparing it with the scale on which convict servants
were fed in later years, when they had bread, tea, sugar, and
tobacco, <a href="#note-345" name="noteref-345" id=
"noteref-345">{71}</a> in addition to their meat.</p>
<blockquote>I have ordered the Sirius to the Cape for the reasons
assigned in my letter to Lord Sydney; all the seed wheat and most
of the other seeds brought from England having been spoiled, as
well as what wheat was put on board the Supply at the Cape.
Several acres sown with this wheat have been sown a second time
with the seed I procured for next year, in case of any accident
happening to what we have in the ground, and which has left us
without a bushel of seed in the settlement. Having only a year's
flour in store, Captain Hunter has orders to purchase as much as
the ship can stow, and I apprehend he will be able to bring six
months' supply for the settlement, as likewise what seed wheat,
&amp;c., we may want. The Sirius and Supply being victualled from
the stores lessens our provisions; and you will, I believe, see
the necessity of having always two years' provisions beforehand;
a store-ship may be lost a long time before it is known here or
in England.<br>
<br>
No kind of necessaries for the sick after landing was sent out. I
enclose the surgeon's letter, and what he has demanded for six
months I have ordered to be purchased, and apprehend necessaries
for the hospital will be sent out by the first ships. The
cloathes for the convicts are in general bad, and there is no
possibility of mending them for want of thread; it is the same
with the shoes, which do not last a month; these necessary
articles, to the amount of a few pounds, I have likewise ordered
to be purchased.<br>
<br>
A strong launch to remove provisions will soon be necessary, as
some convicts are going to cultivate land near the head of the
harbour, and to bring timber, for what we now use is brought
already from a considerable distance, and our roads after heavy
rains are bad.<br>
<br>
The tools and articles in the enclosed list will be much wanted
by the time they can be sent out, and I cannot help repeating
that most of the tools were as bad as ever were sent out for
barter on the coast of Guinea.<br>
<br>
The women have two-thirds of what is allowed the men, and the
children one-third. The children's allowance is, I think, too
little, and I have been obliged in several instances to order
children half the man's allowance, or two-thirds, as the women
are allowed.<br>
<br>
The wooden ware sent out were too small; they are called bowls
and platters, but are not larger than pint basins; there was not
one that would hold a quart.<br>
<br>
As the candles sent out will not last more than two years, I wish
to know if it is the intention of Government to furnish the
settlement with that article for any longer term.<br>
<br>
The requisites for mending the men and women's cloathes and
shoes, as well as some kind of bedding for them, are very
necessary; and some kind of covering will be wanted for the
children. This is not an expense that will be necessary to
continue after a number of settlers are in the colony, for then
the convicts will have some resources; at present they have
none.<br>
<br>
Amongst our many wants a few proper people to superintend the
convicts has been mentioned, and we are at present at a great
loss for the necessary people to attend the stores and see the
provisions issued. The convicts who are proper for this are those
who have had some little education, and they are the greatest
villains we have. In fact, here is no choice of persons of any
class, and I am obliged to continue such as we have in places for
which they prove themselves very unfit subjects.<br>
<br>
The knowing when the time expires for which the convicts have
been transported is very necessary, many of whom will desire to
return; and there are many that will be a burthen to Government,
and who I should be glad to send away. This I mentioned more
particularly in a former letter.<br>
<br>
The good behaviour and industry of two convicts have induced me
to request that their families be sent to them. The men are at
Norfolk Island, and which they do not wish to leave after the
time for which they have been transported expires. The names and
places of abode of these two families are enclosed.<br>
<br>
The Golden Grove is now ready to sail, with one midshipman, one
sergeant, one corporal, and five privates, twenty men and ten
women convicts; these will make the number on Norfolk Island
sixty, and I send eighteen months' provisions. The Fishburn will
be ready to sail by the time the Golden Grove returns, and both
ships shall sail immediately for England.</blockquote>
<p>Major Ross and his officers do not appear to have formed a
happy family by any means. He had placed five of them under
arrest in March, and in October he applied for a General
Court-martial to try another. On the first occasion it was found
that there was not a sufficient number of officers to form a
Court; and on the second a still more unexpected difficulty
presented itself. The Judge-Advocate raised an objection that
officers of marines, while on shore, could not form a
Court-martial under a warrant issued by the Governor, the force
being then subject to the provisions of an Act of Parliament
passed expressly for their regulation; and that they could only
sit under a warrant from the Lords of the Admiralty. As this
amounted to saying that no Court for the trial of commissioned
officers could be held in the colony, the matter was serious.
Phillip directed a Court of Enquiry to take evidence, but its
members held that they were precluded from doing so by the issue
of his warrant. The only expedient left was to direct the
Judge-Advocate to take evidence, and to send the depositions,
with the officer, to England; but at the last moment the knot was
cut by a letter from Major Ross, stating that the officer in
question had "fully satisfied" him, and therefore he did not
desire to press his application for a Court-martial. This matter
formed the subject of a despatch in which the position of affairs
was described with great moderation.</p>
<blockquote>I am very sorry to be under the very disagreeable
necessity of troubling your lordship with the following
particulars, but the very unpleasant situation of the detachment
doing duty in this country, from the discontents between the
Commandant and the officers, will, I presume, satisfy your
lordship of that necessity, as I am sorry to say it is not in my
power to restore that harmony which is so very requisite in our
situation.<br>
<br>
Having received a letter from Major Ross requesting a General
Court-martial on an officer for neglect of duty, contempt and
disrespect to him, I issued a warrant for assembling a General
Court-martial, but the thirteen senior officers when assembled
declared that they could not sit as members of a General
Court-martial under that warrant, being, as part of his Majesty's
forces, amenable only to the authority of the Commissioners for
executing the office of Lord High Admiral of Great Britain. The
warrant was issued under the authority of his Majesty's
Commission for assembling General Courts-martial, but they
declined sitting under the Act of Parliament made for the
army.<br>
<br>
Having assigned their reasons in writing to Major Ross (to whom
the warrant was directed), I have the honor to enclose your
lordship a copy. Though the letter from the Commanding Officer of
the detachment was very sufficient ground for ordering the
Court-martial if the officer could have been tried on the spot,
as it was now determined that there was no legal authority in
this country for ordering a General Court-martial on any part of
the Marine Corps, and the officer accused declared himself
innocent of of every part of the charge, I ordered a Court of
Enquiry to be assembled to enquire into the particulars of the
charge, and to report whether there was or was not sufficient
ground for a General Court-martial, intending, if the Court of
Enquiry reported that they found sufficient ground, to order a
Court of Enquiry to examine fully into the charge and to report
their opinion, which was the only means I had left of doing
justice to both parties, as no Court-martial could be held; for
though I knew that Courts of Enquiry always preceded
Courts-martial, yet in the present instance I was fully satisfied
that the warrant I had issued for holding the Court-martial was
totally done away by the officers having denied the legality of
it as far as it respected themselves, and consequently a Court of
Enquiry perfectly regular; and I had reason to suppose that both
parties would have consented to such a determination, no other
being possible under our present circumstances.<br>
<br>
The Court of Enquiry met, and I received the following answer,
signed by the President:&#8212;That had the business been
referred to them before the application for a Court-martial they
might then have proceeded with the consent of both parties, but
that at present they thought themselves precluded from making any
enquiry, and only reported that an application from a commanding
officer was always deemed a sufficient ground for a General
Court-martial, not deeming the warrant legal with respect to
themselves as being marine officers, and they now refused to make
any enquiry because that warrant had been issued.<br>
<br>
To order an officer to return to his duty under the same
commanding officer whom he was accused of treating with contempt
or disrespect, or to let him remain under arrest until he could
be tried in this country, might be attended with very
disagreeable circumstances; for of seventeen officers comprising
the detachment five have been put under arrest by their
commandant, and are only returned to duty by my order until a
sufficient number of officers to form a General Court-martial can
be assembled, as I have in a former letter had the honor of
informing your lordship.<br>
<br>
I therefore ordered the evidence on both sides to be taken by the
Judge-Advocate, and intended to send them home with the officer,
but before that could be done I received a letter from Major Ross
informing me that the officer had fully satisfied him respecting
the charge, and desiring that he might be permitted to withdraw
his request for a Court-martial. I therefore ordered the officer
to return to his duty. <a href="#note-346" name="noteref-346" id=
"noteref-346">{72}</a><br>
<br>
When the warrant was granted for assembling a General
Court-martial, I did not know that an Act of Parliament had been
passed for a limited time by which the marines serving in America
had been tried; nor did any officer in the detachment entertain a
doubt of the propriety of sitting under a warrant issued by the
authority of his Majesty's Commission until the evening before
the Court was to assemble, when the doubt arose on the
Judge-Advocate's reading over the oath.<br>
<br>
The present situation of the detachment will be obvious to your
lordship.</blockquote>
<p>The Judge-Advocate seems to have gone a little out of his way
on this occasion, in anticipating a technical objection which
might have been left to the parties concerned&#8212;especially as
the point was doubtful, to say the least, and the result
threatened to be serious. If no General Court-martial could be
held under the Governor's warrant, then there was no power to
deal with serious offences against military discipline; officers
and men might have run riot as much as they pleased, and the
Governor would have found himself powerless to deal with the
situation. It was the Judge-Advocate's duty, no doubt, to advise
the Court on all matters of law arising before it; but a question
of jurisdiction, such as was raised by him in this instance, does
not appear to have been properly within his province, or that of
the Court itself, to determine. The simplest course to have
pursued would have been to proceed with the trial, and then refer
the question to the proper authorities in England. By that means
military discipline would have been saved, without any sacrifice
of the rights of parties. But the subalterns who mainly composed
the Court may possibly have rejoiced in the opportunity of
extinguishing, by a summary decision, the only tribunal in the
colony to which they were amenable; as by that means they
effectually put it out of the Major's power to put them under
arrest, or even to hold a Court-martial <i>in terrorem</i> over
them. <a href="#note-347" name="noteref-347" id=
"noteref-347">{73}</a></p>
<p>Another despatch to Sydney, written on the 30th October, was
occupied principally with a recapitulation of matters so dealt
with on former occasions. The only event of any importance which
he had to communicate was the departure of the Sirius on her
voyage to the Cape.</p>
<blockquote>By his Majesty's ship Sirius I had the honor of
informing your lordship of my reasons for sending that ship to
the Cape of Good Hope: The loss of all the seed-wheat and the
greatest part of the other grains and seeds brought from England,
which had been heated in the long passage, and very little of
which, when sown, ever vegetated. All the seed-wheat put on board
the Supply at the Cape of Good Hope had likewise been destroyed
by the weevil; and after sowing the ground a second time with
what seed had been brought from Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of
Good Hope, there did not remain sufficient to sow a single acre;
and the crops in the ground are exposed to various accidents in
our present situation.<br>
<br>
The Sirius sailed the 2nd instant to go round the South Cape, and
Captain Hunter has directions to purchase for the use of the
garrison what flour the ship can receive, after having compleated
his own provisions. The quantity will not be very
considerable&#8212;at present we have eighteen months' bread in
store. Necessaries for the hospital were likewise ordered to be
purchased, none of any kind being sent out either for the
detachment or convicts.<br>
<br>
Your lordship will see by my former letters the little progress
we have been able to make in cultivating the lands, and, I
presume, the necessity of a few proper persons being sent out to
superintend the convicts, as well as settlers who have been used
to cultivation, for at present this settlement only affords one
person <a href="#note-348" name="noteref-348" id=
"noteref-348">{74}</a> that I can employ in cultivating the lands
on the public account. Most of the officers have cultivated a
little ground, but it is merely for their own conveniency, and
none more than a single acre except the Lieutenant-Governor, who
has about three acres. I have sixteen, at a small farm on the
public account.<br>
<br>
It must, my lord, be settlers, with the assistance of the
convicts, that will put this country in a situation for
supporting its inhabitants. Nothing but the uncertainty of the
time in which my letters may reach England, and the possibility
of those last written being the first received, would make me
trouble your lordship in this letter with a repetition of what I
have fully explained in my former letters: That people who are
not convicts are necessary for the stores, from which provisions
or stores are delivering almost hourly; and that we want for
superintending the convicts such as have been brought up in the
line in which they are to be employed.<br>
<br>
If the ships that bring out provisions were such as could receive
on board black cattle at the Cape of Good Hope, I think we shall
in future be able to preserve them; and a ship to remain here as
a store-ship would be attended with many advantages. It is still
a doubt whether the cattle we lost have been killed by the
natives, or if they have strayed into the country; I fear the
former, and am sorry to say that the natives now attack any
straggler they meet unarmed; and though the strictest orders have
been given to keep the convicts within bounds, neither the fear
of death or punishment prevents their going out in the night, and
one has been killed since the Sirius sailed. The natives, who
appear strictly honest amongst themselves, leave their fizgigs,
spears, &amp;c., on the beach or in their huts when they go
a-fishing. These articles have been taken from them by the
convicts, and the people belonging to the transports buy them at
the risk of being prosecuted as receivers of stolen goods, if
discovered. The natives, as I have observed, revenge themselves
on any they meet unarmed. It is not possible to punish them
without punishing the innocent with the guilty, and our own
people have been the aggressors.<br>
<br>
The natives still refuse to come amongst us, and those who are
supposed to have murdered several of the convicts have removed
from Botany Bay, where they have always been more troublesome
than in any other part. I now doubt whether it will be possible
to get any of these people to remain with us, in order to get
their language, without using force. They see no advantage that
can arise from us that may make amends for the loss of that part
of the harbour in which we occasionally employ the boats in
fishing.<br>
<br>
If my former letters have reached your lordship the situation of
this settlement is known; and as most of the officers have
declined any kind of interference with the convicts, except when
immediately employed by themselves, the little progress made in
clearing land that requires so much labour will be accounted for.
A letter sent from the Admiralty to the Commanding Officers of
Marines at Portsmouth and Plymouth is what the officers say they
govern themselves by, and in which they say no extra duty is
pointed out. What I asked of officers were so very little, and so
far from being what would degrade either the officer or the
gentleman in our situation, that I beg leave to repeat once more
to your lordship the request I made soon after we landed, and
which was made in the following words:&#8212;"That officers
would, when they saw the convicts diligent, say a few words of
encouragement to them; and that when they saw them idle, or met
them straggling in the woods, they would threaten them with
punishment." This I only desired when officers could do it
without going out of their way; it was all I asked, and was
pointedly refused. They declared against what they called an
interference with convicts, and I found myself obliged to give up
the little plan I had formed in the passage for the government of
these people, and which, had even that been proposed to the
officers, required no more from them than the hearing any appeal
the overseer might find it necessary to make, and a report from
the officer to me, or to the Judge-Advocate, if he thought it
necessary, but which never has been asked of the officers, as
they declined any kind of interference.<br>
<br>
The Golden Grove store-ship sailed for Norfolk Island the 2nd of
October with provisions and some stores, and carried a
midshipman, two seamen, a sergeant, corporal, and five privates,
with twenty-one men and eleven women convicts. Their numbers will
be increased in the course of the summer. The Fishburn is now
fitting for sea, that she may sail with the Golden Grove, as soon
as that ship returns from Norfolk Island.<br>
<br>
The same reason which makes me trouble your lordship with tedious
extracts from my former letters makes it necessary to point out
in this letter that we at present depend entirely for provisions
being sent from England; and I beg leave to observe that if a
ship should be lost in the passage it might be a very
considerable time before it could be known in England. The
Sirius, from the length of the voyage, would not be able to
supply this settlement from the Cape; and though the islands may
furnish refreshments in great abundance to one or two ships, if
the Sirius was employed between the islands and this settlement
the quantity procured would be but small for so great a number of
people. But, my lord, I hope a very few years will put this
country in a situation to support itself, for I have the pleasure
of seeing what land has been cleared in a very flourishing
state.<br>
<br>
I am now preparing to go up the harbour with a small detachment
of one captain, four lieutenants, and twenty privates, who are to
protect some convicts intended to clear land near the head of the
harbour, where it is a fine open country, having very little
timber, and being perfectly free from underwood.</blockquote>
<p>It was on the 2nd of November that Phillip went up the
Parramatta River&#8212;"the head of the harbour", as he called
it&#8212;for the purpose of forming an agricultural settlement on
its banks. He selected a piece of rising ground, which, from its
shape, suggested the idea of a Crescent, and was so named by him,
as a site for his residence; and there he built a cottage which,
in after years, gave way to a substantial country house, intended
as a residence for the Governor. <a href="#note-349" name=
"noteref-349" id="noteref-349">{75}</a> The settlement was named
Rose Hill, and soon began to realise the expectations which its
founder had formed of it; so much so indeed that it gradually
came to be regarded as the most important place in the colony.
Three years after its formation, it had reduced Sydney to the
position of a mere official centre. Writing in December, 1791,
Tench said that Sydney "had long been considered as only a
dep&#244;t for stores; it exhibited nothing but a few old
scattered huts and some sterile gardens; cultivation of the
ground was abandoned, and all our strength transferred to Rose
Hill. <a href="#note-350" name="noteref-350" id=
"noteref-350">{76}</a></p>
<p>The Fishburn and the Golden Grove&#8212;the last remaining
vessels of the Fleet&#8212;were now ready for sea; and as they
furnished the only opportunity for sending letters to England
which would be available for many months, Phillip gathered
together the few remaining items of intelligence which he had to
communicate to Sydney. The only news he had to send related to
the return of the Golden Grove from Norfolk Island with letters
from the Commandant, and the formation of the settlement at Rose
Hill.</p>
<blockquote>Since I closed my letter of the 30th of October to
your lordship the Golden Grove has arrived from Norfolk Island,
where the people and provisions were landed, and from whence I
have received the most favourable accounts. They have vegetables
in great abundance, as well as fish. The grain that had been
sowed after the first had failed (from having been heated in the
passage or injured by the weevil) promises a great increase. The
soil is extremely rich, and to the depth of many feet wherever
they have dug; the people very healthy and perfectly satisfied
under an officer who will in less than two years render that
island independent of this colony for the necessaries of life, if
we can procure black cattle to send him. He will have an
additional number of people in the course of the summer. A few
honest industrious families would there find themselves happy, in
a good climate as healthy as this settlement (and no place can be
healthier), with a rich land easy of cultivation, and where the
storms of thunder and heavy rains have not been felt The flax
plant will supply the settlers on that island with rope and
canvas, as well as a considerable part of their cloathing, when
they can dress it properly; but a person experienced in dressing
flax is much wanted, as well as a few good husbandmen, for those
we have been able to send there are not only in general idle and
abandoned, but ignorant.<br>
<br>
A cocoanut that was as good as if just taken from the tree, and a
small piece of wood, said to resemble the handle of a fly-flap as
made in the Friendly Islands, and which did not appear to have
been long in the water, have suggested an idea that some island
which is inhabited lays at no great distance, but which my
present situation does not permit me to determine. The remains of
two or three canoes have been found on the rocks.<br>
<br>
The Golden Grove in her passage from Norfolk Island saw a very
dangerous reef, the south end of which lay in the latitude of
29&#176; 25' south, longitude 159&#176; 59' east. It appeared
from the N.E. by N. to N. when they were four leagues from it,
but no judgement can be formed how far it extends to the
northward. <a href="#note-351" name="noteref-351" id=
"noteref-351">{77}</a><br>
<br>
I had the honor of informing your lordship of my intentions of
fixing a settlement near the head of the harbour; and I have
lately passed several days in examining the country. The land is
good, though there is none we can take possession of at present
which can be cultivated without clearing the ground of the
timber, for if the trees are at the distance of thirty or even
fifty feet the roots spread; the labour there, nevertheless, will
not exceed the fourth part of what is required in our present
situation. The land appears to be the best I have seen in this
country, and as far as I could examine, which was for a couple of
miles round the spot on which I have fixed, I think the country
as fine as any I have seen in England. I had an officer and ten
men with me, which I left to finish a small redoubt; and in a few
days the remainder of the detachment will be sent up with some
convicts.<br>
<br>
A soldier has been lately missing, who I suppose lost his way in
the woods, and has either been killed by the natives or died by a
fit, to which he was subject.<br>
<br>
Except the old and those who brought inculpable complaints with
them, the people are very healthy; the weather is now settled,
and the two store-ships are ready to sail, and intend going round
the South Cape.<br>
<br>
A small quantity of flax, as I received it from Norfolk Island,
is enclosed with the despatches. A plant that produces pepper
(supposed to be the same as the East India pepper) is found in
great plenty in Norfolk Island. Several roots of this plant and
some of the pepper are sent to Sir Joseph Banks, who I have
requested to inform your lordship or Mr. Nepean if it proves to
be, as supposed, the black pepper used in England.<br>
<br>
In sinking a well the sand was supposed to contain a very large
proportion of metal, a small quantity of which is sent by the two
ships. It has been twenty-four hours in a strong fire, but we
could not get it to melt. I suppose it to be blacklead. <a href=
"#note-352" name="noteref-352" id=
"noteref-352">{78}</a></blockquote>
<p>This letter closed Phillip's official correspondence for the
year. When the ships that carried his despatches had cleared the
Heads, there was nothing left in the harbour to remind him of the
Fleet he had brought out, except the little brig Supply; nor did
any ship from the old country enter the port until the Lady
Juliana arrived in June, 1790. The interval was a weary one for
men whose associations were wholly with the country they had left
behind them, and who had not yet learned to look upon a home in
the new world as a compensation for their loss. But,
nevertheless, as the year drew to its close, there was more than
one event on which Phillip could look back with satisfaction. He
had brought out the Fleet in safety and with more success than
could have been expected; he had founded his colony on the shores
of the finest harbour in the world; he had established peaceful
relations with the native inhabitants of the country, even if he
had not reconciled them to the prospect of being dispossessed of
their hunting-grounds. The most serious difficulty he had to
contend with was the want of good land for farming purposes; but
that difficulty had at last been disposed of by the settlements
at Rose Hill and Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>The scarcity of such land in the immediate neighbourhood of
the Camp seemed at first a heavy drawback, if not a great
calamity; but probably time and experience led him to see the
great moral advantages which indirectly resulted from it. When
the settlements at those places had been formed, they enabled him
to draft off large numbers of the people who otherwise would have
been massed together at head-quarters; by that means preventing
the evils which would inevitably have resulted from an
overcrowded Camp, in which sickness was always prevalent so long
as the population was fed almost exclusively on salt provisions.
The establishment at Norfolk Island was doubly useful; for not
only did the land yield a rich return for the labour bestowed
upon it, and thus support a comparatively large number of people,
but it afforded Phillip a means of carrying out his favorite
theory of punishment in serious cases&#8212;exile from the
colony.</p>
<p>Looking at the rich and beautiful country on the western
shores of Botany Bay, as it appears in the present day, it is not
easy at first sight to understand the difficulty experienced by
Phillip in finding a sufficient area of land, fit for
cultivation, in the neighbourhood of the settlement. The country
round about it had been carefully explored in all directions for
that purpose, but it was condemned as useless, except in small
patches here and there; the soil being everywhere described as
either covered with rocks and trees, or else as a poor sandy
heath, full of swamps. Until the land at the head of the
Parramatta River was discovered, the prospect of obtaining any
substantial assistance from the soil appeared to be uncertain in
the extreme. The opinion thus formed with respect to the country
can only be understood when we recollect the difficulty
experienced in penetrating it where it happened to be covered
with timber. The land at Rose Hill was discovered easily because
there happened to be a ready means of communication by water, and
the country in that direction was tolerably open. But there was
even better land to be found at a much shorter distance from
Sydney Cove, which, could it have been turned to account, would
have removed all difficulty on the subject at once. Between
Cook's River and the Cove&#8212;a distance of less than five
miles in a straight line&#8212;there was land enough to supply
the settlement with vegetables and fruit, if not grain, in
abundance; while beyond the river, in the midst of a charming
landscape, lay a fine agricultural district, in which many
hundreds of settlers might have made their homes.</p>
<p>How then was it that, while so many efforts were made for the
purpose of finding such land, the natural wealth of the soil in
the immediate neighbourhood of the Cove remained unknown? Phillip
went up Cook's River in December, and he could not but have
noticed the level country on its banks, covered as it was with
very different timber from the gum-trees at the Cove, and richly
suggestive, even then, of the meadows he had read of in Cook's
Voyage. The scene which presented itself to him as he followed
the windings of the stream, might be compared with that which met
the eyes of the Saxons when they first rowed their galleys up the
Thames. The traveller who now-a-days crosses the river in a
railway train looks out upon a country to which he might be
excused for applying Darwin's lines&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">Embellished villas crown the landscape scene,<br>
Farms wave with gold and orchards blush between.</p>
<p>If the poet's description is not literally true in the present
day, it is at least sufficiently so to justify the glowing
language in which he sought to represent the future of Sydney
Cove. When he wrote, the land lay there in its native state,
waiting only to be cleared, drained, and cultivated in order to
realise the golden farms and blushing orchards of his
imagination. But there lay the difficulty. The labour of clearing
the ground round the Camp had formed the subject of constant
complaint during the first year of Phillip's administration; and
while it formed so serious a stumbling block in his path, it is
not surprising that no attempt was made to penetrate further
inland for the purpose of clearing and cultivating the backwoods.
The natural difficulties surrounding the cultivation of the soil
in a new country were never, perhaps, encountered in such force
as they were in his time, peculiarly aggravated as they were by
the fact that his farm labourers were men who had never handled a
spade or followed a plough's tail. <a href="#note-353" name=
"noteref-353" id="noteref-353">{79}</a></p>
<p>To realise his position in this matter, it is only necessary
to look for a moment at the people placed under his charge. If an
expedition were fitted out in the present day for the occupation
of unknown country, no man would be permitted to join it who was
not in some way fitted for the work to be done. The men sent out
in the First Fleet could hardly have been less adapted for the
purpose than they were. Many were old and suffering from disease;
and even among the able-bodied, there were none who had ever seen
a pick-axe or a shovel, except in a shop window. They had been
hurried out of their gaols without any other object in view than
that of getting rid of the most useless occupants of the cells.
Had Phillip taken the precaution to inquire into their
capabilities for work before he sailed, he would at least have
been prepared for the painful experience that awaited him when
his struggle began. But it never occurred to him to make any
inquiry on that point. He relied on the Government to provide him
with the proper men for the service; and he remained in happy
ignorance of the facts until they slowly made themselves known to
him. It would not be easy to find a parallel in the history of
colonisation for such a scene as that which presented itself when
the marines and convicts were drawn up on their first parade. Not
a man among them was in the least degree qualified to act the
part of a colonist. The soldiers would do nothing but their
military duty; the convicts would do nothing that they were not
compelled to do. By what miracle, one is inclined to ask, did
they escape starvation?<br>

Surgeon White also reported the speech briefly:&#8212;"After this
was done, the troops under arms fired three volleys; when his
excellency thanked the soldiers for their steady and good
conduct; which Major Ross caused to be inserted in the general
order-book. The Governor then addressed the convicts in a short
speech, extremely well adapted to the people he had to govern,
and who were then before him. Among many circumstances that would
tend to their future happiness and comfort, he recommended
marriage; assuring them that an indiscriminate and illegal
intercourse would be punished with the greatest severity and
rigour. Honesty, obedience, and industry, he told them, would
make their situation comfortable; whereas a contrary line of
conduct would subject them to ignominy, severity, and
punishment."&#8212;Journal, p. 124.<br>
<br>
Tench condensed his account of it into a few lines:&#8212;"When
the Judge-Advocate had finished reading, his excellency addressed
himself to the convicts in a pointed and judicious speech,
informing them of his future intentions, which were, invariably
to cherish and render happy those who showed a disposition to
amendment; and to let the rigour of the law take its course
against such as might dare to transgress the bounds
prescribed."&#8212;Narrative, p. 66.<br>
<br>
The "Speech of Phillip" in Flanagan's History of New South Wales,
pp. 30-34, is clearly fictitious. We have only to compare it with
the reports written by the witnesses in whose hearing it was
delivered, and who afterwards wrote their independent accounts of
it in their journals, to see that the speech attributed to
Phillip by Flanagan is an effort of the imagination. A similar
production, attributed to Captain Cook, which appears in pp.

evidence on the point, the use of the word Australia in the
Phillip speech is enough to show that it was not written in 1788.

Patrick Jennings, then Premier, when moving certain resolutions

48. According to Hunter, it was Phillip's intention to steer for
Broken Bay in the first instance. "In this examination, a large
opening, or bay, about three leagues and a half to the northward
of Cape Banks, was the first place we looked into: it had an
unpromising appearance on entering between the outer heads or
capes that form its entrance, which are high, rugged, and
perpendicular cliffs; but we had not gone far in before we
discovered a large branch extending to the southward; into this
we went, and soon found ourselves perfectly land-locked, with a
good depth of water. We proceeded up for two days, examining
every cove or other place which we found capable of receiving
ships; the country was also particularly noticed, and found
greatly superior in every respect to that round Botany Bay. The
Governor, being satisfied with the eligibility of this situation,
determined to fix his residence here, and returned immediately to
the ships."&#8212;p. 135 n.</p>

"The women are, besides, early subjected to an uncommon

and is done with a hair or some other slight ligature. This being
tied around at the joint the flesh soon swells and in a few

finger was taken off from the right hand, and that was occasioned
by the mistake of the mother. Before we knew them we took it to
be their marriage ceremony, but on seeing their mutilated

the flesh grows up between the sides of the wounds, and after a

instances where these scars have been cut to resemble the feet of
animals; and such boys as underwent the operation while they
lived with us, appeared to be proud of the ornament, and to
despise the pain which they must have endured. The operation is
performed when they are young, and until they advance in years

April, 1788, relates that they met with "various figures cut on
the smooth surface of some large stones. They consisted chiefly
of representations of themselves (the natives) in different
attitudes, of their canoes, of several sorts of fish and animals;
and considering the rudeness of the instruments with which the
figures must have been executed, they seem to exhibit tolerably
strong likenesses."&#8212;Journal, p. 141. Collins makes no

killed and eat them, without some sign of

Under the Articles of War existing before the Army Act,
Provost-Marshals possessed the power of punishing those whom they
detected in the actual commission of crime, the punishment being
limited by the necessity of the case and the orders received by
them from the Commander of the forces in the field. This power
was frequently exercised. The Duke of Wellington wrote of
it:&#8212;"By the custom of British armies, the Provost has been
in the habit of punishing on the spot, even with death, under the
orders of the Commander-in-Chief, soldiers found in the act of
disobedience of orders, of plunder, or of outrage." And he
declared that he did not know "in what manner the army was to be
commanded at all, unless the practice was not only continued, but
an additional number of Provosts appointed." The power of the
Provost-Marshal to punish "on his own authority" is not only not
allowed in the present day, but is expressly forbidden by the
Army Act.&#8212;Tovey, Martial Law, p. 54.</p>

hospital was brought out in frame in the Justinian, which arrived

The spelling of the word kangaroo appears to have been an open
question at this time. Phillip usually spelt it in its present
form. Captain Cook, who introduced it to the English language,
said:&#8212;"This animal is called by the natives
kangaroo."&#8212;Hawkesworth, vol. iii, p. 678. The word is so
spelled in Phillip's Voyage in the text, but in the illustration
it appears as "kangooroo". Collins, who paid some attention to
the native language, spells the word kangooroo in his list of
native names; p. 614. Tench states that the word was unknown to
the natives about the settlement:&#8212;"Kanguroo was a name
unknown to them for any animal, until we introduced it. When I
showed Colbee [a native] the cows brought out in the Gorgon, he
asked me if they were kanguroos?"&#8212;Complete Account, p.
171." This statement seems to be confirmed by the list of native
names for animals given by Collins. It does not mention the
kangaroo as a name in use among the natives at Port Jackson, but
specifies the two kinds known to them&#8212;the patagorang, a
large grey one, and the baggary, a small red one. He states (p.
609) that "the dialect spoken by the natives at Sydney differs
entirely from that left us by Captain Cook of the people with
whom he had intercourse to the northward, about Endeavour
River."</p>

"If the settling of this country should ever be thought an object
worthy the attention of Great Britain, the best place for
establishing a colony would be either on the banks of the Thames
or in the country bordering upon the Bay of Islands. In either
place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbour; and
by means of the river, settlements might be extended and a
communication established with the inland parts of the country.
Vessels might be built of the fine timber which abounds in these
parts, at very little trouble and expence, fit for such a
navigation as would answer the purpose."&#8212;Hawkesworth, vol.

As the cultivation of the New Zealand flax-plant continued to be
an object of importance with the Government for some years, and
the description of it in Cook's Voyage was the means of directing
attention to it in the first instance, it is worth while to quote
the passage:&#8212;"There is, however, a plant that serves the
inhabitants instead of hemp and flax, which excels all that are
put to the same purpose in other countries. Of this plant there
are two sorts. The leaves of both resemble those of flags, but
the flowers are smaller and their clusters more numerous; in one
kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves
of these plants, with very little preparation, they make all
their common apparel; and of these they make also their strings,
lines and cordage for every purpose, which are so much stronger
than anything we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a
comparison. From the same plant, by another preparation, they
draw long slender fibres which shine like silk, and are as white
as snow. Of these, which are also surprisingly strong, the finer
clothes are made; and of the leaves, without any other
preparation than splitting them into proper breadths and tying
the strips together, they make their fishing-nets, some of which,
as I have before remarked, are of an enormous size."&#8212;Ib.,

Some idea of the size of the gum-trees which surrounded the
settlement at the time may be gathered from Surgeon White's
statement, that he had known twelve men employed for five days in
grubbing up one tree.&#8212;Journal, p. 158. Another illustration
may be found in the first edition of Dr. Lang's Historical
Account of New South Wales, 1834, vol. i, p. 30:&#8212;"On the
summit of the ridge on which the Scots' Church was erected, in
the year 1824, a large blue-gum tree of about six feet in
diameter had been cut down about thirty-five years before; but
the stump, which had been left standing in the ground, was still
to all appearances as fresh, and the root as firmly fixed in the
soil, as if it had been cut down only a few days previous. It was
found necessary to remove the stump, as it interfered with the
line of the foundation of the proposed building, and for this
purpose a pile of wood and turf was heaped over it and set fire
to; but it took about ten days or a fortnight to burn out the old
root."</p>

Among the wild vegetables referred to. Surgeon White mentions "a
plant growing on the sea-shore, greatly resembling sage;
samphire, and a kind of wild spinage, besides a small shrub which
we distinguish by the name of the vegetable-tree, and the leaves
of which prove rather a pleasant substitute for vegetables." The
sweet tea plant he describes as "a creeping kind of vine, running
along the ground; the taste is sweet, exactly like the
liquorice-root of the shops." It was largely used as a substitute
for tea, and also for medical purposes.&#8212;Journal, pp. 195-6;

In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1790,
vol. xvi, p. 667, there is a learned dissertation by Josiah
Wedgwood&#8212;"on the analysis of a mineral substance from New
South Wales;" and in a footnote it is mentioned that "along with
the mineral here analysed, Mr. Wedgwood was presented by Sir
Joseph Banks with some clay, which Mr. Wedgwood found to be an
excellent material for pottery, adding that it might certainly
become the basis of a valuable manufacture for our infant colony
there." Mr. Wedgwood's analysis of the mineral substance referred
to in Phillip's despatch of 6 November, post, p. 356, showed that
it was "a mixture of fine white sand, a soft white earth, some
colourless micaceous particles, and a few black ones, resembling
black mica or blacklead"; and the result of his experiments was
that, in his opinion, "this substance is a pure species of
plumbago or blacklead, not taken notice of by any writer." The
clay analysed by Mr. Wedgwood was made into a medallion; ante, p.

One of Phillip's first requests after his appointment was for a

Admiralty, dated 27th October, 1786, he specified the dimensions
of the boat he wanted as follows:&#8212;"Thirty-two feet keel,
breadth in proportion, about eight feet ten inches, to row
sixteen oars, double bank'd sliding Gunter masts of a good depth,
and with high wash-boards." Such a boat would have proved useful,

The description of the country on the western shore of Botany
Bay, given by P&#233;ron, who visited it in 1802, will give some
idea of its appearance in Phillip's time:&#8212;A mesure qu'on se
rapproche de Botany Bay, le terrain s'abaisse de plus en plus, et
bient&#244;t on arrive &#224; des marecages dangereux, formes et
entretenus par les eaux saum&#226;tres de la rivi&#232;re de Cook
vers le Nord, et de la rivi&#232;re George vers le Sud. Ces
marais sont tellement &#233;tendus et quelquefois si profonds,
qu'il est impossible, en diff&#233;rens endroits, de les franchir
pour arriver jusqu'&#224; la mer. Sur leurs bords, et tout le
long des deux rivi&#232;res dont je viens de parler, la
v&#233;g&#233;tation est tr&#232;s-active; mille especes d'arbres
et d'arbustes, press&#233;es &#224; la surface du sol, donnent a
cette partie de la contr&#233;e qui nous occupe un aspect
enchanteur, et lui pretent une apparence de f&#233;condit&#233;
si grande, que le capitaine Cook et ses illustres compagnons y
furent tromp&#233;s eux-memes. II s'en faut pourtant beaucoup que
cette baie tant c&#233;l&#233;br&#233;e par ces navigateurs, ait

<h3>2.2 FIRST NEWS FROM BOTANY BAY. <small>[1789]</small></h3>
<br>
<small>THE</small> despatches written by Phillip in May did not
reach England until the month of March following; the exact date
being the 25th of that month, according to a memo, in the
handwriting of Sir Joseph Banks preserved among his
papers&#8212;"First News from Botany Bay, March 25, 1789." The
fact that he recorded the date is suggestive of the keen interest
he felt in the progress of the colony; and it is no great stretch
of imagination to suppose that when he read the pressing appeals
for assistance contained in the despatches, he lost no time in
urging Sydney to respond to them by the immediate despatch of a
store-ship. Perhaps it came upon him as a painful surprise when
he found that no ship had yet been sent out in accordance with
the original understanding. If faith was to be kept with Phillip,
there was no time to lose in sending out the supplies he needed,
six months being then the shortest time in which a ship could be
expected to do the voyage. If Sir Joseph had known the degree of
negligence displayed in the equipment of the Expedition, it would
have prepared him for the indifference to its fate manifested in
the long delay in sending out relief.
<p>Sydney did not feel sufficient interest in the fortunes of the
colonists to show any foresight or sagacity in providing for
contingencies. It was not at all an improbable
supposition&#8212;as Phillip pointed out&#8212;that the three
store-ships in the First Fleet might have been separated from the
other vessels and lost on the voyage out. Had such an event
happened, the Commodore would have been compelled to choose
between taking the rest of the Fleet back to England, or
proceeding with the foundation of his colony at the risk of being
starved out&#8212;a risk which would have been very soon
converted into a certainty. The thought of such a possibility
either did not occur to the Home Secretary, or was dismissed as
too improbable to be seriously considered. He appears indeed to
have forgotten the colony altogether during the year 1788. There
is no record of any step having been taken for the purpose of
guarding against accident in any shape, or even providing for
such a contingency as the exhaustion of the stores and provisions
in the settlement before fresh supplies could reach it. It was
assumed that all the estimates and calculations on which the
Expedition had been organised would be realised to the letter;
that the ships would arrive safely at their destination, that the
earth would yield forth its fruits in abundance, that "the
Settlement would be amply supplied with vegetable productions,
and most likely with fish", and consequently that "fresh
provisions, excepting for the sick and the convalescents, might
in a great degree be dispensed with." <a href="#note-354" name=
"noteref-354" id="noteref-354">{1}</a></p>
<p>To whatever combination of circumstances it may be
attributed&#8212;as, for instance, the intense excitement in
political circles caused by the impeachment of Warren Hastings,
the proceedings connected with the King's illness, and the
agitation for the abolition of the African slave trade, added to
the pressure of official business&#8212;it is evident that Sydney
found no time to spare during the year 1788 for considering the
affairs of the colony. The noble lord sat in the House of Peers,
and in the course of that year performed his share of judicial
duty in the celebrated cause which made the House the great
spectacle of the day. In addition to that unusual task, he is
reported in the Parliamentary History as having delivered seven
speeches during the debates on seven different occasions, each
speech being equally short and unimportant. His lordship did not
take a very prominent part in politics of any kind; but so far as
the affairs of the colony are concerned, he seems to have been
curiously indifferent on the subject. No communication was
addressed to Phillip from the Home Office during 1788, because
none had been received from him; but although his despatches,
written in May and July, were received and read by Sydney, he did
not send a line in reply.</p>
<p>If, however, he suffered no anxiety about the fate of the
settlement with which his name has since been so closely
identified, there is reason to believe that the publication of
Phillip's first despatches in the newspapers of the day gave rise
to considerable speculation in the public mind. <a href=
"#note-355" name="noteref-355" id="noteref-355">{2}</a> The
interest excited by the official documents was sustained by the
publication of Captain Tench's little book&#8212;the Narrative of
the Expedition,&#8212;which appeared in April, and was so eagerly
read that it passed through three editions before the end of the
year. It was widely read on the Continent also, judging from the
fact that translations were published in the Dutch, French, and
Swedish languages. On the 1st of May appeared the official volume
entitled The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay, with an
account of the Establishment of the Colonies of Port Jackson and
Norfolk Island. That also passed quickly through several
editions, and was translated into French and German soon after
its appearance in London. The impression made upon the reading
public by these publications was undoubtedly wide and deep,
notwithstanding the tendency in many quarters to sneer at the
colony on account of the settlers selected by the Government.
<a href="#note-356" name="noteref-356" id="noteref-356">{3}</a>
Some indication of the general feeling on the subject may be
found in a letter addressed by a person named Raleigh to Nepean,
dated from Edinburgh, May 23, 1789, which the writer began by
saying&#8212;"It is much to the credit of those in office that an
empire has been founded in the South, which time will render much
superior to that which their predecessors have lost in the West."
Mr. Raleigh&#8212;apparently a country gentleman&#8212;had read
Phillip's description of the country with some attention, and the
object of his communication was to furnish the Government with
his ideas as to the best means of cropping the land, rearing
stock, and protecting the settlement against "the ferocious
incursions of the natives". In one respect, at least, his advice
was sound:&#8212;"Strict orders should be given not to attempt
carrying any women to Botany Bay from the islands in the South
Seas; it would inevitably be attended with the most pernicious
consequences." <a href="#note-357" name="noteref-357" id=
"noteref-357">{4}</a></p>
<p>The result of the Ministerial deliberations on the questions
arising out of Phillip's first despatches may be seen in an
official letter from Sydney to the Treasury, dated 29th April, in
which he signified his Majesty's pleasure that a ship-of-war
should be got ready to convey stores and provisions to the
colony. The letter mentions that a ship called the Lady Juliana
had already been taken up for the purpose of transporting
convicts. Phillip's request that some mechanics and overseers
should be sent out, was complied with; but his protest against
any more convicts being sent until the colony was prepared to
receive them, did not meet with any consideration at all. So far
from that being the case, the Minister determined to clear the
gaols at once, by shipping another selection of their inmates to
Port Jackson as soon as the transports could be got ready for
sea. His intention was made known to the public without
delay:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Government have come to a resolution to send out all
the convicts sentenced for transportation, and all the respites,
in the next fleet that is to sail for Botany Bay, in order that
his Majesty's gaols in this kingdom may be at once quite cleared.
<a href="#note-358" name="noteref-358" id=
"noteref-358">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>As this announcement was published a few days after Phillip's
first despatches had reached the Minister's hands, it is clear
that the resolution to clear the gaols again had been formed
without any loss of time, and without any reference to the state
of the colony. Phillip's urgent representations on the subject
counted for nothing. Although it was known that he had been
disappointed in his expectations of finding land fit for
cultivation, and that the men he had to employ for the purpose
understood nothing about it, it was assumed that he would be
prepared to receive another fleet full of the same sort of
material as that he had already to deal with. There was clearly
no consideration either for him or the colony in Sydney's view of
the matter; the one point on which his attention had been
concentrated from the first remained fixed in his mind to the
last&#8212;the gaols should be cleared at any price.</p>
<p>The Home Office addressed the Treasury as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The letters which have been received from Captain
Phillip, Governor of New South Wales, representing that a great
part of the provisions sent out with him to the settlement lately
made upon that coast has been expended, and that there is an
immediate occasion for a further supply, together with certain
articles of clothing, tools, and implements for agriculture,
medicines, &amp;c., for the use of convicts now at that place,
his Majesty has given orders that one of his ships-of-war of two
decks, with only her upper tier of guns, shall forthwith be got
ready to carry out the said provisions and stores.<br>
<br>
I inclose to your lordships herewith estimates of the several
articles which are supposed to be indispensably necessary on the
present occasion; and I am commanded to signify to your lordships
his Majesty's pleasure that you do give orders that the same may
be provided and be put on board of such ships as the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty may appoint for the execution of
that service.<br>
<br>
I am also to acquaint your lordships that the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty have been directed to instruct the officer
commanding the above-mentioned ship to call at Teneriffe and
purchase twenty pipes of wine, and also, in case he should touch
at Rio de Janeiro or the Cape of Good Hope, to take on board as
many black cattle or other live stock as he can conveniently
accommodate, for the amount of which he is directed to draw bills
upon your lordships, which bills it is his Majesty's pleasure you
do discharge whenever they appear, provided they are accompanied
by proper vouchers and certificates that the articles purchased
shall have been obtained upon moderate terms.<br>
<br>
As there are at present but very few artificers and farmers
amongst the convicts now in New South Wales, his Majesty has
thought it adviseable that twenty-five of those confined in the
hulks in the river who are likely to be the most useful should be
sent out in the ship intended to convey the provisions and
stores, and that about eight or ten persons should also be
engaged, and take their passage in the said ship, to be employed
as overseers of the convicts. These measures, I must inform your
lordships, have been strongly recommended by Captain Phillip,
particularly the latter, from his having found by experience that
the convicts placed as overseers have not been able to enforce
their orders and carry that command which persons in a different
situation would be likely to do; his Majesty has therefore
directed me to endeavour to engage the above-mentioned number of
overseers, and to desire that your lordships will make provision
for their salaries (which will not exceed forty pounds per annum
each) as well as for re-imbursing the Naval Department for the
expences of their victualling and that of the twenty-five
convicts before mentioned, during their passage out.<br>
<br>
I understand from Mr. Richards, the contractor for the convicts
on board the Lady Juliana, that after the supplies necessary for
the voyage are put on board, there will still be room for any
article of provisions or stores which may be wanting in New South
Wales. His Majesty has, therefore, commanded me to signify to
your lordship his farther pleasure, that you do order a
proportion of clothing, tools, instruments, medicines, &amp;c.,
equal to one-fourth of the quantity proposed to be sent out in
the ship-of-war, to be placed on board the Lady Juliana; and, in
addition thereto, as many provisions as she can conveniently
stow. The Lady Juliana, in case she should touch at Rio de
Janeiro or the Cape, ought also to take on board any live stock
which can without inconvenience be accommodated, for the supply
of the settlement. It will, therefore, be necessary that your
lordships should cause the superintendent or the master of that
ship to be furnished with proper instructions in that respect
previously to her sailing, which I hope and expect will shortly
take place.</blockquote>
<p>With, this letter, Sydney's official connection with the
colony may be said to have closed. He remained in office until
the 5th June following, when he retired into private life, being
then in the fifty-eighth year of his age. It may be assumed that
the equipment of the ship referred to in his letter&#8212;the
Guardian&#8212;and also the despatch of female convicts by the
Lady Juliana, were carried out, partially at least, under his
instructions, but there is no mention of any further exercise of
his powers on the colony's behalf. The only communication from
him on matters connected with it appears in the shape of a
private letter to Nepean, dated from Frognall, December 21, 1790,
in which he mentioned the receipt of two letters from Phillip, He
wrote in a genial strain, very suggestive of a good-natured
disposition and a desire to assist his friends. It may, or may
not, be some indication of the amount of attention he had paid to
the affairs of the colony, that he did not know how to spell the
name of the Sirius.</p>
<blockquote>I have received two letters to-day from our friend
Phillip, dated the 14th and 15th of last April. He writes in good
spirits and represents the new settlement as having nearly
overcome its difficulties. This is a much better account than I
could have expected.<br>
<br>
He has made three requests. The first is for the rank of master
and commander for the officer who brings his despatches, whom I
suppose to be Lieutenant King of the Syrias, but he does not name
him. The second is some provision for the Commissary, whom he
commends much and represents as a dying man&#8212;two strong
arguments in his favour; but he does not name him neither.<br>
<br>
The last is leave to return home for the regulation of his
private affairs. He makes his last request with much the least
earnestness of any of the three. Probably they may be contained
in his official despatches, but I trouble you with them for Lord
Grenville's information, in case he should have omitted them.<br>
<br>
I should likewise be much obliged to you if you would inform
Lieutenant King (as I take it for granted he is, like all other
seamen, under your protection) that I shall be very glad to see
him whenever he can let me have that pleasure. I shall be in town
to-morrow, and will, if it is not inconvenient, avail myself of
your obliging offer and dine with you. If Mr. King could
breakfast with me on Thursday, he would oblige me very
much.</blockquote>
<p>The two letters from Phillip received by Sydney in December,
1790, had been brought to London by Lieutenant King, who had been
recalled from Norfolk Island for the purpose of being sent to
England. <a href="#note-359" name="noteref-359" id=
"noteref-359">{6}</a> He had sailed from Sydney Cove on the 17th
April in the Supply, bound to Batavia for provisions. King's
account of his friend in his old age, when he was "quite a
cripple, having lost the entire use of his right side",
represents him as even then enjoying good spirits; "his
intellects are very good, and his spirits are what they always
were." That was some evidence of the triumph of mind over matter;
but if he wrote his letters of April, 1790, to Sydney in good
spirits, his self command was nothing less than supreme. Ten days
before he wrote, he had learned the most dismal news that had yet
reached him&#8212;the wreck of the Sirius at Norfolk Island. When
he had sent her on her fatal voyage in March, the colony was
threatened with famine through the non-arrival of the expected
ships from England; and her wreck had deprived it of almost its
only hope of rescue. As soon as the news became known, a panic
spread through the settlement; and at six o'clock in the evening
all the officers of the garrison, civil and military, were
summoned to meet the Governor in council. It was then determined
to reduce the allowance of food, already as low as it could well
be, and to send the Supply to Batavia for provisions. The very
existence of the people, as it then seemed, depended on her safe
return. The prevalent state of mind among them is described by
Collins and Tench as one of extreme dejection, bordering on
despair. Is it conceivable that, under such circumstances,
Phillip could have written to Sydney in good spirits, and
represented the new settlement as having nearly overcome its
difficulties? It seems much more reasonable to suppose that
Sydney's happy indifference to the settlement and the people in
it, led him to interpret Phillip's reserve in the manner most
consistent with his own way of thinking on the subject.</p>
<p>In the dedication of his account of the colony to Sydney,
Collins not only spoke of him as "the Originator of the Plan of
Colonisation of New South Wales", but added that his pages would
show "with how much Wisdom the Measure was suggested and
conducted." That Sydney was not the originator of the plan on
which the colony was founded, is apparent from the proposals
written by Matra and Sir George Young, whose suggestions were
subsequently adapted to official purposes under his lordship's
directions. In one respect, no doubt, he is entitled to credit
for originality in his share of the work, inasmuch as it was
evidently through his influence that it was ultimately cut down
to a scheme for clearing the gaols. "When I conversed with Lord
Sydney on this subject," Matra remarked, "it was observed that
New South Wales would be a very proper region for the reception
of criminals condemned to transportation." That appears to have
been the ruling, if not the only, idea which suggested itself to
the Home Secretary in connection with the project.</p>
<p>The opportunity which was then available for the settlement of
the loyal American colonists in New South Wales was strongly
urged by Matra and Sir George Young, as one reason for colonising
that territory; but it was discarded by Sydney for reasons
unknown. At the time that their proposals were under
consideration, the loyalists, who had suffered severely during
the War of Independence, were pressing their claims for
compensation on the Government. In June, 1788, a debate took
place in the House of Commons on this question, in the course of
which it was stated by Pitt that the claims amounted to between
two and three millions of money. The Government proposed to issue
debentures to the necessary amount, "which would be nearly equal
to a money payment", and to pay them off by instalments by means
of a lottery. <a href="#note-360" name="noteref-360" id=
"noteref-360">{7}</a> This scheme for the relief of the loyalists
commended itself to the House, and was accepted accordingly.
Looked at in the present day, it does not seem a very favourable
specimen of Pitt's statesmanship. It might have occurred to him
that colonists driven from their homes by stress of war in one
part of the British dominions, would form the best possible
material for building up a great colony in another. Had he come
forward with a proposal to colonise New South Wales and to
establish the American loyalists&#8212;or at least some of
them&#8212;in the new world, it would surely have been hailed by
the nation as a proposal worthy of a statesman. Financial critics
might have supported it on the ground that grants of land in the
colony would not form any drain on the Treasury; while many
colonists would have been better pleased with liberal payment in
that shape, than with debentures representing only a small
portion of their losses. Many of the loyalists had gone to Nova
Scotia and elsewhere in search of new homes, and were prepared to
settle in any other country that might be thrown open to them in
the King's dominions. Their readiness to do so was brought under
the notice of the Government in a letter written in 1784 by Matra
to Nepean, which is still in existence among the records.
<a href="#note-361" name="noteref-361" id="noteref-361">{8}</a>
Sydney and his colleagues were consequently in possession of
facts which would have enabled them, had they thought fit, to
found a colony with free settlers of the very kind required for
the purpose.</p>
<p>Some idea of the results that might have been obtained in New
South Wales had the Government resolved to turn the tide of
American emigration towards it, through ever so small a channel,
may be formed from the history of the British American provinces
at that period. From the year 1783, when peace was declared with
the insurgent colonies, the tide flowed strongly towards the
struggling settlements in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince
Edward Island, and Cape Breton, which then offered the nearest
asylum to the unfortunate loyalists. Nova Scotia, in particular,
owed its subsequent prosperity almost entirely to their labours.
Immediately after the treaty of peace had been signed, eighteen
thousand of them settled within its borders, and laid the
foundation of many successful enterprises. They brought with
them, not only large sums of money, vessels, merchandise, cattle,
and household goods, but the settled habits of industrious
colonists. In 1785, a whale fishery was established at Dartmouth
in New Brunswick, by the settlers who came from Nantucket in
Massachusetts; three thousand of whom arrived at the river St.
John in the spring succeeding the peace, followed by twelve
hundred more in the autumn. "The town of Shelburne at Port
Roseway rose up as by enchantment, having a population of twelve
thousand in a few months, where no habitations had previously
existed. Saw-mills and grist-mills were built in all the
settlements in which there was a population sufficient to pay the
expenses." The loyalists who settled in Prince Edward Island were
not only industrious in their various occupations, but extremely
ingenious, building their own houses and making their own shoes,
ploughs, harrows, and carts; while the women spun, knitted, and
weaved linens, cottons, and woollen cloth for domestic use. The
powers of endurance shown by those who went to New Brunswick gave
proof of their capacity for encountering the difficulties
inseparable from colonisation in its earliest stage. They had to
make their homes in the wilds of the country, in the face of a
relentless winter, where their cabins were covered with snow as
soon as they were put up. On their arrival, they found a few
hovels where the city of St. John's is now built, the adjacent
country exhibiting a most desolate aspect, peculiarly
discouraging to men who had just left their homes in the
cultivated parts of the United States. To relieve their distress,
the Governor of the province gave orders that they should be
supplied with provisions for the first year at the public
expense; but as the country was not much cultivated at that time,
food could scarcely be procured on any terms. <a href="#note-362"
name="noteref-362" id="noteref-362">{9}</a></p>
<p>Remembering the state of helplessness in which Phillip found
himself when he endeavoured to open up the country on his
arrival, it is not difficult to see how different his position
would have been had he brought with him some of the colonists who
had looked in vain to the British Government for assistance in
forming a settlement in New South Wales. How well he knew and
felt the difference between such men and those he had to depend
upon, may be seen in the remark he addressed to Sydney:&#8212;"If
fifty farmers were sent out with their families, they would do
more in one year in rendering this colony independent of the
mother country, as to provisions, than a thousand convicts."
Fifty of the American loyalists would have settled all his
agricultural difficulties in a very short time. They would have
shown him how to clear forests, drain swamps, make roads, and
build houses; how to cultivate the soil, and how to turn to
account every native product of the country they might meet with.
They would have led the way in his exploring expeditions, and
instead of being compelled to turn back after a few days'
helpless wandering in the bush, they would have shown him how to
cut a way through it as easily as if they had been guided by the
unerring instinct of the native. The Blue Mountains would not
have defied them for five and twenty years; they would have found
their way across its rugged ranges to the pastoral plains of the
west, as soon as the increase of their flocks and herds had
compelled them to seek fresh pastures. They would have shown,
too, how the soil between Sydney Cove and Botany Bay, which he
had described as "a poor, sandy heath, full of swamps", might be
made to yield all the vegetable produce that his settlement stood
in need of. They would have built their log huts and made their
gardens on the banks of Cook's River, the Parramatta, the
Hawkesbury, and the Nepean; and in the midst of their
cultivations would have been found, in due time, the
school-house, the market, and the church. And had there been
among them any whalers from New England, they would have pointed
out how easily a flourishing trade might be established on the
coast, with every prospect of proving a source of wealth to the
colony and the mother country. <a href="#note-363" name=
"noteref-363" id="noteref-363">{10}</a></p>
<p>The loyalists could have done all these things simply because
they and their fathers had already done them in America. The
hardships and privations of the settlers in a new country were
known to them from experience; they were familiar with the habits
of savages, and they had been accustomed to see the convict
working in their fields. Thus they were armed at all points with
the practical knowledge and experience which would have proved
invaluable in developing the resources of this country. Had they
been sent out to New South Wales in sufficient numbers, with
convict labour to assist them on the plan suggested by Phillip,
they would have brought about far more striking results than they
accomplished in British America. They would have saved the colony
from the protracted agonies of famine and misery of all kinds
which it had to endure for years after its foundation; and they
would have given a character of energy and enterprise to the
population, which would have enabled it to overcome with
comparative ease all the difficulties it had to encounter in
subsequent stages of its history. <a href="#note-364" name=
"noteref-364" id="noteref-364">{11}</a></p>
<p>As it may be assumed that the question whether the loyalists
should be encouraged to settle in New South Wales was fully
considered by the Government in connection with the expedition to
Botany Bay, it is worth while to examine the reasons which may be
supposed to have determined it in the course it pursued. Whatever
they may have been, it is not easy to see, at first sight, what
weight they were entitled to when contrasted with those on the
other side. For some years after the loyalists had been driven
out of the United States, the question as to what should be done
for them by the Government had been a standing subject of
discussion, in Parliament and out of it. In June, 1783, Lord John
Cavendish, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, presented a petition
from their agents, and afterwards moved for a bill instituting a
new commission for the purpose of inquiring who were the persons
entitled to relief in consequence of their sufferings during the
war. <a href="#note-365" name="noteref-365" id=
"noteref-365">{12}</a> It was not until five years had passed
away that. Pitt brought forward his proposal to grant the
sufferers compensation in the shape of debentures, to be paid off
by means of a lottery. During the interval, many of them had
practically settled the difficulty for themselves by removing in
large numbers to British America and the West Indies. <a href=
"#note-366" name="noteref-366" id="noteref-366">{13}</a></p>
<p>There is reason to suppose that it was owing largely to this
question of the loyalists that Matra was led in 1783 to make his
proposals for the colonisation of New South Wales. His paper is
dated 23rd August of that year; in January the independence of
the United States had been recognised, and immediately after that
event the exodus of the colonists began. The essence of his
proposal was that the colony should be founded by free settlers,
and he pointed to the loyalists as the men for the purpose. It
was not until Sydney suggested to him that New South Wales would
be a very proper region for the reception of criminals, that he
added a postscript to that effect. But while he thought of free
settlers, the Government thought only of convicts. The Home
Secretary was constantly troubled with the state-of-the-gaols
question, which had long been the night-mare of his official
slumbers. Where to send the convicts when the ports of the United
States were closed, was the great problem he had to solve. What
to do with the loyalists was not a matter that could trouble the
Government; it could be settled by payment of compensation. If
they were left to themselves, they would go to Nova Scotia or
somewhere else; and wherever they might go, it would be at their
own expense and on their own responsibility.</p>
<p>For the convicts, Sydney argued, some new settlement must be
found, which could be made self-supporting by their industry in
the course of a year or two. The African coast having been
explored for the purpose unsuccessfully, there remained only the
proposal for the colonisation of New South Wales. The chief
objection to it was the distance and consequent length of the
voyage; but there was some compensation in that, because the
convicts could not return to England from the other end of the
world. Sending out the loyalists in any number would involve
several objections. In the first place, there was the question of
expenditure. Their transport and personal expenses would have to
be provided for, while they would require to be maintained for
the first two years at least from the public stores. One of the
most urgent considerations in connection with the project being
the matter of expenditure, this objection became serious. Every
item in the long list of expenses, from the Governor's salary
down to the daily allowance of salt pork, would have to be
carefully scrutinised, in order to reduce the sum total to the
lowest possible amount. Provisions calculated to last two years
would be supplied, out of which the two King's ships would have
to be victualled; and the people sent out, marines and convicts
alike, must then be taught to look to the land for their means of
subsistence.</p>
<p>There was still another point to be considered. The loyalists
had been accustomed to the exercise of all the rights, legal and
political, of freemen in their own colonies; and the Government
had already had a taste of American views on the rights of
colonists. It did not want another. In any case, free settlers
could not be governed on the same principles as convicts; and if
the settlement was to be composed, wholly or in part, of men who
had not forfeited their liberty, Sydney's scheme would have to be
completely altered. The administration of justice could not be
left entirely in the hands of half a dozen young officers of
marines, whose notions of legal principles were those of
soldiers. Englishmen on trial for their lives or liberties,
contesting a question of right, or seeking redress for a wrong,
were entitled by the common law to a jury of twelve; and juries
meant judges who were qualified to expound the law. An
establishment formed on such principles would be essentially
different from that which it was intended to send out with the
convicts. On the one hand, there was a small military camp; on
the other, there would be a free settlement, which would very
soon demand legislative institutions and the right of
self-government on the model of the American colonies.</p>
<p>It is always easier to fall back upon precedent and routine
than to strike out an original course of action; and Sydney might
well have thought it safer to continue the existing system of
transporting convicts to the colonies, than to risk his own
political credit by novel legislation, or by attempting the
establishment of a colony on new principles. The hulks in the
Thames, as well as Newgate and the other gaols in the kingdom,
were crowded with felons of all kinds who&#8212;but for the
American war of independence&#8212;would have been sent off in
shiploads to Maryland and Virginia, as of old. All the material
necessary to found a colony, as he thought, was ready to his
hand, and so the order was given that convicts should in future
be sent to New South Wales instead of to America. The difference
amounted to no more than pointing the ships' heads across the
Pacific, instead of across the Atlantic, Ocean. The exclusion of
free settlers from the scheme, in the first instance, was
probably due to fear of political complications; and such men
would not for many years have been allowed, still less
encouraged, to go out to the colony in any number, but for the
representations made by Phillip. Nor is this view of the matter
altogether to be wondered at, when the history of European
colonisation is borne in mind. Up to that period, it had not
proved an easy matter to obtain free settlers for the purpose of
occupying new countries; there was a strong prejudice, too,
against the emigration of such men; and governments had
consequently been under the and necessity of employing convict
labour and encouraging the slave trade in peopling their
colonies, which were then valued solely for what they could
contribute to the wealth of the parent State. Convict and slave
labour grew universally in demand for working mines, growing
sugar, cotton, and tobacco, and otherwise providing raw material
for the home markets. Transportation and the slave trade had thus
become firmly embedded in the national policy, to such an extent
that the American and West Indian colonies might be said to have
been built up on those foundations.</p>
<p>In this decision of Sydney's may perhaps be found an
explanation of the singular negligence which marked his conduct
of the business. When Collins expressed the hope that his pages
would show "with how much Wisdom the Measure was suggested and
conducted", he knew that they showed only too conclusively with
how little wisdom the colonisation of the territory had been
planned and conducted by the Minister. It is manifest that the
whole scheme had been narrowed down in his mind to a point which
enabled him to meet the pressing emergency of the day; and as
soon as that was accomplished, he thought nothing of sacrificing
the infinitely larger considerations involved in the work.
Everything was made to give way to the mere exigency of the
moment. That the scheme escaped utter wreck and ruin, was due
almost entirely to the vigilance and foresight displayed by
Phillip throughout the term of his command.</p>
<p>In justice to Sydney, it should be borne in mind that, while
he was engaged in framing his colonial policy, so to speak, he
could not have had any conception as to the real or prospective
value of the territory which was about to be occupied in the old
convict fashion. Beyond the account he had read in Cook's Voyage
of the land at Botany Bay, and the information he had obtained
from Sir Joseph Banks, he knew nothing about the capabilities of
the soil or the character of the country; and possibly he was so
far misled on the subject as to believe that the cultivation of
the land would soon render the colonists independent of further
supplies. Until the publication of Cook's volumes, there was
nothing to encourage a belief that the east coast of New Holland
was very much better than the west, which Dampier had described
as a dreary waste, occupied by the miserablest people in the
world. The descriptions given by Matra and Sir George Young of
the various products of New South Wales, and of the valuable
trade that might be carried on with them, were probably regarded
either as visionary speculations, or else as involving difficult
complications with the East India Company. It was not until
Phillip's despatches were read that very different ideas as to
the nature of the territory were spread abroad through the public
press. The nation then learned that his fleet had sailed
unexpectedly into the "finest harbour in the world, in which a
thousand sail of the line might ride in safety"; that the country
was a fine one, with a healthy climate, and that free settlers
only were required to make it "the most valuable acquisition
Great Britain had ever made."</p>
<p>When it was determined on the one hand that none but convicts
and their guards should be sent out, and on the other that the
colony must be made self-supporting by their labour, it is
obvious enough, now, that two inconsistent propositions were laid
down. But it was not obvious then. All that was known about the
merits of convicts as agriculturists was derived from their
history on the American plantations, where their labour had been
readily bought up on the arrival of the transports, and utilised
by the buyers on a well-developed system. The men were worked in
gangs under competent overseers, and were not only made to work
but were thoroughly drilled in their business. Under that system,
they had done well, as a rule, many of them having ultimately
passed into the ranks of respectable settlers or free labourers.
It had worked so smoothly for many years that Sydney's faith in
the qualifications of convicts as farm labourers may possibly
have come to him as a tradition of the Home Office. For either
his faith in their capabilities was strong, or his action in
sending out such people as he did was inconceivably reckless.
There would be no exaggeration in saying that every life in the
settlement was jeopardised by it.</p>
<p>The conclusion to which one is naturally led on this subject
is that the statesmanship of the time was not equal to the
conception of a project for the foundation of a great colony, on
principles which would now-a-days be deemed worthy of England. If
it was owing entirely to the blunders of Ministers that the
American colonies were lost to it, the same reason will account
for the ignoble choice between convicts and free settlers made by
the Pitt Ministry when the colonisation of New South Wales was
undertaken. It was a greater blunder in its way than the passing
of the Stamp Act in 1765; for that might have been remedied by
repeal, but the other could not. In all that related to the
execution of the project, the matter was determined by the
meanest considerations. The future of the colony was ignored as
coolly as the sufferings of the wretched people sent out to it.
The great moral questions involved in the employment of convicts
in founding a colony did not meet with any attention whatever.
Just as it was resolved that female savages should be carried
away from their island homes in order to provide convicts with
wives, so it was determined that the settlement of the territory
should be confined to felons in preference to freemen. The social
results likely to arise in either case were not viewed as they
would be in the present day; they were shut out of consideration
altogether, and the question at issue was reduced to one of
practical convenience. <a href="#note-367" name="noteref-367" id=
"noteref-367">{14}</a></p>
<p>There does not appear to be any foundation for the idea, to
which some writers have given expression, that the scheme for the
settlement of this territory was matured by Pitt, still less that
it originated with him in a patriotic desire to create new
colonies in place of the old. Had the Prime Minister taken any
active part in the matter, some traces at least of his hand would
have been found in the course of the long negotiations which
preceded the sailing of the First Fleet. But beyond an inquiry
addressed to an Under Secretary for a statement of the estimated
expenditure, probably required for the purpose of the budget,
there is no indication that he had devoted more than passing
attention to the project. If there were any reason to suppose
that he had framed the society which was put together on the
shores of Sydney Cove by Phillip, it would greatly justify
Brougham's opinion of his statesmanship:&#8212;"For the leading
defect of his life, which is seen through all his measures, and
which not even his great capacity and intense industry could
supply, was an ignorance of the principles on which large
measures are to be framed, and nations to be at once guided and
improved." <a href="#note-368" name="noteref-368" id=
"noteref-368">{15}</a></p>
<p>There was a still graver defect in his statesmanship to which
Brougham made no allusion in his summary of Pitt's shortcomings;
but it was one that was common to all the statesmen of his age.
His energies were devoted so exclusively to financial and foreign
affairs that the great social questions of the time received no
attention from him. While he was devising new schemes for
improving the revenue, or fresh combinations for checking the
progress of the French Revolution, such small matters as the
education of the people, the prevention of crime by means of an
effective system of police, the amendment of the criminal laws,
the purification of the gaols, and the introduction of sound
methods of penal discipline, were entirely overlooked. During his
tenure of office as Prime Minister, which lasted for eighteen
years, these questions remained as they were when he began his
career; and so far as his administration was concerned, the moral
state of the nation benefited no more by his policy than it did
by that of Sir Robert Walpole, or any other of his predecessors.
He seemed, indeed, to think that because questions of internal
reform were officially within the province of his Home Secretary,
they were beneath the dignity of a Prime Minister, and
accordingly confined his attention to questions with which his
political reputation was identified; but the result was that
nothing of any moment was done in the shape of domestic
legislation. Sydney's capacity for originating useful measures
never displayed itself; and although Howard and Bentham had done
so much to smooth the way for reform, no measures were taken
during his time for the improvement of penal discipline. The old
system of transportation was continued without any attempt to
prevent its abuses, and another continent was polluted with the
scum of England's people, with as much indifference to results as
if the history of American colonisation had never been
written.</p>
<p>The proposal to occupy this territory necessarily required the
sanction of the Prime Minister, and to that extent it came under
his official notice; but there was nothing in it that appealed to
his imagination or stirred the current of his ambition. A
proposal to occupy the Falkland Islands or Tristan Da Cunha would
have made quite as much impression on him. Everything connected
with the project, from first to last, appears to have been left
entirely to Sydney; and the many singular mistakes which were
made in the execution of it can be understood if we suppose that
he left everything to Nepean, while Nepean left everything to
somebody else. That Sydney was not a statesman of unusual
capacity is apparent from the reports of his speeches in
Parliament. Whatever the subject he discussed, he was evidently
reluctant to take any view of it that was not essentially
commonplace. He held office for many years, and had abundant
opportunities for distinguishing himself in Parliament; but his
name is not associated with any measure of importance, except
that of the settlement of New South Wales. It is a remarkable
fact that one of the least notable politicians of the time should
have exercised far more influence over the destinies of a young
nation than any of his illustrious contemporaries. <a href=
"#note-369" name="noteref-369" id="noteref-369">{16}</a></p>
<p>There was but one man in the Parliament of that time who had
devoted any serious attention to the affairs of the colonies, or
who could be said to have formed any opinions of his own on the
philosophy of colonisation. His speech on Conciliation with
America, delivered in 1775, shews that he had devoted himself as
warmly to colonial affairs then, as he did in later years to
questions connected with the government of India and the French
Revolution. But in 1788 the American question had burnt itself
out, with such results to minds like Burke's that matters
relating to the colonies had lost whatever interest they once
possessed&#8212;even if the more sensational incidents connected
with French and Indian politics had left him any appetite for
smaller game. There is nothing to show that his attention was
ever directed to the settlement of New South Wales, either at the
time when the Government scheme was slowly evolving itself, or in
later years. And if it had been, there is no reason to believe
that he would have interfered with a view to the amendment of the
Ministerial plans, however deeply impressed he might have been
with their impolicy. The state of his mind on colonial questions
at that time may be seen in his speeches in the House of Commons
on the Quebec Government Bill, introduced by Pitt in 1791,
<a href="#note-370" name="noteref-370" id="noteref-370">{17}</a>
By far the most advanced statesman of his day, Burke was not in
conflict with the established policy of the country on general
questions. No doubt he was aware of the moral objections to the
transportation system, and was well acquainted with the views of
the colonists on that subject; but he never raised his voice
against it, except when he protested against the inhumanity of
sending convicts to the African coast. <a href="#note-371" name=
"noteref-371" id="noteref-371">{18}</a> Clearly as he saw that,
he did not seem to see that there were equally grave objections
to sending shiploads of criminals to colonise a new country. The
moral sentiment of the age on such questions, so far as it had
any existence, found no expression in him. He had nothing to say
about the iniquities of the system, and much less than might have
been expected about the horrors of the slave trade&#8212;the two
most objectionable facts in the history of his time. <a href=
"#note-372" name="noteref-372" id="noteref-372">{19}</a></p>
<p>What the slave trade meant to the colonies may be seen in the
case of the West Indies and the United States&#8212;the one
ruined by it, the other forced to undergo the most terrible
struggle recorded in history in order to get rid of it. But
neither the picture of desolation and decay presented in the case
of the Indies, nor the one million lives and two thousand
millions of money wasted by the States, can be said to furnish an
adequate measure of the evil inflicted on the colonies through
the long years of its existence. That must be left to the
imagination. It would be equally difficult to form an estimate of
the wrong done to them by the transportation of convicts to their
shores. To plant criminals in every little centre of population
through the length and breadth of the land, working on the farms,
the roads, and the public buildings of a young country, where
society has hardly had time to establish itself, is to create the
most formidable obstacle to social progress that can be
conceived. The moral result of such an element is concentrated
poison of the most virulent kind, certain to make itself felt in
a thousand unsuspected places, and sometimes to break out in an
eruption of atrocious crime.</p>
<p>The dullness of vision on these subjects which shows itself so
palpably in the statesmanship of the last century, is one of the
most conspicuous features in its history. There was not a
statesman of that time who expressed any doubt as to the good
results likely to flow from the transportation system. All
argument on the subject was summed up in the dogma that, if the
mother country benefited by it in one way, the colony derived an
equal advantage in another. <a href="#note-373" name=
"noteref-373" id="noteref-373">{20}</a> In the course of a short
discussion in the House of Commons on Botany Bay in 1791, Pitt
expressed the following sentiment:&#8212; <a href="#note-374"
name="noteref-374" id="noteref-374">{21}</a></p>
<blockquote>That it was a necessary and essential point of police
to send some of the most incorrigible criminals out of the
kingdom, no man could entertain a doubt; since it must be
universally admitted that it was the worst policy of a State to
keep offenders of that description at home to corrupt others and
contaminate the less guilty, by communicating their own dangerous
depravity.</blockquote>
<p>Here we see that, while Pitt's mind was occupied with the fear
of innocent people in England being corrupted and contaminated by
contact with criminals, it did not occur to him that equally
innocent people in the colony might in after years become the
victims of similar associations. Nor did the matter meet with any
attention from a Select Committee of the House of Commons which,
in 1812, recommended that women of the worst class should be sent
out to become the mothers of a new race.</p>
<blockquote>They are aware that the women sent out are of the
most abandoned description, and that in many instances they are
likely to whet and to encourage the vices of the men, whilst but
a small proportion will make any step towards reformation; but
yet, with all their vices, such women as these were the mothers
of a great part of the inhabitants now existing in the colony,
and from this stock only can a reasonable hope be held out of
rapid increase to the population.</blockquote>
<p>The Committee saw no objection to the idea of populating the
colony with generation after generation descended from the
outcasts of the streets. They not only made no recommendation to
substitute free settlers for convicts, but the tenor of their
argument shows that they looked upon the existing system as
perfectly sound in principle.</p>
<p>The slave trade and the transportation system have long since
passed away; but it is necessary to bear in mind how closely they
had grown up together through successive ages, in order to
appreciate the reasoning which, in the eyes of statesmen of the
last century, justified the colonisation of a new country by
means of chain-gangs instead of free settlers. It is difficult,
in the present day, to understand how a colonial policy based on
principles so revolting could have found favour in England, until
we recollect that they were adopted in the first instance, and
were maintained in after years, because they appeared then to be
a natural and proper, if not the only, means of solving a very
difficult problem&#8212;how to occupy and cultivate the waste
places of the earth. No nation in Europe at that time had any
surplus population seeking an outlet in the colonies. <a href=
"#note-375" name="noteref-375" id="noteref-375">{22}</a> In the
present day, every nation is in that position; although there is
only one that possesses colonies capable of absorbing large
numbers of emigrants from year to year. The old policy has so
completely died out as to be almost forgotten by a generation
occupied with the development of a new one, every feature in
which indicates a complete revolution in the minds of Englishmen.
To those who are familiar with the literature of the eighteenth
century relating to the colonies, that of the present day is
something more than refreshing. The newspaper and magazine
writers of former times looked upon the distant possessions of
England as so many fields for comic satire; <a href="#note-376"
name="noteref-376" id="noteref-376">{23}</a> novelists sought
material in them for the romance of crime and stirring adventures
in low life; political economists studied their annual lists of
imports and exports, in order to calculate their precise value to
the mother country. There was no dream then of Imperial
Federation; there was no talk about Greater Britain and the
Expansion of England; there were no schemes for bringing about a
closer union between the colonies and the mother country. Their
politics were treated with contempt; their social status was
regarded with scorn and aversion; their manufactures were sternly
prohibited; their commerce was strangled by the Trade and
Navigation laws; and so little were they valued as component
parts of the empire that one wrong-headed Minister after another
was suffered to goad the greatest of them into rebellion by a
series of hostile measures&#8212;and that, too, at a time when
the capture of a small island in the tropics by the French or
Spaniards, would have set the nation in a flame.<br>

The Annual Register for 1789 did not give much prominence to the
news. In its chronicle of events (p. 256), it announced under the
heading&#8212;"Account of the New Settlement at Botany Bay", that
"an authentic account has been received that his Majesty's ships
the Sirius and Supply, under the command of Commodore Phillips,
with the transports under their convoy, having the convicts on
board for Botany Bay, have made good their passage." Then
followed a short account of the principal events mentioned in the
despatches. Equal importance seems to have been attached by the
editor to another "authentic account" which immediately follows
the news from Botany Bay&#8212;containing a description of "the
much talked-of fight between Perrins, of Birmingham, and Johnson,
of London."</p>

The Gentleman's Magazine for April, 1789 (p. 340), began its
review of Captain Tench's Narrative in this
fashion:&#8212;"Whether the empire of North America were founded
by men who retreated from the face of Justice in Europe under the
mask of conscience and liberty, or were transported thither by
the hand of Justice in succeeding ages, certain it is" &amp;c.
The criminal character of the first American settlers was thus
accepted as a fact beyond dispute, and the legend of the Pilgrim

Until the year 1791, no idea seems to have occurred to any one,
either in England or in the colony, as to the probable existence
of whales in large numbers off the coast of New South Wales.
Neither Matra nor Sir George Young, in describing the various
resources of the country and the prospect it afforded of opening
up new branches of trade, made any reference to a whale fishery
as a possible source of wealth. How plentiful the fish were in
Phillip's time may be seen from the fact that one was washed
ashore on the coast near Botany Bay in 1788, and another entered
the harbour in July, 1790&#8212;where it remained for several
weeks, during which it upset a boat containing a midshipman and
three marines, of whom two were drowned. Phillip's silence leads
one to infer that he had not formed any idea on the subject. The
first proposal to establish a fishery came from the master of the
transport Britannia, which arrived in October, 1791. He set out
on a cruise with five other ships soon afterwards, and on his
return in a few weeks reported that "upwards of fifteen thousand
whales were seen in the first ten days that he was absent, the
greater number of which were observed off this
harbour."&#8212;Collins, p. 187; Tench, Complete Account, p. 209.
Cook makes no mention of whales in these seas; but Dampier
noticed them in large numbers off the west coast in
1699:&#8212;"The Sea is plentifully stock'd with the largest
Whales that I ever saw."&#8212;Vol. iii, p, 106.</p>

Burke's description of the enterprise shown by the American
colonists, particularly as regards their whale fisheries, forms
one of the most striking passages in his speech on Conciliation
with America, 1775.&#8212;"Look at the manner in which the people
of New England have of late carried on the whale fishery. Neither
the perseverance of Holland, nor the activity of France, nor the
dexterous and firm sagacity of English enterprise, ever carried
this most perilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to which
it has been pushed by this recent people; a people who are still,
as it were, but in the gristle, and not yet hardened into the
bone of manhood."</p>

The position of the loyalists, after the close of the war, may be
seen in a notice published in the Monthly Review for July, 1786,
vol. lxxiii, p. 63, of a pamphlet entitled An Address to the
Loyal Part of the British Empire and the Friends of Monarchy
throughout the Globe. By John Cruden, Esq., President of the
Assembly of the United Loyalists, &amp;c. The Review
said:&#8212;"The fate of the American loyalists in the southern
provinces is peculiarly distressing. It is stated that they took
refuge in Florida, under the promise of protection from the
British Government, but on the event of the peace, found
themselves left unnoticed in the hands of the Spaniards, to whom
that province was ceded, and by whom they were ordered to quit
it. In this exigence they have empowered Mr. Cruden, one of their
number, whom they chose for their president, to negociate a
lottery, on the plan of our State lottery, only for dollars
instead of pounds, to procure them present relief."&#8212;Many of
the loyalists in Georgia went to Jamaica; Gentleman's Magazine
for January, 1783, vol. liii, p. 84.<br>
<br>
In a series of resolutions passed at a meeting of the freeholders
of the town of Worcester, in New England, held on the 19th May,
1783, the loyalists were described as "a set of people who have
been, by the united voice of this continent, declared outlaws,
exiles, aliens, and enemies", and it was resolved that should any
presume to enter the town, they should be immediately confined
for the purpose of transportation according to law. These
resolutions were referred to in the Gentleman's Magazine for
July. 1783, vol. liii, p. 615, as expressing "the general sense
of the inhabitant from one end of America to the other."</p>

The slow growth of opinion on this question may be seen in Dr.
Lang's comment on it, in his Historical Account of New South
Wales. Having stated the three main objects of the British
Government in the formation of the proposed settlement, one of
which was "to form a British colony out of those materials which
the reformation of the criminals might gradually supply to the
Government, in addition to the families of free emigrants who
might from time to time be induced to settle in the newly
discovered territory", the Rev. Dr. remarked:&#8212;"These, the
reader will doubtless acknowledge, were objects altogether worthy
of the enlightened legislature of a great nation; in fact, it was
the most interesting and the noblest experiment that had ever
been made on the moral capabilities of man." This was published
in 1834; but it is not conceivable that any such doctrine could
be seriously uttered by a great advocate of morality and religion
in the present day.</p>

included Fox and Burke, he was appointed a Secretary of State on
the retirement of Fox. This administration was formed in March
and dissolved in July of the same year, when it was succeeded by
the Earl of Shelburne's Ministry, which existed from July to the
following April; the coalition between Fox and North then coming
into power. Sydney was in office under Lord Shelburne as Home
Secretary, and was appointed to the same department in Pitt's

follows:&#8212;"Many have been the discouragements to the
settlement of this colony. The French and Indian irruptions, to
which we have always been exposed, have driven many families into
New Jersey. At home, the British Acts for the transportation of

the industrious and honest poor, both in the kingdom of Great
Britain and in Ireland."&#8212;Poet, p. 536.</p>

<h3>2.3 ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
<small>[1788-1828]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>HOW</small> little importance was attached in those
days to the moral aspect of public questions, may be seen in the
provision made for the administration of justice in the colony.
It is an ancient boast of English jurisprudence that the meanest
subject in the realm is as much entitled to the protection of its
laws as the greatest; one of his safeguards being that, when
placed on his trial, he must be tried by a jury of his countrymen
before a judge whose independence of the Crown is not open to
suspicion. But the Criminal Court established in the colony was
not a Court of Justice in any sense consistent with legal
definitions. The persons tried before it were not tried according
to the common law of England. They were tried by a Court invented
for the occasion, framed on the model of a Garrison
Court-martial, but wanting even the security it afforded for an
impartial administration of justice; every trial being conducted
on a system originally established for the preservation of
military discipline by a rough and ready process of arriving at
conclusions&#8212;a process well enough adapted to cases in which
soldiers were to be tried for petty offences against discipline,
but which amounted to a flagrant denial of justice when civilians
were arraigned on charges entailing terrible punishment. Where
was the moral justification for a law by which people sent out to
form a colony were denied a right that could not have been denied
them in England? What assurance could there be that any man
condemned to suffer death or flogging in the Judge-Advocate's
Court had been justly convicted? Even if the right to be tried
for any subsequent offence according to the common law had been
forfeited on a conviction and sentence to transportation, it
would have revived on the expiration of the sentence; yet not
only was every convict deprived of it for life, but every free
settler was involved in the forfeiture. The vicious system thus
established was maintained long after the colony numbered such
settlers by thousands, and the right of trial by jury&#8212;the
birthright of every Englishman&#8212;was not conceded until 1828.
<a href="#note-377" name="noteref-377" id=
"noteref-377">{1}</a></p>
<p>Even when a "Constitution" was granted to the colony in 1823,
<a href="#note-378" name="noteref-378" id="noteref-378">{2}</a>
and a Legislative Council composed of five persons, appointed by
the Crown, was created for the purpose of tempering the arbitrary
authority of the Governor, it was still considered necessary to
withhold the right, except in civil cases, of trial by jury. By a
Charter of Justice issued in that year, a Supreme Court of New
South Wales was created, in place of the several Courts
previously existing&#8212;known as the Criminal Court, the
Governor's Court, the Supreme Court, the Court of Vice-Admiralty,
and the High Court of Appeals. The Act required that all issues
of fact on the criminal side of the Supreme Court should be tried
"by a jury of seven commissioned officers of his Majesty's sea
and land forces", nominated by the Governor. The only concession
made was the right of challenge on the ground of interest or
affection. On the civil side, issues of fact were to be tried by
the Chief Justice and two assessors. Justices of the Peace, who
were to be nominated by the Governor, and who might be challenged
on any ground allowed in the Courts at Westminster. By consent of
parties, such cases might be tried before a jury of twelve
freeholders. But prosecutions were no longer to be conducted by
the person who presided as judge, and that person an officer of
marines; a barrister was appointed Chief Justice and another
Attorney-General, whose duty it was to draw the indictment in
criminal cases and to appear in Court for the Crown, according to
the practice of the English Courts. <a href="#note-379" name=
"noteref-379" id="noteref-379">{3}</a></p>
<p>This reform in the administration of the law was the result of
an elaborate report made by a special commissioner&#8212;John
Thomas Bigge&#8212;who was sent out in 1819 to report on "the
state of the judicial establishments" and other matters in the
colony. Early in that year the free settlers had sent home a
petition in which they expressed their objections to the existing
method of administering the criminal law, and prayed for some
measure of reform. Their objections&#8212;as stated by
Bigge&#8212;were principally these:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>1. The combination in the person of the
Judge-Advocate of the duties of a magistrate (who commits the
prisoner upon investigations conducted by himself), of
prosecutor, of juryman, and of judge.<br>
<br>
2. The military character of the Court, to the members of which
there is no right of challenge, and from whose decisions there is
no right of appeal; the military title of the presiding member
[Judge-Advocate]; and the occurrence of cases wherein the accuser
was a member of the Court.<br>
<br>
3. The general unfitness and incapacity of a Court so constituted
to administer impartial justice to the free and respectable
population of the colony, or to command their respect; the
repugnance of its forms and proceedings to the feelings of the
petitioners as Englishmen, and to the institutions of their
native country. <a href="#note-380" name="noteref-380" id=
"noteref-380">{4}</a></blockquote>
<p>The first of these objections&#8212;which was described by the
Commissioner as "the principal and most popular" of all&#8212;was
so forcible that nothing could be urged in reply to it; and he
was consequently obliged to recommend the appointment of an
Attorney-General, "whose duty it should be to receive all
depositions from the magistrates, to prepare indictments, and to
conduct prosecutions". As to the other members of the Court, the
Commissioner was not at all clear that the military jury could be
replaced by a better one. While admitting that several of the
officers "are frequently too young for that duty", he maintained
that "the character, qualifications, and sentiments of the higher
ranks of officers are superior to those of the best selected
juries in England, and greatly so to those who might be selected
for such a duty in New South Wales"&#8212;p. 35; and after a
lengthy discussion of the subject, he arrived at the conclusion
that "the period is not yet arrived at which the system of trial
by jury can be safely or advantageously introduced into the civil
and criminal proceedings of the colony"&#8212;p. 40.</p>
<p>It was on the recommendations contained in this Report that
the Government framed the Act of 1823, giving the colonists the
forms of English procedure, but still withholding the substance.
Bigge's Report appears to have been written mainly for the
purpose of providing the Government with certain specific reasons
for continuing the system of which the colonists complained so
often and so persistently. When, for instance, he stated that the
military jurors in the colony were superior to the best selected
jurors in England, he knew that no one in that country would
listen to such an argument in support of a proposal to substitute
military juries there for the existing system. If it was no
argument in England, it was none in New South Wales; the simple
question being, whether the colonists were entitled to trial by
jury according to the laws of England.</p>
<p>For some years before the Chief Justice arrived in the colony,
the pressure of business in the Judge-Advocate's Court led to a
curious modification of the original practice. Owing to the
increase of crime, the judge, according to Wentworth, found
himself unable to dispose of all the cases, civil and criminal,
set down for hearing in his Court; and business was therefore
distributed in the following fashion:&#8212;offenders already
under sentence were dealt with in a summary manner by the benches
of magistrates and the Superintendent of Police; while the
Judge-Advocate reserved himself for respectable cases, the
persons brought before him being either free persons or
emancipists. The convicts were punished.</p>
<blockquote>either by transporting them to the Coal River, by
putting them in the gaol gangs, by sending them (if they happen
to be females) to the factory, or by simply ordering them
corporal punishment, unless they are charged with murder, or some
capital felony; and even in this latter case, they [the
magistrates] frequently inflict some similar punishment. <a href=
"#note-381" name="noteref-381" id=
"noteref-381">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>This system meant trial by Court-martial for free settlers,
and summary punishment for convicts.</p>
<p>From the foundation of the colony to the year 1824, when the
Supreme Court began its sittings with Francis Forbes as Chief
Justice, every criminal trial in the colony took place, or was
supposed to take place, before the Judge-Advocate and the six
officers who sat with him. The system on which the administration
of justice was conducted during that period would form a curious
chapter in the history of English law. Writing in 1819&#8212;when
the country was comparatively prosperous and largely populated,
numbering many free settlers among its
inhabitants&#8212;Wentworth wrote of the Judge-Advocate's Court
as follows&#8212;p. 365:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The bare appearance of this tribunal has long been
odious and revolting to the majority of the colonists. It is
disgusting to an Englishman to see a culprit, however heinous may
be his offence, arraigned before a Court clad in full military
costume; nor can it indeed be readily conceived that a body of
men, whose principles and habits must have been materially
influenced, if not entirely formed, by a code altogether foreign
to the laws of this country, should be able on such occasions to
divest themselves of the soldier and to judge as the
citizen.</blockquote>
<p>If the appearance of the military Court was disgusting to
Wentworth&#8212;who at the time he wrote was reading for the Bar
in London&#8212;it seems to have made a similar impression on the
Chief Justice, when he found himself administering the law of
England in the new Supreme Court with seven officers, in full
uniform, serving as jurors. A criminal trial could not take place
in his Court without a military jury; but as the law provided
that Courts of Quarter Sessions should be held, without
specifying the kind of jury to be empanelled in them, Forbes
determined that the common law should fill up the gap left by the
statute. A rule <i>nisi</i> for a mandamus was accordingly
directed to the magistrates, requiring them to show cause why
they should not proceed to the trial of crimes and misdemeanours
according to the law and practice of England. The rule was argued
by the Solicitor-General for the magistrates and the
Attorney-General for the other side; and judgment was given by
the Chief Justice in favour of the common law. His ruling held
good until the second Constitution Act came out in 1828. It was
then found that the military juries were to be continued as
before, in Quarter Sessions as well as in the Supreme Court; and
thus Forbes found his well meant effort to introduce trial by
jury quietly extinguished.</p>
<p>No stronger condemnation of the military system could be
imagined than that implied in the course he had adopted. It
amounted to a public declaration that although he could not grant
prisoners on trial in the Supreme Court a jury of twelve good men
and true, he would avail himself of a loophole in the
Constitution Act for the purpose of securing it at the Quarter
Sessions. That Act, by the way, had been drafted by him, under
instructions from the Home Government, before he came out to the
colony, and he may consequently be supposed to have understood
its intention. For five years, from the time he issued the writ
of mandamus to the day when the second Constitution Act became
law in the colony, a jury of twelve, empanelled according to the
practice of the English Courts, heard and determined every case
brought before the magistrates at Quarter Sessions. The contrast
between the trials in that Court and those in the Supreme Court,
where the Chief Justice sat with a military jury, furnished a
spectacle which had never been witnessed before in the British
dominions.</p>
<p>It is necessary to glance at the course of events in this
direction up to the period when trial by jury was thus let in at
the back door, in order to appreciate the character of the system
which the adventurous Chief Justice endeavoured to break down.
The language used by Wentworth with respect to it was very
emphatic; but it was language which would naturally rise to the
lips of an Englishman when confronted with a method of
administering justice which seemed to violate every principle of
English law. To secure a just and impartial verdict on a criminal
trial, where the power of the Crown is arrayed against the
prisoner at the bar, it was held essential in England that both
judge and jury should be independent of it; but in the
Judge-Advocate's Court, both were in its pay, dependent on it for
promotion and liable to removal by it at any moment. It was also
considered essential that the judge and the jury should be
independent of each other; each having a separate province, one
for questions of law, the other for questions of fact. But in the
Judge-Advocate's Court, both sat together and deliberated as one
body over questions of law and fact; so that while the jurors
were liable to be unduly influenced by the judge, he in his turn
was in danger of being induced to modify his own opinion in
deference to theirs. <a href="#note-382" name="noteref-382" id=
"noteref-382">{6}</a></p>
<p>A third principle recognised in English practice was that the
judge and the prosecutor should know nothing of each other; and
that so far from the former being in any manner identified with
the prosecution, or being supposed to have any concern in it or
any leaning towards it, he was, by a pleasant fiction of law,
habitually regarded as of counsel for the prisoner. But in the
Judge-Advocate's Court, the judge and the prosecutor were
practically one and the same person; for although it was usual to
leave the conduct of simple cases in the hands of the person who
made the charge, the indictment was drawn up by the
Judge-Advocate, and the evidence to support it had to be
considered by him before he could determine whether or not a
prosecution ought to take place. A fourth principle which
regulated the practice of the English Courts required that the
established rules of evidence should be adhered to and applied in
all cases; and for that purpose it was the especial function of
the judge to see that those rules were strictly observed, and
that no question was asked or answered, and no evidence allowed
to go to the jury, which was not technically admissible according
to the reported rulings of the judges. But in the
Judge-Advocate's Court that principle was altogether ignored,
because the judge, not being a lawyer, could not know anything
about the law of evidence. There was consequently no means either
of checking the admission of evidence which would have been held
inadmissible in England, or of presenting it to the jury in such
a shape as would have enabled them to discriminate between truth
and falsehood, to gauge the credit of a witness, and to arrive at
their conclusion by some better process than that of mere
conjecture.</p>
<p>There was a still more characteristic principle which was not
recognised in this Court. The law of England abhorred secresy in
the administration of justice, and the most essential of all
features in a trial was that it should be public. The accused was
entitled to hear every word that was alleged against him in
evidence, or urged against him either in the addresses of counsel
or the remarks of the judge. But in the Military Court the
Judge-Advocate and the other members "retired to an adjoining
room", when the evidence was closed, in order that they might
discuss the various questions of law and fact that had arisen
during the hearing of the case. Neither the prisoner nor the
public knew anything of what passed while the discussion was
going on, and consequently there was no opportunity for
correcting mistakes or removing misapprehensions. The practice on
these occasions is described in Bigge's Report as follows, p.
13:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The members had here an opportunity of discussing the
questions that had arisen, of hearing the opinion of the
Judge-Advocate, and of deciding upon their verdict and sentence.
Upon their return to the Court, the Judge-Advocate resumed the
open consideration of the case, made reference to the questions
of law and fact that had already been decided by the Court, and
in doing this he sometimes read the evidence from his
notes.</blockquote>
<p>The impression made upon Bigge's mind by this method of
conducting a trial, may be seen in the suggestions for its
improvement which he felt called upon to make:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I suggested to the Judge-Advocate the expediency of
summing up the evidence from his notes in the form of a charge,
and of stating all questions of law and fact, as well as his own
view of them, to the members of the Court before they retired, in
the presence of the prisoner and the public.</blockquote>
<p>The object of that suggestion was to give the proceedings the
appearance of a public trial. The Judge-Advocate was good enough
to take the hint, and from that time&#8212;1820&#8212;he ceased
to retire with the other members until he had said all that he
had to say in public. It was the first time for thirty-two years
that the Criminal Court had been ventilated; and some credit is
due to Bigge for having let in the fresh air of public criticism
on its proceedings.</p>
<p>In criticising the constitution of this Court, Wentworth
asked, "What motive existed for excluding the civil officers?
Were they either less competent to be members of a Court whose
decisions ought to be founded solely on the laws of England, or
were they less respectable than the military and naval?" <a href=
"#note-383" name="noteref-383" id="noteref-383">{7}</a> They were
not excluded for either reason; but simply because, the Court
being virtually a Court-martial, civil officers could not
properly have a seat in it. Nor would it have mended matters in
the least if they had not been excluded. The Court would still
have been open to the same objections, seeing that civil officers
were just as much under the influence of the Crown as military
and naval men; they were appointed by it and removable by it.
Moreover, their presence in such a Court would have been
objectionable for two reasons; first, because they would have
felt out of their element in it; and secondly, because while the
military members would necessarily have had some knowledge of the
law and practice of their own tribunals, the civil officers would
have had none; and it is obviously better that a Court, whatever
its constitution, should be composed of men who understand their
business than of men who do not. As to the decisions of the Court
being founded solely on the laws of England, that was true only
in the sense that the laws were to be interpreted and applied
according to the practice of the Courts-martial. The plain fact
was that, to all intents and purposes, the colony was placed
under martial law, in the manner of a disturbed district; and the
laws of England&#8212;as we understand them&#8212;were not in
force within its borders until the practice of the Courts at
Westminster was substituted for that of the military
tribunal.</p>
<p>The method of trial established by the Act of 1787 might be
very fairly described in the language applied by Burke to the
trial of American rebels in England under an Act passed during
the War of Independence, founded on a statute of Henry the Eighth
providing for the trial in England of treasons committed out of
the realm. By that Act, wrote Burke in his letter to the Sheriffs
of Bristol (1777)&#8212;"almost all that is substantial and
beneficial in a trial by jury" was taken away from the American
subject; "for to try a man under it is, in effect, to condemn him
unheard. A person is brought hither in the dungeon of a ship's
hold; loaded with irons, unfurnished with money, unsupported by
friends, where no one local circumstance that tends to detect
perjury can possibly be judged of; such a person may be executed
according to form, but he can never be tried according to
justice." It should not be forgotten that trial by military jury
was not confined to convicts; all persons in the colony were
subject to it. The free settler had no more privilege in that
respect than the felon working in a chain-gang; the law being no
respecter of persons. <a href="#note-384" name="noteref-384" id=
"noteref-384">{8}</a></p>
<p>A singular case which occurred in 1789 serves to show how the
administration of justice was carried on under this system. In
March of that year, six marines were tried on a charge of having
robbed the public store of liquor and provisions, were found
guilty and, of course, executed. The principal evidence against
them was that of an accomplice; but there was another witness, a
woman named Mary Turner, whose evidence was unsatisfactory to the
members of the Court. After she had left the witness-box, the
judge directed the Provost-Marshal to detain her in
custody&#8212;presumably with a view to instituting proceedings
against her for perjury. This matter gave rise to a warm
correspondence between the Judge-Advocate and Captain Campbell,
one of the jury, which soon after involved all the other
officers, as well as Major Ross and the Governor, in an exciting
discussion. The first letter of the series was addressed by the
Judge-Advocate to Captain Campbell:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I understand by the Provost-Martial, who has just
been with me, that you imagined Mary Turner was in custody; I
have to acquaint you that Mary Turner is forthcoming at any time
she may be wanted, but that I myself have at present no thoughts
of calling on her, as I do not think, on mature consideration,
there would be sufficient proof to affect her, either as an
accessory in the late business, or for perjury at the trial.
However, if you are of a different opinion and wish to have her
tried, she may be brought before the Criminal Court that is to
assemble on Tuesday or Wednesday next. In such case, I should
wish to have timely notice of the charge to be exhibited against
her, and what witnesses are to be called to support it, that the
necessary steps may be taken.</blockquote>
<p>In the present day this would be considered a peculiar letter
for a judge to write to a juryman. It was evidently written in a
most obliging spirit. Collins was under the impression that
Campbell wished to prosecute the woman for reasons of his own,
and although the judge could not see any ground for a prosecution
himself, he was willing to oblige the would-be prosecutor by
indicting her at the next sitting of the Criminal Court, to be
held a few days afterwards. To appreciate the state of things
disclosed in this letter, we should have to imagine a case
occurring in the present day, in which a judge, acting also as a
Crown Prosecutor, having satisfied himself that there was no
foundation for a charge of perjury against a woman who had given
evidence at a recent trial before him, had notwithstanding
written a letter to a juryman offering to lay an information and
to have her tried before himself at the next sittings of his
Court&#8212;with his friend in the jury-box. If we imagine,
further, that such a letter had not only been written but
published in the newspapers, there would be no difficulty in
understanding the impression it would have made on the public
with respect to the administration of justice. It is quite clear
that the Mary Turner of 1789 was as much entitled to the
protection of the English laws as any Mary Turner of the present
day would be, in a similar case. But it is equally clear that, in
the eye of the law as administered by her judges, she was not
entitled to any more protection than might suit their own view of
the matter.</p>
<p>The Judge-Advocate's letter to Captain Campbell provoked a
very different sort of reply from that which he expected. So far
from reciprocating his kindly offer and expressing his grateful
sense of the judge's condescension, the captain lost his temper
and sent back a letter on the same day, as deliberately insulting
as he could make it:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>In answer to your letter of this day, I have to say
that I perfectly well remember, at the last Criminal Court held
in this island, when Mary Turner was ordered to withdraw from the
Court, she was by yourself ordered into the custody of the
Provost. I do not by this mean to say that it was entirely an act
of your own, for myself among others desired it might be so, as
we then appeared to be unanimously of opinion that she was a very
proper object to make an example of.<br>
<br>
When the Provost informed you this morning of my having desired
him to speak to you about the woman, he should have likewise
informed you that I had, immediately after the Court was
dissolved, and on my seeing the woman at liberty, desired him to
make my compliments to you, and to know from you whether he had
not misunderstood the orders you gave in Court&#8212;to take her.
into his custody&#8212;as I had myself been one of the members
who desired it; nor could I till this morning possibly account
for my not having been acquainted with your opinion.<br>
<br>
Having this morning, by accident, heard that a Criminal Court
would be assembled the beginning of next week, I judged it a
discharge of a part of my duty to the publick to know what was to
be done with Mary Turner, sensible that no power on this island
could liberate her till she had undergone a trial.<br>
<br>
I therefore sent for the Provost, who, to my great surprise, had
the assurance to tell me that he never delivered my message to
you, upon which I ordered him to go and do it without loss of
time.<br>
<br>
Now, sir, you have the cause of your being troubled with any
message from me this morning. How far such a message might
authorize you to call upon me as a prosecutor, I know not, nor
shall I at present comment upon it. One point you have certainly
gained by it, that you have effectually precluded Captain
Campbell from sitting as a member of any Criminal Court that it
may be necessary to assemble here, and of which you are a
part.<br>
<br>
As this business may undergo future investigation, I beg leave to
recommend it to you to keep copies of such letters as you may
choose to write upon the occasion, as I assure you I shall of
mine. I at the same time think it proper to inform, you that this
is the only letter you will receive upon this
subject.</blockquote>
<p>There was some ground for the indignation expressed in this
letter, but there was none for the display of so much bad temper.
The writer was justified in resenting the idea that he might be
called upon to undertake the responsibility of a prosecution, but
he should not have forgotten that he had placed himself in the
position he complained of by communicating with the judge in an
irregular manner. If he conceived it a part of his duty to the
public to ascertain what was to be done with Mary Turner, his
obvious course was to wait until the Criminal Court was
assembled, and then to make his inquiry in Court. His idea that
no power could liberate her until she had undergone a trial, was
a mistaken one; because it was quite competent for the judge who
had ordered her into custody to discharge her from it.</p>
<p>The peculiar tone of Campbell's letter can be understood when
we recollect the relations existing between him and Major Ross.
They were personal friends before they left England, and the
consciousness that he had the Commanding officer at his back is
apparent throughout his correspondence. Knowing that the avowal
of his determination not to sit again in the Criminal Court would
be made known to the Governor, and that he would consequently be
called upon for an explanation, he lost no time in taking up a
safe position. Two days after he had written to the
Judge-Advocate, he addressed Major Ross on the
subject:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As I have always understood that you are not in
possession of any power to compel the officers of the detachment
under your command to sit as members of the Criminal Court
established in this colony, contrary to their own inclinations, I
have to request that you will please to direct the adjutant, so
as that my name may not for the future appear in your orderly
book as a member of that Court, as I shall be extremely concerned
to be reduced to the very disagreeable necessity of objecting to
any order of yours, or any other my superior in command.<br>
<br>
I am sensible it may be said of me that I have hitherto
volunteered or acquiesced in being, in my turn, a member of that
Court, from my being likewise sensible that in the present
situation of. this colony, such power could not, with any degree
of propriety, be vested in any other hands but that of the navy
and army. I have farther to say, that I would still continue the
same line of conduct did I think it consistent with either my
character as a gentleman or my feelings as a man. You were,
yourself, an ear-witness of the message sent by me by the Provost
to the Judge-Advocate on the 25th instant, to which message I
very soon after received the enclosed (in my opinion) most
insulting letter. I had ever been taught to understand that the
person officiating in his character at such Courts, was the
person to carry on the prosecution. How far, or even, how it was
possible for him to construe my message into a belief that I was
become the prosecutor I know not, nor can I possibly imagine why
he should call upon me individually for that purpose, as in his
letter he certainly does, unless that he had some reason to
suppose me of a more sanguinary and persecuting spirit than any
other member of the Court, who wished the woman to be taken into
custody for her having (evidently to all then present) perjured
herself. The consequence of not using every possible means to
prevent so dangerous a crime from getting to a head among the
present inhabitants of this colony is too obvious to require any
farther remarks upon it, and I am convinced that the wish of
exerting every means in their power to prevent it, was the motive
of that Court for desiring the woman to be taken into
custody.<br>
<br>
With the Judge-Advocate's letter, I take the liberty of inclosing
for your perusal the copy of my answer to him, with the humble
request that you will please to communicate the whole to the
Governor, to the end that he may be convinced that I never had,
nor ever will have, a wish or desire of impeding the publick
service, and I have no doubt but that both him and you will do me
the justice to say that I have used every means to promote
it.<br>
<br>
As I have no copy of any of the papers now sent to you, I request
that you will please not to part with any of them unknown to me,
or without my consent.</blockquote>
<p>Campbell's remark with respect to the position of the
Judge-Advocate shows clearly how it was regarded in the colony at
that time. "I had ever been taught to understand that the person
officiating in his character at such Courts was the person to
carry on the prosecution." That was undoubtedly the case,
according to the practice in England; and the appearance of a
Judge-Advocate on the bench might well have occasioned surprise
to those who had seen a Court-martial sitting in the old country.
Familiar as Campbell and his brother officers were with the
practice there, they probably felt something more than surprise
when they saw the prosecutor actually installed as the judge; and
if his objection to take part in the proceedings of the Court had
been grounded on a protest against the violation of principle
involved in them, it would at least have been creditable to his
sense of justice. But there is nothing to show that his conduct
in the matter was influenced by any such consideration.</p>
<p>If the captain looked to his superior officer for support,
Collins also had a powerful friend to whom he could appeal in
time of trouble. The offensive language used by the former,
coupled with his flat refusal to sit again in the Criminal Court,
made such an impression on the judge that he wrote to Phillip on
the day the hostile letter reached him. He thought it as well to
lose no time in placing the Governor in possession of the facts
from his own point of view&#8212;especially as he foresaw that
Campbell's intimation with respect to his sitting in the Criminal
Court would be certain to set his excellency in motion. [Collins
to Phillip]:</p>
<blockquote>Having this day received a message from Captain
Campbell Inspecting Mary Turner, one of the evidences on the late
trial of the soldiers for robbing the store-house, I beg leave to
lay before your excellency the following particulars of that
affair:&#8212;<br>
<br>
It appearing to the members of the Court, as well as to myself,
on the examination of the said Mary Turner, that she had not
sworn the truth in giving her testimony, on her being told to
withdraw, the Provost-Martial was ordered to detain and keep her
apart from the other witnesses. The conviction and condemnation
of the six prisoners very shortly followed, and the Court
dissolved.<br>
<br>
On maturely weighing and considering the whole of Mary Turner's
depositions, and comparing it with those of the other witnesses,
since the trial, I was of opinion there was not sufficient proof
to affect her on an indictment for perjury; and as I have always
wished to avoid lightly grounding a prosecution against the
convicts, from the bad effect it might have&#8212;in pointing out
to them how far they might offend if they but withhold sufficient
proof&#8212;I had dropped, for the present, any thoughts of
calling on Mary Turner for trial; neither have I at any time
since then heard it was the opinion or wish of any member of that
Court to bring her to trial until this morning, when I was
informed by the Provost-Martial that Captain Campbell, one of the
members of the late Court, had enquired of him if she was in his
custody, and expressed some surprise and anger on being told that
she was not. As to this latter circumstance, I must observe to
your excellency that, having no place of confinement or custody
for female offenders, they have always been suffered to go at
large until wanted for trial.<br>
<br>
In consequence of the above message, I wrote to Captain Campbell
a letter, wherein I informed him "that I did not think myself
there was proof sufficient to bring her to trial, either for
perjury, or as an accessory; but, nevertheless, if he was of a
different opinion, and would let me know what charge should be
exhibited against her, and what witnesses could be brought to
support it, it should be done"; for as I did not myself know of
any proof sufficient to establish a charge against her, I was not
certain but Captain Campbell might be informed of some that I was
unacquainted with. I beg leave to trouble your excellency with a
copy of my letter, and of Captain Campbell's reply, which I
received this afternoon; and have now only to add that, though I
think the conviction of her being guilty of perjury may be dear
in the breast and opinion of every individual of the late Court,
yet still there is not sufficient proof of it to convict her in
the eye of the law; nevertheless, as Captain Campbell considers
her as a prisoner by order of the late Court, and thinks she
ought to be delivered by a due course of law, I propose to bring
her before the Court that is to assemble in the next week, and
try her on a charge of wilful and corrupt perjury at the late
trial.</blockquote>
<p>How lightly the sense of judicial responsibility weighed upon
Collins is apparent from the concluding sentence of his letter.
He repeats his opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to
justify a prosecution; but, nevertheless, because Captain
Campbell thought she ought to be prosecuted, he proposed to bring
her before the Court in the following week on a charge of wilful
and corrupt perjury. Such an intimation appears to imply that, as
he was prepared to waive his opinion so far, he would not object
to waive it at the trial. By bringing the prisoner before the
Court on an indictment drawn by himself, he would have given its
members to understand that in his opinion there was a case
against her; but if it had become known that the prosecution had
been instituted by him in deference to Captain Campbell's views,
in what sort of position would he have placed himself? The
excitement of the discussion seems to have blinded him to the
obvious interpretation of his act; for evidently he did not see
that it laid him open to a charge of trifling with the jury,
playing with the prisoner's life, and exhibiting a degree of
weakness in the discharge of his duty, both as a prosecutor and a
judge, which would render it difficult to place any confidence in
his administration of justice. There is no reason to doubt his
purity of intention; the case against him is that, not being
sufficiently mindful of the responsibility attaching to his
position, he weakly yielded his opinion at the first appearance
of pressure; forgetting that in such circumstances weakness
becomes iniquity.</p>
<p>A review of these proceedings gives rise to a suspicion that
the functions of judge and prosecutor may have been improperly
combined in the same person, through a misinterpretation of the
Act and the Letters Patent by which the Court was established. It
is clear that Collins looked upon it as part of his duty to act
as prosecutor, and there is no doubt that he acted as judge when
the Court sat. If, for instance, he had carried out his intention
to bring Mary Turner before the Court, he would have prepared the
charge and collected the evidence for the trial; and when the
trial came on he would have examined the witnesses and addressed
the Court, at the same time taking notes, arguing questions of
law and fact, and finally, passing sentence after conviction.
<a href="#note-385" name="noteref-385" id="noteref-385">{9}</a>
In addition to all that, he would have retired with the jury and
given his vote as one of them. A Court so constituted presents
such a violent contrast with an English Court of justice, that
one is tempted to ask whether it was really the intention of the
Legislature that law should be administered in that fashion. So
far as its express words are concerned, there is little or
nothing in the Act to show that the Judge-Advocate was intended
to perform any other duties than those which belonged to his
office in England. That the regimental or garrison Court-martial
was taken as the model of the Court is shewn by the persons
appointed to compose it; and it is a fair inference, therefore,
that it was intended to follow the usage of such Courts. <a href=
"#note-386" name="noteref-386" id="noteref-386">{10}</a></p>
<p>If, on the other hand, it was intended that the practice of
the Court-martial should not be followed as regards the functions
of the Judge-Advocate, but that a Court should be created of an
entirely novel character, it is reasonable to suppose that the
intention would have been more clearly expressed than it was. It
is difficult to believe that Parliament intended to introduce a
method of administering justice for which there was no precedent,
which had nothing to recommend it in the shape of convenience,
and which would naturally provoke suspicion as to its
impartiality. But whatever conclusion may be come to on this
point, the fact that no care was taken to prevent misconception
on the subject, is a singular instance of the negligent manner in
which the business was conducted. The Act and Letters Patent were
so worded as to bear the interpretation put upon them by Collins;
they were equally open to a very different construction. Putting
that question aside, something might have been done to make their
provisions known to the officers concerned before they left
England. As it was, two only of them had seen the Act before the
Fleet sailed. The others made their first acquaintance with it
when it was read out at the proclamation of the colony. The
Judge-Advocate being the only person in it holding a legal
appointment, every question of the kind was left in his hands;
and it is not surprising if, without any experience or training
to fit him for his task, he so interpreted the Act as to place
himself in the extraordinary position of a judge, a prosecutor,
and a juryman combined. <a href="#note-387" name="noteref-387"

A Court called the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature was
established in 1814, the first Judge of which was Jeffrey Hart
Bent, who arrived in that year, and was summarily removed by
Governor Macquarie two years afterwards. Bent's brother, Ellis,
came out as Judge-Advocate with that Governor in 1809, and died
in 1815. The last Judge-Advocate was John Wylde, who came out in
1816. He was appointed a temporary Judge of the Supreme Court in
1824, and left the colony in the following year.</p>

Description of New South Wales (1819), pp. 232-3. Wentworth gives
another illustration of the manner in which the criminal law was
administered in his time. The herd of wild cattle found at the
Cowpastures in 1795 had been left to increase, under the
impression that they would ultimately stock the country with
cattle. At the time Wentworth wrote, they had disappeared, and he
accounted for the fact by the "exterminating incursions of
numerous poor settlers who had farms in the neighbourhood", and
who supplied themselves with fresh meat by a raid on the
Cowpastures, in the fashion of Scott's Highland borderers. Every
possible effort was made to suppress this kind of robbery, but
without any success. For a long time it was thought beyond the
power of the Courts to hold the robbers in check; because
although the cattle were originally the property of the Crown,
they had subsequently become intermixed with cattle belonging to
private owners, the result being that it was impossible to
identify any particular animal. On trials for cattle stealing,
evidence of identification was required by the Judge-Advocate who
administered justice from 1809 to 1815, and without sufficient
evidence on that point, he would not convict; but his successor,
who held office from 1816 to 1824, dissented from his ruling on
that point, and would not be bound by it. Convictions then became
easy.&#8212;Ib., pp. 50-51.</p>

Judge-Advocate Wylde, speaking in 1824, described his position in
the following terms:&#8212;"The Judge-Advocate is only one of the
seven jurors who compose, and have committed to them as a Court
of Record, the whole jurisdiction as to law and fact, determining
both, it is known, by the opinions of a majority of its members.
The Judge-Advocate has in truth no especial or other power than
any other juror of the Court."</p>

Holt's report of the proceedings against him in the
Judge-Advocate's Court, in 1804, throws some light on the method
of conducting business in it.&#8212;Memoirs, vol. ii, pp.
206-216. The terror excited among the convict population by the
summary proceedings of the Criminal Court was so great that
several instances are recorded of suicide having been committed
in order to escape from the certain result of a trial. Thus
Collins relates (p. 25) that in April, 1788, "an elderly woman, a
convict, having been accused of stealing a flat-iron, and the
iron being found in her possession, the first moment she was left
alone she hung herself to the ridge-pole of her tent, but was
fortunately discovered and cut down before it was too
late"&#8212;? to try her. Those who did not take their own lives
generally fled to the bush, where they perished miserably, or
escaped death by starvation only by returning and giving
themselves up. Many of the wild attempts to escape by sea were no
doubt attributable to the same cause. The convicts in such cases
were probably habitual thieves, unable to restrain their
propensity for picking up other people's property, and frightened
out of their wits when they saw the Provost-Marshal. One man was
supposed to have been driven mad by fright; Collins, p. 80.</p>

"The Judge-Advocate is the judge or president of the Court; he
frames and exhibits the charge against the prisoner, has a vote
in the Court, and is sworn, like the members of it, well and
truly to try and to make true deliverance between the King and
the prisoner, and give a verdict according to the
evidence."&#8212;Collins, p. 11.</p>

Speaking of the regimental Court-martial, Tytler says (p.
177):&#8212;"The usual practice is to appoint a captain as
president and four subalterns."If Phillip had thought fit to
appoint a president whenever he convened the Court, there was
nothing in the Act to prevent him; and he might have reasonably
come to the conclusion that the usage of the Court-martial should
be followed as far as it was practicable. As a matter of fact, it
was followed in several points&#8212;as, for instance, (1) the
keeping of a roster by the adjutant; "it is customary in every
regiment for the adjutant to keep a regular roster for their
instruction in this as well as in all other regimental duties";
(2) the presence of the officers in Court in full uniform, and
(3) the order in which the votes were given&#8212;"the youngest
members of the Court being required to give his opinion first,
and the rest following in progressive seniority up to the
President, who votes last"; ib., p. 152; Tench, Narrative, p. 70.
These rules were adopted without any express instructions, and
they show that the Court was guided in its practice by the usage
of the Court-martial. It might also have been argued that the use
of the term Judge-Advocate in the Act, without any words of
definition as to his duties implied that it was intended to mean
in the colony what it meant in England; just as the word
Provost-Marshal was interpreted on the same principle.</p>

The constitution of the Criminal Court was strongly condemned in
the Report of a Committee of the House of Commons, published in
1812. Referring to the evidence given by the witnesses examined
on the subject&#8212;among whom were Governor Hunter and Governor
Bligh&#8212;the Report said:&#8212;"Your Committee have to
observe that all the evidence examined on the subject,
unequivocally condemns the manner in which the Criminal Courts
are thus established ... Your Committee are of opinion that the
manner of administering criminal justice may be altered with
great advantage to the colony. It is not to be expected that the
inhabitants should view, otherwise than with jealousy and
discontent, a system which resembles rather a Court-martial than
the mode of trial the advantages of which they have been
accustomed to see and to enjoy in their own country."</p>

<h3>2.4 THE CIVIL AND THE MILITARY <small>[1789]</small></h3>
<br>
<small>A MUCH</small> more serious question than the case of Mary
Turner presented itself to Phillip's eyes when he read the
correspondence between the Judge-Advocate and Captain Campbell.
The latter having distinctly declined to sit again in the
Criminal Court, and having also appealed to Major Ross as his
authority for the view he had taken of his duty in that matter,
it became necessary to settle the question at once. If the other
officers should follow his example, no Court could be held and
there would be no means of dealing with offenders. The course
taken by Phillip will be seen in the following passages of his
despatch to the Under Secretary of the Admiralty, dated 5th June,
enclosing copies of the correspondence for the perusal of their
lordships:&#8212;
<blockquote>After having pointed out the authority by which the
Criminal Court was established, how much it was the officers'
duty to sit as members of that Court when called on, and the
obvious necessity of it, I informed Major Ross, as I had done the
day I first heard of the business, that the Judge-Advocate had
declared in the most, solemn manner that he never had intended
any offence to Captain Campbell by his letter; and as I saw no
reason for that officers refusing what was most undoubtedly a
part of his duty, I desired that he would think seriously of the
consequences. The precept for assembling a Criminal Court was
ready to be issued as soon as the names of the officers were
inserted who were next for that duty, and if Captain Campbell
should persevere in refusing that duty, I desired to have his
reasons in writing.</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen from this statement that Phillip's first
effort was aimed at conciliation. He had seen Collins before
taking any step in the matter; and having learned that the
judge's letter was not intended to convey the offensive meaning
attributed to it by the captain, he informed Major Ross
accordingly, in order that his friend's sense of injury might be
removed. At the same time he was quite prepared to deal firmly
with him, and for that purpose requested to have a statement in
writing of his reasons for declining to sit. The Major then
undertook to see his friend, the result of their consultation
being another visit to the Governor:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Major Ross soon after brought me a letter, and as he
told me Captain Campbell was fixed in his opinion that the
sitting as a member of the Criminal Court was no part of his
duty, and which he therefore declined, I desired that the officer
next on the roster for that service might be named in his room;
but Major Ross said that he did not see how that could be done,
as he believed I should find the officers in general of opinion
that the sitting of members of the Criminal Court was not a duty
to which they were obliged to submit, but a service in which they
had volunteered, and added&#8212;"That he knew of no articles of
war to compel them."</blockquote>
<p>The letter brought by the Major was the one he had received
from Captain Campbell, and which he did not think fit to produce
at his first interview with Phillip. It raised the question
whether there was any power, outside the Commanding officer, to
compel officers of the detachment to sit as members of the
Criminal Court against their inclination. Here we get an insight
into the reasons of the Major's opposition. He objected to his
officers being ordered to do duty by any other hand than his own.
He had heard the Act of Parliament read, and consequently knew
that it authorised the Governor&#8212;or in his absence the
Lieutenant-Governor&#8212;to convene the Court from time to time;
but, nevertheless, he would not admit the force of it, and did
everything in his power to induce his men to resist the
Governor's exercise of authority over them. This interpretation
of his conduct is suggested by the opening lines of Campbell's
letter, which plainly imply that, if the officers should choose
to resist, the Major admitted that he could not compel them; and
if he could not, how could any one else? In his own words, he
knew of no article of war to compel them.</p>
<blockquote>I had been given to understand, soon after the
Commission for establishing the Criminal Court had been read,
that the officers thought it a very disagreeable duty, and that
it was looked on as an hardship by some, but I never had supposed
officers thought it a service which they were at liberty to
decline at their pleasure; and I observed to Major Ross that I
could hardly believe it possible that such an opinion was
general, but which would be known as soon as the precept for
assembling the Court should be issued.<br>
<br>
At the same time, being desirous to restore tranquillity if
possible, I consented to the demand then made by Major Ross, that
a Court of Inquiry might be ordered to give an opinion on the
Judge-Advocate's letter before the precept was issued; and after
having pointed out the consequences that must follow the officers
refusing what was so necessary a part of their duty, and which,
being declared such by an Act of Parliament require no articles
of war, or particular instructions to the Commandant of the
detachment, I assured him that while there were ten men in the
detachment, officers should not be wanting to form a Criminal
Court.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip could not have given a stronger proof of his desire to
restore tranquillity than he did when he consented to Major
Ross's demand, that a Court of Inquiry should be ordered to give
an opinion on the Judge-Advocate's letter. The idea of a Court of
any kind being ordered to give an opinion on a letter was so
absurd that he might well have dismissed it with very little
ceremony&#8212;especially after he had taken the trouble to
communicate the judge's assurance that he was innocent of any
intention to give offence. But to show that his concession on
that point was not weakness, he assured the Major that "while
there were ten men in the detachment, officers should not be
wanting to form a Criminal Court"; in other words, if there were
only ten men left among the marines, he would make six of them
officers and summon them to attend the Court. That was a hint
which there was no mistaking; it was plainly intended to mean
that the Governor would not allow himself to be thwarted in the
performance of his duty.</p>
<blockquote>The Court of Inquiry which was ordered to meet on the
Judge-Advocate's letter, to which Captain Campbell had taken
offence, having reported that they did not think themselves
competent to judge of the matter laid before them [as it was a
private disagreement, which appeared to involve in itself a point
of law], that Court was dissolved, and Major Ross came to inform
me that Captain Campbell would protest against the report, which
he said was a partial report in stating that the matter before
them was of a private nature, and desired that the request made
by the members of that Court for copies of the letters laid
before them might not be granted. Captain Campbell declined
afterwards making any protest against the proceedings of the
Court of Inquiry, and copies of the letters, which they thought
necessary in order to justify their proceedings to the Admiralty,
were given them.</blockquote>
<p>The decision of the Court of Inquiry was exactly what might
have been expected. The contention raised by Campbell as to the
duty of officers in relation to the Criminal Court was not
submitted to the Court of Inquiry; it was merely asked to
pronounce an opinion on the merits of a certain letter. It is not
easy to see what would have been gained even if the Court had
expressed an opinion on the subject, seeing that it could not
have touched the main question at issue. The pertinacity with
which Ross held on to the captain's quibble showed itself much
too plainly when he went to inform the Governor that "Captain
Campbell intended to protest against the report on the ground
that it was partial." The idea of a protest under such
circumstances was even more absurd than that of a Court solemnly
sitting to report on a letter. The Major does not seem to have
felt any scruple in showing that he looked upon Campbell's
quarrel as his own, since he did not object to become the bearer
of messages between him and the Governor.</p>
<blockquote>The adjutant of the detachment had my orders to give
the Judge-Advocate, as usual, the names of the officers who were
next for the duty of the Criminal Court, as soon as the Court of
Inquiry had made their report; but he then came to inform me that
Major Ross did not choose to let him give the names of the
officers at the Judge-Advocate's request; and desired that it
might appear in general orders, or that a verbal message might be
sent him from me. The message was sent, and in the names given to
the Judge-Advocate Captain Campbell's appeared, and he sat the
next day as a member of the Criminal Court.</blockquote>
<p>This was a flank movement of the Major's, intended to
humiliate the Judge-Advocate in the eyes of the Governor and the
detachment, by showing that his authority to collect the names
would not be recognised by the Commanding officer. Up to this
time it was the judge's duty to send to the adjutant for the
names, and on receiving them to prepare a precept for the
Governor's signature. It was not very consistent with the dignity
of his judicial office that he should be employed in summoning
the jurors to attend his Court; but the duty was imposed upon him
either because he was the only person on the establishment who
was supposed to have a knowledge of legal forms and proceedings,
or because he usually acted as secretary to the Governor; or
possibly for both those reasons. When the precept was signed and
sealed, it was handed to the Provost-Marshal, whose duty it was
to show it to the officers concerned a day or two before the date
fixed for the sitting of the Court; the names being also inserted
in the battalion orders of the day. The senior officers of the
navy were always called upon to serve, when any King's ship
happened to be at anchor in the harbour.</p>
<p>Still desirous of conciliating Ross and his friend as much as
possible, Phillip consented to this further exaction on his part,
although it involved a slight to the Judge-Advocate from which he
should have been protected. The message required by Ross was sent
from the Governor to him, but Campbell's name was inserted in the
list of officers called upon to serve; and when the Court sat on
the following day, he appeared and took his seat as quietly as if
nothing had happened. He was not prepared to try conclusions with
the Governor when it came to the point. There can be no doubt
that he knew his duty under the Act quite as well as any of his
brother officers; and that the position he took up on the matter
was a foregone conclusion between him and the Major. Phillip
explained his views on that point as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>As no legal inquiry into the conduct of any officer
could be made here, and as Captain Campbell was the only officer
who could be called on to sit as a member of the Criminal Court
who did not think it a part of his duty, I judged it best, for
the quiet of the settlement, to let him sit as a volunteer when
his name was returned.</blockquote>
<p>In order to satisfy himself as to the actual state of opinion
among the officers on the main question at issue&#8212;for up to
this point Phillip had nothing before him but Campbell's letter
and Rosses verbal statements&#8212;he determined to see some of
them personally on the subject.</p>
<blockquote>I had sent for several of the officers before the
Court met, in order to point out to them the consequences which
would follow their refusal of so essential a part of their duty;
and the officers I saw on that occasion assured me that they had
never doubted its being a part of their duty after they heard the
Act of Parliament and the Commission read which established that
Court. But Major Ross afterwards, on the 6th May, telling me that
he was still of opinion that many of the officers did not think
the sitting as members of the Criminal Court any part of their
duty, I desired that he would assemble the officers that their
separate opinions might be taken on that head.</blockquote>
<p>The Major was not prepared to give way even when he found that
the officers generally did not agree with him, and was
injudicious enough to put the matter to a final test by taking
their opinions formally in writing. Phillip sent special
instructions to him by the adjutant for this purpose, worded as
follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The Governor requests that Major Ross will assemble
the officers of the detachment now at head-quarters and report to
him their separate opinions, whether or not they think it their
duty to sit as members of the Criminal Court established in this
country. This the Governor desires as Major Ross, their
Commandant, is of opinion they do not think it a part of their
duty. Captain Campbell having already given his opinion, the
Governor does not wish to press him further on that
head.</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon&#8212;the date of this proceeding was the 6th
May&#8212;the Major assembled the officers and put the question
to them one by one:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Whether they look upon sitting at the Criminal Court
as a military duty or an extra duty in compliance with an Act of
Parliament, and whether they had any knowledge of it before their
arrival in this country?</blockquote>
<p>That was not the question which the Governor had desired to be
put. He wanted to know whether the officers considered it their
duty to sit; not whether they looked upon it as a military or an
extra duty&#8212;a point in which he was not in the least
concerned. Anticipating a defeat, the Major appears to have drawn
this distinction so that those officers whose consciences would
not allow them to take his view of the matter, might still have
the appearance of supporting him. If they answered the question
as he put it, they would say that they looked upon the Court
business as an extra duty, and he would then be able to raise
some further contention with Phillip.</p>
<p>Thirteen officers were present and recorded their answers; the
first on the list being Captain Tench, who expressed himself as
follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>I had no knowledge of the Act of Parliament previous
to my arrival in this country; from the moment I read it I looked
on it as Captain Tench's duty to sit on Criminal Courts whenever
ordered, and still look on it as such.</blockquote>
<p>The others answered to the same effect; all agreeing that
since they had heard the Act of Parliament read, they considered
it their duty to sit as members of the Criminal Court whenever
ordered. There were only two of them who had seen the Act in
England. None of them took any notice of the distinction put
before them in the question between "a military duty" and "an
extra duty in compliance with an Act of Parliament"&#8212;a
refinement to which its author apparently attached some
importance.</p>
<p>The result was, therefore, that the Major did not find a
single supporter among them&#8212;a fact which enables us to
understand the secret of Campbell's opposition. The matter was
too simple to admit of any doubt about it all; and if it was
clear to the subalterns, it may be inferred that it was equally
clear to the Captain and the Commandant.</p>
<p>So far as this question was concerned, there was no room left
for further discussion; but another and very different one, which
assumed the undignified appearance of a squabble, broke out
immediately afterwards. Some one was kind enough to report to
Phillip certain unguarded expressions with reference to his
conduct which had been made use of by Ross when addressing the
officers at the meeting. How this complication came about, and
what was done in consequence of it, was explained by Phillip in
his letter:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Being sometime after informed that the officers had
been assembled and the Governor's conduct in calling on Captain
Campbell to sit as a member of the Criminal Court had been stated
to them by Major Ross as oppressive, and that endeavours had been
used to induce them to join in Captain Campbell's opinion "that
the Criminal Court was not a part of their duty". I then thought
it necessary to enquire what grounds there were for such a
report; and the first officer I spoke to on the subject doubting
of the propriety of saying what passed at a meeting to which he
had been called by his Commandant, I directed the Judge-Advocate
to send for some of the senior officers then in quarters, and to
ask them the necessary questions, and the adjutant who had
assembled the officers and attended the meeting was afterwards
sent for.</blockquote>
<p>The course adopted by Phillip in this matter seems to show his
intention to deal with Ross as a quasi-delinquent. Instead of
sending him a formal request to assemble the officers and report
their separate answers to certain definite questions, as he did
before, he instructed the Judge-Advocate to draw up the
questions, and to send them in an official
communication&#8212;looking very much like "a lawyer's
letter"&#8212;addressed to five of the senior officers, who were
requested to meet him on the subject. This was done accordingly
on the 28th May:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It having been reported that the Major-Commandant of
the detachment, did in the presence of many of the officers,
declare that the Governor's calling on Captain James Campbell to
sit as a member of the Criminal Court, established by Act of
Parliament, for the trial of criminal causes in this country, was
oppressive; and that the said Major-Commandant did publickly
address the officers then present, in order to induce them to
concur with Captain Campbell in refusing to acknowledge the duty
of the Criminal Court to be any part of the officers duty; and to
persuade them to refuse sitting as members of the said Criminal
Court; I am, in consequence of the said report, desired by the
Governor to call upon such officers of the detachment who were
present at that meeting; and to put the following questions to
them; in order that it may be known how far the said report is
founded in truth.<br>
<br>
1. Was there such a meeting, and what reason was assigned by the
Major-Commandant of the detachment for assembling the
officers?<br>
<br>
2. Did the Major-Commandant at that meeting say that the
Governor's conduct in calling on Captain Campbell to sit in his
turn as a member of the Criminal Court was oppressive?<br>
<br>
3. Did he ask the officers to join Captain Campbell in refusing
to sit as a member of that Court, or what was said on that
subject?</blockquote>
<p>The answers sent in fixed the responsibility of the
objectionable language on the Major, beyond a doubt. The
statement sent in by Captain Tench may be taken as a specimen of
the whole:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>1. The meeting was held on Monday, the 27th of April,
by order of the Major-Commandant. The reason he assigned for such
meeting, was to repeat a conversation he had had with the
Governor, to lay before them a letter he had received on service
from Captain Campbell in consequence of a correspondence he had
had with the Judge-Advocate, and to read the letters which had
passed between them, all of which were read to the officers by
the adjutant.<br>
<br>
2. To the best of my recollection the Major-Commandant said he
had told the Governor that his conduct respecting Captain
Campbell was oppressive, and that officers were not to be driven
in cases where they did not feel themselves at ease to act; they
were not to be compelled.<br>
<br>
I recollect that the Major made use twice of the word
"oppressive" in speaking of the Governor's conduct.<br>
<br>
3. He did not ask the officers to join Captain Campbell in
refusing to sit as members of the Criminal Court&#8212;but it is
my opinion that the whole tenor of Major Ross's conversation
pointed that way. My reason for thinking so is, that Major Ross
more than once mentioned to the officers assembled that he had
told the Governor that both he, and the officers at large,
considered the sitting as members of the Criminal Court as what
they volunteered, not as a duty.</blockquote>
<p>As soon as the officers had left the Judge-Advocate, they went
straight to the Major and informed him of what had taken place.
His curiosity being naturally excited with respect to the
questions put, he wished to know what they were; but instead of
giving him the desired information, his friends referred him to
the Governor. It does not appear that he took any steps to
satisfy himself on the point; as Phillip said&#8212;"Major Ross
has never mentioned that business to me."</p>
<blockquote>The consequences that must have followed had the
officers in general been of their Commandant's opinion, will be
obvious to their lordships; but as no legal inquiry could be made
respecting the conduct of the officer to whom, as the
Lieutenant-Governor and Commandant of the detachment, I was
naturally to look for support, and from whom the situation of
this colony at the time called for an address of a very different
nature, I did not think it proper to direct any more officers to
be sent for on the subject, unless Major Ross should desire it,
when the officers informed him they had been examined respecting
that meeting; and which they did as soon as they left the Judge
Advocate, and being asked what questions had been put to them,
they desired to refer him to the Governor for the questions and
their answers, but Major Ross has never mentioned that business
to me, and I have therefore thought it best to let it rest in its
present state.</blockquote>
<p>This was the concluding paragraph of Phillip's despatch, which
may be taken as an illustration of his method of dealing with
matters requiring some diplomacy. While he had every right to
feel annoyed with the line of conduct adopted towards him by the
head of the military force, to whom, as he said, he had naturally
to look for support, he contented himself with quietly reporting
the proceedings to the Admiralty and the Home Office, leaving it
to the Government to dispose of the matter as it might think fit.
Dependent on the military, as he knew himself to be, he could not
safely have dealt with the Major as his temper would have
prompted him to do, and was consequently obliged to temporise and
make concessions, instead of resenting his aggressions at once.
But he contrived to have his own way in the end, notwithstanding;
and all through the struggle he appears to have made Ross feel
that he was determined to have it. This result could not have
been accomplished without considerable tact, patience, and
self-control; for if he had been as hot-headed and irascible as
his adversary, nothing could have prevented a violent collision
between them.</p>
<p>The extent to which official jealousy operated on Ross's mind
was shown in a much more ludicrous form shortly after the
termination of this discussion. On the 26th August, he addressed
the Governor in a formal letter respecting another grievance of
which he had to complain; and as it furnishes perhaps the best
specimen on record of his peculiar weaknesses, it deserves
attention. In the first three paragraphs, he unconsciously shows
us how inflated he was with the sense of his importance as
Lieutenant-Governor, and at the same time how sensitive to
anything that appeared at all likely to lessen it. His allusion
to "the west side of the cove" renders it necessary to explain
that as soon as the settlement had been formed, Phillip placed
that part of it under Ross's command, the main body of the
convicts being stationed there, while the opposite side of the
cove was under his own supervision; the detachment of marines
being camped at the head of it, between the two, and near the
stream.</p>
<blockquote>Your excellency's having so repeatedly told me that
the working convicts employed on the west side of the cove were
to be under the command and authority of the Lieut.-Governor, so
far that none of them should be removed from it by your
excellency without his knowledge, that it cannot have escaped
your memory.<br>
<br>
It would be presumption in the extreme in me to suppose your
excellency not to know that when either duty, business, or
pleasure may at any time induce your excellency to absent
yourself from this cove, there cannot then remain in it any
authority superior to that of the Lieut.-Governor.<br>
<br>
Taking, therefore, your perfect recollection of the first and
knowledge of the second for granted, I shall proceed to acquaint
your excellency with an account of what I cannot but deem an
insult offered to me in my character of Lieutenant-Governor since
your excellency went last from this place.</blockquote>
<p>The account of the "insult" which follows these introductory
flourishes contains a pitiful detail of camp gossip; but it shows
how trifles, light as air, may serve to inflame official jealousy
as readily as other forms of it. It also shows the plentiful lack
of wit, as well as occupation, which led the Major to pass so
much time in listening to tittle-tattle among the soldiers and
convicts&#8212;a habit which lay at the bottom of all the petty
disturbances in which he figured so prominently.</p>
<blockquote>About 12 o'clock yesterday, Fuller, the carpenter,
told me that [Thody] the convict plasterer had been with him to
tell him that he was informed of Bazely's having been looking for
him the day before in order to direct him to join Bloodsworth's
gang. Soon after, in my walks to visit the guard, I saw Bazely,
and asked him how Thody came by him to be ordered to join
Bloodsworth's gang. On his saying that it was the desire of Mr.
Brewer [the Provost-Marshal], I desired him to let Mr. Brewer
know that I wanted to see him, and that he would find me with the
officer of the guard. Mr. Brewer came soon after. I asked him how
Thody came to be ordered away from the works that he was employed
in on the west side. His answer was, indeed he did not know; but
that Mr. Collins had directed him to order Thody to join and work
with Bloodsworth's gang from that morning. I then desired Mr.
Brewer to go to Captain Collins, and tell him from me that I
wished to know how Thody came to be ordered away from the
officers' huts where he was at work. Captain Collins's answer, by
Mr. Brewer, was that he knew nothing more of it than that when
the Governor was going away he left such orders with
him.</blockquote>
<p>The gist of this rambling narrative is that the Governor had
insulted Major Ross because he had requested Captain Collins to
give certain instructions with reference to the employment of the
plasterer, instead of having communicated direct with the
Lieutenant-Governor. On this fact&#8212;which seemed to him "of
too serious a nature or tendency to pass over"&#8212;he proceeds
to comment in the most solemn manner.</p>
<blockquote>However much I felt myself hurt by this impropriety
of the manner in which the order came, I immediately determined
with myself to give way to it, so far as to cause the man to be
taken off from the officers' hut at which he had been at work,
and sent over to the other side, which was immediately done. But
I at the same time determined the business of too serious a
nature or tendency to pass over without making your excellency
acquainted with it; for however trivial it may at first view
appear, yet the nature of it, the quarter from whence it came,
your excellency's name having been made use of upon the occasion,
as well as the terms upon which I am too well known to stand with
you, render it absolutely necessary for me, in justice to my own
consequence and character, to request that your excellency will
please to direct me to be informed of the cause of such authority
being assumed by those in whom no such power can at present be
vested.<br>
<br>
But should your excellency say, and I cannot possibly bring
myself to think you will, that you on going away from here left
your orders relative to the employing convicts with the
Judge-Advocate, in place of leaving them with the
Lieutenant-Governor, I have in such case to request that you will
please to explain to me the line of conduct which, as
Lieutenant-Governor of this settlement, you wish me either to
preserve or follow, assuring yourself that I shall endeavour to
pursue that line, at least till such time as a power superior to
either of us shall determine the bounds of both and redress our
grievances. At present I acknowledge myself as much in the dark
with respect to the line of conduct you expect me to pursue as
Lieutenant-Governor, or what you expect from me or that I shall
do, as I was the first day of our meeting in London. But as this
may be a subject of future discussion, I shall conclude this with
my having the honour of being, &amp;c.</blockquote>
<p>It appears from the Major's reference to "the terms on which I
am too well known to stand with you", that something like an open
rupture had taken place at this time between him and
Phillip&#8212;the result, probably, of the discussion raised by
Campbell's letter. The camps on the east and west sides of the
cove were somewhat like those of hostile armies&#8212;one acting
strictly on the defensive, the other watching every opportunity
for attack, either by open fire or an occasional pot-shot. The
result was not doubtful, but every movement of the enemy makes us
feel how fortunate it was that Phillip contrived to keep cool
throughout the struggle.</p>
<p>On receiving the Major's letter, Phillip informed Collins of
its contents, and requested him to send his account of the matter
in an official letter to the Governor. The effect of it was that
he had received the instructions referred to on a Saturday, but
had forgotten to carry them out until the following
Monday&#8212;for which neglect he offered his apology. Ross was
replied to on the day after his communication was received, in a
letter which not only explained away the supposed insult, but
conveyed a much-needed hint on another matter.</p>
<blockquote>A few days before I went to Rose Hill, a list of all
the convicts and their various employments was made out by my
directions, and by which it appeared to me that James Thody was
unemployed. I, therefore, desired the Judge-Advocate to order him
to join the bricklayers then at work for some of the officers;
and last night on my return received your letter, stating that an
insult had been offered you, as Lieutenant-Governor, during my
absence, by the Judge-Advocate, in ordering a man employed under
your directions to a different work.<br>
<br>
I will, sir, repeat to you what the Judge-Advocate says on that
head, in his own words:&#8212;That he forgot to give the order
the day I desired he would; and when he did recollect it he gave
orders for that purpose; but on being told that the man was
employed by your directions at Lieutenant Kellow's hut, as he was
certain I did not know he had any work in hand when I gave the
order for his joining the bricklayers' "party."<br>
<br>
This, sir, if admitted, will, I presume, satisfy you that no
insult was intended. I had myself informed you that I was going
up the harbour for two or three days; and with respect to any
orders being left with the Judge-Advocate that should have been
left with the Lieutenant-Governor, there is not a shadow of
reason to suppose anything of the kind ever was intended, and of
which you must be sensible.<br>
<br>
And in answer to your question as to what line of conduct I wish
you to pursue, I have, sir, only to wish that the peace of the
settlement may not be disturbed; and that you will be so good as
to be a little more guarded in your expressions; for I am certain
that you will think on reflection that the answer you gave to the
convict, who came to tell you his time was expired,&#8212;"Would
to God my time was expired too!"&#8212;was not calculated to make
him satisfied with his situation, till the necessary information
is received from Government respecting those people, who draw
their own conclusions from what they hear, and perhaps very
different from what the words are intended to convey. I did not,
sir, take notice of the impropriety I saw in such a declaration,
when you told me that was the only answer you gave to the convict
(who was afterwards sentenced by the Criminal Court to a severe
punishment, which he most undoubtedly deserved), as several
officers were then present; but I repeat it, sir, that I am
certain you must see the impropriety of it.<br>
<br>
The time cannot be far distant when a legal inquiry can take
place, and all the complaints will then be attended to; till
when, his Majesty's service requires some little forbearance on
your part as well as on mine.</blockquote>
<p>The Major's inquiry as to "the line of conduct which, as
Lieutenant-Governor of this settlement, you wish me either to
preserve or follow", would have justified Phillip in a forcible
retort, had he been inclined to reply in that fashion. He might
have reminded Ross, for instance, of his very irregular conduct
in connection with the vacancy occasioned by the death of Captain
Shea, one of his officers. When that event occurred, he offered
the company to the Judge-Advocate, without even acquainting the
Governor with his intention to do so; although the position
occupied by Collins rendered such a proposal a matter of serious
moment to the head of the Government. The facts in this
case&#8212;much more important, by the way, than those which
formed the substance of Ross's complaint&#8212;were communicated
to Nepean by Phillip in a letter dated 2nd February.</p>
<blockquote>The present situation of this colony renders it
necessary to state the following particulars, and which you will
please to communicate to the Right Honorable the Lord Sydney.<br>
<br>
When on the death of Captain Shea, who died the 2nd of February,
'89, Major Ross, as Commandant of the detachment, came to inform
me of that event, I observed to him, that First Lieutenant George
Johnston, then doing duty as my Adjutant of Orders (and who was
then present), would, of course, succeed to the
Captain-Lieutenancy which then became vacant, as being the oldest
first lieutenant in the detachment, and that I should in future
do without an adjutant, as there were so few officers. No direct
answer was given by Major Ross, who left me, and sending for the
Judge-Advocate, offered him the company vacant by the death of
Captain Shea, telling him he was directed so to do by Lord Howe,
and that if he accepted the company, he was to give up the
appointment of Judge-Advocate to the detachment.</blockquote>
<p>It is not at all probable that Lord Howe had directed Ross to
offer the vacancy to the Judge-Advocate, for the simple reason
that the impropriety of such a step was manifest on the face of
it. But there can be no doubt as to the reasons which induced
Ross to make the offer. He knew that, if Collins had accepted it,
he would have been under the necessity of resigning the office of
Judge-Advocate; and as there was no means of filling up the
vacancy there and then, the Criminal Court would have ceased to
exist until another Judge-Advocate could be sent out from
England. There was nothing to prevent Collins from accepting the
offer, had he been disposed to do so; but fortunately he did not.
His refusal seems to furnish an explanation of Ross's conduct
towards him on the occasion already referred to&#8212;p. 414.
Phillip saw through this proceeding at once; and although he
probably had his doubts as to the Lord Howe story, he wrote on
the assumption that it was a genuine one.</p>
<blockquote>This offer being declined, any interference on my
part was unnecessary; but as a circumstance of this kind may
happen in future. I beg leave to observe, that if the
Judge-Advocate had accepted or the company, he must have given up
the appointment of Judge-Advocate to the settlement, for he could
not possibly have attended to that charge, supposing he had
always remained at head-quarters; but which could not have been
the case, for the captains relieve each other every three months
at Rose Hill; therefore, if officers who may be sent out in civil
employs are at liberty to resign the place they hold when any
vacancy happens in the detachment, the colony in its present
situation may lose an officer who is immediately necessary, and
who, as in the present instance, cannot be replaced; nor is there
any officer in this settlement so absolutely necessary as the
Judge-Advocate, who likewise acts as a Justice of Peace, and
which employs a very considerable part of his time.<br>
<br>
When this circumstance is laid before Lord Sydney, I doubt not
but his lordship will see that the civil government of this
colony may be very materially affected by directions of such a
nature being given to the Commandant of the detachment, and by
him carried into execution without the knowledge or consent of
the Governor, and which, I presume, never was intended by Lord
Howe. The first information I received of any such offer being
intended was from the Judge-Advocate saying that he would not
accept the offer.</blockquote>
<p>Having regard to the state of affairs in the settlement at
that time, Phillip had good reason to complain of such a
proceeding as this. The Judge-Advocate being an officer in the
Civil Service, any proposal for transferring him from the
position he occupied to another should have been submitted to the
Governor for his approval in the first instance. By making the
offer to Collins without any reference to the head of the
Government, Ross meant to show his determination not to consider
him in the matter.</p>
<blockquote>I was the next day told by Major Ross that he
intended to give commissions to the officers he promoted in
consequence of Captain Shea's death; and some days afterwards he
came to ask me if his giving his son a commission as a second
lieutenant would meet with my approbation. As Major Ross had not
even at that time mentioned his having offered the company to the
Judge-Advocate, or made any reference to me respecting the
filling up the vacancy, I desired he would excuse me from giving
any approbation to that appointment in particular. <a href=
"#note-388" name="noteref-388" id=
"noteref-388">{1}</a></blockquote>
<p>Since it is manifest that the little differences of opinion
which so often took place between Ross and Phillip are
attributable to the official jealousy displayed by the former, it
is a singular illustration of mistaken judgment that the weakness
in question should have been attributed by some historical
writers to Phillip, while Ross's share in the matter has been
altogether forgotten. In a volume published in London in 1817,
under the title of The History of New South Wales, the
writer&#8212;James O'Hara&#8212;concluded his account of
Phillip's administration with the following sketch of his
character, p. 143:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Phillip was a man of undeniable merit; at once
ardent and firm in the execution of his duty. His faults could
scarcely be called such; a quickness of temper, a disposition
more peremptory than is absolutely necessary in command, a too
punctilious jealousy of station, with manners founded upon these
qualities. But if that amenity was wanting which history has
sometimes delighted to paint in the character of her favourites,
he was not essentially harsh or severe. He scorned the display or
semblance of that benevolence of which he had such well-founded
claims to the reality.</blockquote>
<p>If "a too punctilious jealousy of station" formed a
distinguishing trait of his character, there is no proof of it in
the records of the time, either in the shape of official
correspondence or in the narratives of his contemporaries. The
only evidence of the kind consists of the statements made by Ross
in his letters to Nepean, which do not deserve any serious
attention.</p>
<p>The consciousness of his power was, no doubt, the mainspring
of the extravagant conduct pursued by the Major. He was placed in
the position he occupied for the purpose of supporting the
Governor; but, as things stood, the Governor was placed so
helplessly in his power that, instead of obtaining support, he
met with nothing but opposition. That was one of the many vices
which marked the form of government framed by Sydney, the
consequences of which made themselves felt with increasing force
from year to year, until they culminated in a revolution. When
the news of the discontent reached England, and the Government at
last was made aware of the position into which the civil and
military forces had drifted, it was determined to recall the
marines, and send out a force specially raised for the service.
By that means, it was thought, the evil complained of would be
absolutely eradicated, and any future conflict of the kind
rendered impossible. The result was quite the reverse, and
naturally so; because the source of the evil was left untouched.
The Government did not understand the real position of affairs in
the least, and instead of applying a remedy, it aggravated and
inflamed the disease. It ought to have been manifest from the
first that the Governor of such a colony should be invested with
absolute instead of merely nominal power; and that nothing could
be more dangerous than to invest one officer with the shadow of
power while leaving the substance in the hands of another. The
difficulty might have been obviated by the simple precaution of
issuing peremptory instructions from the Admiralty to the
marines, before they left England, of such a nature as to remove
all doubt from their minds with respect to their subordination to
the Governor. An alternative course presented itself in the
appointment of the Cominanding officer to that position; but
although such a plan would have prevented any conflict between
the civil and military branches of the establishment, it would
have resulted in different and perhaps more serious
complications.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>In this, as in other instances, may be seen how naturally and
inevitably the most unexpected consequences flow from mistakes in
matters of government. Looking at it in the light of subsequent
experience&#8212;"the stern lights of the ship"&#8212;the train
of evils which marked the first years of the settlement seems but
the necessary result of the unfortunate circumstances which
marked its foundation. The struggle for predominance which began
so soon between the heads of the civil and the military
departments would probably have taken place, whoever might have
been in charge of them; because it was mainly attributable to the
fact that the proper subordination of the military power to the
Executive had not been provided for in the first instance. Under
such circumstances, it is but fair to say that Major Ross's
errors of judgment were to some extent the result of the position
in which he found himself; and that although a man possessed of
great self-restraint and desire to promote the public interests
might have avoided the unseemly disputes with the Governor in
which he indulged, yet according to the ordinary working of human
nature they were perfectly natural if not unavoidable events. On
the same principle, the still more painful phenomena which made
their appearance in other directions may be accounted for by
tracing them to their fountain heads in the defective
organisation of the community; just as we may trace the river
system of the country by following each of its broad streams to
its source among the mountains. The omission to provide for the
moral and religious training of the people by the appointment of
overseers, teachers, and ministers of religion in sufficient
number, led to consequences of which Phillip made frequent
complaint; but no statement that he made on the subject affords
more than a faint indication of the real extent of the mischief.
The imagination of the reader must fill up the picture with the
too familiar details of vice and crime rampant among a people
deliberately kept in ignorance of any higher law than that
administered by the gaoler and the judge. In the same way, the
equally fatal omission to provide competent instructors in
agriculture and other necessary arts, entailed upon the unhappy
population all the miseries of a state of siege; while the
neglect to establish some form of government for the natives led
in after years to a state of warfare between the two races,
terminating in the extinction of the savage one. And it is not
less true that the fundamental mistake of founding the colony
with convicts instead of free settlers brought about a series of
troubles and disasters, which frequently imperilled its existence
and at all times paralysed its energies; until the lapse of time
and the introduction of healthier elements enabled it gradually
to outgrow, and at last absorb, the fruitful source of corruption
and decay. <a href="#note-389" name="noteref-389" id=

The practical results of this system of colonisation may be
better understood by comparing it with the plan adopted by
Congress in 1787 for the settlement of unoccupied territory. An
Ordinance passed in that year established the following
principles of government:&#8212;<br>
<br>
1. So soon as there should be five thousand free male inhabitants
of full age in the district, they should receive authority to
elect representatives to represent them in a General
Assembly.<br>
<br>
2. The General Assembly should consist of a Governor, a
Legislative Council, and a House of Representatives.<br>
<br>
3. The inhabitants should always be entitled to the benefits of
the writ of habeas corpus and of the trial by jury; of a
proportionate representation of the people in the Legislature,
and of judicial proceedings according to the course of the common
law.<br>
<br>
4. Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good
government, schools and the means of education should be for ever
encouraged.<br>
<br>
5. The utmost good faith should always be observed towards the
Indians: their lands and property should never be taken from them
without their consent; and in their property, rights, and
liberty, they should never be invaded or disturbed, unless in
just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in
justice and humanity should, from time to time, be made for
preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace
and friendship with them.<br>
<br>
6. There should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in
the territory, otherwise than in the punishment of
crimes.&#8212;Story, Exposition of the Constitution; Roebuck, The
Colonies of England, 1849, p. 91.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="ch-28" id="ch-28"></a>3.1 JAMES MARIA MATRA'S
PROPOSAL. <small>[1783]</small></h3>
<p class="blok" align="center">A Proposal for Establishing a
Settlement in New South Wales.</p>
<blockquote><small>I AM</small> going to offer an object to the
consideration of our Government which may in time atone for the
loss of our American colonies.<br>
<br>
By the discoveries and enterprise of our officers, many new
countries have been found which know no sovereign, and that hold
out the most enticing allurements to European adventurers. None
are more inviting than New South Wales.<br>
<br>
Captain Cook first coasted and surveyed the eastern side of that
fine country from the 38th degree of south latitude down to the
10th, where he found everything to induce him to give the most
favourable account of it. In this immense tract of more than two
thousand miles there was every variety of soil, and great parts
of it were extremely fertile, peopled only by a few black
inhabitants, who, in the rudest state of society, knew no other
arts than such as were necessary to their mere animal existence,
and which was almost entirely sustained by catching fish.<br>
<br>
The climate and soil are so happily adapted to produce every
various and valuable production of Europe and of both the Indies,
that with good management and a few settlers, in twenty or thirty
years they might cause a revolution in the whole system of
European commerce, and secure to England a monopoly of some part
of it, and a very large share in the whole.<br>
<br>
Part of it lies in a climate parallel to the Spice Islands, and
is fitted for the production of that valuable commodity, as well
as the sugar-cane, tea, coffee, silk, cotton, indigo, tobacco,
and the other articles of commerce that have been so advantageous
to the maritime powers of Europe.<br>
<br>
I must not omit the mention of a very important article which may
be obtained in any quantity, if this settlement be made, the
proper use of which would be of very considerable consequence,
both among the necessaries and conveniences of life. I mean the
New Zealand hemp or flax plant, an object equally of curiosity
and utility. By proper operating it would serve the various
purposes of hemp, flax, and silk, and it is more easily
manufactured than any one of them. In naval equipment it would be
of the greatest importance. A cable of the circumference of ten
inches would be equal in strength to one of eighteen inches made
of European hemp. Our manufacturers are of opinion that canvas
made of it would be superior in strength and beauty to any canvas
of our own country. The threads or fragments of this plant are
formed by nature with the most exquisite delicacy, and they may
be so minutely divided as to be small enough to make the finest
cambric. In colour and gloss it resembles silk. After my true,
though imperfect, description of this plant, I need not enlarge
on it as a very singular acquisition both to the arts of
convenience and luxury.<br>
<br>
This country may afford an asylum to those unfortunate American
loyalists, whom Great Britain is bound by every tie of honor and
gratitude to protect and support, where they may repair their
broken fortunes and again enjoy their former domestic
felicity.<br>
<br>
That the Government may run no risk, nor be left to act in a
business of this kind without sufficient information, it is
proposed that one ship of the peace establishment (to incur the
least possible expense) be directly sent to that country for the
discovery and allotment of a proper district for the intended
settlement; that one or two gentlemen of capacity and knowledge,
as well in soil and situation as in every other requisite, be
sent in her, that there may be no imposition on the Government,
nor upon the Americans who, with their families, shall adventure
there.<br>
<br>
If the Government be disposed to extend this plan, two vessels
may be sent with two companies of marines, selected from among
such of that corps as best understand husbandry or manufactures
and about twenty artificers, who are all the emigration required
from the parent State; these last to be chiefly such as are taken
on board ships-of-war for carpenters and armourers' crews, with a
few potters and gardeners.<br>
<br>
These twenty men and the marines, under a proper person, to be
left at the new settlement with materials and provisions, to
prepare for the reception of the intended settlers, that their
wants may be as few as possible on their arrival.<br>
<br>
As the ship or ships stop at the Cape of Good Hope, a sufficient
stock, to begin with, of cows, sheep, goats, hogs, poultry, and
seeds may be obtained there. A supply of the like articles, as
well as cotton seeds, plantains, grapes, grain, &amp;c., may be
had in any quantity at Savu or any of the Moluccas, which are
very near New South Wales.<br>
<br>
When the landing is effected, the smaller vessels may be
despatched home with the intelligence, and while the party
designed to be left are superintending the gardens and increase
of live stock, the other ship may, if thought proper, be
despatched to New Caledonia, Otaheite, and the neighbouring
islands, to procure a few families thence, and as many women as
may serve for the men left behind. There is every reason to
believe they may be obtained without difficulty. If but one
vessel goes, the party with their stock may be left without
apprehension of danger from the natives.<br>
<br>
Sir Joseph Banks is of opinion that we may draw any number of
useful inhabitants from China, agreeably to an invariable custom
of the Dutch in forming or recruiting their Eastern
settlements.<br>
<br>
As it is intended not to involve the Government in either a great
or useless expense (for the settlement is designed to increase
the wealth of the parent country, as well as for the emolument of
the adventurers), a sum not exceeding &#163;3,000 will be more
than adequate to the whole expense to Government. Most of the
tools, saws, axes, &amp;c., &amp;c., for the use of the party
left may be drawn from the ordnance and other public stores,
where, at present, they are useless; and the vessels also, being
part of the peace establishment, neither can nor ought to be
fairly reckoned in the expenditure.<br>
<br>
That the Ministry may be convinced that this is not a vain, idle
scheme, taken up without due attention and consideration, they
may be assured that the matter has been seriously considered by
some of the most intelligent and candid Americans, who all agree
that, under the patronage and protection of Government, it offers
the most favourable prospects that have yet occurred to better
the fortunes and to promote the happiness of their fellow
sufferers and countrymen.<br>
<br>
Sir Joseph Banks highly approves of the settlement, and is very
ready to give his opinion of it either to his Majesty's Ministry
or others, whenever they may please to require it.<br>
<br>
Should this settlement be made, we may enter into a commerce that
would render our trade to China, hitherto extremely against us,
very favourable. The Aleutian and Foxes Islands, situated between
Asia and America, which abound with the choicest furs, lie nearly
north of New South Wales. It is from these islands the Russians
get the most and best of their furs, with which they carry on a
very lucrative trade by land with the Chinese. Our ships that
sailed under the command of Captains Cook and Clerke stopped at
some of them, and the skins which they procured then sold in
China at 400 hard dollars each, though for the few they brought
home of the same quality they only received about &#163;10 each.
As our situation in New South Wales would enable us to carry on
this trade with the utmost facility, we should be no longer under
the necessity of sending such immense quantities of silver for
the different articles we import from the Chinese Empire.<br>
<br>
There is also a prospect of considerably extending our woollen
trade. We know that large quantities of woollen cloth are
smuggled to Japan by the Russians, which, as it is taken by land
carriage from St. Petersburgh to Kamschatka, and then to the
islands by a very precarious navigation in boats, must be
extremely dear. The Japanese, however, go in their junks to the
islands and purchase great quantities of it.<br>
<br>
The peninsula of Korea, a kingdom tributary to the Chinese, and
unvisited by Europeans, has its supply at second-hand from the
Japanese. No ship has ever attempted this commerce, excepting
once or twice that the Spaniards ventured thither from their
American dominions, but as the inhabitants of Now Spain are but
indifferent navigators for the high, cold latitudes, they could
not oftener repeat the enterprize.<br>
<br>
It may be seen by Captain Cook's Voyage that New Zealand is
covered with timber of size and every quality that indicates
duration; it grows close to the water's edge, and may be easily
obtained; would it not be worth while, for such as may be
despatched to New South Wales, to take in some of this timber on
their return for the use of the King's yards? As the two
countries are within a fortnight's run of each other, and as we
might be of the utmost service to the New Zealanders, I think it
highly probable that this plan might become eminently useful to
us, as a naval power especially, as we might thus procure masts,
a single tree of which would be large enough for a first-rate
ship, and planks superior to any that Europe possesses.<br>
<br>
By the Preliminary Articles of Peace with Holland we are entitled
to a free navigation of the Molucca Seas. Without a settlement in
the neighbourhood the concession is useless, for the Dutch have
an agent almost on every island in those seas. If we have a
settlement it is unnecessary; for as spices are the only articles
we could expect by it, it is probable we should stand in no need
of their indulgence; for as part of New South Wales lies in the
same latitude with the Moluccas, and is even very close to them,
there is every reason to suppose that what nature has so
bountifully bestowed on the small islands may also be found on
the larger. But if, contrary to analogy, it should not be so, the
object is easily supplied, for as the seeds are procured without
difficulty, any quantity may speedily be cultivated.<br>
<br>
To those who are alarmed at the idea of weakening the Mother
Country by Opening a channel for emigration, I must answer that
it is more profitable that a part of our countrymen should go to
a new abode where they may be useful to us, than to the American
States. If we cannot keep our subjects at home, it is sound
policy to point out a road by following of which they may add to
the national strength.<br>
<br>
The place which New South Wales holds on our globe might give it
a very commanding influence in the policy of Europe, If a colony
from Britain was established in that large tract of country, and
if we were at war with Holland or Spain, we might very powerfully
annoy either State from our new settlement. We might, with a safe
and expeditious voyage, make naval incursions on Java and the
other Dutch settlements, and we might with equal facility invade
the coasts of Spanish America, and intercept the Manilla ships
laden with the treasures of the West. This check which New South
Wales would be in time of war on both those Powers, makes it a
very important object when we view it in the chart of the world
with a political eye.<br>
<br>
Sir Joseph Banks's high approbation of the scheme which I have
here proposed deserves the most respectful attention of every
sensible, liberal, and spirited individual amongst his
countrymen. The language of encomium applied to this gentleman
would surely be inequitably censured as the language of
adulation. To spurn the alluring pleasures which fortune procures
in a frivolous and luxurious age, and to encounter extreme
difficulties and dangers in pursuit of discoveries which are of
great benefit to mankind, is a very complicated and illustrious
event, as useful as it is rare, and which calls for the warmest
public gratitude and esteem.<br>
<br>
I shall take this opportunity to make a remark on colonisation
which has not occurred to me in any author, and which I flatter
myself will contain some important civil and political truth.<br>
<br>
Too great a diminution of inhabitants of the mother country is
commonly apprehended from voluntary emigration, an apprehension
which seems to me not to be the result of mature reflection. That
we almost universally have a strong affection for our native soil
is an observation as true as it is old&#8212;it is founded on the
affections of human nature. Not only a Swiss, but even an
Icelander, when he is abroad, sickens and languishes in his
absence from his native country; therefore few of any country
will ever think of settling in any foreign part of the world,
from a restless mind and from romantic views. A man's affairs are
generally in a very distressed, in a very desperate, situation,
when he resolves to take a long adieu of his native soil, and of
connections which must be always dear to him. Hence a body of
emigrants&#8212;nay, a numerous body of emigrants&#8212;may, in a
commercial view, be of great and permanent service to their
parent community in some remote part of the world, who, if they
continue at home, will probably live to see their own ruin, and
will be very prejudicial to society. The politician of an
expanded mind reasons from the almost invariable actions of human
nature; the doctrine of the petty statesman is hardly applicable
to a larger extent than that of his own closet. When our
circumstances are adverse in the extreme, they very often produce
illegal and rapacious conduct. If a poor man of broken fortunes
and of any pretensions be timid in his nature, he most probably
becomes a useless, if he has an ardent spirit, he becomes a bad
and a criminal, citizen. There are indeed some epochs in a State
when emigrations from it may be too numerous; but then, from some
calamitous and urgent publick cause, it must be unworthy of
inhabitants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When I conversed with Lord Sydney on this subject, it
was observed that New South Wales would be a very proper region
for the reception of criminals condemned to transportation. I
believe that it will be found that in this idea good policy and
humanity are united.<br>
<br>
It will here be very pertinent to my purpose to give an extract
from the report of the committee appointed to consider the
several returns relative to gaols.<br>
<br>
1st Resolution: That the plan of establishing a colony or
colonies in some distant part of the globe, and in newly
discovered countries where the climate is healthy, and where the
means of support are obtainable, is equally agreeable to the
dictates of humanity and sound policy, and might prove in the
result advantageous to navigation and commerce.<br>
<br>
2nd Resolution: That it is the opinion of this committee that it
might be of public utility if the laws which now direct and
authorise the transportation of certain convicts to his Majesty's
colonies and plantations in North America, were made to authorise
the same to any part of the globe that may be found
expedient.<br>
<br>
Seven hundred and forty-six convicts were sent to Africa from the
year 1775 to 1776. The concise account of them given into the
committee exhibits an alarming expenditure of human life: three
hundred and thirty-four died, two hundred and seventy-one
deserted to no one knows where, and of the remainder no account
could be given. Governor O'Hara, who had resided in Africa many
years, was of opinion that British convicts could not for any
time exist in that climate.<br>
<br>
The estimate of the expense given in by Mr. Roberts, necessary to
establish a settlement there to receive them, amounted to
&#163;9,865; afterwards the annual charge to the public for each
convict would be about &#163;15 4s. Government pays annually to
the contractor, for each convict who is employed in the hulks,
&#163;26 15s. 10d. The annual work of each man is valued at a
third of the expense.<br>
<br>
I am informed that in some years more than a thousand felons are
convicted, many of whom are under eighteen years of age. The
charge to the public for these convicts has been increasing for
the last seven or eight years, and I believe now amounts to more
than &#163;20,000 per annum.<br>
<br>
When the convicts were sent to America, they were sold for a
servitude of seven years. A proposal has been made for the
alteration of this mode respecting those sent to Africa, by
condemning them to some public work there. They were to be
released from servitude, and some ground was to be given them to
cultivate, in proportion as a reformation was observed in their
conduct.<br>
<br>
Neither of those plans can I approve.<br>
<br>
Give them a few acres of ground as soon as they arrive in New
South Wales, in absolute property, with what assistance they may
want to till them. Let it be here remarked that they cannot fly
from the country; that they have no temptation to theft; and they
must work or starve. I likewise suppose that they are not by any
means to be reproached for their former conduct. If these
premises be granted me, I may reasonably conclude that it is
highly probable they will be useful; that it is very possible
they will be moral subjects of society.<br>
<br>
Do you wish either by private prudence or civil policy to reclaim
offenders? Show by your treatment of them that you think their
reformation extremely practicable, and do not hold out every
moment before their eyes the hideous mortifying deformity of
their own vices and crimes. A man's intimate and hourly
acquaintance with his guilt, of the frowns and severity of the
world, tend more powerfully, even than the immediate effects of
his bad habits, to make him a determined and incorrigible
villain.<br>
<br>
By the plan which I have now proposed, a necessity to continue in
the place of his destination, and to be industrious, is imposed
on the criminal. The expense to the nation is absolutely
imperceptible comparatively with what criminals have hitherto
cost Government; and thus two objects of most desireable and
beautiful union will be permanently blended; economy to the
public, and humanity to the individual.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-29" id="ch-29"></a>3.2 SIR GEORGE YOUNG'S
PROPOSAL. <small>[1785]</small></h3>
<br>
<blockquote>The following is a rough outline of the many
advantages that may result to this nation from a settlement made
on the coast of New South Wales:&#8212;<br>
<br>
<small>ITS</small> great extent and relative situation with
respect to the eastern and southern parts of the globe is a
material consideration. Botany Bay, or its vicinity, the part
that is proposed to be first settled, is not more than one
thousand six hundred leagues from Lima or Baldivia, with a fair
open navigation, and there is no doubt but that a lucrative trade
would soon be opened with the Creole Spaniards for English
manufactures. Or suppose we were again involved with a war with
Spain; here are ports of shelter and refreshment for our ships,
should it be necessary to send any into the South Sea.<br>
<br>
From the coast of China it lies not more than about one thousand
leagues, and nearly the same distance from the East Indies, from
the Spice Islands about seven hundred leagues, and near a month's
run from the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>
The variety of climates included between the 44th and the 10th
degrees of latitude gives us an opportunity for uniting in one
territory almost all the productions of the known world. To
explain this more fully, I will point out some of the countries
which are situated within the same extent of latitude, on either
side of the Equator: they are China, Japan, Siam, India, Persia.
Arabia Felix, Egypt, Greece, all Turkey, the Mediterranean sea,
Italy, Spain, South of France and Portugal, with Mexico, Lima.
Baldivia, and the greatest part of the Pacific Ocean, to which
may be added the Cape of Good Hope, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
From this review it will, I think, be acknowledged that a
territory so happily situated must be superior to all others for
establishing a very extensive commerce, and of consequence
greatly increase our shipping and number of seamen. Nor is it
mere presumption to say the country is everywhere capable of
producing all kinds of spice, likewise the fine Oriental cotton,
indigo, coffee. tobacco, with every species of the sugar-cane;
also tea, silk, and madder. That very remarkable plant known by
the name of the New Zealand flax plant may be cultivated in every
part, and in any quantity our demands may require. Its uses are
more extensive than any vegetable hitherto known, for in its
gross state it far exceeds anything of the kind for cordage and
canvas, and may be obtained at a so much cheaper rate than those
materials we at present get from Russia, who may, perhaps, at
some future period, think it her interest to prohibit our trade
for such articles, and the difficulties that must arise in such a
case are too obvious to mention, but are everywhere provided
against in this proposal.<br>
<br>
With but a trifling expense and a little industry we may, in the
course of a few years, establish a commercial mart on one island
comprehending all the articles of trade in itself, and every
necessary for shipping, not to mention the great probability of
finding such as an immense country metals of every kind.<br>
<br>
At a time when men are alarmed at every idea of emigration, I
wish not to add to their fears by any attempt to depopulate the
parent State; the settlers of New South Wales are principally to
be collected from the Friendly Islands and China; all the people
required from England are only a few that are possessed of the
useful arts, and those comprised among the crews of the ships
sent out on that service.<br>
<br>
The American loyalists would here find a fertile, healthy soil
far preferable to their own, and well worthy their industry,
where, with a very small part of the expense the Crown must
necessarily be at for their support, they may be established more
comfortably, and with a greater prospect of success, than in any
other place hitherto pointed out for them.<br>
<br>
The very heavy expense Government is annually put to for
transporting and otherwise punishing the felons, together with
the facility of their return, are evils long and much lamented.
Here is an asylum open that will considerably reduce the first,
and for ever prevent the latter.<br>
<br>
Upon the most liberal calculation, the expense of this plan
cannot exceed &#163;3,000, for it must be allowed that
ships-of-war are as cheaply fed and paid in the South Seas as in
the British Channel.<br>
<br>
Had I the command of this expedition. I should require a
ship-of-war&#8212;say the old Rainbow, now at Woolwich, formerly
a ship of forty guns&#8212;as the best constructed for the
purpose of any in the navy, with only half her lower-deck guns,
and two hundred and fifty men, one hundred of which should be
marines: a store-ship, likewise, of about six hundred tons
burthen, with forty seamen and ten marines; and a small vessel of
about one hundred tons, of the brig or schooner kind, with twenty
men, both fitted as ships-of-war, and commanded by proper
officers.<br>
<br>
The large ship is necessary for receiving fifty of the felons,
provisions, and stores, with a variety of live stock and plants
from England and the Cape of Good Hope. She is more particularly
wanted as a guard-ship to remain in the country at least two
years after her arrival, or longer, as may be found necessary, to
protect the settlers, &amp;c. The store-ship is required for
taking an additional quantity of provisions to serve until we are
about to raise some for ourselves; the brig or schooner is
principally wanted to explore the coast on our arrival: for,
notwithstanding a convenient place is already mentioned for the
purpose, nature and experience inform me a navigable river maybe
found on such an extensive coast, which, when discovered, she may
be then despatched to England with an account of our proceedings.
In the meantime the store-ship may be sent to the Friendly
Islands for inhabitants and useful plants.<br>
<br>
The settlement being thus established, any difficulties that may
arise from the great distance of New South Wales are obviated in
the manner following:&#8212;The China ships belonging to the East
India Company, after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, and keeping
more to the southward than usual, may land the felons on the
coast, and then proceed to the northward round New Ireland,
&amp;c.; or through Saint George's Channel, and so on to the
Island Formosa for Canton. With a little geographical and
nautical investigation, this passage will be found more short,
easy, and a safer navigation than the general route of the China
ships from Madras through the Straits of Malacca.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the number of the felons after the present are disposed
of may not require more than two ships in the course of a year.
The expense, therefore, attending the transporting of them by
this method must certainly be much less than by any others
whatever, without even the most distant probability of their
return. Every ship may take any number of felons not exceeding
seventy.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-30" id="ch-30"></a>3.3 HEADS OF A PLAN
<small>[1786]</small></h3>
<br>
<blockquote>For effectually disposing of convicts, and rendering
their transportation reciprocally beneficial both to themselves
and to the State, by the establishment of a colony in New South
Wales, a country which, by the fertility and salubrity of the
climate, connected with the remoteness of its situation (from
whence it is hardly possible for persons to return without
permission), seems peculiarly adapted to answer the views of
Government with respect to the providing a remedy for the evils
likely to result from the late alarming and numerous increase of
felons in this country, and more particularly in the
metropolis.<br>
<br>
It is proposed that a ship-of-war of a proper class, with a part
of her guns mounted, and a sufficient number of men on board for
her navigation, and a tender of about two hundred tons burthen,
commanded by discreet officers, should be got ready as soon as
ships possible to serve as an escort to the convict ships, and
for other purposes hereinafter mentioned.<br>
<br>
That, in addition to their crews, they should take on board two
companies of marines, to form a military establishment on shore,
not only for the protection of the settlement, if required,
against the natives, but for the preservation of good order,
together with an assortment of stores, and utensils and
implements necessary for erecting habitations and for
agriculture; and such quantities of provisions as may be proper
for the use of the crews.<br>
<br>
As many of the marines as possible should be artificers, such as
carpenters, surveyors, smiths, potters, if possible, and some
husbandmen. To have a chaplain on board, with a surgeon and one
mate at least, the former to remain at the settlement.<br>
<br>
That these vessels should touch at the Cape of Good Hope, or any
other places that may be convenient, for any seed that may be
requisite to be taken from thence, and for such live stock as
they can possibly contain, which it is supposed can be procured
there without any sort of difficulty, and at the most reasonable
rates, for the use of the settlement at large.<br>
<br>
That Government should immediately provide a certain number of
ships of a proper burthen to receive on board at least seven or
eight hundred convicts, and that one of them should be properly
fitted for the accommodation of the women, to prevent their
intercourse with the men.<br>
<br>
That these ships should take on board as much provisions as they
can possibly stow, or at least a sufficient quantity for two
years' consumption, supposing one year's to be issued at whole
allowance, and the other year's provisions at half-allowance,
which will last two years longer; by which time it is presumed
that the colony, with the live stock and grain which may be
raised by a common industry on the part of the new settlers, will
be fully sufficient for their maintenance and support.<br>
<br>
That, in addition to the crews of the ships appointed to contain
the convicts, a company of marines should be divided between
them, to be employed as guards for preventing ill consequences
that might arise from dissatisfaction amongst the convicts, and
for the protection of the crews in the navigation of the ships
from insults that might be offered by the convicts.<br>
<br>
That each of the ships should have on board at least two
surgeons' mates to attend to the wants of the sick, and should be
supplied with a proper assortment of medicine and instruments,
and that two of them should remain with the settlement.<br>
<br>
After the arrival of the ships which are intended to convey the
convicts, the ship-of-war and tender may be employed in obtaining
live stock from the Cape, or from the Molucca Islands, a
sufficient quantity of which may be brought from either of those
places to the new settlement, in two or three trips; or the
tender, if it should be thought most advisable, may be employed
in conveying to the new settlement a further number of women from
the Friendly Islands, New Caledonia, &amp;c., which are
contiguous thereto, and from whence any number may be procured
without difficulty; and without a sufficient proportion of that
sex it is well known that it would be impossible to preserve the
settlement from gross irregularities and disorders.<br>
<br>
The whole regulation and management of the settlement should be
committed to the care of a discreet officer, and provision should
be made in all cases, both civil and military, by special
instructions under the Great Seal, or otherwise, as may be
thought proper.<br>
<br>
Upon the whole, it may be observed with great force and truth,
that the difference of expense (whatever method of carrying the
convicts thither may be adopted) between this mode of disposing
of them, and that of the usual ineffectual one, is too trivial to
be a consideration with Government, at least in comparison with
the great object to be obtained by it, especially now the evil is
increased to such an alarming degree, from the inadequacy of all
other expedients that have hitherto been tried or suggested.<br>
<br>
It may not be amiss to remark in favour of this plan that
considerable advantage will arise from the cultivation of the New
Zealand hemp or flax plant in the new intended settlement, the
supply of which would be of great consequence to us as a naval
power, as our manufacturers are of opinion that canvas made of it
would be superior in strength and beauty to any canvas made of
the European material, and that a cable of the circumference of
ten inches, made from the former, would be superior in strength
to one of eighteen inches made of the latter. The threads or
filaments of this New Zealand plant are formed by nature with the
most exquisite delicacy, and may be so minutely divided as to be
manufactured into the finest linens.<br>
<br>
Most of the Asiatic productions may also, without doubt, be
cultivated in the new settlement, and in a few years may render
our recourse to our European neighbours for those productions
unnecessary.<br>
<br>
It may also be proper to attend to the possibility of procuring
from New Zealand any quantity of mast and ship timber for the use
of our fleet in India, as the distance between the two countries
is not greater than between Great Britain and America. It grows
close to the water's edge, is of size and quality superior to any
hitherto known, and may be obtained without
difficulty.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-31" id="ch-31"></a>3.4 LORD SYDNEY'S LETTERS.
<small>[August, 1786]</small></h3>
<br>
<p>Two letters written by Lord Sydney, Secretary of State for the
Home Department, one to the Lords of the Treasury dated 18th
August, 1786, and the other to the Lords of the Admiralty dated
31st August in that year, contained instructions for the supply
and equipment of the ships required for the expedition to Botany
Bay. The letter to the Treasury began with the paragraphs quoted
in the text, page 22, and then continued as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>In order that a proper degree of subordination and
regularity may be preserved in this new settlement, his Majesty
has been pleased to give orders that an officer and proper
assistants shall be appointed to superintend it, and that three
companies of the Marine Corps shall be stationed there so long as
it may be found necessary. The officers and marines will be
embarked on board a ship-of-war and a tender, which the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty have been directed to provide for
this service, the commanders of which will be instructed to take
under their protection the ships on board of which the convicts
may be embarked, and to regulate their sailing to the place of
destination.<br>
<br>
The crews of the ship-of-war and the tender, as well as the
Marine Corps, will be victualled by the Naval Department during
their passage; but your lordships will please to take notice that
the marines are to be provided for after their landing, and
supplies of provisions, as well as implements for agriculture,
should also be procured for their use. The number may amount to
about one hundred and eighty, to which is to be added the staff
establishment, consisting of fifteen, and perhaps two hundred
females, which your lordships will see by a sketch of the plan
for forming this new settlement, herewith transmitted, are likely
to be procured from places in its neighbourhood, as companions
for the men.<br>
<br>
If the person who may contract for the passage of the convicts
should be desirous of obtaining military assistance for their
greater security, they may be accommodated with a part of the
marines, who would otherwise be conveyed to the new settlement in
the ship-of-war and the tender.<br>
<br>
According to the best opinions that can be obtained, it is
supposed that a quantity of provisions, equal to two years'
consumption should be provided, which must be issued from time to
time according to the direction of the superintendent, in the
expenditure of which he will of course be guided by the
proportion of food which the country and the labour of the new
settlers may produce.<br>
<br>
From the length of the passage to New South Wales, the commanding
officer will most likely find it necessary to call at the Cape de
Verd Islands, as well as at the Cape of Good Hope, for the
purpose of recruiting the water. At the latter of these places he
will in all probability be enabled to obtain cattle and hogs, as
well as seed grain, all of which must be procured for the new
settlers with a view to their future subsistence; and as expenses
will thereby of course be increased, it will be necessary that
your lordships should authorise the naval commander or the
superintendent to draw upon you for the amount, and that, in
addition thereto, a quantity of merchandise should be put on
board the ship-of-war or the tender previous to their sailing,
sufficient to obtain supplies of live stock by means of barter
with the inhabitants of the islands contiguous to the new
intended settlement, from whence such supplies may at all times
be obtained.<br>
<br>
A small quantity of garden seeds should be sent out from hence,
together with some seed grain, to prevent inconveniences that
might happen should any difficulties arise in procuring a supply,
particularly of the latter, at the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>
The tools for erecting habitations and implements for
agriculture, which it is supposed will be most useful in the
settlement, are specified in the list accompanying this, and with
which it will be proper to supply the marines and the convicts
after their landing at the settlement. It is therefore his
Majesty's further pleasure that these articles be also provided
and sent out, together with bedding for each of the convicts, and
a proportion of cloathing agreeably to the estimate enclosed. The
marines will be supplied with bedding from the ship-of-war.<br>
<br>
I have it in command from his Majesty only further to acquaint
your lordships, that a quantity of surgical instruments and
medicines and necessaries for the sick will likewise be wanted,
and as soon as an estimate can be formed it shall be transmitted
to your lordships, together with the staff establishment.<br>
<br>
In the meantime I have only to recommend it to your lordships to
cause every possible expedition to be used in preparing the
shipping for the reception of the said convicts, and for
transporting the supplies of provisions and necessaries for their
use to the place of their destination.</blockquote>
<p>The letter to the Admiralty was as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The King having been pleased to signify his royal
commands that seven hundred and fifty of the convicts, now in
this kingdom under sentence of transportation, should be sent to
Botany Bay, on the coast of New South Wales, in the latitude of
33&#176; south, at which place it is intended that the said
convicts should form a settlement, and that the Lords of the
Treasury should forthwith provide a sufficient number of vessels
for their conveyance thither, together with provisions and other
supplies for their subsistence, as well as tools to enable them
to erect habitations and also implements for agriculture; and it
being his Majesty's intention that a ship-of-war of a proper
class, with part of her guns only on board, commanded by an able
and discreet officer, and a sufficient establishment of inferior
officers and men, together with a vessel of about two hundred
tons burthen, commanded also by an officer, should as soon as the
convict ships are ready proceed with them to the new settlement
for the purpose of regulating their sailing, and for the
preservation of peace and good order during the passage, as well
as for other purposes after their arrival:<br>
<br>
I am commanded to signify to your lordships the King's pleasure
that you do forthwith cause a ship-of-war and a tender for those
services to be fitted for sea with all possible expedition; and
when the said convicts shall be put on board the ships which are
preparing for their reception in the river Thames, to instruct
the commander of the ship-of-war to take the convict ships under
his protection, and proceed with them and the tender (which he
will employ as he shall find occasion) to Botany Bay, calling off
Plymouth on his way thither for another convict ship, the master
of which will be directed to join the convoy from thence, upon
its appearance.<br>
<br>
From the length of the voyage to New South Wales the convoy will
of course find it necessary to put into port on their way thither
for the purpose of recruiting their water. Your lordships will
therefore give instructions accordingly, only taking care that
one of the places to be fixed upon for a rendezvous may be the
Cape of Good Hope, from whence it is intended that as many
supplies as possible for the new settlement shall be
procured.<br>
<br>
As it has been thought advisable that some military establishment
shall be made at the new intended settlement, not only to enforce
due subordination and obedience, but for the defence of the
settlement against incursions of the natives, and as, from the
nature of the service to be performed, it is highly expedient
that it should be composed of men accustomed to and under proper
discipline, his Majesty has been pleased to direct that one
hundred and sixty private marines, with a suitable number of
officers and non-commissioned officers, shall proceed in the
ship-of-war and the tender to the new settlement, where it is
intended they shall be disembarked for the purposes before
mentioned. They will be properly victualled by a commissary
immediately after their landing, and provision has also been made
for supplying them with such tools, implements, and utensils, as
they may have occasion for, to render their situation comfortable
during their continuance at the new intended settlement, which it
is designed shall not exceed a period of three years.<br>
<br>
When these circumstances are known, it is very probable that many
of the non-commissioned officers and men may express a desire of
embarking upon this expedition. If the whole number to be
employed upon it were to consist of persons of that description,
it would, upon many accounts, be advisable to give them a
preference. It is therefore his Majesty's pleasure that their
wishes in this respect should, as much as possible, be attended
to; and that your lordships should, if there should be occasion,
hold out such farther indulgences to them as may induce them to
embark voluntarily upon this service, either by bounty or promise
of discharge, should they desire it upon their return; or, at the
expiration of three years, to be computed from the time of their
landing at the new intended settlement, should they prefer
remaining in that country.<br>
<br>
I enclose to your lordships herewith the heads of a plan upon
which the new settlement is to be formed for your further
information, together with the proposed establishment for its
regulation and government; and as soon as I am acquainted by your
lordships with the names of the officers intended to command the
ship-of-war and the marine corps, I shall receive his Majesty's
further pleasure for preparing their commissions and such
instructions as may be requisite for their guidance.<br>
<br>
From the nature of the services they are to execute under these
instructions, entirely unconnected with maritime affairs, it
would be proper that they should be immediately subordinate to
the direction of this office, and upon that ground it is his
Majesty's pleasure that they should be directed, after their
arrival at New South Wales, to follow such orders and directions
as they may receive from his Majesty, through his Principal
Secretary of State for this Department.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-32" id="ch-32"></a>3.5 PORTUGUESE CONVICTS.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"<small>THESE</small> were not the only colonists.
Portugal had taken possession, of Brazil, and meant to maintain
it. It was the system of the Portuguese Government to make its
criminals of some use to the State, a wise system if wisely
regulated: in that kingdom it obviously arose from the smallness
of its territory and lack of population to support its extensive
plans of ambition. Hitherto they had been degraded to the African
frontier, and more recently to India also. In these situations
they certainly served the State, yet the service was not without
heavy disadvantages. The usual offences which were thus punished
were those of blood and violence, and the ferocious propensities
which led to the commission of those crimes were not likely to be
corrected by placing the offenders in situations where they might
indulge them with impunity, and consider the indulgence as
meritorious. This system was immediately extended to Brazil; the
first Europeans who were left ashore there were two convicts. In
Africa, as in India, the exile was sent to bear arms with his
countrymen, who would not regard him as disgraced, because they
were obliged to associate with him. To be degraded to Brazil was
a heavier punishment; the chance of war would not enrich him
there, and there was no possibility of returning home with honour
for any signal service. They were in one point of view better
disposed of, inasmuch as in now colonies ordinary men are of
greater value than they can be elsewhere, but they became worse
subjects. 'Always has this plague persecuted Brazil and the other
conquests of this kingdom', says Balthazar Tellez. Their numbers
bore a greater proportion to the better settlers, and they were
therefore more likely to be encouraged in iniquity than reformed
by example&#8212;to communicate evil than to learn
good"</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-33" id="ch-33"></a>3.6 THE DEPOPULATION
THEORY.</h3>
<br>
<p>"<small>AT</small> a time when men are alarmed at every idea
of emigration, I wish not to add to their fears by any attempt to
depopulate the parent State." This remarkable passage&#8212;which
appears in Sir George Young's Proposal for a Settlement on the
coast of New South Wales,&#8212;throws a striking light on the
history of the times. The great wars in which England had been
engaged for so many years previously, and the prospect of still
greater wars in which the country might be involved at any time,
probably gave rise to the alarm excited in the public mind by any
proposal for free emigration; the prevalent ideas being that
every able-bodied man who went out to settle in a new country was
a direct loss to the State, and that the drain on its population
entailed by the establishment of a colony might prove a serious
public danger in the event of war.<br>
<br>
The state of public opinion on this subject in 1785 may be better
Population appreciated by a glance at the population tables of
the principal European States for the years 1800 and 1880:&#8212;

<br>
<p>The depopulation theory dates from a very early period in
English history. Sir Josiah Child, in his New Discourse of Trade.
published in 1668, argued strongly against it, contending that
colonies do not depopulate the mother country. Adam Smith, whose
Wealth of Nations was published in 1776, mentioned in his chapter
on Population that "it was long a prevalent opinion that the
emigration to the New World had depopulated Spain, and it was
also suspected that it had diminished the population of England.
There is not, however," he added, "the least ground for any such
opinion or conjecture."<br>
<br>
But the opinions of these and other philosophers did not remove
the popular prejudice on the subject. That it had active vitality
even in the present century, may be seen from a book published in
London in 1830, under the title of The Friend of Australia, in
which the author, a retired East India Company's officer,
advocated a systematic exploration of this country. Alluding to
the prevalent objections to sending out emigrants to the
colonies, he said:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">It is also a most egregious mistake for anyone
to say that we should be parting with and sending out of the
country the mainspring of our strength&#8212;our youth&#8212;who
are to defend us in case of war. I wish to know what difference
the thousands who have already left Great Britain have made in
the great bulk of the population? None. Where are they
missed?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most forcible illustration of the current doctrine
on this subject during the last century will be found in
Callander's collection of voyages, <a href="#note-391" name=
"noteref-391" id="noteref-391">{2}</a> published in 1766 under
the title, Terra Australis Cognita. This work was nothing more
than a free translation, without acknowledgment, of the
<i>Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Australes</i>, by the
President, Charles de Brosses. In an introductory chapter "of the
utility of further discoveries", Callander, adapting the
Frenchman's argument, says:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">Nobody now pretends to call in question that a
State must augment her power and wealth by extending the several
branches of her commerce by the means of colonies, provided this
can be performed without depopulating too much the mother
country. The task may be difficult to determine what part of the
people of Britain can be spared for new establishments in distant
regions. It is, I believe, generally admitted that this island is
able to nourish a larger number of people than we actually have.
Now the real riches of a State consist in the number of her
subjects.</p>
<p>After enumerating the commercial advantages to be derived from
"sending out well-regulated colonies", Callander proceeds to
point out another advantage of a different kind:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">These are the useful articles that flow from
exporting our people to colonies abroad; but there are others
that may be found in some sense necessary; such as that of
sending annually abroad certain people who only hurt society at
home . . . . The proper use of banishment is to send the criminal
from the country he has infested into another, where, by its
dependence on the mother country, his labour may become useful to
the State.</p>
<p>Dalrymple also, in the introduction to his Collection of
Voyages in the South Pacific Ocean, published in 1770, refers to
the prejudice against emigration:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">An objection has been made to colonisation from
an opinion that it draws away subjects from the mother country to
the colonies; whereby the former is weakened, and the latter, by
an idea of their own increasing power, encouraged to struggle for
independence.</p>
<p>Another illustration of the singular delusion referred to may
be seen in the preface to The History of New Holland, published
in 1787, just before the departure of the First Fleet. Referring
to the expedition, the writer says:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">When it is considered as an experiment (for the
disposal of convicts), the objections of those who exclaim
against founding a colony upon the infamous assemblage of exiled
felons will fall to the ground. Supposing that Government had
chosen to embrace the single purpose of forming a settlement at
Botany Bay, they would be justly censurable in inviting the
industrious and reputable artisan to exchange his own happy soil
for the possession of territory, however extensive, in a part of
the world as yet so little known. But criminals, when their lives
or liberties are forfeited to justice, become a forlorn hope, and
have always been judged a fit subject of hazardous experiments to
which it would be unjust to expose the more valuable members of a
State. If there be any terrors in the prospect before the wretch
who is banished to New South Wales, they are no more than he
expects; if the dangers of a foreign climate, or the
improbability of returning to this country, be considered as
nearly equivalent to death, the devoted convict naturally
reflects that his crimes have drawn on this punishment, and that
offended justice, in consigning him to the inhospitable shore of
New Holland, does not mean thereby to seat him for his life on a
bed of roses.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-34" id="ch-34"></a>3.7 HISTORY OF TRANSPORTATION
TO 1787.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>BANISHMENT</small> from the King's dominions was a
recognised mode of punishment from the earliest times, especially
for political offences. A reference to it occurs in Shakespeare's
Richard II, act i, scene 3, when the King, after having stopped
the fight between Bolingbroke and Norfolk, addressed them as
follows:&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore we banish you our
territories:&#8212;<br>
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,<br>
Till twice five summers have enriched our fields,<br>
Shall not re-greet our fair dominions.<br>
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.<br>
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="poem">The hopeless word of&#8212;never to return.<br>
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</p>
<p>But this method of punishing political offenders was checked
by Magna Charta, which declared that no freeman should be
outlawed or exiled but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the
law of the land. <a href="#note-392" name="noteref-392" id=
"noteref-392">{1}</a></p>
<p>Some of the most conspicuous instances of banishment by Act of
Parliament in modern times are&#8212;</p>
<p class="list">The Earl of Clarendon&#8212;19 Car. II, c. 10
(1679).<br>
Sir Thomas Sandys&#8212;22 &amp; 23 Car. II, a 1 (1682).<br>
Francis, Lord Bishop of Rochester&#8212;9 Geo. I, c. 17
(1723).</p>
<p>The first Act of Parliament by which banishment from the realm
was recognised as a method of punishing offenders was passed in
1597, <a href="#note-393" name="noteref-393" id=
"noteref-393">{2}</a> for the purpose of dealing with the
"rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars" who formed one of the
great social troubles of the Tudor times. It enacted that
"dangerous rogues, and such as will not be reformed of their
roguish course of life, may lawfully, by the Justices in their
Quarter Sessions, be banished out of the realm and all other the
dominions thereof, into such parts beyond the seas as shall be
for that purpose assigned by the Privy Council; or otherwise be
adjudged perpetually to the gallies of this realm." By the same
statute every rogue so banished and returning without license was
made guilty of felony, but within the benefit of clergy. <a href=
"#note-394" name="noteref-394" id="noteref-394">{3}</a> And for
the better indemnifying the nation against such rogues so
returning, it was also enacted that prior to their banishment
they should be "thoroughly burned upon the left shoulder with a
hot burning-iron of the breadth of an English shilling, with a
great Roman R upon the iron, for a perpetual mark upon such rogue
during his or her life."</p>
<p>But although this statute of Elizabeth was the first by which
banishment from the realm&#8212;afterwards known as
transportation&#8212;was formally recognised as an appropriate
punishment for offenders against the laws, the origin of the
system must be sought for in much earlier times than the
sixteenth century. It will be found, in fact, in the ancient
custom by which men who fled from justice or retribution to the
sanctuary were allowed to abjure the realm&#8212;in other words,
to transport themselves to any part of the outside world they
pleased. They were required to make oath before the coroner, in
the church to which they had fled, that they would quit the realm
on a given day; a cross was thereupon given to them to ensure
their protection on their journey to the coast; but if they
failed to present themselves at the place and on the day
appointed for their embarkation, they forfeited the privileges
they had obtained. The privilege of sanctuary was taken away by
an Act passed in the reign of James I, and abjuration of the
realm consequently ceased.</p>
<p>The first recorded public documents authorising the
transportation of convicts, and specially designating their
destination, are three Orders in Council, dated January, 1614,
July, 1615, and March 20, 1617, respectively. These orders
directed certain criminals to be delivered to the Governor of the
East India Company, to be transported to the East Indies.</p>
<p>The first recorded instance of transportation to a colony
appears in a letter addressed by James the First in 1619 to the
Treasurer and the Council of the Colony of Virginia, directing
them to "send a hundred dissolute persons to Virginia, whom the
Knight Marshal should deliver to them for that purpose."</p>
<p>The word "transport" appeared for the first time in an Act of
Parliament passed in 1666, for "preventing of theft and rapine
upon the northern borders of England." <a href="#note-395" name=
"noteref-395" id="noteref-395">{4}</a> The moss-troopers of that
time gave as much trouble to the Lords of the Marches as the
sturdy beggars gave to the Justices of the Peace in earlier days.
The Act in question declared that the "great, known, and
notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland and
Cumberland", on conviction for theft done or committed in those
counties, should be excluded from the benefit of
clergy&#8212;that is, should be tried and dealt with in the usual
way; but as that would have meant capital punishment on
conviction, it was mercifully provided that the Justices of
Assize, before whom they were convicted, might cause them to be
"transported into any of his Majesty's dominions in America,
there to remain, and not to return."</p>
<p>By far the most remarkable Act on this subject was passed in
1718, <a href="#note-396" name="noteref-396" id=
"noteref-396">{5}</a> authorising transportation to the colonies
and plantations in America. It proposed a means for supplying the
demand for labour there, as well as for ridding the mother
country of its dangerous classes. Previous to the passing of this
Act, transportation to the West Indies, on a voluntary basis, was
one means of disposing of them; but having proved ineffectual,
the Act of 1718 was passed for the purpose of authorising their
compulsory removal to America. The Act also introduced the
machinery by which the system of transportation was afterwards
worked, as long as it continued in existence. The language of
this statute throws a good deal of light, not only on the history
of transportation, but on the social condition of the time.</p>
<p>The preamble recites that whereas it had been found by
experience that the punishment inflicted by the laws then in
force against robbery, larceny, and other offences of the kind,
had not proved effectual to deter wicked and evil-disposed
persons from being guilty of such crimes; and whereas many
offenders, to whom royal mercy had been extended upon condition
of transporting themselves to the West Indies, had often
neglected to perform that condition and had returned to their
former wickedness, and been at last for new crimes brought to a
shameful and ignominious death:</p>
<p>And whereas in many of his Majesty's colonies and plantations
in America there was great want of servants, who by their labour
and industry might be the means of improving and making them more
useful to the nation:</p>
<p>It was therefore enacted that where any persons had been
convicted of any offence within the benefit of clergy, and were
"liable to be whipt or burnt in the hand"; <a href="#note-397"
name="noteref-397" id="noteref-397">{6}</a> and also where any
persons might thereafter be convicted of fraud or petit larceny,
&amp;c., and would be entitled to the benefit of clergy, and
"liable only to the penalties of burning in the hand or whipping"
(except receivers and buyers of stolen goods), the Court before
whom they were convicted might, instead of ordering them to be
burnt in the hand or whipt, order that they should "be sent, as
soon as conveniently might be, to some of his Majesty's colonies
and plantations in America for the space of seven years:"</p>
<p>And the Court should have power to "convey, transfer, and make
over such offenders to the use of any persons contracting for
their transportation to them and their assigns for the term of
seven years:"</p>
<p>It was further provided that where any persons had been
convicted of offences for which death ought by law to be
inflicted, or where any persons should thereafter be convicted of
any crimes for which they would by law be excluded the benefit of
clergy, and his Majesty should be pleased to extend royal mercy
to them, "upon the condition of transportation to any part of
America", the Court might allow such offenders the benefit of a
pardon under the Great Seal, and order the like transfer and
conveyance of such offenders, and also of receivers and buyers of
stolen goods, to any persons who should contract for the due
performance of the transportation and their assigns, for the term
of fourteen years, "in case such conditions of transportation
were general, or else for such term as should be made part of
such conditions, if any particular time should be specified by
his Majesty."</p>
<p>To carry out the intention of these singular provisions, it
was further enacted that the persons so contracting, and their
assigns, should have "a property and interest in the service of
such offenders for such terms of years." The effect of this was
that the convicts became the property of the
contractors&#8212;that is, the ship-owners who undertook to
transport them&#8212;for the term of their respective sentences;
and as there was no restriction upon the mode of dealing with
this property, the contractors adopted the only practicable means
of turning it to account by selling the convicts, as soon as they
were landed on the shores of Virginia or Maryland. Every convict
sent to America under this system was sold like a slave, the only
essential difference between the two being that the one was sold
for life, and the other for a term of years. The profits made by
the ship-owners on the sale of these cargoes paid the expense of
transporting them; the British Government by that means saving
the expenditure which otherwise it would have had to incur for
the purpose. At the same time it relieved itself from all
responsibility with respect to the treatment of the convicts
during the passage and after their arrival at the port of
destination. <a href="#note-398" name="noteref-398" id=
"noteref-398">{7}</a></p>
<p>The next section of the Act contains an open recognition of
this right of property in the convict, the master or employer
being described as "the owner or proprietor." It enacted that any
offenders ordered to be transported, who should return before the
expiration of their term, should be liable to suffer death:
Provided that his Majesty might pardon and dispense with any such
transportation, and allow of the return of any such offenders
from America, "they paying their owner or proprietor, at the time
of such pardon, dispensation or allowance, such sum of money as
should be adjudged reasonable by any two Justices of the Peace
residing within the province where such owner dwells."</p>
<p>The contractors were to give security for the transportation
of the convicts, and to procure certificates from the Governor,
or Chief, or Custom-house Officer in the colony, of their having
been duly landed.</p>
<p>On the cessation of transportation to the American colonies,
the gaols became so crowded with prisoners that active measures
became necessary for the purpose of preventing the evils with
which society was threatened. The condition of the gaols and the
sufferings of their inmates formed one of the great public
questions in English politics during the last quarter of the
eighteenth century. Howard's investigations on this subject
extended over the years 1773-4-5, and his evidence before the
House of Commons at that time led to several amendments of the
existing law; but it took at least twenty years of continuous
agitation to bring about the desired change for the better.
During that period the state of the gaols, which threatened the
community with outbreaks of pestilence as well as escapes of
prisoners, formed a subject of the gravest importance, and the
public interest in it seems to have reached its climax at the
time when the projected expedition to Botany Bay was under
consideration. <a href="#note-399" name="noteref-399" id=
"noteref-399">{8}</a></p>
<p>One of the first measures adopted by the Government was the
Act of Parliament passed in the year 1783 <a href="#note-400"
name="noteref-400" id="noteref-400">{9}</a> for the purpose of
authorising the removal of convicts from the gaols to the hulks
on the Thames, pending their transportation. The system of penal
discipline known as "the hulks" was originally adopted in 1775,
when an attempt was made to substitute that method of punishment
for transportation. During the following fifteen years some 8,000
convicts were sentenced to hard labour on the hulks. The system
was carried on by contract, the contractors providing the hulks
and all necessaries for their management, as well as provisions
and clothing for the convicts, at the rate of &#163;22 16s. 3d.
for each convict.</p>
<p>The preamble of the Act referred to recited that, "from the
unusually great number of offenders now under sentence or order
of transportation, in the gaols within England and Wales, there
is such a want of convenient and sufficient room in many of such
gaols that very dangerous consequences are to be apprehended,
unless some immediate provision be made for removing such
offenders to some other place of confinement." The Act then
empowered any three Justices of the Peace, duly authorised for
the purpose, to order the removal of male prisoners, under
sentence of death or transportation, from any gaol to any ship or
vessel in the Thames until they could be transported. During
their confinement in that manner, prisoners were to be allowed to
labour and to have half their earnings, but they were not to be
forced to work, and the time of their imprisonment was to be
deemed part of the term of transportation. Security was to be
taken by bond from the contractors who undertook to transport the
prisoners beyond the seas; and any prisoners who should return to
England before their time had expired, would be liable to suffer
death.</p>
<p>This Act was followed by another <a href="#note-401" name=
"noteref-401" id="noteref-401">{10}</a> passed in the following
year for "the effectual transportation of felons and other
offenders, and to authorise the removal of prisoners in certain
cases." It provided that any person convicted of a crime
punishable by transportation might be ordered to be transported
accordingly, and that his Majesty in Council might appoint to
what place beyond the seas he might be sent. By the Act of 1718,
transportation was confined to the colonies and plantations in
America; but as they ceased to be available for that purpose
after their independence had been recognised in 1783, it became
necessary to make other provisions. That was effected by the Act
of 1784, which enabled the Government to appoint any place it
might think proper by an Order-in-Council. No place had been
determined upon at the time the Act was passed; but the measure
shows that the Government were then contemplating the foundation
of a new colony in the shape of a penal settlement.</p>
<br>
<p>Among the various classes of offenders for whom transportation
was considered an appropriate punishment during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries were&#8212;</p>

their functions in any Episcopal meeting-house in Scotland,

transportation for life. 19 Geo. II, c. 38.</p>

Banishment as a judicial sentence prevailed in Scotland from the
seventeenth century. It was applied in ordinary cases as well as
in political disturbances, and probably owed its origin to the
difficulty of providing accommodation in the tolbooths.
Banishment from the Sovereign's "hail dominions furth of
Scotland", or from one district of Scotland to another, was a
common sentence.... The ordinary place of exile during the
eighteenth century was "His Majesty's plantations in
America."&#8212;Rogers, Social Life in Scotland, vol. i, p.

By an ancient custom of the realm, men in holy orders when
accused of any felony might claim the right of trial by
compurgation before their fellow priests. If the claim was
allowed, the accused was handed over to the Ordinary; in other
words, to the safe keeping of the Bishop of the diocese. Trial by
compurgation meant nothing more than a solemn declaration of
innocence, by the accused on oath taken in the presence of other
priests; and if they made oath&#8212;as they usually
did&#8212;that they believed him innocent, he became at once a
free man. Anyone who could read was entitled to claim benefit of
clergy, <i>clerici</i> or "clerks", being in early times the only
men who had learned to read. Laymen in later times acquired the
art in order that they might be qualified to claim this
privilege, and consequently it became common to all educated
persons. It was not entirely abolished until the time of George
IV. The reason why it was so long retained in the administration
of the criminal law was, apparently, because it was practically a
means of showing mercy to offenders convicted for the first time.
To prevent their claiming the privilege twice, the practice of
burning in the hand was introduced; the criminal being thereby
made to carry the register of his conviction in his hand.</p>

Burning in the hand was one of the last remnants of the old
practice of mutilation which used, in times preceding the Norman
Conquest, to be inflicted for all kinds of petty offences.
Branding on the forehead, cutting off the hands or feet, the
nose, ears, or upper lip, cutting out the tongue, plucking out
the eyes, tearing away the scalp, and sometimes flaying or
burning alive, were among the punishments sanctioned by the Saxon
laws, and subsequently adopted by the Norman. By the statute of
Vagabonds, passed in the time of Edward VI, a runaway servant was
to be branded on the breast with the letter V; and if he absented
himself for fourteen days he was to be branded on the forehead or
cheek with the letter S, and adjudged to be the slave of his
master for ever. One of Elizabeth's statutes enacted that a
vagabond above fourteen years of age was to be grievously
whipped, and burned "through the grissle of the right ear with a
hot iron of the compass of an inch", unless some responsible
person should take him into service for a year. Branding in the
hand was subsequently substituted for ecclesiastical
compurgation. The practice was not discontinued until the time of
George III.</p>

"Englishmen in authority, a little after the middle of the
eighteenth century, did not let their left hand know what their
right hand did; and at the very time when they asserted the
freedom of black slaves brought to England from the colonies,
they exported white convicts under sentence of transportation for
sale to settlers in America. The sum received was the payment to
the owners and captains of the transport ships for their trouble
and risk; and it is said that the white slaves and the black were
set to work together on the plantations, and were equally
punished by the ash for idleness or disobedience."&#8212;Pike,

<p><small>IT</small> was under the provisions of the statute
passed in 1784 that, by an Order-in-Council made on the 6th
December, 1786, "the eastern coast of New South Wales" was
declared and appointed to be the place to which certain
offenders, named in two lists annexed to the Order, should be
transported. Some historical interest consequently attaches to
it, seeing that it contains the fiat by which New South Wales was
created a penal station.</p>
<p>At a Council held at the Court of St. James's, on 6 December,
1786, the following Order was made:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Whereas by the Act passed in the twenty-fourth year
of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled An Act for the
Effectual Transportation of Felons and other offenders, and to
authorise the Removal of Prisoners in certain cases, and for
other purposes therein mentioned, it is enacted that from and
after the passing of the said Act, when any person or persons at
any session of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or at any
Quarter or other General Session of the peace, to be holden for
any county, riding, division, city, town, borough, liberty, or
place within that part of Great Britain called England, or at any
great session to be holden for the County Palatine of Chester, or
within the Principality of Wales, shall be convicted of fraud or
petty larceny, or any other offence for which such person or
persons shall be liable by the laws of this realm to be
transported, it shall and may be lawful for the Court before
which any such person or persons shall be so convicted as
aforesaid, or any subsequent Court holden at any place for the
said county, riding, division, city, town, borough, liberty, or
place, respectively, with like authority, to order and adjudge
that such person or persons so convicted as aforesaid shall be
transported beyond the seas for any term of years, not exceeding
the number of years or term for which such person or persons is
or are or shall be liable by any law to be transported; and in
every such case it shall and may be lawful for his Majesty, by
and with the advice of his Privy Council, to declare and appoint
to what place or places, part or parts, beyond the seas, either
within his Majesty's dominions, or elsewhere out of his Majesty's
dominions, such felons or other offenders shall be conveyed or
transported: And such Court as aforesaid is thereby authorised
and empowered to order such offenders to be transported to the
use of any person or persons, and his or their assigns, who shall
contract for the due performance of such transportation:<br>

life, or any number of years, and such intention of mercy shall
be signified by one of his Majesty's Principal Secretaries of
State, it shall be lawful for any Court having proper authority
to allow such offender or offenders the benefit of a conditional
pardon, and (except in cases where such offender or offenders
shall be authorised by his Majesty to transport himself, herself,

<h3><a name="ch-37" id="ch-37"></a>3.10 CROMWELL'S PRISONERS.
<small>[1651]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>AFTER</small> the battle of Worcester, when the
Scottish army which invaded England to reinstate Charles I was
defeated by Cromwell on 3rd September, 1651, and 10,000 prisoners
were taken, the Scottish prisoners were brought to London, and
marched through the city into Tothill Fields. Most of the common
soldiers&#8212;according to an old chronicle&#8212;"were sent to
the English plantations, and 1,500 of them were granted to the
Guiney merchants, and sent to work in the gold-mines there." "All
the foot, and others who were taken in the town [of Worcester],
except some few officers and persons of quality, were driven like
cattle, with a guard, to London, and there treated with great
rigour; and many perished for want of food, and being enclosed in
little rooms till they were sold to the plantations for slaves,
they died of all diseases."&#8212;plantation. Clarendon, History,
book xiii. "It is pretended, of the Scots there were slain about
2,000, and 7,000 or 8,000 taken prisoners, who, being sent to
London, were sold for slaves to the plantations of the American
isles."&#8212;Rapin, History of England. Heath's Chronicle, p.
301, ed. 1676, describes the prisoners as "driven like a herd of
swine through Westminster to Tothill Fields, and there sold to
several merchants, and sent into the Barbadoes." The prisoners,
according to another authority cited in Notes and Queries, Nov.
30, 1850, p. 448, were "sold away slaves, at half-a-crown a
dozen, for foreign plantations, among savages." And Echard,
History of England, vol. ii, p. 727, says that Cromwell "marched
off triumphantly to London, driving 4,000 or 5,000 prisoners like
sheep before him, making presents of them, as occasion offered,

the English plantations abroad."</p>
<p>By the <i>jus gentium</i> of that time, all prisoners taken in
war were slaves, and could be transported beyond the seas.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-38" id="ch-38"></a>3.11 TRANSPORTATION TO
AMERICA.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"<small>THE</small> prisoner condemned to
transportation were a saleable commodity. Such was the demand for
labour in America, that convicts and labourers were regularly
purchased and shipped to the colonies, where they were sold as
indented servants. The courtiers round James II exulted in the
rich harvest which Monmouth's rebellion promised, and begged of
the monarch frequent gifts of their condemned countrymen. Judge
Jeffries heard of the scramble, and indignantly addressed the
King:&#8212;'I beseech your Majesty that I may inform you that
each prisoner will be worth &#163;10, if not &#163;15, apiece;
and, sir, if your Majesty orders these as you have already
designed, persons that have not suffered in the service will run
away with the booty.' At length the spoils were distributed. The
convicts were in part persons of family and education, accustomed
to ease and elegance. 'Take all care', wrote the monarch, under
the countersign of Sunderland, to the Government in Virginia,
'that they continue to serve for ten years at least, and that
they be not permitted in any manner to redeem themselves by money
or otherwise until that term be fully expired. Prepare a Bill for
the Assembly of our colony, with such clauses as shall be
requisite for this purpose.' No Virginia Legislature seconded
such malice, and in December, 1689, the exiles were pardoned.
Tyranny and injustice peopled America with men nurtured in
suffering and adversity. The history of our colonisation is the
history of the crimes of Europe.<br>
<br>
"Thus did Jeffries contribute to people the New World. On another
occasion he exerted an opposite influence. Kidnapping had become
common in Bristol, and not felons only, but young persons and
others, were hurried across the Atlantic and sold for money. At
Bristol, the Mayor and Justices would intimidate small rogues and
pilferers, who, under the terror of being hanged, prayed for
transportation as the only avenue to safety, and were then
divided among the members of the Court. The trade was exceedingly
profitable&#8212;far more so than the slave trade&#8212;and had
been conducted for years. By accident, it came to the knowledge
of Jeffries, who delighted in a fair opportunity to rant. Finding
that the Aldermen, Justices, and the Mayor himself were concerned
in this kidnapping, he turned to the Mayor, who was sitting on
the Bench, bravely arrayed in scarlet and furs, and gave him
every ill name which scolding eloquence could devise. Nor would
he desist till he made the scarlet chief magistrate of the city
go down to the criminal's post at the bar, and plead for himself
as a common rogue would have done. The prosecutions depended till
the revolution, which made an amnesty; and the judicial
kidnappers, retaining their gains, suffered nothing beyond
disgrace and terror."&#8212;Bancroft, History of the United
States, c. xiv; The Colonies on the Chesapeake Bay.</blockquote>
<p>The scene between Jeffries and the Mayor of Bristol is
described in North's Life of the Lord Keeper Guildford, vol. ii,
p. 24, as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"There had been an usage among the Aldermen and
Justices of that city [Bristol]&#8212;where all persons, even
common shopkeepers, more or less, trade to the American
plantations&#8212;to carry over criminals who were pardoned with
condition of transportation, and to sell them for money. This was
found to be a good trade, but not being content to take such
felons as were convicted at their assizes and sessions, which
produced but a few, they found out a shorter way, which yielded a
greater plenty of the commodity. And that was this: The Mayor and
Justices, or some of them, usually met at their tolsey (a
Court-house by their Exchequer) about noon, which was the meeting
of the merchants, as at the Exchange at London; and there they
sat and did justice&#8212;business that was brought before them.
When small rogues and pilferers were taken and brought there, and
upon examination put under the terror of being hanged, in order
to which mittimuses were making, some of the diligent officers
attending instructed them to pray transportation as the only way
to save them; and for the most part they did so. Then no more was
done; but the next alderman in course took one and another as
their turns came, sometimes quarrelling whose the last was, and
sent them over and sold them. This trade had now been driven for
many years and no notice taken of it."</blockquote>
<p>North then relates how Jeffries pounced upon the Mayor, pat
him in the dock, and made him plead for himself, "as a common
rogue or thief must have done"; finally taking security from him
and his accomplices to answer informations in the King's
Bench.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-39" id="ch-39"></a>3.12 EARLY VIRGINIAN
PLANTERS.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>DE FOE</small>, in many of his writings, and especially
in his novel&#8212;The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous
Moll Flanders, published in 1721&#8212;supplies a good deal of
information with respect to the transportation system as it was
carried out at the time he wrote. The following extracts show how
largely the system prevailed at that time; the classes of people
who were sent out to the plantations; the practice of dealing
with convicts ordered for transportation; and the custom
established in America of buying them from the captains of the
vessels in which they were transported:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Among the rest, she often told me how the greatest
part of the inhabitants of that colony [Virginia] came thither in
very indifferent circumstances from England; that, generally
speaking. they were of two sorts&#8212;either, 1st, such as were
brought over by masters of ships to be sold as servants; or, 2nd,
such as were transported after having been found guilty of crimes
punishable with death.<br>
<br>
"When they come here we make no difference; the planters buy
them, and they work together in the field till their time is out;
when 'tis expired they have encouragement given them to plant for
themselves, for they have a certain number of acres of land
allotted them by the country, and they go to work to clear and
cure the land, and then to plant it with tobacco and corn for
their own use; and as the merchants will trust them with tools
and necessaries upon the credit of their crop before it is grown,
so they again plant every year a little more than the year
before, and so buy whatever they want with the crop that is
before them. Hence, child, says she, many a Newgate bird becomes
a great man, and we have several Justices of the Peace, officers
of the trained bands, and magistrates of the towns they live in,
that have been burnt in the hand. . . . . You need not think such
a thing strange, daughter, for some of the best men in the
country are burnt in the hand, and they are not ashamed to own
it. There's Major &#8212;&#8212;; he was an eminent pickpocket;
there's Justice &#8212;&#8212;, was a shoplifter, and both of
them were burnt in the hand, and I could name you several, such
as they are."</blockquote>
<p>In another passage the author describes the practice of buying
and selling the convicts. The heroine of his story, having been
convicted of stealing in a dwelling, was sentenced to death, but
transported on "an humble petition for transportation." Her
husband was a highwayman captured on suspicion, but not tried,
and allowed to transport himself:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"When we drew near to the shore [of Virginia], the
captain called me to him and told me that he found by my
discourse I had some relations in the place, and that I had been
there before, and so he supposed I understood the custom in their
disposing the convict prisoners when they arrived. I told him I
did not. . . . He told me I must get somebody in the place to
come and buy me as a servant, and who must answer for me to the
Governor of the country if he demanded me. I told him we should
do as he should direct; so he brought a planter to treat with
him, as it were, for the purchase of me for a servant (my husband
not being ordered to be sold), and there I was formally sold to
him, and went ashore with him. The captain went with us. . . .
After some time the planter gave us a certificate of discharge
and an acknowledgment of having served him faithfully, and I was
free from him the next morning to go whither I would. For this
piece of service the captain demanded of me six thousand-weight
of tobacco, which he said he was accountable for to his
freighter, and which we immediately bought for him, and made him
a present of twenty guineas besides, with which he was abundantly
satisfied."</blockquote>
<p>The practice of kidnapping people in the streets, and shipping
them out to Virginia to be sold as indented servants, forms the
subject of several incidents in another of De Foe's
novels&#8212;Colonel Jack. And a paper On the Return to England
of Transported Felons, published by him in Applebee's Journal,
January 26, 1723, contains some interesting matter on that
subject.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-40" id="ch-40"></a>3.13 TRANSPORTATION TO THE
WEST INDIES. <small>[1774]</small></h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"<small>THE</small> lower order of white people [in
Jamaica] are for the most part composed of artificers, indented
servants, and refugees of the second class, great numbers used
formerly to be brought from Scotland, where they were actually
kidnapped by some <i>man-traders</i> in or near Glasgow, and
shipped for this island, to be sold for four or five years' term
of service. On their arrival they used to be ranged in a line,
like new negroes, for the planters to pick and choose. But this
traffic has ceased for some years.<br>
<br>
"Although the gaol delivery of Newgate is not poured in upon this
island, yet it is an occasional asylum for many who have deserved
the gallows. . . . . . Formerly, convict felons were transported
hither, but the inconvenience attending the admission of such
miscreants obtained the inhabitants a relief from them. While the
traffic for Scotch servants lasted, the Legislature of the island
lent their helping hand to give it encouragement, and in 1703 it
was enacted that a master of any ship importing thirty white
men-servants at one time should be for that voyage exempted from
paying all port charges. . . . . Convicts are excepted out of
this Act, and none have of late years been sent over, unless to
the regiments, whose service here is not much advanced by such
recruits.<br>
<br>
"The indented servants, in their condition, were little better
than slaves during their term of service. They were allowed
yearly three shirts, as many pairs of drawers, shoes, and
stockings, and a hat or cap. . . . . They were subjected to
various penalties for misdemeanour, viz.:&#8212;For laying
violent hands on their employer, twelve months' extra service;
embezzling or wasting goods of above 40s. value, two years' extra
service; getting a fellow-servant with child, a service of double
the time the woman had to serve; marrying without the consent of
their master or mistress, two years' extra service; wilfully
catching the venereal or other disease, or wilfully getting
broken bones, bruises, &amp;c., to serve double the time thereby
lost, and for all charges thereby occasioned at 10s. a month
after the expiration of their indentures ... The only material
provisions in their favour were:&#8212;That they should not be
whipped naked without order of a Justice of the Peace; nor be
turned off when grown infirm, under pretence of giving them
freedom; nor be buried until the body had been viewed by a
Justice of the Peace, constable, tythingman, or two
neighbours.<br>
<br>
"But the penal clauses of these Acts have long since been
extinct, and at present [1774] our white indented servants are
laid under few restrictions, except so far as respects their
serving out their term. The wages paid in these cases varied from
&#163;14 to &#163;18 a year."</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-41" id="ch-41"></a>3.14 AN OFFICIAL ESTIMATE OF
TRANSPORTATION. <small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> following extract from an official letter,
bearing date 29 January, 1787, written by Duncan Campbell,
superintendent of the convicts on the river Thames, for the
information of the Government, furnishes a basis for calculating
the number sent annually to America:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>It appears by a calculation I made for the
information of the House of Commons some years since, that, upon
an average of seven years&#8212;from 1769 to 1775, both
inclusive&#8212;I transported five hundred and forty-seven
convicts annually from London, Middlesex, Bucks, and the four
counties of the Home Circuit, and that one hundred and seventeen
of those transports were women. I always looked upon the number
from the other parts of the Kingdom to be equal to what was
transported by me.<br>
<br>
According to this estimate, the number of convicts transported
annually to the American colonies during the period referred to
was about one thousand one hundred.</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="ch-42" id="ch-42"></a>3.15 DR. LANG'S ESTIMATE.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"<small>IT</small> is no longer possible to ascertain
with any degree of accuracy the number of convicts transported to
the West Indies and the American colonies previous to the war of
American Independence. During the publication of the
<i>Encyclop&#233;die M&#233;thodique</i>, in the year 1785, the
article <i>Etats Unis</i> was submitted by its author, M.
Meusnier, to the President Jefferson, who was then American
Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of France; and in reference
to this class of persons, to which the French editor had alluded
as one of the three classes that peopled America, Jefferson
supplied him with the following remarks [quoted ante, p.
19]:&#8212;<br>
<br>
"It is pretty evident, from the tenor of these observations, that
this was by no means a favourite subject with the worthy
Plenipotentiary, whose native patriotism, as well as his laudable
desire to make his countrymen stand as well as possible with
their good allies, doubtless induced him to throw a little
American dust in the eyes of the French encyclop&#230;dist. For
while he would induce the reader, at the commencement of his
remarks, to believe that not more than two thousand English
convicts had ever been transported to America altogether, he
intimates at the close of them that this estimate referred to the
colony of Virginia alone, the comparison which he institutes
being made with the population of that colony at the commencement
of the war, and not with that of the United States generally.<br>
<br>
"On the publication of Governor Phillip's Voyage to New South
Wales in the year 1790, <a href="#note-404" name="noteref-404"
id="noteref-404">{1}</a> an estimate of the number of convicts
annually transported to America for some time previous to the
war, was made expressly for that work (if I am not mistaken) by
the Honorable Mr. Eden, afterwards Lord Auckland, a nobleman who
had much better access to correct information on the subject of
transportation than President Jefferson; who, besides, had no
prejudice to bias him respecting it, and who had himself been in
America in the capacity of envoy-extraordinary from Great Britain
during the war; and the result of that estimate was, that the
number so transported had been about two thousand every year.<br>
<br>
"Allowing, however, that this estimate was as much above the
truth as President Jefferson's was below it, I conceive it may be
taken for granted that, as the system of transporting criminals
to America had been in practice from the year 1619, or for one
hundred and fifty-seven years previous to the American
Declaration of Independence, as many convicts had been
transported to America during that period as would have amounted
to at least five hundred every year for a whole century previous
to the war, or to fifty thousand altogether.<br>
<br>
"It would seem that none of the convicts were ever transported to
that part of the American territory called New England,
comprising the States of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New
Hampshire, Maine, Vermont and Rhode Islands. The puritanical
character and origin of their population preclude such an
idea.<br>
<br>
"The American colonies to which convicts were transported under
the old system were those of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, North
and South Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, and
Pennsylvania; the population of which amounted at the
commencement of the war to 1,800,000, that of the New England
colonies being about 700,000. It was, therefore, over a territory
extending from north to south from six to seven hundred
geographical miles, and of boundless extent to the
westward&#8212;a country, moreover, containing at the close of
the period referred to a population of upwards of a million and a
half&#8212;that 50,000 British convicts were slowly dispersed in
the course of a century and upward. These convicts were literally
"bought by the planters for the terms specified in their
respective warrants, and worked with their negro slaves under the
lash of an overseer", as is testified by a contemporary writer;
for it would seem that the British Government of that period
never inquired how the convicts were treated in the American
colonies, provided they were only prevented from returning
home."</blockquote>

The only estimate to be found in it appears in a foot-note (p.
6). where it is stated that "the mercantile returns" of the
system amounted to &#163;40,000 per annum; "about 2,000 convicts
being sold for &#163;20 each."</p>

All the returns on this subject, so far as they relate to the
First Fleet, differ from one another:&#8212;<br>
<br>
<small>PHILLIP'S VOYAGE</small> contains, in an appendix, "a list
of Convicts sent to New South Wales in 1787", giving their names,
where convicted, date of conviction, and term of sentence. The
total number thus stated amounts to 775. But a summary in the
preface gives different results; the number being:&#8212;600 male
convicts, 250 females; total, 850; while another summary at p. 13
makes the number of male convicts, 586; of female, 192; total,
778.<br>
<br>
<small>LIEUTENANT KING'S MS</small>. Journal of the Voyage to
Botany Bay gives a specific account of each ship in the Fleet,
including the number of convicts on board the transports. The
number of male convicts is stated by him at 563, the female at
189; total, 752.<br>
<br>
<small>COLLINS</small>, in the introduction to his Account of the
Colony, gives a similar return, showing the number of male
convicts on board at 564; of females, 192; total, 756.<br>
<br>
The <small>HISTORY OF NEW HOLLAND</small>, published by Stockdale
in 1787, before the departure of the Fleet, states the number of

<h3><a name="ch-45" id="ch-45"></a>3.18 CONTEMPORARY
OPINIONS.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>ONE</small> of the most important periodicals published
in England towards the close of the last century was the Annual
Register, founded in 1758 by Edmund Burke. It purported to give a
summary of the history of each year, including the most notable
events in the domestic annals of the country. The volume for 1787
contains no mention of the Expedition to Botany Bay, which sailed
in May of that year; and the only reference to it in the volume
for 1788 (p. 205) is the following:&#8212;</p>
<p>By the last accounts received from the fleet for Botany Bay,
they arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on the 13th of October
last, and expected to sail again about the middle of November,
and to proceed directly for their place of destination. They were
very healthy, and the convicts very orderly. The number of deaths
from England to the Cape amounted to twenty-one.</p>
<p>Next in rank to the Annual Register stood the Gentleman's
Magazine, originally published in 1731, and still in existence as
a monthly. It did not approve of the Expedition; and in the
number for October, 1786, the following comments appeared in
it:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>A plan is said to be formed, and now actually
carrying into execution, for settling a new colony at Botany Bay,
in New Holland, at which place Lieutenant Cook, in 1770, made
some stay to repair his ship and refresh his men. As the
ostensible design of the projectors is to prepare a settlement
for the reception of felons, no place, in the opinion of many,
can be more improper for that purpose than Botany Bay, to which
it is impossible they can be transported at any moderate expense,
nor supported, when they arrive, without a miracle. The eastern
coast of New Holland is, perhaps, the most barren, least
inhabited, and worst cultivated country in the southern
hemisphere; and Botany Bay is at too great a distance from any
European settlement to receive either succour or friendly
assistance. The establishment is said to consist of a
Post-Captain, a Governor, with a salary of &#163;500 a year; a
Master and Commander, a Lieutenant-Governor, with &#163;300 a
year; four captains, twelve subalterns, twelve sergeants, and one
hundred and sixty rank and file from the marines, a surgeon,
chaplain, adjutant, and quarter-master. The whole
equipment&#8212;army, navy, and felons&#8212;are to be supplied
with two years' provisions and all sorts of implements for the
culture of the earth and hunting and fishing; and some light
buildings are to be run up immediately, till a proper fort and
town-house are erected. If this report is true, the expense will
be equal to that of an expedition to the South Sea against an
enemy; and if it is to be continued with every freight of felons,
it will annihilate the surplus that is intended for augmenting
the fund appropriated for the payment of the national debt. It is
certainly a most extravagant scheme, and probably will be
reconsidered.</blockquote>
<p>In the November number of the Magazine, a letter from a
correspondent quotes several passages from Cook's Voyage from 28
April to 5 May, 1770, describing the barren nature of the land
and the "bloodthirsty" disposition of the aborigines. Another
correspondent replied in the December number, stating the great
care that to his knowledge was then being taken to provide for
the comfort of the convicts, and expressing a hope that "this
colony may one day flourish and be respectable."</p>
<p>Among the contemporaries of the Gentleman's Magazine and the
Annual Register, the Monthly Review&#8212;founded in 1749, and
regularly published until 1844&#8212;held a prominent place; but
the only reference to the Expedition to be found in its pages
(vol. lxxv, p. 475) appeared in the shape of a critical notice of
a pamphlet, in which the project was roughly handled by an
anonymous writer, said to be Alexander Dalrymple:&#8212;</p>
<p class="blok" align="center"><i>A Serious Admonition to the
Public on the intended Thief-Colony at Botany Bay, 8vo., 1s.
6d.&#8212;Sewel, 1786.</i></p>
<blockquote>The author objects to the plan of sending convicts to
New Holland on several accounts. He thinks it unadvisable for us
to establish new colonies, especially at so great a distance from
home, while the country is still smarting for a war with her own
colonies, whom she found herself unable to keep in dependence.
His next argument is founded on the idea that the scheme would be
an infringement on the charter of the East India Company granting
to them an exclusive trade and navigation from the Cape of Good
Hope to the Streights of Magellan, within which boundaries New
Holland is situated. The great expence necessary to keep the
convicts in subjection, after their landing, as well as that of
transporting them thither, forms another of this gentleman's
objections to the intended plan: he likewise shews the great
inconveniences that must arise if the colonists are left entirely
to themselves. The arguments of our author are by no means those
of an inexperienced man, either in politics or in trade; yet his
style, we are sorry to observe, is neither so polite as a public
admonition and strictures on the conduct of Government require,
nor is it altogether free from rancour.<br>
<br>
After having thus stated, and in a good measure demonstrated, the
truth of his objections, our author proposes a scheme of sending
convicts to another place, which he apprehends will be attended
with less expence to the public, and free from the objections to
which the former is liable. He would transport them to the Island
of Tristan Da Cunha, where, on account of its situation,
Governors and guards would be unnecessary; and he would have them
left there to themselves, without arms, and with such small boats
only as could not quit the coast. This island is situated in
latitude 37&#176; 7' south and longitude 16&#176; 10' west of
London. It is considerably larger than St. Helena, well watered,
and abundantly stocked with seals and birds. The coast abounds in
a variety of fish, and the inland parts produce plenty of
vegetables and wood.<br>
<br>
Near to this island are two others (one bearing S.W. by W.,
distance six or seven leagues; the other S.S.W. half W., distance
six or seven leagues) which, though not so large, are
nevertheless similar in their external appearance and
productions.<br>
<br>
From the situation of these islands, there is no possibility of
the banished convicts ever escaping, while they are destitute of
boats capable of sailing to the distance of two hundred miles or
upwards, in a rough and dangerous sea; this last circumstance
seems a strong argument in support of our author's scheme.<br>
<br>
The only reference to the projected expedition to be found in the
memoirs of contemporary statesmen is the following passage in.
Stanhope's Life of Pitt, vol. i, p. 338:&#8212;<br>
<br>
In the session of 1787 was passed the measure which laid the
foundation of new colonies, scarcely less important than those
which we had recently lost. The want of some fixed place for
penal exile had been severely felt ever since the American War,
and the accumulation of prisoners at home was counteracting the
benevolent efforts of Howard for the improvement of the British
gaols. The discoveries of Captain Cook were now remembered and
turned to practical account. An Act of Parliament empowered his
Majesty, by commission under the Great Seal, to establish a
Government for the reception of convict prisoners in New South
Wales. An Order-in-Council completed the necessary forms. Captain
Arthur Phillip, of the Royal Navy, was appointed Governor,
commanding a body of marines, and conveying six hundred male and
two hundred and fifty female convicts. The expedition set sail in
May, 1787, and early in the following year laid the foundation of
the new settlement at Port Jackson in Botany Bay.</blockquote>
<p>There is little or nothing to show that Pitt took any active
part in organising the expedition. The only documents preserved
in the Record Office which contain any mention of his name in
connection with the matter relate to an estimate of the probable
expenditure which he had called for. The following memo, from
Nepean to Sir Charles Middleton is without date, but was
apparently written on the 12th December, 1786:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Nepean presents his compliments to Sir Charles
Middleton, is desired by Mr. Pitt to request that he will order a
statement to be made of the expenses which it is supposed will be
incurred under the direction of the Navy Board for the providing
of provisions, clothing, implements, etc., for the convicts, and
sending them out to Botany Bay, including the expenses incurred
for the detachment of marines. It is not expected that any
statement which can now be made will be an accurate one, but Mr.
Pitt wishes to obtain within a few days some information upon the
business which may lead him to form an opinion to what expense
this establishment may be likely to amount.<br>
<br>
Mr. Nepean has applied to the Admiralty for information
respecting the equipment of the Sirius and the Tender, and the
annual expense of their crews, as well as with regard to the pay
of the marines. He has likewise applied to Mr. Rogers for an
account of the value of the stores which have been supplied by
the Board of Ordnance.</blockquote>
<p>To this memo. Sir Charles Middleton replied, on the 13th
December, that he would "furnish Mr. Pitt with the information
required, as far as the state of the business will admit, as soon
as possible, probably this evening or early to-morrow." On the
28th December, an estimate of the expenses for three years was
sent from the Admiralty "for the information of Mr.
Pitt"&#8212;the amount stated being &#163;45,572.</p>
<p>No other mention of Pitt's name in connection with the matter
can be traced.</p>
<p>The actual expenditure incurred in the equipment and despatch
of the First Fleet&#8212;including the marines&#8212;was
published in the Annual Register for 1791, as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>An account of the expence incurred in transporting
convicts to New South Wales, as far as the same can be made
up&#8212;</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-46" id="ch-46"></a>3.19 SIR JOSEPH BANKS.
<small>[1743-1820]</small></h3>
<br>
<blockquote><small>SIR JOSEPH BANKS</small>, who was born at
Argyle-street, London, on 13 February, 1743-4, was the only son
of William Banks of Revesby Abbey, in Lincolnshire, and Sarah,
daughter of William Bate. He received his early education under a
private tutor. At the age of nine he was sent to Harrow School,
and thence transferred to Eton when he was thirteen. He left that
school in his eighteenth year, and then entered as a gentleman
commoner at Christ Church College, Oxford, in December, 1760. His
liking for botany&#8212;which had shown itself during his
boyhood&#8212;increased while at the University, and he warmly
embraced the other branches of natural history. Finding that no
lectures were given in botany, he sought and obtained permission
to procure a teacher to be paid by the students. He then went by
stage-coach to Cambridge, and brought back with him Mr. Israel
Lyons, astronomer and botanist, who afterwards published a small
book on the Cambridge Flora. Many years subsequently, Lyons,
through the interest of Banks, was appointed astronomer under
Captain Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave, on his voyage towards
the North Pole.<br>
<br>
Banks's father died in 1761, during his first year at Oxford,
leaving him an ample fortune and estate at Revesby. He left
Oxford in December, 1763, after taking an honorary degree. In
February, 1764, he came of age and took possession of his
paternal fortune. He had already attracted attention in the
University by his superior attainments in natural history, and in
May, 1766, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. During the
same summer he went to Newfoundland to collect plants with his
friend, Lieutenant Phipps. He returned to England the following
winter by way of Lisbon. After his return, an intimacy was
established between Dr. Daniel Solander and himself, which only
ended by the death of the former. Solander had been a favourite
pupil of Linnaeus, and at the time when Banks first came to know
him was employed as an assistant librarian at the British Museum.
He afterwards became Banks's companion round the world, and
subsequently his librarian until his death.<br>
<br>
By his influence with Lord Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty.
Banks obtained permission to accompany Cook's expedition in the
Endeavour, equipped at his own expense, taking with him Dr.
Solander, two draughtsmen&#8212;Mr. Buchan for landscape, and Mr.
Sydney Parkinson for objects of natural history&#8212;and two
attendants. The journal which he kept was largely utilised by Dr.
Hawkesworth in his relation of the Voyages of Carteret, Wallis,
and Cook. The Endeavour left England in August, 1768, and
returned in July, 1771.<br>
<br>
The success of this voyage, and the enthusiasm it evoked, led to
a second voyage under the same commander in the Resolution. At
the solicitation of Lord Sandwich, Banks offered to accompany
this expedition. The offer being accepted, the outfit was begun
and Zoffany the painter, three draughtsmen, two secretaries, and
nine other skilled assistants were engaged. The accommodation on
board was found insufficient, and additional cabins were built on
deck. These were found on trial not only to affect the ship's
sailing powers, but also her stability. They were therefore
ordered to be demolished, and Banks abandoned his intention of
sailing in the Resolution. Dr. Lind had been appointed naturalist
to the expedition under a grant of &#163;4,000, but on hearing of
Banks's decision he declined the post. Dr. Johann Reinhold
Forster and his son George ultimately sailed with the expedition.
Being disappointed in this quarter, Banks resolved to visit
Iceland with his followers and Dr. Solander. He reached that
island in August, 1772, climbed to the top of Hecla, and returned
in six weeks, the results being summarised in Dr. Von. Troils'
volume.<br>
<br>
Sir John Pringle, president of the Royal Society, retired from.
the chair in 1777, and Banks was chosen as his successor on 30th
November, 1778, and held that distinguished position until his
death. He found, it is stated, secretaries assuming the power
which belonged to the president alone, and other abuses which he
determined to rectify. This intention, coupled with the fact that
natural history had been less cultivated than mathematics in the
Royal Society, caused an amount of discontent amongst some of the
members, which broke out a few years later in the session of
1783-4. . . . A motion was ultimately carried in support of the
president's conduct, and a few members left the society. Harmony,
however, was restored, and the ascendancy of Banks never again
questioned.<br>
<br>
In March, 1779, Banks married Dorothea, daughter of William
Weston Hugessen, of Provender, in Kent, who survived him. He was
created a Baronet in 1781, invested with the Order of the Bath in
July, 1795, and sworn of the Privy Council in March. 1797.<br>
<br>
In 1802 he was chosen a member of the National Institute of
France, and his letter of thanks in response for the honour was
the occasion of a bitter anonymous attack by an old opponent, Dr.
Horsley, who taxed him with want of patriotic feeling.<br>
<br>
Towards the close of his life he was greatly troubled with gout,
so much so as to lose at times the use of his limbs. He died at
his house at Spring Grove, Isleworth, on 19 June, 1820, leaving a
widow, but no children. By his express desire, he was buried in
the simplest manner in the parish church. By will he left
&#163;200 per annum to his librarian at his death, Robert Brown,
with the use of his herbarium and library during his life, the
reversion being to the British Museum. Brown made over these
collections to the nation within a short time after acquiring
possession of them. Francis Bauer was also provided for during
his life, to enable him to continue his exquisite drawings from
new plants at Kew.<br>
<br>
The character which Banks has left behind him is that of a
munificent patron of science rather than an actual worker
himself. His own writings are comparatively trifling. He wrote A
Short Account of the Causes of the Disease called the Blight,
Mildew, and Rust, which was published in 1805, reaching a second
edition in 1806, and re-edited in 1807, besides being reprinted
by W. Curtis in his Observations on the British Grasses, and in
the Pamphleteer for 1813. He was the author of an anonymous tract
on the Propriety of Allowing a Qualified Exportation of Wool in
1782, and in 1809 he brought out a small work on the merino
sheep, a pet subject of his as well as of the King, George III.
There were some short articles by him in the Transactions of the
Horticultural Society, a few in the Arch&#230;ologia, one in the
Linnean Society's Transactions, and a short essay on the Economy
of a Park, in vol. 39 of Young's Annals of Agriculture. He
published Kaempfer's Icones Plantarum in 1791, in folio, and
directed the issue of Roxburgh's Coromandel Plants, 1795-1819, 3
vols., folio. He seems to have given up all thought of publishing
the results of his collections on the death of Dr. Solander, in
1782, by apoplexy, although the plates were engraved and the text
drawn up in proper order for press. The manuscripts are preserved
in the botanical department of the British Museum, in Cromwell
Road.<br>
<br>
His collections were freely accessible to all scientific men of
every nation, and his house in Soho Square became the
gathering-place of science. The library was catalogued by Dr.
Dryander, and issued in five volumes in 1800-5, a work greatly
valued on account of its accuracy. Fabricius described his
insects; Broussonet received his specimens of fishes; Gaertner,
Vahl, and Robert Brown have largely used the stores of plants,
and four editions of Desiderata were issued previously to the
publication of the Catalogue. Banks spared neither pains nor cost
in enriching his library, which, at his death, must be considered
as being the richest of its class. It is still kept by itself in
a room at the British Museum, although the natural history
collections have been transferred to the new building at South
Kensington.<br>
<br>
An unstinted eulogy was pronounced by Cuvier before the
<i>Academie Royale des Sciences</i> in the April following the
death of Banks. In this he testifies to the generous intervention
of Banks on behalf of foreign naturalists. When the collections
made by Labillardi&#232;re during D'Entrecasteaux's expedition
fell by fortune of war into British hands and were brought to
England, Banks hastened to send them back to France without
having even glanced at them, writing to M. de Jussieu that he
would not steal a single botanic idea from those who had gone in
peril of their lives to get them. Ten times were parcels
addressed to the Royal Gardens in the Paris, which had been
captured by English cruisers. He constantly acted as scientific
adviser to the King; it was he who directed the despatch of
collectors abroad for the enrichment of the gardens at Kew.<br>
<br>
The influence of his strong will was manifest in all his
undertakings and voyages; he was to be found in the first boat
which visited each unknown land. After his return he became
almost autocratic in his power; to him everything of a scientific
character seemed to gravitate naturally, and his long tenure of
the presidential chair of the Royal Society led him to exercise
over it a vigorous authority, which has been denounced as
despotic.<br>
<br>
Dr. Kippis's account in his Pamphlet seems very fairly to
describe the disposition of Banks:&#8212;"The temper of the
president has been represented as greatly despotic. Whether it be
so or not, I am unable to determine from personal knowledge. I do
not find that a charge of this kind is brought against him by
those who have it in their power to be better judges of the
matter. He appears to be manly, liberal, and open in his
behaviour to his acquaintance, and very persevering in his
friendship. Those who have formed the closet intimacy with him
have continued their connection and maintained their esteem and
regard. This was the case with Captain Cook and Dr. Solander, and
other instances might, I believe, be mentioned to the same
purpose. The man who, for a course of years and without
diminution, preserves the affection of those friends who know him
best, is not likely to have unpardonable faults of temper. It is
possible that Sir Joseph Banks may have assumed a firm tone in
the execution of his duty as president of the society, and have
been free in his rebukes where he apprehended that there was any
occasion for them. If this had been the case, it is not
surprising that he should not be universally popular."&#8212;From

<h3><a name="ch-48" id="ch-48"></a>3.21 PHILLIP'S INSTRUCTIONS.
<small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p class="blok" align="center">George R.</p>
<blockquote>Instructions for our trusty and well-beloved Arthur
Phillip, Esq., our Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and
over our territory of New South Wales and its dependencies, or to
the Lieutenant-Governor or Commander-in-Chief of the said
territory for the time being. Given at our Court at St. James's,
the 23rd day of April, 1787, in the twenty-seventh year of our
reign.<br>
<br>
<small>WITH</small> these our Instructions you will receive our
Commission under our Great Seal constituting and appointing you
to be our Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of our territory
called New South Wales, extending from the northern cape or
extremity of the coast, called Cape York, in the latitude of
10&#176; 37' south, to the southern extremity of the said
territory of New South Wales, or South Cape, in the latitude of
43&#176; 39' south, and of all the country inland to the westward
as far as the 135&#176; of east longitude, reckoning from the
meridian of Greenwich, including all the islands adjacent in the
Pacific Ocean within the latitudes aforesaid&#8212;10&#176; 37'
south and 43&#176; 39' south&#8212;and of all towns, garrisons,
castles, forts, and all other fortifications or other military
works which may be hereafter erected upon the said territory or
any of the said islands, with directions to obey such orders and
instructions as shall from time to time be given to you, under
our signet and sign manual, or by our Orders in our Privy
Council.<br>
<br>
You are therefore to fit yourself with all convenient speed and
to hold yourself in readiness to repair to your said command, and
being arrived to take upon you the execution of the trust we have
reposed in you as soon as conveniently may be, with all due
solemnity to cause our said Commission under our Great Seal of
Great Britain constituting you our Governor and
Commander-in-Chief as aforesaid to be read and published.<br>
<br>
And whereas We have ordered that about 600 male and about 180
female convicts now under sentence or order of transportation,
whose names are contained in the list hereunto annexed, should be
removed out of the gaols and other places of confinement in this
our kingdom, and be put on board the several transport ships
which have been taken up for their reception: It is our royal
will and pleasure that as soon as the said convicts, the several
persons composing the civil establishments, and the stores,
provisions, &amp;c., provided for their use shall be embarked on
board the Supply tender and the transport ships named in the
margin [Alexander, Scarborough, Lady Penrhyn, Friendship,
Charlotte, Prince of Wales, Golden Grove, Fishbourn], and be in
readiness to depart, that you do take them under your protection
and proceed in the Sirius with the said tender and transports to
the port on the coast of New South Wales situated in the latitude
of 33&#176; 41', called by the name of Botany Bay, agreeably to
the instructions you will be furnished with by the Commissioners
of our Admiralty, in pursuance of our Royal commands already
signified to them.<br>
<br>
And whereas it may happen upon your passage to New South Wales
that you may find it necessary and expedient to call with the
ships and vessels under your convoy at the Island of Teneriffe,
at the Rio di Janeiro, and also at the Cape of Good Hope, for
supplies of water and other refreshments for the voyage: It is
our further will and pleasure that you do, upon your arrival at
the former of those places, take on board any of the ships of the
convoy which you may think proper such quantities of wine as may
be requisite for the supply of the said settlement, according to
the instructions with which the Commissary of stores and
provisions will be furnished by the Commissioners of our
Treasury, taking care that the quantities purchased do not exceed
the proportions to be issued to several persons composing the
said settlement entitled thereto, agreeably to the said
instructions, for the time to which they have confined the supply
of that article; and for the amount of such purchases you will
direct the Commissary to draw bills of exchange upon them,
properly certified by you or our Lieutenant-Governor of the said
intended settlement, with the other usual attestations, that the
same has been obtained at the most reasonable rates, transmitting
at the same time an account thereof to them, in order that you
may be released from any imprest which such purchases might
occasion.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding there is already a considerable quantity of corn
and other seed grain put on board the ships of convoy, probably
more than may be immediately necessary for raising supplies for
the settlement, we are disposed to guard as much as possible
against accidents which may happen, or injuries which these
articles might sustain during the passage; it is therefore our
further will and pleasure that you, upon your arrival at any of
the places you may have occasion to touch at, endeavour to obtain
such further quantities of seed grain as you may think requisite
for the tillage of the land at the place of your destination; and
also that you do take on board any number of black cattle, sheep,
goats, or hogs, which you can procure, and the ships of the
convoy can contain, in order to propagate the breed of these
animals for the general benefit of the intended settlement,
causing the Commissary of Stores and Provisions to draw bills for
the same, as is before directed for such supplies, as well as for
any fresh provisions which it may be requisite to procure for the
use of the marines or convicts at those places, and transmitting
information to the Commissioners of our Treasury of such
proceedings.<br>
<br>
And whereas it is intended that several of the transport ships
and victuallers which are to accompany you to New South Wales
should be employed in bringing home cargoes of tea and other
merchandize from China, for the use of the East India Company,
provided they can arrive at Canton in due time, whereby a very
considerable saving would arise to the public in the freight of
these vessels: It is our royal will and pleasure that upon your
arrival at Botany Bay, on the said coast of New South Wales, you
do cause every possible exertion to be made for disembarking the
officers and men composing the civil and military establishments,
together with the convicts, stores, provisions, &amp;c., and
having so done you are to discharge all the said transports or
victuallers in order that such of them as may be engaged by the
East India Company may proceed to China, and that the rest may
return home. You will, however, take care, before the said
transport ships are discharged, to obtain an assignment to you or
the Governor-in-Chief for the time being, from the masters of
them, of the servitude of the several convicts for the remainder
of the times or terms specified in their several sentences or
orders of transportation.<br>
<br>
According to the best information which We have obtained, Botany
Bay appears to be the most eligible situation upon the said coast
for the first establishment, possessing a commodious harbour and
other advantages which no part of the coast hitherto discovered
affords. It is therefore our will and pleasure that you do,
immediately upon your landing, after taking measures for securing
yourself and the people who accompany you as much as possible
from any attacks or interruptions of the natives of that country,
as well as for the preservation and safety of the public stores,
proceed to the cultivation of the land, distributing the convicts
for that purpose in such manner, and under such inspectors or
overseers, and under such regulations as may appear to you to be
necessary and best calculated for procuring supplies of grain and
ground provisions. The assortment of tools and utensils which
have been provided for the use of the convicts and other persons
who are to compose the intended settlement are to be distributed
according to your discretion, and according to the employment
assigned to the several persons. In the distribution, however,
you will use every proper degree of economy, and be careful that
the Commissary do transmit an account of the issues from time to
time to the Commissioners of our Treasury, to enable them to
judge of the propriety or expediency of granting further
supplies. The clothing of the convicts, and the provisions issued
to them and the civil and military establishments, must be
accounted for in the same.<br>
<br>
And whereas the Commissioners of our Admiralty have appointed
Captain Hunter to repair on board the Sirius to assist you in the
execution of your duty, and to take the command of the ship
whenever you may see occasion to detach her from the settlement,
and also to station the Supply tender under your orders, and to
be assisting to you upon occasional services after your arrival:
And whereas it is our royal intention that measures should be
taken in addition to those which are specified in the article of
these our instructions for obtaining supplies of live stock, and
having, in consequence of such intention, caused a quantity of
arms and other articles of merchandize to be provided and sent
out in the ships under your convoy, in order to barter with the
natives, either in the territory of New South Wales or the
islands adjacent: It is our will and pleasure that, as soon as
either of these vessels can be spared with safety from the
settlement, you do detach one or both of them for that purpose,
confining their intercourse as much as possible to such parts as
are not in the possession or under the jurisdiction of other
European Powers.<br>
<br>
The increase of the stock of animals must depend entirely upon
the measures you may adopt on the outset for their preservation,
and as the settlement will be amply supplied with vegetable
productions, and most likely with fish, fresh provisions,
excepting for the sick and convalescents, may in a great degree
be dispensed with. For these reasons it will become you to be
extremely cautious in permitting any cattle, sheep, hogs,
&amp;c., intended for propagating the breed of such animals to be
slaughtered, until a competent stock may be acquired to admit of
your supplying the settlement from it with animal food, without
having further recourse to the places from whence such stock may
have originally been obtained.<br>
<br>
It is our will and pleasure that the productions of all
descriptions, acquired by the labour of the convicts, should be
considered as a public stock, which we so far leave to your
disposal that such parts thereof as may be requisite for the
subsistence of the said convicts and their families, or the
subsistence of the civil and military establishments of the
settlement, may be applied by you to that use. The remainder of
such productions you will reserve as a provision for a further
number of convicts, which you may expect will shortly follow you
from hence, to be employed under your direction in the manner
pointed out in these our instructions to you.<br>
<br>
From the natural increase of corn and other vegetable food from a
common industry, after the ground has once been cultivated, as
well as of animals, it cannot be expedient that all the convicts
which accompany you should be employed in attending only to the
object of provisions. And as it has been humbly represented unto
us that advantages may be derived from the flax plant, which is
found in the islands not far distant from the intended
settlement, not only as a means of acquiring clothing for the
convicts and other persons who may become settlers, but from its
superior excellence for a variety of maritime purposes, and as it
may ultimately become an article of export: It is therefore our
will and pleasure that you do particularly attend to its
cultivation, and that you do send home, by every opportunity
which may offer, samples of this article, in order that a
judgment may be formed whether it may not be necessary to
instruct you further upon this subject.<br>
<br>
And whereas We are desirous that some further information should
be obtained of the several ports or harbours upon the coast, and
the islands contiguous thereto within the limits of your
government, you are, whenever the Sirius or the Supply tender can
conveniently be spared, to send one or both of them upon that
service. Norfolk Island, situated in the latitude. . . . . and
longitude. . . . . . . . .east from Greenwich about. . . . . .
being represented as a spot which may hereafter become useful,
you are, as soon as circumstances will admit of it, to send a
small establishment thither to secure the same to us, and prevent
it being occupied by the subjects of any other European Power.
And you will cause any remarks or observations which you may
obtain in consequence of this instruction to be transmitted to
our Principal Secretary of State for Plantation Affairs for our
information.<br>
<br>
And whereas it may happen, when the settlement shall be brought
into some state of reflation, that the service of the Sirius may
not be necessary at the said settlement and as we are desirous to
diminish as much as possible the expenses which the intended
establishment occasions, you will, whenever the services of the
said ship can be dispensed with, order Captain Hunter to return
with her to England: And as from such an arrangement the
emoluments of your station will be diminished, it is our royal
intention that the same shall be made good to you by bills to be
drawn by you upon the Commissioners of our Treasury.<br>
<br>
You are to endeavour, by every possible means, to open an
intercourse with the natives, and to conciliate their affections,
enjoining all our subjects to live in amity and kindness with
them. And if any of our subjects, shall wantonly destroy them, or
give them any unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their
several occupations, it is our will and pleasure that you do
cause such offenders to be brought to punishment according to the
degree of the offence. You will endeavour to procure an account
of the numbers inhabiting the neighbourhood of the intended
settlement, and report your opinion to one of our Secretaries of
State in what manner our intercourse with these people may be
turned to the advantage of this colony.<br>
<br>
And it is further our royal will and pleasure that you do by all
proper methods enforce a due observance of religion and good
order among the inhabitants of the new settlement, and that you
do take such steps for the due celebration of publick worship as
circumstances will permit.<br>
<br>
And whereas, as from the great disproportion of female convicts
to those of the males who are put under your superintendence, it
appears advisable that a further number of the former should be
introduced into the new intended settlement, you are, whenever
the Sirius or the tender shall touch at any of the islands in
those seas, to instruct their commanders to take on board any of
the women who may be disposed to accompany them to the said
settlement. You will, however, take especial care that the
officers who may happen to be employed upon this service do not
on any account exercise any compulsive measures or make use of
fallacious pretences for bringing away any of the said women from
the places of their present residence.<br>
<br>
And whereas We have by our Commission bearing date [2 April,
1787] given and granted unto you full power and authority to
emancipate and discharge from their servitude any of the convicts
under your superintendence who shall for their good conduct and a
disposition to industry be deserving of favor: It is our will and
pleasure that in every such case you do issue your warrant to the
Surveyor of Lands to make surveys of and mark out in lots such
lands upon the said territory as may be necessary for their use,
and when that shall be done, that you do pass grants thereof with
all convenient speed to any of the said convicts so emancipated,
in such proportions and under such conditions and
acknowledgements as shall hereafter be specified, viz., To every
male shall be granted thirty acres of land, and in case he shall
be married twenty acres more, and for every child who may be with
them at the settlement at the time of making the said grant a
further quantity of ten acres, free of all fees, taxes,
quit-rents or other acknowledgements whatsoever, for the space of
ten years. Provided that the person to whom the said land shall
have been granted shall reside within the same and proceed to the
cultivation and improvement thereof, reserving only to us such
timber as may be growing or to grow hereafter upon the said land
which may be fit for naval purposes and an annual quit-rent of. .
. . . . after the expiration of the term or time before
mentioned. You will cause copies of such grants as may be passed
to be preserved, and make a regular return of the said grants to
the Commissioners of our Treasury and the Lords of the Committee
of our Privy Council for trade and plantations.<br>
<br>
And whereas it is likely to happen that the convicts who may
after their emancipation, in consequence of this instruction, be
put in possession of lands will not have the means of proceeding
to their cultivation without the public aid: It is our will and
pleasure that you do cause every such person you may so
emancipate to be supplied with such a quantity of provisions as
may be sufficient for the subsistence of himself and also of his
family for twelve months, together with an assortment of tools,
&amp;c., utensils, and such a proportion of seed, grain, cattle,
sheep, hogs, &amp;c., as may be proper and can be spared from the
general stock of the settlement. And whereas many of our subjects
employed upon military service at the said settlement, and others
who may resort thither upon their private occupations, may
hereafter be desirous of proceeding to the cultivation and
improvement of the land, and as we are disposed to afford them
every reasonable encouragement in such an undertaking, it is our
will and pleasure that you do, with all convenient speed,
transmit a report of the actual state and quality of the soil at
and near the said intended settlement, the probable and most
effectual means of improving and cultivating the same, and of the
mode and upon what terms and conditions, according to the best of
your judgment, the said lands should be granted, that proper
instructions and authorities may be given to you for that
purpose.<br>
<br>
And whereas it is our Royal intention that every sort of
intercourse between the intended settlement at Botany Bay, or
other place which may be hereafter established on the coast of
New South Wales and its dependencies, and the settlements of our
East India Company, as well as the coasts of China, and the
islands situated in that part of the world to which any
intercourse has been established by any European nation, should
be prevented by every possible means: It is our royal will and
pleasure that you do not, on any account, allow craft of any sort
to be built for the use of private individuals which might enable
them to effect such intercourse, and that you do prevent any
vessels which may at any time hereafter arrive at the said
settlement from any of the ports before-mentioned from having
communication with any of the inhabitants residing within your
government, without first receiving especial permission from you
for that purpose.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-49" id="ch-49"></a>3.22 GOVERNORS'
COMMISSIONS.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> charter granted to Sir Walter Raleigh in
1584, by which he was authorised to take possession of such
"remote, heathen, and barbarous lands, countries, and
territories" as he might discover, and to have, hold, occupy, and
enjoy the same, is the earliest document of the kind in English
history; <a href="#note-407" name="noteref-407" id=
"noteref-407">{1}</a> and from it might be traced, in historical
succession, all the Charters, Grants, Commissions, and Letters
Patent by which the Crown in later times vested powers of
colonial government in the hands of individuals. Sir Walter was
empowered to "correct, punish, pardon, govern, and rule "his
subjects" according to such statutes, lawes, and ordinances as
shall bee by him, the said Walter Raleigh, devised or established
for the better government of the said people: So always as the
said statutes, lawes, and ordinances may be, as neere as
conveniently may be, agreeable to the forme of the lawes,
statutes, government, or pollicie of England." This was, to all
intents and purposes, the sum and substance of the powers
conferred on Governor Phillip two centuries later.</p>
<p>In the Grant of the province of Maine to Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, made in 1639, and in the Charter for the province of
Pennsylvania granted to William Penn in 1681, the powers of
government conferred by the Crown were defined with much more
precision than they were in Raleigh's case. During the period
which elapsed between Raleigh's voyage of discovery and the
appearance of Gorges and Penn on the scene of colonisation, the
government of the colonies had been developed into an official
system; the grants and charters, drawn up when Coke and Bacon
were Crown Law Officers, became established precedents for later
cases: and their language, stripped of its antiquated
peculiarities, may be found in many State documents of modern
times. Thus there is no difficulty in tracing the pedigree, so to
speak, of the Commission issued to Governor Phillip up to the
American grants and charters of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. The identity of form and language is unmistakable. For
instance, the powers given to Phillip to levy, arm, and muster
forces for defence, to execute martial law, and to build
fortifications, may be seen in the Grant to Sir Ferdinando Gorges
in almost the same words. The historical interest of the subject
will justify the quotation of a passage from it for the purpose
of showing the resemblance between the two
documents&#8212;especially as it will serve to illustrate the
constitutional position occupied by Phillip:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>And because in a Country soe farr distant and seated
amongst soe many barbarous nations, the Incursions or Invasions,
as well of the barbarous people as of Pirates and other enemies,
maye be justly feared: Wee doe therefore give and grannte unto
the said Sir Ferdinando Gorges full power and authorite that he
shall or lawfullye maye muster, leavie, raise, arme, and employe
all persons inhabiteing or resideing within the said province for
the resisting or withstanding of such Enymies or Pyrates bothe
atte Landed and atte See, and such enymies or Pyrates (if
occasion shall require) to pursue and prosecute out of the lymits
of the said province, and them (if it shall soe please God) to
vanquishe, apprehende and take, and being taken, either,
according to the Lawe of Armes, to kill or to keep and preserve
them att his pleasure. <a href="#note-408" name="noteref-408" id=
"noteref-408">{2}</a></blockquote>
<p>This power appears in Phillip's Commission, issued two hundred
and fifty years afterwards, in much the same words:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>And Wee do hereby give and grant unto you the said
Arthur Phillip, by yourself or by your Captains or Commanders by
you to be authorised, full power and authority to levy, arm,
muster, and command and employ all persons whatsoever residing
within our said territory and its dependencies under your
government, and as occasion shall serve, to march from one place
to another, or to embark them, for the resisting and withstanding
of all enemies, pirates and rebels, both at sea and land, and
such enemies, pirates, and rebels, if there shall be occasion, to
pursue and prosecute in or out of the limits of our said
territory and its dependencies, and (if it shall so please God)
them to vanquish, apprehend, and take, and being so taken,
according to law to put to death or keep and preserve alive, at
your discretion.</blockquote>
<p>Phillip was thus armed with the same military powers as those
conferred on the proprietor of the province of Maine by a Charter
which, as Doyle <a href="#note-409" name="noteref-409" id=
"noteref-409">{3}</a> expresses it, gave him almost kingly power
over the territory.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-50" id="ch-50"></a>3.23 THE FIRST FLEET.
<small>[1787]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT KING'S MS</small>. Journal of the Voyage to
Botany Bay contains the following information with respect to the
ships composing the First Fleet:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The construction of a King's ship not being deemed
proper for this service, the Berwick store-ship was pitched on by
the Admiralty, and her name changed to the Sirius, so called from
the bright star in ye southern constellation of the Great Dog.
She had been purchased on the stocks by Government in 1781, and
was sent once to America as a store-ship during ye war, and once
after ye peace to ye West Indies; since which time she had lay'n
in ordinary at Deptford till named for this service, when she was
taken into dock and, as the Yard people said, thoroughly
overhauled; however, we have frequently had reason to think
otherwise in the course of our voyage.</blockquote>
<p>[Captain Hunter, in his Journal, p. 287, quotes the following
passage from King's Journal at Norfolk Island:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Of the Sirius, which was never more to return to the
Thames, he (King) tells the following anecdote:&#8212;"She was
built in the river for an east-country ship; and in loading her,
she took fire and was burnt down to her wales. The Government
wanting a roomy vessel to carry stores abroad, in 1781, purchased
her bottom, which was rebuilt with such stuff as, during the war,
could be found. She went two voyages as the Berwick store-ship;
and, without any repairs, she was reported, when the present
expedition was thought of, as fit for the voyage to New Holland,
when she was named the Sirius. Experience, however, evinced that
she was altogether adequate to the service for which she was
destined; and carried her crew safe through one of the most
tremendous gales, on a lee shore, that the oldest seamen
remembered."]<br>
<br>
The Supply, armed tender, of 170 tons, 8 guns, and 50 men
commanded by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, was formerly a navy
transport; her size is much too small for so long a voyage,
which, added to her not being able to carry any quantity of
provisions, and her sailing very ill, renders her a very improper
vessel for this service. The transports taken up for ye service
are as follows, as well as their complements of seamen, marines,
and convicts, embarked on board them at the time of our leaving
England:&#8212;<br>
<br>
Alexander, 452 tons. 30 seamen, 35 marines, 194 convicts; Lady
Penrhyn, 333 tons, 30 seamen, 3 officers of marines, 101 female
convicts; Charlotte, 335 tons, 30 seamen, 42 marines, 86 male and
20 female convicts; Scarboro', 430 tons, 30 seamen, 44 marines,
205 male convicts; Friendship, 274 tons, 25 seamen, 40 marines,
76 male and 21 female convicts; Prince of Wales, 350
tons,&#8212;seamen, 29 marines, 2 male and 47 female convicts;
Fishburn, victualler and agent's ship, of 378 tons, 22 men;
Golden Grove, ditto, of 375 tons, 22 men; Borradale, ditto, of
275 tons, 22 men.<br>
<br>
The terms of the contracts with the owners of the above ships are
ten shillings per ton per month till their arrival at Deptford
except the Lady Penrhyn, Charlotte, and Scarboro', which ships
are no longer in the service when they are cleared of their
cargoes at Botany Bay, and from that time their contract ceases
with Government and they begin a new one with the East India
Company, on whose account they go to China for a cargo of tea to
carry to England. Lieutenant Shortland of the navy has the
appointment of agent of transports, and is to return to England
with the other three transports and ye three store-ships the
instant the Governor has no further occasion for them.<br>
<br>
The transports are fitted up for the convicts the same as for
carrying troops, except the security, which consists in very
strong and thick bulk-heads, filled with nails and run across
'tween decks from side to side abaft the main-mast, with
loopholes to fire between decks in case of irregularities. The
hatches are well-secured down by cross-bars, bolts, and locks,
and are likewise railed round from deck to deck with oak
stanchions. There is also a barricade of plank about three feet
high abaft the main-mast, to prevent any connection between the
marines and ship's company with the convicts. Centinels are
placed at the different hatch-ways, and a guard always under arms
on the quarter-deck of each transport, in order to prevent any
improper behaviour of convicts, as well as to guard against any
surprize.<br>
<br>
Each transport has on board a certain quantity of each kind of
utensils proper for agriculture, as well as a distribution of
other stores for the colony, so distributed that an accident
happening to one ship would not have those disagreeable
consequences, which must be the case if the whole of one species
of stores was on board each ship. The victuallers are loaded with
two years' provisions of all species for the marines, convicts,
&amp;c., for two years from the time of their landing in New
South Wales.<br>
<br>
It was not till ye 11th of May that the Governor joined us, he
having been detained in town until the Ministry had arranged and
fixed the different orders settling a number of things incident
to ye great voyage we are about to undertake. On ye 12th the
ship's company was paid their two months' advance, and on the
same day we were joined by his Majesty's ship Hy&#230;na, Captain
De Courcy, who was ordered to proceed with us as far as Captain
Phillip might judge proper.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-51" id="ch-51"></a>3.24 BURKE ON TRANSPORTATION
TO AFRICA. <small>[1785]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> Parliamentary History for 1785 contains the
following reports of speeches on this subject:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. <small>BURKE</small> called the attention of the
House to the melancholy situation under which those unfortunate
people laboured who were sentenced with transportation. In a
country which prided itself on the mild and indulgent principles
of its laws, it should not be suffered that the situation of
particular delinquents, instead of being meliorated by provisions
dictated by clemency, should become infinitely more severe than
could be inflicted in the utmost rigour and severity of the laws.
The number of convicts under this description was at present
estimated at not less than 100,000. Every principle of justice
and humanity required that punishments should not be inflicted
beyond those prescribed and defined for particular kinds of
delinquency. But that principle received additional force when it
was considered that these extraordinary severities were exercised
under the appearance of mercy; that is to say, they were remitted
certain punishments by the mild spirit and principle of the
English laws; and received in commutation others, infinitely more
severe than the most rigid construction of the laws had in the
worst of cases designed for them. There was in the mode of
punishing by transportation no distinction between trivial crimes
and those of greater enormity; all indiscriminately suffered the
same miserable fate, however unequal their transgressions or
different their circumstances.<br>
<br>
Besides these considerations, some regard should, in these times
of difficulty and distress, be paid to frugality and economy. The
business of transporting convicts, among other conveniences, was
attended with a very considerable expense. Instances of profuse
expenditure were sometimes justifiable, when they had humanity
and clemency for their object; but could never derive any
sanction from cruelty and humanity. He wished to know what was to
be done with these unhappy wretches; and to what part of the
world it was intended by the Minister they should be sent. He
hoped it was not to Gambia, which, though represented as a
wholesome place, was the capital seat of plague, pestilence, and
famine. The gates of Hell were there open night and day to
receive the victims of the law; but not those victims which
either the letter or the spirit of the law had doomed to a
punishment attended with certain death. This demanded the
attention of the Legislature. They should in their punishments
remember that the consequences of transportation were not meant
to be deprivation of life; and yet in Gambia it might truly be
said, that there "all life dies, and all death lives." He would
wish, as a preliminary to something being done on the subject,
that the statue of the prisons, so far as respected persons under
sentence of transportation, were laid before the House; and this
he thought would come best by several motions, which, if
agreeable to the House, he should propose. Before he did this, he
wished to know whether any contract had yet been entered into for
sending these convicts to the coast of Africa. (He was answered,
no.)</blockquote>
<p>The Speaker remarked, that this motion came at somewhat too
short a notice; whereupon Mr. Burke withdrew it for the
present.</p>
<p>This discussion, which took place on the 11th March, was
followed by another on the 18th April in the same
year:&#8212;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>Lord <small>BEAUCHAMP</small> begged leave to remind
the House of an order that had been made at an early part of the
present session, and of which he was sorry to find no notice
whatever had been taken. The order to which he alluded was, that
a report should be made to the House relative to the manner in
which Government intended to dispose of felons under sentence of
transportation. He presumed the right hon. gentleman would inform
him when he conceived a return might be expected to the ordinary
question, as he intended to ground upon that return a motion
which he would submit to the House on a future day.<br>
<br>
Mr. <small>PITT</small> admitted the importance of the subject,
and stated as an excuse for the neglect of the order a very great
hurry of public business; he would, however, take care that the
return to it should be made with all possible dispatch. At the
same time he thought the noble lord would do well if he would
make the House acquainted at present with the nature of the
motion that he intended to propose on a future day.<br>
<br>
Lord <small>BEAUCHAMP</small> replied that as his motion would in
a great measure depend on the nature of the return, he could not,
until he should have seen that return, gratify the wish of the
right hon. gentleman. Some motion, however, would be absolutely
necessary. The transportation of felons had generally been to
places within the dominions of his Majesty; but, if report spoke
truth, Government had in contemplation to send them to the coast
of Africa, and to form a colony of them out of the British
territories. This appeared to him a subject well worthy of
inquiry.<br>
<br>
Mr. <small>BURKE</small> said that the design of sending the
felons to Africa was of a very serious nature; it would affect
not only the present unfortunate wretches who were under sentence
of transportation, but also future generations of convicts, if
the idea of colonising Africa with felons should be once adopted.
He could not reconcile it with justice, that persons whom the
rigour of the law had spared from death should, after a mock
display of mercy, be compelled to undergo it by being sent to a
country where they could not live, and where the manner of their
death might be singularly horrid; so that the apparent mercy of
transporting those wretched people to Africa might with justice
be called cruelty; the merciful gallows of England would rid them
of their lives in a far less dreadful manner than the climate or
the savages of Africa would take them.<br>
<br>
Mr. <small>PITT</small> interrupted Mr. Burke by observing that
he was assuming facts without any better authority than report;
he thought therefore it would be more proper for the right hon.
gentleman to wait till he should have seen the return called for
by the noble lord.<br>
<br>
Mr. <small>BURKE</small> said that though there was no question
actually under discussion, he was not of opinion that in anything
he had said he had been out of order. The situation of the felons
who were to be transported called for immediate attention: he
understood that seventy-five of them were now on board a ship
which might sail before morning, and the wind would soon carry
them out of the reach of the interposition of Parliament. He was
now appealing to the Minister for his interference; the King by
his coronation oath had bound himself to execute judgment in
mercy; and the right hon. gentleman was the trustee of his
Majesty's oath. There were, at the moment that he was speaking,
nests of pestilence in the country; the gaols were crowded beyond
measure; there was a house in London which consisted at this time
of just five hundred and fifty-eight members; he did not mean the
House of Commons (though the numbers were alike in both), but the
gaol of Newgate. They attended in their places much more
punctually than the members of the latter, and the reform in one
would not be less agreeable than a reform in the other.
Pestilence might be the consequence of so many persons being
crowded in one house; all the public safety, no less than a
humane regard to the individuals in question, called for the
interposition of Parliament.<br>
<br>
Here the business rested for the day.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-52" id="ch-52"></a>3.25 COLONISATION OF
AFRICA.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>INSTRUCTIONS</small> for the exploration of the east
coast of Africa were sent to the Admiralty from Whitehall, in a
letter dated 22nd August, 1785, as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>My lords,&#8212;The King having thought fit that a
part of the southern coast of Africa, at and near the entrance of
the River or Bay Des Voltas (28&#176; 29' S.), should forthwith
be explored, in order to fix upon a proper spot for making a
settlement on that coast, if such a measure should hereafter be
judged expedient, I am commanded to signify to your lordships his
Majesty's pleasure that you do instinct the officer commanding
his Majesty's ships employed for the protection of our
settlements in Africa, with the ships under his command, and as
soon after his arrival within the limits of his station, as your
lordships shall judge proper, to detach one of the said ships to
the said River or Bay of Des Voltas, directing her commander to
use every possible means in his power to obtain the best survey
or intelligence that he possibly can respecting the navigation at
the entrance of and in the said river or bay, as well as upon the
coast contiguous thereto, and to examine as minutely as
circumstances will admit the place and produce of the country,
the character and disposition of the inhabitants, and in general
to use his utmost diligence in gaining every sort of information
that may be requisite to be acquired previous to an attempt to
carry into execution a plan of the nature I have before alluded
to; and upon his return to England to transmit to me a particular
account of his proceedings for his Majesty's knowledge and
consideration.<br>
<br>
Your lordships will at the same time take especial care that the
commander of the ship to be sent on this service be particularly
instructed to avoid giving any sort of offence or cause of
complaint in the mode of conducting it, to the peaceable natives
or to European settlers, in case he should happen to meet any
such established upon that part of the coast.<br>
<br>
It would appear that the report brought back by the Nautilus from
the coast of Africa had the effect of preventing the despatch of
convicts already ordered for transportation thither. On the 11th
March, 1785, an Order had been made by the King-in-Council, under
the Act of the previous year relative to "the effectual
transportation of felons", directing that "the place to which the
said several convicts shall be conveyed or transported shall be
Africa." Another Order was made on the 27th April in the same
year, directing that certain convicts should be conveyed or
transported to America; but on the 13th May following a third
Order was made, which, after reciting that the previous order of
transportation to America could not be conveniently executed with
respect to the place to which the convicts were ordered to be
transported, appointed Africa as the place of their
destination.<br>
<br>
In connection with these Orders, it deserves mention that when
Burke uttered his protest in the House of Commons against any
transportation to Africa he was interrupted by Pitt, who observed
that he was "assuming facts without any better authority than
report", and advised him to wait until he had seen an official
return on the subject of the Government proposals for the removal
of felons. This discussion took place on the 18th April, 1785;
but it appears from the Orders referred to that Africa had
actually been appointed the place for transportation shortly
before that date, and again shortly after it. On the 5th March,
in the same year, the Attorney-General was requested to prepare a
draft Order appointing Africa to be the place to which convicts
should be transported; and also to advise whether the place of
transportation directed by the sentence could be changed by order
of the King-in-Council.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-53" id="ch-53"></a>3.26 ARTHUR PHILLIP.
<small>[1738-1814]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> a letter to Lord Sydney, dated 3 September,
1786, Lord Howe wrote as follows with reference to the
appointment of Captain Phillip:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>The benefit of the King's service being our common
object, I am persuaded, my dear lord, it will never suffer for
want of our ready concurrence when a necessary facility can be
rendered by us, on either part, to promote the advancement of it
on any occasion.<br>
<br>
In the present instance, the settlement of the convicts as you
have determined, being a matter so immediately connected with
your department, I could never have thought of contesting the
choice you would make of the officer to be entrusted with the
conduct of it.<br>
<br>
I cannot say the little knowledge I have of Captain Phillip would
have led me to select him for a service of this complicated
nature. But as you are satisfied of his ability, and I conclude
he will be taken under your direction, I presume it will not be
unreasonable to move the King for having his Majesty's pleasure
signified to the Admiralty for these purposes, as soon as you see
proper, that no time may be lost in making the requisite
preparations for the voyage.</blockquote>
<p>The following Anecdotes of Governor Phillip were published in
Phillip's Voyage, pp. 1-6:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Arthur Phillip is one of those officers who, like
Drake, Dampier, and Cook, has raised himself by his merit and his
services to distinction and command. His father was Jacob
Phillip, a native of Frankfort in Germany, who, having settled in
England, maintained his family and educated his son by teaching
the languages. His mother was Elizabeth Breach, who married, for
her first husband, Captain Herbert, of the navy, a kinsman of
Lord Pembroke. Of her marriage with Jacob Phillip was her son
Arthur, born in the parish of Allhallows, Bread-street, within
the city of London, on the 11th of October, 1738.<br>
<br>
Being designed for a seafaring life, he was very properly sent to
the school at Greenwich, where he received an education suitable
to his early propensities. At the age of sixteen he began his
maritime career under the deceased Captain Michael Everet, of the
navy, at the commencement of hostilities in 1755; and at the same
time he learned the rudiments of his profession under that able
officer, he partook with him in the early misfortunes and
subsequent glories of the Seven Years' War. Whatever opulence
Phillip acquired from the capture of Havannah, certain it is
that, at the age of twenty-three, he there was made a lieutenant
into the Stirling Castle, on the 7th of June, 1761, by Sir George
Pococke, an excellent judge of naval accomplishments.<br>
<br>
But of nautical exploits, however they may raise marine officers,
there must be an end. And Phillip now found leisure to marry and
to settle at Lyndhurst in the New Forest, where he amused himself
with farming, and, like other country gentlemen, discharged
assiduously those provincial offices which, however unimportant,
occupy respectably the owners of land, who, in this island,
require no office to make them important.<br>
<br>
But sailors, like their own element, are seldom at rest. Those
occupations, which pleased Phillip while they were new, no longer
pleased him when they became familiar, and he hastened to offer
his skill and his services to Portugal when it engaged in warfare
with Spain. His offer was readily accepted, because such skill
and services were necessary amidst an arduous struggle with too
powerful an opponent; and such was his conduct and such his
success that when the recent interference of France in 1778 made
it his duty to fight for his king and to defend his country, the
Portuguese Court regretted his departure, but applauded his
motive.<br>
<br>
His return was doubtless approved by those who, knowing his
value, could advance his rank, for he was made master and
commander in the Basilisk fireship, on the 2nd of September,
1779; but in her he had little opportunity of displaying his zeal
or of adding to his fame. This step, however, led him up to a
higher situation, and he was made post-captain into the Ariadne
frigate, on the 13th of November, 1781, when he was upwards of
three and forty. This is the great epoch in the lives of our
naval officers, because it is from this they date their rank. In
the Ariadne he had little time for active adventures or for
gainful prizes, being appointed to the Europe, of sixty-four
guns, on the 23rd of December, 1781. During the memorable year
1782, Phillip promoted its enterprises and shared in its glories.
And in January, 1783, he sailed with a reinforcement to the East
Indies, where superior bravery contended against superior force,
till the policy of our negotiators put an end to unequal
hostilities by a necessary peace.<br>
<br>
The activity or zeal of Phillip was now turned to more peaceful
objects. And when it was determined to form a settlement on that
part of New Holland denominated New South Wales he was thought of
as a proper officer to conduct an enterprise which required
professional knowledge and habitual prudence. His equipment, his
voyage, and his settlement in the other hemisphere will be found
in the following volume. When the time shall arrive that the
European settlers on Sydney Cove demand their historian, these
authentic anecdotes of their pristine legislator will be sought
for as curious, and considered as important.</blockquote>
<p>Some further anecdotes of Phillip, after his return to
England, may be found in the Adventures and Recollections of
Captain Landman, late of the Corps of Royal Engineers, 1852, vol.
i, p. 121:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>In the course of the same summer (1796) my
father&#8212;Professor of Fortification and Artillery to the
Royal Military Academy&#8212;paid me a short visit, and here had
the unspeakable pleasure of meeting his oldest and most intimate
friend. Captain Phillip, of the Royal Navy. At this time Captain
Phillip had been the first Governor of New South Wales, and
during a short time before his departure I was a midshipman of
his ship. Phillip pressed my father very much to entrust me to
his care during his meditated voyage to Botany Bay, assuring him
that I should never do any duty, nor should he trust me out of
his sight; but I was too young, and neither father nor mother
could be induced to part with me.<br>
<br>
Here, at Plymouth, Phillip commanded the Swiftsure, of
seventy-four guns, lying in Causand Bay, and he invited my father
and myself to go on board, taking with us Mrs. Phillip, a lady he
had recently married. On arriving at Mutton Cove, where the boat
was waiting to carry us off, the wind was so strong from
south-west, directly contrary, that no boat could have performed
the voyage; we therefore pulled away to a very small King's
lugger, I believe, called the Bull Dog, held always in readiness
to communicate with ships-of-war in Causand Bay; for there was do
breakwater in those days. We were under sail in a few minutes. It
took us some time to beat out so as to clear St. Nicolas' Island,
during which time the spray was continually flying over our
masts. On entering the open Sound our progress was exceedingly
slow, for although we were running perhaps six knots per hour,
yet we gained but little to windward; the sails were all close
reefed, yet the lee gunwale was ever under water. I had never
before been at sea, and although the waves were exceedingly high
and even one washing over us, I was not sick, nor was either my
father or Mrs. Phillip; but the Commodore, who had doubled every
cape, had navigated every sea, had been tossed by the severest
hurricanes, and, in short, had been longer on the seas than on
the land suffered in this way severely.<br>
<br>
Well I remember his little figure smothered up in his brown
camlet cloak lined with green baize, his face shrivelled, and
thin aquiline nose, under a large cocked hat, gathered up in a
heap, his chin between his knees, sitting under the lee of the
main-mast, his sharp and powerful voice exclaiming, "I cannot
bear this, I am as sick as a dog!"<br>
<br>
At length we arrived under the stern of the Swiftsure, when it
was evident we should have experienced considerable difficulty
had we attempted to go on board, so that Phillip having given
some orders to the first lieutenant, who was at the gangway, we
ran into Causand Bay, and there landed in a heavy surf. Here we
dined at a miserable public-house; but we had brought with us the
best excuse for very bad fare&#8212;a good appetite, caused by
beating to windward against a south-west gale with drizzling rain
for four hours. At an early hour we departed on foot, and walked
over Maker Heights, by the side of Mount Edgecomb, towards the
harbour, and on our way met an immense number of thin women
proceeding with the utmost expedition, whilst all those we
overtook, about equal in number, were large stout females,
evidently waddling along with difficulty. On seeing these,
Phillip explained that the latter were all wadded with bladders
filled with Hollands gin, which they manage to smuggle under
these dresses, whilst the others were thin and light, having
delivered their cargoes at the waterside. It is surprising how
such wholesale contraband should have been permitted, for
everybody knew the trade they were engaged in Plymouth dock was
at this period full of gaiety. Fore-street was almost crowded
with the officers of the navy and the army&#8212;the former
swimming in prize-money&#8212;whilst the dillys
(hackney-chariots) plying between Dock and Plymouth via
Stonehouse, at six-pence each person, or eighteen-pence for the
whole, were continually not only filled with sailors, but covered
with them, all anxious to expend large sums of money, which had
just been paid them in guineas, and which they were frequently
seen carrying about the streets in their hats under their arms. A
sailor in those days had no idea of saving up anything for the
future. His only thought was to get rid of his money, and to such
an extent was this desire for squandering it carried, that I
recollect being on board the Swiftsure with Captain Phillip when
a sailor carrying a pewter pint-pot in his hand nearly full of
guineas came to his captain on deck, and begged very earnestly to
be allowed to go on shore for the remainder of the day, in order
to expend his prize money. Phillip knew the man, and stiffly
refused his petition; the man soon reduced his demand to "one
hour on shore, if you please, dear captain, and I promise you
most sincerely to have then spent the last guinea."<br>
<br>
"No," replied Phillip, "I know you will not return but when
brought off by force", and quickly turned away towards the
cabin.<br>
<br>
The sailor again, hat in hand, followed his commanding officer,
begging for leave to go in the boat about to push off to the
shore, and assuring the captain he would remain within sight of
the officer in charge of the boat; still he was denied. "Then",
exclaimed the tar as he uttered a deep groan, "what's the use of
money if a man can't get leave to spend it?" and at the same
moment he dashed the pot and guineas overboard, and hastened away
to the forecastle without uttering another word.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-54" id="ch-54"></a>3.27 LETTERS FROM SYDNEY
COVE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>AMONG</small> the papers relating to New South Wales in
the Public Record Office is the following letter from Major Ross
to Nepean:&#8212;</p>
<p class="blok" align="right">Camp, Sydney Cove, 10 July,
1788.      </p>
<blockquote>My dear sir,<br>
<br>
I know not whether the Secretary of State expects I am to write
to him or not, but I suppose rather not, for as I came out
without any orders or instructions from your office with respect
to the intentions of Government, so I am still ignorant of it,
for the Governor has never told me, neither has he ever advised
or consulted with me on the subject; and I believe everybody else
are in the dark as well as myself. Should his lordship expect
letters from me, I hope you will think the above a sufficient
excuse; for I cannot see how I could write without informing him
of the manner in which the Governor treats me as
Lieutenant-Governor; and as to the detachment, they have just the
same cause for complaint that I have. This you will see cannot be
done without my letter coming in the form of a complaint, which I
by no means wish to be the case at this stage of the business,
but I will not answer for what may be the case hereafter; for,
take my word for it, there is not a man in this place but wishes
to return home; and indeed they have no less than cause, for I
believe there never was a set of people so much upon the parrish
as this garrison is, and what little we want, even to a single
nail, we must not send to the Commissary for it, but must apply
to his excellency; and when we do, he always sayes, "There is but
little come out", and of course it is but little we get, and what
we are obliged to take as a mark of favour.<br>
<br>
If you want a true description of this country, it is only to be
found amongst many of the private letters sent home; however, I
will in confidence venture to assure you that this country will
never answer to settle in; for altho' I think corn will grow
here, yet I am convinced that if ever it is able to maintain the
people here, it cannot be in less time than probably a hundred
years hence. I therefore think it will be cheaper to feed the
convicts on turtle and venison at the London Tavern, than be at
the expense of sending them here.</blockquote>
<p>A few months afterwards. Major Ross addressed the Under
Secretary in still stronger terms:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>My dear sir,<br>
<br>
I do not feel myself at all at ease with respect to you, as I
much fear you expect to hear from me by every ship which sails
from here. The truth of the matter is, that I have no one thing
to to communicate to you that can give you either pleasure or
satisfaction, for unless I attempted to give you a description of
this country, and of the hardships, mortifications and, I had
almost said, cruelties we are obliged to submit to, I have no
subject worth taking up your time with.<br>
<br>
From our Governor's manner of expressing himself, for he
communicates nothing to any person here but to his secretary
(Captain Collins) he has, I dare say, described this country as
capable of being made the empire of the east. But notwithstanding
all he may, from interested motives, say&#8212;and as this letter
is only for your own private perusal, I do not scruple to
pronounce, that in the whole world there is not a worse country
than what we have yet seen of this; all that is contiguous to us
is so very barren and forbidding that it may with truth be
said&#8212;here nature is reversed, and if not so, she is nearly
worn out, for almost all the seeds we have put in the ground has
rotted, and I have no doubt but will, like the wood of this vile
country when burned or rotten, turn to sand. This latter is a
fact that has been proved, and will, I much fear, be fatally felt
by some of its present inhabitants; I say the present, because if
the Minister has a true and just description given him of it, he
will not surely think of sending any more people here. If he
does, I shall not scruple to say that he will entail misery on
all that are sent, and an expense on the mother country that, in
the days of her greatest prosperity, she was not equal to, for
there is not one article that can ever be necessary for the use
of man, but which must be imported into this country. It is very
certain that the whole face of it is covered with trees, but not
one bit of timber have we yet found that is fit for any other
purpose than to make the pot boil. Of the general opinion
entertained here of the wretched prospect we have before us, I
cannot, I think, give you a more convincing proof than that every
person (except the two gentlemen already mentioned, whose
sentiments I am perfectly unacquainted with) who came out with a
design of remaining in the country, are now most earnestly
wishing to get away from it.<br>
<br>
You will, no doubt, see a copy of the return which I am going to
send to the Admiralty, as the Governor has requested it for your
office. It is a return of that part of the marine detachment that
wish to remain in this country, and the purposes for which they
wish to stay. I think this return (will) open people's eyes more
than a volume writ upon the subject would.<br>
<br>
There is an effort making for clearing some land for corn at the
head of this harbour. The party gone and to go are to be under
the care and protection of your old friend Campbell, who is to
have two officers and twenty marines with him. His perseverance
and attention to the forwarding the public service in general is
too well known to require my saying anything on that head, unless
it is to assure you that his abilities, ever since his arrival
here, has been constantly employed with the most sedulous
attention to the success of this settlement in particular; and
was I in a situation that would admit my doing it, I most
assuredly would make the Secretary of State acquainted with his
worth; but as that is not the case, I dare say you will think it
a justice due to any man&#8212;much more in the present instance,
for your old acquaintance, whom I am sure you wished to serve. I
flatter myself you will have pleasure in representing him as he
deserves, and possibly by that means procuring him that for which
he has served so long for.<br>
<br>
Marine Quarters, Sydney Cove,<br>
      16 November, 1788.</blockquote>
<p>Another letter to Nepean, written by the Rev. Richard Johnson,
and dated from Port Jackson, July 12, 1788, contains an allusion
to the general state of affairs in the settlement which may be
compared with Major Ross's description of it:&#8212;</p>
<p class="blok" align="right">Port Jackson, in the County of
Cumberland,      <br>
New South Wales, 12 July, 1788.</p>
<blockquote>Hond. sir,<br>
<br>
Though I have nothing particular to mention to you, I cannot
think of letting the Fleet return to England without droping you
a single line to inform you of my health and welfare. It would be
unnecessary for me, sir, to give you any account of the various
circumstances or incidences respecting the Fleet during our late
passage from England to this distant point of the globe, as no
doubt you will receive ample information respecting these
matters, together with a description of this country as to
climate, natives, &amp;c., &amp;c., from his excellency Arthur
Phillip, Esq., our Governor, and others.<br>
<br>
Everything here is as yet, as you may easily suppose, very
unsettled, but hope in time our situation will be rendered more
comfortable; and even now, all things considered, thank God, I
have no reason to complain.<br>
<br>
You may remember, sir, a circumstance which greatly interested
the publick a little before our leaving England. This was
respecting the Norwich gaoler and two contacts, Cabel and Holmes,
which, with a child, were removed from the Norwich Gaol to
Plymouth, in order to be embarked on board one of the transports
bound to New South Wales. These two persons I married soon after
our arrival here. Some persons made a charitable contribution for
these two persons; collected the sum of &#163;20, and laid this
out in various articles, at the same time requesting that I would
see this delivered to them upon our arrival here. Unfortunately
these have not been found. This circumstance has been brought
before the Civil Court here, when a verdict was found in their
favor against the Captain of the Alexander. Am sorry this
charitable intention and action has been brought to this
disagreeable issue, the more so because the publick seemed to be
so much interested in their welfare. The child is still
living&#8212;of a weakly constitution&#8212;but a fine boy.<br>
<br>
Hope, sir, you excuse my freedom in directing these few lines to
you&#8212;my chief intention, as I have already mentioned, being
to inform you of my health and welfare.<br>
<br>
Evan Nepean, Esq.</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Johnson had more "reason to complain" than any one
else in the settlement, seeing that he was left wholly unprovided
with the necessary means of conducting religious services and
attending to the wants of his congregation.</p>
<p>The following letter from an officer of marines to Sir Joseph
Banks forms part of the collection of documents relating to the
colony which came into the possession of Lord
Brabourne:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Having experienced a long though favourable voyage
from England, we arrived at Botany Bay on the 20th of January
last, where we expected to lay a foundation for a colony, but I
am sorry to say the country for several miles round the bay does
not afford a spot large enough for a cabbage garden, fit for
cultivation. The bay itself is beautiful and capacious, but open
to the south-east winds, which prevail there at a certain season.
It is surrounded with rocks, sandhills, and swamps, all which are
covered as thick as you can possibly imagine with trees and
underwood. You may easily suppose our disappointment was great in
having our sanguine hopes so soon frustrated. However, during our
dilemma, his excellency the Governor explored the coast to the
northward, and in a few days returned with the pleasing account
of having discovered the finest harbour in the world, viz., Port
Jackson, so named by Captain Cook. On the following morning we
quitted Botany Bay with pleasure, and anchored in Sidney Cove,
Port Jackson, in the evening of the same day.<br>
<br>
Port Jackson is without doubt the finest harbour in the known
world. It extends from 15 to 20 miles into the country, forming
beautiful bays and coves on every side, with deep water
everywhere for ships of any burden. Sidney Cove, which is the
seat of government, is 5 miles within the entrance of the
harbour. The country all round the harbour is similar to that of
Botany Bay, only more rocky, some few spots excepted, which may
admit of cultivation with a deal of labour. The soil is in
general sandy, and no freshwater river or spring has as yet been
discovered; still fresh water is found in many places, which is
only the overflowing of swamps, consequently cannot be very
wholesome. It has on our arrival here, and still does occasion
many complaints, such as dysentery and worms. The climate is fine
and temperate, and seems to be considerably influenced by the
moon, as we have a deal of thunder and lightning at every change
of that planet, besides torrents of rain. The lightning has done
some damage by killing all the sheep belonging to the
Lieutenant-Governor and others. We have had a great deal of rain
in the months of June, July, and part of August, which seem to
constitute the rainy season here.<br>
<br>
The country, as far as we know, produces few quadrupeds. The
largest is the kangaroo; they make use of their hind legs only in
jumping or escaping from their enemies. The female carries and
nurses its young in the pouch under its belly. The opossum is
next in size; they are easily tamed, and eat anything. There are
flying squirrels&#8212;a spotted animal of the cat kind, but
larger bodied&#8212;extremely destructive to fowls; and three
sorts of rats&#8212;the kangaroo rat, which partakes of that
animal; the flying rat, which by the assistance of its bushy tail
flies from tree to tree, which are numerous and very troublesome.
These are all the quadrupeds we have seen here yet except the
native dogs, some of which are large, and seem to be of the fox
kind.<br>
<br>
The birds are not so numerous as you would expect in a wild
country, but very beautiful in general, especially those of the
parrot kind. The ostrich is here, and the black swan; one of each
has been killed and several seen, besides many other birds, large
and small, which I cannot describe. Twelve miles from this
settlement I have shot wild ducks, pigeons, and quail.<br>
<br>
The country produces five or six kinds of trees, two of which
produce the same sort of gum, viz., a red astringent gum well
known in England. These gum-trees grow to an amazing size, but
are scarce worth cutting down. The only tree fit for building or
any other use is the fir-tree, and even that is bad. There are
here many shrubs, plants, and flowers totally unknown in Europe,
some of which have been used medicinally with success by our
surgeon, Mr. Considen, particularly the yellow gum, as a
substitute for balsam of tolu.<br>
<br>
There is neither ore nor mineral as yet found, except iron, which
is very common, and a small portion of copper.<br>
<br>
The natives do not appear numerous, but the most wretched of the
human race; they are dressed in nature's garb, subsist chiefly on
fish and roots we are unacquainted with; they inhabit chiefly the
cavities of rocks and trees; their miserable huts, which are few,
are constructed of the bark of trees. They do not wish to
cultivate our acquaintance or friendship; they are treacherous,
for they have murdered several of the convicts and one marine,
besides wounding many more; indeed, they attack every person they
meet unarmed, and appear civil to all those they meet armed; this
is what induces me to call them treacherous. They have spears
which they use in fishing and in assailing their enemies, besides
stone hatchets and chisels.<br>
<br>
The kangaroo is a very timid animal, incredibly strong for its
size, and can jump faster than a hare can run; its flesh is not
bad eating&#8212;something like coarse mutton.<br>
<br>
Having given you a sketch of the country, I shall leave you to
form your own opinion of it; at the same time I beg to give mine,
which is, that it will never answer the intentions of the
Government, for two reasons: first, because it is at too great a
distance from every trading country; and secondly, it will never
make any return to the mother country, nor can it support itself
independent of the mother country these twenty years. I could
adduce many other reasons beside these.<br>
<br>
I shall now say a few words about the internal management of
affairs in this country. About six weeks ago only, it was
fortunately discovered that there was not above eight months'
flour in the colony; the consequence was that a council was
convened, and the Sirius ordered to the Cape of Good Hope for a
supply of that necessary commodity, and the rations lessened; it
was likewise judged necessary by his excellency to order a
detachment of marines and convicts to a place about 14 miles
distant to cultivate the land, which is thought, by those who
pretend to understand it, to be better soil and easier of
cultivation than any nearer to us. However plausible this may
appear, still the detachment is not yet gone (a few convicts
excepted), and the season so far advanced that it is impossible
they can raise grain time enough to prevent the impending danger,
in case any accident should happen to the Sirius.<br>
<br>
An elegant brick house is built for the Governor, and another of
hewn stone for the Lieutenant-Governor. An hospital was begun on
our arrival here, and is not yet half finished, nor fit to
receive an object; two store-houses were bungled up, and are now
in a tottering condition. Private convenience is the chief study,
and I am sorry to add that neither order, mode, nor regularity
has appeared in any department in this colony. About four months
since every gentleman had a grant of two acres of land and a
labourer to clear and cultivate them. I can assure you that my
brother-officers and myself have been at a great deal of trouble
and expense to effect this, and now, when we were likely to reap
the fruit of our labour, the men are taken from us to be sent
with the detachment above mentioned, and I myself am ordered on
the same service. We have been here between nine or ten months,
and we are not as yet all hutted. You will hardly believe me when
I say that we ourselves have been obliged, for the want of
assistance, to cut thatch and wattles for our own huts; and now
that I have nearly completed mine I must quit it, and willingly
obey orders. I have lived in a marquee since I arrived here, and
am likely to continue it much longer. We have laboured
incessantly since we arrived here to raise all sorts of
vegetables, and even at this distant period we can barely supply
our tables, his excellency not excepted. This, together with the
miserable state of the natives and scarcity of animals, are
convincing proofs of the badness of the country. You will no
doubt have a flattering public account, but you may rely upon
what I have advised. Every gentleman here, two or three excepted,
concurs with me in opinion, and sincerely wish that the
expedition may be recalled.<br>
<br>
     Port Jackson, Nov. 18, 1788.</blockquote>
<p>To this letter is added a note by Sir Joseph Banks, in which
he said:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>N.B.&#8212;It would not be prudent to rely wholly
upon what this gentleman has advised, especially in that part of

<p>A letter from Surgeon White, in the same collection, was
published in an English newspaper, from which it was cut out and
pasted on a sheet of paper, with the following note in the
handwriting of Sir Joseph Banks:&#8212;"This letter was addressed
to Mr. Skill, dealer in hams, tongues, salt salmon, &amp;c., in
the Strand":&#8212;</p>
<p class="blok" align="right">Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, New
South Wales.    <br>
April 17, 1790.        </p>
<blockquote>Dear sir,<br>
<br>
His Majesty's ship Sirius and Supply tender sailed from hence the
6th of March last, with the Lieutenant-Governor, half the
marines, and about two hundred convicts, for Norfolk Island, and
landed them safe the 16th. This division of our numbers the
Governor thought necessary on account of the low state of our
provisions. The ships stood off and on until the 19th, before an
opportunity of landing the provisions and stores offered; then
the Sirius stood in as close as possible to hasten and facilitate
getting the things through a heavy surf, which continually rolls
in on the beach, but by a current, or some other unforeseen
cause, she was driven on a reef of hidden rocks and irrevocably
lost. The ship's bow is in a position which will probably make
her hold together until everything is got ashore, where all the
officers and men are safe, with a greater store of provisions
than we have here. Had the Sirius arrived safe, she was
immediately to have gone to China for some relief for us, and on
her despatch our all depended: but, alas! that hope is no more,
and a new scene of distress and misery opens to our view.<br>
<br>
When the Supply arrived with the melancholy tidings, the Governor
called all the officers together, to consult and deliberate on
what was best to be done in our present distracted and deplorable
situation. He laid before us the state of the provision store,
which contained only four months' flour, and three of pork at
half allowance, which has been our ration for some time past,
every other species of provision being long since expended. We
therefore determined on the necessity of reducing our half
allowance of those two articles to such a proportion as will
enable us to drag out a miserable existence for seven months.
Should we have no arrivals in that time the game will be up with
us, for all the grain of every kind which we have been able to
raise in two years and three months would not support us three
weeks, which is a very strong instance of the ingratitude and
extreme poverty of the soil and country at large; though great
exertions have been made.<br>
<br>
Much cannot now be done, limited in food and reduced as people
are, who have not had one ounce of fresh animal food since first
in the country; a country and place so forbidden and so hateful
as only to merit execration and curses; for it has been a source
of expence to the mother country, and of evil and misfortune to
us, without there ever being the smallest likelihood of its
repaying or recompensing either. From what we have already seen,
we may conclude that there is not a single article in the whole
country that in the nature of things could prove of the smallest
use or advantage to the mother country or the commercial
world.<br>
<br>
In the name of Heaven, what has the Ministry been about? Surely
they have quite forgotten or neglected us; otherwise they would
have sent to see what had become of us, and to know how we were
likely to succeed. However, they must soon know from the heavy
bills which will be presented to them, and the misfortunes and
losses which have already happened to us, how necessary it
becomes to relinquish a scheme that in the nature of things can
never answer. It would be wise by the first steps to withdraw the
settlement, at least such as are living, or remove them to some
other place.<br>
<br>
This is so much out of the world and tract of commerce that it
could never answer. How a business of this kind (the expence of
which must be great) could first be thought of without sending to
examine the country, as was Captain Thompson's errand to the
coast of Africa, is to every person here a matter of great
surprise. Mons. Peyrouse and Clonard, the French
circumnavigators, as well as us, have been very much surprised at
Mr. Cook's description of Botany Bay. The wood is bad, the soil
light, poor, and sandy, nor has it anything to recommend it.
Accurate observers have surveyed the country without being able
to see anything like the meadow land that Mr. Cook and others
mention. The Frenchmen declare the same, and that in the whole
course of their voyage they never saw a place half so unpromising
for a settlement as this. They laid at Botany Bay eight weeks,
just after their arrival in the country, repairing some damages
which the Boussole and Astrolabe under their command received
while at the Navigators' Islands. Before they came to Botany Bay
they had been at Norfolk Island, but could neither anchor nor
land. They made an observation with respect to it which, from its
singularity, propriety, and force I cannot suppress, that it was
only a place fit for angels and eagles to reside in.<br>
<br>
The Supply tender sails to-morrow for Batavia, in hopes the Dutch
may be able to send in time to save us. Should any accident
happen to her. Lord have mercy on us! She is a small vessel to
perform so long and unexplored a voyage, but we rely much on the
abilities and active attention of Lieutenant Ball, who commands
her. Lieutenant King, 2nd of the Sirius, takes his passage in her
to Batavia, and from thence to the Cape of Good Hope (in his way
to Europe), where he has orders to charter a ship and send her to
us immediately, should no other ships have passed that place in
their way here.<br>

<p>Under the usual heading "Botany Bay", another letter from
Sydney Cove, dated April 14, 1790, appeared in an English
newspaper, from which it was cut out and pasted on a sheet of
paper, indorsed in the handwriting of Sir Joseph
Banks&#8212;"Oracle, April 25, 1791"&#8212;that being the name of
the newspaper and the date of publication. It was
headed&#8212;"Extract of a letter from an Officer, dated Port
Jackson, New South Wales, April 14, 1790."</p>
<blockquote>By the time this reaches you, the fate of this
settlement and all it contains will be decided. It is now more
than two years since we landed here, and within less than a month
of three since we left England. So cut off from all intercourse
with the rest of mankind are we that, subsequent to the month of
August, 1788, we know not of any transaction that has happened in
Europe. The little European knowledge that we are masters of, we
picked out of old English newspapers which were brought from the
Cape of Good Hope about a twelvemonth back in the Sirius. But
great as our anxiety is on this head, it falls short of what we
suffer on another account. The dread of perishing by famine
stares us in the face; on the day I write we have but eight
weeks' provision in the public stores, and all chance of a
reinforcement under seven months is cut off, unless ships from
England should yet, notwithstanding the lateness of the season,
come in upon us.<br>
<br>
To add to our misfortunes, the Sirius (one of the two
ships-of-war on this station) was totally and irretrievably lost
on Norfolk Island the 19th of last month. The particulars of this
trying calamity I cannot at present spare time to write, but I am
happy to say that Captain Hunter and all the rest of her crew
were saved with difficulty. She had left us for Norfolk Island in
the beginning of the month, and carried to that place the
Lieutenant-Governor, half the battalion of marines, and two
hundred convicts, whom it was thought advisable to send there, in
order that we may be as variously dispersed in the approaching
crisis to procure food as possible. Had the Sirius returned
safely here, it was intended to have dispatch'd her immediately
to China to load with provisions for the colony. All that can now
be done is to dispatch the Supply, a little brig commanded by a
lieutenant of the navy, to Batavia, where she is, if possible, by
offering any price, to procure a large ship and load her with
relief for us. Our present allowance is a short one&#8212;2 lb.
of pork, which was cured four years ago, and shrinks to nothing
if boiled; 2&#189; lb. of flour, 1 lb. of rice, and 1 lb. of
pease per week, is what we live upon. If Heaven be but favorable
to the voyage of the Supply (and, thank God, she is as ably
commanded and navigated as any ship in the King's service) all
things will yet do; for when I spoke of only eight weeks'
provisions in the stores I meant at full allowance, whereas what
we have at present is but a third.<br>
<br>
Again, to help us out we use every means to get fish, and
sometimes with good success, which is an incredible relief. On
the fishing service the officers, civil and military, take it in
turns every night to go out for the whole night in the
fishing-boats; and the military besides keep a guard at Botany
Bay and carry on a fishery there, taking it three days and three
days, turn and turn about Were the ground good, our gardens would
be found of infinite use to us in these days of scarcity, but
with all our efforts we cannot draw much from them. As to parade
duties and show we have long laid them aside, excepting the
mounting a small guard by day and a picquet at night. Our
soldiers have not a shoe, and mount guard barefoot.<br>
<br>
Among other letters which I write by this opportunity is a very
long one to the. . . . in which I have very fairly and freely set
down my opinion about this country. The following passage, which
I extract for your satisfaction, will, I hope, impress his
lordship strongly with the idea of giving his opinion for
abandoning the colony should he ever be consulted on the
occasion, or should it at any time become matter of parliamentary
debate:&#8212;<br>
<br>
<small>The country, my lord, is past all dispute a wretched
one&#8212;a very wretched&#8212;and totally incapable of yielding
to Great Britain a return for colonising it. There is no wood fit
for naval purposes; no fibrous grass or plant from which cordage
can be made; no substance which can aid or improve the labours of
the manufacturer; no mineral productions; no esculent vegetable
worth the care of collecting and transporting to other climes;
and lastly, which is of the most serious consideration, no
likelihood that the colony will be able to support itself in
grain or animal food for many years to come: so that a regular
annual expense is entailed on the mother country as long as it
shall be kept.</small><br>
<br>
Besides this, I have given his lordship every other piece of
information relative to our government, management of the
convicts, and knowledge of the natives, in my power.</blockquote>
<p>The following letter, written by an officer of the Sirius to a
friend in Chelsea, is indorsed "Chelsea letter" in Sir Joseph
Banks's handwriting. The person to whom it was addressed sent it
for publication with an introductory note, dated "Chelsea,
December 31, 1790", in which he described his correspondent as "a
very worthy and intelligent young man, who left England as an
officer in his Majesty's ship Sirius." Like the other letters
from Sydney in Sir Joseph's collection, it appears in the shape
of a newspaper cutting pasted on a sheet of paper:&#8212;</p>
<p class="blok" align="right">Outposts, Port Jackson, April 14,
1790.   </p>
<blockquote>Ever honoured and dear sir,<br>
<br>
My warmest and most affectionate good wishes are herewith bound
to yourself, my dear aunt and cousins. Glad I am to have an
opportunity of conversing with friends whom I so much esteem; but
you will join with me in thinking the circumstances that furnish
it untoward.<br>
<br>
I bless God, though unfortunate, we have enough for which to be
thankful. But before I mention the grand catastrophe, I will just
trace back the steps that led to it. We have long waited here in
vain expectation of receiving a supply of provisions, &amp;c.,
from England, but nothing has as yet arrived. The consequence is
that the allowance has, for half a year past, been diminished
from time to time; and lately to such a degree as to be most
sensibly felt by all. Were we at a full quantity, our food, from
being so long in store, affords but little nutriment. We are now
at less than half allowance, and some articles of diet are
deficient, having been consumed. We are now on the brink of going
three on one man's dividend; and a few weeks must, if nothing
arrives, put us on a quarter allowance. The consequence of this
we shall not dwell on; but it is certain that any moderate man,
on full allowance, especially if laborious, has but little left
when provisions becomes due. After waiting so long that the
general hopes began to diminish, the Governor thought proper in
this emergency to send Major Ross, Commandant of marines, with
many officers, privates, and common people of both sexes, to
Norfolk Island, with a proportionable part of the remaining
provision. This, I believe, was done because of the more thriving
soil at Norfolk, and on account of fish being there in greater
plenty.<br>
<br>
We have for near three months had a look-out kept here for ships
towards the sea. The flagstaff is situated on very high land,
being the south head of the harbour, just by the entrance, and
the huts in which we reside are close adjacent. For the first
four or five weeks, a commissioned officer and midshipman were
stationed here with a party of men; but on the ships being
ordered for sea, or rather before that time, his excellency was
pleased to direct that this charge should devolve upon myself and
the gunner jointly.<br>
<br>
When all things were adjusted, they embarked on board the Sirius
and Supply; they left this port on the 6th of March, 1790, and I,
from the flagstaff, followed them with my eyes till out of sight.
Nothing more of them was seen till April the 5th instant, when
the man who takes his station there at daybreak soon came down to
inform me that a sail was in sight. On going up, I saw her coming
in with the land, and judged it to be the Supply; but was not a
little surprised at her returning so soon; and likewise being
alone. My mind fell to foreboding an accident; and on going down
to get ready for waiting on the Governor, I desired the gunner to
notice whether the people mustered thick on her decks, as she
came in under the headland; thinking in my own mind, what I
afterwards found, that the Sirius was lost.<br>
<br>
The Supply brought an account that on the 19th of March, about
noon, the Sirius had, in the interval of loading the boats,
drifted rather in with the land; on seeing this, they of course
endeavoured to stand off; but the wind being dead on the shore,
and the ship out of trim, and working unusually bad in staying
(for she would not go about), just as she was coming to wind she
tailed the ground with the after part of the keel; and with two
sends of the vast surf that runs there, was completely thrown on
the reef of dangerous rocks called Point Ross. In this last
extremity, they luckily let go both anchors and stopped the
cables securely, and this, though it failed of the intention of
riding her clear, yet caused her to go right stern foremost on
the rocks; by which means she lay with her bow opposed to the
sea&#8212;a most happy circumstance! for had she lain broadside
to&#8212;which otherwise she would have had a natural tendency to
have done&#8212;it is more than probable she must have overset,
gone to pieces, and every soul have perished. Her bottom bulged
immediately, and the masts were soon cut away: and the gallant
ship, upon which hung the hopes of the colony, was now a complete
wreck. They brought a few of the officers and men hither: the
remainder of the ship's company, together with Captain Hunter,
&amp;c., are left there, on account of constituting a number
adequate to the provisions, and partly to save what they possibly
can from the wreck. I understand there are some faint hopes, if
favoured with extraordinary fine weather, to recover most of the
provisions; for she carried a great quantity there, on the part
of the reinforcement. The whole of the crew were saved to a man,
by God's mercy, most providentially, on a coast so dangerous as
to give but small hopes of escaping on such an occasion; every
exertion being used, and all assistance received from the Supply
and the colonists on shore.<br>
<br>
The passengers fortunately landed before the accident; and I will
just mention to you the method by which the crew were
saved:&#8212;When they found that the ship was ruined, and giving
way upon the beam light athwart, they made a rope fast to a drift
buoy, which by the surf was driven on shore. By this a stout
hawser was conveyed, and those on shore made it fast a good way
up a pine-tree; the other end being aboard was hove taught. On
this hawser was placed the heart of a stay (a piece of wood with
a hole through it), and to this a grating was flung, after the
manner of a pair of scales. Two lines were made fast on either
side of the heart&#8212;one to haul it on shore, the other to
return it on board. On this kind of frame the shipwrecked seated
themselves, two or more at a time, and thus were dragged on shore
through a sad dashing surf, which broke frequently over their
heads, keeping them a considerable time under water. Some of them
in coming on shore were half drowned and a good deal bruised.
Captain Hunter was considerably hurt, and with repeated seas
knocked off the grating, insomuch that all lookers on feared
greatly for his letting go; but he got on shore safe, and his
hurts are by no means dangerous. Many private effects were saved
by the seas driving them on shore when thrown overboard; but it
was not always so courteous. Much is lost, and many escaped with
nothing more than they stood in.<br>
<br>
But for this ill-hap it was intended to have sent the Sirius to
China immediately on her return for provisions. The Supply,
however, is getting ready with all expedition for sea. She is, if
convenient, to touch at Norfolk Island on the way to receive the
first lieutenant, who is to have the charge of bringing hither
whatever vessels may be taken up, but not for this or any other
purpose to make any long delay, for the errand she goes upon is,
as you perceive, of the last importance.<br>
<br>
Batavia is the port to which they are first bound; if a ship or
ships cannot be got there, they will proceed to China or the
Cape, possibly both; and if at the latter no news is heard of any
that have sailed on their way to New Holland, or in case they
have, and yet there is reason to judge, from the time, &amp;c.,
that something fatal had befallen them, they must then take up a
very capital concern on Government account, which, at this rate,
must exceed six months. But we must hope for something sooner, or
this may come too late.<br>
<br>
It is one satisfaction, amidst this gloomy state of things, to
see prudent measures pursued in order to avert, as much as
possible, the present and impending evils. Private stock, of
which, by-the-bye, there is but little, is purchased on the
public account, and served in lieu at the store. Seed and every
proper encouragement is now given to those who will industriously
cultivate the ground. There are several spots laid out for
raising vegetables, and these are designed for a public concern.
I am sorry to observe that the most useful productions, such as
grain, thrive very indifferently; but they have some spots at a
little settlement up the harbour, called Rose Hill, where things
thrive tolerably well, but altogether quite inadequate to the
purpose of public subsistence. 'Tis true most of the settlers
have each a cultivated spot, but vegetables, if put wholly to it,
are but a flimsy diet, and here they are by no means in lavish
abundance. The boats, let who will own them, are all sent to
fishing for the community; fish being served out as pork, only in
larger proportion, by way of making the provisions hold out
People are also appointed to go into the woods after kangaroos,
but this is rather a precarious supply, and seldom turns to much
account But all helps, and if it was less 'twere worthy the
trying for.<br>
<br>
The duty of the people is by the Governor's consideration
lessened, in proportion to their stinted allowance, and they have
every afternoon to themselves for attending to the main
concern&#8212;how to subsist. His excellency has kindly taken
into his mess those of the officers who were shipwrecked; and his
disinterested conduct in sharing the public inconveniences merits
every encomium.<br>
<br>
Early and late do I look with anxious eyes toward the sea; and at
times, when the day was fast setting and the shadows of the
evening stretched out, I have been deceived with some fantastick
little cloud, which, as it condensed or expanded by such a light,
for a short time has amused impatient imagination into a
momentary idea that it was a vessel altering her sail and
position while steering in for the haven; when, in an instant, it
has assumed a form so unlike what the mind was intent upon, or
has become so greatly extended, as fully to certify me of its
flimsy texture and fleeting existence.<br>
<br>
Surely our countrymen cannot altogether have forgotten us, or
have been vainly led by any silly, sanguine representations from
hence, to trust that we could make it out tolerably well without
their assistance.<br>
<br>
The occasions that call me to town are only sometimes to draw
provisions, which is done weekly. On these occasions I generally
dine out; for in our visitings it has long been the custom to put
your bread at least in your pocket; and the usual form of
salutation is, "Will you bring your bread and come and see me?"
The Governor too, on whom I always wait when up at Camp, usually
detains me to dine with him. D.S.</blockquote>
<p>A footnote to this letter informs us that the writer's name
was Daniel Southwell; and another note, written by the person to
whom the letter was sent, contained an extract from a former
letter written by Southwell, in which he described the entrance
of the First Fleet into Port Jackson:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Soon after (in January, 1788) we had sight of the
harbour, and at 4 p.m. were in the entrance between the north and
south heads, the ships all standing after us. At length we saw
the Supply, seemingly up in the woods amongst the trees,
occasioned by the meandering windings of this beautiful harbour,
and before sunset the whole of our fleet were safely anchored
near our consort, in a most commodious reef known as Sidney
Cove.</blockquote>
<p>To this note was added the following description of Port
Jackson:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Though the party who had made a prior visit to this
place were so warm in their praises as to draw upon themselves
the charge of exaggeration, it must be confessed they did no more
than justice to its merits. As a place for shipping it is
perfectly landlocked, and has several capital arms furnished with
many inlets, coves, and bays, where whole fleets might lay in
safety. with good water under them and fine holding ground at the
bottom. Indeed nothing can be conceived more picturesque than the
appearance of the country while running up this extraordinary
haven. The land on all sides is high and covered with an
exuberance of trees. Toward the water, craggy rocks and vast
declivities are everywhere to be seen. The scene is beautifully
heightened by a number of small islands dispersed here and there,
on which, with a little help of the imagination, you discover
charming seats and verdant vistas, superb buildings, grand ruins
of stately edifices. &amp;c., which, as we passed, were only
visible at intervals, the view being every now and then agreeably
interrupted by the intervention of some proud eminences, or lost
in the labyrinths of the groves that so abound in this
fascinating scenery. The novelty of this picture was still
increased by the frequent appearance of the natives, who now and
then, posting themselves high on the rocks upon some conspicuous
overhanging cliff, would brandish their spears as though to
dispute our passage. There was a something frantick in the manner
of these petty veterans, their menacing gestures being
occasionally interrupted by long considerings and excessive fits
of laughter, in which there seemed to be more of agitation than
of those pleasing emotions that usually excite
risibility.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-55" id="ch-55"></a>3.28 DESERTED COLONIES.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> 1581, a powerful armament was fitted out by
Phillip the Second of Spain, for the purpose of fortifying
certain points on the shores of the First Angostura, or narrows,
in the Straits of Magalhanes, in order to guard the passage
against English ships, and also for the purpose of founding a
colony there. At that time the Straits were regarded as the key
of the Pacific Ocean, the passage round Cape Horn not being then
known to navigators. Twenty-three ships were equipped for the
expedition, and three thousand five hundred men were put on
board, including many artificers, with large stores of ammunition
and ordnance. The fleet was formed into three divisions, one of
which was to proceed to Chili, and a second to Brazil, while the
third was to remain in the Straits, under the Command of Pedro
Sarmiento, at whose suggestion the enterprise had been
undertaken. The whole fleet was directed to sail in company to
the Straits for the purpose of assisting Sarmiento in planting
the intended colony. The ships sailed from Seville in September,
but a succession of disasters reduced their number to such an
extent that only five of them, with five hundred and thirty
persons on board, entered the Straits in February, 1584. One of
the ships ran aground and was wrecked there, while three of the
others sailed away in the night-time for Spain, leaving Sarmiento
with only one ship, four hundred men, and thirty women, with
provisions for eight months. The foundations of two
towns&#8212;named Nombre de Jesus and San Felipe&#8212;having
been laid, Sarmiento sailed for Brazil in order to obtain
supplies. Still pursued by misfortune, his ship was driven on the
coast and wrecked, while another vessel which he had chartered
and loaded with provisions for the colony was unable to reach the
Straits. Sarmiento then sailed for Spain, and the colonists were
left to their fate&#8212;which is thus described in Burney's
History of the Discoveries in the South Sea, vol. ii, p.
68:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>January the 6th [1586] Mr. Cavendish [an Englishman
who had fitted out three small ships for a buccaneering cruise
against the Spaniards] arrived at the entrance of the Straits of
Magalhanes, and in the evening anchored with his squadron near
the First Angostura. During the night, lights were observed on
the north shore, which were supposed to be intended as signals to
the ships, and lights were shown in answer. The next morning the
General went in a boat to the northern side of the Strait, and as
the boat ran along by the land three men were seen on shore, who
made signals by waving a white flag. The General stood in, and
when the boat drew near the men on shore enquired in the Spanish
language to what country the ships belonged. These men were
Spanish soldiers, part of the garrison that had been brought from
Europe by Sarmiento to guard the Strait. The General, who had
received information, before he left England, of the distressed
condition of the Spaniards in this part of the world, and which
no doubt was confirmed by the appearance of these men, ordered
one of his people, who understood the Spanish language, to tell
them that the ships were English; but that if they chose to
embark with him he would carry them to Peru. The Spaniards, on
hearing to what nation the people in the boat belonged, said they
would not trust themselves with the English for fear that they
should be thrown overboard. The Englishman answered that they
might safely embark, for the English were better Christians than
the Spaniards. After this dialogue, the Spaniards resolved to
abide by their own determination; but, after a short consultation
among themselves, they agreed in opinion that it could not be
worse to trust the English than to stay where they were certain
to perish. They accordingly called after the boat, which returned
to the shore, and one of the Spaniards stepped into her. The
General enquired of him what other Spaniards were on shore, and
was answered, that besides the three that he had seen there were
fifteen more (twelve men and three women). The General then
desired that two soldiers. the companions of him who had
embarked, should be instructed to go to the other Spaniards and
inform them that if they desired to leave the place they should
come to the shore nearest the ships and he would receive them all
on board. With this message the two soldiers departed, and the
boat left the shore.<br>
<br>
When the General arrived on board he found the wind favourable
for advancing up the Strait; upon which, without any waiting, he
ordered the anchors to be taken up, and the ships immediately
sailed forward, leaving the wretched remains of the Spanish
colony with this cruel disappointment added to their other
miseries, and utterly abandoned of man&#8212;both friend and
foe.<br>
<br>
The Spaniard who was received into the English ships was named
Tom&#233; Hernandez. From a public declaration which he made many
years afterwards has been received all that is known of the
history of this neglected colony subsequent to the departure of
Sarmiento from the Strait. The following is a summary of the
account given by Hernandez:&#8212;<br>
<br>
The Spanish settlers were landed from the ships in February,
1584. In the latter part of May, their General was forced out of
the Strait by a gale of wind, and there remained no vessel with
the colony. In August, the Spaniards who had been left at Nombre
do Jesus judged it necessary to quit that station and to remove
to the town of San Felipe, to which place they travelled by land,
but sustenance for so many people could not be obtained at San
Felipe: and Captain Andres de Viedma, who commanded after the
departure of Sarmiento, sent two hundred men back to Nombre de
Jesus, who had no other means to support themselves in the
journey than by seeking for shell-fish along the coast. Many died
during the winter. The ensuing spring and summer were passed in
constant and anxious expectation of the return of Sarmiento, and
of receiving relief from the Spanish colonies in South America;
but neither Sarmiento nor relief of any kind arrived. When the
summer was far advanced, Viedma, who remained with the people at
the town of San Felipe, caused two small barks to be built, in
which he embarked with all the people who were then living at
that place, being fifty-five in number&#8212;fifty men and five
women. (Hernandez has described the time so indistinctly that it
appears uncertain whether this event took place in the beginning
of 1585 or of 1586.)<br>
<br>
They set sail towards the eastern entrance of the Strait; but
when they proceeded only six leagues from San Felipe, one of the
barks was cast on the rocks and wrecked. This accident was
entirely occasioned by there not being among them any mariners
who could manage the vessel. The people got from the wreck safe
to the land, but the remaining bark was not large enough to carry
the whole; and this loss, with their want of a stock of
provisions sufficient for a sea voyage, made them for the present
relinquish the project of quitting the Strait. To increase the
means of subsistence, it was determined to separate the people
into small divisions. About twenty returned to San Felipe: the
remainder spread themselves in small parties along the coast.
Some ground had been cleared and sown with grain; but their
agricultural attempts were not productive. Pretty, in his account
of the voyage of Mr. Cavendish, has related that during the time
the Spaniards were in the Strait "they could never have anything
to grow or in anywise prosper, and on the other side, the Indians
preyed on them." It is probable that the natives, with whom the
Spaniards were not upon friendly terms, destroyed their crops and
prevented their deriving assistance from the cultivation of the
ground.<br>
<br>
A short time before the arrival of the vessels of Mr. Cavendish,
all who remained living of the parties along the coast, and of
the people of San Felipe, joined; their number being reduced by
hunger and sickness to eighteen (fifteen men and three
women).<br>
<br>
In the town of San Felipe, many lay dead in their houses, and
even in their clothes, those who were left alive not having
strength or spirits to bury their deceased companions. The town
at length became so tainted that the survivors could not longer
remain in it. Some among them proposed that they should attempt
to go by land to the River de la Plate; but the smallness of
their number, their exhausted strength, and the danger of finding
the natives everywhere hostile, were objections to this plan; and
the majority trusting to the arrival of some ship for their
deliverance, it was therefore agreed to travel to the first
settlement (Nombre de Jesus). In their journey along the coast,
they passed many dead bodies of their countrymen who had perished
in seeking for subsistence, or in travelling from one to the
other settlement, and some who had been killed by the
natives.</blockquote>
<p>The history of the French colony sent out in 1763 to Cayenne
(French Guiana) forms another illustration of the same kind.
"Chois&#232;ul, the Prime Minister, having obtained for himself
and his cousin Praslin a concession of the country between the
Kourou and the Marone, sent out about twelve thousand volunteer
colonists, mainly from Alsace and Lorraine [which had been ceded
to France in 1697]. They were landed at the mouth of the Kourou,
where no preparation had been made for their reception, and where
even water was not to be obtained. The necessary tools for
tillage were wanting. By 1765, no more than nine hundred and
eighteen colonists remained alive, and these were a famished,
fever-stricken band. A long investigation by the Parliament of
Paris proved only that some one had
blundered."&#8212;Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. Guiana.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-56" id="ch-56"></a>3.29 FROM PITTWATER TO SYDNEY
IN 1789.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"<small>IN</small> the morning of the 13th [July], as
we intended to land well up this branch [Pittwater] in order to
avoid the most difficult and tiresome part of the road to Port
Jackson, we embarked after we had breakfasted and rowed up about
a couple of miles, when the party for walking went on shore, each
with his arms and knapsack containing two days' provisions. We
were about half an hour in getting through the wood which led to
the sea-coast, where we fell into our own and well-known path,
and by four o'clock in the afternoon arrived at the north part of
Port Jackson; but we might as well have been fifty leagues off,
for here we could have no communication either with the Sirius or
the settlement, and no boat had been ordered to meet us. We went
immediately to work and made a large fire, by which we lay all
night, which happened to be very cold.<br>
<br>
"The next day we crossed the hills and came to the mouth of the
north-west harbour, but could not find the means of crossing it;
muskets had been frequently fired during the night in hopes that
some boat might have been down the harbour fishing and heard
them. We found this morning a canoe upon the beach, with which we
had no doubt of getting two men across the water, who could in a
short time walk over to the cove where the Sirius lay; but this
prospect was disappointed by the first man who entered the canoe
having overset her and she immediately sunk, and he was obliged
to swim ashore. After this we went to work to make a catamaran of
the lightest wood we could find, but when finished and launched
it would not, although pretty large, bear the weight of one
man.<br>
<br>
"It was now proposed to walk round the head of the north-west
harbour, which would have been a good long journey for at least
two days, and our provisions were nearly expended. To this
proposal I was under the necessity of objecting for want of
shoes, the last march having tore all but the soals from my feet,
and they were tied on with spun-yarn. I therefore declined the
proposed walk, and determined to go back to Broken Bay and rejoin
the boats, which I had no doubt in being able to effect in the
course of that day, and with far more ease than I could, without
shoes, climb such rocky mountains and thick woods as lay in the
way round the head of the north-west harbour. But as it was
likely I might fall in with some parties of the natives in the
way, I wished to have a companion. Captain Collins preferred
accompanying me on the intended walk, and we were just upon the
point of setting out when two of the people who were with us
proposed swimming over the water and to cross through the wood to
the Sirius. The distance they had to swim was not more than two
cables length, or four hundred yards. They immediately stripped,
and each having had a dram they tied up in a handkerchief a
shirt, trousers, and a pair of shoes each, which was rested upon
their shoulders. Thus equipped they took the water, and in seven
minutes landed on the opposite shore; but one, being seized with
the cramp, was obliged to disengage himself from his bundle,
which was of course lost They set off through the woods, and in a
short time got on board the ship&#8212;the one with his shirt and
trousers, the other perfectly naked. Upon their information a
boat was sent down and took us on board, after a pretty fatiguing
journey.<br>
<br>
"I cannot help here remarking how providential it was that we did
not all agree to walk round the north-west harbour. At eight in
the morning we heard the report of a great gun, which led me to
suspect that some person belonging to the Sirius was missing, and
had probably been lost in the woods. We frequently fired muskets
that morning, and sometimes imagined we heard a musket at a
considerable distance in the woods. In consequence of this
suspicion we frequently fired several together, and as often
heard the report of that which we believed was meant to answer
us; in short, by means of these repeated vollies we drew nearer
to that, which answered us, and by hallooing all together found
we had got within hearing of the person who had answered our
firing; for after calling out we listened attentively, and heard
a very faint voice in answer. In that direction we walked, and at
last by frequent calling and answering we found the person out,
who proved to be Peter White, sailmaker of the Sirius, who had
been four days lost, and when he set out from the ship had not
four ounces of biscuit with him, one ounce of which he had still
left. He was very faint, and appeared to us to be stupid and
almost exhausted, for he staggered like a man drunk. We took him
with us, and by giving him such provisions as we had, in small
proportions, he was in a few hours a great deal recovered; but I
think if he had not been found as he was, in twenty-four hours
more he would not have been able to make any further effort to
save himself, and must have perished where he lay down. It is
remarkable that the flint of his gun being worn to a stump, he
could not get fire out of it the whole day before, when trying to
shoot some birds for his subsistence, until night came on, when
it was necessary for him to have a fire to sleep by; he then
tried it again with very little hope of succeeding, but contrary
to his expectations he got a fire and sat by it the whole night.
The next morning it failed him repeatedly until he had occasion
to answer our muskets, when it struck every time he wished to
answer us, otherwise in all probability we should not have found
him. This is exactly his own account."</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-58" id="ch-58"></a>3.31 LA P&#201;ROUSE AT BOTANY
BAY. <small>[1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>JUSTICE</small> should be done to the memory of La
P&#233;rouse and his comrades with respect to certain matters in
which they have been accused of serious wrongdoing towards the
natives during their stay at Botany Bay. The French have been
charged [Rusden, History of Australia, vol. i, p. 131] with
having "wantonly fired upon" them, and also with having spread
the small-pox among them&#8212;a disease which swept them off in
great numbers. There does not seem to be any foundation, beyond
mere conjecture, for either of these imputations. There is
certainly no evidence that any natives were killed by the French.
No statement of the kind can be found in any contemporary writer.
Captain Tench, who had good opportunities for ascertaining the
truth, referred to the matter in the following passage
(Narrative, p. 99):&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Like ourselves, the French found it necessary, more
than once, to chastise a spirit of rapine and intrusion which
prevailed among the Indians around the bay. The menace of
pointing a musket to them was frequently used; and in one or two
instances it was fired off, though without being attended with
fatal consequences. Indeed, the French Commandant, both from a
regard to the orders of his Court, as well as to our quiet and
security, showed a moderation and forbearance on this head highly
becoming.</blockquote>
<p>Collins (p. 17) mentions that "M. de la P&#233;rouse had been
compelled to fire upon the natives", but he does not state that
any of them were killed. And he adds:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We were, however, perfectly convinced that nothing
short of the greatest necessity could have induced M. de la
P&#233;rouse to take such a step, as we heard him declare that it
was among the particular instructions that he had received from
his Sovereign to endeavour by every possible means to acquire and
cultivate the friendship of the natives of such places as he
might discover or visit, and to avoid exercising any act of
hostility upon them.</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing here to justify the statement that the
natives had been "wantonly fired upon", even if it might be
inferred that some of them were killed. As to the small-pox, the
evidence against the French has been collected by Rusden, vol. i,
p. 134 n. It consists substantially of two assertions: (1) That
"the early settlers, when able to converse with the natives, came
to the conclusion that small-pox had been introduced by the
French"; and (2) that "the natives (in the far interior)
concurred in declaring that only at that epoch were its ravages
heard of amongst the tribes, and none but the aged bore traces of
it in 1835." The testimony of the early settlers and the natives,
thus alleged, amounts to nothing more than tradition, and is not
entitled to any weight unless it can be connected with
ascertained facts. The facts here, are altogether against the
tradition. Among "the early settlers", the best witnesses are the
men who made it their business to ascertain and record in their
journals every fact of interest or importance that came within
the range of their observation. Both Collins (p. 65, 597) and
Hunter (p. 134) record the outbreak of the small-pox in April,
1789; but neither of them makes any reference to the French in
connection with it. Had there been any reason to suppose that it
had been introduced by them, it is not likely that either of
those chroniclers would have omitted to say so. Their silence on
that point may be easily accounted for. The simple fact that the
disease did not make its appearance until April, 1789, more than
twelve months after the French ships had sailed, is enough to
show that there could not have been any reason for connecting the
two things together. Had the germs of the disease been introduced
by the French, it could not have failed to make itself known very
soon after their departure; and if any of the Frenchmen had been
suffering from it while in Botany Bay, the fact could not have
escaped the notice of the English officers, who frequently
exchanged visits with the strangers.</p>
<p>The only foundation for the supposition seems to lie in an
allusion contained in one of Phillip's despatches, in which he
said:&#8212;</p>
<p>"Whether the small-pox, which has proved fatal to great
numbers of the natives, is a disorder to which they were subject
before any Europeans visited the country, or whether it was
brought by the French ships, we have not yet attained sufficient
knowledge of the [native] language to determine. It never
appeared on board any of the ships on our passage."</p>
<p>If Phillip had been aware of any fact or circumstance pointing
to a French origin of the disease, he would not have omitted to
mention it; and it may be assumed that whatever was known on the
subject at that time was known to him. How the French came to be
mixed up in the matter at all may be seen in the following
passage from Tench (Complete Account, page 18), where the idea
appears in the shape of a query:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>No solution of this difficulty had been given when I
left the country, in December, 1791. I can, therefore, only
propose queries for the ingenuity of others to exercise itself
upon. Is it a disease indigenous to the country? Did the French
ships under Monsieur de Peyrouse introduce it? Let it be
remembered that they now had been departed more than a year; and
we had never heard of its existence on board them. Had it
travelled across the continent from its western shore, where
Dampier and other European voyagers had formerly landed? Was it
introduced by Mr. Cook? Did we give it birth here? No person
among us had been afflicted with the disorder since we had
quitted the Cape of Good Hope, seventeen months before. It is
true that our surgeons had brought out variolous matter in
bottles; but to infer that it was produced from this cause were a
supposition so wild as to be unworthy of
consideration.</blockquote>
<p>The most probable of these suppositions is that it was
"indigenous to the country"&#8212;or rather, that it was a
disease which originated among the natives, as a natural result
of their habits of life. Some confirmation of this theory may be
found in the fact that it has been observed under circumstances
which clearly repudiate a French origin. Major Mitchell, for
instance, found it among the natives whom he met with after
crossing the Liverpool Range in 1831:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>We reached, at length, a watercourse, called by the
natives Currungai, and encamped upon its banks beside the tribe
from Dartbrook, which had crossed the range before us, apparently
to join some of their tribe who lay extremely ill at this place,
being affected with a virulent kind of small-pox. We found the
helpless creatures stretched on their backs beside the water,
under the shade of the wattle or mimosa trees, to avoid the
intense heat of the sun. We gave them from our stock some
medicine; and the wretched sufferers seemed to place the utmost
confidence in its efficacy.&#8212;Three Expeditions, p.
26.</blockquote>
<p>There is some positive testimony, on the other hand, to show
that 1788-90 the French had nothing to do with the matter.
Lieutenant King referred to it in his Journal in these terms
(Hunter, p. 406):&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>This dreadful distemper, which, there is no doubt, is
a distemper natural to the country, together with the difficulty
of procuring a subsistence, renders the situation of these poor
wretches truly miserable.</blockquote>
<p>As King was in daily communication at that time&#8212;April,
1790&#8212;with Phillip and all the officers of the
establishment, it is not conceivable that he could have been
under any misapprehension on the matter. The opinion expressed by
him was evidently the public opinion of the time.</p>

<p class="blok" align="right">Sydney Cove, Port
Jackson,               <br>
New South Wales, 24 June, 1788.     </p>
<blockquote>My dear and honoured mother.<br>
<br>
With a heart oppressed by the keenest sense of anguish, and too
much agitated by the idea of my very melancholy condition to
express my own sentiments, I have prevailed on the goodness of a
commiserating friend to do me the last sad office of acquainting
you with the dreadful fate that awaits me. My dear mother! with
what agony of soul do I dedicate the last few moments of my life
to bid you an eternal adieu: my doom being irrevocably fixed, and
ere this hour to-morrow I shall have quitted this vale of
wretchedness to enter into an unknown and endless eternity. I
will not distress your tender maternal feelings by any long
comment on this cause of my present misfortune. Let it therefore
suffice to say that, impelled by that strong propensity to evil,
which neither the virtuous precepts nor example of the best of
parents could eradicate, I have at length fallen an unhappy
though just victim to my own follies.<br>
<br>
Too late I regret my inattention to your admonitions, and feel
myself sensibly affected by the remembrance of the many anxious
moments you have passed on my account. For these and all my other
transgressions, however great, I supplicate the Divine
forgiveness; and encouraged by the promises of that Saviour who
died for us all, I trust to receive that mercy in the world to
come which my offences have deprived me of all hope or
expectation of in this. The affliction which this will cost you I
hope the Almighty will enable you to bear. Banish from your
memory all my former indiscretions, and let the cheering hope of
a happy meeting hereafter console you for my loss. Sincerely
penitent for my sins; sensible of the justice of my conviction
and sentence, and firmly relying on the merits of a blessed
Redeemer, I am at perfect peace with all mankind, and trust I
shall yet experience that peace which this world cannot give.
Commend my soul to the Divine mercy. I bid you an eternal
farewell.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-61" id="ch-61"></a>3.34 PHILLIP'S INSTRUCTIONS TO
KING. <small>[February 1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p class="blok" align="center">Instructions for Philip Gidley
King, Esq., Superintendant and<br>
Commandant of the Settlement of Norfolk Island.</p>
<blockquote><small>WITH</small> these instructions you will
receive my Commission appointing you to superintend and command
the settlement to be formed on Norfolk Island, and to obey all
such orders as you shall from time to time receive from me, his
Majesty's Governor-in-Chief and Captain-General of the Territory
of New South Wales and its dependencies, or from the
Lieutenant-Governor in my absence.<br>
<br>
You are therefore to proceed in his Majesty's armed tender
Supply, whose commander has my orders to receive you, with the
men and women, stores and provisions necessary for forming the
intended settlement, and on your landing on Norfolk Island take
upon you the execution of the trust reposed in you, causing my
Commission appointing you Superintendant over the said settlement
to be publicly read.<br>
<br>
And after having taken the necessary measures for securing
yourself and people, and for the preservation of the stores and
provisions, you are immediately to proceed to the cultivation of
the flax plant, which you will find growing spontaneously on the
island, as likewise to the cultivation of cotton, corn, and other
grains with the seeds of which you are furnished and which you
are to regard as public stock, and of the increase of which you
are to send me an account, that I may know what quantity may be
drawn from the island for the public use, or what supplies may be
necessary to send hereafter. It is left to your discretion to use
such part of the corn that is raised, as may be found necessary;
but this you are to do with the greatest economy. And as the
corn, flax, cotton, and other grains are the property of the
Crown and are as such to be accounted for, you are to keep an
exact account of the increase. and you will in future receive
directions for the disposal thereof.<br>
<br>
You are to inform yourself of the nature of the soil, what
proportion of land you find proper for the cultivation of corn,
flax, and cotton, as likewise what quantity of cattle may be bred
on the island, and the number of people you judge necessary for
the above purposes. You will likewise observe what are the
prevailing winds in the different seasons of the year, the best
anchorage according to the season, the rise and fall of the
tides, likewise when the dry and rainy seasons begin and end.<br>
<br>
You will be furnished with a four-oared boat, and you are not on
any consideration to build, or to permit the building of any
vessel or boat whatever that is decked, or of any boat or vessel
that is not decked, whose length of keel exceeds twenty feet; and
if by any accident any vessel or boat be driven on the island,
you are immediately to cause such boat or vessel to be scuttled,
or otherwise rendered unserviceable, letting her remain in that
state until you receive further directions from me.<br>
<br>
You will be furnished with provisions for six months, within
which time you will receive an additional supply; but as you will
be able to procure fish and vegetables, you are to endeavour to
make the provisions you receive serve as long as possible.<br>
<br>
The convicts being the servants of the Crown till the time for
which they are sentenced is expired, their labour is for the
public, and you are to take particular notice of their general
good or bad behaviour, that they may hereafter be employed or
rewarded according to their different merits.<br>
<br>
You are to cause the prayers of the Church of England to be read
with all due solemnity every Sunday, and you are to enforce a due
observance of religion and good order, transmitting to me as
often as opportunity offers a full account of your particular
situation and transactions.<br>
<br>
You are not to permit any intercourse or trade with any ships or
vessels that may stop at the island, whether English or of any
other nation, unless such ships or vessels are in distress, in
which case you are to afford them such assistance as may be in
your power.<br>
<br>
Given under my hand at head-quarters in Port Jackson, New South
Wales, this 12th day of February, 1788.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-62" id="ch-62"></a>3.35 JUDGE-ADVOCATE COLLINS.
<small>[1756-1810]</small></h3>
<br>
<blockquote>"<small>COLONEL DAVID COLLINS</small> was the eldest
son of General Arthur Tooker Collins and Harriet Frazer, of Pack,
in the King's County, Ireland, and grandson of Arthur Collins,
author of the 'Peerage of England', &amp;c. He was born on the
3rd of March, 1756, and received a liberal education under the
Rev. Mr. Marshall, master of the Grammar School at Exeter, where
his father resided. In 1770 he was appointed lieutenant of
marines; and in 1772 was with the late Admiral McBride when the
unfortunate Matilda, Queen of Denmark, was rescued from the
dangers that awaited her by the energy of the British Government,
and conveyed to a place of safety in the King's (her brother's)
Hanoverian dominions. On that occasion he commanded the guard
that received her Majesty, and had the honor of kissing her hand.
In 1775, he was at the battle of Bunkers's Hill, in which the
first battalion of marines to which he belonged so signally
distinguished itself, having its commanding officer, the gallant
Major Pitcairne, and a great many officers and men, killed in
storming the redoubt, besides a very large proportion wounded. In
1777 he was adjutant of the Chatham division, and in 1784 captain
of marines on board the Courageux, of seventy-four guns,
commanded by the late Lord Mulgrave, and participated in the
partial action that took place with the enemy's fleet when Lord
Howe relieved Gibraltar. Reduced to half-pay at the Peace of
1782, he resided at Rochester, in Kent (having previously married
an American lady, who survived him without issue); and on its
being determined to found a colony by sending convicts to Botany
Bay, he was appointed Judge-Advocate to the intended settlement,
and in that capacity sailed with Governor Phillip in May, 1787
(who, moreover, appointed him his secretary); which situation he
filled with the greatest credit to himself and advantage to the
colony, until his return to England in 1797.<br>
<br>
"The history of the settlement which he soon after published,
followed by a second volume&#8212;a work abounding with
information highly interesting, and written with the utmost
simplicity&#8212;will be read and referred to as a book of
authority as long as the colony exists whose name it bears. The
appointment of Judge-Advocate, however, proved eventually
injurious to his own interests. While absent he had been passed
over, when it came to his turn to be put on full-pay; nor was he
permitted to return to England to reclaim his rank in the corps;
nor could he ever obtain any effectual redress, but was
afterwards compelled to come in as a junior captain of the corps,
though with his proper rank in the army. The difference this made
in regard to his promotion was that he died a captain instead of
a colonel commandant&#8212;his rank in the army being merely
brevet. He had then the mortification of finding that, after ten
years' distinguished service in the infancy of a colony, and to
the sacrifice of every real comfort, his only reward had been the
loss of many years' rank&#8212;a vital injury to an officer. A
remark which his wounded feelings wrung from him, at the close of
the second volume of his history of the settlement, appears to
have awakened the sympathy of those in power; and he was, almost
immediately after its publication, offered the government of the
projected settlement in Van Diemen's Land, which he accepted, and
sailed once more for that quarter of the globe, where he founded
his new colony; struggled with great difficulties, which he
overcame; and after remaining there eight years, was enjoying the
flourishing state his exertions had produced, when he died
suddenly after a few days' confinement from a slight cold, on the
24th March, 1810.<br>
<br>
"His person was remarkably handsome and his manners extremely
prepossessing; while to a cultivated understanding and an early
fondness for the belles lettres, he joined the most social
disposition. How he was esteemed by the inhabitants of the colony
over which he presided, will appear by the following extract of a
letter announcing his decease:&#8212;'By the death of Colonel
Collins this colony has sustained a loss it will take a number of
years to get over. I have known and served with him from the
first establishment of the colony; and when I speak the feelings
of my heart on this melancholy occasion, I am sure that it is not
my single voice, but that of every department whatsoever in the
settlement, who, with the most heartfelt regret, universally
acknowledge him to have been the father and friend of
all.'"</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing details appeared as a footnote in the Memoirs of
Joseph Holt, edited by T. Crofton Croker, vol. ii, p. 252. Holt
met Lieutenant-Governor Collins during his stay in Van Diemen's
Land in the year 1805, and wrote of him as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"This gentleman had the good will, the good wishes,
and the good word of every one in the settlement. His conduct was
exemplary, and his disposition most humane. His treatment of
runaway convicts was conciliatory, and even kind. He would go
into the forests, among the natives, to allow these poor
creatures, the runaways, an opportunity of returning to their
former condition; and, half dead with cold and hunger, they would
come and drop on their knees before him, imploring pardon for
their behaviour.<br>
<br>
'Well,' he would say to them, 'now that you have lived in the
bush, do you think the change you made was for the better? Are
you sorry for what you have done?'<br>
<br>
'Yes, sir.'<br>
<br>
'And will you promise me never to go away again?'<br>
<br>
'Never, sir.'<br>
<br>
'Go to the storekeeper, then,' the benevolent Collins would say,
'and get a suit of slops and your week's rations, and then go to
the overseer and attend to your work. I give you my pardon; but
remember that I expect you will keep your promise to me.'<br>
<br>
"I never heard of any other Governor or commandant acting in this
manner, nor did I ever witness such leniency from any Governor. I
have, however, been assured that there was less crime and much
fewer faults committed among the people under Governor Collins
than in any other settlement, which I think is a clear proof that
mercy and humanity are the best policy.<br>
<br>
"Colonel Collins died at the Derwent, sincerely lamented by every
one there, as well as by all to whom this amiable and excellent
gentleman was known, even by reputation."</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-67" id="ch-67"></a>3.40 VISIT OF HOPE TO SYDNEY
COVE. <small>[1789]</small></h3>
<br>
<p class="poem">Where Sydney Cove her lucid bosom swells,<br>
Courts her young navies and the storm repels;<br>
High on a rock amid the troubled air<br>
Hope stood sublime, and wav'd her golden hair;<br>
Calm'd with her rosy smile the tossing deep,<br>
And with sweet accents charm'd the winds to sleep;<br>
To each wild plain she stretched her snowy hand.<br>
High waving wood, and sea-encircled strand.<br>
'Hear me,' she cried, 'ye rising realms! record<br>
'Time's opening scenes, and Truth's unerring word.&#8212;<br>
'<i>There</i> shall broad streets their stately walls extend,<br>
'The circus widen and the crescent bend;<br>
'<i>There</i>, ray'd from cities o'er the cultured land,<br>
'Shall bright canals and solid roads expand.<br>
'<i>There</i> the proud arch. Colossus-like, bestride<br>
'Yon glittering streams and bound the chafing tide;<br>
'Embellish'd villas crown the landscape scene,<br>
'Farms wave with gold and orchards blush between.<br>
'<i>There</i> shall tall spires and dome-capt towers ascend,<br>
'And piers and quays their massy structures blend;<br>
'While with each breeze approaching vessels glide,<br>
'And northern treasures dance on every tide!'<br>
Then ceas'd the nymph; tumultuous echoes roar.<br>
And Joy's loud voice was heard from shore to shore.<br>
Her graceful steps descending press'd the plain,<br>
And Peace, and Art, and Labour join'd her train.</p>
<p>Darwin's name was just then famous in the poetic world, his
Loves of the Plants, which appeared in 1788, having captivated
the public fancy by its ingenious mixture of botanical science
and floral amours. He was the grandfather of Charles Darwin, the
great naturalist. An engraving of the medallion referred to was
published in Erasmus Darwin's poem, The Botanic Garden (1791), p.
87, with the following lines addressed to Wedgwood:&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">To call the pearly drops from Pity's eye,<br>
Or stay Despair's disanimating sigh.<br>
Whether, Friend of Art! the gem you mould,<br>
Rich with new taste, with antient virtue hold.<br>
Form the poor fettered slave on bended knee<br>
From Britain's sons imploring to be free;<br>
Or with fair Hope the brightening scenes improve,<br>
And cheer the dreary wastes at Sydney Cove;<br>
Or bid Mortality rejoice and mourn<br>
O'er the fine forms on Portland's mystic urn.</p>
<p>These lines allude to "two cameos of Mr. Wedgwood's
manufacture: one of a Slave in Chains, of which he distributed
many hundreds to excite the humane to attend to, and to assist
in, the abolition of the detestable traffic in human creatures;
and the other a cameo of Hope attended by Peace and Art and
Labour, which was made of clay from Botany Bay, to which place he
sent many of them to show the inhabitants what their materials
could do, and to encourage their industry."</p>
<p>Darwin had a curious gift of prophecy in science as well as in
poetry. In the same poem (p. 29) occur the following
lines:&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem">Soon shall thy arm, Unconquer'd Steam! afar<br>
Drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car.</p>

<blockquote>Dear sir,<br>
<br>
Of the many letters that I have long been pestered with on the
subject of New South Wales, the enclosed is the only one that I
am now desirous of answering, for which reason I take the liberty
of sending it to you. I know that Mr. De Lancey, who is very
sanguine on the business, has been active in procuring the
consent of many people to go, and as a settlement somewhere is
essentially necessary to them, I wish to be authorised to give
him a decisive answer, which, whatever my private opinion may be,
I think would be improper till I hear from you. You will
therefore do me a particular pleasure, if to the great trouble
you have already taken in pushing forward this business for me,
you would be so obliging as to tell me if the Ministry have come
to a decided resolution to reject the plan, or if there be any
chance of its being entered on in the spring season.<br>
<br>
I shall go next Thursday, for a few days, to Lord Conyers, Benham
Place, Berks, where your letter to me, under Lord Cork's cover,
will safely reach me. My company, to be sure, is not politically
orthodox; but when I assure you that I am not contaminated by
their heresies, you will excuse the direction. I shall always be
extremely cautious of obtruding on your time, and were you to see
but a list of the fiftieth part of the letters I am perplexed
with about the South Seas, I know you would pardon this
instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear sir,<br>
<br>
I should have answered yours of the 31st of August sooner, but
waited in expectation of another letter from you, which would
have contained something decisive in regard to New South
Wales.<br>
<br>
My brother will deliver this to you; he wishes much to have this
business determined one way or the other, in order that, if the
plan of making a settlement in the southern hemisphere should be
given up, he may think of some other way of rendering himself
usefull, as he has an active mind and does not chuse to remain
idle.<br>
<br>
The season for a voyage to that country will soon be elapsed, and
unless the equipment is speedily sett afoot, another year will be
lost and my prospect of procuring settlers from the Loyalists in
Nova Scotia rendered less favorable; for by next year I should
suppose, most of them who have gone there will have procured some
kind of habitation for themselves, and will not chuse to quit
them for an uncertain settlement in New South Wales; and I would
like to have among the emigrants some of the better sort, and
should not chuse to have this colony composed of persons who
would not get their living anywhere else.<br>
<br>
I find that the Treasury Board have met, and therefore hope that
now the Ministers have returned to town, some final determination
will be had on this business, and flatter myself that a measure
which appears to meet with general approbation will not be
abandoned.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-70" id="ch-70"></a>3.43 NATIVE FOOD SUPPLY.
<small>[1837-9]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>CAPTAIN</small>, now <small>SIR GEORGE, GREY</small>,
in his Journal of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-west and
Western Australia, vol. ii, p. 259, describes the native supplies
of food in the interior as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>One mistake very commonly made with regard to the
natives of Australia is to imagine they have small means of
subsistence, or are at times greatly pressed for want of food; I
could produce many almost humorous instances of the errors which
travellers have fallen into upon this point. They lament in their
journals that the unfortunate aborigines should be reduced by
famine to the miserable necessity of subsisting on certain sorts
of food, which they have found near their huts; whereas in many
instances the articles thus quoted by them are those which the
natives most prize, and are really neither deficient in flavour
nor nutritious qualities. I will give a remarkable example of an
error of the kind into which a traveller of great ability has
fallen; but this will only render palpable the ignorance that has
prevailed with regard to the habits and customs of this people
when in their wild state, for those who frequent European towns
and the outskirts of population are soon compelled by the force
of circumstances to depart in a great measure from their original
habits.<br>
<br>
Captain Sturt, to whom I allude, says in his travels, vol. i, p.
118:&#8212;"Among other things, we found a number of bark troughs
filled with the gum of the mimosa, and vast quantities of gum
made into cakes upon the ground. From this it would appear that
these unfortunate creatures were reduced to the last extremity,
and, being unable to procure any other nourishment, had been
obliged to collect this mucilaginous food."<br>
<br>
The gum of the mimosa thus referred to is a favourite article of
food amongst the natives; and when it is in season they assemble
in large numbers upon the plains of the character previously
described by Captain Sturt, in order to enjoy this luxury. The
profusion in which this gum is found enables large bodies to meet
together, which, from their subsistence being derived from wild
animals and vegetables of spontaneous growth, they can only do
when some particular article is in full season, or when a whale
is thrown ashore. In order more fully to show how little the
habits of this people have been understood, I may state with
regard to this very gum, called by the natives <i>know-nat</i>,
that about the time the above account was published by Captain
Sturt an expedition was sent out from King George's Sound, in
Western Australia, in order to discover what was the nature of
the article of food so loudly praised by them, and which they
stated was to be found in certain districts in great profusion;
the belief at that time being, from the accounts given of it,
that it could be only a new and valuable species of grain. The
exploring party did not attain their object, and to this day many
of the settlers believe the <i>know-nat</i> to be a kind of
corn.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, the natives live well; in some districts
there may at particular seasons of the year be a deficiency of
food, but if such is the case, these tracts are, at those times,
deserted. It is, however, utterly impossible for a traveller, or
even for a strange native, to judge whether a district affords an
abundance of food, or the contrary; for in traversing extensive
parts of Australia I have found the sorts of food vary from
latitude to latitude, so that the vegetable productions used by
the aborigines in one are totally different to those in another;
if, therefore, a stranger has no one to point out to him the
vegetable productions, the soil beneath his feet may teem with
food whilst he starves. The same rule holds good with regard to
animal productions; for example, in the southern parts of the
continent the Xanthorrea affords an inexhaustible supply of
fragrant grubs, which an epicure would delight in, when once he
has so far conquered his prejudices as to taste them; whilst in
proceeding to the northward these trees decline in health and
growth, until about the parallel of Gantheaume Bay they totally
disappear, and even a native finds himself cut off from his
ordinary supply of insects; the same circumstances taking place
with regard to the roots and other kinds of food at the same
time, the traveller necessarily finds himself reduced to cruel
extremities. A native from the plains, taken into an elevated
mountainous district near his own country for the first time, is
equally at fault.<br>
<br>
But in his own district a native is very differently situated; he
knows exactly what it produces, the proper time at which the
several articles are in season, and the readiest means of
procuring them. According to these circumstances he regulates his
visits to the different portions of his hunting ground; and I can
only state that I have always found the greatest abundance in
their huts. There are, however, two periods of the year when they
are, at times, subjected to the pangs of hunger. These are, in
the hottest time of summer, and in the height of the rainy
season. At the former period the heat renders them so excessively
indolent that until forced by want they will not move, and at the
latter they suffer so severely from the cold and rain that I have
known them remain for two successive days at their huts without
quitting the fire; and even when they do quit it they always
carry a firestick with them, which greatly embarrasses their
movements. In all ordinary seasons, however, they can obtain in
two or three hours a sufficient supply of food for the day, but
their usual custom is to roam indolently from spot to spot,
lazily collecting it as they wander along.<br>
<br>
That an accurate idea may be formed of the quantity and kind of
food which they obtain, I have given below a list of those in us
amongst the aborigines of south-western Australia, which I have
seen them collect and eat.</blockquote>
<p class="bloklist">Six sorts of kangaroo<br>
Twenty-nine sorts of fish<br>
One kind of whale<br>
Two species of seal<br>
Wild dogs<br>
Three kinds of turtle<br>
Emus, wild turkeys, and birds of every kind<br>
Two species of opossum<br>
Eleven kinds of frogs<br>
Four kinds of fresh-water shell-fish<br>
All salt-water shell-fish, except oysters<br>
Four kinds of grubs<br>
Eggs of every species of bird and lizard<br>
Five animals, something smaller in size than rabbits<br>
Eight sorts of snakes<br>
Seven sorts of iguana<br>
Nine species of mice and small rats<br>
Twenty-nine sorts of roots<br>
Seven kinds of fungus<br>
Four sorts of gum<br>
Two sorts of manna<br>
Two species of by-yu, or the nut of the zamia palm<br>
Two species of mesembryantheum<br>
Two kinds of nut<br>
Four sorts of fruit<br>
The flower of several species of Banksia<br>
One kind of earth which they pound and mix with the roots of the
mene<br>
The seeds of several leguminous plants.</p>
<p>One of the native methods of cooking is described by Grey as
follows:&#8212;If the fish are not cooked by being merely thrown
on the fire and broiled, they dress them in a manner worthy of
being adopted by the most civilised nations; this is called
"yudarn dookoon" or "tying up cooking." A piece of thick and
tender paper bark is selected and torn into an oblong form; the
fish is laid in this, and the bark wrapt round it, as paper is
folded round a cutlet; strings formed of grass are then wound
tightly about the bark and fish, which is then slowly baked in
heated sand covered with hot ashes; when it is completed, the
bark is opened, and serves as a dish; it is of course full of
juice and gravy, not one drop of which has escaped. Several of
the smaller sorts of fresh-water fish, in size and taste
resembling whitebait, are really delicious when cooked in this
manner; they occasionally also dress pieces of kangaroo and other
meats in the same way.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-71" id="ch-71"></a>3.44 THE JUDGE-ADVOCATE'S
OPINION. <small>[1788]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> a letter to Evan Nepean, dated 15th
November, 1788, Judge-Advocate Collins humbly explained his share
in the legal difficulty which had occurred with reference to the
Court-martial (pp. 347-350). His "opinion" on the question is
interesting not only as the earliest specimen of legal literature
of which we have any record, but as showing the peculiar method
by which its author arrived at his conclusions on points of
law.</p>

I beg leave to trouble you with the inclosed paper. It contains
my opinion on the question respecting General Courts-martial in
this country, and the expedient that I proposed of getting over
the difficulty that was started by myself and adopted by the
officers here.<br>
<br>
I beg you to rest assured, and through the whole of your
consideration on this affair to take this with you, that nothing
would give me more pain than to be thought to start difficulties
for the sake of throwing obstacles in the way of the service. The
doubts that occurred to me were deemed satisfactory to the
officers of marines here, and the resolution adopted that you
will find among the public letters from the Governor. I sincerely
wish the expedient I proposed had been also adopted.<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope you enjoy your health, and remain, with great
esteem, &amp;c.,</blockquote>

<blockquote>To the question "Whether a General Court-martial,
formed of marine officers, can assemble by virtue of a warrant
from his Majesty's Governor-in-Chief of this territory, having a
Commission to grant the same?"<br>
<br>
I reply&#8212;<br>
<br>
I am of opinion that, being marine officers, they cannot comply
with the directions of the Act of Parliament passed for their
regulation while on shore in any part of his Majesty's dominions,
and hold a Court-martial under the warrant of his excellency the
Governor of New South Wales.<br>
<br>
But when I consider the time that must elapse before a remedy can
be applied, when I consider how much his Majesty's service may
and must suffer from the want of a tribunal to which officers
should be amenable, when I consider that although the strict
letter of the law is against their sitting, it has been clearly
the intention of every branch and department of his Majesty's
Government that there should be such a tribunal in this country,
I am of opinion that, waving the privilege of being assembled in
conformity with their own Act of Parliament, they should sit
under the authority of the King's Commission and Governor of this
territory, throwing themselves, with the strong plea of
necessity, on the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty for procuring them an indemnification for their having
so acted.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-72" id="ch-72"></a>3.45 AN AMERICAN COLONIST ON
TRANSPORTATION.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>TO</small> show the mischievous effect of the
transportation system in America, the author of the History of
New York, written in 1756, quoted a paper published in a local
periodical called The Independent Reflector, in which the writer
expressed the views of the colonists on the subject with
considerable force and feeling. His statements shew three things
clearly:&#8212;(1) that the number of convicts annually
transported to the American colonies was very large; (2) that the
colonies were brought into so much discredit by that means among
all classes in Great Britain and Ireland, that emigration was
greatly discouraged; and (3), that the colonists looked upon the
system with disgust, and strongly protested against it.</p>
<blockquote>"It is too well known that in pursuance of divers
Acts of Parliament, great numbers of felons who have forfeited
their lives to the public for the most atrocious crimes, are
annually transported from home to these plantations. Very
surprising, one would think, that thieves, burglars, pickpockets,
and cut-purses, and a herd of the most flagitious banditti upon
earth, should be sent as agreeable companions to us! That the
supreme Legislature did intend transportation to America for a
punishment of those villains, I verily believe; but so great is
the mistake, that I am confident they are thereby, on the
contrary, highly rewarded. For what, in God's name, can be more
agreeable to a penurious wretch, driven through necessity to seek
a livelihood by breaking of houses and robbing upon the King's
highway, than to be saved from the halter, redeemed from the
stench of a gaol, and transported, passage free, into a country
where, being unknown, no man can reproach him with his crimes;
where labour is high, a little of which will maintain him; and
where all his expenses will be moderate and low. There is scarce
a thief in England that would not rather be transported than
hanged. Life in any condition but that of extreme misery will be
preferred to death. As long, therefore, as there remains this
wide door of escape, the number of thieves and robbers at home
will perpetually multiply, and their depredations be incessantly
reiterated.<br>
<br>
"But the Acts were intended for the better peopling the colonies.
And will thieves and murderers be conducive to that end? What
advantage can we reap from a colony of unrestrainable renegadoes?
prosper. Will they exalt the glory of the Crown&#8212;or, rather,
will not the dignity of the most illustrious monarch in the world
be sullied by a province of subjects so lawless, detestable, and
ignominious? Can agriculture be promoted when the wild boar of
the forest breaks down our hedges and pulls up our vines? Will
trade flourish, or manufactures be encouraged, where property is
made the spoil of such who are too idle to work, and wicked
enough to murder and steal?<br>
<br>
"Besides, are we not subjects of the same king with the people of
England&#8212;members of the same body politic, and, therefore,
entitled to equal privileges with them? If so, how injurious does
it seem to free one part of the dominions from the plagues of
mankind and cast them upon another? Should a law be proposed to
take the poor of one parish and billet them upon another, would
not all the world, but the parish to be relieved, exclaim against
such a project as iniquitous and absurd? Should the numberless
villains of London and Westminster be suffered to escape from
their prisons, to range at large and depredate any other part of
the kingdom, would not every man join with the sufferers, and
condemn the measure as hard and unreasonable? And though the
hardships upon us are indeed not equal to those, yet the miseries
that flow from laws by no means intended to prejudice us, are too
heavy not to be felt. But the colonies must be peopled. Agreed.
And will the Transportation Acts ever have that tendency? No,
they work the contrary way, and counteract their own design. We
want people, 'tis true, but not villains ready at any time,
encouraged by impunity, and habituated upon the slightest
occasions to cut a man's throat for a small part of his property.
The delight of such company is a noble inducement, indeed, to the
honest poor to convey themselves into a strange country.<br>
<br>
"In reality, sir, these very laws, though otherwise designed,
have turned out in the end the most effectual expedients that the
art of man could have contrived, to prevent the settlement of
these remote parts of the King's dominions. They have actually
taken away almost every encouragement to so laudable a design. I
appeal to facts. The body of the English are struck with terror
at the thought of coming over to us, not because they have a vast
ocean to cross, or to leave behind them their friends, or that
the country is new and uncultivated; but from the shocking ideas
the mind must necessarily form of the company of inhuman savages,
and the more terrible herd of exiled malefactors. There are
thousands of honest men, labouring in Europe at fourpence a day,
starving in spite of all their efforts, a dead weight to the
respective parishes to which they belong; who, without any other
qualifications than common sense, health, and strength, might
accumulate estates among us, as many have done already. These,
and not the others, are the men that should be sent over, for the
better peopling the plantations. Great Britain and Ireland, in
their present circumstances, are overstocked with them; and he
who would immortalise himself for a lover of mankind should
concert a scheme for the transportation of the industriously
honest abroad, and the immediate punishment of rogues and
plunderers at home. The pale-faced, half-clad, meagre, and
starved skeletons that are seen in every village of those
kingdoms, call loudly for the patriot's generous aid. The
plantations, too, would thank him for his assistance in obtaining
the repeal of those laws which, though otherwise intended by the
Legislature, have so unhappily proved injurious to his own
country and ruinous to us.<br>
<br>
"It is not long since a bill passed the Commons for the
employment of such criminals in his Majesty's docks as should
merit the gallows. The design was good. It is consistent with
sound policy that all those who have forfeited their liberty and
lives to their country should be compelled to labour the residue
of their days in its service. But the scheme was bad, and wisely
was the bill rejected by the Lords, for this only
reason&#8212;that it had a natural tendency to discredit the
King's yards, the consequences of which must have been
prejudicial to the whole nation. Just so ought we to reason in
the present case; and we should then soon be brought to conclude,
that though peopling the colonies, which was the laudable motive
of the Legislature, be expedient to the publick; abrogating the
transportation laws must be equally necessary."</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-73" id="ch-73"></a>3.46 ADMINISTRATION OF THE
COLONIES IN 1787.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> the instructions given to Phillip with
respect to the exploration of the coast and the occupation of
Norfolk Island, he was directed to transmit "any remarks or
observations" which he might obtain to "our Principal Secretary
of State for Plantation Affairs"; but his despatches from Sydney
Cove were addressed to the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, and to the Lords of the Admiralty. It is not easy at
first sight to understand on what principle matters relating to
the colonies came to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Home
Office; while a reference to "Plantation Affairs" takes us back
to the early days of Virginia and Maryland. The office of
Secretary of State for the Colonies, to which we are now
accustomed to look as the head of colonial administration, was
first established in 1768, but the Minister was then known as
"the Secretary of State for the American Department." <a href=
"#note-427" name="noteref-427" id="noteref-427">{1}</a> At that
time the Council of Trade and Plantations, established in 1672,
had control of all matters, not purely executive, relating to the
colonies&#8212;then generally known as plantations. This Council,
which was an amalgamation of the Council of Trade and the Council
of Foreign Plantations created by Charles II in 1660, continued
to exist after the appointment of a Secretary of State for the
American department. Both the Secretaryship and the Council,
however, were abolished in 1782 by an Act of Parliament known as
Burke's Act; a measure probably suggested by the loss of the
American colonies, which left the departments in question very
little to do. The executive administration of colonial affairs
was then vested in the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, and all matters of detail connected with thorn were
committed, after the passing of that Act, to a subordinate branch
of the Home Office, composed of an Under Secretary and three
clerks, and styled the "Plantation Branch" of the Home Office. A
law officer was also appointed to report on colonial Acts.</p>
<p>Two years after Burke's Act was passed, the ancient Committee
of the Privy Council, to which were referred all questions
relative to Trade and Plantations, was practically revived by an
Order-in-Council which appointed a Committee for the same
purpose, commonly known as the Board of Trade. By two
Orders-in-Council made in 1786, a new Committee was appointed,
and its establishment placed on a definite footing. The business
formerly transacted at the Plantation Branch of the Home Office
was transferred to that Committee, which continued to administer
colonial affairs till 1794, when the office of Secretary of State
for War was created, owing to the pressure of business arising
from the war of the French Revolution. Lord Melville, the first
Secretary for War, did duty as Secretary for the Colonies also.
The active functions of the Committee of Council appointed in
1786 appear to have ceased, so far as the plantations were
concerned, immediately on the appointment of the Secretary for
War and Colonies. This Committee, known as the Board of Trade, is
now chiefly occupied in the discharge of those duties which its
title imports; as a committee of Council for Plantations, it acts
simply as the referee of the Colonial Office.</p>
<p>The two departments&#8212;War and Colonies&#8212;remained
united until 1854, when the war with Russia suggested the
expediency of separating them. <a href="#note-428" name=
"noteref-428" id="noteref-428">{2}</a></p>
<p>The Colonial Office List for 1887 (p. 9) gives a concise
sketch of the changes which have taken place in the history of
the Colonial department; and also a list of the various Ministers
who have presided over it.</p>
<p>The office of Secretary to the Sovereign dates at least from
the reign of Henry III. There was one principal Secretary only
(who was already called Secretary of State) down to 1539, when a
second was appointed. From 1708 to 1746 a third secretaryship
existed, dealing exclusively with Scotland.<br>
<br>
In 1768 a Secretary of State for the American or Colonial
department was appointed, in addition to the two principal
Secretaries of State then existing; but this office was abolished
in 1782 by statute 22 Geo. III, cap. 82.<br>
<br>
In 1782 the duties of the two principal Secretaries of State were
divided into Home and Foreign, the affairs of Ireland and the
colonies devolving on the Home department: those of the colonies
being placed in the charge of a separate branch of the Department
called the Office for Plantations, managed by a separate Under
Secretary.<br>
<br>
At its commencement in 1793, the affairs of the French War were
managed by the Home department; but in 1794 a principal Secretary
for War was appointed, and the business of the colonies was, in
1801, transferred to this new department, which thenceforth was
generally known as the Colonial, or Colonial and War,
department.<br>
<br>
In 1854 a fourth Principal Secretary of State was created for
War, and the affairs of the colonies came under the exclusive
charge of a Principal Secretary of State.<br>
<br>
In 1858 a Principal Secretaryship of State was created for the
affairs of India, and in 1885 a separate Secretary for Scotland
was appointed.</p>

<p><small>THE</small> earliest references to the colonisation of
the country formerly known as Terra Australis, appear in the
shape of certain proposals made to the British Government in the
sixteenth century. Early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth the
subject of colonies was discussed in England, and papers were
laid before her Majesty on the advantages likely to accrue from
new discoveries of lands not already taken possession of by the
Portuguese, Spaniards, or French, and especially of those
countries lying beyond the Equinoctial. <a href="#note-437" name=
"noteref-437" id="noteref-437">{2}</a> A later project, in
Secretary Walsingham's handwriting, for establishing a company to
trade beyond the Equinoctial line&#8212;Drake to be Governor for
life&#8212;still exists in the Record Office. This was prepared
in 1580, just after Drake's return home from his voyage round the
world.</p>
<p>Terra Australis was supposed to reach from the south towards
and beyond the tropic of Capricorn, nearly to the Equator, and
its coast-line to extend all round the South Pole. It is so
delineated on old globes and mappe-mondes (1530-66), and
described in an introduction to the account of Frobisher's First
Voyage (1578); those parts best known lying over against Cabo di
Buena Esperanza, whither the Portuguese in their voyages to India
had been driven out of their direct course by storms.</p>
<p>The only English colonies settled or attempted to be settled
in the reigns of Elizabeth and her successor, were those in North
America and Guiana.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, who believed he
had discovered Terra Australis, had petitioned Phillip the Third
of Spain to colonise that country lest it should be taken
possession of by the English. All the known memorials of Quiros
have been recently published (Madrid, 1877-82), together with the
narratives of his two voyages (1595 and 1606), preceded by that
of Mendana to the Solomon Islands (1567). One of the Quiros
memorials falling into the hands of Gresley, Secretary to the
English Embassy at the Spanish Court, was by him forwarded to his
Government in 1610. <a href="#note-438" name="noteref-438" id=
"noteref-438">{3}</a></p>
<p>Raleigh's first colony in North America (1587) had not
succeeded; but other settlements in Virginia and New England,
despite Spanish protests, were now being founded with some
measure of success. Sir James Lancaster, who had made voyages to
the East Indies frequently, proposed to have a ship sent through
the Straits of Magellan to the Solomon Islands, but without
result. James the First was not favourable to colonies. In the
last year of his reign, 1624-5, an eminent London
merchant&#8212;probably the most enterprising one of his
time&#8212;Sir William Courteen, desiring to extend his trade to
the Terra Australis, petitioned the king for the privilege of
establishing colonies there. Sir William, who was joint owner of
more than twenty ships of burden, employing four or five thousand
seamen, already carried on an extensive trade on his own account
to Portugal, Spain, Guinea, and the West Indies. The following is
a copy of his petition:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>To the Kings Most Excellent

<p>Having lent large sums of money to the King, Sir William
Courteen had some claim upon his Majesty's consideration. But it
does not appear that "all ye said islands and territories" were
granted to him. He seems to have been satisfied with a bad title
to the island of Barbados; where he sent (1626) fifty settlers,
who built a fort and remained there till it was taken from them
in 1628. He then sent eighty men and retook it in the name of the
Earl of Pembroke. Sir William died in 1636.</p>
<p>The next proposal for the colonisation of Terra Australis
bears the name of Captain Welbe, date 1716. One copy only of the
original is known to exist, and that is in the Biblioth&#232;que
Nationale, Paris. In the light of present knowledge this document
is of great interest; especially in connection with the reference
to the gold and silver mines, and the name of "New Wales".</p>
<br>
<p align="center">CAPTAIN JOHN WELBE'S<br>
Proposals<br>
for</p>
<p>Establishing a Company by the name of the London Adventurers
for carrying on a Trade to (and settling Colonies in) Terra
Australis, and working and improving the <i>Gold</i> and
<i>Silver</i> Mines which there abound.</p>
<blockquote>Whereas 'tis well known that there is no nation that
do Trade from the South Seas to the East Indies but the
Spaniards, whose India Trade is from Acapulco (on the coast of
Mexico in the South Seas) to the Phillippine Islands in the East
Indies, which ships, in going, keep always in the north-east
Trade wind; and in coming back they run to 40 or 45 degrees
north, to meet a westerly wind, to run them to the eastward, for
which reason those southern parts are not yet fully discovered,
nor any part of them settled by any European whatsoever, they
lying out of the way of all trading ships.<br>
<br>
If we look back and trace the course of those European Ships
Voyages that have sailed round the Globe, it may be easily seen
how far they were from making any Discoveries in those southern
parts, the course of their voyages not giving them any
opportunity for so doing.<br>
<br>
Magellanus, the discoverer of the Streights called after his
name, the first that sail'd west from the South Seas to the East
Indies, sailed along the coast of Peru and Mexico, till he came
to California, and thence took his departure for India, keeping
in the north-east Trade wind.<br>
<br>
Sir Francis Drake, said to be the first Commander that sail'd
round the Globe (Magellanus being killed by the Indians at
Mindanao Island), kept the coast of Peru and Mexico, and sailed
west for India, in the north-east Trade wind.<br>
<br>
Sir Thomas Cavendish the same.<br>
<br>
Captain Swann, one of the Buccaneers of America, with whom
Captain Dampier sail'd the first time round the Globe, kept in
the north-east Trade wind from California to India, and was
killed at Mindanao, as Magellanus was.<br>
<br>
Captain Rogers in the Duke and Dutchess, with the Acapulco ship,
kept likewise in the north-east Trade wind.<br>
<br>
It is here to be observed that from the coast of Peru West, to
the East Indies, is upwards of 2,500 leagues, which to the
southward of the Line is undiscovered to any European (Captain
Welbe excepted), who, in the course of his voyage round the world
with Captain Dampier, in the year 1703, 1704, 1705, 1706, having
many extraordinary opportunities of satisfying and informing
himself what discoveries had been made, by order of the Viceroys
of Peru, for 150 years past: was thereby well assured, that the
islands, named by the said Captain Welbe St. George's Islands and
New Wales, and some other islands thereabouts, which abound with
mines of gold and silver, belong to no European Prince or State,
and are therefore free for the first Discoverer to take
possession of, which mines the undertaker doubts not to prove,
will enrich the British Nation upwards of 50,000,000 sterling, if
taken possession of, and colonies settled, which is not half what
the kingdom of Peru has produced to the Spaniards since their
first settlement there under Francisco Pizaro, the first
Viceroy.<br>
<br>
It is therefore proposed that a Joint Stock, not exceeding
2,500,000, be raised to fit out ships, and settle colonies
forthwith, that the improvement and advantages of such valuable
discoveries may not be lost. And in order thereto, the said
Captain Welbe is now ready to grant permits to such persons who
are willing to be proprietors and adventurers in this said
undertaking. On grant of which permits the proprietors are to pay
in 1s. on every share, viz., 10s. for l,000L to enable the
undertaker to apply for and obtain a patent, and defray other
charges; and no more is to be paid in until at a general meeting
of, and by the proprietors, directors, and treasurers be chosen;
and then no more on each share than what the directors, at such
meeting, shall agree on, and find necessary for carrying on
effectually so valuable and advantagious a trade.<br>
<br>
N.B.&#8212;The proposer has no sinister ends, nor self-interest,
in view, and expects no pay, nor any reward, but such part of the
neat produce of profits, as the directors themselves shall think
fit, and agree, to allow him.</blockquote>
<p>Among the Sloane MSS. in the British Museum is an earlier
proposal by Captain Welbe to the British Government for a full
discovery of the Terra Australis. Burney, vol. iv, p. 517, gives
the following account of it:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>In 1713, John Welbe, a person who had been in the
South Sea with Captain Dampier, offered a plan to the British
Ministry for a voyage to make a full discovery of Terra
Australis. Welbe was an ingenious but distressed projector, and
it appearing that his proposals were made principally with a view
to his own relief, they obtained little attention. They were
referred to the Admiralty, and afterwards to the South Sea
Company, a Committee of which Company examined and "found the
matter out of their bounds." The heads of Welbe's scheme were, to
give them in his own words, as follows:&#8212;<br>
<br>
"For a good fourth-rate ship of the navy to be equipped for the
voyage, to carry 180 men, having only her upper tier of guns
mounted, leaving the rest ashore for the convenience of stowing
additional provisions, and for the case of the ship. The cooking
copper to be hung like a still, so that when water is wanted, we
can distil salt water and make fresh. Also a brigantine tender to
be provided. To go round Cape Horne to the Island Juan Fernandez;
thence to the Solomon Islands, discovered 150 years ago by the
Spaniards, but the Court of Spain did not think tit to settle
them by reason they had not entirely settled the main land of
Peru. On arriving, to search and discover what that country
abounds in, and to trapan some of the inhabitants on board and
bring them to England, who when they have learnt our language
will be proper interpreters."<br>
<br>
He proposes afterwards to sail to New Guinea, which he supposed
to be a part of Terra Australis, and there to make the like
examination.<br>
<br>
Welbe several times renewed his proposals. His plan and
application have been preserved in the Sloane collection of
Manuscripts, and his last application is dated in the latter part
of the year 1716, from Wood-street Compter, where he was then
confined for debt. He complains in it that he was brought to
distress by fourteen months' attendance, having in that time
presented three petitions to the King, besides petitioning the
Treasury and the Admiralty Board, without receiving any definite
answer.</blockquote>

<br>
Collation: Title, Advertisement [Sketch of Author's life].
Address to my Lords the Deputies to the Assembly of Seventeen
Representatives of the General Company of the East Indies of the
Low Countries, Method, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The advertisement is as follows:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">John Peter Purry, the Author of the following
memorial, was born at Neufchatel in Switzerland about the year
LXX of the last century, who having engaged for some time in the
wine trade, and meeting with misfortunes in it, contracted
himself to the Chamber of Amsterdam for the East Indies in
Batavia about the beginning of 1713; where by his plantations and
by being Header to the Reformed Church in that city, having
pretty well repaired his fortune in the year 1717, he presented
to the Governor-General of the East India Company, a proposal for
Settling a Colony in the Land of Nights, not far from the Island
of Java, which not having the good fortune to be approved of, he
obtained leave to return to Europe.<br>
<br>
In doubling the Cape of Good Hope he was so taken with the
admirable colonies he found there, that he was more and more
confirmed in the Thought of Immortalizing his Name with some
Settlement of the 33rd degree, either of Northern or Southern
Latitude. Arriving at Amsterdam in 1718, he presented there in
French the Memorial we now give to the Reader in English, to the
Lords the Directors of the Dutch East India Company, who
determine all matters relating to it. Neither this Memorial, nor
another which accompanied it, were well received insomuch that a
friend of his told privately he had best get out of the Way for
that some Things had been observed in both Papers which ought not
to be made public.<br>
<br>
He took the advice and went into France; from whence he made a
tour into his own country. But returning to Paris in that fatal
year, 1720, he lost in the Mississippi Company what he had got in
the East Indies. Here his former scheme reviv'd, and, having
modelled it to the French Settlements, he presented it to some of
the Prime Ministers, who referred it to the Royal Academy of
Sciences. Mons. Fontenelle returned this cautious answer that
they could not pass a judgement on a country which they had never
seen, and that therefore it would not be advisable to make
expensive settlements in places they were unacquainted with. This
was all the determination that could be got from him. The Journal
des Scavans, however, took notice of the Proposal, and gave a
fair representation of it. Rejected a Second Time, Mr. Purry came
into England, and printed his proposal here for establishing a
Colony on the English coast of America, southward enough for his
favourite degree. It was presented to the Duke of Newcastle as he
was walking with the king at Kensington in 1721. But neither here
could his scheme boast of the expected approbation. I remember,
however, that Sir Isaac Newton, to whom I communicated it, agreed
in general to the Principles of it, with a proviso that the
Nature of each Country and Soil should be first examined before
settlements were attempted.<br>
<br>
But about this time Georgia beginning to be talked of, Mr. Purry,
at the request of some Merchants, who wanted to know the
condition of that country, went thither. At his arrival, he first
took a general survey of it, then passed into Switzerland, and
brought from thence enough of his countrymen to establish a small
Colony, at the extremity of Carolina, just upon the river which
divides it from Georgia, where he died about ten years since, in
an advanced age: having first built a Town as a Monument to
himself, which still bears the name of Purisburg.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Fictitious Voyages</b>:&#8212;Works of this description
began to make their appearance early in the seventeenth century.
The first on the list appears to be Bishop Hall's:&#8212;</p>
<p>Mundus Alter et Idem, sive Terra Australis, ante hac semper
incognita, longis itineribus peregrini Academici nuperrime
lustrata. Auth. Mercurio Britannico, Josepho Hall.</p>
<p align="right">12mo., pp. viii, 224. Hannovi&#230;, 1607.</p>
<p class="quote">I can only produce two books by English authors
in the first part of the seventeenth century which fall properly
under the class of novels or romances, and of these one is
written in Latin. This is the Mundus Alter et Idem of Bishop
Hall, an imitation of the later and weaker volumes of Rabelais. A
country in Terra Australis is divided into four regions,
Crapulia, Viraginia, Moronea, and Lavernia. Maps of the whole
land and of particular regions are given; and the nature of the
satire, not much of which has any especial reference to England,
may easily be collected. Hallam, Literary History of Europe.</p>
<p>The next work of the kind was written in French:&#8212;</p>
<p>Les Avantures de Jacques Sadeur, dans la d&#233;couverte et le
voiage de la Terre Australe, contenant les co&#251;tumes et les
moeurs des Australiens, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="quote">This work went through several editions; Paris,
1692; Amsterdam, 1692; London, 1693; Pans, 1705. It was
translated into German under the title Neu Entdecktes Sudland,
Dresden, 1705, and published in a collection of Voyages
Imaginaires. Some curious particulars about the work and its
author may be seen in Bayle's Dictionary, art. Sadeur. The
author's name was Gabriel Foigny. A notice of his works will be
found in the Biographie Universelle.</p>

<p>The geographers of the early part of the eighteenth century
continued to describe the Terra Australis after the manner of
their predecessors, adding from time to time the names given to
new discoveries, chiefly those of the Dutch. Occasionally the
philosophers discussed the subject:&#8212;</p>

Australis Incognita, posteritati relicta, Vestigiis ix
Monstratis.</p>
<p align="right">8 pp. folio. Helmstadii, 1741.</p>
<p>Enterprise at home and abroad was too stagnant at this time
for the encouragement or support of any colonising schemes. But
the learned de Maupertuis having accepted an invitation from
Frederick the Great to settle in Berlin, he there addressed his
Letter to the King of Prussia on the Progress of the Sciences.
Among the sciences which stood in need of the support of a
sovereign were those connected with foreign discoveries, and
first of all, that of Terra Australis.</p>
<p class="quote">In the Terra Australis, the eminent savant
believed there would be found species different from those
contained in any other parts of the world, because they never
could have gone out of their own continent. Near it were islands
in which navigators assure us they have seen savages, men covered
with hair having tails; a middle species, between a monkey and a
man. "I would rather", he writes, "have an hour's conversation
with one of these than with the greatest wit in
Europe."&#8212;See English translation in Appendix to The
Schemer; or, Universal Satirist, by that great Philosopher,
Helter Van Scelter, London, 1765, pp. 249 <i>et seq</i>.</p>
<p>Maupertuis' suggestion was not to be lost. It was taken up by
an able advocate, Charles de Brosses, President of the Parliament
of Dijon, who collected in two quarto volumes the accounts of all
the voyages which had been made to les Terres Australes, De
Brosses divided his work into three sections, viz.: Australasia,
Polynesia, and Magellanica.</p>
<br>
<p><b>De Brosses</b>:&#8212;Histoire des Navigations aux Terres

plus ample d&#233;couvertes, et des moyens d'y former un
&#233;tablissement.</p>
<p align="right">4to., 2 vols. Paris, 1756.</p>
<p class="quote">In his preface, de Brosses explains the origin
of his work by saying that, shortly after the publication of the
letters of de Maupertuis, he was present at a private meeting of
literary men at which the letters were discussed; that he spoke
for half-an-hour on the proposal for making further discoveries
in the Terres Australes; and that, finding himself <i>au fait</i>
on the subject, he was led to undertake the task of collecting
the Voyages.</p>
<p>Speaking of the discoveries in the southern seas made
subsequent to the publication of his work, the <i>Biographie
Universelle</i>, in its notice of de Brosses, says&#8212;</p>
<p>Ou ne sait pas assez en France que de Brosses a eu, pour ainsi
dire, l'initiative de ces d&#233;couvertes; qu'il les a

<p>Burney, referring to the work of de Brosses, preface to vol.
i, p. x, says&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">It is very evident that the principal object of
de Brosses was to explain the advantages of distant colonies, and
to recommend the settlement of laud discovered in the southern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>His volumes were preceded and followed by others dealing with
the subject. See especially&#8212;</p>

<p class="quote">The writer (probably Harris's Editor) suggested
that the African Company should be invested with the exclusive
right of making discoveries and settlements in the Southern
Continent. If neither the African nor the East India Company
should think it expedient or consistent with their interests to
establish such settlements, he thought the duty should then
devolve upon the South Sea Company, who by their charter had the
power to do so.</p>

<p>This work was an English translation of de Brosses, with
additions. At the end of the third volume (pp. 715-745) there is
a chapter&#8212;"Of the method of forming Colonies in the Terra
Australis, and the Advantages that may be expected to result to
Great Britain from such Establishments in that Hemisphere."</p>
<p class="quote">The writer, following de Brosses, advised the
settlement of New Britain in Australasia, as being the most
advantageous situation with respect to the countries where
commerce was already established. Another advantage, he added,
"that distinguishes it, is the climate, as lying not far from the
Equator, where (according to Dampier) we may always expect to
find more materials for commerce than in higher latitudes. Van
Diemen's Land and New Zealand lie far to the south and are little
known. The coasts of New Holland are of very difficult access,
and the parts that lie next the South Sea absolutely naked and
barren. Carpentaria labours under the same disadvantage. None of
these places ever appear fit for the first attempts, though they
may be settled afterwards, and perhaps to advantage.... Both
Roggewein and Dampier agree in giving preference to New Britain.
The Ingenious French editor of the <i>Voyages aux Terres
Australes</i>, tome 2. p. 380, thinks there is no place so proper
as this to fix on. He proposes to settle it by sending three
ships from Pondicherry." (pp. 742-43.)</p>
<p>From this time forward voyages were made for the sake of
science rather than plunder. In 1764-68, three
expeditions&#8212;including vessels under the command of Byron,
Wallis, Carteret, and Cook&#8212;were sent to the South Sea.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Alexander Dalrymple **</b>, who had been in the East India
Company's service, and had returned home to advocate Southern
discoveries, hoped to receive the command of the expedition sent
out under Cook, the object of which was primarily to observe the
transit of Venus in the island of Otaheite. He
published&#8212;</p>

<p align="right">4to., 2 vols. London, 1777.</p>
<p>The author was the son of John Reinold Forster, who
accompanied Captain Cook as naturalist on the voyage. In his
preface the author mentions that his father had published the
"first specimen of his labours" in a work
entitled&#8212;Characteres Generum Plantarum quas in Insulis
Maris Australis colleg., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another work by the same author was published in 1778 under
the title&#8212;Observations made during a Voyage Round the World
on Physical Geography, Natural History, and Ethic Philosophy, by
John Reinold Forster, LL.D., &amp;c.</p>
<p align="right">4to. London, 1778.</p>
<p>The great field for colonisation in the southern part of the
world foretold by Quiros&#8212;long forgotten, but afterwards
revived by the works of de Brosses and Dalrymple&#8212;was made
manifest by Cook's voyage. He had discovered the insularity of
New Zealand, and sailed along the east coast of New Holland. The
advantages which had thus been secured for Great Britain were
emphasised in&#8212;</p>
<p>Political Essays concerning the Present State of the British
Empire.</p>
<p align="right">4to., pp. 3, 463, 464. London, 1772.</p>
<p>This may be considered the last word of the advocates of
Australian colonisation, prior to the Expedition under Governor
Phillip. In 1776 the Declaration of Independence by the Thirteen
Colonies of North America stopped the transportation of English
criminals there, and loyal colonists began to seek new
settlements. Some removed to Canada and Nova Scotia; others
thought of emigrating to the Southern Continent.</p>
<p><small>JAMES MARIA MATRA</small>, of Frome, proposed to the
Home Government that New South Wales should be set apart for
their reception, where they might repair their broken fortunes.
August, 1783.</p>
<p><small>SIR GEORGE YOUNG, R.N</small>., submitted another plan
in January, 1785, which was printed.</p>
<p align="right">Folio, pp. 4. London, 1785.</p>
<p class="quote">A fac-simile of this pamphlet was published by
Messrs. Angus and Robertson, of Sydney, booksellers, in 1888.</p>
<p>These schemes were duly entertained, and resulted in a
determination on the part of the Government to utilise New South
Wales as a penal settlement. The plan met with considerable
opposition. John Howard considered the "Botany Bay scheme
expensive, dangerous, and destructive." Others advised the
establishment of penal colonies nearer home, or in smaller
islands in mid-ocean, such as that of Tristan D'Acunha.</p>

<p>Dalrymple recommended the island of Tristan D'Acunha as more
suitable for a penal colony than Botany Bay. The pamphlet
(written in September and October, 1786) includes a letter (dated
July, 1785) addressed by the author to the Directors of the East
India Company, advising them against a project for settling
Norfolk Island, which was then within the limits of the Company's
Charter.</p>

<p align="right">8vo., pp. iv, 184. New York, n.d.</p>
<p>These works were compiled in London. A comparison with the
works of Collins and other writers of the time will discover
their true origin. In an anonymous work on New South Wales [by G.
Paterson] the writer says (pp. 390-391) that&#8212;"For a
considerable time previous to his death, Barrington was in a
state of insanity, brought about by his serious and sorrowful
reflections on his former career of iniquity. He expressed a very
considerable degree of displeasure, when he was in a state of
sanity, at his name being affixed to a narrative which he knew
only by report as being about to be published."</p>
<p>The celebrated Prologue, said to have been spoken at a
performance in Sydney, 16th January, 1796, including the
lines&#8212;</p>
<p class="poem"><small>True patriots all, for be it
understood,<br>

appeared in Barrington's History, edit. 1802 and 1810, pp.
151-153; but not in the earlier "Barrington" of 1800. The details
of the performance, even to the names of the principal
performers, are evidently taken from Collins (vol. i, pp.
448-449); but he says nothing about the Prologue.

By John Pinkerton. With Numerous Maps.</p>
<p align="right">4to., 2 vols. London, 1802.</p>
<p>The map of New Holland, at p. 467 of vol. ii, represents the
southern coast from "King George III Harbour" to Western Port, as
a blank.</p>
<p>The opinions of contemporary geographers with respect to New
Holland are stated as follows:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">Some suppose that this extensive region, when
more thoroughly investigated, will be found to consist of two,
three, or more vast islands, intersected by narrow seas; an idea
which probably arises from the discovery that New Zealand
consists of two islands, and that other new straits have been
found to divide lands in this quarter, formerly supposed to be
continuous.</p>
<p>Pinkerton suggested <small>NOTASIA</small> as a better name
than New Holland:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">While the term Australasia may be justly applied
to what is called New Holland and the circumjacent lands, the
name of that large island itself, so absurdly joined with New
South Wales, might perhaps be aptly exchanged for that of
<i>Notasia</i>&#8212;from the Greek word <i>Notos</i>, the South;
vol. ii, pp. 433-4.</p>
<p>His definition of the boundaries of Australasia, from the
geographer's point of view, includes the following
territories:&#8212;</p>
<p class="quote">1. Notasia, or New Holland, with any isles in
the adjacent Indian Ocean twenty degrees to the west, and between
twenty and thirty degrees to the east,&#8212;particularly<br>
2. Papua, or New Guinea;<br>
3. New Britain and New Ireland, with the Solomon Isles;<br>
4. New Caledonia and the New Hebrides;<br>
5. New Zealand;<br>
6. Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The southern boundary of Australasia "extends to latitude
50&#176; or even 60&#176;, where the islands of ice begin to
appear"; vol. ii, pp. 466-7. The boundaries to the north and east
are also defined, but at too great length for quotation.</p>
