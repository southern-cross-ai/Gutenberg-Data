<h2><a name="story1" id="story1"></a>DARK ANN</h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Dark Ann and Other Stories</i>, John Lane,
London, 1927</h3>

<p class="first">NOTHING could have been more neutral, more dull;
the scene was the lecture hall of one of our most learned
societies, as austere and grim a place as the cold mind and
lifeless taste of Science could conceive, or anyhow did conceive
and execute in the days when this hall, and many others, was
built.</p>

<p>A lecture was in progress.</p>

<p>A man as austere, as grim as the hall, but in the same way
rather grand and imposing, was in the rostrum, talking about
hygiene and sanitation.</p>

<p>Like the hall, like the society, he seemed, in his disdain of
any concession to the lighter graces, dreary and forbidding,
ageless, featureless, drab.</p>

<p>I wondered why I had come; Minnie Levine had brought me; she was
one of those women who try, and quite successfully, to make good
works fashionable.</p>

<p>This had brought her into the chill and lofty circle where Sir
William Torrance moved, and, somehow, to this lecture.</p>

<p>Not altogether purposelessly, for afterwards we were to take the
great man back to Minnie's reception and introduce him to a number
of other earnest and charming workers in the cause of health and
happiness for others.</p>

<p>Minnie had said a great deal about the personality of the
lecturer, but to me he seemed to have no personality; he was part
of the remote classic decorations of that depressing room,
something almost dehumanized.</p>

<p>Yet, as I studied the man (for there was nothing else to do
since I could not concentrate on the matter of his speech), I
discovered that he was not by any means unattractive, though
subdued to the drab dignity of his surroundings, eclipsed by the
sombre correctness of his orthodox clothes, those dull blacks,
greys and icy white linen.</p>

<p>He was not so old though his hair was ash coloured, his face
haggard, not so old, I was sure, perhaps forty-eight, fifty.
Handsome features, aquiline, dark, with a narrow high nose and full
lips, bluish eyes, cold and clever, a figure that would have been
graceful enough if he had not so carefully refrained from any
movement, any gesture, if he had not held himself with such
monotonous stateliness.</p>

<p>The lecture was over; I thought I caught Minnie's sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>I, too, was glad to leave, though it was a cruel winter's day
without, colourless, biting, grim.</p>

<p>We waited for the lecturer; he carefully and gravely answered
the earnest questioners who came timidly up to the platform, then
waited for us, methodically rolling up his charts of 'Drainage
Systems for Country Houses' that he had been showing us.</p>

<p>He was presented to me and I felt further depressed by his
lifeless courtesy; perhaps he had heard of me as a foolish trifler
in dreams and visions, a writer of stories fantastical and strange;
I felt uncomfortable thinking how he must despise me; of course I
didn't believe he had any right to despise me, yet, unreasonably it
made me wince to realize that he probably did, he had so much
weight about him, an air of being unassailable.</p>

<p>He hadn't much to say as we went home in Minnie's car; I believe
he was wondering why he had consented to come. I've often seen that
surprised resentment lurking in the eyes of Minnie's celebrated
guests.</p>

<p>What he did say was heavy and wise, fragments of his
lecture.</p>

<p>'Instructive but not amusing,' whispered Minnie, 'but rather a
dear, don't you think?'</p>

<p>'No, I really don't. He knows too much&mdash;he's quite dried
up.'</p>

<p>'But so good-looking,' insisted Minnie. 'And not
married&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A lucky escape for some woman'&mdash;the obvious gibe came
sincerely to my lips. 'Think of being married to a treatise on
Sanitation&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, he's much more than that,' said Minnie earnestly, 'a really
great doctor, you know.'</p>

<p>I did know, but I was quite vague as to his actual achievements;
one generally is vague as to the achievements of those outside
one's own world.</p>

<p>I noticed him once or twice, impassive, bored, grave, among the
guests; I was surprised not to see the familiar gesture of the hand
to the watch, the murmur of 'an appointment' which is such a man's
usual escape from a crowd of women.</p>

<p>But he stayed.</p>

<p>When tea was over and dancing had begun, he, alone for a moment,
looked round as if searching for someone.</p>

<p>He caught my eye and came so directly over to me that my
companion rose at once and wandered off.</p>

<p>Sir William took the vacant chair; I was more overwhelmed than
flattered.</p>

<p>'You must have been very bored this afternoon,' he said
seriously.</p>

<p>I replied that I rather made a point of never being bored, but
that I'd been depressed&mdash;and understood very little; I paid
him the compliment of not trying to 'play up' to him.</p>

<p>'Of course you were. You write, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Only a little. As an amateur.'</p>

<p>'I've read them. <i>Phantasmagoria</i>.'</p>

<p>This was amazing.</p>

<p>'Yes, they're phantasmagoria&mdash;don't you love the word? But
strange you should bother with them, Sir William.'</p>

<p>'Do you think so?'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;I shouldn't have thought you'd have much time for
that kind of thing.'</p>

<p>He looked at me, wistfully, I thought.</p>

<p>'Yet I could tell you something.'</p>

<p>And then he was silent, as if I had discouraged him; he seemed
so remote from the scene, the warm, shaded room, the dancers, the
hot-house flowers, that he made me too feel detached.</p>

<p>We were sitting a little apart in one of Minnie's famous alcoves
lit by a painted alabaster lamp; we were left alone, because all
the others were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>Minnie glanced at me and nodded cheerfully; I think that she was
rather glad to have the great man taken off her hands.</p>

<p>As for him, I really think he was as unconscious of his
surroundings now as he had been during his lecture, he never asked
if I danced, he never seemed to notice that anyone was dancing.</p>

<p>He spoke again, almost in a challenging tone.</p>

<p>'Do I seem to you very alien to all that?' he asked.</p>

<p>I was at a loss as to what thought he was finishing with this
sentence, and so I said, 'All&mdash;what?'</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>'Romance is perhaps the word.'</p>

<p>Even to me that word was rather profaned.</p>

<p>'Oh, Romance&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I use it,' said Sir William stiffly, 'in the purest sense. It
has of course been cheapened by our lesser writers. Like several
other beautiful words&mdash;love, lovely, and others. They become
<i>clichés</i>, slick, disgusting. Think, however, what Romance
would mean to a lonely man who never saw a newspaper or heard a
gossip and never read a book that was less than two hundred years
old.'</p>

<p>I agreed that everything was overdone.</p>

<p>'Nothing fresh is left,' I lamented, 'every story has been told
and staled.'</p>

<p>Sir William corrected me.</p>

<p>'You should know better. Told, but not staled. What of a kiss,
the rose's scent? You've been kissed before, if you're lucky;
you've smelt a rose before, if you've any sense&mdash;yet you are
just as eager for the present kiss, the present rose.</p>

<p>'And with Romance. It is always the same Romance, of course, but
only a fool seeks for novelty.'</p>

<p>He spoke abstractedly, dryly, and his words, so at variance with
his manner, surprised me a great deal.</p>

<p>'It is quite true,' I said, 'but I hardly thought you would know
as much, Sir William.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>I did not know how to explain to him how remote, how stern, how
impressive and cold he seemed.</p>

<p>'You're too wise,' I said, 'you know too much to know that.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. "With all thy wisdom get understanding", eh? Yes, I
know too much, and none of it much use. But I know that too. A
materialist may have his glimpses into spiritual matters.'</p>

<p>'Not if he's really a materialist, Sir William.'</p>

<p>He ignored that.</p>

<p>'I came here to speak to you,' he said in a coldly impersonal
tone, 'because of some things of yours I've read. I thought I'd
like to tell you something that happened to me, perhaps get you to
write it down as a sort of record. One ages, memory weakens. I
always fear that what is so vivid today tomorrow may be dim. That
is,' he added with perfunctory politeness, 'if it interests
you.'</p>

<p>I said with truth that it did interest me. Of course.</p>

<p>'That's good of you. And then, on my death&mdash;I am
considerably your senior&mdash;you might publish the story,
as&mdash;a lesson to other people.'</p>

<p>He looked at his watch (the familiar gesture at last!) and
excused himself in conventional tones.</p>

<p>Another time perhaps he might tell me the story? Or, no, there
wasn't a story. I hoped he wouldn't forget, but thought he
would.</p>

<p>Three days later he rang up to ask for an appointment; I begged
him to come that afternoon; I should be alone.</p>

<p>He came; immaculate, stately, unsmiling, very impressive.</p>

<p>And, after an apology for tea, he began speaking, looking into
the fire the while just as if I wasn't there; I saw at once that he
was intensely lonely and that it was an immense joy and relief for
him to speak, which he did carefully and without a trace of
emotion, in a concise, stately language.</p>

<p>'It's twenty years ago, 1905, exactly twenty years, in the
winter. I was very hard-working, very absorbed and very successful
for a youngster. I had no ties and a little money of my own, I'd
taken all the degrees and honours I could take, and I'd just
finished a rather stiff German course in Munich&mdash;physical
chemistry&mdash;and I was rather worn out.</p>

<p>'I had not begun to practise and I decided to rest before I did
so.</p>

<p>'I recognized in myself those dangerous symptoms of fatigue,
lack of interest in everything and a nervous distrust of my powers.
And by nature I was fairly confident, even, I daresay,
arrogant.</p>

<p>'While I was still in Munich a cousin I had almost forgotten,
died and left me a house and furniture.</p>

<p>'Not of much value and in a very out-of-the-way place.</p>

<p>'I thought the bequest queer and paid no attention to it; of
course I was rather pleased, but I decided to sell.</p>

<p>'I meant to live in London and I had not the least intention of
an early marriage, nor indeed of any marriage at all.</p>

<p>'I was nearly thirty and sufficiently resolute and
self-contained.</p>

<p>'When I returned to London and consulted my lawyers about the
sale of the house, which was called "Stranger's End", they advised
that I should see it first and check the inventories of the
contents.</p>

<p>'They said that there were some curious old pieces there I might
care to keep; I did not think this likely, as I had no interest in
such things, but I thought I would go to see the house.</p>

<p>'I was too tired for pleasure or amusement; one can be, you
know.</p>

<p>'The thought of this lonely, quiet house attracted me; it was
near Christmas and I dreaded the so-called festivities, the
invitations of friends, the upset to routine.</p>

<p>'I went to "Stranger's End" and my first impression justified my
lawyers' warning; it was not a very saleable property.</p>

<p>'The house stood one end of a lonely Derbyshire valley, on the
site of one much older that had been burnt down.</p>

<p>'The style was classic-Palladian, purplish brick, white
pilasters, hard, square, ugly, more like Kent than Wren.</p>

<p>'The garden had been very formal, with broderie beds, but was
neglected, the stucco summer-houses, statues and fountains being in
a dilapidated condition, and the <i>parterres</i> a tangle of wild
growth.</p>

<p>'The situation was lonely in the extreme, really isolated; the
railway had missed the valley and there was no passable motor road
near; the approaches to "Stranger's End" were mean tracks across
moor and mountain.'</p>

<p>Sir William Torrance was silent here; he seemed to sink into
deep abstraction, as he stared into the fire.</p>

<p>And I, too, could see what he was seeing, that solitary,
pretentious, ugly and neglected mansion in the Derbyshire
dales.</p>

<p>'It sounds haunted,' I suggested.</p>

<p>He roused himself.</p>

<p>'No, it wasn't. I never heard the least suggestion of that.
There was no story about the place at all. It had come to my cousin
through his father's people; our connection was through the female
side, and they had been quiet, prosperous folk who hadn't for a
hundred years lived much at "Stranger's End". But my cousin, an
eccentric sort of man, had taken a liking to the place.'</p>

<p>'Why did he leave it to you?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. We had been slightly friendly as boys, but he was
queer. We went such different ways. He was a little older than I.
And died rather tragically, through an accident. Well, there was
the place. I liked it.</p>

<p>'Really relished the isolation; I was terrified of a breakdown,
of losing my capacity, my zest for work; I thought&mdash;whatever I
do, I'll get fit.</p>

<p>'That was a very severe winter, at least in Derbyshire; the
fells and dales were covered with snow, and all that cracked stucco
frippery in the garden, those sham deities of the eighteenth
century, were outlined in white and masked in ice.</p>

<p>'I had no personal servant in those days; the caretaker, an old
man, and his widowed daughter looked after me; they were rather a
dour couple but efficient enough and seemed attached to "Stranger's
End", for they asked if I would "speak for them" to my purchaser
who did not yet exist.</p>

<p>'The house was furnished exactly as you would expect it to be,
panelled walls, heavy walnut furniture, indigo blue green tapestry,
gilt wood mirrors, and pictures of the schools of Van Dyck and
Kneller.</p>

<p>'It was a large house, much larger than you would think from
that stern façade, and I was there a while before I knew all the
rooms.</p>

<p>'I enjoyed, with a sense of irony, the grandeur of the state
bedroom which probably had chiefly been used for the "lying in
state" of defunct owners.</p>

<p>'The four-poster was adorned by dusky plumes and curtains stiff
with needlework, rotting at the cracks and faded a peculiar
dove-like colour.'</p>

<p>Sir William spoke with a lingering relish curious to hear.</p>

<p>'Strange,' I thought, 'that he should remember all these
details, strange, too, that this is the man who gave that drab
lecture in that drab hall.'</p>

<p>He seemed to want no encouragement nor comment from me, and
continued in his level, pleasant tones that were so virile and
powerful even when muted as they were now.</p>

<p>'I found, during those first few days, several odd pieces in the
house. Of course I had nothing to do but look for them.</p>

<p>'It was ferociously cold and snowed steadily; all prospect from
the windows even was blotted out.</p>

<p>'Among other things I found a little box of blue velvet sewn
with a very intricate design in seed pearl and embroidered in gold
thread&mdash;"Made by mee, Darke Ann". Impossible to describe how
that fascinated me!</p>

<p>'An empty, trifling sort of box, rather worn, odorous of some
aromatic&mdash;musk or tonquin.</p>

<p>'Made by "Darke Ann"!</p>

<p>'Why should she so describe herself, in that formal age to which
she belonged?</p>

<p>'There was no date, but I thought the thing went back to the
time of my grandmother.</p>

<p>'It was because, perhaps, my brain was so exhausted, because I
was so studiously keeping it free from all serious matter, that
this absurd detail so obsessed me; I had never had any imagination
nor cared for fanciful things, I'd worked too hard.</p>

<p>'But now, when my mind was empty this seized on it&mdash;"Darke
Ann."</p>

<p>'I had no difficulty in visualizing her; I could see her moving
about the house, bending over that box, looking out of the windows
on to the snow.'</p>

<p>'The house, then, was haunted after all,' I suggested.</p>

<p>Sir William denied this earnestly.</p>

<p>'No. I have been trying to convey to you that it was not.</p>

<p>'Nothing of the kind. It was merely that I, shut up alone in
this queer (to me) house in this great solitude, was able to
picture, very clearly, this creature of my fancy.</p>

<p>'Purely of my fancy:</p>

<p>'You know how the snow will give one that enclosed feeling, shut
in alone, remote, softly imprisoned.</p>

<p>'So few people came to the house, and those few I never saw.</p>

<p>'Then one night&mdash;it could not have been long before
Christmas, of which festival I took no account&mdash;I went up to
my room holding a lamp&mdash;there was no other means of lighting
in the old house&mdash;and glancing at the bed I saw
there&mdash;'</p>

<p>He paused, and when he continued I had the strangest sensation,
for this man, so dry, so austere, so conventionally clothed, whom I
had heard lecturing on 'Sanitation', whose reputation was so lofty,
whose life and career were well known to have been so dry, cold and
laborious, spoke like a poet making an embroidery of beautiful
words.</p>

<p>'A woman,' he went on with infinite tenderness. 'She lay lightly
to one side with her arms crossed, so that the delicate fingers
rested on her rounded elbows, but so lightly! She wore a plain robe
and a cap, with a crimped edge, tied under her chin; tucked into
her breast was a posy of flowers, winter flowers, aconite, I think.
She was so fine, so airy that she did not press the bed at all, but
rested there, as a little bird might rest on a water flower without
rippling the pool.</p>

<p>'She smiled; her face was soft and dimpled, her eyes closed, yet
not so completely that a streak of azure did not show beneath the
fragile lids; her lips were full, but pale&mdash;the whole colour
of her pearl and mist, merged into the faded tarnish of the
bed.'</p>

<p>Sir William, who had been gazing into the fire, suddenly looked
at me.</p>

<p>'Not a ghost,' he said. 'I knew she was not there. I knew the
bed was empty. Hallucination is perhaps the word. I had been
over-working. Mind and nerves were strained.</p>

<p>'I told myself that she was not there, and I seated myself with
my needless lamp beside the bed and looked at her; I say, needless
lamp, for when I had extinguished it, I saw her in the dark as
easily, as precisely.</p>

<p>'Then the window must rattle at the pane and make me look round
with a start, and when I looked back again she was gone.</p>

<p>'The next day I examined my casket of blue velvet with even
greater tenderness, and chancing to pull at a little odd thread,
ripped the stuff, so old and perished it was, so that there was an
ugly slit across the lid.</p>

<p>'I was looking at this in much chagrin when my caretaker
entered.</p>

<p>"Who would this be?" I asked, as lightly as I could. "Darke
Ann"?</p>

<p>"That would be Lady Ann Marly, sir," he answered sullenly.
"There's her portrait upstairs."</p>

<p>"Where?" I was startled.</p>

<p>"In the attics. I don't think you've been up to the attics,
sir."</p>

<p>'I went; that bitter, windy day I went up to the attics of
"Stranger's End". The snow had ceased and I could see the valley
white from end to end, and the hills, sombre against a sky like a
grey goose's breast.</p>

<p>'There was the portrait, standing with others amid dusty lumber,
cobwebs and decay.</p>

<p>'It was she, of course, Dark Ann, but as I turned the picture
round I was shocked.</p>

<p>'She was so much further away than I had thought.</p>

<p>'A hundred years, I had guessed, but the costume was that of the
first Charles, a tight gown of grey satin, monstrous pearls at
throat and ears, a confusion of jet black ringlets and the face
that I had seen in my&mdash;hallucination.</p>

<p>'It was a fine painting by that sterling artist, Janssens van
Ceulen, and I wondered why it had been banished to that sad
obscurity.</p>

<p>'On the black background was painted "<i>The Lady Ann Marly,
aetat. 25, 'Darke Ann.</i>'"</p>

<p>'Dark she was, as a gipsy, as a Spaniard, in eyes and hair, yet
pure and clear in her complexion as a lily, as a rose.</p>

<p>'I had the picture taken downstairs and hung in the room where I
usually sat. The man, old Doveton, knew nothing of the portrait, or
of the Lady Ann Marly, only what I could see for myself, the names
on canvas and casket, but he told me that the Marlys were buried in
Baswell Church and probably this "black Madam" amongst them, and
also that there was an antique shop in the same town where I could
get my casket repaired.</p>

<p>'I will not bother you,' said Sir William at this part of his
extraordinary narrative, 'with any of my feelings, moods, or states
of mind. I will merely tell you the facts.</p>

<p>'The first day it was fit to leave the house (for the snow had
fallen again in great abundance), I went down across the valley to
Baswell, a town so small, so old, so grim and silent, that it
seemed to me like a thing imagined, not seen.</p>

<p>'The church, heavy, mutilated, dark, squatted on a little slope
and was flanked by tombs so gaunt, monstrous, ponderous and grim as
to seem a very army of death; the snow touched them here and there
with a ghastly white, and the ivy on the tower was a green darker
than black against that pallid winter sky.</p>

<p>'Inside, the place was musty, dull, crowded with tombs, knights,
priests, ladies, children in busts and effigies&mdash;so much dust
on everything!</p>

<p>'As if it had risen from the vaults below to choke the holy
air!</p>

<p>'The pale dimness of the faint December light struggled through
panes of old, dingy glass in withered reds and blues, only to be
blocked by melancholy pillars and frowning arches.</p>

<p>'I found her tomb; a gigantic rococo urn draped with a fringed
cloth with boastful letters setting forth her prides and virtues,
and a Latin epigram, florid and luscious, punning on her name of
"Dark Ann" and the eternal Darkness that had swallowed her
loveliness.</p>

<p>'She had died, unmarried, "of a sudden feaver" in her 25th year,
1648.</p>

<p>'The year the portrait was painted.</p>

<p>'I had the casket in my pocket and I set out to find the antique
shop.</p>

<p>'There was only one, in a side street, in a house as old, as
sad, as grim as the church, with a tiny window, crowded by
melancholy lumber, the broken toys and faded vanities of the
dead.</p>

<p>'Clocks that had stopped for ever, rusty vessels from which no
one would drink again, queer necklaces no woman would ever again
clasp round her throat, snapped swords and chipped tea
cups&mdash;oh, a very medley of pathetic rubbish!</p>

<p>'I pulled the bell, for the door was locked, and was opened
immediately by a woman who stood smiling and asking me in out of
the uncharitable afternoon.</p>

<p>'It was Dark Ann&mdash;or, as my common sense assured me, a
creature exactly like her.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" I asked stupidly.</p>

<p>"Ann Marly," she replied in the sweetest accents.</p>

<p>"Why, I've just been looking at your tomb."</p>

<p>'She smiled, not, though, surprised.</p>

<p>'"I believe there is such a name in the churstory-many of them,
indeed. The Marlys were great people round about here. And yet we
have been long away and only just returned."</p>

<p>'As she spoke she held the door for me and I entered the low,
dusky shop, which was piled with lumber and lit by only a twilight
greyness.</p>

<p>'"Long away?" I echoed.</p>

<p>'"Yes, a long time," she smiled. "And, please what did you
want?"</p>

<p>'In a delicious amaze I handed her the casket; she looked at it
and sighed.</p>

<p>'"You want that mended?"</p>

<p>'"Yes, please&mdash;she was called Dark Ann and that should be
your name too, you know."</p>

<p>'She did not answer this, but said gravely that the box could be
mended&mdash;she herself would do the exquisite stitching.</p>

<p>'I could look at nothing but the lady&mdash;I must use this
word; neither woman nor girl will express this creature.</p>

<p>'She wore a dark dress that might have been of any period, low
in the neck, and the clouds of her dark ringlets were lightly
confined by a comb I could not see.</p>

<p>'She asked me into an old room at the back of the shop, and
there she gave me tea in shallow yellow cups.</p>

<p>'The whole place was old, she said&mdash;the high-backed cane
chairs in which we sat, the boards beneath our feet, the beams
above our heads, the dark pictures of carnations and gillyflowers
in gilt bronze frames, the sea green glass mirror in red
tortoiseshell, all these things were old.</p>

<p>'She and her grandfather had opened the little shop only lately,
and only, it seemed, because they wanted to come back to Baswell;
she told me nothing more of herself, nor did I speak of myself.</p>

<p>'I could not think of her as another than the Dark Ann of the
portrait, the casket, the tomb; I did not wish to think of her as
another; hallucination and reality blended in one.</p>

<p>'I went over every day to see her; it was understood we were
lovers, that we should marry and live in "Stranger's End" all our
lives.</p>

<p>'Understood but not spoken of&mdash;</p>

<p>'Once I brought her up to the ugly, queer house that now I no
longer had any intention of selling.</p>

<p>'I had found an old pair of tiny gauntlets in a chest, much
worn, fringed with gold; she slipped them on, and they fitted to
the very creases.</p>

<p>'Enough of this.</p>

<p>'As you know, one can't describe a rapture&mdash;sometimes, when
I stood near her, there was a sense of radiance, well&mdash;</p>

<p>'With every year it becomes more difficult to recall, sometimes
I forget it altogether, and yet I know it was there, it actually
happened&mdash;that time of ecstasy.'</p>

<p>He was silent for a little, and in my quiet room I could see the
glittering evanescent gleams of a vision that would not wholly
vanish through all the prosaic years.</p>

<p>'And I suppose,' I said, 'that you forgot your work and your
ambitions.'</p>

<p>He looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>'That was exactly what happened. I remembered nothing, I lived
in the moment, I hardly thought even of the future, though that was
to be spent with her. I lived in that queer, ugly house in that
lonely valley, and I went to and fro that grim, silent little town,
accompanied by snow, wind and clouds, to sit in the little dim
parlour behind the huddled shop and drink tea with Ann Marly out of
those flat yellow cups, beneath the old beams, the old pictures,
lit by a clear fire that glittered on the smooth surface of bluish
tiles with puce-coloured landscapes, and the mellow radiance of wax
candles in heavy plated sticks that showed the red copper through
where they were worn.'</p>

<p>'You remember it all very distinctly, Sir William.'</p>

<p>'Even the threads in her dress&mdash;where the sleeve was sewn
to the bodice&mdash;a little lighter than the silk.</p>

<p>'I said I would keep to the facts,' he sighed. 'So let all that
go. One day I received a telegram.</p>

<p>'I read it as if it had been in an unknown language at
first.</p>

<p>'When I came to understand it, I remembered who I was, where I
was, what I had been and hoped to be, what was expected of me.</p>

<p>'It was from a friend, a man I greatly admired and respected, a
really eminent, brilliant doctor&mdash;</p>

<p>'It was a long telegram.</p>

<p>'At that time Medicine was beginning to be very interested in
Encephalitis Lethargica and a Swiss doctor claimed to have found
a&mdash;what you would call a cure. Would I go, with three other
men and investigate, report, and if need be, learn the
treatment?</p>

<p>'I was excited, alert; I wired back an acceptance; in
twenty-four hours I was in London.</p>

<p>'I had been tremendously interested in this disease, so rare,
deadly and horrible, with its terrible <i>sequelae</i>, of
<i>dementia praecox</i>, change of character and loss of memory,
and I was again the careful, keen man of science, trained to test,
to doubt, to explore&mdash;</p>

<p>'We were in the train for Geneva before I thought of Dark
Ann.</p>

<p>'I wired her from the first stop; I didn't really know her
address, I had never noticed the name of the shop or the street,
but I put "Miss Ann Marly, Baswell, Derby"; the place was so small
I had no doubt it would find her; I wrote from Geneva, I said I was
coming back.</p>

<p>'I wrote and wired often enough during three weeks.</p>

<p>'But she never sent me any message.</p>

<p>'I blamed myself; my flight had been atrocious, I could not
explain it to myself, it was extraordinary, incredible. I had
started off like a man wakened from a dream!</p>

<p>'She was offended, angry. I thought it reasonable that she
should be, I thought of her always as waiting for me.</p>

<p>'It was a month before I got back&mdash;the Swiss doctor's work
was interesting, but there was nothing in it, really.</p>

<p>'I returned to Derbyshire.</p>

<p>'It was still cold, grey, iron-like in earth and sky.</p>

<p>'"Why on earth is this house called 'Stranger's End'?" I asked
old Doveton.</p>

<p>'"I don't know, sir. But it was a fancy in those old days, I
think."</p>

<p>'I went to Baswell.</p>

<p>'And this is pretty well the end of my story,' said Sir William
ironically.</p>

<p>'She was dead?'</p>

<p>'I could not find the shop. In the street where I could have
sworn it was, stood an old empty house; the neighbours said it had
been empty a long time, they remembered no antique shop, no Ann
Marly&mdash;they were vague, stupid, unfriendly.</p>

<p>'I ransacked the town; she, her grandfather, the shop with that
delicious parlour had utterly disappeared.</p>

<p>'I went to the post office and they showed me the last of my
little heap of letters; the others had travelled back to
Switzerland through the dead letter office and must now be waiting
for me at my London address.</p>

<p>'"There's a name like this in the church," said the postmaster
sullenly, looking at me queerly, "on a tomb. I've never heard of
another here."</p>

<p>'I brought Doveton in to Baswell and made him point out the shop
he had recommended for the repair of the velvet box.</p>

<p>'He showed me a dingy furniture shop in the High Street where
they did upholstering.</p>

<p>'I asked him if he remembered the lady who had come to
"Stranger's End".</p>

<p>'And the sulky fellow said that he did not, which may have been
true, for I brought her and took her away myself and I do not think
she met either of the servants.'</p>

<p>I knew that he had never found her; the room seemed full of a
miasma of regret, of remorse, of yearning.</p>

<p>'So you went back to your work,' I said tentatively, for I was
not sure of his control.</p>

<p>'Yes, I did. I sold the house and all the contents.' He looked
at me wildly. 'I burnt the portrait, I could not endure it. I sold
the house to the neighbouring lord who wanted the ground for his
shooting&mdash;it was just in his way, that old garden, that old
ugly house. He destroyed both. I wouldn't have sold to anyone who
had not promised to destroy.'</p>

<p>He looked withered, shrunk.</p>

<p>'I have the little blue box, so neatly mended, full of dead
aconites, like she held against her breast&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You're confusing the vision and the reality,' I said;
'that&mdash;hallucination must have been the first Ann&mdash;after
death, I rather think.'</p>

<p>'After death,' repeated Sir William.</p>

<p>'You've done good work,' I reminded him, 'devoted yourself to
real, fine, man's work&mdash;she would have spoilt you for that,
perhaps.'</p>

<p>He said drearily:</p>

<p>'Yes, I've had my work. And nothing else.'</p>

<p>'Well, fame, applause, gratitude, money, honours.'</p>

<p>'Oh, those,' he looked at me vaguely, 'but I never had another
dream. Not one. Now if that telegram hadn't come&mdash;'</p>

<p>He paused and I finished for him:</p>

<p>'It broke the spell, you mean. It restored you to your normal
self&mdash;it made you return to your normal life.'</p>

<p>'Exactly.' He was now composed, austere, even ironic again. 'I
would give all I've ever gained since to have that moment again, to
have that choice&mdash;the dream or the bread and water. And at the
moment I didn't know it was a choice.'</p>

<p>'You wish you hadn't gone?'</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>'Do I wish I hadn't gone! Haven't I told you the story as a
warning? That was the only real thing that ever happened to
me.'</p>

<p>He turned to the door.</p>

<p>'But Ann, Ann Marly?' I asked. 'What of her? Why did she
disappear?'</p>

<p>'Why did she come, you mean,' he answered dryly. 'I lost her,
because I forgot how to dream.'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;she didn't really exist?' I felt a pang of
fear.</p>

<p>Sir William Torrance smiled.</p>

<p>'I'm due the other end of London at six&mdash;I've talked you to
death. Good-bye.'</p>

<p>His manner was correct, lifeless again; I knew from the papers
that he was lecturing on 'Bacteriology in Food' at some
institute.</p>

<p>I let him go, there was nothing to be said.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<h2><a name="story2" id="story2"></a>DECAY</h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Seeing Life! And Other Stories</i>, Hurst &amp;
Blackett, London, 1923</h3>

<p>I want to write it down at once, to get it 'out of my head' as
they say, though why one should suppose these things are in one's
head, I don't know&mdash;they seem to me all about us, flavouring
the food we eat, colouring the sky.</p>

<p>Of course I've got the journalist's habit of scribbling too, it
is so much easier to jot things down than explain them by
speech.</p>

<p>To us, at least.</p>

<p>And you are so far away it is a good excuse to send 'newsy'
letters. Only, I've got a feeling that in Lima this will read,
well, <i>queer</i>.</p>

<p>Still you <i>must</i> be interested and I must write, no, I
forestall your objection, it won't do for 'copy'. I'm not spoiling
a good 'scoop'.</p>

<p>What I have got to say can never be published.</p>

<p>Nor written to anyone but yourself&mdash;and you won't speak of
it, I know.</p>

<p>Good Lord, you won't <i>want</i> to.</p>

<p>You'll remember the people as they would you&mdash;we were all
in the same 'set' together for so long&mdash;I think you were the
first to break away when you got this Lima job, weren't you?</p>

<p>And soon after that came the marriage of Cedric Halston.</p>

<p>You heard all about it, I sent you the 'cuttings' written by our
own colleagues&mdash;you were rather fond of Halston, I think.</p>

<p>So was I.</p>

<p>Of course we were rather prejudiced by his being called Cedric
and writing poetry, but it was such good stuff and he was such a
decent sort and, of course, being so palpably ruined in Fleet
Street! Much too good for what was too good for the rest of us,
wasn't he?</p>

<p>And rather more poverty-stricken than anyone ought to be it
seemed to me.</p>

<p>Lord! The sheer sordidness of Halston, 'hard-upishness'!</p>

<p>He couldn't write his stuff for grind and worry and
despair&mdash;but the little bits that struggled through as it
were, were jolly fine.</p>

<p>Even the old Die-hards that 'slam the door in the face of
youth', etc., etc., said he was&mdash;well, the right stuff.</p>

<p>None of your crazy, mazy, jig-saw, jazzy poets, poison green and
liver yellow, but the 'real thing'.</p>

<p>Like Keats.</p>

<p>Of course there ought to have been money in a stunt like that,
being the real thing, I mean, and starving, but poor old Halston
never could work it, could he? He just&mdash;starved.</p>

<p>Not very picturesquely.</p>

<p>Till he met Jennifer Harden.</p>

<p>(Did you ever think how <i>wrong</i> that 'Jennifer' was? I'd
never seen the name before except signing one of those articles
that begin, 'It's <i>ever</i> so crowded on the Riviera now, and oh
my dear'&mdash;you know the patter&mdash;and the people who write
it!)</p>

<p>You know they married&mdash;one rather wanted to jeer, but
couldn't&mdash;we all sat back and looked humble.</p>

<p>It was so tremendous you could only describe it in terms of
claptrap, 'Abelard and Heloise' a 'grande passion' and 'immortal
love', 'eternal devotion', 'twin souls' and all the rest of the
good old frayed symbols, old chap, but they are getting
worn&mdash;I'm thinking.</p>

<p>You remember I sent you her photo? One of those misty affairs
looking like&mdash;well, <i>not</i> like Jennifer Harden.</p>

<p>Still, she was beautiful, but out of drawing&mdash;lots of
money, lots of taste, not too young, by any means&mdash;and then
the 'love of a lifetime' thrown in.</p>

<p>She didn't mind using that phrase about him&mdash;publicly, in
the woman's club she ran, and where she had met him&mdash;lured to
gas on 'Truth in relation to Modesty' by the bribe of a good
dinner. She also said she worshipped him&mdash;I admired her for
that&mdash;you know they take a bit of saying, those sort of things
now-a-days!</p>

<p>And he raved about her&mdash;got the rose-coloured spectacles
firmly fixed and took her on as she was, 'Jennifer' and
all&mdash;dashed into poetry and spread himself out over ivory
pomegranates, roses, and all the rest of the irrelevant stuff we
drag in to say a woman's a <i>woman</i>. Do you remember the old
Italian who saw his beloved at the fountain and said:</p>

<p>'She alone of all the world is worthy to be called a woman?'</p>

<p>That is the prettiest compliment I know of.</p>

<p>Well, to return to the Halstons, they were married and I don't
suppose you ever heard any more of them.</p>

<p>It is three years ago.</p>

<p>You know how lucky we all thought him&mdash;she really had such
a lot of money.</p>

<p>And money had always been just what Halston wanted.</p>

<p>Of course they were very wonderful about it: he was 'so humble
in his great happiness, he could not let paltry pride stand in the
way', and she only 'valued her fortune in that it could minister to
his genius'&mdash;a pity how all these fine sentiments slip into
'clichés'.</p>

<p>I suppose someone believes them, or means them, sometimes.</p>

<p>I wonder?</p>

<p>Well, they cleared out. She bought a place in Herts and called
it 'Enchantment'. Why not, after all? You might really feel that, I
suppose.</p>

<p>Well, they shut themselves in this Paradise&mdash;never came to
town, hardly ever wrote&mdash;sometimes a few 'choice' poems from
him, the kind that goes with handmade paper and silk ties and you
keep reading over feeling sure that it means much more than it
possibly could&mdash;and sometimes letters from her to 'privileged'
friends (they really thought they were) letters that are like
screams of happiness.</p>

<p>Of course we all thought it rather wonderful that they could
stay shut up like that and enjoy it&mdash;it was quite a blow for
the real cynics.</p>

<p>'A case in a million' was all they could say.</p>

<p>He never wrote to anyone and there was not one of us who would
not have thought it cheek to write to him, we even sank to
seriously thinking of him as 'a God-sent genius'.</p>

<p>Well, here comes what I must set down&mdash;only to you,
Lorimer.</p>

<p>Halston and I knew you best of all in the old days and you are
the only person I can tell.</p>

<p>Forgive the preamble, but I have a sense of your being so far
away&mdash;I imagine you saying: 'Who is Halston?'</p>

<p>I haven't mentioned him for so long&mdash;there was nothing to
mention&mdash;'Happy nations', etc. Here is the story.</p>

<p>I was sent down to Hertford town a few weeks ago to investigate
some ghost story, you know what a rage that sort of thing is with
us just now, all of us shouting things you can hardly say in a
whisper and trying to disprove what no one can prove.</p>

<p>The case was interesting and kept me some time&mdash;the day
before I was due back in London I met Halston in the High Street.
He seemed very cordial and prosperous, had a good car waiting, was
rather too well dressed in uncommon kind of clothes&mdash;sort of
peasant handicraft and Savile Row combined. But I did not think he
looked well, strained, aged and thin&mdash;but this he explained by
the fact that he was writing an Epic.</p>

<p>(Why do you smile, Lorimer, people <i>have</i> written Epics,
you know.)</p>

<p>That was why he had been shut away all the time&mdash;that great
work might grow under the beautiful ministrations of his
wife...Jennifer, I gathered, was really running a little Paradise
for his special benefit...she had just snatched him away from all
that was ugly or crude or mean or distressing and lapped him in
Love and Beauty and Service...</p>

<p>Of course I grinned...but I was ashamed of grinning.</p>

<p>Halston did not seem to notice; he actually asked me over to
'Enchantment' to stay a few days.</p>

<p>Being a free lance I could accept and did&mdash;you can imagine
my curiosity&mdash;a vulgar thing to admit to, but don't you think
it will be our first emotion if we ever step into Heaven?</p>

<p>Imagine the relish of being able to settle those
questions&mdash;'What is God really like?' and 'those robes and
crowns?' and the 'many mansions?'&mdash;and little private pet
queries of your own.</p>

<p>That was how I felt as I motored over to 'Enchantment' which was
known to the outsider as a very delightful Tudor Farm House,
completely brought up to date, that had formerly been called
Eversley Lodge and run by a city gentleman, whose reputation was
more noted for lustre than solidity. I found the place (which was
isolated, a great way from the station, a good way from the road)
perfect.</p>

<p>Rather like the 'Ideal Homes' they make so much of just now,
still they <i>are</i> ideal, aren't they?</p>

<p>Well, here it all was, 'pleasance', 'pleached walk', sunk ponds,
statues, peacock, arbours, box hedges, astrolabes,
sundials&mdash;all the bag of tricks and inside everything done by
electricity and servants so efficient you forgot they were there.
Wonderfully comfortable.</p>

<p>Everything right&mdash;flowers, pictures, furniture,
food&mdash;the last word in little contrivances for ease and
luxury&mdash;three cars, I think, electric bells disguised as
lanthorns and telephones concealed in sedan chairs, wood fires to
'look nice' and steam heating. Elzivirs to tone with the walls and
modern books slipped into brocade covers to read, you know the kind
of thing!</p>

<p>But really perfect!</p>

<p>Halston had a wing built on specially for
himself&mdash;specially for the epic, I ought to say, perhaps.</p>

<p>The most marvellous writing-room and library. I don't know what
he hadn't got.</p>

<p>It was all 'choice'; I hate the word but no other will do.</p>

<p>All really 'choice' and as I was gaping round, in came
Jennifer.</p>

<p>And she was 'choice' too.</p>

<p>Just a rough silk dress, a girdle of queer stones no one else
would have liked, leather shoes simply asserting they were
hand-made&mdash;and a manner.</p>

<p>She was gracious&mdash;sweeter than anyone need or ought to be,
I thought, but I hadn't quite got the atmosphere.</p>

<p>'Our first guest,' she murmured, holding out both hands. 'How
strange Cedric should meet you. He so seldom goes to the town, or
ever leaves the house. He doesn't care to,' she added with a thrill
in her voice.</p>

<p>She looked at him and he looked at her and murmured,
'Jennifer.'</p>

<p>While we had dinner&mdash;all excellent&mdash;that evening I
observed her; she absolutely fascinated me and I want to describe
her to you, Lorimer.</p>

<p>She is tall, with wide shoulders and a full Rosetti sort of
neck, and a head rather nicely set, dark waved hair gathered in a
knot at her nape and good forehead and dark rather flat
eyes&mdash;then the nose tight, the lips hard and crooked, the
complexion harsh and grained with red and the chin too small,
running with a bad line into the Rosetti throat.</p>

<p>She lisped a little and showed more of her teeth than her lips
when she talked.</p>

<p>Graceful enough she somehow gave an impression as I have said of
beauty; she had a still yet enthusiastic manner and an air of
almost incredible fastidiousness and refinement.</p>

<p>The conversation was delicately 'high-brow', and afterwards she
played to us (yes, it was a Scriabine, and someone else, unknown to
me who makes even Scriabine seem old-fashioned!) then he played and
she stood behind him and rested her hands on his shoulders, and
when it was over raised his face with slow fingers and kissed
him.</p>

<p>There was a lot of this sort of thing; she, Jennifer, looked
through me, with a sort of 'divine pity'&mdash;but she was kind,
very kind.</p>

<p>I soon learnt that Halston's 'sanctum' was 'just for writing'
upstairs they shared the same room; he hadn't a corner, not even in
the 'sanctum' for she would glide in there and sit in place of the
banal secretary who could not have been tolerated in
'Enchantment'.</p>

<p>Not a corner&mdash;the woman pervaded the whole house&mdash;but
why not?</p>

<p>You don't want corners in Paradise.</p>

<p>There was a day or two of this; I don't know why I stayed save
that I was really rather fascinated.</p>

<p>Wanting to pick holes and not able to&mdash;you know.</p>

<p>I'm not sneering when I say again that it was really
perfect.</p>

<p>Comfort, beauty, ease, leisure&mdash;every book, picture,
magazine you could think of, the exquisite garden, the marvellous
service (the servants were all in some quarters of their own, I
believe, so seldom did one see them). And always Jennifer in
tasteful gowns, in pretty poses moving lightly about doing useless
beautiful things.</p>

<p>And always Cedric in his good quiet clothes with his fountain
pen and his smile, and his running his fingers through his hair and
his one or two dropped words that she understood so perfectly and
took up with that bright brave smile 'one soul signalling to
another along the ramparts of eternity'&mdash;that was Jennifer's
smile.</p>

<p>She knew it and so did I; but I wished she had prettier
teeth.</p>

<p>Of course, I should not have been noticing teeth, or the way she
whitened her rather red throat, or the quick glitter of her eyes so
out of harmony with her slow speech...but I still had not quite got
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Of course also there were no callers or callings, the mere
thought was like a blasphemy, the isolation was as complete as the
rarefied air...it was really rather wonderful how they did it.</p>

<p>You will have guessed there were no children, what an intrusion
children would have been in such a life!</p>

<p>One rather wondered...it is always the important things one
mustn't touch on isn't it? The things that matter most, that fill
our souls, our minds, even our eyes...I'm always amazed at our
eternal reticences...well, there were no children and I am queer in
my views on marriage without children, it is a tricky business this
mating...one knows too much...you've got to be jolly careful the
people you marry to each other or, well, sometimes I've felt
nauseated.</p>

<p>Anyhow, here were two carrying it off beautifully&mdash;all
grossness purged away, they would tell you, the souls in perfect
communion&mdash;all lovely and delicate, serving Art&mdash;beauty,
nature, God. Yes, but why didn't she give the poor devil a corner
to himself?</p>

<p>I don't believe he was alone for five minutes of the day or
night&mdash;she used to speak of '<i>our</i> bedroom' and carry up
flowers and fountain pens and biscuits, for the table beside
<i>their</i> bed...ugh! I became uneasy at meeting his glance, I
don't know why.</p>

<p>Then...I was coming in from the garden the fourth evening she
was playing as usual, in a white gown that didn't suit her, and he
was seated on his pure coloured chair with a Danish book of
poetry.</p>

<p>As I entered the room I was assailed by a smell, so creeping, so
foetid I could hardly forbear an exclamation&mdash;yet this was so
obviously bad manners that I was silent.</p>

<p>I thought of course of drains or even dead birds in the chimney
and that the discomfortable thing would be marked and removed. But
neither of them noticed it and it died away presently.</p>

<p>Still, though it hung round us the whole evening now faint, now
stronger...always indescribably awful.</p>

<p>It was not in my own room, yet I woke up in the night drenched
with it, sick and shuddering with the horror of it...potent as a
live thing it filled the lovely chamber. Lord! what a smell...I was
retching as I staggered out to shut the window.</p>

<p>But it was in the house for the closed window made no
difference...I passed a night of torment...by the morning it was
gone.</p>

<p>I won't bore you with my next day's work, which was to trace
that smell.</p>

<p>Quite fruitless.</p>

<p>The garden, the drains, the kitchens, all furtively examined
were in perfect order.</p>

<p>How could one suspect anything else in such a house?</p>

<p>Yet with evening...that loathsome terror again.</p>

<p>It so saturated the rooms that everything seemed tainted with
it, like a fog dirties and dims, so this smell blighted and smeared
every lovely thing in the place.</p>

<p>And there were lovely things, I'd envied some of them
really.</p>

<p>But it was all spoilt for me now&mdash;even when the ghastly
odour wasn't there everything reminded me of it...I was in a state
of perpetual nausea.</p>

<p>Naturally I resolved to clear out.</p>

<p>But it couldn't be done at less than a couple of days' notice,
for I had come for a fortnight.</p>

<p>I mentioned the smell, actually dared to Jennifer (I shall
always think of her as that, never as 'Mrs Halston', I know) and
she was so distantly sweet about it that I felt I had been very
impertinent.</p>

<p>'Of course there is nothing,' she said kindly. 'Cedric is so
particular about&mdash;perfumes&mdash;sensitive people are, are
they not? Perhaps you have fancies? Cedric used to...that is where
I was able to...help him.'</p>

<p>Again the little thrill on the last two words: 'help him!' poor
brute. Yes she has helped him all right...but where to.</p>

<p>I could do nothing but agree.</p>

<p>Jennifer gazed at me and I could see she meant to be very
soothing.</p>

<p>'I banished everything ugly out of Cedric's life...Someday you
will meet a woman who will do that for you&mdash;'then, with that
natural brightness she used to mask her sacred emotions, 'Will you
come and look at the rose bushes? I <i>think</i> I have got some
teeny weeny buds for you to see&mdash;'</p>

<p>Yes, she had and must needs pick me one and give it me
gravely...as a symbol of something or other, I'm sure. But it was
no good; her 'teeny weeny' buds <i>stank</i>, my God, Lorimer, that
is the only word for it stank to Heaven.</p>

<p>That day it was awful, the smell I mean. I took two long walks
to get rid of it, the countryside was sweet and clean enough...the
abomination was in the house, clinging to everything.</p>

<p>After dinner I asked them if they meant to live this life
always, asked it bluntly, I suppose.</p>

<p>'Dear friend,' said Jennifer, 'you don't quite understand, does
he, Cedric? This is...just home...ours...</p>

<p>'Home?' I was worse than blunt, but the smell was torturing me.
'What have you got in it?'</p>

<p>They both looked at me.</p>

<p>'Each other, haven't we, Cedric?' her smile was
transcendent.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' I echoed, 'you've got each other&mdash;one can see
that&mdash;feel it&mdash;sm&mdash;'</p>

<p>I stopped; what was I going to say?&mdash;what was slipping
out?</p>

<p>I bit my tongue; but now I knew and it rather frightened me.</p>

<p>I cleared...I remember she said: 'And the Epic', but I just
cleared out into the garden like a lunatic and walked as I was into
Hertford to the hotel where they knew me.</p>

<p>Do you see it, Lorimer? It was all dead, love, ambition,
kindness, the souls themselves, shut in, stagnant, he sold for
money, his comforts, she sold for her satisfied lusts, each
exacting the price...each <i>hating</i> the other&mdash;no
children, nothing let in, nothing going on&mdash;putrid,
rotten...each caged and caught by the other&mdash;and, Lorimer,
<i>stinking themselves to Hell</i>.</p>

<p class="first">THE wedding feast was nearly over.</p>

<p>The bride sat apart in her own chamber, even her maids
dismissed, and listened to the last harps and violins whose sad
music echoed through the old palazzo and quivered across the
lagoon.</p>

<p>She sat in the dusk which obscured her splendour; her brocaded
gown was unlaced and showed her shoulders and bosom rising from
loose lace and lawn; her shoes were off and her stockings were of
silk so fine as to show every line in her feet&mdash;which were
crossed on a footstool of rose-coloured damask.</p>

<p>Most of the powder had been shaken from her hair which fell over
her shoulders in fine curls of gold; she wore a chaplet, and
necklace and earrings of pearls; the dimly seen furniture showed
richly in the shadows, bouquets of roses, lilies, and carnations
were on the dressing-table, on the chairs and on the floor.</p>

<p>On the bride's lap were trails of syringa, verbena, and orange
and lemon, from her hair fell the blooms of the bridal coronal and
mingled with these.</p>

<p>Once or twice she stretched herself and yawned, her body moving
softly in the silken clothes.</p>

<p>Could anyone have flashed a candle or a lamp through the gloom
and revealed that head and face adorned with flowers and jewels, he
would have seen a wicked countenance look up at him from the
shadows, a countenance as firm in outline and as soft in colour as
tinted alabaster, a low, smooth brow, beautiful, hard eyes,
scornful nostrils to a straight, small nose, a beautiful curved,
greedy mouth, a smooth white chin.</p>

<p>So she sat, Giudetta Grimaldi, while her bridegroom entertained
the last guests, sat and mused in the darkness.</p>

<p>And waited for her lover.</p>

<p>Waited patiently with languid self-composure, and did not
trouble to listen for the chiming of the little silver clock out of
the darkness.</p>

<p>Men had never kept Giudetta waiting; she was so sure of all of
them; this security made her disdainful; she had never cared for
any of her lovers save for this man for whom she waited on her
wedding night.</p>

<p>When she heard the splash of oars beneath her window she did not
move, when she heard his feet on the stone façade, climbing up to
her, she did not turn her head.</p>

<p>Only when his figure appeared on the balcony did she move, and
gathering all her blossoms to her bosom, come, breathing sweetness,
to the open window.</p>

<p>Darkness concealed him; the infant moon was but enough to cast a
sparkle on the dark waters of the canal and show the dark outlines
of the crowded, silent palaces against the pale darkness of the
sky.</p>

<p>'So Giudetta is married,' he said.</p>

<p>She leant on his heart; her flowers, falling through careless
fingers, fell on the balcony and through the iron railings on to
the waters below.</p>

<p>'They would marry me,' she said, 'as well he as another. How
silent the city is tonight.'</p>

<p>'The plague is spreading.'</p>

<p>'It is not near us?'</p>

<p>'Nay, the other end of Venice, but the mere name frightens
people.'</p>

<p>He did not offer to caress her; his cold love-making had always
served to increase her passion, she took him by the shoulder and
drawing his head down, almost roughly kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>'Listen,' her words came quickly, yet softly, like an
accompaniment to the harp and violins, 'we have never had more than
a few moments together, you and I&mdash;I have played with you long
enough, I love you, Astorre, I love you&mdash;I can be free
tonight&mdash;take me, take me away&mdash;'</p>

<p>Her surrender was almost fierce; the man who held her
shuddered.</p>

<p>'I meant to ask you for tonight&mdash;your wedding night,' he
said, whispering through her hair that curtained his ear, 'tonight
I will show you how I love you, Giudetta, Giudetta&mdash;'</p>

<p>She smiled; she hated her husband and his family, it pleased her
to insult them; voluptuously, playing with her own pleasure, she
passed her little hand slowly over the face of her lover and let it
rest on his lips to receive his kiss.</p>

<p>'You will come with me in my gondola tonight?' he whispered.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'But he?'</p>

<p>'Leave that to me&mdash;how shall I get down to you?'</p>

<p>'I have a rope ladder&mdash;you will be safe with me.'</p>

<p>'And before dawn you will bring me back?'</p>

<p>'You shall come back,' he said, 'when you wish.'</p>

<p>The music ceased.</p>

<p>Giudetta drew softly away and tiptoed back into the room.</p>

<p>Feeling her way to the dressing-table she found a box that she
knew by the silk surface and the raised design of seed pearls.</p>

<p>Opening this she drew out a little package.</p>

<p>Swiftly and with a delicate touch she found a goblet of wine,
which she had placed carefully on the little table by the
window.</p>

<p>Into this she dropped the contents of the package, a white
powder that fell heavily and quickly dissolved.</p>

<p>With this still in her hand she unlocked the door, listened, and
hearing footsteps retreated behind the heavy folds of the silk bed
curtain.</p>

<p>Her husband entered.</p>

<p>'Dark&mdash;dark?' he said.</p>

<p>'I am abed,' answered Giudetta from the curtains, 'I was
weary.'</p>

<p>The Marchese paused; he was not sure of his bride nor of his own
fortune in having married a great beauty; the feast had left him
depressed, a heavy weight hung about his heart.</p>

<p>'Where are your candles, Giudetta?' he asked.</p>

<p>She put her head down so that the sound of her voice came from
the pillow.</p>

<p>'Leave the candles, my eyes are tired.'</p>

<p>Carefully in the darkness she was holding upright the goblet,
holding it steadily so that the liquid should not spill.</p>

<p>She heard him coming towards her; he moved the curtains and she
saw his dark shape between her and the dimness of the window.</p>

<p>She laughed, and the laughter enticed him; he bent down, peering
for her through the dark.</p>

<p>Noiselessly she sat erect on the bed, gently and accurately she
held the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>'Drink this to our wedding&mdash;it is fine Greek wine; I have
been waiting for you to drink with me.'</p>

<p>He took the glass from her, she heard the rim clink against his
teeth.</p>

<p>'Giudetta&mdash;'</p>

<p>His hand felt for her blindly; she evaded him, slipping easily
into the room.</p>

<p>The Marchese sat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>'Giudetta&mdash;'</p>

<p>His voice was low and held a dull note of accusation; she
watched the dark bulk of his figure slip sideways.</p>

<p>She turned and supported him so that he should make no noise in
falling.</p>

<p>Gently she let him slide to the ground.</p>

<p>He lay there motionless.</p>

<p>She could see the white patches made by his wrist ruffles and
the lace at his bosom.</p>

<p>Cautiously she waited, standing over the drugged man, then she
went again to her dressing-table and the blue silk box, and took
out strings of jewels which she fastened round her neck and waist
and wrists.</p>

<p>Then she found her slippers by the chair where she had been
sitting, and feeling along the couch found a cloak which she cast
over her shoulders.</p>

<p>Laughing under her breath, she came out on to the balcony.</p>

<p>The night was serene and melancholy.</p>

<p>Black were the palaces rising against the sky, black the shadows
they cast into the waters of the canals, remote were the stars, and
as remote seemed the little yellow lights that flamed up here and
there in distant windows.</p>

<p>Giudetta clung to her lover.</p>

<p>He turned from where he had been leaning over the iron
railing.</p>

<p>'Ah, you are ready?'</p>

<p>'He sleeps&mdash;the poppy-seed is swift.'</p>

<p>'Sleeps he already? You have used more than poppy-seed.'</p>

<p>'That other drug they gave me, too&mdash;he fell like a dead
man.'</p>

<p>'Would you have cared if he had been dead, my Giudetta?'</p>

<p>She laughed again.</p>

<p>'Why should I care?'</p>

<p>'You care for me?'</p>

<p>'I have told you.'</p>

<p>'Will you come now?'</p>

<p>'Take me away.'</p>

<p>She shivered when he showed her the rope ladder hanging over the
balcony, but she climbed over the iron work without assistance.</p>

<p>With her shoes under one arm and her skirts gathered under the
other, the beautiful Giudetta descended into the darkness.</p>

<p>The rope ladder was held taut, the gondolier received her in his
arms and she sank into the cushions of the light, swaying boat.</p>

<p>Breathing heavily, she sat silent, watching the dark ripples the
feeble lamp at the prow showed beating on the rocking gondola.</p>

<p>The palazzo towered so far above her it seemed as if she was at
the bottom of a well; all these great buildings overwhelmed the
frail boat with their heavy shadows.</p>

<p>When he joined her she gave a little sigh of gladness; the boat
shot away out on to the canal.</p>

<p>Giudetta looked up at the open window of her bridal chamber, and
a sense of danger touched her hard heart.</p>

<p>But she had managed intrigues as perilous as this
before&mdash;only the fact that this time she was in love unnerved
her courage.</p>

<p>She leant forward.</p>

<p>'Where are we going?'</p>

<p>'Home.'</p>

<p>He said the word quickly and quietly out of the darkness.</p>

<p>'Your home?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>She moved luxuriously on the cushions and looked up at the stars
which were so low and brilliant it seemed as if every minute they
would fall in a shower on the dark city.</p>

<p>The gondola sped out into the Grand Canal; there were few lights
in the windows and those few were dim, not the bright flame of
festivals.</p>

<p>Only here and there lanterns hung on the mooring poles outside
the palaces.</p>

<p>The state barges rocked at anchor by the broad stone steps; in
this city of music there was no music tonight.</p>

<p>'How melancholy,' said Giudetta.</p>

<p>It was a melancholy that pleased her, as it rendered the more
exquisite the contrast of her own happiness in being with the man
whom she loved, her pleasure in being engaged on this delicious
adventure on her wedding night.</p>

<p>They turned from the sea and the islands and towards the
Rialto.</p>

<p>'How silent,' said Giudetta.</p>

<p>She liked this silence which seemed to make the world hers to
fill with her own thoughts of love, not a breath intruded on her
reveries; her passion could dominate the night undisturbed; she
wished that they might move indefinitely between these dark palaces
over the dark water and under the vivid stars.</p>

<p>They passed a shrine near the bridge; the Madonna holding the
Child in an alcove in the wall of a palace.</p>

<p>A feeble lamp showed her dull blue and pink gown and the placid
face of the Child.</p>

<p>Giudetta felt sorry for the Madonna who sat holding her Babe all
day and all night, and never came down to row over the lagoons.</p>

<p>'How still it is,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'The plague,' said Astorre.</p>

<p>They were passing under the Rialto, in complete darkness.</p>

<p>Giudetta wished that he had not used that word&mdash;'the
plague'.</p>

<p>'This morning I saw many houses marked with the red cross,'
continued Astorre, 'and many pale faces looking from upper windows
for assistance.'</p>

<p>'And no one went?'</p>

<p>'The priests or the nuns. But there are not enough. The people
die so fast, the black gondolas are laden to the water edge, and
there are no more coffins in the city.'</p>

<p>'Why do you tell me this?' asked Giudetta. 'We should not be
abroad.'</p>

<p>'Where I take you is safe from infection. You are not
aftaid?'</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>'Have I proved myself a coward?'</p>

<p>She took his right hand in both of hers and drew it down to her
bosom.</p>

<p>He looked at her; she could see the pale oval of his face,
nothing more; the darkness began to tease her, it was like a veil
between them.</p>

<p>'Take me into the light,' she whispered, 'and you will see how I
am adorned for you.'</p>

<p>'For me!' he repeated the words in a strange tone. 'Do you
remember when you loved Rosario?' he added abruptly.</p>

<p>'Rosario,' she murmured the name lazily, playing with the memory
it evoked.</p>

<p>'My brother.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I remember&mdash;did you think I had forgotten? But you are
mistaken, I never cared for him.'</p>

<p>'He loved you.'</p>

<p>'I know.'</p>

<p>She laughed, not vexed at this conversation; it pleased her to
remember the men who had loved her, and it pleased her to think
Astorre was jealous.</p>

<p>'He loved you,' repeated the man thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'He broke his heart for you.'</p>

<p>'Did he?'</p>

<p>'You know it.'</p>

<p>'There have been so many,' smiled Giudetta. 'And this
was&mdash;last year. I sent him away after I met you.'</p>

<p>'You played with him for three months.'</p>

<p>'He was a pretty gentleman and adored me in good faith.'</p>

<p>'He forsook Rosina for you.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'You know that, also.'</p>

<p>'I had forgotten.'</p>

<p>'She loved him.'</p>

<p>'But he loved only me. Poor Rosina!' Giudetta laughed again.</p>

<p>'And he forsook her for you. They were betrothed.'</p>

<p>'Were they?'</p>

<p>'The marriage day fixed.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'I suppose it amused you to part them and then fling him
aside?'</p>

<p>She released his hand and caressed it softly as she
answered.</p>

<p>'I suppose so. But that is in the past, nothing amuses me now
but to be with you. Is it not as if we had wings and flew between
water and sky?'</p>

<p>'To what goal do we travel, you and I, O Giudetta?'</p>

<p>'To what goal! The future is dark, like the night!'</p>

<p>'Dark indeed.'</p>

<p>'I cannot dream what my life will be. I have never loved
before.'</p>

<p>'Love is powerful.'</p>

<p>'Too powerful,' she shuddered; 'it disturbs me. I wish I did not
love.'</p>

<p>'Why, Giudetta, why?'</p>

<p>'Because I know not where it will lead me&mdash;I feel as if it
would ruin my life and even cause my death.'</p>

<p>'Love is like that. I also am in the talons of love which drives
me to anything&mdash;even perhaps to crime.'</p>

<p>She shivered with joy to hear him say this.</p>

<p>'You think of my husband?'</p>

<p>Astorre was silent.</p>

<p>They had turned off the Grand Canal and entered one smaller and
almost totally dark, where the water lapped at weed-hung steps and
the rust of gratings of lower windows.</p>

<p>'Suppose you killed him,' murmured Giudetta; 'such things have
been done for a woman.'</p>

<p>'Yes, murder has been done for a woman.'</p>

<p>She pressed close to him.</p>

<p>'You&mdash;could you do that?'</p>

<p>He answered strongly.</p>

<p>'Yes, Giudetta.'</p>

<p>The warm arms from which cloak and sleeves had fallen, encircled
him.</p>

<p>She laid her cheek on his shoulder.</p>

<p>'You would kill for love?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Without pity or hesitation?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Ah, you know how to love! You are like what a lover should
be.'</p>

<p>'I know how to love, Giudetta&mdash;I have given my life for
love.'</p>

<p>'We shall be happy, my dearest, we shall be happy!'</p>

<p>They passed a church now; either side was a wall covered with
roses; the yellow light from the wide open door showed these
flowers and the circular wet steps and the bowed forms of the
worshippers; for a second, too, it showed the small flushed face of
Giudetta and the jewels on her bosom.</p>

<p>The darkness engulfed them again.</p>

<p>'Do you ever pray, Giudetta?'</p>

<p>'I prayed once.'</p>

<p>'For what boon?'</p>

<p>'After I had first seen you, beloved, I prayed you might love
me.'</p>

<p>He answered fiercely.</p>

<p>'I prayed for that too, on my knees, fasting I prayed you might
love me!'</p>

<p>'Some kind saint listened&mdash;I have burnt many candles at
many shrines.' Her arms slipped from his neck, she sat upright,
adjusting her thrown-back hair which lay in coils inside her
hood.</p>

<p>The gondola stopped.</p>

<p>For a moment it shook to and fro as the man fastened it to the
post, then rocked steadily at the moorings.</p>

<p>'We are there?' asked Giudetta.</p>

<p>She felt that all this had happened before in a dream; the
narrow doorway with the steep steps rising out of the water, the
two grated windows and the high-placed iron lamp that shed a dismal
light over the masonry were all familiar to her.</p>

<p>'This is not your house?' she whispered.</p>

<p>'No, the house of one of my friends&mdash;empty for the moment.
But I have all ready for this night's feast.'</p>

<p>'It looks gloomy,' said Giudetta. She stood up, drawing her
cloak about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Astorre laid a plank from the gondola to the steps and handed
her ashore.</p>

<p>She entered.</p>

<p>A long passage was before her, damp and narrow, the house seemed
mean and neglected.</p>

<p>Giudetta turned to her lover who was quickly beside her.</p>

<p>'You said you were bringing me to your home&mdash;here I would
not have come.'</p>

<p>'This is my true home&mdash;not in the great palace, I have
prepared it for you&mdash;'</p>

<p>She was unconvinced, and hesitated.</p>

<p>'You cannot turn back now,' he said, gently taking her arm,
'here it is safe&mdash;no one will come to seek you here.'</p>

<p>'That is true,' she admitted.</p>

<p>'And you are with me.'</p>

<p>'Lead me,' she said, 'and light! light! We have been in the dark
so long!'</p>

<p>He took her hand and led her down the passage which was high and
dark and damp and narrow&mdash;the entrance of a poor and neglected
house, Giudetta thought.</p>

<p>Resentment touched her heart like a little flame; her adventure
was spoilt by these sordid surroundings, her love was no longer
what it had been on the balcony of her own beautiful chamber or in
the gondola under the stars.</p>

<p>'Where are you leading me?' she asked, and her hand stiffened in
his grasp.</p>

<p>The passage seemed endless.</p>

<p>Now they reached some steps, he guided her up, opened a door and
ushered her into a lit room. It was a fair-sized apartment with
painted walls and ceiling; the two windows were open; a chandelier
of coloured glass gave the soft yellow light.</p>

<p>Beneath stood a table elegantly laid with two covers and two
purple velvet chairs; for the rest the furniture was of a bedroom;
a bed draped with purple and rose-coloured hangings stood on a
dais, there were coffers, mirrors and a dressing-table.</p>

<p>Giudetta did not like the room.</p>

<p>It was not the setting she had imagined or wished for her
love.</p>

<p>The chamber seemed to her unpleasant, even fearful, yet there
was nothing strange about the place, it was like so many other
Venetian rooms, rich, sombre, a little heavy in furnishing.</p>

<p>Astorre handed her into one of the velvet chairs and turned to
leave her.</p>

<p>'Prince,' she said imperiously, 'I do not like this house.'</p>

<p>He stood, with his hand on the open door, looking at her
intently.</p>

<p>Now at last he was revealed to her, after the long concealment
of the dark; she forgot her vexation as she looked at him.</p>

<p>His was the extreme handsomeness of face and body that is the
passport to all worldly pleasures, handsomeness of dark warm
colouring, of beautiful eyes, masculine and passionate, of a
haughty mouth, curved and sensitive, handsomeness of movement and
gestures, bearing and pose.</p>

<p>His curled black hair was only slightly powdered and he wore no
hat; a double caped cloak hung open to show his suit of dark
crimson; he wore diamonds in his cravat that twinkled under the
clasp of his mantle.</p>

<p>Giudetta, looking at him, smiled.</p>

<p>She loved him, she was proud of him&mdash;they were
together.</p>

<p>What did the background matter?</p>

<p>She put her fair head back against the velvet back of the
chair.</p>

<p>'Why do you leave me, Astorre?' she asked in a gentler tone.</p>

<p>He had been fixing her with an intense scrutiny, drinking in her
jewelled beauty as she was his, she believed.</p>

<p>At her words he drew himself together with a little start, as if
awakened out of some dream or reverie.</p>

<p>'I go to fetch your supper, Giudetta,' he answered. 'Tonight I
wait on you.'</p>

<p>Without waiting for her consent, he left her quickly.</p>

<p>Giudetta sat still awhile playing with the pearls on her bosom
and the sweet thoughts in her mind.</p>

<p>Then she rose and went to the window as people always will in a
strange room.</p>

<p>She was at the back of the house and the stagnant waters of a
little-used canal sucked at the bricks two feet below the windows,
opposite the blank walls of crowded houses blocked out the
night.</p>

<p>It was silent and desolate&mdash;Giudetta did not find this
silence soft and pleasing as had been that on the canals, but
rather dreary and sinister.</p>

<p>She moved back into the room, went to one of the mirrors and
surveyed her own gorgeous fairness, pearl and diamond bedecked, to
give her courage.</p>

<p>She was beautiful, no doubts could obscure that fact&mdash;she
was beautiful, and what had beauty to fear?&mdash;in her
experience, nothing.</p>

<p>Now she moved to the door and opened it&mdash;without the utter
darkness of the corridor.</p>

<p>Quickly she closed it; horror, like a palpable presence, rose
and confronted her.</p>

<p>'What is the matter with this room?' she asked herself.</p>

<p>Fear suddenly rose from all sides, engulfing her like waves.</p>

<p>She seemed to stand in isolation assailed by a thousand phantoms
of horror, terror, and wrath; deeper fear and dismay than she had
imagined possible to experience were now poured into her heart as
water into a cup.</p>

<p>She had a glimpse into regions of infernal melancholy and
unclean blackness, which was as if she peered suddenly into a chasm
darker and deeper than eternity.</p>

<p>She seemed to be sinking down the steep walls of hell into an
abyss where she would be for ever lost, lost to all she had ever
loved or enjoyed.</p>

<p>Buried through long aeons with the sins of a hundred million
years lying heavy on her heart...Then the great horror passed; she
fell on her knees beside the chair from which she had risen sick
and shivering.</p>

<p>Clasping her hands tightly she called on her love.</p>

<p>'Astorre, why do you leave me?'</p>

<p>Now she had no desire for love, no appetite for pleasure, but
she called on the only human being whom she thought to be near.</p>

<p>What was the matter with the room&mdash;what had happened here,
why was she imprisoned here between the open windows with the
lapping black waters beneath and the open door with the black
passage without?</p>

<p>She turned round about like one confined, and though she was
free of action and surrounded by space, her movement was as if she
beat against bars.</p>

<p>Her straining ears heard a step and she moved to her feet,
stumbling in her long gown and shaking the pearls and diamonds on
her bosom.</p>

<p>Astorre entered.</p>

<p>She scarcely saw him with gladness; he seemed to have changed
since they had entered the house; even his beauty was no longer
pleasant, but had in it something horrible; as a handsome face will
look from a design of hideous forms and partake of their terror, so
he seemed to have been absorbed into the atmosphere of the house,
robbed of charm and invested with horror.</p>

<p>'Prince,' said Giudetta feebly, 'take me away from here.'</p>

<p>He pointed to the untouched table.</p>

<p>'We have not supped.'</p>

<p>'I could not eat.'</p>

<p>'What has happened, Giudetta?'</p>

<p>She made a great effort over her fears, but the earlier
joyousness of the evening was not to be recaptured.</p>

<p>'Nothing has happened&mdash;but I feel as if I was going to lose
all I cared for.'</p>

<p>He seated himself at the table, and taking his face in his hands
looked at her.</p>

<p>'All you ever cared for? What have you ever cared for?'</p>

<p>She could not answer&mdash;what, in truth, was there she was
afraid to lose?</p>

<p>To escape from this house she would have gladly forgone Astorre
and found herself at home beside the drugged husband, for at the
touch of personal fear, passion had died, and other days would
bring another love.</p>

<p>'Myself,' she said at last. 'I fear to lose myself, my life, my
existence&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That in truth,' answered Astorre, 'is all that you have to
lose.'</p>

<p>She noticed now the difference in his tone; not with this had he
spoken to her in the gondola.</p>

<p>Another and dreadful fear possessed her now.</p>

<p>'Astorre, why have you brought me here?'</p>

<p>'You ask me that now? Was it not for your sweet company?'</p>

<p>She supported herself by the chair and looked from him to the
two open windows.</p>

<p>'I do not like this place,' she said almost as if to
herself.</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Close the windows,' she continued, 'the air from the water is
damp.'</p>

<p>'The night is warm, Giudetta.'</p>

<p>'But I feel the house chill.'</p>

<p>She looked round for the cloak she had brought with her; it was
brocade, the colour of faded red roses, lined with lemon-coloured
satin, her marriage cloak...</p>

<p>She thought of her husband...she pictured him, very vividly,
lying beside the bed in the dark room, with the bridal flowers
scattered near.</p>

<p>Her fingers trembled as she fingered the mantle; what a perverse
fool she was&mdash;she might as well have loved the Marchese, he
was as personable a man as the one she had chosen&mdash;why had she
risked so much for Astorre?&mdash;if she was not back before the
palace was awake she was lost, lost before all Venice.</p>

<p>Why had she done this foolish thing, she asked herself
dully&mdash;she could not now understand the passion that had
prompted her to this adventure.</p>

<p>Thinking only of her own safety and her own terrors, she sank
huddled into the chair and stared at Astorre.</p>

<p>The door was pushed open gently and a woman entered bearing a
salver on which were various dishes.</p>

<p>She wore a plain cloth dress that might have been that of any
servant, but over her face was a thick mask with slits for the
mouth and eyes; made of grey silk and spotted with scarlet, it was
one of the fantastic vizards of carnival.</p>

<p>'What is your jest?' asked Giudetta.</p>

<p>The woman put the dishes on the table; meat, pastries, and fruit
on carved silver, and tall bottles of wine in cases of
filigree.</p>

<p>'What jest?' repeated Giudetta.</p>

<p>'There is no jest,' said Astorre.</p>

<p>Giudetta rose in wild terror.</p>

<p>'A plot, there is some plot&mdash;this food is poisoned, I can
swear it!'</p>

<p>'You shall not eat if you do not wish,' he showed no surprise at
her fears.</p>

<p>The masked woman remained standing inside the door, the salver
in her hands.</p>

<p>Giudetta lowered at both of them.</p>

<p>'Take me home,' she said between her teeth, 'or on my soul you
shall pay for it!'</p>

<p>'Certainly I shall pay for this night's work,' he replied; he
began unconcernedly to drink his wine and eat his supper.</p>

<p>Now she trembled with supplication.</p>

<p>'What harm have I ever done to you? You loved me, did you not?
But a little while ago.'</p>

<p>Astorre laughed.</p>

<p>'Prince,' she continued desperately, 'what is this you have
against me?'</p>

<p>'What should I have against you?'</p>

<p>Another thought came to her.</p>

<p>'You are mad, mad,' she pointed to the silent third, 'that woman
is mad also!'</p>

<p>'Not mad, Giudetta.'</p>

<p>'Then take me home.</p>

<p>All her energy was now concentrated on that, to get away, to
escape, to be free of them both, to be back in her own place.</p>

<p>Astorre rose, his glass in his hand.</p>

<p>'To your good health, Giudetta.'</p>

<p>He drank to her gravely, mockingly, she thought, his fine hand
flushed red from the reflection of the wine cast by the candles
above his head, which filtered their light through sparkling
glass.</p>

<p>She waited, helpless.</p>

<p>'Why are you frightened? asked Astorre. 'I swear I shall never
touch you.'</p>

<p>'Why should you, what have you against me?' through all her
terrors she fumbled with the wonder of it all...a little while ago
they had been lovers.</p>

<p>The woman now came forward to remove the plates.</p>

<p>'Take off your mask,' said Astorre.</p>

<p>She did so and looked at Giudetta with a pale, mournful
face.</p>

<p>'You know her?' asked Astorre.</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'It is Rosina.'</p>

<p>'Rosina! Changed, oh, Heaven, changed!' cried Giudetta.</p>

<p>'You remember her?' smiled Astorre. 'She was betrothed to
Rosario&mdash;he left her for you&mdash;he amused you&mdash;and
she&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You never thought of me, did you?' asked Rosina, 'nor of all
the other women whose hearts you rifled?'</p>

<p>'Is this a vendetta?' asked Giudetta swiftly.</p>

<p>'I swear that we shall not touch you,' repeated Astorre.</p>

<p>This did not reassure her nor lift the black cloud of terror
that hung over her soul; the sight of the woman whom she had so
wantonly and maliciously and contemptuously wronged, filled her
with unavailing rage and deeper dread.</p>

<p>She turned to Astorre, something of her beauty, blanched and
withered through fear, returned in the flush of her anger.</p>

<p>'Why do you champion her,' she demanded, 'was your brother so
much to you?'</p>

<p>'He was much and she was more. I always loved Rosina, as she
loved Rosario.'</p>

<p>Giudetta flung her head back and looked at him out of half
closed eyes from which gleamed hatred.</p>

<p>'How I loathe you,' she said.</p>

<p>His beauty was now to her like the gorgeous skin of the serpent,
a thing to be detested and destroyed.</p>

<p>She would gladly have killed him and stepped over his dead body
to freedom.</p>

<p>Her helplessness made her sick with fury.</p>

<p>'Come away,' said Rosina.</p>

<p>She slipped her hand inside Astorre's.</p>

<p>'Good-night, Giudetta,' said Astorre.</p>

<p>Relief soothed her when they were gone; she thought they meant
to ruin her by leaving her there so that she could not return in
time.</p>

<p>But she believed her wits were equal to this dilemma.</p>

<p>They locked the door after them as she had expected.</p>

<p>But there were the windows.</p>

<p>Mounting on a chair she detached one of the candles from the
chandelier, and hurrying to the first window, thrust the light out
and stared about her.</p>

<p>She had enough jewels to bribe half Venice&mdash;there must be
someone who would come to her rescue.</p>

<p>The flame burned straight in the still air, it showed the waters
below&mdash;the walls of the house; nothing else.</p>

<p>No boat, no passing gondola, no light in an opposite window
encouraged her to hope.</p>

<p>The place was deserted.</p>

<p>Still she moved the candle to and fro and peered to right and
left.</p>

<p>Suddenly she ceased this movement of her arm, she continued to
stare and her face became as lifeless as the stone window that
framed her terror.</p>

<p>She had seen between the two windows, coarsely marked on the
rough wall, the scarlet cross, the warning and the sign of a
plague-stricken house.</p>

<p>The candle dropped through her fingers, the little flame hissed
to extinction in the sucking black waters.</p>

<p>Slowly she moved back into the room; physical nausea seized her;
her jewels galled her like ropes of lead.</p>

<p>She tottered to the bed to stretch her fainting limbs there.</p>

<p>When her shaking hands had contrived to draw the curtains,
shriek after shriek left her lips and echoed through the doomed
house.</p>

<p>There lay Rosario, stiff and awful on the neat pillows; his
livid, mottled face showing the manner of his death.</p>

<p>The plague.</p>

<h2><a name="story4" id="story4"></a>A STRANGER KNOCKED</h2>

<h3>Published in <i>The Fireside Book of Yuletide Stories</i>,
Bobbs-Merril Co., Indianapolis, 1948</h3>

<p>No one knew who had admitted the old man. He was suddenly there,
in the chimney corner, warming his hands before the glow of the
Yule log. The guests were a little weary with singing and laughing.
They had fallen on a silence disturbed only by the chatter of the
children who sat on the floor playing with tinsel ornaments.</p>

<p>The Yule wreath hung overhead, stuck with apples, holly and
candles. Everyone dreamed differently as they looked at it; some
were too drowsy to dream at all.</p>

<p>One asked his neighbour: 'Who is the old man?'</p>

<p>Another was curious enough to ask this question of the master of
the house. He sent for the porter, who knew nothing. But then, the
gates had stood wide all day; who could be refused admission during
the Christmas Festival? The master of the house agreed, adding,
'Perhaps he has come with one of the children, there are so many,
one invites another&mdash;'</p>

<p>It was a large house, justly famous for its hospitality. For
weeks the cooks had been baking biscuits, cakes and sweetmeats. The
air was rich with the scent of spices, from open fires, symbolic of
the offerings of the Magi.</p>

<p>The musicians had just left the upper gallery. There were no
lights save the candles on the Yule wreath, whose flames tapered
upwards into the darkness of the large room. The brocade curtains
had not been drawn across the long oriel windows. Without could be
seen the unceasing snow flakes.</p>

<p>The old man was handsome, upright and stately. Yet he continued
to warm his hands as if he had come a long way, on a far cold
journey.</p>

<p>The Master of the house approached him, offering him a cup of
wine, as if, now he had perceived him, he welcomed him.</p>

<p>The old man declined, with a courteous inclination of his
massive head.</p>

<p>Everyone was now looking at him, even the children who played on
the floor.</p>

<p>'I like to spend Christmas in company,' he said in a voice
touched with a strange, perhaps a foreign, accent. He glanced round
the circle of faces. 'Do you think of Christmas as merely a
festival?' he asked.</p>

<p>No one answered the direct question.</p>

<p>'The twelve days of Christmas,' murmured a young girl, 'it is a
merry holiday.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' exclaimed the old man looking at her sharply. 'Those
pretty flowers you wear; it was I who brought them to England.'</p>

<p>The girl put her hands to the wreath as if she feared it would
dissolve, like fairy blooms, and the company, smiling, conceded the
old man's whim, to describe himself as a magician.</p>

<p>But he continued quietly: 'I am a botanist. Years ago, before
you were born, my dear young lady, I brought some roots of that
little blossom from Asia, and now it grows at Christmas in your
stone houses.'</p>

<p>'You have earned your place at the fireside for that alone,'
said the master of the house, smiling.</p>

<p>'No,' replied the old man. 'I have my place out of charity.'</p>

<p>They all protested, languidly. He was harmless, perhaps
distinguished. The master of the house thought: 'Perhaps it was a
stupid indiscretion not to have invited him.'</p>

<p>'I must explain myself. I am a professor of natural history. I
have outlived all my friends, and I never married. Until last
Christmas I found, however, company. This year I was obliged to
come among strangers.'</p>

<p>'You are truly welcome,' cried the master of the house, glancing
at his wife. And she half rose from her sofa and repeated, 'You are
truly welcome, but excuse me, sir, I do not remember seeing you in
these parts.'</p>

<p>'I live the other side of the forest,' said the professor, 'and
I seldom go abroad. I amuse myself with writing, or with going over
my collections. I have travelled, of course, over the whole
world.'</p>

<p>'Some old fellow,' whispered a youth, 'in his second childhood,
and already forgotten by everyone.'</p>

<p>Yet the company seemed to circle round him, as if he were the
person everyone had come to see. The snowflakes fell softly on the
diamond panes of the window; the night showed purple beyond the
warm lit room.</p>

<p>The small children fell asleep on their mother's laps, and the
older children stared at the professor of natural history.</p>

<p>His clothes were very old-fashioned, but neat and fresh. The
Yule log was sinking into fiery particles; it had burnt for three
days. The room was so hot that the master of the house did not
order any more wood to be piled on the hearth. The steady glow
filled the room, making warm shadows behind the group of people,
glinting in glasses and decanters, shining in brown and gold locks
and on the folds of silk and satin gowns.</p>

<p>They all wished that the old naturalist would go; he made them
and their merrymaking seem foolish.</p>

<p>'Yesterday,' he said, 'I was out alone, walking beyond the
forest; all seemed dark, dead, sombre, with the snow coming on, and
one solitary jay screaming, when I found some goldilocks moss, just
at my feet. And it reminded me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ay, tell us a tale!' cried a boy looking up from a castle he
was building of toy bricks.</p>

<p>'&mdash;how I nearly became a murderer on Christmas Day,' added
the old man.</p>

<p>Everyone was now silent. The mimic tower fell over. Time seemed
to glide away swiftly as if all Christmas sports were now over. The
mistress of the house rose quietly and drew the curtains over the
storm. The wind had risen and a certain shudder was felt even in
this serene room. The garlands of mistletoe, ivy and holly shivered
in their places.</p>

<p>'The weather was like this,' said the old man. 'A blustering
storm rising, everything frozen, and, as I recall, a giant yew cast
down in the churchyard. You know a fruit tree can be overthrown and
then propped up, but a yew tree&mdash;never. It dies at once.'</p>

<p>'Where was the place and when was the time?' asked the master of
the house.'</p>

<p>'Far, far from here,' was the reply, 'on the wild coast of
Wales. And in time, I do not know how long; I have ceased to count
the years.'</p>

<p>He settled himself to his tale, that he gave as a gift or
offering, and as such they took it, while the gale increased and
scattered the sparks on the hearth and struggled at the firmly
bolted door.</p>

<p>The house was believed to be haunted, though no one spoke of
that. But there were those in the group gathered round the fire who
thought of this now, of invisible beings who might be peering over
their shoulders or floating in the dark air above the circle of
candles.</p>

<p>'I was coming home,' said the professor of natural history,
'after several years of wandering. I had been in China and Tibet.
There were some curiosities I was resolved to have.'</p>

<p>'You must,' said the master of the house, 'have met with many
adventures.'</p>

<p>'By land and sea. One can become obsessed, of course, by such a
quest. I fell ill. I lost my basket of specimens. I was
robbed.'</p>

<p>'All for a few flowers!' murmured the girl with the wreath. 'And
we have enough at home&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Who is ever content with what he has at home? Besides, I was
not searching for new ornaments, but for medicinal
plants&mdash;some gallant and universal balm.' He changed his tone
abruptly, and added in a firm voice that seemed that of a much
younger man, 'But I always corresponded with Isabelle Blount.'</p>

<p>'A love story,' said the mistress of the house with a little
sigh. Her own had been a very happy one but she was conscious of
the passing of the years.</p>

<p>'We were betrothed.' The old man used the formal word with a
flourish. 'I had money and a fine house, and so had her brother; as
children we played together. It was early understood between us
that we were to be married as soon as my wanderings were
over&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, you were the tyrant and set the choice,' said one of the
ladies thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Not at all&mdash;she was willing to wait. Even wishful to
prolong her childhood. At first there were her parents to be
considered, then her brother. It was something we looked forward
to&mdash;our marriage&mdash;as a golden certainty.'</p>

<p>'You must have been a sober pair,' said the master of the
house.</p>

<p>'No,' said the old man distinctly, 'we were full of zest and
enthusiasm. I wished to fulfil my destiny as I was pleased to name
it. Isabelle learned every accomplishment. Ours was to be a
planned, a leisured happiness. She shared my interests. The stone
house built for her was filled by the treasures I had brought home.
Every month she wrote me accounts of our native flowers&mdash;even
from the first of the year, the dark red nettle, the grass
groundsell, the daisy&mdash;all manner of little conceits and
fancies we shared. She would write to me of the prickly furze,
glazed with the hoar frost, and I of a valley filled with azaleas
the colours of corals and shells.'</p>

<p>'And did you write of nothing else?' asked one of the
listeners.</p>

<p>'We wrote of everything else,' replied the old man with dignity.
'Whatever peril or discomfort I might be in, I kept calm by the
remembrance of Isabelle Blount. We intended to settle in our Welsh
home and to live&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Happily ever after,' put in the boy with the bricks that he had
now piled into the semblance of a palace.</p>

<p>'Why not?' asked the old man patiently. 'There was no flaw in
our scheme. I encountered much weariness. I have rested, exhausted,
by an abandoned gilt pagoda in the jungle to think of Isabelle
wandering among my native rocks to pick the sea mallow.'</p>

<p>'Very poetic, sir, but I think the lady was left too much
alone.'</p>

<p>The old man looked coolly at the speaker, a brisk youth helping
himself to wine.</p>

<p>'Isabelle was never alone. She had her family, her duties. I was
successful and not without honour. I received awards, gold and
silver medals. I lectured to distinguished audiences. She had
reason to be proud of me, as my reputation settled into a steady
brilliance.'</p>

<p>'Come, sir!' cried the young man finishing his wine. 'This was
to be a murderer's story.'</p>

<p>The old man ignored this. He took a pair of spectacles from his
forehead, polished them and set them on his nose.</p>

<p>'It was a settled frost when I said goodbye to her. We walked
along the stream; the sedges sparkled with ice; the night before
had been clear blue weather with a missel thrush singing. Now the
wind parted her hair as she laid her hand in mine; mosses, such as
I saw today, glowed on the twisted trunks of the oak trees. We
renewed our vows. One year more&mdash;and I should be free.'</p>

<p>'It was a pretty picture,' said the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>And in truth the old man had that much art, that he could make
them all, idle as they were, see the young lovers by the wintry
stream.</p>

<p>'She went with me over my home, suggesting changes here and
there, and said that if she were not mistress there by next
Christmas, she would be by the Christmas after. She chose the room
that should be hers, and I at once planned how I would see that it
was always filled by the choicest plants I brought from the East. A
kingfisher was startled from our path as we parted by the stream,
halfway between her house and mine. I took that blue-winged flash
to be an augury.</p>

<p>'I went to China and I found the plant for which I was
searching.'</p>

<p>'Tell us what it was,' asked several idle voices.</p>

<p>'It has remained nameless and useless,' the old man replied.
'Because&mdash;cannot you have guessed? The name it should have had
was <i>her</i> name, and the benefits it should have conferred on
mankind should have seemed to come from her&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do you want to tell this story?' asked the mistress of the
house gently. 'Shall we not rather sing a hymn or a carol before we
go in to dinner?'</p>

<p>'It is a tale that must be told,' insisted the old man. He
folded his hands in the bosom of his coat, as if they were
sufficiently warmed, or perhaps chilled beyond any hope of
warmth.</p>

<p>The company was lulled; a servant appeared in the doorway with
candles but was waved aside by the master of the house.</p>

<p>The glow of the Yule log was sufficient for the telling of this
tale.</p>

<p>'I was captured by some imperious mandarins who supposed I had
gazed too long at some rarities in their gardens. They enclosed me
in a tower. From my window I could see some misty peaks, broken by
dark hollows that made me long to set out on my explorations
again.</p>

<p>'I was well fed, and, I suppose, discovered to be harmless, for
after some months I was released. And not without some words of
wisdom as to limiting my curiosity. And not without some reward for
my patience under punishment. The mandarins had been through my
specimens and declared that I had loaded myself up with trim weeds
of no consequence. The package that they put into my hand as they
set me on my way contained the exquisite plant of almost magical
properties that I intended to name after my Isabelle.'</p>

<p>Each of the company sought to remember what this flower might
be, but their thoughts were sluggish.</p>

<p>The candles flickered out on the Yule wreath where the red
apples bobbed, and only the vast glow from the hearth lit the
room.</p>

<p>The master of the house begged the old man to take a more
comfortable chair, but he had settled in his chimney comer and
continued in his tale.</p>

<p>'My precious plants, like so many dried anatomies, were placed
in a sandalwood box, wrapped in mosses, and I set out for
England.</p>

<p>'There were several delays in my journey. I cannot even call
them to mind. Indeed, from the moment I left the hands of my
considerate captors, my adventures took on a dream-like quality. I
seemed to meet with some very queer companions and to put up at
some very odd places.'</p>

<p>'Do tell us!' cried one of the children, suddenly awaking.</p>

<p>The old man frowned.</p>

<p>'It was a long way and I lost count of time; there was winter,
but no snow fell. I lost my servant; he was bribed away, I think,
by a wealthy nabob, but of that I cannot be sure. Somehow there was
always money in my pocket. I found myself in London the day before
Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>'I had my treasured plants with me safely and as I looked on the
magnificent array of jewels, laces, flowers and other costly gifts
in the merchants' displays, I was proud because I had something
much rarer than those to offer my Isabelle.</p>

<p>'Owing to my rapid moving about I had not heard from her for
several weeks. The greater surprise and delight should therefore
mark our meeting. This time it would be never to part again.</p>

<p>'I stayed at a hotel in a street off the Strand where I was not
known, and reposed myself after my fatigues and troubles. Snow fell
in the evening, but the morning shone clearly over the Thames, and
the people hurried up and down with their parcels, wreaths of holly
and clusters of mistletoe.</p>

<p>'Imagination made my dried plants bloom. My musty chamber was
filled with the scent of a thousand silver stars. This peculiar
flower was said by the Chinese to be the flower of the dead that
ghosts came to smell at. For the living it has no perfume. Think of
me then, as alone in London, secure in this obscure hotel, with the
great treasure in my possession, the wonderful plant that should
bear the name of my beloved and bring me the final glory of my
already honoured career.'</p>

<p>As he spoke these words the old man held up his head with an
almost infernal pride and his frame, still powerful in outline,
trembled with fatigue and passion. He seemed to observe the
impression he made on his listeners and that they shrank a little
from him.</p>

<p>'What is a man,' he demanded, 'but a ruined archangel? I
certainly felt that I was possessed of supernatural powers, having
in that humble box I kept under lock and key, the powers of life
and death.' Lowering his voice he added in a confidential tone that
yet carried to every corner of the room, 'But when I came to
consult my calendar, I found I was out of my calculations. Most
abominably deceived! Where had I lost the time?'</p>

<p>'Can one lose time?' asked the master of the house
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'I had lost two years. In prison, in travel, in hallucinations.
I was that much out of my reckoning.'</p>

<p>'We never have as much time as we hope,' said the master of the
house.</p>

<p>'But who realises that?' asked his wife with a sad
tenderness.</p>

<p>'None of us,' put in the old man. 'We play with delusions all
the time.'</p>

<p>One of his listeners, secure in youth and happiness, protested
with a smile. He was sure of himself, and the girl beside him and
their future.</p>

<p>Ignoring this, the old man continued, with an increasing
eagerness:</p>

<p>'Very few people make the miscalculations I did&mdash;I had lost
two years&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Still, in so long a life&mdash;' murmured one of the youths
pertly.</p>

<p>The professor of natural history took up the challenge.</p>

<p>'I should not miss them you think? But they were those
particular years, you see, just those during which Isabelle was
waiting for me.'</p>

<p>'Her letters?' asked the master of the house. 'There must have
been some confusion there.'</p>

<p>They all felt a kindness for this Isabelle, as if they would
have liked to have asked her to join the circle, to draw up to the
fire, and tell her side of the tale of all the years when she was
waiting in a lonely home for a man greedy for wealth and
honour.</p>

<p>'Yes, her letters,' agreed the old man slowly. 'I told you there
was a gap when I did not receive any at all. Then she had a habit
of not putting dates&mdash;only Monday or Tuesday. Some must have
been very much delayed; some I never got at all.'</p>

<p>He put aside this subject with impatience.</p>

<p>'I was talking of my stay in London. No one thought of anything
but Christmas. The manager of the hotel put a ticket into my hand
and told me a ball was being held in the house at the end of the
street. I had a whim to go to this. Of course there were many
people in London who would have been glad to receive me. But I felt
shy. Perhaps I was changed. I did not know how to adjust myself to
those lost years. I sent a letter to Isabelle, saying I would be
with her on Christmas Day&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Did it not occur to you that she might be surprised, perhaps
dismayed by your long disappearances?' asked the master of the
house.</p>

<p>'Sir, it did not. I thought I had explained that we loved one
another.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' cried a lady who had been half asleep, 'if you think that
covers everything!'</p>

<p>'I thought so then.' He gave a stiff bow. 'I hope you think so
now.' With a brusque glance at his host he added, 'Perhaps you find
my tale tedious?'</p>

<p>But no, everyone wanted him to continue. The story was like a
spell to hold them together, an excuse rather for not moving, for
not having the candles in, for not calling for wraps and going
home. The horses were warm in the stables, the coachmen in the
servants' hall; it seemed a pity to break up the party.</p>

<p>So thought the visitors, while the host and his wife, who were
childless, had no wish to be left alone in the house that was
supposed to be haunted. If need be, everyone could be accommodated
for the night. So the old man was encouraged to tell them of the
ball he had attended, during the festival, so many years
before.</p>

<p>'You can,' he said, 'imagine my feeling, filled for so many
years with Isabelle, rare plants, and the various incidents of my
curious journeys. Who, I asked myself, were all these people? The
women had hot-house flowers, quite dead, pinned with diamonds to
their rich falls of laces; some of their little slippers were quite
worn out; as they rested, I saw the fine satin rubbed through at
the toes. The room had become overheated and someone had pulled
back the curtains to let in the icy light of dawn. The sheen from
the river was reflected in the mirrors, and in the drops from the
candelabra, where the last candles were guttering. The musicians
drooped in their places, but continued to scrape out waltzes, when
they began on carols as a reminder that the dance was at an end. I
made my escape. No one had noticed me. What humbug this festival
is! I reflected. Of course I was soon proved wrong, and that is why
I am telling you this story.</p>

<p>'I secretly confounded all such gaiety where I had not been made
welcome, and dwelt with pleasure on the self-contained lives that I
and Isabelle would lead with our exclusive interests.</p>

<p>'It was late on Christmas Eve when I arrived at my house. I had
not remembered that it was in such a lonely situation. It had taken
the contents of my wallet to induce a coachman to take me from the
railway station.</p>

<p>'There was no sign of welcome, but that was my own fault; I had
sent no letters in advance. Still I had always pictured the house
as ready and waiting for my return. Surely they could have, at
least, kept a light in the hall. The hackney soon departed, leaving
me and my simple baggage on the doorstep. I had to ring several
times before a person unknown to me, with a tallow dip in his hand,
cautiously responded to my bell ringing. He explained that he was
the caretaker, I, that I was the master of the house.</p>

<p>'Dubiously, he at length admitted me. What he had to say was
trivial, but exasperating. My heirs-at-law, distant cousins whom I
disliked, were claiming my property. My lawyers were playing a
delaying game and had searched for me all over the world.</p>

<p>'When it came to it, I had no recollection of having written to
them for years. There was that unpleasant lapse of time, you see.
My excellent steward, my good servants had all left. My lawyers
would not be at their expense. As I passed from one room to
another, partly dismantled, partly neglected, followed by my grim
unwilling guide, I became angry, mainly with myself. Why had I not
made a will, leaving everything to Isabelle? For the first time in
my life, I admitted that I was an eccentric fellow and managed my
affairs in a peculiar way.</p>

<p>'Still, that was all over now. The house and the estate would
soon be set to rights, and I should become a very decent member of
the county.</p>

<p>My familiarity with the house had convinced the caretaker that I
knew the place; the sight of my name on some foreign passports and
letters satisfied him that I was indeed the owner. Or so he
pretended, for I soon discovered that he had a reason for this
complacence. Some plan had fallen through at the last moment
whereby he had this charge alone, on Christmas Eve; high wage and
some sense of duty had obliged him to keep trust. Now he saw his
chance. He lived near&mdash;near to him who knew all the woodland
paths&mdash;and as I had returned to claim my property, could I not
excuse his service?</p>

<p>'I at once granted this favour; before the man had spoken, I had
resolved to exchange my forlorn dwelling for that of Isabelle and
her brother. There, there would be warmth and light and probably
merriment, for they must have had my letter.</p>

<p>'So I gladly let the man go, and as he was eagerly lighting his
storm lantern, I mentioned, for the pleasure of hearing it, the
name of my beloved. The nature of our attachment had been kept
secret, but I suppose there might have been some talk. My caretaker
looked at me a little oddly, and told me that Isabelle had been
married, for two years or more.</p>

<p>'I detained him, grasping his greatcoat with a strength that
seemed other than my own.</p>

<p>'But, though utterly alarmed by my demeanour, he had little more
to tell me. The brother was dead, the man she had married of a
station below her own. They were living in her old home.</p>

<p>'On hearing this, I at once knew what to do. Disguising my fury,
I sent the caretaker off with a gold piece and good wishes.</p>

<p>'The night was too wild for me to remain at the open door, but
drawing aside the slightly tattered curtains of an upper window, I
watched the light of the storm lantern disappear into the bare
woods.</p>

<p>'Thus it came that I was alone in my deserted home on Christmas
Eve, determined on murder, and lit only by a rush light.</p>

<p>'I had at once decided to kill Isabelle's husband.'</p>

<p>'Being forsaken of God and man,' said the mistress of the house,
glancing about to see if the children were all asleep. And so they
were, save those who had crept away, and whose distant laughter
could be faintly heard.</p>

<p>'Yes,' responded the old man vigorously. 'I believe I was thus
forsaken. Consider how many curious circumstances had led to my
being there, alone, at that precise hour, with that precise news. I
was beyond reason. I merely recalled to mind several incidents of
my travels that would be considered barbarous in England. I found I
had become hardened to ideas of cruelty and violence. I was no
longer the civilised creature I had been when I left Cambridge
University. It seemed obvious that my supplanter was not fit to
live, and that it was I who must remove him from the earth. I went
into one of the kitchens, the place most likely to be furnished
with what I needed. And there, indeed, I found food and wine and a
long, thin knife, such as cooks use for the slicing of meat.</p>

<p>'It had recently been in use and was well sharpened. I regarded
it as put directly into my hand. My plan was simple. I would call
on this faithless couple, and keep this weapon hidden in my cloak.
Then I would kill him, in front of her. I had learned how such
deeds were done. Indeed, although I had always acted in
self-defence, I was no novice in the use of steel.</p>

<p>'There was an oil lamp in the kitchen. I lit that, as the tallow
candle was sputtering out and took it up to the great library I
knew so well, and where some of my happiest hours had been
passed.</p>

<p>'I was disgusted to see that the caretaker had used this noble
apartment as a sleeping place, for, in an alcove where I had kept
an elegant Etruscan vase, a rude bed, with heavy blankets, had been
rigged up.</p>

<p>'I dropped the green moiré curtain, still in place though
frayed, across the unsightly couch, and sat down at my familiar
desk. I wished to be entirely cool, but really there was very
little to think about. My victims would, of course, admit me
joyfully or with pretence of joy, and in a matter of moments I
should have my revenge. I recalled my letter, addressed to Isabelle
in her maiden name and in endearing terms. Would that put them to
an embarrassment? I doubted it. I doubted much, even if I had
written that letter. That lapse of time&mdash;which would be argued
in their defence&mdash;tormented me. I ran into the hall, half
fearing I should find it empty, save for the mouldering furniture.
But there was my modest luggage and sandalwood box. What was I to
do with my precious plants? I took the box into the library and set
it on the desk. Brooding over it, I imagined the dry anatomies it
contained, spreading into a million stars or florets, like the
glittering sparkles, like the diamonds worn by tired dancers, like
the reflection in the mirrors in the riverside ballroom. Was there
not a virtue in this plant that made it almost a universal
panacea?</p>

<p>'But now that I had lost Isabelle, I cared nothing for
humanity.</p>

<p>'At one time I had thought that the heavenly powers had directed
me in my perils and labours; now I was about to tear open the box
and destroy the contents, when a knock sounded through the
house.</p>

<p>'Already guilty in intention, I started fearfully. But I soon
reassured myself. This could be no other than the stupid caretaker,
who had lost his way in the wood, or forgotten something. I should
soon be rid of him. So I went smoothly to the door, and there was
an old fellow, a tramp or vagabond, hardly to be seen in the
starlight or the gleam of the lamp I held.</p>

<p>'"It is Christmas Eve," he said. "Can you give me a
lodging?"</p>

<p>'I thought that I heard church bells in the distance, and this
rather confounded me. As I hesitated, the old fellow had slipped
into the hall. He looked so miserable that I said&mdash;what could
the offer cost me?&mdash;"You may stay here with what hospitality
you can find. As for me, I have an errand, I must
abroad&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"First show me the bed that in your great kindness you offer,"
said he with a beautiful courtesy.</p>

<p>'I led the way to the library. I thought it odd that a stranger
knocked at such an hour.</p>

<p>'I was a little jostled in my thoughts. Setting the lamp on the
desk, I regarded him closely. Not only was he poor, dejected and
old, but he seemed maimed as if beneath his ragged garments he was
crushed or twisted. He shuffled along with difficulty to the bed in
the alcove that I exposed by lifting the curtain. As he crept
painfully under the coverlets, I said, "I shall go down to the
kitchen and heat you some wine."</p>

<p>"Can your errand wait, then?" he asked softly.</p>

<p>"As long as that," I replied.</p>

<p>'I took the lamp, leaving him in darkness, blew up the charcoal
in the grate, heated the wine, and took it upstairs with some
biscuits I found.</p>

<p>'As soon as the lamp was replaced on the desk, I glanced at the
alcove. The curtain still hung in place. I forced myself to think
of Isabelle and what I intended to do. "How vexing," I thought,
"that the coming of this stranger should have diverted me, for one
single instant, from what I had planned so instantly and so
positively."</p>

<p>'"Yes, I am right," I declared aloud. "I have been forsaken and
betrayed."</p>

<p>'"Peace on earth to men of good will," said my visitor.</p>

<p>"I thank you," I replied, and I was surprised that there was
anyone to give me this ancient greeting.</p>

<p>'"Come and fetch your wine&mdash;I'll not pamper you," I said
toughly, in order to harden myself against him. I began searching
for the knife, but I could not find it. Compelled to be quite
composed, I sat down, took my head in my hands and tried to think
it all out.</p>

<p>'First, I must find the knife. Perhaps I had left it in the
kitchen. How foolish to allow myself to be disturbed by the fact
that a stranger knocked.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it would be best to destroy the plants first. I could
do that with my bare hands.</p>

<p>'I opened the sandalwood box.</p>

<p>'How often I had gloated over those dry twig-like objects and
the benefits to humanity they contained. How often I had dwelt on
Isabelle's rapture when she should bestow her name on the
marvellous plant!</p>

<p>'Now hatred should destroy what love had found.</p>

<p>'I voiced that sentiment to myself, thinking how fine it sounded
and seized the rootlets in their moss wrappings. They began to
twist and swell in my grasp, as if they had been so many
snakes.</p>

<p>'I dropped them in a rage and heard myself crying out: "This is
your doing!"</p>

<p>'There was no answer from the alcove, now lapped in shadow.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile the plants were becoming unmanageable. They twisted
out of my hands, and flew upwards like rockets, into a shower of
stars. Or so I thought&mdash;or so I thought! I retreated hastily
from the desk, and pulled aside the curtain of the alcove. And
there, calmly watching me, was the most beautiful, beautiful
being&mdash;'</p>

<p>The old man shaded his eyes and whispered to himself: 'Such
wings!'</p>

<p>'You think it was a dream?' asked the master of the house
kindly.</p>

<p>The old man smiled to himself and shook his head.</p>

<p>'It was morning. I put my sandalwood box under my arm. It was
Christmas morning, and I called on my old friend with a present.
She was pleased to see me, for she had thought me dead long ago.
She accepted the plants, now dry again in their dry
mosses&mdash;and with them some hope, for her husband was dying of
a lung disease.</p>

<p>'The chemists compounded the roots, and they cured my rival. I
forgot that I had ever hated either of them; we always used to
spend Christmas Day together.'</p>

<p>'But who reposed in your alcove?' asked the master of the house.
'It is he to whom you owe everything.'</p>

<p>'I never saw him again,' said the old man. 'He might visit you
any time. Especially I think when you feel most forsaken.'</p>

<p>'He was also a dream,' said one of the youths.</p>

<p>'No, sir, for look what I found on that humble pillow.'</p>

<p>He pulled out his watch chain and they gathered round to see a
feather that seemed to be of the finest gold, but delicate beyond
all mortal workmanship.</p>

<p>Ada Trimble was bored with the sittings. She had been persuaded
to attend against her better judgment, and the large dingy
Bloomsbury house depressed and disgusted her; the atmosphere did
not seem to her in the least spiritual and was always tainted with
the smell of stale frying.</p>

<p>The medium named herself Astra Destiny. She was a big, loose
woman with a massive face expressing power and cunning. Her
garments were made of upholstery material and round her cropped
yellowish curls she wore a tinsel belt. Her fat feet bulged through
the straps of cheap gilt shoes.</p>

<p>She had written a large number of books on subjects she termed
'esoteric' and talked more nonsense in half an hour than Ada
Trimble had heard in a lifetime. Yet madame gave an impression of
shrewd sense and considerable experience; a formidable and
implacable spirit looked through her small grey eyes and defied
anyone to pierce the cloud of humbug in which she chose to wrap
herself.</p>

<p>'I think she is detestable,' said Ada Trimble; but Helen Trent,
the woman who had introduced her to the big Bloomsbury Temple
insisted that, odious as the setting was, odd things did happen at
the sittings.</p>

<p>'It sounds like hens,' said Miss Trimble, 'but <i>séances</i>
are worse.'</p>

<p>'Well, it is easy to make jokes. And I know it is pretty
repulsive. But there are <i>unexplained</i> things. They puzzle me.
I should like your opinion on them.'</p>

<p>'I haven't seen anything yet I can't explain, the woman is a
charlatan, making money out of fools. She suspects us and might get
unpleasant, I think.'</p>

<p>But Helen Trent insisted: 'Well, if you'd been going as often as
I have, and noticing carefully, like I've been noticing...'</p>

<p>'Helen&mdash;why <i>have</i> you been interested in this
nonsense?'</p>

<p>The younger woman answered seriously: 'Because I <i>do</i> think
there is something in it.'</p>

<p>Ada Trimble respected her friend's judgment; they were both
intelligent, middle-aged, cheerful and independent in the sense
that they had unearned incomes. Miss Trimble enjoyed every moment
of her life and therefore grudged those spent in going from her
Knightsbridge flat to the grubby Bloomsbury Temple. Not even
Helen's persistency could induce Ada to continue the private
sittings that wasted money as well as time. Besides, Miss Trimble
really disliked being shut up in the stuffy, ugly room while Madame
Destiny sat in a trance and the control, a Red Indian called Purple
Stream babbled in her voice and in pidgin English about the New
Atlantis, the brotherhood of man and a few catch phrases that could
have been taken from any cheap handbook on philosophy or the
religions of the world.</p>

<p>But Helen persuaded her to join in some experiments in what were
termed typtology and lucidity that were being conducted by Madame
Destiny and a circle of choice friends. These experiments proved to
be what Ada Trimble had called in her youth 'table turning'. Five
people were present, besides Ada and Madame Destiny. The table
moved, gave raps, and conversations with various spirits followed.
A code was used, the raps corresponding in number to the letters of
the alphabet, one for 'a' and so on to twenty-six for 'z'. The
method was tedious and nothing, Miss Trimble thought, could have
been more dull. All manner of unlikely spirits appeared, a Fleming
of the twelfth century, a President of a South American Republic,
late nineteenth century, an Englishman who had been clerk to
residency at Tonkin, and who had been killed by a tiger a few years
before, a young schoolmaster who had thrown himself in front of a
train in Devonshire, a murderer who announced in classic phrase
that he had 'perished on the scaffold', a factory hand who had died
of drink in Manchester, and a retired schoolmistress recently
'passed over'.</p>

<p>The spirit of a postman and that of a young girl 'badly brought
up, who had learnt to swear', said the medium, also spoke through
the rap code. These people gave short accounts of themselves and of
their deaths and some vague generalizations about their present
state. 'I am happy.' 'I am unhappy.' 'It is wonderful here.' 'God
does not die.' 'I remain a Christian.' 'When I first died it was as
if I was stunned. Now I am used to it&mdash;' and so on.</p>

<p>They were never asked about the future, who would win the Derby,
the results of the next election or anything of that kind. 'It
wouldn't be fair,' smiled Madame Destiny. 'Besides, they probably
don't know.'</p>

<p>The more important spirits were quickly identified by references
to the <i>National Dictionary of Biography</i> for the English
celebrities and <i>Larousse</i> for the foreign. The Temple
provided potted editions of each work. These reliable tomes
confirmed all that the spirits said as to their careers and ends.
The obscure spirits if they gave dates and place names were traced
by enquiries of Town Clerks and Registrars. This method always
worked out, too.</p>

<p>Madame Destiny sometimes showed the letters that proved that the
spirits had once had, as she hideously quoted 'a local habitation
and a name'.</p>

<p>'I can't think why you are interested,' said Ada Trimble to
Helen Trent as they drove home together. 'It is such an easy fraud.
Clever, of course, but she has only to keep all the stuff in her
head.'</p>

<p>'You mean that she looks up the references first?"</p>

<p>'Of course.' Ada Trimble was a little surprised that Helen
should ask so simple a question. 'And those postmen and servant
girls could be got up, too, quite easily.'</p>

<p>'It would be expensive. And she doesn't charge much.'</p>

<p>'She makes a living out of it,' said Ada Trimble sharply.
'Between the lectures, the healings, the services, the sittings,
the lending library and those ninepenny teas, I think the Temple of
Eastern Psycho-Physiological Studies does pretty well...' She
looked quickly at her companion and in a changed voice asked:
'You're not getting&mdash;drawn in&mdash;are you, Helen?'</p>

<p>'Oh no! At least I don't think so, but last year, when you were
in France, I was rather impressed&mdash;it was the direct voice. I
wish it would happen again, I should like your opinion&mdash;'
Helen Trent's voice faltered and stopped; it was a cold night, she
drew her collar and scarf up more closely round her delicate face.
The smart comfortable little car was passing over the bridge. The
two women looked out at the street and ink-blue pattern of the
Serpentine, the bare trees on the banks, the piled buildings
beyond, stuck with vermilion and orange lights. The November wind
struck icy across Ada Trimble's face.</p>

<p>'I don't know why I forgot the window,' she said, rapidly
closing it. 'I suggest that we leave Madame Destiny alone, Helen. I
don't believe that sort of thing is any good, it might easily get
on one's nerves.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Helen irrelevantly, 'what are dreams, anyway?'</p>

<p>Ada remembered how little she knew of the early life of her
cultured, elegant friend and how much she had forgotten of her own
youthful experiences that had once seemed so warm, so important, so
terrible.</p>

<p>'Come next Tuesday, at least,' pleaded Helen as she left the car
for the wet pavement. 'She has promised the direct voice.'</p>

<p>'I ought to go, because of Helen,' thought Ada Trimble. 'She is
beginning to be affected by this nonsense. Those rogues know that
she has money.'</p>

<p>So on the Tuesday the two charming women in their rich, quiet
clothes, with their tasteful veils, handbags, furs and posies of
violets and gardenias were seated in the upper room in the
Bloomsbury Temple with the queer shoddy folk who made up Madame
Destiny's audience.</p>

<p>Ada Trimble settled into her chair; it was comfortable like all
the chairs in the Temple and she amused herself by looking round
the room. The Victorian wallpaper had been covered by dark serge,
clumsily pinned up; dusty crimson chenille curtains concealed the
tall windows. Worn linoleum was on the floor, the table stood in
the centre of the room and on it was a small, old-fashioned
gramophone with a horn. By it was a small red lamp; this, and the
light from the cheerful gas fire, was the only illumination in the
room.</p>

<p>A joss stick smouldered in a brass vase on the mantelpiece but
this sickly perfume could not disguise the eternal smell of stew
and onions that hung about the Temple.</p>

<p>'I suppose they live on a permanent hot-pot,' thought Ada
Trimble vaguely as she looked round on the gathered company.</p>

<p>The medium lay sprawled in the largest chair; she appeared to be
already in a trance; her head was sunk on her broad breast and her
snorting breath disturbed the feather edging on her brocade robe.
The cheap belt round her head, the cheap gilt shoes, exasperated
Ada Trimble once more. 'For a woman of <i>sense</i>&mdash;', she
thought.</p>

<p>Near the medium was a husband, who called himself Lemoine. He
was a turnip-coloured nondescript man, wearing a dirty collar and
slippers; his manner hesitated between the shamefaced and the
insolent. He was not very often seen, but Ada sometimes suspected
him of being the leader of the whole concern.</p>

<p>She speculated with a shudder, and not for the first time, on
the private lives of this repulsive couple. What were they like
when they were alone together? What did they say when they dropped
the gibberish and the posing? Were they ever quite sincere or quite
clean? She had heard they lived in a 'flat' at the top of the house
and had turned a bleak Victorian bathroom into a kitchen and that
they had 'difficulties with servants'.</p>

<p>Beside Mr Lemoine was Essie Clark, a stringy, cheerful woman who
was Madame Destiny's secretary, and as Ada Trimble supposed,
maid-of-all-work, too. She had been 'caught' sweeping the stairs
and Ada thought that she mixed the permanent stew.</p>

<p>Essie's taste had stopped, dead as a smashed clock, in childhood
and she wore straight gowns of faded green that fifty years before
had been termed 'artistic' by frustrated suburban spinsters, and
bunches of little toys and posies made of nuts and leather.</p>

<p>The circle was completed by the people well known to Ada: a
common overdressed little woman who called spiritualism her 'hobby'
and who was on intimate terms with the spirit of her late husband,
and a damp, depressed man, Mr Maple, who had very little to say for
himself beyond an occasional admission that he was 'investigating
and couldn't be sure'.</p>

<p>The little woman, Mrs Penfleet, said cheerfully: 'I am certain
dear Arthur will come today. I dreamt of him last night,' and she
eyed the trumpet coyly.</p>

<p>'We don't know who will come, if anyone,' objected Mr Maple
gloomily. 'We've got to keep open minds.'</p>

<p>Mr Lemoine begged for silence and Miss Clark put on a disc that
played 'Rock of Ages'.</p>

<p>Ada Trimble's mind flashed to the consumptive Calvinist who had
written that hymn; she felt slightly sick and glanced at Helen,
dreamy, elegant, sunk in her black velvet collar.</p>

<p>Ada looked at the trumpet, at the medium, and whispered
'Ventriloquism' as she bent to drop and pick up her handkerchief,
but Helen whispered back: '<i>Wait</i>.'</p>

<p>Essie Clark took off the record and returned to her chair with a
smile of pleased expectancy. It was all in the day's work for her,
like cheapening the food off the barrows in the Portobello Road.
Ada Trimble kept her glance from the fire and the lamp, lest,
comfortable and drowsy as she was, she should be hypnotised with
delusions&mdash;'Though I don't think it likely here,' she said to
herself, 'in these sordid surroundings.'</p>

<p>There was a pause; the obviously dramatic prelude to the drama.
Madame Destiny appeared to be unconscious. Ada thought: 'There
ought to be a doctor here to make sure.' A humming sound came from
the painted horn that had curled-back petals like a metallic
flower. 'Arthur!' came from Mrs Penfleet and 'Hush!' from Mr Maple.
Ada felt dull, a party to a cheap, ignoble fraud. 'How dare they!'
she thought indignantly, 'fool with such things&mdash;supposing one
of the dead <i>did</i> return.' The gramophone was making
incoherent noises, hummings and sighings.</p>

<p>'The psychic force is manifest,' whispered Mr Lemoine reverently
in familiar phrase.</p>

<p>There was another pause; Ada Trimble's attention wandered to
obtrusive details, the pattern of the braid encircling Madame
Destiny's bent head, a dull yellow in the lamp's red glow, and the
firmness with which her podgy fingers gripped the pad and pencil,
even though she was supposed to be in a state of trance.</p>

<p>Suddenly a deep masculine voice said:</p>

<p>'<i>Beautus qui intelligit super egenum et pauperem</i>.'</p>

<p>Ada was utterly startled; she felt as if another personality was
in the room, she sat forward and looked around; she felt Helen's
cold fingers clutch hers; she had not more than half understood the
Latin; nor, it seemed, had anyone else. Only Mr Lemoine remained
cool, almost indifferent. Leaning forward he addressed the
gramophone:</p>

<p>'That is a proverb or quotation?'</p>

<p>The deep voice replied:</p>

<p>'It is my epitaph.'</p>

<p>'It is, perhaps, on your tomb?' asked Mr Lemoine gently.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Where is your tomb?'</p>

<p>'I do not choose to disclose.' The voice was speaking with a
marked accent. It now added in French: 'Is there no one here that
speaks my language?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Ada Trimble, almost without her own volition. French
was very familiar to her and she could not disregard the direct
appeal.</p>

<p>'<i>Eh, bien</i>!' the voice which had always an arrogant,
scornful tone, seemed gratified and ran on at once in French. 'I
have a very fine tomb&mdash;a monument, I should say, shaded with
chestnut trees. Every year, on my anniversary, it is covered with
wreaths.'</p>

<p>'Who are you?' asked Ada Trimble faintly, but Mr Lemoine gently
interposed:</p>

<p>'As the other members of our circle don't speak French,' he told
the gramophone, 'will you talk in English?'</p>

<p>'Any language is easy to me,' boasted the voice in English, 'but
I prefer my own tongue.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Mr Lemoine. 'The lady asked you who you
were&mdash;will you tell us?'</p>

<p>'Gabriel Letoumeau.'</p>

<p>'Would you translate your epitaph?'</p>

<p>'Blessed is he who understands the poor and has pity on the
unfortunate.'</p>

<p>'What were you?'</p>

<p>'Many things.'</p>

<p>'When did you die?'</p>

<p>'A hundred years ago. May 12th, 1837.'</p>

<p>'Will you tell us something more about yourself?'</p>

<p>The voice was harsh and scornful.</p>

<p>'It would take a long time to relate my exploits. I was a
professor, a peer, a philosopher, a man of action. I have left my
many works behind me.'</p>

<p>'Please give the titles.' Mr Lemoine, who had always been so
effaced and who looked so incompetent was proving himself cool and
skilful at this question and answer with the voice.</p>

<p>'There are too many.'</p>

<p>'You had pupils?'</p>

<p>'Many famous men.'</p>

<p>'Will you give the names?'</p>

<p>'You continually ask me to break your rules,' scolded the
voice.</p>

<p>'What rules?'</p>

<p>'The rules spirits have to obey.'</p>

<p>'You are a Christian?'</p>

<p>'I have never been ashamed to call myself so.'</p>

<p>'Where&mdash;in the Gospels&mdash;is the rule of which you
speak?' asked Mr Lemoine sharply. 'There are special rules for
spirits?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>So the dialogue went on, more or less on orthodox lines, but Ada
Trimble was held and fascinated by the quality and accent of the
voice. It was rough, harsh, intensely masculine, with a definite
foreign accent. The tone was boastful and arrogant to an
insufferable extent. Ada Trimble detested this pompous, insistent
personality; she felt odd, a little dazed, a little confused; the
orange glow of the gas fire, the red glow of the lamp, the metallic
gleams on the horn fused into a fiery pattern before her eyes. She
felt as if she were being drawn into a void in which nothing
existed but the voice.</p>

<p>Even Mr Lemoine's thin tones, faintly questioning, seemed a long
way off, a thread of sound compared to the deep boom of the voice.
The conversation was like a ball being deftly thrown to and fro. Mr
Lemoine asked: 'What do you understand by faith?' And the voice,
steadily rising to a roar, replied: 'The Faith as taught by the
Gospel.'</p>

<p>'Does not the Gospel contain moral precepts rather than
dogma?'</p>

<p>'Why that remark?'</p>

<p>'Because narrow or puerile practices have been built on this
basis.'</p>

<p>'A clear conscience sees further than practices.'</p>

<p>'I see that you are a believer,' said Mr Lemoine placidly. 'What
is your present situation?'</p>

<p>'Explain!' shouted the voice.</p>

<p>'Are you in Heaven, Hell or purgatory?' rapped out Mr
Lemoine.</p>

<p>'I am in Heaven!'</p>

<p>'How is it that you are in Heaven and here at the same
time?'</p>

<p>'You are a fool,' said the voice stridently. 'Visit my grave and
you will understand more about me.'</p>

<p>'Once more, where is your grave?'</p>

<p>The horn gave a groan of derision and was silent; Mr Lemoine
repeated his question, there was no answer; he then wiped his
forehead and turned to his wife who was heaving back to
consciousness.</p>

<p>'That is all for today,' he smiled round the little circle; no
one save Ada and Helen seemed affected by the experience; Mr Maple
made some gloomy sceptical remarks; Mrs Penfleet complained because
Arthur had not spoken and Essie Clark indifferently and efficiently
put away the gramophone and the records.</p>

<p>When the red lamp was extinguished and the light switched on,
Ada looked at Madame Destiny who was rubbing her eyes and smiling
with an exasperating shrewd blandness.</p>

<p>'It was Gabriel Letourneau,' her husband told her mildly. 'You
remember I told you he came some months ago?' He glanced at Ada.
'The medium never knows what spirit speaks.'</p>

<p>Ada glanced at Helen who sat quiet and downcast, then
mechanically gathered up her gloves and handbag.</p>

<p>'Did you find this person in Larousse?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No. We tried other sources too, but never could discover
anything. Very likely he is a liar, quite a number of them are, you
know. I always ask him the same questions, but as you heard, there
is no satisfaction to be got.'</p>

<p>'He always boasts so,' complained Mr Maple, 'and particularly
about his grave.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' smiled Mr Lemoine rising to indicate that the sitting was
at an end. 'He is a common type, a snob. When he was alive he
boasted about his distinctions, visits to court and so on; now he
is dead he boasts of having seen God, being in Heaven and the
marvels of his grave.'</p>

<p>When they were out in the wind-swept evening Helen clasped Ada's
arm.</p>

<p>'Now, what do you make of <i>that</i>? Ventriloquism? It is a
personality.'</p>

<p>'It is odd, certainly. I was watching the woman. Her lips didn't
move&mdash;save just for snorting or groaning now and then.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I dare say it could be done,' said Helen impatiently. 'But
I don't think it is a trick. I can't feel that it is. Can you? That
is what I wanted you to hear. There have been other queer things,
but this is the queerest. What do you think?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Helen, dear, I don't know!' Ada was slightly trembling. 'I
never thought that I could be moved by anything like this.'</p>

<p>'That is it, isn't it?' interrupted Helen, clinging to her as
they passed along the cold street. '<i>Moved</i>&mdash;and what
by?'</p>

<p>'Intense dislike&mdash;the man is loathsome!'</p>

<p>'There! You said <i>man</i>. It was a voice only!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Helen!'</p>

<p>They walked in silence to the waiting car and when inside began
to talk again in low tones, pressed together. No, there was no
explanation possible, any attempt at one landed you in a bog of
difficulties.</p>

<p>'He spoke to me,' sighed Ada Trimble, 'and, you know I quite
forgot that he wasn't <i>there</i>&mdash;I wish that I could have
gone on talking to him, I feel that I should have been sufficiently
insistent&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To&mdash;what, Ada?'</p>

<p>'To make him say something definite about himself&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's crazy, Ada! It lets loose all kinds of dreadful thoughts.
He might be here now, riding with us.'</p>

<p>'Well, he can't talk without the trumpet.' Then both women
laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>'My dear, we are getting foolish!' said Helen, and Ada answered:
'Yes. Foolish either way&mdash;to talk of it all if we think it was
a fraud&mdash;and not to be more serious if we don't think it a
fraud.'</p>

<p>But as people usually will when in this kind of dilemma, they
compromised; they discussed the thing and decided to put it to the
test once again.</p>

<p>They became frequent visitors to the Bloomsbury Temple and began
to pay to have private sittings with the direct voice.</p>

<p>Busy as they were, Madame Destiny and Mr Lemoine 'fitted in' a
good number of these and the harsh voice that called itself Gabriel
Letourneau usually spoke, though there were annoying occasions when
Persian sages, Polish revolutionaries and feebleminded girls of
unknown nationality, insisted on expounding colourless views.</p>

<p>By the spring the personality of Gabriel Letourneau was complete
to Ada and Helen. They had been able to build him up, partly from
details he had supplied himself and partly out of their own uneasy
imaginations. He had been&mdash;or was now, but they dare not
speculate upon his present shape&mdash;a tall, dark, gaunt
Frenchman, with side whiskers and a blue chin, the kind of brown
eyes known as 'piercing' and a fanatical, grim expression.</p>

<p>Ada had often spoken to him in French but she could never
penetrate his identity. A professor, a peer in the reign of Louis
Philippe? It was impossible for her to attempt to trace so elusive
a person. At first she did not try; she told herself that she had
other things to do and she tried to keep the thing out of her mind,
or at least to keep it reduced to proper proportions. But this soon
proved impossible and sensible, charming, broad-minded Ada Trimble
at length found herself in the grip of an obsession.</p>

<p>The voice and her hatred of the voice. It was useless for her to
tell herself, as she frequently did, that the voice was only that
of the woman who called herself Astra Destiny and not a personality
at all. This was hopeless, she believed in Gabriel Letourneau. He
had, she was sure, a bad effect on her character and on that of
Helen. But opposite effects. Whereas Helen became limp, distracted,
nervous and talked vaguely of being 'Haunted', Ada felt as if
active evil was clouding her soul.</p>

<p>Why should she hate the voice? She had always been afraid of
hatred. She knew that the person who hates, not the person who is
hated, is the one who is destroyed. When she disliked a person or a
thing she had always avoided it, making exceptions only in the
cases of cruelty and fanaticism. There she had allowed hate to
impel her to exertions foreign to her reserved nature. And now
there was hatred of Gabriel Letourneau possessing her like a
poison. He hated her, too. When she spoke to him he told her in his
rapid French that Helen could not follow, his scornful opinion of
her; he called her an 'aging woman'; he said she was pretension,
facile, a silly little atheist while 'I am in Heaven.'</p>

<p>He made acid comments on her carefully chosen clothes, on her
charmingly arranged hair, her little armoury of wit and culture, on
her delicate illusions and vague, romantic hopes. She felt stripped
and defaced after one of these dialogues in which she could not
hold her own. Sometimes she tried to shake herself out of 'this
nonsense'. She would look sharply at the entranced medium; Ada had
never made the mistake of undervaluing the intelligence of Astra
Destiny and surely the conversation of Gabriel Letourneau was
flavoured with feminine malice?</p>

<p>Out in the street with Helen she would say: 'We really are
fools! It is only an out-of-date gramophone.'</p>

<p>'Is it?' asked Helen bleakly. 'And ventriloquism?' Then she
added: 'Where does she&mdash;that awful woman&mdash;get that fluent
French?'</p>

<p>'Oh, when you begin asking questions!' cried Ada.</p>

<p>She examined the subject from all angles, she went to people
who, she thought, 'ought to know', but she could get no
satisfaction; it was a matter on which the wisest said the
least.</p>

<p>'If only he wouldn't keep boasting!' she complained to Helen.
'His grave&mdash;that now&mdash;he says it is a marvellous monument
and that people keep putting wreaths on it, that they make
pilgrimages to it&mdash;and Helen, why should I mind? I ought to be
pleased that he has that satisfaction or&mdash;at least, be
indifferent&mdash;but I'm not.'</p>

<p>'He's been hateful to you, to us,' said Helen simply. 'I loathe
him, too&mdash;let us try to get away from him.'</p>

<p>'I can't.'</p>

<p>Helen went; she drifted out of Ada's life with a shivering
reluctance to leave her, but with a definite inability to face the
situation created by Gabriel Letourneau. She wrote from Cairo and
presently did not write at all. Ada, left alone with her obsession,
no longer struggled against it; she pitted herself deliberately
against the voice. Sometimes, as she came and went in the
Bloomsbury Temple, she would catch a glint in the dull eyes of Mr
Lemoine or the flinty eyes of Madame Destiny that made her reflect
how many guineas she had paid them. But even these flashes of
conviction that she was being the worst type of fool did not save
her; she had reached the point when she had to give rein to her
fortune.</p>

<p>In September she went to France; countless friends helped her to
search archives; there was no member of the Chamber of Peers under
Louis Philippe named Letourneau. She wrote to the keepers of the
famous cemeteries, she visited these repulsive places herself;
there were Letourneaus, not a few, but none with pre-name Gabriel,
or with the inscription quoted by the voice. Nor was there anywhere
an imposing monument, covered with wreaths and visited by pilgrims,
to a professor peer who had died in 1837.</p>

<p>'Fraud,' she kept telling herself, 'that wretched couple just
practised a very clever fraud on me. But why? What an odd
personality for people like that to invent! And the deep masculine
voice and the idiomatic French&mdash;clever is hardly the word. I
suppose they got the data from Larousse.' The courteous friends
helped her to make enquiries at the Sorbonne. No professors of that
name there, or at any of the other big universities.</p>

<p>Ada Trimble believed that she was relieved from her burden of
credulity and hate; perhaps if she kept away from the Bloomsbury
Temple the thing would pass out of her mind. She was in this mood
when she received an answer to a letter she had written to the
keeper of the cemetery at Sceaux. She had written to so many
officials and it had been so long since she had written to Sceaux
and she had such little expectation of any result from her
enquiries that she scarcely took much interest in opening the
letter.</p>

<p>It read thus:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Madame,</span> In reply to
your letter of November 30th, I have the honour to inform you that
I have made a search for the Letourneau tomb which fortunately I
found and I have copied the epitaph cut on the tomb.</p>

<p class="letter">Gabriel Letourneau Man of Letters<br>
Died at Sceaux June 10th 1858.<br>
Beatus qui intelligit<br>
Super egenum et pauperem.</p>

<p class="letter">This neglected grave was in a miserable condition
covered by weeds; in order to send you the above information it was
necessary to undertake cleaning that occupied an hour, and this
merely on the portion that bears the inscription. According to the
registry this Letourneau was a poor tutor; his eccentric habits are
still remembered in the quarter where he lived. He has become a
legend&mdash;and 'he boasts like a Gabriel Letourneau' is often
said of a braggart. He has left no descendants and no one has
visited his grave. He left a small sum of money to pay for the
epitaph.</p>

<p class="letter">(signed) <span class="smcap">Robert,</span>
Keeper of the Cemetery at Sceaux.<br>
231 Rue Louis le Grand,<br>
Sceaux (Seine).</p>
<br>

<p>Ada Trimble went at once to Sceaux. She arrived there on a day
of chill, small rain, similar to that on which she had first heard
the voice in the Bloomsbury Temple. There was a large, black
cemetery, a row of bare chestnut-trees overlooking the walls, an
ornate gate. The conscientious keeper, M. Robert, conducted her to
the abandoned grave in the comer of the large graveyard; the
rotting, dank rubbish of last year's weeds had been cut away above
the inscription that Ada had first heard in the Bloomsbury Temple a
year ago.</p>

<p>She gazed and went away, full of strange terror. What was the
solution of the miserable problem? There were many ways in which
the Lemoine couple might have chanced to hear of the poor tutor of
Sceaux, but how had they come to know of the epitaph for years
concealed behind ivy, bramble and moss? M. Robert, who was so
evidently honest, declared that he never remembered anyone making
enquiries about the Letourneau grave and he had been years in this
post. He doubted, he said, whether even the people to whom the name
of the eccentric was a proverb knew of the existence of his grave.
Then, the shuffling of the dates, 1858 instead of 1837, the lies
about the state of the grave and the position that Letourneau had
held while in life.</p>

<p>Ada had a sickly qualm when she reflected how this fitted in
with the character she had been given of a slightly unhinged
braggart with ego mania. A peerage, the Sorbonne, the
monument&mdash;all lies?</p>

<p>Ada returned to England and asked Madame Destiny to arrange
another sitting for her with the direct voice. She also asked for
as large a circle as possible to be invited, all the people who had
ever heard Gabriel Letourneau.</p>

<p>'Oh, that will be a large number,' said Madame Destiny quickly,
'he is one of the spirits who visits us most frequently.'</p>

<p>'Never mind, the large room, please, and I will pay all
expenses. I think I have found out something about that
gentleman.'</p>

<p>'How interesting,' said Madame Destiny, with civil
blankness.</p>

<p>'Can she possibly know where I have been?' thought Ada Trimble,
but it seemed absurd to suppose that this hard-up couple, existing
by shifts, should have the means to employ spies and detectives.
The meeting was arranged and as all the seats were free, the room
was full.</p>

<p>The gramophone was on a raised platform; it was placed on a
table beside which sat Madame Destiny to the right and her husband
to the left. The red lamp was in place. A dark curtain, badly
pinned up, formed the back cloth. Save for the gas fire, the
room&mdash;a large Victorian salon&mdash;was in darkness. Ada
Trimble sat on one of the Bentwood chairs in the front row. 'He
won't come,' she thought. 'I shall never hear the voice again. And
the whole absurdity will be over.'</p>

<p>But the medium was no sooner twitching in a trance than the
voice came rushing from the tin horn. It spoke directly to Ada
Trimble and she felt her heart heave with horror as she heard the
cringing tone.</p>

<p>'Good evening, madame, and how charming you are tonight! Your
travels have improved you&mdash;you recall my little jokes, my
quips? Only to test your wit, dear lady, I have always admired you
so much&mdash;'</p>

<p>Ada could not reply, the one thought beat in her mind, half
paralysing her, 'He knows what I found out&mdash;he is trying to
flatter me so that I don't give him away.'</p>

<p>The voice's opening remarks had been in French and for this Mr
Lemoine called him to order; the usual verbal duel followed,
Lemoine pressing the spirit to give proof of his identity, the
spirit arrogantly defending his secrets. The audience that had
heard this parrying between Lemoine and Letourneau before so often
was not interested and Ada Trimble did not hear anything, she was
fiercely concerned with her own terror and bewilderment. Then the
voice, impatiently breaking off the bitter sparring, addressed her
directly in oily, flattering accents.</p>

<p>'What a pleasure that we meet again, how charming to see you
here! The time has been very long since I saw you last.'</p>

<p>Ada roused herself; she began to speak in a thick voice that she
could scarcely have recognised as her own.</p>

<p>'Yes, one is drawn to what one dislikes as surely as towards
what one hates. I have been too much concerned with you, I hope now
that I shall be free.'</p>

<p>'Miss Trimble,' protested Mr Lemoine, 'there are others present,
pray speak in English. I think you said that you had been able to
identify this spirit quite precisely.'</p>

<p>In French the gramophone harshly whispered: 'Take care.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Mr Lemoine briskly, 'this lady says she found your
grave, what have you to say to that?'</p>

<p>'I beg the lady not to talk of my private affairs'; voice and
accent were alike thick, with agitation, perhaps despair.</p>

<p>'But you have often spoken of your tomb, the wreaths, the
pilgrimages, you have talked of your peerage, your professorship,
your pupils. As you would never give us corroborative details, this
lady took the trouble to find them out.'</p>

<p>'Let her give them,' said the voice, 'when we are
alone&mdash;she and I.'</p>

<p>'What would be the sense of that?' demanded Mr Lemoine. 'All
these people know you well, they are interested&mdash;now Miss
Trimble.'</p>

<p>'I found the grave in Sceaux cemetery,' began Ada.</p>

<p>The voice interrupted her furiously: 'You are doing a very
foolish thing!'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Mr Lemoine coolly, 'you are still an earthbound
spirit. You are afraid that something hurtful to your vanity is
about to be revealed...'</p>

<p>'You should be free from this material delusion. We,' added the
turnip-faced man pompously, 'are neither noble nor learned. We
shall not think the less of you if it is true you have
boasted.'</p>

<p>'I am not a boaster!' stormed the voice.</p>

<p>'Your grave is in the cemetery at Sceaux,' said Ada Trimble
rapidly. 'You died in 1858, not 1837; you were neither peer nor
professor&mdash;no one visits your grave. It is miserable,
neglected, covered with weeds. It took the keeper an hour's work
even to cut away the rubbish sufficiently to see your epitaph.'</p>

<p>'Now we know that,' said Mr Lemoine smoothly, 'we can help you
to shake off these earthly chains.'</p>

<p>'These are lies.' The voice rose to a hum like the sound of a
spinning top. 'Lies&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No,' cried Ada. 'You have lied, you have never seen God,
either.'</p>

<p>'You may,' suggested Mr Lemoine, 'have seen a fluid personage in
a bright illumination, but how could you have been sure it was
God?'</p>

<p>The humming sound grew louder, then the horn flew over, as if
wrenched off and toppled on to the table, then on to the floor. Mr
Lemoine crossed the platform and switched on the light.</p>

<p>'An evil spirit,' he said in his routine voice, 'now that he has
been exposed I don't suppose that he will trouble us again.' And he
congratulated Ada on her shrewd and careful investigations, though
the stare he gave her through his glasses seemed to express a mild
wonder as to why she had taken so much trouble. The meeting broke
up; there was coffee for a few chosen guests upstairs in the room
lined with books on the 'occult'; no one seemed impressed by the
meeting; they talked of other things, only Ada Trimble was
profoundly moved.</p>

<p>This was the first time she had come to these banal
coffee-drinkings. Hardly knowing what she did she had come upstairs
with these queer, self-possessed people who seemed to own something
she had not got. They were neither obsessed nor afraid. Was she
afraid? Had not Gabriel Letourneau vanished for ever? Had he not
broken the means of communication between them? Undoubtedly she had
exorcized him, she would be free now of this miserable, humiliating
and expensive obsession. She tried to feel triumphant, released,
but her spirit would not soar. In the back of her mind surged
self-contempt. 'Why did I do it? There was no need. His lies hurt
no one. To impress these people was his one pleasure&mdash;perhaps
he is in hell, and that was his one freedom from torment&mdash;but
I must think sanely.'</p>

<p>This was not easy to do; she seemed to have lost all will-power,
all judgment. 'I wish Helen had not escaped,' she used the last
word unconsciously; her fingers were cold round the thick cup, her
face in the dingy mirror above the fireplace looked blurred and
odd. She tried to steady herself by staring at the complacent
features of Astra Destiny, who was being distantly gracious to a
circle of admirers, and then by talking to commonplace Mr Lemoine
whose indifference was certainly soothing. 'Oh, yes,' he said
politely, 'we get a good deal of that sort of thing. Malicious
spirits&mdash;evil influences&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Aren't you afraid?' asked Ada faintly.</p>

<p>'Afraid?' asked Mr Lemoine as if he did not know what the word
meant. 'Oh, dear no, we are quite safe&mdash;' he added, then said:
'Of course, if one was afraid, if one didn't quite believe, there
might be danger. Any weakness on one's own part always gives the
spirits a certain power over one.'</p>

<p>All this was, Ada knew, merely 'patter'; she had heard it, and
similar talk, often enough and never paid much attention to it; now
it seemed to trickle through her inner consciousness like a flow of
icy water. She was afraid, she didn't quite believe; yet how could
she even but think that? Now she must believe. Astra Destiny could
not have 'faked' Gabriel Letourneau. Well, then, he was a real
person&mdash;a real spirit? Ada Trimble's mind that once had been
so cool and composed, so neat and tidy, now throbbed in
confusion.</p>

<p>'Where do they go?' she asked childishly. 'These evil spirits? I
mean&mdash;today&mdash;will he come again?'</p>

<p>'I don't suppose so, not here. He will try to do all he can
elsewhere. Perhaps he will try to impose on other people. I'm
afraid he has wasted a good deal of our time.'</p>

<p>'How can you say "wasted!"' whispered Ada Trimble bleakly. 'He
proves that the dead return.'</p>

<p>'We don't need such proof,' said Mr Lemoine, meekly confident
and palely smiling.</p>

<p>'I had better go home now,' said Ada; she longed to escape and
yet dreaded to leave the warmth, the light, the company; perhaps
these people were protected and so were safe from the loathed,
prowling, outcast spirit. She said goodbye to Madame Destiny who
was pleasant, as usual, without being effusive, and then to the
others. She could not resist saying to Essie Clark: 'Do you think
that I did right?'</p>

<p>'Right?' the overworked woman smiled mechanically, the chipped
green coffee-pot suspended in her hand.</p>

<p>'In exposing&mdash;the voice&mdash;the spirit?'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>that</i>! Of course. You couldn't have done anything
else, could you?' And Miss Clark poured her coffee and handed the
cup, with a tired pleasantry, to a tall Indian who was the only
elegant looking person present. Ada Trimble went out on to the
landing; the smell of frying, of stew, filled the gaunt stairway;
evidently one of the transient servants was in residence; through
the half-open door behind her, Ada could hear the babble of voices,
then another voice, deep, harsh, that whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>'<i>Canaille!</i>'</p>

<p>She started forward, missed her foot-hold and fell.</p>

<p>Mr Lemoine, always efficient, was the first to reach the foot of
the stairs. Ada Trimble had broken her neck.</p>

<p>'A pure accident,' said Astra Destiny, pale, but mistress of the
situation. 'Everyone is witness that she was quite alone at the
time. She has been very nervous lately and those high heels...'</p>

<h2><a name="story6" id="story6"></a>BRENT'S FOLLY</h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Crimes of Old London</i>, Odhams Ltd., London,
1919</h3>

<p>They said each Brent had his folly, a horse, a woman, a
building, an idea, but the present Brent outshone his ancestors by
the blatant coarseness of his particular caprice.</p>

<p>When his father had seriously encumbered the estates to build on
another wing with a massive ballroom that accorded ill with the
Tudor Manor house, the county had remarked that the historic folly
of the Brents had passed the limits of the picturesque and romantic
and become very like stupidity.</p>

<p>The next Brent, however, excelled the foolish action of his
father, for his folly took the form of flesh and blood; to make a
mistake about a woman, said the county, was worse than to make a
mistake about a building, though there were some cynics who
declared that the latter error was worse because the woman passed
with her generation and was easily forgotten, whereas the stone and
brick remained a lasting annoyance till someone had the courage,
time, and money to remove it.</p>

<p>But while she was there, certainly the woman was the greater
cause for marvel, the greater shame to the good taste and
intelligence of the Brents.</p>

<p>If she had been outrageous, impossible, an actress, a foreigner,
a milkmaid, it might have been a folly forgiven and even
admired.</p>

<p>If she had been ugly and very rich, or beautiful and very poor,
it would have been a thing condoned&mdash;an action with at least a
motive, some reason to explain the extravagance, the departure from
the usual which was more or less expected of the Brents.</p>

<p>But here there was nothing of wonderful, nothing of
romantic&mdash;nothing to make people startle and stare.</p>

<p>She was the younger daughter of a dull, middle-class family of
correct education and morals, neither plain nor pretty, with bad
health and a lethargic temperament, and most dismal dull in
company.</p>

<p>She excelled in nothing, her taste was of the worst, she could
not manage her servants nor her acquaintances, she was jealous and
sullen and entirely indifferent to all that makes the fire and
colour of life.</p>

<p>And she was five years older than her husband, and after many
years of marriage was still childless.</p>

<p>And this was the folly of the last Brent, Sir Roger, handsome,
accomplished, brilliant, wealthy.</p>

<p>People asked each other what hidden motive had induced him to
offer all to this woman who could not even appreciate what he
gave.</p>

<p>Of all the follies of the Brents this was the most
inexplicable.</p>

<p>If she had been only wicked, the thing might have been
understood, if she had shown the least sign of any of the arts and
graces of an enchantress he would have stood excused.</p>

<p>But she was neutral, she was nothing, she had not a single charm
that would have induced an ordinary man to choose her for the love
of a season, and instead Roger Brent had chosen her for his
wife&mdash;this was what was neither understood nor forgiven.</p>

<p>The county disapproved and showed its disapproval; Sir Roger
lost many friends; he became a gloomy self-absorbed man, withdrawn
slightly from his fellows.</p>

<p>He rarely left Brent Manor; he was a good landlord, a good
neighbour, a fine figure among the country gentry&mdash;if it had
not been for his marriage.</p>

<p>But that had ruined all; Sir Roger at forty was considered as a
man with no longer any possibilities before him; he would live and
die the squire of Brent Manor, nothing more.</p>

<p>For, like damp ashes on fire, his wife seemed to have choked and
stifled all that was eager, ambitious and ardent in Sir Roger; he
had sacrificed to this nullity all that a man could sacrifice to
beauty and worth.</p>

<p>When Charles Denton, who had known and envied Sir Roger in the
days of their common youth, returned to England from Spain, where
he had been fulfilling honourable and profitable duties for His
Majesty's Government, he heard from several the story of the folly
of the last of the Brents.</p>

<p>The last of the Brents and the last of the follies it appeared,
since there was no one of the name to carry on the family and the
family traditions.</p>

<p>Denton was sorry; he had almost loved Sir Roger, they had been
constantly together until Denton's foreign appointment had
separated them.</p>

<p>He wrote to Sir Roger and asked if he might spend some of his
leave at Brent Manor; Sir Roger responded cordially, and Denton
went down to Brent with a little ache of regret at his heart for
the fate of his friend.</p>

<p>He found him as much changed as the reports in London had led
him to believe he would be, and despite his preparation he was
shocked, almost startled.</p>

<p>Sir Roger, for whom 'brilliant' had always seemed the most
fitting epithet, had become almost dull; he was silent, almost shy,
even with the old friend whom he had seemed so glad to welcome.</p>

<p>His clothes were of an ancient pattern, he was listless in his
manner, the unpowdered hair was plentifully sprinkled with grey,
the handsome face hard and lined.</p>

<p>The Manor house, too, seemed ill-kept and gloomy.</p>

<p>Denton had an impression of gloom from all his surroundings.</p>

<p>At supper he saw the lady of the house. She was neatly dressed
in a gay sacque; her manner was dull and civil.</p>

<p>Denton eyed her in vain for a single merit; her figure was
ill-shaped and slightly stooping, her hands and feet were large,
her complexion was of an ugly pallor, her features soft and heavy,
eyes and hair of a colourless brown, her movements without meaning,
her words without grace.</p>

<p>Denton inwardly sighed and the supper hour passed heavily.</p>

<p>She left them early and Denton, spurred by a deep impulse,
turned swiftly to his host and asked:</p>

<p>'Why did you marry her?'</p>

<p>Sir Roger was sitting in a dejected attitude with his head a
little lowered.</p>

<p>As his friend spoke he looked up, and a smile touched his sombre
features.</p>

<p>'You are the first who has had the courage to demand that
question,' he responded.</p>

<p>'Or the bad taste,' apologized Denton.</p>

<p>Sir Roger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'The others were silent and stayed away, you speak and come,' he
said.</p>

<p>Denton was indignant for his friend.</p>

<p>'Why should they stay away? The lady is well enough.'</p>

<p>'She blights,' said Sir Roger decisively.</p>

<p>Denton wondered that such a mediocrity should have that
power&mdash;but it was what he had heard in London.</p>

<p>'A woman,' he replied, 'can keep in a woman's place&mdash;why
should she interfere with your friends?'</p>

<p>Sir Roger smiled again.</p>

<p>'She is so dull, she deadens, so stupid she frightens, so
unlovely she depresses.'</p>

<p>'And yet you married her!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I married her.'</p>

<p>'Why, Roger, why?'</p>

<p>'You wonder?'</p>

<p>'Who would not wonder, you who had everything, might have
married a Princess, you might have had the best of
life&mdash;instead&mdash;'</p>

<p>'This!' finished Sir Roger.</p>

<p>'There must be a reason.'</p>

<p>'You think so?'</p>

<p>'Assuredly.'</p>

<p>'Would you like to hear it?'</p>

<p>'Certainly&mdash;I came here to hear it,' smiled Denton.</p>

<p>Sir Roger for a while was silent; he was turning over the
incidents of his past as one turns the leaves of a long closed
book, with wonder and a little sadness at ancient things that once
meant so much and now mean so little.</p>

<p>'Is it worth while?' he asked at length.</p>

<p>He rested his elbows on the table and looked rather drearily at
his friend.</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'To tell you&mdash;to tell anyone how it happened,' replied Sir
Roger.</p>

<p>Denton looked with profound compassion at his lined face, his
bowed figure, his gray sprinkled hair, his careless dress.</p>

<p>And Brent looked with a dull envy at the neat elegance of his
friend, who, powdered, fashionable, alert, seemed indeed to come
from another world than that duty circle which comprised the life
of Brent Manor.</p>

<p>'Tell me,' said Denton quietly.</p>

<p>Sir Roger laughed.</p>

<p>'Tell you why I married Lily Walters?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>Sir Roger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Why not?' he answered.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes, still handsome but lustreless, towards the
log fire which flickered in the sculptured chimney place, and his
fine hands dropped and clasped slackly on the dark surface of the
sombre oak table, where stood the glasses and the fruit and the
bottles of old wine.</p>

<p>Then, like one who reads aloud slowly, and with a certain
difficulty, he began his strange relation.</p>

<p>'I greatly loved my life. I had everything to make existence
pleasant. Health, name, money&mdash;wits&mdash;you know what I had,
my friend.'</p>

<p>'Everything.'</p>

<p>'Everything. But I wished for more. I had a lust for knowledge,
for power, for experience&mdash;I wished to reach the limits of
every sensation.</p>

<p>'For me there was no wine powerful enough, no woman beautiful
enough, no gold bright enough&mdash;</p>

<p>'I wished to prove everything&mdash;to see everything&mdash;to
know everything.</p>

<p>'For five years I travelled from one country to another; I had
enough money to obtain all my desires.</p>

<p>'I had friends, lovers, horses, houses, ships, I travelled
sometimes in a coach and six, sometimes on foot, sometimes I lodged
in palaces, sometimes I slept in a ditch. I kissed princesses by
the light of a hundred candles, and peasant girls by the dewy light
of dawn, I stayed at the most dissolute courts in Italy, and I shut
myself for months in the austerity of a Spanish convent.</p>

<p>'I experienced poverty, luxury, every day I gained
knowledge.</p>

<p>'I practised in music, poetry, botany, medicine, painting,
sculpture, astronomy&mdash;I sat at the feet of wise men and drew
crude knowledge from the unlettered of all countries.</p>

<p>'Still I was not satisfied.</p>

<p>'My health remained vigorous and my mind restless.</p>

<p>'So far I had not found one woman whom I could not replace, one
friend whose company was a necessity, one art or science to which I
wished to devote my life.</p>

<p>'Then at The Hague I met a certain Doctor Strass, and under his
guidance I began to seriously study alchemy and occultism.</p>

<p>'In this I found at last something that absorbed my whole
being.</p>

<p>'Here was the love, the passion that should absorb my life.</p>

<p>'For three years I lived for nothing else. I resolved to find
the elixir of life.'</p>

<p>Denton moved back out of the candlelight, so that he might more
clearly see his friend's face, but Sir Roger was absolutely
grave.</p>

<p>He spoke as a man who, with quiet deliberation, relates sober
sense.</p>

<p>'The elixir of life,' he repeated. 'The magic powder that should
confer on me eternal youth and eternal enjoyment.'</p>

<p>'A strange whim,' said Denton quietly. 'You who had
everything.'</p>

<p>'I wished to keep everything,' responded Sir Roger, 'but more
than that even, I wished for power.'</p>

<p>'The last temptation of the Devil!' smiled his friend.</p>

<p>'I wished for power,' repeated Brent, 'but I cannot explain.
Enough that the thing took hold of me.</p>

<p>'I lived for that alone. Occult studies absorbed my time and
largely my fortune and my health.</p>

<p>'I seemed ever on the verge of a discovery; but I attained
nothing.'</p>

<p>He paused, and a bitter sadness darkened his sensitive face.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' he repeated. 'I but underlined the failures of
others, but repeated once more the tale of delusion and
disappointment.</p>

<p>'But in this I had more strength than some, in that I resolved
to cease the fruitless and perilous study that had fascinated my
entire soul.</p>

<p>'I determined to free myself from what was becoming an
incubus.</p>

<p>'I was frightened by the fate of others whom I saw as half mad,
half idiotic old men fumbling with their philtres and muttering
over their furnaces; in short, I vowed to free myself from what I
at last saw as but a net or device of the devil to draw me away
from a useful and enjoyable life.</p>

<p>'With this resolve strong within me I returned to England, and
my desire for the normal desires of my former life was increased by
the sight of familiar faces and sights.</p>

<p>'I made up my mind to enter politics, and was on the point of
taking steps in this direction, when an event occurred which again
altered everything.'</p>

<p>He paused and pressed the palms of his hands to his brows.
Denton was regarding him curiously.</p>

<p>'One day a sober-looking person came to see me. He seemed a
doctor or a lawyer of the better sort.</p>

<p>'He was not English; I took him to be a Dutchman or of the Low
German nationality&mdash;he was habited very neatly and very
precise in his speech.</p>

<p>'"I hear," said he without preamble, "that you have studied
alchemy."</p>

<p>'"For a while," said I, "but I have left that business."</p>

<p>'Whereat he smiled quietly and drew from his pocket a little box
of tortoiseshell like a gentleman's box for snuff, and opening it,
he drew out, wrapped in two foldings of scarlet silk, a piece of
stone the size of a walnut and the colour of amber. "This is what
you have been looking for," he said calmly; "this is what the
vulgar called the Philosopher's Stone."</p>

<p>'At these words all the blood went back on my heart, and I
begged for a portion with tears in my eyes.</p>

<p>'Whereupon he very comfortably took off a paring with his nail,
for the stone was soft like soap, and laid it in the palm of my
hand.</p>

<p>'And while I was yet too amazed to speak he left me.</p>

<p>'I had yet with me my retorts and crucibles, and that night I
very eagerly tested the portion of the stone on a piece of lead,
and when in the morning I poured it forth it was pure rich gold.
When this was set I took it round to the jeweller who worked for
the court, and asked him what it was, and he told me that it was
indeed gold of a finer quality than he had ever handled before.</p>

<p>'I was like a madman, for I had no means of finding my stranger,
but that day he came again, and without preamble asked me if I was
satisfied, and what I would do to possess the secret which, he
declared, had become indifferent to him, as he had passed on to
higher studies.</p>

<p>'And he told me about the wonders of this stone, how a few drops
of it dissolved in water, if allowed to stand, would leave great
rubies and pearls at the bottom, and if taken would confer youth
and beauty on him who drank.</p>

<p>'And presently he showed me this experiment, and we sat up all
night talking, and in the morning there were the jewels hard and
glistening in our hands.</p>

<p>'And then he propounded to me what he would have me
do&mdash;take some poor mean creature to wife, and with the elixir
make her into a goddess.'</p>

<p>Brent paused thoughtfully; Denton was still looking at him with
intent eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Roger continued:</p>

<p>'I was to marry her first, to show my trust. I was to present
her to the town, and afterwards transform her. The idea pleased me
beyond words; it was what no man had ever done before.</p>

<p>'I agreed.</p>

<p>'My stranger presented me to Lily Walters. I easily obtained the
consent of her family&mdash;in brief, I made a match that
confounded all my friends.</p>

<p>'My Dutchman was at the church, and afterwards presented me with
a packet, which he said contained the recipe for the famous
stone.</p>

<p>'Such was my impatience that I opened it in the coach ere we had
reached home.</p>

<p>'It was blank paper.</p>

<p>'I left my bride to run to the stranger's lodging, but he had
left.</p>

<p>'I never saw him again.'</p>

<p>Sir Roger ended abruptly and turned his straight gaze on his
friend's serious face.</p>

<p>'And that is why I married Lily Walters,' he concluded.</p>

<p>'And the rubies?' asked Denton, quietly.</p>

<p>'She wears them now and then, set in the gold I made with the
paring of stone.'</p>

<p>Denton was silent.</p>

<p>'I have searched Europe for that man,' continued Sir Roger
sullenly. 'I hope yet to kill him before I die.'</p>

<p>'You would be justified,' said Denton, easily. He rose and
crossed to the fire, still looking covertly and intently at his
friend.</p>

<p>Sir Roger muttered to himself a little, and presently fell
asleep with his head bowed on his heart.</p>

<p>Denton softly left the room.</p>

<p>He was startled to see Lady Brent waiting in the shadows of the
great hall.</p>

<p>'I don't think Sir Roger is very well,' said Denton,
quietly.</p>

<p>Her plain face quivered and her short-sighted eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>'I always wait up when there is anyone here,' she said simply.
'I never know what he will do.'</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>'He had a strange life before I married him,' continued Lady
Brent. 'He brought me a ruby necklace, and told me it had been made
by the Philosopher's Stone.'</p>

<p>'Those studies turn a man's brain,' said Denton.</p>

<p>'Oh!' answered Lady Brent in her thin ugly voice. 'Roger has
been mad a long time; no one knows the life I lead with him.'</p>

<h2><a name="story7" id="story7"></a>THE CONFESSION OF BEAU
SEKFORDE</h2>

<h3>Published as "The Housekeeper" in <i>Crimes of Old London</i>,
Odhams Ltd., London, 1919</h3>
<br>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center"><b>Holborn, 1710</b>
</p>

<p>Mr Robert Sekforde, a rather damaged man of fashion, entered,
with a lurching step, his mansion near the tavern of the Black
Bull, High Holborn. He was still known as 'Beau Sekforde', and was
still dressed in the extreme of the fashion of this year 1710, with
wide brocade skirts, an immense peruke, and a quantity of lace and
paste ornaments that were nearly as brilliant as diamonds.</p>

<p>About Mr Sekforde himself was a good deal of this spurious
gorgeousness; from a little distance he still looked the
magnificent man he once had been, but a closer view showed him
raddled with powder and rouge like a woman, heavy about the eyes
and jaw, livid in the cheeks; a handsome man yet, but one deeply
marked by years of idleness, good living, and the cheap
dissipations of a nature at once brutal and effeminate. In the
well-shaped features and dark eyes there was not a contour or a
shadow that did not help towards the presentment of a type vicious
and worthless; yet he had an air of breeding, of gallantry and
grace that had hitherto never failed to win him facile admiration
and help him over awkward places in his career. This air was also
spurious&mdash;spurious as the diamonds at his throat and in his
shoe-buckles; he was not even of gentle birth; the obscurity that
hung round his origin was proof of the shame he felt at the dismal
beginning of a career that had been so brilliant.</p>

<p>He entered his mansion, that was modest but elegant, and called
for candles to be brought into his study.</p>

<p>Taking off slowly his white, scented gloves, he stared
thoughtfully at his plump, smooth hands, and then at the walnut
desk scattered with silver and ebony stand dishes, pens and
taper-holders, and a great number of little notes on gilt-edged and
perfumed papers.</p>

<p>There were a great many others, neither gilt-edged nor perfumed;
Mr Sekforde knew that these last were bills as surely as he knew
the first were insipid invitations to rather third-rate balls and
routs.</p>

<p>Everything in Mr Sekforde's world was becoming rather third-rate
now.</p>

<p>He looked round the room desperately with that ugly glance of
defiance which is not courage but cowardice brought to bay.</p>

<p>Nothing in the house was paid for; and his credit would not last
much longer; this had been a last venture to float his shaky raft
on the waters of London Society; he could foresee himself going
very comfortably to the bottom.</p>

<p>Unless he could again carry off some successful 'coup' at cards;
and this was unlikely; he was too well-known now.</p>

<p>Every resource that could, at any pinch, afford means of
livelihood to an unscrupulous rogue and yet permit him to move
among the people on whom he preyed, had already been played by Mr
Sekforde.</p>

<p>The sound of the opening door caused him to look up; he dreaded
duns, and was not sure of the unpaid servants.</p>

<p>But it was his wife who entered; at the sight of her, Beau
Sekforde cursed in a fashion that would have surprised his genteel
admirers, over whose tea-tables he languished so prettily.</p>

<p>'Oh, pray, keep civil,' said the lady, in a mincing tone.</p>

<p>She trailed to the fireplace and looked discontentedly at the
logs that were falling into ashes.</p>

<p>'The upholsterer came,' she added, 'with a bill for near a
thousand guineas&mdash;I had difficulty in sending him away; is
nothing in the house paid for?'</p>

<p>'Nothing.'</p>

<p>She looked at him with a contempt that was more for herself than
for him; she was quite callous and heartless; a sense of humour, a
nice appreciation of men and things alone prevented her from being
odious.</p>

<p>'Lord!' she smiled. 'To live to be fooled by Beau Sekforde!'</p>

<p>She was a Countess in her own right; her patent was from Charles
II and explained her career; she still had the air of a beauty, and
wore the gowns usually affected by loveliness, but she was old with
the terrible old age of a wanton, soulless woman.</p>

<p>Her reputation was bad even for her type; she had cheated at
everything from love to cards, and no tenderness or regret had ever
softened her ugly actions. At the end of her career as presiding
goddess of a gambling saloon she had married Robert Sekforde,
thinking he had money or at least the wits to get it, and a little
betrayed by his glib tongue that had flattered her into thinking
her beauty not lost, her charm not dead, only to find him an
adventurer worse off than herself, who had not even paid for the
clothes in which he had come to woo her; her sole satisfaction was
that he had also been deceived.</p>

<p>He had thought her the prudent guardian of the spoils of a
lifetime; instead, selfishness had caused her to scatter what greed
had gained, and for her, too, this marriage had been seized as a
chance to avert ruin.</p>

<p>Haggard and painted, a dark wig on her head, false pearls round
her throat, and a dirty satin gown hanging gracefully round a
figure still upright and elegant, she stared at the fire.</p>

<p>'We shall have to disappear,' she remarked dryly.</p>

<p>He looked at her with eyes of hate.</p>

<p>'You must have some money,' he said bluntly.</p>

<p>Avarice, the vice of old age, flashed in her glance as jealousy
would have gleamed in that of a younger woman.</p>

<p>'What little I have I need,' she retorted. 'The man has turned
simple.' She grinned at her reflection in the glass above the
fireplace.</p>

<p>'Well, leave me, then,' he said bitterly; could he be rid of
her, he felt it would gild his misfortune.</p>

<p>But my lady had come to the end of all her admirers; she could
not even any longer dazzle boys with the wicked glory of her past;
she had no one save Mr Sekforde, and she meant to cling to him; he
was a man, and twenty years younger than herself; he ought, she
thought, to be useful.</p>

<p>Besides, this woman who had never had a friend of her own sex,
shuddered to think of the last loneliness it would be to live
without a man attached to her&mdash;little better the grave, and of
that she had all the horror of the true atheist.</p>

<p>'You talk folly,' she said with a dreadful ogle. 'I shall
remain.'</p>

<p>'Then you will starve, my lady!' he flung out violently.</p>

<p>'Oh, fie, sir, one does not starve.'</p>

<p>He could not endure to look at her, but staring at the desk
began to tear up the notes before him.</p>

<p>'Will you not go to a mask tonight?' she asked querulously.</p>

<p>'I have no money to pay for a chair,' he sneered.</p>

<p>'We might win something at cards.'</p>

<p>'People are very wary.'</p>

<p>'You were very clever at tricking me,' remarked the Countess,
'cannot you trick someone else, Mr Sekforde?'</p>

<p>He wheeled round on her with concentrated venom.</p>

<p>'Ah, madam, if I were a bachelor&mdash;'</p>

<p>She quailed a little before his wrath, but rallied to reply with
the spirit of the woman who had been spoilt by a king:</p>

<p>'You think you are so charming? Wealthy matches are particular.
<i>Look in the glass, sir; your face is as ruined as your
reputation</i>.'</p>

<p>He advanced on her and she began to shriek in a dreadful
fashion; the town woman showed through the airs of the great
lady.</p>

<p>'I'll call the watch!' she shrilled.</p>

<p>He fell back with a heavy step and stood glaring at her.</p>

<p>'A pair of fools,' said my lady bitterly.</p>

<p>Then her cynical humour triumphed over her disgust.</p>

<p>'Your first wife would smile to see us now,' she remarked.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde turned to her a face suddenly livid.</p>

<p>'What do you know about my first wife?' he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p>'Nothing at all,' replied my lady. 'You kept her rather in the
background, did you not? But one can guess.'</p>

<p>Mr Sekforde raged; he loathed any reference to the woman he had
married in his obscurity, and who had been his drudge in the
background through all his shifting fortunes; her worn face, her
wagging tongue, her rude manners, had combined to make the thorn in
the rose-bed of his softest days.</p>

<p>He had hated her, and believed that she had hated him; she was a
Scotchwoman, a shrew, thrifty, honest, plain, and a good
housekeeper; she had always made him very comfortable at home,
though she had shamed him on the rare occasions when she had forced
him to take her abroad.</p>

<p>She had died only a few months before his present marriage.</p>

<p>'One can guess,' repeated the Countess, showing teeth dark in a
ghastly grin behind rouged lips, 'that you made her life very
pleasant.'</p>

<p>He sprang up and faced her, a big, heavy bully for all his
satins and French peruke.</p>

<p>'Oh,' she shrilled, frightened but defiant, 'you look like
murder!'</p>

<p>He turned away sharply and muttered some hideous words under his
breath.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do?' asked my lady, with a quizzical gaze
round the tawdry splendour that had been hired to lure her into
marriage, and that now would be so shortly rent away.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde controlled his wrath against the terrible woman
who had deceived him into losing his last chance of retrieving
ruin.</p>

<p>'Where are the servants?' he asked.</p>

<p>'All gone. I think they have taken some of the plate and all the
wine. There is some food downstairs.'</p>

<p>Mr Sekforde had seen it as he came up; a hacked piece of fat ham
on a dirty dish, a stained cloth, and a jagged loaf had been laid
out on the dining-room table.</p>

<p>'I have had my dinner,' remarked the Countess.</p>

<p>Her husband rudely left the room; he was hungry and forced to
search for food, but the remembrance of the meal waiting nauseated
him; he was delicate in his habits, and as he descended the stairs
he thought of his late wife&mdash;she had been a wonderful
housekeeper&mdash;even in poverty she had never failed to secure
comfort.</p>

<p>As he opened the door of the dining-room he was agreeably
surprised.</p>

<p>Evidently one of the servants had remained after all.</p>

<p>The hearth had been swept and a neat fire burnt pleasantly; a
clean cloth was on the table, and the service was set out exactly;
a fresh loaf, butter, fruit, a dish of hot meat, of cheese, of eggs
stood ready; there was wine and brightly polished glasses.</p>

<p>'I did not know,' Mr Sekforde muttered, 'that any of the hussies
in this house could work like this.'</p>

<p>He admired the spotless linen, the brilliant china, the gleaming
glasses, the fresh and appetizing food, and ate and drank with a
pleasure that made him forget for the moment his troubles.</p>

<p>One thing only slightly disturbed his meal; among the dishes was
a plate of goblin scones; they were of a peculiar shape and taste,
and he had never known anyone make them but the late Jane
Sekforde.</p>

<p>When he had finished he rang the bell for candles, for the short
November day was closing in.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Surprised and slightly curious to see the servant who had been
so deft, Mr Sekforde went to the head of the basement stairs and
shouted lustily; still there was no reply.</p>

<p>He returned to the dining-room; the candles were lit and set
precisely on the table. Mr Sekforde ran upstairs to his wife.</p>

<p>'Who is in this house?' he asked in a tone of some
agitation.</p>

<p>The Countess was by the fire, seated on a low chair; before her
on the floor was a wheel of playing cards from which she was
telling her fortune.</p>

<p>'Who is in the house?' she sneered. 'A drunken ruffian.'</p>

<p>Misery was wearing thin the courtier-like manner from both of
them.</p>

<p>'You old, wicked jade,' he replied, 'there is someone hiding in
this house.'</p>

<p>She rose, scattering the cards with the worn toe of her little
satin shoe.</p>

<p>'There is no one in the house,' she said, 'not a baggage of them
all would stay. I am going out. I want lights and amusement. Your
house is too dull, Mr Sekforde.'</p>

<p>With this speech and an air that was a caricature of the graces
of a young and beautiful woman she swept out of the room.</p>

<p>Even her own maid, a disreputable Frenchwoman, had left her,
having moved out of the impending crash; but my lady had never
lacked spirit; she attired herself, put all the money she had in
her bosom, and left the house to pass the evening with one of her
cronies, who kept an establishment similar to that which she had
been forced to abandon.</p>

<p>Even the departure of her vindictive presence did not sweeten
for Beau Sekforde the house that was the temple of his failure.</p>

<p>He glared at the furniture that should have been paid for by
bills on his wife's fortune, and went to his chamber.</p>

<p>He, too, knew haunts, dark and gloomy, where health and money,
wits and time might be steadily consumed, and where one who was
bankrupt in all these things might be for the time tolerated if he
had a flattering and servile tongue and an appearance that lent
some dignity to mean vices and ignoble sins.</p>

<p>He found a fire in his bedchamber, the curtains drawn, his
cloak, evening rapier, and gloves put ready for him, the candles
lit on his dressing-table.</p>

<p>He dressed himself rather soberly and went downstairs.</p>

<p>The meal was cleared away in the dining-room, the fire covered,
the chairs put back in their places.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde swore.</p>

<p>'If I had not seen her fastened down in her coffin I should have
sworn that Jane was in this house,' he muttered, and his bloodshot
eyes winced a little from the gloom of the empty house.</p>

<p>Again he went to the head of the basement stairs and
listened.</p>

<p>He could hear faintly the sound of someone moving
about&mdash;the sound of dishes, of brisk footsteps, of clattering
irons.</p>

<p>'Some wench <i>has</i> remained,' he said uneasily, but he did
not offer to investigate those concealed kitchen premises.</p>

<p>That evening his companions found him changed&mdash;a quiet
sullen, dangerous mood was on him; they could easily understand
this, as tales of the disaster of his marriage had already leaked
abroad.</p>

<p>But something deeper and more terrible even than his almost
accomplished ruin was troubling Robert Sekforde.</p>

<p>He returned very late to the mansion in High Holborn; he had
drunk as much wine as his friends would pay for, and there was
little of the elegant gallant about the heavy figure in the stained
coat with wig awry, and the flushed, swollen face, who stumbled
into the wretched place he named home with unconscious sarcasm.</p>

<p>A light stood ready for him in the hall; he took this up and
staggered upstairs, spilling the candle-grease over his lace
ruffles.</p>

<p>Half-way up he paused, suddenly wondering who had thought to
leave the light.</p>

<p>'Not my lady wife&mdash;not my royal Countess,' he grinned.</p>

<p>Then a sudden pang of horror almost sobered him. Jane had never
forgotten to put a candle in the hall.</p>

<p>He paused, as if expecting to hear her shrill, nagging
voice.</p>

<p>'You're drunk,' he said to himself fiercely; 'she is dead, dead,
dead.'</p>

<p>He went upstairs.</p>

<p>The fire in his room was bright, the bed stood ready, his
slippers and bedgown were warming, a cup of posset stood steaming
on the side-table.</p>

<p>Mr Sekforde snatched up his candle and hurried to the room of
the Countess.</p>

<p>He violently entered and stood confronting her great bed with
the red damask hangings.</p>

<p>With a shriek she sat up; her cheeks were still rouged, the
false pearls dangled in her ears, the laced gown was open on her
skinny throat; a cap with pink ribbons concealed her scant grey
hair.</p>

<p>She flung herself with claw-like hands on an embroidered purse
on the quilt, and thrust it under her pillow; it contained her
night's winnings at cards.</p>

<p>'Have you come to rob me?' she screamed.</p>

<p>Terror robbed her of all dignity; she crouched in the shadows of
the huge bed, away from the red light cast on her dreadful face by
the candle her husband held.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde was not thinking of money now, and her words
passed unheeded.</p>

<p>'Who is in this house?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'You are mad,' she said, a little recovering her composure, but
keeping her hands very firmly on the purse beneath the pillow;
'there is no one in this house.'</p>

<p>'Did <i>you</i> put a candle for me and prepare my room and
light the fire and place the posset?'</p>

<p>He spoke thickly and leant against the bedpost; the candle, now
almost guttered away, sent a spill of grease on the heavy
quilt.</p>

<p>'You are drunk, you monstrous man!' screamed my lady. 'If you
are not away instantly I'll put my head out of the window and
screech the neighbourhood up!'</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde, regarding her with dull eyes, remained at his
original point.</p>

<p>'There was someone in the kitchen this afternoon,' he insisted.
'I heard sounds&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Rats,' said my lady; 'the house is full of 'em.'</p>

<p>A look of relief passed over the man's sodden features.</p>

<p>'Of course, rats,' he muttered.</p>

<p>'What else could it be?' asked the Countess, sufficiently
impressed by his strange manner momentarily to forget her grievance
against him.</p>

<p>'What else?' he repeated; then suddenly turned on her with fury,
lurching the candle into her face.</p>

<p>'Could rats have sent this for me?' he shouted.</p>

<p>The Countess shrank back; when agitated her head trembled with
incipient palsy, and now it trembled so that the false pearls
rattled hollow against her bony neck.</p>

<p>'You will fire the bed-curtains!' she shrilled desperately.</p>

<p>He trembled with a loathing of her that was like a panic fear of
fury.</p>

<p>'You time-foundered creature!' he cried. 'You bitter horror! And
'twas for <i>you</i> I did it!'</p>

<p>She sprang to her knees in the bed, her hands crooked as if
ready for his face; there was nothing left now of the fine dame
nurtured in courts, the beauty nursed in the laps of princes. She
had reverted to the wench of Drury Lane, screaming abuse from alley
to alley.</p>

<p>'If you are disappointed, what about me?' she shrieked. 'Have I
not tied myself to a low, ugly fool?'</p>

<p>He stepped back from her as if he did not understand her, and,
muttering, staggered back into his own room.</p>

<p>There he lit all the candles, piled up the fire with more fuel,
glanced with horror at the bed, flung off his coat and wig, and
settled himself in the chair with arms before the fire to
sleep.</p>

<p>The Countess, roused and angered, could sleep no more.</p>

<p>She rose, flung on a chamber-robe of yellow satin lined with
marten's fur, that was a relic of her court days and threadbare and
moth-eaten in places, though giving the effect of much
splendour.</p>

<p>Without striking a light she went cautiously out into the
corridor, saw the door of her husband's room ajar, a bright glow
from it failing across the darkness, and crept steadily in.</p>

<p>He was, as she had supposed, in an intoxicated stupor of sleep
by the fire.</p>

<p>His head had sunk forward on the stained and untied lace cravat
on his breast; his wigless head showed fat and shaven and grey over
the temples; his face was a dull purple, and his mouth hung
open.</p>

<p>His great frame was almost as loose as that of a man newly dead,
his hands hung slack, and his chest heaved with his noisy
breathing. My lady was herself a horrid object, but that did not
prevent her giving him a glance of genuine disgust.</p>

<p>'Beau Sekforde indeed!' she muttered.</p>

<p>She put out all the candles save two on the dressing-table,
found the coat her husband had flung off, and began going swiftly
through the pockets.</p>

<p>He had been, as she had hoped, fortunate at cards that night; he
was indeed, like herself, of a type who seldom was unfortunate,
since he only played with fools or honest men, neither of whom had
any chance against the peculiar talents of the sharper.</p>

<p>The Countess found sundry pieces of gold and silver, which she
knotted up in her handkerchief with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>She knew that nothing but money would ever be able to be of any
service to her in this world.</p>

<p>Pleased with her success, she looked round to see if there were
anything else of which she could despoil her husband.</p>

<p>Keeping her cunning old eyes constantly on him, she crept to the
dressing-table and went over the drawers and boxes.</p>

<p>Most of the ornaments that she turned out glittered and gleamed
heavily in the candlelight. But she knew that they were as false as
the pearls trembling in her own ears; one or two things, however,
she added to the money in the handkerchief, and she was about to
investigate further when a little sound, like a cough, caused her
to look sharply round.</p>

<p>The room was full of warm shadows, the fire was sinking low and
only cast a dim light on the heavy, sleeping figure on the hearth,
while the candlesticks on the dressing-table served only to
illuminate the bent figure of the Countess in her brilliant
wrap.</p>

<p>As she looked round she found herself staring straight at the
figure of a woman, who was observing her from the other side of the
bed.</p>

<p>This woman was dressed in a grey tabinet fashioned like the
dress of an upper servant. Her hair was smoothly banded, and her
features were pale and sharp; her hands, that she held rather
awkwardly in front of her, were rough and work-worn.</p>

<p>Across one cheek was a long scratch.</p>

<p>The Countess dropped her spoils; she remembered her husband's
words that she had taken for the babbling of a drunkard.</p>

<p>So there <i>was</i> someone in the house.</p>

<p>'How dare you?' she quavered, and in a low tone, for she did not
wish to rouse her husband. 'How dare you come here?'</p>

<p>Without replying, the woman moved across to the sleeping man and
looked down at him with an extraordinary expression of mingled
malice and protection, as if she would defend him from any evil
save that she chose to deal herself.</p>

<p>So sinister was this expression and the woman's whole attitude
that the Countess was frightened as she never had been in the
course of her wicked life.</p>

<p>She stood staring; the handkerchief, full of money and
ornaments, dropped on the dressing-table unheeded.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde moved in his sleep and fetched a deep groan.</p>

<p>'You impertinent creature!' whispered the Countess, taking
courage. 'Will you not go before I wake my husband?'</p>

<p>At these last words the woman raised her head; she did not seem
to speak, yet, as if there were an echo in the room, the Countess
distinctly heard the words 'My husband!' repeated after her in a
tone of bitter mockery.</p>

<p>A sense of unreality such as she had never known before touched
the Countess; she felt as if her sight were growing dim and her
hearing failing her; she made a movement as if to brush something
from before her eyes.</p>

<p>When she looked again at Beau Sekforde he was alone; no one was
beside him.</p>

<p>In dreaming, tortured sleep he groaned and tossed.</p>

<p>'The baggage has slipped off,' muttered the Countess; 'belike it
is some ancient dear of his own. I will send her packing in the
morning.'</p>

<p>She crept back to her own room, forgetting her spoils.</p>

<p>She did not sleep, and Mr Sekforde did not wake till the pale
winter dawn showed between the curtains.</p>

<p>The Countess looked round on a chamber in disorder, but for Beau
Sekforde everything was arranged, shaving water ready, his
breakfast hot and tempting on a tray, his clothes laid out.</p>

<p>When he had dressed and come downstairs he found his wife
yawning over a copy of the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>She remembered last night quite clearly, and considerably
regretted what she had in her confusion left behind in Beau
Sekford's room.</p>

<p>She gave him a glance, vicious with the sense of an opportunity
lost.</p>

<p>He flung at her the question he had shouted last night:</p>

<p>'Who is in this house?'</p>

<p>'Some woman has stayed,' she answered. 'I think it was Joanna
the housekeeper, but I did not see very clearly. She must be out
now, as I have rung the bell and there has been no answer.'</p>

<p>'My breakfast was brought up to me,' said Mr Sekforde. 'So it is
Joanna Mills, is it?'</p>

<p>The Countess was angry; she had had to go to the kitchen and
pick among yesterday's scraps for her own food.</p>

<p>'And who is she?'</p>

<p>'You said, madam, the housekeeper.'</p>

<p>'She must be very fond of you,' sneered my lady.</p>

<p>He started at that and turned on her with a ghastly look.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't think I am jealous!' she grinned cynically.</p>

<p>'It was the word you used,' he muttered. 'I do not think anyone
has been <i>fond</i> of me save one&mdash;'</p>

<p>He paused and passed his hand over his weary, heavy eyes.</p>

<p>'I dreamt of her last night.'</p>

<p>'Who?''</p>

<p>'Jane, my wife.'</p>

<p>The Countess remembered the ugly echo of her words last
night.</p>

<p>'Your wife&mdash;do you forget that I and no other am your
wife?'</p>

<p>'I do,' he replied sullenly; 'to me, Jane is always my
wife.'</p>

<p>'A pity,' said my lady sarcastically, 'that she did not live
longer.'</p>

<p>He gave her a queer look.</p>

<p>'And now we have got to think of ourselves,' he said abruptly.
'I cannot keep these things much longer&mdash;you had better
go.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'What do I care?' he answered cruelly.</p>

<p>'I stay here,' she replied. 'Is the rent paid?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Well, they will not disturb us till quarter-day,' said my lady
calmly. 'You do not want to be parted from your loving wife, do
you, dear?'</p>

<p>He stared at her as if her words had a double meaning.</p>

<p>'Cannot you be quiet about my wife?' he exclaimed.</p>

<p>'La! The man is off his head!' shrilled my lady. 'Jane Sekforde
is dead!'</p>

<p>'That is why I think about her,' he retorted grimly.</p>

<p>'A model husband,' jeered the Countess, eyeing him viciously. 'I
am sorry I never knew the sweet creature you regret so keenly and
so touchingly.'</p>

<p>He raged at her like a man whose nerves are overwrought.</p>

<p>'Will you not let the matter be? Think of yourself, you
monstrous horror! You will soon be in the Fleet!'</p>

<p>This picture was sufficiently realistic to make the Countess
shiver.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do?' she asked with sudden
feebleness.</p>

<p>He did not know; brooding and black-browed, he withdrew to the
window-place and stared out at the leaden November sky that hung so
heavily over the London streets.</p>

<p>'I suppose if you were free of me you would take your handsome
face to market again?' added my lady, with a sudden lash of new
fury.</p>

<p>He gave her a red look, at which she shrank away.</p>

<p>'Well, still we do not decide on anything,' she quavered.</p>

<p>He would not answer her, but flung out of the house.</p>

<p>His unsteady steps were directed to St Andrew's Church.</p>

<p>It was a long time since Beau Sekforde had been near a
church.</p>

<p>Even when his wife had been buried here he had not attended the
service.</p>

<p>He stood now in the porch, biting his thumb; then presently he
entered.</p>

<p>Hesitating and furtive he went round the walls until he came to
the new, cheap tablet with the badly-cut, draped urn and the florid
Latin setting forth the virtues of Jane Sekforde.</p>

<p>'They don't say anything about her being a good housekeeper,' he
found himself saying aloud. 'Why, she told me once she would come
back from the grave to set her house in order.'</p>

<p>He looked round as if to seek the answer of some companion, then
laughed sullenly, drew his hat over his eyes, and left the
church.</p>

<p>Towards dusk he wandered home.</p>

<p>The dining-room was neat and clean, the fire attended to, the
dinner on the table. He managed to eat some of the food, but
without appetite. The Countess was out; there was no trace anywhere
of her slovenly splendour.</p>

<p>The whole house was as clean and precise as it had been when
that neglected drudge, Jane Sekforde, had ruled over it.</p>

<p>When the Countess returned he was almost glad to see
her&mdash;he had been thinking so much, too much, of Jane.</p>

<p>He had thought of her as he had seen her last, cold in her bed,
clothed in her best grey gown, and how he had stared at her and
hung over her and drawn suddenly away, so sharply that the button
of cut steel on his cuff had left a scratch on her dead cheek.</p>

<p>'Where is Joanna Mills?' he abruptly asked his wife.</p>

<p>She stared at him; in such a moment as this could he think of
nothing but the housekeeper? Was he losing his wits?</p>

<p>But she did not now much care; she had found a crony willing to
shelter her and exploit her ancient glories.</p>

<p>'I am going away,' she said. 'I do not know who is in the
house&mdash;I have seen no one.'</p>

<p>He seemed to pay no attention at all to her first remark.</p>

<p>'What was that woman you saw last night like?'</p>

<p>'A very plain, shrewish-looking creature,' replied my lady, with
some bitterness, as she recalled how she had been startled into
dropping the filched money.</p>

<p>'Are you sure it was a woman?' asked Beau Sekforde, with a
ghastly grin.</p>

<p>'Why, what else could it have been?' she replied curiously.</p>

<p>'I do not think it has been a woman for&mdash;some months,' he
said.</p>

<p>'Why, do you imagine there is a spectre in the place?'</p>

<p>He would not, could not, answer; he left her, and went from room
to room throwing everything into disorder, taking a horrid pleasure
in making a confusion in the neatness of the house.</p>

<p>And then he flung himself away from the dreary mansion, leaving
the Countess, like an old, weary bird of prey, wandering among the
untidy rooms to see if there were anything worth taking away.</p>

<p>When he returned in the dark hours before the dawn he found the
candle on the hall-table.</p>

<p>'Curse you!' he screamed. 'Cannot you let me alone?'</p>

<p>He hastened upstairs; everything was neat, his bed, his fire,
his posset ready, his shoes warming, his candles lit.</p>

<p>His terrified eyes cast a horrid glance round the room.</p>

<p>'The medicine cupboard&mdash;has she tidied that?' he
muttered.</p>

<p>He crossed to where it hung in one comer, opened the door, and
looked at the rows of pots and bottles.</p>

<p>One he knew well had been stained&mdash;had been left with a
broken stopper...a bottle of peculiar, ugly look, holding a yellow
liquid that stained linen purple.</p>

<p>Such a stain, very tiny, had been on Jane Sekforde's pillow.</p>

<p>As he stared into the cupboard he saw that the bottle had been
cleaned and set in its place, while a new, neat label had been
pasted on the front.</p>

<p>The writing was the writing of Jane Sekforde&mdash;it said in
clear letters: 'Poison'.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde dropped the candle and ran into the Countess's
room.</p>

<p>'Wake up!' he shouted. 'Wake up and hear me! She has come back.
I want to confess. I murdered her! Let them take me
away&mdash;somewhere where&mdash;where she cannot tidy for me.'</p>

<p>The room was empty; the Countess had fled; an unnatural light
came from the unshuttered windows and showed a woman sitting up in
the great bed.</p>

<p>She had a pale, shrewish face, wore a grey garment, and had a
scratch across her cheek.</p>

<p>As the shrieks of Beau Sekforde's confession echoed into the
night and drew the watch to thunder on the door, the woman
smiled.</p>

<h2><a id="story8" name="story8">THE FOLDING DOORS</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i>, Dec 1912</h3>

<p class="first">A YOUNG MAN was coming slowly down the wide
staircase of a palace in the Rue de Vaugirard. It was, by the new
reckoning, the 13th of Brumaire; evening, and cold, moonlit, and
clear; these things being the same by any reckoning, as the young
man thought, pausing by the tall window on the landing-place that
looked out on to the blue-shadowed, silent street.</p>

<p>There was a ball overhead in the great state rooms, and he could
hear the music, violins, flutes and harpsichord, distinctly, though
he had closed the door behind him. He was one of the guests, and
had the watchful, furtive air of one who has stolen away
unperceived, and fears that he may be discovered. He seemed now to
have stopped with an idea of ascertaining if anyone was abroad, for
he leant over the smooth gilt banisters and listened. The great
staircase was empty, and empty the vast hall below.</p>

<p>Opposite the landing window was a long mirror, with three
branched candles before it. The young man turned to this quickly
and noiselessly, and pulled from the pocket of his coat a strip of
gilt-edged paper, folded tightly. He unrolled this and read the
message it contained, written in a light pencil.</p>

<p>"At half-past ten knock four times on the folding doors. <i>Do
not be late; every moment is one of terror. I am afraid of
HIM</i>."</p>

<p>The last two sentences were underlined, the last word twice.</p>

<p>The young man looked up and down the stairs, twisted the paper
up, and was about to thrust it into the flame of one of the
candles, when he caught sight of himself in the tall mirror, and
stood staring at the image with the paper held out in his hand.</p>

<p>He saw a figure that to his thinking was that of a mountebank,
for it had once been that of the Due de Jaurès&mdash;Citizen Jaurès
now&mdash;courtier of his one-time Christian Majesty Louis XVI.,
beheaded recently as Louis Capet in the great square now called by
the people the Place de la Revolution.</p>

<p>The People had altered everything, even the person of M. de
Jaurès, who wore the classic mode beloved of liberty&mdash;the
fashion of this year one of freedom, hair <i>à la</i> Titus and a
black stock swathing the chin. His face was without colour, the
black, hollow eyes and black hair accentuating this pallor; his
countenance, though sombre in expression, was beautiful by reason
of the exquisite lines of the mouth and nostrils, and something
elevated and noble in the turn of the head. As he stared at himself
a slow flush of terrible shame overspread his paleness; with
something like a suppressed shudder, he gave the paper to the
flame, and scattered the ashes down the stairs.</p>

<p>Then he pulled out the watch hanging from the black watered-silk
fob.</p>

<p>It wanted ten minutes to half-past ten. The dance music ceased
overhead; in its place came laughter, loud talking, and presently a
woman singing in a rapt and excited fashion.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Jaurès paced to and fro on the landing. He loathed
these people he mixed with, so like him in dress and appearance,
but <i>bourgeois</i> and <i>canaille</i> all of them; some butchers
of the Terror, some smug deputies, some one-time servants, some
soldiers, some dancers from the opera, some provincials and their
wives&mdash;all, by the grace of the People, free and equal.</p>

<p>The Citizen de Jaurès, aristocrat by virtue of birth, tradition,
temper, and qualities, bit his under-lip fiercely to hear these
people rioting in this house. The late owner, his once dear friend,
had been massacred in the prison of La Force a month ago, and the
house now belonged to a deputy from Lyons, married to the daughter
of a nobleman long since sent to the guillotine.</p>

<p>The note that M. de Jaurès had burnt was from this lady. They
had known each other before the rule of chaos, and when the
revolution brought him out of the prison, where he had been
consigned for a political offence by the late King's ministers, and
he had found her, terror-subdued, mistress of a revolutionary
salon, the similarity between their positions, the common memories
of another world, the sense of kinship amidst a society so alien,
so monstrous, so hideous, had grown into a sad but strong love.</p>

<p>She was spared because she had married one of the tyrants, and
pretended to forget her father's murder; he, because he had been a
prisoner of the King, and affected to subscribe to the new rule of
the people. Both had tasted of shame, and together they sought to
redeem themselves.</p>

<p>Fired by their mutual sympathy, the horror of what they daily
saw round them, the desire to redeem their acquiescence in the
overthrow of their order, to redeem, at the risk of death, the
lives they should never have consented to save, they had been the
instigators of one of the many desperate plots against the
Government, the object of which was to rescue the Austrian Queen
from the Temple and the ultimate guillotine.</p>

<p>To-night the intrigue, evolved with skill and secrecy, and
materially helped by the knowledge Hortense was enabled to obtain
through her husband's position, was to be put into execution, and
they were either to fly across the frontier with the rescued Queen,
or to give up life together, as aristocrats, upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès, on the threshold of this hazard, felt that chill
suspension of all the faculties which fills that waiting pause
before the plunge into great actions. He was conscious of neither
exaltation nor despair, but of a strange sense that time had
stopped, or had never been, and that all the events which so
oppressed his brain were but pictures, that would clear away and
reveal at last&mdash;reality.</p>

<p>The dance music began again; the noisy music of the People, with
its distinct rise and fall. He and Hortense had been present at the
opera the night they had played <i>Richard Coeur de Lion</i> and
the audience had risen in a frenzy of devotion at the strains of
"<i>O Richard, O mon roi</i>."</p>

<p>He recalled the Queen with her children, worshipped and very
stately, and Hortense with powdered hair and a hoop festooned with
roses; then he thought of the wretched captive in the Temple, and
the haggard woman in a Greek gown with a fillet through her flowing
hair, waiting for him downstairs behind the folding doors.</p>

<p>Pacing to and fro, facing now the cold street and bitter night,
now his own reflection in the glass, the inner agony of suspense,
regret, remorse, broke through the dazed control of his overwrought
passions. He gave a little sound, caught into the whirl of the
dance music unheard, and stepped back sideways against the gleaming
white wall, his hand instinctively to his heart.</p>

<p>The next second he was master of himself, and wondering wildly
what had caused him that sudden utter pang of terror, a terror
beyond fear of death or any definition, awful, hideous. He
listened, as men will in great dread, and heard what seemed a
curious short cry, like the echo of his own, that rose above the
dance-beat. He thought it came from the street, and softly opened
the window.</p>

<p>Everything was still, but in the distance, where the moonlight
fell between two houses, three of the Republican soldiers were
dragging a man along, and a girl in a blue gown was following,
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>A second, and the little group had passed out of sight. M. de
Jaurès closed the window, feeling strangely relieved that his
emotion had been caused by such a common thing as the cry of a poor
creature following a suspect to the Abbaye. He must, unconsciously,
have heard her cry before, and this had given him that sensation of
terror.</p>

<p>The dance music fell to a softer measure; a clock struck the
half-hour, and Camille de Jaurès descended to the salon on the next
floor.</p>

<p>He entered softly, yet confident of being neither interrupted
nor observed.</p>

<p>The room was large, with great windows looking on to the street.
It had once been painted with flowers, and shepherds asleep with
their flocks, and nymphs seated beside fountains, but had lately
been painted white from floor to ceiling by a Republican who
detested these remnants of aristocracy. White, with stiff wreaths
of classic laurel, candles in plain sconces shaded with dead-hued
silk, straight grey curtains before the windows, and very little
furniture to cumber the polished floor and that little, simple,
bare-legged, and comprising a couch of Grecian shape, covered with
striped brocade, such as ladies, dressed in the fashions of the
year one of liberty, loved to recline on.</p>

<p>A cold, bare room, with a glimmer from the shaded light like the
moon-glow, and with no colour, nor gleam, nor brightness. The wall
that faced the window was almost entirely occupied by high, white
folding doors with crystal knobs. M. de Jaurès' glance fell at once
on these; they led to the private apartments of Hortense, and
through them, by the back way across the garden, they were to
escape to-night. He advanced, and was about to knock, when one leaf
was opened sharply in his face, and a man stepped out.</p>

<p>It was Citizen Durosoy, husband of Hortense. M. de Jaurès
stepped back; he saw that the room beyond the folding doors was
dark, but close where the light penetrated he noticed a fold of
soft satin with a pearl border, and an empty white shoe softly
rounded to the shape of a foot, lying sideways, as if it had just
been taken off. Hortense was there, then, he knew, waiting for him.
He straightened himself to meet the unlooked-for interruption.</p>

<p>He was quite composed as Durosoy closed the doors.</p>

<p>"Your room upstairs is very close," he said, "and I suppose I am
not in a festival mood&mdash;it is pleasantly cool here."</p>

<p>"Cool!" echoed the Deputy of Lyons. "It seems to me cold," he
laughed. "Perhaps it is the singing of La Marguerite, which is so
bad for the nerves, for my wife has a headache, and must lie down
in the dark."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès smiled. He felt such a contempt for this man that
it put him absolutely at his ease. The Deputy had been a poor
provincial lawyer, to whom the late de Jaurès had been kind. He
affected to remember this now, and was warmly friendly, even
patronising, to his old patron's son. The aristocrat hated him
doubly for it, scorned him that no echo of this hatred seemed ever
to awake in his mind; for the Deputy was almost familiar in his
manner to M. de Jaurès. He was quiet and modest with everybody.</p>

<p>"I hope my wife is not delicate," he said with an air of
anxiety. "I have thought lately that she was in ill-health."</p>

<p>"I have not noticed it," answered the other.</p>

<p>He seated himself on the striped couch, and looked carelessly at
the grate, where a pale fire burnt. The Deputy crossed to the
hearth, and stood looking at his guest with an amiable smile. He
was a slight man, brown-haired and well looking, but of a common
appearance. He wore a grey cloth coat, with a black sash up under
his armpits, and white breeches. This dress, and the stiff, long
straggling locks that fell on to his bullion-stitched collar, gave
him an appearance of anarchy and wildness not in keeping with his
pleasant countenance.</p>

<p>He stood so long smiling at M. de Jaurès, that a feeling of
impatience came over the nobleman. He glanced at the pendule clock
on the mantelpiece, and wondered how long the fool would stay.</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate that you and the Citizeness should both be
absent at once," he remarked. He had still the tone of an
aristocrat when speaking to Durosoy.</p>

<p>The Deputy held out his right hand.</p>

<p>"I cut my finger with a fruit knife," he answered, "and came
down to Hortense to tie it up; but she seemed so to wish to be
alone I did not like to press her; her head hurt so, she said."</p>

<p>A handkerchief was twisted about his hand, and he began to
unwind it as he spoke. "Now you are here," he added, "perhaps you
could help me tie it up; it really is bleeding damnably."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès rose slowly. He let his glance rest for a moment on
the folding doors. It was as if he could see Hortense standing at
the other side in the dark, listening, waiting for her husband to
go.</p>

<p>Durosoy held up his bare hand. There was a deep cut on the
forefinger, and the blood was running down the palm and staining
the close frill of muslin at his wrist.</p>

<p>"A severe wound for a silver knife," remarked M. de Jaurès,
taking him by the wrist.</p>

<p>"A steel knife," said the Deputy&mdash;"steel as sharp as La
Guillotine&mdash;you see, <i>mon ami</i>," and he smiled, "what
comes of trying to cut a peach with a steel knife."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès slowly tore his own handkerchief into strips and
carefully bound up the wound. He was wondering the while if
Hortense had been delayed by the unexpected visit of her husband;
if she was venturing to change her clothes before he finally
returned to their guests. By the white shoe he had seen through the
folding doors, he thought she had done so.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Camille," said the Deputy. He had a trick of using
Christian names, odious to M. de Jaurès. "It is astonishing how
faint the loss of a little blood makes one."</p>

<p>"This from our modern Brutus!" exclaimed M. de Jaurès. That term
had been given once, in the Convention, to the Deputy, and the man
whose dupe he was dared to quote it ironically, knowing the
stupidity of the provincial. As he had expected, the Deputy seemed
pleased; he shrugged modestly.</p>

<p>"Oh, one's own blood, you know, not that of other people. I can
endure the loss of <i>that</i> with great equanimity." He smiled,
as if he had made a joke, and the aristocrat smiled too, for other
reasons. "Will you drink with me&mdash;down here? It is, as you
say, very close upstairs."</p>

<p>"I fear to detain you, Citizen."</p>

<p>Durosoy rang the bell, then seated himself by the fire.</p>

<p>"No, I am tired of their chatter. I would rather talk with a
sensible man like yourself, my dear Camille."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès did not move from his easy attitude on the brocade
couch.</p>

<p>"But we shall disturb the Citizeness," he said. His idea was
that if he could make Durosoy leave with him, he could, more or
less easily, get rid of him upstairs and return.</p>

<p>The Deputy smiled. "Hortense is not so ill. Besides, the doors
are thick enough."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès wondered&mdash;how thick? Could she hear their
talk? Would she understand the delay? His straining ears could
catch no sound of her movements.</p>

<p>The Deputy continued in a kind of fatuous self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I hope she will be well enough to return soon to the ball. When
one has a beautiful wife one likes to show her off."</p>

<p>He paused, put his head on one side, and added:</p>

<p>"You do think her beautiful, do you not, Camille?"</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès looked at him coldly. He felt he could afford to
despise this man, since in a few moments he and she would be riding
away from his house for ever.</p>

<p>"Naturally, Citizen."</p>

<p>A citizen servant entered, and the Deputy ordered wine.</p>

<p>"I must not stay," said M. de Jaurès. He raised his voice a
little that she might hear. "One glass, and I will go back to make
my <i>adieux</i>."</p>

<p>Durosoy appeared mildly surprised.</p>

<p>"So early! You cannot have any business this time of night."</p>

<p>The wine was brought in and placed on a thin-legged table by the
hearth. M. de Jaurès glanced at the clock. The hand was creeping on
towards eleven. His contempt of the Deputy was beginning to change
to an impatient hatred of the creature's very presence.</p>

<p>"A matter of mood, not of time," he answered. "I am in no
merry-making vein to-night."</p>

<p>The Deputy, pouring out wine, looked at him critically.</p>

<p>"You are too lazy, my friend. You do nothing from one day's end
to another&mdash;naturally you are wearied. And it is dangerous,
too."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès took the glass offered him. "How dangerous?"</p>

<p>Durosoy lifted his common brown eyes. "Those who will not serve
the Republic are apt to be considered her enemies."</p>

<p>The young noble smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, I am a very good friend to France, but I lack
the qualities to be of any use."</p>

<p>He sipped his wine, and looked indifferently past the Deputy at
the folding doors. His thoughts were: 'The time is getting on. How
long will a carriage take from here to the <i>rue du Temple</i>?
Half an hour, allowing for the pace we must go and the crowd coming
out of the opera.'</p>

<p>"No use!" exclaimed the Deputy. "Why, you are a soldier, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;that seems a long time ago."</p>

<p>Durosoy laughed and poured out more wine. The tinkling of the
glass on the silver stand had the same thin quality as his
voice.</p>

<p>"There is always Toulon," he said. "The Royalists there are
giving us a good deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"I do not fancy going there to be hewn down by a lot of rascals.
I leave that to braver men," smiled de Jaurès lazily; but his blood
leapt with the desire to be with these same Royalists in Toulon,
with his sword drawn against such as this Deputy, whose wine seemed
to scorch and choke to-night. When would the man go? The carriage
that was waiting at the back might be noticed. The servant in the
plot would begin to wonder at the delay; and she, could she hear?
She must be undergoing torture&mdash;as he was.</p>

<p>"Then there is the revolt in Caen," said the Deputy; "we want
good men there."</p>

<p>"I've no fancy to go soldiering."</p>

<p>"You are dull to-night, Citizen. Does the business of the Widow
Capet interest you? It is to come on this month."</p>

<p>"Ah! The trial?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I heard something of it. No, I am not interested."</p>

<p>When would this babbling cease? Ten minutes past eleven, and the
rendezvous in the <i>rue du Temple</i> at twelve.</p>

<p>"Not interested?" echoed the Deputy. "Now if I might hazard a
guess, my friend, I should say that you were rather too
interested."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;too interested?" he asked in accents painfully
calm.</p>

<p>"I do not think you would like the Widow Capet to take the same
journey to the Place de la Révolution as her husband did."</p>

<p>"Why should I trouble?" answered M. de Jaurès, who for one
instant had thought himself suspected. He drew his breath a little
unevenly; the delay, the suspense, were beginning to tell on him,
were becoming serious, too. He remembered that the hour had been
altered at the last moment from one to twelve, and that he had had
no opportunity of telling Hortense so. They had to be so careful,
there had been so few chances for them to meet at all. Hortense
would think they had an hour longer than was the case.</p>

<p>The Deputy was taking his third glass; he seemed to be settled
comfortably in his chair. It appeared as if he might maunder on
with his idle talk for another hour; and the delay of another hour
would be fatal to M. de Jaurès.</p>

<p>"It must seem very strange to you," said the Deputy
reflectively, "this year one of liberty."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès sat forward on the couch. Durosoy had never taken
this tone of gravity with him before.</p>

<p>"No stranger to me than to you," he answered. He finished the
wine, and set the glass back on the table.</p>

<p>"Well, then, strange to me and to you."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès laughed; he could not control himself.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" he asked. The Deputy shrugged.</p>

<p>"The thought will occur&mdash;sitting here in this palace that I
used to pass with awe&mdash;talking to you whom I used to regard
with awe&mdash;married to Hortense! Yes, you are right, it is
strange to me."</p>

<p>The noble's mouth tightened; a black shame overwhelmed him that
he was sitting here listening to this man.</p>

<p>"You," continued the Deputy, "used to know the former owner of
this house, did you not?"</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès rose.</p>

<p>"I knew him."</p>

<p>"He was killed at La Force, was he not?"</p>

<p>"I believe so; why do you recall him?" M. de Jaurès leant
against the mantelpiece. The cold, white room, the inane Deputy,
were fast becoming intolerable. He began to be hideously conscious
of two things: the clock whose hands were coming round slowly to
the half-hour, and the folding doors behind which Hortense waited.
The interruption, of which he had thought nothing at first, was
like to prove fatal. Could he do it in less than half an hour?
Merciful God! it was not possible! Some of them were already at the
rendezvous&mdash;the Queen was ready.</p>

<p>"Let us go back upstairs," he said. "It is, after all, rather
doleful here."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am very comfortable," smiled the Deputy,
crossing his legs.</p>

<p>"You will be missed," said M. de Jaurès. His thoughts were
racing furiously. How could he convey to Hortense that the time had
been altered&mdash;that he could not wait?</p>

<p>The Deputy nodded towards the high ceiling. "Missed? You hear
the music? I think they are enjoying themselves."</p>

<p>To abandon her, or to miss the appointment in the <i>rue du
Temple</i>; to break faith with his friends or with her, to lose
all chance of redemption, to jeopardise the Queen's escape, or to
forsake Hortense (for success meant that he must be across the
frontier, and failure meant death; either way he was useless to
her)&mdash;it was fast narrowing to these terrible decisions.</p>

<p>He looked at his face in the large mirror above the mantelpiece,
and was almost startled to see how white it was above the close
cravat and blue striped waistcoat. Surely Durosoy must notice!</p>

<p>The Deputy sat looking into the fire. M. de Jaurès, glancing at
him out of furtive eyes, observed that he, too, was pale.</p>

<p>A pause of silence was broken by the shrill chimes of the gilt
clock striking the half-hour.</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès could not restrain a start. He must go. He could
come back for her if alive; his honour (Heaven help him! he still
thought of that) was the pledge to them, his affection to
her&mdash;she would understand. Perhaps by the servant waiting with
the carriage at the back entrance he could convey a message,
telling her of the changed time.</p>

<p>"You will forgive me," he said with that ease with which breed
enabled him to cover his agony, "but I am due at my
chambers"&mdash;he raised his voice for her to hear&mdash;"the
truth is I have business&mdash;important business to-night.
Good-evening, Durosoy."</p>

<p>He went towards the door; it would be quick running to make the
<i>rue du Temple</i> in time. Heaven enlighten her as to the cause
of his desertion.</p>

<p>"Business?" said the Deputy good-humouredly. "There is no
business nowadays but politics or plots. I hope you are not engaged
in the latter, my dear Camille."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès had his hand on the door-knob. "This is private
business," he answered, "about my property. I am trying to save
some of it."</p>

<p>The Deputy turned in his chair.</p>

<p>"Why, I did not know that your estates were confiscated. Why did
not you tell me? I might have helped you."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès opened the door.</p>

<p>"You are such a busy man, Durosoy. I think I shall manage the
affair satisfactorily."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur le Duc."</p>

<p>At that title he turned sharply, and saw the Deputy standing
before the fire looking at him.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" he asked, and his nostrils widened.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, the expression slipped out. I still think of you as
Monseigneur le Duc. It is an astonishing thing, but I believe I am
still in awe of you, as I used to be in my little office in Lyons."
He smiled fatuously, lowered his eyes to the floor and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Why did you call me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted to speak to you. Take another glass of wine; it
is still early."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is impossible for me to stay. I have an
appointment."</p>

<p>"Bah! Make him wait."</p>

<p>"It is a rendezvous that I would rather keep."</p>

<p>"A strange hour for a business appointment. Are you sure it is
not a lady that you are so anxious to see?"</p>

<p>"Say a lady, then," said M. de Jaurès; "but, believe me that I
must go." He was leaving on that, when the Deputy called after
him.</p>

<p>"I entreat you to stay. It is also a lady of whom I wish to
speak."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès turned slowly and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Come," smiled the Deputy, "another glass."</p>

<p>"What have you to say to me, Durosoy?" He felt as if the hand of
fate were on his shoulder, dragging him back into the room; yet
every moment&mdash;nay, every second&mdash;was precious, fast
becoming doubly precious.</p>

<p>The Deputy was pouring out the wine. His grey and black figure
was illumined by the increasing glow of the fire. He moved bottles
and glasses clumsily by reason of the bandaged forefinger of his
right hand; behind him the clock showed twenty minutes to
twelve.</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès crossed the long room to the hearth.</p>

<p>"What did you wish to say?" he asked, "nay"&mdash;he put the
glass aside&mdash;"of what was it that you wished to speak?"</p>

<p>"My wife."</p>

<p>The noble's first thought was&mdash;'This man is not a fool';
his second, 'He suspects'&mdash;accompanied with a sense of stupor
and confusion.</p>

<p>"You," continued Durosoy, "have known her longer than I have;
she was very much admired, was she not, when she was at the
Court?"</p>

<p>"She was admired, naturally. A strange question! I never knew
her well," answered M. de Jaurès. He was sure the fellow suspected,
not the plot but the elopement. He desperately readjusted his
plans. He could not leave her now; he must forsake his friends
sooner. Had she not said, "I am afraid of <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, that is all," said the Deputy. "Go and keep your
appointment, my friend"&mdash;his eyes suddenly gleamed&mdash;"and
I will finish my wine and presently go and fetch Hortense back to
the ballroom."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès answered his look. "No, I will stay," he said with
a kind of cold calm.</p>

<p>"Ah! Now why have you changed your mind?"</p>

<p>"Because you," was the grim reply, "are so amusing."</p>

<p>He was wondering in his anguish why she did not come out. Surely
she might have made some diversion with her presence. Yet she had
probably changed her gown. Could she hear&mdash;could she
understand?</p>

<p>The man was playing with him; he might even know of the plot. He
must suspect, else why did he remain here, and why did the guests
not notice his or her absence, if they had not been prepared? It
was too late to get to the <i>rue du Temple</i> now. The governor
of the prison was to be abroad for an hour, from twelve to one, and
in that time they were to make their attempt. They would make it
without him. He could not leave Hortense now. It was certain death
ahead of him; he would be denounced to-morrow, and dishonoured, for
he had forsaken his friends.</p>

<p>So raced the thoughts of M. de Jaurès, keeping time to the music
of the quadrille coming from the room overhead, while he stood
impassive by the head of the brocade sofa, and gazed at the Deputy,
who sipped his wine and blinked into the fire.</p>

<p>Two men went by shouting in the street. When their voices had
sunk into the distance the Deputy spoke:</p>

<p>"You are rather imprudent, Citizen."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès was silent; if he had but some manner of weapon he
would kill this man&mdash;perhaps with his bare hands even&mdash;he
came a step nearer.</p>

<p>"I see," continued the Deputy, still looking into the fire,
"that you have a coronet on this handkerchief. Now, do not you
think that very imprudent?"</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès stood arrested. Was this creature, after all, only
a fool? He would, in any case, have killed him; but the days were
gone when noblemen wore swords. Besides, the Deputy sat very near
the bell, and was a strong man. Traditions, too, were a clog on the
young man's passions. He could not use his hands.</p>

<p>"My dear Camille," exclaimed the Deputy, suddenly glancing up,
"you look very pale."</p>

<p>The aristocrat, with the instinct of his breed, was silent under
agony. He gazed at the Deputy straightly.</p>

<p>"Are you going to keep this on your linen?" asked Durosoy,
pointing to the coronet on the blood-stained bandage.</p>

<p>"Are you," answered M. de Jaurès, "going to denounce me?"</p>

<p>The Deputy smiled.</p>

<p>"Because of this? Why, no, how absurd!" he laughed. "As if you,
of all men, had not given proof of your love for the people by
becoming plain Citizen Jaurès. Not so many aristocrats did
that."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès fixed his eyes on the folding doors. It was the one
thing that gave him courage to endure, thinking of her waiting
there, thinking that he would share the inevitable end with her;
thinking she would know he had waited.</p>

<p>The quadrille music took on another measure. The clock gave a
little whirr and struck twelve. The aristocrat shuddered, but held
himself erect. Durosoy suddenly grinned up at him.</p>

<p>"What about your appointment?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am keeping a more important one," said M. de Jaurès through
cold lips.</p>

<p>The Deputy rose.</p>

<p>"Do you not think that I act very well?" he said in a changed
tone.</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès smiled superbly.</p>

<p>"My opinion of you is unchanged, Monsieur."</p>

<p>He had now no longer anything to gain or lose by adopting the
manner of the people. The two men took a step towards the middle of
the room, still facing each other.</p>

<p>"Your appointment," repeated Durosoy. "Why did you not keep
it?"</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès raised his right hand to his heart and retreated a
pace backwards. He hardly heard the words; the speaker's presence
offended him indescribably; he lowered his eyes in instinctive
disgust, withdrawn into his own soul. The attempt in the <i>rue du
Temple</i> had failed or succeeded without him; he had lost the
glory of rescuing the Queen, or the glory of being with the
aristocrats in La Force. They would justly despise him as a coward
and a man of broken faith, but the thing that had induced him to
act thus was the thing that rewarded him&mdash;the thought of
Hortense. Waiting behind the folding doors, she must have heard his
and her fate. She knew perhaps before he came that Durosoy
suspected and their chance was over; she knew now that he had
preferred her even to his word, his pledged honour, for surely that
was gone unless it would be some honour for them to die
together&mdash;he hoped it would be the guillotine, not butchery in
the prison yard&mdash;as befell, good God&mdash;as befell Charles
de Maury, with whom he had once eaten and drunk in this very
room&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He steadied his reeling senses with a jerking shudder and caught
the back of the chair near him. That brute Durosoy was watching
him, waiting for him to betray himself, being, no doubt, very sure
of both of them, the man before him and the woman behind the
folding doors.</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès smiled.</p>

<p>"What are you and I looking at each other like this for, eh?" he
asked.</p>

<p>A soldier went past singing <i>Ça ira</i>; it mingled with the
monotonous repeated music of the quadrille; the coals fell together
with a little crash; the Deputy stood in a slack attitude surveying
his victim.</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès laughed.</p>

<p>"We will see," said Durosoy slowly, "if Hortense is recovered
from her headache."</p>

<p>He turned towards the folding doors. M. de Jaurès longed for
them to open; at least he would have that moment when she came
forth and walked straight to him, all disguises over.</p>

<p>The Deputy turned the crystal handle and opened the door a
little way; he looked over his shoulder and said one word:</p>

<p>"Aristocrat!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered M. de Jaurès. "She and I&mdash;both
aristocrats."</p>

<p>Durosoy pushed the door a little wider open; his dull, foolish
manner was changing to a deep breathing ferocity.</p>

<p>"The Widow Capet is still in the Temple, aristocrat," he said,
"and your friends are in La Force by now."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès kept his head high.</p>

<p>"So you knew," he said softly. "You are a cunning rat, Citizen
Durosoy."</p>

<p>The Deputy's eyes were suddenly flushed with blood.</p>

<p>"Hortense must thank you, aristocrat, for breaking your
appointment for her sake."</p>

<p>M. de Jaurès came nearer. There was darkness beyond the folding
doors&mdash;the white shoe in the same position and the fold of
pearl-braided satin.</p>

<p>The Deputy suddenly flung the other leaf wide.</p>

<p>"I am a cunning rat, am I not?" he said with a sob of hate. "My
wife! My wife!" he cried, pointing to her.</p>

<p>She sat just inside the doors, facing them. There was a long red
streak down the bosom of her white bodice, her eyes were fixed and
her jaw dropped; across her knee was a knife stained with marks
like rust.</p>

<p>The Deputy stood looking at M. de Jaurès.</p>

<p>"You see, I have been cutting peaches with a steel
knife...."</p>
