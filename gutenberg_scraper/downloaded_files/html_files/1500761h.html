  <h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">LANCE SIDWAY pulled himself up from the stone steps of the
  Natural History Museum. He laughed ruefully as he realized that this was his
  third visit to the institution. As on his two previous excursions, he had
  wandered round and round the inside halls examining the mounted specimens of
  wild animals. He loved four-footed creatures, and though a pang beset him to
  see these lifeless counterfeits of what had once been the free beasts of the
  wild, he yet experienced a sense of escape and peace that he had not felt
  since he left his Oregon range home for Hollywood.</p>

  <p>There was, he knew now, a future in the motion-picture studios for his
  great horse &ldquo;Umpqua,&rdquo; and perhaps one for himself as well. But he
  shied at becoming an actor and hated to double for the handsome cowboy
  Apollos of the screen; and to hang around the studios merely as the owner of
  a wonderful horse, letting the spirited animal earn his living for him, did
  not fit his idea of a career. As a matter of fact, he had never desired a
  future in Hollywood under such circumstances and the immediate necessity for
  earning money was over. Nance, his sister, was perfectly well again after her
  operation and would soon be married. So in demand, indeed, had Umpqua been
  that Lance found himself with at least enough cash in hand to last him until
  he could find a job more to his liking.</p>

  <p>He found himself leaning toward a horseback ride through southern
  California, across Arizona, perhaps into New Mexico. To be sure the cattle
  business was practically ruined, but the desert ranges and purple uplands of
  Arizona, or the silver grassed valleys of New Mexico, about which he had read
  so much, would be vastly wilder and infinitely freer than the old pastures he
  had ridden, and surely there would be some kind of a job for a husky chap who
  was fond of animals.</p>

  <p>There was a singular zest in the thought of new adventure in a harder
  country than he had known. But the truth was, Hollywood did not let go its
  grip so easily. And why? Lance knew that he had no ambition to beat the movie
  game. Still he admitted the fascination of the gay bright whirl of the
  picture world. Reducing this down to the lure of feminine charm seemed
  another step in the right direction. Lance dubiously admitted to himself that
  he was afraid he had more than the ordinary male&rsquo;s weakness for the
  fair sex. But hell! he thought in self-defense, just think of
  Hollywood&rsquo;s thousands of extras, and more thousands of girls unable to
  find even jobs as extras, many of them exceptionally beautiful, all of them
  pretty! Here was a case where it was hard to break away. And he ruefully
  recalled the three girls to whose attraction he had
  succumbed&mdash;Coretta&mdash;and Virginia&mdash;and lastly Maurine. Only
  last night Maurine had faced him, a little pale, with dark eyes steady.
  &ldquo;Lance, you&rsquo;ve been swell to me,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;I
  could lie to you, but I won&rsquo;t. At last I&rsquo;ve got a break. You know
  what that means. I must make the grade.... Sure I love you. String along with
  me, darling, and when I&rsquo;m a star....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was Hollywood, but it was not Lance Sidway. Looked at now, in this
  serious moment, it seemed a deciding factor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d happen
  again,&rdquo; muttered Lance, sadly. &ldquo;And I might fall worse.
  It&rsquo;s coming to me.... I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he arose with springy step to gaze at the hazy Sierra Madres beyond
  which barrier there was an unsettled land. He strolled through a long terrace
  of roses, sensitive to their color and fragrance. They were beautiful, but he
  liked wild flowers best. Meanwhile he was revolving in mind the problem of
  riding Umpqua out of California. The horse was fat and needed work. He would
  not care much for the asphalt roads; perhaps, however, from Palm Springs
  south Lance could keep mostly to soft ground. Once in condition again, Umpqua
  was good for fifty miles a day without turning a hair.</p>

  <p>Lance emerged from the Museum park, and presently, strolling along, he
  found himself on the edge of the University campus. Students of both sexes
  were in evidence, some chatting in groups, others moving along with books
  under their arms. These bareheaded boys and girls in their colorful sweaters,
  young and full of the joy of life, aroused memory and regret in Lance. After
  high school he had attended college in Corvallis for nearly a year, and
  outside of freshman miseries, which now seemed sweet, he had done well in his
  studies and better in athletics. But financial trouble had intervened and
  Nance&rsquo;s illness... both of which had sent him to Hollywood. This
  college atmosphere was something that he liked. If only his father had not
  died, to leave Nance and him orphans! Lance cast off the sadness. His sister
  was well&mdash;happy&mdash;and he had the greatest horse in the West and a
  new adventure in that West before him. Pretty lucky, Lance thought he should
  be telling himself! Reaching a cross street Lance halted to absorb more of
  the flash of color on the campus. He sauntered up the cross street toward
  some shade trees. On that side there were more students. He heard bantering
  voices and gay high-pitched laughter.</p>

  <p>The shrill sound of a siren disrupted his attention, as well as that of
  the students. Wheeling, Lance saw a bright topless roadster turning the
  corner from the main street. Its driver was a bareheaded girl with hair
  bright as spun gold. At the moment she withdrew her extended left arm. Behind
  her raced the car with the loud horn. It caught up with her. One of the two
  occupants, surely policemen, yelled for her to stop. The young woman took her
  time about it, and passing Lance, finally halted at the first shade trees
  where half a dozen students had congregated. Lance had not far to go to reach
  them and he strolled along, curious, expectant, and a little angry at the
  gruff yell of the officer. Lance was in time to hear:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have stopped,&rdquo; replied the girl, coolly.</p>

  <p>Lance joined the group of students who had advanced to the curb. From all
  points on the campus others were coming, some on the run. Then Lance saw the
  girl at close range. Many a time in the studios and on the locations had he
  sustained a shock of masculine transport, but he had never seen a
  motion-picture star who in his opinion could hold a candle to this girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, what do these cops want?&rdquo; queried a tall young
  fellow, stepping out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, Rollie,&rdquo; she replied, with a laugh.
  &ldquo;But I think they want to chase me off the streets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea, officer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s any of your business, freshie, she was
  speedin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned the other, a burly man, red-faced and
  thin-lipped, alighting from the police car. &ldquo;<i>I</i> know her
  an&rsquo; <i>she</i> knows me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; queried the student, insolently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah! She was makin&rsquo; forty-five on the turn an&rsquo; she
  didn&rsquo;t even hold out her hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, ossifer, <i>we</i> saw this lady turn and she wasn&rsquo;t
  making twenty,&rdquo; interposed another student.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lay off us kids, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked another,
  plaintively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there enough drunk drivers to keep you
  busy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looks a little steamed up himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Good-natured cat calls and boos sounded from back of the circle of
  students, crowding closer and denser. They sensed events. Lance gathered that
  the officers did not fail to grasp something inimical to their own well-being
  at the moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give the girl a ticket, Brady, and let&rsquo;s get going,&rdquo;
  advised the one at the wheel.</p>

  <p>A storm of protest went up from the foremost line of students. Rollie, who
  evidently had some distinction on the campus, yelled for them to shut up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beat it, you flat-feet!&rdquo; he called, sharply. &ldquo;You hang
  around here and run us fellows ragged. But lay off the girls. Get that? We
  won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shut up or I&rsquo;ll run you in,&rdquo; said Brady angrily, as
  he began writing the summons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, is it coming to you?&rdquo; Rollie asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not this time, Rollie, I swear,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I did
  run away from him some days ago. But today I wasn&rsquo;t making
  twenty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You tell that to the Judge,&rdquo; said Brady, coldly.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re interferin&rsquo; with an officer of the
  law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Law, hooey! Only when there&rsquo;s nothing in it for you. Get the
  hell out of here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The crowd of students surged over the sidewalk and pulled the officer from
  the running board of the car. He made the mistake of raising his fist, and
  striking himself free he shouted to his companion: &ldquo;Send a riot
  call!&rdquo; At that juncture a motorcycle policeman roared up to make a
  fringe of students in the street hop out of his way. Brady hoarsely repeated
  his order to him, and with his comrade, both swinging their arms, cleared a
  space.</p>

  <p>Lance had been shoved off the pavement by the pushing of the students, all
  of them roused now and full of devilment. Rollie appeared to be the only one
  who took the affair seriously. The girl, Madge, acted as if she were enjoying
  the proceedings. But her violet eyes were ablaze. Rollie leaped on the
  running board and leaned close to speak low to her. Then Brady turning with
  red visage and bristling front jerked Rollie down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young woman, get away from that wheel,&rdquo; he ordered, opening
  the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you for a little ride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like hell you will,&rdquo; she rejoined, her voice as ringing as a
  bell. And she snapped the door shut.</p>

  <p>Brady&rsquo;s attention veered to a charging crowd of students who pushed
  the officers&rsquo; car down the street, while another gang, yelling like
  Indians, rushed the truck of a fruit and vegetable vendor who had happened
  along. They halted him, and in gold and red streams they spilled the mounds
  of oranges and tomatoes into the street. Another moment saw the air full of
  colored missiles. Their target was the offending car of the law. A smashing
  of windows and clinking of glass mingled with the derisive yells of the
  assailants. Then the driver, who had attempted in no gentle manner to drive
  the students from crowding Brady, turned to roar at the slingers. A huge soft
  tomato struck him squarely in the face. That elicited a howl of fiendish glee
  from the armed force in the street. A hail of oranges and tomatoes not only
  halted his belligerent rush but blinded him, swamped him, knocked him flat.
  At the moment, then, a blare of sirens announced the arrival of
  reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Lance hung by the girl&rsquo;s car while the students, numbering hundreds
  by now, rushed pell-mell into the street, whooping like a lot of Indians.
  What was left of the vendor&rsquo;s ample supply of oranges and tomatoes
  disappeared from his truck as if by magic to take swift form of a colorful
  barrage right at the charging policemen. For a while they were held back, but
  as the supply of ammunition began to diminish, they forged forward,
  eventually to drive the students out of the street upon the campus. But it
  was not an onslaught such as Brady and his man had attempted. The students
  were having a wonderful time, but the officers, plainly disgusted and angered
  though they were, did not resort to violence. Against three hundred crazy
  students they could do nothing save harangue them off the street.</p>

  <p>Lance, keenly enjoying the whole performance, was suddenly startled by a
  cry from the girl in the car. And as he wheeled he leaped off the curb. Brady
  had opened the car door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Move over, Blondie,&rdquo; he ordered, a rude hand on her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You dirty bum! Don&rsquo;t you dare paw me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It appeared to Lance that the officer&rsquo;s action exceeded his
  authority. Even if it had not, the girl&rsquo;s poignant outburst and the
  flash of her magnificent eyes would have been enough for Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m drivin&rsquo; you to the station,&rdquo; declared Brady,
  shoving at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not!&rdquo; she cried, starting the engine. &ldquo;Get off
  or I&rsquo;ll spread you along the street.... I&rsquo;ll drive
  to...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance snatched the policeman&rsquo;s hand off the car and as he turned in
  surprise Lance hit him a not-too-gentle blow on his rather protruding
  abdomen. A gasping expulsion of breath followed the sodden drumlike sound.
  Brady began to sag. Lance reached up with powerful hand, pulled him off the
  running board, and then with a vicious swing of fist at the convulsed visage
  he laid the officer neatly in the street. In action as swift, Lance vaulted
  into the car.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Step on it!&rdquo; he yelled. And almost before the words passed
  his lips the little car shot ahead. Lance&rsquo;s knees came up hard under
  the dash. A shrill blast from the horn sent several students leaping for
  their lives. Then the car ate up the open street, to whirl at the corner, and
  sped on, describing swift half-circles in the traffic. Lance&rsquo;s hat went
  flying, and as the car grazed a trolley his hair stood up stiff. Though
  scared as he had never been, Lance&rsquo;s heart strangled a cowboy yell in
  his throat and his blood beat thick in his ears and he was possessed by a
  wild elation. The car whirled off the thoroughfare into a quiet street, on
  which the houses blurred in Lance&rsquo;s sight. Another turn, then block
  after block on a traffic-congested street, then a break in the
  speed&mdash;and at last a parking place!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exploded Lance, catching his breath. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
  have shaken them&mdash;if they had chased us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; rejoined the girl, with an amazing
  coolness. And she uttered a low laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world. Say, but you can drive,&rdquo; burst out
  Lance, turning to look at her. With steady beautiful hands, and shapely
  coral-tinted finger tips she was taking a gold monogrammed cigarette case
  from her purse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. Have a cigarette?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I scare you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but it was a great ride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we got the best of those cops anyway, and now we&rsquo;re
  just two fugitives from justice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this time Lance was gazing at the girl, conscious of a mounting
  exhilaration. To find pleasure in the beauty of women had been the only debt
  he owed Hollywood. But this visual experience seemed a magnifying of all
  former sensations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, your hand!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in sudden solicitude.</p>

  <p>Then Lance became aware that he was opening and shutting his right hand,
  the knuckles of which were bruised. It was a big brown member, matching his
  brawny wrist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bunged my fist&mdash;a little,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly.
  &ldquo;Nothing much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No?&mdash;I wonder what that cop thought. I&rsquo;ll never forget
  his face. I was looking at it when you socked him. Did that tickle
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; returned Lance, beaming at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see he was sore at me. He&rsquo;s caught me before. Last time I
  made eyes at him, you know, and let him think.... I had a date and was late.
  Next time he spotted me I ran away from him. Today he must have been laying
  for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that was it? Big fathead! You&rsquo;ll get hauled up for this.
  I&rsquo;m sorry. But I had to slug him.... I was looking at you when
  he...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry. You made me your friend for life. Rollie was
  mad, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have done that.... You&rsquo;re not a college
  man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I went one year at Corvallis. Then... but that wouldn&rsquo;t
  interest you. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d better be going.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; she replied, detaining him with a hand
  on his sleeve. &ldquo;Indeed I am interested. You&rsquo;re not going to walk
  out on me after such a romantic adventure. Are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Madge&mdash;I&mdash;you... of course, that&rsquo;s up to
  the lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It always should be, even if it isn&rsquo;t. Tell me about
  yourself. I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re from Hollywood. You have that
  cut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? You don&rsquo;t mean movie actor?&rdquo; inquired Lance,
  quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? Too bad! You&rsquo;re handsome enough to be one. My sorority
  sisters will be jealous. I&rsquo;ll have you out to the house to meet
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be swell. But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not
  possible. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not married?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should say not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor in love. I know how that malady affects them,&rdquo; she
  replied, flippantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind. I&mdash;I have to say no.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, of all things. A turn-down from a cavalier who fought for me!
  ... It doesn&rsquo;t happen, at least never yet.... They always say:
  &lsquo;How about a date?&rsquo;... What&rsquo;re you doing out in
  Hollywood?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I own a horse. He&rsquo;s been in pictures, not I. Oh, I&rsquo;ve
  had to ride him a few times, doubling for these actors. I hated that.
  It&rsquo;s almost as tough on me as letting them ride him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A wonderful horse. How thrilling! I love horses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As much as cars?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More. We have a ranch and some Arabians.... What&rsquo;s his
  name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpqua.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpqua? Must be Indian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. Means swift.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then he can run?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Run!&mdash;See here, little lady, Umpqua is as swift as the
  wind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;ve a horse that can beat him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance laughed. Here apparently was a real western girl. It did not detract
  from the dazzling glamour of her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he pretty&mdash;beautiful&mdash;grand, or what?&rdquo; she
  continued.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All of them. Umpqua has Arabian blood,&rdquo; replied Lance,
  warming to her interest. That seemed to put him on her level. &ldquo;He is
  big and rangy. Mottled black with white feet and nose. Bright soft eyes.
  Spirited but gentle. And this Hollywood game hasn&rsquo;t done him any good.
  That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to quit it and leave this place. Ump is too
  fine, too sweet a horse for Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You love him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said, softly, as if she
  understood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I do. Why, he saved Nance&rsquo;s life.... Nance is
  my sister. Umpqua was given to me when he was a colt. He&rsquo;s cowboy bred.
  On the Oregon range near Bend. And no horse ever had ten years&rsquo; better
  breeding.... Well, Nance and I were left alone. We lost the ranch. I had to
  quit college. She fell ill. It was necessary to have special treatment for
  her&mdash;operations and all&mdash;to save her life. So to earn the money I
  brought Umpqua to Hollywood where I had been assured of a job. And did he
  make good? I&rsquo;m telling you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes were bright with interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Splendid. And your sister&mdash;Nance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just fine now. She&rsquo;s going to be married soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell!... Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t I love to see Umpqua? But I
  wouldn&rsquo;t dare. I&rsquo;d want to buy him. I always try to buy
  everything I like. And you&rsquo;d hate me. That wouldn&rsquo;t do at all....
  Cowboy, are you leaving town? Wouldn&rsquo;t you like... couldn&rsquo;t we
  meet again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I... hope to see you again,&rdquo; stammered
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have a lot in common. Horses and ranches&mdash;and
  things,&rdquo; she went on, consulting her wrist watch. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
  see. If I don&rsquo;t get pinched and haled into court, I can cut psych. Say
  two-thirty, here, tomorrow. Will that be convenient?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay by me,&rdquo; replied Lance, and opened the door to step
  out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for all you did. Good-by till tomorrow. And be careful.
  Don&rsquo;t forget you punched a cop. They&rsquo;ll be looking for you if
  they can remember what you look like. I won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance stood there rooted to the spot, watching the bright car and golden
  head flash out of sight. Then expecting to come down to earth with a dull
  thud, he found himself in the clouds. He soared while he hunted for a
  westbound trolley and the long ride out seemed only a few moments. Riding a
  block past his street augured further of his mental aberration. He strode on,
  out of the main zone of buildings, into the hills, and up the canyon where he
  had lodgings with a man who rented him a little pasture and stall for his
  horse. Lance went into the alfalfa-odorous barn. Umpqua nickered at him.
  &ldquo;My God, Ump!&rdquo; said Lance, as he put his arm over the noble
  arched neck and laid his cheek against the glossy mane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  fallen like a ton of bricks. Hardest ever!&mdash;No, old pard, not a movie
  extra or even a star. But a college girl. Another blonde, Ump! Only this one
  has them all backed off the lot.... So that&rsquo;s what was wrong with me
  when I sat dumb in her car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Contact with Umpqua brought Lance down to reality and to the fact that he
  was leaving Hollywood. Against his sober judgment he would keep the date with
  the girl, which would be a last sentimental gesture before he rode out toward
  the open ranges and to the life he was meant for.</p>

  <p>Lance packed and tagged his outfit, walked downtown to an express office,
  and checked it to be sent for later. Then he cashed his last check from the
  studio. It was still only midafternoon. On the boulevard he dropped into a
  movie theater and sat through two pictures, no details of which he could have
  even faintly remembered afterward. Then he went to a restaurant for his
  supper. Even his usually keen appetite did not return to break his
  abstraction. Thereafter he strolled up the boulevard, knowing it would be the
  last time. There was a première at the Chinese, heralded aloft by great
  searchlight beams, streaking up and sweeping across the heavens.
  Hollywood&rsquo;s main thoroughfare blazed with colored lights. Cars hummed
  to and fro, halted for the signals, rolled on again. Lance stood on the
  corner of Vine Street, absorbing the flash, the glitter, the roar, the vivid
  life of the strange city. There was a little sadness mixed with his varied
  feelings and he could not quite analyze the cause. He did not really want
  this life. Then a shining black limousine sped noiselessly by. Lance caught a
  fleeting glimpse of a lovely fair girl, radiant in white, lying languorously
  back against the black-clad shoulder of her companion. That was Hollywood.
  How many times Lance had seen the same sight, always with a vague envy!</p>

  <p>He let that glimpse be the last to intrigue him, and striding back to his
  room, he went to bed. There, wide-awake, he lay in the dark, remembering,
  wondering, feeling more clearly than at any time since his adventure.</p>

  <p>A vivid and entrancing picture of the girl appeared etched against the
  blackness. Her face floated there, exquisitely fair. It was oval, crowned by
  shining golden hair, which waved back from her broad low brow. Slender arched
  eyebrows marked large intent eyes, wide apart, dark, the color of violets and
  singularly expressive with a light of friendliness, of frank interest. The
  whole face had a flash, of which fixed and changeless beauty was only a
  part.</p>

  <p>Feature by feature the girl&rsquo;s face appeared to Lance with a
  clearness which astonished him.</p>

  <p>Lance shut his eyes to blot out this memory picture. But it made no
  difference. She was there, in his mind, on his heart. Never in all his life
  had he yearned for anything so dearly as to kiss those red lips. That dragged
  him rudely out of his trance. It would be wise not to see the girl again.
  With a pang he abandoned the idea. Majesty.... Madge, that student Rollie had
  called her. The first name suited her. Who was she? Where was that ranch with
  the Arabian horses? Somewhere in California, no doubt. That girl had class.
  Yet there was nothing the least snobbish about her. Too lovely, too kind and
  sweet to be a flirt! No need. She was rich, of course, Lance thought,
  remembering her clothes and her car! He remembered, too, the jeweled monogram
  on her cigarette case, but could recall only the letter M. And Lance rolled
  over to go to sleep. Aw! What the hell? He was always mooning over some
  pretty dame, especially a blonde, and here he had what was coming to him.
  Forget it, cowboy, and hit the trail.</p>

  <p>All the same he dreamed of her and upon awakening in the morning, he began
  to waver in his resolution. Why be a sap? She had been grateful. He would
  want to know how she fared with the police and the college authorities. She
  would keep the date and wait for him. Lance, in the broad light of day, while
  he made his final preparations to leave, thought better of his resolve not to
  meet her. Treat a swell girl like that&mdash;stand her up on a promised
  date&mdash;a girl who loved horses&mdash;it just was not in him. And all the
  rest of the morning, at lunch, and when he took the bus downtown, he was
  conscious of a tingling expectance, a heat in his veins, a glamour over
  everything.</p>

  <p>It amazed Lance extremely that he could not immediately find the parking
  place where he was to meet the girl. He had been so balmy, he thought, that
  he had scarcely known whether he was walking or riding. It was a good thing
  that he had come downtown so early. After wandering around, up one street and
  down another, at last he found the vacant lot which had been utilized to park
  cars. He was still a quarter of an hour ahead of time. An attendant,
  observing Lance loitering around, told him he could sit in one of the cars if
  he were waiting for someone. Lance promptly availed himself of this
  permission; in fact he took a back seat in a car standing against a building.
  Lance did not believe she would come at all; if she did he wanted to see her
  before she spied him. The buoyancy usual with Lance at a rendezvous seemed to
  be wanting here. This was a tremendous occasion.</p>

  <p>He could see a large blue-handed clock in a tower some distance away, and
  watching this, as the half hour neared, he gave way more and more to
  inexplicable feelings. If she came, that would be proof she liked him, and
  maybe.... Why not postpone his departure for Arizona? A few days or even
  weeks would not make any particular difference. If she wanted to see him,
  take him to the house to meet her friends, perhaps go out to see
  Umpqua&mdash;how could he ever resist that? He had always been a fool over
  girls. With this one he would be serious and assuredly she had only a passing
  fancy or interest in him.</p>

  <p>Or she might have been one of these beautiful dames who had to have a new
  flame every day. Maybe he had better just wait to have a farewell look at
  her, and not let her know he was there. But suppose she really had been
  struck with him! That was possible. It had happened once. In this case there
  would never again be any peace away from the glad light of those violet
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! I was a dumbbell for coming,&rdquo; he muttered, kicking
  himself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s late now.... She won&rsquo;t come&mdash;and am I
  glad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he lingered there, sliding down in the seat, watching with
  hawk eyes the passing cars, slowly succumbing to a pang in his breast. At a
  quarter to three he gave up hope.</p>

  <p>Then a bright tan roadster flashed into sight. It slowed and turned in.
  The driver was a girl in blue. But her blue hat did not hide a gleam of gold.
  She had come! Lance&rsquo;s heart gave a leap and his blood gushed through
  his veins.</p>

  <p>Then a seven-passenger car, shiny black in hue, flashed into sight, slowed
  and stopped outside the turn. From it leaped a slender young man, noticeably
  well-dressed. He waved the car on with sharp gesture and came hurrying, his
  piercing gaze on the blonde girl.</p>

  <p>Lance saw her sweep a quick glance all around the parking place. She was
  looking for him, and the disappointment she expressed was so sweet and moving
  to Lance that it would have drawn him out of his hiding place but for the
  mien of the newcomer.</p>

  <p>She had halted at an angle from Lance&rsquo;s position, perhaps a dozen
  steps distant, and scarcely had she dismissed the polite attendant when the
  other man caught up to lean over the side of her car. He did not remove his
  soft gray hat. He had a remarkably handsome visage, pale, chiseled as if from
  marble, a square chin and ruthless mouth, and light gray eyes sharp as
  daggers. He reminded Lance of someone he knew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the lam, eh, Madge? You certainly gave that driver of mine a
  run,&rdquo; he said, with an air of cool effrontery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Bee. What do you mean&mdash;on the lam?&rdquo; she
  replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trying to run away from me again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I was in a hurry to keep a date. I&rsquo;m too late. He&rsquo;s
  come and gone. Damn old Fuzzy-Top! It was his fault.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was your date with Fuzzy-Top?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. You don&rsquo;t seem to understand my college talk any better
  than I do your gangster expressions. Fuzzy is one of my profs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gangster! Lance sustained a sudden shock. So that was it. This young man
  bore a remarkable resemblance to the picture star, Robert Morris, in his
  racketeer roles. What could the girl possibly have to do with a gangster?
  Plenty, thought Lance, considering that she had the imperious look of one who
  had an insatiable thirst for adventure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, I haven&rsquo;t said nothing yet,&rdquo; replied the fellow,
  with a laugh. &ldquo;Saying it with flowers is not my way. How about
  cocktails? Take me for a ride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bee, I told you I had a date,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;With a
  perfectly swell fellow. I&rsquo;m crazy about him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? He doesn&rsquo;t seem so crazy about you. Dish the date and
  let&rsquo;s go places.&rdquo; With that the cool gentleman walked around the
  front of her car, and opening the door he slipped in and slammed it shut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a nerve,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that was what you liked about
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suspect I did. You were something new, Bee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. You&rsquo;re a new twist on me. All women are flirts. But I
  went for you in a big way. And you went out with me, didn&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. A couple of times. If you recall I met you at the Grove one
  afternoon for tea. We danced. And one other time at the Biltmore, where we
  quarreled because you were pretty raw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cooled on me, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly. You still pack a thrill. But you&rsquo;re a little
  too&mdash;too...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, no broad ever made a sucker of Bee Uhl yet,&rdquo; he
  rejoined, with a crisp ring in his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Uhl, you&rsquo;re quite beyond me,&rdquo; said the girl, with a
  smile that disarmed her aloofness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re going
  to make me regret my&mdash;well, shall we call it playful indiscretion? I
  never took you for a gentleman, but I thought you a good sport. If I&rsquo;m
  not mistaken the favors of our little flirtation were yours.... Where can I
  drop you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Beauty, you hate yourself, don&rsquo;t you? Well, I can take
  it. But the Honey Bee is not through buzzing around yet.... Let me off corner
  Seventh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In another moment they were gone, leaving Lance in a queer state of mind.
  He hardly knew what to think, or why he had not made his presence known.
  Presently his romance burst like a pricked bubble. But his relief did not
  equal his regret. He would not be seeing Madge again. If her apparently
  friendly contact with a gangster had caused her to fall somewhat in his hasty
  estimation, that did not seem to make any difference. Almost he sympathized
  with Honey Bee Uhl. That was a cognomen. Lance wondered what it signified.
  Then his sympathy veered to the spirited girl. He seemed to grasp that it
  would be impossible for her to have any fun, at least with men, to follow any
  natural bent of conquest or coquetry, to play around and look for what and
  whom she wanted from life, without leaving havoc in her wake. A girl as
  beautiful as she was, radiant with such an intense and fatal charm, would
  have to go into a nunnery, or else expect a fall of Troy around her. No doubt
  she desired that very thing. Lance congratulated himself on his great good
  fortune in avoiding the meeting, yet when it was too late he wanted it
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>In less than two hours Lance was riding Umpqua along the hilly backroads
  of Hollywood. He was on his way and saw the last of the town from a bridle
  path high upon a foothill. He knew every bit of soft road under the slope of
  the mountains and avoided the asphalt wherever possible. At nine
  o&rsquo;clock, some twenty miles out of the city, he called it a day and
  sought lodgings for himself and Umpqua.</p>

  <p>Up at dawn he made San Bernardino by nightfall and the next day Banning.
  This entrance to the desert pass he welcomed as an event. From there on he
  could keep his horse almost altogether off the paved roads. That night Lance
  was so tired he went to sleep when his head touched the pillow. On the
  following morning he headed down San Gorgonio Pass toward the great gray
  valley of the southernmost California desert.</p>

  <p>He knew that arid country, having been to Palm Springs and Indio with
  motion-picture companies. Still, sight of the rolling wasteland with its
  knolls of mesquite and flats of greasewood, and the irregular barren
  mountains zigzagging the horizon, afforded him keen pleasure. How different
  this country from the golden pastures and black hills and swift streams of
  Oregon! Lance could not have conceived a greater contrast. And by noonday the
  June heat of the desert was intense. Sweat oozed out of his every pore and
  Umpqua was wet. But this heat was what both horse and rider needed. They were
  heavy from underwork and overeating. By midafternoon Lance reached a little
  station on the railroad above Indio, where he halted for the night. He slept
  on a spread of hay under a cottonwood tree; and when the red sun peeped over
  the Chocolate Mountains next morning Lance felt that the comfort and the lure
  of Hollywood had been left far behind.</p>

  <p>From that point he began a leisurely journey down the long sun-baked
  desert. Mecca, the Salton Sea, Niland were each marked by hitching up another
  hole in Umpqua&rsquo;s cinch. But the great horse, once off the automobile
  roads and loosened up by the heat, soon showed his sound bottom and his love
  of the open. He knew they were headed for new ranges. Lance struck the
  five-mile stretch of sand dunes at sunrise, and he marveled at the smooth
  mounds with their knifelike crests, the scalloped vales between the dunes,
  the opal hues changing and playing across the sands. Umpqua did not like this
  region where his hoofs sank to his fetlocks. The flinty levels beyond, black
  and red with polished gravel, the sparse tufts of greasewood and cactus, the
  volcanic peaks, and finally the dusky arrowwood-bordered road to the Colorado
  River&mdash;these kept Umpqua on his easy ground-covering gait. Lance&rsquo;s
  first sight of the red river justified what he had anticipated&mdash;a sullen
  swirling muddy flood, inimicable to horse and rider. And Yuma at night struck
  Lance favorably, with its wide main street and bright lights, its giant
  Indians and stealthily stepping Mexicans. He was across the river and this
  was Arizona.</p>

  <p>That fact roused Lance at dawn. On his way again he appeared to have
  Arizona burst upon him in a blaze of brilliant sunlight that flooded vast
  wastes of barren soil and meager patches of grass, and ranges of ragged
  mountains asleep in the sunrise, and dim mesas and escarpments in the
  distance, and ghosts of purple domes hauntingly vague. Lance was a man of the
  open, but the great distances, the vastness, the endless reach of wasteland
  allured while it repelled him. He rode on, and dust, heat, wind were his
  portion. Ranches, service stations, hamlets stretched lonesomely across the
  desert. He had lost track of days and miles beyond Yuma by the time he
  reached Florence. Tombstone with its preserved buildings of a hard frontier
  past, Bisbee with its great mines and bustle, Douglas, an enterprising and
  progressive town marked Lance&rsquo;s long ride across southern Arizona.
  Lance meant to strike off the main highway and railroad somewhere beyond
  Douglas into the ever-increasing rugged grandeur and beautiful valleys of
  this Arizona land. But his money, which he had thought would hold out for a
  much longer period, had dwindled to almost nothing, and it was now necessary
  that he stop and look for work. A rest would do Umpqua good. Lance found a
  Mexican who owned a small pasture outside of town and here he left the horse.
  In a pinch he could pawn his watch or gun, but he would have a try at finding
  work before resorting to that.</p>

  <p>Lance accosted men in service stations and stores without any success.
  What he wanted to encounter was a cowboy. But this type appeared remarkably
  scarce. One man, evidently a cattleman, laughed gruffly at Lance: &ldquo;Wal,
  son, thet kind of two-laiged critter has been aboot washed up on this
  range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say. What by?&rdquo; queried Lance, blankly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon by hard times. North of heah a ways there&rsquo;s some
  cattle left. But down heah the only successful business is
  bootlegging.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That discouraged Lance, and he strolled around, slowly succumbing to the
  need of pawning his watch. Walking in high-heeled cowboy boots was not
  exactly a joy. It was noon and Lance was hot. Presently he heard voices near
  at hand, and turning discovered that he had halted close to a big black car,
  from which issued sharp voices. A second glance at that car struck him
  singularly. How like the black car that had followed the girl Madge to the
  parking place where he had chosen to avoid meeting her! With a pang he
  realized he had not thought of her for days. He was in another world. But
  this car!... Shiny black, without a gleam of metal anywhere, a fine
  high-priced machine, it certainly resembled....</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, buddy, come here,&rdquo; called a voice that shot through
  Lance. A young man, with pale face and eyes like gimlets, was leaning out of
  the front seat opposite the driver. Lance recognized him immediately. The
  young man Madge had designated as a gangster and who had called himself Honey
  Bee Uhl.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">LANCE advanced slowly, hiding an intense curiosity. Somehow
  he wanted to find out all he could about this fellow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, yourself,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look sort of on the loose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I look just what I am,&rdquo; Lance replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No offense. We&rsquo;re loafing here for a guy, and I just wanted
  to be friendly. Care for a drink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not till I have a feed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Broke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Flat as a pancake. And I can&rsquo;t find a job in this slow
  burg.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, buddy, there&rsquo;s plenty jobs for the right guys. Can you
  drive a truck?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister, I could drive two trucks,&rdquo; retorted Lance,
  boastfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Well, how&rsquo;d you like to grab a century?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uhuh! Sounds good to me. I&rsquo;d pull almost any kind of a job
  for that much dough. Only I&rsquo;d want to be sure I was going to get
  it,&rdquo; laughed Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly. It&rsquo;s okay. Now who are you and what have you been
  doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never heard of me, mister,&rdquo; said Lance, evasively.
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ve been beating it from L. A.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dicks after you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance laughed grimly and looked blankly silent, and averted his face
  somewhat from the piercing scrutiny bent upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come clean with me, buddy, if you want your luck to change. What
  you been doing in L. A.?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you asking me, mister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. It&rsquo;s not for you to ask <i>me</i>
  questions,&rdquo; replied Uhl, with impatient sharpness. &ldquo;Take it or
  leave it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, what the hell? I&rsquo;m hungry.... I beat it out of Portland
  ahead of Latzy Cork,&rdquo; hazarded Lance, remembering the name of a shady
  underworld character who had recently been eluding the police on the
  coast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That racket, eh?&rdquo; flashed Uhl, snapping his fingers. And with
  his eyes like gray fire he turned in the seat to his companions. Lance took
  advantage of this moment to make certain that he would recognize the driver
  of the car, and the three hard-faced individuals in the back seat, if he ever
  saw them again. At the side of the one farthest toward the road Lance espied
  the muzzle of a machine gun. &ldquo;Cork may have been spotting me. What do
  you think, Dipper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a chance, Bee. He&rsquo;s been in Frisco and north for two
  months,&rdquo; replied the one addressed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Uhl, doubtfully, and turning
  again he pulled out a roll of bills, the wrapper of which bore the
  denomination one hundred. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your dough, buddy....
  You&rsquo;re on the spot. But the only risk you run is if you double-cross
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I undertake the job, I&rsquo;ll be straight,&rdquo; interposed
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you strike me.... See the big canvas-covered truck
  across there, back of the service station? Well, she&rsquo;s your bus.
  You&rsquo;re to take her to Tucson. She&rsquo;s empty, but you drive slow, as
  if she was loaded heavy. See? You&rsquo;ll be held up sooner or later,
  probably after dark outside of Tucson. That&rsquo;ll be okay. You&rsquo;re
  dumb. You just drove the truck over and you don&rsquo;t know me.
  See?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I see or not,&rdquo; rejoined Lance,
  dubiously. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll hold me up&mdash;and why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you won&rsquo;t need to fake being dumb. All you got to do is
  stop when you&rsquo;re held up. See? You don&rsquo;t know nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does that truck belong to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rumrunner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you it was empty,&rdquo; snapped Uhl. &ldquo;Is it a
  go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; declared Lance, taking the proffered money.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do when I get to Tucson?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be on the main highway. Stop at the first service
  station on the edge of town. Right-hand side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t meet you someone else will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose these holdup gents take the truck away from me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be your loss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; interposed the sallow-faced Dipper, &ldquo;this husky
  bird is packin&rsquo; a rod.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, are you telling me? I hope he turns cowboy with it on those
  dopes.... Buddy, if you turn this trick there&rsquo;ll be more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This one doesn&rsquo;t strike me so hot,&rdquo; declared Lance,
  tersely. &ldquo;But one at a time. I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As Lance strode off, carefully pocketing the money he heard Uhl say:
  &ldquo;Dip, if he comes through we&rsquo;ll take him on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No gamble, Boss. That fellow will do....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance passed on out of earshot. At the station he said to the operator:
  &ldquo;That truck ready?&rdquo; Upon being informed that &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
  all set,&rdquo; Lance climbed into the driver&rsquo;s seat and took a look.
  The machine was a fine make. As he moved out of the station yard he observed
  that the big black car had gone. Lance did not look to see what had become of
  it. A block away he turned into the highway and got through Douglas without a
  stop. Once beyond the town he opened up to twenty-five miles an hour and
  faced the north with a grim realization that he was in for an adventure he
  never would have hazarded but for a blonde college girl named Madge who had
  intrigued him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Queer setup,&rdquo; soliloquized Lance, now giving rein to his
  conjectures. &ldquo;I hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye with that crack about Latzy
  Cork.... Racket? Wonder which racket? Cork was suspected of most everything
  up north.... Anyhow I got away with it.... And this Bee Uhl. He&rsquo;s a
  crook all right. From Chi.... I get it. Chicago, of course. He doesn&rsquo;t
  seem to care who knows it. And this big truck must have to do with
  bootlegging. Over the border, maybe. Or up from some harbor on the Gulf....
  Nothing to me. It gets my goat, though, what this slick bozo had to do with
  that girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance reflected presently that he ought to have that circumstance
  mastered. Madge&rsquo;s own words testified to that. She had flirted with
  Uhl, obviously for the thrill of it. She certainly knew he was a gangster.
  Perhaps that was the secret. A girl like her must be besieged by admirers,
  importuned and bored until she was tired of them. Still Uhl was handsome, and
  perhaps his hard and insolent way might have appealed to the girl. Assuredly
  that had been the inception of the affair. Lance felt glad to convince
  himself that she had realized her mistake, and in a thoroughbred but kindly
  way had made it clear to Uhl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what in the hell did <i>she</i> want to fall for a guy like
  that?&rdquo; bit out Lance, jealously. &ldquo;Oh, be yourself, Lance!&rdquo;
  Just because this Majesty, the student Rollie had called her, happened to be
  the loveliest and most fascinating girl Lance had ever met, was no reason for
  him to think her on the plane of the angels.</p>

  <p>Lance did not need to bring back the vision of her. That was limned on his
  memory. No use faking it, he thought&mdash;he had fallen in love with her at
  first sight. That was all right. But he wished the thought and beauty and
  charm of her would not stick so tenaciously. He could not banish her and
  again came the regret that he had not stood right out like a man to meet her
  that day. He could at least have spared her the encounter with Uhl.</p>

  <p>All at once Lance had a disturbing thought. Uhl, gangster, racketeer,
  bootlegger, might have another slant to his crookedness. He might be a
  kidnaper. That seemed reasonable enough, and the idea grew on Lance. The girl
  must belong to a rich California family. Her style, her patrician air, her
  talk of a ranch full of Arabian horses, surely these attested wealth. And
  that might explain Bee Uhl&rsquo;s interest in her. With the near approach of
  repeal of prohibition these bootleggers must work up other rackets. Already
  there had been a nationwide activity in kidnaping.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goofy or not, I take it as a hunch,&rdquo; muttered Lance, with
  finality. &ldquo;Believe me, I&rsquo;ll get a line on that slicker with his
  roll of centuries, if I can.&rdquo; And in the stress of the moment Lance
  thought that if he did verify such suspicion of the gangster, it would not be
  beyond him to go back to Los Angeles to warn the girl. Then the realization
  of his sudden tumult of delight made him look aghast at himself. &ldquo;Quit
  your romancing, kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is hard pay. And I&rsquo;m
  on a job I should have passed up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But nothing he thought or reasoned out changed the essential sentiment and
  presagement of the situation. The way accidents and circumstances fell across
  his path and what came of them had taught him to believe any strange and
  far-reaching adventure could befall him.</p>

  <p>Cars and trucks going and coming passed Lance now and then, the southbound
  traffic being the heavier. Lance did not see the big black automobile
  belonging to Uhl. Once he looked back down a league-long stretch, half
  expecting to discover the car following. But he did not.</p>

  <p>Driving a truck did not permit of close attention to the desert scenery,
  which had been his pleasure while riding Umpqua. However, that labor and his
  concentration on the peculiar circumstances leading to this ride, certainly
  made the time fly. Almost before he knew it, he was climbing the tortuous
  grade through Bisbee, keeping keen lookout for the holdup he had been told to
  expect. About midafternoon he went through picturesque Tombstone on the
  outskirts of which he halted for gasoline. This necessitated his breaking the
  hundred dollar bill Uhl had given him. The service station man, a westerner
  of middle age, glanced from the bill to Lance with keen blue eyes.
  &ldquo;Seen bills like this before&mdash;an&rsquo; also that truck
  you&rsquo;re drivin&rsquo;. How aboot yore company?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t savvy,&rdquo; returned Lance, gruffly. &ldquo;What you
  mean by company?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, usually thar&rsquo;s two or three trucks like this one strung
  along. Reckon you&rsquo;re new to...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To what, mister?&rdquo; interrupted Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo;,&rdquo; responded the operator, in
  cool evasion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Well, as a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m damn new at this
  job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That little wordy byplay roused Lance anew to the possibilities that might
  be thickening ahead of him. Thereafter he kept keen as a whip, increasing his
  speed a little. It was almost dark when he passed Mescal, a desert hamlet,
  and he did not halt to appease thirst or hunger. He wanted to get this job
  over. The desert night was soft and balmy, cooling as the radiation of the
  day&rsquo;s heat passed away. Jackrabbits and coyotes leaped across the road,
  gray in the flash of his lamps. The headlights of cars grew from pin points
  in the blackness to yellow orbs, rushing at him and passing by, to leave the
  distant road dark again. The dry odor of dust and desert growths clogged his
  nostrils. Under favorable circumstances Lance would have liked closer
  acquaintance with that desert. The spectral arms of cactus and the dense
  thickets of mesquite accentuated the lonesomeness.</p>

  <p>Some miles beyond Vail there appeared to come a brightening to the north.
  Soon Lance made that out to be the lights of Tucson, miles away still, but
  clear in the rarefied atmosphere. Lance rolling along at forty miles or more
  an hour, began to feel an edge for the expected holdup. Every time he caught
  the gleam of headlights behind he prepared for the order to halt. But so many
  cars passed him the next hour and so bright grew the illuminated horizon that
  he began to believe he might reach the first service station on the right
  without being stopped.</p>

  <p>Presently a car came up behind and held its place for a couple of miles.
  Lance anticipated that this was the one, and he forced himself to be ready.
  He slowed down to thirty, then to twenty. The car kept behind him, somewhat
  to the left. At length it slipped up alongside Lance. &ldquo;Hey, you driver.
  Halt!&rdquo; rang out a hoarse voice. Lance shut off, and applying the
  brakes, screeched to a stop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Stick &rsquo;em up!</i>&rdquo; came from the car. A flashlight
  blinded Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; he yelled, complying with the order.</p>

  <p>Two men leaped out and a door clicked. The car moved on ahead to come to a
  standstill in front of the truck. Lance&rsquo;s door was jerked open. Light
  flooded his cab. Over an extended gun he caught indistinct sight of two
  faces, the foremost of which was masked. Lance heard footsteps running back
  behind his truck and the clank of bolts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, j&rsquo;ever see this one before?&rdquo; queried the bandit
  with the gun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. Another new one,&rdquo; came the laconic answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; followed the demand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arizona cowpuncher,&rdquo; replied Lance. &ldquo;Broke. Agreed to
  drive this truck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who hired you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Five men in a black car at Douglas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From behind clanked the hinge and there was a slap of canvas.
  &ldquo;Empty, by God!&rdquo; cried a hoarse voice, in anger. Footsteps
  preceded the appearance of two more men, one of whom Lance managed to
  distinguish despite the blinding flashlight. &ldquo;Henny, we&rsquo;re
  tricked. He&rsquo;s made suckers out of us again. This truck is
  empty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, hell no!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, hell yes! It&rsquo;s a cattle car. As late as yesterday, when
  we picked them cars up, this one was full of steers. The other one had
  the...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; yapped the leader, pounding his gun on the door.
  &ldquo;Hey, driver, how many trucks like this have you lamped
  lately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Off and on I&rsquo;ve seen a good many,&rdquo; rejoined Lance,
  glibly. &ldquo;Three in a row day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; which way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;North, out of Douglas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah-ha! I <i>told</i> you, Henny,&rdquo; yelled the enraged bandit.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll all come back full of steers. He&rsquo;s took
  to buyin&rsquo; steers. What you think of that? In the cattle bizness. A
  blind. Ha! Ha! An&rsquo; it made a sucker out of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Driver, is there a short cut to El Paso without goin&rsquo; through
  Douglas?&rdquo; queried the leader, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, at Benson,&rdquo; replied Lance, readily. &ldquo;Poor road,
  but passable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The leader snapped off his flashlight. &ldquo;Beat it, cowboy, wherever
  you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; tell your boss we&rsquo;re onto his
  racket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Henny, if there&rsquo;s a short cut, no matter how bad, we might
  head off that car,&rdquo; rasped the man Bud. He had a bitter raucous voice
  that Lance would remember. The four bandits ran to pile into their car.
  &ldquo;Turn an&rsquo; step on it!&rdquo; ordered the leader. In another
  moment their car was roaring east on the highway, and Lance had a clear road
  ahead. Relieved, and more interested than ever, he threw in his clutch and
  sped on toward Tucson. Lance saw that he had been used merely to throw this
  gang off the track. The cattle slant to the business seemed a trick that
  would take more than one carload of bandits to beat.</p>

  <p>The run from that lonely stretch of road to the service station designated
  was accomplished in short order, Lance driving at a fast clip. The truck
  appeared to ooze along as smoothly as a limousine. Hardly had Lance come to a
  halt in the station yard when two men in dark garb, slouch hats pulled down,
  hurried out to meet him. Lance was ready for them, and opening the door he
  stepped out with a long whew of relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello. Am I glad to see you? Take her away,&rdquo; he said,
  vociferously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dey stick you up?&rdquo; queried one, tensely, while the other
  leaped into the seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. About five miles out. You should have heard Bud and Henny
  cuss to find her empty. I gave them a bum steer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? An&rsquo; how bum?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They asked me if there was a short cut to El Paso and I told them
  yes, at Benson. I heard it was some road. They&rsquo;ll get lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;ll go hot with the boss. How much&rsquo;d you dole out
  for gas? He forgot thet, an&rsquo; told me to square it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance named the sum, which was handed to him in a five dollar note and no
  change wanted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blick, have we got all night?&rdquo; demanded the man in the
  driver&rsquo;s seat. &ldquo;Cut it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep your shirt on. Honey Bee gave me an order, didn&rsquo;t he?...
  Driver, yer come through clean. I&rsquo;m to tell you thet if you&rsquo;re
  hangin&rsquo; round Douglas next run, you can get another job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell. I&rsquo;ll hang around, if it&rsquo;s not too long.
  When&rsquo;s the next run?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Mebbe in a month&mdash;mebbe longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When they had gone Lance went into the service station, aware that his
  arrival and the short conference had been observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How far to a hash joint? I&rsquo;m sure starved,&rdquo; he began,
  genially.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stranger hereabouts?&rdquo; the man returned, with a keen look.
  &ldquo;Plenty grub places up the street.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. Yes, I&rsquo;m a stranger. And I don&rsquo;t mind telling
  you I drove that truck because I was broke. I was held up out here and scared
  stiff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say. Well, that&rsquo;s not strange
  considerin&rsquo; the company. You got off lucky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? What was I up against?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever see that truck before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep, an&rsquo; some more like it. They been comin&rsquo; and
  goin&rsquo; every six weeks or so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cattle business must be good when steers get hauled in
  trucks,&rdquo; commented Lance; then waiting a moment for an answer, which
  did not come, he strode up the street. In the middle of the second block he
  found a café, where he obtained his supper. At the next corner there was a
  hotel. Inquiry brought the information that he could take a bus early next
  morning for Douglas. Then he went to bed. Events of the day had been
  thought-provoking, but they did not keep him awake.</p>

  <p>On the bus the following morning, however, he had nothing to do but think.
  It took Lance practically all that long ride to reason out the futility of
  any further interest in Uhl. Lance did not want to drive any more
  questionable trucks. Aside from an interesting experience, this meeting with
  Uhl had no warrant to absorb him. It was the singular connection with the
  college girl that kept him wondering and conjecturing, and thinking that he
  should warn her somehow. But he did not even know her last name. And to go
  back to Los Angeles on such a fanciful assumption seemed absurd. Nevertheless
  his conscience bothered him. That passed, however, leaving Lance with only
  the increasing pang of regret. When at Douglas he went out to see Umpqua, and
  quite provokingly he conceived a picture of Madge on his beautiful horse, he
  almost gave way to rage at his sentimentality. All the same, thought of the
  girl persisted, and Lance finally reconciled himself to being haunted.</p>

  <p>Riding northeast from Douglas the Arizona desert land magnified its
  proportions of color and wildness and rugged grandeur to such a degree that
  Lance was loath to travel on and turn his back to ranges that dwarfed those
  he had ridden in Oregon. What a grand country he was entering! Ahead of him
  were mountains, peaked and lofty, purple in the distance, growing black and
  gray as league after league he neared them. Lance took his time stopping to
  ask questions, but the several little hamlets along the way failed to yield
  much information. He spent one night at Chiricahua, which town appeared to be
  in the center of a vast green and gray range surrounded by mountains. He had
  begun to see cattle in considerable numbers, though not one hundredth as many
  as the country might have supported. He rode on and on over a rolling and
  lovely valley.</p>

  <p>Darkness overtook Lance. He had inquired at Apache about towns farther
  north. He had been told they were few and far between. It looked as though
  his preoccupation with the solitude and beauty of this upland valley was
  going to make him spend a night in the open. He did not mind that. The day
  had been hot and the night still remained warm. However, three hours after
  sunset he sighted lights ahead and soon entered a place called Bolton. Unlike
  most of the other towns, this one appeared to be comparatively new and
  located on both highway and railroad. There was a wide main street with
  bright lights and many parked cars, stores and cafés, a hotel and an inn, a
  bank and motion-picture theater. Lance rode on through to the outer zone of
  garages and autocamps. Umpqua, staunch as he was, had begun to tire. Lance
  was pleased to see several horses tethered beyond a garage off the main
  street, and next a livery stable. The garage, evidently, also provided the
  facilities of a service station and was quite modest compared to showy places
  Lance had passed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, cowboy,&rdquo; drawled a pleasant voice. &ldquo;Git down
  an&rsquo; come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, yourself,&rdquo; replied Lance, greeting a sturdy bow-legged
  young man who had appeared from somewhere. There was enough light to make out
  a lean tanned face from which shone narrow slits of eyes, keen and
  friendly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd!&mdash;Where&rsquo;d you steal thet hawse?&rdquo; queried
  this individual.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me or is that the way horsemen are greeted
  here?&rdquo; asked Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore kiddin&rsquo;, cowboy. We got some grand hawses in this
  country an&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s why I got fresh. But on the level where did
  you find him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oregon bred. He was given us when he was a colt. And I raised
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You from Oregon?&rdquo; went on the other, walking around the horse
  in a way that betrayed a love of horseflesh. It was an open sesame to
  Lance&rsquo;s friendliness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, rode him all the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell. I&rsquo;ll be dog-goned.... Wal, lookin&rsquo;
  him over I ain&rsquo;t so surprised. All hawse, cowboy, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d
  trade you my garage for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds cowboy,&rdquo; laughed Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore I was&mdash;I <i>am</i> a cowboy. Been ridin&rsquo; Arizona
  ranges all my life. But these hard times I had to make a livin&rsquo; for my
  mother an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s bad news. I came to Arizona to find a job with
  some cattle outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;re jest outa luck. Cowboys air scarce these days. As
  scarce as jobs. Plenty of cattle all through heah. An&rsquo; the outfits
  thinned down to two or three riders. My job for three years before this
  bust-up hit us was with Gene Stewart. Finest rancher in these parts. Used to
  run eighty thousand haid. But of late years Gene has lost out. An&rsquo; as I
  couldn&rsquo;t ride no more for nothin&rsquo; I had to take this place. Pays
  fair, but I just hate it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame you.... How about me bedding down Umpqua in this
  livery stable?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Umpqua?</i> What a name! Where&rsquo;n hell did you git
  thet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Indian. Name of a river in Oregon. Means
  swift.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell handle at thet. Shore, this stable is okay. I&rsquo;ll go in
  with you.... What&rsquo;d you say your name was? Mine&rsquo;s Ren
  Starr.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say yet. It&rsquo;s Lance Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Air you gonna hang about heah a spell?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if I can find work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The livery stable man turned out to be an old fellow with an unmistakable
  cattle range air about him. He was almost as enthusiastic over Umpqua as
  Starr had been. For the first time in a long while Lance began to feel at
  home with his kind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ump, old boy, this barn smells good, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
  Lance, and giving his pet a parting smack he went out with Starr.
  &ldquo;Where can I eat and sleep?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Several places, but outside the hotel, you&rsquo;ll like Mrs.
  Goodman&rsquo;s café. Nice woman, dotes on cowboys, an&rsquo; runs a swell
  little chuck house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me? I&rsquo;d like to talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, shore. I&rsquo;ve had my supper. But I can always eat.
  An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s closin&rsquo; time for my place anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently Lance was ushered into a clean fragrant little shop, with more
  of a homey than a café look, and introduced to a portly woman of kind and
  genial aspect. Evidently she had a warm spot in her heart for cowboys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Oregon, I&rsquo;d shore like to see you stop heah,&rdquo; said
  Starr, eagerly. Manifestly he had taken to Lance as Lance had to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the way up from Apache I&rsquo;ve liked the range more and
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell, this ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;. You ought to see thet range
  down along the west slope of the Peloncillo Mountains. Swell deer an&rsquo;
  antelope huntin&rsquo;. Bear an&rsquo; cougar up high. Trout fishin&rsquo;,
  oh boy! Grass an&rsquo; sage ranges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds more than swell. Is that where your Gene Stewart runs
  cattle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Used to, when he had ten outfits. But now he&rsquo;s only got about
  a thousand haid left, not countin&rsquo; yearlin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; calves. He
  jest lets them graze around his ranch, with a couple of Mexican kids
  ridin&rsquo; for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How far away is his ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon about thirty by trail. The road runs round an&rsquo; up
  an&rsquo; down. Cars register forty-two miles. No road work this spring makes
  tough goin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t mean mebbe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonder what chance I&rsquo;d have getting on with him? Wages no
  object for a while. I want to ride open country, and have a square meal
  often, with pasture for Umpqua. You see he was raised to fare for himself.
  Alfalfa and grain would spoil him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My idee of trainin&rsquo; a hawse right.... I&rsquo;ll tell you,
  Sidway, there&rsquo;s a pretty shore chance for you out with Gene. He needs
  riders most damn bad. I&rsquo;ll give you a note to him in the mawnin&rsquo;.
  Thet&rsquo;ll cinch it, if you really want a job for nothin&rsquo;
  &rsquo;cept board. He&rsquo;ll be glad. Only you gotta approach him sorta
  careful.... Sensitive fellow, Gene is, but the salt of this range. For two
  bits I&rsquo;ll sell out an&rsquo; go with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be swell. Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be all right with Mom. She wants to get out of this hot
  country for a while. But I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; money an&rsquo; I reckon I
  ought to save plenty before hittin&rsquo; the trail again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Ren. Thanks for the hunch. I&rsquo;ll go. Maybe we can
  see each other sometimes. I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me too. Shore we can. Gene would give you a Sunday off now
  an&rsquo; then. I&rsquo;d run out after you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of ranch does Stewart own?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! I reckoned every puncher in the West had heahed of it.
  Close to the border. Used to belong to a Mexican named Don Carlos. He was
  shot long before I come to this part of Arizona. I was hardly borned then.
  But I&rsquo;ve heahed the story. Durin&rsquo; the Mexican Revolution around
  twenty-five years ago Don Carlos had thet ranch. It was a Spanish grant.
  An&rsquo; he was sellin&rsquo; contraband along the border. Gene Stewart was
  a tough cowboy them days. Great with the rope an&rsquo; hawse&mdash;a daid
  shot&mdash;an&rsquo; nerve, say! they didn&rsquo;t come no cooler than thet
  <i>hombre</i>. Wal, he joined up with the revolutionists. They called him
  <i>El Capitan</i>. After Madero was assassinated Gene come back heah. About
  thet time a rich girl from Noo Yoork come along. She bought Don Carlos&rsquo;
  Ranch. Stillwell, the foreman then, corralled the hardest bunch of cowboys
  thet ever rode a range. But nobody could boss them until he put Gene on the
  job. They run Don Carlos an&rsquo; his band off the range. An&rsquo; they
  made thet ranch the finest in the West. It&rsquo;s as beautiful as ever, but
  turrible run down these last two years... Wal, Gene married his boss, the
  rich girl from the East, an&rsquo; was thet a romance!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darned interesting, Ren. I&rsquo;m going to like
  Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shore will, an&rsquo; if you turn out as good as you
  look&mdash;excuse me bein&rsquo; personal&mdash;Gene is goin&rsquo; to cotton
  to you. He was grand to me. An&rsquo; I just love him as if he was my dad. He
  always stops in to see me, hopin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll come back. But he never
  says so. He was in town today, worried plain about somethin&rsquo;! He said
  it was only cause he was losin&rsquo; a few cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cattle thieves?&rdquo; exclaimed Lance, quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rustlers over heah, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. There&rsquo;s still some rustlin&rsquo; all over.
  Nothin&rsquo; heah like it used to be. But you see a dozen haid to Gene now
  means more&rsquo;n a thousand, years ago. He was sore because he
  couldn&rsquo;t find out how the cattle was stole. An&rsquo; old Nels, the
  last of thet great outfit of cowboys, couldn&rsquo;t find out
  either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too old-fashioned, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone, Sid. I had thet very idee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Starr,&rdquo; spoke up Lance, as if with an inspiration.
  &ldquo;Not so many days ago I drove a big truck from Douglas to Tucson. It
  was empty but it had been full of steers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance related briefly the circumstances that made it necessary for him to
  earn some money, but he did not go into detail about the men he had met on
  that adventure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m a son-of-a-gun!... What kind of a truck?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A big one, fine make, and canvas-covered. I took the license number
  and the name of the owner. Which I suspect is not the name of the right
  owner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; things,&rdquo; rejoined Starr,
  growing cool after his excitement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen three or four
  trucks like thet one pass heah every month or so. One went through north four
  days ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you pay any particular attention to it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Only saw it an&rsquo; was sore as usual &rsquo;cause the driver
  got gas from one of the other stations. You see them fellers never have
  bought a gallon of gas from me. Thet&rsquo;s okay, shore. My place is as you
  saw it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Starr, they passed you up because you were a cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! Thet&rsquo;s an idee. A hot one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something I heard on my drive gives me a hunch now that these
  truckmen bought cattle as a blind. Perhaps of late they <i>steal</i> cattle.
  All kinds of business pretty punk these days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard, you are a whiz,&rdquo; ejaculated Starr, intensely.
  &ldquo;Rackin&rsquo; my haid I figger thet I haven&rsquo;t seen them trucks
  go through heah <i>southbound</i> since last fall. They do go through, shore.
  I been told thet. But late in the night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We got something to work on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should smile. I&rsquo;ll grow curious as hell. Sid, this heah is
  goin&rsquo; to be most damn interestin&rsquo; to Gene. You tell him pronto.
  All about them trucks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. And, Starr, if I get in with Stewart I&rsquo;ll send you
  the receipt and money to send for my baggage in Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to fetch it out.... Wal, I reckon you ought to hit the hay.
  Your eyes look tired. Come on an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll take you to the hotel.
  Most as reasonable as autocamps, an&rsquo; good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the way across the street Starr said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s shore a lot
  to tell you about Stewart, his ranch an&rsquo; all. But I cain&rsquo;t think
  of everythin&rsquo; all to oncet.... You&rsquo;ll find Mrs. Stewart jest
  swell. Still handsome an&rsquo; the nicest woman! I most forgot their
  daughter. No wonder, &rsquo;cause I haven&rsquo;t seen her for nearly four
  years. She was only a kid then. But could she cock her eye at a man? Had all
  the cowboys dotty. <i>Me!</i> I reckoned I had the inside track &rsquo;cause
  she let me kiss her oncet. But I was wrong, Sid. Thet girl was a
  hells-rattler, but straight as a string. Jest full of fem.... Wal, Gene told
  me today thet she was comin&rsquo; home. He was plumb excited over thet.
  Worships the girl! An&rsquo; mebbe he was worryin&rsquo; about her too....
  Sid, if I remember thet girl she will keep you awake nights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; declared Lance with a laugh. &ldquo;Boy,
  I&rsquo;ve been in Hollywood for a spell, hobnobbing with the prettiest and
  slickest girls in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hollywood? My Gawd, what&rsquo;ll you spring on me next? Sid, you
  are goin&rsquo; to relieve the tedium of my days.... Did you fall for any of
  them stars?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, I fell with a dull thud for three. And not stars, either. Just
  extras prettier than the stars. Harder every fall! And I can&rsquo;t imagine
  <i>me</i> falling for a ranch girl. No offense, boy. My sister is a ranch
  girl and she&rsquo;s my pride. <i>But</i> you can get what I mean, if you go
  to the flickers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean movies? I go every show an&rsquo; sometimes
  twice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you know how safe I&rsquo;ll be on an Arizona
  ranch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Safe out heah, <i>if</i> she doesn&rsquo;t come home, which I
  don&rsquo;t believe she will? Pard, I wouldn&rsquo;t gamble on thet.... Wal,
  heah&rsquo;s your hotel. I&rsquo;ll be sayin&rsquo; <i>adios</i> till
  mawnin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m shore glad we met, Lance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So am I, Ren. It&rsquo;s just swell. See you early tomorrow.
  Don&rsquo;t forget to write that note to Stewart. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance went to bed glowingly excited and satisfied with the day&rsquo;s
  happenings, and its promise. Particularly was he pleased at finding the
  ex-cowboy, Starr. Lance thought he would be a fellow to tie to. Luck had
  attended this adventuring into a new and far country.</p>

  <p>After an early breakfast next morning Lance made his first Arizona
  purchases, which consisted of a new riding outfit, and a much needed shaving
  kit and several other articles. His discarded things he tied in his old coat,
  so that he could carry the bundle conveniently on his saddle. When he
  presented himself at Starr&rsquo;s garage, that worthy stared in comical
  surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo; Sid,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;What you been about?
  All dolled up. My Gawd! I hadn&rsquo;t no idee you was such a handsome
  galoot. On thet hawse you&rsquo;ll knock &rsquo;em cold. Say! I&rsquo;ve a
  hunch you&rsquo;ve either seen or heahed about Gene Stewart&rsquo;s
  daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope, I haven&rsquo;t. But I needed some clean duds and a
  shave,&rdquo; explained Lance. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ask for a job looking
  like a tramp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so shore, Sid,&rdquo; returned Starr, doubtfully.
  &ldquo;Gene likes &rsquo;em tough. Why, with thet red scarf an&rsquo; all you
  look like Buck Jones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, I bought the least gaudy outfit that storekeeper had,&rdquo;
  protested Lance. &ldquo;If you think I should change back to...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, I was half kiddin&rsquo;. You look okay. In fact you look
  grand. But no cowpuncher can fool Gene Stewart. He&rsquo;ll see right through
  you, Sid. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bet my shop he&rsquo;ll take to you same as I
  did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, what the hell...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s it. What the hell will come off if you run plumb into
  Gene&rsquo;s daughter? She&rsquo;s on her way home. Gene told my mother so
  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you certainly harp on that subject. Is the heart of Miss
  Stewart all you&rsquo;re concerned with?&rdquo; queried Lance,
  facetiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no! I&rsquo;m jest concerned about what&rsquo;ll happen to
  you, if she sees you. An&rsquo; in this new outfit you shore stand out from
  the landscape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like all the Arizona cowboys, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; went on
  Lance. &ldquo;Oh, I knew a lot of them in Hollywood. Swell fellows, but
  simply nuts on jokes and tricks and girls!... Next to that they liked to
  gamble. I&rsquo;ll bet you five bucks <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t even see your
  Arizona cowgirl queen.... Man, I&rsquo;ve lived in Hollywood for over a
  year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you told me before,&rdquo; replied Starr, dryly. &ldquo;Thet
  bet&rsquo;s on. Heah&rsquo;s your note to Gene Stewart. I shore hope you turn
  out half as good as my recommendation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Ren. I hope I make good. Now tell me how to find this
  wonderful ranch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go out the highway, south, of course. Take the first
  road&mdash;it&rsquo;s a dirt road&mdash;turnin&rsquo; left. Stick on thet for
  about five miles, till you come to a bridge over a crick. Lots of green
  willows. Anyway, it&rsquo;s the first bridge you come to, so you cain&rsquo;t
  miss it. There&rsquo;s a trail thet follers the crick, on the right-hand
  side. Hit thet trail, pard, an&rsquo; good luck to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll I know the ranch when I come to it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! it&rsquo;s the only ranch out there. The house, old Spanish
  style, sets on a knoll among trees. Walls used to be white. But you can see
  it from the divide, ten miles away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>In very short order Lance was out of Bolton on a road that seemed to climb
  and lose itself in gray obscurity. Umpqua, scenting something out there, the
  sage and the open, perhaps, settled down to his fast ground-gaining trot.
  Lance saw on his right where the highway, a shining ribbon, followed the
  railroad and line of telegraph poles off to the southwest across the desert.
  On his left, beyond the green willows bordering the brook, an occasional
  humble ranch, or adobe Mexican house, gave life to a range gradually growing
  wilder as he proceeded. Ahead of him on the horizon mountain ranges stood up,
  some bold, others dim. Lance&rsquo;s quick eye caught sight of romping jack
  rabbits and sneaking coyotes, and the white rumps of deer-like animals he
  concluded were antelope.</p>

  <p>Eventually the trail left the brook. Dwarf cedar trees and a line of pale
  purple marked the zone of sage. Lance was familiar with Oregon and California
  sage, but neither had the luxuriance and fragrance of this Arizona brand.
  Umpqua manifestly liked the smell of it. There seemed to be a tang and a zest
  in this clear air. The sun became hot on Lance&rsquo;s back; heat veils arose
  like smoke from the ground; the peaks that had been sharp against the blue
  appeared to dim in haze. Down to the right, toward the road Lance could still
  see, herds of cattle dotted the gray. The trail, however, headed more to the
  left, toward rising land, and rugged bits of outcropping rocks red in color,
  and back clumps of cedars.</p>

  <p>By noonday Lance calculated that he had covered at least twenty miles, two
  thirds of the distance to Stewart&rsquo;s ranch; and soon he had surmounted
  the divide Starr had mentioned. The scene was so splendid that Lance halted
  to gaze and gaze spellbound. He saw a moving dust line from a car creeping
  across this vast gray-purple bowl under him which must be the southern end of
  Bernardino Valley. Rocky areas and clumps of cedars and darker patches of
  trees relieved the monotony of that range, sweeping away and upward to the
  mountains that must be the Peloncillos. Then Lance&rsquo;s keen eyes sighted
  the forested knoll and the old Spanish mansion built by Don Carlos. Ten miles
  away still, it appeared to stand out with a magnificence that Starr had
  hinted of. A lake, blue as a gem, shone in the sun, and its circle of green
  let out a branch that wound down across the gray, to make a wide bend around
  the rocky ridge Lance had surmounted. This, of course, was the stream he had
  encountered below. It was a big country. How vast this country must be when
  here lay only a mountain-walled valley! Heading down the trail Lance thought
  gravely, yet somehow with exaltation, that he was won forever. He would find
  or make a home there, and felt that he owed Ren Starr infinite gratitude.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>By midafternoon Lance rode into a pretty little Mexican village at the
  foot of the knoll. Columns of blue smoke arose slowly. The half-naked
  children, the burros and dogs, the natives in colored raiment watching idly
  from the low porches, all appeared to have a leisurely air. Lance ventured a
  question to one group. An exceedingly pretty Mexican girl, whose big dark
  eyes shone bright and roguishly upon Lance replied to him: &ldquo;<i>Buenos
  dias, señor.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No savvy. Can&rsquo;t you talk United States?&rdquo; asked Lance,
  mildly, smiling at the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, cowboy, Mr. Stewart is home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, <i>señorita</i>. I think I&rsquo;m going to like it
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her dusky eyes snapped with mischief, and quick as their flash she
  retorted: &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take you long, <i>señor</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Riding away up the gentle slope Lance cogitated that remark of the Mexican
  lass&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Say! what did she mean? Can&rsquo;t make out, but sure
  she was kidding me. Some little peach! Okay by me, <i>señorita</i>.
  I&rsquo;ll be seeing you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance had not proceeded beyond where the road turned up the wooded knoll
  when a boy overtook him to inform him that <i>Señor</i> Stewart was at the
  corrals, toward which he pointed. Lance threw him a quarter, and kept to the
  right along the base of the knoll, to come at length into view of log barns
  and sheds and corrals, a long mossy-roofed bunkhouse, old and weathered,
  picturesquely falling to decay. A piercing whistle from an unseen horse
  brought a snort from Umpqua. Lance rode down a lane of tumble-down poles, to
  turn into a kind of court, at the immediate right of which stood a blacksmith
  shop; in front of this were several Mexican riders, and a thoroughbred black
  horse so glossy and well-groomed that he did not appear to belong there. Then
  a tall white man stepped out from behind the horse. He had a superb build, a
  dark intent face, deeply lined, piercing dark eyes, and there was white hair
  over his temples. Lance did not need to be told that this was Gene Stewart.
  As Lance rode up he caught first a relaxing of this stern face into a smile
  that warmed it attractively, and then a keen interest in both rider and
  horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, cowboy,&rdquo; the rancher greeted Lance, in pleasant deep
  voice. &ldquo;You got the jump on them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who... what?&rdquo; stammered Lance. &ldquo;Are you Gene
  Stewart?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Stewart. And who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway. I want a job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine.... May I ask if you have been recommended by my
  daughter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;indeed, sir,&rdquo; replied Lance, recalling Starr&rsquo;s
  talk, and suddenly filled with dismay. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know your
  daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite possible. But might not her return home today
  have something to do with your asking for a job?&rdquo; asked Stewart, with a
  twinkle in his piercing eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might, judging from the Arizona cowboys I&rsquo;ve met,&rdquo;
  rejoined Lance, recovering coolness at the fun evidently enjoyed at his
  expense. &ldquo;But in my case it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed? Well, in your case then I&rsquo;ll listen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my letter of introduction,&rdquo; went on Lance,
  producing it.</p>

  <p>Stewart opened and read it, suddenly to beam upon Lance. &ldquo;Pard of
  Starr&rsquo;s, eh? You sure can&rsquo;t be all Ren says. But if you&rsquo;re
  anyways near as good...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Stewart,&rdquo; interposed Lance, hurriedly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sailing under false colors. Starr doesn&rsquo;t know me
  any better than you do. Met him only last night! We liked each other right
  off. He told me you might take me on. Offered a letter of
  introduction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s like Ren. Get down and come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance stepped out of the saddle to drop the bridle. Stewart spoke to one
  of the admiring native lads: &ldquo;Pedro, water him and rub the dust off
  him.... Cowboy, you&rsquo;ve a grand horse. I can&rsquo;t see a fault in him.
  Any rancher in the West would give you a job to get a chance to buy him or
  steal him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpqua is swell,&rdquo; replied Lance, as the rancher led him to a
  seat on the porch of what appeared to be a store.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, come out,&rdquo; called Stewart, into the wide-open door of
  the old building. Receiving no answer he said plaintively: &ldquo;Nels must
  be out back with my daughter, looking at her horses. Cowboy, you&rsquo;ll
  have hell keeping that horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; laughed Lance, thrilled at the intimation that
  the rancher might take him on. &ldquo;Any girl who loves horses would want
  Umpqua, naturally. But she&rsquo;ll have to take me with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old-time cowboy spirit! I was that way, once.... Where you
  from?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance briefly told of his home in Oregon, his experience on the ranges
  there, modestly enumerating his abilities and skipping the Hollywood
  experience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of this range and my ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only from Starr. It&rsquo;d be a great place to work. Please give
  me a trial, Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like to,&rdquo; returned the rancher, kindly but
  gravely. &ldquo;Once I had the best and wildest outfit on the border. But
  times have changed.... Starr says in his note that wages are no
  object.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to work for my board.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you rich?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, no! I have a few dollars in my pocket. And Umpqua. Yes, I
  should have said I am rich.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, I couldn&rsquo;t let you work for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But sir, if it&rsquo;s money don&rsquo;t let that keep you from
  hiring me,&rdquo; importuned Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me straight. I&rsquo;ll like you the better if you confess you
  want this job on account of Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge!&mdash;Who&rsquo;s she? Oh, of course, your daughter.... Mr.
  Stewart, on my honor I swear I never heard of her until Starr raved about her
  last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that might have been enough. You&rsquo;re cowboy brand, all
  over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t enough. It wasn&rsquo;t anything. Women are not in
  my troubles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t perjure yourself. Girls are always cowboys&rsquo;
  troubles.... I&rsquo;ll take you on, Sidway, and pay you a few dollars a
  month till the cattle business looks up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll sure do my best for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did Ren mention he might come back to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he did. He wants to. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;ll come, soon as
  he saves a little more money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate to ask him. But with you hard-riding youngsters to help me
  and Danny, and my <i>vaqueros</i> we might save the herd. You see, Sidway,
  there&rsquo;s been some queer rustling....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart was interrupted by a sweet high-pitched voice that came from round
  the corner of the porch, down the lane.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Nels!</i>... For Pete&rsquo;s sake look at this black horse! ...
  Oh, what a beauty!&mdash;Oh! Oh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clinking spurs attested to the slow steps of a rider.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, lass, I never set eyes on thet hawse before,&rdquo; drawled a
  quaint voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll shore hate me when I say he&rsquo;s got
  yore nags beat to a frazzle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&mdash;But he <i>is</i>.... Nels, I want him. I&rsquo;ll
  have him if it costs ten thousand.... Dad! <i>Dad!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart whispered: &ldquo;Step around and tell her here&rsquo;s one horse
  she can&rsquo;t buy. It&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; replied Lance, dubiously. It was his first
  order from his boss. Besides he seemed curiously struck by the situation or
  that sweet voice. As he moved to the corner he heard pattering footsteps.
  Then a vision flashed into sight to plump squarely into his arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she screamed, and staggering, would have fallen had she
  not caught Lance with swift hand. A girl&mdash;bareheaded&mdash;golden hair
  flying&mdash;lovely flushed face, strangely familiar&mdash;violet eyes
  widening, darkening! &ldquo;Who on earth?... <i>You!</i>... Of all the
  miracles! If it isn&rsquo;t my hero!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance recognized her. His girl of the campus adventure and the mad ride
  through the streets of Los Angeles. As she enveloped him, with gay trill, and
  her red lips came up nearer to meet his in a cool sweet kiss, his breast
  seemed to cave in.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS along about sunset when Gene Stewart drove into the
  courtyard of his ranch. The drive out from Bolton, despite the old car, had
  seemed short, and for once he had failed to enjoy the magnificent range that
  he had loved so well for over thirty years. That day the many familiar spots,
  memorable of the wild past, failed to start the old dreams. Even the adobe
  ruins of the Mexican village where Madeline had importuned him to abandon his
  bad habits and come to work for her, failed for once to remind him of the
  turning point, the blessed uplift of his life. Trouble indeed gloomed Gene
  Stewart&rsquo;s eyes when he could not see the sage flat where, bitter and
  hopeless, he had pulled Madeline off her horse, and knowing that she was
  secretly his wife, that though she did not dream of it, she was his, and he
  was leaving her forever, to ride out on his old hard-shooting, hard-drinking
  trail to get himself killed, he had kissed her with the mocking passion of
  renunciation. When Gene, passing the place, did not remember that, though it
  had been over twenty years ago, he was indeed sore distraught with
  worries.</p>

  <p>Nels, the old Texan who was the last of his great riders of that earlier
  and wilder day, sat on the porch of the store, smoking and waiting. Gene
  seemed to see that white head, and the narrow eagle eyes, the lean lined
  face, with a rare and shocking sense of their age. Nels must be close to
  seventy now. And all the West showed its life and havoc under that mild mask
  of tranquillity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;re late, Gene, an&rsquo; come draggin&rsquo; along
  like you was on a bogged hawse,&rdquo; remarked Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, old-timer,&rdquo; replied Gene, wearily, as he sat down on the
  porch, a folded newspaper in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on yore chest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Things have gone from bad to worse, Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heahed from Majesty?&rdquo; queried the old cowman, eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Letter and telegram to me. More for Madeline.... Madge is on her
  way home. For good!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&mdash;Aw! Then nothin&rsquo; can be
  bad,&rdquo; replied Nels, settling back with an air of beautiful relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad news from Madge, Nels. But let that go for the moment. There
  are lesser evils. Lawson has gone into bankruptcy. No hope of the money he
  owes me. I had banked on that. My creditors are pressing. Money must be
  raised.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any better market for cattle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gone down to thirty dollars on the hoof.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I reckon I&rsquo;d sell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the herd?&rdquo; queried Gene, in surprise. Nels would be the
  last cattleman to sacrifice all his stock. There was not in Arizona a keener
  judge of matters pertaining to cattle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Every horn an&rsquo; hide, Gene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that is an unheard of thing for a rancher to do,&rdquo;
  protested Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. How aboot these times? Onheard of, ain&rsquo;t they? Never
  in my life have I seen the like. Lookin&rsquo; far ahaid, Gene, I&rsquo;ll
  predict thet the day of the big cattleman is over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unthinkable!&rdquo; ejaculated Stewart. The idea somehow hurt him.
  &ldquo;What warrant have you for such a prediction?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Government interference, sure as shootin&rsquo;. Then the range
  land grows less an&rsquo; less every year. Last an&rsquo; wust, we already
  have Argentine meat comin&rsquo; heah to the U. S., cheaper than we can raise
  it. Gene, we&rsquo;re in for bum years. I&rsquo;ve got a hunch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I always respected your hunches, Nels,&rdquo; replied Stewart,
  testily. &ldquo;But this seems preposterous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, jest how bad in debt air you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the nerve to figure it up,&rdquo; replied Stewart,
  evasively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if you sold oot at thirty you could pay up, an&rsquo; then
  tide over ontil good times come again. If we live thet long!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might consider selling half my stock,&rdquo; rejoined Stewart,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boss. An&rsquo; you asked my opinion. I forgot to
  tell you thet Danny Mains rode up today. He ain&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; oot with
  his cattle raisin&rsquo;. Been losin&rsquo; too many steers. An&rsquo; Danny
  is afeared thet the Mexicans air doin&rsquo; the stealin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how could a few Mexicans, even if they were crooked, get rid of
  cattle without leaving any sign?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Gene. But there&rsquo;s shore somethin&rsquo;
  doin&rsquo;. All of Bonita&rsquo;s relatives cain&rsquo;t be good. Some of
  them won&rsquo;t be good until they&rsquo;re daid. Danny&rsquo;s got a fine
  wife in Bonita, an&rsquo; shore a dandy girl in their daughter, young Bonita.
  But thet&rsquo;s aboot all. And he&rsquo;s scared of her relatives. Asked me
  plumb oot what to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;d you say, Nels?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I told him to sell. An&rsquo; when he bucked on thet I advised
  him to throw in with you. Then if you hired a couple of good cow hands we
  could beat this game. At least the stealin&rsquo; end. Thet&rsquo;s the
  profit-eatin&rsquo; cussed part of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bad suggestion, Nels. But what&rsquo;d we pay hired cow hands
  with?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, shucks, Gene! It cain&rsquo;t be thet bad with you,&rdquo;
  complained Nels, plaintively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, old-timer. But it <i>is</i>. I hate to face
  Madeline. And especially with this.&rdquo; Stewart unrolled the newspaper he
  had twisted in his hands and spread one over the old cowman&rsquo;s knees.
  Nels took out his glasses, and adjusting them he read slowly:</p>

  <p>COLLEGE CAMPUS RIOT</p>

  <p>CO-ED EXPELLED FOR INCITING RIOT BETWEEN STUDENTS AND POLICE</p>

  <p>&rdquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll be... !&rdquo; he ejaculated, jerking up his fine
  white head. Gene had seen those blue eyes flash fire many a time, though
  hardly ever like this. Nels divined the truth and his affections were
  attacked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Majesty?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m damn sorry to say. But read what it says,
  Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene watched that fine lined face as Nels laboriously read the half column
  in the newspaper. He had seen Nels face death many times and deal it often,
  with never a gray shade creep over his features nor a convulsive quiver, such
  as were visible now for a fleeting instant. And he remembered that it was
  Nels who loved Madge as well as her own father, it was Nels who had long
  years ago named the imperious child Majesty, who had put her upon a horse and
  taught her to ride. Nels folded up the newspaper and handed it back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, I&rsquo;d give somethin&rsquo; to throw a gun on the cuss who
  wrote thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Nels. Are you crazy? This is 1932.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why hell yes! And there&rsquo;s more shootin&rsquo; in the U. S.
  now than when we come first to this range, thirty years ago for you an&rsquo;
  more for me.... He&rsquo;s a damn liar, Gene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who? The writer of this article?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t believe a word of thet dirty part. Aboot her
  bein&rsquo; wild, rich, an&rsquo; as hard a drinker as she was a speed demon.
  Gene, don&rsquo;t you believe thet an&rsquo; fer Gawd&rsquo;s sake,
  don&rsquo;t tell Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of sunk, Nels. Kind of a last blow. I don&rsquo;t
  know what to think. Madge&rsquo;s letter admits it. Honest, right out! And
  her telegrams say she&rsquo;s on the way home to stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! Thet&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heahed fer a long
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is good news, Nels. It hurts, though. Looks kind of like
  disgrace is responsible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw no, Gene. Why, Majesty loves this range, this house where she
  was born. It&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know my own girl,&rdquo; sighed Stewart.
  &ldquo;Remember, Nels, I haven&rsquo;t laid eyes upon Madge for over three
  years. You know I was in Mexico the last time she came home. And the summer
  before that she went to Europe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I have. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gamblin&rsquo; on her, Gene. Wild
  as a young filly, shore she was. But good as gold an&rsquo; as true as steel.
  When she was heah last I had some jars, you bet. I had to figger oot thet
  times had changed since you an&rsquo; me ran after girls. We&rsquo;ve stayed
  right in one spot, Gene, an&rsquo; this old world has moved on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;ll bet you we have it coming to us. Madge said in
  her letter she was having a crowd of college friends come to visit
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. She did thet last time an&rsquo; I never had such
  fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, you&rsquo;re a hopeless old fool. Madge will have you eating
  out of her hand. But I&rsquo;m her father!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gonna have fun oot of you,
  Gene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene slowly walked up the winding green-bordered path toward the ranch
  house. He had not told Nels all his worries. As a matter of fact he was both
  overjoyed at the prospect of Madge&rsquo;s return and greatly dismayed. A
  crowd of college friends!</p>

  <p>Mockingbirds and quail and robins and magpies were rustling and chattering
  in the thick pines. The last rays of the setting sun burned gold on the
  flowering vines and the open weathered walls and arches of the old Spanish
  mansion. The fragrance of roses mingled with that of pine, and the soft sage
  wind from off the range. Gene felt the fact that the grounds, the great adobe
  structure, were more beautiful than ever. But the evidence of decay struck
  Gene most forcibly this evening. The trellises were falling down; the
  planking of the porches had rotted through in places, the weathering of
  plaster showed the adobe bricks.</p>

  <p>Passing through the high archway at the rear of the house, Gene entered
  the patio. It appeared a dusky jungle of dark verdure, running water, drowsy
  twittering of sleepy birds, and odorous fragrance. A savory smell wafted from
  the kitchen where he heard the servants talking in their low voices. When
  Gene crossed the wide porch to enter Madeline&rsquo;s sitting room, the
  newspapers to which Nels had objected did not show among the large quantity
  of mail. Madeline had heard his step on the porch and had come to meet him.
  Love for this patrician woman who as a girl had forsaken the East to make his
  country and his life hers, and pride in her well-preserved beauty and charm,
  seemed to be strong and moving emotions at the moment when these disclosures
  about their only child had to be made. Would Madge be another Madeline? There
  was gray visible in Madeline&rsquo;s hair and lines had begun to show in the
  handsome face. But the light in her lustrous eyes appeared as soft and glad
  as in her youth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene!&rdquo; she exclaimed, kissing him. &ldquo;A whole day
  late!... You look tired&mdash;worried.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Madeline,&rdquo; replied Gene, laying the bundles and
  packets of mail on the table. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m tired&mdash;and worried.
  Bad news, Wife. It never rains but it pours. Lawson failed, Madeline. Gone
  into bankruptcy. No hope of money. I&rsquo;ll have to sell some stock. Nels
  advises selling all my herd.... That&rsquo;s nothing though. I&rsquo;ve got a
  big surprise for you. Madge is coming home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge! Coming home? Why? What has she done now, Gene?&rdquo;
  rejoined Madeline, quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Got herself expelled from college,&rdquo; Gene blurted out, knowing
  that he should have broken the news more gently, but incapable of the guile
  necessary to spare his wife&rsquo;s feelings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Not on the eve of her graduation? June eleventh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s tough, but maybe not so bad as it seems.
  Here&rsquo;s her letter and telegrams to me. Read them before you open
  yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene went into his office, which adjoined the sitting room, turned on the
  lights, and laid all his unopened mail, and some business papers upon his
  table. Then he repaired to his room to wash and change for the evening meal.
  He took plenty of time about this, his thoughts under the dominance of gloom.
  Presently Madeline called him to supper, and he found her in the dining room.
  If he had expected her to be cast down he was agreeably surprised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought to be hungry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Most forgot to eat in
  town.&rdquo; And he asked Madeline questions pertaining to the ranch during
  his absence. Nothing had happened. The drowsy languorous summer had come and
  the tranquil tenor of the lonely range land had not been broken. When Gene
  had finished a hearty meal he suggested that they go into the sitting room
  and get it over.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear, it will never be over until you change your habit of
  mind,&rdquo; she replied, sweetly. &ldquo;You always look upon the dark
  side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madeline, this time of trouble has brought back the Gene Stewart of
  other and darker days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It should not. You have made me perfectly happy for more than
  twenty years. Loss of money, for you and me, is nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madeline, I could take my losses without.... But it&rsquo;s yours
  that distress me. All your life you have had luxury. You were born to it.
  This last year and more you&rsquo;ve been using your money to pad
  Madge&rsquo;s bank account. She keeps overdrawing her income and you keep
  from telling her that her income isn&rsquo;t one with what it was. Now
  through me and that spendthrift girl of ours you must suffer. When the
  depression hit us you should have told Madge the truth. How much her income
  had fallen off. Instead of that you never told her&mdash;made up the
  difference yourself. And she spends hundreds like a drunken cowboy does
  dollars. That is what hurts me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, I expected the shrinking of capital and income would be only
  temporary. I still believe, as my lawyer in New York assures me, that we will
  recover. Madge&rsquo;s capital is intact and eventually her income will grow
  normal. That was a wise provision of Aunt Helen&rsquo;s. Madge can&rsquo;t
  spend the capital. And it doesn&rsquo;t make so great a difference that her
  income has dwindled. But now we should tell her&mdash;if we have the
  courage!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We!&rdquo; expostulated Gene, startled. &ldquo;Not much. Why, I
  don&rsquo;t know Madge since she grew up. When she was seventeen&mdash;before
  she left for college I was scared to death of her. You&rsquo;ll have to tell
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be hard. I&rsquo;m afraid myself of these years she
  has lived away from us. If I had it to do over I&rsquo;d not have sent her
  away to college.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s forget the financial side of it for the present.
  You read her letters and telegrams?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Madge asked me to reserve judgment until I had heard her side.
  Evidently she became involved in some kind of a college row, for which she
  was not responsible, but which resulted in her expulsion. She regretted
  greatly that she could not graduate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was that all? No regret for the&mdash;the disgrace?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She never mentioned disgrace. I don&rsquo;t believe that has
  occurred to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Same old Majesty, eh? She couldn&rsquo;t do any wrong,&rdquo;
  returned Gene, and there was a tinge of bitterness in his tone. &ldquo;What
  else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She said she had invited her college friends to come out here for
  the summer&mdash;for the <i>summer</i>, mind you. That will be after
  graduation. It worries me more than the fact of her being
  expelled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. Tell Madge she can&rsquo;t have her friends this
  summer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could you tell her that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I could,&rdquo; replied Gene, grimly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. That will be a relief. For the rest she wired from L. A.
  she was leaving. And last evening from Yuma. Gene, don&rsquo;t excite
  yourself over probabilities. The fact seems that at that rate she may get
  here tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madeline, it&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be so wonderful to see her again
  that I almost don&rsquo;t care what she&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; replied Gene
  with emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, she&rsquo;s our problem. She&rsquo;s a composite of you and
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madeline, not much of me?&rdquo; implored Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A very good deal of you, her father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose she inherited some of that wild blood of mine?&rdquo;
  ejaculated Gene, aghast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that, there might have never been any
  Madge, darling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord!&mdash;I always said Madge had your beauty, your sweetness,
  your intelligence. But if she&rsquo;s got my old devil in her, too&mdash;come
  out in these modern days of freedom for women&mdash;what, Maddie, what on
  earth can we do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Gene. Love her, trust her. Make her love her
  home. Let us agree on that right here, Gene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I promise, Madeline. But I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So am I. But not the way you are. I&rsquo;m scared of a crowd of
  young college people, just freed from cramping restrictions, let loose upon
  us here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madeline, do you remember your young crowd&mdash;that you had come
  out here from New York just after you bought this place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do,&rdquo; replied his wife, musingly, her eyes shadowed.
  &ldquo;My brother Alfred&mdash;his romance with Flo&mdash;my sister
  Helen&mdash;my best friend Edith Wynne. Oh, they seem so far away&mdash;so
  long ago. But Alfred has been coming back to us for ten years.... Gene, did
  you ever guess that Helen was in love with you&mdash;then, when you were
  <i>El Capitan</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Helen!&mdash;Why, Maddie, you&rsquo;re crazy,&rdquo; protested
  Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s the truth. I never told you. Helen never married,
  you know. And she left her fortune to Madge&mdash;which after all has been
  such a problem&mdash;<i>is</i> so yet.... Gene, if Madge&rsquo;s friends are
  like her, we would have a more exciting summer than that one twenty-three
  years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt of that,&rdquo; growled
  Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If we only had an <i>El Capitan</i> to tame Madge!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maddie, we don&rsquo;t want a wild <i>hombre</i> like he
  was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps no other kind could ever win Madge.... My husband, why do
  you always disparage yourself so bitterly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve failed as a rancher. After raising a herd of eighty
  thousand head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that was not your fault. Who could foresee what would happen to
  the cattle business? Anyway I was referring to your status as the cowboy who
  came&mdash;and conquered.... Gene, my memories are beautiful, always,
  eternally all-satisfying. Even to this day I can dream of that awful ride
  down into Mexico to save you from being shot&mdash;and revel in the sight of
  you striding out, as you supposed, to your execution. To meet
  instead&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;your wife, who you had no idea knew your
  secret!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I find it sweet too, Madeline. The past would be enough for
  me. But there is you&mdash;our home&mdash;and now Madge to think
  of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, it will all come out right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure it will, dear. I&rsquo;m an old croaker. Wish I could be like
  Nels.... You&rsquo;ll want to read your mail. And I&rsquo;ve a lot of papers
  to look over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene left his wife, conscious of a sense of guilt and remorse. He had not
  told her all. The deal with Lawson had been made to raise money to pay a
  mortgage he had secretly placed upon the ranch. Gene had meant to confess
  this, but could not bring himself to it. Nels had sensed that something was
  wrong, though the keen old friend had not dreamed that it was so bad. It was
  insupportable for Gene to think of Madeline and Madge losing this beautiful
  ranch.</p>

  <p>Outside he walked the old familiar path under the cotton woods that had
  been planted there before Don Carlos built the house. The sultry heat of day
  was wafting away; a fragrant incense of flowers and pine needles filled the
  air; the irrigation ditch in its stone-walled vine-covered confines murmured
  on musically like a brook.</p>

  <p>There was strength and help in this environment, and in the solitude that
  hung over it. But there was no comfort in Gene&rsquo;s confession that he had
  not been equipped to cope with these modern days of bewildering changes and
  upsets in business. Nels was a far better cattleman than he. For fifteen
  years there had been too much money to spend, and he had spent instead of
  saving it. Then out of a clear sky, like a thunderbolt, had come the collapse
  of eastern securities, and the bank that had held the rest of
  Madeline&rsquo;s fortune. She did not know how poor they really were. Sober
  reasoning assured Gene that Madge could and probably would save the ranch.
  Nevertheless telling her of the straits he had brought about seemed absurdly
  beyond him. Gene made up his mind to sell two thirds of his stock, pay his
  pressing debts and the interest on the mortgage, then plan and plot somehow
  to save the situation.</p>

  <p>With a mighty effort he threw off the depression, and went back into the
  house, to deceive Madeline with an apparent return of his old cool
  unconquerable spirit, and presently to bed.</p>

  <p>In the morning there had come a change. Whether or not the anticipated
  home-coming of Madge had wrought the magic or a vivid realization of the
  sweetness of life on this glorious June morning, so rich in song of birds and
  blaze of purple range and golden sun, Gene did not know. A good sleep and
  then the light of day always worked wonders.</p>

  <p>Gene found Danny Mains with Nels, having a cup of coffee in the old
  cowboy&rsquo;s bachelor quarters which had been his home for twenty-five
  years. Danny had been one of Gene&rsquo;s wild outfit in those long-past
  prosperous days. His bow legs, his sturdy build had not altered. But
  Danny&rsquo;s homely visage betrayed the havoc of the years.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Boss,&rdquo; he greeted Gene, gladly. Danny had not worked
  for Gene for a whole decade and more, but he always addressed him in the
  cowboy vernacular of rider to his employer. &ldquo;I was comin&rsquo; up.
  Nels an&rsquo; me hev been talkin&rsquo; over my throwin&rsquo; in with you.
  I like the idee, Boss. Are you goin&rsquo; to sell some stock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, you two old <i>hombres</i>,&rdquo; replied Gene,
  cheerfully. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m selling two thirds of my cattle.
  What&rsquo;s your angle on that, Danny?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like it, Boss. If the price is goin&rsquo; up, as Nels figgers, why
  by the time we can round up an&rsquo; drive to the railroad it ought to reach
  thirty-five dollars a haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore it will,&rdquo; drawled Nels, as he sipped his coffee.
  &ldquo;Danny figgers he has aboot seven hundred haid, probably more.
  An&rsquo; he aims to sell half of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, with a lot fewer cattle we can keep count better an&rsquo;
  mebbe stop this queer rustlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s doing it?&rdquo; demanded Gene, angrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I know. I&rsquo;m shore afeared, though, thet
  some of my wife&rsquo;s lazy kin are mixed up in it some way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. So Nels said. That ought to be easy to correct.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes? How&rsquo;n hell can I hang her relatives?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Danny, we don&rsquo;t need to hang them. Just stop them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you knowin&rsquo; greasers for thirty years!... Gene,
  we&rsquo;re growin&rsquo; dotty in our old age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pull out of it, Danny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink on thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I can see you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out for us. Spring
  it pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mighty simple to me,&rdquo; rejoined Nels, thoughtfully.
  &ldquo;Hire a couple of rattlin&rsquo; good cowboys. An&rsquo; with you
  an&rsquo; Danny an&rsquo; the <i>vaqueros</i> heah you can do the job in a
  week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hire two good cowboys, eh? Where? How? What with?&rdquo; queried
  Gene, spreading wide his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sech ain&rsquo;t to be had, Boss,&rdquo; declared Danny,
  hopelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ve an idee,&rdquo; went on Nels. &ldquo;Gene, you
  an&rsquo; Danny open the store while I clean up heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene took the key with its buckskin string attached, and accompanied by
  Danny went out by the long-deserted bunkhouse, across the green toward the
  store. He could hear the whistling of Madge&rsquo;s horses beyond the
  corrals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Danny, I&rsquo;d closed up this store long ago but for Nels,&rdquo;
  said Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Boss, you can&rsquo;t do thet. Why, it&rsquo;d kill the old
  feller. An&rsquo; the store ain&rsquo;t runnin&rsquo; at a loss, is it? All
  the Mexicans deal with Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and they owe him plenty. He must restock. And I just
  can&rsquo;t go deeper in debt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no! We&rsquo;ll do somethin&rsquo;, Boss. I&rsquo;m afraid
  we&rsquo;re down in the mouth. As if I didn&rsquo;t hev enough to pester me
  without thet girl of mine!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bonita?&rdquo; queried Gene, quickly, with a chord of sympathy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Bonita. Boss, I&rsquo;m damn ashamed to confess it, but
  I&rsquo;m afeared she&rsquo;s a no-good little hussy. After all your wife has
  done for Bonita&mdash;educatin&rsquo; her&mdash;makin&rsquo; a lady out of
  her&mdash;why, she&rsquo;s jest cussed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Danny, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bonita has the <i>vaqueros</i> nutty. But she doesn&rsquo;t give a
  damn for one of them. She&rsquo;s white an&rsquo; she runs with the white.
  Ren Starr, you know, was tumble stuck on Bonita. But her flirtin&rsquo;,
  mebbe wuss, I don&rsquo;t know, queered her with him. She goes to town every
  chanct thet comes along. She drinks an&rsquo; Lord knows what. I ought to
  beat the hell out of her. But I jest can&rsquo;t. I love thet kid like I
  loved her mother, Bonita, long ago. You remember, Gene, &rsquo;cause you
  saved Bonita for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember, Danny, old pard. It&rsquo;s tough sledding now for
  us old boys, who can&rsquo;t figure the present and this younger generation.
  ... I&rsquo;ve a daughter of my own, Danny. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s due home
  today or tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty comin&rsquo;? Aw, thet&rsquo;s grand! Why, Boss,
  she&rsquo;ll put the life in us. I&rsquo;m sure glad, Boss. This time you
  gotta make her stay home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make her?&mdash;Danny, didn&rsquo;t you just admit you
  couldn&rsquo;t do anything with Bonita?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. But what the hell has thet got to do with Madge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suspect these girls are precisely the same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord help us, Boss!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene unlocked the rickety door of the old supply store and threw it open.
  The shelves were almost bare. Some print goods, gaudy in color, and glass
  jars of pink and yellow candy, and gewgaws for children, and a spare supply
  of tobacco and cigarettes were about all the stock left for Nels. In the
  wintertime he sat beside the old stove, to smoke his pipe, and feed billets
  of wood to the fire; and to talk about the past when, at rare intervals,
  somebody dropped in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Always makes me think we&rsquo;re living in the past,&rdquo; said
  Gene, coming out to join Danny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Boss, don&rsquo;t talk as if it was all over,&rdquo; returned
  Danny. &ldquo;We got a future.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that juncture Nels appeared behind them, his free clinking stride
  belying his white locks. As he was about to step up on the porch he halted,
  his keen blue gaze fixed beyond the village, far down on the range.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene sighted a streak of yellow dust tailing out behind a motorcar. His
  heart swelled up in his throat to check his utterance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Car. Comin&rsquo; hell-bent fer election!&mdash;Boss, doesn&rsquo;t
  thet remind you of Link Stevens when he used to drive Madeline&rsquo;s white
  car across thet sage flat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve never forgotten Link. A great cowboy who could no
  longer ride! He loved to drive and scare us all stiff. But, Danny, it&rsquo;s
  a cinch Link would turn over in his grave if he could see <i>that</i> car
  coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should smile. Makin&rsquo; seventy miles an hour. On thet road.
  My Gawd, some fellers have nerve! He&rsquo;s young an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t give
  a damn fer his life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonder who it can be?&rdquo; queried Gene, under his breath.
  &ldquo;Important telegrams, I&rsquo;ll bet. Hope it&rsquo;s not bad news.
  Nels, have you a field glass handy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need none, Gene. Thet&rsquo;s Majesty!&rdquo; rang out
  Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Madge!</i>... Say, can you see? Or is it one of your
  hunches?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Both.... Look at thet car streak along! Gene, it shore ought to
  make you feel as young as it does me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young! Man alive, it makes me a doddering old man,&rdquo; replied
  Gene, thickly, and he sat down to relieve shaky legs.</p>

  <p>Somehow he knew that reckless driver was Madge and he wondered why he had
  not grasped the fact at once. At the same instant he had a resurgence of
  pride in the girl&rsquo;s spirit and ability. She could drive&mdash;she could
  ride a horse like an Indian&mdash;she could do anything.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, what color is the car?&rdquo; asked Gene, whose eyes had
  grown dim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Color of a coyote, I reckon. Gene, she had two cars heah last time,
  both of them black, if I recollect.... Dog-gone, but it does my pore heart
  good to see Madge eatin&rsquo; up the miles like thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, you always were an inhuman monster, a bloody gunman,&rdquo;
  declared Gene. &ldquo;How do you suppose it makes <i>me</i> feel to see my
  only child risking her life that way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; interposed Danny, impressively. &ldquo;You an&rsquo;
  me hev a common cause. Nels has no feelin&rsquo;s. I reckon we oughta git
  drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said it, Danny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you fellers air blessed among men,&rdquo; put in Nels.
  &ldquo;Both got purty daughters an&rsquo; you rave aboot yore troubles! I
  wisht to Gawd they was both mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss! Did you see her take thet wash? Must hev forgotten
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking, boys, but I can&rsquo;t see very
  well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nels had walked to the end of the porch. Gene could make out only the
  streaking dust-comet, blurred in his sight. Yet that appeared to grow
  magically closer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, she&rsquo;s off the wust of the road. Be heah in a few shakes
  of a lamb&rsquo;s tail.... It&rsquo;s a low open car&mdash;shiny&mdash;with a
  long front&mdash;a nose like them staghounds Madeline used to
  have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently car and rising dust disappeared under the slope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah thet drone? All the same airplane,&rdquo; shouted Danny.</p>

  <p>Gene heard and thought that his ears had never drunk in such sweet music.
  Madge&mdash;his kid&mdash;his little girl&mdash;his second
  Madeline&mdash;come home for good! He heard Danny babbling in his old cowboy
  manner, and then Nels let out a &ldquo;Kiyi!&rdquo; The drone gave place to
  hum and then a mellow roar. Then like a flash a tan car shot into sight,
  passed the village, to turn left at the fork of the road, and speed out of
  sight up the knoll into the green foliage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, I oughta reckoned on thet,&rdquo; said Nels to himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo; home when you come down,&rdquo;
  added Danny. &ldquo;Welcome Majesty home fer me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I think I&rsquo;ll go up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I should smile.... Tell her my heart ain&rsquo;t as strong as
  it used to be,&rdquo; drawled Nels, with a hand on his breast.</p>

  <p>That jest in earnestness troubled Gene Stewart as he made his way up the
  knoll. The years were flying by. This home-coming of his daughter seemed to
  mark an epoch in his life and Nels&rsquo;, too. The old cowboy had no kin; he
  did not remember his age and he could not have worshiped Madge more if she
  had been his own. Gene fought a disloyal and disturbing thought about Madge.
  If she turned out to be wild and flighty, undutiful!... But he conquered the
  incipient fear. As a child she had been warmhearted, loving, imperious and
  willful as her mother had been. Gene expected to find Madge bewildering, and
  he walked slowly up the shady path, seeking to prepare himself for he knew
  not what. His steps, however, led him inevitably up to the house, through the
  great arch into the patio and on toward the east wing. Before he stepped into
  the flagstone corridor he heard a strange voice, swift and high-pitched,
  sweet and happy. That would be Madge. She was with her mother in the living
  room. Gene took some long strides to reach the wide doorway. He saw Madeline
  in her big armchair with the girl on her lap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... Mom, darling, I am wild with joy to be home. I have forgotten
  nothing. I am drunk with the sage. I am....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then Gene stepped into the room. They heard his step. The girl raised
  a lovely face, flushed and radiant, with great violet eyes that were wet and
  dim. Gene knew her, yet he did not know her. This Madge had golden hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dad!</i>&rdquo; she cried, poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if you are&mdash;Madge,&rdquo; he replied, a little
  huskily.</p>

  <p>She sprang up, taller than he remembered her, and not so slim, to rush at
  him arms spread. She threw them around his neck, and swinging free of the
  floor she hugged him tight. &ldquo;My handsome Dad! My <i>El Capitan</i>!...
  Oh, how&mdash;good to see&mdash;you!&rdquo; And with kisses and incoherent
  words she at last let down her feet, to lean upon him breathlessly. As Gene
  gazed down, his breast congested and his utterance clogged, he saw that her
  long dark lashes lay upon her cheeks, and tears were streaming from under her
  lids.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, is&mdash;is it really you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad&mdash;your bad chicken come home to roost.&rdquo; And she
  opened eyes that were like her mother&rsquo;s, only a deeper, darker blue,
  exquisite in their soft and misty lights. &ldquo;Darling! You&rsquo;ve
  changed somehow. Lines I don&rsquo;t remember.... And this white over your
  temples!&mdash;Mom, what has grieved our <i>El Capitan</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dearest, the years leave their marks,&rdquo; replied Madeline, her
  voice not quite steady.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s handsomer. Can you find me a lover like
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord forbid, Madge!&rdquo; laughed Gene. &ldquo;Now stand away and
  let me look at you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She revolved for his inspection, like the models in fashion shows, and
  from the crown of her golden head to her suede shoes she appeared to be the
  ultimate in grace and beauty, in vivid and intense pulsing life. Then her
  eyes, wide upon him, brought back the child and the girl to prove this lovely
  young woman his own Madge. It was a profound and moving moment for Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, my girl. It is you, yet not you. I recognize your eyes, your
  look, your smile. All else is strange&mdash;especially <i>this</i>.&rdquo;
  And he caressed a waving tress of her golden hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom said almost the same,&rdquo; rejoined Madge, with a laugh.
  &ldquo;Both of you have forgotten your darling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, once your hair was chestnut, like mine before it
  darkened,&rdquo; added her mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, honey bunches, we will waive that question. But really I am
  disappointed. I was sure you&rsquo;d fall for me hard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daughter, if you are one hundredth as good as you are lovely, I
  shall be the happiest father in all the West.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dubious, but eminently satisfactory.&rdquo; Then with striking
  suddenness she changed from gay to grave. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over, my
  darling Mom and Dad.&rdquo; It struck Gene that she addressed both of them
  but looked at him with eyes no man on earth could have doubted. &ldquo;You
  had my letters and wires. I hope you did not see the L. A. papers.... I was
  expelled from college, in disgrace. It was hateful&mdash;the publicity.
  I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t graduate, for your sakes. For mine, I
  don&rsquo;t care in the least. I learned all they gave me and yelped for
  more. I was secretary of the student body and I&rsquo;m a Phi
  Beta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does that mean, Madge?&rdquo; asked Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why Dad!&mdash;To belong to the Phi Beta is one of the highest
  honors any woman can attain in college.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; murmured Madeline, &ldquo;that makes me happy
  indeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, what did they expel you for?&rdquo; queried Gene, stern
  despite his emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, I was indirectly to blame for a riot between the students and
  the police.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indirectly? Does that mean innocently?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It certainly does.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay. Tell us what came off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I like to drive fast and I didn&rsquo;t pay overmuch attention to
  laws and rules,&rdquo; rejoined Madge, frankly. &ldquo;I never had time to
  poke along slowly. Several times I received tickets for speeding. Once after
  that I was in a rush and the officer who caught me happened to be the same
  one. Well, he was a sap, swelled on himself, and by making eyes at him and
  telling him he wouldn&rsquo;t pinch his little co-ed, or some such rot, I
  kept him from taking me to court; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be seeing you,
  sweetie,&rsquo; and the next time he saw me he was fresh. I cut him dead, of
  course. One afternoon I was driving up to college and saw him coming up
  alongside. That time I was not exceeding the speed limit. Nor did I forget to
  put out my hand at the corner, but he accused me of that. He followed,
  calling for me to stop, which I did presently along the side street halfway
  down the campus. It happened in between classes, and there were students
  everywhere. Some of my friends were right there when I stopped. They heard my
  argument with this policeman. And did they take my side? Students came
  running from everywhere. Then I noticed a young fellow in the front line, and
  at first took him for a student. There were two policemen in this car and a
  motorcycle cop came up. Both officers got out, and the mean one stepped on
  the running board of my car&mdash;told me to move over&mdash;that he was
  taking me for a ride. Then the students rushed a vegetable truck, and loading
  up with tomatoes and oranges they just swamped that police car. The
  motorcycle cop called out the reserves, and the dirty bum of a policeman who
  had been to blame for this&mdash;he actually laid his hands on me&mdash;to
  push me out of my seat. Then this young fellow I mentioned, socked him in the
  stomach&mdash;a terrific wham! The officer began to fold up. Did I get a kick
  out of that? Then my champion laid him out in the street and leaping into my
  car told me to step on it. We left the mob of reserves and students having a
  swell fight. When I got out of the crowd I <i>did</i> step on it. We escaped.
  ... That&rsquo;s all, Dad, except the board of directors expelled me and the
  officers forgot to come and arrest me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t strike me as so terrible,&rdquo; replied Gene,
  with a reassuring smile. It was certain Madge had no idea she had done the
  least wrong. &ldquo;What do you think, Madeline?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge was rather thoughtless and indiscreet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What became of the young man?&rdquo; queried Gene. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  like to shake hands with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; flashed Madge, her eyes lighting up. &ldquo;I
  drove him downtown, to a parking place where we chatted. He was the
  handsomest fellow. Shy. He had no line at all. Oh, I liked him. Made a date
  with him to meet me right there the next day. But he didn&rsquo;t come, the
  idiot! Instead, oh, never mind&mdash;that was all of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel badly over it, why should we?&rdquo; asked
  Madeline, happily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll forget it. I think you are both darling. I&rsquo;m
  going to make up for my long absence by loving you to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, we can stand some loving,&rdquo; returned Gene, fervently.
  &ldquo;Are you really going to stay home now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad! Don&rsquo;t look so wistful. Oh, how I have neglected you
  both! But you wanted me educated. You&rsquo;ve had your way. I am, and
  how!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Neither Madeline nor Gene could resist a laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will stay home with us&mdash;at least once in a while?&rdquo;
  asked her mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forever, darling. I&rsquo;ll have my friends come to see me. I
  wired you to expect a crowd after graduation. What a place this ranch is to
  entertain city tenderfeet! I&rsquo;ll have the time of my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, the ranch&mdash;is run down,&rdquo; said Gene, hesitatingly.
  &ldquo;Hardly fit now for your friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Dad, it&rsquo;s so western, so Spanish. I adore the atmosphere
  of years and leisure. Before I left L. A., I bought three truckloads of
  stuff. Everything under the sun. Mom, I hope you like my modernistic taste.
  I&rsquo;ll refurnish my rooms, and all those in the west wing. Oh,
  it&rsquo;ll be swell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only three truckloads!&rdquo; ejaculated Gene, with a smile at
  Madeline. He had to laugh. His daughter was amazing, electrifying. He felt
  shot through and through with new life. The flush on Madeline&rsquo;s lovely
  face was pleasant to behold. &ldquo;What about your baggage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My car outside is full. And I expressed ten trunks and a lot of
  bags. They will be at Bolton today. The other stuff comes by freight. I do
  hope soon. We have only two weeks to get ready for my crowd.... Dad, will you
  carry in my truck? I brought you both presents galore, when I can unpack.
  Mom, are my rooms ready?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are clean, my dear, and exactly as you left them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene went out in front, conscious of varied emotions. A good deal of the
  happiness that possessed him was the pent-up delight Madeline had
  betrayed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! No wonder this car could travel!&rdquo; ejaculated Gene,
  sizing up the magnificent machine, new, glittering, apparently all engine.
  The back seat was packed full of bags and parcels. And there were three
  beautiful coats, one of them fur. All about the car and its contents reminded
  Gene of Madeline Hammond when she had first arrived at El Cajon, which was
  now Bolton. Like mother, like daughter! Still could Madge ever adjust herself
  to the changed times? She had a fortune but she could not squander her
  principal. Aunt Helen, wise in her vision, had seen to that. But
  Madge&rsquo;s income now could not support her present extravagance. Gene
  thought of these things and many more, in the fifteen trips he made with
  Madge&rsquo;s baggage. On the last she and her mother met him in
  Madge&rsquo;s sitting room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom! Why should you apologize for my rooms?&rdquo; Madge was
  saying. &ldquo;They are just swell. I wouldn&rsquo;t change them. Of course
  the furnishings are rather dingy and old. But I anticipated that....
  I&rsquo;ll paint these walls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll what?&rdquo; asked Gene, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll paint them. I bought the paint and brushes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You learned that in college?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly did. See here, Dad Stewart, you give me a job I
  <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on, Madge.... I&rsquo;d like, though, that you&rsquo;d
  run down to see Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels and my horses! Oh, am I happy?... Where&rsquo;s my purse? I
  don&rsquo;t want Nels to see me such a sight,&rdquo; she babbled. Finding the
  purse she sat down to open it and take out something shiny on a chain. From
  this she extracted a powder puff, with which she powdered her nose. This act
  was performed deftly and while she talked to her mother. But when she took
  out a small metal tube and began to paint her lips with it, Gene observed
  that she was careful and quiet. Her lips took on a hue still more scarlet.
  Madge, bouncing up, encountered her father&rsquo;s nonplused gaze, and she
  burst into mirth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo; he asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You old range rider! Why do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea, unless you imagine it makes you prettier.
  Nothing artificial could do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, don&rsquo;t you fool yourself. I just could. I&rsquo;ll make
  up really for you some day. It&rsquo;s an art.... I suppose, to answer you,
  that the custom grew popular through motion pictures. The most beautiful
  stars are those who have the artistry, or do their making up under
  experts.... Mom, would it interest you to know that I had an offer to go into
  the movies?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. But it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was one studio hot after me. It turned out that I had met
  some official or director at some function, or the Grove, I forget which. He
  talked me deaf, and phoned the house until I told him where to get off. I was
  interested, of course. Any girl in the world is keen about the movies.
  I&rsquo;d like to have taken a fly at it. But&mdash;I decided it would cost
  more than I&rsquo;d pay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cost? Why, I read about the big salaries the companies pay their
  stars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&mdash;Mom, isn&rsquo;t he a darling old dumbbell?...
  I&rsquo;ll be back right away to unpack.&rdquo; She ran out, her high heels
  clicking.</p>

  <p>Gene stood there, smiling quizzically at Madeline. Presently he heard the
  slam of a car door and the burst of engine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dumbbell? I suppose I am. Poor Nels and I are in for
  hell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, I&rsquo;m tremendously relieved. Whatever college and city
  may have done to her these four years she is wholesome and sweet. And oh! so
  lovely!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I liked the way she looked when I spoke of Nels.... Maddie, I
  think, if she&rsquo;s got a heart, we can stand anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be assured then, Gene, and relieved as I am. She is warmhearted.
  She loves us. She loves&mdash;this home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Madeline! You&rsquo;re crying.... At that I feel sort
  of&mdash;weak myself. Our little girl come home&mdash;grown up&mdash;a woman!
  I never saw a princess, but she&rsquo;s one. I&rsquo;m so proud of her I
  could burst.... Wife, I forgot to ask you. Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to
  patch up the telephone system to town? The wires are down in places. And
  there are other things.&rdquo; Whereupon Gene went over with her the talk he
  had had with Nels and Danny Mains. After that he proceeded to the room
  Madeline and he used as an office, and there he read neglected mail,
  carefully studied books, and figures that always were Greek to him, and wrote
  some important letters. Madge&rsquo;s coming had seemed to fire his energy,
  to make a break in the old <i>mañana</i> habit of mind he had fallen into,
  and to stimulate his determination to see this climax of hard times through.
  To Gene&rsquo;s surprise he was called to lunch before he had any idea the
  morning had passed.</p>

  <p>Madge met him as he entered the living room, and he halted in sheer
  amazement. She looked like a slim boy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, what kind of a riding outfit is that?&rdquo; Evidently his
  reaction to her appearance gave her delight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, I have on slacks. Don&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daughter, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll like anything you
  wear,&rdquo; he replied, putting his arm around her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Against your better judgment, yes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They entered the dining room, which appeared brighter than for many years.
  The sunshine sifted through the foliage over the open window. There were
  roses and Indian paintbrushes and sage in the vases. Madeline had celebrated
  the occasion by gracing the table with white linen and some of her old silver
  and china.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell to be home!&rdquo; exclaimed Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Disappointed in&mdash;anything?&rdquo; asked Gene, haltingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a thing. The ranch had gone to hell when I was home last. But I
  didn&rsquo;t mind the tumble-down corrals and sheds. Fits the range. But the
  big barn must have a new roof.... Dad, it gave me a shock to see Nels. I
  think he has failed a little. But he is the same old darling. I was so
  overjoyed to see him that I forgot my horses. Fancy that? Then the luncheon
  bell rang. I had scarcely time to change. This afternoon I&rsquo;ll get into
  riding togs, just to please Nels. What do you think he said, Dad?...
  &lsquo;Wal, Majesty, the only things aboot this heah ranch thet ain&rsquo;t
  gone daid is yore hawses. Me an&rsquo; yore <i>vaqueros</i> hev seen to
  thet.&rsquo;... Oh, I love to hear the old Texan talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, your horses are okay, Madge,&rdquo; replied Gene. &ldquo;I
  hope Nels didn&rsquo;t talk too much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t keep anything from me.... Dad, I&rsquo;ve known
  for a couple of years that your financial situation was not so hot. Mom told
  me when I was home last. And of course I&rsquo;ve read about the depression
  going from bad to worse. Just how bad is it for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge&rsquo;s direct query and the gaze that added more to it were not
  easy to meet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty tough, Madge&mdash;but I&rsquo;d rather not confess just
  what a poor businessman your dad is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, it is not your management of the ranch,&rdquo; interposed
  Madeline. &ldquo;You made it pay expenses until the bottom dropped out of
  everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madeline, that&rsquo;s darn good of you,&rdquo; protested Gene.
  &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not so. We had too much money and too many cattle. For
  ten years we ran behind, a little more every year. Then came the crash...
  .&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene hesitated, spreading wide his hands, looking from wife to daughter.
  Nels was not the only one who would find it difficult to lie to Madge
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; she said, soberly, dropping those penetrating
  eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always understood Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho was mine.
  You know, just in a vain and playful way, perhaps. How about that,
  Dad&mdash;seriously?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course this ranch is yours&mdash;or will be someday, which is
  just the same. And a white elephant&mdash;my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not for little Madge. What do you suppose I went to college for?
  What did I study economics for?... Dad&mdash;Mom, I tell you I&rsquo;m home
  for good. I&rsquo;m crazy about my home. It has been swell to have unlimited
  money. Let me play around this summer&mdash;entertain my friends&mdash;then
  I&rsquo;ll hop to the job.&rdquo;</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">IN THE afternoon Gene rode out on the range toward Bolton
  with one of his half-Mexican riders, Manuel Mains, son of Danny, the only one
  of Danny&rsquo;s four youngsters that Gene thought was worth much. Bonita,
  the eldest, was distractingly pretty, to be sure, but that seemed to be a bad
  thing for the girl.</p>

  <p>Gene wanted to find out how many telephone poles were down on the short
  cut of the line across the valley and over the ridge. From that point on in
  to Bolton, both the survey of the line and the necessary repair work could be
  done by truck. Manuel and he met some horses later, and the sum of their
  report was an agreeable surprise to Gene. Less than a dozen poles were down
  and there was only one break in the wire. Several days&rsquo; labor, after
  the new poles had been snaked down from the foothills, would put the
  telephone in working order again, which Gene saw was important in view of
  Madge&rsquo;s return and the activity presaged for the summer. Then it would
  be very necessary to go over the road and make that safe for automobilists.
  The problem of help occupied his mind. That, added to his other difficulties
  seemed an insurmountable fact, yet somehow, Madge&rsquo;s presence
  counteracted it, and made that afternoon sojourn in the colorful and fragrant
  sage as pleasant as it was serious. Riding back he thought that he could not
  succumb to gloom and hopelessness.</p>

  <p>Manuel turned off at the village to get his supper. Bonita, whose sharp
  eyes always saw everybody and everything, waved a red scarf at Gene, as if he
  had been a cowboy with whom to flirt. Gene waved back at her. Despite her
  deviltry, she was lovable. &ldquo;Gosh! there&rsquo;ll be young fellows in
  Madge&rsquo;s crowd,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Gene. &ldquo;What Bonita will
  do to them! But I&rsquo;ll gamble on her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was almost sunset when Gene turned his horse over to Jose. He saw
  Madge&rsquo;s golden head blazing from the top of the pasture fence.
  Nels&rsquo; white locks appeared brighter by contrast. They were watching
  Madge&rsquo;s horses, which no doubt had been turned loose. Gene, about to
  join them, was deflected by the sight of a strange rider coming down the
  lane. Instead Gene proceeded to the square where one of the <i>vaqueros</i>
  and some Mexican boys surrounded a black horse in front of the blacksmith
  shop. Gene ascertained that the horse was lame. He examined the leg, which
  proved not to be badly sprained, and upon rising he saw that the strange
  rider had arrived. Gene&rsquo;s first glance at the handsome young man in his
  flashy cowboy attire occasioned him some amusement. A forerunner of the range
  contingent that inevitably would throng there to see Madge!</p>

  <p>The rider got down, and introduced himself, saying bluntly that he wanted
  a job. Gene looked him over, favorably impressed. He seemed under
  twenty-five, tall and lithe, powerful of limb and shoulder, and he had a
  strong open countenance and fine hazel eyes, medium dark and very
  penetrating. His black horse would have been an asset for any cowboy.</p>

  <p>Gene read a letter of recommendation from Ren Starr, and it was not many
  moments till he liked Lance Sidway&rsquo;s looks, his words, and had given
  him a job on the ranch.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile one of the lads had taken the black horse down the lane for a
  drink. Gene anticipated results from that procedure and he was tinglingly
  prepared for Madge&rsquo;s ecstatic squeal. That girl had cowboy blood in
  her. Then Gene, with malice aforethought, sent the unwilling Sidway in
  Madge&rsquo;s direction. They met, so precipitously that Madge ran into
  Sidway and almost fell out of his arms. Astounded, plainly stunned for an
  instant, Madge&rsquo;s vivid face suddenly flashed radiance. Recognition and
  rapture were evident in her speaking eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You!</i>... Oh, if it isn&rsquo;t my hero!&rdquo; she cried in
  intense excitement. &ldquo;Of all the surprises I <i>ever</i> had! You
  darling!&rdquo; And with swift action that matched her voice, she lifted her
  gauntleted hands to Sidway&rsquo;s shoulders and rose on her tiptoes to kiss
  him warmly. Evidently she had aimed at his lips, but she missed them, leaving
  half of a red bow to the side.</p>

  <p>Gene, utterly astonished as he was at his daughter&rsquo;s impetuous
  action, yet did not fail to catch the reaction in the boy. When she ran into
  his arms he gave a violent start and uttered a gasp. Then at her words of
  surprise and delight, followed by that impulsive kiss, his face turned a
  dusky scarlet. It receded as she drew back until he was pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God!... You?... Not <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;me!&rdquo; she replied, sweetly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be&mdash;be Stewart&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; he
  implored. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be Madge&mdash;not Majesty
  Stewart!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am. And you know that, you clever devil,&rdquo; she returned, in
  positive admiration. &ldquo;You put one over, didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;meeting
  me <i>here</i>? No crowded noisy parking place for you, Mr. Oregon. You
  wanted to keep that date here, at my home, on the Arizona range.
  Romantic&mdash;individual&mdash;beautiful! I figured you perfectly, my campus
  champion. I knew you weren&rsquo;t ordinary. And almost I can forgive you for
  not keeping that date.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I did keep it,&rdquo; he gulped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; she echoed, her violet eyes wide and dark.
  &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t disgrace me by being the first fellow ever to
  break a date with Madge Stewart?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss Stewart,&rdquo; replied Sidway, still
  overcome. &ldquo;I was there&mdash;long before you came. In a car.... I saw
  you drive in. Then that&mdash;that fellow followed you....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw him&mdash;heard us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I was quite close.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you jump out and let him see you were my date? He
  would have acted true to type&mdash;and you could have socked him, too.
  I&rsquo;m afraid you lost a golden opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss Stewart,&rdquo; he said, in awkward though
  sincere regret. &ldquo;But I was&mdash;sort of paralyzed. I never got over it
  until after you drove away with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I do forgive you. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She touched his arm and turned him toward Gene, who had leaned against a
  post, taking it all in. Gene had no idea how he looked, but he felt highly
  amused at this clever ruse of Sidway&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, isn&rsquo;t it just darling?&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;This is
  my hero&mdash;the young man whom I told you and Mom about&mdash;who rescued
  me at the campus riot.... Lance Sidway&mdash;my father, Gene
  Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, we haven&rsquo;t been introduced, but we&rsquo;ve
  met,&rdquo; replied Gene, genially, and he eyed Lance as if he had been taken
  in a bit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. How silly of me! He just rode in and you...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I gave him a job,&rdquo; interposed Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?... To ride for you!&mdash;He is a fast worker.... Lance
  Sidway, I don&rsquo;t know just what to make of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That goes for me, too,&rdquo; replied Gene, with a smile which
  softened the doubt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stewart, I am on the spot,&rdquo; burst out Sidway. &ldquo;I
  told you I&rsquo;d never met your daughter&mdash;never heard of her till I
  met Starr. How could I guess she was that one?... I did meet her&mdash;as she
  told you.... I&rsquo;m innocent of...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; went on Gene, kindly.
  &ldquo;I was young once. It didn&rsquo;t turn out just as you planned. But
  I&rsquo;d have liked you better if you&rsquo;d told me...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not lie to you,&rdquo; declared the cowboy, with such
  vehemence that Gene began to feel sorry for him. Then Madge claimed
  Sidway&rsquo;s attention.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I get you, Mr. Lance Sidway. But I&rsquo;ve been kidded by
  experts,&rdquo; she said, with laughing eyes. She was pleased with his
  subterfuge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? You get what?&rdquo; he demanded bluntly, and it appeared
  that his awkwardness was vanishing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is so obvious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, it may look obvious that I knew who you
  were&mdash;that I deliberately rode out here because of you. But it is not
  true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so you are ashamed to be caught?&rdquo; she taunted.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty smooth actor, cowboy, but you can&rsquo;t fool
  little Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may be pretty smart but you&rsquo;re wrong this time,&rdquo; he
  retorted, and there was plainly resentment in his tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s skip it,&rdquo; she returned, without the archness. And
  at that moment Nels, and the lad leading Sidway&rsquo;s horse, came around
  the corner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, shake hands with Lance Sidway,&rdquo; interposed Gene, glad
  to relieve the growing strain between the young couple. &ldquo;He hails from
  Oregon. And I&rsquo;ve just given him a job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; drawled Nels, and shook hands with the flustered lad.
  Gene was of the opinion that Sidway had no conception how he was being looked
  over by the keenest eyes in Arizona. Gene&rsquo;s conclusion was that the
  cowboy showed up favorably in a most trying situation. When Madge saw the
  black horse again, her swift reversal of mood eased the situation. Like a
  true range rider she walked around the black, all eyes, placing a careful yet
  confident hand on him, and never saying a word until she had made a second
  circuit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels!&rdquo; she importuned, as if wanting him to refute her
  judgment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m shore sorry, lass,&rdquo; drawled Nels.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a grand hawse. He&rsquo;s got Cedar beat all
  holler.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; she flashed, her eyes blazing purple fire at Nels.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re teasing me. Nels darling, you don&rsquo;t mean
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, mebbe I&rsquo;m exaggeratin&rsquo; some. But see heah,
  Majesty. Even if you been away from the range so long, you know a great hawse
  when you see him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I do.... Mr. Sidway, will you <i>please</i> let me
  get on him?&rdquo; Her query to the cowboy was tinged with slight sarcasm,
  yet her desire was deeply sincere.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;if you wish.... The stirrups will be
  long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge swung gracefully up into the saddle and Nels beat the cowboy to her
  side. Presently the stirrups were laced up to fit Madge and she walked Umpqua
  across the green square, trotted him up the lane a few hundred yards, paced
  him a little and loped him back. What a picture the black horse and the
  golden-haired girl made! Turning away from the sight himself, Gene saw it in
  Nels&rsquo; worshipful eyes, and then he caught a gleam of the eternal cowboy
  in Sidway&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Madge sat the saddle as if reluctant to get off, while she patted the
  arched glossy neck. She was flushed of face. Her eyes were soft, glowing. At
  that moment Gene experienced the old fullness of love for her in his heart.
  She was Madeline&rsquo;s daughter, but she was western. Presently she sat up
  in the saddle, the glamorous spell vanished, and she faced the three men
  coolly. Gene imagined he could read her mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His trot does not equal Cedar&rsquo;s, but his pace and lope beat
  that of any horse I ever rode.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, lass, thet&rsquo;s strong praise from you,&rdquo; declared
  Nels. &ldquo;Justified, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, never go back on your own horses,&rdquo; warned Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, Dad. But I must be just.... Mr. Sidway, do
  <i>you</i> know how fine Umpqua is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; ejaculated the cowboy, amazed. &ldquo;Nobody can tell me
  anything about him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you bet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, the truth is I haven&rsquo;t anything. Of course I
  wouldn&rsquo;t bet Umpqua.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? Oh, you&rsquo;re a cowboy. You might some day,&rdquo; she
  returned, subtly. &ldquo;Umpqua reminds me of something I read&mdash;that an
  Arab chieftain said. I didn&rsquo;t have to commit it to memory. It just
  stuck in my mind... &lsquo;If in the course of your life you alight upon a
  horse of noble origin, with large lively eyes wide apart, and black broad
  nostrils close together, whose neck, shoulders and haunches are long, his
  forehead, loins and limbs broad, his back and hip-bones and pasterns short,
  all covered with soft skin, fine hair, and his lungs wide and powerful, and
  his feet good, with heels high off the ground&mdash;hasten to buy or trade or
  steal that horse&mdash;secure him, and always afterward bless Allah for your
  good fortune!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if thet doesn&rsquo;t beat me,&rdquo; said Nels, in rapt
  admiration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, you&rsquo;ve the high sign on us. But it was good,&rdquo;
  added Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; chimed in Sidway, reluctantly smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems superfluous to ask&mdash;can he run&mdash;is he
  fast?&rdquo; asked Madge, tensely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He can beat your Cedar or any other nag you own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen, cowboy,&rdquo; returned Madge, darkly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; went on Sidway, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the
  best cowboy horse ever bred in Oregon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now yore talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Nels. &ldquo;An Arab is no good
  to us riders, onless he&rsquo;s a cow-hawse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, Umpqua can run over rocks as if they were level
  ground.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I seen that from his hoofs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge slipped slowly out of the saddle, facing Sidway: &ldquo;No need to
  ask how you love Umpqua,&rdquo; she said, with a softness rounding the turn
  of her words. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take it amiss if I&mdash;almost insult
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway stared at her, and then with something of a gallant gesture he
  repudiated any possibility of her doing that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What value do you place on Umpqua?&rdquo; she launched, suddenly
  keen, vibrant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Value!... None, Miss Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Every horse has a value. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Diamonds, rubies, gold!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell! I like you the better for that.... Do you know that you
  could sell him for five thousand dollars?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph. A movie star offered me that,&rdquo; returned the cowboy,
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?... I&rsquo;ll give you six thousand for Umpqua.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seven thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eight thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ten thousand!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway&rsquo;s flushed face turned pale, either with anger or some other
  emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, don&rsquo;t you know that money can&rsquo;t buy
  everything?&rdquo; he queried, with dignity. &ldquo;Umpqua is all I own in
  the world. He has saved my life twice. I love him. We raised him from a colt,
  and all of us loved him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m rotten,&rdquo; she cried, as if forced. &ldquo;But
  no matter. I love him, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well. I&rsquo;m glad you do. But&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
  buy him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I always have what I want,&rdquo; she flashed, imperiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You probably have had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But be reasonable.&rdquo; Madge stamped her booted foot until her
  spur jingled sharply. Tears of vexation and disappointment burned out of her
  big eyes and they glowed and dilated like mystic balls. &ldquo;You admit
  you&rsquo;re broke. I offer you a small fortune. You can get a start here on
  the range. Dad and Nels will help you. I will. You can still go on loving
  Umpqua. You may ride him&mdash;sometimes. You can make me happy. Please, Mr.
  Lance Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cowboy gazed at her, listened to her eloquent appeal as if fascinated
  by something beside and beyond her offer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, Miss Stewart,&rdquo; he said, finally. &ldquo;You may be
  Gene Stewart&rsquo;s daughter, born on this wonderful range, but you
  don&rsquo;t know cowboys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge betrayed that she could not gainsay that, and it seemed a struggle
  went on in her between realization and selfishness. The latter evidently
  conquered. Anger at herself for being so little or at him for frustrating her
  desire burned out that momentary softness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t sell him?&rdquo; she queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Sidway, I can&rsquo;t have you riding around here on a finer
  horse than&mdash;a horse that I want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be just too bad,&rdquo; returned the cowboy, in a
  tone which brought a hue to her cheeks that matched the carmine on her
  lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You appear to be rather dense. Do I have to tell you I will not
  have you on this ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me anything, lady. Your father hired
  me and he&rsquo;ll have to fire me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at Gene with great luminous eyes. &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, you&rsquo;re unreasonable,&rdquo; replied Gene, coolly,
  smiling upon her. &ldquo;I need riders badly. Sidway has offered to ride for
  me at a wage I am ashamed to take advantage of. I couldn&rsquo;t discharge
  him just because he refuses to sell you his horse. Could I, Nels?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nels showed plainly that he was between the devil and the deep sea. Madge
  had been his especial joy and treasure all her life, as Gene well knew, and
  he had always spoiled her. Gene enjoyed his old cowman&rsquo;s extreme
  discomfiture, but knew he would extract himself somehow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, I shore know how you feel aboot this hawse,&rdquo; he
  began, in his slow drawl. &ldquo;But, lass, you&rsquo;re bound to respect
  Sidway for his feelin&rsquo;s. I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t be playin&rsquo;
  the game if you fired him. Shore I never heahed of you bein&rsquo; unfair.
  You used to give hawses to cowboys. An&rsquo; I reckon, if yore happiness
  actooly depends on ownin&rsquo; Umpqua, wal, in the nature of things on the
  range, you know, he&rsquo;ll jest naturally drift yore way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The persuasive cool voice of the old cattleman, the significant content of
  his last words, spread oil upon the troubled waters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Sidway, you stay,&rdquo; said Madge, loftily.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was unfair. But I will have that
  horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The dark passionate glance she bent upon Sidway had infinite and unknown
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Stewart. But I do not want to remain under false
  pretenses. You will not have Umpqua.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I accept your challenge. If you don&rsquo;t show yellow and ride
  off&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Then she smiled upon him without malice or
  resentment, and wheeled to start up the path.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Madge, you&rsquo;re forgetting your car,&rdquo; called Gene.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned to call back in a sweet high-pitched voice: &ldquo;Mr. Lance
  Sidway can use it to bed down his darling Umpqua.&rdquo; Then she was gone
  into the foliage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whoopee,&rdquo; sighed Gene, and Nels came back with:
  &ldquo;Dog-gone, old pard! Seems like old times when you fust came to
  Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho, before thet lass was borned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway had been lengthening his stirrups with swift hands. Presently he
  turned with pale face and hazel eyes shadowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my way. Thank you, Gene Stewart,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Sidway. You wouldn&rsquo;t let my daughter&rsquo;s taunt.
  ...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that, altogether. I know you didn&rsquo;t
  believe me&mdash;that I didn&rsquo;t come here on&mdash;on Miss
  Stewart&rsquo;s account. And under the circumstances I don&rsquo;t want to
  stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; rejoined Gene, seriously,
  searching the troubled face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See heah, cowboy,&rdquo; interposed Nels, descending from the porch
  with clinking slow steps. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ride off hot-haided. Air you on
  the level? You didn&rsquo;t know this was Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho an&rsquo;
  thet the lass you done a favor for in Los Angeles was Madge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I did not,&rdquo; replied Sidway, forcibly.</p>

  <p>After a keen scrutiny of Sidway&rsquo;s face the old cowman turned to
  Gene: &ldquo;Boss, he&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; the truth. Don&rsquo;t let him
  go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hanged if I don&rsquo;t believe it myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stewart, I swear that I am on the level. I didn&rsquo;t know. It
  was just an infernal coincidence,&rdquo; rejoined Sidway huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay then. Let&rsquo;s shake on it.... Maybe your infernal
  coincidence will turn out well for me and this ranch problem. I&rsquo;ve a
  hunch it will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway appeared too poignantly affected to voice his manifest relief and
  gladness. Gene&rsquo;s conviction was that the young man felt too strongly
  for the mere misunderstanding. There was more behind it. Gene liked this
  cowboy, and that Nels did also added a good deal of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say yore fust name was?&rdquo; drawled Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance. It&rsquo;s screwy, I know. Bad as Umpqua.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so orful bad.... Gene, yore supper bell has rung. I&rsquo;ll
  look after Lance. He can hev supper with me, an&rsquo; the bunk room next to
  mine.... Whar&rsquo;ll I hev Jose put his hawse?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the pasture tonight. Better in the barn.... Say,
  wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny if we could bed him down in Madge&rsquo;s
  car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so damn funny in the mawnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dusk was settling under the pines when Gene mounted the slope to the
  house. A ruddy glow faded over the peaks in the west. Coyotes were wailing
  somewhere low down. Plodding up the low ascent, Gene was revolving in mind
  the events of the day. He had to side with the cowboy against Madge. She was
  willful and spoiled. That came out when she could not have her own way. He
  recalled the tone of her voice, her imperious look, her temper; and he shook
  his head sadly. But what could have been expected of the girl, their only
  daughter, adored and petted, born with a gold spoon in her mouth, and left a
  million when she was fifteen? But Gene reflected that despite these faults
  she seemed to be irresistible. If only one or more of his own besetting sins
  did not crop up in her! The cowboy Lance was in love with her&mdash;there was
  no doubt about that, even if he had not found it out yet. Gene, remembering
  that Madge had always had what she wanted, was heartily glad that Sidway had
  been strong enough to brook her will. He had good stuff in him, that lad.
  Gene&rsquo;s yearning for a son, long buried, had a rebirth. If Lance Sidway
  turned out as fine as he promised he would come somewhere near the ideal Gene
  had dreamed of.</p>

  <p>By the time Gene had washed and changed, the second supper bell rang. He
  found Madeline and Madge waiting. The girl wore white, some clinging soft
  stuff that made Gene catch his breath. He thought of what little chance he
  had or Sidway or Nels, or any man, to resist this lovely and bewildering
  creature. Not a trace of the recent mood showed on her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... and he wouldn&rsquo;t part with Umpqua, the sap!&rdquo; she was
  saying to her mother. And as Gene entered she extended a hand to him with a
  radiant smile. &ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m telling Mom about my hero and his
  wonderful horse. What a liar he is! He found out who I am and where I lived.
  I can&rsquo;t get what possessed him to deny that. He needn&rsquo;t. It was a
  clever stunt. Intrigued me. After I fell so hard for him that day he rescued
  me!... Well, I fell for his horse a thousand times harder. Oh, Mom, what a
  beautiful horse! Has it all over Cedar and Range and Bellefontaine&mdash;all
  of them. I wanted Umpqua so badly that I could have murdered the cowboy... .
  At first I had a kick out of it. Never occurred to me that I couldn&rsquo;t
  buy the black. But it turned out that I couldn&rsquo;t. Then I lost my
  temper. I&rsquo;m afraid I reverted to feline type with claws out. Did Mr.
  Sidway jar me? I&rsquo;m constrained to admit that he did. Made me feel
  selfish, mean, rotten. Which I was. But I&rsquo;d do worse to get that horse.
  And all the time I was so mad I had a sneaking respect for Lance, though I
  hated him. He&rsquo;s just swell, Mom. Don&rsquo;t you agree, Dad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather cottoned to him myself,&rdquo; replied Gene to this long
  monologue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So did Nels, the traitor,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am indeed interested to meet this paragon among cowboys. And see
  his Umpqua,&rdquo; said Madeline, with a smile. &ldquo;Madge, in the
  succeeding days of trial I might be of service to you. I&rsquo;ve had some
  experiences!&rdquo; Madeline threw a laughing glance at her husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom darling!&rdquo; expostulated Madge. &ldquo;Falling for Mr.
  Sidway doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing in the world. I&rsquo;ve done that nineteen
  times this last semester.... But will I give that big boy a ride? It&rsquo;ll
  be a kick. And I&rsquo;ll have that horse if&mdash;if...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if what, my girl?&rdquo; taunted Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I have to <i>marry</i> him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madeline neither reproved her nor showed surprise, but she remarked that
  cowboys must have vastly more than horses to be eligible for marriage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I could divorce him next day,&rdquo; Madge flashed
  bewilderingly.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Next morning Gene was out early enough to catch Nels and Sidway at a
  sunrise breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, look who&rsquo;s heah,&rdquo; drawled the old cowman.
  &ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, Gene. You ain&rsquo;t got oot this early fer
  years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither have you, old-timer,&rdquo; returned Gene, jocularly.
  &ldquo;Shall we put it down to our lately acquired cowboy, Mr.
  Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shore can. The son-of-a-gun kept me up till eleven
  o&rsquo;clock tellin&rsquo; stories, an&rsquo; then, by thunder, he rustled
  me oot before sunup.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Manifestly Nels and the newcomer had gotten along famously. Sidway
  appeared fresh and eager, and having donned his old outfit, he looked a lithe
  and striking rider.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Mr. Stewart,&rdquo; Gene replied to his
  greeting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gene, or Boss, or Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, Boss. I sure appreciate falling in with you. And I&rsquo;m
  asking if I may have the day on my own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On your own? What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Gene, puzzled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you give me the day, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can tell you where
  your cattle have been rustled lately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, he made some such crack as thet to me,&rdquo; drawled Nels.
  &ldquo;Jest young hot blood. But I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, are you hinting that you can find out what Nels and I and
  Danny Mains couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not hinting. I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; replied
  the cowboy, with an engaging smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t lack nerve,&rdquo; returned Gene, shortly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I don&rsquo;t mean to be fresh. I just think you men have
  been hunting for rustlers in an old-fashioned way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old-fashioned?&rdquo; echoed Gene, while Nels ha-ha&rsquo;d
  vociferously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, young man, rustling is rustling. Cattle don&rsquo;t fly.
  They have to be driven. On their hoofs. And hoofs leave tracks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only so far. I&rsquo;ll bet you tracked yours as far as a
  macadamized road, and no farther.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. Or I should say, Jose and Manuel tracked
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; interposed Nels, &ldquo;Them two riders split an&rsquo;
  rode east and west fer twenty-odd miles, an&rsquo; never found the place
  where them hoof tracks left thet highway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; ejaculated Sidway, clapping his hands.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted to be sure of. Saves me the
  trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bothering with tracks <i>on</i> the highway. They never left the
  highway short of Douglas or Tucson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, son,&rdquo; returned Nels, his drawl more pronounced than
  ever, and very patient. &ldquo;Shore you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; to a couple
  of old cowmen, oot of date, an&rsquo; I reckon pretty dumb, as you youngsters
  say. Will you talk a language we know? These heah modern days air hell on
  speed, shore, but cattle cain&rsquo;t be drove on a cement road fer hundreds
  of miles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure they can. It&rsquo;s a cinch. Your cattle <i>were</i> so
  driven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&rdquo; complained Nels, turning to Gene. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
  I was kinda takin&rsquo; to this lad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, he&rsquo;s got something on us,&rdquo; declared Gene.
  &ldquo;See here, Lance, just how were my cattle driven along the
  highway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Simple as a, b, c.&mdash;In trucks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Trucks!</i>&rdquo; burst out Gene, incredulously.</p>

  <p>Nels swore, and dropped one of his galvanized utensils on the floor.
  &ldquo;Gene, it&rsquo;s shore simple. But we&rsquo;d never guess such two-bit
  rustlin&rsquo; of twenty or forty-odd haid would be done thet way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned. Sidway, how&rsquo;d you find that
  out?&rdquo; added Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen inside one of these cattle trucks. Fact is I drove
  one of them,&rdquo; explained the young man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes? Wal, I reckon you&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; us next
  you&rsquo;re one of these newfangled rustlers,&rdquo; drawled Nels,
  dryly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might have been without knowing, if the truck had been loaded....
  On the way over here to Arizona I went broke at Douglas. Hung around for any
  kind of a job. Well, it came along, and it was to drive a big canvas-covered
  truck to Tucson. I was paid a hundred bucks, and told to expect to be held up
  somewhere along the road. I was held up all right, a little ways out of
  Tucson, by a gang who expected just what I&rsquo;d figured out&mdash;that the
  truck was full of booze. But it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;and were they burned up?
  These highjackers corroborated my suspicions.... All right now. To come short
  with it, by figuring, and asking questions I found out that a string of
  trucks go through Douglas east about once in six weeks. Presumably they go
  east loaded with bootleg liquor and come back west loaded with bought or
  stolen cattle. My hunch is that this gang used to buy cattle for a blind to
  their real operations, but finally turned to rustling. Just easy money!... On
  the other hand it may be that only one of the trucks is loaded with booze,
  and possibly it may come west, along with the cattle. We can safely gamble,
  however, on this&mdash;that your cattle have been stolen in this
  manner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, what air we comin&rsquo; to?&rdquo; ejaculated Nels,
  scratching his white head. &ldquo;Gene, shore we can look forward to be
  robbed by airplanes next.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fake rustling, likely,&rdquo; added Gene. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d the
  money for a few cattle mean to these bootleggers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing to the big shots,&rdquo; rejoined Sidway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  had a hunch that maybe the drivers of these trucks are grabbing a little
  money on their own hook. What I want to find out now is <i>who</i> drives the
  cattle to the highway. That&rsquo;d have to be done on horses.... Boss, give
  me some idea where these last cattle tracks were made. I&rsquo;ll ride out
  and see if I can pick up some horse tracks. If I do I&rsquo;ll measure them,
  make sure I&rsquo;ll know them again, and then ride all over this darned
  range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fork your horse and hit&mdash;No, let Umpqua rest. Tell Jose to
  saddle Range for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; replied the cowboy, and he strode out
  of Nels&rsquo; bunkhouse. Presently he passed off the porch carrying his
  saddle and accessories.</p>

  <p>Nels went on wiping his utensils. Presently Gene said: &ldquo;What do you
  know about that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, that feller proves how much old-time cowboys like us want to
  figger on new angles. Since the war, you know, we&rsquo;ve jest been
  goin&rsquo; back. Smart, this boy Sidway. If we only had Ren oot here
  now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. We know Ren Starr,&rdquo; replied Gene, ponderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, did you ever know me to be fooled aboot a cowboy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean his being straight?... I can&rsquo;t remember one,
  Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if this Oregon lad can ride an&rsquo; shoot, he&rsquo;ll be a
  Gawd-send to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After that encomium from the old cattleman Gene felt himself convinced. He
  talked a while longer with Nels, went to the store with him, and presently
  set about an inspection tour of the barns and sheds and corrals, the
  reservoir, the lake, the irrigation ditches, the fences, and all pertaining
  to the ranch. He had divined that Madge would be coming to him presently and
  he wanted to be well posted. This survey was a melancholy task. He saw now
  why for years he had neglected it. In some degree verdure around the water
  hid the rack and ruin of the wooden structures. Those built of adobe were
  also damaged. And in fact repairs were badly needed everywhere.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the store Gene found Madge there with Nels. She wore
  overalls, high-top boots and spurs, and a blue sweater with a red scarf. The
  mere sight of her flushed and disheveled, and clad as she was, chased away
  Gene&rsquo;s gloom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, Dad,&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;I caught Nels
  drinking red likker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She did, at thet,&rdquo; admitted Nels, ruefully. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;m darned if she didn&rsquo;t ask me for some.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was a touchy point with Gene, which he passed by. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
  you find your horses?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cedar wild as a March hare. Bellefontaine as sweet as ever. Range
  was gone, and I learned from Jose that our new cow hand took him,&rdquo;
  returned Madge, and the dangerous tone of the last words were not lost upon
  Gene. He hastened to explain that he had told Sidway to saddle Range.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh.... What&rsquo;s the matter with your own horses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sold most of my saddle stock. Your horses are fat and lazy, Madge.
  They need to be worked out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed they do. That was okay, Dad. I thought Mr. Sidway, seeing he
  is so fresh, might have taken Range on his own.... Dad, his horse Umpqua came
  right to me. Oh, I was tickled pink. He likes me. I&rsquo;ll have no trouble
  winning him from his owner. And will I do it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, that&rsquo;d be a dirty trick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it would be. But I&rsquo;m crazy about the horse&mdash;and Nels
  said I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Added fuel to the flame!... Besides,&rdquo; she
  pouted, &ldquo;Nels has fallen for that cowboy in a most unaccountable
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So have I, Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Et tu, Brute</i>,&rdquo; she returned, reproachfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can account for it in more ways than one. Let me tell you just
  one.... First thing this morning he told Nels and me how we had been losing
  stock so mysteriously.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she queried, suddenly intent. Gene liked that instant
  response.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Driven away in trucks. That was a new one on us. It floored Nels.
  Sidway...&rdquo; Here Gene briefly told her about the cowboy&rsquo;s
  experience on the trip over, and how swiftly he had put two and two together.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone off down the valley to get a line on horse
  tracks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you he was a regular guy,&rdquo; declared Madge,
  enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. But it turned out&mdash;you don&rsquo;t like
  him,&rdquo; said Gene, casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it did. You saw me kiss him. I was just delighted.
  If it had not been for him I&rsquo;d have had to go to court.... But my
  feelings don&rsquo;t matter. If Sidway doesn&rsquo;t start something round
  here he may be a big help to you and Nels. Between the two of us, we will put
  this ranch on its feet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal now, lass. What you mean&mdash;start somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
  interposed Nels, greatly interested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, you old spoofer. You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s already started somethin&rsquo; with thet
  hawse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say. But I meant particularly what invariably happens to
  fresh cowboys when I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. An&rsquo; thet poor devil will hev to go draggin&rsquo;
  himself off withoot his hawse&mdash;an&rsquo; his heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels! You&rsquo;re the same old darling!&rdquo; she cried,
  gleefully as she left them. Presently she turned a happy face over her
  shoulder. &ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s swell to be home!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s good, Madge. It&rsquo;s sure swell to have
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge looked in at the open shed where they had parked her car, then
  crossed the court and disappeared up the path. Gene observed that Nels&rsquo;
  eyes had never left her while she was in sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh!... Nels, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in that poor devil&rsquo;s boots
  for a lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you jest bet I would,&rdquo; averred Nels. &ldquo;If I know
  cowboys, this Sidway feller will give Majesty a run for her money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! He doesn&rsquo;t strike me as the fortune-huntin&rsquo;
  breed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All cowboys air fortune hunters. You was, Gene. An&rsquo; if I
  remember you, old <i>El Capitan</i>, this Oregon boy has you tied fer all
  &rsquo;cept drinkin&rsquo; hard an&rsquo; shootin hard. I reckon no
  <i>hombre</i> ever beat you at thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, you&rsquo;re a sharp old rascal. I&rsquo;ve relied upon you
  for years. But let&rsquo;s not get sold on this stranger so
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m sold now&mdash;same as Majesty is. Reckon it&rsquo;d
  be a good idee for you to keep yore haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge sold on Sidway?&rdquo; ejaculated Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. Only she has no idee atall aboot it yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You romantic old geezer!... It&rsquo;d just suit you now&mdash;if
  Madge would take to a man of our kind, wouldn&rsquo;t it?... Well, to be
  honest, I&rsquo;d like it, too. But I think that&rsquo;s only a dream. Madge
  will marry some city man, tire of us and our simple life here on the open
  range&mdash;and go for the fleshpots of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Natural for her Dad to hev sich pessimistic ideas. But
  ump-umm!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why natural?&rdquo; demanded Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause you reckon she has inherited a lot of yore no-good
  blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right again, old-timer. I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet lass will turn oot like her mother. But I ain&rsquo;t
  sayin&rsquo;, Gene, thet we won&rsquo;t hev hell with her before she turns
  oot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>During the afternoon Gene persuaded Madge to drive him up the old road
  toward the foothills, where was located the big spring that fed the lake and
  provided irrigation for the ranch. As the road was rough they did not get
  back until toward the end of the afternoon. Passing through the little
  Mexican village, the inhabitants of which had once depended solely upon the
  ranch, Gene said to Madge: &ldquo;Thanks, daughter. You&rsquo;re almost as
  good a driver as you are a horseman. I&rsquo;ll stop off at Danny
  Mains&rsquo; and walk home from there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; said Madge, presently. &ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Gene espied Sidway, on foot, leaning on the gate talking to Bonita
  Mains. Range, bridle down, stood near by. There was no more denying the
  cowboy&rsquo;s demeanor than Bonita&rsquo;s delight. The dusky-eyed maiden
  radiated charm and coquetry. That Sidway was not in the least embarrassed by
  their arrival somehow gave Gene a tingle of expectancy and satisfaction. The
  car stopped. Gene stepped out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait, Dad,&rdquo; said Madge, lightly. &ldquo;No need to
  walk home when you can ride.... Bonita!&mdash;<i>Buenas tardes</i>. How are
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas tardes</i>, Miss Stewart,&rdquo; returned Bonita, shy and
  flushed. &ldquo;I am so happy to see you. Welcome home to Majesty&rsquo;s
  Rancho!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bonita. I&rsquo;m glad to see you. Introduce me to your boy
  friend.... Oh, it&rsquo;s Mr. Sidway. I thought I knew that horse.
  How&rsquo;d you like him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so much. He&rsquo;s cranky, contrary. Spoiled by girls, I
  expect,&rdquo; replied Sidway, coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t ride
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene spoke up: &ldquo;Bonita, please call your father.&rdquo; And as the
  girl flashed toward the house, Gene turned with interest to Madge and the
  cowboy. She was quietly lighting a cigarette. But Gene had never seen her
  eyes as magnificent as now. Sidway, however, had stepped away from the gate
  to bend eagle eyes down upon the sage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, look at that car,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Hitting only
  the high spots!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene espied a speeding black car appearing to run away from a long trail
  of dust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure coming,&rdquo; agreed Gene, puzzled. Drivers did
  not race on that rough road for nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope it&rsquo;s my mail,&rdquo; spoke up Madge. &ldquo;I left
  orders for it to be sent out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that juncture Danny Mains came out, his homely weatherbeaten face
  wrinkled in a huge smile. Gene called his attention to the car. Mains took
  one look and then said: &ldquo;Darn fool&rsquo;ll break his neck,
  ridin&rsquo; like thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he greeted Madge and the cowboy. Bonita, bright-eyed and
  self-conscious, came out to join her father and gaze down the slope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren Starr!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

  <p>Gene was quick to detect a note of fear stronger than the surprise in her
  exclamation. Sidway must have caught it too, for he turned a narrowed gaze
  upon the girl. Then the group watched the racing car until it passed out of
  sight under the slope. Bonita, with troubled face, left them to enter the
  house. Gene, attending to Danny&rsquo;s speculation about Starr still had an
  ear for a byplay between Sidway and Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Awful pretty girl&mdash;this Bonita,&rdquo; the cowboy was
  saying.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell kid. On the make, too. But am I telling you?&rdquo; retorted
  Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You appear to be. I didn&rsquo;t get that about her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you such a fast worker&mdash;Well!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I like your horse,&rdquo; went on Lance, evidently no match
  for her at repartee. Her voice had a cutting edge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you said Range was cranky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Can&rsquo;t a fellow like cranky horses&mdash;and girls, too,
  for that matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about such fellows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? I&rsquo;ll bet what you don&rsquo;t know wouldn&rsquo;t fill
  a book.... When is your college crowd coming?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you are interested? My sorority sisters, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.... Just the crowd. When? The time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That can hardly concern you, Mr. Sidway. But they arrive on the
  twentieth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I wanted to know because I&rsquo;d like to help your
  father a little. Then I&rsquo;ll beat it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;I get you. Dad thought you had taken to him and the
  ranch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had. You see, I just left Hollywood. I was fed up on a lot of
  glamour gals and pretty boys. And I&rsquo;m leery of a college
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed. Mine would not embarrass you, Mr. Sidway. Certainly my girl
  friends do not aspire to collect cowboys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah! Too slow, I suppose. Prefer gangsters, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>... You insulting...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kid me, Miss Majesty Stewart.... Listen, let me
  tell you something while I&rsquo;ve a chance. Your dad is swell. A grand guy.
  And if you were a credit to him you&rsquo;d not have this crowd of yours out
  here now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;And&mdash;why?&rdquo; gasped Madge, as if stifled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s in trouble&mdash;deep&mdash;without your fast
  crowd to make it worse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment the humming car sped over the brow of the slope to draw
  swiftly up to the waiting group. The driver was Ren Starr. As he stopped,
  Gene espied the tip of a rifle barrel sticking above the door, and in the
  back seat a pile of duffel, topped with a saddle and bedroll.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, folks,&rdquo; he said, laconically. &ldquo;Heah we all
  air.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Ren, you look like bizness,&rdquo; returned Danny Mains,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Starr,&rdquo; added Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, you got another new cowboy. Right heah an&rsquo; now.... Ah,
  Miss Majesty, I shore am glad to see you back home. Hope it&rsquo;s fer
  good.... An&rsquo; heah&rsquo;s my new pard, Lance Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darn glad to see you, Starr,&rdquo; rejoined Sidway, eager and
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gather around, Gene and Danny. You&rsquo;ll get an earful,&rdquo;
  announced the newcomer, and as the three leaned over his car he whispered,
  directly to Sidway: &ldquo;Pard, yore trucks rolled in no more&rsquo;n a
  couple of hours ago. Stopped at the big garage acrost the street. I got most
  damn curious. An&rsquo; when the six drivers mosied into the lunchroom I went
  round aboot to peep into the trucks. <i>Empty!</i>... Graves, the new hired
  hand at the garage, was pilin&rsquo; up, gas, oil, water, air. And he give it
  away thet the trucks was stayin&rsquo; over, mebbe all night. Like hell they
  will! Pard, these air yore canvas-covered cattle-rustlin&rsquo; trucks. Them
  drivers air timed fer tonight. Gene, they&rsquo;re gonna make one of them
  two-bit raids on yore cattle. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell the world
  they&rsquo;re gonna get a helluva jar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gene swore under his breath, and feeling a handclasp on his arm, he turned
  to see Madge, pale, with dilating eyes of purple fire, close behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you gasoline hound!&rdquo; declared Danny Mains. &ldquo;Back
  on the job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Starr, you&rsquo;ve more hunch than that. Spill it,&rdquo; said
  Sidway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I seen a rider&mdash;stranger&mdash;who&rsquo;d been
  hangin&rsquo; aboot all day&mdash;go into thet lunchroom. He was the
  go-between. An&rsquo; then I beat it fer heah.&rdquo;</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">MADGE&rsquo;S unexpected encounter with Uhl at the parking
  place, where she had failed to find Sidway, made her abruptly conscious of
  the fact that her indiscreet affair with the gangster had lost its interest
  for her. She admitted this to herself while concealing her annoyance from
  Uhl. Her impulses were quick and she gave in to them daringly, up to a
  certain point. But she was just as keen to divine when a new one had
  superseded the old. She did not even have to see Uhl to realize that the man
  she expected to meet had effaced the fascination of the strange, cold-eyed
  and masterful gangster. Looking at Uhl, listening to him, Madge felt relief
  that this was so. She regretted her short flirtation with him. And presently
  it occurred to her that the thing to do was to get him away, drop him
  somewhere, and then come back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jump in, Honey Bee,&rdquo; she said, brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too
  late for my date here and must rush back to campus. Where can I drop
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, baby, you can&rsquo;t flag me that way,&rdquo; retorted Uhl,
  getting in beside her. &ldquo;I know where there&rsquo;s a speak close.
  Let&rsquo;s have a drink&mdash;and a chin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I simply haven&rsquo;t the time. I
  can&rsquo;t even run you downtown. I&rsquo;ll have to drop you at the first
  streetcar corner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me ride on streetcars? That&rsquo;s a kick.... What&rsquo;s the
  dope on this newspaper stuff about you this morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn tough break! I wasn&rsquo;t to blame for that campus riot. But
  I&rsquo;ll tell you.... Say, Thursday. Give me a ring, and I&rsquo;ll meet
  you,&rdquo; said Madge, and she slowed up and halted on a corner.</p>

  <p>Uhl left the car ungraciously, plainly against his will. That steely
  something about him which had appealed to Madge did not affect her again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? I&rsquo;ve called you twice and nothing doing. That
  doesn&rsquo;t go with me, sweetheart. I don&rsquo;t wait on no
  girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve found me a new species, as I you,&rdquo;
  returned Madge. &ldquo;Sorry. Bye. I&rsquo;ll be seeing you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d better be,&rdquo; Madge heard, and then she had flashed
  across the intersection. The dumb cluck! Whatever had possessed her to let
  him sit down beside her that day at André&rsquo;s? Madge reflected she was
  not so much to blame as Dixie Cune. But before she had circled several blocks
  to get back to the parking place she had forgotten Uhl. Then, half an hour
  late, she drove to the rendezvous, and did an unprecedented thing&mdash;she
  waited half an hour longer for this Oregon boy who loved his sister and his
  horse Umpqua. Not until Madge thought of how long she had waited, how much
  she wanted to see him again, did she realize that her weakness for new faces,
  new adventures, had in this instance established an extraordinary parallel.
  How nice he was! How different! And evidently he had not felt that way about
  her. Madge suffered a new sensation akin to pique, and that melted into
  disappointment. Here was one fellow who would not call her up to make a date.
  He did not even know her name. Why had she not told him and the phone number
  of the house? Nevertheless on the way back to campus her injured feelings
  were assuaged by an inexplicable premonition that she would meet him
  again.</p>

  <p>Fraternity Row appeared to be more than usually crowded with cars. All the
  houses had several parked out in front. Madge pulled into the driveway and
  ran into the living room. All her senior sorority sisters, except Maramee,
  were there, with two boys from the Tau Phi house. The circle did not, as was
  its wont, let out a whoop as she entered. They all looked pretty glum and
  their greetings were forced. Madge now prepared for the worst.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sharp-voiced boy friend of yours just called up, Madge.
  Uhl&rsquo;s the name. Has he a string on you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was foolish enough to let him think so,&rdquo; rejoined Madge.
  &ldquo;You all look like death&rsquo;s-heads. What&rsquo;s the worst? I can
  take it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, I just came from campus,&rdquo; replied Rollie Stevens.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve called a meeting for tomorrow morning. Looks like
  curtains for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I met the Dean just now,&rdquo; said Pequita Nelson, reluctantly.
  &ldquo;She is afraid&mdash;because you already were on probation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, if you hadn&rsquo;t pulled so many stunts this
  semester!&rdquo; exclaimed her roommate and her closest friend, Allie Leland.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hate to expel you&mdash;at this late
  date&mdash;graduation right at hand&mdash;and you an honor student. But ever
  since you were elected in your junior year
  you&rsquo;ve&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t heap it on, Allie.... I&rsquo;ve been a damn fool. But
  I had a lot of fun. For myself I wouldn&rsquo;t care&mdash;much&mdash;only
  it&rsquo;ll reflect on the house. And if Dad and Mom see the papers&mdash;Oh,
  that&rsquo;ll hurt.... After all, I didn&rsquo;t egg on the students to throw
  that party.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can vouch for that, Majesty,&rdquo; admitted Rollie gloomily.
  &ldquo;I did. I collected some of the boys and we went to the President. He
  was swell. But...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, that was darling of you. I&rsquo;m obliged. If it were up
  to him I&rsquo;d come through. Mad Everett, however, has it in for me.... How
  about a bull session this time tomorrow? About my ranch party.... Rollie, be
  sure my boy friends come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! In that case we&rsquo;ll have to hold your session in the
  chapel. You couldn&rsquo;t park them here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie Stevens, I said my boy friends,&rdquo; retorted Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I one&mdash;or just a messenger boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re number one, when you&rsquo;re nice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was never obvious to me, Majesty.... Then I&rsquo;m to page
  Barg&mdash;Dawson&mdash;Nate&mdash;Brand?&mdash;Here my judgment, not my
  imagination, halts shrinkingly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You left out Snake!&rdquo; protested Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That muscle man?&mdash;Majesty!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? I get you. But I like him. I wonder if I have a horse that
  can hold him up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d take an elephant,&rdquo; chimed in Allie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Majesty,&rdquo; importuned Pequita, eloquently. &ldquo;Will
  footballer and cowboy mix?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have something beside drinks and dances,&rdquo;
  averred Madge, and then she thought of her champion. &ldquo;If I had only had
  a chance to ask <i>him</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rollie threw up his hands and departed, and presently Madge and her
  roommate were upstairs on the third floor, in their light colorful room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; asked Allie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Him!&mdash;Why the wonderful fellow who slugged the cop and saved
  me from being pinched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t heard of him. Madge, you can dig up more romance and
  more trouble than any girl on campus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather a doubtful distinction, Allie, darling. If they expel me
  I&rsquo;ll have to think about myself at long last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t. Why, they&rsquo;d be afraid the senior class
  would walk out on them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dinner that night was not the usual merry gathering. Madge seemed the only
  cheerful girl in the house. She felt a thickening atmosphere of disaster. Her
  friends knew, perhaps, what she could only anticipate, and they were
  stricken. Soon after supper Madge phoned to break an engagement and went to
  her room and presently to bed. When Allie came in and crept into
  Madge&rsquo;s bed and into her arms to weep unrestrainedly&mdash;then Madge
  made certain of the worst. She did not sleep well until late. At breakfast
  she missed the girls. Summoned to the office on campus she went with her chin
  up and her face tranquil, but inwardly she felt a little sick. She had an
  interview with the Vice-President, and it was short. The directors of the
  college had expelled her. They had to take into account the fact of her
  former derelictions and that she had been on probation. To overlook this last
  escapade would be establishing a precedent that would have a very bad effect.
  Madge accepted the decree gracefully, without a word of self-defense, and
  left the embarrassed official to go out, and cross the campus for the last
  time.</p>

  <p>For her own sake Madge did not care particularly. She was tired of
  college, and traditions, such as graduating and receiving a degree, had never
  held any significance for her. She felt she had absorbed everything that this
  university could give her that would ever have any meaning in her life. When
  she crossed the row she did not look back at the campus, and knew that she
  never would again.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, up in her room alone Madge shed some bitter hot tears. She
  had loved that room, and to realize its intimacies, its joys and sorrows, its
  plans and stunts, were over forever struck her with her first deep grief. But
  in an hour Madge, to all appearances, was her old self again, and had turned
  her facile mind upon the problem ahead of her.</p>

  <p>There was trouble out in her Arizona home. Long ago she had sensed that.
  And it was high time she returned there to take up the burden, whatever it
  was, for her beloved parents. Madge knew she was going home to stay. A trip
  now and then to the coast, and perhaps an occasional one East, would suffice
  her. Before she had come to college the lonely range, the stately Spanish
  ranch house, the horses, and her lovely soft-spoken, stately mother, and her
  stalwart father, had filled her life with action and excitement and love. Now
  that she was a woman, they would be all the more to her. And somewhere there
  was a man like her Dad... but she dismissed that disturbing thought.</p>

  <p>Allie came in at the lunch hour to disrupt Madge&rsquo;s concentration on
  a long-considered task, that of making a list of things to select and order
  for the ranch. Once given up to that occupation, Madge found it absorbing.
  &ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; she begged of Allie, &ldquo;fetch me up some food.
  Anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A long while seemed to have elapsed when at four o&rsquo;clock Madge
  tripped downstairs, in a new and striking gown, to meet the bull session.
  Rollie had them all there, even to the hulking Snake Elwell, whose rosy
  cherub-like visage for once wore an intelligent expression. As Madge stood in
  the wide door the faces of her friends flashed expectantly and tragically at
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friends, Romans, Countrymen&mdash;don&rsquo;t look like
  that!&rdquo; she cried, gayly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. And I can take it!...
  I&rsquo;ve asked you all here to talk over my cherished dream&mdash;to have
  you out to the ranch. Do I need to sell the idea to any one of
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo; came the concerted reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay then. Here&rsquo;s the dirt. I want you to arrive on the
  twentieth or as near that date as possible. There are eleven of us. Allie
  will come in my little car, Nate driving; unless darling, you&rsquo;d prefer
  Brand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ow! Ow!&rdquo; squealed Nate. &ldquo;That is a hot one. Majesty,
  damn your honest tongue!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll match you for that honor,&rdquo; spoke up Brand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on&mdash;if you got a nickel to toss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When that dire contingency was settled in Nate&rsquo;s favor Madge went
  on, consulting her notes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The rest of you can come in two cars, that is, by expressing most
  of your baggage. Jot this down... Bolton, Arizona. And ship your baggage
  three days ahead, so it will be there.... Rollie&rsquo;s big car for one.
  Dawson has one. And Snake, whose big bus is it I&rsquo;ve seen you
  in&mdash;with a red-headed girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, it belongs to Bu&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t get it unless I
  bring her along,&rdquo; said Elwell, awkwardly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Snake&rsquo;s on the spot,&rdquo; shouted Rollie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t wiggle like a snake through this field,&rdquo;
  declared Madge, laughing. &ldquo;Bu who?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, never mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, it&rsquo;s Beulah Allen,&rdquo; declared one of the boys,
  sotto voce.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That number!&rdquo; ejaculated Rollie, aghast. &ldquo;Swell kid,
  Majesty&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid she would disrupt the sweet tenor of our
  Tau Phi constancy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You telling me?&rdquo; retorted Madge. &ldquo;I know Beulah. Snake,
  it&rsquo;s up to you. Do you want her, for herself and not for her
  car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go into a huddle, Snake,&rdquo; taunted someone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, do you like Bu?&rdquo; countered the athlete, earnestness
  stronger than his confusion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly I like her, or I wouldn&rsquo;t consider her. But, Snake,
  if you&rsquo;re crazy about her.... Cowboys and <i>vaqueros</i> are even more
  susceptible than students.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance, and Madge, you&rsquo;re a peach,&rdquo;
  declared Elwell, in red relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; said Madge, when the roar subsided, and
  she checked her list. &ldquo;You can fight among yourselves who&rsquo;s going
  to ride with whom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, sweetest, get down to it&mdash;Clothes!&mdash;What&rsquo;ll
  we need to wear?&rdquo; burst out Maramee Joyce.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your ruling passion, Maramee, for once will be foiled....
  We&rsquo;re on a ranch you know&mdash;grand place to wear out all your old
  clothes. Mostly outdoor stuff, both heavy and light; your riding togs and
  don&rsquo;t forget a bathing suit. In fact, girls, I want you&mdash;if you
  have to come without a stitch to your backs,&rdquo; declared Madge,
  warmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits us swell!&rdquo; yelled the boys. &ldquo;And
  Majesty&mdash;&rdquo; added Rollie, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re tired of pink teas and
  cakes, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending over cases and cases,&rdquo; replied Madge,
  radiantly. And when the row had subsided she continued: &ldquo;I can supply
  anything in the world but happy hearts. You must bring them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hours on end making up lists. It&rsquo;ll take two
  full days to shop. Oh, some job! And then I&rsquo;m off. No more dates. The
  sooner I go the better, dear friends.... That&rsquo;s my say&mdash;for
  my&mdash;last bull session!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She fled in a silence that hurt.</p>

  <p>Early and late for three days Madge shopped in the Los Angeles stores. At
  night she packed, with Allie to help, and sometimes Pequita or Selma. What a
  relief when the expressman took her trunks away! At length all her tasks were
  done, even to the packing of bags in her car. Next morning when she awoke the
  sun was flashing on the vine-covered walls of the chapel. With Allie in her
  pajamas, Madge tiptoed down the stairs, passed the closed doors of her
  sisters, and hurried to the garage. Her last load of baggage was stowed
  away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me&mdash;cry&mdash;&rdquo; she whispered, huskily,
  to the weeping mute Allie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to drive some.... Tell them
  all&mdash;good-by...
  darling&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;be&mdash;seeing...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge drove out with blurred eyes that did not clear until she rounded the
  corner and turned her back to the campus forever. An early rising student
  halloed, but she did not look. The constriction in her throat eased as she
  threaded into the traffic. It was over&mdash;college and all that went with
  it. Madge did not deceive herself. All these lovely contacts would sever and
  fade away in the conflicting tides of new and wider life.</p>

  <p>Not to press down on the accelerator seemed harder to resist than ever. In
  one of the suburban towns Madge stopped for breakfast and to send telegrams
  home. To her sorority sisters she wired: &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well. I&rsquo;ll
  be seeing you.&rdquo; Soon then she faced the long orange-grove&mdash;and
  vineyard-bordered road, and here she drove the powerful car up to sixty along
  the straight stretches. Madge loved to drive, to speed, to feel the impact of
  wind, to see the narrow thread of road flash under her, and the blurred
  greens pass by. By ten o&rsquo;clock she was in Banning, where she halted for
  fuel. The service man paid Madge and her car an admiring gaze.</p>

  <p>A hot furnacelike breath waved into Madge&rsquo;s face up from the long
  Gorgonio Pass, as she left Banning. Once, however, under way again, the
  pressing air felt cool to her. At Indio she had a bite to eat and a malted
  milk, then leaving her car at a service station she crossed out of the copper
  sun to the shade of cottonwoods. These green full-foliaged trees, like the
  pines, were reminiscent of her ranch, and the ranges of the West. Palms and
  orange trees belonged to California, somehow removed from Arizona. A sultry
  breeze blew off the desert, tinged with an acrid dust, that felt gritty to
  her moist hands. Gloves were almost intolerable, and the skin of her lips and
  cheeks felt drying up. Nevertheless she welcomed this dry heat. Soon she
  would be across the desert, up on the sage ranges of Arizona, where the air
  was different. The sun could shine down hot, but in the shade the air felt
  cool. Then in her beloved home state there was never that copper sky or the
  blurred distance which she saw now. San Jacinto stood up shrouded in heat;
  smoky veils curled up from the gray weed-spotted desert; the ragged line of
  the barren ranges stretched south to fade in the distance; the pale expanse
  of the Salton Sea gleamed in the hollow of the valley, its salty shore line
  ghastly and weird.</p>

  <p>Madge walked a few minutes under the cottonwoods, despite the discomfort.
  The next two hundred miles and more would be the most trying of this drive.
  To traverse a long stretch of flat country below sea level was far from a joy
  ride in June. Madge, rested from nervous strain, went back to her car to
  resume her journey. From Indio to El Centro Madge reveled in speed and the
  rare delight of catapulting through space. Beyond El Centro, where she halted
  for a little while, sunset caught her in the dunes, those exquisitely
  graceful curves and mounds and scallops of sand, beginning to color with opal
  tints, and shadow darkly away from the sun. This five-mile stretch was the
  only one on the journey that she longed to acquire for Arizona. Through that
  stately region Madge drove at a snail&rsquo;s pace, and rediscovered her love
  of color and symmetry and solitude. She felt like a Navajo at sunset, part of
  the nature she watched.</p>

  <p>When dusk mantled the black lava point of Pilot Knob, and dim purple
  Picacho, Madge sighted the lights of Yuma and soon the broad Colorado,
  chafing in sullen flood away into the darkness of a bend toward the
  south.</p>

  <p>In a few more minutes she crossed the bridge into Arizona, and drove to
  the Alcatraz, a new hotel where she had stayed coming and going on her visit
  home the preceding summer. Her head and eyes ached, and her body was stiff
  from the long drive. And hungry and thirsty as she was she enjoyed the luxury
  of a bath and change before going downstairs. Apparently there were only a
  few guests at the hotel. After finishing a light dinner Madge went out to
  walk up and down the street and send some telegrams. The night was sultry and
  warm, with no air stirring, but she required exercise more than comfort. She
  walked to a corner and back. Mexicans with sloe-black eyes passed her, and a
  group of the lofty statured Yuma Indians who wrapped their long hair in a
  coil on top of their heads and set a cake of mud upon it. The glaring twin
  lights of cars loomed and passed by. Madge did not succumb to an impulse to
  walk down to the main street. Yuma was fascinating at any hour, especially
  after nightfall.</p>

  <p>A long black car had drawn up to the curb before the hotel. Madge, as she
  passed it, heard a low exclamation, then quick footsteps. A slim hand with
  fingers like steel clutched her arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gold-top, what you doing here?&rdquo; called a sharp voice, cold as
  ice. Madge knew to whom it belonged before she turned to see Uhl, bareheaded
  under the electric light, his eyes glittering from his pale face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;hello&mdash;this is a surprise,&rdquo; replied Madge,
  haltingly, as her wits leaped to meet the situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. On my way home,&rdquo; she said, slowly, fighting a confusion
  of thought. She did not like his look nor the hard clutch on her arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home! Say, what kind of a twist are you? Told me you lived in Santa
  Barbara.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I? Will you be good enough to let go my arm? You
  hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come for a ride,&rdquo; he returned, in a voice that brooked no
  opposition to his will and he almost dragged her toward the big black
  car.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; rejoined Madge, as, supple and strong, with one
  wrench she freed herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. Drove all day. See you
  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like hell you will! Same as phone calls. I&rsquo;m seeing you right
  now. Get that, baby!&rdquo; He was neither angry nor insolent. His face had
  the clear cold chiseling of a diamond. Madge was not afraid of him, but she
  realized that she should be. She wavered between turning her back upon him
  and asking him into the hotel. The important thing was to get in off the
  street, and acting upon that she said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk here. Come
  in for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl hung close to her, hand at her elbow, and did not speak while they
  went through the lobby. He steered Madge into a back room with subdued
  lights, where several couples sat at tables, drinking. Here Uhl led her to a
  seat at a corner table and ordered cocktails from the attendant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of a deal are you giving me, sister?&rdquo; he began,
  forcefully, as he leaned toward her across the table. All about him was cold,
  suspicious, repellent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deal?&rdquo; she queried, playing for time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You knew I fell for you. I told you. And you met me, danced and
  drank with me. Then when I get stuck deep you try to pull this
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be seeing you&rsquo; gag. That doesn&rsquo;t go.
  See?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Uhl, I seem to see that you have misunderstood me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Nothing doing, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you wish to put it that way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He controlled what must have been a murderous fire, judging from the
  instant lowering of his blazing eyes and the quiver of his slim hands.
  Strangely, this reaction of his again restored a certain fascination he had
  exerted over Madge, she felt that it was almost an attraction of repugnance.
  She had had too much adulation, too many at her feet. There was in her,
  unconsciously, a primitive longing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;ve gone nuts over some dames,&rdquo; began Uhl
  deliberately, apparently having suppressed his violent feelings. &ldquo;But
  none ever held a copper to you. I&rsquo;m horribly in love with you,
  sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve allowed it to go so far,&rdquo;
  murmured Madge. &ldquo;Any girl would be flattered and.... But, you see,
  I&rsquo;m engaged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? What&rsquo;s that to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, I&rsquo;m sure. But I know a girl
  can&rsquo;t accept serious attentions from one man when she&rsquo;s engaged
  to another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hell dames can&rsquo;t. They do. They all do... Aw, Beauty,
  don&rsquo;t be such a plaster. I&rsquo;m crazy about you.... If you&rsquo;re
  alone here tonight let me....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge felt his slim hand slide upon her knee under the table. His eyes,
  gray as molten metal had a hypnotic power. For a moment she felt paralyzed.
  Then her rigidity broke to a start, to a stinging heat, to an insupportable
  sensation. That tearing thing seemed to actuate Madge more than Uhl&rsquo;s
  outrage. In a fury she kicked out with all her might. And her onslaught sent
  the man sprawling over his chair. Madge almost overturned the table as she
  leaped up. Wheeling she fled from the room, and never stopped until she
  backed up against her locked door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Serves you damn&mdash;right!&rdquo; she panted, passionately.
  &ldquo;Playing with a heel like him!... Are you ever&mdash;going to
  think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge hardly had time to think then. Hurried steps in the hall preceded a
  knock on the door. Another knock, louder, followed, and the handle of the
  door was tried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she called.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bee. Let me in. I want to square myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it&mdash;from that side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was out of my head. I&rsquo;ll come clean. You&rsquo;re not like
  other dames.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Uhl. You discovered that rather late. But I take the
  blame for your mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference to me. I want to talk to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to listen.... But I&rsquo;ll see you in
  the morning. At breakfast. Eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she replied, thinking
  that might be a way to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, baby. But don&rsquo;t string me again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl&rsquo;s voice had an ominous ring that jarred unpleasantly upon
  Madge&rsquo;s ruffled nerves. Uhl was dangerous. Recalling his bragging, the
  roll of bills he exhibited, his extraordinary intimation of some kind of
  power, which Madge now analyzed as underworld, she realized that she might be
  in actual peril and by no means should she encounter him again. She
  determined to be a hundred miles and more beyond Yuma by eight o&rsquo;clock
  next morning. Following that decision her first impulse was to telephone the
  desk to leave a call for five o&rsquo;clock, but she thought better of it.
  She always awakened early, provided she went to bed early. This she did at
  once, and eventually fell asleep.</p>

  <p>The roaring of a motor truck awakened Madge. She hardly seemed to have
  done more than close her eyes. Ruddy light on the desert ridges attested to
  sunrise. Her wrist watch said ten minutes to five. By five o&rsquo;clock she
  was at the desk downstairs, paying her bill. She told the night clerk, in
  case anyone asked, that she had received a telegram which recalled her to Los
  Angeles. In another ten minutes she was speeding east on the Arizona
  highway.</p>

  <p>The morning was fresh and cool. A line of fire rimmed the ranges. No cars,
  no curves on the empty black road ahead gave full rein to her desire and her
  need to drive fast. Sixty miles an hour had been her conservative limit,
  except a few times on short favorable stretches. Here Madge had the course
  and the incentive to increase her speed to seventy and more. The motor droned
  like a homing bee. It ate up the miles. At eighty miles on the indicator
  Madge tasted the last complete and full elation of the speedster. The
  telegraph poles were almost as fence posts.</p>

  <p>Madge never looked back once. She drove under the urge that Uhl was
  pursuing her and that she could run away from him. At Gila Bend where the
  highway forked she slowed down and took the right branch, then opened up
  again. Mohawk, Aztec, Sentinel&mdash;the stations that she knew well were
  overtaken and passed by. At Casa Grande, while the car was being refueled and
  gone over, she had breakfast and lunch in one. From there Madge again faced
  the waving colored desert, with its black buttes and red ranges, ever growing
  rougher. But she took little account of it or of the hours. She was bent on a
  record drive. Tucson for once was not interesting, only as a service station;
  and the quaint Tombstone and bustling Bisbee only obstacles on the road. Late
  that day, which had flashed by like the hamlets, Madge drove into Douglas
  with the most perfect satisfaction for a driving mania she had ever
  experienced.</p>

  <p>She stopped at an automobile camp, had her dinner at a lunch counter, and
  by eight o&rsquo;clock she was in bed, her eyelids heavy. Her last thought
  was of what she would do on the morrow to the hundred-odd miles between
  Douglas and Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho.</p>

  <p>Next morning she was on the way by six o&rsquo;clock, after having
  breakfasted. She would have made the run to Bolton in an hour but for the
  fact that she was held back by a detour, and some heavily laden, slow-moving
  canvas-covered trucks that simply stuck to the middle of the road. They
  annoyed her so that she thought that she would not soon forget them, nor one
  of the drivers, a swarthy visaged fellow who glared at her when at last with
  incessant honking she forced him over.</p>

  <p>At Bolton Madge tarried long enough to leave orders with the stationmaster
  about her baggage and freight due to arrive. Then she refueled again, and
  drove on, beginning to feel strangely happy&mdash;with the journey almost
  ended, with turmoil behind her, and rest and home almost gained.</p>

  <p>But when she struck off the highway beyond the culvert, up the old rancho
  road, which proved to be annoyingly full of lumps and gutters and rocks, she
  passed from an amused impatience to a burst of temper. She endured the
  jolting and the messing of her baggage and packages for some miles, then she
  had to drive slowly. What an atrocious road! And she with a crowd of guests
  due in less than two weeks! How would three truckloads of purchases ever
  safely negotiate that trail for steers and cowboys? Did her father have that
  same old loafing bunch of <i>vaqueros</i>? She would hire a gang of Mexicans
  to make a decent road out of it pronto. It took Madge three quarters of an
  hour to drive from the culvert to the summit of the slope&mdash;approximately
  fifteen miles.</p>

  <p>Madge, surmounting the slope, abruptly to face the vast purple valley,
  with its arresting black knoll topped by the gray mansion which was her home,
  and the grand uplifting range beyond, stopped the car to gaze as one in
  transport. How astoundingly familiar! She had only to see to realize that all
  these blue distances and splendid landmarks were veritably a part of herself.
  But absence and life too full for memory had come between them, and her
  thought and her love, now suddenly leaping to vivid and poignant life again.
  The morning was still fresh; shadows still lingered under the ridges; every
  wash and rock shone white; the waves of sage rolled on and on, in an endless
  sea, dotted with cattle; the league-long slope up to the knoll had a
  beautiful sweep; and there peeping out of the black pines, lonely and superb,
  stood the mansion of the old Dons. As a fitting background the mountains
  loomed impressively, white-slided and black-canyoned, upflung in rock
  battlements to the blue sky.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, darling, darling home!&rdquo; cried Madge, in rapture and
  reproach. &ldquo;I have been faithless. But I have come back. For good!
  Forever, to you&mdash;to my home&mdash;to the love and life I shall find
  here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The moment of exaltation was difficult for Madge, inasmuch as she had a
  vague realization that she was not big enough, not good enough for this noble
  country, nor for the devoted mother and father who awaited her coming. But
  she had a clear conception that if she were true to the emotion this
  magnificent scene had aroused in her heart, she would grow far toward being
  worthy of it. That thought persisted helpfully, too strong even for her
  misgivings.</p>

  <p>She drove on. The descent into the valley afforded swifter travel. She had
  left rocks and ruts behind. Soon she was down to a level, on a white road,
  six inches deep in dust; and here she cut loose again with a shriek of joy,
  to shoot ahead of the yellow clouds that puffed up from the wheels. The wash
  in the center was sand and she hit that at a fifty-mile clip, to veer and
  leap and plunge, the wheel lurching under her strong grip, and roar safely
  across to another strip of dust. Beyond that the long slope of yellow road
  was like a country lane, with its two narrow wheel strips, its weedy center,
  its hard ground. Madge hummed up that, out of the grass and sage, into the
  pines, and on up the shaded brown-matted aisle to the green oval before the
  stately mansion.</p>

  <p>And on the porch, telescope in hand, her eyes deeply dark with joy stood
  her mother. Madge pressed the brake so forcibly that the great car, answering
  with a grinding scream on gravel, stopped so suddenly that she and the bags
  had a violent jerk. Madge threw off gloves, goggles, hat all in one swift
  action, and leaping out she ran up the steps into her mother&rsquo;s
  arms.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>They were inside, in the living room, and Madge, wiping her eyes was
  saying: &ldquo;Fancy <i>me</i> being such a baby! But somehow it&rsquo;s
  different this time. Coming home!... Let me look at you, Mom darling... . Oh,
  the same lovely patrician mother!&mdash;But, darling, you <i>have</i> some
  gray in this beautiful hair&mdash;and a few lines I never saw before. But
  you&rsquo;re more perfect than ever!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge! How you rave!&rdquo; exclaimed her mother, her voice low.
  &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s worth a great deal to have you home&mdash;and hear you
  talk like that.... I hope it&rsquo;s not all&mdash;let me say,
  remorse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mom!</i>... Come, let&rsquo;s not stand all day. My legs are
  weak.... I&rsquo;ll sit on the arm of your chair.... There,&rdquo; and Madge
  slipped her arm around her mother and drew the handsome head to her shoulder.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the little girl who has courage to confess&mdash;but who
  would rather not face her mother&rsquo;s loving eyes.... Let me get it over,
  darling.... You had my letters&mdash;my telegrams?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand, Madge. You need not tell me anything. I went to
  college once. And all these years you&rsquo;ve been away&mdash;these hard and
  changing years&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried to keep abreast of the times, even if
  it was only through newspapers and magazines and books. Most of all, your
  letters have told me. I know what has gone on, what has come to pass, even if
  I have trouble grasping it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom, I knew you&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; replied Madge, earnestly.
  &ldquo;But I doubt, Mother darling, that with all your intelligence and
  wisdom you could realize what has actually happened to us, to my generation.
  Somehow I can&rsquo;t get it. Yet they call me brainy, Mom. You&rsquo;ll get
  some firsthand information soon. My crowd of sorority sisters and student
  friends will be here to spend the summer. They are normal, as young people go
  today. They are all radical. But I&rsquo;ll let you judge them for yourself.
  ... My self, Mom, this contrite daughter returned to you, is an enigma to
  herself.... I hate restraint. I won&rsquo;t be told what I should or should
  not do. I have no idea what I want, except that I want something terribly. I
  read trash where once I read poetry, history, fiction. I&rsquo;ve read Freud
  and he&rsquo;s all wet. My favorite authors at present are Cabell and the
  best detective writers, wide apart as the poles. Most grownups give me a pain
  in the neck. But you don&rsquo;t, Mom! I am scared of Dad, though as a girl I
  worshiped him. He was my hero, my <i>El Capitan</i>, as he was yours. But
  will he get me&mdash;my crowd?... In my freshman year I went a little
  haywire&mdash;drinking, dancing, petting, smoking&mdash;<i>all</i>, Mom,
  except I didn&rsquo;t go the limit. I tell you that, a little ashamed, as if
  I were an old-fashioned virgin. But college girls, except some who are fools,
  work out of that worst mess in their upper-classman years. Still the pace is
  swift, Mom, in education, achievement, in a social way, in the modern
  thing.... For young people that modern thing seems to be to break all the
  laws&mdash;speed laws, booze laws! There is no such thing as modesty, as I
  remember you taught it to me. Pagans, I fear! I haven&rsquo;t opened a Bible
  since my religion course during my sophomore year. Lastly, Mom, don&rsquo;t
  think that <i>all</i> co-eds fall under this category. There are loads and
  loads of girls besides. Only my crowd, and the other sorority
  crowds&mdash;they get by the college courses somehow, though a few like me
  gain class honors and high scholarships&mdash;only for these the aim and end
  of existence are cocktails, dances, clothes, cars and men.... There, Mom,
  darling, that&rsquo;s all. Will I dare tell Dad&mdash;and will he
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied her mother, quietly, after a moment fraught
  with suspense for Madge, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should tell your
  father&mdash;all that.... And there&mdash;his step in the patio!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her father entered, sending Madge&rsquo;s blood rushing back to her heart,
  still the stalking giant with the piercing eyes she remembered, yet somehow
  indefinably changed. Was it the white over his temples&mdash;the hollow
  cheeks and lean jaw? Then followed the greeting, the embrace, which made
  Madge mistress of that errant and incredible weakness, leaving only the
  resurgence of her girlish love for her ideal of all men. During the disposal
  of her luggage in her rooms, so thrillingly the same, and the luncheon
  afterward, Madge babbled on and on, listening but little, far removed from
  the honest girl she had been to her mother. She divined that she thirsted for
  something from her father&mdash;something she knew she had, beautifully and
  everlastingly, from her mother. But here was a Westerner, one of the old
  school, that daredevil <i>El Capitan</i> of the Revolution, the cowboy who
  had killed men! He had worshiped her mother, but would his love for his
  little girl survive all that the years and changes had made her?</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>After luncheon Madge leisurely unpacked her numerous bags and suitcases,
  stopping dreamily at intervals, or finding some excuse to go to her mother.
  During all this while the desire to see Nels and her horses grew stronger,
  until at length it was too demanding to resist. It need not have been
  anything to resist, if she had been able to put aside the strong desire to
  change to riding garb, and vault upon Cedar once more. Nels surely would not
  have liked her in these new English riding breeches, so tight and leggy, and
  that first day home she could not don overalls and boots. Wherefore at length
  she went down the old back road, now an overgrown trail, to gray ruin of
  ranch buildings and corrals.</p>

  <p>Nels was her second father. He had taught her to ride, to shoot, to
  rope&mdash;all the tricks of the range. He had told her the terrible stories
  about her famous father, and that lovely and appalling romance of her mother
  and all about ranch and cowboy life, even before she was old enough to
  understand.</p>

  <p>Meeting Nels proved to mean more, to be a deeper experience, than even her
  memories had anticipated. The change in him was not indefinable. Madge felt
  the warm blood recede from her cheeks. The years had told on Nels.</p>

  <p>Not until she sat with him on the top bar of the corral fence to see her
  horses did the zest and stir of home-coming return. What a glossy,
  long-maned, plume-tailed, racy and thoroughbred troop of horses! Cedar, gray
  as the cedars for which he was named, pranced before her, soft-eyed,
  whinnying, high-stepping and sensitive, knowing her yet not sure. And Range,
  the long rangy sorrel, red as fire in the rays of the setting sun; and
  Bellefontaine, that dainty proud little mare, sure of Madge, poking her nose
  up for sugar; and Blackboy, like shining coal in his well-groomed hide, and
  Sultan, the roan, and Dervish and Arab, twin whites, as perfect as the movie
  horses, but not so tame, and Leatherstocking, a range cow horse, loved
  despite his plebeian blood, and Pinto, a mustang&mdash;all her own, and the
  corral full of shaggy jealous horses and colts, snorting and
  kicking&mdash;all of them brought home to Madge the stinging truth of her
  return.</p>

  <p>But it was when she walked up the lane with Nels to encounter a Mexican
  lad leading a black horse that Madge&rsquo;s emotion flooded to a bursting
  pitch. A strange horse, a grand horse, dusty and lame, bearing a
  cowboy&rsquo;s accouterments, in one inconceivable flash, added a bitter drop
  to the sweet cup which she had just tasted. Screeching to Nels, importuning
  the lad, this got Madge nowhere. Full tilt then she ran around the corner of
  the store, straight into the arms of a clanking cowboy, gorgeously
  arrayed&mdash;a strangely familiar cowboy whose face went white and then a
  dusky red.</p>

  <p>As if by magic Madge confronted her campus champion, and under this last
  straw her burdened feelings burst in glad amaze and gay delight, to a welcome
  she did not consider and a kiss she could not recall.</p>

  <p>Could she have paid him a more flattering compliment for his cleverness in
  contriving to be there at her own home? In the following exchange of words,
  in this cowboy&rsquo;s well-simulated protest and confusion, Madge
  experienced a reaction which inwardly she divined was something more,
  something deeply and inexplicably glad. And that, at his denial, submerged
  this sweet self. What was the matter with the fool? To be sure there stood
  her dad, his piercing eyes hard to meet, and his slight amused smile
  disconcerting. But even so, Madge argued to her ruffled vanity, her welcome,
  her kiss should have inspired him to confront half a dozen fathers and
  confess his duplicity.</p>

  <p>It was the horse Umpqua that saved the embarrassing situation for the
  moment, and which precipitated a really serious one. Madge left them, furious
  with the cowboy. She spied upon the group below from the covert of pines,
  curious even in her anger to see what Sidway would do. There was no doubt
  about the sincerity of his purpose, when he went to his horse. He meant to
  ride away. And would have done so but for her father and Nels.
  &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he take it, the big handsome stiff?&rdquo; muttered Madge,
  in her angry surprise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d he beat me here for if not to make
  a hit with me? It did!... And&mdash;I was hit before.... Oh, the dumbbell! To
  spoil it all!... Now I&rsquo;ll have to jolly him along and play with him to
  get that horse&mdash;when I really liked him... how much? ... Am I burned
  up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By the time Madge had told the story, with reservations as to her own
  uncertain feelings, to her mother, her resentment had gone into eclipse. She
  could not bear ill will. And she had developed a merciless truth about
  herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is young Sidway like?&rdquo; asked her mother, presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, swell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is rather an ambiguous term these days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;d hate to spoil a pleasant surprise for you. Also
  I&rsquo;d like to get your reaction to Sidway before I tell you mine. I may
  be&mdash;I must have been all wet, if you get what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, my dearest,&rdquo; replied her mother, with a
  bewildered smile. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure you like him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&mdash;I did, yes.... The dirty look he gave
  me&mdash;what he said!... Such things just aren&rsquo;t done to
  <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge leisurely changed for dinner, and after catching herself approving
  of the white image in the long mirror, she had the grace to be ponderingly
  amused at that part of her thought which conceived a possibility of Sidway
  seeing her thus. No telling where that Hollywood extra might bob up! She
  arrived late in the dining room, yet in time to hear her father say:
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have gone, too, Madeline, if Nels and I hadn&rsquo;t
  believed him when he swore he didn&rsquo;t come here on account of
  Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Dad Stewart!&rdquo; declared Madge, in mock solemnity.
  &ldquo;So that cowboy put it over?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daughter! You look like your mother&mdash;the first time I ever saw
  her in white!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Dad! Then I must look just stunning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do.... Madge, young Sidway didn&rsquo;t put it over. He told
  the truth. Nels believed him. So did I. He hadn&rsquo;t the remotest idea
  that my daughter, the girl Ren Starr told him about, was you&mdash;the girl
  he&rsquo;d actually met and befriended.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, he&rsquo;s a liar. I wouldn&rsquo;t believe that on a
  bet,&rdquo; declared Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you find it out and you&rsquo;ll be
  sorry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preposterous! So he put up a big bluff to you and Nels?... Dad,
  that cowboy is right up to date. He knows his stuff.... What I can&rsquo;t
  get is why he was ashamed of his clever stunt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, it&rsquo;s conceivable that he seemed ashamed because of his
  innocence when all of you believed in his deceit,&rdquo; observed her
  mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my adorable parents! What you must learn about us! Mr.
  Sidway&rsquo;s ears must be burning. Let&rsquo;s forget him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, despite her suggestion, Madge had no slight difficulty in
  conforming to it. She succeeded presently by launching into an account of
  what she wanted done to the road, and the patio, and the long-deserted rooms
  in the west wing, and about more servants from the Mexican village&mdash;all
  in the interest of her guests who were to arrive on the twentieth. She was
  indeed not disappointed in her anticipation that both of her parents seemed
  heartily interested in her summer party, with no wish but to contribute in
  every way to its success. If they appeared a little bewildered several times
  during the discussion, and at a loss for words, Madge put that down to her
  elaborate and extravagant plans.</p>

  <p>They stayed up late, at least for them, and when Madge bade them good
  night, she went to her rooms thinking how perfectly splendid they were, and
  that she was happy, and the most fortunate girl in the world.</p>

  <p>Next morning she satisfied a craving that had long beset her&mdash;that of
  getting into the saddle again. To find Range gone gave quick rise to her
  temper, which strangely did not greatly fall when her father explained that
  the cowboy had merely obeyed orders. She had resolutely to keep her eyes off
  Umpqua or she would have yielded to riding him again, which pride bade her
  forego.</p>

  <p>That afternoon Madge found great enjoyment in driving her father high up
  the old road, to an elevation that permitted their gazing down upon the ranch
  and the house, and the flowing sage flats with their speckled knots of
  cattle. While her father puttered around the boxed-in spring and repaired the
  outlet, Madge sat at ease, lulled by the heights and the depths of this
  wide-spreading land.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wonder the lake and reservoir went almost dry,&rdquo; said her
  father, when he came back to the car. &ldquo;Two thirds of the water leaking
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to look at the lake. Will it be full again by the time
  my friends arrive? We&rsquo;ll want to go in bathing. Dad, is there any sand
  near enough to haul?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sand. The wash down below is all sand. Fine and white,
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell! I&rsquo;ll want a nice sandy beach for us to lie around on
  in the sun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an easy one, Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The end of a perfect day just had to have a drawback. When Madge caught
  sight of Lance Sidway leaning over the gate, apparently deeply interested in
  Bonita Mains, she fell victim to a most disconcerting irritation. The cowboy,
  as she drove up to a halt, did not noticeably move, until Bonita blushingly
  drew back, to come out of the gate. Then he stared at Madge, rather
  satirically she thought. Was there not a single man in the whole vast earth
  who did not fall for every pretty girl he saw, regardless of her color? It
  had not taken Lance Sidway long to contact the little half-breed coquette of
  the range. Madge chalked up another mark against the cowboy.</p>

  <p>The succeeding moments, outside of Danny Mains&rsquo; kindly
  welcome&mdash;Madge did not take Bonita&rsquo;s to heart&mdash;should have
  bored Madge, if she had been running true to form. But she was off her stride
  and she knew the reason, and therefore looked at that reason with rather
  scornful eyes. Her mental alertness quickened, however, when Ren
  Starr&rsquo;s car was sighted, and Bonita precipitately fled.</p>

  <p>The stab Sidway had given Madge, along with the look he gave her, silenced
  Madge, and gave rein to whirling thoughts that refused to recognize her
  wrath. She nursed it, yet succumbed to curiosity, and got out of the car to
  listen to the short talk of the men. Rustlers! Verily her home-coming had not
  been dull. Then the men fell back from Starr&rsquo;s car, Sidway to leap
  astride Range and gallop off, Mains to run into his house, and her father to
  get in with her, his fine face stern and dark, somehow recalling her fear of
  him when she was a little girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Step on it, Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad! What is it? I heard some of your talk. Trucks!
  Rustlers!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet you did.... Madge, these boys have made me feel like my old
  self. Sidway got a line on these cattle thieves. All in a day! Won&rsquo;t
  Nels jump at that? Won&rsquo;t he be pleased? And Starr ran out with news of
  a truck raid on our cattle tonight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Truck raid! Who ever heard of such a thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway got it, just like that. Keen as a whip, that cowboy. And
  Starr&rsquo;s a running pard for him.... Madge, I have a hunch things will
  look up for us this summer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, are you telling <i>me</i>?... What will you do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must tell Nels first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That old&mdash;ranger! Oh, Dad, he&rsquo;ll be for guns! horses!
  ropes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. Madge, before the night is over we&rsquo;ll hang some of
  these truck drivers and cattle-raiding greasers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child. You might get hurt.... Let me out here. I
  won&rsquo;t be up for supper. Tell Mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naturally Madge expected her mother to be greatly perturbed, but was
  agreeably surprised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This will wake up your father and Nels, too,&rdquo; rejoined her
  mother, with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Mom!... Dad swore they&rsquo;d <i>hang</i> some of them. They
  will have to catch them first. Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t I like to go?... It means a
  fight. Crooks these days use machine guns. Dad might be hurt.... And Sidway.
  He&rsquo;s a reckless devil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, your father and Nels and Danny Mains will be a match for all
  the crooks in the Southwest. Don&rsquo;t worry about them. Rustlers will give
  them just the impetus they need. And cattle raising will probably be the
  better for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless Madge did worry. She read and worried and waited until long
  after her mother had retired. Then when she did go to bed she could not
  sleep. She listened. But there were no sounds except the lonesome chirping of
  crickets and the murmuring of running water. This Lance Sidway had certainly
  injected some vim and vigor into the dead old ranch. His fine eyes, shadowed,
  troubled, and then blazing with scorn, haunted her as did that taunt about
  gangsters. She hated him, but she deserved it. Her conscience wrung that from
  her. Indeed he had kept the rendezvous that day, and bad luck have it! he had
  seen Uhl meet her, get into her car. And being Hollywood-wise he had caught
  the cut of that gentleman all in a few minutes. Not this fact, but his scorn
  was what galled Madge. Still if he had been so burned up by her friendship
  with an underworld character, why had he learned her name, where she lived,
  and conceived the brilliant idea of meeting her at her own home? The answer
  was that no matter whom she knew, what she had done, he must have conceived
  more than a mere interest in her. But was that the answer? Madge conceived
  the idea that there was a remote possibility it was not.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">LANCE stood back in the shadow of Nels&rsquo; cabin, a
  little abashed at his agitation, as he compared it to the coolness of these
  Arizonians. He did not want them to see that he was an unfledged cowboy, so
  far as rustlers were concerned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you fellers better have a smack of grub an&rsquo; a
  cup of coffee with me,&rdquo; Nels drawled, as Stewart ended his brief
  story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I hed, at thet,&rdquo; rejoined Mains. &ldquo;My two Bonitas
  would be too interested in thet confab we hed by the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all sponge on you, Nels,&rdquo; said Stewart.
  &ldquo;Pitch in, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All set &rsquo;cept fryin&rsquo; some more ham. You cut it, Danny.
  ... Whar&rsquo;s Sidway? Come heah, cowboy.... Gene, this truck
  rustlin&rsquo; is shore two-bit stuff. Kinda oot of our experience.
  Let&rsquo;s get the cowboy&rsquo;s angle on it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, you oughta be up on this automobile cattle stealin&rsquo;.
  What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll intercept this raid, of course,&rdquo; replied Lance,
  realizing that he was on the spot and forcing a calm and serious front when
  inwardly he was quaking. It reassured him that his wide sombrero hid his
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hev a slice of ham. I can cook, cowboy.... Wal, how&rsquo;d you
  intercept it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like Starr in on this with me,&rdquo; replied Sidway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means. You young bloods put your heads together,&rdquo; said
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, pard, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got some
  ideas,&rdquo; returned Starr, nonchalantly. &ldquo;But I cain&rsquo;t talk
  an&rsquo; eat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance thought with all his might. It was a situation in which he wanted to
  make good. But the fact that these old cattlemen, who had fought rustlers and
  Mexicans for over a score of years, put the responsibility up to him and
  Starr seemed more stultifying than inspiring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Starr, what hour of the night will that highway be most free of
  traffic?&rdquo; asked Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About three in the mawnin&rsquo; thar&rsquo;s a quiet spell.
  Sometimes fer two hours not a darn car goes by.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will be the time the thieves will load,&rdquo; concluded
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I agree. And even then it&rsquo;s pretty risky. Old-time rustlers
  wouldn&rsquo;t be that brazen,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, we gotta deal with a new breed of criminal,&rdquo; added
  Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like as not the drivers of these trucks won&rsquo;t be regular
  range characters. These men will be city crooks, stealing cattle as a blind.
  They are gangsters. Probably hop-heads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart&rsquo;s leonine head swept up and he transfixed Lance with
  penetrating eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, I heard you use that word hop-head less than an hour
  ago?&rdquo; he queried, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes sir... You&mdash;you may have,&rdquo; replied Lance, startled.
  But despite his qualm he kept his head. &ldquo;I can explain it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. Go on. What&rsquo;s a hop-head?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the name underworld characters give to men addicted to
  opium or heroin. They smoke or eat opium. Heroin they mostly inhale by
  smelling from the back of their hands. It&rsquo;s a powder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, the hell you say, cowboy?&rdquo; ejaculated Nels. &ldquo;Them
  hop-heads must be kinda tough nuts, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brutal killers. No mercy! No respect for law. Rats, the police call
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, they&rsquo;ll shoot if they&rsquo;re cornered, an&rsquo; if
  they have machine guns, it&rsquo;ll jest be too bad,&rdquo; interposed
  Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They must be ambushed, or at least surprised,&rdquo; went on Lance.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be waiting or driving along slow at the place nearest
  the highway&mdash;most convenient to pick up the cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s less than forty miles from where we&rsquo;re
  talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Starr. &ldquo;I spotted the blackest bunch of
  cattle on my way oot. I can drive fairly close. We&rsquo;d hev to walk the
  rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was going to suggest that,&rdquo; resumed Lance. &ldquo;But not
  to drive too close. These raiders, whose job it is to round up the cattle,
  could hear a car.... They will be mounted&mdash;acquainted with the
  range&mdash;probably living on it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In cahoots with the truck drivers. Pard. You said a
  mouthful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon he did thet same little thing,&rdquo; observed Mains, in dry
  subtlety.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Gene, the kids ain&rsquo;t so pore,&rdquo; said Nels.
  &ldquo;If yore through eatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; let&rsquo;s go.
  When we git down thar on the flat we can figger the rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry, Nels?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t trustin&rsquo; them hop-haids to wait till
  mawnin&rsquo;. Why, I reckon they&rsquo;d jest as lief rob us in broad
  daylight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soon after that the five men, armed to the teeth, passed down the road in
  Starr&rsquo;s car, driving without lights. They had reached the village,
  passed the main street, when approaching Mains&rsquo; house, Sidway&rsquo;s
  keen eyes, accustomed to the dark, espied two mounted riders close to the
  fence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold it, Ren,&rdquo; he whispered.... &ldquo;There!... Down the
  walk past Mains&rsquo; house. Two horsemen!... They&rsquo;re
  moving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My gosh, I see them,&rdquo; replied Starr. &ldquo;Gone now. Listen.
  ... Heah them hoofs? Good fast trot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; interposed Mains, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
  to see hawsemen around heah. They ride up bold as hell an&rsquo; then again
  they sneak up like Injuns. Bonita&rsquo;s the reason.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance bit his tongue to keep from bursting out with the news that he had
  seen Bonita&rsquo;s dark form glide across in front of a yellow-lighted
  window. To his mind neither the riders nor the girl had moved without
  significance of secrecy. Lance resolved to make up to this pretty
  <i>señorita</i> for two reasons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drive on, Ren,&rdquo; said Stewart, presently.</p>

  <p>Below the village some few hundred yards Starr steered off the road down
  the slope. In the dark he had to go very slowly, a procedure difficult to
  accomplish on account of the grade. A vast dim emptiness stretched away under
  the stars. Far down, double pin points of light, moving along, attested to
  the presence of a car on the highway. Lance asked Stewart how long that road
  had encroached upon his range.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Six or seven years, if I remember. Used to bother old-timers. But
  that feeling has gone into the discard with the cattle business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll pick up again and be better than ever,&rdquo; declared
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, stop every little way, so we can listen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a silent night, not yet cooled off from the day&rsquo;s heat. The
  rustle of sage and the low hum of insects accentuated the silence. Stars were
  growing brighter in the darkening blue. Gradually the men ceased talking.
  Once down on the flat Starr had easier driving. Presently he ran out of the
  sage into the wash where on the sand and gravel the going was smoother and
  almost noiseless. Starr must have halted a dozen times at Nels&rsquo; order
  and the five had listened intently before Lance heard cattle bawling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon we&rsquo;ve come fur enough. What say, Gene?&rdquo; queried
  Nels. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pile oot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I know about where we are,&rdquo; said Gene, peering about
  in the gloom. &ldquo;Still pretty far from the road, that is, where this wash
  goes under. But the road curves in to the west.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cattle all aboot,&rdquo; observed Nels. &ldquo;An&rsquo; they
  ain&rsquo;t skeered, thet&rsquo;s shore. Let&rsquo;s mosey on till we heah
  somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Guardedly and slow, with senses alert, the men zigzagged through the sage,
  working southwest. Grazing and resting cattle grew more numerous. After what
  Lance believed was several miles&rsquo; travel Nels halted them near a rocky
  mound.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fur enough, till we heah or see somethin&rsquo;. You cowboys climb
  up thar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The eminence appeared to be rather long and higher toward the west. Lance
  signed to Ren that he would climb the far point. He did not, however, get to
  do it, for a hist from Starr called him back. Lance joined Nels and Stewart
  who stood under Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... Aboot a mile from the highway,&rdquo; Ren was saying, in
  guarded voice. &ldquo;Three big double lights comin&rsquo; from Bolton.
  Trucks. They&rsquo;re close together. Movin&rsquo; slow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know they&rsquo;re trucks?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cars an&rsquo; lamps an&rsquo; such hev been my job fer a year
  an&rsquo; more, Boss. These belong to trucks, an&rsquo; you bet the ones
  we&rsquo;re expectin&rsquo;. Jest creepin&rsquo; along. An&rsquo;
  thet&rsquo;s a level road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How fur away?&rdquo; queried Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cain&rsquo;t say. Mebbe three miles, mebbe six.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, down along here about even with where we are now there are
  several benches that run close to the road and break off in banks. It would
  be a simple matter for trucks to be backed up against these banks and loaded.
  In some places you wouldn&rsquo;t even need a platform. And my cattle are
  tame.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;re some sucker cattlemen,&rdquo; drawled Nels, and
  sat down with his back to the bank. &ldquo;Set down an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s
  wait fer Starr to find oot somethin&rsquo;. Sidway, you got sharp ears. Go
  off a ways an&rsquo; listen. It&rsquo;s a still night. Listen fer cattle thet
  air disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance did as he was bidden, conscious of growing excitement. These
  ranchmen evidently gave him credit for more and wilder experience than he had
  had. He felt that he must rise to the occasion. Presently there would be some
  sharp and critical work for all of them and he nerved himself to cool hard
  purpose. From time to time he heard Starr&rsquo;s low voice.</p>

  <p>It was some time, however, fraught with suspense, before Lance&rsquo;s
  range-trained ear caught the faint trample of hoofs and occasional bawl of
  cattle. Whereupon he ran back to report.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; declared Stewart. &ldquo;How about you,
  Starr?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I heahed but wasn&rsquo;t shore. I am now. Not so
  all-fired far, either.... Boss, jest wait, I&rsquo;m watchin&rsquo; them
  trucks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Starr did not speak again, and the others listened intently. The faint
  sounds of moving cattle augmented. Presently the cowboy whispered sharply:
  &ldquo;Boss, the trucks hev stopped&mdash;jest a little to the right of
  us.... Lights go out!... No, by damn&mdash;the trucks air turnin&rsquo;...
  backin&rsquo; off the road this way, or I&rsquo;m a born fool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, look like it&rsquo;s all set,&rdquo; said Nels, getting up.
  Stewart followed his example.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Them rays of light flash across the highway,&rdquo; went on
  Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pear to be linin&rsquo; up.... Fust lights gone
  out!...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come down, Ren. We&rsquo;ll be moseyin&rsquo; along.... Danny, you
  come with us. Gene, you go with Sidway. Work straight down to the road
  an&rsquo; foller along it. We&rsquo;ll aim to slip up behind the
  <i>hombres</i> who&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; the rustlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In another moment Lance was gliding cautiously along at Stewart&rsquo;s
  heels. They progressed fifty steps or more when Stewart halted to listen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Nels didn&rsquo;t say what to do!&rdquo; whispered Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch we&rsquo;ll break up the raid. But our object is
  to capture at least one each of the riders and drivers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance silenced his misgivings and conjectures, and transferring his rifle
  to his left hand he drew his gun. Stewart, he had observed, packed two guns,
  and Lance thrilled at the way he wore them. So different from the movie bad
  men! They stole along slowly, avoiding the larger sagebrush, careful not to
  scare cattle, listening at intervals. The hum of a motorcar off to the east
  distracted Lance&rsquo;s attention from the now audible moving herd.
  Presently he saw the lights and he and the rancher watched them grow and pass
  not far below, and go on out of sight. That car was making fast time. No
  doubt it did not see the trucks. Soon Lance followed Stewart out of the sage
  upon the highway, black and glistening under the stars.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re farther this way than we thought,&rdquo; whispered
  Stewart. &ldquo;That bunch of cattle are down to the road.... Hear that?...
  We&rsquo;ve got to hand it to these truck rustlers for nerve. Right on the
  highway! Not leary of noise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To hell with the ranchers, eh?&rdquo; replied Lance, with a little
  husky laugh. He felt the heat throb in his pulsing veins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t put a guard out, as the old rustlers used
  to.... Let&rsquo;s hurry along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart strode so swiftly that Lance could not hear anything while they
  were moving. But presently they halted; the trample of hoofs and bawl of
  cattle became plainly audible. On the third halt Lance distinctly heard the
  thump of hoofs upon a board floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; swore Stewart. &ldquo;Loading already!
  Won&rsquo;t that make Nels snort? It should be getting hot over there. But
  Nels would move slow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After another hundred steps or so Stewart led off the highway into the
  sage. Lance divined that the rancher wanted cover to drop behind in case the
  truckmen flashed their lights. Nevertheless it was not long before Stewart
  went down on all fours to crawl. This was tremendously exciting to Lance. The
  thump of solid hoofs on wood drowned all the other sounds except an
  occasional snort or bawl. The cattle were being moved with amazing celerity
  and little noise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beats me,&rdquo; muttered Stewart, then crawled on. They had
  scarcely gotten even with a point opposite, where a high black bulk loomed up
  squarely above the horizon and marked the position of the trucks, when huge
  glaring lights gleamed out of the darkness. Lance flattened himself beside
  Stewart. A low fringe of sage on their right saved them from detection. But
  Lance&rsquo;s throat contracted. A harsh low voice, a sudden bursting of an
  engine, into whirring roar, a grind of wheels left no doubt that a truck was
  starting. It moved quickly down to the road, and turned so that the lights
  swerved to the right, leaving the men in darkness. Then the truck stopped and
  the driver called. Stewart jerked Lance to his feet, whispering:
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to move. Careful now. Keep your head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His voice, his presence stirred Lance as nothing else had ever done.
  Stewart ran along the sage and up on the road to the truck. Lance, sharp-eyed
  and tense, kept at his heels. The engine was purring. Reaching the front of
  the car Stewart jerked open the door and commanded: &ldquo;<i>Hands
  up!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance over Stewart&rsquo;s shoulder saw the big gun go prodding into the
  driver&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Agg-h!&rdquo; he ejaculated, and lifted his hands
  off the wheel.</p>

  <p>A quick grating footstep on the other side of the car caused Lance to
  crouch. A man came swiftly round the front.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beat it, Bill&mdash;we&rsquo;re held up!&rdquo; rasped the
  driver.</p>

  <p>But this man cursed and swept up his arm. Lance having him covered, had
  only to pull the trigger. His shot preceded the others only by an instant.
  Lance saw his action violently break, his gun burst red. A crash of bursting
  glass, a thud of bullets preceded Stewart&rsquo;s staggering away from the
  truck to fall. The driver, with hoarse bellows of alarm, shoved his power on
  so quickly that the cattle in the truck banged against the gate. Then the
  truck roared down the road.</p>

  <p>The horror that gripped Lance at Stewart&rsquo;s fall nearly overcame him
  for a moment. Then strident yells, the flashing of lights and roaring of
  engines added to his fighting fury. Nimbly he leaped beyond the broad flares.
  And as the second truck whizzed down upon the road he emptied his gun at the
  front of the first one. The splintering crash of glass, the lurching of the
  car, the loud yells told that his bullets did some execution. Both trucks
  gained the road. As they roared on shots rang out from the bank. Then Lance,
  resorting to his rifle, aimed above the red rear light of the last truck, and
  sent ten shots after it. Lowering the hot rifle he stood a moment, shaking,
  wet with cold sweat, realizing all shots had ceased. He caught a clatter of
  rapid hoofs, the crowding of cattle, then a ringing voice:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, over there,&rdquo; called Nels. &ldquo;What&rsquo;n hell was
  yore hurry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels! Come&mdash;quick! Stewart&rsquo;s...&rdquo; yelled Lance
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep your shirt on, cowboy,&rdquo; intercepted the cool voice of
  Stewart. Then Lance saw his tall dark form against the lighter gloom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Ste&mdash;wart. I was afraid,&rdquo; gasped Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello. Where are you, fellers?&rdquo; shouted Danny Mains, and then
  followed Starr&rsquo;s cheery voice. &ldquo;Busted, by thunder!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; called Stewart. Presently the three loomed on the
  road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, you let &rsquo;um git away,&rdquo; protested Nels, hopping
  mad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trucks vamoosed in spite of us. How about the riders?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we was creepin&rsquo; up behind, all set, when you opened up
  the ball.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you identify any of them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell, we didn&rsquo;t even see them. Slick an&rsquo; fast ootfit,
  Gene. Makes me more curious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so damn curious as I was,&rdquo; growled Danny Mains,
  enigmatically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard, you shore done a lot of shootin&rsquo;,&rdquo; declared
  Starr, peering into Lance&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what happened,&rdquo; explained Stewart. &ldquo;Sidway
  and I got here just as that loaded truck came off the sage. When it turned on
  the road, we jumped and ran. It stopped. I opened the door and stuck my right
  gun in the driver&rsquo;s ribs. He yelled in spite of that. Then his pardner
  came running. Bill, the driver called him. Bill sure saw me. For he came up
  with a gun. I threw my left on him but it struck the car door, low down.
  Sidway shot this fellow&mdash;broke his aim&mdash;or sure as God made little
  apples he&rsquo;d have killed me. At that he hit me. His bullet knocked me
  flat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene! You shot? Whar? Not a body hit?&rdquo; exclaimed Nels.</p>

  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which the cold began to creep
  into Lance&rsquo;s marrow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know where,&rdquo; returned Stewart, calmly, as he felt
  of his body and shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bleeding. Busted glass cut me.
  That <i>hombre</i> saw my body outside the door and believe me he threw his
  gun on it. But Sidway&rsquo;s shot knocked him off. Maybe the bullet
  didn&rsquo;t hit me at all. Maybe it did, because I&rsquo;m bleeding all over
  my face and head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, then it cain&rsquo;t be serious,&rdquo; declared Nels, with
  relief. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Sidway hit this <i>hombre</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bored him plumb center,&rdquo; replied Stewart, grimly. &ldquo;He
  stood just inside the light. I saw him drop like a sack. He&rsquo;s lying
  here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Starr produced a flashlight and with the two men began searching the
  immediate space, while Lance fought the strangest, most sickening sensation
  of his life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah!... Daid, I&rsquo;ll tell the world!&rdquo; rang out Starr.
  &ldquo;Lousy-lookin&rsquo; little bastard! One of them hop-haids.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Search him, Ren, and drag him off the road.... Sidway, you&rsquo;re
  too damn good a shot. Dead men tell no tales.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if you ask me, our new cowboy is a man after my kind. Gene,
  don&rsquo;t call him fer shootin&rsquo; fast an&rsquo; straight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was kidding. But at that I wish Sidway had only crippled him... .
  What&rsquo;d he have on him, Ren?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Automatic tight in his mitt.... Watch. Knife. Cigarettes....
  An&rsquo; this wad of long green. Fellers, will you look at thet! A hundred
  dollar bill on the ootside!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance gradually dragged himself closer to the trio, and discerned Starr on
  his knees beside the dead man, a slack spare figure, terribly suggestive,
  showing in the flashlight a crooked visage, ghastly in hue and
  contortion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you lousy hop-haid,&rdquo; broke out Starr, in genial levity,
  &ldquo;bumped up agin the wrong hombre, didn&rsquo;t you?... Lay hold, Danny,
  an&rsquo; help me haul him over heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cold grip on Lance&rsquo;s internals slowly lessened; and he helped it
  pass by a desperate effort to conceal what he felt to be his squeamishness
  before these ranchers. He thought he could get by in the dark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway must have stung more than this hombre,&rdquo; Stewart was
  saying to Nels. &ldquo;He shot the front glasses out of both cars. And he
  sure cut loose with his rifle as they drove away. I heard the bullets hit
  that last truck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thanks to him, it didn&rsquo;t turn oot so pore. Mebbe thet
  money will more than pay fer the cattle they rustled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, reckon I&rsquo;ll hev to drive back to Bolton in the
  mawnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; report this execution to the sheriff,&rdquo; said
  Starr, joining them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And I might have to see a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lemme look.&rdquo; Starr flashed his light upon the side of
  Stewart&rsquo;s face which he turned for inspection. Lance saw with concern
  that the rancher was bloody enough to have been struck by a load of shot. The
  cowboy wiped the blood off, and peering closer he ran his fingers over
  Stewart&rsquo;s cheek and temple and neck. &ldquo;Hell! You ain&rsquo;t been
  shot atall, Boss. Jest a blast of glass, I reckon.... Leastways I
  cain&rsquo;t find any bullet hole.... Gosh, I&rsquo;m glad them glass bits
  missed yore eye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Feel here&mdash;back of my ear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah-ha!&mdash;Shore, he creased you thar.... Hot as fire, huh. Thet
  was made by a bullet, Boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile.... Sidway, I owe you
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&mdash;He&mdash;he just missed you. I was too&mdash;too
  slow,&rdquo; replied Lance, thickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been shot at before, boy. I saw him jerk and his gun
  spurt up. He&rsquo;d have bored me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How aboot moseyin&rsquo; along? Thet&rsquo;s a long tramp fer a man
  who never trailed rustlers on foot,&rdquo; said Nels, plaintively.</p>

  <p>As they moved up the highway Starr dropped back to Lance&rsquo;s side. He
  put a hand on the other&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Pard, you didn&rsquo;t tell me
  you was some punkins with a gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, you might josh me, but not these men. You pulled a fast one,
  Sid. An&rsquo; Gene Stewart seen you. Wait till I get a chanct to tell you
  some stories about Stewart an&rsquo; Nels. Hell, man, they&rsquo;ve seen the
  wildest of western days. An&rsquo; Nels was a Texas ranger before he ever hit
  this country. If you know yore West! An&rsquo; Gene Stewart, or <i>El
  Capitan</i> as his handle was them days, was not only a tough cowboy but a
  real gunman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, I hope this night&rsquo;s work will end the truck
  rustling,&rdquo; said Lance, lamely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it might, if them <i>hombres</i> was ordinary cattle thieves.
  But who&rsquo;n hell can figger these hop-haids. Anyway, pard, you&rsquo;ve
  cinched yore job, believe you me. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gonna ride with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be swell. I&rsquo;m glad. We&rsquo;ll get along fine,
  Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! I jest happened to think!&rdquo; ejaculated Starr, stopping
  in the middle of the highway to take a pull at Lance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a
  heap to be in yore boots.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&rsquo;s hurting? Don&rsquo;t you think,
  usually?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you be sittin&rsquo; pretty with Majesty Stewart?... Fust
  stunt&mdash;right off&mdash;savin&rsquo; her dad&rsquo;s life! Pard, she
  adores him. My Gawd, the luck of some gazabos!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord!... Starr, if you&rsquo;re my pard don&rsquo;t
  tell&mdash;her&mdash;please,&rdquo; exclaimed Lance, his weakness making him
  prey to another emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal!&mdash;Why, shore, Sidway. I won&rsquo;t tell her. But how
  about Gene? An&rsquo; thet gabby old Nels&mdash;Pard, if I was you I&rsquo;d
  shore want her to know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve clashed, Ren. She misunderstood my coming here. Thinks
  I&rsquo;m a liar. Laughed at me&mdash;when I denied it.... Vainest girl I
  ever met!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! What of thet,&rdquo; returned Ren, bluntly.
  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s also the loveliest, the sweetest, the finest an&rsquo;
  squarest. Get thet, buddy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I get <i>you</i>&mdash;you dumbbell! I see if I&rsquo;d speak
  my mind about this glorious creature, you&rsquo;d sock me one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forget it, pard. You&rsquo;re a little upset. I ain&rsquo;t
  wonderin&rsquo; at thet. You reckoned Stewart was daid an&rsquo; seein&rsquo;
  him come back to life would excite anybody, outside the fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Starr gave Sidway a friendly pat on the back and then let him alone.
  Presently they reached a culvert over the wash, and turning here, they
  followed the pale line of sand into the sage. The sand dragged at
  Sidway&rsquo;s feet, but the exertion helped restore his equilibrium. The
  distance back to the car seemed interminable and proved how, on the way down,
  the excitement had made it short. They found the car at length and were soon
  bumping over the uneven ground. Starr had no incentive now to drive slowly
  and noiselessly. He certainly gave his passengers a rough trip back to the
  ranch.</p>

  <p>Lance went to bed at once. For half an hour Nels and Mains, dressing
  Stewart&rsquo;s wounds in the adjoining room, kept Lance awake, thinking one
  moment and going over the adventure the next. When quiet settled down, he
  soon fell asleep.</p>

  <p>Upon awakening, Lance heard Starr and Nels talking while they got
  breakfast. Presently Starr pounded on the wall between, jarring the house.
  &ldquo;Hey, Oregon, air you daid?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up,&rdquo; replied Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;re quieter&rsquo;n hell if you air. Waltz out. I
  gotta rustle to town pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, send for my baggage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, pard, an&rsquo; what else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Lance entered Nels&rsquo; bunkhouse to have breakfast he sensed such
  a great transformation in himself that he felt certain his friends would
  exclaim about it. But they did not notice any difference in him. During the
  meal they did not once mention the affair of last night. All in the day, for
  them, thought Lance! He essayed a cool and quiet demeanor which he meant to
  make permanent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, what&rsquo;ll I do today?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone if I know, son,&rdquo; drawled the other, scratching his
  gray head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all goin&rsquo; to town. Go wrangle yore
  hawse an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll ask Gene when he comes down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Umpqua had made the most of the huge grassy pasture. Lance found him in
  the extreme far corner, more than a mile from the corrals, and rode him
  bareback to the corrals. After rubbing him down and saddling and bridling
  him, Lance led him up the lane to the court. Stewart, his head swathed in
  white bandages, stood by Madge&rsquo;s car talking to Starr. As Lance passed
  the open door of the store he heard Madge&rsquo;s rich voice, breaking with a
  singular note, and it gave him a wild impulse to run. Starr hailed him, and
  then he and Stewart approached.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re okay, Boss,&rdquo; said Lance, eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Sidway. Reckon I feel like a nigger who had to have
  the buckshot picked out of him. Would you like to go to town with
  us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not on my own account, sir. Thanks. There&rsquo;s a lot I can find
  to do here.&rdquo; Lance said this at the same moment he heard Nels&rsquo;
  clinking slow step behind him and a lighter pace that stopped his heart. But
  he did not turn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Starr will come back soon,&rdquo; went on the rancher. &ldquo;It
  might be a good idea for you and him to fix up your quarters. Nels said they
  had gone to rack.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How about the cattle?&rdquo; asked Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have been left free to run the range, and as you saw, have
  worked low down. Danny and I will be driving a big herd to the railroad soon.
  Maybe next week. I&rsquo;ll make that deal in town today. As for immediate
  jobs, I want you and Ren to repair the water flume and the telephone line
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ll get started on them today.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, did you make out your list of supplies?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty writ it oot fer me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, what have you been tellin&rsquo; that girl?&rdquo; demanded
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me? Why, Gene, nothin&rsquo; atall,&rdquo; drawled Nels,
  innocently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You old liar! Look at her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance wished to do this with an almost irresistible desire. But he sat
  down on the edge of the porch, dragging Starr with him, aware that the others
  had stepped into the store.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you&rsquo;ll not forget my baggage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, pard. Anythin&rsquo; else? Say how&rsquo;s yore bunkhouse
  fixed up? I didn&rsquo;t look.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fixed up at all,&rdquo; replied Lance. &ldquo;No
  mattress, no chair, no mirror, nothing to wash in or with. No towels.
  I&rsquo;ve been using Nels&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, mine cain&rsquo;t be no wuss...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, buy what you need today,&rdquo; said Madge Stewart, from
  behind them. She had not gone into the store at all. Manifestly she had heard
  their talk. &ldquo;Whatever is this ranch coming to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, you heah, Miss Majesty. Good mawnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
  Starr, with confusion, as he stood up to turn toward her. &ldquo;About the
  ranch&mdash;wal, I&rsquo;d say things was lookin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Arising stiffly, Lance wheeled to doff his sombrero and greet her in
  apparent composure. But the tone of her voice and then the look of her played
  havoc with all his resolves. At this juncture Stewart and Nels came out of
  the store.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, do you think I dare ride in with Madge?&rdquo; quizzed
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;d jump at the chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You old traitor! Why, you never could be hired to ride in a car. Do
  you remember Link Stevens driving that big white car of
  Madeline&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd, do I? But I&rsquo;ll bet Majesty would hev druv rings
  around Link.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge was looking down upon Lance. The fairness of her face appeared
  enhanced by the scarlet upon her lips. In truth Lance saw that she was pale
  and that her eyes were unnaturally large, glowing, dilating, with a violet
  fire. Then she seemed to float down the steps and entwine her arm in
  Lance&rsquo;s, and lift her lovely face to him, that in the action flushed a
  hue to match her lips and then went pearly white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saved Dad&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance had prepared himself for he knew not what, though not for this close
  proximity, the tight pressure of her arm, the quivering feel of her.
  &ldquo;Oh, no, Miss Stewart. Somebody has exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels told me,&rdquo; said Madge, intensely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might have known,&rdquo; went on Lance, trying to be cool and
  nonchalant. &ldquo;Nels is swell, but you know he.... Starr told me what an
  old liar he is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah!&rdquo; yelped Starr. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get me in bad. I
  never said thet...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, please...&rdquo; interposed Lance. &ldquo;You
  mustn&rsquo;t give me undue credit. I was there&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
  glad&mdash;I made myself useful. I didn&rsquo;t want to kill the
  man...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You killed him?</i>&rdquo; she cried, aghast. &ldquo;Oh, Nels
  didn&rsquo;t tell me that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance spread wide his hands to the watching men, as if to say &ldquo;Now
  see what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; But it was not the revelation that
  distracted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re bound to be our good angel!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
  softly, and shook him gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really I&mdash;you... it was&mdash;it&rsquo;s not so
  much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing! And you killed a robber who&rsquo;d have murdered my
  father? I wonder what you&rsquo;d consider <i>very</i> much.... Come away
  from these grinning apes, so I can thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She led him out to her car and still clung to his arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  impossible to thank you,&rdquo; she went on, her voice breaking. &ldquo;I
  can&rsquo;t even try. But I&rsquo;m unutterably grateful. I&rsquo;ll do
  anything for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Stewart....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friends call me Majesty,&rdquo; she interrupted, sweetly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I appreciate your excitement and feeling. It&rsquo;s kind
  of a tough spot for you. I hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t tell you. But they
  did... and I won&rsquo;t let you make too much of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too much! Aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo; she rejoined,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad? That I was there&mdash;with him? Good heavens! Of course, I
  am. Greatest kick I ever had!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels told me you were a bad <i>hombre</i> to meet in a fight. That
  you reminded him of an old pard, Nick Steele. But that you were different
  from the old-time bragging gunmen... modern, modest&mdash;a new kind to him,
  but dangerous, and just what my father needed&mdash;just what <i>I</i>
  needed...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels is a sentimental old jackass,&rdquo; burst out Lance. If she
  would only let go of his arm, move her soft warm shoulder away from his!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It bothers you,&rdquo; she asserted, quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
  skip it.... Come into town with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that an order?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Just a request.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I&rsquo;ve plenty of work to do here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say plenty.... Lance, I hated you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you telling me? But really I&rsquo;m sorry I was so
  rude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgive you. Let&rsquo;s be good friends now. You&rsquo;re here,
  I&rsquo;m here&mdash;and my friends are coming. You&rsquo;ll like the girls.
  They&rsquo;re peaches. Full of fun&mdash;and great sports. It will embarrass
  me if we are at odds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could that be? I&rsquo;m only your father&rsquo;s
  cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that <i>I</i> saw you first,&rdquo; she taunted.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>my</i> cowboy. They&rsquo;ll all make a play for you,
  especially that red-headed Bu Allen. She&rsquo;s a devil on the make.
  They&rsquo;ll hear of your&mdash;about you&mdash;make you a hero. I want you
  to be good friends with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will be, of course. A friend like Ren Starr,&rdquo; qualified
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I mean more than that. Ren is swell. Only he&rsquo;s a hired
  hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So am I. I won&rsquo;t forget my place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being just a little snooty?&rdquo; she inquired,
  subtly changing, and she released his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you kidding me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she flashed, loftily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then isn&rsquo;t that your line?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any line, Mr. Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance felt utterly helpless in two conflicting ways&mdash;that he simply
  could not help rubbing the girl the wrong way, any more than he could resist
  her lovely person and insidious charm. He wanted her to hurry away so that he
  could think. In another moment she would see that his heart if not his will
  was prostrate at her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you had better fire me right here and now,&rdquo;
  he said, glumly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had,&rdquo; she returned, her purple eyes glowing upon
  him, as if visioning afar. &ldquo;But Dad needs you. And he wouldn&rsquo;t
  let you go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go anyhow. Just you fire me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll not do it.... Listen, big boy, you gave me some
  dirty digs. And I&rsquo;ve been catty. It&rsquo;s fifty-fifty. Here&rsquo;s
  my hand for a new deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart&mdash;as Ren says&mdash;you&rsquo;re one grand
  girl,&rdquo; rejoined Lance, unsteadily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unconceivable that
  I could withhold my hand, if you offered yours. But I can&rsquo;t forget so
  easily as you evidently do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. You can&rsquo;t take it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you still believe I found out who you were&mdash;where you
  lived&mdash;and came out here to&mdash;to...&rdquo; he queried, hotly, and
  ended, unable to finish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, certainly I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I swear on my word of honor that I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; went
  on Lance, passionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she retorted, almost with like heat. &ldquo;And
  I&rsquo;d think more of you if you&rsquo;d not lie about it. This word of
  honor stuff!... I thought it was a swell stunt. I was tickled pink.
  I&rsquo;ll still think it grand of you if you&rsquo;ll only stop bluffing.
  What more could you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must seem ridiculous to you. But I&rsquo;m neither a callow
  college youth nor a thickheaded gangster. I&rsquo;d expect a girl to
  <i>believe</i> me. Else I couldn&rsquo;t be her friend. You&rsquo;re just
  kidding me. You&rsquo;d play with me in front of your college crowd&mdash;and
  let me down afterwards. Why, you even have nerve enough to try to get my
  horse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes I have, Lance Sidway,&rdquo; she blazed at him.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nerve enough to get him, too, at any cost&mdash;unless you
  show yellow and ride away!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance bowed and turned away toward the bunkhouses, forgetting the others
  and afraid to go to Umpqua. He heard her call to her father, and presently
  the sound of the cars wheeling away. In that moment of passion he divined if
  he approached Umpqua it would be to ride away from that ranch. And he flung
  himself upon his bunk to shut out the sunlight. Neither pride in himself nor
  loyalty to Stewart accounted for that victory over himself. The paralyzing
  and staggering truth was that he did not ride away because he could not bear
  to leave this beautiful and tormenting girl.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">EARLY and late Sidway was out on the road job, overseeing
  the Mexican laborers, while Starr and Mains, with the <i>vaqueros</i>,
  repaired the telephone, and then drove upwards of six hundred head of cattle
  to the railroad.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the road fit for heavy traffic when it appeared all the
  trucks in Bolton came along loaded to capacity with the crated furniture and
  bales and boxes that Madge Stewart had sent from Los Angeles. There were four
  small trucks and two large ones. The contents, Lance calculated, must have
  cost the girl thousands of dollars; and the sight of them aroused an
  unreasonable resentment in him. What business was it of his? Yet he could not
  help thinking of her all the day and half the night. That fact lay at the
  root of his intense dissatisfaction rather than her extravagance at such a
  hard period for her parents. Lance was determined that Madge must not know
  this. He was always fighting against an acceptance of her faults.</p>

  <p>On Saturday afternoon of that busy week Lance was glad to see Starr drive
  up with Stewart and Mains in his car, and an empty truck behind.</p>

  <p>The road job was finished, very much to Stewart&rsquo;s satisfaction, and
  he paid off the Mexicans, and sent them back to town.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon we&rsquo;re ready for Madge&rsquo;s outfit,&rdquo;
  said Stewart, eyeing his cowboys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is, Boss?&rdquo; queried Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not me, neither,&rdquo; added Starr, making a wry face. &ldquo;All
  summer long! Gene, they&rsquo;ll drive us nuts.... An&rsquo; shore one of
  them swell college sprats will cop my girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bonita, you mean,&rdquo; returned Lance, laconically, as he
  rested against the car. &ldquo;Ren, I haven&rsquo;t noticed&mdash;so
  much&mdash;that she is your property.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sid, you double-crossin&rsquo; son-of-a-gun! I might have knowed
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell kid!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look heah, Sidway, hev you been after my daughter, too?&rdquo;
  demanded Danny Mains.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a good deal of her while you were away. I knew you
  didn&rsquo;t approve of Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Danny,&rdquo; interposed Stewart, &ldquo;cowboys are the same now
  as we were. Only a good deal better. I think Bonita is better off for friends
  like Starr and Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon,&rdquo; agreed Danny, dubiously. &ldquo;On&rsquo;y
  I&rsquo;m afraid they might do some mischief to Bonita&rsquo;s several
  <i>vaquero</i> beaus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mischief! Say, Danny, you ain&rsquo;t got me figgered,&rdquo;
  replied Ren, doggedly. &ldquo;I love Bonita an&rsquo; hev asked her to marry
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren&mdash;So that was it?&rdquo; ejaculated Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that was what?&rdquo; queried Starr, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to embarrass you here, pard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you&rsquo;ll excuse my cantankerousness,&rdquo; said Mains,
  simply. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hev you figgered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Starr, this here Oregon ladies&rsquo; man is not only stepping on
  your preserves, but he&rsquo;s kidding you,&rdquo; rejoined Stewart, with a
  laugh. &ldquo;Hook her up and let&rsquo;s go. Sidway, it&rsquo;s a good job
  well done.... Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve a message for you by phone. Madge wants you
  up at the house to open boxes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss! I&rsquo;m a tired man,&rdquo; expostulated Lance. &ldquo;And
  Umpqua needs to be worked over. Up and down this dusty road for a
  week!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! Haw!&rdquo; laughed Starr, fiendishly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll tell Madge not tonight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Starr grinned knowingly at Lance and drove off. From where they had caught
  up with him it was only a short ride to the ranch. Yet it seemed a long and
  thoughtful one for Lance. It began to look as if Madge Stewart either meant
  to try him with odd stable-boy jobs or else she wanted him to be unable to
  avoid her, as he had tried so hard to do. The former made him furious and the
  latter made him weak.</p>

  <p>By the time he had put Umpqua away it was dark, the store was closed, and
  bright light shone from Nels&rsquo; window and door. A drowsy breeze blew in
  from the range, moved down by the cooler air on high. Frogs were croaking in
  the lake. Lance washed his grimy hands and face before he went in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jest in time, son. Come in an&rsquo; get it,&rdquo; said Nels,
  cheerily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard, what say to a swim in the lake after supper? She&rsquo;s bank
  full already,&rdquo; suggested Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay by me. But, boy! that water is cold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you from Oregon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It turned out to be warmer water than Lance was used to at home, and he
  enjoyed the bath. On the way back he realized that Ren had something on his
  mind. Lance clapped him on the back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your chest, buddy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bonita.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Ren, I was surprised at what you admitted to Danny. I had no
  idea you were serious. I&rsquo;m sorry, old man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You like Bonita?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say. She&rsquo;s some kid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard, did you kiss and hug her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren! Have a heart. Would you expect me to tell?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, in my case, yes. You see, pard, I want you to help me win thet
  kid. I cain&rsquo;t do it alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay. Yes I did&mdash;a little. But it was no cinch. And I liked
  her the better. She&rsquo;s a charming girl, Ren. I honestly think
  she&rsquo;d make a swell little wife. But there are a lot of guys
  who&rsquo;re after her, and not all of them with your good
  intentions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of them Mexican <i>vaqueros</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But town fellows, too. And I&rsquo;m suspicious of them.
  I&rsquo;ve a hunch some of them might know something about that
  rustling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My hunch, too. We&rsquo;ll find out. An&rsquo; pard&mdash;listen!
  If you&rsquo;ll help me with this black-eyed little girl I&rsquo;ll shore
  play yore game with yore proud Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God!&mdash;Ren, have you gone nutty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. I&rsquo;m cool as a cucumber right this heah
  minnit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But man! <i>Me</i> aspire to that...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, hell, yes. Pard, I seen her look at you thet day, an&rsquo; if
  she&rsquo;s not stuck on you&mdash;mebbe unknowin&rsquo; to
  herself&mdash;then I am nutty an&rsquo; what hev you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;Ren&mdash;you are,&rdquo; replied Lance, frantically.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make that Bonita kid think you&rsquo;re a prince. But,
  pard, forget your pipe dream about the other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Faint heart never won fair lady,&rdquo; returned Starr,
  lightly.</p>

  <p>That night Lance had a dream of a cherub-faced cowboy leading him along
  flower-strewn trails to a bower where a goddess with golden hair awaited him
  with white arms extended. At breakfast he was silly enough to tell Ren and
  Nels about that dream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dreams come true, sometimes,&rdquo; declared Ren, stoutly.
  &ldquo;Hey, Nels?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore they do. An&rsquo; this one of Lance&rsquo;s has a pertickler
  bearin&rsquo; heah,&rdquo; observed Nels, without glancing at Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? And how d&rsquo;you figure that?&rdquo; asked Lance,
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>Nels and Ren both laughed and Lance&rsquo;s face crimsoned. Luckily at
  that juncture a message came from Stewart requesting the cowboys to come up
  to the house, not dressed in their Sunday clothes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That means work. And it&rsquo;s Sunday!&rdquo; complained Lance,
  honestly and fearfully divided between bliss and panic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, you know you&rsquo;re piflicated,&rdquo; replied Starr,
  cryptically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;sure, but what is piflicated?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, as I remember from past mournful experiences, it&rsquo;s a
  kinda prolapsus of the gizzard. Heart trouble, pard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon ascending to the ranch house the cowboys, with Nels accompanying
  them, found a busy and excited household. Front porch and part of the patio
  were packed with crates, bales, boxes, trunks, packages. Stewart, in his
  shirt sleeves, apparently in a trance, was helping the beaming Danny Mains
  carry furniture into the house. Mrs. Stewart, flushed and radiant, was
  bustling about with the servants. Bonita was there, red-lipped and pretty,
  her arms full of linens. And Madge, in slacks and a backless waist, cool and
  sweet and smiling, evidently was boss.</p>

  <p>She put Lance and Ren to opening crates. For a couple of hours they worked
  diligently at this job, and after they had unpacked everything, they carried
  boards and boxes and burlap and paper out to be hauled away on the morrow.
  The next job was to move things into the patio rooms. Lance observed that
  these were light, high-ceiled rooms, with colored adobe walls, and shiny
  floors. He had a glimpse of Madge&rsquo;s rooms, and was reminded of some of
  the luxurious motion-picture sets he had seen in Hollywood.</p>

  <p>At noon they had lunch on the patio porch, and it was a merry occasion.
  Lance, looking at Mrs. Stewart, no longer wondered how Madge had come by her
  beauty. She was a western girl, but her mother&rsquo;s eastern breeding and
  distinction had been augmented in her. Lance had to admit that parents and
  daughter made a delightful trio, and also that the girl&rsquo;s singular zest
  and enthusiasm motivated them.</p>

  <p>After luncheon everybody worked harder than ever. Nels was wearing his
  long spurs, that stuck in dangerously as he knelt to hold a pillow in his
  teeth and slide it down into a slip. Nevertheless in housekeeping matters,
  Nels proved serious and efficient. Madge presently gave Starr and Bonita
  tasks to perform together, while Stewart carried and unrolled rugs and his
  wife oversaw his disposition of them, and the moving of furniture. Lance
  propounded the question as to whether he had naturally gravitated to tasks
  with Madge or she had arranged it that way. But the time came when he no
  longer doubted. That fixed his distant exterior, but it added more and more
  to the tumult within.</p>

  <p>The tasks she set him, and completed with him, would never be remembered.
  As the minutes sped by he seemed hardly conscious of anything besides her
  presence&mdash;her intense and zestful activity, her requests and
  suggestions, and her talk in between, the intimacy that she seemed not to
  notice but which he felt so subtly, the play of her lovely features and the
  changing expressions in her violet eyes, her laugh, her smile, her grace, her
  disheveled golden hair falling over her face to be brushed back with a
  beautiful hand.</p>

  <p>And at last, how it came about he could not say, they had finished all
  present tasks, and she was offering him a cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; he said, easily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you smoke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Once in a while.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, you&rsquo;re one swell assistant. I think I&rsquo;ll promote
  you, if...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, major-domo or gigolo&mdash;or just cavalier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all I can do to make good as a cowboy. That
  is&mdash;here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How modest and cool you are! I&rsquo;d like it, if I could be sure
  you were sincere. You don&rsquo;t ring true, darling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had no reply for that. They had come out into the patio, and Lance was
  walking slowly toward the back, with apparent composure and the respectful
  demeanor of a cowboy toward the boss&rsquo;s daughter. She walked with him,
  cigarette in hand. Somewhere near by Starr and Bonita were quarreling, but
  Madge gave no sign she heard them. Lance felt that he must escape at once, or
  he would betray what he knew not. Yet the bitter paradox was that another
  self of him longed to linger there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot. There&rsquo;s a nice room at that end of the patio. I
  want you to have it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, I&mdash;thank you, Miss Stewart. I have my bunkhouse
  lodgings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I peeped in there one day while you were out. Nels showed me.
  Rotten for even a cowboy. And you&rsquo;re a gentleman, Lance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks again. But I&rsquo;m satisfied down there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I expect you to help entertain my guests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo; He was tremendously surprised, and could say no
  more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should you be so surprised? Because you&rsquo;ve been rude to
  me and I&rsquo;ve been selfish?&mdash;That&rsquo;s nothing. We can give, and
  take it, too.... These boys and girls will be tenderfeet. I must have some
  real western he-man around on occasions&mdash;especially where my horses are
  concerned. I&rsquo;d like to trust you with that job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your father wants Ren and me to ride the range, build and dig
  and what not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Dad told me. Ren can attend to that with the <i>vaqueros</i>.
  <i>I</i> want you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you giving me an order?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am inviting you&mdash;<i>asking</i> you to be a friend&mdash;a
  good sport,&rdquo; she retorted, her eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very&mdash;kind. But in that case I must refuse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like me?&rdquo; she demanded, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, that is a personal matter,&rdquo; he replied, looking
  straight ahead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> like me,&rdquo; she asserted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you put it that way, I&rsquo;m afraid I must be rude again. You
  are mistaken,&rdquo; he rejoined, and his voice sounded curiously strange to
  his throbbing ears. But he was telling the truth. He did not like Madge
  Stewart because he loved her. The silence grew almost unbearable. He steeled
  himself against sarcasm, anger, wounded vanity. When they reached the wide
  green-bordered exit from the patio, when she stopped, he simply had to look
  at her. The last thing he expected was to see her eyes brimming with tears.
  She looked by him, out over the slope to the range. Her wide eyes were softly
  blurred, dark with pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, I can take it,&rdquo; she said, presently, and lifted her
  cigarette to her lips. It had gone out. &ldquo;Have you a match?&rdquo; He
  produced one, struck and held it for her, and she blew a cloud of smoke, with
  apparent unintention, into his face. When the blue cloud cleared away he
  could not have believed she could possibly have looked hurt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anyone can start something. But it takes a real sport to
  finish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Did she refer to an affair with him or the acquisition of his horse, or
  was it the passionate pride of a woman in herself? He answered by saying that
  he feared he, at least, had undertaken something he could never finish, and
  bidding her good night he left her. On the way down he took a short cut off
  the back road into a trail, and lingered on a secluded spot, from which he
  could see the flaming range on fire with sunset. The critical hour of his
  life had struck. He loved this girl, and the emotion seemed a coalescing of
  all his former fancies and loves, magnified into an incredible passion too
  great to understand or hate or resist. It did not require to be brooded over
  and analyzed and made certain. Like an avalanche it fell upon him. It was too
  terrible in its fatality, too transporting in its bliss, too great to be
  ashamed of. But it must be his secret. He swore he would die before he would
  let this man hunter and love taster, who like a savage princess exacted
  homage, this frail, spoiled, lovely creature know that he loved her.</p>

  <p>Before dusk settled down thickly, Lance had fought out the battle, losing
  in his surrender to the catastrophe that had overtaken him, but victor over
  his weakness. Nevertheless he realized anew that he should straddle Umpqua
  and ride away before another day dawned. As he was not big enough to do that
  he did not blind himself to the peril that played and led him on.</p>

  <p>No matter how troubled and hopeless he felt when he lay down at night,
  when morning dawned, with all the exquisite freshness and sweetness of this
  country, and the golden light over the range, he seemed to be transformed,
  renewed, to be glad of life and youth, and the nameless hope that beckoned
  him on.</p>

  <p>Returning from his tasks at the corrals he found Madge and Nels puttering
  around her car. She wore a blue hat, blue gown, blue gloves&mdash;everywhere
  she appeared as blue as her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah, son, come an&rsquo; help,&rdquo; called Nels. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know a darn thing aboot these enjines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge&rsquo;s look of annoyance vanished as Lance strode up to the
  car.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The damn thing won&rsquo;t start,&rdquo; she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have a mechanic here. Cars are Starr&rsquo;s
  specialty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone. Will you oblige me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance leisurely lifted the hood of the engine, to see at a glance what was
  wrong, and in a moment adjusted it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How easy for <i>you</i>!&rdquo; she flashed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  terribly grateful.... Won&rsquo;t you ride in to town with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it might go on the blink again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Then&mdash;just for the ride,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

  <p>Lance returned her look with a feeling that he knew he was the only man on
  earth who could have refused her and who must suffer the anguish of despair
  because he had done so.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss Stewart. I&rsquo;ve no time. Your father
  relies on me for certain things. And I&rsquo;m glad to relieve him of many
  labors&mdash;if I can&rsquo;t of worries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble of you, big boy!... Strike a match for me. I have my gloves
  on,&rdquo; she rejoined, and leaned over the door with the cigarette between
  her lips. Lance had to step close, and he executed her request, but to save
  his life he could not have stilled the quiver of his hand as he held the
  match. She could not have seen it, however, for her unfathomable eyes were
  fastened upon his face. Then, with a merry good-by to him and Nels, she drove
  away. Not until she had gone down the slope did Lance realize he had watched
  her. Evidently Nels had done the same.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, son, she&rsquo;s kinda set on disturbin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; he
  drawled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I&rsquo;ll never last here,&rdquo; he replied,
  poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you will. We all like you, cowboy, an thet applies to Majesty
  Stewart, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no!&rdquo; ejaculated Lance, borrowing Starr&rsquo;s
  expressive language.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, I&rsquo;ve knowed thet girl since she was borned,&rdquo;
  declared Nels. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t figger her atall. You made her mad at
  you fust off. I reckon thet was good, if you&rsquo;re as nutty aboot her as
  Starr swears you air.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, did he tell you that? I&rsquo;ll sock him, by
  thunder!&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t there anything or anybody on this ranch but that
  girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, she seems to be the center of things, whirlin&rsquo; them like
  a dust devil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All day long Lance glanced up from this and that task to see if there was
  a car raising the dust down on the valley road. Nevertheless he accomplished
  three days&rsquo; work in one, so strenuously did he apply himself. When he
  went in to supper, Starr sat there, owl-eyed and pretending innocence. His
  entrance evidently disrupted some kind of a eulogy Nels was delivering to
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, I&rsquo;ve got to hand it to you,&rdquo; said the rancher,
  warmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a glutton for work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate work, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Starr sat up in mild reproof. &ldquo;Heah, you queer duck from Oregon, you
  aint no hawg fer eatin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll tell you thet. An&rsquo; if you
  keep on doin&rsquo; ten greasers&rsquo; work on an empty stummick
  you&rsquo;ll be an angel in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Been off my feed lately,&rdquo; Lance admitted, after the laugh
  subsided.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, are you any good at figures?&rdquo; asked Stewart.
  &ldquo;My accounts are in a tangle. I never was any good at them. Nels
  can&rsquo;t add two and two to make four. And Starr never went to
  school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Boss! The hell I didn&rsquo;t. I can read an&rsquo; write
  some.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stewart, your daughter can, I&rsquo;ll bet. It must have cost you a
  lot to educate her. Why not make her your bookkeeper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have Madge see what a poor businessman I am for
  anything.... Can you straighten out my accounts for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be glad to, Boss. I had a course in bookkeeping. I&rsquo;m not so
  hot at it, but ordinary figures are not beyond me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I&rsquo;ll bet our new range hand is hot all around,&rdquo;
  interposed Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, he started well. But any fool can start. It&rsquo;s
  stickin&rsquo; to the finish that counts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cowman&rsquo;s lazy drawl of humor recalled Madge&rsquo;s subtle
  expression of the very same thought.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I come up right away?&rdquo; asked Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll fetch the books down. I had to hide them from Madge.
  She came home full of the Old Nick. She&rsquo;d be curious, and maybe
  offended, if she found out about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Stewart was gone, Ren stared solemnly at Lance. &ldquo;Pard, did you
  get thet? Full of the Old Nick!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> going to begin again?&rdquo; burst out Lance.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re most as bad as Nels. Give me a rest about Madge
  Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rest! You cain&rsquo;t have a rest. Never again so long as you
  live! Thet&rsquo;s what Bonita did to me, only not anyways so bad.... Pard, I
  smelled hard likker on Majesty&rsquo;s breath!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? When did she come home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Couple hours ago. She was sweeter&rsquo;n a basket of roses. But I
  got a scent like a wolf&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of that? She drinks. All these college girls drink. It&rsquo;s
  nothing. No more than cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I read the magazines an&rsquo; go to the movies. But, pard,
  it&rsquo;s different in Majesty&rsquo;s case. It worries me an&rsquo;
  Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And why? You&rsquo;re wasting your time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; interposed Nels, gravely. &ldquo;Gene Stewart was the
  hardest drinkin&rsquo; cowboy on this range. He was a drunkard. For ten years
  he swore off. Thet was on account of Madeline. Then he drank
  again&mdash;oncet in a long while&mdash;an&rsquo; he does now. When he said
  Majesty come home full of the Old Nick, me an&rsquo; Ben hed the same idee.
  Did he mean drink? An&rsquo; is he afeared his girl has inherited his
  weakness for strong likker?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, fellows, the boss didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; expostulated
  Lance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t. He just meant mischief.... My
  God, that&rsquo;d be a tough spot for Stewart! He&rsquo;s one grand
  guy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you said it. Pard, if she asked you to ride in town with her
  how&rsquo;n hell did you keep from it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job and a sense of responsibility. Besides, she
  just wants to make a&mdash;a chump out of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, don&rsquo;t you let her,&rdquo; declared Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I hope to Gawd you can keep from it,&rdquo; added Ren,
  fervently. &ldquo;Say, Sid, there&rsquo;ll be high jinks goin&rsquo; on if
  them girls air the least like Majesty. Comin&rsquo; day after
  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord help us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, it shore looks like you&rsquo;d hev to be the Lord. Fer all of
  us air under her thumb,&rdquo; said Nels, so very earnestly that Lance could
  not laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s telling me, Nels,&rdquo; replied Lance, and went to
  his own room. He stumbled over something soft, then ran into a chair that had
  not been there in the morning. He could not locate his table. Even in the
  pitch blackness the room felt different and smelled differently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in the deuce has come off?&rdquo; he muttered, and taking out
  his matches, he struck one. This colorful clean-smelling room could not be
  his. Yes, it was&mdash;because he heard Nels and Ren talking through the
  partition. Burning his fingers in his astonishment he struck another match to
  light the lamp. But where was his plain, cheap, stinking lamp? Here was a
  shining one of brass with a big white globe. Rugs on the floor, curtains at
  the two windows, a dresser with a fine mirror, pictures on the walls, a new
  three-quarter bright-blanketed bed where his bunk had been, a washstand with
  colored ware upon it, and towels the quality of which no cowboy before had
  ever felt, a comfortable Morris chair beside his table, and... but his roving
  gaze encountered a striking photograph in a silver frame upon his table.
  Majesty Stewart! With a groan he took the picture and fell into the chair, to
  stare down upon the lovely face, the speaking eyes, the bare neck of this
  girl who had bewitched him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn you! damn you!&rdquo; he whispered, softly. It seemed a long
  while before he became aware of whispers and low laughs in Nels&rsquo;
  room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, pard, air you daid?&rdquo; came through the wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! But I wish I were,&rdquo; shouted Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why fer, you big stiff?... You oughta see my bunkhouse. My
  Gawd!&mdash;Pard, what&rsquo;s thet fairy-guy we used to read about when we
  was kids? Aladdin! Thet&rsquo;s the <i>hombre</i>. Wal, he&rsquo;s been here.
  ... Nels told me the servants fetched all this truck down today, an&rsquo;
  Bonita fixed the rooms up. An&rsquo; a swell job she did!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that juncture Stewart stamped into Nels&rsquo; room. Lance hid the
  picture, and hurried out, and into the ranchman&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Here
  you are, Jack-of-all-trades,&rdquo; said Stewart, gayly, and he opened a
  ledger on Nels&rsquo; table. &ldquo;Balanced proper up to this page and date.
  And there&rsquo;s a year and more of figures. Sidway, if you make sense of
  these I&rsquo;ll be obliged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hop to it, Boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was midnight when Lance straightened out those accounts. The last entry
  was of seven hundred and thirty steers sold at thirty-five dollars a
  head&mdash;payment not yet received. Among the bank statements, papers and
  correspondence were a batch relative to Madge Stewart&rsquo;s income and
  expenses. Over a period of time a yearly income of sixty thousand dollars had
  diminished until at the present it had shrunk to a few thousands. The
  correspondence indicated that from time to time bonds and stocks had been
  transferred from Madeline Stewart&rsquo;s account to that of her
  daughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! I wonder if Stewart really meant me to see these,&rdquo;
  pondered Lance. &ldquo;All as plain as print! Mother and father sacrificing
  themselves to the extravagance of spoiled daughter! And she doesn&rsquo;t
  know it!&mdash;Can you beat that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance&rsquo;s troubled mind yielded to the exhaustion of a hard day and
  toilsome hours with figures, and he slept. Ren&rsquo;s pounding on his door
  awakened him. After breakfast Stewart appeared and Lance brought him the
  ledger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All done, sir, and not so bad except for&mdash;for these,&rdquo;
  said Lance. &ldquo;Accounts, you know, of your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Sidway!</i> Did I leave them in this book?&rdquo; ejaculated
  Stewart, utterly discomfited.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evidently you did. Of course, I went over them. I&rsquo;m sorry,
  sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she ever found this out...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stewart, she won&rsquo;t from me,&rdquo; interrupted Lance,
  hurriedly, hoping to relieve the rancher of embarrassment.
  &ldquo;And&mdash;as for your own accounts, sir&mdash;they&rsquo;re not so bad
  as you led me to believe. When you receive the money for that batch of cattle
  sold the other day, you can pay your debts and have around five thousand
  dollars left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&mdash;Sidway, you&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re.... it&rsquo;d be
  too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe you did not figure out just what you&rsquo;d receive for the
  cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t at that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it comes to twenty-five thousand, five hundred and fifty
  dollars. Quite a lump sum, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must have made a big mistake on the wrong side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You evidently did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking most of Madeline,&rdquo; replied Stewart, his dark
  eyes softening. &ldquo;Sidway, I reckon Starr is right about you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That knock-kneed windbag! Now what&rsquo;d he say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it all. One thing stuck, though. He called
  you a whiz.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance felt that he had never received a compliment that had pleased him
  more. He went to work that day and drove Starr to distraction and dragged him
  home a cripple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at me, Nels,&rdquo; whined Ren, wet with sweat, grimy and
  ragged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Sid, who&rsquo;s this heah nigger you fetched in?&rdquo;
  drawled Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Nels. Me!&mdash;Worked to death by thet fiend.
  An&rsquo; what I hate most in all this world is diggin&rsquo;
  postholes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We finished that corral, didn&rsquo;t we? Now we can have some
  peace when Manuel and Jose wrangle Miss Stewart&rsquo;s horses.... Oh
  boy&mdash;tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me for the hills!&rdquo; ejaculated Ren.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Lance was waiting for Starr the following night at sunset. Inside Nels was
  banging pans in unusual excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard, what&rsquo;n hell&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; demanded
  Ren, staring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behold a&mdash;a&mdash;devastated man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, whatever&rsquo;n hell thet means you shore air it.... So you
  obeyed them orders?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. They were Stewart&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you had to ride in town with Majesty&mdash;all
  alone&mdash;and meet her friends&mdash;all them peaches we jest know air
  comin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; be a swell lady&rsquo;s guy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd, how tough! Jest the rottenest break ever. Wait till I bed
  down my hawse an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be ready to be deevasstated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After supper Ren got up to help Nels with the dishes and he said:
  &ldquo;Okay now, pard. Shoot! I reckon I&rsquo;m strong enough
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell us aboot Majesty&rsquo;s outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the boys are all nice clean-cut college chaps. You&rsquo;ll
  like them, especially the big football player, Snake Elwell. He&rsquo;s a
  regular fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, nix on the fellers. It&rsquo;s the gurls Nels an&rsquo; me want
  to heah about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Six of them, Ren. <i>Six!</i> And they might have been picked for a
  swell movie.... The gang arrived at ten-thirty. They stayed in town until
  three. Five awful hours! If I performed one job, there were a hundred. They
  probably were kidding me or Madge, for the whole bunch of crazy women went
  after me. Poor little me! While the boys hung around Madge. They ate and they
  drank. Can that crowd lap up the booze? I&rsquo;m telling you. And they had
  to see everything and everybody in Bolton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell. But thet ain&rsquo;t tellin&rsquo; us how they stacked
  up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wait till you lamp them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. Me an&rsquo; Nels hev artistic feelin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, here goes&mdash;the way I got it. Allie Leland first,
  evidently Madge&rsquo;s best friend, a slim stylish girl with gray eyes, the
  peach of the bunch, I&rsquo;d say, though not in looks. Next Maramee Joyce,
  brown beauty built like Jean Harlow, a knockout. Next a little southern girl,
  looks like sixteen but must be twenty-two. Dark, vivacious, with a smile that
  would drive any man nutty, and a sweet southern accent. Nels will fall for
  her. Then Pequita Nelson. Part Spanish, Ren. Creamy olive skin, great dreamy
  sloe-black eyes, willowy and graceful. Blue-blood, pard.... Then Selma
  Thorne, a blonde that, if you never saw Madge, would do the trick. And last
  Beulah Allen.... Whew! Ren, here&rsquo;s a peach that&rsquo;s a composite of
  honey, dynamite and autumn leaves of red and gold. Pretty! Why, she&rsquo;s
  so pretty I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off her. Red-headed, roguish-eyed,
  and a shape! What&rsquo;s more she&rsquo;s a devil clear down to her
  toes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard!&rdquo; gasped Ren, utterly fascinated. &ldquo;What&rsquo;n
  hell air we up agin? It was bad enough with only Majesty heah. We shore air a
  deevasstated outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you should have heard the whoop those college tenderfeet let
  out when they saw Bonita.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, I&rsquo;ll be liable to shoot a laig off one of
  them,&rdquo; growled Ren.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Work on the ranch for Lance and Ren, except an occasional and brief
  overseeing of laborers brought out from town, practically ceased. Their jobs
  took on manifold aspects. They had to drive and to ride, especially the
  latter. The only girl guest who knew anything about horses was Dixie Conn.
  Madge&rsquo;s horses were all too spirited for tenderfeet. Lance and Ren
  disagreed as to Madge&rsquo;s own ability to handle several of her
  mounts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Ren, you&rsquo;re all wet,&rdquo; protested Lance. &ldquo;She
  was a swell horsewoman once. Nels vouched for that. But she has been to
  college for four years. She&rsquo;s forgotten a lot. Besides she&rsquo;s out
  of condition. She&rsquo;s soft, if you get what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cain&rsquo;t you lay off yore grouch?&rdquo; complained Ren.
  &ldquo;Majesty is okay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So far as looks are concerned, yes. She looks grand. And
  that&rsquo;s all you see. Ren, you ought to be back at that
  garage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The expression of Starr&rsquo;s face became so peculiar, and a giggle of
  Bu Allen sounded so gleeful that Lance turned toward the wide stable door.
  Madge had entered and she had heard him. Likewise had Rollie Stevens and Nate
  Salisbury, who were with her. The others appeared coming down the lane.</p>

  <p>The purple fire in Madge&rsquo;s eyes was no new catastrophe for Lance. As
  a matter of fact, he had never seen it blaze for anyone or anything except
  him. Nevertheless this time, as always, it stimulated him to battle. Perhaps
  he labored under the delusion that he was right, but so long as he believed
  so he would not give in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, saddle Dervish for me,&rdquo; ordered Madge, quietly.</p>

  <p>Lance stepped forward and laid an ungentle hand on the cowboy. &ldquo;Miss
  Stewart, please forgive my interference. But you should not ride
  Dervish&mdash;just yet. You&mdash;he...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard you express your opinions to Ren,&rdquo; she interrupted,
  in a tone that made Lance feel as if he were the scum of the earth.
  &ldquo;You can save your breath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I won&rsquo;t do so long as I am a cowboy on this
  ranch,&rdquo; replied Lance, coolly, as he found himself. &ldquo;I have a
  duty here&mdash;to your father&mdash;and through him to you.... Dervish is a
  bad actor. He has not been worked out. Besides he does not like you, Miss
  Stewart. It&rsquo;s dangerous for you to mount him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, listen to Sidway,&rdquo; interposed Rollie, his fine face
  earnest. &ldquo;That horse looks skittish to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dixie Conn backed up Stevens, and the other girls apparently fell in line.
  This, Lance knew, was only adding fuel to the fire. He believed that if they
  only had advised it, Madge would have been amenable. But Lance Sidway was
  waving a red flag in her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, do as you&rsquo;re ordered,&rdquo; said Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Majesty, mebbe Lance is right about this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; Lance said, earnestly. &ldquo;Nels
  agreed with me. He saw you on Bellefontaine the other day, and Bell
  isn&rsquo;t half the horse this Dervish is. May I repeat what Nels said to
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if it pleases you so much,&rdquo; rejoined Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He told me to keep you off the wicked horses if I could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels! The old traitor! He taught me to ride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He said also that when you were sixteen there wasn&rsquo;t your
  beat in this state.... Coming from Nels, Miss Stewart, that is the very
  highest compliment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> think sixteen is so far back in my past that
  I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to ride?&rdquo; queried Madge, with sarcasm.
  &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I think, though, you act like sixteen or
  under.... Will you force me to go to your father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead. It&rsquo;ll be a relief to be rid of you. By the time you
  find Dad I&rsquo;ll be far out on the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, he will hold me responsible if you are
  thrown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it? Thinking of your job! It&rsquo;s not too sure,
  at that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance gave up, and went back to saddling Pinto. Starr, at Madge&rsquo;s
  order, led the slender racy Dervish out of his stall. Lance heard the cowboy
  curse under his breath. He also heard Allie Leland, and some of the other
  girls, taking his part against Madge. And Lance&rsquo;s ears burned with
  something besides resentment. All these guests of Madge&rsquo;s had been fine
  to him, and Bu Allen more than friendly. Lance put Pequita Nelson up on
  Pinto, and hurried on to saddle Leatherstocking. The young men were having
  the fun of saddling their own horses. Lance liked this bunch of college boys
  better than he had anticipated.</p>

  <p>At last all the girls were up except Madge and she was leading Dervish out
  into the open. Ren was with her. Lance hurried to get astride Umpqua. The
  others, except Allie Leland, rode out toward the range.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, go with the others,&rdquo; called Madge.</p>

  <p>He waited to see her put a foot into Starr&rsquo;s hand and go sailing
  upon Dervish. She was not in the least afraid of him. There was a red flush
  in her cheeks, a smoldering fire in her eyes. Lance had to admire her for
  more than the superb and lovely figure she made on the roan. Then Madge and
  the Leland girl passed him to join the others. Dervish acted all right, Lance
  thought, but Madge was holding him in. But could she hold him if he broke
  into a run or could she stay on if he wanted to pitch? Lance gambled that she
  would fail in the latter event, anyway. Starr joined him and they loped to
  catch up with the others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you four flusher, why didn&rsquo;t you stand by me?&rdquo;
  queried Lance, with irritation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By thunder, I should of,&rdquo; he replied, contritely. &ldquo;But
  Majesty always kids me along&mdash;makes me reckon I&rsquo;m a helluva
  feller.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Well, if you&rsquo;d come strong, we might have avoided a
  risk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll ride thet nag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh, I hope so. She handles him great. But Ren, damnit!
  That&rsquo;s a horse&mdash;a mean horse! And she can&rsquo;t weigh more than
  a hundred and ten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen, pard, and she&rsquo;s strong. I&rsquo;ll admit, though, I
  forgot she hadn&rsquo;t been ridin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go. I&rsquo;ll try to make Madge think I
  don&rsquo;t care a damn if she breaks her neck.... Fact is, I&mdash;I
  don&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me too, pard. Ain&rsquo;t they a swell lookin&rsquo; outfit? I wish
  Bonita was heah. Majesty said I could ask her. But I knowed I couldn&rsquo;t
  see anyone else, then... hey!...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance rode away from the loquacious cowboy and steadied down
  conscientiously to his job. Once out in the grass and the sage there was much
  less danger of accidents. The girls had listened to reason, if their hostess
  had not. And except Dixie Conn, they were all too scared of horses to try any
  stunts. Dixie and Madge forged ahead, and Lance kept a position that would
  enable him to overtake Dervish, if he bolted. But nothing happened across the
  sage flat to the pine knoll five miles away. Madge led them up to the top of
  that, then down, and over the rolling range land toward the foothills. Half
  an hour of lope and trot brought them to the slope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty,&rdquo; screamed Maramee Joyce. &ldquo;For Pete&rsquo;s
  sake&mdash;hold on! I&rsquo;m dying!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that&mdash;awful stitch in my&mdash;side,&rdquo;
  cried Selma Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest,&rdquo; replied Madge, merrily. &ldquo;But how in
  the world will you girls ever make it up into the mountains?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re&mdash;not going soon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! this is swell, Majesty!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, let&rsquo;s leave these tenderfeet behind on that
  trip,&rdquo; suggested Snake Ewell, good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What? You big hunk of protoplasm!&rdquo; exclaimed Bu Allen, her
  pretty face scarlet, her roguish eyes snapping, her red hair disheveled.
  &ldquo;Why, astride that horse you look as much like Sidway as I do like a
  rodeo queen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At length when they were rested Madge gave the word: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
  go! And step on it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As they swept off with merry screams and shouts Lance, with an eye ever on
  Dervish, saw that he meant business. He balked. And when Madge laid on the
  spurs he began to pitch. Lance in a few jumps had Umpqua beside her, but as
  he reached for the roan&rsquo;s head Madge cried: &ldquo;Let him
  alone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll pile you up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will not!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As bucking horses went, Dervish would have been mean for any rider. But to
  Lance&rsquo;s surprise Madge stayed in the saddle. Bent double, red-eyed and
  infuriated, the roan bucked all over the flat, and failed to dislodge the
  girl. She had her spurs dug into him and sat her saddle as if a part of
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re riding him, cowgirl!&rdquo; yelled Lance, carried away
  with her spirit and the spectacle she made.</p>

  <p>Then Dervish, succeeding in getting the bit between his teeth, bolted away
  across the valley, in the opposite direction from the ranch. It took only a
  glance to see that the roan was a runaway horse and that he would eventually
  get the best of his rider. Lance spurred Umpqua after him. By now the others
  were a couple of miles distant toward the ranch, and they were not yet aware
  of Madge&rsquo;s predicament. The roan was fast. Lance had to urge Umpqua
  into his top speed to gain at all. And he saw that it was going to be a race.
  Madge fought her mount with all her might. If she heard Lance yell to let the
  horse run she gave no sign. The girl had evidently been jolted by the
  bucking, and now she was spending the last of her strength. She would be
  thrown.</p>

  <p>Then after a grueling run Lance drew close to the roan. Madge showed signs
  of distress. She was beginning to sway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drop your bridle!&rdquo; yelled Lance. &ldquo;Grab the pommel! Hold
  on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She heard him and obeyed. That saved her from an immediate spill. Umpqua
  thundered closer and closer until his nose passed the roan&rsquo;s flank. But
  again Madge was swaying. She was near a fall and the ground was rocky, and
  rough with hummocks. Desperately goading his horse, Lance gained inch by
  inch, until he stretched out a clutching hand. She had the sense to shake her
  feet loose from the stirrups. But that loss of stability broke her seat in
  the saddle. She was in the air when Lance caught her in a grip of steel and
  swung her up before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she screamed, wildly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tearing my
  flesh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance let her go, to slip her into the crook of his arm, and hold her
  across his saddle. Umpqua was excited, too, and hard to slow down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whoa! Steady, old boy!&rdquo; called Lance, over and over again.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got her.... There, Ump!&mdash;Easy
  now&mdash;easy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At length Lance halted the horse and then turned his attention to the
  girl. Her face lay high up on his left arm, near his shoulder, and it was
  white. The lipstick on her strained lips made a startling contrast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;sorry I had to hurt&mdash;you,&rdquo; he
  said, haltingly. &ldquo;But I&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t help it. That
  damned&mdash;roan can run. Lucky to catch you&mdash;at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How strong you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes, darkly dilated,
  upon him. &ldquo;You had the muscles of my back. I&rsquo;ll bet I can&rsquo;t
  wear my new formals very soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I get down? Can you ride my horse?&rdquo; asked Lance,
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feel very comfortable where I am.... Lance, I deserve it. I was
  wrong&mdash;bullheaded&mdash;vain. You were right.... Now does that soothe
  your wounded vanity?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My feelings don&rsquo;t count. But I don&rsquo;t remember that
  vanity entered into it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn you anyway, cowboy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, broodingly,
  passionate eyes upon him in speculation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very kind,&rdquo; returned Lance, beginning to
  weaken under another kind of strain. She was resting in his arms, her head
  now on his shoulder. A little color began to creep into her cheeks. Lance
  almost collapsed under a terrific longing to kiss her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For <i>you</i> to be the one always to catch me in the
  wrong&mdash;do me a service!... It&rsquo;s a tough break.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, I had a hunch about this horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike stop calling me Miss. Why don&rsquo;t you cuss
  me out?&rdquo; she replied, hotly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To tell the truth I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; answered
  Lance, lamely. He sensed that fatality for him consisted in being with her,
  and this close contact was insupportable. If he did not get away from it
  instantly he could not answer for himself. She was in his arms and if she did
  not like it, she was acting a part. Then Lance saw Starr approaching in a
  long sweeping gallop, and the others a mile or more behind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; said Lance, in relief, as he carefully
  slid with her out of the saddle. &ldquo;Can you stand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&mdash;if you hold me.&rdquo; And she swayed against him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss... Madge, you&rsquo;re not hurt so&mdash;bad,&rdquo; he
  protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you say. My back is broken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Lance, in alarm, and he turned her round to
  feel of her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just bruised&mdash;sore. I must have pinched
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She squealed as he felt to see if he had broken a rib.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a swell western girl&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think.
  Can&rsquo;t you take it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think, Lance Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God only knows!&rdquo; he responded, with an inward groan.
  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Ren. And the others are coming. Sit down. I&rsquo;ll ride
  after Dervish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He found upon releasing her that she could stand easily enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;n hell come off?&rdquo; shouted Starr, as he leaped from
  his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only me,&rdquo; laughed Madge.</p>

  <p>Lance thankfully galloped off to catch Dervish, now contentedly grazing
  half a mile away. What a girl! He was slipping&mdash;slipping. Then his
  softer agitation burned away in a tumult, some of which emotion was wrath. He
  had not had half a chance. To save her life, or at least, a nasty spill, was
  just his hard luck. All in a second to find her in his arms! Hell! What was a
  girl like that for? Her lying lovely eyes would make an imbecile out of a
  cigar-store Indian. Yet there seemed to be something so sweet, so square
  about her. If only she had not hated him, maybe he never would have known of
  her other nature! But that would have been worse. At length he caught
  Dervish, and by the time he had returned to the waiting group he was
  outwardly his cool self again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you beat him?&rdquo; asked Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I never beat horses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ren glowered at the sweating roan, as he stood meekly, his racy head
  drooping. &ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll beat him some day, believe me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;why is he so kind to dumb brutes,&rdquo; said Madge,
  cryptically. &ldquo;Listen, friends. Sidway saved my neck. After I refused to
  listen to him&mdash;insulted him! I am a cat. Now you shall see me
  apologize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned to Lance in one of her bewildering flashes. &ldquo;Lance, I am
  sorry. I beg your pardon. You were swell to keep your temper&mdash;and stay a
  gentleman. I&rsquo;ll tell Dad. And I&rsquo;ll not get on Dervish very soon
  again&mdash;if ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just fine,&rdquo; replied Lance, heartily. &ldquo;Now
  you ride Umpqua home. He&rsquo;s gentle and easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride Dervish. He&rsquo;s worked off his edge now.&rdquo;
  He helped her mount and shortened the stirrups while the others expressed
  their relief in various ways. The girls, especially, had been frightened. The
  boys, except Rollie Stevens, quickly recovered their spirits. Then just as
  the cavalcade got into motion, Bu Allen said slyly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, if I ride Dervish some time will you be a hero for
  me?&rdquo;</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT night after supper, when Starr, in the next room, was
  exaggerating the story of Madge&rsquo;s adventure on Dervish, and Lance sat
  in his big chair gazing at the beautiful photograph, there came a soft step
  outside and a tap on his door. Hastily hiding the picture of Madge, and with
  a leap of his heart he called: &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The door opened to disclose Beulah Allen on the threshold. She wore a
  henna gown that matched her hair, cut to expose her creamy arms and neck. Her
  charm appeared considerably magnified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Lance. Here I am,&rdquo; she said, archly.</p>

  <p>Lance awkwardly returned her greeting, then: &ldquo;So I see. Who&rsquo;s
  with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone. I had a scrap with Snake, so I thought I&rsquo;d
  hunt you up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell.&mdash;Only, what&rsquo;ll Snake do to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any strings on me. We&rsquo;ve been engaged several
  times and broken it off as often. Tonight is the last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance had arisen, and now he stood looking at her, fully aware of her
  seductiveness, and half inclined to yield to it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How swell you are here! Madge got a kick out of dolling up these
  rooms. Isn&rsquo;t she a peach? Always playing Santa Claus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, she&rsquo;s very kind. Which reminds me&mdash;in the
  excitement today I forgot to thank her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She hates to be thanked.... Aren&rsquo;t you going to ask me
  in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But I&rsquo;ll come out,&rdquo; replied Lance, and taking his
  sombrero he joined her and led her off the porch. She took his arm and
  remarked that the night and the full moon were made for love.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&mdash;But how about a guy, who if he fell, would be down for
  good?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you. Beulah, you&rsquo;re one attractive kid. I
  like you. I&rsquo;ll be glad to help you with your riding&mdash;as you asked
  me. But don&rsquo;t get me in bad with Snake Elwell. He might beat hell out
  of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Snake can run with a football. But
  he gets hurt easily. Always crippled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You little devil!&rdquo; laughed Lance. &ldquo;Honest now,
  isn&rsquo;t Snake in love with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, reluctantly. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not
  alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beulah, I&rsquo;ve met a lot of young fellows. Elwell is not
  flashy. He&rsquo;s a rough diamond. He&rsquo;s a regular guy. If you liked
  him well enough to be engaged to him you oughtn&rsquo;t to play fast and
  loose with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you call this? Coming to my quarters after me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, if you must be serious, I came because I felt a little out
  of it tonight. There&rsquo;s an odd girl, you know. Snake belongs to the same
  fraternity as the other boys. But I don&rsquo;t belong to Majesty&rsquo;s
  sorority.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.... But she wouldn&rsquo;t slight you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s a thoroughbred&mdash;a real sport. And I&rsquo;d be
  crazy about her if she&rsquo;d let me. She&rsquo;s just a little aloof with
  me. And I&rsquo;m as proud as the dickens. So when Snake made me mad, I beat
  it to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure flattered. Let&rsquo;s walk down to the village
  cantina, and have a Mexican cone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was dark except for starlight. Lance thought that the ground was hardly
  uneven enough for Beulah to hang onto him so tightly. But after a while he
  put his arm around her. When they reached the cantina, with its open
  vine-covered porch and dim lights, he did not remove his arm in time to
  escape Bonita&rsquo;s black eyes. She was there with a group of young people,
  and her escort was a Mexican lad Lance had never seen. He was of the
  <i>vaquero</i> type, a born rider, lithe of form, lean of face, and he had
  small glittering dark eyes. As Lance passed the table where they were sitting
  his keen faculties grasped Bonita&rsquo;s jealousy and her friend&rsquo;s
  uneasy lowering of his face. It strengthened his suspicion that some of these
  admirers of Bonita could have shed some light upon the rustlers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Bonita. Ren is looking for you,&rdquo; hazarded Lance, with
  a meaning glance. When her dusky eyes dilated widely he knew he had hit some
  kind of a mark. Before he and Beulah had finished their ice cream, Bonita
  left with her escort. The incident determined Lance to pay more attention to
  Danny Main&rsquo;s pretty daughter.</p>

  <p>It developed that Beulah had an intense interest in motion pictures, about
  which Lance talked at length, and in fact all the way up the hill to the
  ranch house. She led him in through the corridor to the brightly lighted
  living room, where Madge and part of her guests sat at two card tables, and
  the others grouped around Stewart and his wife. Most of them were dressed in
  white. Lance had to bear the sight of Madge supremely lovely in filmy
  blue.</p>

  <p>Their entrance put a stop to games and conversation. Beulah, flushed and
  radiant, made the most of the situation. It invoked various greetings, all
  full of fun and interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beulah, you look stunning,&rdquo; observed Madge.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your recipe for such glamour? My cowboy!... Where&rsquo;d
  you pick him up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lance came up after me,&rdquo; returned Beulah, sweetly.
  &ldquo;He took me to the village&mdash;for a cone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For a which?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean ice-cream cone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It was swell. I&rsquo;d have liked one of those Mexican drinks
  we had in town, but I guess Lance doesn&rsquo;t buy drinks for girls.... We
  saw that pretty Bonita. Say, she&rsquo;s got rr!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Barg,&rdquo; spoke up Nate Salisbury. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
  drive down and grab a cone.&rdquo; And the two young men went tearing
  out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Sidway, do you play bridge?&rdquo; asked Madge, politely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tried it once. Didn&rsquo;t get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you play any game&mdash;that is, <i>card</i> game?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. Ren plays poker. We&rsquo;ll have you up some
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot. I&rsquo;ll hate to take your money. But I&rsquo;ll
  come.... I&rsquo;m glad to see you okay, after your run on
  Dervish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I may look okay in front.... See, you ironfisted cowboy!&rdquo; And
  Madge arose to turn her back. The V-shaped opening in her gown extended clear
  to her waistline. About half way down, disfiguring her lovely back, showed
  black and blue marks of a ruthless hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; burst out Lance, his surprise and regret
  checking other feelings. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible.... But, Miss Stewart,
  how could I help it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge&rsquo;s slow smile might have promised much. However, at this point,
  Stewart called the cowboy: &ldquo;Sidway, I&rsquo;ve had several versions of
  this runaway. Madge wouldn&rsquo;t say anything. From the looks of her back,
  though, I&rsquo;d say you laid hold of her hard. Nels whitewashed the
  accident. Starr didn&rsquo;t see it, nor did the others. Come now,
  what&rsquo;s your story?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Sidway, take this chair here,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Stewart,
  beckoning Lance to a seat beside her. He felt the penetrating kindness of her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you.... Well, really, there wasn&rsquo;t much danger. For a
  western girl!&rdquo; replied Lance, deprecatingly, with a casual gesture.
  &ldquo;Dervish began to pitch. Mad&mdash;Miss Stewart stayed in the saddle.
  Then he nailed the bit and lit out. Ren had gone with the outfit. I chased
  Dervish across the flat. He can run, that roan. I caught up with
  him&mdash;and grabbed her&mdash;a little roughly, I&rsquo;m sorry to
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you forget my instructions?&rdquo; queried Stewart, his kind
  eyes twinkling. &ldquo;I forbade Madge to ride Dervish. And I told you not to
  let her get on any bad horse. You&rsquo;re a judge of horses, aren&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so good. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I forgot, sir,&rdquo;
  returned Lance, not meeting Stewart&rsquo;s eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, your cowboy is a liar,&rdquo; spoke up Madge, in her rich
  voice, that now had a little ring. &ldquo;In fact he&rsquo;s an awful
  liar.... He advised me not to ride Dervish. He insisted that I must not. He
  made me furious by threatening to hunt you up. But you know your little
  Madge, Dad.... Dervish worked out fine as long as I held him in. We rested a
  while. When I mounted again he began to pitch. He made me see red, and hurt
  me&mdash;took it all out of me. Finding he couldn&rsquo;t unseat me, the
  devil beat it up the valley. I stayed on somehow. After a while I heard
  Umpqua pounding at my heels. And Sidway yelled: &lsquo;Let him run! Hold
  on!&rsquo; But for that I&rsquo;d have gone off. The rocky ground scared me
  stiff. My arms went dead. I lost my stirrups. Just then, as I pitched out of
  the saddle, Sidway caught me. He certainly put his brand on me.... But, Dad,
  he saved me broken bones, perhaps a crushed face&mdash;maybe my
  life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance groaned in spirit to be thus made out a hero, yet her eloquence
  radiated through him, and added another link to the chain that was fettering
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, modesty is a becoming trait, but hardly justifies your
  lying to your boss to save his willful and wayward daughter,&rdquo; said
  Stewart, mildly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, don&rsquo;t rub it in,&rdquo; called Madge, mirthfully. Then,
  taking up her cards, &ldquo;Where was I, Allie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The card players settled down to their game again. Mrs. Stewart began to
  ask Lance about Oregon, and she was so gracious and interested that he found
  himself telling her of his boyhood home, of his mother and sister, about that
  sister&rsquo;s malady, and how he had left college to take Umpqua to
  Hollywood, how wonderfully the great horse had made good, how he loved him
  and would not part with him for the world, and finally how he had set out for
  Arizona and New Mexico.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty Stewart! You trumped my ace!&rdquo; exclaimed Rollie
  Stevens, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s transported!&rdquo; declared Allie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listening to Mr. Sidway,&rdquo; chimed in Maramee, with a giggle.
  &ldquo;Majesty, you&rsquo;re not very flattering to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Caught with the goods!&rdquo; cried Madge, leaping up with a blush,
  and slamming down her cards. &ldquo;I hate bridge anyway.... Turn on the
  radio, you all. Or play the Victrola. Dance! What&rsquo;d you come here for?
  ... Mom, please surrender Mr. Sidway to me for a little. I want him to talk
  to <i>me</i>!&rdquo; And approaching Lance she tugged at his sleeve. He
  arose, bowed to Mrs. Stewart, and allowed himself to be led toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, take a coat or wrap, if you&rsquo;re going into the
  patio,&rdquo; advised her mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one in the hammock, Mom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rollie Stevens called forcefully after them. &ldquo;Majesty, I&rsquo;ll
  cut in&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will, the sap!&rdquo; whispered Madge. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
  fool him.&rdquo; The patio was silver-bright under a full moon. The fountain
  tinkled, there was a stir of leaves, and peep of sleepy birds. Madge caught
  up a white coat from the first hammock and gave it to Lance. He helped her
  into it, and turned up the wide collar, and buttoned the upper buttons, his
  fingers clumsy, while she stood still and gazed up at him with eyes he felt
  but dared not meet. Then she took his arm and led him along the wide porch,
  where the shadows of foliage played black on the tiles. Lance was helpless in
  the thrall of the moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, it&rsquo;s coming to you right now&mdash;while I&rsquo;m hot
  under the spell,&rdquo; declared Madge. &ldquo;Beulah Allen has fallen for
  you. They all saw that. I saw it long ago. What did you do to her? She sailed
  in positively regal. That was for my benefit, Lance Sidway. Only yesterday I
  told the girls you didn&rsquo;t neck. What a liar you&rsquo;ve made me
  out!... They all like you. Dad doesn&rsquo;t throw a fit over every fellow
  who comes along, not even a cowboy. And Mom!... Young man, do you know you
  couldn&rsquo;t pull a greater stroke here than that? I listened. It
  couldn&rsquo;t be a line. All that about your sister! Oh, Lance.... Mom likes
  you! That is the last straw! My lovely patrician mother!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She was just&mdash;moved by my&mdash;my service to you,&rdquo; said
  Lance, unsteadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t start that stuff. This is serious,&rdquo; she
  rejoined, and halting beyond the last archway, she turned to him in the white
  moonlight. In that light, shining from the pale oval of her face, her eyes
  held the sum of all beauty. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
  like you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe that is lucky for me,&rdquo; he returned, huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, are you engaged to any girl in Oregon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;indeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you fancy-free?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he lied, glibly enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You made a play for Bonita. Oh, I know. She gave you away&mdash;and
  herself. I was brazen enough to pump her.... Lance, do you know Ren Starr has
  a terrible case on Bonita?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I found that out pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were only playing with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t admit that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not since I found out about Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, these college friends of mine, particularly Barg and Nate,
  are nuts over that little Mexican hussy. She&rsquo;s half white, yes, but the
  Latin blood dominates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bonita isn&rsquo;t quite all that,&rdquo; rejoined Lance,
  stoutly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is. And I&rsquo;m a jealous cat. But all this is for
  Ren&rsquo;s sake.... You seem to be as big as that mountain there. Are you
  big enough to play Ren&rsquo;s game&mdash;to keep these college devils away
  from her? They&rsquo;re on the make. One or the other, most likely Nate, will
  get her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not quite so&mdash;so big as
  that,&rdquo; answered Lance, led on and on by the deadly sweetness of her,
  and by the infernal power of his bleeding vanity.</p>

  <p>She released his arm and averted her face. Like a cameo the perfect
  profile shone as if cut out of marble. The night breeze stirred her golden
  hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed in you&mdash;again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should you be, Miss Stewart?&rdquo; he queried, stiffly,
  fighting a struggle almost vain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m human&mdash;the same as
  you. Just no good!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she cried, wheeling with a startled movement.
  &ldquo;Smile&mdash;when you say that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Lance did not smile. She had wanted to be serious and he had told her
  the truth. Without a word she left him standing there. Lance stepped into the
  black shadow of the wall, his thoughts whirling, his conscience stinging, his
  judgment at fault, his love valiantly championing this perverse and wayward
  beauty. A thousand wild queries did not lodge in his mind, let alone find an
  answer. There was not any answer to anything. Why had she asked those direct
  thought-provoking questions? How easy to escape from her if she were only
  like Beulah! But Madge Stewart had the insidious power to make men believe in
  her sincerity. Her look was enough to lift any poor masculine fool to the
  seventh heaven&mdash;to be convinced that he was the one man!</p>

  <p>Lance&rsquo;s endless ravings were disrupted by approaching voices. Two
  people were coming down the patio path. Then Madge&rsquo;s silver laughter, a
  little mocking, froze Lance to the spot. They came clear to the inside
  wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, you drive me mad,&rdquo; came in Rollie Stevens&rsquo;
  subdued voice. &ldquo;You know you have no use for that cowboy. You told me
  so. Yet for days now you&rsquo;ve been rotten to me, on his account! Oh, I
  get it! Sidway hasn&rsquo;t fallen for you&mdash;and that&rsquo;s piqued your
  vanity. Besides you want his horse. Why don&rsquo;t you give the fellow a
  break? He&rsquo;s a real man. He&rsquo;s not a sap. But pretty soon
  he&rsquo;ll fall for you, even if he knows you&rsquo;re not on the level with
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, I might be in earnest,&rdquo; she scoffed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rot! Why, Majesty Stewart, only a month ago you said you&mdash;you
  might marry me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was a month ago, darling. An age!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, you can&rsquo;t marry a cowboy,&rdquo; he expostulated,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. But&mdash;why
  couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lady of quality, a talented girl. Why he&rsquo;s not
  of your class. Admitting Sidway is a fine chap&mdash;I like him,
  Majesty&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t marry him. Oh, to talk of it is
  preposterous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Skip it.... Rollie! don&rsquo;t kiss me right here in
  the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he did,&rdquo; he returned, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your cowboy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He never even thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My word!&mdash;Majesty, can you expect me to believe
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A slight scuffle followed, a protest from the girl, then the soft sounds
  of kisses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, you needn&rsquo;t tear my clothes off. Pick up my coat. And
  remember, my back is too sore for hugging.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling&mdash;it maddens me&mdash;to taste your lips. I&rsquo;m
  just wafted...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;New kind of lipstick! All over your face. And mine too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, honest to God&mdash;didn&rsquo;t that Sidway even kiss
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Rollie. He didn&rsquo;t even try, I&rsquo;m ashamed to
  admit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He could have kissed you! All the boys kiss you! It was campus
  talk!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You jealous sap! Surely he could have&mdash;and they do. I rather
  like it. And besides what&rsquo;s a kiss?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what it leads to, Majesty Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Well, it never led me anywhere in particular yet, except to
  muss my dress and make-up, as you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. But you drive me wild.... Kiss me good night,
  sweet. A real one, like you used...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, little boy. Let us go back. I am cold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then soft footfalls and subdued voices faded away. Lance plunged down the
  trail like a blind man. He had his answer.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Every morning Lance awakened under the shadow of impending calamity. What
  was going to happen next? Or what would Madge be up to doing? It did not make
  the slightest difference to Lance, only he seemed to be the one doomed to
  encounter her in moments of stress.</p>

  <p>Things happened to Madge&rsquo;s guests. Pinto ran off with Beulah;
  Pequita, who was a poor swimmer, fell or was pushed off the platform into the
  lake, and nearly drowned; Maramee was kicked in the ankle so badly that she
  could not ride; Allie lolled around all day on the sandy beach and was
  blistered by the sun. In spite of the fact that Stewart insisted on
  Lance&rsquo;s keeping a close watch upon the girls, accidents happened.</p>

  <p>According to Starr the long-looked-for camping trip in the mountains was
  approaching; and that, for two lone cowboys, was a job too big. Starr told
  Lance that he was trying to persuade Madge to take the <i>vaqueros</i> and a
  cook.</p>

  <p>The boys went off on larks of their own contrivance, and on one occasion
  became lost less than ten miles from the ranch. Another time they slipped off
  to town and did not show up at the ranch until late the next day, for which
  jaunt Madge called them &ldquo;a lot of bums.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When, however, the least little thing or something more serious, such as
  Dervish&rsquo;s bolt, happened to Madge, Lance seemed always to be on the
  spot. This morning he was morosely counting the occurrences, and wondering if
  the last two had been strictly bona fide, yet nursing a sense of guilt
  because of his doubt.</p>

  <p>There were endless jobs. He was laboring on a corncrib. Ren had taken the
  boys fishing. And just about the time Lance forgot his woe, there came a wild
  clamor of screams from the big barn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds scary. Now what the hell?&rdquo; he muttered, darkly, and
  strode for the barn. The first screams might have been mirth, but those
  following sent Lance into a run. He dashed up the runway.</p>

  <p>The girls were in a pandemonium of fright, shrieking, pale as death and
  wild-eyed. It could not be an ordinary circumstance. Missing Madge from the
  group Lance yelled: &ldquo;Shut up!&mdash;Where&rsquo;s Madge? What&rsquo;s
  the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save her, cowboy&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she falls... it... it&rsquo;ll be terrible!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is she? What is it?&rdquo; yelled Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Girls, if you tell him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll hate you,&rdquo; cried
  Madge, piercingly from somewhere. &ldquo;Lance Sidway, you get out&mdash;of
  here! Don&rsquo;t you dare look!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that juncture Beulah Allen ran to Lance, &ldquo;She was swinging on the
  hay rope&mdash;from one loft to the other.... Sitting on the noose!...
  Something gave way&mdash;and up she went bang against the roof....
  There!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out for you, Bu Allen!&rdquo; raged Madge.</p>

  <p>Then Lance saw Madge up under the roof, hard against the wheel. The noose
  evidently slipped from her hips, up to her armpits, and had stripped her that
  far. But Lance saw only those terrible eyes and the scarlet face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Go away</i>!&rdquo; she shrieked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, you&rsquo;re in great danger,&rdquo; flashed Lance....
  &ldquo;Grab the wheel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather die&mdash;than&mdash;have you...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t look at you&mdash;directly,&rdquo; fumed Lance,
  angrily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <i>see</i> you. I wouldn&rsquo;t give a whoop
  to... didn&rsquo;t you ever meet a gentleman?... hang on!&mdash;Help me,
  girls. Make a pile of hay right under her&mdash;so if she falls...
  .&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Frantically he began to drag huge armloads of hay from the loft, flinging
  them to the girls. They worked with a will. Then Lance dashed to the
  windlass. It was an old-fashioned hay-fork contrivance, and the heavy reel,
  owing no doubt to a swinging rock wired on it for a balance, had slipped to
  jerk her aloft.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; shouted Lance, as soon as he had loosened the
  rope and taken a strong grip. &ldquo;Let go the wheel up there.... Down you
  come.... Hang on to the rope now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re squeezing me&mdash;to death,&rdquo; cried Madge.</p>

  <p>Madge reached the floor and the rope went slack. A chorus of tender and
  commiserating exclamations came from the girls who had surrounded Madge. Bu
  Allen met Lance with a twinkle in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not hurt much. I&rsquo;ll say she got squeezed
  <i>once</i> hard enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance made no effort to approach the circle around Madge, who evidently
  lay prostrate on the hay. He had been forced to expend breath as much through
  emotion as effort. Bu put a sympathetic hand on his arm. Lance received the
  impression that the girl, despite her sophistication, was someone to
  like.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Girls&mdash;is&mdash;she hurt?&rdquo; panted Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that we can tell,&rdquo; replied Allie, who knelt on the hay.
  Maramee had Madge&rsquo;s head in her lap. Her abbreviated costume had been
  decently arranged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that dragon killer?&rdquo; asked Madge, her voice
  weak, but spirit apparently undaunted.</p>

  <p>Bu Allen dragged Lance over to the pile of hay, where Madge lay, white as
  a sheet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with inscrutable eyes on
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would&mdash;would what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be the one to catch me in that stunt. I used to do it when I was
  little. It never occurred to me to look at the windlass. I&rsquo;m an idiot.
  ... Sidway, please promise you&rsquo;ll not tell Nels or Dad, or even
  Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It never happened, Miss Stewart,&rdquo; rejoined Lance,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help me to the car,&rdquo; she replied, and with Allie and
  Maramee&rsquo;s assistance arose painfully to her feet. &ldquo;The knot on
  that damned noose stuck into my back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girls helped Madge in, and then piled in themselves, with Allie at the
  wheel. Madge leaned over the door and took hold of the dusty edge of
  Lance&rsquo;s vest with unsteady fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I thank you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But that&rsquo;s not necessary,&rdquo; returned Lance,
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought to be decent enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, you said it,&rdquo; chimed in Beulah.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just waiting for something big,&rdquo; added Allie
  softly. &ldquo;Anyway, Lance, we all thank you from the bottom of our
  hearts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway, don&rsquo;t you save me any more,&rdquo; said Madge,
  imperiously. &ldquo;Not from hayforks, fences, horses, cars&mdash;from
  college youths or gangsters&mdash;nor from <i>myself</i>. If you do,
  I&rsquo;ll not be responsible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are those orders?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re orders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I&rsquo;ll not be present next time. And I won&rsquo;t
  attend your funeral!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The car rolled away.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Lance felt inclined to the conviction that it was his careful avoidance of
  the girls the next few days which kept him out of hot water. Still he had to
  hear about their mishaps and stunts from Ren, who had been relegated to the
  job, and who raved rapturously through supper, and then long afterward, to
  Lance&rsquo;s disgust. It did not help Lance&rsquo;s mood to realize that he
  listened keenly when he might have gone out of hearing.</p>

  <p>On the third night, however, Ren, for some reason appeared very glum and
  silent. Nels ventured a few sly queries. And when Lance added: &ldquo;Has our
  poodle had his tail pulled?&rdquo; Ren stalked out and stamped to his
  room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he ain&rsquo;t often like thet,&rdquo; said Nels, ponderingly.
  &ldquo;Reckon one of us ought to make a move, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, Nels,&rdquo; returned Lance, and lighting a
  cigarette he went out. Approaching Ren&rsquo;s door and seeing that the light
  was out, Lance knocked and said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, old man. I was only kidding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, I know that. It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; replied Ren,
  gruffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Little off your feed, Ren?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon.... An&rsquo; I was made out a turrible sucker
  today!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, who&rsquo;d you think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bonita?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet little hussy!&mdash;Say, she&rsquo;s lost her haid over them
  boys. I cain&rsquo;t do a damn thing about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try. They&rsquo;re only in fun, Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like hell they air!&rdquo; ejaculated the cowboy, bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, I lay off Bonita for your sake. Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have.
  She liked me. And I&rsquo;m your pal, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re damn right you shouldn&rsquo;t. Them boys hev been
  chasin&rsquo; Bonita an&rsquo; her friends pretty hard lately, an&rsquo;
  unbeknown to Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so good, Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good!&mdash;It&rsquo;s pretty bad, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll walk down and give the kid a spiel, Ren.... But, I
  forgot. Who made the sucker out of you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind now, pard. I don&rsquo;t want to hear you
  whoop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance strolled off the long porch across the square, and down the road
  toward the high wall of poplar trees that marked the village. The night was
  close and warm. Merry voices up by the lake attested to the presence of night
  bathers. The strumming of a guitar and the lilt of a Spanish love song suited
  the summer night. At the corner Lance turned left to go down the long avenue
  of poplars. Lance passed the deserted adobe houses, then the lighted store,
  and beyond that the noisy cantina. Here there was no one out under the
  vine-covered trellis. Peeping in he saw a number of Mexicans, but no girls or
  white men. Lance crossed the street, and in the deep shadow of the other lane
  of poplars, he went slowly on toward Danny Mains&rsquo; house. When he got to
  the corner he halted in the shadow. The gate was beyond a little ways. Lance
  thought he would hang around a little before he went in. There were both
  lights and music in the Mains&rsquo; cottage. Presently three bareheaded
  girls appeared, scarfs round their shoulders. The foremost was Bonita. They
  hesitated, whispering excitedly, and were evidently expecting someone. When
  Lance called Bonita she gave a start and then approached slowly, while the
  other girls hung back. He met her at the gate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, kiddo. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Señor</i> Lance!&mdash;I was afraid it might be my brother
  Manuel... I&rsquo;ve&mdash;we have a date.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look it. Sweet as a wild rose!... Bonita, have you gone back on
  Ren and me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No indeed. But I never see you&mdash;and him so seldom. He&rsquo;s
  jealous. Tries to boss me. I won&rsquo;t stand it, Lance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame you. Has he asked you to marry him
  yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has not,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;But he did say I was
  so&mdash;so bad he wasn&rsquo;t sure he wanted me to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a tough one.... Bonita, have you been stepping
  out a little lately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so very. Tonight&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve consented to
  go to town. Francisca and Maria have both been. I&rsquo;m scared. If Daddy
  finds it out he&rsquo;ll whip me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay home. Come with me to see Ren. He&rsquo;s blue. Let the others
  go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, if <i>you</i> wanted me for yourself I&rsquo;d break any
  date. I&rsquo;d rather. These young college men are too swift for Bonita
  Mains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, honey. Now don&rsquo;t be a little chump. It&rsquo;s all
  right to go if you refuse to drink. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the movies and
  dancing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They all drink like fish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; And Lance laughed at the frank girl. He drew her
  close to him and kissed her. &ldquo;Bonita, get a load of this. I like you
  myself&mdash;more than these college guests of Miss Stewart&rsquo;s. But Ren
  loves you, dearly. I know it. And I&rsquo;d hate to see you two fail to make
  a go of it. Now be a good kid. Promise me. I&rsquo;ll make a date with you
  for tomorrow night, like this, so we can talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I promise, Lance,&rdquo; she replied, happily, her hands on his
  arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not drink tonight. If you can&rsquo;t patch it up
  between Ren and me, it&rsquo;ll not be my fault.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell! You&rsquo;re okay, Bonita, and Ren is a crabby old
  sourdough. We&rsquo;ll fix it.... Hello!&mdash;a car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming. Perhaps it&rsquo;d be just as well if you
  weren&rsquo;t seen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance gave her dark head a pat and hurried back into the shadow of the
  trees. But the car did not come close to the house, and Lance could not
  ascertain to whom it belonged. The girls ran out and were taken in with merry
  greetings. As the car went on, Lance thought he saw a figure hanging on
  behind. Presently, being certain of this, he took to the road and strolled
  down the hill. He knew that if someone had stolen a ride, he would not stick
  on for long, not on desert roads at the speed these fellows liked.</p>

  <p>This car, however, did not appear to open up, until it reached the level
  valley floor. Lance kept on, presently reaching the level, where the dry wash
  and the sand made rough going for a space. At length he gave up and was about
  to turn back when he almost bumped into someone sitting on the low bank of
  the road. A little peal of silvery laughter magnified his start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway! I was just gambling with myself how soon you&rsquo;d
  arrive,&rdquo; said Madge Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So am I. Fatally damned to have <i>you</i> get me out of every
  scrape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tough break. You&rsquo;re not alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. Allie was in the plot with me. She was to hang onto the
  other side. Either she did not get on or she was jolted off. You didn&rsquo;t
  see her along the road?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. She couldn&rsquo;t have come. I saw only one person hanging on
  the back of that car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw me? When?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When the car stopped outside Mains&rsquo; house. I was with Bonita.
  The other girls waited in the yard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I see. Johnny on the spot!&mdash;Did you get who the boys
  were?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. That didn&rsquo;t interest me particularly. Bonita told me
  these boys were too swift for her. What Bonita does is probably none of my
  affair, but I am interested because of Ren. So I urged her not to drink and
  she said she wouldn&rsquo;t. Bonita is easily influenced if you go about it
  right. I&rsquo;ve been Ren&rsquo;s friend, with her, if you know what I
  mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t until now,&rdquo; returned Madge, bluntly. &ldquo;We
  girls thought the boys were going to the cantina with the girls. I think it
  lousy of them, especially of Barg Hillcote. Just engaged to Maramee! There I
  go spilling my insides.... Lance Sidway, men are all rotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; answered Lance, uncertainly. She had begun to strike
  him rather singularly, as she had not moved, and she sat leaning back on both
  hands with one leg up over the bank. In the starlight he could see her lovely
  face and speaking eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maramee would break her engagement with Barg for this. I would. And
  she&rsquo;s been so happy.... I hope to goodness Allie didn&rsquo;t get on
  and fall off.... Surely she&rsquo;ll come soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; Lance said suddenly, and he
  leaned close to Madge, peering at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Guess I got hurt,&rdquo; she replied, with great inscrutable eyes
  meeting his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My foot. This one. Thought at first I&rsquo;d sprained my ankle.
  But I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo; Lance stepped up on the bank and knelt. She had
  taken off her shoe and stocking. Her white foot and leg gleamed in the
  starlight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo; she cried. But he went right on until
  she screamed out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, all right, touchy!... Let me see you move it.... Flex
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I can do that. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your ankle is okay. You&rsquo;ve sprained your instep&mdash;or
  something. But if you keep off it and use hot water frequently, you&rsquo;ll
  be all right tomorrow or next day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to walk back home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t. Let me get your
  car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want anyone to know about this, and they will if
  I come in the car. I&rsquo;ll have to sneak in by the west wing to my room.
  I&rsquo;ll have to walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense. I can easily carry you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed outrageously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I can. I&rsquo;m strong,&rdquo; protested Lance, earnest,
  amazed, solicitous. &ldquo;I can throw a hundred pound sack of grain all over
  the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strong? I know you&rsquo;re a perfect Hercules, Mr. Sidway,&rdquo;
  she said, tauntingly. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t have you packing me
  around.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Very carefully she stepped, and moved up the slope. Every time her injured
  foot touched the ground it must have pained greatly, Lance knew. He put a
  hand under her arm and half lifted her along. They came into a trail, and
  that appeared to be easier for Madge. When they arrived at the pines,
  however, she was tottering. But this girl was the kind that could not
  quit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you let me carry you?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
  &ldquo;You did once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not the queerest, screwiest girl, I&rsquo;ll eat my
  hat!&rdquo; declared Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, when you haven&rsquo;t one!&rdquo; she retorted. When she
  started on, Lance knew she would not make it much farther. And he bided his
  time, hot and perplexed. Finally she swore and sobbed almost in the same
  breath. Without a word more he picked her up in his arms and went on.
  Shifting his hold, so she would carry more comfortably for her, he said:
  &ldquo;There. Isn&rsquo;t that better? I hardly feel your weight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better, indeed. But I fear&mdash;riskier,&rdquo; she returned in a
  queer voice.</p>

  <p>Lance had to look at her. Before that, all had seemed well. He was
  relieved to save her pain. Her face lay high up on his right arm, almost on
  his breast, turned toward him somewhat, and its lovely proximity grew
  suddenly exciting. She was looking at him with eyes whose expression he could
  not fathom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Riskier!&mdash;What do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see I am utterly helpless. You might get a cave-man notion... .
  Really that wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. But you probably just kissed
  Bonita...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did. For Ren&rsquo;s sake&mdash;mostly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye gods and little fishes!... And no doubt it was Bu Allen last
  night. She came in with her lipstick all smeared up. Radiant. Bold as the
  very devil. And she didn&rsquo;t deny it when we kidded her about
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, I did not see her last night,&rdquo; protested
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for Pete&rsquo;s sake, can the Miss.... It doesn&rsquo;t sound
  natural.... And well, if you <i>had</i> been with Bu, you&rsquo;d have kissed
  her, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That would have depended entirely upon her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How chivalrous! If she had been suffering for contact or
  release&mdash;or what have you, why you&rsquo;d have been a perfect
  necker.... Lance, you give me a pain in the neck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. But why&mdash;why?&rdquo; he demanded, furiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must be because you&rsquo;re a liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Madge Stewart, you give me worse than that&mdash;and
  it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re no good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me down. You said that before. I&rsquo;ll die before
  I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bunk! You can die all right, after I get you home. I hope you do. I
  hope you choke on your terrible tongue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anger and intense mortification, and some other emotion began to augment
  in Lance&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The girls think you&rsquo;ve the sweetest disposition&mdash;that
  you&rsquo;re the swellest fellow. My God!&rdquo; And she uttered a tinkling
  little laugh that cut into Lance like icy blades.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your boy friends think the same of you. But they&rsquo;re a lot of
  sapheads. They don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bet your&mdash;sweet life I do. Better than you have any
  idea,&rdquo; he panted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rest here, young Lochinvar! or you&rsquo;ll fall. I think, after
  all, you&rsquo;re not so strong. This magnificent frame is pithy&mdash;like
  your head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance groaned under the excess of his burdens. Halfway up to the house, in
  one of the little bench parks under the pines, he sat down on a boulder to
  regain his equilibrium, but he did not let go of Madge. He could feel the
  throb of her against his throbbing. And all at once he happened to think of
  what she had told Rollie that last night. Under the galvanizing stress of the
  idea that leaped out of it he arose like a giant and a fiend. He wrapped his
  long arms closer about her and drew her wholly against his breast. Madge
  seemed totally calm. Then Lance kissed her, not with any particular feeling,
  but merely as a preliminary.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought it was about time,&rdquo; muttered Madge.</p>

  <p>Then, staggering on under the pines, he kissed her cheeks, her eyes, her
  hair, her neck&mdash;and when at last she protested, Lance stopped her mouth
  with his, in an endless passionate kiss which magnified all he had ever
  bestowed in his life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn&mdash;you!&rdquo; she panted, as he moved a moment to breathe.
  And she began to pound him&mdash;to tear at his hair. &ldquo;You insult
  me...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Insult <i>you</i>!&mdash;Good
  God&mdash;it&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;be&mdash;done,&rdquo; he mocked her,
  breathlessly. &ldquo;I heard you say&mdash;you rather liked it...
  .&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;<i>what</i>...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine ought to be&mdash;as good as any of those guys&mdash;and
  cleaner, by heaven! and fresher&mdash;from lack of promiscuous
  practice.&rdquo; And bending over, squeezing her face up immovably, he began
  to kiss her lips like a madman. His kisses choked off her scream. After one
  frantic and tense struggle she collapsed in his arms. And he kissed her for
  every step, on under the pines, out upon the drive, almost to the front
  archway. Keeping outside the drive he passed this, and once in the shrubbery
  he began again his ravenous tasting of her lips, as if his appetite grew with
  what it fed upon. But not until he rounded the west wing and reached her
  window did he realize that her face, her lips, her body had changed. Her eyes
  were closed tightly&mdash;heavy eyelids dreamy, long curled lashes on her
  cheeks; her lips bowed, open, sweet with a strange fire; her breast pressed
  on his. Not until Lance lifted her into the open window did he realize that
  she had an arm round his neck. He lowered her carefully to the floor. Then he
  leaned on the sill, spent and devastated.</p>

  <p>She stirred, and sat up, and laboriously climbed upon the bed. Lance,
  watching her, expected, yearned for a scourging, bitter enough even for him.
  But she just looked at him. In the starlight he saw her face as only he would
  carry it in his heart forever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty,&rdquo; he began, in husky whisper, &ldquo;I...&rdquo; but
  he could not go on.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">MADGE sat upon her bed gazing tensely out of her window into
  the gloom where Lance Sidway had vanished. A fringe of her senses seemed to
  register the drowsy murmur of water, the rustle of leaves, the chirp of
  crickets, as well as loud voices and gay laughter of some of her guests in
  the living room. But for all that, her acute senses coalesced on her burning
  cheeks and neck, her breast, and especially her lips on fire with that
  cowboy&rsquo;s terrible kisses.</p>

  <p>Not all at once could her wit and intelligence throw off that spell. She
  found herself rubbing her stockingless leg and ankle. The tightness around
  her foot, the heat, meant injury in some degree, but she felt no pain. Over
  and above these sensations thundered the truth, clearing in her mind. She had
  ranged the gamut of incredible feeling&mdash;from pique, surprise, shock,
  fury to a sudden overwhelming tumult of love, of her willful changing moods,
  her wounded vanity, her temper and upflaring hate, and her softening doubt,
  her endless misgivings and suspicion, that had kept her up and down for days,
  only to have this shameful assault leave her undone, madly in love at last,
  stricken forever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can take it!&rdquo; whispered Madge, with her fluttering
  hand on her hot lips. She did not weep. She asked no quarter. She had her
  just deserts. But she was not as he believed&mdash;that shot through her with
  a passionate pang. From the very beginning everything had worked to her
  detriment. Her imperious demand for that horse? No&mdash;that was not the
  first. Her meeting with the gangster Uhl! That had started her wrong with
  this Oregon boy. And every single thing afterward had gone wrong&mdash;her
  tempers and her tricks, her insincerity and subterfuge, her nasty tongue and
  open satire. He must have overheard her saying she rather liked being kissed.
  That night when Rollie had met her after Lance had infuriated her! But there
  was nothing to be ashamed of about that. It was true, only on the moment she
  was torturing Rollie. The cowboy had something these other boys lacked. His
  recent treatment of her was wholly at variance with that, and seemed
  inexplicable to Madge. He did not want to kiss her. He did not approve of
  her. He despised her. He must have possessed some kind of a masculine trait
  that made her kissing promiscuity intolerable and abhorrent. He was avenging
  the throng of boys she had kissed and forgotten. There were a thousand slants
  and angles to this outrageous assault upon her&mdash;only one terrible
  revelation accruing from them! The doom of love, that she had trifled with so
  regally and callously, had fallen upon her. How impossible to understand! If
  Lance Sidway had entered her room that moment and snatched her up.... But he
  had not known she had been, at the last, taking his kisses and spending her
  soul in exchange. And suddenly Madge was possessed of an insane rage. She
  wanted to kill him. It would not be enough to have him horsewhipped and
  driven away. He must not live to kiss girls like Bonita and have the sunlight
  shine in his hazel eyes for some other....</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nuts!&rdquo; burst out Madge, baldly, suddenly sick of herself,
  so weary that the fury drained out of her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put this day of
  reckoning off long enough!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her exclamation must have been heard, for clicking high heels sounded on
  the stone corridor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty!&rdquo; called Allie, in great eagerness. &ldquo;Did I hear
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. I was cussing. Come in. I&rsquo;ve a
  story to unfold. What happened to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me!&mdash;I was thrown in the dust,&rdquo; whispered Allie.
  &ldquo;Blinded. I couldn&rsquo;t see a thing. The car was gone and you with
  it. I felt my way back to my room and washed the dust from my eyes. After
  that I walked under the pines&mdash;down the road&mdash;watching for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Funny you didn&rsquo;t see that cowboy carrying me or hear him
  kissing me. Must have sounded like a decisive battle of the world!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Majesty!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be careful, darling. I&rsquo;m a cripple. I fell off the car, too.
  Hurt my foot.... Help me into my bathroom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There between the two of them, Madge boiled out the pain in her foot, and
  bound it up, to find then that she could walk without limping. She sent Allie
  out to find where everybody was, and bade her return to sleep with her. Madge
  found it good to stretch out in bed, in the dark, and wonder. Presently Allie
  came back, to feel her way to Madge&rsquo;s side. It was a mutual emotion
  that caused them to seek each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your mother has gone to bed, I think,&rdquo; whispered Allie.
  &ldquo;Snake was playing checkers with your dad. I told them you were tired.
  Your dad seemed concerned. &lsquo;Madge tired? that&rsquo;s unheard
  of.&rsquo; He looked worn himself, poor dear. Majesty, do you know I&rsquo;ve
  an idea he worries about you and us....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Skip it!&mdash;Where were the girls?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In their rooms, lolling, fussing, gossiping. Except Bu. She&rsquo;s
  down the hill looking for cowboys, so Dixie said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Madge, poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What ails you, darling? You act kind of queer and talk worse.
  You&rsquo;re burning up. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve got fever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fever!&mdash;Ha! Ha!&mdash;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got galloping fever... .
  And the boys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down playing pool. Wouldn&rsquo;t take the girls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Frame-up to shield that trio of heels!&rdquo; whispered Madge.
  &ldquo;All in the know about that date.... Darling, get a load of this. Barg
  and Dawson and Brand were in that car. And down below they took in Bonita and
  two of her friends. They went to town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty! Not really.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say. What do you think of them, Barg
  especially?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Barg?&mdash;Lousy is too lovely a word. That dirty little bum!
  Just finally won Maramee, and he pulls such a stunt. Maramee is so happy. She
  thinks Barg is perfect. It&rsquo;ll break her heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She must never know. Don&rsquo;t you breathe it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, darling, they don&rsquo;t mean any harm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Barg and the boys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose they do mean any harm, but it hauls me
  up, Allie. I&rsquo;ve done my damnedest to entertain this crowd.
  They&rsquo;re swell, only they want to do what they like. Suppose
  there&rsquo;d be an accident, or a fight, or they drank too much, and got
  stuck out all night. That happens, when no harm is intended. What&rsquo;d my
  dad say? I grow stiff at the very thought. He&rsquo;s such a peach. He
  believes I&rsquo;m so.... Oh, hell!... What would Danny Mains say? Good old
  scout. Worships that black-eyed flip! What would that cowboy <i>do</i>? My
  heavens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty! Someone will hear you. Cowboy! You mean Sidway? It&rsquo;s
  none of his business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, though? Ren Starr is his pal. Ren has been at
  Bonita&rsquo;s feet for long. And Lance has been courting her for him. Would
  he be sore? He was sore tonight, maybe somewhat because I... Allie, that
  cowboy would call the boys down to the barn...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, honey, nothing terrible has happened yet. It
  won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it has&mdash;to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; whispered Madge, tragically.
  &ldquo;Death wouldn&rsquo;t be half so hard!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, are you crazy? Such talk! What happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge hugged her loyal friend close and shook over her. &ldquo;I fell off
  the car way down the road. Hurt my foot. I took off my shoe and stocking.
  Then I sat up on the bank waiting. I knew who&rsquo;d come. I&rsquo;d have
  bet my soul. And he <i>did</i> come. Sidway, the darned inquisitive rooster.
  We talked, and as always in a few moments we were at each other&rsquo;s
  throats. All before he knew I was hurt. When he found that out he was human
  for a little bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t let him go for a car or for help, and I
  started walking up the hill. Hurt? Oh, Lord, did it? Pretty soon he grabbed
  me up in his arms. I gave him some dirty digs because I knew he&rsquo;d kiss
  me. No fellow yet ever got that far with me without kissing me. And I was
  scared of having Sidway do that. Allie, I&mdash;l-liked him too much....
  Well, pretty soon he did. I never was so mad in my life, just at first....
  After that I began to like it. I thought he was going to eat me alive....
  Allie, he lighted some kind of a conflagration in me. If I hadn&rsquo;t been
  too weak I&rsquo;d have.... Oh!&mdash;But I couldn&rsquo;t move. It was only
  after he tumbled me in my window here that I realized I&rsquo;d been in a
  trance of bliss... that at last there... I&rsquo;d been kissing him for every
  kiss he&rsquo;d given me. It all comes to me gradually. Later I&rsquo;ll
  remember some of the things he said, and tell you.... Allie, darling,
  I&rsquo;ve told you many stories in the dead of night&mdash;after love dates,
  blind dates, hells. But what do you say to this one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, you <i>love</i> him!&rdquo; whispered Allie, in awe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! So you get that? What wonderful perspicacity, darling!
  Never mind about me&mdash;about the dual rotten nature that has turned on me
  ... but what did Lance Sidway mean? Tell me that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, it&rsquo;s beyond the bounds of human possibility that he
  doesn&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s a man. And you&rsquo;ve placed him on the
  damnedest spots. Seeing you every day and every way.... Why, Madge. I was
  sorry for him the other day at the lake. You in that indecent bathing
  suit&mdash;the boys wallowing you all over the sand! And he stuck there to
  save our lives if we got cramps!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wrong again. But what did <i>you</i> see?&rdquo; flashed Madge, in
  a passionate whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw the look in his eyes. You know he has beautiful eyes, when
  they&rsquo;re soft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as sentimental as Maramee, and as gullible. That
  cowboy hates my very insides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, sweet, listen. For God&rsquo;s sake use some brains.
  Isn&rsquo;t it conceivable that I should finally fall foul of a real man who
  sees through me&mdash;who has my number&mdash;whom I can&rsquo;t fool or
  intrigue or fascinate or seduce&mdash;who has fine ideals, and who
  consequently despises me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s conceivable. That&rsquo;d be a horrible misfortune.
  ... But if Sidway wasn&rsquo;t mad about you he couldn&rsquo;t act as he
  does. Actions, my proud savage! Actions! Any boy or man can rave. But
  it&rsquo;s actions that count. He&rsquo;s done something, hasn&rsquo;t
  he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done me wrong,&rdquo; wailed Madge, fighting vainly
  against the sweet madness of Allie&rsquo;s loyal convictions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the day you were caught in the noose of the hay rope. Madge,
  do you imagine any man ever recovering from <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From&mdash;what?&rdquo; asked Madge, faintly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From seeing you&mdash;from your chin down&mdash;without a
  stitch!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! He&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t see me... he swore he
  didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He <i>did</i>, Madge Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Allie! I&rsquo;m so horribly afraid he&rsquo;ll turn out big
  and fine and noble&mdash;despite all&mdash;that tonight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was indicating his sex.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was jealous. They <i>all</i> kiss you. So would he&mdash;and
  make one swell job of it. I think he&rsquo;s grand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a traitor, Allie Leland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re that, Madge, to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t be a traitor to anyone,&rdquo; retorted
  Madge, fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a queen and a law unto yourself. Sidway will not bend to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Spent, but still unconvinced, Madge lay there in her friend&rsquo;s
  arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, have you <i>ever</i> been your true self to Sidway?&rdquo;
  asked Allie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, once. The first time. That campus day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then go back to that. Even if he hates you unmercifully,
  he&rsquo;ll come around. After we are gone&mdash;and we shouldn&rsquo;t drag
  this grand vacation out selfishly....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gone! I couldn&rsquo;t stay. Yet I must. This is home. I owe it to
  Dad and Mom. But&mdash;alone on the range with that eagle-eyed cowboy! Mom
  says he is like Dad used to be! Dad is hipped on him. And Nels.... Oh, what
  is the use?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, it&rsquo;ll all work out. But I&rsquo;m afraid you must
  suffer more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a heart, will you? For Pete&rsquo;s sake! I&rsquo;ve been
  dying for weeks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, compose yourself and get to sleep,&rdquo; begged Allie,
  tenderly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead tired. But sleep! What&rsquo;ll I do when I wake
  up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean about <i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why be just the same as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You callous woman!... Allie&mdash;I think&mdash;I guess...&rdquo;
  faltered Madge, finally weakening to tears... &ldquo;I&rsquo;m licked....
  I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;he&rsquo;ll go&mdash;away!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Golden sunlight streaming in at Madge&rsquo;s window seemed inconsistent
  with the gray gloomy void she wanted to believe was her lot. Allie had gone
  out in her dressing gown to fetch some coffee and toast. Madge&rsquo;s foot
  felt stiff, but it was not going to incapacitate her in the least. What she
  wanted most right at that moment was to be down at the corrals. Would Lance
  be such a coward as that&mdash;to run off for fear she would betray him? What
  kind of girls had he known anyway? She would not have hurt him in her
  father&rsquo;s estimation for anything in the world. She was consumed with a
  desire to see Sidway this morning. To see if the monster resembled in any
  degree her conception! He should be haggard, drawn, after a sleepless night,
  burdened by guilt, unable to look anyone in the eye.</p>

  <p>Allie returned, escorted by a bevy of bright-eyed girls, all of whom had
  been in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lazy girl! It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Maramee, whose
  sweet face appeared so gay and happy that Madge wondered at the credulity of
  human nature. They all came in, their colorful print dresses bright around
  Madge&rsquo;s bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are Dixie and Bu?&rdquo; asked Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Horse mad. Dixie loves to sit on the corral fence and Bu is crazy
  to ride everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get piled up,&rdquo; declared Madge, severely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Bu&rsquo;s been piled up, as you call it. But she picks
  herself up and yelps for more. The cowboys get some kick out of
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a little Madge inquired for the boys. Gone, hours before, off on a
  hiking trip!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; ejaculated Madge, her cup halted halfway to her
  lips. &ldquo;Not Barg and... and...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Barg,&rdquo; declared Maramee, happily. &ldquo;He poked his
  head in my window and tossed wild roses on my face, to awaken me. Whispered
  he&rsquo;d rather have stayed home with me. Oh, he was darling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To be sure. Barg&rsquo;s a darling, all right....&rdquo; Madge was
  interrupted by the arrival of Dixie Conn, flushed and breathless, no doubt
  from a climb up the hill.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, I thought you were indisposed or something. You just look
  stunning,&rdquo; said the southern girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Thanks, Dix. But you&rsquo;re looking through rose-colored
  spectacles.... Where&rsquo;s Bu?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge&mdash;Girls! That outsider has shown us up. She&rsquo;s
  dishonored the fair name of our sorority.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of Mike&mdash;what now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bu is riding Umpqua right this minute. You know we all tried to
  coax Sidway to let us ride him. Same as Majesty tried to buy him. Nothing
  doing! And now she&rsquo;s down there having a swell time on that grand
  horse. The cowboy is teaching Bu to jump over logs and ditches, and what have
  you? Was I jealous? All the same I had to hand it to Bu. She looked great.
  How&rsquo;d she ever put that over with Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a hunch and I&rsquo;m going to try it,&rdquo; said Selma
  Thorne, subtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t imagine I let any grass grow under my feet,&rdquo;
  declared Dixie. &ldquo;I went up to the cowboy, raved about his horse and
  complimented Bu. Then I said, with all I&rsquo;ve got, old dears,
  &lsquo;Lance, I&rsquo;d almost sell my soul to ride Umpqua!&rsquo; He said,
  &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? I can&rsquo;t read your mind. Umpqua
  loves girls. I&rsquo;d be only too happy to put you up on him. Hang around,
  till Beulah is through.&rsquo; I wasn&rsquo;t dressed for riding as you see,
  so I asked if I might go down early tomorrow. Then he looked troubled. I
  hadn&rsquo;t noticed that. Why, he looked just wretched. And he said:
  &lsquo;Yes, by all means, if I&rsquo;m here. But I expect Miss Stewart to
  fire me this morning!&rsquo;... Majesty, darling, what has he done now? But
  no matter, don&rsquo;t fire Sidway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then the other girls burst into a chorus of appeals and conjectures
  and wisecracks that fairly infuriated Madge. She flung pillows at them.
  &ldquo;Beat it, you pack of imps! I must have been bughouse to invite you
  over here.... Get out!&mdash;<i>No!</i>
  I&rsquo;m&mdash;not&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;fire&mdash;Lance Sidway! Go
  climb on his neck and then on his precious Umpqua for all I care.
  That&rsquo;d be the way to get there. But I&rsquo;d die first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They fled in a fiendish clamor and Madge hid her face in her pillow. It
  was a bad moment. There were many impetuses toward a magnificent fury, which
  she viewed with her mind, one after another. But she could not surrender to
  the one thing that had crushed her&mdash;the perfectly inconsequential and
  natural circumstance of Lance putting Bu Allen up on his horse. The absurdity
  of her childish pique gradually faded in the stern realization that her
  happiness, her future, and the welfare of her dear parents, so fatefully
  bound up in her, were at stake. Well might it be too late! But she would
  humble herself, crucify her selfish imperious side, absolutely refuse
  catastrophe. If she had been half as nice to Sidway as Bu Allen had been she
  would not now be in such extremity.</p>

  <p>Madge prostrated herself before her love, which was to betray her pride
  and spirit. It was too great a thing to deny any longer. But by surrendering
  she gained some aspect of the wit and self-control she needed at this trying
  time. Three betrothals among her guests attested to the success of their
  sojourn at her ranch. That Beulah and Elwell would make a go of it there was
  no reasonable doubt. Madge decided to shorten and intensify the remaining
  stages of their entertainment and center her energies upon the trip into the
  mountains and the dance she had long planned.</p>

  <p>This decision would change for her, and therefore her guests, the idle
  languor of the summer days. To that end, an hour after she left her room, she
  approached her parents, finding them in her mother&rsquo;s room. Evidently
  Madge had interrupted a serious talk, and having changed the direction of her
  mind she looked at them penetratingly, conscious of her neglect this exciting
  summer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darlings, am I intruding?&rdquo; she asked, halting in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>Her mother&rsquo;s sweet response and the light that her presence always
  brought upon her father&rsquo;s dark face assured Madge of her welcome, and
  that indeed she had been remiss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom, you can hide trouble, but Dad can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Madge,
  going to them, and she found that this was not a new thought, only one put
  aside because it hurt. An unaccountable aloofness, arising from her shame,
  kept her from sliding upon the arm of Stewart&rsquo;s chair. When had she
  done that? How little she had seen of him for a month and more! His reserve
  betrayed it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has my crowd gotten on your nerves?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have been somewhat trying,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Stewart, with a
  smile. &ldquo;But that was only because of our difficulty in adjusting
  ourselves to excitement and mirth and&mdash;well, the life they brought with
  them. I like them all, Madge. Your favorite Allie is mine, too. And the boys
  are fine. I&rsquo;m glad you had them all here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; queried Madge, poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After they&rsquo;re gone, I&rsquo;ll tell you, lass,&rdquo; replied
  her father, then hastily: &ldquo;Oh, I like them all right. I just mean I
  must get hold of myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m answered.... Has Rollie Stevens
  been nagging you about me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. That young man steers a little clear of me. But he has
  approached Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has told me he wanted to marry you, darling. Three separate
  times. And has taken occasion to tell about the Stevens, their position,
  wealth, and all that. Very correct and a fine young fellow. But, Madge, he
  wouldn&rsquo;t care to live out here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Madge,
  with a laugh. &ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t have him if he would. So skip that,
  Mom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, then&mdash;so you intend to stay home&mdash;a while?&rdquo;
  asked Stewart, a little huskily, gazing away from her out of the window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; If she had followed her swift impulse it would have
  been to throw her arms around his neck. But she could not do it. Her
  intuition grasped something strange here. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pack this
  crowd off sooner than I had expected. And after that I&rsquo;m going to stay
  home for good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was her mother Madge looked at, and she divined that whatever had been
  her thoughtless failings and deplorable shortcomings, they had never changed
  that faithful heart. If she had lost her father, through the years of
  absence, and his inability to understand her when she did come back, she
  divined that would not be a permanent estrangement, because she was kind and
  loving, and if she made amends for her wildness and settled down to a real
  love of him, and her future at the ranch, all would be well. Her quiet talks
  with Nels, too few and far between, had played no small part in the awakening
  of her conscience. Yet remorseful as she felt, her temper would admit of no
  reason that she knew why she should arraign herself at these odd moments. It
  was on account of that cowboy, and because she had been so unaccountably a
  prey to love for him. She had always known she must love some man with all
  her being, desperately, once and for good and she had always been looking for
  him. That might account somewhat for her endless interests.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; asked Madge, after this
  flashing pageant of thought had left her composed, once more in a way to win
  back her old confidence. &ldquo;Nels told me you were worrying over money
  troubles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gabby old woman!&rdquo; ejaculated Stewart, impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with Nels. I coaxed it out of him. I&rsquo;ve
  intended to go at him again&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve been so busy with these
  friends. Besides, Dad, I&rsquo;ve troubles of my own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have? No one would guess it. You are the happiest, gayest, most
  thoughtless of all these young people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the surface. But never mind my trouble now. It&rsquo;s going to
  keep.... What I&rsquo;d like to know is&mdash;when my friends are gone will
  you tell me everything and let me help? For five years I&rsquo;ve spent money
  like a drunken sailor. It&rsquo;s begun to frighten me a little, Dad, if I
  thought... if I found out I&rsquo;d been a spendthrift while you and Mom
  had.... Oh, I&rsquo;d <i>hate</i> that so inexpressibly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Madge&rsquo;s amaze Stewart abruptly took her in his arms and clasped
  her so closely that she could not breathe. And over her he said to her
  mother. &ldquo;Madeline, Nels knows our girl better than we do.&rdquo; Then
  he kissed her hair, her cheek, and rushed out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; she cried, going to her mother. &ldquo;What have I
  done?... Is it?... Oh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, your conscience and your heart have spoken,&rdquo; replied
  her mother, earnestly. &ldquo;I knew they would. I have never doubted. It is
  no small thing for a rich and popular girl to return from college, from a
  great city, to the old-fashioned life of a ranch. Don&rsquo;t distress
  yourself further now. Devote yourself to your friends. When they are gone
  we&rsquo;ll face our problems. You have eliminated the only one that
  concerned me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother! Whether or not I loved you&mdash;and my home?... I&rsquo;ll
  never forgive myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it you girls say? &lsquo;Skip it!&rsquo;... Madge, you will
  not accept young Stevens?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge did not need to avert her eyes, because they were blind with tears.
  &ldquo;No, Mom. I like Rollie, and I&rsquo;ve played with him. He has done
  the same with other girls while courting me. Rollie is a playboy. He
  couldn&rsquo;t stand this lonely range. But I can, Mother!... And I want a
  handsome brute who will beat me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The latter is inconceivable,&rdquo; returned her mother, mildly.
  &ldquo;I hope no such contingency arises. I do not want to see the ranch
  blown to bits or be shaken by some cataclysm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You overrate me, darling. I&rsquo;m a very meek little girl this
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are certainly strange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge&rsquo;s original idea had been to ask her father&rsquo;s advice
  about taking her guests to the wild fastness up in the Peloncillo Hills,
  famous as a stronghold of the great Apache chief, Cochise. Before her school
  days Madge had ridden to this place with her father and the cowboys. She had
  never forgotten it, and it had been one of her cherished hopes to give her
  friends a camping trip there. For some inexplicable reason she found that she
  was cooling on the project, but she was too stubborn and fearful to analyze
  the cause. To abandon the trip after having exalted it continually for weeks
  did not quite suit Madge. She would have welcomed a reasonable excuse for not
  going, and as she considered the plans, that idea amplified. If she
  remembered correctly the ride up to Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold was long and
  arduous, and not for tenderfeet. That very fact had been an incentive. She
  had vowed that her friends would get one experience of the real thing.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Madge, feeling that there was safety for her in numbers, filled
  her car full of girls and drove down to the store. Nels was there, chipper as
  a grasshopper, and ready to sell the girls anything from cigarettes to
  calico. Three separate times Madge&rsquo;s contingent of friends had bought
  the store out, to Nels&rsquo; joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are the cowboys?&rdquo; asked Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance is diggin&rsquo; postholes. An&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s a job he
  hates as turrible as any other cowboy. Ren says every time Lance does
  somethin&rsquo; awful he goes oot an&rsquo; digs postholes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sort of a penance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must be. I seen Ren aboot somewheres a minnit ago. I&rsquo;ll yell
  fer him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It developed that Ren was very easy to locate and soon stood, sombrero in
  hand, his sunburned face beaming, before Madge and her friends.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawning, cowboy. Where&rsquo;s your side partner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Miss Majesty, he&rsquo;s drunk or crazy or
  somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Ren, with a grin. &ldquo;Woke me up before
  daylight, an&rsquo; heah&rsquo;s what he said, kinda loud an&rsquo;
  ringin&rsquo;. &rsquo;ren, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out to dig postholes fer
  thet new fence. If anybody about heah wants to hang me or hawsewhip me,
  I&rsquo;ll be out there. Savvy?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very thoughtful of him,&rdquo; remarked Madge, resisting a deep
  vibration that was more than thrill. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he&mdash;done
  now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone if I know. But it musta been turrible. I says
  &lsquo;Lance, you think you&rsquo;re funny?&rsquo; An&rsquo; he says
  &lsquo;About as funny as death!&rsquo; An&rsquo; he stamps off, without any
  grub. Why, he&rsquo;s worryin&rsquo; pore Nels to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How would you and Sidway like to do me a great favor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Job or jest fun?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a job. No fun at all! I want you to truck your
  horses as far as you can from town toward the Peloncillo Hills. Find the old
  trail up to Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold, and fetch me a report on it and the
  camp site.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it swell, Miss Majesty, an&rsquo; I reckon Lance
  would about pass out to get away fer a spell. But, excuse me, what&rsquo;s
  the big idee? I was huntin&rsquo; deer up there last fall. I can tell you
  most anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, be very serious now. Think of my friends. Is that trip going
  to be a safe and comfortable one for them?&rdquo; And Madge gave Starr a look
  that had passed from her to him on former occasions. Ren suddenly looked
  blank and dropped his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no! it&rsquo;s neither one or the other. But thet&rsquo;s why
  it&rsquo;d be grand.&rdquo; Ren hated to abandon the idea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little afraid of it. You see, Ren, I was sixteen when I
  made it first, had been riding horses all summer and I was fit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girls burst out into bitter lamentations. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re we if
  not fit?... Haven&rsquo;t we been riding horses all summer?&mdash;Madge,
  <i>we</i> don&rsquo;t care a damn how hard it&rsquo;d be. At that, we can
  beat the boys.&rdquo; One and all they put up arguments hard for the
  kindhearted Madge to withstand. When they were out of breath, Bu Allen
  contributed calmly: &ldquo;Lance told me it&rsquo;s a lousy trip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lousy! What&rsquo;s he mean by that?&rdquo; returned Madge, on fire
  in an instant despite the fact that Sidway&rsquo;s inelegant remark was in
  line with her designs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I ask him that? He told me a lot of terrible stuff. Said we
  were all too weak-kneed and soft-bottomed. That&rsquo;s just what he said,
  the bum. He thinks we&rsquo;re a lot of swell kids, but no good for the West.
  And that goes for you, Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am quite aware in what poor opinion Sidway holds me,&rdquo;
  rejoined Madge, cool once more, and her contrariness was such that now she
  felt a mounting desire to go and show him how soft-bottomed she was.
  &ldquo;Ren, you take Sidway, and leave at once. Find out all about the trail
  and Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold. Good and bad. Then upon your return you will
  report to me and all the crowd, after which we&rsquo;ll vote to decide
  whether to go or not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very wal, Miss Majesty, I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; replied
  Ren.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, you&rsquo;re a whiz! Of course, we&rsquo;re on to you. But
  we think this investigation will make the trip irresistible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;d be upon your own heads,&rdquo; warned Madge,
  then calling Ren back she met him halfway, to ask: &ldquo;Will you let me
  know if this plan is acceptable to Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ren regarded her, comically dumfounded. Madge averted her face slightly to
  go on: &ldquo;You see, Ren, he may leave any minute. The more I&mdash;I need
  him the more contrary he grows.&rdquo; She managed that demurely, but she was
  not smiling. Starr&rsquo;s tanned face brightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Majesty, between you an&rsquo; me we know Lance is daid plumb
  nutty, an&rsquo; what it&rsquo;s all about. Fer a time there I kind of feared
  you wasn&rsquo;t on to him. Wal, I am an&rsquo; so is Nels. If you
  don&rsquo;t believe me go to Nels. Shore I&rsquo;m a pore pard to
  double-cross Lance this way. He&rsquo;d kill me if he ever found
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Found out what, Ren?&rdquo; queried Madge, cool and sweet, mistress
  of herself again, but there was an incredible and unbelievable tumult within
  her being.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet I give him away.... Majesty, Lance is a turrible bluff. He
  brags about ridin&rsquo; away. Wal, up to this time he hasn&rsquo;t been able
  to. He&rsquo;s been mad an&rsquo; wild, but he jest <i>cain&rsquo;t</i>
  leave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You surprise me, Ren.... And why?&rdquo; went on Madge, unable to
  resist these precious and unreliable words from Lance&rsquo;s friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you gotta figger thet out fer yourself. An&rsquo; if you
  cain&rsquo;t, why go to Nels. I&rsquo;ve talked too much. Thet son-of-a-gun
  has eyes like gimlets when he&rsquo;s close an&rsquo; telescopes when
  he&rsquo;s far. He might be seein&rsquo; us right now. Anyway all he does is
  watch fer you, Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren! What on earth for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re nice to look at.... I&rsquo;ve
  peeped through a crack in the wall between our rooms&mdash;an&rsquo; seen him
  porin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sighin&rsquo; over a picture. He acted like a man who
  couldn&rsquo;t help lookin&rsquo; when he hated to. Thet picture is one of
  you, Majesty, fer I sneaked in an&rsquo; took a peep. He keeps it under a
  book in his table drawer. Now don&rsquo;t ask me no more. I feel pretty
  yellow. But I&rsquo;d never give him away onless fer my hunch thet you like
  Lance a little. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like&mdash;Lance?&rdquo; repeated Madge, and all her blood seemed
  rushing to her head. &ldquo;Ren, if Lance cannot trust you, how can
  I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t make sense. But you can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trust you. Yes, I do&mdash;like Lance,&rdquo; returned
  Madge, and to save her life she could not have made it casual. She went back
  to the house with the girls, playing her gay part, but there had come a
  complete reversal in her emotional reaction. Ren had vindicated her own deep
  convictions&mdash;that even if Sidway did hate her, he liked her too, against
  his better judgment and will, surely. Once more alone in her room she
  endeavored to stem this tide of overwhelming love, that was so great and so
  humble at the mere words of a sentimental cowboy. It frightened
  Madge&mdash;that flood of feeling. The sweetness of it warned her that this
  was not the time for surrender. But she had a tiny nucleus of hope around
  which to build. If she could only clasp to her breast this humble spirit!
  Time, days and days, would be her ally.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was getting along into August, with touches of color beginning to show
  on the hills. Stewart advised Madge that if she was contemplating a camping
  trip up in the Peloncillos not to waste any more time. And she confided that
  she was pretty sure that would fall through. Snake Elwell had to return to
  college soon for fall practice; Allie had planned to motor east with her
  parents; and the rest of the party were beginning to think of the city.
  Nevertheless they were enthusiastic over the prospect of that horseback
  ride.</p>

  <p>It chanced that Madge&rsquo;s wish to see Sidway and Starr upon their
  return, before any of her friends, was denied her, much to her concern. She
  had been alone with her mother when word came up from below that the boys
  were in. Madge rushed out the patio way and down the trail. A confusion of
  bright colors decorating Nels&rsquo; porch attested to the whereabouts of the
  girls, and where they were the boys would be also. It was a good long run,
  and Madge had to halt to catch her breath before she half crossed the square.
  The horses had just been unloaded from the trucks, and the packs thrown out.
  Ren was surrounded by her excited friends who were evidently besieging him in
  unison. Sidway stood a little apart, conversing with Nels and her father. The
  <i>vaqueros</i> were attending to the horses. Umpqua nickered at Madge, and
  she flew to stroke his dusty neck, while he nosed at her for sugar. She had
  never ridden him since that first day, but she had won his affection, and she
  felt a sense of guilt to look up and see Sidway&rsquo;s piercing eyes upon
  her. Ragged and dark, dusty and unshaved, he appealed so powerfully to Madge
  that as she approached them she wondered how she could hide it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, they won&rsquo;t say a darn thing,&rdquo; burst out
  Maramee, and the others chimed in with gay sallies.</p>

  <p>At last Madge reached them, and with a hand on Stewart&rsquo;s arm, she
  faced Sidway, and the grinning Starr. She was keen to feel something proven
  in them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys&mdash;it took you&mdash;long enough,&rdquo; she panted, and
  smiled upon them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Miss Majesty, you gave us all the time there was,&rdquo;
  replied Ren.</p>

  <p>Sidway&rsquo;s hazel eyes, dark and intent, appeared to pierce through
  Madge. Not for weeks had she met his full gaze like this, and despite the
  scattering of her wits, she realized the searching nature of his look, as if
  he were striving to divine her wishes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, it was well you sent us,&rdquo; said Sidway, simply.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it spared you and your friends a real
  ordeal!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A groan ran through the listening party.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Real ordeal! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too severe a physical strain for tenderfeet. A motion-picture crowd
  would shy at this one&mdash;and they do things.... But it can be done, Miss
  Stewart, and I&rsquo;m bound to admit, it&rsquo;d be the trip of a
  lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t advise it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you take the responsibility if I insisted?&rdquo; asked
  Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if your father insisted, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, are you with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daughter, this issue is between you and Sidway. He has not told me
  a thing. My advice is to listen <i>before</i> you make up your mind. You know
  how you are, Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge transfixed Sidway with a troubled passionate gaze. She did not want
  to undertake this trip. She rejoiced that Sidway was making it impossible.
  But there was something about him that dared her to see if she could prevail
  upon him. She realized that until she could conquer such weakness, she would
  never be at her best with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, you&rsquo;re on the spot,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens, when haven&rsquo;t I been?&rdquo; he ejaculated, and
  joined Stewart in a laugh. Their understanding and good feeling seemed
  manifest. Then he bent a glance upon Madge, so clear, so frank, yet so
  supremely doubtful of her, that she writhed inwardly under it. She divined a
  thrust aimed at what must be his conviction of a vulnerable point in her
  which she had no idea she possessed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; she said, with all her disdain, but she felt dismay
  before she had been attacked. This cowboy must know something about her, to
  her discredit, or he could not have affected her that way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may seem superfluous&mdash;to you,&rdquo; he said, coolly.
  &ldquo;But have you considered the expense?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Expense!&rdquo; echoed Madge. That was the last question she would
  have expected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Perhaps you have not thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had not. Usually I don&rsquo;t consider what my plans
  cost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly. That is why I presume to mention it.... This trip would
  cost a great deal. A gang of laborers would be needed on the trail. Two
  weeks&rsquo; work at least. The cabin up at Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold has
  gone to rack and ruin. It would have to be repaired. There are no tents and
  tarpaulins at the ranch, nor cooking utensils. You would require a complete
  new camping equipment. We have packsaddles for only a few horses; and, well,
  would you expect to have this camp on the scale on which you do
  everything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. Then it would be necessary to buy twenty new packsaddles
  and at least ten pack animals. That would entail hiring half a dozen extra
  riders.... So you see, Miss Stewart, it is quite a big
  undertaking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see all right,&rdquo; replied Madge, dubiously. To the credit of
  her friends, they at once turned thumbs down upon the whole proposition, and
  were so nice and fine about it that Madge regretted her subterfuge. But what
  was Lance Sidway aiming at? She believed his report implicitly. A half or a
  quarter of these obstacles would have sufficed. He believed that no matter
  how unfavorable his report or how exorbitantly the trip would cost, she would
  decide to go willy-nilly. Then he believed other things that mystified Madge.
  For an instant she had a bothersome thought that he might feel contempt for
  her because expense had never meant anything to her. A rebellious impulse to
  do the very thing he expected died in its infancy, somehow hastened to its
  death by the singular, almost mocking light in Sidway&rsquo;s hazel eyes. In
  a flash she saw how she could amaze and undeceive him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sidway. I&rsquo;ll abandon the camping trip solely upon
  your report,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have been very conscientious and
  dependable. I appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Lance&rsquo;s scarcely veiled surprise proved Madge&rsquo;s intuition
  close to correct, his relief and gladness, that warmed out the coldness of
  his face, augmented the thought-provoking power of that moment. Madge
  conceived, too, an impression that Sidway&rsquo;s feelings were reflected in
  her father&rsquo;s dark face. Could these two possibly have an understanding?
  Madge drove the perplexing thought away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friends, it&rsquo;s off, our mad ride up into the wilds,&rdquo;
  declared Madge. &ldquo;Some other summer! Instead I&rsquo;ll throw the
  biggest party ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Pandemonium broke out among the boys and girls. When they ceased mobbing
  Madge she suddenly found Sidway towering over her, a stranger to whom her
  whole being seemed to leap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank heaven, I won&rsquo;t have to make a report on
  <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But, come here!&rdquo; And seizing her
  hand he led her aside. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I thought and
  I&rsquo;ll never tell you. Only I&rsquo;m begging you to forgive me. You are
  one swell sport! You&rsquo;re a thoroughbred! It&rsquo;s no
  wonder...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He broke off and squeezed her hand and strode away toward the bunkhouses.
  Madge stood a second, aware of the cramped fingers she could hardly
  straighten, and wondering what were the words he had left unsaid. It was not
  her fault if he had not had a glimpse of all her sides. Madge went back to
  her father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, have you and Lance framed me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;ve had no part in this&mdash;this, whatever
  you&rsquo;d call it,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Honest, Madge. It looked as if
  I might have been in cahoots with Lance to queer your trip. But he never told
  me a thing. Nor did Ren. I think he carried it off very well indeed. Your
  mother will be pleased.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&mdash;What&rsquo;s this Machiavelli mean by pleasing you and
  Mom? Looks like deep stuff to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, he&rsquo;s just a nice boy, who disapproves of you a
  lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, he said some strange things, for him. Nearly crushed my poor
  hand. Look! Then he beat it. He ran off before I could even
  answer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, if this Machiavelli and your dad, or better, old Nels, could
  get you locked in a room and starved or beaten or loved into <i>listening</i>
  for some hours, you&rsquo;d come through like your mother did when she
  decided some momentous questions twenty-five years and more ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad!&mdash;Starved or beaten or.... You are as mysterious as
  <i>he</i>!&rdquo; And Madge judged that the better part of valor would be to
  flee. But not until she had plunged deeply into plans for her party did she
  recover from the confusing thoughts resulting from that surprising contact
  with the cowboy and her father.</p>

  <p>Madge set the date for the party. Invitations were sent to all the range
  people her father knew from Douglas to Bolton. All the <i>vaqueros</i> and
  <i>señoritas</i> known to Bonita and her brothers were invited. It took a
  whole day to put up the decorations. That night when Madge tried out the
  colored lights and lanterns the glamorous effect transported even her. Next
  morning the caterer rolled in with his trucks and minions, and
  Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho hummed like a beehive. Last to arrive were the sixteen
  musicians. That was early in the afternoon. Madge went to bed to rest, but
  she could not sleep. The girls could not even rest. They were in and out all
  afternoon, and finally when Madge asked Allie to get out a new gown none of
  them had ever seen, and which she had reserved for this occasion, there
  ensued a perfectly rapt silence. Bu Allen, of course, broke it. &ldquo;My
  Gawd!&rdquo; she gasped in uncontrollable excitement. &ldquo;Majesty, you
  must be married in that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bu, a girl has to have something beside a gown to get
  married.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that one. You don&rsquo;t even need a slip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so mad were they all that only Madge noted the omission of a man. The
  thing struck a fatalistic chord in her. She had everything&mdash;wonderful
  parents, lovely friends, wealth, education, ranch, horses, cars, all to make
  any girl happy&mdash;except a man to marry.</p>

  <p>But that was the last thing in the world to occupy her mind now. Anyway it
  was a calamity she could remedy this very night, provided she beat down her
  obsession for one unappreciative, unresponsive cowboy. Still it had been
  ingrained in Madge&rsquo;s girlish dreams that no one save a cowboy like her
  father could ever have her.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of that long day Madge slept, and was awakened by Allie and
  Maramee. They informed her that the lights were lit, the many tables set, and
  guests were arriving. Madge sent them off to dress and flew to her bath. She
  was in the midst of her make-up task when they returned, formal and elegant,
  to draw encomiums from Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Girls, we&rsquo;ll knock &rsquo;em for a loop tonight,&rdquo; said
  Madge, gleefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; chirped Maramee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, us,&rdquo; declared Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, I think you mean him,&rdquo; retorted Allie.</p>

  <p>They brushed her hair until it sparkled with glints of fire, and then by
  some magic of deft feminine hands they encased her in the blue and gold gown.
  For jewels Madge wore a string of pearls, the gift of her Aunt Helen, so
  beautiful and valuable that she had not risked it out of the safe for years.
  Allie was silent, gazing raptly at her, but Maramee raved on and on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once in my life!&rdquo; was all Madge whispered to the image
  shining from her long mirror, and either she meant that she was satisfied or
  that she would play that beauty to the limit. Madge went to her
  mother&rsquo;s room, to be admitted. Her father was there, lean and dark and
  handsome in his black suit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mom, but you are a lady of quality!&rdquo; cried Madge, a rush
  of warm sweetness piercing her trance. &ldquo;Dad, isn&rsquo;t she just
  stunning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both her father and mother appeared incapable of speech on the moment, but
  their eyes would have gratified a far vainer girl than Madge. &ldquo;I wanted
  you to see me first.&rdquo; And she whirled for their benefit. &ldquo;Now,
  darlings, this is my party. I&rsquo;ve had it coming to my crowd for a year.
  Unknown to them it is my farewell to them&mdash;to college&mdash;to that kind
  of life. Whatever we do, don&rsquo;t be shocked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And she ran out, through the living room, into the corridor where she
  encountered Sidway. In his dark garb he looked so slim and different that she
  did not recognize him at first glance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;how stupid of me! It&rsquo;s Lance.&rdquo; And she halted
  under the colored lights.</p>

  <p>He started and backed partly against the balustrade, while a dazed and
  frowning expression altered his face. Then it vanished as he leaped erect, to
  utter a queer little laugh and make her a profound bow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance. Do you&mdash;like me?&rdquo; she queried softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, I used to believe you were a mistake of evolution, but now
  I know it was God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that a compliment or a slam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me. I&rsquo;m in urgent search of your father. I just found
  out that the balance of his cattle herd were just rustled. And I&rsquo;m
  going to find out who stole them and where they were driven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lance, how dreadful. But must you tell him tonight?&rdquo;
  wailed Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come to think of it, no,&rdquo; he returned, brightly. &ldquo;I
  haven&rsquo;t even told Ren. Poor kid! It&rsquo;s going tough with him. Love
  is a terrible thing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; agreed Madge, fervently. &ldquo;But <i>you</i>
  have merely heard or read about that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She left him, sailing with a swish down the corridor to her room. She had
  no time to deduce sense from Lance Sidway&rsquo;s queer remarks, and she was
  glad of it. If she spent ten minutes with that cowboy there would be no
  triumph for her tonight. What a devastating effect he exercised over her!
  Some of the girls were in her rooms and the others soon paraded in. Every
  last one of them had on a new gown! And had they planned for this <i>pièce de
  résistance</i> of Madge&rsquo;s? They were interrupted by the caterer, a
  handsome Italian in immaculate white. Madge admitted him and drove out the
  girls. &ldquo;Find the boys. I&rsquo;ll be with you in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you please,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Corvalo, I&rsquo;m bound to be. Remember, serve champagne to my
  party in the living room. Wine to the other tables. As for the punch, it must
  have an awful wallop. But not an immediate kick. Use creme de menthe to
  flavor only&mdash;to make them like it&mdash;leading them on. A soft sweet
  tasty punch&mdash;flowers and music leading to a precipice. Get me,
  Corvalo?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He departed with shining eyes and beaming face, as if that order had been
  one to his liking. Madge went in search of her friends. They had rounded up
  the boys, who looked cool and natty in white flannels. Their various comments
  were incense to Madge&rsquo;s heart. Rollie Stevens said: &ldquo;Murder in
  the Rue Rancho this night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s make the rounds,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;At
  least I can speak to all these strangers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lamping you will be enough,&rdquo; declared Barg.</p>

  <p>Madge found it easier to be courteous and friendly than she had
  anticipated. The delight of the Mexicans especially pleased her. There were
  ranch people she remembered, and apparently all the cowboys on the range.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pack of wolves!&rdquo; averred Rollie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d eat you
  alive. Good thing you&rsquo;re under my wing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure you can be trusted to think of <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The long patio made a colorful and beautiful spectacle. A row of tables
  extended down the center. Benches and chairs lined the walls. The waxed
  floors, built in for the occasion, shone iridescently. Colorful lanterns hung
  from the center of the arches. The gorgeous Spanish and Indian decorations
  lent a richness and legend to the old rancho. Madge slipped a hand over her
  heart to still its beating, its muffled pain. What was this pang stealing
  into her happiness?</p>

  <p>Moments for pondering had passed by. The great dinner gong pealed through
  the corridors and the patio, and was followed by a merry hum. Then the
  orchestra upon which Madge put such store pealed its exotic music through the
  house. It heralded the Spanish <i>fiesta</i> that was to last until dawn.</p>

  <p>Madge, with her college guests, and her father and mother, sat down to
  dinner in the living room. That table from its hothouse orchids, its silver
  plate and crystal, to the rare and savory dishes of the sumptuous dinner,
  excelled anything the ranch had ever known.</p>

  <p>Stewart appeared to be staggered with its magnificence. But as the dinner
  wore on he fell under the spell of his wife&rsquo;s pleasure and
  Madge&rsquo;s rapture, and the continuous merriment and wit of the college
  crowd. Snake Elwell and Bu Allen were the first couple to begin dancing. Bu
  looked ravishing in a white gown that threatened to split at every move.
  Allie, usually the sweetest of girls who never made a criticism or caustic
  comment, spoke right out: &ldquo;Some hot little cookie!&rdquo; And
  Madge&rsquo;s father, who heard it, surrendered unconditionally to this group
  of young moderns.</p>

  <p>Madge&rsquo;s keen eyes did not miss anything. Once she saw Sidway and
  Starr, flushed of face and fire-eyed, peep into the living room. She also
  observed that her father did not drink his champagne. With dinner at an end,
  the dancing set in continuously, with only short intermissions. Madge loved
  to dance, and the first hour passed by on wings. When her crowd happened to
  congregate, someone remembered the punch, whereupon they flocked to the
  living room. The long table had been cleared, and moved back to the wall. In
  the center an enormous bowl of silver and crystal shone resplendent, full of
  a twinkling liquid that had life and color. An attendant stood ready to
  serve. Curious and gleeful, Madge drained her cup, tasted and wondered, and
  listened for comments. She alone knew that innocent-looking punch was loaded
  with dynamite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Madge, where&rsquo;d you hit on this concoction? Pretty
  nifty,&rdquo; observed Rollie Stevens, who considered himself a
  connoisseur.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;New to me, Rollie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soft and minty,&rdquo; interposed Brand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
  it&rsquo;ll lead you on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tame, if you ask me,&rdquo; said Allie, loftily, and that from her
  was a source for mirth. Allie could not stand liquor at all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell punch,&rdquo; observed Elwell. &ldquo;What do you say,
  Bu?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hand me another,&rdquo; replied the redhead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, are you kidding us with this stuff?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Brand. But this is my home, you know. And
  remembering your capacities I wanted something weak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weak or not let&rsquo;s have another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge finally dragged her friends out. While dancing and resting the next
  hour she contrived to keep tabs on that punch bowl. Just as she had
  suspected, her friends were succumbing to this insidious drink. Once with
  Rollie she almost burst in upon her father, Nels, Danny Mains, Starr and
  Sidway, but she drew her escort back behind some decorations in the corridor.
  With intense interest and fiendish glee she watched them and listened,
  holding Rollie back with imperious hand.</p>

  <p>Manifestly this group of gentlemen had been in there before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, we shore lived too soon,&rdquo; drawled Nels,
  regretfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shades of Monty Price and Nick Steel!&rdquo; ejaculated Stewart.
  &ldquo;Nels&mdash;Danny, what would our old pards have thought of this
  drink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd, I dunno.... Fill me up another, waiter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, this heah punch is nectar an&rsquo; honey an&rsquo; hell all
  mixed up together,&rdquo; said Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does the hell come in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed thet until this last drink, which was
  my sixth.... Pard, how many have you had?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; replied Sidway, tragically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you dawg-gone kill-joy! Cain&rsquo;t you hold your
  likker?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, I can&rsquo;t hold this liquor&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t take
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lissen, pard. I&rsquo;m gonna put a couple of these under
  Bonita&rsquo;s belt,&rdquo; whispered Ren, behind Danny Mains&rsquo;
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll lose her right then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpumm! Thet&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll win her. Pard, Bonita is funny
  tonight. Been cryin&rsquo; an&rsquo; turrible upset.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here, you geezer!&rdquo; And Sidway dragged Ren out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, any drink that can make an old man young again is one to tie
  to,&rdquo; said Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I agree with you. But, pards, even if my daughter hadn&rsquo;t
  sprung some destroying drink on us, I&rsquo;d have to get drunk with you for
  old times&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, ole <i>El Capitan</i> again!&rdquo; ejaculated Danny Mains.
  &ldquo;If the ootfit was only heah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge had heard enough to give her a twinge of conscience. But only gay
  and rapturous thoughts could abide in her mind. She went back to dancing.
  Rollie with more drinks than were good for him had begun to grow demanding
  and bossy. Soon came an added interest in Sidway&rsquo;s presence upon the
  floor. He was taller than her college friends, slim and erect in his black
  suit, broad-shouldered, quite the handsomest boy there. He had started in
  dancing with Bonita, and from her to Bu Allen was only a short step. Then he
  cut in on the boys and apparently enjoyed thoroughly her girl friends.
  Naturally she expected him to gravitate to her. But he did not approach her
  or look at her, an omission that did not go unnoticed. It was rude of him,
  Madge thought, as she was his hostess, but it seemed between them there was
  no observance of rules. From that hour Madge&rsquo;s feeling of happiness
  underwent a change. Visits to the punch bowl kept up her spirits. By midnight
  some kind of a climax seemed imminent. Her father and his friends, despite
  their visits to the living room, were still steady on their feet. Stewart
  appeared to have lost his gaiety. Madge saw her mother apparently
  remonstrating with him, to no avail. Thereafter Madge did not see her mother.
  Madge was glad and she hoped her father would retire soon. There would be no
  fights such as Stewart had known in the early days, when he was <i>El
  Capitan</i>, but Madge knew something was bound to happen, and she repented
  now that she had been responsible for it.</p>

  <p>It came in the nature of a surprise. Bu Allen sat down on the floor, a cup
  of punch in her hand, and turned a somersault. She did not spill any liquor.
  The boys and girls howled at the sight. Thus encouraged, she turned
  somersaults all across the living room. Nels and Danny Mains were in
  hysterics; Ren Starr whooped like the cowboy he was; Sidway strode out of the
  room. Stewart, his face like a thundercloud, threw up his hands like a man
  who had been vainly fighting facts, and lunged out into the patio.</p>

  <p>Madge, frightened at the lightning of his eyes, watched him disappear with
  a sinking of her heart. Had she gone too far? But she had not known Beulah
  Allen would disgrace her party. And if Snake Elwell had not violently jerked
  the girl to her feet and dragged her out Madge felt that she would have had
  to adopt extreme measures. That event saw the disintegration of the party.
  The dancing grew desultory, except in the patio where the range guests still
  held forth.</p>

  <p>Finding Barg and Maramee asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms in a corner,
  and some of the other couples fading from the living room to the benches,
  Madge realized her party was about over. And it had been a failure. She knew
  when she had had enough to drink. But in her bitterness, she overstepped her
  habit. With Rollie she drank two more cups of punch. And as she went outdoors
  with him, wrapping a mantle around her bare shoulders she realized two
  things&mdash;that Rollie was pretty drunk and that a gaiety had overcome her
  gloom. Good to have the blue devils fade away! Lance Sidway had not come near
  her! To hell with him! Rollie was a pal, and on the way out under the pines,
  Madge not only permitted his extravagant embraces but returned his kisses.
  She felt just on the verge of being giddy and dizzy. But she did not want to
  think. After all she could do worse than marry Rollie Stevens.</p>

  <p>In an open space, shaded by spreading pines and surrounded by low foliage,
  they found a bench covered with blanket and pillows. The moonlight streaked
  through rifts in the branches to lend a silver glamour to the glade. Rollie
  sat down and drew Madge upon his lap. At first she felt silly and soft at his
  love-making, and experienced a pleasant glow of excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to marry me,&rdquo; he said, thickly, between
  kisses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that so? Who told you?&rdquo; laughed Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; he replied, more violently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, you&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I am it&rsquo;s your fault.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You all fell for that punch. My secret, Rollie!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?... Your line, Madge&mdash;secrets! I&rsquo;ll give you
  another one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The edge on his voice, accompanying some rough handling of her awakened
  Madge to the situation. But her lackadaisical good nature was such that she
  made only feeble resistance to his ardor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You love me&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he demanded fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I love you&mdash;Rollie&mdash;as a pal&mdash;old
  friend, and what have you?... but...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nuts! I&rsquo;m tired of that dope.&rdquo; And the hot kisses upon
  her mouth and neck grew more violent. Madge was no longer returning his
  kisses. From that to remonstrating with him was only a short step. It
  appeared to inflame him. Locked in his arms she was at a disadvantage. A
  rattling of her pearls alarmed her. The fool would break the necklace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me&mdash;go!... You&rsquo;re drunk&mdash;boy.... this is
  ...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;re you&mdash;drunk,&rdquo; he panted, and pushed her back
  off his lap upon the cushions. Madge&rsquo;s utterance was stifled by his
  kisses. She twisted her face away. But Rollie only grew more violent.</p>

  <p>Furiously she flung him aside, and sprang off the bench. In the dark she
  fell over someone she took to be Rollie and had to clutch his arm to regain
  her balance. He appeared to be sitting against a tree trunk. But there at the
  end of the bench was Rollie, mumbling and cursing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;What?&mdash;<i>Who?</i>&rdquo; screamed Madge, leaning
  forward on her knees to peer at this man she had fallen against. He had his
  hands over his eyes and ears. They fell, and Madge recognized Lance
  Sidway.</p>

  <p>She managed to arise despite a paralyzing dismay, that gave place to a
  terrific shame and rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You!</i>&rdquo; burst out Madge.</p>

  <p>He rose rather slowly and pulled himself erect. A slant of moonlight fell
  across his face. It was ashen white, and out of it glittered eyes as black as
  coal and as sharp as daggers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s me. Who else in hell could have such rotten
  luck?&rdquo; he returned, with exceeding bitterness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway! you waylaid me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself,&rdquo; he flashed, hotly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d left your drunken outfit. On the way to my lodgings, I
  stopped here to&mdash;to smoke. But after I&rsquo;d finished, I lingered,
  like the sap I am. I saw you coming and made sure you&rsquo;d pass. But you
  didn&rsquo;t. Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you lie! And you laugh at me!&rdquo; exclaimed Madge, beside
  herself with rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve
  the laugh on you, Madge Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rollie had clambered up, hanging to the bench, evidently more than ever
  under the influence of liquor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whosis?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, it&rsquo;s Lance Sidway. He was sitting here all the
  time,&rdquo; declared Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That cowboy cad? Conceited jackass!... Look here, sir, you spy on
  <i>me</i>. I&rsquo;ll cane the hide off you,&rdquo; shouted Stevens, and he
  struck openhanded at Sidway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep your hands off me,&rdquo; ordered the cowboy, shoving him
  back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. But I wasn&rsquo;t to blame. I didn&rsquo;t spy
  on you. You get that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar, Sidway. You&rsquo;re always spying on Madge.
  You&rsquo;re stuck on her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway jerked as if he had been stung. &ldquo;Stevens, if I were you,
  I&rsquo;d be a gentleman about it, which you&rsquo;re not. I wouldn&rsquo;t
  try to take advantage of her when she was drunk. Somebody ought to beat you
  good. And by God, <i>I</i> will, if you don&rsquo;t let me out of
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rollie lunged at Sidway who avoided him, backing against the bench.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him alone, Rollie. You&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; cried Madge.</p>

  <p>Sidway had no recourse but to stave off Stevens&rsquo; blows. Finally a
  hearty slap in the face changed the cowboy&rsquo;s tactics. He seized Stevens
  by the arms and shook him violently. Then he shoved him back. &ldquo;Stevens,
  I warn you. Lay off me, or I&rsquo;ll sock you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d shoot you if I had a gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if my back were turned. You&rsquo;re one swell flop, Stevens.
  ... Stay away from me, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, get away from the fool!&rdquo; implored Madge, who was if
  anything more infuriated with Stevens than Sidway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure, you would ask that. Me run, to save this guy&rsquo;s
  face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might save my good name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t save a rotten egg, Madge Stewart. I tell you
  I&rsquo;m the insulted one here and I&rsquo;m getting sore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Stevens belligerently confronted Sidway again, it was to meet no
  resistance. The cowboy stood motionless in the moonlight, his arms lowered.
  But to Madge he looked formidable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;insufferable cow hand!&rdquo; shouted Stevens, furiously
  and he struck Lance twice in the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, Rollie. Now let&rsquo;s see if you can take it,&rdquo;
  rejoined Sidway, grimly, and he swung hard on the collegian. The blow sounded
  solid, meaty, and Stevens went down with a thud and did not move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There! Sorry to mess up your lover, Miss Stewart, but as you saw, I
  couldn&rsquo;t avoid it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He lies so still... he&rsquo;s so white,&rdquo; cried Madge, in
  alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope the sucker croaks,&rdquo; rejoined Sidway, brutally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you might hunt up your dad and Nels, tell them what this guy
  tried to do to you&mdash;and watch them hang him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a beast you are, Lance Sidway! It was bad enough to sit there,
  like a cheap eavesdropper, and listen, let alone...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! I tell you I&rsquo;m innocent. I didn&rsquo;t look. I
  didn&rsquo;t listen&mdash;at least until you got so raw in your
  love-making...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you should have made your presence known at once,&rdquo; cried
  Madge, poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;m damn sorry. But I was scared, confused... It
  wasn&rsquo;t easy&mdash;for me&mdash;Madge Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He choked over the last utterance, and gazed down upon her with eyes of
  terrible reproach, which might have softened Madge but for her own
  insupportable emotions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse for a gentleman,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! But for God&rsquo;s sake, do you think you were a
  lady?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance Sidway, I <i>was</i> and I <i>am</i>!&rdquo; she rejoined,
  imperiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a poor, miserable, crawling louse!&rdquo; he
  ejaculated, in desperation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I regard the appellation as fairly felicitous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re Majesty Stewart, a law unto herself, a lady of
  quality, a princess who can do no wrong?&rdquo; he burst out, passionately.
  &ldquo;Listen, you!&mdash;That college bum there was not drunk. But his
  decency, if he had any, was gone. And you were not drunk, either, but your
  dad would have despised you if he had been here in my boots.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie forgot himself&mdash;I confess... But I
  didn&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah! Why, for a real man you&rsquo;d have been a push-over,&rdquo;
  retorted Sidway, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Madge slapped him viciously across the lips. The next instant his open
  hand cracked along her cheek and head, and but for the bench would have upset
  her. Nevertheless, almost blinded by stars and shock, Madge slapped him
  again, with all her might.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Regular cat, eh?&rdquo; he burst out, huskily. &ldquo;But you
  can&rsquo;t make a dog out of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;have&mdash;to...&rdquo; panted Madge.</p>

  <p>He seized her in powerful hands, hard and hot, and dragged her into a ray
  of moonlight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty&mdash;what a travesty that name is!&mdash;Madge Stewart,
  you&rsquo;re going to hear the truth once in your life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was suddenly so strangely different, so grimly righteous and ruthless,
  so white and fire-eyed that Madge sustained a sinking of her heart. She tried
  to retort with some further insult, but failed of coherence. He shook her as
  he had shaken Stevens.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty Stewart! One swell girl, they all think. Proud,
  blue-blooded, rich. What a mistake! Why you are as false as hell. It was
  low-down enough before I caught you tonight. Thank God it was I instead of
  your dad who caught you. He&rsquo;s had enough of you to stand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, what do you&mdash;mean?&rdquo; whispered Madge, and
  slipping out of his nerveless grasp she sank upon the bench.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean your splendid father and your loving mother are too damn
  good for you, Madge Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, I&mdash;I know that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve put them
  through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Not&mdash;not money trouble?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, money!&rdquo; he bit out, bending over her.</p>

  <p>Madge moaned. This it was then that had vaguely haunted her, the
  conscience which she would not face. She felt it in this man&rsquo;s
  intensity, in the bitterness of his voice, the fire of contempt in his eyes.
  This something had given him power over her, and her spirit seemed to be
  fainting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fate that I have to tell you this,&rdquo; he went on,
  swiftly. &ldquo;Your dad gave me his books to straighten out. He did not know
  that in the book he had left your bank statements, checks and what not. I
  went over these, too. And that is how I learned of your rotten extravagance
  and the way your parents have ruined themselves for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i> Lance!&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t!</i> You
  are furious with me. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t blame you. But for mercy&rsquo;s
  sake, don&rsquo;t say any more...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, girl, I couldn&rsquo;t say enough,&rdquo; he interrupted,
  adamant to the piteous fear in her appeal. &ldquo;I love your dad. He makes
  me remember my own father. And your mother&mdash;how sweet and loving and
  thoroughbred!&mdash;All for Majesty. That has been the whole story of this
  ranch.... Madge Stewart, you&rsquo;re not rich. You have no income any more.
  Three years ago it flopped. And these parents of yours have let you go on,
  spending like a drunken sailor, deceiving yourself, sacrificing them for your
  college career, your clothes and cars, your cocktail dates with
  gangsters&mdash;My God! that is the limit.... And this party of yours, Miss
  Stewart, this rare and exotic <i>fiesta</i> to your glory&mdash;you have
  pulled it when you were broke. And your dad rounded up the last of his cattle
  to sell&mdash;to cover your debts... And tonight when the whole country was
  doing you honor, dancing to your jazz, drinking your wines and
  punch&mdash;that last herd was rustled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge sank down to hide her face in the pillows. The blow had fallen. And
  of all blows it was the mortal one which could crush her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, angel-face,&rdquo; whispered Sidway, almost spent,
  &ldquo;your father is ruined&mdash;and who&rsquo;ll pay for this party? Would
  you like Nels and Ren and me to chip in our savings....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge stretched out a shaking importunate hand that silenced him. And it
  seemed amidst the knell of pride and happiness that had fallen in ruins about
  her, she heard Sidway&rsquo;s swift footfalls fading away.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">HALFWAY down the slope Lance halted in his blind hurry. The
  Spanish music floated softly on the still air; the moon soared pitilessly
  white. What was it that he had done? He sat down under a pine and battled
  with his conflicting emotions.</p>

  <p>Brutally he had made impossible any longer stay at Stewart&rsquo;s ranch.
  That long-deferred break seemed an unutterable and immense relief. But his
  conscience flayed him. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he whispered, huskily.
  &ldquo;Why do I feel this&mdash;this.... It was&mdash;coming to her!&rdquo;
  He was glad that he had had the courage to tell her. If she had a grain of
  good in her the truth would bring it out. Then why this stab in his heart,
  this clamor of furies in his ears, this still small voice? He would have
  wanted to tell her like an impassive destiny, letting the iron consequences
  fall. And he had sunk to the level of a man like Uhl. Perhaps even that
  philanderer would have been more of a gentleman. Lance struck the low of
  misery.</p>

  <p>Then attending to his smarting lip he found it cut and bleeding. How about
  that? And the stinging blows might as well have been re-enacted. He had
  struck her, a hard openhanded slap that had staggered her. Suddenly it all
  flashed clear. Jealousy had been at the root of that incredible passion.
  Loving Madge Stewart to distraction, his damnable fate had been to be
  compelled to cower there in the shadow, seeing, hearing the kisses she had
  lavished on that college fellow. Lance tried to blot out the sight. That had
  seemed a sickening mortal blow, but it was his vile speech to her that stuck
  like a hot blade in his side&mdash;the jealous false word for which she had
  struck him across the lips. At last Lance uncovered the real trouble.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rotten of me!&rdquo; he muttered, under his breath. &ldquo;My God,
  how terrible she made me feel!... But even half drunk she could take care of
  herself. I saw that. Yet I... Jealousy made me low-down. If she had been
  kissing <i>me</i>... it would have been heaven. A tough spot for Lance
  Sidway!... Well, Madge, whatever else you are, you&rsquo;re
  straight&mdash;and I can climb out of hell on that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance stood up, shivering a little at the cool air and the indifferent
  stars. This was the end of his secret love affair. And there would never be
  another, he was certain. It did not seem possible that any man, much less he,
  could see Madge Stewart as he had seen her, and carry her in his arms, and
  kiss her with such abandon, and then fall in love with another woman.</p>

  <p>Lance strode down to the bunkhouse, his mind trying to take up the threads
  of the information he had forced from Bonita. There was a light in
  Nels&rsquo; cabin. Lance&rsquo;s watch said that morning was less than an
  hour away. He burst in upon the old cattleman, who was in the act of
  undressing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, are you sober?&rdquo; demanded Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, son, what&rsquo;s ailin&rsquo; you&mdash;all white an&rsquo;
  eyes aburnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell to pay, Nels. Are you sober enough to get me
  straight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sober?&mdash;Dog-gone! I don&rsquo;t know. Thet shore was some
  punch. I jest couldn&rsquo;t stop drinkin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell drink, all right. What&rsquo;d it do to Danny and Ren and
  Stewart?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, they cleaned oot the bowl. Gene said it was an act of charity
  on their part. <i>He</i> was sober. Gene used to hold more bad likker than
  any man on the range. But Danny an&rsquo; Ren were lit up some.... Say, what
  you got on yore chest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Plenty! Now, listen. Pack me some biscuits, meat, dried
  apples&mdash;anything you can dig up pronto. Put it in a saddlebag.
  I&rsquo;ll wrangle my horse. And you be sure you sober up while I&rsquo;m
  gone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I reckon I savvy,&rdquo; drawled Nels.</p>

  <p>Lance went into his cabin, and hastily changed into his riding garb,
  buckled on his gunbelt, and hurried out, to jerk a bridle off a peg on the
  porch. The night before, because of the strange horses that had arrived,
  Lance had put Umpqua in the barn. The moment Lance&rsquo;s step sounded on
  the runway, Umpqua nickered, and stamped his hoofs. Lance looped the bridle
  round his neck, led him out, and filling a nosebag with grain, he put that
  over Umpqua&rsquo;s head. Then leading the horse he hurried back to
  Nels&rsquo; cabin. There he saddled Umpqua, but left the cinch loose. He
  decided before seeing Nels to go into his cabin thinking hard what to take.
  It was necessary to light the lamp. A blanket, his fleece-lined coat, his
  rifle and some shells, his gloves, money and matches&mdash;these he thought
  would be about all. Then he remembered Madge&rsquo;s photograph. He would
  take that, for the chances were against his returning, or ever seeing her
  again. Fortunately the picture fit inside his coat pocket. He wrapped it in a
  silk scarf and carefully put it away. Funny, he thought, if a rustler&rsquo;s
  bullet pierced that lovely likeness of Majesty Stewart before it pierced his
  heart! But even so it could not hurt any more than she had hurt him. Then he
  extinguished the lamp and went out. The east was breaking gray. Dawn was not
  far off.</p>

  <p>Umpqua was pitching the nosebag to get the last of the grain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, come out,&rdquo; he called.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah I am. Been waitin&rsquo;, son, kinda worried.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Nels,&rdquo; replied Lance, receiving the saddlebags.
  &ldquo;Nothing to worry about&mdash;much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Wal, you act kinda queer. I&rsquo;ve spent my life with range
  fellers. An&rsquo; if you&rsquo;re not drunk on thet punch, you&rsquo;re
  shore drunk on somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeh? Well, what, old wiz?&rdquo; rejoined Lance, his swift hands at
  work over the saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Gee, Nels, you&rsquo;re keen. I rather snicker to snort that I
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; on account of Majesty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, on account of Majesty!&rdquo; ejaculated Lance,
  flippantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&mdash;Did you quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look where she split my lip. That little lady has a
  sock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, don&rsquo;t tell me she&mdash;she hit you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world she did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in Gawd&rsquo;s name for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, it&rsquo;s too long a story. I deserved it and I took
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, you&rsquo;re uncommon bitter.... I don&rsquo;t mind
  admittin&rsquo; thet I had it figgered you&mdash;you was in love with
  Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, damn your lunatic hide!&rdquo; burst out Lance. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t mind admitting!&mdash;Say, you lying old matchmaker, you&rsquo;ve
  been driving me nuts! You haven&rsquo;t given me any peace for weeks. You
  wouldn&rsquo;t even let me sleep. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t I kinda in love with
  Majesty? She shore is sweet on you!&rsquo;... What kind of talk!&mdash;Now,
  listen, for once, for good and all. &lsquo;Kinda in love with Majesty?&rsquo;
  Ha! Ha! Ha!... I love that good-for-nothing angel so terribly I&rsquo;m dying
  for her. Do you get that? I&rsquo;m stark staring mad about her. I&rsquo;d
  shoot myself if I hung around here any longer. So I&rsquo;m beating it. Now,
  take a load of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, it&rsquo;ll be the turriblest mistake if you run off
  now,&rdquo; replied Nels, awed and moved. &ldquo;Fer Majesty&rsquo;s jest as
  turrible in love...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Skip it. You&rsquo;re balmy. You&rsquo;re nuts. You&rsquo;re
  crazy,&rdquo; retorted Lance, wrenching the words out. It was insupportable
  to listen to such raving from this simple old man. &ldquo;Listen to this. All
  the cattle Stewart had left were rustled last night, right after dark. Must
  have been rounded up in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; roared Nels, changing magically.
  &ldquo;Why&rsquo;n&rsquo;hell didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your darling Madge begged me to keep it till tomorrow. Well,
  that&rsquo;s today.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bonita.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. How&rsquo;d you drag thet oot of her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I threw a couple of those punches into her, danced with her, took
  her out. Well, she spilled the beans, on conditions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What conditions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind them, Nels. I won&rsquo;t tell you. And you&rsquo;re not
  to give Bonita away to Stewart or Ren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! You cain&rsquo;t fool them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not important. The cattle have been rustled by
  <i>vaqueros</i>. Bound across the border. By the Gray Ridge Divide.
  Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thet long gray hill southeast of heah. Aboot ten miles,
  closest. Separates the range from the foothills of the Peloncillos.
  There&rsquo;s a cattle trail straight down the valley across the border.
  Rustlers used it years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stewart&rsquo;s cattle ought to be around that divide by
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, an&rsquo; then some. What&rsquo;s yore idee, son?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. But don&rsquo;t let yourself be seen from the ridge top.
  Those rustlers will figger thet the cattle won&rsquo;t be missed right off.
  But they&rsquo;ve got sharp eyes. With two days&rsquo; start they&rsquo;d
  aboot get acrost before we could haid them off.... I&rsquo;ll get Stewart
  an&rsquo; Danny, an&rsquo; Starr drunk or sober, an&rsquo; hit this cattle
  trail. Meanwhile you locate the rustlers, then ride on in to town.
  Don&rsquo;t lose no time gettin&rsquo; an ootfit of cowboys&mdash;or any land
  of a posse, an&rsquo; ride hell fer leather to haid these greasers
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Use my own judgment as to where I&rsquo;ll cross the
  ridge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. But if you&rsquo;re smart an&rsquo; lucky you can cross by
  the Cochise Trail. Only don&rsquo;t ride down into thet valley onless
  you&rsquo;re ahaid of the rustlers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, Nels. I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; replied Lance. &ldquo;Nels,
  that outfit might get suspicious or something, and hit up the Cochise Trail.
  Tell Gene and Ren to look for my tracks on that trail, crossing the
  valley.&rdquo; Then vaulting astride he rode across the square, down by the
  sleeping village, out upon the shadowy gray range. It was almost daybreak
  when he struck the wash. By the time a ruddy light showed over the dark
  mountain barrier Lance had struck the fresh cattle track. It crossed the
  highway and headed straight for the low slant of gray that marked the
  northern end of Gray Ridge Divide. Satisfied and thrilled, Lance swerved off
  the trail to make a short cut, intending to climb the ridge ten miles or so
  toward the south. It was then only that his mind reverted to the tragedy of
  his leaving. Madge haunted him, her lovely face white and tragic, her big
  eyes, and most of all, after he had told her that she had ruined her father,
  the way she sank down, crushed by amaze and shame. Lastly that imploring
  hand, mute appeal for mercy. Would she like him and Nels and Ren to donate
  their wages?&mdash;those had been his last words. Too late! Lance writhed in
  his saddle. As the dawn slowly flamed to a glorious sunrise and the broad
  daylight drove away his morbid thoughts, he could not understand how he had
  been so base. He felt that he would be driven to go back to the ranch and
  explain to Madge how his jealousy and passion had made him a coward and a
  cad. That would be a betrayal of his love, a refuting of all his scorn. As he
  rode along, his brooding self-reproach and remorse augmented his error and
  mitigated Madge&rsquo;s faults. If it turned out that he was to be the means
  of saving her father&rsquo;s cattle, and perhaps getting himself shot in
  Madge&rsquo;s interest, that would be all right with him, if only she could
  know of his repentance.</p>

  <p>Lance crossed the valley obliquely and headed up the ridge about five
  miles south of the point. The sun was high in the heavens when he gained the
  summit. He took care not to show his horse or himself on top of the ridge.
  There were rocks and scrub cedars all along, affording good cover. Lance
  dismounted to reconnoiter. He had to walk a long way north on the ridge
  before he discovered the cattle. They had been driven into the head of the
  narrow valley between the foothills and the ridge, and were grazing. The
  distance was not quite too far to distinguish horses and riders, but Lance
  had to wait a good while before he made sure he saw them. They should have
  traveled down the valley to a point almost equal with his position. Lance
  lingered there until he saw the herd move down the valley toward him. Then he
  retraced his steps.</p>

  <p><i>Vaqueros</i> had almost as keen eyesight as Indians. But if these
  rustlers had anticipated immediate pursuit they would not have traveled so
  leisurely during the night. They had probably calculated upon the cowboys and
  riders sleeping all this day after the excitement and disturbance of the
  <i>señorita&rsquo;s fiesta</i>. The raid would not be discovered for several
  days, which would give the thieves time to get across the border. It was a
  clever and nicely timed move on their part.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the spot where he had left his horse, Lance sent a keen gaze
  back across the valley toward the ranch. He espied puffs of dust some miles
  out from the highway, about on a line with the cattle trail. He concluded
  Gene and his riders were in pursuit of the rustlers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; soliloquized Lance, with satisfaction. &ldquo;Pretty
  lucky for me to worm this out of Bonita. Poor kid! All to save her
  good-for-nothing brother! Well, I&rsquo;ll keep my word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance mounted and rode along a rough summit trail, which Umpqua had to
  walk. Lance calculated that he was forty miles from the highway, and close to
  forty from town. The hour was short of midmorning. He had all the rest of
  that day, and longer, if need be, to carry out Nels&rsquo; instructions.
  Recovery of the cattle looked easy to Lance. He tried to conjecture
  unforeseen circumstances. If the <i>vaqueros</i> discovered they were being
  pursued they would take to the foothills and escape. Lance eyed those
  formidable hills, rising and swelling gradually to the rough black summits of
  the Peloncillos.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My best bet is to go down to the range and look for a cattle outfit
  between here and town,&rdquo; Lance told himself, and after thinking of every
  angle possible he decided to put his idea into effect. There were several
  ranches along that slope of the ridge, and he might be fortunate enough to
  meet some riders. To this end Lance headed down the slope.</p>

  <p>Lance had enough on his mind to make the miles and hours seem short.
  Umpqua walked and trotted under the hot sun. As long as he had soft ground to
  travel on he would not tire. Late in the afternoon Lance arrived at the last
  ranch along the ridge, and ascertained that an outfit of cowboys had left not
  long before to round up some cattle south of Bolton. This was good luck,
  indeed, and Lance set off with high hopes. These riders would very likely
  camp outside of Bolton.</p>

  <p>It was sunset when Lance caught up with a trio of cowboys leading three
  pack horses, and half a dozen extra mounts. Lance joined them with a greeting
  and pulled Umpqua to a walk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; returned a lean towheaded rider, fastening
  penetrating eyes upon Lance. &ldquo;I seen you coming &rsquo;way back. Jest
  about in a hurry, wasn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say. You&rsquo;re the Bar X boys from Spencer&rsquo;s
  ranch, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;re some of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sidway, riding for Gene Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckoned you was. My handle&rsquo;s Tim Sloan, an&rsquo; my pards
  are brothers, sons of Spencer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your boss told me you were bound south of Bolton to round up some
  of his cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We air, if we can locate them. But I reckon they&rsquo;re rustled
  across the border. Some two-bit outfit been workin&rsquo; the edges of the
  range lately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance lost no time accounting for his presence, and the lean rider was so
  interested that he reined his horse, and halted the cavalcade in the middle
  of the road. &ldquo;Hell you say!&mdash;Boys, you hear thet?... How far back
  air these raiders with Stewart&rsquo;s cattle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over the ridge in the valley, halfway at the least.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when was it you sighted them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This morning around ten. Stewart will be behind them, keeping out
  of sight. And it&rsquo;s my job to get some riders to head them off from this
  end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re with you, Sidway.... Boys, like as not this same outfit
  has been runnin&rsquo; off our stock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Purty shore, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; replied one of the brothers.
  &ldquo;But we&rsquo;d help you out if there wasn&rsquo;t a chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, fellows. I&rsquo;m relieved.... And now, Sloan, what do you
  advise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, them stolen cattle won&rsquo;t get nowhere near this end of
  the valley tonight. My idee is to camp here outside of town, an&rsquo; be off
  before daylight in the mawnin&rsquo;. How&rsquo;s thet suit you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. It&rsquo;s just going to work out great.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before dusk settled down the riders halted just on the edge of Bolton near
  a clump of trees Lance remembered having passed on the trip to the
  Peloncillos.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sloan, will we eat in town?&rdquo; queried Lance, as he
  dismounted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Boss won&rsquo;t stand for thet. We&rsquo;ll throw up some grub
  here. But we&rsquo;re out of coffee an&rsquo; butter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy some. Do you think I ought to notify the
  sheriff?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no. This deal is a cinch, an&rsquo; thet old geezer would hawg
  all the credit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance strode off into town, his mind thronged with thoughts. He seemed on
  the verge of an adventure much to his liking. Stewart and Nels were sure to
  like him better than ever. And proud, wild, volcanic Madge Stewart would
  surely be indebted to him, whether or not she ever confessed it. Lance had a
  desire to telephone the ranch. At that hour, with Stewart and his men absent,
  it was ten to one that Madge would answer. How coolly he could make his
  report, not omitting subtly to augment the dangers! Did that violet-eyed girl
  have a heart? Lance had to admit that she had, but he had never touched it.
  His bitter and final resolve of last night still held, yet he was conscious
  of a rending of spirit at the thought of keeping it, and leaving
  Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho forever.</p>

  <p>At Smith&rsquo;s Store on the highway Lance purchased butter and coffee,
  and several cakes of hard chocolate, one of which he put in his pocket. While
  the clerk was wrapping Lance&rsquo;s purchases the proprietor accosted
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Sidway, when did you leave the ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before daylight this morning. Rode down the ridge looking for
  cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know Stewart&rsquo;s phone is out of
  connection? I suspect it has been cut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, something&rsquo;s wrong. This morning Mrs. Stewart phoned in
  an order. I expected some things she wanted by express, so did not call until
  after they arrived. Then I couldn&rsquo;t get an answer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not strange. One of the old telephone poles may have
  toppled over,&rdquo; replied Lance, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it might, but it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Smith,
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mike Scanlon was in not ten minutes ago. He&rsquo;d been out for a
  load of dead aspen wood. He said that when he was cuttin&rsquo; it, out there
  along the creek, he saw a big black car dustin&rsquo; along toward town
  hell-bent fer election. An&rsquo; it stopped down the road eight or ten
  miles. Mike forgot about thet until he got near to the highway. Then he
  tangled up in a wire thet turned out to be Stewart&rsquo;s. It had fallen
  across the road. Hadn&rsquo;t been cut long, for Mike saw the bright end,
  where it had been clipped. He thought somebody in thet big black car had done
  it. Not half an hour ago! Damn queer, don&rsquo;t you call it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does this Mike Scanlon live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up at the end of town, on the other side of the highway. Ask Meade,
  the garage man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance, hurrying along past the bright red and yellow lights, pondered this
  news. It clamped down upon him with a presagement far out of proportion to
  probabilities. Apparently Stewart&rsquo;s telephone wire had not been cut
  until late in the day. That seemed to preclude any possibility of the
  rustlers being accountable. A big black car! Lance wanted to talk to Mike
  Scanlon about that car.</p>

  <p>He passed the last bright neon lights. Meade&rsquo;s garage appeared to be
  deserted. Just at that moment a big black car, with headlights dark, moved
  slowly down the back road. Lance wanted a look at that car. It was strangely
  familiar in line and build. He swerved off the highway, crossed the open
  space to the back road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi there. Hold up,&rdquo; he called boldly. Manifestly the driver
  heard him for the car came to a halt. The street lamp behind Lance caught the
  gleaming faces of men in the front seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stick &rsquo;em up, cowboy!&rdquo; cut the air with deadly menace.
  As Lance threw up his hands he recognized that voice. It belonged with the
  car.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, Uhl. Up&mdash;they are,&rdquo; he replied quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come close.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance walked to the automobile halting abreast of the front seat. Uhl had
  his hand in his coat pocket and he was leaning over the door. Lance knew that
  he faced a concealed gun and that he had to think quickly and right. Uhl was
  bareheaded. His clean-cut visage shone pale and cold in the light. The driver
  hunched down over the wheel, as if ready to race. The engine purred. Then
  Lance caught the gleam of a machine gun on the lap of a man in the back seat.
  Between him and another man shrank a girl with face as white as chalk and
  great dark eyes. Lance recognized her with a terrific stop of his heart. For
  an instant he seemed to reel dizzily, then the cold sickening freeze of his
  very marrow quickened to a hot gush of blood, and his faculties cleared to a
  magnified intensity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you&rsquo;ve been here on Cork&rsquo;s snatch
  racket?&rdquo; queried Uhl, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What held him up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We beat him to it! Who wised you and why&rsquo;re you looking for
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Want to tip you off. You cut the wire too late. Sheriff here has
  blocked you as far west as Tucson and as far east as El Paso. Posse down the
  road waiting to blow your tires into smithereens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl burst into vehement curses: &ldquo;Raggy, &mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;&mdash; your dumb soul! You &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;&mdash; hop-head! I ought to bump you off for that loss of time back
  there.... What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot our way through,&rdquo; rasped the driver.</p>

  <p>Lance interrupted in ringing low voice: &ldquo;Might be okay for Bolton
  but points farther on the highway will be blocked. No chance in a million.
  Just as bad east. The wires are hot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fox, what&rsquo;s the dope?&rdquo; flashed the leader.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you asking me?&rdquo; curtly retorted one of the men in the
  back. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I warn you against this racket? I advise hiding
  along the railroad track and hopping a freight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fox. You&rsquo;re a rabbit.... Cowboy, what&rsquo;s
  your tip?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beat it for the hills pronto,&rdquo; exclaimed Lance, hurriedly.
  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get through this town by car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hills!... I get it. But horses, food, blankets&mdash;where can they
  be found?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy outfit just out of town. You can buy what you need from them
  and be on the trail in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. Where&rsquo;ll we go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up in the Peloncillos. Rough wild country. You couldn&rsquo;t be
  tracked. You can hide for days. As soon as you get your dough you can ride
  down across the border into Mexico.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good tip, cowboy. What about this bus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send your driver on the ridge road. Give him water and grub. When
  morning comes he can drive off the road into the cedars beyond the point. And
  hide there. He could get out later.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oke. Will you guide us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. If you slip me enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl&rsquo;s gun gave out a metallic clink as he drew his coat over the
  door. Producing a roll of bills he handed one to Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a grand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make it two, Uhl. And promise of more if I get you through,&rdquo;
  demanded Lance, lowering his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, you chiseler. Jump on the running board and tell the driver
  where to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance ran around to the other side of the car and caught on. He directed
  the driver down the road and away from the town. A campfire blazed among the
  trees. In a reaction of feeling Lance could scarcely hold on. He imagined he
  was in a dreadful nightmare. But the car was moving. In the back he saw a
  gangster on this side with a machine gun across his knees, the same as the
  other. And on the floor lay another man. Lance puzzled over that. By sheer
  luck and wit he had met a tremendous situation. Anything to keep Uhl from
  carrying Madge off to the cities! She would be worse than lost or dead. He
  divined that Uhl would never release her. If he could steer them up into the
  hills, Stewart would be on his trail in another day. It was the only
  chance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; called Lance, as the car approached to within
  fifty feet of the campfire, out in the shadow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fox, you and Flemm get out and stick up this bunch,&rdquo; ordered
  Uhl.</p>

  <p>It was done almost in the twinkling of an eye. Uhl got out and faced the
  cowboys. Sloan&rsquo;s comrades, especially the cook, looked comical in their
  maze, but Sloan himself grew pale and grim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No holdup, cowboys. I want to buy horses and stuff to go up in the
  hills. Here&rsquo;s a grand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet?&rdquo; queried Sloan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten hundred smackers&mdash;a thousand dollars, you
  dumbbell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want fer thet much?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five saddle horses, some packs, and whatever else we
  need.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl stuck the bill into the cowboy&rsquo;s shirt pocket. &ldquo;Line them
  up, Flemm, and keep &rsquo;em covered.... Come here, cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance strode into the campfire light, quite prepared for the profane
  ejaculations of Sloan and the Spencer brothers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pick out what we want damn quick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uhl, we&rsquo;d save time by having these cowboys help me saddle
  and pack. Two of your men can keep them covered,&rdquo; suggested Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oke. Step on it,&rdquo; rejoined Uhl, then repaired to the car. He
  opened the back door. &ldquo;Come out, baby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge descended from the car, clad in white slacks and a white sport coat.
  She made a step toward the campfire, when Uhl seized her roughly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you move only when you&rsquo;re told,&rdquo; ordered the
  gangster, harshly. &ldquo;Honey Bee Uhl talking&mdash;and you get
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. But keep your hands off me,&rdquo; flashed Madge, with a
  passion that told her spirit had not been weakened. And she twisted free.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oke, baby. But you might as well get used to them.... Raggy, throw
  that college bloke out. Then you grab some eats and drink and beat
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance was as amazed as the other cowboys to see a limp young man pulled
  out of the car. He appeared dazed or injured, but he sat up, to disclose the
  handsome pale features of Rollie Stevens.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get up and come to the fire,&rdquo; ordered Uhl. And he pushed
  Madge along ahead of him. &ldquo;Now sit down, both of you. In a minute
  I&rsquo;ll talk ransom money to you.... Raggy, don&rsquo;t forget to put our
  bags out of the car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance tried to see and hear everything from where he saddled Umpqua. The
  other cowboys were saddling and packing with extreme celerity under the guns
  of the two gangsters. Lance, thinking to have Madge ride his horse, shortened
  the stirrups. If a chance offered he might shoot one or more of these fellows
  and leap up behind Madge to make their escape. In a very few minutes six
  saddle and two pack horses were ready to travel. He searched for an extra
  rope and canteen, to tie them on his saddle. He heard the car roar and roll
  away up the ridge road. Hurrying back to the campfire he said crisply:
  &ldquo;Ready, Uhl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Rollie Stevens. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sidway.
  Madge, look!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure,&rdquo; returned Madge, with infinite
  scorn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Kidnaper!</i>&rdquo; shouted Stevens, incredulously. Then it
  appeared a kind of joy came over him. That infuriated Lance, whose nerves
  were taut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fetch those cowboys here,&rdquo; called Uhl.</p>

  <p>When Sloan and his two comrades were lined up in front of the gangster, he
  asked, indicating Sloan, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tim Sloan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get this dope, cowboy,&rdquo; went on the gangster, deliberately.
  &ldquo;In the morning you notify Stewart I&rsquo;m holding his daughter for
  fifty grand....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father can&rsquo;t raise that,&rdquo; interposed Madge.
  &ldquo;He is practically ruined. But I can raise half that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby, will you keep out of this?&rdquo; retorted Uhl, then turning
  to Sloan again he resumed, &ldquo;Notify Stewart I want fifty grand for her,
  and the same for her boy friend. If my orders are not obeyed, we&rsquo;ll
  rape the girl, and then kill them both. No bluffing. Send one man on our
  track with the money. Get that, cowboy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore&mdash;I get it,&rdquo; replied Sloan, huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fox, you keep these fellows covered until we&rsquo;re all in the
  saddle and out of the light.... Sidway, you lead the way with the pack
  horses. I&rsquo;ll follow with the dame. Fox, you and Flemm drive Stevens
  between you. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uhl, I&rsquo;ve selected an easy-gaited horse for Miss
  Stewart,&rdquo; spoke up Lance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? Bet she&rsquo;ll stand it better than any of us. I
  haven&rsquo;t been in a saddle half a dozen times in my life.... Which horse?
  Come on, baby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance led them over to Umpqua, and took from the saddle the fleece-lined
  coat he had untied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get into this. It&rsquo;ll be bitter cold when we&rsquo;re high
  up,&rdquo; he said, and held the coat for her. If he had not been under
  stress of strongly suppressed emotion he might have recoiled from her
  convulsed white face and magnificent eyes. But her look of horror and hate
  strangely changed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>It can&rsquo;t&mdash;be true!</i>&rdquo; she cried,
  poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t be true, baby?&rdquo; interposed Uhl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That Lance Sidway is a side partner of <i>you</i>, Bee
  Uhl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, it happens that I am,&rdquo; replied Lance.
  &ldquo;Hurry into this coat.... You&rsquo;ll find gloves in the
  pocket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance blindly held the coat for her and then plunged away. Mounting
  Sloan&rsquo;s horse he drove the two pack animals into the road, and headed
  for the dark hills. In a moment or more he recognized Umpqua&rsquo;s gait
  behind him, and presently heard the other horses following. It was done, and
  his heart seemed to descend from his throat and settle where it belonged. A
  cool wind blew down from the heights. The stars blinked as if incredulous.
  His jumbled thoughts began to straighten out. No use to marvel at where he
  found himself&mdash;at the unaccountable fate which had finally placed it in
  his power to save Madge Stewart, her honor and her life, and the happiness of
  her parents. Somehow he would do it. All these dove-tailing angles could not
  be merely coincidences. They fitted, and he felt that he would solve the
  problem. But he must be governed by cool judgment instead of emotion. To this
  end he brought sternly to bear all the mentality of which he was capable. And
  out of the welter of thoughts he fixed upon a determination to be alert and
  ready on the instant to seize any opportunity to escape with Madge. It would
  come inevitably. These tenderfoot gangsters, unused to horses and pains,
  climbing into the wild rugged hills, would sooner or later provide that
  opportunity. But if it did not come before Uhl resorted to violence with the
  girl then Lance must be quick to kill him, and call upon her to run for her
  life while he fought it out with the others. That settled Lance into a cold
  and calculating mood which transformed him into another man. He was dealing
  with a matter of life and death&mdash;with vicious degenerates from the
  underworld of crime.</p>

  <p>Tim Sloan had a rather complex problem to solve, as far as Lance&rsquo;s
  connection with Uhl was concerned; but any cowboy would obey the
  gangster&rsquo;s orders, and then let Stewart decide. Lance knew what would
  happen and he would not have been in Uhl&rsquo;s boots for a million dollars.
  Stewart and his men would be Indians on the trail of this gang, and they
  would shoot them down from ambush or surprise them and hang them from the
  pines. All Lance&rsquo;s faculties must be concentrated on his task of saving
  Madge from these merciless fiends.</p>

  <p>Several miles out, the road swung to the south, and the Cochise Trail
  branched off around the lower point of the ridge. The black hills loomed
  high. A brightening to the east heralded a rising moon. Lance did not need
  the repeated calls from Uhl to &ldquo;step on it,&rdquo; and he led across
  the valley at a trot. The pack horses, with light burdens, did not hold up
  the progress. In short order Lance reached the point where the trail started
  up the slope. He dismounted here to wait for the others. Umpqua was close
  behind. Lance broke the tip of a cedar bush with a vicious twist. He prepared
  this first sign to make his trail easy to follow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How you riding, girl?&rdquo; queried Lance, as Umpqua came up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell. I like Umpqua in spite of the bum who owns him. It&rsquo;s
  going to be some romantic ride,&rdquo; replied Madge, mockingly.</p>

  <p>Uhl arrived next, straddling his horse as if he were on stilts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you gassing about?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I asked Miss Stewart about her saddle cinch,&rdquo; returned
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah? And what did that little dame say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl did and was promptly told to go where it was hot and that if he wanted
  to keep her from talking he would have to gag her. Stevens rode up then,
  accompanied by his captors. He appeared to have recovered somewhat and sat
  his saddle upright. The other gangsters, packing their bags and machine guns
  in front, looked as if they would have been glad to get down and walk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We begin to climb here,&rdquo; said Lance, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
  tighten your cinches.&rdquo; When he worked back to Madge and made a motion
  at her cinch she interrupted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep your black hands away from me. I don&rsquo;t want to be
  soiled. If my cinch needs tightening, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; and her voice
  rang with contempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Black?... Oh, I see. Gosh, how dumb I am!&rdquo; declared Lance,
  lowering his bare hands. &ldquo;Listen, you all. This trail is steep. Give
  your horse his head. Lean forward in bad places and hang onto his mane. When
  I stop to rest my horses you do the same. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He slapped the pack animals up the trail, and mounting he followed them.
  Umpqua, with a loose bridle, kept right on the heels of Lance&rsquo;s horse.
  When Lance turned to look back he saw Madge almost close enough to touch. The
  other four riders came on in close single file.</p>

  <p>Lance zigzagged after the pack horses, and forbore gazing back again. But
  he thrilled at her nerve. She was not in the least afraid of Uhl. Lance let
  the pack horses initiate the rests. They were well-trained animals. Beyond
  the first foothill yawned a shadowy cedar flat, which led to another slope,
  long and gradual. When he surmounted it to the summit a full moon soared
  white above the black domes, transforming night into a silvery luminous
  day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beastly trail,&rdquo; declared Madge, sarcastically.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to send a gang of laborers up here for two weeks to
  work on it. Big expense, though.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; replied Uhl, taking her literally.
  &ldquo;Tough as nuts. But, baby, you ride like one of those circus girls in
  tights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, you&rsquo;d better not go to such expense,&rdquo;
  interposed Lance, satirically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, are you a monumental liar?&rdquo; burst out the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up gabbing to him,&rdquo; ordered Uhl.</p>

  <p>That significant speech for once silenced Madge, and it almost drove Lance
  into throwing his gun on the egoistic crook. He had kidnaped Madge for more
  than ransom.</p>

  <p>Lance rode on into an up-an-down cedar country with an occasional pine
  tree heralding the approach to the heights. The air began to have a cool
  edge. The moon climbed toward the zenith. Presently the trail led into a
  narrow canyon. It was long and tortuous, heading at last into a mountain
  meadow, where traveling was comfortable for a while. A black belt of pines
  loomed ahead, shining in the moonlight. Lance kept eye and ear keen for his
  followers. Madge appeared to ride easily, but the others were growing
  crippled. They shifted from side to side in their saddles, let their legs
  hang, and grumbled intermittently.</p>

  <p>Once, under the dark pines, Lance was seized by a savage and desperate
  impulse. Here was the place to shoot Uhl and ride off with Madge. He almost
  surrendered to it. He was sure of killing the gangster, sure of Umpqua, but
  some hitch he could not anticipate might give the other gangsters a moment to
  rake forward with those machine guns. Lance refused the chance. A better
  would offer, and he importuned patience.</p>

  <p>The forest belt gave way to rough rocky country where Madge, if she had
  not bestrode a grand horse, would have suffered considerably. The horses
  labored slowly over shale and up loose slides and through thick brush that
  tore at them. The moon reached a point overhead; the air had a bite in it;
  coyotes mourned lonely cries; the night grew far advanced. Here Uhl at last
  fell off his saddle and walked behind Madge leading his horse. The other
  gangsters cursed and raved for a halt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, for God&rsquo;s sake, have a heart!&rdquo; yelped Uhl,
  finally. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we far enough? Can&rsquo;t we camp
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No water. No grass. You must go on,&rdquo; replied Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve rode&mdash;a hundred miles&mdash;already,&rdquo;
  panted the gangster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seems like, maybe. But we&rsquo;re not twenty miles from town.
  Better get on your horse again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl obeyed groaning. Lance would not let them rest, and presently divining
  that Uhl was dependent upon him and knew it, he turned a deaf ear to appeals
  and curses and threats alike. And he led on and up through increasingly rough
  country, until Uhl, with a bellow, fell off his horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, Uhl,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;You almost made
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Made what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Camp at Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold. Not much further. And a swell
  place. Water, wood, grass. A log cabin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gimme a&mdash;drink&mdash;Fox,&rdquo; panted the gangster. &ldquo;I
  can walk&mdash;the rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ride no furder for Al Capone,&rdquo; retorted
  Flemm, doggedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you can rot here&mdash;for a little shot,&rdquo; snapped Uhl,
  and he labored to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beat it, cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance led on, riding with his hands in his pockets. On the heights it was
  cold. Madge would be warm, all except her feet. Stevens appeared to be
  sagging in his saddle, but Lance could not summon any sympathy for the
  collegian. After more weary miles of travel Uhl burst out:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby, what kind of liar did you call Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Monumental. But that&rsquo;s weak. He&rsquo;s a colossal
  liar!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I bump him off?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing could delight me more, except to see <i>you</i> bumped
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re a hellcat, ain&rsquo;t you? But I&rsquo;ll tame
  you.... Hold up, you guide. I want to get on again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The last miles of that uphill ride were dragging and cruel to the
  gangsters. Even Stevens, hurt at the outset in some way, endured the ordeal
  better. When Lance led into the beautiful wooded park, which inclosed
  Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold, the moon was low and dawn not far away. He halted
  the cavalcade under some spreading pines.</p>

  <p>Lance&rsquo;s hands were so stiff from cold that he could scarcely start a
  fire. But that once done, he gathered firewood, and soon had a blaze. White
  and silent now Madge leaned against a tree. Lance threw his saddle, then flew
  to the packs. In a few moments he had them off the horses. He carried one to
  the fire and threw out blankets. Uhl knelt, his shaking hands to the fire.
  The other gangsters stood over the blaze, guns in hands, still wary and
  watchful. Their chief might have trusted Lance, but they did not.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;frozen?&rdquo; asked Rollie,
  his teeth chattering. &ldquo;Come to the&mdash;fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My feet&mdash;are ice,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; cried Lance, sharply. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be
  frozen. It&rsquo;s not cold enough.... Sit here, on this blanket. Lean
  against the pack. Put this blanket over you.... Never mind, I&rsquo;ll take
  off your shoes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her thin shoes and stockings afforded little protection against this
  frosty air. Her little feet did feel like blocks of ice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, throw a blanket round you and sit close to her,&rdquo; went
  on Lance. No one seemed to oppose him, and he caught Madge&rsquo;s great dark
  eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>Then Lance leaped to throw the other pack, and unsaddle the horses. He
  turned them loose. The luxuriant grass and good water in the mountain park
  were the equal of any pasture. There was not much likelihood of their
  straying soon, and Umpqua at least would stay. Lance went back to the fire.
  Madge was asleep, her fair face drooping upon Rollie&rsquo;s shoulder. He too
  had sunk into weary slumber. On the other side of the fire Uhl lay covered
  with his head on a log, dead asleep. Fox appeared to have crawled under a
  pack canvas. Flemm sat on his guard, his machine gun at rest, his eyes like
  gimlets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, stretch yourself right there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Me
  an&rsquo; Fox will have a go at this job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance dragged his saddle close, and wrapping himself in his blanket he lay
  down to make up a little for the loss of two nights&rsquo; sleep. His last
  thought was a wondering if he dared risk a snap shot at Flemm, and then kill
  Fox and Uhl as they lay. Sleep claimed him before he could decide.</p>

  <p>Daylight had come when he was awakened by a sound of wood being dumped
  upon the fire. Fox had taken Flemm&rsquo;s place on guard. The others were
  locked in slumber. Lance fell asleep again and when he awakened the sun was
  high. Uhl sat huddled near the fire, his pale face showing the havoc of
  extreme exertion and privation. Behind him the fox-featured guard paced to
  and fro, gun in hand.</p>

  <p>Lance threw off his blanket and arose to his feet, cramped with the
  cold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning. Kind of brisk up here on top,&rdquo; he said,
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brisk?&mdash;Ha! I damn near froze to death,&rdquo; ejaculated
  Uhl.</p>

  <p>Lance spread his hands to the blaze, and casually looked about. The third
  gangster evidently was hidden under the tarpaulin. The two victims of the
  kidnapers were asleep. All Lance could see of Madge was her disheveled golden
  hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uhl, it&rsquo;s only a little way to the log cabin,&rdquo; said
  Lance. &ldquo;Much better place to camp. Hadn&rsquo;t we better move over?
  Then I&rsquo;ll cook some meat and make some hot coffee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oke, cowboy. Step on it. I&rsquo;ll follow with these duds.... Fox,
  kick Flemm out of his sleep.... Baby, wake up and get wise. This is the last
  time you&rsquo;ll ever sleep with any man but me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance, with murder in his heart, lifted a pack upon his shoulder, and
  stepping into the trail he strode for the clearing. He could see it through
  the big pines, a beautiful glade, with its frosted grass glistening under the
  sun. Sight of deer made him think of his rifle. That was in his saddle
  sheath. There might come a chance later to use it. Umpqua whistled from some
  point near at hand. Lance saw no sign of the other horses. A huge pine tree
  with wide spreading branches, and some high gray rocks marked the site of the
  log cabin. Its open door stared like a black curious eye, wondering what was
  to happen there. All around the stately pines stood up and beyond them rugged
  crags. This spot had once been the stronghold of the Apache chief, Cochise,
  at which time the trail was known only to the Indians.</p>

  <p>Depositing the pack under the pine, Lance hurried back for another load.
  Halfway he met the gangsters. Lance swerved off the trail into the brush. He
  had a reluctance to meet Madge Stewart face to face. Yet the part he was
  playing sustained him with a kind of rapture. Perhaps he was afraid she might
  see through him. Most certainly he must look a queer kind of villain.
  Returning to the glade with the second pack, which he had opened, he set that
  down with the other, and then proceeded to build a fire. This done, he went
  back to fetch his saddle and the blankets that had been left.</p>

  <p>Flemm, the meanest looking of the gangsters, manifestly distrusted Lance,
  and for that matter, the situation itself. He sat apart, holding the machine
  gun across his knee.</p>

  <p>Lance spread the tarpaulin on the grass and proceeded to empty the
  contents of a pack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, you&rsquo;re one of these worthless rich guys, I
  know,&rdquo; said Lance, not without sarcasm. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;d
  condescend to help me, we&rsquo;d have breakfast sooner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d starve to death before I&rsquo;d associate with you in
  any way,&rdquo; declared the collegian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;d let Madge starve, too. If you and she were
  left alone on your own, she&rsquo;d soon get your number.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t address me again, you two-faced scoundrel. You&rsquo;re
  a dirty rat, Sidway, and your pleas won&rsquo;t get you anywhere with Miss
  Stewart or me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What would you call yourself for night before last?&rdquo; queried
  Lance, in bitter scorn.</p>

  <p>Stevens&rsquo; pale face flamed red, but it was fury more than shame that
  strangled his speech in his throat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you said a mouthful,&rdquo; interposed Uhl, caustically.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;d this swelled-up sap pull on my baby?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whom you mean,&rdquo; snapped Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Miss Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&mdash;See here, cowboy. Don&rsquo;t let this dame work on
  you. Flemm swears you&rsquo;re sore because we beat you to this
  snatch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bee, I tell you he&rsquo;s not on the level,&rdquo; interposed
  Flemm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, you&rsquo;re not on the spot with me,&rdquo; went on Uhl.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done me service and I&rsquo;m for you. But don&rsquo;t
  strain things on account of a pretty skirt. That doesn&rsquo;t go with me....
  What&rsquo;d this swell sap do to Madge Stewart that burned you
  up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance was quick to see how jealousy and heat had imperiled him, and
  therefore the girl. Despite his calculations he had erred.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chief, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it much,&rdquo; Lance said, with an
  outright laugh. &ldquo;I happened to see Stevens trying to take liberties
  with Miss Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he get away with it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The gangsters&rsquo; explosion of mirth was no compliment to Madge. Lance
  resisted a strong impulse to look at her then. No doubt she would be
  something unforgettable to see.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Skip the dirt about me, you poor fish!&rdquo; she interrupted
  shortly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Lance felt her close to him, and then heard her light step. He
  was on his knees on the tarpaulin fumbling among cans and parcels, and he was
  aware that his hands shook.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did anyone see the sack I had with me last night? Coffee and
  butter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it was a snake, it&rsquo;d bite you,&rdquo; spoke up Madge,
  sweetly. &ldquo;There, under your nose!&mdash;Lance, can I offer my services
  as assistant cook?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance sustained a slight start. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;any good?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty good&mdash;in <i>that</i> way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you mix biscuit dough?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell. Nels taught me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to it. Here&rsquo;s flour, salt, lard, pan. Fetch some water.
  I&rsquo;ll heat the Dutch oven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl showed interest in the proceedings. The other gangsters grinned
  sardonically. Stevens sat dejectedly with his face in his hands. Lance cut
  strips of bacon into a skillet all the while bafflingly aware of the going
  and returning of the girl, and then her agitating presence close beside him,
  on her knees. The shine of her hair, the fragrance of her, the vitality of
  her, and more than all that nameless and irresistible attraction seemed
  propelled into his senses. Hurriedly he arose to rake red coals out of the
  fire, to put on the oven to heat, and the coffeepot to boil, to fetch more
  firewood, and to find other tasks. It was the eyes of Uhl and his allies
  fixed upon the kneeling girl that drove Lance to look at her. She had thrown
  off the heavy coat, and knelt in her thin slacks, her round, gold-tanned arms
  bare, her beautiful voluptuous form revealed in all its devastating
  allurement. Lance cursed under his breath. This gangster was a ghoul for both
  money and flesh. Madge was in deadly peril, yet seemed oblivious of it.
  Lance&rsquo;s calculation had been that by midday Stewart would be on his
  trail. That would fetch him to the mountain clearing late the coming night or
  at dawn. What might happen before then? No matter what happened, Stewart and
  his men could be expected to waylay or ambush the gangsters and kill them. No
  doubt Tim Sloan and the Spencer boys would be with them. It was all up with
  Uhl right that moment. They would not escape these relentless rangers. Gene
  Stewart would experience a throwback to his wild frontier days. But they were
  hours and miles away. And Lance had to escape with Madge before nightfall.
  These thoughts revolved in his mind as he performed the tasks of cook around
  the campfire.</p>

  <p>Presently breakfast was ready, and it was Madge, not Lance, who called:
  &ldquo;Come and get it!&rdquo; Kneeling over the fire had caused her cheeks
  to burn red, and it was only in her deep somber eyes that there was any sign
  of physical or mental distress. They all sat or knelt to eat and drink,
  except the cursed Flemm, who patrolled his short beat. Fox brought him food
  and drink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby, I didn&rsquo;t think it was in you,&rdquo; declared Uhl,
  devouring one of the hot biscuits.</p>

  <p>Then Lance discovered that as she did not reply, nor deign to glance at
  the gangster, he took offense at her indifference. Evidently he had a
  tremendous egoism. &ldquo;Get this, baby,&rdquo; he flashed, in cold passion.
  &ldquo;Soon as I thaw out and get some sleep, I&rsquo;ll change your damned
  snooty manner.&rdquo; With that he stamped away into the pine brush beyond
  the clearing. Stevens appeared to shrivel up at the significance of that
  threat. Madge gazed intently at Lance, her wonderful eyes, hypnotic in
  effect, searching his very soul. She was delving into his depths. What did
  she imagine she saw there? She was strangely uncertain of her convictions
  about him. Her present bad conceptions might be warring with good ones of the
  past. Lance nearly betrayed himself before her tremendous appeal. But he was
  aware that the beady and fox-eyed gangsters were watching, too. Kneeling once
  more, Lance bent over the utensils, and began collecting them preparatory to
  washing. Presently Uhl returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Flemm, I&rsquo;ll give you a rest for half an hour. Then I want to
  sleep. God, that sun feels good!&rdquo; Then he turned to Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby, you can go into the cabin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hurriedly acted upon the order.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uhl, hadn&rsquo;t I better look up the horses?&rdquo; queried
  Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Horses? I forgot them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve strayed. I didn&rsquo;t see any tracks going down the
  trail. So they must be around. You realize how important horses are,
  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By God, I do now!... Here, Stevens, you wash up that mess. Cowboy,
  find those horses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance, making a show of anxiety and hurry, strode off. Circling the
  clearing he found Sloan&rsquo;s roan and near by his own horse Umpqua. No
  sign of the other animals. Lance did not bother to hunt tracks. He made a
  detour and came up within sight of the camp, and sat down on a log to peer
  through the foliage. He could see the cabin. There, watching intently, he
  brooded over the situation. Presently he saw Flemm rejoin Uhl. The three
  gangsters held a colloquy, which was unintelligible to Lance. But they did
  not appear concerned. Once Fox pointed at Stevens, who knelt with his back
  turned, laboring over his task. Again Uhl made a passionate gesture toward
  the cabin, at which Flemm threw up his hands in resignation. Then Uhl lay
  down on a blanket in the sun and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>Lingering there for some time Lance finally retraced his steps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Found only two horses,&rdquo; he informed Flemm. &ldquo;The rest
  have wandered off. I&rsquo;ll have to saddle up to find them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait. If we waked up the boss now he&rsquo;d bump you
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But every hour they may stray farther away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay by me. I&rsquo;d a hell of sight rather walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Lance proceeded to wipe the utensils for Stevens. &ldquo;Rollie,
  this is a tough break,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so hard.
  You&rsquo;ll come out okay, except for loss of some dough you won&rsquo;t
  miss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the money. I fear for Majesty. It was all my
  fault&mdash;that we were caught by these ruffians. I persuaded her to come
  out&mdash;lied to get her, in fact. And we were held up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway,&rdquo; interrupted Flemm, sarcastically, &ldquo;you
  don&rsquo;t strike me as a snatch scout.... Cheese it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance wisely refrained from further talk, though he gnashed his teeth.
  When the chores were finished he cut and packed firewood, mostly bark from
  dead trees. After that he cut great armloads of spruce boughs and dragged
  them to camp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sid, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; rotten about you, but it
  ain&rsquo;t in this camp stuff,&rdquo; commented Fox.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! He learned all that in Chi,&rdquo; laughed Flemm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, tenderfeet, if you&rsquo;re stuck up here for a week,
  you&rsquo;ll appreciate soft beds,&rdquo; replied Lance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Week! What in hell&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; you? Two days is my
  limit,&rdquo; retorted Fox.</p>

  <p>Lance strode off, ax in hand, groaning over a thought of what
  complications would evolve among these violent men in another day. He cut
  armloads of spruce, and packing that back he approached the door of the
  cabin, and without a glance at the gangsters, made bold to enter.</p>

  <p>To his amaze Madge had been waiting, surely watching for him, for she
  leaped at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance&mdash;<i>darling</i>,&rdquo; she whispered, and circled his
  arm with two steellike hands.</p>

  <p>He let the load of spruce fall with a sodden swish. Her extraordinary
  loveliness must have been due to intense spirit and emotion. Her face was
  like a pearl&mdash;her eyes glowing purple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you crooked or honest?&rdquo; she added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Crooked&mdash;as hell!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear it.... But still you must save me from <i>him</i>&mdash;and
  get the ransom. I&rsquo;ll pay anything.... He means to attack me&mdash;keep
  me!... For God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for Mother&rsquo;s&mdash;for
  mine&mdash;save me from that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.... Keep your nerve. Watch!&rdquo; he whispered,
  huskily, and turned to stride out. Before facing the gangsters he thought it
  best to go into the woods and cut more boughs. Recovering his poise he packed
  another huge load back to camp. Presently he said to Flemm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late in the afternoon. I ought to be wrangling
  the horses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hunting them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Set down an keep your shirt on. Or you might peel potatoes
  an&rsquo; what have you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Uhl!</i>&rdquo; yelled Lance, suddenly.</p>

  <p>The gangster leader roused out of his slumber with surprising quickness,
  and sat up, blinking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These guys won&rsquo;t let me hunt for the horses. I found only
  two. I ought to ride around these woods and find them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hop to it, cowboy. But don&rsquo;t forget we want supper
  soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance ran to get his saddle and bridle and blankets, tingling with the
  vibration of his nerves. All day he had pondered over the need to saddle
  Umpqua. Once astride the horse he felt that the critical hour was near at
  hand. Riding off out of sight he returned to the point where he could watch
  the camp. The heat of the day was waning, and sunset burned in the west.
  Lance saw Uhl, bare-headed and coatless, get up to go toward the cabin. And
  he went in!</p>

  <p>That was a signal for Lance to ride back toward the camp. He had to meet
  the crisis. Terror and panic gave way to fury, and by the time he had reached
  the clearing he was steel&mdash;cold and tight in mind and body. Boldly he
  rode to the big pine opposite the cabin, and there halted. Flemm and Fox were
  watching him curiously. With warning gesture, Lance pointed down the trail
  toward the opening into the clearing. Both gangsters were impelled to leap up
  and look. On the moment Lance heard Madge&rsquo;s ringing voice:
  &ldquo;No!... Bee Uhl, I&rsquo;ll pay the ransom. But....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby, you started it. You got to come through. No dame who ever
  lived can play with me,&rdquo; he replied, in cold passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i> play with you,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;But I
  didn&rsquo;t mean what you mean!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No matter now. You&rsquo;ll come across.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lance leaped off Umpqua and ran over to the excited gangsters. His manner
  would have struck anyone into amaze and fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Uhl?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He said he was goin&rsquo; to love his baby,&rdquo; replied Fox.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rode up high back there on the slope. And I saw two horses down
  where the trail comes up. First I thought they were our horses. But they had
  riders and were coming this way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Riders! You mean men on horseback?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure do.... There may be more than two. Looks damn bad. You
  better sneak down the trail, keeping out of sight, and make sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who it is and what they want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fox, you go,&rdquo; ordered Flemm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay. But what&rsquo;ll I do!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold them up. An&rsquo; use your gray matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fox looked to his machine gun, and ran out to the trail, which he entered,
  and glided along till he reached the green foliage where he soon passed out
  of sight.</p>

  <p>Lance stepped up on the pack beside Flemm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There! Look!&rdquo; he whispered, tensely. &ldquo;That little open
  place, beyond the yellow pine. See!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My eyes must be damn poor. I see nothin&rsquo; but green,&rdquo;
  growled Flemm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay! then see stars,&rdquo; hissed Lance, and swung his heavy gun
  on the gangster&rsquo;s bare head. Flemm fell soddenly. Whereupon Lance sped
  across the space to the side of the cabin, listening, watching the door.</p>

  <p>He heard a scuffle, then swift light footfalls, then panting breaths,
  and&mdash;: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&mdash;afraid of you&mdash;Bee
  Uhl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swell! I like my dames to be wildcats,&rdquo; replied Uhl, with
  something exultant in his voice, no longer cold. &ldquo;Make me fight for it,
  eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You lousy bum! Fight you? I can whip you,&rdquo; cried Madge,
  hotly.</p>

  <p>Lance made for the door. He heard thudding footfalls, a cry, and then a
  rip of cloth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let go!&mdash;Oh, you beast!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baby&mdash;I&rsquo;ll strip you&mdash;right now,&rdquo; panted the
  gangster.</p>

  <p>Lance leaped into the doorway, gun leveled. Uhl had Madge backed against
  the wall. The gangster&rsquo;s clawing hands held strips of her clothing. The
  girl, half-naked, was warding him off, like a tigress at bay.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Madge!</i> Duck! Get away from him!&rdquo; shouted Lance.</p>

  <p>The gangster froze a second, then sprang into convulsive action, to catch
  the girl and get her in front of him. But she was as strong as he and far
  more supple. A short struggle ensued, the end of which came when Uhl made the
  blunder of striking her down. Then, even as he half turned, his thin face
  gray, his eyes hot and clear as molten steel, Lance leaped to get in better
  line. When his gun boomed the gangster appeared to be propelled against the
  wall. It upheld him a moment. A great bloody blotch came as if by magic.
  Lance thought he had shot away half of Uhl&rsquo;s face. He stuck there an
  instant, a ghastly spectacle, then slid sideways to the floor.</p>

  <p>Madge lay apparently unconscious, a bruise on her white temple and a red
  welt across her bare shoulder. Lance snatched up a blanket, and lifting her
  flung it around her and carried her out the door. Flemm lay as Lance had last
  seen him. Far down the trail Fox appeared running toward camp. Lance took a
  long shot at him for luck, then sheathing his gun, he stepped to the snorting
  Umpqua, and kicked the stirrup around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Steady, Ump! It&rsquo;s me. Hold, you fool horse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With Madge in his left arm Lance mounted and drew her across his saddle.
  Umpqua needed no urging. As he plunged away a rattle of gunshots blended in a
  continuous volley, and a rain of bullets whistled and ticked through the
  trees, and pattered on the cabin. But in a few jumps the horse was behind the
  cabin, and out of danger. Lance held him to a lope along the wall of foliage,
  into the woods.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">NO SOONER had Gene Stewart lain down and dropped to sleep,
  some hours after midnight, than he was assailed by nightmares. It was just as
  well that he had not gone to bed in his own room, for he kicked around pretty
  violently. And he was in the thick of violent events when someone not a
  hobgoblin or demon thoroughly aroused him. Dawn had come. He made out Nels
  standing over him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Boss, you was loco. Never seen you so oot of your
  haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, old-timer. Been having crazy dreams. Must have been that
  punch concoction Madge sprung on us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait till you see Ren.... Pile oot, Gene, an&rsquo; throw on your
  ridin&rsquo; things. We&rsquo;ve got work on hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uhuh. So that was the big idea. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway just left on the trail of your cattle. Rustled last night
  before the ball opened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By jacks!&mdash;He wanted to tell me last night. But Madge
  wouldn&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Might hev spoiled her party.... We&rsquo;re to hit Sidway&rsquo;s
  trail pronto. Danny is wranglin&rsquo; the hawses. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
  throwed some grub together. Come along, Boss. We hev Sidway to thank fer
  somethin&rsquo; like old times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nels clinked out into the patio where his musical footsteps died away.
  Gene quickly dressed in his range garb, and slipped a comb and toothbrush
  into his pocket. His gunbelt had ample shells, and his rifle was down at
  Nels&rsquo; bunkhouse. Then he went to his wife&rsquo;s room and poking his
  head in the door he awakened her: &ldquo;Sorry, dear. Nels just called me.
  We&rsquo;re going after a bunch of strayed stock. May not be back for a day
  or two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So this is what young Sidway had to tell you?&rdquo; she replied
  quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good guess, Mom. Go back to sleep, and don&rsquo;t worry about what
  that cowboy starts. He&rsquo;s a finisher.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Going out through the patio Stewart saw two of Madge&rsquo;s guests, boy
  and girl, asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms in a hammock. They were half
  covered by a colorful blanket. It was a pretty picture, and Gene thought the
  girl was Maramee. &ldquo;Some party!&rdquo; he muttered, as he strode on.
  &ldquo;But dog-gone-it! I had a good time watching them.... Only&mdash;my
  girl worries me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clear daylight had come when Stewart reached the bunkhouses. Four horses
  saddled and bridled stood at the rail. He found his men inside eating. Danny
  looked grim and dark as he bent over his plate. Starr appeared drunk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, throw some hot cakes under yore belt.... Ren, you drink thet
  hot coffee or I&rsquo;ll pour it down you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels&mdash;old manz&mdash;I want drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I gave you a bracer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; said Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whosh drunk? I ain&rsquo;t so.... It wash just thet peach juice las
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nels forced the cowboy to drink the coffee, and stuffed some biscuits and
  cold meat in his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, let&rsquo;s get goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; interposed Danny Mains,
  darkly. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t miss my guess we&rsquo;ll hev hell
  catchin&rsquo; Sidway. Thet boy&rsquo;s another Nick Steele.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; agreed Nels.</p>

  <p>They dragged Starr outside and threw him on his horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you stick on?&rdquo; queried Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You insolt me,&rdquo; protested Ren, swaying in his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold him on, Gene,&rdquo; said Danny, &ldquo;till he
  sobers up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosh, whash in &rsquo;ell was thet punch as night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ren. It sure gave me a hell of a
  nightmare.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agonna get thet mixtoure from Miss Madge&mdash;an&rsquo;
  make million bucks. Washen thet heavern best drink ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A most deceiving one, Ren. It led you on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whash wuz in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dynamite, greased lightning, sweet cider and aqua
  fortis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell you shay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They rode down past the village, Stewart and Nels gradually drawing ahead,
  while Mains came along behind steadying Starr in his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, what&rsquo;s the deal?&rdquo; asked Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, some Mexicans sloped off with the rest of yore an&rsquo;
  Danny&rsquo;s cattle. Gosh, but Danny is sore! They was slick aboot it, when
  every last person in the country was heah last night. I&rsquo;ve a hunch how
  Sidway got wise to the deal. He&rsquo;s a clever boy, Gene. But how he found
  oot ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to us. The thieves drove the cattle acrost to
  the valley behind Gray Divide. An&rsquo; they expect to work them by easy
  stages down acrost the border. It&rsquo;d been a cinch but fer Sidway....
  Wal, he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to locate them, then ride on into town an&rsquo;
  get help. In the mawnin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll haid the rustlers off in thet
  narrow valley. Our part is to ride in behind the ridge an&rsquo; trail them
  down, keepin&rsquo; oot of sight. By this time tomorrow I reckon we&rsquo;ll
  be smokin&rsquo; them up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hardly, in that open valley,&rdquo; replied Stewart.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see us and slope. Which suits me, though I&rsquo;d like
  to throw a scare into them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;ll get the cattle back, an&rsquo; mebbe thet&rsquo;ll
  end this two-bit rustlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, as long as westerners raise cattle out on the range there
  will be stealing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kind of a disease.... Look, Gene, heah&rsquo;s the trail, plain as
  plowed ground. An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s the track of Sidway&rsquo;s
  hawse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see.... Nels, do you remember when I gave my great roan Majesty
  to Madeline and beat it for Mexico to get myself shot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd, yes,&rdquo; declared Nels, fervently. &ldquo;All thet past
  seems to be gettin&rsquo; clearer in my memory.... Gene, I&rsquo;ll bet
  Sidway gives Umpqua to Madge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that cowboy. He&rsquo;s got too much spunk. He&rsquo;s onto
  Madge,&rdquo; replied Gene, a little sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon thet won&rsquo;t make no hell of a difference. There
  ain&rsquo;t a man in the world who could resist thet girl long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you put it that way,&rdquo; agreed Stewart, pleased with the old
  cattleman&rsquo;s hint.</p>

  <p>Once across the highway the four riders settled down to a steady trot, and
  in two hours had reached the rocky point of the ridge. They rode around
  cautiously. The gateway to the valley was wide, and on the ridge side thick
  with sage and brush.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hold up heah,&rdquo; suggested Nels, and reined in.
  &ldquo;Ren, air you so bleary-eyed yet you cain&rsquo;t see
  nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I can see a hawse ten miles an&rsquo; a steer more&rsquo;n
  thet&mdash;an&rsquo; a gurl with a red bonnet twice as fur,&rdquo; declared
  Starr, swaggeringly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Climb up the slope heah an&rsquo; see if you can spot
  the cattle down the valley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd!&mdash;Climb in these high-heel boots?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Ren. I&rsquo;ll go, too,&rdquo; offered Stewart. They did
  not ascend the rough brushy slope more than a hundred feet when Starr made
  good his brag. Then Gene saw a long black band, moving like a snake, down the
  valley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eight or ten miles?&rdquo; asked Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n thet, Boss. Jest moseyin&rsquo; along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They retraced their steps and reported to Nels. &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said
  that worthy, &ldquo;I reckon we better keep travelin&rsquo;. We want to be on
  their heels when Sidway haids them back in the mawnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, don&rsquo;t I remember there&rsquo;s good water down this
  valley?&rdquo; asked Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you do. Nice rocky creek haids aboot where them cattle air
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be far enough for us. We&rsquo;ll camp there.... Walk
  your horses and keep your eyes peeled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They rode on in single file, somewhat separated. The sun rose hot; a flock
  of buzzards circled high over the locality where the herd moved, indicating
  death to a calf or heifer. Coyotes slunk through the sage, another indication
  of meat on the move; the black domes of the Peloncillos sank behind the gray
  foothills.</p>

  <p>Stewart&rsquo;s memory was busy. He recalled his early days with Nick
  Steele and Monty Price, and others of Stillwell&rsquo;s famous cowboys. And
  that reminded him of Madeline&rsquo;s brother Al, who had married Florence
  Kingsley, and had moved to Colorado to take charge of a ranch she had
  inherited. They had prospered. Stewart wondered if it would not be a good
  plan to ask financial assistance of Al. Something had to be done as soon as
  Madge&rsquo;s guests left, or he would lose the ranch. Madge would have to be
  told of the impending ruin, and Stewart hated the thought. But he must do it.
  Madge was wonderful, adorable, irresistible, but she was on the wrong track.
  Hours wore away while Stewart revolved memories and problems and hurts over
  and over in his mind.</p>

  <p>Some time late in the afternoon Stewart and his men arrived at the head of
  the creek and halted to make camp there. It was an ideal spot, with grass and
  sage, and cottonwood trees, and dead cedars near by on the slope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll boil a pot of coffee,&rdquo; drawled Nels,
  &ldquo;an&rsquo; what with our meat an&rsquo; biscuits we won&rsquo;t fare so
  bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rustle then, for I&rsquo;m almost asleep this minute,&rdquo;
  replied Gene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t none of us had a damn wink of sleep,&rdquo; added
  Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Ren, I had to kick you onmerciful this mawnin,&rdquo;
  protested Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet wasn&rsquo;t sleep. I was unconscious from Majesty
  Stewart&rsquo;s punch.... Boss, don&rsquo;t you never let thet gurl make thet
  drink again. My Gawd! if college eddication is responsible fer
  thet&mdash;wall, when I marry Bonita an&rsquo; we hev a dotter, she
  ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to get any modern schoolin&rsquo; atall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, your philosophy is sound,&rdquo; declared Stewart, ruefully
  after the laugh had subsided. &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be
  adopted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; why&rsquo;n th&rsquo;ell not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because these days girls will do as they please whether they have
  education or not. They are going to have equal rights with men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Gene, thet&rsquo;ll make a better world,&rdquo; interposed
  Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, never in yore born days, did you know anythin&rsquo; aboot
  wimmen, much less a dotter,&rdquo; observed Danny, pessimistically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dan, do you mean a dotter is a turrible burden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n turrible&rsquo;n awful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if you had it all to live over again would you kept
  single, so you couldn&rsquo;t hev no dotter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you, Gene, would you rather never hev had
  Madge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, old pard, ten thousand times no,&rdquo; burst out Stewart,
  somehow glad to express himself. &ldquo;Madge has been a joy. And will be
  forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thar yore talkin&rsquo;. She&rsquo;s life&mdash;beautiful
  life&mdash;an&rsquo; thet cain&rsquo;t be perfect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They talked and had their leisurely and frugal meal round the little
  smokeless campfire, while the sun set, and shadows appeared under the slopes.
  Stewart made his bed with saddle and blankets, and scarcely had he stretched
  himself when a subtle glue touched his eyelids. Late in the night he awoke,
  saw Danny replenishing the fire, fell asleep again, to be roused at dawn by
  an ungentle boot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come an&rsquo; get it,&rdquo; said Nels, cheerily.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a hunch we&rsquo;ve a day ahaid of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before broad daylight they were on the move. When the sun arose, Danny and
  Ren rode up the slope to locate the cattle, but failed to do so, owing to a
  projecting cape that ran down into the valley. This was some miles ahead.
  Before they reached it Ren sighted dust clouds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the run already,&rdquo; declared Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; admitted Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty far yet, Boss,&rdquo; added Ren.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, there ain&rsquo;t no use in our haidin&rsquo; the cattle off,
  when we want them to come this way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But how about the rustlers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they got haided off below, we won&rsquo;t see hide nor hair of
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They rounded the cape and rode at a trot fully five miles farther before
  Ren sighted cattle. They were headed up the valley and evidently had been
  running, but had now slowed down. They rode on, keeping sharp lookout for
  riders on the slopes, and presently had to take to higher ground to let a
  scattered herd pass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aboot seven hundred, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; observed Nels.
  &ldquo;Reckon thet&rsquo;s all of them. Not winded much. They&rsquo;ll be
  home tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonder where&rsquo;n hell them rustlers rode?&rdquo; complained
  Ren. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; swell, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d shore like
  to shoot at somebody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; replied Danny, relieved. &ldquo;Killin&rsquo;
  Mexicans even from acrost the border wouldn&rsquo;t set good with my
  family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Danny, we don&rsquo;t know them rustlers was greasers,&rdquo;
  declared Ren, too casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But I was afeared they might be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart suggested they ride on to meet Sidway, and whoever he had with
  him. Very soon Ren sighted three riders, whereupon Stewart ordered a
  halt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance ain&rsquo;t in thet ootfit,&rdquo; declared Starr, presently.
  &ldquo;Say, they see us, an&rsquo; air ridin&rsquo; to beat the
  band.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart was curious about the three horsemen who were evidently in a hurry
  to reach them. In very short order they arrived, three lean cowboys, ragged
  and dusty and hard-eyed. Stewart recognized them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boys. Where&rsquo;s Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart thought Sloan&rsquo;s intent eyes searched his with undue fire,
  and he wondered what was coming.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, all,&rdquo; returned Sloan. &ldquo;Stewart, you
  don&rsquo;t &rsquo;pear all het up aboot this raid&mdash;or
  nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well satisfied, thanks to you boys. Did you get a line on
  the rustlers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They seen us far off an&rsquo; bolted. We couldn&rsquo;t make them
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s that. Where&rsquo;s Sidway?&rdquo; rejoined
  Stewart, sharply, suddenly sensing some untoward circumstance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By now Sidway must be at Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold, guidin&rsquo;
  some gangsters who&rsquo;d kidnaped your girl Madge an&rsquo; a young
  fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A blank silence ensued. But amaze did not long obstruct Stewart&rsquo;s
  faculties. He had sensed catastrophe. Sloan&rsquo;s tan had lost a shade. His
  eyes smoldered.</p>

  <p>Nels flung a clenched hand at him. &ldquo;Sloan, what you
  sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, all of you. But don&rsquo;t waste no time restin&rsquo;
  here. Come on. Ride close an&rsquo; let me spill it.... Yesterday a little
  before sundown, Sidway caught up with us on the road to town. He told us
  about this cattle steal an&rsquo; asked us to help him haid them back this
  mawnin&rsquo;. Me an&rsquo; the Spencers was glad to help, of course. We made
  camp jest outside of town. Jest about dusk, Sidway walked in town to get some
  coffee an&rsquo; butter. Not long after, but it was dark, a big black car
  came up, an&rsquo; Sidway was on the runnin&rsquo; board. We was held up by
  two men with machine guns. Then their boss got out an&rsquo; bought my hawse
  outfit fer a thousand dollars. They was a gangster outfit an&rsquo; Sidway
  &rsquo;peared to be on good terms with them. I didn&rsquo;t get wise to the
  kidnapin&rsquo; till Miss Madge an&rsquo; the young feller was dragged out of
  the car. Then I seen it plain as print.... Now, to make it short, one
  gangster drove the car away, up the range road. Sidway an&rsquo; us fellers,
  under them guns, saddled an&rsquo; packed. Then thet pale-faced gangster
  ordered me to wait till mawnin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; notify you to send one man
  up the Cochise Trail with fifty thousand dollars fer Miss Madge an&rsquo; the
  same for the young feller. An&rsquo; if his orders was not carried out Miss
  Madge would be raped, an&rsquo; both of them killed.... It was hard fer me to
  wait till mawnin&rsquo; but with your telephone wire cut, I couldn&rsquo;t
  find out if you&rsquo;d left, an&rsquo; I knew you&rsquo;d be comin&rsquo;
  along here after the cattle. So here we are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By the time Sloan had concluded, Stewart&rsquo;s horror had mounted to a
  ruthless and terrible wrath. Starr&rsquo;s face had grown a leaden white, and
  he appeared incapable of speech. After a brief paroxysm of emotion Nels
  interrupted Danny Mains&rsquo; curses with a terse query: &ldquo;Gene, what
  do you make of Sidway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you?&rdquo; countered Stewart, huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got it figgered. When he went in town he seen thet car with Madge
  in it. He must hev been slick enough to scare them kidnapers off the highway,
  to take to the hills.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sloan interrupted impatiently: &ldquo;But, Nels&mdash;Stewart, it looked
  like Sidway was one of thet gang.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It shore did,&rdquo; corroborated the Spencer boys in unison.
  &ldquo;Their boss <i>knew</i> him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You all think Sidway was in with the gangsters?&rdquo; queried
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, sir&mdash;we do. Why, we stayed awake half the
  night talkin&rsquo; it over. These kidnapers are pretty smart. They take
  their time. We figger Sidway must have been sent on ahead&mdash;planned the
  job&mdash;rode away the day it was done. But we jest couldn&rsquo;t figger
  this cattle steal in the job atall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sloan, I&rsquo;ll grant it looked that way to you,&rdquo; rejoined
  Stewart, tersely. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know Sidway. I tell you the idea
  is preposterous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, sir. I only hope an&rsquo; pray you&rsquo;re
  right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Ren Starr exploded. &ldquo;I ought to throw my gun on you,&rdquo; he
  roared. &ldquo;Sidway&rsquo;s my pard. He&rsquo;s as true as steel. He
  <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> be in a deal like this. How in hell he ever got mixed
  up in it I can&rsquo;t guess, but you bet your life it&rsquo;s damn lucky for
  the girl an&rsquo; us. He&rsquo;ll <i>save</i> her. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
  have to apologize to me fer thinkin&rsquo; him a crook.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do thet now, Starr,&rdquo; returned Sloan. &ldquo;But be
  reasonable. Things looked queer. Circumstantial evidence, you know....
  An&rsquo; Miss Madge!&mdash;<i>she</i> believed Sidway was one of them. You
  should have seen her&mdash;heard her call him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;Gawd!&rdquo; gasped Starr, totally overcome by that
  information.</p>

  <p>At last Nels broke silence: &ldquo;Gene, I knowed thet cowboy would hev
  his chance. It jest worked oot thet way. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d gamble my bunk
  in heaven on his honesty, an&rsquo; his nerve an&rsquo; sense to beat thet
  gang. He <i>knew</i> we&rsquo;d be on his trail. Why, the last thing he said
  was, in case, look fer his tracks. Them gangsters air tenderfeet. Once up in
  the hills they&rsquo;ll be lost, an&rsquo; easy fer thet slick cowboy.
  He&rsquo;ll lay fer his chance, an&rsquo; as shore as we&rsquo;re right heah
  he&rsquo;ll hold them somehow till we come, or get away with her, or do
  something to save her from them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, thet&rsquo;s it&mdash;one of Nels&rsquo; hunches,&rdquo;
  affirmed Starr. &ldquo;But, my Gawd, we got to rustle!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sloan, you boys will go with us,&rdquo; asserted Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet your life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, we&rsquo;ll cut off the trail halfway up, and work round to
  the west side of Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold. We might get there ahead of
  them. It&rsquo;ll be a drill for tenderfeet. They&rsquo;ll be all in.
  We&rsquo;ve got time. We <i>must</i> make it before dark.... Now, all of
  you&mdash;ride!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Riders and horses were wet with sweat, and practically spent when that
  long climb up the mountain had been accomplished by sundown. A halt was made
  in the deep forest west of Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold, at a point they all
  agreed was scarcely a half mile from the clearing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ketch your&mdash;breath, fellers,&rdquo; panted Nels, as he removed
  his chaps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men, in case they&rsquo;re here...&rdquo; began Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They air heah,&rdquo; interrupted Nels. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we
  foller their tracks over two thirds of thet trail? Didn&rsquo;t Sloan ketch
  two of his hawses makin&rsquo; fer home? Sidway would make the gang stop
  heah, even if it wasn&rsquo;t the logical camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All&mdash;right, then,&rdquo; Stewart rasped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
  slip up on them. Then what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stewart, they&rsquo;re gangsters with machine guns. I&rsquo;d say
  shoot &rsquo;em down on sight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell, yes,&rdquo; agreed Starr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; added Nels, ponderingly.
  &ldquo;Shore we never&mdash;dealt with any of this ilk&mdash;before.
  I&rsquo;d say hold &rsquo;em up. If they don&rsquo;t hold up pronto then bore
  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means before they can turn machine guns loose in our
  direction,&rdquo; replied Stewart, grimly. &ldquo;But I want to talk to these
  <i>hombres</i> first&mdash;and then see them kick at the end of a
  rope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it&rsquo;s a better idee at thet,&rdquo; agreed Ren,
  savagely. &ldquo;But my gun finger is shore itchin&rsquo;.... If we only
  find&mdash;Madge alive an&rsquo; unharmed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will&mdash;shore,&rdquo; declared Nels, passionately. &ldquo;I
  may hev lived to be old an&rsquo; soft, but somehow I gamble on Sidway. He
  loves thet girl an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll ootwit the slickest kidnapers there
  ever was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, that faith has kept me from collapse. First time in my life
  I&rsquo;ve weakened. But it&rsquo;s&mdash;my girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Stewart,
  low and thick under his breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; ended Nels. &ldquo;Keep even an&rsquo; in sight of
  each other. No noise!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A pine-thicketed slope led up to the gray crags. They entered the mountain
  enclosure through a gateway between the huge monuments of stone. The clearing
  lay beneath Stewart&rsquo;s strained eyes, a green and gold park marked by
  great pines scattered about, and shining with appalling beauty under the
  sunset glow. A thin column of blue smoke halfway across made Stewart&rsquo;s
  heart leap. Ren pointed to a roan horse grazing in the open meadow, and Sloan
  whispered that it was his horse Baldy.</p>

  <p>At a motion from Nels they stealthily began their approach down to the
  level. Every few rods Nels halted to listen. Stewart could hear only the
  sough of the wind in the pines, and the murmur of distant running water. The
  place seemed locked in an unearthly silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ren startled Stewart and all of them. He held up a pregnant
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heah voices,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>He must have possessed extraordinarily sharp ears, for all of his
  companions shook their heads. Hardly had they started forward again when the
  boom of a gun made them statues. They listened with bated breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No forty-five Colt,&rdquo; whispered Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway packs a forty-four Smith an&rsquo; Wesson. Sounded like
  it,&rdquo; replied Nels. &ldquo;Come on, we gotta see this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before they had taken a dozen swift steps a rattling biting volley halted
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Machine gun!</i>&rdquo; whispered Sloan, in great excitement.
  &ldquo;Have I heard them? I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The continuous volley appeared to come from their right down the trail.
  Accompanying the rattling was a swishing cut of bullets through foliage and
  then a pattering on solid wood. It ceased. And Ren leaped up in the air,
  trying to see over the green brush.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah &rsquo;em?&mdash;Hawse hoofs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore as Gawd made little apples!&rdquo; ejaculated Sloan.</p>

  <p>Stewart was quick to catch a soft rapid thud of hoofs, a crash of brush, a
  cracking of dead twigs, then thudding hoofbeats dying away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet was when, Gene!&rdquo; hissed Nels, his gray eyes like points
  of flame, and he motioned them on.</p>

  <p>Despite the intense suspense, Nels had the cool judgment to advance very
  slowly, without the slightest sound. Stewart swallowed his harrowing fears
  and doubts. Then swift footfalls close in front made him, and all of them,
  aware of the nearness of the trail. Nels crouched down and stealthily
  separated the small pines to slip through. Starr followed suit, as did the
  others to left and right. Stewart saw the roof of the old cabin over the tips
  of the brush.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Flemm!&rdquo; shouted a hoarse voice. &ldquo;What
  happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He crowned me,&rdquo; replied another man, hotly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who? Not Stevens?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. It was that two-timin&rsquo; cowboy. He lied about seeing
  horses down the trail. Ruse to get rid of you. Then he beaned me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That shot in the cabin?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear any.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know Uhl went in the cabin to the girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I saw that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there was a shot in there, all right. Sidway went in and
  bumped Bee off. That&rsquo;s it. For I saw the cowboy come out with the girl
  in his arms and jump on his horse. I let loose my gun, but I was
  running&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t connect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The faces of Nels and Ren appeared to shine upon Stewart, a singular
  transformation from grim dark passion to an ecstasy of gladness. Stewart felt
  the same so powerfully that he was overcome. But his tremendous relief was
  counteracted by a hateful query&mdash;had Sidway gotten in that cabin in
  time? Again Stewart&rsquo;s passion to rend and slay dominated him. He
  crawled softly after the others, until he bumped into them.</p>

  <p>They had arrived at the edge of the clearing. Ren&rsquo;s hard hand
  pressed Stewart&rsquo;s shoulder. Peering through the foliage he saw that
  they were scarcely fifty yards from the campfire. Two bareheaded young men,
  with corded livid faces, stood facing each other. Both held machine guns. The
  taller, a dark-haired individual, was bending his head to the other, no doubt
  for examination. Beyond them on the ground sat young Stevens, apparently
  uninjured, but plainly shocked with terror. Then on the moment the gangsters
  whirled at a piercing shout from the cabin. A third man appeared, a
  slim-built fellow, with a bloody face. He staggered toward them, a ghastly
  spectacle, but assuredly instinct with life and desperation. His curses rang
  through the forest clearing. Then he confronted the astounded gangsters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That &mdash;&mdash; fake cowboy shot me... got away with
  her!&rdquo; he yelled, wildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you both&mdash;you
  &mdash;&mdash; hop-heads! What in hell were you doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He fooled us, Bee,&rdquo; replied Flemm. &ldquo;Made us believe he
  saw horses. Sent Fox down the trail. Then he crowned me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to God he&rsquo;d smashed your empty pan!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looks like he emptied yours. Better let us wash you off. Looks like
  what you used for brains is oozing away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only blood. He grooved me... here... Christ, how it
  burns!&mdash;Wipe me off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fox laid down his gun and picked up a towel from the pack. He dipped it in
  a water bucket, and wiped off the blood to disclose to the watchers the
  visage of a white, hard-faced criminal whose passion and experience seemed
  greatly beyond his years.</p>

  <p>&rdquo;HANDS UP!&rdquo; thundered Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Stick &rsquo;em up, gangsters!</i>&rdquo; rang out Starr&rsquo;s
  voice.</p>

  <p>Uhl and Fox lost not a second in elevating their hands. But Flemm whirled
  with his machine gun bursting into flame and rattle. Almost instantly his
  distorted visage went blank and he pitched forward. The machine gun sputtered
  into the ground, scattering gravel, then fell from the gangster&rsquo;s
  stretching hands. Stewart saw smoke issuing from Starr&rsquo;s rifle. Then
  Nels, gun low, ran out, to be followed by the cowboys. Mains came out from
  the right. When Stewart emerged from the foliage Sloan was disarming the
  gangsters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah, gimme thet rope, Spencer,&rdquo; yelped Starr. Receiving it
  he spread the noose, and pitched it deftly over Uhl&rsquo;s head. The
  gangster had courage or else he did not get the significance of Starr&rsquo;s
  move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Ren!&rdquo; ordered Stewart, and strode over to Stevens.
  &ldquo;Are you all right, boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;sir. I&mdash;guess so,&rdquo; faltered Stevens.
  &ldquo;Thank God. I was about&mdash;dead of fright.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway made off with Madge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He did, sir, but&mdash;but...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was she&mdash;all right... too?&rdquo; queried Stewart,
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;not.... I heard her
  fighting&mdash;<i>him</i>!&rdquo; And Stevens pointed a shaking finger at
  Uhl. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d fainted&mdash;or was dead&mdash;when Sidway got on
  his horse with her.... But, Mr. Stewart&mdash;even if she was
  alive&mdash;she&rsquo;s as bad off with him... for he&rsquo;s one
  of&mdash;these gangsters!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s correct,&rdquo; interposed Uhl, darkly.
  &ldquo;Sidway belongs to Cork&rsquo;s snatch gang. He tricked me. He wants
  the ransom and the girl for himself. I&rsquo;ll get him for that if it costs
  me a hundred grand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw!&rdquo; burst out Sloan, sardonically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gangster,&rdquo; added Stewart, coldly. &ldquo;If you knew
  Westerners you would not concern yourself about that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ren Starr confronted Rollie Stevens. &ldquo;Say, did I heah you make a
  crack about Sidway bein&rsquo; one of this outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. He&rsquo;s hand in glove with these kidnapers. And he
  has betrayed them. He&rsquo;s...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shet up, you white-mugged college dude! What&rsquo;d you go to
  college fer? Haven&rsquo;t you any sense? My pard <i>saved</i> the
  girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a thickheaded fool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll have to bat you one...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Ren,&rdquo; interrupted Stewart, sternly. &ldquo;Make
  allowance for circumstances. It does look strange. But we&rsquo;ll clear it
  up presently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The gangster Flemm was dead, shot through the center of the forehead.
  Stewart ordered Sloan to take charge of the machine guns, and Starr to search
  the gangsters. Nels stood with his gun on Uhl, and not for many years had
  Stewart seen such an expression on that lean face. Then Stewart strode to the
  cabin and went in. There was a pile of spruce brush on the floor, but it had
  not been disturbed. Searching around Stewart saw tracks of Madge&rsquo;s
  little feet in the dust, and he could read from them that she had run and
  fought. He also found a splotch of blood in a depression, where no doubt Uhl
  had fallen, and had lain until he came to. There was little more to be
  learned in the cabin. The dreadful pang in Stewart&rsquo;s breast did not
  subside. But how grateful he was that Madge was alive and in the keeping of a
  man!</p>

  <p>Upon Stewart&rsquo;s return to the group, Ren pointed to several automatic
  pistols evidently salvaged from the gangsters&rsquo; effects.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You boys can have those. Save Uhl&rsquo;s for Sidway. I imagine
  he&rsquo;d like to keep it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How about these, Boss?&rdquo; asked Ren, and handed Stewart several
  wads of greenbacks. On one, the outside wrapper had a denomination of one
  thousand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peep into thet, Boss. All the same. What these guys call
  grands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well!&mdash;These gentlemen seem to deal in large numbers, said
  Gene, sarcastically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stewart, that dough is yours if you pass up this snatch,&rdquo;
  said Uhl, suavely. He seemed to lack comprehension and fear. And his
  assurance, even before the grim and silent Nels, was remarkable, and could
  have come only from supreme egoism and ignorance. Stewart knew that no power
  on earth or in heaven could stay Nels&rsquo; hand. These vultures had dared
  to frighten, and probably harm, Nels&rsquo; one treasure, and that had been
  Madge since she had first ridden his knee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Uhl. You can afford to be generous, for you won&rsquo;t
  need that money where you are going.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, he doesn&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; declared Starr,
  contemptuously. &ldquo;Let me hev the fun of tellin&rsquo; him.&rdquo; And
  the cowboy gave the lasso a jerk that made the noose close up like a snake
  round Uhl&rsquo;s neck. The gangster spread the noose and flung it off his
  head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, I never forget faces,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  put men on the spot for less than that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike!&rdquo; shrilled Starr, astounded and
  resentful. &ldquo;Boss!&mdash;Nels!&mdash;Danny! Did you heah this guy?
  He&rsquo;d put me on the spot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart realized that his comrades as well as he were profoundly impressed
  by this new type of desperado. Absolutely, Uhl was convinced he would get out
  of this predicament. His ally, Fox, was an older man and less assured. No
  doubt he had always been a tool. Uhl, young as he was, indubitably had been
  used to imperious and unlimited power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you opium-eatin&rsquo; nut, air you so dotty you think
  you&rsquo;ll get out of this?&rdquo; yelled Starr, red in the face. It struck
  Stewart that the cowboy voiced a tremendous antagonism toward the cold-faced,
  steel-eyed gangster, while Nels maintained a silent ruthlessness. Stewart
  knew Uhl was as good as dead, yet had not the slightest divination of it.
  Stewart felt that he had an intense curiosity about this species of gunman.
  His own inflexible hate, now that fear for Madge had somewhat subsided, was
  controllable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me talk to this <i>hombre</i>, Ren.... You boys tie up the
  other one,&rdquo; he said, as he stepped close to the gangster. Nels had
  never swerved his gun an inch from its first deadly alignment. &ldquo;Uhl,
  you implicate Sidway in this kidnaping of my daughter. How come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a scout for Cork. I know that bird. I met Sidway in
  Yuma. He drove one of my booze trucks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. One of those trucks you sent back with stolen cattle,
  eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me steal cattle? That&rsquo;s a kick,&rdquo; replied Uhl, with a
  laugh of contempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the same your drivers did, probably on the sly. Sidway drove an
  empty truck to Tucson. It had been full of cattle. He was held up by men who
  expected to find bootleg whisky. Later this truck and others like it parked
  off the highway near my ranch to be loaded with stolen cattle. They got away
  with one load. Sidway killed one of your men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uhl gave vent to a rage that convinced Stewart of his innocence of
  complicity in the raid. Such curses Stewart had never heard in the dens of
  the frontier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, Sidway is not what you think him,&rdquo; went on
  Stewart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a slick cowboy. He knew you&mdash;outguessed
  you&mdash;led you up here to your death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was going to kidnap Madge himself,&rdquo; snapped Uhl, but his
  certainty seemed weakening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your mistake. Why would he want to kidnap her when he&rsquo;s going
  to marry her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That random shot of Stewart&rsquo;s broke down the gangster&rsquo;s
  stubborn convictions and betrayed the terrible nature of the man. If he were
  capable of love for a woman, he must have felt it for Madge Stewart. At any
  rate Stewart decided the gangster had been obsessed with some violent passion
  for Madge and that an insane jealousy possessed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marry her&mdash;yeah?&rdquo; he choked out, his face purple, his
  neck convulsed, his eyes not those of a human. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  welcome&mdash;to the rag&mdash;I made her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart knocked him flat, but had the self-possession to turn aside
  Nels&rsquo; quivering gun. It seemed impossible, however, to control Starr,
  and suddenly Stewart had no desire to. Starr dragged the gangster to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bastard,&rdquo; he hissed, his visage gray and set.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never live&mdash;to brag of thet again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand aside, Ren,&rdquo; ordered Nels, piercingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Nels, you ain&rsquo;t gonna bore him,&rdquo; shouted Starr,
  hoarsely. &ldquo;An&rsquo; we ain&rsquo;t gonna hang him. We&rsquo;ll hang
  his pard, an&rsquo; make him look on, but by Gawd! I owe somethin&rsquo; to
  myself heah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Starr slipped the noose over Fox&rsquo;s head and jerking it tight he
  threw the end of the lasso over a sturdy pine branch, and caught it coming
  down. &ldquo;Heah, Sloan, an&rsquo; you Spencers! Get in on this. An&rsquo;,
  young feller, grab hold of this rope behind me, an&rsquo; pull, if
  you&rsquo;re half a man.... If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll beat hell oot of
  you.... PULL!... Ahah! Them yells choked off! Yellow clear through!... There,
  tie the end, Sloan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart averted his eyes, but he could not escape the grotesque
  jumping-jack shadow on the ground, or the expulsion of breath from the
  condemned and executioners, the scrape of boots and jangle of spurs, and
  lastly the incredible spectacle of Stevens hauling on the lasso. For the
  moment the collegian had answered to primal instincts, and his red visage was
  as beastly as those of his fellows.</p>

  <p>But suddenly Stewart swerved his attention to Uhl. The gangster had
  watched the hanging of his lieutenant, and his face, his look, his mien were
  vastly but incalculably transformed from what they had been.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of our necktie party, gangster?&rdquo; demanded
  Ren, leering at him. &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s how we do things in the West....
  I&rsquo;m jest damn sorry I cain&rsquo;t hang you an&rsquo; watch you kick.
  But yore swagger gets my goat. So Mister Bee Uhl,
  kidnapin&rsquo;&mdash;bootleggin&rsquo; gangster gunman, you&rsquo;re gonna
  go up agin my game!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah, Ren&mdash;none of thet. Hang him,&rdquo; said Nels, speaking
  for the first time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpumm, old pard. I wonder you ask it.... Where&rsquo;s thet popgun
  of his?&rdquo; Ren snatched it up from the pack and held it gingerly in
  contempt. &ldquo;What do you think of thet toy, Nels? These guys in the
  movies shoot through their coat pockets. Okay!... Where&rsquo;s his
  coat?&rdquo; Starr took that up and slipped the little automatic into the
  right coat pocket.</p>

  <p>Stewart had answered to the same strange antagonistic passion that beset
  Starr. No doubt Nels also was under its influence or he would have shot the
  gangster and made an end of the thing. Nels had been a gunman in his day; and
  later cowboys, who packed and shot guns, were wont to view with contempt the
  exploits of the modern killers with their automatic and hidden firing. They
  were simply murderers. An even break was Greek to them. But Ren wanted the
  test.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to reason, cowboy,&rdquo; importuned Stewart. &ldquo;I savvy
  you. But even a little risk...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Risk, hell? There won&rsquo;t be none. Anyway, Boss, neither you
  nor Nels must hev this crook&rsquo;s blood on yore hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference whether it&rsquo;s you or me or all of
  us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On account of Madge. An&rsquo; if you elected to take him to
  jail&mdash;why Sidway would ride down there an&rsquo; shoot him in his cell.
  Thet wouldn&rsquo;t do either, Boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nels appeared to be struck mute and Stewart had no ready answer. At that
  moment Starr reminded Stewart again of Monty Price. The advance of time did
  not change the hearts of these firebrand range riders.</p>

  <p>Starr drew his gun, and kept it in his hand while he helped the gangster
  into his coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There!... Stewart, you fellers get back pronto.... Now Uhl,
  don&rsquo;t move a hand.&rdquo; Starr backed away from him for perhaps twenty
  feet. &ldquo;Turn around, Uhl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The gangster did as he was bidden, exposing a front that was sickening to
  men who held courage and nerve as Stewart held them. Blood had again begun to
  stream down the side of Uhl&rsquo;s temple and cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten&mdash;grand&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; interrupted Starr, piercingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  talkin&rsquo; to an American cowboy.&rdquo; Starr sheathed his gun and held
  his hand out, his fingers clutching at the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, you give the word.... Come on, kidnaper! Let&rsquo;s hev yore
  game.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; rang out Nels. &ldquo;<i>Shoot!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart&rsquo;s gaze was riveted on the gangster. In a flash he jerked his
  right hand down into his coat pocket. As the corner of his coat suddenly
  pointed out to bark and smoke, Starr&rsquo;s gun crashed and in a second
  again. The gangster&rsquo;s bullet sputtered up dust and gravel. Between the
  shots his visage underwent an indescribable change, and as he fell the
  terrible instinct to survive left his body.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Darkness found Stewart and his men around a campfire in another spot,
  several rods from the cabin. Nels was cooking some supper. And he was
  speaking:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Gene, I cain&rsquo;t see any sense in tryin&rsquo; to trail
  Sidway in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hawses all in, Mr. Stewart,&rdquo; interposed Sloan.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to rest up tonight at least.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stewart endeavored to subdue his impatience and dread, knowing how right
  his comrades were.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, wait till Ren comes back,&rdquo; added Nels, and presently
  called them to supper. While they were sitting there the cowboy returned. In
  the campfire light his face showed white and set, without the violence that
  had distorted it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I found Lance&rsquo;s trail,&rdquo; he said, eagerly. &ldquo;Used
  my flashlight. He had Ump goin&rsquo; some when he struck into the trail. But
  he soon slowed down. I follered the tracks till they turned left off the
  trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll he do?&rdquo; queried Stewart, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beat it fer home. Thet guy an&rsquo; thet hoss&mdash;nothin&rsquo;
  to it, Boss, if Madge is okay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does he know how to get down out of here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we rode all over when we was up heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ren, you take his trail at daybreak,&rdquo; suggested Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I&rsquo;d thought of thet. But mark my hunch, Sid will beat
  us home half a day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Set in an&rsquo; hev a bite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I sorta ain&rsquo;t hungry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, eat an&rsquo; drink anyhow. It&rsquo;s been a tough
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You boys go after our horses and hobble them out for tonight. And
  Sloan, you&rsquo;ll hunt up the rest of your horses tomorrow,&rdquo; asserted
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be around close. Seldom thet stock will leave this
  grass an&rsquo; water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stevens set propped against a pack, with a blanket around him, his hair
  damp on his pale forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rollie, you had a hand in that lynching,&rdquo; said Stewart.
  &ldquo;How you feel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty scared&mdash;and sick yet,&rdquo; he replied, weakly.
  &ldquo;But it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t my part in that hanging. That was
  great.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. Brace up now. Everything is okay. And we&rsquo;re
  d&mdash;&mdash; lucky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Very little was spoken after that and nothing at all about the tragedy.
  The cowboys brought a pile of firewood to last out the night. Stewart asked
  one of them to fetch the cut spruce in the cabin, and he made his bed upon
  that. Starr was the only one who did not smoke. He stood back to the fire,
  his head bent. Stewart appreciated how he felt. The night wind set up its
  dirge in the pines and coyotes barked off in the distance. Despite his
  extreme fatigue Stewart could not sleep at once. The stars seemed to mock his
  troubled mind.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">UHL&rsquo;S striking Madge down had less to do with her
  collapse than the appearance of Sidway in the cabin, with his darkly stern
  visage, his deadly voice, and the bursting red boom of his gun.</p>

  <p>She did not wholly lose consciousness, for she felt him lift her and wrap
  her in a blanket and carry her out. More clearly then she heard a string of
  shots and the spang and thud of bullets all about, and felt herself swung
  upon a horse, and the violent jars of her body as he plunged away.</p>

  <p>A vague, almost blank interval succeeded. When her mind cleared again she
  was being carried comfortably upon a pacing horse over a level trail. Through
  the big black pines she saw the stars shining, and then a dim outline of
  Sidway&rsquo;s face and bare head. That thrilling reality brought back
  vividly the fight with the gangster, his half stripping her, and the brutal
  blow he had dealt her, and then Sidway&rsquo;s startling and fatal
  intervention. Sidway, no matter why, had saved her again, and this time from
  a horrible fate&mdash;an insupportable shame and inevitable death. Her
  thoughts grew so wildly whirling that she had to disrupt them by talking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance,&rdquo; she whispered. Apparently he did not hear her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance!... We got away.&rdquo; She felt a strong vibration pass
  through him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello! You&rsquo;ve come to?&rdquo; he returned, hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But I wasn&rsquo;t altogether out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to see.... Did he hurt you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, I was holding my own with him&mdash;when he struck me. I
  wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him&mdash;till then.... I suppose he could have beaten
  me helpless?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then... Uhl didn&rsquo;t&mdash;harm you?&rdquo; queried Sidway, in
  a halting husky voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not outside the blow. Lance! You&mdash;<i>killed</i>
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>saved</i>&mdash;me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From something hideous. He never meant to let me go for ransom.
  He&rsquo;d have kept me.... Merciful heaven! What an idiot I was&mdash;to
  flirt with Honey Bee Uhl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It takes a lot to cure some girls&rsquo; egotism,&rdquo; returned
  Sidway with an intonation she could not define. He seemed far removed from
  her, somehow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cured&mdash;Lance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, baby!&mdash;Excuse me. I fell into Uhl&rsquo;s way of
  speech.... The day will never come when you won&rsquo;t look at a
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But for goodness sake! I have eyes. I can&rsquo;t hang my
  head&mdash;never look.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A look from <i>your</i> eyes is enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&mdash;For what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To incite a man to
  madness&mdash;kidnaping&mdash;outrage&mdash;murder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Not a <i>real</i> man. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean, Miss Stewart, that whether you have guilty intent or
  perfect innocence, when you look at men with those eyes, you play
  hell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I observe, Mr. Sidway, that my marvelous eyes failed to play hell
  with you,&rdquo; she returned, sarcastically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only because I was wise to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge had no quick retort for that, mainly because there seemed some hope
  for her with this young man of dual nature. They rode along the trail in
  silence. But she watched him from between narrowed eyelids. If she had not
  been spent and in pain she would have found this situation vastly intriguing.
  At length Umpqua exchanged his pacing gait for a walk. Evidently the mountain
  clearing had been passed. Presently Sidway turned off the trail to the left,
  and had to pick his course. The forest gradually grew less dense, and
  therefore lighter. Thickets of pine and spruce reached above Sidway&rsquo;s
  head, and in places had to be carefully threaded. It became evident to Madge
  that they were traveling downhill. At length the cowboy halted as if
  undecided how to proceed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lost?&rdquo; inquired Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world,&rdquo; he replied, with a queer
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon you made a halt till morning. I&rsquo;m
  about done for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My idea exactly.... Soon as I hit a level spot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He zigzagged down the slope for a while, and eventually stopped, to slide
  out of the saddle. Madge could not help feeling that he handled her as if she
  were a child. He set her down, back against a tree, which Madge observed to
  be a cedar. There were still big pines about, but scattering, and the
  presence of cedars denoted lower altitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m freezing to death,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>He stripped the horse and haltered him to a sapling. Then from his saddle
  he untied a blanket, and other trappings. This he doubled and wrapped around
  her. Then he tore sheathes of bark off the cedar, and snapped twigs and dead
  branches, with which he started a fire not far from her feet. The crackling
  of wood and leaping of red flame changed the moon-blanched gloom. While Madge
  stretched her hands to the heat, Sidway opened a saddlebag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some meat, biscuits, dried apples, and a piece of
  chocolate.... Yes, and a little salt. Are you hungry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could go for a <i>filet mignon</i> in a big way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daresay you could. Sorry I can&rsquo;t furnish one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll have a biscuit and a piece of meat....
  Thanks. Where are we, Lance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up in the Peloncillos.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How far from that camp?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miles, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you could have gotten Rollie away from them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I expect trouble enough, without your boy friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trouble?&mdash;You&rsquo;ll not have any with me,&rdquo; she
  returned, all at once cognizant again of the double role he played.
  &ldquo;Lance, you&rsquo;re after that ransom yourself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the light of the fire she saw a dark tide sweep across his face. His
  somber eyes regarded her as if somehow she had recalled to him her true
  character. He let out a mirthless laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You guessed it, Majesty,&rdquo; he replied, grimly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will gladly pay you.... What will those gangsters do with Rollie?
  His people are rich. They will pay. But it&rsquo;ll take time. Meanwhile Dad
  and Nels will be on the rampage. That demand of Uhl&rsquo;s will drive him
  crazy. He can&rsquo;t pay it. I&rsquo;ll bet they are on our trail
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway had averted his face and he made no reply, facts that excited
  Madge&rsquo;s speculation. Suddenly a wild conviction bore crushingly upon
  her. &ldquo;<i>Lance!</i> Ransom or no ransom&mdash;you mean to&mdash;to keep
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You sure are some guesser,&rdquo; he declared, bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;God!&mdash;You can&rsquo;t&mdash;be so low.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men as a rule are pretty bad <i>hombres</i>. Don&rsquo;t you think
  you deserve it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes! Oh, I&rsquo;ve been a heedless, vain and selfish
  thing!... But, Lance, I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t been rotten...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you telling me?&rdquo; he queried, turning his back on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. I never.... Oh, what you must think me!... Lance Sidway,
  you killed that devil Uhl just so you could have me&mdash;take me
  yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said it, baby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me <i>that</i>. I&rsquo;ll hate you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you did already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. But I shall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay by me. More sport if I have to beat you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beat me! You&rsquo;ve already done that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart, I think you hit me first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes I did. For the dirtiest remark any fellow ever dared make to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Struck me at the moment as strictly merited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the way we quarrel! It gets my goat!... What do you intend to
  do with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so damn smart&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you tell
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can.... You&rsquo;ve fallen for this temptation, Lance Sidway.
  Too much easy money in sight! And a chance to get even with me!... I suppose
  you&rsquo;ll tie me in a cave&mdash;starve me&mdash;beat me... till you get
  that money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; he interrupted, as she choked over her words,
  &ldquo;you grow better all the time. Wise girl! College girl, you
  know!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, damn!&mdash;Lance Sidway, you&rsquo;ll have to marry
  me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She might have struck him, judging by his shrinking start.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll refuse to pay that ransom or move out of my tracks unless
  you swear you&rsquo;ll marry me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, if you think that important,&rdquo; he returned, in a
  queer voice.</p>

  <p>Madge, in the wildness of that agitation, thought she must make the best
  of a bad bargain. She loved him, whether he was a crook or a cowboy, a Dr.
  Jekyll or Mr. Hyde, a strange combination of virtue and vice. It ran through
  her mind that he could not forever stay immune, that she could win his love,
  and reform him. That might be the retribution meted out to her for her
  imperious and willful ways. After all he had saved her. She could not hate
  him. If he beat her she would fight back, and perhaps, womanlike, love him
  the more for his brutality. There was a queer streak in her, she feared, or
  at least one strongly primitive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are fagged out,&rdquo; he said, presently turning.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a bed for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He broke an armful of cedar brush, laid it flat, and put a saddle blanket
  on that. Then he arranged his saddle for her head. As she moved over, half
  crawling, the folded blanket fell, and the one wrapped around her half
  slipped off. Madge made no great haste to wrap it around her again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo; she said, moodily.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me almost naked twice.&rdquo; And she lay down to
  stretch out wearily, her eyes upon him, as he bent to cover her with the
  extra blanket. She made the discovery then that if the moonlight did not
  deceive her, his face was white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s settled, let&rsquo;s talk...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s settled?&rdquo; he interposed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose you&rsquo;d vulgarly call it my hash.... I intend to
  make up for the ruin I unwittingly brought upon Dad and Mom. I suppose
  you&rsquo;ll block that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late! I&rsquo;ll need the money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t be a hog. You seemed to like them.
  Can&rsquo;t you be sport enough to let me make amends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I liked Gene. And your mother is... swell!... But they
  won&rsquo;t need the money after you&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Sidway, when you were snooping over my securities and
  bankbooks, did you get a line on what I was worth?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did, you bet. It used to be about a million!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But that won&rsquo;t do you much good now. I can sell my
  pearls and other jewels for a hundred grand&mdash;as your gangster pards call
  it. I&rsquo;ll do that on one condition only. You let me split with Dad and
  Mom!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay! Fifty grand will do for our honeymoon&mdash;at least until
  the dicks get me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you were wanted by the police even before this,&rdquo; cried
  Madge, despairingly. Then she grew enraged and flung at him: &ldquo;How can
  you be so&mdash;so fine&mdash;so&mdash;Oh, so many things, and still be such
  a beast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mystery of life, baby,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;How can you be so
  sweet&mdash;have such an angel-face&mdash;such soulful, eloquent, lovely
  eyes&mdash;such a winning way with everyone, when at heart you are just no
  damn good?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve about convinced me,&rdquo; she said, darkly.
  &ldquo;Perhaps this will either kill or cure me.... But beating me, as no
  doubt you will, depriving me of the home I&rsquo;d just begun to love,
  packing me off like this to misery and&mdash;and God knows what
  else&mdash;perhaps it&rsquo;ll reform me.... Yes? No?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t limit your possibilities any more than I&rsquo;d
  believe one word you said,&rdquo; he returned, passionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly two of a kind,&rdquo; she retorted.
  &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not be fourflushers. If you&rsquo;re not big enough to
  reform yourself, and me, then be big enough to be outright bad. And not a
  two-faced liar such as you are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That stinging speech appeared to wither him. Presently he began to gather
  firewood and pile it conveniently. Madge had an intense curiosity in regard
  to him, and tried hard to keep awake. But she was utterly exhausted, and felt
  her eyelids falling again and again until they shut for good. She seemed
  scarcely to have slept any time at all when she was awakened. Sidway was
  shaking her, and not gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you dead?&rdquo; he called, with something besides
  impatience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;... The gray dawn, the piercing cold, the ghostly pines
  quickly regulated her bewildered senses to actuality. &ldquo;<i>Buenos
  dias</i>, darling. No, I&rsquo;m not dead&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; he almost shouted, most
  unreasonably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m liable to slap you good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you put one black and blue brand on me. Why not
  another?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get up. Move around. Eat something,&rdquo; he ordered,
  peremptorily.</p>

  <p>Madge found the first desperately hard to accomplish, and the second no
  easy matter, and the third impossible. Her hands were numb and her feet
  blocks of ice, until she almost burned them in the fire. Sidway went off
  somewhere in to the woods, presumably to hunt his horse. Madge could easily
  have escaped from him then. But that would have been absurd, even if she had
  wanted to. She walked away from the fire and back again, and presently found
  that exercise relieved both cold and cramp. At length the cowboy returned
  with his horse, which he saddled and bridled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ride,&rdquo; he said, brusquely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. You&rsquo;re very kind to your
  squaw&mdash;darling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But not in that blanket. Here, put on my coat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ll need that yourself. I can ride with this blanket
  around me. Only my hands and feet are cold now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Warm them pronto, while I tie these things on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When presently Madge mounted into the saddle she found the stirrups had
  been shortened to fit her. Without a word Sidway took hold of the reins and
  led Umpqua down the slope. He took long strides and a slanting zigzag course,
  down through the cedars. Broad daylight had come and gradually the nipping
  air and the frost lessened. Madge kept her hands in the folds of the blanket
  and endured the acute pain of cold feet. Gray shaggy foothills appeared to
  surround them; the heads of ravines slanted down between these, to widen into
  narrow valleys; through the trees Madge sometimes caught glimpses of a hazy
  void. When the sun rose it appeared to be in the wrong direction to her, and
  if her calculation was correct, Sidway was taking her down across the border
  into Mexico. He never spoke, never glanced back at her, but strode on, down
  and ever down, like a man who was lost and did not know nor care where he was
  going.</p>

  <p>Madge&rsquo;s thoughts did not change materially from those which had had
  their inception in the dark hours of the night before. She could not save
  herself, or help herself, and any romance or thrill she might conjure up were
  welcome. In the sunlight of day, however, her disappointment in Sidway and
  her disillusion grew more bitter hourly. She felt her strength failing, and a
  consequent gloom and sadness wore on her antagonistic and unquenchable
  spirit. The time came when she would not have cared what happened, if she
  could only rest. The cedar trees gave place to brush, which offered no
  protection from the sun, now climbing high and growing unendurably hot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, I&rsquo;m&mdash;spitting cotton,&rdquo; said Madge, at last
  breaking silence. &ldquo;Must have&mdash;a drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So am I. But hang on. I see green willows below. There&rsquo;s
  water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When at last Sidway found water it was none too soon for Madge. There was
  nothing to drink out of and Madge said if she got off the horse she could not
  climb back. Whereupon the cowboy, regardless of the fact that she had let the
  hot blanket slip down, lifted her out of the saddle, and after she had slaked
  her thirst, he put her back. Madge had never known before the sweetness and
  life in cold pure water. There were many things she had never
  appreciated.</p>

  <p>Sidway led on tirelessly, always down, but it appeared to Madge that the
  slopes were less precipitous and the zigzags far longer. She grew so weary
  that she sagged and swayed in the saddle, and so hot she wanted to fall off
  and perish, and so miserable that she had hardly strength left to hold the
  remnants of her garment around her. Nevertheless she would have endured more
  before entreating him to find some shade and let her rest. She hated him now.
  She could have killed him. To make her love him hopelessly and terribly, to
  heap the shame of her horrible selfishness upon her head were indeed enough,
  without adding this endless insupportable ghastly ride. Madge clutched the
  pommel and her blanket with sore and hot hands, and sat with closed and
  burning eyes, wearing to collapse. Minutes or hours dragged by until she
  seemed not to feel any more. Still she was aware when the horse stopped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Madge!&rdquo; rang out Sidway&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>Madge seemed impelled by more than his command. Opening her eyes she saw
  that they had halted upon a promontory, a level summit of the last foothill.
  A blue and gray range land not far below, clear and close in the sunlight,
  appeared to leap up at her. Across its sage-spotted floor moved a long line
  of cattle, wearily wending their way. Like a black ribbon some miles out
  stretched a road with speeding automobiles, flashing sunlight from their
  glass windows. And beyond, over the blue sage loomed a green timbered knoll,
  from the top of which, half concealed, peeped a white ranch house that Madge
  knew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cattle herd you see working back belong to your father and
  Danny Mains,&rdquo; said Sidway, imperturbably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the highway!... there&rsquo;s&mdash;my home!&rdquo;
  faltered Madge, fighting a sudden dizziness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d recognize it,&rdquo; he drawled, lighting a
  cigarette. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure tickled with the way I came straight down,
  in a swell short cut, from Cochise&rsquo;s stronghold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Lance!</i>&rdquo; She could not hear her own voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay. What now?&rdquo; But he never turned to look at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking&mdash;me <i>home</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, you poor fish!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not&mdash;what I took you
  for?&mdash;Liar&mdash;two-faced&mdash;cowboy&mdash;kidnaper...
  gangster?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Miss Stewart. I hate to disillusion you&mdash;spoil your pipe
  dream. It&rsquo;s just too bad, for you&rsquo;re such a swell romancer. You
  concoct such lovely things about me and my motives. But they didn&rsquo;t pan
  out, as you see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my&mdash;God!&mdash;Then you didn&rsquo;t kill
  Uhl&mdash;to&mdash;to abduct me, but&mdash;but to save me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right. Your comprehension is at least encouraging. You may be a
  bright girl yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want&mdash;a ransom?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge Stewart, I&rsquo;d starve to death before I&rsquo;d accept a
  dollar of your money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;I... What you&rsquo;ve done&mdash;for me, for Dad
  and Mom!... And I?&mdash;Oh, how little&mdash;how
  miserable&mdash;you&rsquo;ve made me! Oh, the shame!...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uttering a sharp cry she swayed in the saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Madge!</i> Hang on!&rdquo; she felt pierce her fading sense, and
  then, as she fell into his arms, all went black.</p>

  <p>When Madge recovered consciousness she found that Sidway was carrying her
  in front of him, and traveling at a fast pace across the range. Only vague
  thoughts accompanied her sensations of faintness and pain, and these faded.
  Then she went through stages of sleep or semiconsciousness, until at last she
  recovered sufficiently to make out that it was sunset and that she was almost
  paralyzed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance... how far?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Almost home,&rdquo; he replied, cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you
  came to... Brace up now. So you won&rsquo;t scare hell out of your mother and
  the girls.... Here, I&rsquo;ll have to wrap you up again, for you&rsquo;re
  sure in a state of nature.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;you cowboy!&rdquo; And she turned in his arm, to sink
  against his shoulder, reviving anew to life and pain and love, and realizing
  that there would be nothing worth living for without him. Wide-eyed she lay
  there, her cheek against his hot dusty vest. They began to climb and entered
  the pines. A little later Sidway halted the horse in front of the house and
  yelled: &ldquo;Hello, inside! It&rsquo;s Sidway!... And here&rsquo;s Madge
  all in, but okay!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stepped off with her in his arms, and mounting the porch, encountered a
  group of wild screaming and questioning boys and girls, and behind them her
  white-faced mother and the servants.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Stewart, she&rsquo;s <i>all</i> right,&rdquo; Sidway assured
  her. &ldquo;Let go, girls.&rdquo; He carried her into the house and to her
  rooms, finally to lay her down on her bed. &ldquo;<i>There!</i>&rdquo; he
  ejaculated, poignantly, and straightened up as the others flocked in, eager
  and wide-eyed, all talking at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; And that was all Madge could say as her mother knelt to
  envelop her in loving arms. But she gazed with blurred eyes up at the faces
  of her friends, crowded around the bed. It was a little while before Madge
  could answer coherently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&mdash;Darlings! I&rsquo;m well&mdash;and safe. You&rsquo;re
  to thank Sidway for that.... I&rsquo;m just done up. Oh, what an
  adventure!... About Rollie?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
  know.... Lance, tell them what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway turned away from the window. &ldquo;Stevens was all right when we
  left. I&rsquo;m sure Stewart with his men will have rescued him by now.
  They&rsquo;ll be back tonight, or tomorrow surely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rescued!&rdquo; they all cried in unison.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We were kidnaped,&rdquo; whispered Madge. &ldquo;Rollie and I went
  down to the village. That gangster Uhl!&mdash;I <i>knew</i> him. I&rsquo;d
  met him in Los Angeles. He&rsquo;d found out where I lived. He and his gang
  kidnaped us... And that night Sidway bobbed up&mdash;to perform another
  miracle. He also knew Uhl&mdash;and he fooled Uhl&mdash;tricked him to leave
  his car&mdash;and ride into the mountains.... Lance was the guide&mdash;and I
  thought&mdash;but never mind that. He led us up&mdash;to Cochise&rsquo;s
  stronghold. Uhl had sent word to Dad to&mdash;pay ransom... . Uhl meant
  to&mdash;to... he was vile&mdash;and Lance had to
  <i>kill</i>&mdash;him&mdash;to save me!...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sidway interrupted the chorus of wondering and awed exclamations.
  &ldquo;Her voice is gone. Stop making her talk, and fetch her something to
  drink,&rdquo; he said, hastily. &ldquo;Mrs. Stewart, Madge is naturally
  excited about all this.&rdquo; He briefly outlined the history of the
  adventure, ending, &ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s a sure bet that Sloan joined
  Stewart and they cut loose after us. I think you may expect them back with
  Stevens by tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, how can we ever thank you for this?&rdquo; exclaimed
  Madge&rsquo;s mother, fervently. &ldquo;What a relief!...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mom, don&rsquo;t let him leave!&rdquo; cried Madge, frantically, as
  Sidway started out. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll ride away... and never&mdash;let me
  thank him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, child!&mdash;Sidway would not do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he? Much you know!... Lance, promise
  me...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then the girls added their entreaties to hers, until Sidway, red of face,
  assured them he wanted only to go down to his bunkhouse to clean up, and that
  he would come back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have supper here,&rdquo; added Mrs. Stewart.</p>

  <p>At this juncture Barg elbowed his way to Madge&rsquo;s bed with a silver
  flask, and a glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; cried Madge, her voice still weak.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the wagon&mdash;for good.... Get me some water
  first&mdash;then hot coffee.... And I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But despite the assiduous attention of her friends and mother Madge could
  not keep awake very long. She slept until late the next day, to find that a
  relaxation had set in from her strenuous and harrowing experience. She was
  too weak to get out of bed. Allie, who had slept with her, told Madge she had
  never before looked so lovely and languid and fascinating.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That bruise, though&mdash;I think you&rsquo;d better hide
  it,&rdquo; added her worshipful friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; retorted Madge. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where
  Bee Uhl socked me.... It might serve to soften the heart of a certain callous
  and soulless person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty!... Is it <i>that</i> bad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&mdash;Allie, it&rsquo;s terrible. A million times worse
  than before&mdash;before...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before what?&rdquo; whispered Allie, intensely excited.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before he slapped me the night of my party. Oh! wait till you get
  an earful of that.... Before he saved my life.... Before I took him for a
  gangster and a crook&mdash;and God only knows what else I called him!...
  Allie darling, I&rsquo;m terribly afraid it&rsquo;s hopeless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Moron! Of course it will be, if you persist in this inferiority
  complex. But if you <i>get</i> to HIM...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other girls trooped in, clad in colorful pajamas and slacks, and made
  much of Madge. The boys hung at the door and out in the patio, and then her
  mother entered. Madge, for once in her life, was coddled and nursed, and paid
  enough compliments to last a month. But the one person Madge wanted most to
  see did not present himself. She was too proud, too hurt to ask for him. Why
  could he not be kind enough to come to see how she fared after the long ride?
  No doubt Sidway was anxious for the return of Stewart and the others. Madge
  hardly expected them so soon, and not at all without Rollie Stevens. Late in
  the afternoon, however, when gold shafts from the setting sun filtered
  through the foliage at her window, Madge was greatly excited to learn that
  Rollie had returned safely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drag him in&mdash;no matter how he looks,&rdquo; cried Madge, who
  knew Rollie&rsquo;s weakness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sight,&rdquo; replied Nate. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll get
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently there was a merry hubbub outside. Then Rollie came in, supported
  between Nate and Snake Elwell. Allie, who sat beside Madge on the bed,
  uttered a shriek. Madge was too overcome for mirth. The collegian&rsquo;s
  appearance presented grim evidence of the hardship and fright he had
  suffered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Rollie!&mdash;I&rsquo;m so&mdash;so glad!...&rdquo; burst out
  Madge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad myself, especially to see you home safe.... That
  blighter turned out a hero instead of what you and I took him for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Rollie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one swell fellow&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo;
  gulped Stevens, gallantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, <i>Dad</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your father is all right, Majesty. He&rsquo;s coming up, with
  Sidway. The boys drove me.... Excuse me now, Majesty. I&rsquo;m a
  mess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, as Rollie left, Dawson Metcalf called in at the door. &ldquo;Steady,
  Madge! Hold everything! Here come your dad and the hero!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The clinking of spurs on the stone patio path sent strange little shivers
  all over Madge. She squeezed Allie&rsquo;s hand and she felt her heart weakly
  swell in her throat. Then her father entered her room, followed by someone
  Madge saw only vaguely. Sight of her father stalking in, dusty in his
  rider&rsquo;s garb, dark of visage, somehow recalled Madge&rsquo;s earliest
  memories. What a piercing gaze he bent upon her! Never had she met his eyes
  like that. What thought had been in his mind? After that strange look, his
  eyes and face softened, and he held her shaking hands and kissed her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, lass, I&rsquo;m happy to see you safe at home,&rdquo; he
  said, with deep feeling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Dad!&rdquo; And Madge sat up to cling to him and hide her
  face. There was more than the aftermath of her adventure in her instinctive
  action. Had she nearly lost him?</p>

  <p>Stewart laid her back upon the pillow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty white,
  Madge. And that&rsquo;s a nasty bruise on your temple. How&rsquo;d you get
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honey Bee Uhl paid his respects&mdash;that way.&rdquo; Her eyes
  fastened upon Sidway, who stood at the foot of her bed, looking with grave
  eyes down upon her. It was not only his clean shave and change of garb that
  made him look so different. Madge thought she had never seen him so handsome,
  so fine, so disturbing to her heart and mind. She had wit left to realize
  that she should control her spoken thought, but so great an emotion that she
  did not care what she said. Her remorse seemed insupportable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance,&rdquo; she said, beseechingly, &ldquo;come here&mdash;beside
  Allie&mdash;and let me thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, saving me from Uhl&mdash;killing him, for <i>one</i>
  thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, you and I were mistaken. I didn&rsquo;t kill him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daughter, though you both thought so, Sid isn&rsquo;t responsible
  for that,&rdquo; interposed her father. &ldquo;Or I either. It was Ren Starr.
  That cowboy seemed unusually wild, even for him. Effect of that punch you
  served the other night!... Well, Ren shot Flemm when he held them up. That
  gangster turned on us with his machine gun spitting fire. Then Uhl came out
  of the cabin, all bloody. Sid&rsquo;s bullet had grooved his scalp. I had
  some words with Uhl. He was a queer duck, quite beyond me. While Nels held a
  gun on him, Ren and the other boys hanged the third gangster. And they forced
  your college boy friend to help. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&mdash;Rollie help hang a man&mdash;even a gangster who had
  kidnaped <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact. He pulled on the lasso like a regular
  cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It would have been extremely embarrassing then for Rollie, had he been
  present, to hear the outburst.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We intended to hang Uhl, of course,&rdquo; resumed her father,
  presently. &ldquo;But Ren wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. He forced Uhl to
  fight&mdash;gave him his gun and an even break. Killed him, Madge!... Well,
  I&rsquo;ve told the sheriff all about it, and that lets us out....
  Madeline,&rdquo; said Stewart, addressing his wife, who had come in to stand
  with Sidway, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good thing this sheriff is not like Pat
  Hawe, my enemy sheriff of our early years here.... And to conclude, we will
  have our cattle back in another day. All&rsquo;s well that ends well.
  Let&rsquo;s forget it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Dad,&rdquo; said Madge, her voice soft and low,
  &ldquo;it&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t ended well, yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How come? Sure it has.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thanked Lance,&rdquo; rejoined Madge, turning the
  full battery of her eyes upon Sidway, knowing she did so, but deeply sure of
  her sincerity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, do so, then,&rdquo; declared Stewart, with a laugh, as he
  arose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need&mdash;want to be thanked,&rdquo; said Sidway,
  with inscrutable eyes upon her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Darling!</i>&mdash;I...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There! Let that do,&rdquo; interrupted Sidway, holding up an
  appealing hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an inconsequential word for you, Madge. You
  call your friends &lsquo;darling,&rsquo; both boys and girls. You call Nels
  and Ren darling, and your parents, even your horses. So, evidently it&rsquo;s
  just a convenient word that places the lucky one within the charmed circle of
  your intimates. I accept that gratefully as your thanks for my little
  service. And it&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge stared up at him while the others laughed and made mirth out of it.
  What a speech for Lance Sidway! He was keener, wittier than she had ever
  realized. Had he the faintest conception of her remorse? Could not the cool
  smiling enigma see how she regarded him? There came a culminating rush to
  Madge&rsquo;s uncontrollable emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Beloved!</i>&rdquo; flashed Madge, with a passionate defiant
  eloquence. &ldquo;Is that less impersonal?&rdquo; she added trying to make
  her tone flippant although she felt her face burn red.</p>

  <p>Sidway appeared very far from being prostrated by that exquisite epithet.
  Turning to her father he spread wide his hands: &ldquo;Gene, I told you she
  is flighty. Out of her head! I noticed it yesterday toward the last of the
  ride. No girl ever pulled a gamer stunt. That night ride up on the mountain,
  then half another night down, then all day in the hot sun&mdash;why, it was a
  grand performance. Not to say fighting off that thug in between! It&rsquo;s
  no wonder she&rsquo;s cracked under the strain.... I think we all ought to
  get out of here. She needs rest, nursing, quiet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right you are, Sid. Come, beat it, all of us, except one or two of
  you girls to care for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They filed out, except Allie and Maramee, who piled back upon the bed.
  Someone shut the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh hell!&rdquo; cried Madge, wildly. &ldquo;Was there <i>ever</i>
  such a man?... So I&rsquo;ve cracked!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty,&rdquo; murmured the incorrigibly romantic Maramee.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most delicious love story there ever was in all the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Madge made the following day a quiet and recuperative and thoughtful one.
  Her guests were due to leave next day and she felt that she would be both
  sorry and relieved to see them go. The truck loaded with baggage departed
  early the following morning. And at one o&rsquo;clock three cars took aboard
  a hysterical bevy of girls and a merry wisecracking complement of boys.
  Farewells were prolonged. And at last, when it seemed all had been said, Bu
  Allen hailed the somber Sidway in a high-pitched penetrating voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, old darling, if Snake Elwell gives me the gate, I&rsquo;m
  coming back to go for you in a big way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That sally elicited a roar of mirth, in which Lance had to join.
  Madge&rsquo;s rather weak response was a little insincere.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, old red-top, that will be swell,&rdquo; retorted Sidway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you don&rsquo;t think anyone else around here has a look-in
  with you?&rdquo; went on Beulah, demurely anxious, with a sly glance at Madge
  standing big-eyed and disconsolate on the porch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a chance, Bu.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then with a chorus of: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be seeing you!&rdquo; they were
  off. Madge watched the cars wind into the green pines and disappear down the
  slope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Sidway, with Nels and Ren, had slipped away unobserved. There were tears
  in her mother&rsquo;s eyes. Her father bent an abstracted gaze below,
  watching to see the cars come out from under the slope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darlings, let&rsquo;s get it over,&rdquo; said Madge, and locking
  arms with her parents she led them in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get what over?&rdquo; queried Stewart, with a start, and her mother
  looked suddenly concerned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Dad! Don&rsquo;t try to fool your little Madge.&rdquo;
  Forthright then, she plunged abruptly into a confession of how it had come
  about that Sidway had told her of the impending ruin, if she did not retrieve
  the situation. She tried to spare the cowboy, but not herself. The quarrel
  they had had, and the vicious slap she had given him, surely justified him in
  losing his temper to bitterly flay her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You slapped that cowboy, Madge?&rdquo; queried Stewart in surprise
  and concern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I did. You may have observed his cut and swollen
  lip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.... What did Sidway say to that?&rdquo; asked her father
  curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He slapped me back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d jar my teeth out of their sockets. But I hit
  him back with all my might. Then he said he refused to let me make a cat and
  dog fight out of it.... Well, that, of course, happened before he told me
  where to get off.... Dad, dear&mdash;Mom darling, this pass that my
  extravagance and stupidity&mdash;and selfishness&mdash;have brought you to,
  has almost broken my heart. I shall make amends. I&rsquo;ll pay it all back.
  I&rsquo;ve wired L. A. and New York, too. I can raise a hundred grand on my
  jewels. I don&rsquo;t need them. I seldom wore Aunt Helen&rsquo;s pearls. I
  shan&rsquo;t miss them.... Dad, will that money save us, with plenty to
  spare?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would&mdash;lass,&rdquo; he replied, a little huskily, and his
  arm tightened round her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, dearest,&rdquo; spoke up her mother, her poise for once
  broken. &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> you would do just this. If Gene had let me tell
  you long ago!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad was trying me out, Mom. It&rsquo;s settled then.... I&rsquo;ve
  had a ghastly lesson. I&rsquo;ll make up for it, my darlings... . Dad, I
  never could hope to be your ideal western girl, nor ever in Mom&rsquo;s class
  as a lady of quality, but I can be a square shooter and I will be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, we might argue over that western girl idea,&rdquo; returned
  Stewart, his dark eyes alight. Her mother folded her in loving arms, and by
  these simple things Madge seemed to grasp a great joy that had almost eluded
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Dad... there&rsquo;s one other thing,&rdquo; said Madge,
  turning in her mother&rsquo;s arms. She essayed to be composed and casual,
  with dubious success. &ldquo;Can I rely on you&mdash;on your keeping Sidway
  here? He&mdash;I.... At least I can thank him&mdash;reward him
  somehow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll be at all
  difficult,&rdquo; replied Stewart, but he did not make clear whether he meant
  keeping Sidway there or rewarding him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost&mdash;happy again,&rdquo; said Madge, yielding to
  tears, &ldquo;but still feel kind of wobbly and I&rsquo;d better&mdash;lie
  down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might be a good idea to talk that matter over with Nels,&rdquo;
  added Stewart, smilingly. &ldquo;He and Sid are thick as hops.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge fled, yearning to ask just what matter her father meant, but she did
  not dare. How perilously close was she to betrayal of her secret! Her
  father&rsquo;s evasive eye and significant words, her mother&rsquo;s softened
  face and restrained sympathy&mdash;these were hard to resist. But Madge had a
  little pride and spirit left. In her room, which had again taken on its old
  tranquillity and speaking silence, she salvaged something of her old
  self.</p>

  <p>Next morning, biding her time, until she had seen Lance and Ren ride away,
  Madge waylaid Nels in his bunkhouse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Majesty! I shore was wonderin&rsquo; when you&rsquo;d remember
  yore old Nels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, I&rsquo;ve never forgotten you,&rdquo; she said, tenderly.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve been knocked out&mdash;and lots on my
  mind.... And I knew when I <i>did</i> see you I&rsquo;d have to talk
  turkey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aboot who, lass? Wal, I reckon I know. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s aboot
  high time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels! He&rsquo;s not leaving?&rdquo; queried Madge, hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he talks aboot it a lot. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s purty sad these
  days. Ren rags him all the time aboot you. Lance says he&rsquo;ll stay till
  Ren an&rsquo; Bonita air married.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Nels! Is that settled?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It shore is. An&rsquo; Ren is one dotty cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy over it.... Oh, what shall I give them? It must be
  something wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, lass, if I had my say, I&rsquo;d want to see another
  marryin&rsquo; pretty pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels!&mdash;You&rsquo;re so sudden. Have a heart!... You
  mean....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, I&rsquo;m confessin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
  Nels, earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; along&mdash;close to seventy.
  An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve had a long full life. Lately my heart has been
  warnin&rsquo; me thet I might not hev long to be heah. An&rsquo; I
  couldn&rsquo;t go satisfied an&rsquo; happy if you wasn&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Nels!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; implored Madge,
  poignantly, and she flew to throw her arms around his neck and lay her face
  against his hollow bristling cheek. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think such a
  thing!&mdash;It&rsquo;d break my heart.&mdash;Nels, you&rsquo;re my second
  dad. You taught me everything.... You must not go away&mdash;and leave
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, honey, I reckon there ain&rsquo;t any reason to be onduly
  scared. I was jest preparin&rsquo; you.... An&rsquo; thet fetches me to the
  somethin&rsquo; nearest my heart. It&rsquo;s this turrible love affair
  between you an&rsquo; Lance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Turrible one-sided.... Yes,&rdquo; choked out Madge, hiding her
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One-sided?&mdash;Not onless you don&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear old Nels!&rdquo; was all she could say, clinging to
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty, the boy is dyin&rsquo; fer you. He&rsquo;s got it wuss
  than I ever seen any boy in all my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; she cried, desperately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, a blind man could see. But, lass, I&rsquo;ll give him
  away&mdash;double-cross him&mdash;if you say his case is not
  hopeless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels&mdash;darling... it&rsquo;s not&mdash;<i>quite</i>
  hopeless,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, thet&rsquo;s fine!&mdash;Wal, Lance has told me time an&rsquo;
  again, an&rsquo; this last time, the other night, he jest cried in his
  misery. It seems you hurt him turrible by believin&rsquo; he was a
  gangster&mdash;a kidnaper&mdash;an&rsquo; Gawd knows what.... Lass, I
  cain&rsquo;t understand how you&mdash;so smart a girl&mdash;could ever make
  thet mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did! I&rsquo;m not smart. But I know <i>now</i>&mdash;and
  <i>that&rsquo;s</i> killing me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he&rsquo;s the finest youngster yore Dad an&rsquo; me ever
  met. Thet&rsquo;s all of thet. An&rsquo; he loves you so much he suffers
  awful. I could tell you the things he does thet&rsquo;d make you ashamed
  an&rsquo; sorry. But this is enough. He told me thet he loved you so much he
  couldn&rsquo;t stay heah an&rsquo; he couldn&rsquo;t leave. Now Majesty,
  I&rsquo;ve told you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve betrayed him. What do you
  say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;much&mdash;when&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  crying.... But I&mdash;I love him more&mdash;than he loves me&mdash;and
  I&rsquo;m dying of longing&mdash;and shame....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s enough, lass,&rdquo; interrupted Nels, vastly
  disturbed by her weeping. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be all right.... What you
  must do is be clear enough to break his pride. He&rsquo;s stubborn as a
  mule.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Break his pride! You mean&mdash;make him confess&mdash;he loves
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sartin I mean thet. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve gotta do somethin&rsquo;
  onheered of an&rsquo; powerful sweet thet won&rsquo;t give him no chance on
  earth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;anything,&rdquo; cried Madge, wildly.
  &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet&rsquo;s more than I can tell. You&rsquo;ll hev to figger
  thet yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything&mdash;anything...&rdquo; Madge repeated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet makes me happy,&rdquo; burst out the old cattleman.
  &ldquo;Majesty, run home now an&rsquo; cudgel yore pretty haid fer a grand
  idee. Somethin&rsquo; onheerd of&mdash;turrible
  lovin&rsquo;&mdash;amazin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sweet thet won&rsquo;t give Lance
  no chance atall. An&rsquo; spring it on him pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You darling old matchmaker&mdash;<i>I will</i>,&rdquo; promised
  Madge, and almost blind with ecstasy, she ran away, up into the solitary
  pines.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>After dinner that night, during which she had been rapturously gay, to the
  wonder and delight of her parents, Madge put on one of her flimsiest, most
  shimmering gowns, with high-heeled white slippers to match. Wearing a long
  dark coat over this she stole forth upon what seemed to her the most
  momentous and thrilling venture of her life.</p>

  <p>She went by the patio and down through the pines by the trail. At this
  hour she knew Nels, her father perhaps, and surely the cowboys, would be at
  the store. As if by magic all her old imperious confidence, tempered this
  time by a secret humility and gratitude and love, returned in full force. She
  could not lose, and that gave a tremendous zest to her venture.</p>

  <p>Her blood raced with her thoughts and her heart throbbed high as she
  gained the level, and like a shadow glided across to the bunkhouses.
  Lance&rsquo;s was next to that occupied by Nels. She tiptoed down the porch,
  close to the wall until she came to Lance&rsquo;s open door. The yellow
  lights of the store cast a glow out upon the open. She heard low voices and
  Sidway&rsquo;s laugh. That gave her pause. Could he be so deeply and
  miserably in love, as Nels had sworn, and laugh like any other fancy-free
  cowboy? What if that sly Nels had framed her? The thought was terrible. But
  nobly she cast it aside as unworthy of a chastened and humble girl. Anyway
  the die was cast.</p>

  <p>Madge took off her clicking high-heeled slippers and stole into
  Lance&rsquo;s room and laid aside the long coat. Feeling around for his chair
  she found it and curled up in it, shaking with excitement. Presently she
  dimly espied her picture on his table, and that overjoyed her.</p>

  <p>It was done. She was there, in his room. Beyond Lance&rsquo;s finding her
  there she had not thought. This was far enough. Of all the things in the
  world, this was the last Lance Sidway would think of. It did not matter much
  what he did, when he found her there, unless he took her by the heels and
  dragged her out. He was capable of that, Madge thought.</p>

  <p>Voices and jingling spurs enjoined silence. The men were approaching.
  Madge would have preferred that Lance came alone. For a moment she fought a
  wild need to laugh. How her blood was gushing through her veins!</p>

  <p>Heavy footfalls upon the porch jarred the log cabin. Madge sat as quietly
  as a mouse, her heart pounding. She hoped Lance would not come to his room
  while the other men were in the bunkhouse. Still, no matter! She did not care
  what happened. Nels had cured her malady. She had all the cards in her
  hands.</p>

  <p>The men, apparently three in number, filed into Nels&rsquo; room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strike a light, Nels,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty darn warm,&rdquo; rejoined Sidway. &ldquo;I
  won&rsquo;t light my lamp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Sid, you won&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; added Nels. &ldquo;Reckon
  you got kind of a glow aboot you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nels, I&rsquo;ve a mind to bounce something off your dome,&rdquo;
  declared the cowboy, irritably, and then he laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I&rsquo;ll smoke one of your cigarettes,&rdquo; said
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>How Madge shook at that laconic epithet given Sidway by her father! Poor
  Lance! They were all in league against him. Not a ghost of a show to
  escape!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;re set,&rdquo; went on her father, seriously.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re determined to ride away tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Gene&mdash;I am,&rdquo; replied Lance, sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a future here for you. This ranch will pay again some
  day. I&rsquo;m glad to tell you that I&rsquo;m going to pull through this
  tough time. Madge is helping me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By God! I <i>knew</i> she would,&rdquo; cried Lance, passionately,
  as if verifying something to a doubtful side of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,
  Gene. It&rsquo;s worried me a lot. Not that it&rsquo;s any of my business....
  She&rsquo;s swell. She&rsquo;s a Stewart, all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had that hunch myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; drawled Nels, &ldquo;I always told you <i>hombres</i>
  thet Majesty was true-blue, a western girl at heart, an&rsquo; one grand
  thoroughbred.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There ensued a momentary silence, during which Madge feared they might
  hear her heart beat, so thickly and swiftly did it pound in her ears.</p>

  <p>Then Stewart spoke: &ldquo;Son, please tell me why you don&rsquo;t want to
  stay here at Majesty&rsquo;s Rancho?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, it can&rsquo;t be possible you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
  retorted Lance. Then his laugh cut a little coldly, with a hopeless note.
  &ldquo;Gene, to come straight out with the truth&mdash;I&rsquo;m so mad over
  your beautiful daughter that I can&rsquo;t stand being any longer where I can
  see her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s blunt and to the point,&rdquo; returned Stewart.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak the same way. I&rsquo;d like you to be my son....
  Have you asked Madge to marry you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens&mdash;no!&rdquo; ground out Sidway, apparently
  tortured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Faint heart never won fair lady! I don&rsquo;t recall
  being very shy with Madeline. Was I, Nels?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge hates the very sight of me,&rdquo; declared Lance,
  abjectly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; declared Stewart, vigorously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I reckon you air wrong aboot thet,&rdquo; drawled Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you fellows will drive me to drink. Let&rsquo;s make an end of
  it. I know you like me, and you&rsquo;ve been swell to me. I love you both.
  But that has nothing to do with it. Madge is the one. And she loathes the
  ground I walk on. It&rsquo;s no wonder. I&rsquo;ve had the rotten luck to
  save her in humiliating circumstances. She is as proud as a princess.
  I&rsquo;ve rubbed her the wrong way. I&rsquo;ve bucked her in everything.
  Perhaps the last straw was her finding out that I had seen her bank
  statements and credits. But that wasn&rsquo;t my fault. Worse than that, my
  knowing about her flirtation with that gangster, Uhl...&rdquo; Suddenly Lance
  broke off, panic in his voice. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you
  that&mdash;to give her away. I could kick myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, you&rsquo;re not giving Madge away. I savvied that. And then
  she told me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She did? Holy cats!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She just casually spoke of it, as if for her it was okay. That has
  been bothering me.... Just how far it went!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Gene, thet doesn&rsquo;t bother me none,&rdquo; drawled
  Nels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it should,&rdquo; flashed Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, one day Majesty talked to me for a long while. She was in one
  of them bare bathin&rsquo; ootfits, an&rsquo; I jest couldn&rsquo;t look at
  her atall. An&rsquo; she got to tellin&rsquo; me aboot the girls an&rsquo;
  boys, an&rsquo; these new modern ways. We air old-fashioned, Gene. An&rsquo;
  this world has moved along. It&rsquo;s changed. Somehow I seemed to savvy
  Majesty, an&rsquo; since thet day nothin&rsquo; she ever did or might do
  could bother me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she confide in her father, too?&rdquo; asked
  Stewart, jealously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, you may not believe it,&rdquo; put in Lance, &ldquo;but Madge
  was afraid of you. Loved you&mdash;craved your respect. I know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. You and Nels are hipped on this girl. You just
  can&rsquo;t see anything wrong....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong,&rdquo; interrupted Sidway, with
  heat, &ldquo;unless we except her flirtations and extravagances. Not in this
  day!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the age to do with it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it has a lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sidway, speak right out, will you?&rdquo; importuned Stewart.
  &ldquo;It seems we three all worship this strange girl. Well, Nels is set and
  safe in his worship. I don&rsquo;t want to embarrass you. I know you&rsquo;d
  lie like a gentleman to protect her. And so would I if I were in your place.
  I love Madge and nothing can change it. Still I wish.... Oh, hell, I
  don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> I want. But it&rsquo;s a deep and bitter need, I
  assure you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again there ensued a silence, except for Nels&rsquo; cough, and the
  tapping of his pipe upon the table, while Madge sat there, strung and tense,
  her heart bursting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gene, I get you,&rdquo; spoke up Lance, with finality. &ldquo;You
  want your old idea of respect back for Madge. I tell you, on my word of
  honor, that you may feel that respect. Madge Stewart has never done one
  single thing that she would hide from you&mdash;that she could not look you
  in the eyes and tell. Sure she is modern, sophisticated. She&rsquo;s a
  college girl. A radical, when it comes to mid-Victorian standards.... But,
  get this, both of you. Even if she had been what you old fogies would call
  bad, it&rsquo;d make no difference. Not to me! Not to anyone who knows her!
  Madge Stewart is like Helen of Troy. Their value is as incomparable and
  incalculable as their beauty, their minds and souls, their great power to
  create love, to give, to be a joy to all who come in contact with
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You win, son,&rdquo; came Stewart&rsquo;s quiet voice, a little
  husky. &ldquo;Then, even if Madge were what you swear she is
  not&mdash;you&rsquo;d make her your wife, if she cared for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;heaven! Gene, you&rsquo;re thickheaded,&rdquo; declared
  Lance in despair. &ldquo;Yes! <i>Yes!</i> And consider myself the luckiest
  fellow in the world&mdash;as I&rsquo;d be the happiest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Madge could not bear any more. Slipping out of the chair she picked up her
  slippers, and softly went outside, to appear in the open doorway of
  Nels&rsquo; room. She paused a moment, then entered.</p>

  <p>The smile of beatitude that shone resplendent on Nels&rsquo; visage, the
  sudden sinking of Stewart into a chair, as if his legs had suddenly grown
  weak, and Sidway&rsquo;s backing into the wall for support,&mdash;these
  reactions sustained Madge in this emotional climax of her life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad&mdash;Nels&mdash;Lance, did I happen in opportunely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge! Where did you come from?&rdquo; demanded Stewart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Lance&rsquo;s room. I&rsquo;ve been in there listening to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!... Are you crazy, girl?&mdash;What were you
  doing there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Waiting for Lance. I&rsquo;d framed a little stunt. But
  you&rsquo;ve upset it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And what were you going to do&mdash;when he came?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea. But I know now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She approached Sidway, in so poignant a joy and surety of her power to
  bestow happiness, that his pale and working face did not deter her from
  prolonging his torture a little longer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lance, if I don&rsquo;t put on my slippers I won&rsquo;t be so
  tall, and I can look up to you better. See!&rdquo; And dropping them she
  stepped closer, to look up into his eyes.</p>

  <p>He stood like a statue, his gaze somber and unbelieving. But her glance
  quickly descended to his vest, where her hands, quivering almost
  imperceptibly, touched the frayed edge, and a spot that lacked a button. She
  was not quite ready yet to let him read what her eyes would surely say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you need someone to look after you,&rdquo; she went on,
  sweetly. &ldquo;Did you know I could make buttonholes and sew on
  buttons?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine it,&rdquo; he returned hoarsely.
  &ldquo;Did you learn that in college?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother taught me.... I can mend socks, too. And make my own
  clothes, and I know how to cook and bake, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;a&mdash;remarkably accomplished&mdash;young
  lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I wondered if you had found it out.... Are you
  interested in my waiting for you&mdash;in your room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Evidently it was utterly impossible for Lance to answer that. He divined
  something his intelligence repudiated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, as a matter of fact, I forgot. You and Dad and Nels spoiled
  my plot. Let&rsquo;s skip it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She began to slide her gold-tan hands up the edges of his vest, and her
  eyes traveled with them. Then, in a flash, her arms encircled his neck, and
  she gave him her eyes, with all her heart and soul in them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have much to thank you for,&rdquo; she said, eloquently.
  &ldquo;But even more than for my very life. I want to thank you for what you
  told Dad just now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge, please&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he rejoined, unsteadily.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re excited again.... I don&rsquo;t want thanks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wrong again, darl... No, darling is out. I must find another
  word.... Lance, I&rsquo;m not excited. Just in a transport,&rdquo; and her
  hands slipped by one another, so that in another moment her arms were
  clasping his neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you that I might have fallen in love with you
  at first sight&mdash;that day at the campus in L. A.?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&mdash;certainly&mdash;didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I did. And then wondering where you were, and if I could find
  you again, and then discovering you here where we have misunderstood each
  other and fought like cat and dog&mdash;all this while, Lance, it&rsquo;s
  grown worse, until I&rsquo;m dying more for you than you are for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madge&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for my sake... .&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for all our sakes, but mine mostly. Lance, I need more
  than you need.... Aren&rsquo;t you going to hug me? Can&rsquo;t you see the
  real thing? Can&rsquo;t you take it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!... Gene&mdash;Nels, get her away,&rdquo; he implored, hoarsely,
  his face the hue of ashes. &ldquo;She is getting even with me. It&rsquo;s her
  revenge.... She&rsquo;s acting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, a moment or so ago you very chivalrously championed this
  girl,&rdquo; declared Stewart, with a rare smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a hunch
  she&rsquo;s serious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Lance, I reckon you better believe her&mdash;an&rsquo; take
  it&mdash;an&rsquo; hug her all to oncet,&rdquo; drawled Nels, supremely
  nonchalant. &ldquo;Com-mon, Gene.&rdquo; The two walked out, but Madge was
  beyond noticing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Lance,&rdquo; she began again, lifting her lips until they
  were close to his. &ldquo;If I should happen to throw another party&mdash;a
  <i>wedding</i> party, for instance&mdash;there would not be any punch.
  And....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait! Give me&mdash;a break!&rdquo; he panted, his arms encircling
  her, and almost crushing the breath out of her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you&mdash;a break,&rdquo; she whispered.
  &ldquo;Only&mdash;don&rsquo;t break&mdash;my ribs.&rdquo; She could no longer
  endure the beseeching incredulous love light in his eyes, and hastened to her
  surrender.</p>

  <p>She felt her willful spirit fading away in a deep and overpowering
  rapture, and the kiss she gave him almost prevented one last expression of
  her mischievous self.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sweetheart. You know I swore I&rsquo;d have Umpqua,&rdquo; she
  said, softly, at his lips.</p>

  <p>He drew back startled, with questioning eyes. &ldquo;Darling, you
  couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;so&mdash;so,&rdquo; he replied, huskily...
  &ldquo;just to make me give you Umpqua?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that oughtn&rsquo;t be so hard&mdash;giving Umpqua&mdash;along
  with yourself,&rdquo; she whispered, tremulously, and as she blindly sought
  his lips again, it seemed the end of their travail.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Majesty!... You can have him&mdash;and me forever,&rdquo; he said,
  with incredulous bliss. &ldquo;I adored you... my heart was broken. ... But
  I&rsquo;d live it all over again&mdash;for this!&rdquo;</p>
