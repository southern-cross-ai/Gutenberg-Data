<h2>Chapter I</h2>

<p>A very little boy stood upon a heap of gravel for the honor of
Rum Alley. He was throwing stones at howling urchins from Devil's
Row who were circling madly about the heap and pelting at him.</p>

<p>His infantile countenance was livid with fury. His small body
was writhing in the delivery of great, crimson oaths.</p>

<p>"Run, Jimmie, run! Dey'll get yehs," screamed a retreating Rum
Alley child.</p>

<p>"Naw," responded Jimmie with a valiant roar, "dese micks can't
make me run."</p>

<p>Howls of renewed wrath went up from Devil's Row throats.
Tattered gamins on the right made a furious assault on the gravel
heap. On their small, convulsed faces there shone the grins of true
assassins. As they charged, they threw stones and cursed in shrill
chorus.</p>

<p>The little champion of Rum Alley stumbled precipitately down the
other side. His coat had been torn to shreds in a scuffle, and his
hat was gone. He had bruises on twenty parts of his body, and blood
was dripping from a cut in his head. His wan features wore a look
of a tiny, insane demon.</p>

<p>On the ground, children from Devil's Row closed in on their
antagonist. He crooked his left arm defensively about his head and
fought with cursing fury. The little boys ran to and fro, dodging,
hurling stones and swearing in barbaric trebles.</p>

<p>From a window of an apartment house that upreared its form from
amid squat, ignorant stables, there leaned a curious woman. Some
laborers, unloading a scow at a dock at the river, paused for a
moment and regarded the fight. The engineer of a passive tugboat
hung lazily to a railing and watched. Over on the Island, a worm of
yellow convicts came from the shadow of a building and crawled
slowly along the river's bank.</p>

<p>A stone had smashed into Jimmie's mouth. Blood was bubbling over
his chin and down upon his ragged shirt. Tears made furrows on his
dirt-stained cheeks. His thin legs had begun to tremble and turn
weak, causing his small body to reel. His roaring curses of the
first part of the fight had changed to a blasphemous chatter.</p>

<p>In the yells of the whirling mob of Devil's Row children there
were notes of joy like songs of triumphant savagery. The little
boys seemed to leer gloatingly at the blood upon the other child's
face.</p>

<p>Down the avenue came boastfully sauntering a lad of sixteen
years, although the chronic sneer of an ideal manhood already sat
upon his lips. His hat was tipped with an air of challenge over his
eye. Between his teeth, a cigar stump was tilted at the angle of
defiance. He walked with a certain swing of the shoulders which
appalled the timid. He glanced over into the vacant lot in which
the little raving boys from Devil's Row seethed about the shrieking
and tearful child from Rum Alley.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he murmured with interest. "A scrap. Gee!"</p>

<p>He strode over to the cursing circle, swinging his shoulders in
a manner which denoted that he held victory in his fists. He
approached at the back of one of the most deeply engaged of the
Devil's Row children.</p>

<p>"Ah, what deh hell," he said, and smote the deeply-engaged one
on the back of the head. The little boy fell to the ground and gave
a hoarse, tremendous howl. He scrambled to his feet, and
perceiving, evidently, the size of his assailant, ran quickly off,
shouting alarms. The entire Devil's Row party followed him. They
came to a stand a short distance away and yelled taunting oaths at
the boy with the chronic sneer. The latter, momentarily, paid no
attention to them.</p>

<p>"What deh hell, Jimmie?" he asked of the small champion.</p>

<p>Jimmie wiped his blood-wet features with his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Well, it was dis way, Pete, see! I was goin' teh lick dat Riley
kid and dey all pitched on me."</p>

<p>Some Rum Alley children now came forward. The party stood for a
moment exchanging vainglorious remarks with Devil's Row. A few
stones were thrown at long distances, and words of challenge passed
between small warriors. Then the Rum Alley contingent turned slowly
in the direction of their home street. They began to give, each to
each, distorted versions of the fight. Causes of retreat in
particular cases were magnified. Blows dealt in the fight were
enlarged to catapultian power, and stones thrown were alleged to
have hurtled with infinite accuracy. Valor grew strong again, and
the little boys began to swear with great spirit.</p>

<p>"Ah, we blokies kin lick deh hull damn Row," said a child,
swaggering.</p>

<p>Little Jimmie was striving to stanch the flow of blood from his
cut lips. Scowling, he turned upon the speaker.</p>

<p>"Ah, where deh hell was yeh when I was doin' all deh fightin?"
he demanded. "Youse kids makes me tired."</p>

<p>"Ah, go ahn," replied the other argumentatively.</p>

<p>Jimmie replied with heavy contempt. "Ah, youse can't fight, Blue
Billie! I kin lick yeh wid one han'."</p>

<p>"Ah, go ahn," replied Billie again.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Jimmie threateningly.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the other in the same tone.</p>

<p>They struck at each other, clinched, and rolled over on the
cobble stones.</p>

<p>"Smash 'im, Jimmie, kick deh damn guts out of 'im," yelled Pete,
the lad with the chronic sneer, in tones of delight.</p>

<p>The small combatants pounded and kicked, scratched and tore.
They began to weep and their curses struggled in their throats with
sobs. The other little boys clasped their hands and wriggled their
legs in excitement. They formed a bobbing circle about the
pair.</p>

<p>A tiny spectator was suddenly agitated.</p>

<p>"Cheese it, Jimmie, cheese it! Here comes yer fader," he
yelled.</p>

<p>The circle of little boys instantly parted. They drew away and
waited in ecstatic awe for that which was about to happen. The two
little boys fighting in the modes of four thousand years ago, did
not hear the warning.</p>

<p>Up the avenue there plodded slowly a man with sullen eyes. He
was carrying a dinner pail and smoking an apple-wood pipe.</p>

<p>As he neared the spot where the little boys strove, he regarded
them listlessly. But suddenly he roared an oath and advanced upon
the rolling fighters.</p>

<p>"Here, you Jim, git up, now, while I belt yer life out, you
damned disorderly brat."</p>

<p>He began to kick into the chaotic mass on the ground. The boy
Billie felt a heavy boot strike his head. He made a furious effort
and disentangled himself from Jimmie. He tottered away,
damning.</p>

<p>Jimmie arose painfully from the ground and confronting his
father, began to curse him. His parent kicked him. "Come home,
now," he cried, "an' stop yer jawin', er I'll lam the everlasting
head off yehs."</p>

<p>They departed. The man paced placidly along with the apple-wood
emblem of serenity between his teeth. The boy followed a dozen feet
in the rear. He swore luridly, for he felt that it was degradation
for one who aimed to be some vague soldier, or a man of blood with
a sort of sublime license, to be taken home by a father.</p>

<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<p>Eventually they entered into a dark region where, from a
careening building, a dozen gruesome doorways gave up loads of
babies to the street and the gutter. A wind of early autumn raised
yellow dust from cobbles and swirled it against an hundred windows.
Long streamers of garments fluttered from fire-escapes. In all
unhandy places there were buckets, brooms, rags and bottles. In the
street infants played or fought with other infants or sat stupidly
in the way of vehicles. Formidable women, with uncombed hair and
disordered dress, gossiped while leaning on railings, or screamed
in frantic quarrels. Withered persons, in curious postures of
submission to something, sat smoking pipes in obscure corners. A
thousand odors of cooking food came forth to the street. The
building quivered and creaked from the weight of humanity stamping
about in its bowels.</p>

<p>A small ragged girl dragged a red, bawling infant along the
crowded ways. He was hanging back, baby-like, bracing his wrinkled,
bare legs.</p>

<p>The little girl cried out: "Ah, Tommie, come ahn. Dere's Jimmie
and fader. Don't be a-pullin' me back."</p>

<p>She jerked the baby's arm impatiently. He fell on his face,
roaring. With a second jerk she pulled him to his feet, and they
went on. With the obstinacy of his order, he protested against
being dragged in a chosen direction. He made heroic endeavors to
keep on his legs, denounce his sister and consume a bit of orange
peeling which he chewed between the times of his infantile
orations.</p>

<p>As the sullen-eyed man, followed by the blood-covered boy, drew
near, the little girl burst into reproachful cries. "Ah, Jimmie,
youse bin fightin' agin."</p>

<p>The urchin swelled disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Ah, what deh hell, Mag. See?"</p>

<p>The little girl upbraided him, "Youse allus fightin', Jimmie,
an' yeh knows it puts mudder out when yehs come home half dead, an'
it's like we'll all get a poundin'."</p>

<p>She began to weep. The babe threw back his head and roared at
his prospects.</p>

<p>"Ah, what deh hell!" cried Jimmie. "Shut up er I'll smack yer
mout'. See?"</p>

<p>As his sister continued her lamentations, he suddenly swore and
struck her. The little girl reeled and, recovering herself, burst
into tears and quaveringly cursed him. As she slowly retreated her
brother advanced dealing her cuffs. The father heard and turned
about.</p>

<p>"Stop that, Jim, d'yeh hear? Leave yer sister alone on the
street. It's like I can never beat any sense into yer damned wooden
head."</p>

<p>The urchin raised his voice in defiance to his parent and
continued his attacks. The babe bawled tremendously, protesting
with great violence. During his sister's hasty manoeuvres, he was
dragged by the arm.</p>

<p>Finally the procession plunged into one of the gruesome
doorways. They crawled up dark stairways and along cold, gloomy
halls. At last the father pushed open a door and they entered a
lighted room in which a large woman was rampant.</p>

<p>She stopped in a career from a seething stove to a pan-covered
table. As the father and children filed in she peered at them.</p>

<p>"Eh, what? Been fightin' agin, by Gawd!" She threw herself upon
Jimmie. The urchin tried to dart behind the others and in the
scuffle the babe, Tommie, was knocked down. He protested with his
usual vehemence, because they had bruised his tender shins against
a table leg.</p>

<p>The mother's massive shoulders heaved with anger. Grasping the
urchin by the neck and shoulder she shook him until he rattled. She
dragged him to an unholy sink, and, soaking a rag in water, began
to scrub his lacerated face with it. Jimmie screamed in pain and
tried to twist his shoulders out of the clasp of the huge arms.</p>

<p>The babe sat on the floor watching the scene, his face in
contortions like that of a woman at a tragedy. The father, with a
newly-ladened pipe in his mouth, crouched on a backless chair near
the stove. Jimmie's cries annoyed him. He turned about and bellowed
at his wife:</p>

<p>"Let the damned kid alone for a minute, will yeh, Mary? Yer
allus poundin' 'im. When I come nights I can't git no rest 'cause
yer allus poundin' a kid. Let up, d'yeh hear? Don't be allus
poundin' a kid."</p>

<p>The woman's operations on the urchin instantly increased in
violence. At last she tossed him to a corner where he limply lay
cursing and weeping.</p>

<p>The wife put her immense hands on her hips and with a
chieftain-like stride approached her husband.</p>

<p>"Ho," she said, with a great grunt of contempt. "An' what in the
devil are you stickin' your nose for?"</p>

<p>The babe crawled under the table and, turning, peered out
cautiously. The ragged girl retreated and the urchin in the corner
drew his legs carefully beneath him.</p>

<p>The man puffed his pipe calmly and put his great mudded boots on
the back part of the stove.</p>

<p>"Go teh hell," he murmured, tranquilly.</p>

<p>The woman screamed and shook her fists before her husband's
eyes. The rough yellow of her face and neck flared suddenly
crimson. She began to howl.</p>

<p>He puffed imperturbably at his pipe for a time, but finally
arose and began to look out at the window into the darkening chaos
of back yards.</p>

<p>"You've been drinkin', Mary," he said. "You'd better let up on
the bot', ol' woman, or you'll git done."</p>

<p>"You're a liar. I ain't had a drop," she roared in reply.</p>

<p>They had a lurid altercation, in which they damned each other's
souls with frequence.</p>

<p>The babe was staring out from under the table, his small face
working in his excitement.</p>

<p>The ragged girl went stealthily over to the corner where the
urchin lay.</p>

<p>"Are yehs hurted much, Jimmie?" she whispered timidly.</p>

<p>"Not a damn bit! See?" growled the little boy.</p>

<p>"Will I wash deh blood?"</p>

<p>"Naw!"</p>

<p>"Will I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When I catch dat Riley kid I'll break 'is face! Dat's right!
See?"</p>

<p>He turned his face to the wall as if resolved to grimly bide his
time.</p>

<p>In the quarrel between husband and wife, the woman was victor.
The man grabbed his hat and rushed from the room, apparently
determined upon a vengeful drunk. She followed to the door and
thundered at him as he made his way down stairs.</p>

<p>She returned and stirred up the room until her children were
bobbing about like bubbles.</p>

<p>"Git outa deh way," she persistently bawled, waving feet with
their dishevelled shoes near the heads of her children. She
shrouded herself, puffing and snorting, in a cloud of steam at the
stove, and eventually extracted a frying-pan full of potatoes that
hissed.</p>

<p>She flourished it. "Come teh yer suppers, now," she cried with
sudden exasperation. "Hurry up, now, er I'll help yeh!"</p>

<p>The children scrambled hastily. With prodigious clatter they
arranged themselves at table. The babe sat with his feet dangling
high from a precarious infant chair and gorged his small stomach.
Jimmie forced, with feverish rapidity, the grease-enveloped pieces
between his wounded lips. Maggie, with side glances of fear of
interruption, ate like a small pursued tigress.</p>

<p>The mother sat blinking at them. She delivered reproaches,
swallowed potatoes and drank from a yellow-brown bottle. After a
time her mood changed and she wept as she carried little Tommie
into another room and laid him to sleep with his fists doubled in
an old quilt of faded red and green grandeur. Then she came and
moaned by the stove. She rocked to and fro upon a chair, shedding
tears and crooning miserably to the two children about their "poor
mother" and "yer fader, damn 'is soul."</p>

<p>The little girl plodded between the table and the chair with a
dish-pan on it. She tottered on her small legs beneath burdens of
dishes.</p>

<p>Jimmie sat nursing his various wounds. He cast furtive glances
at his mother. His practised eye perceived her gradually emerge
from a muddled mist of sentiment until her brain burned in drunken
heat. He sat breathless.</p>

<p>Maggie broke a plate.</p>

<p>The mother started to her feet as if propelled.</p>

<p>"Good Gawd," she howled. Her eyes glittered on her child with
sudden hatred. The fervent red of her face turned almost to purple.
The little boy ran to the halls, shrieking like a monk in an
earthquake.</p>

<p>He floundered about in darkness until he found the stairs. He
stumbled, panic-stricken, to the next floor. An old woman opened a
door. A light behind her threw a flare on the urchin's quivering
face.</p>

<p>"Eh, Gawd, child, what is it dis time? Is yer fader beatin' yer
mudder, or yer mudder beatin' yer fader?"</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<p>Jimmie and the old woman listened long in the hall. Above the
muffled roar of conversation, the dismal wailings of babies at
night, the thumping of feet in unseen corridors and rooms, mingled
with the sound of varied hoarse shoutings in the street and the
rattling of wheels over cobbles, they heard the screams of the
child and the roars of the mother die away to a feeble moaning and
a subdued bass muttering.</p>

<p>The old woman was a gnarled and leathery personage who could
don, at will, an expression of great virtue. She possessed a small
music-box capable of one tune, and a collection of "God bless yehs"
pitched in assorted keys of fervency. Each day she took a position
upon the stones of Fifth Avenue, where she crooked her legs under
her and crouched immovable and hideous, like an idol. She received
daily a small sum in pennies. It was contributed, for the most
part, by persons who did not make their homes in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Once, when a lady had dropped her purse on the sidewalk, the
gnarled woman had grabbed it and smuggled it with great dexterity
beneath her cloak. When she was arrested she had cursed the lady
into a partial swoon, and with her aged limbs, twisted from
rheumatism, had almost kicked the stomach out of a huge policeman
whose conduct upon that occasion she referred to when she said:
"The police, damn 'em."</p>

<p>"Eh, Jimmie, it's cursed shame," she said. "Go, now, like a dear
an' buy me a can, an' if yer mudder raises 'ell all night yehs can
sleep here."</p>

<p>Jimmie took a tendered tin-pail and seven pennies and departed.
He passed into the side door of a saloon and went to the bar.
Straining up on his toes he raised the pail and pennies as high as
his arms would let him. He saw two hands thrust down and take them.
Directly the same hands let down the filled pail and he left.</p>

<p>In front of the gruesome doorway he met a lurching figure. It
was his father, swaying about on uncertain legs.</p>

<p>"Give me deh can. See?" said the man, threateningly.</p>

<p>"Ah, come off! I got dis can fer dat ol' woman an' it 'ud be
dirt teh swipe it. See?" cried Jimmie.</p>

<p>The father wrenched the pail from the urchin. He grasped it in
both hands and lifted it to his mouth. He glued his lips to the
under edge and tilted his head. His hairy throat swelled until it
seemed to grow near his chin. There was a tremendous gulping
movement and the beer was gone.</p>

<p>The man caught his breath and laughed. He hit his son on the
head with the empty pail. As it rolled clanging into the street,
Jimmie began to scream and kicked repeatedly at his father's
shins.</p>

<p>"Look at deh dirt what yeh done me," he yelled. "Deh ol' woman
'ill be raisin' hell."</p>

<p>He retreated to the middle of the street, but the man did not
pursue. He staggered toward the door.</p>

<p>"I'll club hell outa yeh when I ketch yeh," he shouted, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>During the evening he had been standing against a bar drinking
whiskies and declaring to all comers, confidentially: "My home
reg'lar livin' hell! Damndes' place! Reg'lar hell! Why do I come
an' drin' whisk' here thish way? 'Cause home reg'lar livin'
hell!"</p>

<p>Jimmie waited a long time in the street and then crept warily up
through the building. He passed with great caution the door of the
gnarled woman, and finally stopped outside his home and
listened.</p>

<p>He could hear his mother moving heavily about among the
furniture of the room. She was chanting in a mournful voice,
occasionally interjecting bursts of volcanic wrath at the father,
who, Jimmie judged, had sunk down on the floor or in a corner.</p>

<p>"Why deh blazes don' chere try teh keep Jim from fightin'? I'll
break her jaw," she suddenly bellowed.</p>

<p>The man mumbled with drunken indifference. "Ah, wha' deh hell.
W'a's odds? Wha' makes kick?"</p>

<p>"Because he tears 'is clothes, yeh damn fool," cried the woman
in supreme wrath.</p>

<p>The husband seemed to become aroused. "Go teh hell," he
thundered fiercely in reply. There was a crash against the door and
something broke into clattering fragments. Jimmie partially
suppressed a howl and darted down the stairway. Below he paused and
listened. He heard howls and curses, groans and shrieks,
confusingly in chorus as if a battle were raging. With all was the
crash of splintering furniture. The eyes of the urchin glared in
fear that one of them would discover him.</p>

<p>Curious faces appeared in doorways, and whispered comments
passed to and fro. "Ol' Johnson's raisin' hell agin."</p>

<p>Jimmie stood until the noises ceased and the other inhabitants
of the tenement had all yawned and shut their doors. Then he
crawled upstairs with the caution of an invader of a panther den.
Sounds of labored breathing came through the broken door-panels. He
pushed the door open and entered, quaking.</p>

<p>A glow from the fire threw red hues over the bare floor, the
cracked and soiled plastering, and the overturned and broken
furniture.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor lay his mother asleep. In one corner
of the room his father's limp body hung across the seat of a
chair.</p>

<p>The urchin stole forward. He began to shiver in dread of
awakening his parents. His mother's great chest was heaving
painfully. Jimmie paused and looked down at her. Her face was
inflamed and swollen from drinking. Her yellow brows shaded eyelids
that had brown blue. Her tangled hair tossed in waves over her
forehead. Her mouth was set in the same lines of vindictive hatred
that it had, perhaps, borne during the fight. Her bare, red arms
were thrown out above her head in positions of exhaustion,
something, mayhap, like those of a sated villain.</p>

<p>The urchin bended over his mother. He was fearful lest she
should open her eyes, and the dread within him was so strong, that
he could not forbear to stare, but hung as if fascinated over the
woman's grim face.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes opened. The urchin found himself looking
straight into that expression, which, it would seem, had the power
to change his blood to salt. He howled piercingly and fell
backward.</p>

<p>The woman floundered for a moment, tossed her arms about her
head as if in combat, and again began to snore.</p>

<p>Jimmie crawled back in the shadows and waited. A noise in the
next room had followed his cry at the discovery that his mother was
awake. He grovelled in the gloom, the eyes from out his drawn face
riveted upon the intervening door.</p>

<p>He heard it creak, and then the sound of a small voice came to
him. "Jimmie! Jimmie! Are yehs dere?" it whispered. The urchin
started. The thin, white face of his sister looked at him from the
door-way of the other room. She crept to him across the floor.</p>

<p>The father had not moved, but lay in the same death-like sleep.
The mother writhed in uneasy slumber, her chest wheezing as if she
were in the agonies of strangulation. Out at the window a florid
moon was peering over dark roofs, and in the distance the waters of
a river glimmered pallidly.</p>

<p>The small frame of the ragged girl was quivering. Her features
were haggard from weeping, and her eyes gleamed from fear. She
grasped the urchin's arm in her little trembling hands and they
huddled in a corner. The eyes of both were drawn, by some force, to
stare at the woman's face, for they thought she need only to awake
and all fiends would come from below.</p>

<p>They crouched until the ghost-mists of dawn appeared at the
window, drawing close to the panes, and looking in at the
prostrate, heaving body of the mother.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV</h2>

<p>The babe, Tommie, died. He went away in a white, insignificant
coffin, his small waxen hand clutching a flower that the girl,
Maggie, had stolen from an Italian.</p>

<p>She and Jimmie lived.</p>

<p>The inexperienced fibres of the boy's eyes were hardened at an
early age. He became a young man of leather. He lived some red
years without laboring. During that time his sneer became chronic.
He studied human nature in the gutter, and found it no worse than
he thought he had reason to believe it. He never conceived a
respect for the world, because he had begun with no idols that it
had smashed.</p>

<p>He clad his soul in armor by means of happening hilariously in
at a mission church where a man composed his sermons of "yous."
While they got warm at the stove, he told his hearers just where he
calculated they stood with the Lord. Many of the sinners were
impatient over the pictured depths of their degradation. They were
waiting for soup-tickets.</p>

<p>A reader of words of wind-demons might have been able to see the
portions of a dialogue pass to and fro between the exhorter and his
hearers.</p>

<p>"You are damned," said the preacher. And the reader of sounds
might have seen the reply go forth from the ragged people: "Where's
our soup?"</p>

<p>Jimmie and a companion sat in a rear seat and commented upon the
things that didn't concern them, with all the freedom of English
gentlemen. When they grew thirsty and went out their minds confused
the speaker with Christ.</p>

<p>Momentarily, Jimmie was sullen with thoughts of a hopeless
altitude where grew fruit. His companion said that if he should
ever meet God he would ask for a million dollars and a bottle of
beer.</p>

<p>Jimmie's occupation for a long time was to stand on
streetcorners and watch the world go by, dreaming blood-red dreams
at the passing of pretty women. He menaced mankind at the
intersections of streets.</p>

<p>On the corners he was in life and of life. The world was going
on and he was there to perceive it.</p>

<p>He maintained a belligerent attitude toward all well-dressed
men. To him fine raiment was allied to weakness, and all good coats
covered faint hearts. He and his order were kings, to a certain
extent, over the men of untarnished clothes, because these latter
dreaded, perhaps, to be either killed or laughed at.</p>

<p>Above all things he despised obvious Christians and ciphers with
the chrysanthemums of aristocracy in their button-holes. He
considered himself above both of these classes. He was afraid of
neither the devil nor the leader of society.</p>

<p>When he had a dollar in his pocket his satisfaction with
existence was the greatest thing in the world. So, eventually, he
felt obliged to work. His father died and his mother's years were
divided up into periods of thirty days.</p>

<p>He became a truck driver. He was given the charge of a
painstaking pair of horses and a large rattling truck. He invaded
the turmoil and tumble of the down-town streets and learned to
breathe maledictory defiance at the police who occasionally used to
climb up, drag him from his perch and beat him.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the city he daily involved himself in
hideous tangles. If he and his team chanced to be in the rear he
preserved a demeanor of serenity, crossing his legs and bursting
forth into yells when foot passengers took dangerous dives beneath
the noses of his champing horses. He smoked his pipe calmly for he
knew that his pay was marching on.</p>

<p>If in the front and the key-truck of chaos, he entered
terrifically into the quarrel that was raging to and fro among the
drivers on their high seats, and sometimes roared oaths and
violently got himself arrested.</p>

<p>After a time his sneer grew so that it turned its glare upon all
things. He became so sharp that he believed in nothing. To him the
police were always actuated by malignant impulses and the rest of
the world was composed, for the most part, of despicable creatures
who were all trying to take advantage of him and with whom, in
defense, he was obliged to quarrel on all possible occasions. He
himself occupied a down-trodden position that had a private but
distinct element of grandeur in its isolation.</p>

<p>The most complete cases of aggravated idiocy were, to his mind,
rampant upon the front platforms of all the street cars. At first
his tongue strove with these beings, but he eventually was
superior. He became immured like an African cow. In him grew a
majestic contempt for those strings of street cars that followed
him like intent bugs.</p>

<p>He fell into the habit, when starting on a long journey, of
fixing his eye on a high and distant object, commanding his horses
to begin, and then going into a sort of a trance of observation.
Multitudes of drivers might howl in his rear, and passengers might
load him with opprobrium, he would not awaken until some blue
policeman turned red and began to frenziedly tear bridles and beat
the soft noses of the responsible horses.</p>

<p>When he paused to contemplate the attitude of the police toward
himself and his fellows, he believed that they were the only men in
the city who had no rights. When driving about, he felt that he was
held liable by the police for anything that might occur in the
streets, and was the common prey of all energetic officials. In
revenge, he resolved never to move out of the way of anything,
until formidable circumstances, or a much larger man than himself
forced him to it.</p>

<p>Foot-passengers were mere pestering flies with an insane
disregard for their legs and his convenience. He could not conceive
their maniacal desires to cross the streets. Their madness smote
him with eternal amazement. He was continually storming at them
from his throne. He sat aloft and denounced their frantic leaps,
plunges, dives and straddles.</p>

<p>When they would thrust at, or parry, the noses of his champing
horses, making them swing their heads and move their feet,
disturbing a solid dreamy repose, he swore at the men as fools, for
he himself could perceive that Providence had caused it clearly to
be written, that he and his team had the unalienable right to stand
in the proper path of the sun chariot, and if they so minded,
obstruct its mission or take a wheel off.</p>

<p>And, perhaps, if the god-driver had an ungovernable desire to
step down, put up his flame-colored fists and manfully dispute the
right of way, he would have probably been immediately opposed by a
scowling mortal with two sets of very hard knuckles.</p>

<p>It is possible, perhaps, that this young man would have derided,
in an axle-wide alley, the approach of a flying ferry boat. Yet he
achieved a respect for a fire engine. As one charged toward his
truck, he would drive fearfully upon a sidewalk, threatening untold
people with annihilation. When an engine would strike a mass of
blocked trucks, splitting it into fragments, as a blow annihilates
a cake of ice, Jimmie's team could usually be observed high and
safe, with whole wheels, on the sidewalk. The fearful coming of the
engine could break up the most intricate muddle of heavy vehicles
at which the police had been swearing for the half of an hour.</p>

<p>A fire engine was enshrined in his heart as an appalling thing
that he loved with a distant dog-like devotion. They had been known
to overturn street-cars. Those leaping horses, striking sparks from
the cobbles in their forward lunge, were creatures to be ineffably
admired. The clang of the gong pierced his breast like a noise of
remembered war.</p>

<p>When Jimmie was a little boy, he began to be arrested. Before he
reached a great age, he had a fair record.</p>

<p>He developed too great a tendency to climb down from his truck
and fight with other drivers. He had been in quite a number of
miscellaneous fights, and in some general barroom rows that had
become known to the police. Once he had been arrested for
assaulting a Chinaman. Two women in different parts of the city,
and entirely unknown to each other, caused him considerable
annoyance by breaking forth, simultaneously, at fateful intervals,
into wailings about marriage and support and infants.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he had, on a certain star-lit evening, said
wonderingly and quite reverently: "Deh moon looks like hell, don't
it?"</p>

<h2>Chapter V</h2>

<p>The girl, Maggie, blossomed in a mud puddle. She grew to be a
most rare and wonderful production of a tenement district, a pretty
girl.</p>

<p>None of the dirt of Rum Alley seemed to be in her veins. The
philosophers up-stairs, down-stairs and on the same floor, puzzled
over it.</p>

<p>When a child, playing and fighting with gamins in the street,
dirt disguised her. Attired in tatters and grime, she went
unseen.</p>

<p>There came a time, however, when the young men of the vicinity
said: "Dat Johnson goil is a puty good looker." About this period
her brother remarked to her: "Mag, I'll tell yeh dis! See? Yeh've
edder got teh go teh hell or go teh work!" Whereupon she went to
work, having the feminine aversion of going to hell.</p>

<p>By a chance, she got a position in an establishment where they
made collars and cuffs. She received a stool and a machine in a
room where sat twenty girls of various shades of yellow discontent.
She perched on the stool and treadled at her machine all day,
turning out collars, the name of whose brand could be noted for its
irrelevancy to anything in connection with collars. At night she
returned home to her mother.</p>

<p>Jimmie grew large enough to take the vague position of head of
the family. As incumbent of that office, he stumbled up-stairs late
at night, as his father had done before him. He reeled about the
room, swearing at his relations, or went to sleep on the floor.</p>

<p>The mother had gradually arisen to that degree of fame that she
could bandy words with her acquaintances among the police-justices.
Court-officials called her by her first name. When she appeared
they pursued a course which had been theirs for months. They
invariably grinned and cried out: "Hello, Mary, you here again?"
Her grey head wagged in many a court. She always besieged the bench
with voluble excuses, explanations, apologies and prayers. Her
flaming face and rolling eyes were a sort of familiar sight on the
island. She measured time by means of sprees, and was eternally
swollen and dishevelled.</p>

<p>One day the young man, Pete, who as a lad had smitten the
Devil's Row urchin in the back of the head and put to flight the
antagonists of his friend, Jimmie, strutted upon the scene. He met
Jimmie one day on the street, promised to take him to a boxing
match in Williamsburg, and called for him in the evening.</p>

<p>Maggie observed Pete.</p>

<p>He sat on a table in the Johnson home and dangled his checked
legs with an enticing nonchalance. His hair was curled down over
his forehead in an oiled bang. His rather pugged nose seemed to
revolt from contact with a bristling moustache of short, wire-like
hairs. His blue double-breasted coat, edged with black braid,
buttoned close to a red puff tie, and his patent-leather shoes
looked like murder-fitted weapons.</p>

<p>His mannerisms stamped him as a man who had a correct sense of
his personal superiority. There was valor and contempt for
circumstances in the glance of his eye. He waved his hands like a
man of the world, who dismisses religion and philosophy, and says
"Fudge." He had certainly seen everything and with each curl of his
lip, he declared that it amounted to nothing. Maggie thought he
must be a very elegant and graceful bartender.</p>

<p>He was telling tales to Jimmie.</p>

<p>Maggie watched him furtively, with half-closed eyes, lit with a
vague interest.</p>

<p>"Hully gee! Dey makes me tired," he said. "Mos' e'ry day some
farmer comes in an' tries teh run deh shop. See? But dey gits
t'rowed right out! I jolt dem right out in deh street before dey
knows where dey is! See?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Dere was a mug come in deh place deh odder day wid an idear he
wus goin' teh own deh place! Hully gee, he wus goin' teh own deh
place! I see he had a still on an' I didn' wanna giv 'im no stuff,
so I says: 'Git deh hell outa here an' don' make no trouble,' I
says like dat! See? 'Git deh hell outa here an' don' make no
trouble'; like dat. 'Git deh hell outa here,' I says. See?"</p>

<p>Jimmie nodded understandingly. Over his features played an eager
desire to state the amount of his valor in a similar crisis, but
the narrator proceeded.</p>

<p>"Well, deh blokie he says: 'T'hell wid it! I ain' lookin' for no
scrap,' he says (See?), 'but' he says, 'I'm 'spectable cit'zen an'
I wanna drink an' purtydamnsoon, too.' See? 'Deh hell,' I says.
Like dat! 'Deh hell,' I says. See? 'Don' make no trouble,' I says.
Like dat. 'Don' make no trouble.' See? Den deh mug he squared off
an' said he was fine as silk wid his dukes (See?) an' he wanned a
drink damnquick. Dat's what he said. See?"</p>

<p>"Sure," repeated Jimmie.</p>

<p>Pete continued. "Say, I jes' jumped deh bar an' deh way I
plunked dat blokie was great. See? Dat's right! In deh jaw! See?
Hully gee, he t'rowed a spittoon true deh front windee. Say, I taut
I'd drop dead. But deh boss, he comes in after an' he says, 'Pete,
yehs done jes' right! Yeh've gota keep order an' it's all right.'
See? 'It's all right,' he says. Dat's what he said."</p>

<p>The two held a technical discussion.</p>

<p>"Dat bloke was a dandy," said Pete, in conclusion, "but he hadn'
oughta made no trouble. Dat's what I says teh dem: 'Don' come in
here an' make no trouble,' I says, like dat. 'Don' make no
trouble.' See?"</p>

<p>As Jimmie and his friend exchanged tales descriptive of their
prowess, Maggie leaned back in the shadow. Her eyes dwelt
wonderingly and rather wistfully upon Pete's face. The broken
furniture, grimey walls, and general disorder and dirt of her home
of a sudden appeared before her and began to take a potential
aspect. Pete's aristocratic person looked as if it might soil. She
looked keenly at him, occasionally, wondering if he was feeling
contempt. But Pete seemed to be enveloped in reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Hully gee," said he, "dose mugs can't phase me. Dey knows I kin
wipe up deh street wid any t'ree of dem."</p>

<p>When he said, "Ah, what deh hell," his voice was burdened with
disdain for the inevitable and contempt for anything that fate
might compel him to endure.</p>

<p>Maggie perceived that here was the beau ideal of a man. Her dim
thoughts were often searching for far away lands where, as God
says, the little hills sing together in the morning. Under the
trees of her dream-gardens there had always walked a lover.</p>
<br>

<h2>Chapter VI</h2>

<p>Pete took note of Maggie.</p>

<p>"Say, Mag, I'm stuck on yer shape. It's outa sight," he said,
parenthetically, with an affable grin.</p>

<p>As he became aware that she was listening closely, he grew still
more eloquent in his descriptions of various happenings in his
career. It appeared that he was invincible in fights.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, referring to a man with whom he had had a
misunderstanding, "dat mug scrapped like a damn dago. Dat's right.
He was dead easy. See? He tau't he was a scrapper. But he foun' out
diff'ent! Hully gee."</p>

<p>He walked to and fro in the small room, which seemed then to
grow even smaller and unfit to hold his dignity, the attribute of a
supreme warrior. That swing of the shoulders that had frozen the
timid when he was but a lad had increased with his growth and
education at the ratio of ten to one. It, combined with the sneer
upon his mouth, told mankind that there was nothing in space which
could appall him. Maggie marvelled at him and surrounded him with
greatness. She vaguely tried to calculate the altitude of the
pinnacle from which he must have looked down upon her.</p>

<p>"I met a chump deh odder day way up in deh city," he said. "I
was goin' teh see a frien' of mine. When I was a-crossin' deh
street deh chump runned plump inteh me, an' den he turns aroun' an'
says, 'Yer insolen' ruffin,' he says, like dat. 'Oh, gee,' I says,
'oh, gee, go teh hell and git off deh eart',' I says, like dat.
See? 'Go teh hell an' git off deh eart',' like dat. Den deh blokie
he got wild. He says I was a contempt'ble scoun'el, er somet'ing
like dat, an' he says I was doom' teh everlastin' pe'dition an' all
like dat. 'Gee,' I says, 'gee! Deh hell I am,' I says. 'Deh hell I
am,' like dat. An' den I slugged 'im. See?"</p>

<p>With Jimmie in his company, Pete departed in a sort of a blaze
of glory from the Johnson home. Maggie, leaning from the window,
watched him as he walked down the street.</p>

<p>Here was a formidable man who disdained the strength of a world
full of fists. Here was one who had contempt for brass-clothed
power; one whose knuckles could defiantly ring against the granite
of law. He was a knight.</p>

<p>The two men went from under the glimmering street-lamp and
passed into shadows.</p>

<p>Turning, Maggie contemplated the dark, dust-stained walls, and
the scant and crude furniture of her home. A clock, in a splintered
and battered oblong box of varnished wood, she suddenly regarded as
an abomination. She noted that it ticked raspingly. The almost
vanished flowers in the carpet-pattern, she conceived to be newly
hideous. Some faint attempts she had made with blue ribbon, to
freshen the appearance of a dingy curtain, she now saw to be
piteous.</p>

<p>She wondered what Pete dined on.</p>

<p>She reflected upon the collar and cuff factory. It began to
appear to her mind as a dreary place of endless grinding. Pete's
elegant occupation brought him, no doubt, into contact with people
who had money and manners. It was probable that he had a large
acquaintance of pretty girls. He must have great sums of money to
spend.</p>

<p>To her the earth was composed of hardships and insults. She felt
instant admiration for a man who openly defied it. She thought that
if the grim angel of death should clutch his heart, Pete would
shrug his shoulders and say: "Oh, ev'ryt'ing goes."</p>

<p>She anticipated that he would come again shortly. She spent some
of her week's pay in the purchase of flowered cretonne for a
lambrequin. She made it with infinite care and hung it to the
slightly-careening mantel, over the stove, in the kitchen. She
studied it with painful anxiety from different points in the room.
She wanted it to look well on Sunday night when, perhaps, Jimmie's
friend would come. On Sunday night, however, Pete did not
appear.</p>

<p>Afterward the girl looked at it with a sense of humiliation. She
was now convinced that Pete was superior to admiration for
lambrequins.</p>

<p>A few evenings later Pete entered with fascinating innovations
in his apparel. As she had seen him twice and he had different
suits on each time, Maggie had a dim impression that his wardrobe
was prodigiously extensive.</p>

<p>"Say, Mag," he said, "put on yer bes' duds Friday night an' I'll
take yehs teh deh show. See?"</p>

<p>He spent a few moments in flourishing his clothes and then
vanished, without having glanced at the lambrequin.</p>

<p>Over the eternal collars and cuffs in the factory Maggie spent
the most of three days in making imaginary sketches of Pete and his
daily environment. She imagined some half dozen women in love with
him and thought he must lean dangerously toward an indefinite one,
whom she pictured with great charms of person, but with an
altogether contemptible disposition.</p>

<p>She thought he must live in a blare of pleasure. He had friends,
and people who were afraid of him.</p>

<p>She saw the golden glitter of the place where Pete was to take
her. An entertainment of many hues and many melodies where she was
afraid she might appear small and mouse-colored.</p>

<p>Her mother drank whiskey all Friday morning. With lurid face and
tossing hair she cursed and destroyed furniture all Friday
afternoon. When Maggie came home at half-past six her mother lay
asleep amidst the wreck of chairs and a table. Fragments of various
household utensils were scattered about the floor. She had vented
some phase of drunken fury upon the lambrequin. It lay in a
bedraggled heap in the corner.</p>

<p>"Hah," she snorted, sitting up suddenly, "where deh hell yeh
been? Why deh hell don' yeh come home earlier? Been loafin' 'round
deh streets. Yer gettin' teh be a reg'lar devil."</p>

<p>When Pete arrived Maggie, in a worn black dress, was waiting for
him in the midst of a floor strewn with wreckage. The curtain at
the window had been pulled by a heavy hand and hung by one tack,
dangling to and fro in the draft through the cracks at the sash.
The knots of blue ribbons appeared like violated flowers. The fire
in the stove had gone out. The displaced lids and open doors showed
heaps of sullen grey ashes. The remnants of a meal, ghastly, like
dead flesh, lay in a corner. Maggie's red mother, stretched on the
floor, blasphemed and gave her daughter a bad name.</p>

<h2>Chapter VII</h2>

<p>An orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men on an
elevated stage near the centre of a great green-hued hall, played a
popular waltz. The place was crowded with people grouped about
little tables. A battalion of waiters slid among the throng,
carrying trays of beer glasses and making change from the
inexhaustible vaults of their trousers pockets. Little boys, in the
costumes of French chefs, paraded up and down the irregular aisles
vending fancy cakes. There was a low rumble of conversation and a
subdued clinking of glasses. Clouds of tobacco smoke rolled and
wavered high in air about the dull gilt of the chandeliers.</p>

<p>The vast crowd had an air throughout of having just quitted
labor. Men with calloused hands and attired in garments that showed
the wear of an endless trudge for a living, smoked their pipes
contentedly and spent five, ten, or perhaps fifteen cents for beer.
There was a mere sprinkling of kid-gloved men who smoked cigars
purchased elsewhere. The great body of the crowd was composed of
people who showed that all day they strove with their hands. Quiet
Germans, with maybe their wives and two or three children, sat
listening to the music, with the expressions of happy cows. An
occasional party of sailors from a war-ship, their faces pictures
of sturdy health, spent the earlier hours of the evening at the
small round tables. Very infrequent tipsy men, swollen with the
value of their opinions, engaged their companions in earnest and
confidential conversation. In the balcony, and here and there
below, shone the impassive faces of women. The nationalities of the
Bowery beamed upon the stage from all directions.</p>

<p>Pete aggressively walked up a side aisle and took seats with
Maggie at a table beneath the balcony.</p>

<p>"Two beehs!"</p>

<p>Leaning back he regarded with eyes of superiority the scene
before them. This attitude affected Maggie strongly. A man who
could regard such a sight with indifference must be accustomed to
very great things.</p>

<p>It was obvious that Pete had been to this place many times
before, and was very familiar with it. A knowledge of this fact
made Maggie feel little and new.</p>

<p>He was extremely gracious and attentive. He displayed the
consideration of a cultured gentleman who knew what was due.</p>

<p>"Say, what deh hell? Bring deh lady a big glass! What deh hell
use is dat pony?"</p>

<p>"Don't be fresh, now," said the waiter, with some warmth, as he
departed.</p>

<p>"Ah, git off deh eart'," said Pete, after the other's retreating
form.</p>

<p>Maggie perceived that Pete brought forth all his elegance and
all his knowledge of high-class customs for her benefit. Her heart
warmed as she reflected upon his condescension.</p>

<p>The orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men gave vent
to a few bars of anticipatory music and a girl, in a pink dress
with short skirts, galloped upon the stage. She smiled upon the
throng as if in acknowledgment of a warm welcome, and began to walk
to and fro, making profuse gesticulations and singing, in brazen
soprano tones, a song, the words of which were inaudible. When she
broke into the swift rattling measures of a chorus some half-tipsy
men near the stage joined in the rollicking refrain and glasses
were pounded rhythmically upon the tables. People leaned forward to
watch her and to try to catch the words of the song. When she
vanished there were long rollings of applause.</p>

<p>Obedient to more anticipatory bars, she reappeared amidst the
half-suppressed cheering of the tipsy men. The orchestra plunged
into dance music and the laces of the dancer fluttered and flew in
the glare of gas jets. She divulged the fact that she was attired
in some half dozen skirts. It was patent that any one of them would
have proved adequate for the purpose for which skirts are intended.
An occasional man bent forward, intent upon the pink stockings.
Maggie wondered at the splendor of the costume and lost herself in
calculations of the cost of the silks and laces.</p>

<p>The dancer's smile of stereotyped enthusiasm was turned for ten
minutes upon the faces of her audience. In the finale she fell into
some of those grotesque attitudes which were at the time popular
among the dancers in the theatres up-town, giving to the Bowery
public the phantasies of the aristocratic theatre-going public, at
reduced rates.</p>

<p>"Say, Pete," said Maggie, leaning forward, "dis is great."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pete, with proper complacence.</p>

<p>A ventriloquist followed the dancer. He held two fantastic dolls
on his knees. He made them sing mournful ditties and say funny
things about geography and Ireland.</p>

<p>"Do dose little men talk?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"Naw," said Pete, "it's some damn fake. See?"</p>

<p>Two girls, on the bills as sisters, came forth and sang a duet
that is heard occasionally at concerts given under church auspices.
They supplemented it with a dance which of course can never be seen
at concerts given under church auspices.</p>

<p>After the duettists had retired, a woman of debatable age sang a
negro melody. The chorus necessitated some grotesque waddlings
supposed to be an imitation of a plantation darkey, under the
influence, probably, of music and the moon. The audience was just
enthusiastic enough over it to have her return and sing a sorrowful
lay, whose lines told of a mother's love and a sweetheart who
waited and a young man who was lost at sea under the most harrowing
circumstances. From the faces of a score or so in the crowd, the
self-contained look faded. Many heads were bent forward with
eagerness and sympathy. As the last distressing sentiment of the
piece was brought forth, it was greeted by that kind of applause
which rings as sincere.</p>

<p>As a final effort, the singer rendered some verses which
described a vision of Britain being annihilated by America, and
Ireland bursting her bonds. A carefully prepared crisis was reached
in the last line of the last verse, where the singer threw out her
arms and cried, "The star-spangled banner." Instantly a great cheer
swelled from the throats of the assemblage of the masses. There was
a heavy rumble of booted feet thumping the floor. Eyes gleamed with
sudden fire, and calloused hands waved frantically in the air.</p>

<p>After a few moments' rest, the orchestra played crashingly, and
a small fat man burst out upon the stage. He began to roar a song
and stamp back and forth before the foot-lights, wildly waving a
glossy silk hat and throwing leers, or smiles, broadcast. He made
his face into fantastic grimaces until he looked like a pictured
devil on a Japanese kite. The crowd laughed gleefully. His short,
fat legs were never still a moment. He shouted and roared and
bobbed his shock of red wig until the audience broke out in excited
applause.</p>

<p>Pete did not pay much attention to the progress of events upon
the stage. He was drinking beer and watching Maggie.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were blushing with excitement and her eyes were
glistening. She drew deep breaths of pleasure. No thoughts of the
atmosphere of the collar and cuff factory came to her.</p>

<p>When the orchestra crashed finally, they jostled their way to
the sidewalk with the crowd. Pete took Maggie's arm and pushed a
way for her, offering to fight with a man or two.</p>

<p>They reached Maggie's home at a late hour and stood for a moment
in front of the gruesome doorway.</p>

<p>"Say, Mag," said Pete, "give us a kiss for takin' yeh teh deh
show, will yer?"</p>

<p>Maggie laughed, as if startled, and drew away from him.</p>

<p>"Naw, Pete," she said, "dat wasn't in it."</p>

<p>"Ah, what deh hell?" urged Pete.</p>

<p>The girl retreated nervously.</p>

<p>"Ah, what deh hell?" repeated he.</p>

<p>Maggie darted into the hall, and up the stairs. She turned and
smiled at him, then disappeared.</p>

<p>Pete walked slowly down the street. He had something of an
astonished expression upon his features. He paused under a
lamp-post and breathed a low breath of surprise.</p>

<p>"Gawd," he said, "I wonner if I've been played fer a
duffer."</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>

<p>As thoughts of Pete came to Maggie's mind, she began to have an
intense dislike for all of her dresses.</p>

<p>"What deh hell ails yeh? What makes yeh be allus fixin' and
fussin'? Good Gawd," her mother would frequently roar at her.</p>

<p>She began to note, with more interest, the well-dressed women
she met on the avenues. She envied elegance and soft palms. She
craved those adornments of person which she saw every day on the
street, conceiving them to be allies of vast importance to
women.</p>

<p>Studying faces, she thought many of the women and girls she
chanced to meet, smiled with serenity as though forever cherished
and watched over by those they loved.</p>

<p>The air in the collar and cuff establishment strangled her. She
knew she was gradually and surely shrivelling in the hot, stuffy
room. The begrimed windows rattled incessantly from the passing of
elevated trains. The place was filled with a whirl of noises and
odors.</p>

<p>She wondered as she regarded some of the grizzled women in the
room, mere mechanical contrivances sewing seams and grinding out,
with heads bended over their work, tales of imagined or real
girlhood happiness, past drunks, the baby at home, and unpaid
wages. She speculated how long her youth would endure. She began to
see the bloom upon her cheeks as valuable.</p>

<p>She imagined herself, in an exasperating future, as a scrawny
woman with an eternal grievance. Too, she thought Pete to be a very
fastidious person concerning the appearance of women.</p>

<p>She felt she would love to see somebody entangle their fingers
in the oily beard of the fat foreigner who owned the establishment.
He was a detestable creature. He wore white socks with low shoes.
When he tired of this amusement he would go to the mummies and
moralize over them.</p>

<p>Usually he submitted with silent dignity to all which he had to
go through, but, at times, he was goaded into comment.</p>

<p>"What deh hell," he demanded once. "Look at all dese little
jugs! Hundred jugs in a row! Ten rows in a case an' 'bout a
t'ousand cases! What deh blazes use is dem?"</p>

<p>Evenings during the week he took her to see plays in which the
brain-clutching heroine was rescued from the palatial home of her
guardian, who is cruelly after her bonds, by the hero with the
beautiful sentiments. The latter spent most of his time out at soak
in pale-green snow storms, busy with a nickel-plated revolver,
rescuing aged strangers from villains.</p>

<p>Maggie lost herself in sympathy with the wanderers swooning in
snow storms beneath happy-hued church windows. And a choir within
singing "Joy to the World." To Maggie and the rest of the audience
this was transcendental realism. Joy always within, and they, like
the actor, inevitably without. Viewing it, they hugged themselves
in ecstatic pity of their imagined or real condition.</p>

<p>The girl thought the arrogance and granite-heartedness of the
magnate of the play was very accurately drawn. She echoed the
maledictions that the occupants of the gallery showered on this
individual when his lines compelled him to expose his extreme
selfishness.</p>

<p>Shady persons in the audience revolted from the pictured
villainy of the drama. With untiring zeal they hissed vice and
applauded virtue. Unmistakably bad men evinced an apparently
sincere admiration for virtue.</p>

<p>The loud gallery was overwhelmingly with the unfortunate and the
oppressed. They encouraged the struggling hero with cries, and
jeered the villain, hooting and calling attention to his whiskers.
When anybody died in the pale-green snow storms, the gallery
mourned. They sought out the painted misery and hugged it as
akin.</p>

<p>In the hero's erratic march from poverty in the first act, to
wealth and triumph in the final one, in which he forgives all the
enemies that he has left, he was assisted by the gallery, which
applauded his generous and noble sentiments and confounded the
speeches of his opponents by making irrelevant but very sharp
remarks. Those actors who were cursed with villainy parts were
confronted at every turn by the gallery. If one of them rendered
lines containing the most subtile distinctions between right and
wrong, the gallery was immediately aware if the actor meant
wickedness, and denounced him accordingly.</p>

<p>The last act was a triumph for the hero, poor and of the masses,
the representative of the audience, over the villain and the rich
man, his pockets stuffed with bonds, his heart packed with
tyrannical purposes, imperturbable amid suffering.</p>

<p>Maggie always departed with raised spirits from the showing
places of the melodrama. She rejoiced at the way in which the poor
and virtuous eventually surmounted the wealthy and wicked. The
theatre made her think. She wondered if the culture and refinement
she had seen imitated, perhaps grotesquely, by the heroine on the
stage, could be acquired by a girl who lived in a tenement house
and worked in a shirt factory.</p>

<h2>Chapter IX</h2>

<p>A group of urchins were intent upon the side door of a saloon.
Expectancy gleamed from their eyes. They were twisting their
fingers in excitement.</p>

<p>"Here she comes," yelled one of them suddenly.</p>

<p>The group of urchins burst instantly asunder and its individual
fragments were spread in a wide, respectable half circle about the
point of interest. The saloon door opened with a crash, and the
figure of a woman appeared upon the threshold. Her grey hair fell
in knotted masses about her shoulders. Her face was crimsoned and
wet with perspiration. Her eyes had a rolling glare.</p>

<p>"Not a damn cent more of me money will yehs ever get, not a damn
cent. I spent me money here fer t'ree years an' now yehs tells me
yeh'll sell me no more stuff! T'hell wid yeh, Johnnie Murckre!
'Disturbance'? Disturbance be damned! T'hell wid yeh,
Johnnie&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door received a kick of exasperation from within and the
woman lurched heavily out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The gamins in the half-circle became violently agitated. They
began to dance about and hoot and yell and jeer. Wide dirty grins
spread over each face.</p>

<p>The woman made a furious dash at a particularly outrageous
cluster of little boys. They laughed delightedly and scampered off
a short distance, calling out over their shoulders to her. She
stood tottering on the curb-stone and thundered at them.</p>

<p>"Yeh devil's kids," she howled, shaking red fists. The little
boys whooped in glee. As she started up the street they fell in
behind and marched uproariously. Occasionally she wheeled about and
made charges on them. They ran nimbly out of reach and taunted
her.</p>

<p>In the frame of a gruesome doorway she stood for a moment
cursing them. Her hair straggled, giving her crimson features a
look of insanity. Her great fists quivered as she shook them madly
in the air.</p>

<p>The urchins made terrific noises until she turned and
disappeared. Then they filed quietly in the way they had come.</p>

<p>The woman floundered about in the lower hall of the tenement
house and finally stumbled up the stairs. On an upper hall a door
was opened and a collection of heads peered curiously out, watching
her. With a wrathful snort the woman confronted the door, but it
was slammed hastily in her face and the key was turned.</p>

<p>She stood for a few minutes, delivering a frenzied challenge at
the panels.</p>

<p>"Come out in deh hall, Mary Murphy, damn yeh, if yehs want a
row. Come ahn, yeh overgrown terrier, come ahn."</p>

<p>She began to kick the door with her great feet. She shrilly
defied the universe to appear and do battle. Her cursing trebles
brought heads from all doors save the one she threatened. Her eyes
glared in every direction. The air was full of her tossing
fists.</p>

<p>"Come ahn, deh hull damn gang of yehs, come ahn," she roared at
the spectators. An oath or two, cat-calls, jeers and bits of
facetious advice were given in reply. Missiles clattered about her
feet.</p>

<p>"What deh hell's deh matter wid yeh?" said a voice in the
gathered gloom, and Jimmie came forward. He carried a tin
dinner-pail in his hand and under his arm a brown truckman's apron
done in a bundle. "What deh hell's wrong?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Come out, all of yehs, come out," his mother was howling. "Come
ahn an' I'll stamp her damn brains under me feet."</p>

<p>"Shet yer face, an' come home, yeh damned old fool," roared
Jimmie at her. She strided up to him and twirled her fingers in his
face. Her eyes were darting flames of unreasoning rage and her
frame trembled with eagerness for a fight.</p>

<p>"T'hell wid yehs! An' who deh hell are yehs? I ain't givin' a
snap of me fingers fer yehs," she bawled at him. She turned her
huge back in tremendous disdain and climbed the stairs to the next
floor.</p>

<p>Jimmie followed, cursing blackly. At the top of the flight he
seized his mother's arm and started to drag her toward the door of
their room.</p>

<p>"Come home, damn yeh," he gritted between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Take yer hands off me! Take yer hands off me," shrieked his
mother.</p>

<p>She raised her arm and whirled her great fist at her son's face.
Jimmie dodged his head and the blow struck him in the back of the
neck. "Damn yeh," gritted he again. He threw out his left hand and
writhed his fingers about her middle arm. The mother and the son
began to sway and struggle like gladiators.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" said the Rum Alley tenement house. The hall filled with
interested spectators.</p>

<p>"Hi, ol' lady, dat was a dandy!"</p>

<p>"T'ree to one on deh red!"</p>

<p>"Ah, stop yer damn scrappin'!"</p>

<p>The door of the Johnson home opened and Maggie looked out.
Jimmie made a supreme cursing effort and hurled his mother into the
room. He quickly followed and closed the door. The Rum Alley
tenement swore disappointedly and retired.</p>

<p>The mother slowly gathered herself up from the floor. Her eyes
glittered menacingly upon her children.</p>

<p>"Here, now," said Jimmie, "we've had enough of dis. Sit down,
an' don' make no trouble."</p>

<p>He grasped her arm, and twisting it, forced her into a creaking
chair.</p>

<p>"Keep yer hands off me," roared his mother again.</p>

<p>"Damn yer ol' hide," yelled Jimmie, madly. Maggie shrieked and
ran into the other room. To her there came the sound of a storm of
crashes and curses. There was a great final thump and Jimmie's
voice cried: "Dere, damn yeh, stay still." Maggie opened the door
now, and went warily out. "Oh, Jimmie."</p>

<p>He was leaning against the wall and swearing. Blood stood upon
bruises on his knotty fore-arms where they had scraped against the
floor or the walls in the scuffle. The mother lay screeching on the
floor, the tears running down her furrowed face.</p>

<p>Maggie, standing in the middle of the room, gazed about her. The
usual upheaval of the tables and chairs had taken place. Crockery
was strewn broadcast in fragments. The stove had been disturbed on
its legs, and now leaned idiotically to one side. A pail had been
upset and water spread in all directions.</p>

<p>The door opened and Pete appeared. He shrugged his shoulders.
"Oh, Gawd," he observed.</p>

<p>He walked over to Maggie and whispered in her ear. "Ah, what deh
hell, Mag? Come ahn and we'll have a hell of a time."</p>

<p>The mother in the corner upreared her head and shook her tangled
locks.</p>

<p>"Teh hell wid him and you," she said, glowering at her daughter
in the gloom. Her eyes seemed to burn balefully. "Yeh've gone teh
deh devil, Mag Johnson, yehs knows yehs have gone teh deh devil.
Yer a disgrace teh yer people, damn yeh. An' now, git out an' go
ahn wid dat doe-faced jude of yours. Go teh hell wid him, damn yeh,
an' a good riddance. Go teh hell an' see how yeh likes it."</p>

<p>Maggie gazed long at her mother.</p>

<p>"Go teh hell now, an' see how yeh likes it. Git out. I won't
have sech as yehs in me house! Get out, d'yeh hear! Damn yeh, git
out!"</p>

<p>The girl began to tremble.</p>

<p>At this instant Pete came forward. "Oh, what deh hell, Mag,
see," whispered he softly in her ear. "Dis all blows over. See? Deh
ol' woman 'ill be all right in deh mornin'. Come ahn out wid me!
We'll have a hell of a time."</p>

<p>The woman on the floor cursed. Jimmie was intent upon his
bruised fore-arms. The girl cast a glance about the room filled
with a chaotic mass of debris, and at the red, writhing body of her
mother.</p>

<p>"Go teh hell an' good riddance."</p>

<p>She went.</p>

<h2>Chapter X</h2>

<p>Jimmie had an idea it wasn't common courtesy for a friend to
come to one's home and ruin one's sister. But he was not sure how
much Pete knew about the rules of politeness.</p>

<p>The following night he returned home from work at rather a late
hour in the evening. In passing through the halls he came upon the
gnarled and leathery old woman who possessed the music box. She was
grinning in the dim light that drifted through dust-stained panes.
She beckoned to him with a smudged forefinger.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jimmie, what do yehs t'ink I got onto las' night. It was
deh funnies' t'ing I ever saw," she cried, coming close to him and
leering. She was trembling with eagerness to tell her tale. "I was
by me door las' night when yer sister and her jude feller came in
late, oh, very late. An' she, the dear, she was a-cryin' as if her
heart would break, she was. It was deh funnies' t'ing I ever saw.
An' right out here by me door she asked him did he love her, did
he. An' she was a-cryin' as if her heart would break, poor t'ing.
An' him, I could see by deh way what he said it dat she had been
askin' orften, he says: 'Oh, hell, yes,' he says, says he, 'Oh,
hell, yes.'"</p>

<p>Storm-clouds swept over Jimmie's face, but he turned from the
leathery old woman and plodded on up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, yes," called she after him. She laughed a laugh that
was like a prophetic croak. "'Oh, hell, yes,' he says, says he,
'Oh, hell, yes.'"</p>

<p>There was no one in at home. The rooms showed that attempts had
been made at tidying them. Parts of the wreckage of the day before
had been repaired by an unskilful hand. A chair or two and the
table, stood uncertainly upon legs. The floor had been newly swept.
Too, the blue ribbons had been restored to the curtains, and the
lambrequin, with its immense sheaves of yellow wheat and red roses
of equal size, had been returned, in a worn and sorry state, to its
position at the mantel. Maggie's jacket and hat were gone from the
nail behind the door.</p>

<p>Jimmie walked to the window and began to look through the
blurred glass. It occurred to him to vaguely wonder, for an
instant, if some of the women of his acquaintance had brothers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he began to swear.</p>

<p>"But he was me frien'! I brought 'im here! Dat's deh hell of
it!"</p>

<p>He fumed about the room, his anger gradually rising to the
furious pitch.</p>

<p>"I'll kill deh jay! Dat's what I'll do! I'll kill deh jay!"</p>

<p>He clutched his hat and sprang toward the door. But it opened
and his mother's great form blocked the passage.</p>

<p>"What deh hell's deh matter wid yeh?" exclaimed she, coming into
the rooms.</p>

<p>Jimmie gave vent to a sardonic curse and then laughed
heavily.</p>

<p>"Well, Maggie's gone teh deh devil! Dat's what! See?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said his mother.</p>

<p>"Maggie's gone teh deh devil! Are yehs deaf?" roared Jimmie,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Deh hell she has," murmured the mother, astounded.</p>

<p>Jimmie grunted, and then began to stare out at the window. His
mother sat down in a chair, but a moment later sprang erect and
delivered a maddened whirl of oaths. Her son turned to look at her
as she reeled and swayed in the middle of the room, her fierce face
convulsed with passion, her blotched arms raised high in
imprecation.</p>

<p>"May Gawd curse her forever," she shrieked. "May she eat nothin'
but stones and deh dirt in deh street. May she sleep in deh gutter
an' never see deh sun shine agin. Deh damn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, now," said her son. "Take a drop on yourself."</p>

<p>The mother raised lamenting eyes to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"She's deh devil's own chil', Jimmie," she whispered. "Ah, who
would t'ink such a bad girl could grow up in our fambly, Jimmie, me
son. Many deh hour I've spent in talk wid dat girl an' tol' her if
she ever went on deh streets I'd see her damned. An' after all her
bringin' up an' what I tol' her and talked wid her, she goes teh
deh bad, like a duck teh water."</p>

<p>The tears rolled down her furrowed face. Her hands trembled.</p>

<p>"An' den when dat Sadie MacMallister next door to us was sent
teh deh devil by dat feller what worked in deh soap-factory, didn't
I tell our Mag dat if she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, dat's annuder story," interrupted the brother. "Of course,
dat Sadie was nice an' all dat&mdash;but&mdash;see&mdash;it ain't
dessame as if&mdash;well, Maggie was diff'ent&mdash;see&mdash;she
was diff'ent."</p>

<p>He was trying to formulate a theory that he had always
unconsciously held, that all sisters, excepting his own, could
advisedly be ruined.</p>

<p>He suddenly broke out again. "I'll go t'ump hell outa deh mug
what did her deh harm. I'll kill 'im! He t'inks he kin scrap, but
when he gits me a-chasin' 'im he'll fin' out where he's wrong, deh
damned duffer. I'll wipe up deh street wid 'im."</p>

<p>In a fury he plunged out of the doorway. As he vanished the
mother raised her head and lifted both hands, entreating.</p>

<p>"May Gawd curse her forever," she cried.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the hallway Jimmie discerned a knot of women
talking volubly. When he strode by they paid no attention to
him.</p>

<p>"She allus was a bold thing," he heard one of them cry in an
eager voice. "Dere wasn't a feller come teh deh house but she'd try
teh mash 'im. My Annie says deh shameless t'ing tried teh ketch her
feller, her own feller, what we useter know his fader."</p>

<p>"I could a' tol' yehs dis two years ago," said a woman, in a key
of triumph. "Yessir, it was over two years ago dat I says teh my
ol' man, I says, 'Dat Johnson girl ain't straight,' I says. 'Oh,
hell,' he says. 'Oh, hell.' 'Dat's all right,' I says, 'but I know
what I knows,' I says, 'an' it 'ill come out later. You wait an'
see,' I says, 'you see.'"</p>

<p>"Anybody what had eyes could see dat dere was somethin' wrong
wid dat girl. I didn't like her actions."</p>

<p>On the street Jimmie met a friend. "What deh hell?" asked the
latter.</p>

<p>Jimmie explained. "An' I'll t'ump 'im till he can't stand."</p>

<p>"Oh, what deh hell," said the friend. "What's deh use! Yeh'll
git pulled in! Everybody 'ill be onto it! An' ten plunks! Gee!"</p>

<p>Jimmie was determined. "He t'inks he kin scrap, but he'll fin'
out diff'ent."</p>

<p>"Gee," remonstrated the friend. "What deh hell?"</p>
<br>

<h2>Chapter XI</h2>

<p>On a corner a glass-fronted building shed a yellow glare upon
the pavements. The open mouth of a saloon called seductively to
passengers to enter and annihilate sorrow or create rage.</p>

<p>The interior of the place was papered in olive and bronze tints
of imitation leather. A shining bar of counterfeit massiveness
extended down the side of the room. Behind it a great
mahogany-appearing sideboard reached the ceiling. Upon its shelves
rested pyramids of shimmering glasses that were never disturbed.
Mirrors set in the face of the sideboard multiplied them. Lemons,
oranges and paper napkins, arranged with mathematical precision,
sat among the glasses. Many-hued decanters of liquor perched at
regular intervals on the lower shelves. A nickel-plated cash
register occupied a position in the exact centre of the general
effect. The elementary senses of it all seemed to be opulence and
geometrical accuracy.</p>

<p>Across from the bar a smaller counter held a collection of
plates upon which swarmed frayed fragments of crackers, slices of
boiled ham, dishevelled bits of cheese, and pickles swimming in
vinegar. An odor of grasping, begrimed hands and munching mouths
pervaded.</p>

<p>Pete, in a white jacket, was behind the bar bending expectantly
toward a quiet stranger. "A beeh," said the man. Pete drew a
foam-topped glassful and set it dripping upon the bar.</p>

<p>At this moment the light bamboo doors at the entrance swung open
and crashed against the siding. Jimmie and a companion entered.
They swaggered unsteadily but belligerently toward the bar and
looked at Pete with bleared and blinking eyes.</p>

<p>"Gin," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Gin," said the companion.</p>

<p>Pete slid a bottle and two glasses along the bar. He bended his
head sideways as he assiduously polished away with a napkin at the
gleaming wood. He had a look of watchfulness upon his features.</p>

<p>Jimmie and his companion kept their eyes upon the bartender and
conversed loudly in tones of contempt.</p>

<p>"He's a dindy masher, ain't he, by Gawd?" laughed Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, yes," said the companion, sneering widely. "He's
great, he is. Git onto deh mug on deh blokie. Dat's enough to make
a feller turn hand-springs in 'is sleep."</p>

<p>The quiet stranger moved himself and his glass a trifle further
away and maintained an attitude of oblivion.</p>

<p>"Gee! ain't he hot stuff!"</p>

<p>"Git onto his shape! Great Gawd!"</p>

<p>"Hey," cried Jimmie, in tones of command. Pete came along
slowly, with a sullen dropping of the under lip.</p>

<p>"Well," he growled, "what's eatin' yehs?"</p>

<p>"Gin," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Gin," said the companion.</p>

<p>As Pete confronted them with the bottle and the glasses, they
laughed in his face. Jimmie's companion, evidently overcome with
merriment, pointed a grimy forefinger in Pete's direction.</p>

<p>"Say, Jimmie," demanded he, "what deh hell is dat behind deh
bar?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie. They laughed loudly. Pete
put down a bottle with a bang and turned a formidable face toward
them. He disclosed his teeth and his shoulders heaved
restlessly.</p>

<p>"You fellers can't guy me," he said. "Drink yer stuff an' git
out an' don' make no trouble."</p>

<p>Instantly the laughter faded from the faces of the two men and
expressions of offended dignity immediately came.</p>

<p>"Who deh hell has said anyt'ing teh you," cried they in the same
breath.</p>

<p>The quiet stranger looked at the door calculatingly.</p>

<p>"Ah, come off," said Pete to the two men. "Don't pick me up for
no jay. Drink yer rum an' git out an' don' make no trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, deh hell," airily cried Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Oh, deh hell," airily repeated his companion.</p>

<p>"We goes when we git ready! See!" continued Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Well," said Pete in a threatening voice, "don' make no
trouble."</p>

<p>Jimmie suddenly leaned forward with his head on one side. He
snarled like a wild animal.</p>

<p>"Well, what if we does? See?" said he.</p>

<p>Dark blood flushed into Pete's face, and he shot a lurid glance
at Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Well, den we'll see whose deh bes' man, you or me," he
said.</p>

<p>The quiet stranger moved modestly toward the door.</p>

<p>Jimmie began to swell with valor.</p>

<p>"Don' pick me up fer no tenderfoot. When yeh tackles me yeh
tackles one of deh bes' men in deh city. See? I'm a scrapper, I am.
Ain't dat right, Billie?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Mike," responded his companion in tones of
conviction.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," said Pete, easily. "Go fall on yerself."</p>

<p>The two men again began to laugh.</p>

<p>"What deh hell is dat talkin'?" cried the companion.</p>

<p>"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie with exaggerated
contempt.</p>

<p>Pete made a furious gesture. "Git outa here now, an' don' make
no trouble. See? Youse fellers er lookin' fer a scrap an' it's damn
likely yeh'll fin' one if yeh keeps on shootin' off yer mout's. I
know yehs! See? I kin lick better men dan yehs ever saw in yer
lifes. Dat's right! See? Don' pick me up fer no stuff er yeh might
be jolted out in deh street before yeh knows where yeh is. When I
comes from behind dis bar, I t'rows yehs bote inteh deh street.
See?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," cried the two men in chorus.</p>

<p>The glare of a panther came into Pete's eyes. "Dat's what I
said! Unnerstan'?"</p>

<p>He came through a passage at the end of the bar and swelled down
upon the two men. They stepped promptly forward and crowded close
to him.</p>

<p>They bristled like three roosters. They moved their heads
pugnaciously and kept their shoulders braced. The nervous muscles
about each mouth twitched with a forced smile of mockery.</p>

<p>"Well, what deh hell yer goin' teh do?" gritted Jimmie.</p>

<p>Pete stepped warily back, waving his hands before him to keep
the men from coming too near.</p>

<p>"Well, what deh hell yer goin' teh do?" repeated Jimmie's ally.
They kept close to him, taunting and leering. They strove to make
him attempt the initial blow.</p>

<p>"Keep back, now! Don' crowd me," ominously said Pete.</p>

<p>Again they chorused in contempt. "Oh, hell!"</p>

<p>In a small, tossing group, the three men edged for positions
like frigates contemplating battle.</p>

<p>"Well, why deh hell don' yeh try teh t'row us out?" cried Jimmie
and his ally with copious sneers.</p>

<p>The bravery of bull-dogs sat upon the faces of the men. Their
clenched fists moved like eager weapons.</p>

<p>The allied two jostled the bartender's elbows, glaring at him
with feverish eyes and forcing him toward the wall.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pete swore redly. The flash of action gleamed from his
eyes. He threw back his arm and aimed a tremendous, lightning-like
blow at Jimmie's face. His foot swung a step forward and the weight
of his body was behind his fist. Jimmie ducked his head,
Bowery-like, with the quickness of a cat. The fierce, answering
blows of him and his ally crushed on Pete's bowed head.</p>

<p>The quiet stranger vanished.</p>

<p>The arms of the combatants whirled in the air like flails. The
faces of the men, at first flushed to flame-colored anger, now
began to fade to the pallor of warriors in the blood and heat of a
battle. Their lips curled back and stretched tightly over the gums
in ghoul-like grins. Through their white, gripped teeth struggled
hoarse whisperings of oaths. Their eyes glittered with murderous
fire.</p>

<p>Each head was huddled between its owner's shoulders, and arms
were swinging with marvelous rapidity. Feet scraped to and fro with
a loud scratching sound upon the sanded floor. Blows left crimson
blotches upon pale skin. The curses of the first quarter minute of
the fight died away. The breaths of the fighters came wheezingly
from their lips and the three chests were straining and heaving.
Pete at intervals gave vent to low, labored hisses, that sounded
like a desire to kill. Jimmie's ally gibbered at times like a
wounded maniac. Jimmie was silent, fighting with the face of a
sacrificial priest. The rage of fear shone in all their eyes and
their blood-colored fists swirled.</p>

<p>At a tottering moment a blow from Pete's hand struck the ally
and he crashed to the floor. He wriggled instantly to his feet and
grasping the quiet stranger's beer glass from the bar, hurled it at
Pete's head.</p>

<p>High on the wall it burst like a bomb, shivering fragments
flying in all directions. Then missiles came to every man's hand.
The place had heretofore appeared free of things to throw, but
suddenly glass and bottles went singing through the air. They were
thrown point blank at bobbing heads. The pyramid of shimmering
glasses, that had never been disturbed, changed to cascades as
heavy bottles were flung into them. Mirrors splintered to
nothing.</p>

<p>The three frothing creatures on the floor buried themselves in a
frenzy for blood. There followed in the wake of missiles and fists
some unknown prayers, perhaps for death.</p>

<p>The quiet stranger had sprawled very pyrotechnically out on the
sidewalk. A laugh ran up and down the avenue for the half of a
block.</p>

<p>"Dey've trowed a bloke inteh deh street."</p>

<p>People heard the sound of breaking glass and shuffling feet
within the saloon and came running. A small group, bending down to
look under the bamboo doors, watching the fall of glass, and three
pairs of violent legs, changed in a moment to a crowd.</p>

<p>A policeman came charging down the sidewalk and bounced through
the doors into the saloon. The crowd bended and surged in absorbing
anxiety to see.</p>

<p>Jimmie caught first sight of the on-coming interruption. On his
feet he had the same regard for a policeman that, when on his
truck, he had for a fire engine. He howled and ran for the side
door.</p>

<p>The officer made a terrific advance, club in hand. One
comprehensive sweep of the long night stick threw the ally to the
floor and forced Pete to a corner. With his disengaged hand he made
a furious effort at Jimmie's coat-tails. Then he regained his
balance and paused.</p>

<p>"Well, well, you are a pair of pictures. What in hell yeh been
up to?"</p>

<p>Jimmie, with his face drenched in blood, escaped up a side
street, pursued a short distance by some of the more law-loving, or
excited individuals of the crowd.</p>

<p>Later, from a corner safely dark, he saw the policeman, the ally
and the bartender emerge from the saloon. Pete locked the doors and
then followed up the avenue in the rear of the crowd-encompassed
policeman and his charge.</p>

<p>On first thoughts Jimmie, with his heart throbbing at battle
heat, started to go desperately to the rescue of his friend, but he
halted.</p>

<p>"Ah, what deh hell?" he demanded of himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII</h2>

<p>In a hall of irregular shape sat Pete and Maggie drinking beer.
A submissive orchestra dictated to by a spectacled man with frowsy
hair and a dress suit, industriously followed the bobs of his head
and the waves of his baton. A ballad singer, in a dress of flaming
scarlet, sang in the inevitable voice of brass. When she vanished,
men seated at the tables near the front applauded loudly, pounding
the polished wood with their beer glasses. She returned attired in
less gown, and sang again. She received another enthusiastic
encore. She reappeared in still less gown and danced. The deafening
rumble of glasses and clapping of hands that followed her exit
indicated an overwhelming desire to have her come on for the fourth
time, but the curiosity of the audience was not gratified.</p>

<p>Maggie was pale. From her eyes had been plucked all look of
self-reliance. She leaned with a dependent air toward her
companion. She was timid, as if fearing his anger or displeasure.
She seemed to beseech tenderness of him.</p>

<p>Pete's air of distinguished valor had grown upon him until it
threatened stupendous dimensions. He was infinitely gracious to the
girl. It was apparent to her that his condescension was a
marvel.</p>

<p>He could appear to strut even while sitting still and he showed
that he was a lion of lordly characteristics by the air with which
he spat.</p>

<p>With Maggie gazing at him wonderingly, he took pride in
commanding the waiters who were, however, indifferent or deaf.</p>

<p>"Hi, you, git a russle on yehs! What deh hell yehs lookin' at?
Two more beehs, d'yeh hear?"</p>

<p>He leaned back and critically regarded the person of a girl with
a straw-colored wig who upon the stage was flinging her heels in
somewhat awkward imitation of a well-known danseuse.</p>

<p>At times Maggie told Pete long confidential tales of her former
home life, dwelling upon the escapades of the other members of the
family and the difficulties she had to combat in order to obtain a
degree of comfort. He responded in tones of philanthropy. He
pressed her arm with an air of reassuring proprietorship.</p>

<p>"Dey was damn jays," he said, denouncing the mother and
brother.</p>

<p>The sound of the music which, by the efforts of the
frowsy-headed leader, drifted to her ears through the smoke-filled
atmosphere, made the girl dream. She thought of her former Rum
Alley environment and turned to regard Pete's strong protecting
fists. She thought of the collar and cuff manufactory and the
eternal moan of the proprietor: "What een hell do you sink I pie
fife dolla a week for? Play? No, py damn." She contemplated Pete's
man-subduing eyes and noted that wealth and prosperity was
indicated by his clothes. She imagined a future, rose-tinted,
because of its distance from all that she previously had
experienced.</p>

<p>As to the present she perceived only vague reasons to be
miserable. Her life was Pete's and she considered him worthy of the
charge. She would be disturbed by no particular apprehensions, so
long as Pete adored her as he now said he did. She did not feel
like a bad woman. To her knowledge she had never seen any
better.</p>

<p>At times men at other tables regarded the girl furtively. Pete,
aware of it, nodded at her and grinned. He felt proud.</p>

<p>"Mag, yer a bloomin' good-looker," he remarked, studying her
face through the haze. The men made Maggie fear, but she blushed at
Pete's words as it became apparent to her that she was the apple of
his eye.</p>

<p>Grey-headed men, wonderfully pathetic in their dissipation,
stared at her through clouds. Smooth-cheeked boys, some of them
with faces of stone and mouths of sin, not nearly so pathetic as
the grey heads, tried to find the girl's eyes in the smoke wreaths.
Maggie considered she was not what they thought her. She confined
her glances to Pete and the stage.</p>

<p>The orchestra played negro melodies and a versatile drummer
pounded, whacked, clattered and scratched on a dozen machines to
make noise.</p>

<p>Those glances of the men, shot at Maggie from under half-closed
lids, made her tremble. She thought them all to be worse men than
Pete.</p>

<p>"Come, let's go," she said.</p>

<p>As they went out Maggie perceived two women seated at a table
with some men. They were painted and their cheeks had lost their
roundness. As she passed them the girl, with a shrinking movement,
drew back her skirts.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII</h2>

<p>Jimmie did not return home for a number of days after the fight
with Pete in the saloon. When he did, he approached with extreme
caution.</p>

<p>He found his mother raving. Maggie had not returned home. The
parent continually wondered how her daughter could come to such a
pass. She had never considered Maggie as a pearl dropped unstained
into Rum Alley from Heaven, but she could not conceive how it was
possible for her daughter to fall so low as to bring disgrace upon
her family. She was terrific in denunciation of the girl's
wickedness.</p>

<p>The fact that the neighbors talked of it, maddened her. When
women came in, and in the course of their conversation casually
asked, "Where's Maggie dese days?" the mother shook her fuzzy head
at them and appalled them with curses. Cunning hints inviting
confidence she rebuffed with violence.</p>

<p>"An' wid all deh bringin' up she had, how could she?" moaningly
she asked of her son. "Wid all deh talkin' wid her I did an' deh
t'ings I tol' her to remember? When a girl is bringed up deh way I
bringed up Maggie, how kin she go teh deh devil?"</p>

<p>Jimmie was transfixed by these questions. He could not conceive
how under the circumstances his mother's daughter and his sister
could have been so wicked.</p>

<p>His mother took a drink from a squdgy bottle that sat on the
table. She continued her lament.</p>

<p>"She had a bad heart, dat girl did, Jimmie. She was wicked teh
deh heart an' we never knowed it."</p>

<p>Jimmie nodded, admitting the fact.</p>

<p>"We lived in deh same house wid her an' I brought her up an' we
never knowed how bad she was."</p>

<p>Jimmie nodded again.</p>

<p>"Wid a home like dis an' a mudder like me, she went teh deh
bad," cried the mother, raising her eyes.</p>

<p>One day, Jimmie came home, sat down in a chair and began to
wriggle about with a new and strange nervousness. At last he spoke
shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"Well, look-a-here, dis t'ing queers us! See? We're queered! An'
maybe it 'ud be better if I&mdash;well, I t'ink I kin look 'er up
an'&mdash;maybe it 'ud be better if I fetched her home
an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mother started from her chair and broke forth into a storm
of passionate anger.</p>

<p>"What! Let 'er come an' sleep under deh same roof wid her mudder
agin! Oh, yes, I will, won't I? Sure? Shame on yehs, Jimmie
Johnson, for sayin' such a t'ing teh yer own mudder&mdash;teh yer
own mudder! Little did I t'ink when yehs was a babby playin' about
me feet dat ye'd grow up teh say sech a t'ing teh yer
mudder&mdash;yer own mudder. I never taut&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sobs choked her and interrupted her reproaches.</p>

<p>"Dere ain't nottin' teh raise sech hell about," said Jimmie. "I
on'y says it 'ud be better if we keep dis t'ing dark, see? It
queers us! See?"</p>

<p>His mother laughed a laugh that seemed to ring through the city
and be echoed and re-echoed by countless other laughs. "Oh, yes, I
will, won't I! Sure!"</p>

<p>"Well, yeh must take me fer a damn fool," said Jimmie, indignant
at his mother for mocking him. "I didn't say we'd make 'er inteh a
little tin angel, ner nottin', but deh way it is now she can queer
us! Don' che see?"</p>

<p>"Aye, she'll git tired of deh life atter a while an' den she'll
wanna be a-comin' home, won' she, deh beast! I'll let 'er in den,
won' I?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn' mean none of dis prod'gal bus'ness anyway,"
explained Jimmie.</p>

<p>"It wasn't no prod'gal dauter, yeh damn fool," said the mother.
"It was prod'gal son, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I know dat," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>For a time they sat in silence. The mother's eyes gloated on a
scene her imagination could call before her. Her lips were set in a
vindictive smile.</p>

<p>"Aye, she'll cry, won' she, an' carry on, an' tell how Pete, or
some odder feller, beats 'er an' she'll say she's sorry an' all dat
an' she ain't happy, she ain't, an' she wants to come home agin,
she does."</p>

<p>With grim humor, the mother imitated the possible wailing notes
of the daughter's voice.</p>

<p>"Den I'll take 'er in, won't I, deh beast. She kin cry 'er two
eyes out on deh stones of deh street before I'll dirty deh place
wid her. She abused an' ill-treated her own mudder&mdash;her own
mudder what loved her an' she'll never git anodder chance dis side
of hell."</p>

<p>Jimmie thought he had a great idea of women's frailty, but he
could not understand why any of his kin should be victims.</p>

<p>"Damn her," he fervidly said.</p>

<p>Again he wondered vaguely if some of the women of his
acquaintance had brothers. Nevertheless, his mind did not for an
instant confuse himself with those brothers nor his sister with
theirs. After the mother had, with great difficulty, suppressed the
neighbors, she went among them and proclaimed her grief. "May Gawd
forgive dat girl," was her continual cry. To attentive ears she
recited the whole length and breadth of her woes.</p>

<p>"I bringed 'er up deh way a dauter oughta be bringed up an' dis
is how she served me! She went teh deh devil deh first chance she
got! May Gawd forgive her."</p>

<p>When arrested for drunkenness she used the story of her
daughter's downfall with telling effect upon the police justices.
Finally one of them said to her, peering down over his spectacles:
"Mary, the records of this and other courts show that you are the
mother of forty-two daughters who have been ruined. The case is
unparalleled in the annals of this court, and this court
thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mother went through life shedding large tears of sorrow. Her
red face was a picture of agony.</p>

<p>Of course Jimmie publicly damned his sister that he might appear
on a higher social plane. But, arguing with himself, stumbling
about in ways that he knew not, he, once, almost came to a
conclusion that his sister would have been more firmly good had she
better known why. However, he felt that he could not hold such a
view. He threw it hastily aside.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>

<p>In a hilarious hall there were twenty-eight tables and
twenty-eight women and a crowd of smoking men. Valiant noise was
made on a stage at the end of the hall by an orchestra composed of
men who looked as if they had just happened in. Soiled waiters ran
to and fro, swooping down like hawks on the unwary in the throng;
clattering along the aisles with trays covered with glasses;
stumbling over women's skirts and charging two prices for
everything but beer, all with a swiftness that blurred the view of
the cocoanut palms and dusty monstrosities painted upon the walls
of the room. A bouncer, with an immense load of business upon his
hands, plunged about in the crowd, dragging bashful strangers to
prominent chairs, ordering waiters here and there and quarreling
furiously with men who wanted to sing with the orchestra.</p>

<p>The usual smoke cloud was present, but so dense that heads and
arms seemed entangled in it. The rumble of conversation was
replaced by a roar. Plenteous oaths heaved through the air. The
room rang with the shrill voices of women bubbling o'er with
drink-laughter. The chief element in the music of the orchestra was
speed. The musicians played in intent fury. A woman was singing and
smiling upon the stage, but no one took notice of her. The rate at
which the piano, cornet and violins were going, seemed to impart
wildness to the half-drunken crowd. Beer glasses were emptied at a
gulp and conversation became a rapid chatter. The smoke eddied and
swirled like a shadowy river hurrying toward some unseen falls.
Pete and Maggie entered the hall and took chairs at a table near
the door. The woman who was seated there made an attempt to occupy
Pete's attention and, failing, went away.</p>

<p>Three weeks had passed since the girl had left home. The air of
spaniel-like dependence had been magnified and showed its direct
effect in the peculiar off-handedness and ease of Pete's ways
toward her.</p>

<p>She followed Pete's eyes with hers, anticipating with smiles
gracious looks from him.</p>

<p>A woman of brilliance and audacity, accompanied by a mere boy,
came into the place and took seats near them.</p>

<p>At once Pete sprang to his feet, his face beaming with glad
surprise.</p>

<p>"By Gawd, there's Nellie," he cried.</p>

<p>He went over to the table and held out an eager hand to the
woman.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Pete, me boy, how are you," said she, giving him
her fingers.</p>

<p>Maggie took instant note of the woman. She perceived that her
black dress fitted her to perfection. Her linen collar and cuffs
were spotless. Tan gloves were stretched over her well-shaped
hands. A hat of a prevailing fashion perched jauntily upon her dark
hair. She wore no jewelry and was painted with no apparent paint.
She looked clear-eyed through the stares of the men.</p>

<p>"Sit down, and call your lady-friend over," she said cordially
to Pete. At his beckoning Maggie came and sat between Pete and the
mere boy.</p>

<p>"I thought yeh were gone away fer good," began Pete, at once.
"When did yeh git back? How did dat Buff'lo bus'ness turn out?"</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders. "Well, he didn't have as many
stamps as he tried to make out, so I shook him, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad teh see yehs back in deh city," said Pete, with
awkward gallantry.</p>

<p>He and the woman entered into a long conversation, exchanging
reminiscences of days together. Maggie sat still, unable to
formulate an intelligent sentence upon the conversation and
painfully aware of it.</p>

<p>She saw Pete's eyes sparkle as he gazed upon the handsome
stranger. He listened smilingly to all she said. The woman was
familiar with all his affairs, asked him about mutual friends, and
knew the amount of his salary.</p>

<p>She paid no attention to Maggie, looking toward her once or
twice and apparently seeing the wall beyond.</p>

<p>The mere boy was sulky. In the beginning he had welcomed with
acclamations the additions.</p>

<p>"Let's all have a drink! What'll you take, Nell? And you, Miss
what's-your-name. Have a drink, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;-, you, I
mean."</p>

<p>He had shown a sprightly desire to do the talking for the
company and tell all about his family. In a loud voice he declaimed
on various topics. He assumed a patronizing air toward Pete. As
Maggie was silent, he paid no attention to her. He made a great
show of lavishing wealth upon the woman of brilliance and
audacity.</p>

<p>"Do keep still, Freddie! You gibber like an ape, dear," said the
woman to him. She turned away and devoted her attention to
Pete.</p>

<p>"We'll have many a good time together again, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Mike," said Pete, enthusiastic at once.</p>

<p>"Say," whispered she, leaning forward, "let's go over to
Billie's and have a heluva time."</p>

<p>"Well, it's dis way! See?" said Pete. "I got dis lady frien'
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, t'hell with her," argued the woman.</p>

<p>Pete appeared disturbed.</p>

<p>"All right," said she, nodding her head at him. "All right for
you! We'll see the next time you ask me to go anywheres with
you."</p>

<p>Pete squirmed.</p>

<p>"Say," he said, beseechingly, "come wid me a minit an' I'll tell
yer why."</p>

<p>The woman waved her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, you needn't explain, you know. You
wouldn't come merely because you wouldn't come, that's all there is
of it."</p>

<p>To Pete's visible distress she turned to the mere boy, bringing
him speedily from a terrific rage. He had been debating whether it
would be the part of a man to pick a quarrel with Pete, or would he
be justified in striking him savagely with his beer glass without
warning. But he recovered himself when the woman turned to renew
her smilings. He beamed upon her with an expression that was
somewhat tipsy and inexpressibly tender.</p>

<p>"Say, shake that Bowery jay," requested he, in a loud
whisper.</p>

<p>"Freddie, you are so droll," she replied.</p>

<p>Pete reached forward and touched the woman on the arm.</p>

<p>"Come out a minit while I tells yeh why I can't go wid yer. Yer
doin' me dirt, Nell! I never taut ye'd do me dirt, Nell. Come on,
will yer?" He spoke in tones of injury.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't see why I should be interested in your
explanations," said the woman, with a coldness that seemed to
reduce Pete to a pulp.</p>

<p>His eyes pleaded with her. "Come out a minit while I tells
yeh."</p>

<p>The woman nodded slightly at Maggie and the mere boy, "'Scuse
me."</p>

<p>The mere boy interrupted his loving smile and turned a
shrivelling glare upon Pete. His boyish countenance flushed and he
spoke, in a whine, to the woman:</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Nellie, this ain't a square deal, you know. You
aren't goin' to leave me and go off with that duffer, are you? I
should think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you dear boy, of course I'm not," cried the woman,
affectionately. She bended over and whispered in his ear. He smiled
again and settled in his chair as if resolved to wait
patiently.</p>

<p>As the woman walked down between the rows of tables, Pete was at
her shoulder talking earnestly, apparently in explanation. The
woman waved her hands with studied airs of indifference. The doors
swung behind them, leaving Maggie and the mere boy seated at the
table.</p>

<p>Maggie was dazed. She could dimly perceive that something
stupendous had happened. She wondered why Pete saw fit to
remonstrate with the woman, pleading for forgiveness with his eyes.
She thought she noted an air of submission about her leonine Pete.
She was astounded.</p>

<p>The mere boy occupied himself with cock-tails and a cigar. He
was tranquilly silent for half an hour. Then he bestirred himself
and spoke.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, sighing, "I knew this was the way it would be."
There was another stillness. The mere boy seemed to be musing.</p>

<p>"She was pulling m'leg. That's the whole amount of it," he said,
suddenly. "It's a bloomin' shame the way that girl does. Why, I've
spent over two dollars in drinks to-night. And she goes off with
that plug-ugly who looks as if he had been hit in the face with a
coin-die. I call it rocky treatment for a fellah like me. Here,
waiter, bring me a cock-tail and make it damned strong."</p>

<p>Maggie made no reply. She was watching the doors. "It's a mean
piece of business," complained the mere boy. He explained to her
how amazing it was that anybody should treat him in such a manner.
"But I'll get square with her, you bet. She won't get far ahead of
yours truly, you know," he added, winking. "I'll tell her plainly
that it was bloomin' mean business. And she won't come it over me
with any of her 'now-Freddie-dears.' She thinks my name is Freddie,
you know, but of course it ain't. I always tell these people some
name like that, because if they got onto your right name they might
use it sometime. Understand? Oh, they don't fool me much."</p>

<p>Maggie was paying no attention, being intent upon the doors. The
mere boy relapsed into a period of gloom, during which he
exterminated a number of cock-tails with a determined air, as if
replying defiantly to fate. He occasionally broke forth into
sentences composed of invectives joined together in a long
string.</p>

<p>The girl was still staring at the doors. After a time the mere
boy began to see cobwebs just in front of his nose. He spurred
himself into being agreeable and insisted upon her having a
charlotte-russe and a glass of beer.</p>

<p>"They's gone," he remarked, "they's gone." He looked at her
through the smoke wreaths. "Shay, lil' girl, we mightish well make
bes' of it. You ain't such bad-lookin' girl, y'know. Not half bad.
Can't come up to Nell, though. No, can't do it! Well, I should shay
not! Nell fine-lookin' girl! F&mdash;i&mdash;n&mdash;ine. You look
damn bad longsider her, but by y'self ain't so bad. Have to do
anyhow. Nell gone. On'y you left. Not half bad, though."</p>

<p>Maggie stood up.</p>

<p>"I'm going home," she said.</p>

<p>The mere boy started.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Home," he cried, struck with amazement. "I beg
pardon, did hear say home?"</p>

<p>"I'm going home," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Great Gawd, what hava struck," demanded the mere boy of
himself, stupefied.</p>

<p>In a semi-comatose state he conducted her on board an up-town
car, ostentatiously paid her fare, leered kindly at her through the
rear window and fell off the steps.</p>

<h2>Chapter XV</h2>

<p>A forlorn woman went along a lighted avenue. The street was
filled with people desperately bound on missions. An endless crowd
darted at the elevated station stairs and the horse cars were
thronged with owners of bundles.</p>

<p>The pace of the forlorn woman was slow. She was apparently
searching for some one. She loitered near the doors of saloons and
watched men emerge from them. She scanned furtively the faces in
the rushing stream of pedestrians. Hurrying men, bent on catching
some boat or train, jostled her elbows, failing to notice her,
their thoughts fixed on distant dinners.</p>

<p>The forlorn woman had a peculiar face. Her smile was no smile.
But when in repose her features had a shadowy look that was like a
sardonic grin, as if some one had sketched with cruel forefinger
indelible lines about her mouth.</p>

<p>Jimmie came strolling up the avenue. The woman encountered him
with an aggrieved air.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, I've been lookin' all over fer yehs&mdash;," she
began.</p>

<p>Jimmie made an impatient gesture and quickened his pace.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't bodder me! Good Gawd!" he said, with the savageness
of a man whose life is pestered.</p>

<p>The woman followed him along the sidewalk in somewhat the manner
of a suppliant.</p>

<p>"But, Jimmie," she said, "yehs told me ye'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmie turned upon her fiercely as if resolved to make a last
stand for comfort and peace.</p>

<p>"Say, fer Gawd's sake, Hattie, don' foller me from one end of
deh city teh deh odder. Let up, will yehs! Give me a minute's res',
can't yehs? Yehs makes me tired, allus taggin' me. See? Ain' yehs
got no sense. Do yehs want people teh get onto me? Go chase
yerself, fer Gawd's sake."</p>

<p>The woman stepped closer and laid her fingers on his arm. "But,
look-a-here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmie snarled. "Oh, go teh hell."</p>

<p>He darted into the front door of a convenient saloon and a
moment later came out into the shadows that surrounded the side
door. On the brilliantly lighted avenue he perceived the forlorn
woman dodging about like a scout. Jimmie laughed with an air of
relief and went away.</p>

<p>When he arrived home he found his mother clamoring. Maggie had
returned. She stood shivering beneath the torrent of her mother's
wrath.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," said Jimmie in greeting.</p>

<p>His mother, tottering about the room, pointed a quivering
forefinger.</p>

<p>"Lookut her, Jimmie, lookut her. Dere's yer sister, boy. Dere's
yer sister. Lookut her! Lookut her!"</p>

<p>She screamed in scoffing laughter.</p>

<p>The girl stood in the middle of the room. She edged about as if
unable to find a place on the floor to put her feet.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha," bellowed the mother. "Dere she stands! Ain' she
purty? Lookut her! Ain' she sweet, deh beast? Lookut her! Ha, ha,
lookut her!"</p>

<p>She lurched forward and put her red and seamed hands upon her
daughter's face. She bent down and peered keenly up into the eyes
of the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's jes' dessame as she ever was, ain' she? She's her
mudder's purty darlin' yit, ain' she? Lookut her, Jimmie! Come
here, fer Gawd's sake, and lookut her."</p>

<p>The loud, tremendous sneering of the mother brought the denizens
of the Rum Alley tenement to their doors. Women came in the
hallways. Children scurried to and fro.</p>

<p>"What's up? Dat Johnson party on anudder tear?"</p>

<p>"Naw! Young Mag's come home!"</p>

<p>"Deh hell yeh say?"</p>

<p>Through the open door curious eyes stared in at Maggie. Children
ventured into the room and ogled her, as if they formed the front
row at a theatre. Women, without, bended toward each other and
whispered, nodding their heads with airs of profound philosophy. A
baby, overcome with curiosity concerning this object at which all
were looking, sidled forward and touched her dress, cautiously, as
if investigating a red-hot stove. Its mother's voice rang out like
a warning trumpet. She rushed forward and grabbed her child,
casting a terrible look of indignation at the girl.</p>

<p>Maggie's mother paced to and fro, addressing the doorful of
eyes, expounding like a glib showman at a museum. Her voice rang
through the building.</p>

<p>"Dere she stands," she cried, wheeling suddenly and pointing
with dramatic finger. "Dere she stands! Lookut her! Ain' she a
dindy? An' she was so good as to come home teh her mudder, she was!
Ain' she a beaut'? Ain' she a dindy? Fer Gawd's sake!"</p>

<p>The jeering cries ended in another burst of shrill laughter.</p>

<p>The girl seemed to awaken. "Jimmie&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew hastily back from her.</p>

<p>"Well, now, yer a hell of a t'ing, ain' yeh?" he said, his lips
curling in scorn. Radiant virtue sat upon his brow and his
repelling hands expressed horror of contamination.</p>

<p>Maggie turned and went.</p>

<p>The crowd at the door fell back precipitately. A baby falling
down in front of the door, wrenched a scream like a wounded animal
from its mother. Another woman sprang forward and picked it up,
with a chivalrous air, as if rescuing a human being from an
oncoming express train.</p>

<p>As the girl passed down through the hall, she went before open
doors framing more eyes strangely microscopic, and sending broad
beams of inquisitive light into the darkness of her path. On the
second floor she met the gnarled old woman who possessed the music
box.</p>

<p>"So," she cried, "'ere yehs are back again, are yehs? An' dey've
kicked yehs out? Well, come in an' stay wid me teh-night. I ain'
got no moral standin'."</p>

<p>From above came an unceasing babble of tongues, over all of
which rang the mother's derisive laughter.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI</h2>

<p>Pete did not consider that he had ruined Maggie. If he had
thought that her soul could never smile again, he would have
believed the mother and brother, who were pyrotechnic over the
affair, to be responsible for it.</p>

<p>Besides, in his world, souls did not insist upon being able to
smile. "What deh hell?"</p>

<p>He felt a trifle entangled. It distressed him. Revelations and
scenes might bring upon him the wrath of the owner of the saloon,
who insisted upon respectability of an advanced type.</p>

<p>"What deh hell do dey wanna raise such a smoke about it fer?"
demanded he of himself, disgusted with the attitude of the family.
He saw no necessity for anyone's losing their equilibrium merely
because their sister or their daughter had stayed away from
home.</p>

<p>Searching about in his mind for possible reasons for their
conduct, he came upon the conclusion that Maggie's motives were
correct, but that the two others wished to snare him. He felt
pursued.</p>

<p>The woman of brilliance and audacity whom he had met in the
hilarious hall showed a disposition to ridicule him.</p>

<p>"A little pale thing with no spirit," she said. "Did you note
the expression of her eyes? There was something in them about
pumpkin pie and virtue. That is a peculiar way the left corner of
her mouth has of twitching, isn't it? Dear, dear, my
cloud-compelling Pete, what are you coming to?"</p>

<p>Pete asserted at once that he never was very much interested in
the girl. The woman interrupted him, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not of the slightest consequence to me, my dear young
man. You needn't draw maps for my benefit. Why should I be
concerned about it?"</p>

<p>But Pete continued with his explanations. If he was laughed at
for his tastes in women, he felt obliged to say that they were only
temporary or indifferent ones.</p>

<p>The morning after Maggie had departed from home, Pete stood
behind the bar. He was immaculate in white jacket and apron and his
hair was plastered over his brow with infinite correctness. No
customers were in the place. Pete was twisting his napkined fist
slowly in a beer glass, softly whistling to himself and
occasionally holding the object of his attention between his eyes
and a few weak beams of sunlight that had found their way over the
thick screens and into the shaded room.</p>

<p>With lingering thoughts of the woman of brilliance and audacity,
the bartender raised his head and stared through the varying cracks
between the swaying bamboo doors. Suddenly the whistling pucker
faded from his lips. He saw Maggie walking slowly past. He gave a
great start, fearing for the previously-mentioned eminent
respectability of the place.</p>

<p>He threw a swift, nervous glance about him, all at once feeling
guilty. No one was in the room.</p>

<p>He went hastily over to the side door. Opening it and looking
out, he perceived Maggie standing, as if undecided, on the corner.
She was searching the place with her eyes.</p>

<p>As she turned her face toward him Pete beckoned to her
hurriedly, intent upon returning with speed to a position behind
the bar and to the atmosphere of respectability upon which the
proprietor insisted.</p>

<p>Maggie came to him, the anxious look disappearing from her face
and a smile wreathing her lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pete&mdash;," she began brightly.</p>

<p>The bartender made a violent gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Gawd," cried he, vehemently. "What deh hell do yeh wanna
hang aroun' here fer? Do yeh wanna git me inteh trouble?" he
demanded with an air of injury.</p>

<p>Astonishment swept over the girl's features. "Why, Pete! yehs
tol' me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pete glanced profound irritation. His countenance reddened with
the anger of a man whose respectability is being threatened.</p>

<p>"Say, yehs makes me tired. See? What deh hell deh yeh wanna tag
aroun' atter me fer? Yeh'll git me inteh trouble wid deh ol' man
an' dey'll be hell teh pay! If he sees a woman roun' here he'll go
crazy an' I'll lose me job! See? Yer brudder come in here an'
raised hell an' deh ol' man hada put up fer it! An' now I'm done!
See? I'm done."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes stared into his face. "Pete, don't yeh
remem&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," interrupted Pete, anticipating.</p>

<p>The girl seemed to have a struggle with herself. She was
apparently bewildered and could not find speech. Finally she asked
in a low voice: "But where kin I go?"</p>

<p>The question exasperated Pete beyond the powers of endurance. It
was a direct attempt to give him some responsibility in a matter
that did not concern him. In his indignation he volunteered
information.</p>

<p>"Oh, go teh hell," cried he. He slammed the door furiously and
returned, with an air of relief, to his respectability.</p>

<p>Maggie went away.</p>

<p>She wandered aimlessly for several blocks. She stopped once and
asked aloud a question of herself: "Who?"</p>

<p>A man who was passing near her shoulder, humorously took the
questioning word as intended for him.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Who? Nobody! I didn't say anything," he laughingly
said, and continued his way.</p>

<p>Soon the girl discovered that if she walked with such apparent
aimlessness, some men looked at her with calculating eyes. She
quickened her step, frightened. As a protection, she adopted a
demeanor of intentness as if going somewhere.</p>

<p>After a time she left rattling avenues and passed between rows
of houses with sternness and stolidity stamped upon their features.
She hung her head for she felt their eyes grimly upon her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came upon a stout gentleman in a silk hat and a
chaste black coat, whose decorous row of buttons reached from his
chin to his knees. The girl had heard of the Grace of God and she
decided to approach this man.</p>

<p>His beaming, chubby face was a picture of benevolence and
kind-heartedness. His eyes shone good-will.</p>

<p>But as the girl timidly accosted him, he gave a convulsive
movement and saved his respectability by a vigorous side-step. He
did not risk it to save a soul. For how was he to know that there
was a soul before him that needed saving?</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII</h2>

<p>Upon a wet evening, several months after the last chapter, two
interminable rows of cars, pulled by slipping horses, jangled along
a prominent side-street. A dozen cabs, with coat-enshrouded
drivers, clattered to and fro. Electric lights, whirring softly,
shed a blurred radiance. A flower dealer, his feet tapping
impatiently, his nose and his wares glistening with rain-drops,
stood behind an array of roses and chrysanthemums. Two or three
theatres emptied a crowd upon the storm-swept pavements. Men pulled
their hats over their eyebrows and raised their collars to their
ears. Women shrugged impatient shoulders in their warm cloaks and
stopped to arrange their skirts for a walk through the storm.
People having been comparatively silent for two hours burst into a
roar of conversation, their hearts still kindling from the glowings
of the stage.</p>

<p>The pavements became tossing seas of umbrellas. Men stepped
forth to hail cabs or cars, raising their fingers in varied forms
of polite request or imperative demand. An endless procession
wended toward elevated stations. An atmosphere of pleasure and
prosperity seemed to hang over the throng, born, perhaps, of good
clothes and of having just emerged from a place of
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>In the mingled light and gloom of an adjacent park, a handful of
wet wanderers, in attitudes of chronic dejection, was scattered
among the benches.</p>

<p>A girl of the painted cohorts of the city went along the street.
She threw changing glances at men who passed her, giving smiling
invitations to men of rural or untaught pattern and usually seeming
sedately unconscious of the men with a metropolitan seal upon their
faces.</p>

<p>Crossing glittering avenues, she went into the throng emerging
from the places of forgetfulness. She hurried forward through the
crowd as if intent upon reaching a distant home, bending forward in
her handsome cloak, daintily lifting her skirts and picking for her
well-shod feet the dryer spots upon the pavements.</p>

<p>The restless doors of saloons, clashing to and fro, disclosed
animated rows of men before bars and hurrying barkeepers.</p>

<p>A concert hall gave to the street faint sounds of swift,
machine-like music, as if a group of phantom musicians were
hastening.</p>

<p>A tall young man, smoking a cigarette with a sublime air,
strolled near the girl. He had on evening dress, a moustache, a
chrysanthemum, and a look of ennui, all of which he kept carefully
under his eye. Seeing the girl walk on as if such a young man as he
was not in existence, he looked back transfixed with interest. He
stared glassily for a moment, but gave a slight convulsive start
when he discerned that she was neither new, Parisian, nor
theatrical. He wheeled about hastily and turned his stare into the
air, like a sailor with a search-light.</p>

<p>A stout gentleman, with pompous and philanthropic whiskers, went
stolidly by, the broad of his back sneering at the girl.</p>

<p>A belated man in business clothes, and in haste to catch a car,
bounced against her shoulder. "Hi, there, Mary, I beg your pardon!
Brace up, old girl." He grasped her arm to steady her, and then was
away running down the middle of the street.</p>

<p>The girl walked on out of the realm of restaurants and saloons.
She passed more glittering avenues and went into darker blocks than
those where the crowd travelled.</p>

<p>A young man in light overcoat and derby hat received a glance
shot keenly from the eyes of the girl. He stopped and looked at
her, thrusting his hands in his pockets and making a mocking smile
curl his lips. "Come, now, old lady," he said, "you don't mean to
tel me that you sized me up for a farmer?"</p>

<p>A labouring man marched along; with bundles under his arms. To
her remarks, he replied, "It's a fine evenin', ain't it?"</p>

<p>She smiled squarely into the face of a boy who was hurrying by
with his hands buried in his overcoat pockets, his blonde locks
bobbing on his youthful temples, and a cheery smile of unconcern
upon his lips. He turned his head and smiled back at her, waving
his hands.</p>

<p>"Not this eve&mdash;some other eve!"</p>

<p>A drunken man, reeling in her pathway, began to roar at her. "I
ain' ga no money!" he shouted, in a dismal voice. He lurched on up
the street, wailing to himself: "I ain' ga no money. Ba' luck. Ain'
ga no more money."</p>

<p>The girl went into gloomy districts near the river, where the
tall black factories shut in the street and only occasional broad
beams of light fell across the pavements from saloons. In front of
one of these places, whence came the sound of a violin vigorously
scraped, the patter of feet on boards and the ring of loud
laughter, there stood a man with blotched features.</p>

<p>Further on in the darkness she met a ragged being with shifting,
bloodshot eyes and grimy hands.</p>

<p>She went into the blackness of the final block. The shutters of
the tall buildings were closed like grim lips. The structures
seemed to have eyes that looked over them, beyond them, at other
things. Afar off the lights of the avenues glittered as if from an
impossible distance. Street-car bells jingled with a sound of
merriment.</p>

<p>At the feet of the tall buildings appeared the deathly black hue
of the river. Some hidden factory sent up a yellow glare, that lit
for a moment the waters lapping oilily against timbers. The varied
sounds of life, made joyous by distance and seeming
unapproachableness, came faintly and died away to a silence.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII</h2>

<p>In a partitioned-off section of a saloon sat a man with a half
dozen women, gleefully laughing, hovering about him. The man had
arrived at that stage of drunkenness where affection is felt for
the universe.</p>

<p>"I'm good f'ler, girls," he said, convincingly. "I'm damn good
f'ler. An'body treats me right, I allus trea's zem right! See?"</p>

<p>The women nodded their heads approvingly. "To be sure," they
cried out in hearty chorus. "You're the kind of a man we like,
Pete. You're outa sight! What yeh goin' to buy this time,
dear?"</p>

<p>"An't'ing yehs wants, damn it," said the man in an abandonment
of good will. His countenance shone with the true spirit of
benevolence. He was in the proper mode of missionaries. He would
have fraternized with obscure Hottentots. And above all, he was
overwhelmed in tenderness for his friends, who were all
illustrious.</p>

<p>"An't'ing yehs wants, damn it," repeated he, waving his hands
with beneficent recklessness. "I'm good f'ler, girls, an' if
an'body treats me right I&mdash;here," called he through an open
door to a waiter, "bring girls drinks, damn it. What 'ill yehs
have, girls? An't'ing yehs wants, damn it!"</p>

<p>The waiter glanced in with the disgusted look of the man who
serves intoxicants for the man who takes too much of them. He
nodded his head shortly at the order from each individual, and
went.</p>

<p>"Damn it," said the man, "we're havin' heluva time. I like you
girls! Damn'd if I don't! Yer right sort! See?"</p>

<p>He spoke at length and with feeling, concerning the excellencies
of his assembled friends.</p>

<p>"Don' try pull man's leg, but have a heluva time! Das right! Das
way teh do! Now, if I sawght yehs tryin' work me fer drinks,
wouldn' buy damn t'ing! But yer right sort, damn it! Yehs know how
ter treat a f'ler, an' I stays by yehs 'til spen' las' cent! Das
right! I'm good f'ler an' I knows when an'body treats me
right!"</p>

<p>Between the times of the arrival and departure of the waiter,
the man discoursed to the women on the tender regard he felt for
all living things. He laid stress upon the purity of his motives in
all dealings with men in the world and spoke of the fervor of his
friendship for those who were amiable. Tears welled slowly from his
eyes. His voice quavered when he spoke to them.</p>

<p>Once when the waiter was about to depart with an empty tray, the
man drew a coin from his pocket and held it forth.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, quite magnificently, "here's quar'."</p>

<p>The waiter kept his hands on his tray.</p>

<p>"I don' want yer money," he said.</p>

<p>The other put forth the coin with tearful insistence.</p>

<p>"Here, damn it," cried he, "tak't! Yer damn goo' f'ler an' I
wan' yehs tak't!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, now," said the waiter, with the sullen air of a man
who is forced into giving advice. "Put yer mon in yer pocket! Yer
loaded an' yehs on'y makes a damn fool of yerself."</p>

<p>As the latter passed out of the door the man turned pathetically
to the women.</p>

<p>"He don' know I'm damn goo' f'ler," cried he, dismally.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Pete, dear," said a woman of brilliance and
audacity, laying her hand with great affection upon his arm. "Never
you mind, old boy! We'll stay by you, dear!"</p>

<p>"Das ri'," cried the man, his face lighting up at the soothing
tones of the woman's voice. "Das ri', I'm damn goo' f'ler an' w'en
anyone trea's me ri', I treats zem ri'! Shee!"</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried the women. "And we're not goin' back on you, old
man."</p>

<p>The man turned appealing eyes to the woman of brilliance and
audacity. He felt that if he could be convicted of a contemptible
action he would die.</p>

<p>"Shay, Nell, damn it, I allus trea's yehs shquare, didn' I? I
allus been goo' f'ler wi' yehs, ain't I, Nell?"</p>

<p>"Sure you have, Pete," assented the woman. She delivered an
oration to her companions. "Yessir, that's a fact. Pete's a square
fellah, he is. He never goes back on a friend. He's the right kind
an' we stay by him, don't we, girls?"</p>

<p>"Sure," they exclaimed. Looking lovingly at him they raised
their glasses and drank his health.</p>

<p>"Girlsh," said the man, beseechingly, "I allus trea's yehs ri',
didn' I? I'm goo' f'ler, ain' I, girlsh?"</p>

<p>"Sure," again they chorused.</p>

<p>"Well," said he finally, "le's have nozzer drink, zen."</p>

<p>"That's right," hailed a woman, "that's right. Yer no bloomin'
jay! Yer spends yer money like a man. Dat's right."</p>

<p>The man pounded the table with his quivering fists.</p>

<p>"Yessir," he cried, with deep earnestness, as if someone
disputed him. "I'm damn goo' f'ler, an' w'en anyone trea's me ri',
I allus trea's&mdash;le's have nozzer drink."</p>

<p>He began to beat the wood with his glass.</p>

<p>"Shay," howled he, growing suddenly impatient. As the waiter did
not then come, the man swelled with wrath.</p>

<p>"Shay," howled he again.</p>

<p>The waiter appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Bringsh drinksh," said the man.</p>

<p>The waiter disappeared with the orders.</p>

<p>"Zat f'ler damn fool," cried the man. "He insul' me! I'm ge'man!
Can' stan' be insul'! I'm goin' lickim when comes!"</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the women, crowding about and trying to subdue
him. "He's all right! He didn't mean anything! Let it go! He's a
good fellah!"</p>

<p>"Din' he insul' me?" asked the man earnestly.</p>

<p>"No," said they. "Of course he didn't! He's all right!"</p>

<p>"Sure he didn' insul' me?" demanded the man, with deep anxiety
in his voice.</p>

<p>"No, no! We know him! He's a good fellah. He didn't mean
anything."</p>

<p>"Well, zen," said the man, resolutely, "I'm go' 'pol'gize!"</p>

<p>When the waiter came, the man struggled to the middle of the
floor.</p>

<p>"Girlsh shed you insul' me! I shay damn lie! I 'pol'gize!"</p>

<p>"All right," said the waiter.</p>

<p>The man sat down. He felt a sleepy but strong desire to
straighten things out and have a perfect understanding with
everybody.</p>

<p>"Nell, I allus trea's yeh shquare, din' I? Yeh likes me, don'
yehs, Nell? I'm goo' f'ler?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the woman of brilliance and audacity.</p>

<p>"Yeh knows I'm stuck on yehs, don' yehs, Nell?"</p>

<p>"Sure," she repeated, carelessly.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by a spasm of drunken adoration, he drew two or
three bills from his pocket, and, with the trembling fingers of an
offering priest, laid them on the table before the woman.</p>

<p>"Yehs knows, damn it, yehs kin have all got, 'cause I'm stuck on
yehs, Nell, damn't, I&mdash;I'm stuck on yehs, Nell&mdash;buy
drinksh&mdash;damn't&mdash;we're havin' heluva time&mdash;w'en
anyone trea's me ri'&mdash;I&mdash;damn't, Nell&mdash;we're havin'
heluva&mdash;time."</p>

<p>Shortly he went to sleep with his swollen face fallen forward on
his chest.</p>

<p>The women drank and laughed, not heeding the slumbering man in
the corner. Finally he lurched forward and fell groaning to the
floor.</p>

<p>The women screamed in disgust and drew back their skirts.</p>

<p>"Come ahn," cried one, starting up angrily, "let's get out of
here."</p>

<p>The woman of brilliance and audacity stayed behind, taking up
the bills and stuffing them into a deep, irregularly-shaped pocket.
A guttural snore from the recumbent man caused her to turn and look
down at him.</p>

<p>She laughed. "What a damn fool," she said, and went.</p>

<p>The smoke from the lamps settled heavily down in the little
compartment, obscuring the way out. The smell of oil, stifling in
its intensity, pervaded the air. The wine from an overturned glass
dripped softly down upon the blotches on the man's neck.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX</h2>

<p>In a room a woman sat at a table eating like a fat monk in a
picture.</p>

<p>A soiled, unshaven man pushed open the door and entered.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "Mag's dead."</p>

<p>"What?" said the woman, her mouth filled with bread.</p>

<p>"Mag's dead," repeated the man.</p>

<p>"Deh hell she is," said the woman. She continued her meal. When
she finished her coffee she began to weep.</p>

<p>"I kin remember when her two feet was no bigger dan yer t'umb,
and she weared worsted boots," moaned she.</p>

<p>"Well, whata dat?" said the man.</p>

<p>"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots," she cried.</p>

<p>The neighbors began to gather in the hall, staring in at the
weeping woman as if watching the contortions of a dying dog. A
dozen women entered and lamented with her. Under their busy hands
the rooms took on that appalling appearance of neatness and order
with which death is greeted.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened and a woman in a black gown rushed in
with outstretched arms. "Ah, poor Mary," she cried, and tenderly
embraced the moaning one.</p>

<p>"Ah, what ter'ble affliction is dis," continued she. Her
vocabulary was derived from mission churches. "Me poor Mary, how I
feel fer yehs! Ah, what a ter'ble affliction is a disobed'ent
chil'."</p>

<p>Her good, motherly face was wet with tears. She trembled in
eagerness to express her sympathy. The mourner sat with bowed head,
rocking her body heavily to and fro, and crying out in a high,
strained voice that sounded like a dirge on some forlorn pipe.</p>

<p>"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots an' her two feets
was no bigger dan yer t'umb an' she weared worsted boots, Miss
Smith," she cried, raising her streaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, me poor Mary," sobbed the woman in black. With low,
coddling cries, she sank on her knees by the mourner's chair, and
put her arms about her. The other women began to groan in different
keys.</p>

<p>"Yer poor misguided chil' is gone now, Mary, an' let us hope
it's fer deh bes'. Yeh'll fergive her now, Mary, won't yehs, dear,
all her disobed'ence? All her t'ankless behavior to her mudder an'
all her badness? She's gone where her ter'ble sins will be
judged."</p>

<p>The woman in black raised her face and paused. The inevitable
sunlight came streaming in at the windows and shed a ghastly
cheerfulness upon the faded hues of the room. Two or three of the
spectators were sniffling, and one was loudly weeping. The mourner
arose and staggered into the other room. In a moment she emerged
with a pair of faded baby shoes held in the hollow of her hand.</p>

<p>"I kin remember when she used to wear dem," cried she. The women
burst anew into cries as if they had all been stabbed. The mourner
turned to the soiled and unshaven man.</p>

<p>"Jimmie, boy, go git yer sister! Go git yer sister an' we'll put
deh boots on her feets!"</p>

<p>"Dey won't fit her now, yeh damn fool," said the man.</p>

<p>"Go git yer sister, Jimmie," shrieked the woman, confronting him
fiercely.</p>

<p>The man swore sullenly. He went over to a corner and slowly
began to put on his coat. He took his hat and went out, with a
dragging, reluctant step.</p>

<p>The woman in black came forward and again besought the
mourner.</p>

<p>"Yeh'll fergive her, Mary! Yeh'll fergive yer bad, bad, chil'!
Her life was a curse an' her days were black an' yeh'll fergive yer
bad girl? She's gone where her sins will be judged."</p>

<p>"She's gone where her sins will be judged," cried the other
women, like a choir at a funeral.</p>

<p>"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," said the woman in
black, raising her eyes to the sunbeams.</p>

<p>"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," responded the
others.</p>

<p>"Yeh'll fergive her, Mary!" pleaded the woman in black. The
mourner essayed to speak but her voice gave way. She shook her
great shoulders frantically, in an agony of grief. Hot tears seemed
to scald her quivering face. Finally her voice came and arose like
a scream of pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll fergive her! I'll fergive her!"</p>
