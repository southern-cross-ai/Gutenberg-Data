  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; A SKINFUL OF TROUBLE</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Lawson Wood</h3>

  <h3>First published as "Filer the Faithless" in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>,
  Dec 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">OF all the afflictions brought on a suffering civilization
  by the Limited Liability Acts as they stand in the statutes of this
  commercial country, few can exceed the troubles, pains, and harassments of
  Mr. Nathaniel Dowdall, consequent on his investment of an odd hundred pounds
  in Filer's Royal and Imperial Circus, Limited. It was no matter of a public
  issue of shares at the hands of a professional promoter, no case of a glowing
  prospectus with a titled directorate. Filer, of Filer's Royal and Imperial
  Circus, indeed, made fresh issues of shares whenever he found the
  opportunity, and wherever he fell across the confiding investor. He was
  managing director, and, it is to be presumed, the rest of the board also. He
  was Filer, and there was the long and short, the thick and thin, the
  beginning and end of it. From time to time the capital of Filer, Limited, was
  increased by just as much as some hopeful stranger might be persuaded to
  entrust to Filer, managing director, in exchange for an elegantly printed
  certificate constituting him a partner (limited) in the joys and sorrows of
  Filer. Then Filer's Royal and Imperial Circus passed on, and, if the new
  shareholder remained quiescent, there was nobody in the world so ready to let
  bygones be bygones as the magnanimous Filer.</p>

  <p>Mr. Nathaniel Dowdall did not remain quiescent. He followed Filer with
  letters, monthly, fortnightly, and then weekly. Some came back through the
  Dead Letter Office, a few vanished wholly into the unknown, but some caught
  Filer at towns where the circus pitched, and others overtook him, redirected;
  and that in sufficient numbers to grow, after a year or so, something of a
  nuisance to the otherwise unruffled Filer. So much so, that he went as far as
  to answer one or two of the later and more violent, in a tone of flowery
  affability. And then Mr. Dowdall wrote thus:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Without Prejudice.<br>
  <br>
  613 BRAMBLERURY ROAD,<br>
  STREATHAM HILL, S. W.,<br>
  May 15th.<br>
  <br>
  SIR,&mdash;I will have no more of your evasions and promises. You have
  obtained my money by fraudulent misrepresentation, and I demand its instant
  return. Unless I receive by Thursday next your cheque for the sum of one
  hundred pounds, I shall place the whole affair in the hands of my solicitors
  to deal with as they consider best, with a view not only to the recovery of
  the money, but to the proper punishment of a disgraceful fraud. This letter
  is final.<br>
  <br>
  Your obedient servant,<br>
  NATHANIEL DOWDALL</p><br>

  <p>It would be difficult, thought Mr. Dowdall (and Mrs. Dowdall agreed with
  him), to devise a more peremptory missive than this; though indeed, since
  each of the last two letters had ended with the declaration that it was
  final, the concluding clause might be considered by now to have lost some of
  its force. But on the other hand, "Without Prejudice" was quite new, and very
  terrible to behold. Filer's answer, however, came in this form:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">FILER'S ROYAL AND IMPERIAL CIRCUS, LIMITED,<br>
  May 16th.<br>
  <br>
  MY DEAR MR. NATHANIEL DOWDALL,&mdash;My natural delight at hearing once again
  from so highly esteemed a friend and partner as yourself was somewhat
  chastened by a suspicion that the tone of your letter was one of irritation.
  I need hardly assure you that it would afford me the highest and purest
  pleasure to comply with your thoughtful suggestion that I should send you my
  cheque for one hundred pounds, but I have reason to believe that the
  presentation of that cheque at the bank would result in a pang of
  disappointment which far be it from me to inflict upon you. The stream of
  wealth, in fact, which is destined inevitably to overtake our enterprise in
  time, and which I shall welcome chiefly because it will enable me to direct a
  large volume of it toward you, is meeting with a temporary obstruction. In
  the meantime permit me to thank you for the kind thought which prompted your
  charmingly original heading, and to rejoice to learn that you are still
  without prejudice against<br>
  <br>
  Your devoted, though temporarily embarrassed partner,<br>
  PLANTAGENET FILER</p><br>

  <p>Mr. Dowdall perused this letter with eyes that emerged steadily till they
  threatened to overhang his most prominent waistcoat-button. Speechless he
  passed it across the breakfast-table to Mrs. Dowdall, who, having read it in
  her turn, barely mustered the words, "Well, I never did!"</p>

  <p>This was Mr. Dowdall's rejoinder, written after an hour's interval of
  simmering wrath:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">STREATHAM HILL, S. W.,<br>
  May 17th.<br>
  <br>
  MR. FILER, I am not to be turned aside by impudent flippancy. I may remind
  you that, even though you may have made away with my money, you have goods
  which may be seized in satisfaction of my claim, and unless I receive the sum
  of which you have defrauded me before the end of the week I shall take steps
  to secure it by the means provided by law. This letter is final.<br>
  <br>
  NATHANIEL DOWDALL</p><br>

  <p>As Mr. Dowdall anticipated, this produced a change in Filer's attitude.
  His answer, still amiable in tone, indicated surrender:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">FILER'S ROYAL AND IMPERIAL CIRCUS, LIMITED,<br>
  May 18th.<br>
  <br>
  MY DEAR MR. DOWDALL,&mdash;It grieves me to perceive, from your last letter,
  that my fear of a certain irritation on your part of late was well-founded,
  and I hasten to remove all occasion for an asperity which I feel sure you
  have already regretted. My sorrow is chiefly that you should cut yourself off
  from participation in the noble revenues which are shortly to accrue to this
  enterprise; but, rather than my honor should be in any way called in
  question, I will even encounter the bitterness of this disappointment. It
  would increase my distress, if, in addition to your sacrifice of the golden
  opportunity, you were to incur legal expense; and therefore I am now freely
  handing over to you a valuable part of the property of this company, more
  than equivalent to the sum you have invested. It should arrive in the course
  of a day or so, by rail, in a large case, carriage forward. I am now leaving
  England, with the enterprise, for an extended Continental tour, and take the
  opportunity of tendering you my heartiest farewells, and expressing my
  pleasure that our business connection terminates in friendly concord.<br>
  <br>
  Your late partner, but eternal well-wisher,<br>
  PLANTAGENET FILER<br>
  <br>
  P.S.&mdash;The case should be handled with care. It is not a new one, and in
  some places it is not altogether what one might wish.&mdash;P. F.</p><br>

  <p>This was far more satisfactory, and Mr. Dowdall beamed as he passed the
  letter to his wife, who beamed again as she handed it back. Plainly he had
  gone the right way to work to bring such a fellow as Filer to his senses.
  Clearly Filer had realized at last that Nathaniel Dowdall was not to be
  trifled with, and had offered the best composition in his power without
  waiting for a legal seizure. Perhaps, also, there was a little in Mrs.
  Dowdall's suggestion that some traces of honesty lingered in Filer's system
  yet; for, in truth, he might have left the country without notice, and so
  have removed his goods beyond the reach of bailiffs.</p>

  <p>There were possible awkwardnesses to be considered, of course. Showmen's
  accessories were of little use to Mr. Dowdall, and might prove difficult to
  dispose of. But that was a matter best left till the goods came to hand. For
  the rest of that day and for some part of the next Mr. Dowdall was patient
  and hopeful. And then the case arrived.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowdall was sitting in the inconvenient little back room which the
  household was taught to call his study, and Mrs. Dowdall was consulting him
  on the eternal domestic question, beef or mutton; when the blank and
  bewildered face of Selina the housemaid appeared at the door, and the hand of
  Selina extended towards Mr. Dowdall a large biscuit-colored delivery
  sheet.</p>

  <p>"It's the railway van, sir," announced Selina; "and they've brought a
  tiger."</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403411h-images/GreenGinger01-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"A tiger!" gasped Mr. Dowdall, quite forgetting to shut his mouth after
  the utterance.</p>

  <p>And "A tiger!" echoed Mrs. Dowdall, faintly, opening her mouth wider
  still.</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'm," replied the housemaid. "It's in a big wooden cage, a-howlin'
  an' stampin' an' goin' on dreadful. And there's six pound four and eightpence
  to pay."</p>

  <p>In the blank pause that followed, vague rumblings, shouts, and yelps from
  the direction of the street reached the ears of Mr. Dowdall, like the
  ancestral voices that prophesied war to Kubla Khan. He rose, murmuring
  helplessly; his murmurs increased as he reached the study door, and the
  burden of their plaint was, "Six pound four and eightpence!"</p>

  <p>Then he turned suddenly on Selina. "I won't have it!" he exclaimed. "Send
  it away."</p>

  <p>And Mrs. Dowdall, awakened to a sudden sense of danger, caught his arm,
  pushed Selina into the passage, and shut the door after her in one
  complicated spasm of presence of mind.</p>

  <p>The noises from the street grew in volume, and it was clear that a public
  attraction had been scented, and the inevitable torrent of shouting boys had
  set in. Presently Selina returned with the report that, whether Mr. Dowdall
  paid the railway charges or waited to be sued for them, the tiger addressed
  to him would be delivered there and then. The men, it seemed, had given her
  to understand that the tiger's society was no longer desired, either by
  themselves or by any other person connected with the railway.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Mr. Dowdall, recovering something of his natural
  sense of civic propriety. "People can't be expected to take in any tigers
  anybody likes to address to them! It would undermine the whole fabric of
  society. I&mdash;I won't be bullied. Is the front door shut?"</p>

  <p>The front door was shut, and with so much of assured security Mr. Dowdall
  betook himself to the drawing-room, the window whereof commanded the nearest
  view of the street and the area railings. Boys were competing for seats on
  those same railings, and the standing-room in the street was growing rapidly
  less. From the tail of a large van stout planks sloped, and down these planks
  slid a huge wooden, iron-bound case, lowered by many ropes in the hands of
  several excited men. From within the case came angry growls, and as it
  reached the pavement, Mr. Dowdall observed that its front was a sort of door
  of stout iron-clamped planks, with narrow intervals between them, through
  which intervals came glimpses of restless fiery yellow fur.</p>

  <p>The case came to rest before the railings, and the carman, perceiving Mr.
  Dowdall at the window, waved the biscuit-colored delivery sheet and hailed
  him. Mr. Dowdall raised the sash and parleyed.</p>

  <p>"Are you goin' to pay this 'ere money now, sir?" demanded the carman.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," retorted Mr. Dowdall. "I don't want a tiger&mdash;I
  didn't order one&mdash;the whole thing's a&mdash;a clerical error. Mark it
  'Dead Parcels Office' and take it back!"</p>

  <p>"Dead parcels!" repeated the carman, with withering scorn. "It about the
  livest parcel I ever see, an' it's pretty near marked some of us gettin' it
  'ere. Dead parcels! It's my orders to leave it 'ere, pay or not, sign or not;
  an' the comp'ny'll see you about the charges afterwards. Dead parcels! 'Ere,
  git up!"</p>

  <p>And with that the carman sought his perch, and the van clattered away with
  its retinue of ropes, planks, and wholly untipped porters.</p>

  <p>The crowd was bigger and noisier every minute, and the bolder among the
  boys were already tentatively pushing sticks between the planks, to the
  manifest disapproval of the tiger; and as he watched, Mr. Dowdall recalled
  the warning that the case was "not altogether what one might wish." He broke
  into a sweat of apprehension, wildly wondering what would be the legal charge
  for an ordinary street boy devoured by a tiger. And as he wondered there
  appeared, towering above the heads by the street corner, a policeman's
  helmet.</p>

  <p>The policeman elbowed steadily through the crowd, sternly ordering it to
  "pass along there," without any particular result. He walked cautiously round
  the case and observed the direction on the label. Then he ascended Mr.
  Dowdall's front steps and was about to ring the bell; when Mr. Dowdall, with
  diplomatic resource, addressed him first from the window.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, constable," he said. "There's a tiger down there I want
  cleared away from my doorstep."</p>

  <p>This would not seem to have been a request for which the policeman was
  prepared. He paused, looked back at the case, and then again at Mr.
  Dowdall.</p>

  <p>"It's your tiger, sir," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," replied Mr. Dowdall, airily; "not at all. Somebody seems to have
  dropped it&mdash;out of a cart, I fancy." He inwardly congratulated himself
  on the conscientious accuracy of this conjecture. "Yes," he added, "I am
  pretty sure it was dropped out of a cart."</p>

  <p>"It's got your name and address on it, anyhow," retorted the
  policeman.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, yes; that's merely a&mdash;a coincidence. A tiger might have
  anybody's name on it, you know; not at all uncommon. Done to throw you off
  the scent. I should think there'd be quite a handsome reward for finding a
  thing like that, if you took it to the station."</p>

  <p>The policeman, sternly contemptuous, disregarded the suggestion. "That
  tiger's causin' an obstruction," he said severely.</p>

  <p>"Yes," assented Mr. Dowdall. "Shocking! I give it in charge."</p>

  <p>The constable, with rising wrath, surveyed the crowd that now filled the
  street, and turned once more to Mr. Dowdall. "That tiger's your property," he
  said, "and if you don't take it indoors it'll be my dooty to summons you."
  And with that he produced a notebook and wrote laboriously.</p>

  <p>And now as he wrote, a sergeant arrived, who positively ordered Mr.
  Dowdall to take his tiger indoors instantly. Mr. Dowdall desperately
  contemplated the prospect of standing a siege of public, police, and tiger
  combined; when there arrived on the heels of the others an inspector, a far
  better diplomatist than either of his inferior officers. He first carefully
  examined the case and its inscriptions, and then politely inquired if Mr.
  Dowdall were in any way connected with Filer's Circus. Mr. Dowdall was
  cornered. To deny Filer's Circus to a responsible police-officer meant to
  renounce the hope of redress from Filer. Mr. Dowdall first hesitated and then
  admitted his partnership; and straightway was deprived of all defence.</p>

  <p>"Ah, just so," said the diplomatic inspector. "I see you've a nice wide
  stable entrance in the side road&mdash;we'll see about getting him in there.
  Three or four men with rollers and crowbars can do it in no time. I should
  think you could get the men and the tackle too from Brady's in five minutes;
  I'll send a man to see about it for you."</p>

  <p>Now, perhaps partly because of the soothing manner of the inspector, Mr.
  Dowdall was beginning to feel a little less alarmed at the state of affairs.
  The tiger had not killed anybody yet, and seemed to have grown a good deal
  quieter now that his not very roomy habitation had come to rest; and that
  same habitation had as yet shown no signs of giving way anywhere. The front
  planks were so strong, the padlock was so very large, and the air-spaces were
  so very narrow that the creature could scarcely see, let alone get out. And
  indeed a tiger was no doubt rather a valuable possession, if you could find a
  buyer. There would be no great risk in allowing the case and its prisoner to
  stand in the back garden, with all doors locked, for a little while&mdash;an
  hour or so&mdash;till he could get an offer for it. For by now Mr. Dowdall's
  natural business instincts were beginning to assert themselves, and he had
  formed a plan.</p>

  <p>He calmed the natural agitation of Mrs. Dowdall, and dispatched an urgent
  telegram to Padgebury, the eminent wild beast dealer of Shadwell,
  thus:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">TO PADGEBURY, OR ANYBODY IN CHARGE, SHADWELL.&mdash;COME
  INSTANTLY. MAGNIFICENT BUSINESS OPENING. UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY.&mdash;DOWDALL,
  613, BRAMBLEBURY ROAD, S.W.</p><br>

  <p>This done, Mr. Dowdall resigned himself, with comparative equanimity, to
  observing the exertions of a dozen dishevelled men, who, with strong arms and
  much stronger language, shoved and hauled and scuffled the iron-bound case
  along the pavement and round the corner, and so through the gates at the
  side, amid the enthusiasm of the populace, and to the newly aroused growls
  and flops of the tiger. Somebody suggested a joint of beef to keep the beast
  quiet, and all the men suggested beer for other purposes, when at last the
  case rested in the farthest corner of the stable-yard. The joint of beef was
  found to be too large to pass between the planks, when presented at the end
  of a pole, and so had to be hacked into small pieces; but the only distinct
  complaint about the beer was that it was not large enough. On the whole,
  considering these things and the railway company's claims, Mr. Dowdall found
  himself making a considerable further investment in Filer.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Also he discovered that he had the honor of receiving the famous Wrestling
  Tiger, as announced by a bill which the thoughtful Filer had pasted on one
  side of the case; whereon it was made known that at Filer's Royal and
  Imperial Circus the gifted quadruped would wrestle a fall every night in its
  cage, with its trainer, or with any gentleman in the house who would oblige;
  having already killed fifteen champion wrestlers in sundry European capitals,
  with great applause from the discriminating public. Mr. Dowdall was somewhat
  gratified to find himself in possession of so valuable an animal, and blamed
  himself for his early anxiety to repudiate its ownership.</p>

  <p>Early in the afternoon a man arrived from Padgebury's. He was a mild,
  colorless person, in shabby corduroys, and he had come, he explained, because
  Mr. Padgebury and his head man were out on business, and the telegram seemed
  to be important.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Dowdall, impressively, "it was&mdash;for Mr. Padgebury;
  most important. The fact is, when I sent that telegram I had reluctantly
  decided to part with my tiger&mdash;the most magnificent and talented
  creature ever placed upon the market. I'm not so sure about it now, but a
  sufficiently good offer might tempt me. It's in the stable-yard; go and look
  at it while I wait here."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head feebly. "Tigers ain't my department, sir," he said;
  "it's the canaries what I look after. If it 'ad a-been a pipin' bullfinch
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but surely," protested Mr. Dowdall, "as a responsible man from
  Padgebury's&mdash;a leading man on the staff, you know&mdash;you can deal
  with just a simple matter of an ordinary tiger. Come now; just go and run
  your eye over him."</p>

  <p>But the man shook his head again. "I ain't no judge of a tiger," he
  replied. "I don't know 'is p'ints. Anything in the way of a redpoll I could
  take on easy. An' if you ain't sure you really want to sell 'im, p'r'aps
  you'd better think it over for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;not at all," Mr. Dowdall interposed, hastily. "I'd rather
  get the parting over at once and have done with it. I'd like you to go and
  tell Mr. Padgebury about it as soon as he gets back. It's a most
  extraordinary tiger&mdash;wrestles, and does card tricks, and all that. When
  will Mr. Padgebury be back?"</p>

  <p>The canary-tamer was not quite certain, but it was pretty sure to be some
  time in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Very well, get him to come along at once with a van. But there's one
  thing you might tell me," Mr. Dowdall proceeded, confidentially. "You'd
  scarcely believe it, but some of my servants are foolishly nervous about that
  tiger. Now, you are a man of experience. Couldn't you give it something to
  keep it quiet till Mr. Padgebury comes?"</p>

  <p>"Beef?" suggested the canary-man, interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"It's got beef," Mr. Dowdall replied. "But I don't mean food. Something to
  send it to sleep, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Whisky," replied the shabby man promptly. "They tame hedgehogs with
  that."</p>

  <p>"But how can I give a tiger whisky?"</p>

  <p>The canary-man rubbed his ear thoughtfully for a moment. Then he said:
  "force 'is mouth open and pour it down 'is throat."</p>

  <p>But a very little more conversation made it clear that neither Mr. Dowdall
  nor the man from Padgebury's was prepared to adopt this method personally;
  and after a little more negotiation it was agreed that Padgebury's retainer
  should visit the stable-yard with a view to devising a less adventurous means
  of administering the whisky.</p>

  <p>Presently he returned and reported his plan. "There's precious little room
  between the planks," he said. "In fact, you can't properly see in without
  shoving your eye rayther too close to the door. But there's a bit of an iron
  trough fixed inside, with water, an' if I'd got a good large basinful o'
  whisky, an' the garden squirt, I think I could get some of it into the
  trough."</p>

  <p>A quart of whisky was produced accordingly, and the garden squirt; and in
  five minutes more the canary-man returned to report complete success, and to
  receive a fee of half a crown. Furthermore, he received fervid injunctions to
  send the whole Padgebury tiger-staff at the earliest possible moment; and so
  departed.</p>

  <p>Perfect silence fell upon the stable-yard. Not a growl could be heard by a
  listener from any window at the back of the house, and the boot-boy,
  reconnoitring the stable-yard, reported that the tiger was motionless at the
  bottom of the cage&mdash;probably asleep. The household excitement was
  relieved, and household affairs began to resume their course.</p>

  <p>Half an hour&mdash;an hour&mdash;an hour and a half&mdash;two hours passed
  in peace and quiet; and then, with a sudden burst of frantic shrieks, the
  cook, the boot-boy, and Selina came up the kitchen stairs in a rush. The
  tiger! The tiger! The tiger was climbing through the scullery window!</p>

  <p>Who was first and who was last of the whole household out of the front
  door will never be known; it is merely conjectured that Mr. Dowdall was
  <i>not</i> the last, because foremost in this moment of peril, he was
  certainly first round the street corner, where he was so fortunate as to butt
  heavily into a policeman.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, constable," gasped Mr. Dowdall, maintaining his balance by
  hugging the policeman's arm; "good evening! There's an interesting pet of my
  wife's gone astray in the house, and I think if you were to keep guard at the
  front door while I send for Padgebury's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Padgebury's?" repeated the policeman, suspiciously. "Padgebury's? What's
  this 'ere pet? Is it the tiger as there's been such a fuss about?"</p>

  <p>"Well," admitted Mr. Dowdall, glancing back apprehensively, "as a matter
  of fact, it <i>is</i> what you might more or less call a tiger, so to speak,
  but there's no need to feel alarmed on that account. I give you full
  authority to use your truncheon."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you do, do you?" observed the man, strangely ungratefully.
  Nevertheless, he looked cautiously round the corner, and then began to walk
  toward Mr. Dowdall's front door, followed by that gentleman at some little
  distance. For it chanced that this was an ambitious young policeman, anxious
  to distinguish himself; and he hoped that there might be a possibility of
  doing it at no vast risk, after all. Wherefore it was with some irritation
  that he heard the shriek of a police-whistle farther up the road, where Mrs.
  Dowdall had taken refuge with a friend, who always kept the instrument
  handy.</p>

  <p>The whistle had the effect of hurrying the young policeman, who resolved,
  if he could not be the sole representative of the force on the spot, at any
  rate to be the first. He mounted the front steps, cautiously approached the
  open door, and looked in. He ventured as far as the mat, and then beyond it,
  listening intently. And then he cleared the doorstep in one bound, closing
  the door behind him with great agility, but turning instantly to peep through
  a clear part of the glass panel. For he had been scared by the apparition of
  a great yellow head rising over the lower stairs.</p>

  <p>"It's gone upstairs!" he cried, presently, for the information of anybody
  within hearing; which was nobody.</p>

  <p>For the whistle was attracting stragglers to the house where its
  possessor, with distended countenance, was blowing it from the first-floor
  window, and Mr. Dowdall, in the doorway of a neighbor opposite, was
  dispatching a stream of telegrams to Padgebury, like minute-guns.</p>

  <p>And in the midst of all this arrived Padgebury's van, with the great
  Padgebury himself and half a dozen stalwart retainers, and much tackle of
  iron and rope. Padgebury had started out immediately on the report of his
  canary-tamer, and so had escaped the fire of telegrams which Mr. Dowdall was
  still maintaining.</p>

  <p>The wild beast dealer shook his head when he learned the state of affairs.
  "You didn't say he was loose in the house when you offered to sell him," he
  observed, solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was thinking of allowing a discount in consideration of that,"
  replied Mr. Dowdall; "a moderate discount."</p>

  <p>Padgebury shook his head again. "In our trade," he said, "you'll find
  there's a deal of difference between a loose tiger and one in a cage. Loose
  tigers don't command any price to speak of. There's no demand for 'em."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he consented to reconnoitre, with a view to securing Mr.
  Dowdall's specimen, on the understanding that if no deal resulted he should
  charge for his services. And so, slowly, with many precautions, the front
  door was opened, and Padgebury and his staff, listening anxiously, approached
  the stairs a few steps at a time.</p>

  <p>After a pause of careful peeping Padgebury, greatly daring, crept up the
  stairs and listened on the landing. Then he beckoned silently to his men, who
  followed with as little noise as possible, and found their principal pointing
  significantly at a bedroom door, standing ajar, from beyond which came
  distinct sounds of heavy breathing.</p>

  <p>The men gathered on the landing, awaiting orders. And then suddenly there
  arose from within the room the sound of a loud, horrible yawn, and following
  that, in a thick but cheerful voice, the chorus&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Put me among the girrls!<br>
  Put me among the girrls!<br>
  Do me a favor, do!<br>
  I'll do the same for you,<br>
  If you'll put&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Padgebury bounced into the room, and the chorus broke off; and his men,
  crowding behind him, saw the tiger lying at length on the bed, fur and teeth
  and whiskers complete, with a decanter hugged under one paw.</p>

  <p>"Whirroo!" cried the tiger. "Get out! 'Tis enough to give a man the
  palpitations to have yez jumpin' out av nowhere like that, an ugly crowd! An'
  me that unwell an' all! Get out wid yez!"</p>

  <p>Padgebury turned one glance of amazement on his staff, and then, being a
  prompt man, seized the tiger by the jaw, forced it open, and peered into the
  cavernous skull. "Why, I believe it's Lanigan!" he said.</p>

  <p>"What, Misther Padgebury!" cried the tiger. "'Tis the blessin' av the
  wurrld to see ye, Misther Padgebury. Oh, Mr. Padgebury, 'tis moighty lonely I
  am! Nobody loves me in this&mdash;this&mdash;this here outrajis integument.
  They trate me like a leper; an' 'tis drouthy work, growlin' like a tiger two
  days together, an' moighty poor conversation, wid no provisions but wan bag
  av biscuits. Misther Padgebury, is all av 'em you, or is there a dirthy crowd
  av ruffins in this room?"</p>

  <p>"There's enough of us here to see you safely to the police-station,
  anyhow," answered Padgebury, grimly. "What's this game?"</p>

  <p>"Misther Padgebury, dear, if ye shpake to me like that I'll cry like a
  babby, an' me that broken-hearted too. Take a drop from the
  decanther&mdash;'tis good stuff in this house. An' where's that
  gallows-hoppin' thief, Filer?"</p>

  <p>"Filer? I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Filer's Circus started for the Continent the day afore yesterday, so I
  heard," observed one of Padgebury's men.</p>

  <p>"What?" wailed the tiger. "The day before yesterday? Then I'm robbed to
  the skin an' bones av me! Sivin months have I been doin' the wrestlin' tiger
  an' makin' the fortune av the show, an' not two months' pay have I got out av
  it! An' now he's given me the shake afther all! The curse o' the wurrld on
  the ugly head av him! I'll tell ye, Misther Padgebury. The wrestling tiger
  was the only thing that brought the show a pinny, though 'tis meself that
  says ut. Night afther night I towld Filer I'd give the swindle away in the
  middle av the show if I didn't get my money, an' night afther night he
  blarneyed me into goin' through once more. Ye see, we'd thumpin' thick bars
  to the cage, an' 'twasn't likely anybody not b'longing to the show was comin'
  investigatin' too close, let alone goin' wrestlin' with a tiger; so we faced
  it out aisy enough till I threatened, an' thin Filer blarneyed me. But at
  last I'd be blarneyed no more, an' I got a rale paper summons for him; an'
  thin says Filer, frightened by the paper summons; 'I'm at the bottom av my
  finances, Lanigan, me boy, an' what I haven't got I can't pay. But we'll
  raise some,' says he, 'if ye'll tear up that nasty summons an' do as I tell
  ye. Now, there's a troublesome ould parrty as calls himself a shareholder,'
  says he, 'an' I'll put ye in a close-nailed case and sind ye to him. An' I'll
  be along there as soon as you will an' sooner,' says Filer, 'bekase I'll go
  by passenger thrain an' you by goods. An' whin the ould man's terrified into
  fits with havin' a rampin', ragin' tiger brought to his peaceful risidence,
  why, I'll get him to pay a call on his shares on conditions av takin' you
  away again. Thin,' says Filer, 'I'll pay every cint av your money and a
  present to the top av it!' Misther Padgebury, I did ut; an' afther that niver
  again ask me to be a tiger, nor a package on any goods thrain! I'm bruised
  all over me like a toad, and the lovely featherbed itself is hard to me
  bones."</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked Padgebury, "you don't seem to have done much good for
  yourself since you left me, and you're in a bigger scrape now than ever.
  There's Mr. Dowdall and a policeman at the front door."</p>

  <p>"Misther Dowdall's a jintleman," said the tiger. "He's the only man that
  iver gave me whisky out av a garden squirrt. Plensheous whisky. It was the
  whisky, an' nothing but ut, that gave me the courage to open the padlock and
  come to look for some more. Give my compliments to Misther Dowdall an' tell
  him he's a betther man than his partner, an' I'd rather dale with him. The
  firrm owes me thirty-wan pound ten an' six."</p>

  <p>And the tiger pulled its mouth open with its right paw, and thrust the
  neck of the decanter once again between the cruel fangs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE ABSENT THREE</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was never a more popular man in Essex than Dan Fisk,
  whom I have heard called the biggest liar in the county. But that was said in
  the old days of innocence, when there were no newly built parts, where liars
  now flourish exceedingly among the other improvements.</p>

  <p>If Dan were a liar (a thing I expressly decline to admit), he had the
  excuse&mdash;the justification, rather&mdash;of the artist. Thick and round
  of body, with a face whereon a vast grin and a dazzling squint perpetually
  struggled for mastery, Dan was a humorist, first and Iast. A solemn person
  was Dan Fisk's natural prey, and with subtle art and unchanging feature Dan
  would urge his solemnity over the edge of unseemliness into the abysm of the
  ridiculous; and any archer of the long-bow found in Dan an ever-ready abettor
  and puller of the unconscious leg.</p>

  <p>Dan is gathered to his fathers long since, and so long that his tombstone
  has acquired a rollicking inclination to the left, and moss and weather have
  so painted it that the fat cherub's face that overlooks the inscription meets
  the gaze with a permanent wink; which is the properest accident in the world,
  and exactly as Dan Fisk would have had it.</p>

  <p>He was a sober man, yet at this distance of time I can never call up the
  memory of his jolly face without a background from the parlor of the Castle
  Inn; either the enormous geraniums that stood in the bow-window at the front,
  or the settle in the corner, or the wide fireplace and its blazing embers,
  stuck with black extinguisher-shaped beer-warmers. And it was a very good
  background, too, being also excellently suitable to Sam Prentice, Roboshobery
  Dove, and Abel Pennyfather, with his big walking-stick made out of a
  thistle-stem from Burton's farm; the tale whereof Abel Pennyfather told
  nightly in this place, beginning with a mighty bang of the stick itself on
  the table, and a challenge to everybody to guess what the timber was.</p>

  <p>It was a challenge that nobody accepted, well known as the stick and its
  story were. For Abel Pennyfather instantly began to shout the tale over again
  in the voice of a contentious bull, so that every other sound was drowned
  till the tale was told.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" Abel concluded on one such night; "'How d'ye like my
  walkin'-stick?' says I. 'fine bit o' timber, ben't it? Much obliged to ye for
  it,' I says. 'Got it out of a wheatfield o' yourn, an' left plenty more
  behind. Why don't ye grow walkin'-sticks for reg'lar crop?' Lord, that mad he
  were!"</p>

  <p>And with that Abel Pennyfather took a vast drink from the fullest mug on
  the table, which chanced to be the mug of Banham the carrier.</p>

  <p>Banham stared at Pennyfather and the mugs, and began: "Why, ben't
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Better sarve him out next time," observed Dan Fisk, squinting into Abel
  Pennyfather's own mug. "This ain't wuth reachin' for."</p>

  <p>"Why," cried Abel, with wide eyes, "I han't a-drunk o' the wrong mug, hey
  I? Well, well, now, 'tis wonnerful how absent I be, a-thinkin'!"</p>

  <p>"Wonnerful deep thinkin' it be, too," pursued Dan Fisk, transferring his
  squint to the outraged mug, and tilting it the better to peep. "Wonnerful
  deep. Nothin' could make it deeper but a bigger mug."</p>

  <p>"But 'tis my way, neighbors," Pennyfather went on loftily. "You might
  scarce believe as I walked past my own gate the other day, think-in' hard
  about a sick cow. Ay, an' when I remembered, an' turned back, danged if I
  den't get a-thinkin' agen, an' walk past the gate a second time, just as far
  as fust. Danged if I den't!"</p>

  <p>"If I couldn't shorten my thoughts, I'd widen the gate," commented Dan.
  "Ben't proper to hey ordinary furniture for such an extraordinary man."</p>

  <p>Sarcasm was not a thing that Abel Penny-father understood. "'Tis like
  not," he replied, with plain gratification. "And anyhow, I count I can claim
  there ben't so absent a man as me, one time or another, no, not in arl
  Essex."</p>

  <p>For it was a failing of Abel Pennyfather to claim pre-eminence, at the top
  of a very large voice, in anything whatsoever that might come under
  discussion in his presence&mdash;anything in the world, even if it were only
  bunions.</p>

  <p>"Ah," Dan Fisk replied with a shake of the head and an almost
  imperceptible brightening of the squint, "you be absent-minded enough, I make
  no doubt. I don't call to memory many with mind more absent from their heads
  than you, sarten to say."</p>

  <p>"No, not one, I say," Abel pursued, with growing pride. "Never one in arl
  Essex."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you can be beat. There's the three Brewitts."</p>

  <p>"I dunno no Brewitts, but I uphold they ben't a touch to me. Why, I tell
  'ee, t'other day, an' none so long ago neither, I sat an' made up my market
  cipherin' with my lighted pipe, a-smokin' my pencil all the time. Ah, I did
  that!"</p>

  <p>"'Twere a true notable feat, that, no doubt, but it were only once. Now,
  oad Tom Brewitt, he never lit a candle but what he hulled it out o' winder
  and set up the match to read by."</p>

  <p>"Allus did it?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, allus. Oad Sim Cloyse paid a boy two shillun a week to sit outside of
  evenings an'' pick up candles. Rare eye to business had oad Sim Cloyse."</p>

  <p>"That there's a yarn. Not that it's anythin' particular. I've a-done many
  a more highly absent-minded thing myself, so I don't count it much. But I
  never heard o' that Tom Brewitt. Who were he?"</p>

  <p>"Tom Brewitt? Why, he were Bob Brewitt's brother, surely."</p>

  <p>"Well, an' who were Bob? I s'pose you'll say he were Tom's brother?"</p>

  <p>"No," Dan replied; "that wouldn't be a straightforard answer. Bob were
  brother to Sam, an' Sam were brother to both on 'em. You may disbelieve in
  Tom by hisself, an' 'tis arl a possibility you might cast doubts on Bob; but
  you can't get away with Tom, Bob, and Sam together; 'taren't logic."</p>

  <p>"'Tis a true word, an' a very reasonable argyment," observed Banham the
  carrier, with a judicial shake of the head. And the company murmured
  agreement.</p>

  <p>Abel Pennyfather stared blankly for five seconds. Then he said: "Well,
  well, I'm not sayin' 'taren't. I only said I never heared tell on 'em. An' I
  don't think so overmuch of Tom Brewitt's absent-minded doin's, nayther."</p>

  <p>"There again," Dan went on, "you mightn't think much of Tom's
  absent-mindedness, an' maybe you might doubt the quality of Bob's; but when
  you come to Sam's, an' more especial when you come to Tom's an' Bob's an'
  Sam's all together, then there aren't no more argufyin'. They be too many for
  any argufyer."</p>

  <p>"Well, that may be," persisted Abel Penny-father, "but I hoad a shillun,
  man for man, they den't beat me. Now I tell 'ee, when we putt the four-acre
  field down to grass, I were a-goin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did your absence o' mind ever keep your sister an oad maid all her life?"
  demanded Dan.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," Abel admitted, "seein' as you know she's been married three
  times a'ready. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you're beat," interrupted Dan. "You're beat all to crumbles, as
  anybody can tell you as knows the story o' the three Brewitts an' their
  sister Jane. An' who don't know that?"</p>

  <p>It seemed that nobody knew it, a discovery whereat Dan expressed profound
  surprise. "Why," he said, "the three Brewitts kep' farm up there beyond
  Thundersley&mdash;I'll call the very name to mind, presently,
  maybe&mdash;long enough ago. There was Tom, Bob, an' Sam, like as I've told
  you. They was bachelors all, by reason of absence of mind. Tom forgot to go
  to church on his weddin'-day, and was clawed down the face an' forsook for
  that reason. Bob was all arranged for, by the other party an' her relations,
  but when they got him there he forgot to ask her the question, so the
  fam'lies was enemies henceforth, an' his absence of mind saved him. Sam
  forgot about marryin' altogether, an' died at eighty-fower without having
  remembered it. Their sister Jane, she were a single woman at forty for a
  different reason. What prevented her weren't so much the absence of her mind
  as the presence of her face. 'Twere a face o' vinegar, an' no mistake."</p>

  <p>"Was it as ugly as yours, Dan?" Prentice asked, with much show of
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Wuss than that, a mile," Dan resumed, unperturbed. "'Twere as bad as any
  man's face in this here room, though you'd scarce believe it. 'Twould ha'
  kep' a regiment out o' gunshot; and there's no guessing how her brothers
  lived in the same house with it, 'cept they were too absent-minded to notice.
  Little boys used to go the other way round to school for fear o' seeing Jane
  Brewitt, and 'twere said nothing could be made o' the milk on that farm 'cept
  cheese."</p>

  <p>"Talkin' o' cheese," interposed Abel Pennyfather, "I've made as much
  as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We won't talk o' cheese, then!" shouted Dan, and the company supported
  him with clamor sufficient to quell Abel. "We won't talk o' cheese, but come
  back to Jane Brewitt. She were a good enough housekeeper, spite of her face,
  an' a good housekeeper were needful in a place with three sich moonin'
  gapesters about. She were a good housekeeper, and, what with one thing an
  t'other, business were good an' good again at Brewitts'; an' Bob Brewitt, he
  had a safe let into his bedroom wall, and a good full cashbox was snug inside
  the safe. Why that should be few could understand, with three chaps as were
  like as not to go an' plough a meadow 'stead o' mowin' it, or sow a young
  wheatfield twice over with carrots. But so 'twas howsomedever, an' 'tis like
  Jane had her share in keepin' things square.</p>

  <p>"But ugly as she were, and forty as she were, Jane were still the youngest
  o' the family, an' den't forget to publish the fact abroad nayther, without
  goin' into the 'zact arithmetic o' the years. An' she wore a bonnet that made
  the church look like a penny show. An' so at last what nobody expected came
  to pass, an' a man went a-courting to Brewitts'; an' not a blind man,
  nayther.</p>

  <p>"He were so far from blind that folk swore he could see, quite distinct,
  through Brewitts' brick wall and iron safe into the cashbox, afore he made up
  his mind to go a-courtin' to Jane. 'Tis sarten he were more than half her
  age, but none so much more, if you den't count the time he'd been in gaol.
  Bates were his name, an' the poor friendless chap hadn't a soul in arl Essex
  to say a good word for him, consekence of his havin' lived in the county arl
  his life. 'Twasn't that he ever took another man's job away from him, either,
  for if there was one thing in the world he'd never take it was work.</p>

  <p>"The three brothers weren't so absent-minded as to overlook a thing like
  this, an' they pitched Jim Bates out o' doors reg'lar, whenever the sight of
  him reminded 'em. But Jane, she stood up for him through thick an' thin, as
  was natural. The more the folks were down on Bates the better she thought
  him, an' as for him, the more he saw of the Brewitts' house, and the more he
  heard of the cashbox, the deeper in love he got. But Tom and Bob, an' Sam,
  they got so mighty objectionable that Jim Bates had to take to meetin' Jane
  by dark in the lane, which had two advantages: first, the brothers couldn't
  see him; an' second, he couldn't see Jane.</p>

  <p>"Things got desprit. The brothers swore that if she were such a fool as to
  go to church with Jim Bates, she should take what belonged to her an' no
  more; which, put in round numbers, was nothin'. But she was quite game for
  this, an' she told Jim Bates as much, an' openly admitted she was full aged
  an' could do as she liked. But Jim Bates was that thoughtful he wouldn't part
  she an' the cashbox, an' at last he persuaded her that all three should make
  a bolt together in the dogcart. 'Tis like she might have doubted about
  bringing the cashbox; but Jim Bates he told her it was good as hers, seein'
  she'd kep' house for her brothers so long, an', rather than she should be
  done out of her rights, he'd take care of it himself.</p>

  <p>"So they settled to make a bolt of it one night after market-day. Jim
  Bates chose that night for reasons. 'Twas only to be supposed that both
  cashbox and brothers would be fullest after market-day; an' if
  absent-mindedness be to be took advantage of, when was an Essex farmer likely
  to hey more of it than on market-night? So 'twere settled to do so. Jim Bates
  were to come into the yard at midnight an' tip the whistle. Jane were to be
  all ready, an' pitch out o' winder the key o' the stable-door, which she'd
  hey to get from Tom Brewitt's room. This was another thing easier done on
  market-night. Then, while Jim Bates set about harnessin' the mare to the
  dogcart, Jane was to go into Bob's room, get his keys, unlock the safe, and
  bring out the cashbox. That was another thing only safely to be done on
  market-night, an', market-night an' all, poor Jane Brewitt felt mighty
  trembly about doin' it. After that she were to gather up all three pairs o'
  topboots, where the brothers had a-left 'em outside the bedroom
  doors&mdash;for she kep' her brothers up to gentry ways, did Jane&mdash;an'
  pitch 'em away somewheres, to keep Tom, Bob, an' Sam indoors for a bit, in
  case they got roused, an' give the loviers true a good clear start. That was
  Jane's department, an' so much done, she were to mount the dogcart with her
  lovin' Jim <i>and</i> the cashbox, an' live happy ever arter.</p>

  <p>"But there ain't no dependin' on plans with absent-minded men about. Poor
  Jane Brewitt got frightender an' frightender every minute arter her brothers
  had gone to bed, an' she hadn't the pluck to go into Tom's room for the
  stable-key before she heard Jim Bates in the yard. 'Twere a fine moonlight
  night, an' she peeped an' saw him.</p>

  <p>"'Be that you, Jim?' says she, whisperin' out o' winder.</p>

  <p>"'Ay,' says he, whisperin' back. ''Tis arl right. I don't want the
  stable-key.'</p>

  <p>"He said he den't want the stable-key," Dan said, turning to the company;
  "an' I'd bet a piece you won't guess why. Tom Brewitt, so fresh from market
  as he were, had wound his watch an' hung it on the stable-door, an' took the
  padlock up to bed with him; an' now that watch were tickin' away safe in Jim
  Bates's pocket I D'ye cap that, Abel Pennyfather?"</p>

  <p>Abel said not a word, and Dan went on.</p>

  <p>"Well, that looked like good luck, and a watch in extry, for poor Jane,
  but it weren't; you can't make no counts with absent-minders. But there were
  more to come. Jim Bates looked up again, and he said: 'Hey ye been to the
  safe?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' says poor Jane. 'I aren't been; an' I'm ready to faint with fear at
  the thought. I count it be robbery!'</p>

  <p>"'Stay a bit,' says Jim Bates to her. 'What's that black thing I see in
  the rosebush under Bob's winder?'</p>

  <p>"Well, neighbors," Dan went on, turning again to the company at large, "if
  Abel Penny-father told you what I'm goin' to tell you, you mightn't believe
  it; but, seein' I say it myself, there's no question. Bob Brewitt had
  finished <i>his</i> market-day so chock full of absent-mindedness that he'd
  opened the casement instead o' the safe-door, an' shoved the cashbox out o'
  winder! Can ye cap that?</p>

  <p>"Well, now, that looked as if the course o' true love were runnin'
  smoother than ever, den't it? But I tell 'ee again, ye can't make no count
  with absent-minders. The absence o' mind proper to market-night had helped
  the loviers true as regards two brothers, but it ruined an' shipwrecked the
  whole venture in the case o' the third. There was nothin' to do now for Jane,
  but to gather up the boots, an' pelt off for a weddin' licence; but that she
  never did, for something occurred.</p>

  <p>"Jim Bates, when he found hisself out in the yard with the cashbox an' Tom
  Brewitt's watch, began to think things over very sudden. He changed his mind
  about separatin' Jane an' the cashbox, an' he started off to part 'em just as
  far as possible in the longest jumps he could make. An' poor Jane, she
  couldn't go after him because of what occurred in the meantime; an' so she
  lost the only man that ever came a-courtin' to her, an' died an old maid at
  last."</p>

  <p>"What was it as occurred in the meantime?" asked somebody.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well for you to laugh, neighbors," proceeded Dan, ignoring
  the interruption; "but I count 'tis a bitter thing for a poor gal to live her
  life through, young at first an' old at last, an' die, an' never get the
  kindness a woman looks for, and that she sees the others getting. You laugh
  at poor Jane Brewitt with her ugly face, but she's the same under her skin as
  the handsomest gal in Essex. An' that's the same with all of us. Abel
  Penny-father 'ud look quite decent if you skinned him. Well, well!"</p>

  <p>"But you ha'n't told us what occurred that stopped her," protested
  Prentice.</p>

  <p>"Den't I? Well there now It caused a rare fanteeg, though, the hullabaloo
  after Jim Bates. When they all woke up, Tom Brewitt wasted ten minutes tryin'
  to tell the time o' night by the padlock; an' Bob, not quite awake and still
  mixin' up the safe-door an' the casement in his mind, shoved his head into
  the safe an' bawled, 'Stop thief!' till he nigh deaf-an'-dumbed hisself. But
  they caught Jim Bates in the mornin', though, an' he went to Springfield gaol
  once more. Here's better luck to us. 'Tis a dry oad tale."</p>

  <p>Dan reached for Abel Pennyfather's new-filled mug, and Abel, loudly
  protesting, recovered it empty.</p>

  <p>"Your mug? Well there," said Dan, with his hand on the door-knob as he
  rose. "There be nothing so catchin' in the world as that there absence o'
  mind. It'll be Banham's turn next."</p>

  <p>"But what was't occurred to stop Jane Brewitt?" cried everybody, except
  Pennyfather.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that?" Dan answered, turning the doorknob and pulling the door
  conveniently ajar. "Well, you see, she picked up two pairs o' top-boots all
  right, but when she got to Sam's door&mdash;you see he'd come home from
  market as full of absence o' mind as any man could carry, an' you know they
  brew it strong at Rochford. So, natural enough, he tucked up his boots in bed
  an' went asleep outside hisself. So that when his sister came along in the
  dark with two pair o' boots an' fell over him, he jumps up an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the empty mug hit the door as it closed, and it cost Abel Pennyfather
  eighteen pence.</p>

     id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE STOLEN BLENKINSOP</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Tom Browne, R.I.</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Aug 1908</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">IF it had been necessary for Mr. Hector Bushell to make a
  fortune for himself there can be little doubt that he would have done it.
  fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;just as you please&mdash;the necessity did
  not exist, for his father had done it for him before he was born.
  Consequently, Hector, who was a genial if somewhat boisterous young man,
  devoted his talents to the service of his friends, whose happiness he
  insisted on promoting, with their concurrence or without it, by the exercise
  of his knowledge of the world and whatever was in it, his businesslike
  acumen, his exuberant animal spirits, and his overflowing, almost
  pestilential, energy. Quiet-mannered acquaintances who spied him afar dodged
  round corners and ran, rather than have their fortunes made by his
  vigorously-expressed advice, enforced by heavy slaps on the shoulder and
  sudden digs in the ribs, and sometimes punctuated with a hearty punch in the
  chest. For he was a large and strong, as well as a noisy, young man,
  accurately, if vulgarly, described by his acquaintance as perpetually "full
  of beans."</p>

  <p>He had given himself a reputation as an art critic, on the strength of a
  year or two's attendance at an art school in Paris; and, indeed, he
  maintained a studio of his own, expensively furnished, where he received his
  friends and had more than once begun a picture. But his energies in this
  matter were mainly directed to the good of painters among his acquaintances,
  who were under the necessity of living by their work. He told them how their
  pictures should be painted, and how they could certainly be sold. Indeed, in
  this latter respect he did better than advise the painter&mdash;he advised
  the buyer, when he could seize one, and trundled him captive in the studio of
  his nearest friend with great fidelity and enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"The chance of your life, my dear sir!" he would say, snatching at the
  lapel of some wealthy friend's coat, and raising the other hand with an
  imminent threat of a slap on the shoulder. "The chance of your life!
  <i>The</i> coming man, I assure you! Something <i>like</i> an investment. A
  picture they'll offer you thousands for some day, and I do believe I can get
  it for you for a couple of hundred! Come and see it before some dealer gets
  in!"</p>

  <p>It was with some such speech as this that he interrupted Mr. Higby
  Fewston, the margarine magnate, full of the report of the robbery a day
  before of a Gainsborough portrait from a house in Charles Street, Berkeley
  Square. Mr. Fewston was not the sort of man to take a deal of interest in
  pictures for their own sake, but the newspapers estimated the money value of
  the missing picture at twenty thousand pounds, and he found that very
  touching. He had the same respect for that Gainsborough, which he had never
  seen, that he would have had for a cheque for the sum signed by the firm of
  Rothschild; rather more, in fact, for if the cheque were stolen it might be
  stopped, and so rendered valueless; but there was no stopping the
  Gainsborough till you had caught the thief. So that Mr. Fewston found himself
  taking an unwonted interest in art; and when Hector Bushell, seizing the
  opportunity and pulling at his arm, drew him in the direction of Sydney
  Blenkinsop's studio, he offered less resistance than otherwise he might have
  done.</p>

  <p>"Man named Blenkinsop," declaimed the zealous Hector. "Capital chap, and
  paints like&mdash;like a double archangel. His studio's close by&mdash;come
  and look for yourself. Of course, nothing need be said about buying the
  picture, if you don't want to. But just come and see it&mdash;I'll pretend we
  were passing and just dropped in. You'll have the sort of chance that people
  had in Gainsborough's own time. Why, I don't suppose <i>he</i> got more than
  a couple of hundred or so for the very picture the papers are so full of
  to-day!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fewston suffered himself to be dragged through many streets&mdash;the
  studio was not so near as Hector's enthusiasm made it seem&mdash;and finally
  into the presence of Mr. Sydney Blenkinsop, the painter. Blenkinsop was, by
  the side of Bushell, a comparatively quiet young man, not without
  apprehension of the possible consequences of his friend's devotion; for one
  never could tell what wild things Bushell might have been saying about
  one.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Sydney, old boy!" cried that enthusiast. "How have you been all this
  time?" They had last met the day before, when Hector had hauled in some other
  possible patron. "How have you been? Just looked in as we were passing, you
  know&mdash;just looked in! This is my friend, Mr. Higby Fewston, much
  interested in art, and what he don't know about a picture&mdash;well, there!
  Working on anything just now, eh? I say"&mdash;this with a start of
  apprehension&mdash;"you haven't sold that picture yet, have you? The stunner,
  you know, the Keston?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that?" responded Blenkinsop, who had never sold a picture in his
  life. "No, I haven't. Not that one."</p>

  <p>"Ah, plain enough Agnew hasn't been here lately. I'd like to have another
  look at it, old chap; probably sha'n't have another chance, unless it goes
  somewhere where I know the people. Ah, there now; look at that now!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fewston looked at it blankly. "It&mdash;it's a <i>landscape,"</i> he
  said, presently, after consideration. The stolen Gainsborough had been a
  portrait, and Mr. Fcwston liked things up to sample.</p>

  <p>"Rather!" replied Hector. "It <i>is</i> a landscape, as you say, and no
  mistake! Something like a landscape that, eh? I knew you'd like it, of
  course, having an eye for such a thing. Ah, it's a topper!"</p>

  <p>He fell back by the side of the man of margarine, and the two inspected
  the marvel in silence, the one with head aside and a smile of ecstasy, and
  the other with all the expression of a cow puzzled by a painted field with
  nothing to eat on it. Sydney Blenkinsop shuffled uneasily.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Presently Mr. Fewston thought of something to say. "Where was it taken?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Keston Common," murmured Sydney faintly and "Keston Common" repeated
  Hector loudly, making the title sound like a fresh merit. He also drew
  attention to the wonderful effects of light in the picture, the extraordinary
  painting of the sky, the subtle suggestion of atmosphere, and the marvellous
  "values." Mr. Fewston listened patiently to the end. There was another pause
  longer and more awkward than the last; it seemed likely to endure till
  something burst in Sydney Blenkinsop. Then, at last, Mr. Higby Fewston spoke,
  weightily.</p>

  <p>"Keston," he said, with solemn conviction, "is a place I don't like.
  There's a bad train service."</p>

  <p>Such a criticism as this even Hector Bushell could not readily answer. He
  attempted to evade the point and returned again to his "values." But any
  reference to values unsupported by definite figures made little impression on
  the commercial mind of Mr. Fewston, and in a very few minutes more he drifted
  out, with Hector Bushell still in close attendance.</p>

  <p>Hector, however, remained with the margarine Maecenas only long enough to
  discharge another volley of admiration for the picture, and took his leave at
  the first convenient corner. As a consequence he was back in five minutes, to
  discover Sydney Blenkinsop vengefully kicking a lay figure.</p>

  <p>"Don't bring another chap like that to this place," cried the painter
  savagely, "or I'll pitch him out o' window!"</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, don't be an ass! You've got no business instincts. A man
  like that's invaluable, if you can only kid him on. He'll buy any old thing,
  if he buys at all."</p>

  <p>"If!"</p>

  <p>"You're an ungrateful infidel. I tell you I'm going to sell that 'Keston
  Common' for you. What could you do with it by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Put a stick through it&mdash;burn it&mdash;anything! I'm sick of the
  whole business."</p>

  <p>"Just what I expected. You could put a stick through it or burn
  it&mdash;and what's the good of that?"</p>

  <p>"What's the harm? I can't sell it and they won't hang it at the shows; I
  know that before I send it."</p>

  <p>"You know everything that's no use to you, and nothing that pays. You can
  burn a picture, but you can't sell it. Now, I'm going to sell that picture
  for you, if you'll let me. Will you?"</p>

  <p>"You can do what you like with it."</p>

  <p>"Done with you, my boy! I'll make you famous with it, and I'll get you
  money for it. I've an idea such as you couldn't invent in a lifetime. Shut up
  the shop now and we'll talk it over at the Caf Royal. Come along. We'll have
  a little dinner out of the money I'm going to make for you. But you've to
  take orders from me, mind!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE evening papers flamed with the tale of the lost
  Gainsborough, as the morning papers had done before them, and the morning
  papers of the next day kept up the flame with scarcely diminished violence.
  Sydney Blenkinsop rose with nothing but a headache to distinguish him from
  the other unknown people about him, but by lunch-time he was as famous as
  Gainsborough himself. For another picture had been stolen. The evening papers
  came out stronger than ever, giants refreshed by a new sensation, with the
  blinding headline, ANOTHER PICTURE ROBBERY! Sub-headings sang of A DANGEROUS
  GANG AT WORK, and deplored A YOUNG PAINTER'S MISSING MASTERPIECE. Sydney
  Blenkinsop was the young painter, and the view of Keston Common was the
  missing masterpiece. In the eyes of thousands of worthy people Mr. Sydney
  Blenkinsop became an artist second only in importance to Gainsborough, if
  second to anybody; and Mr. Sydney Blenkinsop, himself appalled by the
  overwhelming success of Mr. Hector Bushell's scheme, would have fled the
  country, but for the superior will-power of that same Hector Bushell, who
  never left his side.</p>

  <p>For journalists haunted the studio and "wrote up" the whole business
  afresh for every edition of all the daily newspapers in England. Sydney would
  have bolted the door and fled from the rear, but Hector ordered in caviare
  sandwiches and oyster patties and a case of champagne, and was the life and
  soul of the party. When Sydney seemed at a loss for a judicious
  answer&mdash;which occurred pretty often&mdash;Hector was instantly equal to
  the occasion. The main story was simple enough, and was cunningly left to
  rest entirely on the word of the police. The constable on the beat had
  perceived, in the gray of the morning, that a window of the studio had been
  opened, and a pane broken in the process. Nobody seemed to be in the place,
  so the policeman kept watch by the window till assistance arrived, when it
  was found that obviously a thief had entered the studio, and had got safely
  away. It was not found possible to communicate with Mr. Blenkinsop till the
  morning was well advanced and somebody was found who knew the address of his
  lodgings; and then he was met as he was leaving home for the studio, in
  company with his friend, Mr. Bushell. Things in the studio had been much
  disarranged, and the picture, a view of Keston Common, had been cut from its
  frame and taken.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>So much for the simple facts as observed by the police; but the frills,
  embroideries, tassels, tinsels, and other garnishings, which lent variety and
  interest to the narrative came in an inexhaustible and glorious torrent from
  Hector Bushell. He took each separate journalist aside and gave him the
  special privilege of some wholly new and exclusive information as to the
  surprising genius of Sydney Blenkinsop, and the amazing prices his pictures
  were worth and would certainly fetch, some day. Doubtless the thief was a
  knowing file, and was laying up for the future&mdash;"saving his stake," as
  it were. Any possible slump in Gainsboroughs&mdash;of course, nobody expected
  it, but such a thing might happen&mdash;would be compensated by the certain
  rise in Blenkinsops. And with this astute suggestion Hector shut one eye,
  tapped the side of his nose, and surprised the favored reporter with one of
  his celebrated digs in the ribs.</p>

  <p>The newspapers on their part neglected nothing. Gainsborough and
  Blenkinsop had a column apiece, side by side, in most of them, and in the
  rest they had more, or were fraternally mingled together. "Is no masterpiece
  safe?" asked the Press. And, answering its own question with no more than a
  paragraph's delay, the Press gave its opinion that no masterpiece was. To
  have put in question the new-born eminence of Blenkinsop would have been to
  spoil the boom in the most unbusinesslike way. Of course, a Turner, or a
  Raeburn, or another Gainsborough would have been preferable, but as it was
  the Press had to do its best with the materials to hand, and so it did, to
  the glory of Blenkinsop. The notion of a thief or a gang of thieves going
  about after valuable pictures was too good to waste, and every newspaper
  expressed the sage conjecture that, where one picture was, there would the
  other be found. One scribbling cynic managed to squeeze in a hint that this
  might suggest the valuable clue of lunacy in the culprit; though nobody
  noticed that in the general flood of Blenkinsoppery.</p>

  <p>But in the intervals of interviewing, when the friends had a few minutes
  of private conversation, there was a notable lack of gratitude in Sydney's
  acknowledgments.</p>

  <p>"This is a fine ghastly mess you've Ianded me in!" he protested, at the
  first opportunity. "How do you expect me to look all these people in the
  face?"</p>

  <p>"How? Oh, the usual way&mdash;only the usual way, you know! The more usual
  the better. <i>I</i> don't find any difficulty!"</p>

  <p>"You? No&mdash;you're enjoying it; you've the cheek for anything. I'm the
  sufferer. I've had to stand here and yarn to a police-inspector about the
  beastly business!"</p>

  <p>"Yarn! The simple, plain, clear truth! You dined with me last night at the
  Caf Royal, leaving the studio just as usual. And in the morning you came
  here, also as usual, and found the police in charge. Straightforward enough.
  Of course, he didn't ask you anything about <i>me.</i> It seems to me you've
  got the soft job. I'm doing all the work, and as to enjoying it, of course I
  am! Why aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Enjoying it! Good heavens, man, I never expected such a row as this; I
  was a fool to listen to you."</p>

  <p>"Now, there!" Hector Bushell spread his arms in injured protest. "There's
  ingratitude! I've positively made you the most celebrated painter alive, all
  in the course of a few hours, and you&mdash;you pretend you don't like it!
  Oh, come off it! Why, there are thousands of respectable people in this
  country to-day, who couldn't name six painters who ever lived, that know all
  about you&mdash;and Gainsborough. I fetched the Press round&mdash;did it
  all!"</p>

  <p>"And how's it all going to end? And where <i>is</i> the picture? Why won't
  you tell me that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was afraid somebody might catch on to a sort of idea that you
  knew where it was, and I wanted you to be able to say you didn't, that's all.
  Nobody has had any such unworthy suspicions, and so there's no harm in
  inviting you to admire the dodge. When I got home last night, with the canvas
  rolled up under my arm, I just took it to bed with me till the morning. When
  I woke I thought it over, and I remembered a big roll of old stair-carpet up
  in a garret where nobody went&mdash;a useless old roll that my dear old
  mother has dragged about with us for years&mdash;ever since we lived in
  Russell Square, in fact. It's never been touched since it came, and never
  will be. So I nipped out and up into the garret with the picture, unrolled a
  few yards of the carpet, slipped the canvas in very carefully, painted side
  out, rolled up the carpet again, tied it, and shoved it back among the other
  old lumber. And there it can stay, safe as the Bank, till we want it
  again!"</p>

  <p>"Till we want it again! And when will that be?"</p>

  <p>"When we've sold it. You leave it to me, my bonny boy. Remember that other
  Gainsborough that was stolen&mdash;the 'Duchess.' Would that have fetched
  such a price if it hadn't been stolen and boomed up? Not on your life. I'm
  out to sell that picture for you, and I'm going to do it&mdash;to say nothing
  of immortal glory, which I'm positively shovelling on you where you stand.
  Hark! There's another reporter. Keep up that savage, worried look&mdash;it's
  just the thing for the plundered genius!"</p>

  <p>But this visitor was no reporter. It was, indeed, Mr. Higby Fewston, much
  more alert and affable than yesterday, and eager for news of the picture.</p>

  <p>"Is there any chance of getting it?" he asked, with some eagerness. "Have
  the police got on the track of the thief yet?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

  </div><br>

  <p>"No, they haven't yet," replied Hector Bushell, calmly. "But I should
  think there was a very good chance of getting the picture, ultimately."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll offer a reward?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll have to think it over. It's a bit early as yet."</p>

  <p>"Tell me now," Mr. Fewston pursued, with increasing animation, "can the
  picture be properly repaired? Isn't it cut out of the frame?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that's nothing. It's easily relined and put back."</p>

  <p>"That's satisfactory. And now as to the flowers&mdash;I think I remember
  yellow flowers right in the front of the picture. They <i>are</i> cowslips, I
  hope?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;cowslips, of course," replied Hector, with easy confidence,
  since cowslips seemed to be required. While Sydney Blenkinsop, who had
  spotted in a few touches of yellow in the foreground because it seemed to be
  wanted, and with a vague idea of possible furze-blossoms, or buttercups,
  gasped and wondered.</p>

  <p>"And I suppose more cowslips could be put in, if required, by a competent
  man?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think any more are required," put in Sydney Blenkinsop,
  decidedly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;very likely not&mdash;just an inquiry. I <i>did</i> think at the
  time there seemed to be rather a lot of cowslips for Keston Common, but I do
  a good deal in the 'Cowslip' brand of&mdash;the&mdash;the article I deal in,
  and there might be a possibility of reproducing the work as an advertisement.
  One has to consider all these things, of course; and on the whole I'd like to
  buy that picture, if you get it back. What about price?"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred," said Hector, promptly, before Sydney could open his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"Um, rather high, isn't it?" commented Fewston equably. "I was thinking
  of, say, three hundred."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Hector responded, just as affably. "Yesterday that might have
  done, but just now it's to-day." And he regarded the margarine magnate with a
  long, deliberate, placid wink.</p>

  <p>"Ah well, I understand, of course," replied Fewston, who appeared to far
  better advantage to-day, discussing business, than yesterday,
  misunderstanding art. "Of course, I quite recognize that all this
  publicity&mdash;naturally Mr. Blenkinsop wants all the benefit possible from
  it&mdash;quite legitimate, of course. But there, the picture isn't recovered
  yet. Meantime, I may consider I have the refusal of it contingently, I
  suppose. You see, Mr. Bushell&mdash;you are evidently a man of
  business&mdash;this may be useful to me. A great deal of space is being
  devoted to Mr. Blenkinsop and his picture in the papers, and I&mdash;well, it
  would be worth my while to be in it, as conspicuously as possible. Do you
  perceive?"</p>

  <p>"I think I see. To-morrow morning's papers, for instance: 'We are at
  liberty to state that Mr. Sydney Blenkinsop's now famous picture was destined
  for the galleries of one of the best known of our merchant princes; in fact,
  that in the event of its hoped-for recovery it is to be purchased by Mr.
  Higby Fewston, and will make a conspicuous feature of that gentleman's
  collection.' I think that can go in&mdash;no doubt even a little more."</p>

  <p>"Excellent I Will you do that? And it is understood that if you get the
  picture&mdash;you say there's a very good chance&mdash;I have first
  refusal."</p>

  <p>"At five hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"Three hundred, I think."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't do, really, as things go. Consider what the Gainsborough would
  cost you if you could get that, now that it has been stolen!"</p>

  <p>"Well, well, we'll leave it at <i>four</i> hundred, unless you get a
  higher offer; it's rather absurd discussing this, with the picture lost. But
  I do want to be sure that I get proper publicity in the papers. You'll see to
  that, won't you? You see, this is just the time I want it. I am putting up
  for the County Council, and&mdash;this <i>strictly</i> between
  ourselves&mdash;there is just the possibility that I may be turning my
  business into a limited company. So all these things help, and I and my
  family are keeping ourselves forward as much as possible just now. Mrs.
  Fewston, for instance, is making an appeal for the Stockjobbers' Almhouses,
  and running a sale. And this picture&mdash;well, if it's recovered we shan't
  quarrel about the price so long as you get me well into the papers in the
  meantime. You see, I'm perfectly frank&mdash;we'll do our best for each
  other, mutually."</p>

  <p>And so it was settled between Mr. Fewston and the untiring Bushell, while
  Sydney Blenkinsop hovered uneasily in the background, a superfluous third
  party in the disposal of his own picture; which also seemed to be
  superfluous, so far as its merits were concerned&mdash;or even its present
  possession.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. HIGBY FEWSTON was well satisfied with the next morning's
  newspapers. Hector Bushell saw to it that every office was supplied with
  information of the merits and doings of that patron of fine art, and during
  the day the evening papers interviewed Mr. Fewston himself, to the combined
  glory of Fewston and Blenkinsop. Mr. Fewston expressed strong opinions as to
  the inefficiency of the police, and made occasion to allude to his views on
  the London County Council. Speaking as an art critic Mr. Fewston considered
  Mr. Blenkinsop certainly the greatest painter of the present time; and the
  stolen masterpiece was a great loss to him, personally, the intending
  purchaser. There could be no doubt, in Mr. Fewston's mind, that the same
  clever gang had captured the two great pictures&mdash;evidently educated
  criminals of great artistic judgment. And then came certain notable and
  mysterious hints as to astonishing things that Mr. Fewston might say as to
  the whereabouts of the plunder, if it were judicious&mdash;which at this
  moment, of course, it was not.</p>

  <p>The "boom" went so well that Sydney Blenkinsop himself began to look upon
  his sudden notoriety with a more complacent eye. In another day or two the
  affair had run best part of the ordinary course of a newspaper sensation, the
  Bishop of London had given his opinion on it, and while the Gainsborough
  column shrank considerably, the Blenkinsop column became a mere paragraph at
  its foot. It would seem to be the proper moment for the recovery of the
  picture.</p>

  <p>And now it grew apparent that this was the great difficulty. What had been
  done was easy enough; it had almost done itself&mdash;with the constant help
  of Hector. But to restore the picture&mdash;naturally, unsuspiciously, and
  without putting anybody in gaol&mdash;this was a job that grew more difficult
  the more it was considered. Hector Bushell grew unwontedly thoughtful, and
  Sydney Blenkinsop began to get ungrateful again. He had been dragged up a
  blind alley, he said, and now he wanted to know the way out. Hector smoked a
  great many strong cigars without being able to tell him.</p>

  <p>They parted moodily one night toward the end of the week, and the next day
  Sydney was alone in his studio all the morning. He was growing fidgety and
  irritable, notwithstanding his new-found eminence, and he wondered what kept
  Hector away. Was he going to shirk now that the real pinch was coming? Work
  was impossible, so the partaker in Gainsborough's glory loafed and smoked and
  kicked his furniture, and smoked and loafed again. His lunch was brought him
  from the corner public-house, and he ate what he could of it. Then he took to
  looking out of door, as is the useless impulse of everybody anxiously
  awaiting a visitor. He had done it twice, and was nearing the lobby again
  when the cry of a running newsboy struck his ear. He pulled the door open
  hurriedly, for in the shout he seemed to hear something like the name
  Gainsborough. There came the boy, shouting at each studio door as he passed,
  and waving his papers. Sydney extended his coin and snatched the paper as the
  boy ran past. It was fact; he <i>had</i> heard the name of Gainsborough, for
  the thousandth time that week. The picture had been discovered in the thief's
  lodgings, but the thief had bolted and was still at large. There was not much
  of it under the staring headline, but so much was quite clear. The picture
  was found, but the thief had got away.</p>

  <p>Wasn't there a chance in this? Surely there ought to be. Why didn't Hector
  Bushell come? Surely, if they were prompt enough, some little dodge might be
  built on this combination of circumstances, by which his picture might be
  brought to light again&mdash;this also without the thief. They knew, now,
  where the thief <i>had</i> been, and that he was gone. This was good news.
  Hector could certainly make something of that. Where was he?</p>

  <p>He was at the door in the Iobby, in the studio, even as the thought
  passed. Flushed and rumpled, wild of eye, with dust on his coat and a dint in
  his hat, Hector Bushell dropped into the nearest seat with an inarticulate
  "G'lor!"</p>

  <p>"What's up?" cried Sydney. "The Gainsborough&mdash;do you know? They've
  got it!"</p>

  <p>"Blow the Gainsborough&mdash;where's the Blenkinsop? Sydney, it's a bust
  up!"</p>

  <p>"What is?"</p>

  <p>"The whole festive caboodle! The entire bag of tricks! My mother's been
  and sent the roll of stair-carpet to the jumble sale!"</p>

  <p>"The <i>what?"</i></p>

  <p>"Jumble sale&mdash;Mrs. Fewston's jumble sale; Stockjobbers' Almhouse
  fund!"</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!"&mdash;Sydney leapt for his hat&mdash;"where is it? When
  is it! What&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No go!" interrupted Hector, with a feeble wave of the hand. "No go! It's
  to-day&mdash;I've been there. Blazed off there the moment I knew it. They'd
  sold the carpet to an old woman just before I arrived. Nice girl I know,
  helping at Mrs. Fewston's stall, told me that. Just then up came Mrs. Fewston
  herself, glaring straight over my head as though I was too small and too
  beastly to look at. A dead cut, if ever I saw one! I felt a bit uneasy at
  that. But the nice girl told me the name of the old woman who had the carpet
  and where she lived. So I streaked out after her and caught her two streets
  off; she was shoving her plunder home in a perambulator. I grabbed it with
  both hands and offered to buy it. I was a bit wild and sudden, I expect, and
  the old girl didn't understand; started screaming, and laid into me with an
  umbrella. I wasn't going to wait for a crowd, so I out with the stair-carpet
  and bowled it open all along the pavement. There was no picture in
  it&mdash;nothing! I kicked it the whole length out, all along the street, and
  then pelted round the next corner while the old party was tangled up with the
  other end. Sydney, my boy, Fewston's got that picture now! The carpet was
  sent to the house!"</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"What in the world shall we do? We're in a fine sort of mess!"</p>

  <p>For a time Hector Bushell had no answer: he was considering many things.
  Mrs. Fewston's disdainful cut; the fact that the carpet&mdash;and the
  picture&mdash;had been in Fewston's house since the evening of the day before
  yesterday. Also he wondered why Fewston had made no sign. He had had a full
  day and a half to flare up in, if he had felt that way inclined; but there
  had been no flare. Why? Hector's faculties gradually ranged themselves and he
  began to understand. Could Fewston afford to stultify himself after the
  advertisement he had so eagerly snatched? And there were the interviews in
  the newspapers! And the County Council election! And the limited company! It
  grew plain that Mr. Fewston's interests were not wholly divorced from their
  own, after all.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do?" reiterated Sydney, wildly. "We're in a most hideous
  mess!"</p>

  <p>"Mess?" repeated Hector, straightening his hat and gradually assuming his
  customary placidity. "Mess? Oh, I don't know, after all. I was a bit startled
  at first, but we haven't accused anybody, you know. <i>We're</i> perfectly
  innocent. If you like to authorize me to get in at your studio window to
  fetch a picture, why shouldn't you? And if the police like to jump to
  conclusions&mdash;well, they ought to know better. Lend me a
  clothes-brush."</p>

  <p>"But what about Fewston?"</p>

  <p>"That's why I want the clothes-brush. He's in it pretty deep, one way and
  another, eh? We'll go round and collect that money."</p>

     id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; CAP'EN JOLLYFAX'S GUN</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Metropolian Magazine</i>, Feb 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">THE fame of Cap'en Jollyfax's gun spread wide over Thames
  mouth and the coasts thereabout, in the years before and after the middle of
  the nineteenth century. The gun was no such important thing to look at, being
  a little brass cannon short of a yard long, standing in a neat little circle
  of crushed cockle-shell, with a border of nicely matched flints, by the side
  of Cap'en Jollyfax's white flagstaff, before Cap'en Jollyfax's blue front
  door, on the green ridge that backed the marshes and overlooked the sea. But
  small as Cap'en Jollyfax's gun might be to look at, it was most amazingly
  large to hear; perhaps not so deep and thunderous as loud and angry, with a
  ringing bang that seemed to tear the ear-drums.</p>

  <p>Cap'en Jollyfax fired the gun at midnight on Christmas eve, to start the
  carollers. Again he fired it at midnight between the old year and the new, to
  welcome the year; on the ninth of January, because that was the anniversary
  of Nelson's funeral, and on the twenty-eighth, because that was the date of
  the battle of Aliwal, then a recent victory. He fired it on the Queen's
  birthday, on Waterloo day, Trafalgar day, St. Clement's day&mdash;for Clement
  was the parish saint&mdash;and on the anniversary of the battle of the Nile;
  and on the fifth of November he fired it at intervals all day long, and as
  fast as he could clean and load it after dark. He also fired it on his own
  birthday, on Roboshobery Dove's, Sam Prentice's, old Tom Blyth's, and any
  other casual birthday he might hear of. He fired it in commemoration of every
  victory reported during the Crimean war and the Indian Mutiny, he fired it to
  celebrate all weddings, some christenings, and once when they hanged a man at
  Springfield gaol.</p>

  <p>Cap'en Jollyfax was a retired master mariner of lusty girth and wide and
  brilliant countenance. In the intervals between the discharges of his gun he
  painted his cottage, his flagstaff, his garden fence and gate, and any other
  thing that was his on which paint would stay, except the gun, which he kept
  neatly scoured and polished.</p>

  <p>He painted the flagstaff white, the fence green, and the cottage in
  several colors; and the abiding mystery of Cap'en Jollyfax's establishment
  was what ultimately became of the paint. For a new coat succeeded the last
  very soon after the surface was sufficiently dry, and the consumption of
  paint was vast; and yet the flagstaff never seemed to grow much thicker, nor
  did the fence, as a reasonable person would expect, develop into a continuous
  wall of paint, supported within by a timber skeleton.</p>

  <p>Cap'en Jollyfax was a popular man on the whole, though perhaps more
  particularly so with boys, because of his gun. They would congregate about
  the fence to watch him clean it and load it, and the happiest of all boys was
  the one who chanced to be nearest when it was fired, and whose ears were
  loudest assailed by the rending bang that was so delightful to every boy's
  senses. Boys dreamed at night of some impossible adventure by the issue
  whereof the happy dreamer was accorded the reward of permission to fire
  Cap'en Jollyfax's gun; and one boy at least formed a dark project of hoarding
  pennies, buying powder, escaping by perilous descent from his bedroom window,
  and firing Cap'en Jollyfax's gun lawlessly in the depth of night.</p>

  <p>But if the gun enhanced Cap'en Jollyfax's popularity among the boys, its
  tendency was otherway with the women&mdash;those in particular who lived near
  enough to be startled by its noise. The natural feminine distrust of all guns
  in all circumstances was increased in the case of a brass cannon, which might
  go off at any moment of Cap'en Jollyfax's crowded calendar. And it was
  asserted that Mrs. Billing, the widow, who lived at the hill-foot, exactly
  under Cap'en Jolly-fax's line of fire, had been startled into the destruction
  of three basins and a large dish within one month of many birthdays. Mrs.
  Billing, indeed, as was to be expected from her situation, was the brass
  gun's chief enemy. Consequently, if Cap'en Jollyfax had dragged his gun up
  the aisle of Leigh church and fired it under the pulpit he could scarcely
  have startled the parishioners more than did he rector when he first read the
  banns of marriage between John Jolly-fax, bachelor, and Mary Ann Billing,
  widow, both of that parish.</p>

  <p>Except for the gun there need have been little to startle Leigh, for
  Cap'en Jollyfax was none so old, as retired skippers went thereabout, and
  Mrs. Billing was as neat and pleasant a widow of forty-two as might be found
  in Essex, where the widows have always been admirable. Moreover, she had no
  incumbrance in the way of children.</p>

  <p>But there was no mistaking the fact now, even for the deaf who were not at
  church. For the succeeding fortnight and a day or two over Cap'en Jollyfax
  and Mrs. Billing were visible, day by day and arm-in-arm, from shop to shop,
  in Leigh High Street. The result was no great advance in the retail commerce
  of Leigh&mdash;in fact, none. The household appointments of both Cap'en
  Jollyfax and Mrs. Billing were fairly complete in their humble way; and when
  Mrs. Billing had triumphantly hauled Cap'en Jollyfax into an ironmonger's in
  pursuit of a certain fish-kettle or a particular fender, she was certain
  presently to discover that just such an article embellished Cap'en Jollyfax's
  kitchen, or her own. Nevertheless, she persevered, for a bout of shopping was
  the proper preliminary to any respectable wedding, and must be performed with
  full pomp and circumstance; and if nothing, or very little, was actually
  bought, so much the cheaper. Mrs. Billing was resolved to be baulked of no
  single circumstance of distinction and triumph appertaining to the occasion.
  And Cap'en Jollyfax was mightily relieved to find so much shopping cost so
  little after all; so that he grew gradually more cheerful as the wedding-day
  neared, which is said not to be invariably the case in these
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>The wedding was fixed for the morning of a certain Wednesday, and on the
  evening before the day Mrs. Billing spent some little time in glorious
  authority on Cap'en Jollyfax's premises, superintending the labor of Mrs.
  Packwood, who did charing, and was now employed to make the domestic
  arrangements of the place suit the fancies of its coming mistress. Flushed
  with hours of undisputed command, Mrs. Billing emerged in the little garden,
  whereunto Cap'en Jollyfax had retreated early in the operations; and there
  perceived to-morrow's bridegroom in the act of withdrawing a broomstick from
  the mouth of the brass gun.</p>

  <p>"What ha' you been a-doing to that gun, John?" demanded Mrs. Billing
  rather peremptorily, eyeing the weapon askant.</p>

  <p>"A-givin' her a rub up inside an' out," answered Cap'en Jollyfax placably.
  "An' I've just rammed her with a good big charge ready for to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Why for to-morrow?" Mrs. Billing's voice was a trifle sharper still, and
  she turned a fresh glance of unmistakable dislike on the gun.</p>

  <p>"Why for to-morrow?" Cap'en Jollyfax repeated wonderingly. "Why,
  weddin'-day, o' course. Touch her off when we come home from church."</p>

  <p>"Nothin' o' the sort." She spoke now with a positive snap. "A nasty,
  dangerous, banging thing as frightens people out of their seven senses. I
  won't hey it. Why, 'twere almost more'n I could stand down there at the
  bottom o' the hill, an' hey that thing go off near me I will not, so
  there."</p>

  <p>Cap'en Jollyfax stared blankly. "What!" he jerked out, scarce believing
  his ears, "not fire the gun on the weddin'-day?"</p>

  <p>"No," Mrs. Billing replied emphatically, "nor any other day, neither. Folk
  'ud think you were a little boy, a-playin' with sich toys; an' I can't abear
  to be near the thing."</p>

  <p>The staring wonder faded gradually from Cap'en Jollyfax's face, and a
  certain extra redness succeeded it. "I be goin' to fire my gun on my
  weddin'-day," he said firmly.</p>

  <p>"You ben't nothin' o' the sort," rejoined the widow, no less firmly; "not
  on <i>my</i> weddin'-day. Nayther then nor after, if I'm your wife. Just you
  take the charge out o' that gun."</p>

  <p>Cap'en Jollyfax shook his head, with something like triumph in his eye.
  "Won't come out 'cept you fire it," he said. "That's the only way."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, fire it now&mdash;not now, but as soon as I be gone. fire
  off your gun for the last time to-night, and be done with sich
  foolishness."</p>

  <p>"Ben't nothin' to fire it for to-day," the old sailor returned shortly.
  "This gun's my department, an' I'm goin' to 'tend to it. I'm goin' to put the
  tarpaulin over it now, an' to-morrow, Polly, when we're back from church, I'm
  goin' to fire it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Billing bridled. "You're a-goin' to fire that gun before I go to
  church with 'ee, John Jollyfax, an' not load it agin, nayther."</p>

  <p>"I'm a-goin' to fire this gun when we're back from church, an' afterwards
  when proper."</p>

  <p>"Cap'en John Jollyfax, I ben't goin' to church with 'ee till after that
  gun be fired. So now you know. If you don't fire it to-night you must fire it
  to-morrow before I turn a step toward church. That's <i>my</i> word on
  it."</p>

  <p>"I'm a-goin' to fire my gun when I like," growled Cap'en Jollyfax, dogged
  and sulky.</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied the widow, tossing her head and turning away, "then
  if you want me to wed 'ee, an' <i>when</i> you want me to wed 'ee, you'll
  fire it first. Then, maybe, I'll consider of it. But no wife o' yours I'll be
  till that powder be fired off. An' so good-evenin' to 'ee, Cap'en
  Jollyfax."</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of a period of vast interest and excitement in
  Leigh and its neighborhood. Cap'en Jollyfax's gun remained silent all that
  night, nor was it fired in the morning. What Mrs. Billing's feelings were in
  the matter, whether she sat anxiously listening for the sound of the gun, as
  some averred, or dismissed the whole subject from her mind, as her subsequent
  conversation with Mrs. Peck suggested, are secrets I cannot pretend to have
  penetrated. Cap'en Jollyfax, on his part, consulted deeply in the morning
  with Roboshobery Dove, and evolved a scheme of strategy suited to the
  physical features of the place. As the hour fixed for the wedding drew near,
  Cap'en Jollyfax, in his best blue coat with brass buttons and his very
  shiniest hard glazed hat, approached the churchyard and took his seat, in a
  non-committal sort of way, on the low stone wall that bounded it, with his
  back toward the church. Roboshobery Dove crouched behind a corner of the same
  wall, vastly inconvenienced by his wooden leg, but steadily directing his
  telescope downhill, so that it bore exactly on the door of Mrs. Billing's
  cottage. It was Roboshobery's duty, as lookout man, to report instantly if
  Mrs. Billing were seen emerging from the door with her best bonnet on, in
  which event Cap'en Jollyfax would at once leave the wall and take up his
  position at the church door to receive her. Failing that, Cap'en Jollyfax
  would be spared the ignominy of waiting at the church for a bride who never
  came.</p>

  <p>At intervals Cap'en Jollyfax took his pipe from his mouth and roared:
  "Look-out ahoy!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir!" came the unvarying reply.</p>

  <p>"Hev'ee sighted?"</p>

  <p>"Nothin' but the door!"</p>

  <p>Whereat the watch would resume for ten minutes more.</p>

  <p>It was three-quarters of an hour past the time fixed, when the rector,
  himself never very punctual, came angrily to the church door, surveyed the
  small crowd which had gathered, and became aware of Cap'en Jollyfax's
  strategy.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of this?" he demanded of Mrs. Peck, who, in fact, was
  spying in the interests of the opposite party. "Where's Mrs. Billing?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Billing, sir, she say she'll never think o' comin' till Cap'en
  Jollyfax hey fired the gun."</p>

  <p>The rector stared at Mrs. Peck for fifteen seconds, passed his fingers
  once backward and once forward through his hair, and then without a word
  retired to the vestry.</p>

  <p>Roboshobery Dove maintained his watch, and the little crowd waited
  patiently till the shadow of the dial over the church porch lay well past
  twelve o'clock, and the legal time for a wedding was over. Then Cap'en
  Jollyfax hauled out his silver watch and roared, though Roboshobery Dove was
  scarce a dozen yards off: "Look-out ahoy!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Eight bells!"</p>

  <p>With that Roboshobery Dove hauled out his own watch, banged it, as usual,
  on the socket of his wooden leg, clapped it against his ear, and then held it
  before his eyes. Finally, having restored the watch to his breeches-pocket,
  he shut the telescope, stood erect and rejoined his principal; and the two
  old sailors stumped off solemnly toward Cap'en Jollyfax's cottage.</p>

  <p>All that day Cap'en Jollyfax's gun remained silent, and all the next. The
  day after that was June the first, on which date Cap'en Jollyfax had been
  wont to fire the gun in celebration of Howe's victory. But this time the
  Glorious First went unhonored, and it was perceived that Cap'en Jollyfax was
  mighty stubborn. Monday, the fourth, was Sam Prentice's birthday, but Cap'en
  Jollyfax's gun stood dumb still.</p>

  <p>Leigh had never before listened so eagerly for la bang as it listened now
  for the report that 'should publish the submission of Cap'en Jolly-fax; but
  still the report did not come. People took sides, and bets were made. It was
  observed that Cap'en Jollyfax was grown peevish and morose, that he shunned
  his friends and moped at home.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Billing, on the other hand, went abroad as always, gay and smiling as
  ever. Cap'en Jollyfax might do as he pleased, said Mrs. Billing, but she
  wasn't going to marry him while the charge remained in that gun. If he chose
  to fire it out&mdash;well, she might think over the matter again, but she was
  none so sure of even that, now.</p>

  <p>The days went on, and Cap'en Jollyfax's friends grew concerned for him. He
  was obstinate enough, but brooding, it was plain. Roboshobery Dove, with much
  ingenuity, sought to convince him that by persisting in his determination he
  was defeating himself, since there was now an end of gun-fire altogether.
  Cap'en Jollyfax thought a little over that aspect of the case, but did not
  fire the gun. It was thought, however, that he could scarce hold out much
  longer. He was said to have been seen one afternoon stealthily rubbing over
  the gun and renewing the priming.</p>

  <p>A fortnight went, and with June the eighteenth everybody expected to see
  an end of the business; for in truth Waterloo day would have made the best
  excuse of the year. But for the first time since Cap'en Jollyfax came to the
  cottage Waterloo day passed unsaluted. People wondered and shook their heads;
  surely it couldn't last much longer?</p>

  <p>And indeed it did not. There was another silent day, and then in the dead
  of night of the nineteenth, Leigh was startled once more by the bang of
  Cap'en Jollyfax's gun. Louder and sharper than ever it rang in the still of
  the night, and folk jumped upright in their beds at the shock. Heads pushed
  out from latticed casements in Leigh High Street, and conversation passed
  between opposite gables.</p>

  <p>"Did 'ee hear? 'Twere up at Cap'en Jollyfax's!"</p>

  <p>"Hear? I'd think so! Cap'en Jollyfax hey fired the gun!"</p>

  <p>And so word passed all through Leigh and about on the moment, within house
  and out of window: "Cap'en Jollyfax hey fired the gun! Cap'en Jollyfax hey
  fired the gun!"</p>

  <p>But in fact no sleeper in all Leigh bounced higher in his bed than Cap'en
  Jollyfax himself; and that for good reason, for the gun was almost under his
  bedroom window.</p>

  <p>The gun! It was the gun! Somebody had fired it! Those boys&mdash;those
  rascal boys, rapscallion boys, cheeky boys, plaguey, villainous accursed,
  infernal boys! Cap'en Jollyfax fell into a pair 'of trousers and downstairs
  in one complicated gymnastic, and burst into the garden under the thin light
  of a clouded moon. There stood the gun, uncovered, and there by its side lay
  the tarpaulin&mdash;no, not the tarpaulin, it would seem, but a human figure;
  a woman in a swoon.</p>

  <p>Cap'en Jollyfax turned her over and stared close down into her face.
  "Why!" he cried, "Polly! Polly! What's this?"</p>

  <p>With that her eyes opened. "Be that you, John?" she said. "I den't count
  'twould go off that fearful sudden!"</p>

     id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; SNORKEY TIMMS, HIS MARKS</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Tom Browne, R.I.</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Mar 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">THIS is another tale of Snorkey Timms, the disreputable
  acquaintance of whom I have written in other places. It is now years since I
  saw Snorkey, and I never had the faintest excuse for such an
  acquaintanceship, except that he was an amusing scoundrel and full of
  information that cannot be derived from any person of the smallest
  respectability.</p>

  <p>It was at a time long after Snorkey's adventure with the bags of bricks at
  Liverpool Street, of which I have told elsewhere, after he had told it me in
  a faro-house at Whitechapel; the time, in fact, was when the banker at that
  same faro-table was the envy of Snorkey's soul and his ideal of sublunary
  good fortune. From Snorkey's point of view, indeed, there was reason. Snorkey
  was a mere Cockney picker-up of trifles&mdash;and other things&mdash;that
  were not too carefully watched; Mr. Issy Marks during the day was a wholesale
  merchant with a fancy-goods warehouse in a little turning out of Hounds
  ditch, and in the evening he sat at the receipt of custom at the faro-den,
  the only man at the table who always won. Indeed, he paid the proprietor
  fifteen shillings an hour for the privilege of sitting banker, and made a
  very handsome thing of it on the top of that. Why Snorkey and others like him
  should have persisted in contributing nightly to Mr. Issy Marks' income was
  not a question easily to be resolved by the impartial observer; the language
  wherewith they signalized their regular losses wholly precluded the
  supposition that they did it out of sheer benevolence to Mr. Marks. Yet they
  were far from being fools in the ordinary sense, and, in fact, were rather
  apt to pride themselves on their general knowingness; still they came, stood
  before the eight squares chalked on the table, saw their stakes decrease and
  vanish by a system which plainly and obviously must benefit the banker all
  through and nobody else, went away poor and angry, and came again the next
  night and all the nights after that to lose more money. There was no reason
  in it, but there was the phenomenon, and Mr. Marks did very well out of it,
  as did many another "banker" in many another gambling-house in those
  parts.</p>

  <p>For this, and for the presumed wealth in the fancy-goods business, Mr.
  Issy Marks was regarded with much envy. The business had its place in a
  humpbacked little old house that stood uncomfortably shouldered and squeezed
  between two larger buildings, not so old but quite as dirty, in a rather
  grimy little street that led from Houndsditch to some undiscovered region
  beyond. There were scores of such places thereabout, with huddled little
  thick-framed windows, wherein flashy cheap china ornaments, framed
  oleographs, combs on cards of a dozen, shell covered boxes, brushes, sponges,
  and a hundred such things tumbled loose among cardboard boxes. These
  establishments were the small wholesale concerns which supplied still smaller
  retail shops in the eastern and southern suburbs. There were bigger houses
  among them than Mr. Marks's, and busier; but his had the reputation&mdash;at
  least among his humble admirers&mdash;of carrying a solid trade of the sort
  called "snug."</p>

  <p>Now it was the quaint and interesting custom of Snorkey and all his
  friends of like habits, to inspect very often, and with loving care, the
  premises of prosperous persons who aroused their respect and envy as Mr.
  Marks had done Snorkey's. They counted the windows and speculated on the
  probable interior fastenings of doors. They peeped through keyholes
  unobserved, affectionately patted shutters, and groped inquiringly about
  their iron fastenings. Their kindly interest even extended to the houses
  adjoining, the roofs, ladders, trapdoors, and possible means of
  intercommunication. They have been known to stand in cold streets for hours
  watching the lights on the window-blinds that screened the objects of their
  solicitude, and even the most careless of them never omitted to make
  sympathetic, if unostentatious, inquiries as to the comings and goings of the
  inmates, and the exact positions of their sleeping apartments.</p>

  <p>Snorkey, therefore, was aware that Mr. Issy Marks' warehouse was locked up
  and left to itself at night. He knew also that the back of the place could be
  reached from a paved alley by the scaling of an easy wall; that packing-cases
  littered the back yard; and that any person standing on one or two of the
  largest could reach a window that was not barred. Such things as these were
  always among the first noticed by Snorkey in any house in which he took an
  intelligent interest. And as regards this particular house, observation had
  taught him other things also. For instance, although the stock generally was
  not of a costly description, there was a good deal of cheap, thin, showy
  silver, which would melt down just as well as the same metal in heavier and
  more expensively finished pieces. There was a little safe in the back room on
  the ground floor, and there was all the possibility of a little jewellery. On
  the whole Snorkey decided that he had fallen in love with Mr. Marks'
  warehouse and must take an early opportunity to scrape a closer
  acquaintance.</p>

  <p>The opportunity, in fact, seemed to be occurring every night; so that
  between the moment when Snorkey fully realized the state of his affections
  and the evening on which he seized his opportunity very few hours
  elapsed.</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Marks's habit to bolt and bar his warehouse at seven each
  evening, and bid it and its business farewell till the next morning; for he
  lived at Mile End. On the evening of Snorkey's venture he left as usual, and
  Snorkey, from a convenient entry, saw him go. So much being ascertained, the
  adventurer loitered for an hour amid the society of the Three Tuns, and then
  leisurely took his way to the faro "club."</p>

  <p>This place was reached by way of an innocent-looking door, with a very
  respectable electric bell, at the end of a little court of newly built
  offices and shops. If you were known, the door instantly opened to your ring;
  if you were not, you might ring the battery down without effect. That was
  because the door-keeper sat on a pair of steps within, with his eye near the
  fanlight. Snorkey Timms was no stranger, and with no more delay than sufficed
  for the silent opening and closing of the door, and a careful groping through
  a long passage, he emerged into the light and noise of the gaming-room. Mr.
  Marks was there as usual, with a cigar in his mouth, his hat at the back of
  his head, and his eyes on the cards he was shuffling and dealing on the table
  before him. An eager little crowd was clubbed thickly round the other three
  sides of the table, the rear rank climbing on the backs of the ranks before
  them, every man with his hand thrust out to its fullest reach, following the
  fortunes of his stake where it lay on the chalked diagram, and eager to
  snatch at the winnings that came so sparsely.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Snorkey staked a shilling, partly because he was always ready to gamble,
  and partly because, in view of the possible events of the night, it was not
  "the game" to make himself conspicuous by a change in his usual habit on this
  particular evening. The shilling went into Mr. Marks's heap, followed quickly
  by another, and two more, and some others after that.</p>

  <p>"Banker's 'avin' all the luck again," remarked a friend to Snorkey. "Turns
  up the card with the most agin it every time, an' 'e's halved stakes eight
  times since I come in."</p>

  <p>Snorkey tried a double chance with two shillings, and lost them in
  successive turns.</p>

  <p>"No good&mdash;it's givin' 'im yer money tonight," remarked the friend.
  "There's a chap over here's bin puttin' down half quids an' quids, and never
  savin' a stake. Marks's luck's in tonight."</p>

  <p>As a fact, the banker's luck always is in at faro, but to-night it was
  favoring him so well that even the punters noticed it; and punters at faro
  must either be blind in general to the banker's luck or take it as a matter
  of course. As his loose silver dwindled and Mr. Marks's heap of money rose,
  Snorkey grew the more resolved on his project for the night, and more and
  more persuaded that his claim on the Marks estate was a justifiable and,
  indeed, almost a legal one.</p>

  <p>He stayed about the faro-table till near eleven, and then sauntered
  quietly out. It was scarce more than five minutes' walk to the house by
  Houndsditch, and the street, the warehouse, and the alley behind were all
  quiet and dark. But there was a light in a top window in the house to the
  left of Marks's, and, as Snorkey had the whole night before him for his
  adventure, he waited and took a turn about the streets to kill time.</p>

  <p>When he returned it was nearer twelve than eleven and the lodger in the
  next house was in bed. Snorkey wasted no more time, but hurried into the
  paved alley and scaled the wall.</p>

  <p>Mr. Marks's back yard was an uncomfortable place to traverse by night,
  short as the distance was; for unseen boxes and cases met the shins and
  knuckles of the explorer, and, while the quietest possible progress involved
  some amount of noise, there was always the danger of knocking over something
  with a thunderous clatter.</p>

  <p>Snorkey was cautious and slow, for there was no need to hurry. He reached
  the wall of the house and stood to listen. It was a still night&mdash;too
  still for such an enterprise as Snorkey's; small sounds were very clear. But
  then if every burglar refused to work except in perfect conditions, the whole
  industry would come to a standstill.</p>

  <p>There was no sound to cause uneasiness. There was the tread of a
  policeman, of course, but that was reassuring. It is a pleasant sound in the
  ear of a burglar, audible for an enormous distance, giving him confidence;
  when he cannot hear it he is never sure that the policeman isn't watching
  him. This friendly sound came from Houndsditch harmoniously beating time for
  the now subdued hum of London. The sky was clear and cloudless above, though
  dark; and a few stars looked down on Snorkey's experiment and winked
  encouragingly.</p>

  <p>It is not easy to set one rough packing-case firmly on another, on a dark
  night, without noise; and when you have done it, even with a little noise, it
  is still more difficult to climb on the top case without a great deal more
  noise still, and more than a chance of a clamorous tumble. But these
  difficulties were surmounted, and once the window was reached, that offered
  no difficulties at all. For Snorkey had brought his tools. First, a
  catch-'em-alive-oh paper, doubled inward, so as to go safely in the pocket.
  This, being carefully opened out, was spread over the pane nearest the sash
  fastening and smacked in the middle with the flat hand. The pane was
  abolished, and came away in a hundred fragments, all sticking to the paper,
  and all quiet. Then it needed but the insertion of a hand to open the catch,
  and the window was conquered.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Snorkey climbed in, shut the window quietly, and pulled down the
  blind&mdash;a thing that Mr. Marks had neglected. Then he produced some more
  tools. First, a lantern made of nothing but a little tin box with a stump of
  candle in it, so that light was only thrown where it was needed, and a puff
  would quench it.</p>

  <p>Now when the scrap of candle was lit, the first thing revealed to his
  sight was not at all what Snorkey was looking for. It was, in fact, a heap of
  shavings on the floor&mdash;wet shavings. It was partly under a table which
  was piled above with cardboard boxes, many of them broken. The boxes seemed
  damp, too, and when Snorkey approached to examine them he grew aware of a
  distinct smell of paraffin oil. There was nothing in the boxes, it would
  seem, but more shavings; and paper&mdash;also wet. Snorkey's eyebrows lifted
  and his lips pursed. But he saved the whistle for a future occasion.</p>

  <p>He looked about the room. The walls were lined with shelves and stacked
  with boxes, but there seemed very little in the boxes. Mr. Marks appeared to
  be stocking a deal of straw and dirty paper. Also shavings, again. But there
  was one box of hair-brushes which much interested Snorkey. He knew that Marks
  sold many of these cheap, silver-backed hair-brushes whereof the silver
  covering behind, thin as paper, was stamped into much highly relieved
  ornament, with a view to a spurious massiveness of appearance; and he had
  designed to rip off those silver backs with a jack-knife and roll them up for
  easier transport. Well, here were the very brushes. But the silver backs had
  been ripped off already!</p>

  <p>Snorkey dropped the lid on the box and saved up another whistle. Then he
  went out on the landing (where there were more shavings) and down the narrow
  stairs almost into another heap of shavings at the bottom. He made straight
  for the little safe, pulling from his inner coat pocket as he went the
  "stick," whose Christian name is James or Jemmy.</p>

  <p>It was an elegant little weapon, with a fine chisel end, and he began by
  thrusting that chisel end in the crack of the door near the top. There are
  some of these cheap safes from which you may tear off the outer plate of the
  door in this very elementary way. This, however, did not seem to be one of
  them, for the immediate result was nothing but the breaking of a fragment
  from the point of the "James."</p>

  <p>Snorkey gazed ruefully at the broken point&mdash;for the tool was a
  borrowed one&mdash;and then gave a twist to the cross handle in the middle of
  the door. The safe was unlocked!</p>

  <p>The door swung open and disclosed account-books and nothing else. At the
  bottom were two little drawers, which were certainly locked, but came open
  with bent fronts at the first wrench of the "stick." They were empty.</p>

  <p>Snorkey looked round the room and shook his head despondently. There was a
  perfect wealth of common shell boxes and cheap sponges here, but that was not
  the sort of wealth he had conic for. The room also had its heap of shavings,
  piled against a stack of shell boxes, and a three-gallon can of paraffin oil
  stood near it.</p>

  <p>He entered the shop very quietly, for now he might be heard from the
  street. The stock he disregarded, but tried the till. It contained not so
  much as a button. Clearly this was not the venture Snorkey had looked for. He
  shook his head again and returned to the back room. Then he very deliberately
  pocketed his tools, blew out his candle-light, and sat on the stairs to wait
  for Mr. Marks. For he had seen things that made him expect him.</p>

  <p>It was very quiet, and more than a little dull. But presently the humor of
  the situation so presented itself to Snorkey that the silence was broken by a
  chuckle, which grew into something rather like a snigger. Mr. Marks would
  find an unexpected card had turned up, this deal!</p>

  <p>The church clocks began to strike twelve, some near, some far, and
  presently St. Botolph's, clanging loud and close. In the midst of the strokes
  there was a thump at the front door. Startling for the moment, but only a
  policeman testing the fastenings. His receding tramp was quite clear, now
  that the clocks had ceased to strike.</p>

  <p>Mr. Marks was very slow, and more than once Snorkey was in danger of
  falling asleep. He was listening for the stroke of one, and wondering if he
  might already have missed it by dozing, when at last there came the expected
  click in the lock, and with extraordinary suddenness Marks was in the shop
  with the door closed behind him. Plainly he must have been watching his
  opportunity, and had reached the door and turned the familiar lock swiftly
  and quietly. And in another moment he was groping in the back room, within
  two yards of his visitor.</p>

  <p>Snorkey felt for his matches and his lantern; but as he did so a match was
  struck in the middle of the room, and revealed Marks in the act of lighting a
  lantern of his own. Snorkey waited till the flame was well established and
  the lantern closed, and then said cheerfully: "Ah! good mornin', Mr.
  Marks!"</p>

  <p>With a bounce and a faint yelp Mr. Marks sprang back against a pile of
  boxes, livid and gasping, with a terrified whimper in his throat.</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403411h-images/GreenGinger05-3.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"All right, Mr. Marks! Don't jump! It's only me! Quite a old friend!" And
  Snorkey lifted the lantern and held it by the side of his face, whereon
  flickered something vastly like a grin.</p>

  <p>"Vat d'you&mdash;d'you vant?" gasped Marks, panting with the shock. "Vat
  d'you vant?"</p>

  <p>"Want to give meself up," answered Snorkey crisply.
  "Burglary&mdash;breakin' an' enterin';&mdash;I'm a 'orrid criminal. I broke
  in."</p>

  <p>Marks gulped twice before he got a word out. "You broke in?" he
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"Burglariously busted your back window, an' been waitin' 'ere about an
  hour an' a 'alf to confess. I've repented."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;vat?"</p>

  <p>"I've repented. Anybody would as didn't come for shavings. If I'd wanted
  shavings I'd ha' made a good stroke o' business to-night; shavings or waste
  paper, or paraffin. Not wantin' 'em, I've repented. Lock me up."</p>

  <p>Mr. Marks clapped his hand distractedly to the side of his head. "You
  go&mdash;go avay!" he said.</p>

  <p>Snorkey shook his head, put down the lantern, and sat on the edge of the
  table. "Couldn't think of it," he said. "Couldn't think o' goin' away now,
  after all the wickedness I've committed. My conscience wouldn't stand it. You
  fetch the p'lice an' 'ave me punished proper."</p>

  <p>Mr. Marks looked up and down the room and towards the shop and up the
  stairs, thoughtfully. The shock of surprise was passing, like me; anyhow, it
  seems a bit 'ard this time, to be succeeded by a desperate perplexity. "All
  right," he said at length. "I don't vant to punish you. You can go."</p>

  <p>"No, no," Snorkey replied cordially. "Don't you let your feelin's get
  worked on, Mr. Marks. You dunno what a 'orrid chap I've bin. O' course, I've
  repented now, but that was only 'cos of the shavings. You can't rightly count
  a repentance 'cos of shavings&mdash;not by the proper rules."</p>

  <p>"Go along," answered Marks, with a furtive lowering of voice. "I tell you
  I von't say noddin' about it. Ve understand each other."</p>

  <p>Snorkey shook his head. "I doubt it, Mr. Marks," he sighed. "It ain't easy
  for a gent like you to understand a thorough wrong 'un like me; anyhow, it
  seems a bit 'ard this time. You don't mean to say you forgive me&mdash;goin'
  to take mercy on me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Marks, you're a nobleman. I'm willin' enough. I can be took mercy on,
  on very reasonable terms. My little&mdash;er&mdash;commission, as you might
  say, for bein' forgiven, ought to be about fifty quid, I should say, this
  time."</p>

  <p>"Vat?"</p>

  <p>"Fifty quid, I said. You see, it wants rather a lot o' forgiveness for a
  burglary as wicked as this. The drawers in your safe's all bent anyhow, an'
  your first-floor back window's quite shockin'."</p>

  <p>"You've got a fine cheek," snarled Mr. Marks, by this time much recovered.
  "Vy you expect me to pay anyting? You're lucky not to be took up!"</p>

  <p>"What I said meself!" replied Snorkey. "Fetch the p'lice. Or I'll go an'
  fetch 'em if you like."</p>

  <p>"No, no! But fifty quid's ridic'luth! Besides, I got no money here!"</p>

  <p>"All right; I'll wait here for it till the mornin'. It's warmer 'ere than
  out in the cold unfeelin' streets."</p>

  <p>"No, no! You must go! Now, come, be reathonable, Mr. Thnorkey. I'll see
  you to-morrow an' make it all right. Tholemn vord I vill!"</p>

  <p>Snorkey winked, and shook his head inexorably. "You don't understand the
  wicked feelin's of a 'ardened criminal, Mr. Marks. D'ye know, I'm sunk that
  low I wouldn't take your word for it! I wouldn't! Shockin', ain't it?"</p>

  <p>"But fifty's out o' reathon! It'th abthurd!"</p>

  <p>"Well, beat me down, Mr. Marks. Offer me forty."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;ridic'luth. I've got a quid vid me; p'r'aps thirty bob."</p>

  <p>"Ridic'lous, too, ain't it? Why, I've broke the point of a tool as is
  worth as much as that. And if I 'adn't turned up, the place might 'a' bin
  afire! It might, the dangerous way things like paraffin is left about! It
  might 'a' broke out any minute if it 'adn't bin for me."</p>

  <p>"I'll give ye five quid, come!"</p>

  <p>"Can't be done at the price. My conscience won't allow it; it's a special
  good conscience, is mine! It comes a lot dearer than that."</p>

  <p>"But yen I've got no more, vat can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Just now you 'adn't got no more than thirty bob; now it's growed to five
  quid. If I stop 'ere you'll be a millionaire by the mornin', Mr. Marks,
  Exquire, an' all through me. I'll stop."</p>

  <p>"No, no; be a thport, Mr. Thnorkey, an' give a man a chance. Vat'll you
  take&mdash;reathonable?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you see it's growed a bit more a'ready. I said it would. You'd better
  let me stop, for your own sake. But if you'd really rather not, why, I think
  I can make a better guess at what you've got on you than you can yourself. If
  you've got five quid, an' a bit more, on ye it means you 'aven't took your
  winnin's home from the club yet. You always change the silver afore you come
  away, I know. I guess twenty quid. If there's more&mdash;why, you can keep it
  for your honesty. But that's my charge&mdash;ab-so!"</p>

  <p>Time was going, and as a fact the sum in Mr. Mark's pockets was well above
  his tormentor's estimate. He thought for a moment, looked into Snorkey's eyes
  with a gaze of agonized reproach, turned his back, and counted out the money
  in gold. Then he turned again with a sigh and paid it over.</p>

  <p>"He seemed quite out o' temper payin' over that little bit," Snorkey said,
  long afterward, relating the adventure. "Quite rusty 'e was. 'Adn't got what
  you might call a sense of 'umor, I s'pose. Some people ain't. But I told 'im
  very cheerful to be careful about strikin' matches an' such, with all them
  com&mdash;combustious things about, an' I come away.</p>

  <p>"I come down the street, an' turned into Houndsditch, an' there what
  should I see but a fire-alarm post. You know where it is&mdash;just at the
  corner. Well, you know, I felt a bit nervous about Mr. Marks. It was a
  dangerous kind o' place for anybody to be about in with a light, an' somehow
  I 'ad a 'orrid sort o' presentiment that the 'ouse might catch afire after
  all. You know the way one o' them presentiments gets 'old of you, sometimes.
  Well, this 'ere one 'o mine was that strong that I took my chance with the
  alarm. I smashed the glass, an' I tugged the 'andle till I very near tugged
  it out, an' then I ran 'orne fast, 'cos it was late.</p>

  <p>"An' the most re-markable co-in-cidence about the 'ole thing
  was&mdash;when the fire-engines got round there, there <i>was</i> a fire!
  There was, on my solemn davy! Wasn't it wonderful? An' Mr. Marks got in sich
  a muddle explainin' 'ow the accident 'appened that they gave him two years
  hard!"</p>

     id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE COPPER CHARM</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Lawson Wood</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Sep 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">OF the relics of Cunning Murrell, the wise man of Essex, I
  have seen many, and I own some&mdash;his books of conjuration and geomancy,
  scores of his written horoscopes; and of his actual implements of magic I
  have seen the famous glass by which he, or anybody else, was enabled to see
  through a brick wall. This amazing instrument gained him vast consideration
  and authority among the unlearned of Essex up to and beyond the middle of the
  nineteenth century, but matter-of-fact examination, at a time when Cunning
  Murrell was altogether too dead to prevent it, robbed the wonder of all its
  mystery. For indeed, it was nothing but a simple arrangement of the mirrors
  in a wooden case, such as a schoolboy might make for himself with a little
  patience and the ruins of a shaving-glass. But it served its turn well, and
  it was by this and other such aids that Murrell became, and remained to his
  life's end, something like absolute sovereign of all Essex outside the great
  houses.</p>

  <p>But there was another instrument, or talk of it at least, of far stranger
  purport. There was talk of it still, twenty years and more after its reputed
  possessor was gathered to his fathers and his twenty-one children in Hadleigh
  churchyard. This was said to be nothing less than a strange disc of dull
  copper, by aid whereof Cunning Murrell could distinguish the true man from
  the liar. For the liar might stare at it till his eyes were sore, yet never
  could he see in it anything but its mere material self&mdash;a round plate of
  common dull copper; while it was the peculiar virtue of an honest man's eyes
  to perceive on the dim surface <i>something</i>&mdash;something of which only
  Cunning Murrell had the secret; something which the gazer must declare to him
  as proof and test of his truth. But of what that something was' nobody could
  tell a word; for indeed it would seem that nobody had ever seen it. And yet
  belief in its existence was wide as Essex; though there has been a suspicion
  that the whole report was the invention of that squinting humorist, Dan Fisk.
  For he had a deal to do with the only tale of the charm I know.</p>

  <p>In those days Hadleigh fair occurred once a year, on Midsummer Day.
  Rochford Market was held once a week, on Thursday. On Rochford Market night
  the neighboring roads carried many convivial home-goers by horse, dog-cart
  wagon, and foot; on Hadleigh fair night there was far greater conviviality
  and many more convivials. But when Hadleigh fair fell on the same day as
  Rochford Market (as needs it must in some years) then the resulting jollity
  was as the square of Hadleigh hilarity plus the cube of Rochford revelry,
  involved to the <i>nth</i> power, and a great deal more involved than that,
  too, if you can believe it.</p>

  <p>It was on one of these days of joyous coincidence that Abel Pennyfather
  gave Joe Barstow and Elijah Weeley a lift to Rochford Market in his cart, and
  so made occasion for this appeal to Murrell's talisman.</p>

  <p>Hadleigh fair grew active at seven in the morning; so that there had been
  seven hours of it ere Abel Pennyfather's cart set out at two in the
  afternoon. Seven hours of Hadleigh fair and its overwhelming gooseberry pie!
  For it was the gooseberry pie, crown and symbol of Hadleigh fair, that made
  the anniversary formidable to the human constitution. It was the property of
  this potent confection to cause many with whom it disagreed to fall asleep in
  ditches, and others to penetrate into the wrong houses on all-fours. An
  extraordinary unsteadiness of the legs, widely prevalent on fair day, had
  been distinctly traced to gooseberry pie by many expert victims, and a
  certain waviness of outline in Hadleigh scenery could be attributed to
  nothing else.</p>

  <p>So that after several hours of Hadleigh fair, and a long monotony of
  gooseberry pie, it struck Joe Barstow and Elijah Weeley that a visit to
  Rochford Market would make a welcome change. Abel Pennyfather's cart offered
  the opportunity, and that opportunity, embodied and made visible in the
  tailboard, Joe Barstow seized with both hands; after which, with no
  difficulty beyond the temporary delay caused by Elijah Weeley's mistaken
  attempt to haul himself aboard by Joe's leg, the journey began.</p>

  <p>Of the events of that journey, the "faites and gestes" of Joe and Elijah
  at Rochford Market, who shall tell? Pass rather to the return of Abel
  Pennyfather, light laden and heedless, driving his white mare as of old drove
  the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, pounding the road to Hadleigh in
  the cool of the evening, and destined to make near such a stir at the Castle
  Inn as did his fore-runner at Jezreel. for at that same Castle Inn he
  descended from his perch, dropped the tailboard, and proceeded in due order
  to tug at the two sleeping figures within. With the natural protest of grunts
  and gasps the sleepers presently emerged, and were presented erect to
  society&mdash;in the persons of Reuben Turner and young Sim Cloyse.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" cried Abel Pennyfather, staring aghast. "'Tis witchcraft,
  an' nothin' else! They was Joe Barstow an' 'Lijah Weeley when they got in;
  an' that I'll swear 'pon oath!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Friends gathered to inspect the phenomenon, and agreed that Reuben Turner
  and Sim Cloyse were certainly Reuben and Sim now, whoever they may have been
  earlier in the day. And, although Abel protested with increasing vehemence
  that they were indisputably Joe and Elijah when he put them in the cart at
  Rochford, Reuben and Sim declared, with equal confidence, that they had never
  been anybody but themselves all day. Wherein the neighbors were disposed to
  agree with them, arguing that a man who had been some one else would probably
  be the first to know it and the last to be mistaken about it. But the greater
  the majority against him the more positive Abel Pennyfather grew; and the
  discussion waxed prodigiously for a time, till there arrived Jobson of
  Wickford, very angry, and many miles out of his way home, driving his own
  horse in the shafts of Abel Pennyfather's cart, with Joe Barstow and Elijah
  Weeley in it; neither of them, strictly speaking, awake, after the fatigues
  of the day.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you see they'd putt the 'osses to the wrong carts?" shouted
  Jobson to the amazed Pennyfather. "I've a-been chasing yow arl the way from
  Rochford!"</p>

  <p>"Glory be!" gasped Abel, "an' so they hey! Now that comes o' standin' they
  two carts side by side on sich a troublesome confusin' day. I putt them chaps
  in behind in <i>my</i> cart and I walked round they two carts twice, careful
  and absent-minded as I be, afore I stopped agin my oad white mare. 'Come up,
  oad gal,' says I, an' I took the reins off her an' got up an' druv home
  without another thought."</p>

  <p>"No," retorted Jobson of Wickford, still very angry. "I count a thought
  ain't a treat you often hey. Can't you help with the harness now I hey found
  'ee?"</p>

  <p>But the most of the intelligence present was in a state of suspension, not
  to say paralysis, in face of the novelty of the adventure; soaring, at any
  rate, in regions far from any matter of Jobson's harness. The one or two most
  distinguished for presence of mind were turning their faculties toward the
  rousing and hauling forth of Joe Barstow and Elijah Weeley, when another
  object was perceived in the cart.</p>

  <p>"Why," said one, "here be a gallon jar. Is is yourn, Master Jobson?"</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Jobson, wrenching at a buckle, "'taren't. More mistakes, I
  count&mdash;I've a-been cartin' a wuthless load as don't belong to me."</p>

  <p>"Is't yours, Abel?" pursued the inquirer.</p>

  <p>"No, that it ben't," replied Abel Pennyfather, not yet capable of
  sagacious reflection. It was an answer which he never ceased to regret for
  the rest of his life; for as Joe and Elijah rose, cramped and blinking, Dan
  Fisk, having removed the cork and temporarily substituted his nose, cried
  aloud: "Why, 'tis rum, surely!"</p>

  <p>At the words Joe Barstow and Elijah Weeley were suddenly wide awake,
  ready, prudent, and unanimous. A hand of each fell simultaneously on the jar
  as Dan restored the cork, and the vessel was drawn to a loving embrace
  between them. It was a touching action, and signified to the dullest
  intelligence that the gallon jar was homeless no longer.</p>

  <p>"Thank 'ee, Joe," said Elijah, "I'll take that jar now."</p>

  <p><a id="pic13"
     name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403411h-images/GreenGinger06-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Never mind," replied Joe; "I count I can carry it myself."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't dream of it," protested Elijah, politely. "My house is only
  jist round the corner."</p>

  <p>"I ain't goin' there," retorted Joe, not so politely.</p>

  <p>"No need, me bein' goin' to take it myself."</p>

  <p>"Take what yourself?"</p>

  <p>"My rum."</p>

  <p><i>"Your</i> rum? Oh well, you can take it where you like, any as you've
  got. This here's mine."</p>

  <p>"Yours? Why, Joe Barstow, you ben't awake yet; you're dreaming."</p>

  <p>"I count I'm awake enough to know my own property. You let go."</p>

  <p>"'Taren't likely I'd make a mistake about my own freehold jar o' rum, is
  it, neighbors?" protested Elijah, maintaining his grip. "Joe, you're
  dreaming, I tell 'ee."</p>

  <p>"If I'm a-dreamin'," retorted Joe, doggedly, "then I'm a-dreamin' this
  'ere's my jar, an' the dream's comin' true. An' if a man haven't a right to
  the furnitude of his own dreams, who hey, eh? That's law and logic too, I
  count."</p>

  <p>"If you come to speak of the law," interposed Abel Pennyfather, hoping to
  repair his early error, "the jar bein' found in my cart, an' me that
  absent-minded, I'm none so sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you ain't," interrupted Joe, promptly; "but I am. Elijah an' me both
  know better than that. <i>His</i> mistake's sayin' it's his, an' not knowin'
  where he bought it!"</p>

  <p>"Bought it?" repeated Elijah, plainly a little startled. "Who says I dunno
  where I bought it? I bought it&mdash;I bought it&mdash;"&mdash;he glanced
  widly about him for a moment&mdash;"bought it at the Red Cow."</p>

  <p>"You may have bought a gallon o' rum at the Red Cow. I ain't denyin'
  it&mdash;you look as though you had, I count; but you den't bring it home in
  this here jar. I got this&mdash;got this here&mdash;got it from a
  friend&mdash;off the price of a pig he owed me for."</p>

  <p>And now Dan Fisk interposed, as sportsman and humorist, watchful to allow
  no fun to evaporate unprofitably, and eager to tend, stimulate, and inflame
  it and to improve its flavor. So, with his beaming red face and his
  coruscating squint, he faced each disputant in turn, representing the scandal
  of a public row, and the advantages of a private investigation by friends of
  both parties in the Castle Inn parlor.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Joe and Elijah, with the jar of rum between them and dividing
  them, physically and morally, Abel Pennyfather and Jobson of Wickford, Dan
  Fisk, and several more, turned into the Castle parlor, where Dan Fisk opened
  proceedings by snatching the jar and standing it in the middle of the
  table.</p>

  <p>"There be the article in dispute," he proclaimed, "and here be we all
  a-gathered round it to see fair. Joe Barstow an' 'Lijah Weeley be the
  disputatious claimants, an' to one o' they two 'tis alleged that jar
  belongs."</p>

  <p>"Hem!" coughed Pennyfather, tentatively. "'Twould seem so, at fust sight,
  as you might say; though bein' found in my cart, an' me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Joe Barstow and 'Lijah Weeley be the candidates," proceeded Dan, ignoring
  Abel, "both on 'em havin' bought this here jar o' rum, as they distinctly
  tell us 'emselves, or as distinctly as sarcumstances allow. 'Lijah Weeley, he
  bought it off a red cow, and Joe Barstow, he took it off a friendly pig."</p>

  <p>"Took it off a friend," grunted Joe, doggedly suspicious.</p>

  <p>"The pig were a friend o' Joe's," pursued Dan, "an' as to the red cow, no
  doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said <i>at</i> the Red Cow," interrupted Elijah, sulkily&mdash;"Red Cow
  Inn."</p>

  <p>"O-ho!" exclaimed Dan, turning on him suddenly, "that be't, eh? Red Cow
  Inn? An' where be the Red Cow Inn at Rochford, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Eh? Rochford?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I don't call to mind any Red Cow at Rochford. What Red Cow?"</p>

  <p>Elijah Weeley stared blankly. "Maybe I'm thinkin' o' somewhere else," he
  said, rubbing his ear with his palm. "There's a Red Cow at Burnham,
  surely."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you haven't been near Burnham, to-day, you know. I'm beginning to
  doubt your remembrance o' that rum."</p>

  <p>"'Taren't his, I tell 'ee," growled Joe Barstow. "I took it off a friend
  for a pig."</p>

  <p>"Tell us the friend's name!" cried Dan, pouncing on Joe with a raised
  forefinger. "Out with his name&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"
     name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"

  </div><br>

  <p>Joe stared as blankly as Elijah. "Him?" he said slowly. "Oh&mdash;that
  there chap&mdash;you know; the one as&mdash;well, maybe not him, exactly, so
  to say, but a relation of his. That's the chap."</p>

  <p>"O'course that's the chap&mdash;I've been a-thinkin' o' that chap,
  myself," Dan pursued, with a wider grin. "But what's his name? These here
  genelmen o' the jury are that unfriendly suspicious, they won't swallow the
  pig story wi'out the chap's name. What is it?"</p>

  <p>Joe Barstow stared and sweated in an agony of mental travail. "Bill!" he
  burst out at length.</p>

  <p>"His name's Bill," repeated Dan, solemnly, turning to the company with an
  airy gesture and a bow of the gravest importance. "Joe's friend be the
  celebrated person o' the name o' Bill. A party with sich a name as that
  wouldn't bother to hey another, I suppose, Joe, would he?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said Joe, sulkily. "That jar's mine, howsomdever; I <i>do</i>
  remember that."</p>

  <p>"'Tis a comfort to know it, for a good memory's a great blessin'. Havin'
  that partikler blessin' by you, no doubt you remember the pig's birthday?
  Because 'tis the recollection o' this here honorable jury that your last
  latter o' pigs were all sold to Sam Prentice here in Hadleigh."</p>

  <p>"That jar o' rum's mine, I tell 'ee," repeated Joe, fiercely dogged.</p>

  <p>"An' you aren't no more sartin about the pig than 'Lijah Weeley about the
  cow?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sartin' 'tis my rum," growled Joe. And Elijah Weeley, gathering
  courage, broke in again.</p>

  <p>"Touchin' the Red Cow," he said, "that be a pardonable mistake anybody
  might make, fair day an' all, after a nap. An' now 'tis brought to my mind
  there <i>was</i> a pig in the business, but 'twere a pig <i>I</i> bought at
  Rochford market this very day. An' howsomdever it came about bein' hard to
  explain at sich short notice, 'taren't no mistake when I say, in round
  numbers, that rum's mine."</p>

  <p>"S'posin' that's so," queried Dan, "how would you treat all your friends
  here in regard to that rum?"</p>

  <p>Elijah Weeley glanced at the crowd about him with some uneasiness. "Oh!"
  he said airily, "I'd give a friend a glass, o' course."</p>

  <p>"I'd give all my friends two glasses," ex, claimed Joe, bidding like a
  politician, but with the wildest miscalculation of the jar's capacity.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Elijah. "When I said a glass I was a-puttin' of it
  figuratively, as you might say. I'd do the han'some thing, surely."</p>

  <p>"Then this here trouble's settled," proclaimed Dan Fisk. "Takin' it as the
  jar belongs to either one o' you, and you're both ekally
  horspitable&mdash;well, here's all your mutual friends, an' we've on'y got to
  order in the glasses <i>and</i> the water, an' the dispute passes away
  harmonious along o' the rum."</p>

  <p>The rivals received this amiable proposal with uneasy indignation, and
  joined forces against it instantly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" said Elijah.</p>

  <p>"Not me!" said Joe.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Dan.</p>

  <p>"'Twouldn't be proper," said Elijah.</p>

  <p>"Course not," agreed Joe.</p>

  <p>"If I stood drinks out o' my jar," explained Elijah, "Joe Barstow 'ud go
  an' say it was his treat."</p>

  <p>"An' if I treated my friends out o' my jar," pursued Joe, "'Lijah Weeley
  'ud go arl over Essex a-bragging as he'd stood drinks round&mdash;a thing he
  never did in his life."</p>

  <p>With that the proceedings fell into riotous confusion and a conflict of a
  hundred suggestions, from which in a little while Dan Fisk once more emerged
  triumphant.</p>

  <p>"There's nothin' for it, neighbors," he announced, "but Cunning Murrell.
  Cunning Murrell an' his copper charm'll settle this. Nobody here can tell
  whether Joe or 'Lijah is tellin' truth, least of all Joe and 'Lijah
  'emselves, after such a busy fair-day. We'll take 'em now to look at Master
  Murrell's copper charm, an' see which be the truth-teller."</p>

  <p>The suggestion was received with general favor, except, oddly enough, by
  the claimants themselves, who began, with uneasy alarm and much labor, to
  invent the beginnings of objections and excuses. But they and their
  objections were swept away together by the enthusiasm of the majority,
  who&mdash;feeling by now some proprietary interest in the rum&mdash;were
  quite willing to add the further interest of a performance of Murrell's
  necromancy, at no expense to themselves. Wherefore, the whole company, with
  Dan Fisk and the jar at their head, emerged into the street, now dark, and
  turned into the lane where stood Cunning Murrell's cottage.</p>

  <p>The way was short&mdash;eighty yards, perhaps&mdash;though long enough to
  produce a change in the demeanor of the company, which, starting hilarious,
  tailed out and quieted, and at last halted before Murrell's door in
  respectful silence. For that was the manner of all toward the witch-finder,
  and indeed a large part of the grin had vanished even from Dan Fisk's face as
  he clicked the latch.</p>

  <p>Murrell himself opened the door, and stood, small and gray and severe, on
  the threshold, demanding the meaning of the visit. The little room behind
  him, lighted by a solitary candle and hung thick with bunches of dried herbs,
  was a fitting background&mdash;the most mysterious chamber in the little
  world of South Essex.</p>

  <p>Dan Fisk posed the jar on his knee and explained the dispute, though now
  with something short of his native facetiousness.</p>

  <p>Cunning Murrell heard him through, and then said sharply: "So now you come
  to ask o' my curis arts which o' they men be sayin' truth? With a copper
  charm you hear of?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Master Murrell, sir; as 'tis said, sir."</p>

  <p>The old man gazed for a moment hard and sharp in Dan Fisk's face. Then he
  said: "Come you two in," and turned into the room.</p>

  <p>There was a scuffling of feet, and Murrell turned again. "Not all o' that
  rabble," he said.</p>

  <p>"'Tis Joe Barstow an' Elijah Weeley I want, an' Dan Fisk. Give me that
  jar."</p>

  <p>Joe and Elijah lumbered sheepishly in, each propelled by a hand of Dan.
  Cunning Murrell took something from a drawer in a dark corner, and, without
  looking at it, extended it behind him as he shut the drawer.</p>

  <p>"Take you the charm first, Elijah Weeley," he said. "Take it in your hand
  an' carry it to the light."</p>

  <p>Elijah took a small disc of copper, convex on its brighter side, and held
  it near the candle on the mantelpiece. Murrell stood apart, gazing on the
  floor, with his hand across his forehead.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Look you on the metal very close, Elijah Weeley," he said. "D'ye see
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, aye, yes, Master Murrell, sir," answered Elijah, his face within an
  inch of the object, and his eyes protruding half the distance. "Aye, Master
  Murrell. Stands to reason I can see it&mdash;'tis natural I should."</p>

  <p>"And why natural?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Master Murrell? Why, 'cos 'tis my rum, you see."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that be your reason, eh? Well, an' what is 't you see?"</p>

  <p>"What is 't, Master Murrell, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's a&mdash;a&mdash;what you might call a sort o' peculiar kind o'
  thing, so to say. Very peculiar."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I make no doubt o' that," the old man replied, with ungenial tone.
  "Describe that peculiar thing, Elijah Weeley," he added, still gazing on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"That, sir&mdash;that, Master Murrell, is easier said than done as you
  might say, not meanin' no harm, sir. But stands to reason I can see it,
  Master Murrell, consekens 'o that bein' my rum. That's argyment, now, ain't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, 'tis argyment, but not information. If you can see it, Elijah
  Weeley, tell me what 'tis you see. Is it like a horse, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, as to that, Master Murrell, 'tis most likely you'd be right,
  sir, ben't it?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, it is, Elijah Weeley. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, that bein' so, sir, Master Murrell, sir, you <i>be</i> right
  an' most wonderful scientific, sartin to say, an' now I come to look at it
  'tis most powerful like a boss&mdash;quite wonderful; more like than most
  real hosses, as you might say."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful! Elijah Weeley&mdash;wonderful! Give Joe Barstow the charm. Can
  you see a hoss, Joe Barstow?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, yes, Master Murrell, sartenly," answered that politician eagerly,
  almost before he had snatched the charm. "Two on 'em!" he proceeded bidding
  higher again. "Two on 'em, with saddles!"</p>

  <p>"With saddles?" exclaimed Murrell, raising his eyes and reaching Joe in a
  stride. <i>"Saddles?</i> What's this you're looking at, Joe Barstow?"</p>

  <p>"Lookin' at? Why, the charm, Master Murrell, sir! The charm!"</p>

  <p>"The charm? That? Why, 'tis the lid o' my darter's copper kettle, put by
  for a new rim an' handle! I must ha' took it by mistake. An' you saw hosses
  in it! Two hosses with saddles! 'Twould seem to me this here kettle lid be as
  good a charm as any with the likes o' you, Joe Barstow an' Elijah Weeley. It
  tell plain enough that you be liars both! An' 'tis a kettle-lid! Hosses and
  saddles. Oh, 'tis shameful to reflect on the depravity of the age! To think
  that two grown men should walk about the face of this earth with lies that
  any kettle-lid can contradict!"</p>

  <p>Terrible in his righteous wrath, the old man shook his head in the cowed
  faces of Joe and Elijah, seized the jar of rum, pushed it into a cupboard,
  and locked the door on it.</p>

  <p>"After what I've larned of you, I misdoubt much how you came by that jar,"
  he said, "an' 'twould be abettin' your wickedness to let it out o' my charge;
  an' so I do my duty, in face o' the wickedness o' these times. Take them two
  out with you, Dan Fisk; I want no such characters as them in my house!"</p>

  <p>This was certainly the last occasion on which anybody had the temerity to
  inquire for the copper charm. And it was months ere the jar was seen again;
  when it was observed to be a jar of rum no longer; for Cunning Murrell was
  using it to carry horse medicine, a thing in which he drove a thriving
  trade.</p>

  <h3>Illustrated by J. A. Shepherd</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Jan 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">BILL WRAGG, dealer in dogs, birds, and guinea-pigs, began
  business in the parrot line, with a capital of nothing and no parrots. The
  old rascal hinted so much when I got from him the tale of his champion
  terrier, Rhymer the Second, which you may read elsewhere. But I observed for
  long a certain reluctance to talk with any particularity of this affair of
  parrot-dealing. From this I judged that it must have been a transaction of
  uncommon&mdash;well, say acumen&mdash;even for Bill Wragg; and so I found it,
  when at last he made his confession.</p>

  <p>"Beginnin' business without capital," said Bill Wragg, wiping his pipe
  with a red-spotted handkerchief, "is all a matter o' credit, o' course. Lots
  o' people begin on credit, an' do very well; an' different people get their
  credit different ways. I begun on credit, an' I got my credit from perfick
  strangers, quite easy.</p>

  <p>"I was frightful 'ard up, just then&mdash;stony-broke, in fact. I'd been
  lookin' out for odd jobs 'ere an' there, an' gettin' precious few of 'em.
  Last job I'd had was down Wappin' way, givin' a hand at a foreign animal
  shop, where the reg'lar chap was away ill. The guv'nor, he give me a suit o'
  clothes to begin with, 'cause he said mine 'ud disgrace the shop, an' so they
  would. The new clothes wasn't new altogether&mdash;a sailor-bloke had died in
  'em a fortnight afore, at a crimp's; but they was all right, an' I took it
  mighty generous o' the guv'nor, till the end o' the week, an' then 'e stopped
  'em out o' my wages. Well, I'd been gone away from that job a long time, an'
  there didn't seem another job to be had; so, bein' stony-broke, as I just
  said, I thought I might as well set up for myself.</p>

  <p>"It was the clothes that give me the idea to begin with&mdash;them bein'
  of a seafarin' sort; just the sort o' things a man might wear as was bringin'
  'orne a parrot. An' what put the idea into movin' shape was me passin' a
  little coal-office&mdash;one o' them little shanties where a clerk sits all
  day to take orders. I knew that place, consequence of a friend o' mine 'avin'
  done a little business there about a dawg with the clerk; it was a careless
  bit o' business as might ha' got my friend in trouble, if the clerk 'adn't
  gone an' died almost at once. Well, this clerk's name was Dobbs, an'
  rememberin' that, I thought I see my way to raisin' a bit o' credit.</p>

  <p>"I just went into the office all gay an' friendly, an' 'Good arternoon,' I
  says to the noo clerk. 'Good arternoon. Is Mr. Dobbs in?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' says he, 'Mr. Dobbs is dead. Been dead six months.'</p>

  <p>"'<i>Dead</i>?' says I. 'What? Dead? My dear ol' pal Dobbs? No, it can't
  be true,' I says.</p>

  <p>"'It is true,' says the chap. 'Anyway, I see the funeral, an' I've got his
  job.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, now,' I says, 'whoever'd a' believed it? Poor ol' Dobbs! When I
  went on my last voyage I left him as well an 'arty as ever I see anybody!
  This is a awful shock for me,' I says.</p>

  <p>"The clerk was rather a dull-lookin' sort o' chap, with giglamps, an' he
  just nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"'Quite a awful shock,' I says. 'Why, I brought 'orne a parrot for 'im! A
  lovely parrot&mdash;talks like a&mdash;like a angel, an' whistles an toon you
  like. I come here to sec him about it! It's a awful shock.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' says Giglamps, 'it was rather sudden.'</p>

  <p>"'Sudden ain't the word,' I says; 'it's positive catastrophageous. An'
  what am I to do with that beautiful parrot? I can't take it away with me; the
  new skipper wouldn't stand it&mdash;'e's a terror. Besides I couldn't bear to
  be reminded of poor ol' Dobbs every time I see 'is lovely ploomage or 'card
  'im talk&mdash;talks just like Dan Leno, does that bird. What am I to do with
  it? I'm a lonely sort o' chap, an' haven't got a soul in the world to give it
  to, now poor old Dobbs is gone. If I only knowed a nice kind 'orne for it,
  I'd&mdash;but hold on,' I says, all of a sudden, 'how about you? Will you
  have it? Eh? I don't believe <i>you'd</i> treat such a 'andsome bird unkind,
  would you? I'll give 'im to <i>you,</i> an' welcome, if you'll take care of
  'im. 'E's a valuable bird, too, but o' course, I don't want to make money out
  of 'im. Come, you shall have him!'</p>

  <p>"I could see old Giglamps was gettin' interested, thinkin' he was in for a
  'andsome present. 'Hem!' he says, 'it's very kind of you, an' of course I'll
  have the bird with pleasure, an' take every care of him; very kind of you
  indeed, I'm sure it is.'</p>

  <p>"'That's all right,' I says, 'it's nothing to me, so long as pore Peter
  gets a good 'orne. Peter's his name,' I says. 'I'll go an' fetch him along
  'ere. Got a cage?'</p>

  <p>"'Why, no,' says he, 'I ain't got a cage.'</p>

  <p>"'Must 'ave a cage,' says I. 'The one he's in now don't belong to me. Must
  'ave a cage. What are you going to do about it?'</p>

  <p>"'I dunno,' says Giglamps, lookin' 'elpless.</p>

  <p>"'A good parrot cage comes a bit dear, to buy new,' I says. 'But there's a
  fine secondhand one you might get cheap just over in Walworth. I'll mind the
  office while you go.'</p>

  <p>"'No,' he says, 'I can't leave the place.' Of course, I knowed that well
  enough&mdash;it was part o' the game. 'I can't leave the place,' says he. 'I
  s'pose <i>you</i> couldn't see about it?'</p>

  <p>"Well,' says I, thoughtful like, 'I'm a bit busy, but p'raps I might. It's
  a fine cage, an' worth a price; but, properly managed, I might try and get it
  for five bob, though I expect it'll be more. Anyhow,' I says, 'give me the
  five bob, an' if I have to pay any more I'll trust you for it till I come
  back.'</p>

  <p>"So I just puts out my hand casual, and in drops the five bob. So I went
  out that much to the good in credit."</p>

  <p>Here I fear I exhibited something positively like a grin. "Credit or
  cash?" I queried.</p>

  <p>"Credit, I said, sir," Bill replied, virtuously. "Cash an' credit's the
  same thing with a man o' business like me. I went out with that five bob, an'
  I put in threepence of it for a small drink that I wanted very bad arter
  bein' without so long. I had my drink, an' I thought things over, an' I made
  up my mind that ten bob was just twice as useful as five to start business
  with, and there was just such another office of the same coal company only a
  penny tram ride off, that might be good for another crown. So I took that
  penny tram ride, and found the other office. It was a much smarter, brisker
  lookin' chap at this place, I found; but I went at him the same
  way&mdash;askin' for Dobbs.</p>

  <p>"'Dobbs?' says the new chap. 'No; he used to be up at the next office
  along the road there, but he's dead now.'</p>

  <p>"'<i>Dead</i>?' says I. 'What, my old pal Dobbs?' And I did it all over
  again for the new chap. I think the trouble was worth the money and more, but
  a man mustn't be afraid o' work when he's beginnin' business with no capital.
  So I did it all again very careful, an' when I came to off erin' him the
  parrot he was ready enough.</p>

  <p>"'Why, rather,' he says, 'I'll have him. I'm very fond o' birds. A
  parrot's just what I want.'</p>

  <p>"'All right,' says I, 'you shall have him an' welcome. I'll fetch him
  along here.' So I starts round to go, and pitches back the old question from
  the door. 'Got a cage?' says I.</p>

  <p>"This time I got a bit of a surprise. 'Cage?' says he; 'oh, yes&mdash;I've
  got a cage&mdash;got a stunner that belonged to my aunt. A parrot's just what
  I wanted to put in it. Here it is.'</p>

  <p>"An' he went into the little cubby-hole at the back an' dragged out a
  fust-rate brass cage as good as new. It wasn't what I'd expected, a
  coincidence like that, but it don't do to be took aback at little changes o'
  luck. 'All right,' says I, 'that'll do.' An' I laid 'old o' the cage an'
  slung out with it.</p>

  <p>"Some chaps mightn't have the presence o' mind for that, havin' only the
  five bob in their minds, but a man o' business is got to be ekal to anything
  as comes along, an' this 'ere cage was worth a sight more'n the five bob,
  anyhow. So there I was, a business man at large, with the rest o' five bob
  an' a fust-class brass parrot-cage, on credit, to begin business with.</p>

  <p>"Well, the best parrot-cage in the world ain't complete without a parrot,
  so I see very well that the next move ought to be towards a bird o' that
  specie. I brought to mind a very nice one I'd often seen in a quiet road not
  very many streets away, one as belonged to a nice old lady, in a very nice
  'ouse with a garden round it. I'd seen that parrot stood outside for an
  airin' o' fine afternoons, an' I hurried up now to get there before it was
  took in. You see the old gal hadn't got anything like so fine a cage as this
  brass one, an' I'd an idea her parrot an' my cage 'ud go together well. But
  it all depended, you see, on the old lady bein' in sight or not, whether my
  cage went outside 'er parrot&mdash;at a price&mdash;or 'er parrot went inside
  my cage, for nothin'. There'd be more business in the last arrangement, o'
  course, but you have to take the best you can get in these 'ard times.</p>

  <p>"I hurried up, an' when I came to the place I see the parrot there all
  right, standin' outside on a garden chair. I just strolled in an' up the
  gravel path swinging the brass cage on my finger an' lookin' round for the
  old lady. I couldn't see her nor anybody else, so I went up to the parrot an'
  had a look at him. He was a fine 'andsome bird, an' the cage he had wasn't
  good enough for him, by a lot. It was just an ornery sort o' iron wire cage,
  half wore out, an' the fastenin' was pretty nigh droppin' off with rust. It
  was plain enough it was my cage that bird ought to be in, not a wore-out old
  thing like the one he'd got. I had a look round to make sure nobody was
  about, an' then I took 'old o' that rusty old catch an' it came open afore I
  could ha' winked."</p>

  <p>"Surprising!" I interjected. "And then I suppose the parrot flew straight
  into the brass cage?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," Bill Wragg answered calmly, "you're s'posin' wrong. That
  wouldn't be a likely thing for it to do. I might ha' made it a bit more
  likely by shovin' the open door o' one cage agin the other, but that would
  ha' looked suspicious, an' I wasn't <i>quite</i> sure that somebody mightn't
  be a-peepin' from somewhere. Why, they might ha' thought I wanted to steal
  the bird! You'd scarcely believe 'ow suspicious people are. As it was, you
  see, it was nothin' but a accident as might have occurred to anybody. I was
  just bringing in a nice cage to sell, an' havin' a look at the old 'un while
  I was lookin' about for the lady."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," I said, very solemnly. "Of course."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you'd hardly believe it, but that parrot no sooner found the
  door open than he flew out. Nothin' to do with me, o' course, but he did fly
  out, an' quite properly I went arter him. I'd been the cause o' the accident,
  you see, in a sort of indireck way, so I thought I ought to do what I could
  to catch the bird&mdash;only fair an' proper. He flew out over the railings
  an' down the road, an' I went out the gate an' trotted down the road after
  him. He 'lighted fust on a tree at the corner, so I let fly a stone an'
  started him off a' that, an' away he went down the side street an' along
  another turnin'.</p>

  <p>"After that it was plain sailin'&mdash;all but the actual ketchin' of 'im.
  You can pretty easy keep a parrot in sight&mdash;he takes a rest somewhere
  every fifty yards or so. Nobody hadn't noticed in the quiet streets, but as
  soon as we got out a bit into the traffic the crowd got bigger every second,
  all huntin' the parrot, an' all ready to give 'im to me as soon as he was
  caught. 'Cause why? I dunno. I was just a-runnin' after him with a open cage
  in my hand, that's all. I never said he was my parrot. But everybody else
  kep' sayin' he was, an' it's a waste o' time to start contradictin' a crowd.
  So I kep' well up in the mob, an' kep' a lookout in case the old lady should
  turn up, or one o' them coal-office clerks. The crowd kep' gettin' bigger an'
  bigger, an' I got to be sich a celebrated an' conspickuous character I began
  to feel a bit uncomfortable about it. You wouldn't think there was such a lot
  o' fools about, ready to come crowdin' up an' shoutin' an' rousin' up the
  parish, just because of a parrot gettin' loose. O' course, I expected there'd
  be a bit of a crowd, but I hadn't looked for quite sich a row as this, an' I
  didn't want it, neither. 'There 'e is&mdash;that's 'im!' they was a-sayin'.
  'That sea-farin' lookin' bloke with the empty cage; 'e's lost 'is parrot.'
  Celebrity an' fame's all very well in its place, but a man o' business;
  settin' up for 'isself on credit, like me, don't want too much of it at once.
  An' the roust of it was, that there redikulus parrot was a-workin' 'is way
  nearer an' nearer the main road, with the tram-lines on it an' them
  coal-offices one at each end, an' the 'ole neighborhood turnin' out as we
  went along.</p>

  <p>"But nothin' lasts for ever, an' in the end he 'lighted on the sill of a
  attic winder at a corner 'ouse o' the main road, an' a slavey that was in the
  attic, she claps a towel over him an' stands there screamin' at the winder
  for fear he might peck through the towel.</p>

  <p>"'All right, miss,' I sings out; ''old tight! He won't bite! I'm
  a-comin'.'</p>

  <p>"So they lets me in the front door, civil as butter, an' I goes up to the
  attic, an' in about half a quarter of a minute pretty Polly was inside the
  brass cage, as 'andsome an' suitable as you please. I told the slavey she was
  the smartest an' prettiest gal I'd seen since fust I went a-sailin' on the
  stormy ocean, an' 'ow I wished I was a bit younger an' 'andsomer myself, for
  'er sake, so it didn't cost me nothin'; which was a bit o' luck, for I'd been
  countin' on havin' to fork out a bob to somebody for collarin' that bird.</p>

  <p>"Well, the crowd began to melt a bit when I came out, the excitement bein'
  over, but I didn't like the look o' things much, so I made up my mind I'd get
  the job over as soon as I could. I didn't know when the old lady might turn
  up, an' though o' course I was only tryin' to ketch her parrot for her, what
  had got out accidental, things might 'a' looked suspicious. Not but what, o'
  course, anybody could see that if I'd been a thief I'd 'a' walked off with
  the bird an' cage an' all to begin with. A proper man o' business allus
  arranges things like that, for fear of accidents. Men o' business as ain't
  clever enough to manage it is nothin' but dishonest persons, an' liable to be
  took up.</p>

  <p>"There was a fine big pub across the road, at a corner a little farther
  down&mdash;sich a fine pub that it was an hotel, with a proper hotel entrance
  at one side, with plants in tubs an' red carpets. It looked a sort o' place
  that could afford a price, so I went in&mdash;not the hotel entrance, but
  just the other side, where there was a choice of three or four bar
  compartments. I went in the private bar, an' got on to the landlord straight
  away as soon as I'd ordered a drink.</p>

  <p>"'I wanted that drink,' I says, 'arter the chase I've 'ad for this parrot.
  Not but what he ain't worth it&mdash;I don't b'lieve you could match a parrot
  like that, not in the Z'logical Gardens: I meant him for my dear of pal Dobbs
  at the coal office along the road, as you might ha' known afore he died. When
  I 'eard the sad news, I thought I'd take 'im up to Leaden'all Market an' sell
  'im; 'e's worth ten quid of anybody's money, is that bird, an' the cage 'ud
  be cheap at a couple. But I managed to let him loose&mdash;my fault, through
  fiddlin' with the catch o' the cage door. An' 'e's led me such a dance it'll
  be too late for me to git up to the market now.'</p>

  <p>"The parrot had been a-straightenin' of his feathers out an' makin'
  himself tidy arter the scramble an' just at this very moment he gives a sort
  o' little grumble to himself an' then raps out 'Pretty Poll! Hullo! Shut
  up!'</p>

  <p>"'Hear him talk!' I says. 'He'll go on like that all day an' say anything
  you please. What an ornament he'd be to this 'andsome bar o' yours! People'd
  come a-purpose to see him. Come,' I says, 'You shall have him for five pound,
  cage an' all! How's that?' says I.</p>

  <p><a id="pic21"
     name="pic21"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Well, the landlord seemed quite on to buy him, though o' course he
  wouldn't do it without a haggle&mdash;'twasn't likely. But arter a bit we
  settled it at three quid, an' he handed over the jemmies. An' cheap it was,
  too. So he stood the cage up on the top o' where a partition joined the
  bar-screen, where everybody could see him, an' said he'd have a proper shelf
  made for him to-morrow. I didn't hang about much arter that, you may guess.
  But as soon as I got into the street, who should I see but the clerk from the
  coal office, the one that had sprung the five bob, talking to a chap as was
  pointin' to the pub. Of course, the first thing I thought of was a bolt, but
  afore I could make up my mind he caught sight o' me. So up I went as bold as
  brass.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo,' says I, 'that there parrot o' yours is led me a pretty dance.
  Got out o' the cage an' kep' me all the afternoon chasin' him.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' says old Giglamps, 'I wondered where you'd got to, but when I shut
  the office I heard about a parrot bein' lose, an' that man told me you'd
  brought it in here.'</p>

  <p>"'Quite right,' says I, 'an' so I did. Come in yourself, an' sec it. But
  the cage ain't settled for yet,' I says, 'an' it'll cost you five bob more at
  least; though the chap's askin' even more'n that.'</p>

  <p>"So I led him into the compartment on one side o' the partition, an'
  showed him the bird in the cage.</p>

  <p>"'What are you goin' to stand?' says I. 'You can see what sort of a cage
  it is&mdash;two quid's nearer its real price than ten bob.'</p>

  <p>"Old Giglamps calls for whisky an' soda for two, an' says 'Pretty Polly'
  to the bird, same as what any customer might do, an' then he hands me over
  another five bob.</p>

  <p>"'I think he'll take ten bob,' says I, 'an' I'll just run round an' see if
  you'll wait here.'</p>

  <p>"I was in an extra hurry, you see, for very good reason. He was sittin'
  down, but I was standin' up an' keepin' a weather eye on the street outside;
  an' there who should I see, starin' up at the pub front, but the clerk from
  the <i>other</i> coal office! What ho, thinks I, this tale o' the parrot
  hunt's got about an' things is warmin' up! So I skips out quick, an' ketches
  the chap by the arm.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo!' says he, 'what about that parrot?'</p>

  <p>"'Ain't you heard?' says I. 'He got out o' the cage an' led me no end of a
  dance. But he's all right,' I says, an' I led the chap off to another
  compartment away from his pal.</p>

  <p>"'I did hear about it,' says he, 'an' that's why I came here. I began to
  wonder where you'd got to.'</p>

  <p>"'All right,' says I, 'he's safe enough&mdash;I left him in charge of the
  landlord, an' I was a-comin' along arter you, 'cos I wanted to tell you
  something private. The fact is,' I says, whisperin' in his ear, 'the
  landlord's took a great fancy to that parrot. He's fair mad on it. O' course,
  the parrot's yours, an' you can sell it or not, just as you please. But if
  you <i>do</i> sell it, don't take less than ten pound, an' if you get ten
  pound&mdash;well, I think I ought to have a quid or two out of it, oughtn't
  I, seein' as I give you the bird? That's fair, ain't it says I.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' says he, 'that's all right. If I get a tenner for it, I'll see you
  afterwards.'</p>

  <p>"'All right,' says I. 'You come in an' sit down, an' don't say nothing
  about it. You mustn't seem anxious to sell. I told the landlord I was goin'
  to see the owner an' I'll go round the back way an' talk him confidential
  into givin' a good price. You lie low till I give you the tip.'</p>

  <p>"So he goes in an' sees his cage there all safe with the parrot in it, an'
  he orders his drink an' sits down quiet. I thought o' rushin' round into the
  private bar an' tellin' the landlord he was a chap comin' to offer a price
  for the bird, just to mix things up a bit while I got away. But when I got
  outside there was another surprise, s'elp me. It was just gettin' dusk, and
  there was the poor old lady as had lost her parrot, with a handkerchief over
  her head an' the cage in'er'and, comin' down the road disconsolate, lookin'
  up at the houses after her bird!</p>

  <p>"When you've got a run o' luck, follow it up. That's my motto. It was a
  bit of a risk, but I skipped across the road an' said: 'Beg pardon, mum, but
  was you a lookin' for a parrot?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, yes,' she says. 'Have you seen it? If you'll only help me find my
  poor bird, I'll be <i>so</i> grateful! I didn't know he'd got out till I went
  to bring the cage in. Several people told me he'd come along this road an'
  been caught,' says she. 'Is that true? Do you know who's got him?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes mum,' says I, 'I can put you on the track at once. Your parrot's in
  that public 'ouse opposite, havin' been took there by the man as caught it.
  I'll see about it for you, mum,' I says. 'You come across an' sit down in the
  hotel entrance, mum. It's quite respectable there, mum. The man what's got it
  is a low sort o' chap, mum&mdash;a coalheaver, name o' Dobbs, a-sittin' in
  the jug department. You can see your bird from the hotel entrance, mum, stood
  up on a partition. O' course, a rough feller like that Dobbs wouldn't be
  allowed in the hotel entrance an' a lady like you couldn't go into the jug
  department. <i>I'll</i> see about it. I expect he'll cut up rough an' want to
  claim the bird, mum, but <i>I'll</i> see you get your rights, mum!'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, thank you,' says the old gal, 'I <i>shall</i> be so grateful if you
  will. I've been <i>so</i> distressed at the idea of losin' my dear Polly! If
  you will get him back, I'll be <i>most</i> grateful. Of course, I'll pay a
  reward.'</p>

  <p>"Jesso, mum,' I says, 'jesso. But not more'n half a sovereign. I'll see
  you ain't swindled, mum,' I says. 'That chap Dobbs 'ud be extortionate, but
  not a farden more'n half a sovereign, mum,' says I, 'if you'll allow me to
  advise you. <i>I'll</i> see to it for you, mum. You just sit down in the
  hotel entrance, mum, an' give me the half-sovereign, an' I'll talk to him
  firm&mdash;firm. It's the only way, with these low characters. I'll talk to
  him firm, an' mention the p'lice. <i>I'll</i> see about it for you, mum!'</p>

  <p>"So I sits the old gal down with her birdcage on the settee in the hotel
  entrance, takes her half-quid, an'&mdash;well, I left 'er there an' hooked it
  round the first turnin' an' travelled straight ahead, fast, for the next
  half-hour.</p>

  <p>"That made near four quid altogether, raised on credit. In my business a
  chap as can't start very well on four quid ain't fit to start at all, sir. I
  done very well, startin' on credit, like I'm tellin' you."</p>

  <p>"And you've never net any of your creditors since?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir I ain't. My business don't seem to take me that way. It's just a
  book debt, you see&mdash;just a book debt. <i>They</i> can't complain. What
  they was all arter&mdash;the two coal clerks, the landlord, an' the old
  lady&mdash;what they paid for, was nothin' but the parrot an' the cage,
  wasn't it? Well, and there it was for them, with them all round it. They
  couldn't expect more'n that, could they?"</p>

  <p>For the first time during the story I could detect an indistinct chuckle
  from somewhere deep in Bill Wragg's throat.</p>

  <p>"There's just one thing I was sorry for," he said; "but then you can't
  'ave everything. I <i>should</i> 'a' liked to 'a' seen the shindy when them
  respectable parties got tired o' waitin', an' began to start in an' try to
  settle it all among 'em-selves! I'd almost 'a' give a quid back to 'ear 'ow
  they <i>did</i> settle it! But that 'ud be a luxury, an' a man o' business
  starting on credit can't afford luxuries!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE SELLER OF HATE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Graphic Illustrated</i>, Feb 23, 1907s</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is an English county of which it is said that the
  devil never entered it for fear of being put into a pie. At the moment I
  cannot remember which county it is, and know no more of it than to be certain
  it was not Essex, for all Essex pies are filled with much care, and are
  excellent. Nevertheless, it is the fact that in the old days, before he began
  building cheap villas, the devil very rarely came into Essex, and even now
  seldom ventures beyond the parts that they sell, by auction, in building
  lots. For the old Essex men were too hard for him, and the county bore him no
  luck. Everybody knows of his historic defeat at Barn Hall, and here I have
  the tale of his bad bargain at Cock-a-Bevis Hill.</p>

  <p>It was some little time ago&mdash;some might not call it a little time: at
  any rate it was before all the improvements&mdash;that old Luke Hoddy lived
  in a cottage on the lower slope of Cock-a-Bevis Hill. It was so small a
  cottage that it might have been called a shed without slander, and a very
  lonely, sullen, smoky, frowning, illconditioned-looking shed it was, because
  it is the property of a house to proclaim its tenant's character, and Luke
  Hoddy was that sort of man. He was lonely, like his cottage, because he was
  sullen and frowning and ill-conditioned, like it also; and they both looked
  passing smoky because of neglect.</p>

  <p>It might be venturing too far to say that Luke Hoddy was the most
  misanthropic man in the world, or even in all England. But certainly he must
  have been the most misanthropic man in all Essex, where men were all smiling,
  jolly, and pleasant together in the days when the devil feared their honest
  faces. Luke Hoddy not only hated his fellow men, but he kept pigs, and hated
  them; he also kept fowls, and hated them too. He detested the poor cottage
  wherein his poverty condemned him to live; he loathed the people who bought
  eggs of him, and so enabled him to live there; he abominated the children who
  bought apples from the tree in the garden, abominated them to such an extent
  that I cannot guess what sentiments he had left for the boys who stole them
  in the dusk. He abhorred the whole world, and everything in it. He was poor
  and ugly and old, and he resented each misfortune as though it were the
  personal and individual crime of every creature but himself. When he sold a
  fowl or a dozen eggs he did it with so evil a grace that he had to sell
  cheaper than anybody else, or keep his wares; and this was another reason for
  hating his customer. He hated the money he took, because it wasn't more; the
  eggs he sold, because he couldn't keep them; the hen that laid them, because
  there weren't thrice as many; the rest of the fowls, because they didn't
  care; and he was only glad of an order for one because he could kill it
  without losing money. If he could have wrung his customer's neck as cheaply,
  he would have done it with joy. To hate everybody better off than himself was
  part of his nature; and he hated the rest because they were so cheerful,
  comparatively. If you had given him a sackful of sovereigns he would have
  been your enemy for life, because they weren't guineas; and you would have
  deserved much worse for being such a fool.</p>

  <p>At the close of a warm autumn day Luke Roddy stood by his garden gate and
  scowled on all of the world that he could see. The sinking sun flung red gold
  along the fields and against the trees and hedges, and a little child sat to
  view the marvel, and to think wonderful things that it would long to recall
  in after life, and fail. But old Hoddy hated all the gold in the world that
  was not in his own pocket, where there was very little, and that little the
  only thing he loved. Children also he detested, for they were human beings. A
  stout, round-faced woman went down the path, with a baby on one arm and a
  basket on the other, and as she passed she called good-night. Luke flung back
  a savage growl, for this woman was a great aversion of his, being always
  happy, and all her life persistently sending more children to play on
  Cock-a-Bevis Hill. Then a girl came, driving cows, and a brown lad with her,
  and neither of them saw Luke Hoddy at all, because they were looking at each
  other. Luke positively snarled; and such a villainous twist remained on his
  face when they had passed, that a very small boy, who was coming hopefully up
  with a halfpenny gripped in his fist, greatly desiring an apple, turned and
  ran, and never stopped till he reached the goody-shop in the village; so that
  old Hoddy was the poorer by one halfpenny, and I am sorry it was no more.</p>

  <p>The day waned, and people went on their way to rest from their work, old
  and young, men and women, and old Hoddy saw the world in little pass before
  his gate, and he hated it at large. Then there went the carrier, and after
  him Paigles, the farmer, on his cob.</p>

  <p>Paigles was a notoriously poor farmer, and backward with his rent; it was
  more than believed, in fact, that his landlord would be glad to sell the farm
  and that way be quit of him, since he shrank from turning Paigles away from
  the land his great-grandfather had farmed a hundred years before him. Luke
  Hoddy grinned savagely at Paigles's back as it merged in the shadows of the
  trees. If only he had the money he would buy the farm, sell up Paigles, and
  fling him out, neck and crop. He would buy other people's houses, too, and
  treat them likewise. They hated him now, and if he had money, how he would
  grind their faces! He would grind their faces off their heads, if only he had
  the money.</p>

  <p>It was at this favorable moment that the devil ventured out on
  Cock-a-Bevis Hill. He did not come flaming and raging, in a way to frighten
  folk, for to-night that was not his business; he came dressed very well and
  neatly, like a gentleman of those days, and it struck Luke Hoddy at the time
  that he looked rather like the lawyer at Witham. He wore trousers a little
  tighter than was usual&mdash;skin-tight, in fact&mdash;with straps. His
  swallow-tailed coat was pinched in very elegantly at the waist, and his
  beaver hat was broad in the crown and wide in the brim. He carried a
  quizzing-cane, and his black stock looked as though it must have gone a dozen
  times round his neck, on a collar that was halfway up his head behind. Still,
  notwithstanding this very respectable appearence, you must not suppose that
  Luke Hoddy mistook his visitor. Indeed, he recognized him at once; his
  beautifully varnished boots looked empty at the toes, and from time to time
  something vaguely disturbed the points of his elegant coat-tail: moreover,
  his eyes would have been enough, glowing there in the dark like dull
  coals.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Hoddy," said the visitor, pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Gr-r-r-umph!" replied Luke&mdash;as near as I can spell it. He was no
  great conversationalist, finding a growl express the most of what he had to
  say.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad to meet you," the visitor went on. "I think we should know
  each other, Mr. Hoddy."</p>

  <p>"Gr-r-r-umph."</p>

  <p>"It might lead to business, I think."</p>

  <p>"Gr-r-r-umph?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You will find me an excellent customer. My command of money is
  unlimited&mdash;I handle most of what exists, at some time or other&mdash;and
  expense is no consideration, so long as I get what I want. I am prepared to
  pay, Mr. Hoddy; heavily."</p>

  <p>"Gr-r-m." It was a slightly different growl this time. Old Hoddy was
  conscious of a possible opportunity. He did not care what he sold, if only it
  would fetch enough money. "I should want a lot," he said, "a plenshus lot.
  Money down."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it."</p>

  <p>"An' I won't sign&mdash;no, not nothen'&mdash;not till I get it, every
  farden."</p>

  <p>The devil laughed&mdash;quite a gentlemanly laugh, with nothing offensive
  in it. "You are misunderstanding, Mr. Hoddy," he said. "I believe&mdash;I
  really do believe you have the absurd old notion I hear of so often. Do you
  think I want to buy your soul?"</p>

  <p>"Course," answered Luke. "What else?"</p>

  <p>"Really, really! I don't wish to say anything unkind, but is it likely? As
  I have told you, I have unlimited command of money, and I spend it freely for
  purposes of business. But I don't absolutely <i>pitch</i> it away, Mr. Hoddy!
  I don't pay for what is as good as mine already, for nothing! No, no. You are
  persisting in a very common and vulgar error. I may have entered into such a
  transaction as you indicate, now and again, but then the circumstances were
  exceptional. As a rule such an arrangement with anybody willing to enter into
  it, is altogether unnecessary, as in your case. No; I come to buy something
  else!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" demanded Hoddy, with suspicion. For his wits were not
  quick, and he knew he was dealing with a cunning customer. "Gr-r-r-umph!
  What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Hate! I want to buy hatred, wholesale. I am the largest dealer in that
  line in existence, and I pay top prices. I do not ask lower terms in
  consideration of a big contract&mdash;I will even pay a specially high rate
  to a large producer like yourself; it saves trouble, and I want to have a
  substantial stock ready to hand. I sow it about all over the world, you see,
  and it is most annoying to find oneself in some happy, contented community,
  and the stock of hatred completely out. So I am here to buy all you can
  sell."</p>

  <p>"How much?" asked Luke Hoddy, still suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we shall never quarrel about terms, I promise you. You shall make a
  fortune out of it. Of course, there are plenty of people who throw their hate
  about so that I could pick it up for nothing, but the quantities are
  comparatively small; and really, you know, a gentleman <i>can't</i> go raking
  about in gutters for remnants and scraps, like some starving blackguard after
  crusts. Wouldn't do at all, you know. So I prefer to buy wholesale, and you
  are a perfect quarry&mdash;a mine. I am ready to take your whole stock."</p>

  <p>"How much?" asked Luke Hoddy, again.</p>

  <p>The visitor grinned quietly. "I do believe," he said, "that if I wished to
  drive a hard bargain I could swindle you, Mr. Hoddy. You are so very anxious
  about the money, and I'm sure you don't really guess what a stock of the
  goods you have in hand. I could make quite a bargain for the lot, I'm
  certain, and you'd be surprised at the amount you had sacrificed. But, as I
  have told you, money is no object with me, though I am not, at present,
  urgently needing the stock. I have been to a Philanthropic Congress lately,
  where everybody exuded it, wallowed in it, and pelted everybody else with it
  to such an extent that I couldn't resist the temptation to gather it in,
  though I really attended with the idea of sowing some I already had in hand.
  I am quite well provided for a time, but as a prudent man of business I like
  to look ahead and make engagements in advance. You want to know what I will
  pay. Well, I am ready to accept bills as often as you like to draw them, each
  for anything up to five thousand pounds. Will that suit you?"</p>

  <p>Luke Hoddy gulped and gasped. This was tremendous. He had been thinking of
  fifties and hundreds, and here were thousands&mdash;and thousands over and
  over again, indefinitely. It was wonderful&mdash;too good to believe all at
  once. Perhaps it would turn out a swindle after alla trick to rob him of the
  precious hate he had cherished so long, and which now seemed a more valuable
  possession than ever. Old Hoddy did not understand the acceptance of bills,
  and he resolved to question a little more.</p>

  <p>"It seems a pretty good deal o' money," he admitted grudgingly. "Anyhow, a
  good deal for you to want to pay as can pick the stuff up. I should count
  there was plenty of hate about, too. It aint' a rare stuff."</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't. But, considering the plenteousness of the commodity, it's
  wonderful how little I get of it. People seem to want it for each other, you
  see. People talk a deal about hating me, but they hate each other so much
  more that it's very rarely I can get anybody's hatred without paying for it.
  And that is why I am here for yours."</p>

  <p>"Gr-r-r-umph! Well, I'll sell. But none o' yer bills an' 'ceptances an'
  that. I want money down. See?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have the money before I receive the goods. Will that suit
  you?"</p>

  <p>Luke thought that would do, and growled to indicate as much.</p>

  <p>The devil stooped in the shadow of the fence, and produced a box, which
  old Hoddy had not noticed before. It was a chest of some hard wood, bound and
  cornered with iron, and as soon as it rested on the fence-rail Hoddy grabbed
  it eagerly. As a box, it was heavy, but not so heavy as it should have been
  if it were full of money. In fact old Hoddy judged it empty.</p>

  <p>"There ain't no five thousand pun' in that!" he snarled.</p>

  <p>"Quite so; I never thought of pretending it. This is a little arrangement
  of my own invention, which I will explain." The night was full dark by now,
  but a dull red light fell on the chest wherever the devil pointed, and so
  Luke understood all he said.</p>

  <p>"You perceive that the box is locked. I shall keep the key, and I advise
  you, for your own sake, not to meddle. It is a dangerous thing to open, if
  you don't understand it. The lid, you see, is a deep one. That is because it
  contains a separate chamber, into which you slip your bills for acceptance.
  There is a narrow slot, you perceive, just under the upper edge. Whenever you
  wish to do business, you will fill in one of the forms I shall leave you,
  with the amount of hate you wish to sell in money, up to five thousand
  pounds, and sign it. Then you will slip the paper in at the slot, and go to
  bed. That is all. In the morning you will receive the money. But, meantime,
  you must sleep; otherwise the sale cannot be completed. Take the box, and
  remember what I say. I shall not call again till I want some of the goods.
  Then I shall take away the box and leave a fresh one. Do you know, I'm rather
  proud of the invention of that box. Some day, if I have time, I intend to
  adapt the idea to other purposes. It might be made to work with pennies, for
  matches and lollipops and such things. Good notion, eh? But here are your
  bill-forms; if you want more you can copy one of them. And remember, no more
  than five thousand pounds at one time, if you please. That is the price of
  the largest quantity of hate the machine is able to compress in a day. That
  is all, I think. Good evening, Mr. Hoddy!"</p>

  <p>And with that he was gone, vanishing in a very low and courtly bow, which
  somehow slid away backward into the shadows; leaving Luke Hoddy standing
  there with a bunch of papers in his right hand while he balanced the box on
  the fence with his left.</p>

  <p>Old Hoddy stared for a minute and a quarter, and then, convinced that he
  really was alone, he picked up the box and carried it indoors. He lit a
  candle, put on his spectacles, and began to spell out one of the papers. Thus
  it read:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Date&mdash;&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  On presentation pay to me the sum of __ for hate received.</p><br>

  <p>That seemed simple enough. Luke Hoddy sat in a chair, and stared, now, at
  the box. Having done that for a little while he turned to the paper again,
  and stared at that. And at last, when he found his faculties shaking down
  into their proper places, he got ink and pen, and filled in the topmost form.
  He filled it in for the full five thousand pounds, having a natural desire
  for as much as he could get. Then he signed it, slipped it into the slot, and
  went to bed.</p>

  <p>In the morning he woke feeling particularly well&mdash;uncommonly well. As
  he got out of bed he caught sight of his face in the jaggy piece of
  looking-glass that stood on the mantel-piece and saw a positive smile on it.
  He sat for a moment to wonder at this, and presently broke into a laugh. He
  remembered a ridiculous dream about the devil and a chest.</p>

  <p>Sunlight came in at the poky little window, and the sound of a thousand
  birds. The light fell on the corner of a deal table, and there lay a little
  bundle of papers. There was no mistake&mdash;they were the blank bills. Luke
  Hoddy rubbed his fist over his head to clear his thoughts. The thing would
  seem to have been no dream after all. But as he pulled on his clothes he
  remembered the attorney at Witham. No doubt this was some joke of
  his&mdash;Luke had noticed the extraordinary likeness from the first. But why
  should he take all this trouble to put a sell on a stranger? Luke Hoddy
  floundered into the only other room of his cottage, and there saw the
  iron-strapped box standing against the wall. Truly it was no dream. There,
  along the slot in the lid, lay the white edge of the paper, which he had
  thought he had pushed well in. Or at any rate it was some paper, or papers.
  <i>What</i> was it? He reached and pulled out&mdash;not one paper, but five;
  and each was a thousand-pound bank-note!</p>

  <p>It was true then&mdash;quite true; neither dream nor sell, but simple
  fact. Here was the actual, indubitable money. Luke Hoddy sat for a while in
  the blankest of brown studies and then began to chuckle. Chuckling, he went
  out into the open and looked across the fields, lusty and sparkling in the
  fresh morning. A little child, carrying a basin in a blue handkerchief, stood
  in amaze to see old Hoddy so merry: whereupon he gave the child an apple for
  nothing, and sat down to laugh at the strangeness of things.</p>

  <p>He sobered down after a little, and wondered at the impulse that had led
  to the gift. That apple was the first thing he had ever given away in his
  life, and it seemed a foolish thing to do. Especially&mdash;and the thought
  came like a grip at the throat&mdash;especially if the thing was a sell after
  all, and the notes spurious.</p>

  <p>This was a matter that must be settled at once. So he watched for the
  carrier's cart that morning, and went by it to Witham, to the bank. Here his
  spirits rose again, for the cashier made no difficulty about the notes, but
  opened an account with them, and old Hoddy left the premises with a pass-book
  of his own, containing an entry of five thousand pounds to his credit.</p>

  <p>He resolved to see about Paigles's farm without delay, and to that end
  called on the attorney. Hoddy observed the lawyer pretty closely, and was
  relieved to find that although he was smartly enough dressed, he was not so
  very much like the visitor of last night, after all. The lawyer promised to
  make discreet inquires as to the price of the farm, and Luke Hoddy left
  him.</p>

  <p>That night he filled in another bill for the full five thousand, and in
  the morning drew out another bunch of notes. Then he went out and caught the
  children going to school and distributed apples among them, till nothing
  remained on the tree but leaves; laughing so much at the fun that rumors
  arose that old Hoddy was gone mad. The bank-cashier was a little surprised to
  see him again with precisely the same amount, and the lawyer was also a
  little surprised to have another visit, and instructions to look out for a
  few more freehold investments, in addition to Paigles's farm. But that
  mattered nothing, and the next day old Luke Hoddy banked five thousand
  more.</p>

  <p>Paigles's farm was for sale, and at a moderate price; also there was a
  deal of other eligible property to be had in the neighborhood, and as the
  money rolled in Hoddy took the first steps toward becoming a landed
  proprietor of no small consideration.</p>

  <p>But lawyers have their fees to earn, and between the first steps and the
  last there are a great many more, and in those days there were more than
  there are now; and every step took time. So that it came to pass that, before
  the last seal was pressed and the last fee earned, old Hoddy, rising one
  morning very merry, turned to pull out his customary notes from the box, but
  instead of five, found only one piece of paper, and that not a bank-note. It
  was, in fact, his own bill of exchange, just as he had drawn it the night
  before; except that there now appeared across it, in the blurred capitals of
  a roughly-inked stamp, the words REFERRED TO DRAWER.</p>

  <p>Luke Hoddy had grown so used to drawing his money regularly and making his
  daily trip to Witham, that he went through some minutes of dumb amazement
  before he realized that his stock of hate was at last absolutely exhausted,
  and no more bank-notes were to be expected from the box. At first his smile
  faded and his face lengthened; but it was not for long. Indeed he was a very
  rich man, and he had of late begun to wonder what he should do with all his
  money. For the credit of human nature I shall not tell the precise figure of
  old Hoddy's riches; and very few would believe in the existence of such a
  stock of hate as it would imply, if I did. But he was a very rich man, and
  was putting money into other securities beside land. So his face soon
  broadened again into the grin it had worn since he had stripped his
  apple-tree. He would not need to go to Witham to-day, and he would have
  leisure to think things over.</p>

  <p>He was still in the little cottage on Cock-a-Bevis Hill&mdash;indeed there
  had scarce been time for a change. He used to detest the place, but now that
  all his hate was sold, he rather liked the situation. He had a design of
  building a house close by, some day, but meantime the cottage did very well,
  and he resolved in any event to leave it standing, and use it sometimes.</p>

  <p>He went out into his garden and beyond the fence, whistling. Presently he
  saw the girl coming, driving her cows out to the meadow, and the brown lad
  with her, just as they had passed, in the opposite direction, on the evening
  when Hoddy had received the Owner of the Box. But this time they could not
  help seeing him, for he called to them gaily, with questions about banns and
  a wedding-day, and a promise of a silver tea-pot when the day should come.
  And when they had passed he was reminded to fill a basket with eggs and carry
  them down to the cottage of the round-faced woman who had so many children.
  After which, finding his experience in generosity such novel fun, he got five
  shillingsworth of pennies at the Crown and Cushion and gave one to every
  child he could catch. Some of them wanted a deal of catching, for it was not
  easy for people to understand this change in old Hoddy's habits. The fact was
  that not only had he got rid of all his old hatred, but when he remembered it
  he felt a little ashamed, and had a great desire to make amends.</p>

  <p>Paigles's farm was bought at last, and more than half the parish with it;
  the last fee was paid and the deeds were locked in the strongroom at the
  bank. Then, when the time came to sell up Paigles, old Hoddy lowered his rent
  instead. And as to the other tenants, he discovered a way of grinding their
  faces against platters and quart pots, giving them and their families the
  most enormous dinner, in three barns, that Cock-a-Bevis Hill had ever looked
  down on.</p>

  <p>It was in the merriment that followed this dinner that the transactions
  began that revealed the sole drawback to Hoddy's extraordinary bargain. For
  in his sudden revulsion from misanthropy and misogyny he conceived an almost
  exaggerated opinion of the attractions of his tenant's daughters and sisters,
  and, in some cases, of their aunts and mothers. Nor did it stop there, for as
  the days went and the news of his wealth and amiability spread and multiplied
  old Hoddy found himself involved in such a complication of entanglements,
  that there was nothing for it but once again to call in the aid of the Witham
  attorney, by whose arts, and the payment of a good deal of money, actions for
  breach were compromised, bigamy averted, and safety found in the end by
  marriage with an active and respectable widow.</p>

  <p>But these things came to a head later, and in any case they have little to
  do with the story. Meantime, the iron-strapped box stood in the corner of
  Luke Hoddy's keeping-room, full of compressed hate, waiting for the devil to
  come and fetch it.</p>

  <p>Now the report of old Hoddy's sudden wealth went about among the good folk
  of those parts, and not among the good folk only. It reached also two
  vagabond thieves, tramping through Witham from Springfield gaol, after a
  narrow squeak for their necks at the assizes; and this was not the first time
  they had cheated the gallows. They turned aside from the main road because of
  the rumors, for a feeble old man of great wealth, living alone in a cottage
  of two rooms, offered singular attractions to their inquiring natures.</p>

  <p>They came to Cock-a-Bevis Hill, and learned enough to make them very
  hopeful; and that night they took a lantern and two bludgeons, and lifted old
  Hoddy's simple latch with neither noise nor trouble. Old Hoddy was snoring
  sturdily in the other room, but though they had come willing to stop his
  snore for ever, they checked at the sight of the iron-bound box in the
  corner. It stood very notable among the poor furniture about it, and here,
  they were well assured, was the best the place could yield, the end of their
  desires&mdash;the treasure chest. So they left old Hoddy to his snore, and
  carried the box quietly out, and up the breezy slope of Cocka-Bevis Hill
  under the stars. In a sheltered hollow near the top they set it down, and
  pried it open with a chisel; and that was the end of both of them.</p>

  <p>In the morning Paigles's horseman found them lying dead in the hollow,
  contorted and black&mdash;something like men struck by lightning; and the box
  lay by them, plain and empty.</p>

  <p>When Luke Hoddy learned the news in the morning he looked up the hill and
  at the clouds, and saw that the breeze held steady from the west, as it had
  done the day before; and he knew that all his hate had been carried away on
  the winds from off the earth. It had saved the hangman a double turn, and
  that was all it had done, good or bad; what became of it nobody could ever
  tell, though since the wind was from the west, some of it may have fallen in
  Germany.</p>

  <p>But the Owner of the Box was sadly vexed, as you would guess. Nevertheless
  he dissembled his anger, and as soon as he heard of his misfortune (which he
  did by means of which I know nothing) he came to old Hoddy, polite as ever,
  with the idea of reducing his bad debt as far as possible. He went cautiously
  to work, being out of confidence with himself in the county of Essex, and
  remembering his ancient defeat at Barn Hall&mdash;of which I may tell another
  time. "Well, Mr. Hoddy," he said, "we've had a little misfortune. It's no
  fault of yours, of course, and I shall make some very special arrangements
  for the guilty parties. But to prove my perfect and continued confidence in
  yourself, I've come to do business again, on very exceptional terms. I'm
  ready to enter into that other little transaction at which you hinted during
  our last interview. As I said then, it's a thing I rarely do, in spite of
  vulgar opinion to the contrary; but in your case, on old and respected
  customer, I'm willing to stretch a point. You've found me treat you very well
  in our first deal, and I don't want to drop the connection. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>Because, you see, now that all Hoddy's hate was quite gone, Hoddy himself
  was such a very different person that he was a very desirable bargain, and
  the devil was ready to buy him forthwith.</p>

  <p>Old Hoddy chuckled deep and long. "It do seem to me," he said, "as you'd
  do better in the shires; I count you make a poor trade in Essex. At Dedham
  an' Snoreham they be too wide awake for 'ee, an' too clever at Little Witham;
  you'd starve at Pinchpoles, an' you can't fob'em at fobbing. But a shire man
  allus was a fool, an' I count you'd do better right over across the Lea, at
  Much Hadham. What you're at now is to buy me, eh?"</p>

  <p>"At a great price, Mr. Hoddy; a noble sum!"</p>

  <p>Old Hoddy chuckled again. "Very kind, I'm sure. 'Fore I lost my hate I'd
  ha' talked it over longways, but ready meat's my victual. D'ye know the stile
  at the bottom o' t' hill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, if ye go over that an' keep along by t' hedge, you come to
  anoather. Know that?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Other side o' that there's a ditch."</p>

  <p>"Just so."</p>

  <p>"An' a meddy with a tree in the middle&mdash;oak. D'ye know the oak
  too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you went along down there now, arl alone, an' ran round that
  there oak, who'd you be a-chasin'?"</p>

  <p>"Myself."</p>

  <p>Old Hoddy guffawed loud and long, with his thumb against his nose. "Go on
  then!" he said. "That's my opinion, too!"</p>

     id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE RODD STREET REVOLUTION</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Tom Browne, R.I.</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Jun 1908</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">I HAVE told the tale of the Red Cow Anarchist group in
  another place, and at another time; indeed I am startled to remember that it
  was fourteen years ago. As a fact the credit of that tale, if it has any, is
  due to my disreputable friend, Snorkey Timms, who told it me, as he told me
  others. He it was who first discovered Sotcher, the founder and victim of the
  Red Cow Group, and he it was who told me also this other tale of an earlier
  group of Sotcher's founding.</p>

  <p>Teddy Mills, it would seem, was a shoemaker, who lived and worked in a
  very small house in Rodd Street, Bethnal Green&mdash;a very small street,
  which could only be reached by making several turns and twists through and
  out of other streets nearly as small. The little house had once been one of a
  row of country cottages, and the row even now carried some vague air of
  blighted ruralism, because of the muddy strips of front garden, which many
  tumbling children shared with many lank cats and a few very desperate scarlet
  runners on strings.</p>

  <p>Teddy Mills, small, bristly and wild of eye, was Sotcher's newest convert.
  As a jobbing shoemaker, in accordance with the mysterious laws which make all
  jobbing shoemakers swarthy and ill-shaved and politically rebellious, Teddy
  Mills was promising material, and Sotcher, lank, greasy and unwashed, fresh
  from the Anarchist Club in Berners Street, Shadwell, fastened on him at once.
  For, indeed, Teddy Mills made good material in other respects than that of
  his native readiness to join in the abuse and overthrow of whomsoever he
  might suspect of superiority, in fortune or qualities, over himself; for one
  thing, he had good work, and consequently money which might be cadged.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Teddy Mills had a wife, who was very intractable
  material indeed. Sotcher's impassioned teachings, received with enthusiasm by
  Teddy Mills, brought from Mrs. Mills no better tribute than a sniff of
  contempt; and the lady's opinion of Sotcher himself, wholly unfavorable, she
  expressed with much freedom and no politeness. And so it came about that,
  from the day of Sotcher's appearance, things went less smoothly in the Mills
  household. Teddy Mills's time soon seemed to be divided between listening to
  Sotcher and quarrelling with Mrs. Mills, so that very little was left for
  mere business, and the making and mending of shoes became more and more a
  theory of yesterday and to-morrow, and less and less a practice of
  to-day.</p>

  <p>"Well," Mrs. Mills would say, appearing suddenly with a red face and
  tucked-up skirts after a day's washing, "I've done my day's work, 'cept
  clearin' up. 'Ow much 'a' you done?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic23"

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"I've done more'n you think," her husband would reply, with evasive
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that you 'ave, if you've done anythink but sit an' jaw along o' that
  dirty greasy spongin' thief Sotcher. I 'card 'im. I 'card 'im tellin' you to
  do away with the p'lice. You'd look fine doin' away with the p'lice, you
  would! You'll do away with me, if there's much more of it! 'Ow long am I to
  keep this place goin' like this?"</p>

  <p>"When the social revolution comes," Teddy Mills explained, "we sha'n't
  neither of us 'ave to work more'n an hour or two a day, 'cos everybody'll
  'ave to work."</p>

  <p>"An hour or two! Ho! An' 'ow's this place to be kep' clean an' food cooked
  an' all in an hour or two! But p'raps a woman's work don't count. An hour or
  two, says you! An' 'ow'll your dear friend Sotcher like it, I wonder? A 'ole
  hour! Did 'e ever do an hour's work in 'is life?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Scotcher's a speaker, I tell you, a pioneer&mdash;one as teaches the
  propaganda&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Proper what? Gander? It's a proper goose 'e teaches when 'e comes 'ere
  a-preachin' to you! With 'is free this an' free that, an' free drinks between
  whiles! I ain't a-goin' to stand it much longer, so I tell you! I ain't
  a-goin' to work 'ere for you an' 'im too, on nothink. I can earn my livin'
  alone, I can, an' I will, if there ain't a change!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mills tried Sotcher with direct personal insult, but that had no
  better effect than to turn his unceasing discourse to the denunciation of
  marriage as an oppressive and inconvenient institution, which should shortly
  be abolished, with the police, the magistracy, and every other relic of
  privileged authority, temporal and spiritual. On her part, Teddy's wife grew
  more urgently bitter as the days went.</p>

  <p>And so it came to pass that one fine morning Sotcher arrived at the gate
  of Mills's front garden to find Teddy standing by the post, clutching at his
  touzled hair perplexedly, and staring gloomily up the street.</p>

  <p>"She's gone," he reported briefly.</p>

  <p>"Gone where?" asked the visitor, gazing up the street also, and seeing
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," replied Teddy. "She's hooked it, that's all. I did a bit o'
  work last night, an' took it 'orne this mornin'; an' when I carne back there
  was this on the table."</p>

  <p>He extended a crumpled scrap of paper, on which Sotcher read the scrawl:
  <i>"Good bye, I'm agoing to work for myself now."</i></p>

  <p>"Selfishness," commented Sotcher. "The selfishness prevailent at the
  present time is due to the rotten state of s'ciety an' the oppression o' the
  privileged classes. When we 'ave the social revolution, an' free an' absolute
  liberty o' the individual, then selfishness 'll be swep' out o' the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Teddy blankly, "but what&mdash;what am I a-goin' to do
  till it is?"</p>

  <p>"Wave aloft the banner o' free an' unrestricted brotherhood and liberty in
  the face o' the bloated circles o' class an' capitalistic privilege," replied
  Sotcher, with the fluency of a fresh-oiled machine.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"'I said we'd raise our free 'ands an' voices in the sacred cause o'
  universal anarchy an' proudly march in the van of progress to the glorious
  consummation o' the social upheaval," Sotcher continued, knowing that one
  sentence meant as much as the other, and airing them, therefore, in turn.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;jesso," replied Teddy Mills, turning his uneasy glance toward
  the little front door; "but what about the washin'?"</p>

  <p>Sotcher's eloquence was not to be turned aside. "Comrades with a glorious
  mission like us," he pursued, "can't waste time over washin'. I don't." The
  truth of this remark was visible to the naked eye. "We fix our eyes forward
  and up'ard, trampling under the feet of free initiative the relics of
  barbarous authority, an' overthrowin' the bloodstained temples of
  capitalistic monopoly!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," responded Teddy; "but when I said washin', I wasn't
  thinkin' so much of <i>our</i> washin'. She's bin takin' in washin' lately,
  an' earnin' a bit, an' I shall miss it."</p>

  <p>This was a more serious matter, and Sotcher paused thoughtfully. He
  considered the situation for a moment, and then produced a brilliant
  project.</p>

  <p>"Comrade Mills!" he said, lifting and exhibiting to Teddy's gaze the palm
  of a very grubby hand, "this is an 'istoric moment!"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" asked Teddy innocently.</p>

  <p>"It is. It's lucky your wife's gone, an' so put the scheme into my 'ead.
  We don't want 'er. We'll found the first real Anarchist colony!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Teddy interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"That 'amble 'orne o' yours," proceeded Sotcher, "will be 'anded down the
  ages on golden trumpets, an' inscribed on the 'arts of generations to come.
  We'll begin the social revolution there!"</p>

  <p>"All right," assented Teddy. So complete was his belief in Sotcher, that
  if the proposal had been to redistribute the solar system there he would have
  said "All right," just the same.</p>

  <p>"We'll bring in one or two comrades an' live together in the full
  brother'ood of anarchy, an' give a example to the toilin' millions about us.
  We'll 'ave perfect individual freedom an' voluntary co-operation, an' the
  'ole world'll take a lesson by us an' bust out in the glorious daybreak of
  Universal Autonomy!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Teddy, again.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">SOTCHER invited the co-operation of two more comrades, and
  he did not bring them from the Anarchist Club. Four he judged a convenient
  total number, since the house had four rooms, and he did not bring the two
  new comrades from the club, because he knew the club of old. There they were
  all talkers as fluent as himself, and not listeners. Sotcher wanted
  listeners. It was for that reason&mdash;partly&mdash;that he sallied forth
  "spreading the light;" for that, and because the Anarchist Club was the very
  worst place he knew for borrowing in.</p>

  <p>So he brought fresh material. He brought one Billy Snider, a furtive
  person with an elusive squint and a curious property of looking smaller than
  he really was, though he was not large at best. Billy Snider, it seemed, was
  an "individual expropriator." for years in the matter of private property he
  had been putting Anarchistic principles into practice without knowing it, and
  the bloated bourgeois called him a thief. He had derived a great deal of
  consolation and surprise from the discovery, drawn from Sotcher's discourse,
  that he was in reality a pioneer of human regeneration, working to an heroic
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Sotcher also brought a certain Joe Budd, a very large man of much muscular
  development, with a face like knotted timber and a black eye that was
  sometimes the right and sometimes the left, and occasionally double, but
  always there. Mr. Budd was not understood to be partial to any particular
  profession, and the beer required for his sustenance had hitherto been
  chiefly contributed by friends who preferred to see him in a good temper.
  Sotcher had laid his account with care, for if Teddy Mills would work at his
  trade and Billy Snider "expropriate" out of doors for the benefit of the
  community, while Joe Budd kept off inconvenient interference, and terrorized
  such persons as broker's men, then Sotcher, for his part, was ready to supply
  all the talk the enterprise might require.</p>

  <p>It was a great occasion for Sotcher, when the four assembled that evening,
  and he for the first time addressed a group that was all his own.</p>

  <p>"Comrades!" he cried, with a sweep of the arm that might have included a
  thousand, "we are 'ere to open, to inaugurate, or as I may say to begin, the
  Social Revolution! In this 'ere 'umble 'orne we are to set rollin' the ball
  that shall pave the way for the up'eaval of 'umanity, and, spreadin' its
  wings to the uttermost ends of the earth, write its name in letters of fire
  across the 'eavens! The only law an' order for free men is Anarchy! We shall
  live 'ere, comrades, in perfeck freedom under a brotherly compact that won't
  bind nobody. We shall set a example o' free life, with no law an' no
  authority, as 'll open the eyes o' the toilin' proletariat an' stir them to
  copy our noble proceedin's, an' go on to overthrow the p'lice an' the
  gover'ment, an' the water-rates an' all the disgustin' machinery of organized
  oppression!"</p>

  <p>"'Ear, 'ear!" cried Teddy Mills.</p>

  <p>"Our watchword shall be liberty, an' down with privilege an' monopoly.
  What is liberty, my comrades? Is it magistrates, an' prisons, 'an p'lice at
  the corner of every street?"</p>

  <p>"No!" interjected Billy Snider fervently.</p>

  <p>"It is not, comrades. The police is the protector of the real criminals,
  the plunderin' so-called upper classes! Stands to reason no honest man would
  want pertectin' by p'lice. P'lice is brute force&mdash;the brute force as the
  privileged classes is 'edged theirselves in with; paid myrmidons makin'
  slaves o' the people. <i>We</i> don't want no myrmidons, do we?" ("No!" again
  from Billy). "O' course not. We'd disdain to be seen speakin' to 'em. Very
  well, then, what does anybody else want with 'em? What but privilege an'
  monopoly? We will break down all privilege an' monopoly! Our comrade 'ere,
  our comrade Billy Snider, has been breakin' down monopolies for years. Not on
  a grand scale, p'raps, but wherever 'e could in a small way, an' 'e's
  suffered for it. In fact 'e's not long out from six months for breakin' down
  some bloated capitalist's monopoly of a gold watch an' chain. It's property
  as is the real robbery, an' all expropriators are our brothers. We now begin
  the social revolution, comrades. Liberty for all, voluntary co-operation,
  free initiative, free contrack, subject to perpetual change an' revision, do
  what you like an' take what you want&mdash;them's our principles, an' our
  only law is that there is no laws. I 'ave 'ere a box which will 'old the
  money of the community, an' I begin by offerin' it to comrade Mills, who will
  'ave the honor o' bein' the first to give up 'is private ownership, an'
  placin' whatever money 'e 'as in the funds of the group."</p>

  </div>

  <p>Teddy Mills, amid encouraging murmurs, dropped into the box the sum of
  sixteen shillings and sevenpence; a large part of it would be due, next
  Monday, for rent, but a week's rent is not a thing to bother about when you
  are starting a revolution.</p>

  <p>Billy Snider's contribution was rather less, and Joe Budd was discovered
  to have suddenly fallen asleep. Being with much difficulty aroused he
  promised to see about it to-morrow; and, showing signs of unpleasant
  irritation, was allowed to lapse into slumber once more. Sotcher produced a
  sixpence and three pennies with much solemnity.</p>

  <p>"I ain't so fortunate as you, comrades," he explained, "in bein' able to
  contribute quite so liberal, but sich as it is it is my all, an' give freely.
  All the more credit to me, p'raps you'll say, comrades, but no&mdash;I don't
  claim no more merit than anybody else 'ere. There it is, give freely. Doubts
  'ave been cast on the tanner, though only by slaves of the capitalist, sich
  as barmen. This is our capital, comrades, in this 'ere box, an' all money as
  comes in goes to it; an' what anybody wants he takes. We won't vote, for
  majority tyranny is the worst of all tyrannies, but I suggest we begin by
  gettin' in a little beer."</p>

  <p>The suggestion was agreed to, and with the advent of the beer, Joe Budd's
  nap terminated with as much suddenness as it had begun. "I like your
  speechmakin'," observed Billy Snider, over the beer, to Sotcher. "You put it
  fust rate. That about monopolies, you know. That's my principles, but I
  couldn't ha' put it so 'andsome. An' that about free contrack, too, an'
  changin' your mind when you like."</p>

  <p>"One o' the first principles of Anarchy," remarked Sotcher. "Free contrack
  between man an' man, perpetual subjeck to revision an' cancellation. It is
  forbidden now by the rule of the brutal majority."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I know that," observed Snider, "an I've suffered for it. I went
  a-bookmakin' once, to Alexander's Park Races. I did very well an' made a 'ole
  lot o' contracks, layin' the odds; but when I'd got my satchel pretty full o'
  the backers' money, an' they was lookin' at the 'orses, an' I 'ad time to
  think things over, why, I changed my mind about the contracks, same as
  anybody might do, an' started to go 'orne. Why not? But the brutal majority
  treated me shameful. Chucked me into a pond, they did, an' I 'adn't got
  more'n about a quarter of a suit o' clothes to go 'orne in."</p>

  <p>"All owin' to the rotten system o' s'ciety," commented Sotcher. "The rule
  o' the majority's just as bad as any other rule; but there's to be no rule
  an' no majority now&mdash;no commerce an' profit-huntin'; free exchange, free
  everything!"</p>

  <p>"That's what I've been lookin' for for a long time," said Joe Budd
  fervently, and finished his pot.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to set going an entirely new system of life without a
  little friction, and the friction began at bed-time. There was only one bed
  in the place, and Billy Snider, having with much foresight discovered this
  fact in time, went to bed first, unostentatiously. When this treachery became
  apparent, Joe Budd's righteous indignation was worthy of the occasion. He
  took the slumbering betrayer of the rights of man by a leg and an arm, and
  hauled him out on the floor.</p>

  <p>"D'ye call this equal rights," he demanded. "You sleepin' comf'table in a
  bed, an' us on the floor? Ought to be ashamed o' yerself. You ain't got no
  more rights in that bed than we'ave; 'an as I pulled you out I'm goin' to
  sleep in it." Which he did.</p>

  <p>In the morning it was perceived that Billy Snider had risen early and gone
  out.</p>

  <p>"Gone on a job," commented Sotcher. "Hope he'll bring back something
  good."</p>

  <p>At this moment Joe Budd, whose hand had strayed carelessly over the edge
  of the money-box as it lay on its shelf, uttered a gasp, and pulled down the
  box bodily. It was empty Joe Budd's opinion of Billy Snider when he pulled
  him out of bed was mere flattery to the opinion he expressed now. He kept at
  it so long that at length Teddy Mills took up a pair of boots that were
  partly mended and set to work to finish them. The sight of Teddy's industry
  somewhat calmed Joe, and presently he asked: "How long 'll you be getting
  them done?"</p>

  <p>"Not more'n a quarter of an hour," Teddy estimated.</p>

  <p>"Right," returned Joe, sitting down and feeling for his pipe. "I'll take
  'em 'orne for you."</p>

  <p>But here Sotcher interposed. "Don't you bother, comrade," he said; "they
  mightn't know you. I'll take 'em 'orne."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Joe, taking his pipe from his mouth and looking very
  squarely into Sotcher's eyes. "I bet you won't."</p>

  <p>Sotcher let it stand at that, and resigned himself to watch Teddy's work.
  When it was done, and the largest sum that could possibly be charged was
  decided on, Joe Budd was given precise directions to find the chandler's shop
  where the boots were due, and departed with them under his arm.</p>

  <p>"Comrade Joe Budd," observed Sotcher, gazing thoughtfully at the ceiling,
  "is a noble soul, as every friend o' the social revolution must be. But from
  the point o' view o' the group, p'raps it's a pity 'e took them boots
  'orne."</p>

  <p>"Why," asked Teddy, "'e won't stick to the money, will 'e?"</p>

  <p>"Stick to it? No&mdash;not stick to it; not stick to it long, anyway. But
  'e's a noble, impulsive soul, an' liable to get thirsty very sudden. An' 'e
  deals very free an' large, as regards thirst."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Budd's thirst was destined to be unrelieved as yet. In five
  minutes he burst into the room in a state of exacerbated ill-temper, and
  exhibited strong signs of a desire to catch Teddy Mills by the throat. Teddy
  took up a position behind a table, with dodging-room on either hand.</p>

  <p>"What d'ye mean?" demanded Joe Budd. "What d'ye mean by sendin' me out for
  nothin'? The chap at the chandler's shop's been an' took it off your bill,
  an' 'e says you owe 'im one 'an ninepence ha'penny besides!"</p>

  <p>"Does 'e?" Teddy answered blankly. "It's very likely. My wife used to run
  a bill with 'im, but I didn't know 'ow it stood."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Budd was aware of something very like a chuckle from Sotcher.</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed, turning his wrath in a new direction; "laughin', was
  ye? Laughin' at me? Call that liberty, I s'pose? All right&mdash;gimme that
  'at."</p>

  <p>Sotcher's hat was a sad thing, but he wore it indoors and out as an
  expression of contempt for social forms. Joe Budd snatched it from his head,
  and drove out the dent in the crown with a punch of his fist.</p>

  <p>"You take a liberty with me," he said, "an' I'll take one with
  you&mdash;that's equal rights. I'll expropriate this 'ere 'at, an' swop it
  for the clock on the mantelpiece&mdash;that's free exchange; and if I 'ave
  any o' your lip you'll get a free punch on the nose!"</p>

  <p>And therewith, carrying the clock under his arm, Mr. Joe Budd walked out
  for the day.</p>

  <p><a id="pic25"

  </div>

  <p>It was a dull day's work for Teddy Mills, spite of Sotcher's eloquence.
  Sotcher explained that little difficulties were inevitable in the early
  stages of so glorious an undertaking as theirs, but that things would go more
  smoothly every hour. Late in the evening Joc Budd returned, very red in the
  face, a trifle thick in the voice, but noisy and argumentative withal.</p>

  <p>He took the money-box from the shelf and shook it contemptuously. "Empty,
  o' course," he said. "You two ain't donc much for this 'ere community to-day,
  but I will."</p>

  <p>He dropped a pawn-ticket into the box, and put it down before them.
  "That's the ticket for the clock," he pursued; "all there is in the box.
  Seems to me you expect me to keep this 'ere show goin' all by myself. Well,
  any'ow I done my share to-day&mdash;where's my supper?"</p>

  <p>He glared from Teddy Mills to Sotcher, and back to Teddy again. But with
  that his attention was drawn in another direction by the stealthy entrance of
  Billy Snider.</p>

  <p>Snider slid in quietly, though with an elaborate air of careless
  indifference. Joe sprang up and seized him by the arm. "Where's that money?"
  demanded the outraged Budd.</p>

  <p>"Money? What money?" asked Billy, with much innocent surprise.</p>

  <p>"What money? You know what money; all the money; the money in the
  box!"</p>

  <p>Billy Snider wriggled uncomfortably and looked from one to another. "In
  the box? Oh, that? Well, I wanted it, you know, so I just took it&mdash;like
  we arranged."</p>

  <p>"Like we&mdash;like we&mdash;Why, you took it all!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. I wanted it all."</p>

  <p>Joe Budd wasted no more words, but swung Billy Snider across the room, and
  pushed him backward over the table. "You turn out yer pockets," he commanded,
  "or I'll tear 'em out o' your trousers an' bash you arterwards. Go on! Turn
  'em inside out!"</p>

  <p>Billy Snider glanced towards the other comrades, but saw no encouragement.
  Very grudgingly he extracted several shillings and a few coppers from one
  trouser pocket and put them on the table.</p>

  <p>"Go on! Out with the rest!"</p>

  <p>With another reluctant effort, Billy added some more shillings; but Joe,
  with a preference for quicker business, thrust his fingers into his victim's
  waistcoat pockets with no reluctance whatever, and there found three
  sovereigns!</p>

  <p>"Three quid!" cried Joe. "Look at that! An' last night 'e 'adn't got
  fifteen bob to pay into the funds!"</p>

  <p>He released Billy and turned from one comrade to another a look of grieved
  surprise. "Seems to me I've bin made a victim of in this 'ere business," he
  said. "You're all in it, I b'lieve. Well, well&mdash;I won't appoint myself
  treasurer, 'cos that 'ud be officialism an' authority, an' agin the sacred
  principles of anarchy; I won't be treasurer, but I will take care o' the
  money. Where's my supper?" he proceeded, with a sudden burst of wrath. "'Ere
  you, Mr. Bloomin' Jawmedead, take that, an' get my supper!"</p>

  <p>It was Sotcher who was addressed, and "that" was a vigorous bang in the
  eye. Sotcher staggered and gasped, and, with a tender hand over the bruised
  feature began a noisy protest based on the rights of sovereign humanity.</p>

  <p>"Rights?" retorted Joe Budd; "it's equal rights for all, ain't it? Very
  well, I've punched you in the eye&mdash;you've got just as much right to
  punch me. Goin' to? Eh? Ain't you? 'Cos if you ain't, go an' get my supper.
  That's voluntary co-operation, that is. 'Anarchy is order' is what you told
  me yerself, an' I'm goin' to 'ave my orders carried out 'ere. I ain't agoin'
  to belong to a free community an' be done out o' my rights. This 'ere's a
  brother'ood of free initiative, whether you like it or no!"</p>

  <p>Late that night, when Joe Budd had retired in state to the bed that had
  been Teddy's, Billy Snider suggested the propriety of a simultaneous attack
  on the common oppressor. But Sotcher, still tenderly fingering the black eye,
  was sure that his principles would never permit him to participate in an act
  involving the Tyranny of the Majority.</p>

  <p>And in the morning it was found that Billy Snider had risen early again.
  He had not interfered with the box this time, for the pawn-ticket lay
  undisturbed. But Joe Budd, swathed in a blanket, came downstairs in a typhoon
  of violent language, to announce that his clothes were all gone, with the
  money in the pockets.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced that Joe Budd's was the best suit of clothes in the house,
  while Sotcher's would never have paid for carrying off. But although
  Sotcher's clothes were left, and not a rag the worse, it was observed that he
  paled instantly at the announcement of Billy's second evasion, and clapped
  his hands to his pockets. There were some seconds of agonized and contorted
  investigation, and then the orator straightway vanished into the outer
  street; whence he returned in five minutes in company with that foe of all
  his dearest principles&mdash;a policeman.</p>

  <p>"I've bin robbed in this 'ouse," Sotcher complained clamorously. "I've bin
  robbed o' two pound one an' four in this 'ouse, an' I'll 'ave the for of
  somebody! That's the master o' the 'ouse, constable, an' 'is name's Mills.
  Ain't 'e responsible? I've bin robbed in this 'ouse, I tell you, an' I won't
  stand it. 'E's responsible in the eye o' the lor! Two pound one an' four was
  in my pockets, an' while there's for an' magistrates an' p'lice in the
  country I mean to 'ave my rights. There's the man o' the 'ouse,
  constable!"</p>

  <p>Boys came running, and women with aprons over their heads: and the Rodd
  Street revolution wound up ignobly in a street row of the most ordinary
  Bethnal Green type, the centre whereof was marked by the towering helmet of
  the policeman, about which swirled the excited forms of Teddy Mills, Alfred
  Sotcher, and a large and violent man in a blanket. While in the distance was
  perceived the rapidly approaching form of Mrs. Mills, who had heard rumors of
  strange doings at the home she had left temporarily, with a view of giving
  her husband a salutary shock, and was now most vigorously resolved to go and
  investigate matters for herself.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT: A FANTASY</h2>

  <p class="first">IF I cannot tell a tale of a haunted house in which I have
  lived, nor even of one in which I have passed a night of trembling adventure
  (and indeed neither experience has been my fortune), I at least know enough
  of the strange case of Missel Hall to be able to present it in its
  completeness, or at any rate in as much of its completeness as will ever be
  known, and with an accuracy to which, I believe, few other persons could
  pretend.</p>

  <p>The house is fairly large, as one might expect from its title; yet not
  altogether so large as one may sometimes see a "hall," for, indeed, the name
  is given rather loosely in Essex to almost any house of the least pretension.
  Wherefore it must be remembered that Missel Hall is not such a hall as some I
  have seen&mdash;like a quarter of a mile of Park Lane with a terrace before
  it&mdash;nor is it a mere farmhouse, like Tarpots Hall. It was, and is, no
  more nor less than a comfortably large house, just large enough for its
  advancing ends to be called wings. It stood in a comparatively bare part of
  the commonly well-grown county of Essex, and on a slight elevation, which
  looked across a little common, or heath, that was unusually flat for that
  same county, which the ignorant stranger believes to be flat everywhere.</p>

  <p>When I called the house comfortably large, I meant that, and nothing more.
  That is to say, so far as size might give comfort, Missel Hall had it; but so
  far as a plague of ghosts and their terrors might abolish comfort, Missel
  Hall was the most uncomfortable house in the county. Once more I pick my
  words with care. The Hall <i>was</i> the most uncomfortable house in the
  county, before it received its last tenants; soon after their arrival the
  more active troubles ceased, and the whole ghostly peculiarities of the place
  settled down into one&mdash;silent and weird. There was a room which had a
  light of its own.</p>

  <p>It was not a mere point of light&mdash;a ghostly candle, "corpse-light,"
  or anything of that sort&mdash;but a wan, sickly luminousness that filled the
  whole apartment. It is to be presumed that it persisted night and day, though
  bright daylight made it imperceptible; for as soon as the light began to
  fail, and even at midday, when a heavy thundercloud turned noon to twilight,
  the pale light grew visible through the one window of the haunted room, and
  persisted, through night or storm, till full sunlight outstared it.</p>

  <p>To see the house from the heath, standing black and desolate like a rock
  against the evening sky, with its one eye of unearthly light, was uncanny
  enough, but perhaps the effect was heightened when other windows showed the
  warm light of common lamps; for the contrast was striking, and no stranger
  could have passed without a twinge of surprise and wonder at the spectral
  light of the single high window in the east wing. I have heard people confess
  to a chilliness of scalp and spine at the sight. There was never another
  house in Essex be-. devilled exactly in this way, though I think I remember
  to have heard some talk of a case rather like it in a western county.</p>

  <p>But this strange light, as I have said, was not seen till after the
  arrival of the last tenants of Missel Hall. Before then the whole place had
  been given over to ghostly disturbances of many sorts; with the arrival of
  the Quilter family these suddenly ceased, and were immediately succeeded by
  this, a phenomenon wholly unprecedented, and, it would seem, less capable of
  explanation than any that had gone before.</p>

  <p>The house was an old one, and hitherto all its ghostly appointments had
  been strictly correct and according to proper fashion and precedent. In
  course of time, it is true, they had grown so numerous as to make the house
  difficult to live in, for persons of any nerves but the strongest, and in the
  end they had caused the place to stand empty for some years; but there was
  nothing irregular&mdash;everything was perfectly in good form and (blessed
  phrase) <i>comme il faut.</i> There were:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Rappings.<br>
  Rumblings.<br>
  Shrieks with bumps.<br>
  Shrieks plain.<br>
  Furniture ill-used.<br>
  Ghosts with large eyes.<br>
  Do. without heads.<br>
  Heads with nothing else.<br>
  Eyes unappropriated.<br>
  Demoniac laughter.<br>
  A smell of Sulphur.<br>
  Do. Brimstone (without treacle).</p><br>

  <p>All being, as you will perceive, phenomena of well established
  respectability and proved credence, as the learned are aware, from the
  writings of Cornelius Agrippa and Mr. Stead. There were other manifestations
  also, a little outside the limits of the regular schedule, though not so far
  from it as the strange light in the east wing. Thus it was testified by Mrs.
  Emma Skinner, a charwoman employed to clean the premises, that on shortly
  returning to a room where she had just completed her work, she found
  mysterious inscriptions scrawled with the points of ghostly fingers on
  windows, sideboards, mantelpiece, floor, walls&mdash;and in short wherever
  she had forgotten to dust, and that mocking laughter followed her as she fled
  in terror, the sounds intensifying to an appalling uproar, in the midst of
  which the horrified Emma believed she could distinguish her own Christian
  name, preceded by the exclamation "Whoa!" as though to call her back.
  Needless to say she did not pause in her flight, and arrived at last at the
  house of Mr. Benton, the agent for the property, breathless, and only so far
  capable of speech as to demand brandy and water and a week's pay in lieu of
  notice.</p>

  <p>As to the more regular phenomena there were scores of people who could
  testify to hearing noises, and dozens who had seen the ghosts; white ladies,
  misty old gentlemen in wigs and top-hoots, at least one white man in armor;
  and there were several shapes of animal form. Indeed the last appearance
  recorded, on the authority of Mr. Wilkins, dairyman and purveyor of milk in
  the adjoining village, was of this character.</p>

  <p>It appears that Mr. Wilkins, learning that Missel Hall was let at last,
  entered the grounds and approached the main door with the intention of
  leaving his business card on the step. Arrived on the spot, however, he found
  that the door had been left ajar, probably by the neglect of somebody who had
  been engaged in preparing the house for the reception of the new tenants. He
  entered, therefore, with the idea of leaving the card on a mantelpiece, where
  it would be more likely to attract notice.</p>

  <p>The evening was closing in, but it was not yet dusk. Mr. Wilkins was in a
  perfectly calm frame of mind, not in any way predisposed to hallucination,
  being intent, indeed, on the recent scandalous price of turnips. He entered
  the nearest room, deposited his card on the mantelpiece, and was turning to
  go, when his attention was arrested by three distinct raps apparently coming
  from the wall behind him. He turned quickly, and beheld what seemed to be a
  light vapor, or steam, rising in the form of a column in the darkest corner
  of the room. It rose and thickened till it attained the size, as he
  afterwards expressed it, of a sixteen-gallon churn. Then this misty column
  suddenly fell forward in his direction, causing him to back hurriedly to the
  door. For the next few minutes Mr. Wilkins wholly forgot the price of
  turnips, for his whole mind and emotions were engaged in the fearful
  contemplation of one of the strangest phenomena recorded in the history of
  the supernatural.</p>

  <p>The column fell forward, as I have said, and Mr. Wilkins gazed spellbound
  at the sight before him. For the misty body, a column no longer, continued to
  decrease in size, and to assume the general appearance of some bulky animal.
  Larger and still larger it grew, till it had surpassed the size of a sheep
  and even that of a calf, and the paralyzed beholder was aware, not only of
  indications of a tail, but of horns, and between the horns of a gradual
  growth of two distinct luminous points. With this last horror, the eyes, the
  spell was broken, and with a tearing effort Mr. Wilkins sprang through the
  doorway and ran, pursued by the monstrous phantom. He ventured to glance over
  his shoulder, however, as he reached the step of the outer door, and it
  seemed that already the spectre had begun to diminish in size. No longer did
  it seem of the bulk, and somewhat of the aspect, of a cow, but to be
  gradually resuming its former shape&mdash;a column.</p>

  <p>Somewhat recovering his courage, Mr. Wilkins continued to run across the
  drive, till another glance over his shoulder assured him that the apparition
  had ceased to pursue him, and was now standing stationary, and shrinking, on
  the terrace. Mr. Wilkins dodged behind a convenient shrub and turned at bay.
  Truly indeed the appearance was fast diminishing. The horrible eyes were
  gone, only one horn remained, and the body had shrunk to a mere erect column,
  the height of a man. But the tail hung unaltered, stiffly dependent behind.
  Still the change went on before Mr. Wilkins's astonished eyes, till, with a
  gasp of amazed recognition, he found himself gazing at a spectral pump.</p>

  <p>With that his courage returned, and he emerged from his concealment; for
  to a respectable dairyman, who sees to the cleanliness of his premises, no
  object is more familiar than a pump, and there is nothing in the world he is
  less afraid of. But as Mr. Wilkins advanced, extending his hand, by familiar
  habit, toward the pump-handle, so the ghostly object faded and thinned away
  to nothing, and Mr. Wilkins found himself standing alone, in the gathering
  gloom, before the door of the haunted house.</p>

  <p>Nothing more was observed till the new tenants were completely installed.
  The moving in was accompanied by many strange noises, however, and although
  noises are common enough, indeed unavoidable, in any house-moving, the noises
  heard on this occasion were altogether unusual. There were no rapipngs nor
  dragging of chairs, and there was not anywhere a suggestion of laughter,
  domoniac or otherwise; but everybody agreed that the shrieks were terrible
  and pitiful to hear.</p>

  <p>Fortunately the new tenants did not arrive till the disturbances had
  ceased; for Mr. Benton, the agent, with a courteous regard for their nerves
  pleasant to meet in these ungallant days, had refrained from mentioning the
  little drawbacks from which Missel Hall suffered, and as the Quilters came
  from London they had no other means of learning.</p>

  <p>The whole of the active Quilter family was female, consisting of a mother
  and five daughters. The remaining member was Mr. Quilter, an elderly and
  obese gentleman who slept between meals and was not observed to pursue any
  more exciting occupation. The ladies could not be called obese&mdash;unless
  you wished to be impolite to Mrs. Quilter&mdash;and they wore curious
  sack-shaped clothes. Their eyes were very earnest and their hair was not very
  long and not very short, but very touzly and very red. They decorated and
  furnished the house&mdash;filled it top and bottom, except for one little
  unconsidered room&mdash;with wonderful furniture and amazing wall-papers, all
  of a sort that I have heard called the product of the New Art. The chairs
  were made of square oak planks, with stencil-holes like fireworks in their
  backs. All the tables straddled their legs wide to snare the feet of the
  heedless. There was a sideboard with pewter rockets inlaid all over it, and a
  balloon of blue enamel at the summit of each rocket.</p>

  <p>The dining-room was papered with a cheerful pattern of green stag-beetles
  a foot long, with yellow legs, crawling perpendicularly up a rich crimson
  ground. The drawing-room, on the other hand, was of a bold yellow tint,
  dotted at wide intervals with very elegant brown cauliflowers, each with a
  graceful fringe of curly tentacles, like the legs of an octopus, reaching out
  to its neighbor. Curly tentacles, in fact, formed the chief motive of all the
  decoration&mdash;tentacles with flaccid curves like those of an expiring boa
  constrictor.</p>

  <p>The tentacles were everywhere. They drooped and crawled over a pewter
  clock with three bowed legs and a square face on the morning-room
  mantelpiece. They squirmed so thick on the lids of the silver toilet-boxes on
  the dressing-tables that I have seen nothing like it since I went fishing as
  a little boy, with worms in a canister. You found yourself unconsciously
  prancing on tip-toe across the wriggling carpet&mdash;instinctive survival of
  man's primeval repulsion from the serpent. The tentacles came at you round
  corners, threatened you from behind doors&mdash;wormed about on your
  dinner-plate. On any piece of furniture you might choose to handle you would
  find unexpected projections and surprising outworks, each with its curly
  tentacle, and probably a piece of inexplicable copper or pewter, with
  tentacles of its own. And through it all Mr. Quilter slept undisturbed, and
  his daughters played on a green oak piano with pewter pot-hooks and hangers
  lovingly inlaid all over it, and all was peace and New Art.</p>

  <p>And now, with the advent of the Quilter family, the whole supernatural
  history of Missel Hall culminated in the amazing spectacle of the Luminous
  Room. No more did mysterious noises and strange sights disturb the repose of
  the dwellers, but that strange pale light shone out from the high attic,
  otherwise empty, and declared the ghostly fame of Missel Hall to every
  watcher of the night.</p>

  <p>At first the Quilters&mdash;except Mr. Quilter, who was asleep&mdash;were
  seriously disturbed by the discovery; and ere long, as was natural, their
  anxious inquiries brought them information of the earlier history of their
  house. But days and nights went on and nothing occurred to justify their
  fears&mdash;there was nothing but that weird light in the empty attic, which
  gave them no inconvenience at all. So that soon they grew rather proud of the
  phenomenon, and brought their friends to see it. One or two bold spirits
  among these friends ventured into the luminous chamber by night; and the
  reports of each visit agreed precisely with the others. The strange light
  pervaded the whole room&mdash;all agreed on this point. It was like no light
  any witness had ever seen; persons standing in it were plainly enough visible
  to each other, but with a pallor and a certain dimness of outline that
  admitted but of one description: they looked like ghosts. Indeed it would
  seem as though the illumination did not consist of light, as human experience
  knows it, but rather of something which not only lighted persons and objects
  in the room but also <i>interposed</i> between them.</p>

  <p>Withal, it cast no shadow. This was, perhaps, its most remarkable quality.
  If one carried a candle into the room the objects it lighted cast their
  shadows in a natural way, though, of course, owing to the pervading
  luminousness the shadows were very feeble. But without any such artificial
  light no shadow was thrown, of anything, anywhere. The light, whatever it
  was, was all-pervading. And whatever it was it so affected the atmosphere
  that it was difficult to breathe therein.</p>

  <p>The Misses Quilter became ardent spiritualists. They brought expert
  friends from London, who arranged <i>sances</i> in the astonishingly
  furnished rooms, and accomplished nothing. The failure was unprecedented, and
  the experts were wholly at fault. Not a table would move, not a mark would
  appear on a slate&mdash;and that in this ancient haunt of spectres, Missel
  Hall! The science of spiritualism was shaken to its foundations.</p>

  <p>After much anxious consultation the experts resolved on a fresh expedient,
  and thereby made possible one of the most curious demonstrations recorded in
  the history of their craft. At the head of a small sheet of paper the
  question was written: <i>What causes the light in the east wing attic?</i>
  This paper, with a pencil, was enclosed in a small box, and the box was
  placed inside the lighted room and there left, with the door shut.</p>

  <p>At the end of ten minutes the box was withdrawn, and, the paper being
  examined, it was found to carry below the question the almost illegibly
  scrawled word: <i>Terror.</i></p>

  <p>A fresh paper was prepared with the amended question: <i>What is the
  light?</i></p>

  <p>By the same process, and after a similar interval, another reply was
  elicited. This time it read, somewhat ungrammatically: <i>Only us.
  Crowded</i> like&mdash;(remainder illegible).</p>

  <p>This reply caused much interest and excitement among the experts. A fresh
  question was prepared and answered, and others after that, as are transcribed
  below.</p>

  <p>Question.&mdash;<i>Do you mean you are the ghosts that haunt this
  house?</i></p>

  <p>Answer.&mdash;<i>Yes. We apologize. Take them away</i> (illegible words
  follow).</p>

  <p>Q.&mdash;<i>Please answer more clearly.</i></p>

  <p>A.&mdash;<i>Take them away. We are squashed into a mass and terrified to
  death. We really do apologize!</i></p>

  <p>Q. <i>For what do you apologize?</i></p>

  <p>A.&mdash;<i>Everything. Anything. Only take them away. We apologize for
  haunting this house and frightening people. We will never do it again; we
  have been frightened too much ourselves. We've all gone through a good deal,
  but never anything like this. We can't stand it. There's only this room left,
  and we are crowded solid. We dare not come out. It is terrible.</i></p>

  <p>Q.&mdash;<i>What terrifies you?</i></p>

  <p>A.&mdash;<i>All of it! Furniture! Snakes! Fireworks! Cauliflowers!
  Tentacles! Curlywigs! Jim-jams! Sacks and touzly wigs! Pray do something for
  us.</i></p>

  <p>Q.&mdash;<i>What must we do?</i></p>

  <p>A. (an almost undecipherable mass of ragged scrawls, apparently from many
  different hands in all sorts of directions on both sides of
  paper).&mdash;<i>Take them away...Benton...raise rent...Apologize...Never
  frighten people any more...Know what it is ourselves now...never expected
  this...Worse things than us...Help! Police...</i> (rest wholly illegible.</p>

  <p>These mysterious words are all the explanation extant of the amazing
  phenomenon of the Luminous Room. Answers to succeeding questions were wholly
  unreadable, and in the end the experts gave up their attempts to unravel the
  mystery.</p>

  <p>It is a fact, nevertheless, that since the Quilters have left Missel Hall
  (they have been gone six months now) the strange light has wholly disappeared
  from the attic and it has not been followed by any of the more ordinary
  terrors which preceded it; a fact that, it is said, will shortly be cited in
  a paper to be read before a spiritualistic congress and adduced as a proof
  that ghosts may be relied on to keep their promises, even when extorted under
  stress of deadly terror.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; MR. BOSTOCK'S BACK-SLIDING</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Tom Browne, R.I.</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Dec 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">IT is a terribly easy thing to fall into&mdash;imperceptibly
  to glide into&mdash;evil-doing; and once embarked on the slippery descent,
  there is no telling how low one may descend. This, the moral of the story of
  Mr. Bostock, is, in accordance with modern practice, placed at the beginning
  of the story instead of at the end, which our grandfathers considered the
  proper place. Nowadays we get the moral over and out of the way as soon as
  possible, and find it good riddance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock was a person of that peculiar stainlessness which is only to
  be observed in a London suburb of the highest respectability, always in
  association with the precisely correct clothes for every occasion, and a
  comfortable income derived somehow from the City. He was no longer young, nor
  slim, and his large, clean-shaven countenance carried the heavy
  portentousness noticeable in the Strictly Proper. Regularity, Propriety,
  Serene Importance&mdash;these words could be traced across his white
  waistcoat and his pink face as distinctly as though spelt in printed letters;
  and Severe Respectability shone like a halo from the high polish of his
  crown.</p>

  <p>Every admirer of the female sex&mdash;every discriminating person, in
  other words&mdash;will at once perceive that there was a Mrs. Bostock to whom
  much or all of this perfection was due; indeed, the ribald of his suburb
  ascribed Mr. Bostock's correctitude to simple terror of his wife. This was
  the slander of vulgar malice, of course, but it is a fact that Mrs. Bostock
  was a lady well fitted to inspire terror in the unregenerate; and those whom
  she regarded as her social inferiors&mdash;which meant very nearly
  everybody&mdash;had reason to quail before her overbearing majesty.</p>

  <p>Twenty-four years of training under Mrs. Bostock's severe eye had endowed
  Mr. Bostock with the shining qualities so vastly respected in his suburb, and
  of late her supervision had been reinforced by that of their two daughters,
  now grown up. It may be that it is not permitted to mere man to receive a
  greater share of this sort of blessing than can be conferred by an energetic
  wife and one full-grown daughter; that the gradual accession of assistance
  from another daughter, as she reaches womanhood, will overcome the fortitude
  of the most respectable. It is certain that Mr. Bostock's lapse occurred
  shortly after Julia, his second daughter&mdash;now arrived near marriageable
  age&mdash;had fully ranged herself by the side of her mamma and her sister in
  the direction of his comportment.</p>

  <p>The family were staying at the seaside at the proper period of late
  summer, and, of course, at the proper place. The town is already sufficiently
  well advertised, so here I shall call it Scarbourne, which is not in the
  least like its real name. Everybody will readily recognize it, however, from
  the circumstance that it is the most genteel town on the English coast, where
  every male visitor positively must change all his clothes at least three
  times a day, and no lady must be seen to wear anything twice. Also, the
  promenade is the one place for pedestrian exercise, and the vulgar act of
  walking on the beach is never condoned. No place on earth basks in a more
  sacred odor of perfect respectability than this blessed spot, with nothing to
  mar its bliss but the presence of a vulgar convict prison a few miles inland,
  and the fact that the aproach by railway lies through another seaside town of
  the most unpardonable description, where parents paddle on the sands among
  their children, and the air resounds to the banjo and tambourine of the
  nefarious nigger. It is said that the Scarbourne visitors barely forgave the
  King for the proximity of His Majesty's prison, and that only in
  consideration of his social position; but the railway company might beg
  forgiveness in vain for bringing their line through Beachpool-on-Sea.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock's temptation came insidiously yet suddenly, giving him little
  time for choice. There was some expectation that the office in the City,
  which provided the means for Mr. Bostock's respectability, might require his
  presence for a day or two in the midst of his vacation; and there was hourly
  expectation of a telegram from his head clerk to call him. Mr. Bostock was
  somewhat puzzled, almost shocked, to detect himself looking forward to the
  receipt of the telegram with something vastly like pleasurable anticipation;
  and with this begins the tale of his backsliding.</p>

  <p>A telegram <i>did</i> come, immediately after breakfast on a brilliant
  August morning. Mr. Bostock tore it open eagerly. It <i>was</i> from his
  chief clerk, indeed; but&mdash;it conveyed the news that the matter in
  question had been satisfactorily settled, and that Mr. Bostock's presence in
  London would not be required. Mr. Bostock sank back in his easy-chair in a
  frame of mind which he distinctly recognized as one of gloomy dejection.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bostock and her daughters were dressing for a morning drive in the
  jobbed carriage that conveyed them everywhere, except for the promenade walk;
  and as Mr. Bostock sat back with the telegram in his hand his wife appeared,
  patting and smoothing her gloves.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;that telegram <i>has</i> come, then," observed Mrs. Bostock.
  "Then we'll ask Mrs. Berkeley Wiggs to take your seat, and we'll drive out a
  little when I've done some shopping in the town. I suppose you'll catch the
  ten-thirteen?"</p>

  <p>Here was Mr. Bostock's temptation, and here began his fall. "Y&mdash;yes!"
  he stammered, hastily, crumpling up the telegram and stuffing it away in his
  pocket. "Yes! I'll&mdash;I'll catch the ten-thirteen, of course. Too late for
  the fast train, of course. Of course. Yes, my dear&mdash;I'll go off and
  catch the ten-thirteen. Don't bother about me&mdash;I'll walk, or have a cab.
  Yes&mdash;of course, I must catch the ten-thirteen!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic27"

  </div><br>

  <p>A very easy thing, the fall of Mr. Bostock. You will observe that
  <i>he</i> said nothing as to the contents of the telegram&mdash;not a word.
  Mrs. Bostock assumed that the message was the one expected, and her husband
  merely allowed her the assumption. Almost anybody might have done the same
  thing&mdash;accidentally, as it were. And, in fact, Mr. Bostock hardly
  realized what he <i>had</i> done till Mrs. Bostock had departed in search of
  Mrs. Berkeley Wiggs; the most recent accession to her acquaintance, and
  Socially Immense.</p>

  <p>Even when he did fully realize the position of affairs Mr. Bostock
  betrayed no symptom of remorse. His behavior, indeed, for the next hour or so
  diverged every minute farther and farther from the precedent set by
  twenty-four years of strict regularity. He took a cab to the railway station,
  and during the short ride his demeanor so changed that the startled cabman
  scarcely recognized his fare as he emerged. Mr. Bostock's hat had settled
  over at a jaunty angle, and Mr. Bostock's face had acquired a joyous, almost
  a waggish, expression. A shade of apprehension crossed it as he approached
  the booking-office window and glanced nervously about him. Then he plunged
  his head deep in at the little hole, and demanded his ticket in a voice
  inaudible from without. He took his seat in the ten-thirteen train, just as
  he said he would; but&mdash;and here you may begin the measure of Mr.
  Bostock's backsliding&mdash;he got out at Beachpool-on-Sea!</p>

  <p>Not without some nervousness and trepidation, it is true; for the habit of
  twenty-four years is hard to shake off. But once out in the High Street of
  Beachpool, Mr. Bostock's gradual expansion was a wonderful thing to see. He
  put his hands in his trousers pockets, he put his hat positively at the back
  of his head, and at the end of the street, by the sea, he bought a cane and
  swung it!</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock was taking a little holiday "on his own," as the vulgar say.
  How long he was going to stay, what arrangements he should make, and all the
  rest of it he had as yet thought nothing of. Here he was, free and
  irresponsible, at Beachpool, where nobody knew him, and ready for a holiday
  after twenty-four years' respectability. He went back to the shop where he
  bought the cane, and there bought a pipe and an ounce of tobacco. Mrs.
  Bostock had never allowed him to smoke anything less respectable than a cigar
  since they were married. Sometimes she had even bought the cigars herself.
  Perhaps I should not have mentioned this last circumstance, since it is far
  from my design to arouse sympathy for the perverted Bostock.</p>

  <p>As for him, he grew wilder at every step along the beach. For he walked
  along the sands here like any low tripper, and once he actually "skated" an
  oyster-shell along the water&mdash;not very well. Then he stopped to listen
  to a group of niggers, and even laughed&mdash;laughed aloud&mdash;at a song
  about a "missis" and a mother-in-law, and put twopence in the tambourine
  rathen than go away before it was finished. And as he went on among the
  children digging sand and their elders devouring fruit and buns, he burst
  into little gasps of laughter at nothing whatever, and was barely able to
  repress an insane desire to dance in public. The desire grew so urgent,
  indeed, that he walked straight on along the beach, past the last of the
  family groups, and into the solitude beyond. Here the cliffs began, and the
  shore was strewn with large stones, which presently gave place to
  boulders.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock was two miles from Beachpool, and absolutely alone with the
  cliffs, the boulders, and the sea. He took a cautious glance about him,
  laughed aloud twice, and burst into the most astonishing fandango ever
  executed by an elderly gentleman having no connection with the stage. Then he
  plucked the hat from his head, flung it at his feet, and kicked it over the
  nearest boulder. Mr. Bostock had utterly thrown off the mask!</p>

  <p><a id="pic28"

  </div><br>

  <p>He picked his hat up, however, with some solicitude, and sat on the
  boulder to restore its shape. Then he held it at arm's length and laughed at
  it, loud and long. No hat of Mr. Bostock's had endured such derision
  before.</p>

  <p>He clapped it on the side of his head, stuck his thumbs in the armholes of
  his waistcoat, and gazed out over the sea, chuckling. The great green water
  was beautiful and smooth and soft, and the day was warm. Mr. Bostock had not
  had a swim for years; Mrs. Bostock did not consider the exercise suitable to
  his dignity and his years, nor, indeed, the costume to his figure.</p>

  <p>He had no bathing costume now, but did that really matter? There was not a
  soul in sight, nor likely to be one. The nearest person at Beachpool was two
  miles off, and Scarbourne was quite seven miles away. There was the towel
  difficulty, of course; but Mr. Bostock had a mind above difficulties just
  now, and a towel was a trifle beneath his soaring notice. As a boy he had run
  about to get dry, and now he chanced to have two big, clean
  pocket-handkerchiefs. Mr. Bostock was tuned up for a wild adventure, and this
  was the wildest he could think of. He took one more look along the deserted
  shore and up at the silent cliffs, and began to pull off his clothes.</p>

  <p>There never was such a delightful swim as Mr. Bostock indulged in from
  that deserted shore. There were cool, transparent pools among the rocks that
  dotted the shore, and farther out there was just enough motion in the water
  to save monotony. The air was warm and the water of a pleasant coolness, for
  as yet the sun had not brought it to its full summer-day temperature. And all
  the while not a soul came in sight along the shore. From time to time Mr.
  Bostock glanced back to the solitary dark speck among the boulders which he
  knew to be his heap of clothes, and he saw it always quite safe.</p>

  <p>So time went, while Mr. Bostock, from time to time floating on his back
  and gazing thoughtfully into the blue of the sky above, revolved in his mind
  scandalous fraudulent plans for the future, whereby forged telegrams from the
  office should procure him more holidays like this. Thus does fancied impunity
  embolden the evil-doer.</p>

  <p>Still, delightful as that swim was, Mr. Bostock realized that he must come
  out of the water sooner or later, and at length he turned and headed for the
  shore, marking his course by the little dark spot where he had left his
  clothes. He came in slowly and easily, dreading no evil. The tide had risen a
  little, and he congratulated himself on getting in in time to save his
  clothes a possible wetting, a danger he had not considered, in the excitement
  of the adventure. He rose from the water's edge, grasped the boulder, took
  two tender steps on the shingle&mdash;and instantly rushed back into the sea
  and swam off as hard as he could go.</p>

  <p>In the whole course of his hitherto exemplary life Mr. Bostock had never
  had such a shock&mdash;such a horrible, stunning surprise. The clothes were
  not his!</p>

  <p>But this alone was a comparative trifle. For what had sent Mr. Bostock
  staggering back as from the charge of a bull, what had propelled him headlong
  into the sea and set him swimming as though the bull had turned into a shark,
  was the appalling fact that he had found himself confronted with a heap of
  <i>female</i> garments!</p>

  <p>There seemed to be no possible mistake. It was a black, rusty-looking
  heap, with a rather disorganized bonnet and a pair of cloth-topped boots of
  the sort called "jemimas," down at heel, bulgy at the toes, and very loose
  and frilly about the elastic sides. It seemed, in short, the outfit of the
  sort of elderly female for whom the only word is "geezer."</p>

  <p>A little way out from the shore Mr. Bostock ventured to turn about and
  tread water. Surely that <i>was</i> the boulder on which he had left his
  clothes? They had been quite visible from the sea, as he distinctly
  remembered, and now the only heap of clothes in sight was the heap he had
  just fled from, lying precisely in the same spot. There was not a soul in
  sight, nor any human belonging except that heap of clothes on the boulder.
  Nobody was visible on the water, nobody on the shore. Mr. Bostock swam in a
  little way, till he could stand on the sandy bottom, with his head and
  shoulders above water, and then, remembering the expedient of Mr. Pickwick in
  the wrong bedroom at Ipswich, called out very loudly, "Ha&mdash;hum!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock waited for an answer, but heard nothing but the sea, and saw
  nothing but that and the shore and the dark heap of clothes before him.</p>

  <p>There was certainly not another pile of clothes anywhere in sight, and Mr.
  Bostock, his first fright over, began to grow very anxious. He walked a step
  or two farther in and called again, this time very loudly indeed,
  "Ha&mdash;hum!" And then, when no sound answered him, he
  proceeded&mdash;"Anybody there?"</p>

  <p>Nobody was there, it would seem, so presently, Mr. Bostock, staring wildly
  and anxiously in all directions, crept out of the water again. Was it
  possible that his eyes had deceived him?</p>

  <p>No; the clothes were exactly what he had taken them to be, and no others
  were in sight. He snatched hastily at a grubby old plaid shawl that crowned
  the heap, and, wrapping it about him, began to explore the beach.</p>

  <p>It was all useless. Nobody was near him, and not a scrap of his own
  clothing was to be seen. Mr. Bostock's mind did not work with great rapidity,
  but now that he had got dry by his boyhood's method of running about the
  beach, with some assistance from the grubby plaid shawl, he realized that he
  was faced by the dreadful prospect of returning to civilization disguised as
  a "geezer."</p>

  <p>He lifted the shabby garments gingerly, and shuddered. They had that
  peculiar gritty griminess that makes any sensitive person shudder, and they
  smelt damp, like a rag-shop. Mr. Bostock shrank and groaned, but there was no
  help for it. With an infinitude of shivers and squirms he began to put them
  on.</p>

  <p>He felt about the skirt for pockets, and grew conscious of a new terror.
  There <i>was</i> a pocket&mdash;a torn, clammy bag dangling by one
  corner&mdash;and it was empty! In the pockets of Mr. Bostock's vanished suit
  were nearly ten pounds in gold and silver, a pocket-book with several notes
  in it, a gold watch and chain, and some other valuables, to say nothing of
  his railway-ticket. He broke into a cold sweat. Not only must he go among his
  fellow-creatures as a "geezer," but as a "geezer" absolutely penniless!</p>

  <p>The prospect was more terrible than anything Mr. Bostock had imagined in
  his life. He broke into a fit of savage indignation at the callous depravity
  of the wretched female who had stolen his clothes, and must now be
  masquerading in them as a man&mdash;in itself a scandalous offence against
  the law. And at that reflection Mr. Bostock's distress became, if possible,
  still more acute. For it struck him that he too, arrayed in the horrible
  clothes he was struggling with, would be committing the same scandalous
  offence, and liable to the same penalty!</p>

  <p>At length the dismal toilet was complete, and Mr. Bostock, miserable
  enough, but ignorant even now of the amazing figure he was making by reason
  of his unskilful management of the unaccustomed garments, addressed himself
  to the next step. Beachpool was two miles in one direction, Scarbourne more
  than seven the other way. Pulling nervously at the strings of the battered
  bonnet, which all too scantily covered his lack of tresses, he turned first
  one way and then the other. Which way should he go?</p>

  <p>The rising tide answered the question for him.</p>

  <p>Long before he could traverse the seven rocky miles under the cliffs he
  would be caught by the tide; so perforce he turned back to Beach-pool. He did
  it with some vague sense of relief, too, for he had not yet invented a means
  of dodging Mrs. Bostock. He did not even know where she might be encountered.
  The capture of Mrs. Berkeley Wiggs had been the object of some ambition, and
  now that it was effected, Mrs. Bostock would probably keep her as long as
  possible&mdash;for a drive inland&mdash;to lunch&mdash;anything convenient.
  But even supposing Mrs. Bostock safely out of the way, how could her wretched
  husband possibly enter the select boarding establishment undetected in the
  guise of a "geezer?"</p>

  <p>The way to Beachpool was filled with perplexity, and Mr. Bostock grew
  desperate as he went. What could he do? Whose help could he ask? Who would
  lend money to an apparently and obviously disreputable old woman, who told a
  cock-and-bull tale of being a gentleman of substance, much respected in the
  City, in need of a little temporary assistance? The very best he could hope
  for from such a course was that inquiries would be made, which was the last
  thing he wanted; for, in his mind's eye, he saw the terrible figure of Mrs.
  Bostock, stern, suspicious, and incredulous, standing at the other end of
  those inquiries. But it would be far more likely that he would be given in
  charge of the police straightway.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock was convinced that to beg would not only be difficult, but
  useless; and in his dire extremity he began to consider the possibility of
  stealing&mdash;of stealing clothes, money, anything that would get him out of
  this horrible mess. So low had the principles of the hitherto blameless Mr.
  Bostock been brought in the course of a mere hour or two from his tiny,
  almost involuntary, departure from the path of rectitude. (Refer to moral,
  <i>ut supra.)</i></p>

  <p>As a man of business it had, of course, occurred to him to wire to his
  office for a telegraphic money-order, to be sent to the nearest post-office.
  But, as a man of business also, he remembered that any person applying for
  the money must produce complete proof of his identity. Proof of his identity
  in this amazing rig! But, to begin with, the telegram to the office must cost
  at least sixpence. And where was the sixpence?</p>

  <p>And so Mr. Bostock crept into Beachpool in a very different state of mind
  from that in which he had left it; meditating theft. He was ready to steal
  the pennies from a blind man's hat. Indeed, he would have preferred that
  proverbial form of larceny before any other, from its comparative safety and
  simplicity; but blind men have far too little in their hats.</p>

  <p>He slunk about the back streets, sweating with terror at the notice he was
  attracting. It was only because of his clean-shaven face that he had dared to
  come into the town at all, and now he began to wish himself back on the empty
  beach. But something must be done, and desperation forced him far beyond his
  natural courage, which was not very great. He found himself in a street
  leading directly into the High Street, and straight before him in the High.
  Street was a cheap tailor's, where dummy figures, labelled "This style,
  thirty shillings," stood by the door.</p>

  <p>No peri ever gazed at the portals of Paradise with half the ardent longing
  with which Mr. Bostock stared at the door of that cheap tailor's shop. Very
  gladly would he have given a cheque for fifty pounds for one of those shoddy
  suits and a ticket to London. He had no chequebook, and if he had, what would
  any sane tailor think of such a proposition from a disreputable-looking old
  woman?</p>

  <p>But the shop, with its possible salvation, attracted him. Perhaps he
  <i>might</i> make an arrangement with the tailor. He drew nearer, eyeing the
  dummies at the door with an affectionate interest which might well have
  aroused the notice of any observer, and, in fact, did attract the atteniton
  of the shopkeeper, lurking like a spider in the recesses of his shop. Even in
  his present excitement, Mr. Bostock was sane enough to see the impossibility
  of either stealing a suit off a dummy, or eloping with the dummy complete,
  clothes and all, under his arm. But as he neared the doorway he could not
  resist the impulse to extend his hand to the coveted garments; and at that
  moment the shopkeeper appeared.</p>

  <p>He was a shiny, stout, frock-coated Jew, and he said, very peremptorily:
  "Here, vat you vant? Out o' dis here!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock thrust all his resolution into his voice; it was a rather
  large, round, rolling voice, very impressive from a confident middle-aged
  gentleman in the right clothes, but startlingly out of character with his
  present outfit.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;wish to see you privately on a matter of business," said
  Mr. Bostock.</p>

  <p><a id="pic29"
     name="pic29"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Ah, I dessey," replied the shopkeeper; "ve got nodden to give avay here.
  Hook it, misses; sharp!"</p>

  <p>"But I assure you&mdash;if you will only listen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Got no dime to stand talkin' mit you. If you <i>von't</i> go&mdash;then
  <i>pht!</i> B'leesman!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock had not noticed that two policemen were inspecting him with
  some curiosity from the nearest corner. Now he saw them with a sudden twinge
  of alarm, and straightway began a hurried retreat across the road.</p>

  <p>"Hi! You there! Here&mdash;come here!" cried one of the policemen,
  starting smartly after him.</p>

  <p>At that Mr. Bostock lost all hold of his wits, and, snatching up his
  skirts in both hands, ran madly up the street he had come by, followed by
  both the policemen and the beginnings of a joyful crowd.</p>

  <p><a id="pic30"

  </div><br>

  <p>With no more thought of disguise, no more plans or schemes, nothing but a
  frantic desire to get away, anywhere, anyhow, Mr. Bostock scampered up one
  narrow street and down another, with a gathering hunt behind him. The bonnet
  dangled over his shoulders by the strings round his neck, and the bulgy
  "jemimas" threatened to fly off his feet as he ran. Blind instinct taught him
  to turn each corner as he came to it, and so keep out of view of his pursuers
  as much as possible; and fortunately his way led him through the old town,
  where the fishermen's alleys favored his flight. But Mr. Bostock was a poor
  runner, and it was the mere spur of terror that kept him ahead. He caught at
  a post and swung into a street leading down to the sea, and as he did it he
  met a gust of wind that took the bonnet clean away up the street behind him.
  There was an alley to the right, and into that he plunged, bonnetless and
  somewhat bald; and farther still, growing slower and more "blown" as he went,
  till he emerged at the back of a row of unfinished houses in the outskirts of
  the town. And here he trod on a brickbat, which twisted the "jemima" sideways
  on his foot and flung him headlong.</p>

  <p>He could run no more. His little remaining breath was clean knocked out of
  him, and he lay where he fell, beaten and done for. But presently, as the
  first shock of the fall wore off, he became aware that the noise of pursuit
  had ceased, and that, as a fact, he was alone behind the unfinished houses,
  and comparatively safe. The lost bonnet had saved him, for the hunters
  naturally kept on up the street along which they found the thing bowling, and
  so off on the wrong track.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock climbed painfully to his feet, and crawled, panting, behind a
  broken fence. Why he had been chased with such persistence he could not
  divine, but, at any rate, it was clear that he must get out of Beachpool with
  no more delay. He put the plaid shawl over his head, and made shift to pull
  the rest of his dress into some sort of order. Then he started out, with much
  timid reconnoitring to tramp to Scar-bourne by road.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to be done. He must approach the back way to the
  select boarding establishment, and take one of the servants, who might
  recognize him, into his confidence. He would promise anything&mdash;a
  sovereign, five pounds, whatever the girl asked&mdash;to be smuggled in
  during the absence of his family. It was a difficult expedient, but the only
  one. And with this last resort in view Mr. Bostock began his nine miles'
  tramp.</p>

  <p>He went with the greatest caution till he was well clear of Beachpool, and
  even then only ventured to walk his best&mdash;which was not very good, for
  he was mightily tired already&mdash;when nobody was in sight. Twice he
  stopped to extract small pebbles from the "jemimas," which had cracks
  convenient for their admission; and then, as he approached the confines of a
  village, he stopped for a more peremptory reason still. For there was a
  bounce from the hedge behind him, a pair of stalwart arms clasped him round,
  and a loud voice shouted by his ear: "Here he be, sergeant! I got him!
  Sergeant!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic31"
     name="pic31"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"

  </div><br>

  <p>Struggles were unavailing, for the arms clipped him firmly just above the
  elbow, and the affrighted Mr. Bostock perceived that they were encased in
  blue sleeves, with an armlet; at the same moment a hatless policeman came
  running from a cottage by the wayside and seized him in front.</p>

  <p>"Get the handcuffs, sergeant! He be a desprit char'cter!" bawled the voice
  in the captive's ear.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;we won't stand to none of his despritness here," replied
  the sergeant, dexterously seizing Mr. Bostock by the wrist and collar. "Come
  along, you!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I've had my clothes stolen!" gasped Mr. Bostock.</p>

  <p>"Had yer&mdash;ha! ha! That's a good 'un," cried the sergeant. "Had his
  clothes stole!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" echoed the other captor, catching Mr. Bostock's other arm; "that
  be a moighty good 'un, sergeant!"</p>

  <p>"But I have, I tell you!" desperately wailed the victim.</p>

  <p>"All right, me fine feller," grimly responded the sergeant; "you needn't
  make a song about them clothes. 'We've got 'em 'ere for ye all right. Come
  along!"</p>

  <p>A flash of perplexed hope confused Mr. Bostock's faculties, and then, as
  he was led toward the cottage, a slatternly old woman appeared at the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" cried the old woman shrilly, "that's the blaggard right enough.
  That's my shawl over his 'ed! An' my other frock! An' my boots! An'&mdash;an'
  what ha' ye done with my bonnet, you low thief? Sergeant, he's been an' sold
  my best bonnet!"</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Mr. Bostock. "Are these things yours?"</p>

  <p>"Course they are, impidence! Comin' into people's 'ouses a-night an'
  stealin' wittles, an'&mdash;''</p>

  <p>"Then I give that woman in charge!" interrupted Mr. Bostock. "She's stolen
  my clothes, and ten pounds, and a pocket-book, and my watch and chain!"</p>

  <p>At this the old woman spluttered with rage, and the two policemen guffawed
  aloud. "You're a gay 'un, you are! There ain't no watch-pocket in <i>them</i>
  clothes! You shall have 'em, my boy&mdash;we're a-goin' to put 'em on ye
  afore we take ye back. Here y'are!"</p>

  <p>With these words Mr. Bostock was forced in at the door of the cottage, and
  so to a room at the back.</p>

  <p>"Here's yer clothes, my hearty," proceeded the sergeant; "and precious
  glad you'll be to get into 'em again, I don't think. Come along!"</p>

  <p>With that he shut the door behind them, and presented to Mr. Bostock's
  astounded eyes&mdash;a suit of drabbish yellow, decorated with black "broad
  arrows!" Nothing but the uniform of the convict prison!</p>

  <p>Mr. Bostock stared wildly. Was this some frenzied nightmare, or was he
  really stark mad?</p>

  <p>He gabbled incoherently. "No, no&mdash;stole my
  clothes&mdash;bathing&mdash;not them&mdash;name of Bostock&mdash;refer to my
  bankers&mdash;no&mdash;it's all a mistake!" And then he stopped, with open
  mouth, as the state of the case dawned on him slowly.</p>

  <p>Some wretched convict had escaped and left these things. He had entered
  the cottage in the night for food, had gone off disguised in the only clothes
  he could find, and had wandered, hiding in lonely paces, till he had reached
  the sea-shore. And then he had made another change, at Mr. Bostock's
  expense!</p>

  <p>And, indeed, that was exactly what had happened. And the curiosity of the
  police at Beachpool, the chase, and now the final capture&mdash;all were due
  to that invaluable invention, the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Come along&mdash;into 'em!" urged the sergeant, with the horrible clothes
  in his hand. "You was precious anxious about 'em just now. Or shall we shove
  'em on for ye?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, I tell you&mdash;it's a mistake. Take me to Scarbourne&mdash;no,
  wire to Cornhill! I'll give you five pounds&mdash;ten&mdash;fifty!" Poor Mr.
  Bostock struggled to his feet and feebly made for the door.</p>

  <p>The succeeding quarter of an hour is too painful for description. But at
  its expiration Mr. Bostock was led forth in convict garb&mdash;it was very
  tight, but in the flush of their triumph the village police force of two
  suspected nothing from that&mdash;and pushed into a light cart with a fast
  horse, in presence of the whole population of the village. All that his
  struggle had gained for him was the distinction and interest, in the popular
  eye, of being very firmly handcuffed.</p>

  <p><a id="pic32"
     name="pic32"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403411h-images/GreenGinger11-6.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The horse was whipped up and the village was left behind, which at any
  rate was some relief. Twenty minutes' smart drive brought the party within
  distant sight of Scarbourne, and within very near sight of an open carriage,
  which they rapidly overtook. Mr. Bostock's disorganized faculties were barely
  beginning to rearrange themselves, but he <i>did</i> recognize that carriage,
  and the people in it. With a gasp he slid off the seat, to hide himself in
  the bottom of the cart.</p>

  <p>"Hold up!" exhorted the constable, hauling at his arm. "Sergeant! he's
  tryin' to hide from them ladies in the carriage! P'r'aps he's had somethink
  o' theirs!"</p>

  <p>The sergeant gazed down on the cowering form, and then gave the horse an
  extra flick. "P'r'aps he has," he said. "We'll ask 'em."</p>

  <p>And thus it came about that Mr. Bostock, grimy, bruised, handcuffed, and
  bedizened with broad-arrows, was hauled up from the bottom of the cart and
  presented for identification to the horrified gaze of Mrs. Bostock, Miss
  Bostock, Miss Julia Bostock, Mrs. Berkeley Wiggs, and the coachman on the
  box.</p>

  <p>After that nothing mattered. The handsome apologies of the prison governor
  were a mockery, for Mr. Bostock would have preferred to stay with him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF HADDOCK</h2>

  <p class="first">ROBOSHOBERY DOVE hauled at the twist-knotted cord by his
  side till his enormous silver watch emerged from its fob. According to
  immemorial ritual he banged the long-suffering timepice three times edgewise
  on the socket of his wooden leg, clapped it to his ear, and finally looked at
  the face, comparing it with that of the old sun-dial over the church door
  behind us.</p>

  <p>"'Taren't to be judged the sun's nigh two hours out, so 'tis like it may
  be the watch," he said. "An' none so much out, nayther, considerin'. 'Tis a
  wunnerful good watch for all its an oad 'un."</p>

  <p>"Your father's, wasn't it?" I asked, indolently.</p>

  <p>"My father gave fi' pun' for that watch, sir, at foulness, before eighteen
  hundred." for this conversation took place a good many years ago, when I was
  a very young person and Roboshobery Dove was not so many years short of
  ninety, tough old fellow as he was. "He gave fi' pun' for it of a man whose
  father had been a genelman once."</p>

  <p>We were sitting on the tombstone before the church door; the tombstone
  that had served so many purposes since it had ceased, by reason of
  illegibility, to keep its charge as a memorial. For it was scored and worn by
  scythe-blades, it made a convenient waiting-place opposite the church door
  and the dial, and, if you turned your back on the church, as we had done, you
  looked out upon what always seemed to me the most wonderful view on earth;
  over the tumbling roofs of the little town below and so across the five
  miles' width of sea that makes the outer gate of the Thames. It was said that
  the level stone had had other uses too; it had been found adapted to certain
  profane games, in which buttons and halfpennies had their parts; but that was
  in the old days, before people were all good.</p>

  <p>"Ay," repeated Roboshobery Dove, "his father had been a genelman once, an'
  his father before him, in foulness, like others I could tell."</p>

  <p>"The Doves, eh?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That I won't say, sir, though true 'tis I was christened after
  Roboshohery Dove as fit for King Charles agin Crom'ell. ''Tis arl a
  possibility,' says the parson to my father, 'that you be descendants, an'
  'tis a fine handsome name.' An' so he christened me. That were Master
  Ellwood. He were a parson o' th' oad sort, were he. Wore silver buckles to
  his breeches, an' slep' in his wig; an' his walkin' stick were five foot
  long."</p>

  <p>I had heard Roboshobery so describe Parson Ellwood more than once before;
  and experience told me that the old seaman was groping his mind for a story.
  So I waited.</p>

  <p>"Speakin' o' oad families come down, an' likewise speakin' o' Crom'ell,"
  he said at length, "folk'll tell 'ee mostly, when things is broke in a
  church, as 'twere Crom'ell's sogers did it. Leastways that's what ye hear in
  these parts. But 'taren't so&mdash;not allus. You know the Haddock monument
  in the church, with the head off? Well I count they'll lay that to Crom'ell's
  sogers, but 'tweren't. I knew the oad soger as did that, an' he were none o'
  Crom'ell's; far from a soger at all, sarten to say. I'll tell 'ee his
  courtin' tale, if you like."</p>

  <p>"A courting tale? That's new. You never told me one of your own."</p>

  <p>Roboshobery Dove closed one bright blue eye for a full quarter of a
  minute. "Bin a bacheldor all my life," he said. Then he opened the closed eye
  and shut the other.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"The Haddock as that monument was to," Dove proceeded, "was him as built
  the almshouses. It were a big family once&mdash;admirals an' knights an' what
  not: but the one as left the alms-houses were nayther, though a rich man,
  'tis doubtless. I dunno how many years 'tis since they were rich, but I count
  it's hundreds; an' now there's none on 'em, rich or poor." So much I had
  myself read in the county history, where the family, once the greatest in
  these parts, was noted as extinct.</p>

  <p>"There's no more of 'em," the old man pursued, "an' I knowed the last. He
  were a long way from knight or admiral, or even rich man, though he were a
  bit of a miser in his way. Jim Haddock were his name&mdash;oad Jim Haddock,
  as mostly called&mdash;an' he got his livin' one way an' another with a bit
  o' field-work here an' there an' a bit o' higglin' in between, him keepin'
  fowls. His father before him had been a hedger, and his gran'father too, like
  as not; but oad Jim couldn't forget as the family had been gentry once, an'
  he didn't let nobody else forget it, nayther. The taproom weren't good enough
  for he; he'd sit in the parlor o' the Ship here, or the Castle, up at
  Hadleigh, an' wait to be asked to drink. If nobody offered him rum, he'd take
  sixpenny ale&mdash;nothin' lower. An' he'd sniff over the pot an' screw his
  mouth, like as 'twere an insult he were swallerin'.</p>

  <p>"''Tis a wicked thing to think on,' he'd say, 'me here drinkin' six-ale as
  was born by rights to be drunk on port wine every night o' my life, like any
  other genelman. Ah well! Human greatness be a passin' show!' But he'd go on
  a-sniffin' an' drinkin' the sixpenny just as long as you'd go on payin' for
  it, an' longer. An' the next man 'ud hear a deal of his mighty grievance agin
  you, because 'tweren't better drink.</p>

  <p>"When he sold ten eggs once an' got threepence for 'em, same as any other
  man was glad to get in them days, he went half round the parish with the
  money in his open hand before him, callin' the world to witness his hainish
  afflictions, whereby he'd a-bin give only three dirty coppers for ten eggs,
  like any common feller. He would ha' gone all round 'stead of half, but the
  half-way came down on Leigh Strand there, an' a chap three sheets in the wind
  fetches him a lift under the hand with a boat-stretcher as sent the coppers
  flyin' across the quay, an' he never found more'n one of 'em.</p>

  <p>"He never complained in that exact way afterwards, but he complained just
  as much. He got back that twopence an' a deal more, one way an' another. He
  used to forget to give change whenever you'd let him, an' talk wide an' noble
  about the word of a genelman if you tried to putt it right. His idea of a
  share in a harvestin' job was to draw summat on account, an' then sit on a
  beer-barr'l an' tell the master how the work ote to be done, very
  condescendin'.</p>

  <p>"But the wust of all his troubles, the most hainish grievance oad Jim
  Haddock ever had, were the alms-houses. It grieved him sick to see a bit o'
  freehold ground an' twelve cottages as had belonged to some great gran'
  father of his, about ten times removed, bein' lived in by other parties, an'
  him a-looking on an' gettin' nothen' out on't. He thote over it an' he
  grieved over it, an' he thote over it again, till at last he went to the
  rector. 'Twere the rector and churchwardens, you understand, as had the
  management of the alms-houses, by will of oad Jerry Haddock. 'Twere a huntin'
  day when oad Jim went to the rectory, an' the rector were waitin' for his
  hoss to be brote round, an' gettin' impatient.</p>

  <p>"'Good-morning sir,' says oad Jim. 'I been a-thinkin' over the matter o'
  them almshouses.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, you have, have you?' says the rector, cockin' his eye.</p>

  <p>"'I have,' says oad Jim, very firm an' decided. 'I've been a-considerin'
  the matter very deep. It seems to me as how my fam'ly has been out o' that
  there property long enough. I don't want to be hard on nobody, but the
  circumstances o' the fam'ly ain't what they was! so I'm compelled to give
  notice. I'll thank 'ee to clear out all them oad parties, parson, by quarter
  day.'</p>

  <p>"What the rector said ain't quite sarten. I've heard different accounts,
  an' none of 'em ain't what you might expect from a parson, these here days.
  But that rector were one o' th' oad sort, an' anyhow what he did <i>is</i>
  sarten. He took oad Jim by the scruff o' the neck an' he runned him out o'
  the rectory garden that fast that he den't stop till he hit up agen this here
  churchyard fence.</p>

  <p>"Oad Jim Haddock took it bitter unkind o' the parson, an' complained most
  touchin' to everybody as 'ud listen. 'Tweren't the way for one genelman to
  treat another, he said; the proper way, when two genelmen couldn't agree on a
  matter o' business, was to split the difference; an' he'd a been very well
  satisfied with half the alms-houses.</p>

  <p>"Well, he went on complainin' very woeful; but seein' he couldn't do no
  better he settled with hisself at last to get one o' the houses in the
  reg'lar way. You know what it says&mdash;it's up in the church&mdash;about
  the alms-houses bein' for decayed parishioners, men an' women, married an'
  single. Well, oad Jim were pretty sound an' able for work, an' not quite what
  you might look for in an alms-house, but he reckoned his fam'ly claims 'ud
  get over that. The houses were allus full, but there were one poor oad chap
  named Styles in one, about eighty-five, with a stroke down one side an' a
  cough that joggled him to bits, an' oad Jim counted his house as good as
  took, in a month or two. He went in, most wonnerful affectionate, every day,
  to see how poor oad Styles were a-gettin' on, an' to slap him very hard on
  the back when he coughed, an' tell him how much wuss he was a-lookin'.</p>

  <p>"Oad Styles lasted about a month longer than Jim expected, but he went
  arter all, an' then there was another disappointment, for instead o' oad Jim
  they putt a widder into the house. Not so partic'lar oad a widder, neither;
  but she'd had two husbands, an 'tis like they counted she wouldn't easy get a
  third. But anyhow oad Jim Haddock went half-cracked. He said a mort of
  unrespectful things about oad Jerry Haddock wasting the family substance in
  riotous almshouses, an' then he went to the rector again. The rector den't
  run him out this time; oad Jim runned hisself when the parson grabbed his
  walkin'-stick. So when he found it was no good tryin' that way, he set out to
  see the widder herself.</p>

  <p>"'Good-morning, Mrs. Bartrip,' say he, sniffin' an' snuffin' an' screwin'
  his nose. 'Umf! umf! Be you decayed?'</p>

  <p><i>"'What?'</i> says the widder, lookin' very hard at him.</p>

  <p>"'I were only makin' inquiration,' says he, a bit milder. 'The rules o'
  the will says decayed parishioners, an' I felt a bit anxious about 'ee. If so
  be you ben't decayed I doubt the parson 'll be after turnin' 'ee out. He be
  terr'ble strict, the parson. An' the churchwardens too. 'Tis a very serious
  punishment, by Parliament act, for livin' here if you ben't decayed. But
  there&mdash;I make no doubt you be 'cordin' to rules, Mrs. Bartrip.'</p>

  <p>"'I be 'cordin' enough to rules to stay where I am,' says the widder.</p>

  <p>"'Ah, no doubt,' says oad Jim. 'The pity is 'tis knowed all over the
  parish. Can't help it, ye see, livin' here, 'cordin' to rules. Though 'tain't
  what a party 'ud like knowed an' talked about. Still, no doubt 'tis what
  parties come to, gettin' so far on in years.'</p>

  <p>"'Is't, indeed?' says the widder, liftin' her chin.</p>

  <p>"'Ah, they do. Not that there's anythin' to be ashamed of in a few years
  more or less, for a sensible woman. When you get to sixty, ten years here or
  there don't make much difference.'</p>

  <p>"'What do I know about sixty?' says the widder.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, I'm not tryin' to bind ye to sixty, Mrs. Bartrip; far from it. Sixty
  or seventy makes nothen', as I said, an' some decays later'n others. Poor oad
  Styles, now, he were late. Some thote 'twere the house bein' unhealthy; an'
  sarten to say he were terr'ble bad toward the end. But he lasted fair well,
  did poor oad Styles. He were over two year here, an' I count ye might last
  quite as long as that, if the house don't get no damper. An' that wouldn't
  seem easy possible, 'tis sarten.'</p>

  <p>"'Ah!' says Mrs. Bartrip, 'a damp house suits me wonnerful; allus
  did.'</p>

  <p>"Well, all was for nothen'. Mrs. Bartrip wouldn't move for pride, nor for
  wish to be thote young, nor for damp. So oad Jim waited a month an' tried her
  with ghosts.</p>

  <p>"'Good-mornin', Mrs. Bartrip,' says he. 'I wondered if you mightn't be
  ill, seein' a light in your keepin' room so late last night.'</p>

  <p>"'Light in my keepin' room?' says the widder. 'Why, I weren't up after
  dark.'</p>

  <p>"'Indeed, mum? Then it must ha' been oad Styles agen. I've seed him about
  the garden two or three nights, but I den't think best to say nothen', you
  bein' a lone woman an' like as not nervous o' ghosts; I never guessed he'd
  ha' gone indoors.'</p>

  <p>"'I wouldn't ha' guessed it either,' says the widder.</p>

  <p>"'But 'tis allus that way with them almshouses,' says oad Jim. 'The oad
  parties do cling to 'em wonnerful.'</p>

  <p>"'Don't blame 'em,' says the widder.</p>

  <p>"'It's allus been the way, mum. Allus the way in that row o' houses. If
  the property had still been in the family I'd ha' had it attended to long
  ago, along with the plaster. But as it is, there's oad Styles a-walking the
  house all silent every night.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, that's fust-rate,' says the widder. 'I allus did like a ghost in
  the house, specially a silent one. It's company, an' it don't tell no
  lies.'</p>

  <p>"Anybody but oad Jim would ha' give up the job after that. But he never
  give up nothen' he could hoad on to, an' fore long he were round at the
  widder's again. This time he didn't try to drive her out. He saw that weren't
  to be done, so he split the difference (like a gentleman) an tried to get in
  without. He never brought up a word o' what had been said before, 'cept that
  the widder liked company; an' as company he recommended hisself very strong,
  to say nothen' of protection from ghosts. An' the end of it was they were
  married.</p>

  <p>"The parson laughed half an hour by the clock when they went to put up the
  banns, an' he congratulated oad Jim Haddock on enterin' into the ancestrial
  property at last. As to the weddin' there never was no sich fanteeg in all
  these parts. You wouldn't ha' believed there was half as many tin pots in
  Essex. The parson he set 'em a weddin' breakfast on his own lawn, an' had all
  the rest o' the alms-house people to help eat it. All that day they was
  squire an' lady, an' oad Jim Haddock was such a swell he might ha' fancied
  hisself his own great-gran'father ten times back.</p>

  <p>"But next mornin' he were seen choppin' firewood very early, which wasn't
  like his reg'lar habits. What had been said or done to cause it nobody knew,
  but 'twas whispered what happened when Madam Haddock showed herself at
  last.</p>

  <p>"'Husband,' says she, sittin' easy in th' armchair, 'I be a decayed oad
  'ooman. Wash down that doorstep.'</p>

  <p>"Oad Jim made fare to objeck, but she grabbed the broom that sudden he
  changed his mind. An' there began a little crowd by the door to see oad Jim
  a-cleanin' a doorstep; an' the crowd growed an' growed for half an hour
  before Mrs. Haddock were quite satisfied with the job.</p>

  <p>"Then says she, sittin' easy as ever in the arm-chair: 'I be an oad' ooman
  o' seventy, or mayhap eighty, ten years more or less not matterin'; so I need
  plenty o' rest. Peel you them taters for dinner."</p>

  <p>"She lied the broom across her knee, handy-like, an' oad Jim went an' did
  what she bid. 'Twere guessed as he'd tasted of that broom earlier in the
  mornin', 'fore he chopped the firewood. So he peeled the taters an' putt 'em
  in the pot, an' the bacon with 'em like as ordered.</p>

  <p>"Then says she: 'I be such a worn-out oad 'ooman, an' this here house be
  that damp an' unwholesome I ain't done no washin' since fust the banns was
  putt up. Start up the copper-fire an' go to washin' the' linen.'</p>

  <p>"So she began with him an' so she went on, till poor oad Jim Haddock
  wished he'd never been born a genelman at all. She sat all day in the
  easy-chair an' never let go the broom, 'cept she made him sweep with it. He
  scrubbed an' cooked an' washed an' mended an' got nothin' by it but
  chin-music an' broomstick, turn about. An' that weren't all nayther. He had
  to work outdoor as well as in. She druv him out with his eggs an' fowls, an'
  she saw she got the money too, every farden; an' 'tween whiles she found him
  odd jobs round about, an' drawed his wages herself. Poor oad Jim was clean
  broke down, an' hardly mentioned his ancestrial family once in a week.</p>

  <p>"One day the beadle's wife falls ill, an' the rector sends round for Mrs.
  Haddock to go an' sweep out the church. So she turns to oad Jim an' says:
  'There be a job o' sweepin' up to church; get along quick an' do it while I
  sit in this here unhealthy house an' keep out the ghosts. An' mind I don't
  get no complaints from parson about it when I go up for the money in the
  evenin'.'</p>

  <p>"Well, he comes up to the church quiet an' humble, an' meets the parson in
  the porch, an' when the parson sees him, broom an' all, he laughs nigh as
  much as he did before the wed-din'. ''Pon my soul, 'tis too bad of her,' says
  the parson, 'but I dunno as you don't deserve it. 'Twouldn't be much of an
  admiral they'd make o' you!'</p>

  <p>"Oad Jim went in an' he started sweepin' humble an' quiet enough. But his
  heart were pretty bitter in him, an' the parson's words den't help it. So he
  went on a-sweepin' till he came opposite oad Jerry Haddock's monument, an'
  there were oad Jerry, his great-gran'father ten times over, as had caused all
  the trouble, smilin' down at him, blind an' contempshus. That roused oad Jim
  at last.</p>

  <p>"'I dussen't strike my wife,' he says, 'an' the parson be a man o' scorn
  an' wrath. But you can't hit me back,' he says. An' with that he swings round
  the broom an ketches oad Jerry Haddock sich a lift under the ear that the
  head flied clean down the chancel, an' they found it in the font next
  christenin' day!"</p>

     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; A LUCIFO MATCH</h2>

  <h3>Illustrated by Tom Browne, R.I.</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Jan 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">PERSONS with a choice of several names are not common
  outside the peerage; but some of them&mdash;wholly unconnected with any
  peer&mdash;are to be discovered in London crowds, though discovery is not
  what they are there for. Crowds, in fact, attract them, from the
  circumstances that whatever the number of individuals in a crowd there are
  sure to be several times that number of pockets, mostly with something in
  them; and a pickpocket who has once been convicted finds a change of name a
  wise precaution. So we arrive at Johnson.</p>

  <p>It chanced that Johnson stood in quite a small crowd&mdash;perhaps of
  twenty&mdash;that stared at a shop-window in Oxford Street. He had only been
  Johnson for a week, poor fellow, since emerging from some months' retirement,
  and as yet the name did not sit easily. He had to keep it continually in
  mind, lest in some unforeseen emergency he might call himself Jones, or
  Barker, or Jenkinson, any one of which was dangerous, and had been discarded
  in its turn for that reason; always after just such another holiday as that
  he had lately disenjoyed.</p>

  <p>Johnson was a mild person&mdash;not at all the sort of man whom one might
  suppose to be a pickpocket&mdash;which was fortunate, of course, for Johnson.
  He was a meek, rather timid body, whose tastes would have been domestic if he
  had been a family man; and he would have been a family man if it were not for
  the expense. He was temperate, thrifty, and inoffensive; he shrank with
  horror from the idea of anything violent, such as burglary or work; he had no
  vices, no particular abilities, and only one small talent: he could pick a
  pocket very well indeed. Altogether, Johnson was an unusually virtuous
  thief.</p>

  <p>He stood in a small crowd in Oxford Street, as I have said, and while the
  small crowd stared at the shop window because of some new idea of the
  shopkeeper's, Johnson considered pockets according to ideas of his own;
  having a natural human perference for the easiest pocket in the most
  sumptuous habiliment. He felt himself much drawn toward a man in an
  "immensikoff"&mdash;a fur-lined overcoat&mdash;which was quite the most
  magnificent garment in the crowd. The large side-pocket of the "immensikoff"
  gaped invitingly, and, though outside overcoat-pockets were barren vessels as
  a rule, this was so very easy that it were wasting a chance not to try it. So
  Johnson placed himself against the pocket and tried, with unexpected
  success.</p>

  <p>For indeed, at the bottom of that pocket reposed a purse&mdash;not at all
  what one might expect to find there. In an instant that purse was transferred
  to the outside pocket, so closely adjacent, of Johnson's light overcoat; and
  then Johnson paused for a moment, ostentatiously scratching his cheek with
  the guilty hand, and staring with rapt eyes at the window; till he judged it
  expedient to edge gently away and evaporate from the little crowd.</p>

  <p>He strolled easily to the next turning, turned up it with quicker steps,
  and so into a quieter cross street. Here he paused, plunged his hand into his
  side-pocket, and&mdash;found it empty.</p>

  <p>His chin fell, and he stood amazed. There was no doubt of it&mdash;this
  was the pocket into which he had dropped the purse, and now there was nothing
  there. He felt in the opposite pocket&mdash;needlessly, for he clearly
  remembered working with his right hand, and with his right side-pocket
  against the left pocket of the "immensikoff." There was nothing now in either
  of his side-pockets, though he raked them through with anxious fingers. And
  then everything inside him bounced at the sudden touch of a hand on his
  shoulder. He shrank and turned, and found himself confronted by the man in
  the fur-lined coat.</p>

  <p>The man was grinning at him with sardonic politeness, and Johnson did not
  like him at all. He was tall and broad and dark, while Johnson was small and
  narrow and pale. The stranger's black moustache was waxed into long spikes,
  which pointed toward the outer edges of the flat brim of a very tall hat, and
  gave a touch of the unearthly to his grin; and in his hand he extended toward
  Johnson a metal box&mdash;Johnson's own tobacco-box, in truth, which he now
  remembered to have left in that same side coat-pocket.</p>

  <p>"How de do?" said the sardonic stranger. "Were you feeling in your pocket
  for this?"</p>

  <p>Johnson's panic impulse was to deny his tobacco-box utterly, but the
  stranger's black eyes were piercing his very brain, and he felt it useless.
  He took the box that was forced on him, and gasped unintelligible
  acknowledgments. He meant to say that he was extremely obliged, and didn't
  know he had dropped it; but he never remembered what he did say.</p>

  <p>"I believe some sneaking thief picked your pocket," said the stranger, his
  grin growing fiercer. "Open it and see if anything's missing."</p>

  <p>Johnson began a mumble that it was all right and of no consequence and
  didn't matter, but the eyes and the satanic grin compelled him, and he sprang
  the lid. Instantly there arose from within a gigantic creature with horns,
  which ran across his hand on horrid clawed legs and made for his sleeve.
  Johnson squeaked like a rat, and flung box and insect to the ground together.
  He had a feminine horror of crawling things, and had never seen a stag-beetle
  before.</p>

  <p><a id="pic33"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403411h-images/GreenGinger13-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The stranger snatched the box as it fell, and, brushing roughly against
  Johnson, skilfully scooped up the insect from the pavement.</p>

  <p>"What?" he said. "Do you mean to say it wasn't yours at all! And yet you
  wanted to take it? Is there anything else in those pockets of yours that
  doesn't belong to you? Show me!"</p>

  <p>"No, sir! Nothing at all, sir, upon my solemn davy!" wailed Johnson in
  terror. For the eyes and the grin were fiercer than ever. "Nothing at all,
  sir!" protested Johnson, pulling out the pocket-linings. And there, as the
  right-hand pocket came inside out, emerged the stranger's purse!</p>

  <p>"Liar!" cried the dark man. "Thief! That is my purse!"</p>

  <p>He snatched it away and opened it, while Johnson stood helpless in
  amazement, with his pockets protruding on each side.</p>

  <p>"See!" pursued the stranger, thrusting the open purse under his nose. "My
  purse, with my money in it! What about that?"</p>

  <p>Instinct brought a jumbled defence to Johnson's lips. "Quite a
  mistake&mdash;wouldn't think of such a thing, being a gentleman himself.
  Accident that might happen to anybody&mdash;a lot of trouble in the family
  lately"&mdash;and so on.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" snapped the stranger.</p>

  <p>It disconcerted Johnson more than anything else to see that this fiendish
  person was grinning more than ever, while his unavoidable eyes seemed to
  divine more about Johnson than even Johnson ever knew. "What's your name?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Jones!" spluttered the thief, in a panic. "Barker!&mdash;no,
  Jenkinson&mdash;I mean Johnson!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," the stranger replied; and now his moustache and his grin
  chased each other to the very tips of his ears. "I see; Jones, <i>alias</i>
  Barker, <i>alias</i> Jenkinson, and at present Johnson. Last conviction under
  the name Jenkinson, eh?"</p>

  <p>"'Twasn't exactly a conviction, sir, I assure you," protested the sweating
  pickpocket. "The judge's mistake entirely&mdash;quite a misunderstanding; and
  the commonest watch you ever see; not worth a bob!"</p>

  <p>"And what did you get? A year?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;nothing of the kind. It's a wicked slander, sir, when
  anybody says it was a year. Not a day more than nine months, I give you my
  solemn word!"</p>

  <p>"After a dozen previous convictions?"</p>

  <p>"No sir&mdash;that's another slander; anybody as told you that is trying
  to take my character away. There wasn't more than seven, sir, or eight at the
  very most. It's 'ard to be scandalized like that, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Shocking!" The stranger had slipped his purse away and now had his hand
  on Johnson's shoulder, with finger and thumb taking a good nip of his
  coat-collar. "Only seven or eight convictions! Poor chap; you shall have
  another at once. Come along!"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, sir&mdash;let me alone! On my solemn davy, sir, it was all a
  mistake. I dunno how the purse got there!" And it surprised Johnson to find
  himself offering an excuse with such a deal of truth in it.</p>

  <p>The stranger's grin relaxed a little, and his voice grew more
  business-like. "Very well," he said. "Come with me for an hour and I won't
  charge you. But don't you displease me, my virtuous friend!" The grin
  flickered up again. "Don't you displease me, or you'll go back to as long a
  dose of gaol as I can get for you, mind that! You shall buy your release on
  my terms. Come along; but first stuff those pockets in again."</p>

  <p>Johnson obeyed, and walked by the side of his persecutor in a maze of
  sickening bewilderment. Could he be really awake? The whole thing was
  uncommonly like a hideous nightmare, down to the very beetle. He had the most
  distinct recollection of his shock of surprise at finding his coat-pockets
  empty; yet he <i>had</i> put the purse there, and there it proved to be after
  all. The thing was the more like a dream, because his efforts to remember
  made it all seem like something that had occurred a long time ago. And he
  would doubtless have believed it a nightmare and made some desperate effort
  to wake himself, were it not for the fact that the gloating stranger most
  palpably had him by the arm as they walked through the back streets, and now
  and again put a question of such a pungent and penetrating nature that
  demanded all Johnson's waking wits to meet it. Such wits as Johnson had were
  barely sufficient for the needs of his trade, and now they were oppressed by
  a feeling that he was being "got at" in some unfathomable manner; for indeed
  the satanic stranger chuckled gaily to himself as the torment went on.</p>

  <p>Their way led through numerous back streets, which Johnson was too
  disconcerted to recognize, even if he knew them; and at last they stopped
  before a very blank and secret-looking door in a tall building that had no
  more than two other openings in it, and those windows, small and high.</p>

  <p>The stranger opened the door with a latchkey, never looking at the key,
  but always at Johnson, with that embarrassing grin unaltered, unless it were
  now a little less fierce and a little more whimsical. The door revealed
  nothing but a dark passage, into which Johnson was pushed without ceremony.
  The place smelt damp, and on the whole strikingly like a cell in a
  police-station; a fact which gave the prisoner's terrors a more definite
  turn. The door closed behind them and left them wholly in the dark; and
  Johnson, seized by the arm, was thrust stumbling and staggering along the
  passage till he emerged on a spot only a degree less obscure, where nothing
  was discernible but some vast construction of square beams that vanished into
  blackness above. Here the stranger paused, and groping in the gloom among the
  beams, flung open another door.</p>

  <p>"Get in there," he said, "and sit down. I shan't want you for an hour. You
  can go to sleep if you like."</p>

  <p>Johnson obediently stumbled into the dark opening, and the door slammed
  behind him with a bang and a sharp click. It was black&mdash;blacker than
  ever, but at least he was alone for a space, and might collect his faculties.
  He reached about him, and had no difficulty in finding the walls of his
  prison, for in fact they were scarce a yard apart in any direction. It seemed
  that he was in a wooden cupboard, with a ledge for seat. He sat on the ledge
  and wondered.</p>

  <p>Imprisonment was not wholly a novelty, though this was certainly the
  darkest cell he had ever inhabited, and the smallest. There was to be an
  hour's respite, it seemed, but he was mighty uneasy as to what would happen
  at the end of the hour. He thought again of that horrible beetle, and the
  clothes tingled on his skin at the recollection, till he began to rub himself
  all over. Heavens! if there were more of them in this place! He jumped to his
  feet, shook himself and stamped, and then bethought him of his match-box. He
  found it and split it, stooped for it hurriedly, butted his head into one
  side of the cupboard and his opposite end into another, and came to the floor
  in a heap.</p>

  <p>"Now then, keep quiet in there!"</p>

  <p>The voice was a strange one&mdash;certainly not that of the dark
  man&mdash;and it came from&mdash;where? Nowhere about him, but apparently
  from somewhere above, though even of this he was not certain. Surely there
  was no possibility that he could be watched in this unspeakable darkness. He
  groped painfully, found a match, groped again and found the box to strike it
  on.</p>

  <p>The light was a great relief, for it revealed the fact that at least the
  place was free from visible insects. He could see now that his cell was
  wooden&mdash;top, bottom, and sides; and then came burned fingers and sudden
  darkness. He lit another match, and satisfied himself that there was no
  cranny, nor even a keyhole, through which peeping was possible; then he lit
  another to pick up those remaining, and another after that.</p>

  <p>"Now then!" came the voice again. "Leave off strikin' them matches!"</p>

  <p>Johnson stopped, bumped his head again, and scrambled to his seat. Then he
  found courage to speak. "I say&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You stow that row, d'y'ear? Shut up."</p>

  <p>The prisoner said no more, but waited. Strange noises reached his ear from
  some faraway part of the building, and a little nearer there were subdued
  creakings. He began to remember stories of mysterious rooms that closed up
  and crushed men imprisoned in them; of weighted ceilings that fell; of
  chambers slowly filled with poisonous gas. As he sat he began to tremble; and
  as the minutes passed he felt himself growing desperate with fear. He wished
  he had allowed himself to be handed to the police, for at least he knew what
  that meant. But now&mdash;he could not endure much longer. He had made up his
  mind, come what might, to shout his loudest for help; when, as he stood
  feeling the hundredth time for the door-fastening, he was suddenly flung
  backward and down, confusedly realizing that the cupboard was shooting upward
  bodily. Was the thing a lift?</p>

  <p>It stopped with a jerk, and the prisoner, recovering his legs, was aware
  of a loud and now familiar voice. There was a tap on the door, and a click;
  and instantly it flew open, and Johnson was blinded by a flood of light and
  deafened by a roar of sound.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of faces stared at him from a great hall, as many voices shouted
  a delighted greeting, and twice as many hands clapped loud applause. The
  cupboard stood open on a brilliantly lighted stage, and by it stood the
  sardonic stranger in evening dress, with a black wand in his hand; while
  Johnson, gasping and dishevelled, blinked and cowered helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," cried the conjurer, "I have the honor to introduce
  Mr. Johnson, <i>alias</i> Jones, <i>alias</i> Barker, <i>alias</i> Jenkinson,
  the eminent pickpocket. You will remember that when I enclosed the lady in
  the cabinet I promised you quite a new and original <i>dnouement</i> to the
  performance&mdash;something never before attempted. I think I have fulfilled
  my promise. Not only has the lady disappeared, but by an extraordinary
  application of occult natural forces I have brought into her place a
  pickpocket snatched this moment from his nefarious practices in Oxford
  Street. You observe his confusion? What more natural? But two minutes ago his
  hand was in the pocket of an eminent and distinguished gentleman, much like
  myself in appearance, seeking that gentleman's purse. In an
  instant&mdash;whist! he finds himself placed before you on this stage, half a
  mile off. Ladies and gentlemen, it is just possible that some among you
  suspected the lady who disappeared of being a confederate of mine; but I defy
  any one of you to call this man a confederate. Does he look like it? Does he
  look as though he came here on purpose? Has he the calm, self-possessed,
  happy, smiling appearance natural to any man who has the good fortune to be
  in my employment? Look at him. Some gentleman who has ever had his pocket
  picked may remember him; if any of you are connected with the police you are
  sure to know him. He has been brought up at half the police-courts in London
  and has been convicted at the Old Bailey and the Sessions House over and over
  again. He has just completed nine months' board and residence at this
  country's expense, under the name of Jenkinson; if he hadn't changed his name
  he'd have got more. Are you quite convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that he is
  not a confederate? Any test you like to suggest will be applied. Is there any
  lady present he has ever robbed who would like to stick a bonnet-pin into
  him? No? Don't hesitate&mdash;you are quite welcome, I assure you. Come now,
  I wish you would. You see, under the Employer's Liability Act I am liable for
  any injury occurring to people I employ, but I don't care what happens to
  this chap. Come now, let me persuade you. Isn't there any dear, kind lady
  present, who will oblige me by sticking a bonnet-pin into this criminal, just
  to oblige me? It doesn't matter whether he has robbed you or not&mdash;I
  don't mind. He'd rob you if he could, you know. Here he is." He seized the
  wretched Johnson by the collar, and thrust him forward. "I always find ladies
  very obliging," he went on. "<i>Surely</i> you won't all be so unkind as to
  refuse just to stick him with a bonnet-pin while I hold him? Just to help me
  convince the company, now?"</p>

  <p>There were laughs and titters, and the conjurer whispered from behind:
  "All right, you fool, they won't do it." Then he proceeded, aloud: "You
  won't? Not one of you? Then I shall have to try something else. I'm always
  glad to introduce a novelty into my performance, and I'll think you'll admit
  that this is the first time a real live pickpocket has ever been brought upon
  the stage in this extraordinary manner. Having got him here it would be a
  pity to waste him, wouldn't it? Very well. I will proceed to try a little
  experiment with a view to showing how dishonesty would be dealt with in this
  country, if I were Prime Minister. Will any ladies and gentlemen in the
  company oblige me by the loan of a few small articles of value? A few rings,
  a watch, a gold pencil-case&mdash;anything of that sort, you know. I'm sure I
  shan't have to wait long for things like that with such a high-class audience
  as this. Come now&mdash;thank you, sir; a ring; a valuable diamond ring from
  a gentleman in the second row. Yes? Thank you, madam&mdash;a locket. A gold
  watch? I should like a gold watch&mdash;and so would Mr. Johnson, I am sure.
  Here it comes&mdash;thank you, sir. A gold pencil-case&mdash;two more rings,
  a chain, and a silver match-box; thank you&mdash;thank you. I think that will
  do; we mustn't risk too much on a first experiment, you know. Now I should
  like some gentleman from the company to assist me by placing these articles
  in Mr. Johnson's pockets, in full sight of the house. Will <i>you,</i> sir?
  Thank you; just step up here. Now, will you please take the articles one by
  one from the table, and place them separately in any of the criminal's
  pockets you choose. Well in sight of the company, mind. Stand a little
  aside&mdash;that's it&mdash;so that everything shall be perfectly clear. I
  need hardly assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that this gentleman is no
  confederate of mine. I do not invite you to test it by sticking a bonnet-pin
  into him&mdash;he is a good deal bigger than Johnson, and it might not be
  safe. I am sure you will accept his word of honor from a gentleman of his
  size."</p>

  <p>The gentleman approached Johnson and followed the conjurer's instructions,
  and the conjurer, from a little way off, reported the bestowal of each
  article aloud. "Gold watch in right-hand waistcoat-pocket; diamond ring in
  left-hand waistcoat-pocket; chain in inside coat-pocket;" and so forth. As
  for Johnson, he began to feel a good deal happier. He resented the
  indignities to which he had been subjected, of course, but, after all, he had
  expected something much worse than this. All the bewilderment and anxiety of
  the earlier part of the adventure were at an end now, and all was plain
  enough. The conjurer had scored heavily, it was true, and the effect of
  Johnson's appearance in the cabinet, aghast and panic-stricken, was something
  altogether beyond the possibilities of ordinary preparation and rehearsal.
  But Johnson's relief was immense, and now the novel experience of having his
  pockets voluntarily stuffed with valuables was rather pleasant than
  otherwise. Johnson was himself again, and vastly on the alert for fresh moves
  in the game.</p>

  <p><a id="pic35"

  </div><br>

  <p>The gentleman descended from the platform, and the conjurer came forward.
  "Now, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "you have seen the articles
  safely&mdash;or shall we say unsafely?&mdash;placed in the thief's pockets.
  But to make everything perfectly plain, and to identify the owner of each, I
  will just rapidly run over them again. This ring, sir&mdash;you see it? You
  are sure you identify it? It is your property, and you will remember that it
  is in the left-hand waistcoat-pocket, where I carefully replace it, as you
  see. The watch&mdash;that is yours, sir; you may examine it again, if you
  please. No? Well, you will bear in mind that it is in the thief's right-hand
  waistcoat-pocket. There it is. This chain&mdash;the owner of this chain may
  see that no substitution has been made&mdash;is in the inside coat-pocket, on
  the left. Remember that, please."</p>

  <p>The company, vastly interested, watched the apparent return of each
  trinket, but Johnson knew better. Nothing but the conjurer's fingers entered
  each pocket in turn, and nothing remained there at all. Somewhere within the
  breast of the conjurer's coat was a spot over which his fingers flickered
  instantaneously after each pocket was done with; and when at last he turned
  away, ostentatiously dusting his fingers with his pocket-handkerchief after
  the contamination of Johnson, the handkerchief also flickered over that same
  spot. So much Johnson observed with eyes trained by use in all matters
  concerned with pockets.</p>

  <p>The conjurer stepped between Johnson and the company, putting his
  pocket-handkerchief into his coat-tail pocket; and Johnson saw that something
  black went with it.</p>

  <p>"Now, ladies and gentlemen," said the conjurer, "the experiment I am about
  to make is one of the greatest interest to every law-abiding person. I
  propose to show you how, by proper scientific precautions known only to
  myself, all theft, all dishonesty, may be rendered ineffectual and
  useless."</p>

  <p>Gesticulating and bowing elegantly as he spoke, the conjurer stepped so
  closely before Johnson that only one thing could happen, and that was
  inevitable. Johnson had nothing but one small talent, as I have said; he
  could pick a pocket very well indeed&mdash;probably better than the conjurer.
  He picked one now. The black thing was a little velvet bag, soft and flat, as
  Johnson felt when it was safely in his own pocket. And the conjurer, with all
  eyes on him, went on.</p>

  <p>"Just consider, now, how valuable my process would be to the Government of
  this country. Half the police force might be disbanded, and most of the
  magistrates pensioned off. People like our friend Johnson, <i>alias</i>
  Jones, <i>alias</i> Barker, <i>alias</i> Jenkinson, would have to turn
  honest, or starve. Now for the experiment."</p>

  <p>He turned and caught Johnson once more by the collar. "Here you see, is
  the pickpocket whom I brought straight out of Oxford Street by the exercise
  of the wonderful scientific law to which I have alluded. Here he is, with
  your valuables in his pockets, as you have observed with your own eyes. Now I
  shall send Johnson away&mdash;turn him out, kick him out&mdash;from this
  place, and let him run where he likes; and when he is gone I shall endeavor,
  by my scientific process, to bring your valuables back here, just as I
  brought Johnson himself, and restore them to you in a way that I hope will
  surprise you. Now Johnson, <i>alias</i> Jones, <i>alias</i> Barker,
  <i>alias</i> Jenkinson, out you go, and keep what you've got if you can!
  Ladies and gentlemen you will agree that I could not afford to kick a
  confederate&mdash;he would give me away. So as a guarantee of good faith I
  kick Johnson off the platform. Hall-porter! Run this man off the premises,
  and never let him come here again!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic36"
     name="pic36"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

  </div>

  <p>He swung Johnson to the end of the platform, thrust him over the edge with
  hand and foot, and stood bowing and waving his wand as the porter bundled the
  victim out. "Good-bye, Mr. Johnson!" cried the conjurer; "good-bye! Run as
  hard as ever you can!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Johnson reached the street he obeyed this order with all the
  strength of his legs, barely observing from the corner of his eye that the
  front of the hall was covered with posters announcing afternoon and evening
  performances by the great Lucifo, the Wizard of Andalusia. And when he had
  run some distance he turned into a dark entry and there disentangled from the
  velvet bag the gold watch, the three rings, the chain, the gold pencil-case,
  and the silver match-box.</p>

  <p>"He was mighty anxious," reflected Johnson, "for some proof that I wasn't
  his pal. Well, he's got it now, and I hope he's satisfied."</p>

  <p>For some days Johnson never ventured out till after dark; but his days at
  home were not dull, for he had bought a small collection of newspapers;
  wherefrom he derived solace and chuckles, as he read and read again under the
  headings: "Riotous Scene at an Entertainment," "Extraordinary Occurrence at
  St. Basil's Hall," "Serious Attack on a Conjurer"; and, in the case of an
  irresponsible halfpenny evening paper, "Lucifo Lamentably Left."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; ARTS AND CRAFTS</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the early fifties a stranger in the parlor of the Castle
  Inn at Hadleigh was rarity enough, but a stranger sleeping in the house for
  two nights was almost beyond precedent. But at the time of this tale the
  stranger was there, visible at a great distance because of his size and the
  redness of his face, and audible farther because of a very assertive and
  persistent voice, too large even for the man. The man was Mr. Peter Fossett
  of Kelvedon, who had come to take over a stock of sheep; and on the evening
  of his arrival the parlor at the Castle was so full of Mr. Peter Fossett that
  the more regular company seemed to be squeezed into the corners. Even Abel
  Pennyfather was less noisy and less boastful. Old Harry Prentice and Banham
  the carrier were much impressed, but the waggish sparkle of Dan Fisk's squint
  waxed as the evening wore on.</p>

  <p>The stranger ("foreigner" was the word among the older Hadleigh people)
  was a farmer exceptionally well-to-do by the merit of his fathers before him.
  He had ridden the thirty miles on a handsome mare, with a man to drive the
  sheep back, and while the master took his ease with brandy-and-water in the
  parlor, the man took beer and dispensed information in the taproom. It was
  not so much of his possessions and his prosperity that Mr. Peter Fossett
  talked in the parlor&mdash;that matter expanded freely enough from the man in
  the taproom&mdash;but of his most amazing sagacity and unbounded smartness;
  whereof he had many anecdotes, not always clear in front, though all
  unfailingly satisfactory to Mr. Fossett, and mightily redounding to his glory
  and triumph.</p>

  <p>"I ha'n't been a-nigh Hadleigh afore in my life," said Mr. Fossett,
  unflaggingly providing the conversation and keeping it to the same subject.
  "Never before, though I'm turned o' thirty. I'm a Kelvedon man, an' I've took
  a rise out o' some of 'em in most parts of Essex&mdash;ah, an' London too,
  once or twice&mdash;an' now I've come here. You've got an oad chap here I
  mean to have a look at, 'fore I go back. I've heard a deal of him here an'
  there about Essex; him they call Cunning Murrell, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Cunning Murrell, eh?" interjected Dan Fisk, scenting amusement. "If
  you've come here to take a rise out o' he, you'd better stop a bit an' rent a
  house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fossett turned his beefy face slowly toward Dan Fisk's corner. "Ho!"
  he said, with a voice of vast scorn, "you're one o' them as believes in him,
  I count?"</p>

  <p>Dan beamed gently. "Ay, sarten to say," he admitted, "Cunning Murrell be a
  monsus clever man."</p>

  <p>"Herbs an' cures an' surveyin'," murmured Banham.</p>

  <p>"Witchcraft an' things stole," Prentice added, with a shake of the
  head.</p>

  <p>"Fortunes in the stars," added Jobson.</p>

  <p>"An' visions in a pail," said another. "Sayin' nothen' o' warts cured
  overnight."</p>

  <p>"Ah! fortunes in the stars an' visions in a pail!" blared the stranger
  contemptuously. "A monsus clever man, sarten to say&mdash;for Hadleigh!"</p>

  <p>"Cunnin' Murr'll be knowed arl over Essex an' farther," maintained
  Jobson.</p>

  <p>"Ay, true enough. Fools an' their gammick go everywhere. Your oad Murrell
  may be mighty clever for Hadleigh, but he wouldn't do for Kelvedon&mdash;not
  he! Not with me at home, he wouldn't! 'Tis sarten he seems to come it over
  you mighty easy, but I hoad a pound he can't come over me! Not he! I'm going
  to have a look at this oad curiosity with his fortun'-tellin' an' wisions in
  buckets. He don't come over me with such truck!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I count you be a man not easy took in, Master Fossett, sir," cooed
  Dan Fisk, in honeyed tones, whereat anybody who knew Dan would have taken
  warning. But the stranger knew not Dan, and went on vaingloriously.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I count I be," he said. "You needn't take it from me&mdash;ask
  anywhere I'm knowed. Lord, I dunno where I'd be if I weren't. Why I'd ha' bin
  married, for one thing, long afore this. But I ain't!"</p>

  <p>"Ah," murmured Dan, "I count there be a mortial great competition."</p>

  <p>"Ay, mayhap," answered Mr. Fossett, complacently, "though 'taren't my ways
  to talk o' that. But I ain't met man or woman yet as could get the better o'
  me, an' I've a-been about the world a bit, too&mdash;twice in Lon-don, an'
  Ipswich an' Colchester&mdash;an' I've larned a sight too much to be took in
  by such oad fellars as this here Murrell o' yourn."</p>

  <p>"Well," observed Prentice, "he ha'n't tried to take you in yet."</p>

  <p>"True 'tis," replied Fossett, "though I most mighty wish he would! Ay, I
  count I'd like him to try!"</p>

  <p>"'Tis easy enough to let him try," remarked Dan Fisk; "easy enough if you
  ben't afeared of him."</p>

  <p>"Afeared of him! Do I fare afeared of him?
  An&mdash;oad&mdash;oad&mdash;why, I'll show him up afore ye all! I'll make ye
  laugh at him, here in Hadleigh, that I will! If he ben't afeared to face me,
  that is!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he'll see ye, if ye go businesslike in the mornin'. He's not to know
  his mortial danger. 'Tis a cur'ous venture!"</p>

  <p>"I'll go! I'll hev a joke on oad Murrell!"</p>

  <p>And so between the doubts of the rest and the careful management of Dan
  Fisk, alternately flattering and challenging, Mr. Peter Fossett was brought
  to promise a vast exposure of Murrell on the morrow. And by the time he had
  gone to bed he had been brought to hint darkly at schemes of preternatural
  sagacity whereby the whole Murrell superstition should be exposed to the
  eternal derision of Essex, beginning at Hadleigh itself; and generally to
  proclaim Cunning Murrell already a vanquished humbug.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he went to bed far fuller of brandy-and-water than of
  schemes, and woke in the morning with no schemes at all. Indeed, Mr. Fossett
  was not a man of invention, though he was none the less self-confident on
  that account. He finished his large breakfast, stretched his large limbs, and
  rolled out into Hadleigh street resolved to gratify his curiosity by a call
  on Cunning Murrell, and in no sort doubtful of his ability to put the wise
  man's inventions to rout. His scheme should come, he promised himself, when
  he heard what Murrell had to say. And so it did.</p>

  <p>It was scarce a score of lazy steps to Murrell's cottage, in the little
  black row that stood almost by the side of the inn garden. Mr. Fossett's
  lusty rap brought a high-pitched call of "Come yow in!" and with that he
  clicked the latch and met Cunning Murrell.</p>

  <p>The little old man sat at a little table, and the whole room about him was
  hung and stacked with dried herbs in bundles. Murrell's eyes, sharp and quick
  as a weasel's, ran the length of Mr. Fossett top to toe.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door and sit," said Murrel sharply, pointing to a chair, "and
  tell me your business."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fossett, in no way abashed by this abruptness, dropped into the chair,
  spread his legs and rolled his head waggishly.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Master Murrell," he answered. "I come here to larn from you an'
  first you ask me a question. Now I count so lamed an' cunnin' a man as you be
  should know me an' my business afore I tell it."</p>

  <p>"As to who you be," the old man replied, "that I know well enough. Mr.
  Peter Fossett, o' Gatpoles farm, Kelvedon. A man o' money, if 'tis said true,
  an' Gatpoles farm be five hundred acres. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, 'tis true enough."</p>

  <p>"But 'tis no claim o' my art to know that," the old man went on. "You're
  the only stranger in the place, an' folks talk. Your man talks, an' arl
  Hadleigh knows as much as I've told 'ee by this. But as to your business with
  me, 'tis no such plain matter. D'ye wish me to tell it?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, Master Murr'll, I do."</p>

  <p>"Then 'tis proper I work it by geomancy. 'Tis a cur'ous art, an' known to
  few. I take a paper, thus, an' I write your name, so. There be twelve letters
  in that name, and I divide them into fower threes. I putt down they fower
  threes one above another, so. Now take you the pen an' make a row o' plain
  strokes opposite each three. Stop when you please, and don't count as you
  do't, or arl will spile."</p>

  <p>Mr. Peter Fossett, willing to give his victim plenty of rope, took the
  paper and obeyed. With a blot and a smudge here and there, four heavily
  fisted rows of strokes presently appeared on the paper opposite the letters,
  and then Murrell took the paper and considered it with anxious care.</p>

  <p>"You hey wrote these strokes in order opposite the letters in fower rows,
  without countin' any row," he said. "Good. Now I work this geomantic
  figure."</p>

  <p>The old man's pen hovered a moment over the letters and strokes, and then
  descended to describe a group of ciphers at the end of each row. This done,
  he began another group of ciphers below the whole muddle, dotting his pen
  here and there among the letters, strokes, and ciphers above, and deriving
  his lower group, by some mysterious mathematic, from his upper.</p>

  <p>"Right witness; left witness; judge," he said thoughtfully, carrying his
  pen from one cipher to another. "Here I read much that would surprise you.
  Your reason for coming here now; you ask me to tell you that?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I'd mighty like you to guess it!"</p>

  <p>"Guess it I will not, for there's no need. By my cur'ous arts I can know
  for sarten. Master Fossett, you be most desperate in love!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fossett's first impulse was to guffaw aloud. Cunning Murrell's guess
  was the farthest thing from his mind, and one he had never dreamed of. But he
  held in his mirth by a choking effort, and dissembled, for he began to scheme
  vaguely at last. More rope, he thought, more rope for this amazing old fool
  to hang himself high as Haman.</p>

  <p>"Master Murrell!" he exclaimed, "that be the most surprisin' 'zact guess
  that ever I hey heard! Wonnerful!"</p>

  <p>"'Tais no guess, I tell 'ee, Master Fossett. 'Tis no guess, but sarten
  knowledge by my lawful arts."</p>

  <p>"Then if it be no guess," answered Fossett, following his opportunity,
  "maybe you can just as easy tell me the lady's name?"</p>

  <p>Cunning Murrell shook his head sadly. "You be mighty hard o' belief,
  Master Fossett," he said, "but if you want more proof, more you shall have,
  plensheous more. Can I tell 'ee the lady's name? for sarten truth I can an'
  will, an' that without another word."</p>

  <p>He returned to his geomantic formula and studied it afresh. "You hey put
  your hand to this unknowin'," he said, "and all your thoughts lie bare to him
  who hey the art to read the figure. Her name&mdash;her name&mdash;let me see
  now; her given name be Ann!"</p>

  <p>If Mr. Fossett had not been a stranger, he would have begun to feel
  uneasy. But, confident in ignorance, he chuckled inwardly, for the old man
  was adding blunder to blunder. The sole human creature called Ann whom
  Fossett could remember was his own grandmother. This should come out, that
  very night, in the Castle parlor to Murrell's face, if but he could be
  brought there among his neighbors. Meanwhile, let the old humbug be drawn
  farther into the net.</p>

  <p>"Master Murrell, you surprise me more and more. 'Tis prophecy, nothin'
  else. Though 'tis true Ann be a name christened to more'n one. D'ye get her
  other name too?"</p>

  <p>"Her other name," Murrell answered deliberately, dropping his eyes and his
  pen once more to the paper, "her other name&mdash;yes; her&mdash;her other
  name is p'inted out by the figure in letters of your own name&mdash;the first
  two an' the last two. Her other name I read is Pett&mdash;Pett with two
  is&mdash;Ann Pett is the whole name!"</p>

  <p>Fossett the stranger, apprehending nothing, gazed upward at the herbs
  depending from the ceiling, and whistled to keep his mouth from a grin. This
  was magnificent. Possibly there were people in the world of the name of Pett,
  but quite certainly he had never heard that name till this moment. The old
  simpleton was floundering worse at every step. What a show-up for him in the
  evening at the Castle! What an unadulterated lark! More rope for the
  self-strangulation of Cunning Murrell!</p>

  <p>"Whew! That do beat arl!" cried Mr. Fossett. "Ann Pett, sarten to say!
  That there blessed name as hey been what's-a-naming itself on my heart like a
  thingumbob! 'Tis outrageous wonnerful! Master Murrell, you be the most
  scientific oad pusson in Essex; the hull world be knowed to ye like a book.
  An' what will ye do next, Master Murrell?"</p>

  <p>"Next?" repeated Cunning Murrell, plainly gratified by his client's
  enthusiasm. "Next I do what most you wish. 'Tis plain you den't come here
  onny to be told what you know. You come here to ask my help, an' my help you
  shall hey. I will give 'ee your heart's wish; her stubborn heart shall be
  overcome, and Ann Pett shall be drawed toward 'ce, an' marry her you shall.
  'Tis what you're longing, ben't it?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, Master Murrell, what else?" the visitor assured him, shaking with
  interior mirth. "'Tis what I'm longin' most hainish powerful."</p>

  <p>"Good then. Here is more paper. Write on the one piece your own name and
  Ann Pett's on the other."</p>

  <p>This feat Mr. Fossett accomplished, with a great squaring of elbows.
  Murrell took the two papers, and filled a glass with water. Then, twisting
  the papers together, he lighted them with a match and let the black ashes
  drop into the water till no paper was left.</p>

  <p>"So it must stand for two hours, and then I shall deal further," observed
  Murrell, putting the glass on a shelf and covering it with a saucer. "Those
  words, that seem to be gone, shall be carried to the mind of Ann Pett by
  cur'ous an' subtile arts. An' more shall follow. Take you a paper more, and
  write as I shall tell. Write plain: <i>'Tis Jain Pett is my heart's love.</i>
  Have 'ee got that?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, that's down," Fossett replied, winking genially at the paper.</p>

  <p><i>"'Tis Jinn Pelt is my heart's love. 'Tis my wish she be my wife, and
  thereto I give pledge.</i> Is't arl down?"</p>

  <p><i>"Give pledge,"</i> repeated Fossett, with his tongue curled at the side
  of his mouth as he looped the 'g.' "Ay, 'tis there."</p>

  <p>"Now sign."</p>

  <p>"Sign?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, full name. 'Tis naught without your own written name."</p>

  <p>"There 't be, then. But don't you burn that too?"</p>

  <p>"Not till the right time. T'other must stand two hours, as I told 'ee, an'
  I do nothen' with this till then. How far or how near Ann Pett be at this
  moment I don't know, though to find that would be easy enough for me. But far
  or near, north, south, east or west, these words will go to her by ways you
  don't dream of an' draw her an' draw her, Master Fossett. 'Tis enough. I hey
  other work."</p>

  <p>There was a timid rap of knuckles on the front door. Mr. Fossett rose
  reluctantly, for there was no moderation in his triumph, and he wished to
  draw Murrell still more.</p>

  <p>"Ben't there nothin' else you'll tell me, Master Murrell?" he asked. "I
  fare that monsus bad in love, that 'twould be a mussy to tell me
  any-thin'."</p>

  <p>"Ay, I make no doubt. But wait&mdash;till tonight, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"To-night, Master Murrell? D'ye think she can be drawed to me as soon as
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I make no promise, Master Fossett, but 'tis arl a possibility."</p>

  <p>"Master Murrell, will 'ee come to me to-night at the Castle parlor? Come
  to me there, an' I'll pay 'ee handsome."</p>

  <p>"'Tis no habit o' mine, the Castle parlor," the old man replied; "but come
  I will, since you ask. At eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Thankee, Master Murrell, thankee. An' if you can show then, fair and
  clear, you've done all ye say, if you'll draw her to me, I'll pay a fi'-pun'
  note and glad! I'll hey it ready!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fossett passed the little girl who had come for ointment, and turned
  into the quiet Castle Lane to explode. Truly this was a most magnificent go!
  He could scarcely have imagined anybody so utterly giving himself into the
  hands of the enemy as this misnamed Cunning Murrell had done. That evening in
  the Castle parlor there should be fun. Hadleigh should witness the
  confounding of Murrell by the revelation that there was no Ann Pett in
  existence, and that consequently the triumphant Fossett could not have fallen
  in love with her, even if that weakness had been at all in his way, which it
  wasn't. Therewith and therefore that Murrell was but a feeble humbug, captive
  to the bow and spear of that same unconquerable Fossett.</p>

  <p>He did his business that day with interruptions of ecstatic chuckling. He
  spread hints abroad that the total extinction of Murrell was appointed for
  eight that evening in the parlor of the Castle; and he was there, with an
  uncommonly full company, long before the hour. To all inquiries he opposed a
  wink, a grin, and a shake of the head. Not a word would he say to spoil the
  show; he would merely promise&mdash;and that he did a hundred
  times&mdash;that the fun should be well worth the waiting.</p>

  <p>The cunning man was punctual. The hour was at its seventh stroke when he
  appeared, small, sharp, shiny-hatted and calm. "Goodevenin', neighbors," he
  piped in his thin voice. "Good to ye arl. I den't expect to find so many
  here."</p>

  <p>"Ah, 'tis business o' mine, but never mind that," said the eager Fossett,
  with a wink at the expectant company. "This most as-tonishin' scientific
  neighbor o' yourn, genelmen, hey done sich as-tonishin' things to-day, that
  I'll hey no secrets from ye arl, so surprisin' it be. I went to see Master
  Murrell this mornin', genelmen, an' he knowed what I came for afore I told
  him! He told me, slap out, that I was most desperate in love! In love!
  Me!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fossett looked about him and grinned, with a second wink.</p>

  <p>"He told me I was in love," he proceeded, "an' he made count to tell me
  the gal's name. He did a little game of naughts and crosses, an' he counted
  it out o' that. He counted out the name, genelmen, and he told me it. It were
  Ann Pett! Genelmen! you'll be mighty interested to know I'm most desperate in
  love with Ann Pett!"</p>

  <p>"Ann Pett!" gasped Prentice and Jobson together. And others on every side
  repeated "Ann Pett!" staring like crabs. Dan Fisk set up a fit of laughter
  that lasted, with intervals, for the rest of the evening.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Ann Pett! Ye well may laugh! An' here's a fi'-pun' note I'm to pay if
  he draws her an' draws her so artful an' cunning to me this very evenin'!
  This Ann Pett what I love so true, genelmen!"</p>

  <p>Prentice and Jobson began laughing now, and Dan Fisk took a corner of the
  note and pushed it toward Murrell. "Go on," he cried, in a gasp, "he'll do
  it&mdash;he'll do it!"</p>

  <p>There was something in the faces about him that Mr. Fossett had not
  expected. He checked his grin and stared about him. With that Cunning Murrell
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"'Tis true enough, neighbors," he said, with simple composure. "This very
  suitable an' well-to-do young man hey cone to me an' confessed himself most
  hopeless in love with Ann Pett. He hey further give me a document, signed all
  regular, pledgin' to marry her; the kind of document there's no answering to
  in a promise-breach case, such as might occur with other couples, where the
  young man ain't smitten so deadly deep as Master Fossett be."</p>

  <p>Fossett, slow of apprehension, but stricken with a vague fear, gasped:
  "What? That paper? Den't you burn it?"</p>

  <p>"Burn it? Why no, sarten to say. 'Twould be poor respect to such a
  document as that, an' foolish, to burn it. Well, neighbors, as I were sayin',
  considerin' arl things, an' seein' how desperate this young man implored me
  to draw Ann Pett to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ann Pett!" burst out Fossett. "There ben't no Ann Pett!"</p>

  <p>"That's an unreasonable remark for a man so fond of her by witness of his
  own handwritin'," the old man went on gently. "Well, neighbors, to make
  short, I <i>hey</i> drawed her to him. Mr. Fossett be a very good match for a
  darter o' mine, as things go, especially a widder darter, with few chances at
  her age. You'll find I've earned your fi'-pun' note, Mr. Fossett. Ann! Ann
  Pett!"</p>

  <p>Murrell opened the door and called into the outer passage. And at his call
  came Ann Pett, wizen as her father, thin and sharp and worn, with her wisp of
  mouse-grey hair straggling from under a shawl. She stood in the doorway and
  stared, at first all vacant incomprehension, and then with some irritation at
  the storm of guffaws that raged unaccountably before her.</p>

  <p>Mr. Peter Fossett gurgled, gulped, blinked and shrank. He looked wildly
  about him, but in the only door stood Ann Pett, now beginning to bridle and
  snarl at the mirth she could not comprehend. Then with a despairing snatch at
  his wits Mr. Fossett caught Murrell by the arm and gasped in his ear: "Hey
  she seen that paper?"</p>

  <p>Murrell, unruffled, regarded his victim.</p>

  <p>"That I don't answer," he said. "But what if she hey not?"</p>

  <p>"I'm done&mdash;I'll buy it. Come outside." Next week Cunning Murrell was
  observed in a new blue coat, with brass buttons.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; WICKS'S WATERLOO</h2>

  <p class="first">I FIND that in the mental perspective of most people, the
  days of the Kent and Essex smugglers lie very far back, while in my own they
  stand surprisingly near. It is habit of mind, and nothing more. Those days
  were gone before mine began; though not only have I seen and talked with grey
  old smugglers on the Essex coast, but I have even tasted the white brandy of
  such astonishing strength, which they brought over in the light "tubs" of
  three or four gallons' capacity. I tasted it on my twenty-first birthday,
  forty years and more after it had been smuggled; and it came from an
  unsuspected secret store of Roboshobery Dove's, who thus designed to honor my
  majority. The treat was accompanied with much sage advice on my entry on
  manhood, as was proper from this old man of ninety and rather more, who had
  fought the french afloat as a boy; but a lecture twice as long, from one in
  no such way endeared to me as was he, could not have marred the memory of
  that amazing drink, so mild and mellow and soft, albeit a dilution of four
  times as much water was needed to tame its strength. If one is asked for
  dates by haters of foggy arithmetic, then it is enough to say that the last
  isolated attempt to run a cargo of brandy on the Essex coast failed in the
  year 1854; and that the trade was falling out of use a decade earlier.</p>

  <p>So it happened that my majority was celebrated from what was probably the
  very last tub of "run" spirits remaining in Essex&mdash;perhaps in all
  England; and the tale which never failed to season Roboshobery's moral
  discourse was on this occasion the tale of the run&mdash;one of the last
  successful ventures&mdash;which brought over this very tub and about four
  score more.</p>

  <p>"If I'd ha' been a man o' money, sir," the old man said, "I might ha'
  given you a birthday compliment of greater cost; but I count it might ha'
  been easier forgotten. An' if you want still more to remember it by, why,
  I'll tell 'ee this: the bringing over o' that very brandy was the cause of
  the very first teetotal meetin' in Essex. Nothin' to be proud of p'r'aps, but
  a curiosity; 'an 'tis my belief that if such stuff as this could ha' come
  over with no hindrance all along, there'd never ha' been a teetotal meetin'
  in Essex to this very day."</p>

  <p>Here I solemnly apologize for my old friend. His was an earlier age,
  before many of our modern morals had been invented, and before we had
  discovered how much more respectable we are than our fathers. At the same
  time, with the taste and scent of that ineffable white brandy present to my
  senses, I was mightily disposed to agree with his conjecture.</p>

  <p>"It was after the new coastguard was formed as that came over," the old
  man went on, "and it was mostly the new coastguard as helped to kill
  smuggling. It went on pretty well though, hereabout, for some years; we'd got
  a sleepy oad chief officer, a good deal too fat for his business, and Leigh
  windows were cleaned with Dutch gin right up to forty years ago. But just
  about this time there came a mighty smart an' knowin' chief-boatman this way,
  promoted from somewhere right off&mdash;Poole, I think they said. His name
  were Wicks&mdash;Archibald Wicks, to be complete&mdash;and he were so very
  mighty smart as to be very near as smart as he thought hisself, and that were
  saying a deal. He hadn't done with promotion either, had Master Archie Wicks,
  chief-boatman as he were. You see it were a time of changes in the sarvice,
  an' 'twas thought promotions might be made higher still for some men; they
  might be chief-officers, 'twas rumored, or anything; an' if such promotions
  were to come to pass Master Archie made up his mind to have one o' the first.
  If the chief-officer liked to go to sleep an' wait for his pension, Master
  Archie Wicks was the last to object; but he kept himself mighty jumpy up an'
  down the station, an' he tried a number of new dodges that sad upset a lot o'
  people hereabout, an' sent a good few tubs of <i>this</i> sort the wrong way.
  For one thing, he had a most astonishin' takin' way with the women. He was
  smart out an' in, an' he'd go any lengths to pump information.</p>

  <p>"Now at the time I'm talking of the last freighter about here who did
  anything large in this way was oad Tom Blyth. You've heard tell of
  'Hard-apple' Blyth, of Paglesham?"</p>

  <p>The legends of that famous smuggler, far back at the turn of the century,
  were familiar tales of my childhood. I had heard enough told of "Hard-apple"
  Blyth to fill a book.</p>

  <p>"Well, oad Tom Blyth were his nephew; so you see he come of pretty tough
  stock. Oad Tom were the last o' the big freighters hereabout, and this here
  brandy came in one of his last freights. There aren't no more o' the Blyths
  left now, except a darter, as were a young gal at the time.</p>

  <p>"Now one of Master Wicks's new dodges was to watch for the carriers,
  'stead o' the boats. You know what that 'ud mean, o' course. He'd let the
  watch off-shore go easy, an' he'd keep his eye on one or two o' the men as
  was certain to be took on to carry the tubs inland as soon as they were
  landed. Like as not one of 'em was an' informer. The dodge wasn't of great
  advantage except it were unexpected, you see. When you got your cargo ashore,
  fair an' easy, an' everything seemed going right, you got a bit less careful.
  An' so long as the preventive men kep' the carriers in sight, wherever they
  might be, the tubs must come to 'em, sooner or later. But then information's
  a thing as can travel both ways, as you may ha' noticed. I've told you the
  story o' the two Drakes, Eli an' Robin, an' the Black Badger, and you'll
  remember that one o' them brothers was a preventive man an' the other a
  smuggler, an' the arrangement worked very well for both of 'em. That was
  twenty years before the time I'm talkin' of now, an' George fourth were King;
  but there was still a bit o' the same sort o' thing goin'; an' if there
  wasn't brothers on the two sides there was one or two o' the coastguard as
  were pretty good friends with the smugglers. So, as I was sayin', information
  bein' a thing as can travel both ways, oad Tom Blyth an' the rest of 'em
  wasn't far behind Master Archie Wicks moves, however he made 'em.</p>

  <p>"Now when this little cargo was comin' in, Wicks was all on the look-out
  for the tub-carriers, but oad Tom was up sides with him from the beginnin'.
  The word was passed for carriers to meet at Pest'us corner after dark, an'
  there they did. An' there, sure enough was Mr. Archie Wicks, an' one or two
  of his men, lyin' low an' watchin', ready to follow wherever the carriers
  might go. Sure enough they did follow, an' the carriers, marchin' fair an'
  open along the main road, led 'em all the way to Prittywell, to the Spread
  Eagle, an' there they went in, the whole gang of 'em, an' into the clubroom.
  So Master Wicks, feelin' smarter every minute, sends off a man as hard as he
  could go to rouse up the chief-officer and bring in the patrols from all
  along Leigh an' Bemfleet. An' there he sat in hidin' an' waited, for he
  guessed the run would be tried near by, an' the carriers was just lyin' up in
  the Spread Eagle, till they was signalled for. An' while Mr. Wicks waited up
  by the Spread Eagle, the chief-officer and all the patrols waited down on
  Sou'church beach, to be handy as soon as the carriers made a move.</p>

  <p>"An' that was all that happened. All that happened. For the carriers they
  just sat down an' had a sing-song, an' called for what they pleased!"</p>

  <p>"And then went home?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, they scattered all out an' went home when the house closed at last.
  You can't follow forty men goin' forty different ways home to forty different
  places! An' not much good if you could. Golden Adams, that had charge o' the
  gang, and was chairman o' the sing-song, he come out first, an' called on Mr.
  Archie Wicks for a song&mdash;out in the road, at the top of his voice. So
  Mr. Wicks, a-lyin' there hidin' behind the ledge, tumbled to the swindle and
  sneaked off quiet enough, to make the best tale he could to the
  chief-officer. He guessed then, did Mr. Wicks, an' guessed right, that the
  carriers hadn't been wanted that night to carry off tubs at all, but just to
  carry off him an' the rest o' the coastguard to a place where they couldn't
  do no harm, while the cargo came ashore safe an' easy somewhere else. So the
  fust round of the fight was all agin Mr. Archie Wicks. The carriers, they
  spent a jolly evening, and Tom Blyth an' his boat's crew, they got their
  cargo in quiet and secret, and everybody was pleased except Mr. Archie Wicks
  an' the chief-officer, who hadn't been kep' out o' bed so late for years.</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Wicks wasn't done for yet. Not he. He knowed well enough the
  cargo had been landed safe, an' put somewhere. Consekence it were his
  business to find it. It were plain it couldn't ha' gone far, the carriers not
  havin' touched it, an' so he starts out to look for it in the
  neighborhood.</p>

  <p>"I told you oad Tom Blyth had a darter. Nell were her name, an' a very
  takin' sort o' gal she were to look at at that time. Different young chaps
  went a-courtin' to Nell Blyth at different times, but just then 'twere Joe
  Furber&mdash;a bit of a smuggler hisself, though a boat-builder in the main.
  Mr. Archie Wicks, so smart and knowin' among the gals as he were, was allus
  ready to pass the time o' day to Nell Blyth; and so, the next mornin' after
  the singsong at Prittywell, up goes Mr. Wicks, all so brave and gay in the
  Queen's uniform, to oad Tom Blyth's to fascinate his darter Nell. He'd took
  care to see oad Tom safe down at the Smack Inn first; and up went he, sure o'
  findin' Nell alone.</p>

  <p>"Nell weren't exactly alone, for Joe Furber were there, talking with Nell
  over the fence. But Mr. Archie Wicks were that clever an' free with his chaff
  he soon had poor young Joe dunted an' marthered altogether, an' sneakin' off
  alone, sulky an' beat out. An' then he turned on his most gallivashious
  gammick to young Nell, an' presently they were whisperin' an' laughin'
  together that thick you'd never guess there were such a party as poor young
  Joe Furber alive.</p>

  <p>"'Ah, well,' says Wicks, arter a bit, 'I'm off duty now an' when I'm off
  duty I can shut my eyes as well as another. Eh? You know!' An' he winks most
  engagin'. 'I can shut my eyes to <i>some</i> things when I ain't on duty, my
  dear, though not to a pretty face like yourn. Why, I was up at&mdash;well,
  never mind where, though I near let it out&mdash;I was up at a place the
  other day where they mixed me as stiff a noggin o' moonshine&mdash;ay,
  straight out o' the tub, too&mdash;as ever I hope to taste. Prime stuff it
  were; but bein' all in the way o' friendship, d'ye think I den't shut one
  eye? Eh? Ay, an' both on 'em! But I opened my mouth&mdash;an' mighty glad to
  open it again for liquor half as good, too! If there was anybody to try
  me.'</p>

  <p>"'An' <i>could</i> you take a drop now?' says Nell, pleased as Punch with
  her new beau. 'Could you? S'pose a friend were to offer it, quiet?'</p>

  <p>"'Could I?' says Archie Wicks, pleased as she was, though for another
  reason. 'Could I?' says he. 'Just you try me, my dear! Lord bless ye, I know
  well enough your dear old dad can give a friend a drop o' the proper stuff,
  or you for him! An' if I can't shut my eyes with such a nice gal as you
  about&mdash;well, I count I know which way to turn 'em, as a friend!'</p>

  <p>"Well, young Nell Blyth, bright an' gigglin', she took him into the
  keepin' room, an' she pulls out a big chest from the wall, an' slides the
  wainscot behind it. An' sure enough Mr. Archie Wicks <i>did</i> know which
  way to turn his eyes, an' there to see, behind the wainscot, rows an' rows o'
  new tubs&mdash;all packed snug as cockles behind the wall an' under the
  floor! This was what he'd come for, an' so mighty delighted was he to see it
  that it was hard work to stop an' take his drink. He did stop an' take it
  though. Nell Blyth pulled a plug from the nearest tub an' squibbed out a dram
  of&mdash;well, of that stuff you've been tryin' yourself, but forty year
  younger. An' Archie Wicks, when he'd a-watered it, he drinks most galliant to
  the prettiest gal in Essex, otherwise called Nell Blyth, an' carried it all
  off first rate, notwithstandin' he was longin' to run an' make the seizure.
  He did more than that, too. It struck him he'd like to take prisoners as well
  as goods, an' philanderin' about to know when he were to see Nell next, she
  let slip that her father was expectin' some friends after dark that same
  evenin' an' that she would be goin' out.</p>

  <p>"'Ah!' says Wicks, more satisfied with himself than he'd ever been before
  in his life, 'then we must put it off, my dear. I shall be on duty to-night!'
  An' that was about all the truth he'd spoken since breakfast.</p>

  <p>"He pretty well guessed what the evenin' meetin' meant, with the gal sent
  out o' the way, an' he made up his mind to wait an' have men and tubs
  together. An' so he did.</p>

  <p>"He promised the chief-officer a real catch this night, an' they fetched
  patrols an' boatmen in, very quiet, from all ways alongshore. They crep' up
  the hill by different ways an' lay down snug all round the house, waitin'.
  An' then Mr. Archie Wicks, bein' the smart man o' the gang, he crarled round
  by the yard to where he could peep in at the keepin'-room winder, where the
  light were.</p>

  <p>"'Twere all in good train, as he could see. There were oad Tom Blyth
  sittin' there with Martin Cox&mdash;a man Mr. Wicks wanted near as much as
  oad Tom hisself. They was a-sittin' by the table, with glasses, grinnin' an'
  chucklin' and talkin', and there were a tub, shameless an' open, on the table
  before 'em, with a turnpipe an' spigot in it. As he were peepin' there came
  somebody along the lane, an' presently up got oad Tom an' let in Jeff Cater
  by the front door.</p>

  <p>"Jeff sat down, an' oad Tom gets another glass for him an' fills it at the
  tub, with his back to Jeff as he did it. Wicks guessed he were after givin'
  him the drink neat, to make him cough, an' so 'twould seem. The stuff was
  about a hundred over proof, so you may guess what it 'ud be like without
  <i>any</i> water. Jeff took a gulp, innocent enough, an then began to cough
  an' spit into the fire, while the others sat an' laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"Then oad Tom let in Sim Bartrip, an' they played the same game on him.
  Sim nearly coughed hisself black in the face, though if you'd ha' knowed Sim
  an' his habits you'd ha' backed him to swallow it bilin'.</p>

  <p>"Then in comes Rob Sturt, an' they put the joke on him. Well, to make it
  short, half a dozen o' Tom's friends came in, countin' all, an' each one was
  made to cough most outrageous, while all the others as had been had in their
  turns sat an' enjoyed the fun.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Archie Wicks counted he'd seen enough, so he crep' back to the
  chief-officer an' reported. They waited a bit longer, but no more o' Tom
  Blyth's friends showed up, an' 'twere gettin' late. So the chief-officer
  wouldn't wait no longer thinkin' seven smugglers an 'a full cargo o' tubs
  prize enough. So he brings up his men close round the house, an' he an' Wicks
  goes and bangs hard at at the front door.</p>

  <p>"Oad Tom comes to the door with a candle. 'Good-evenin',' says oad
  Tom.</p>

  <p>"'Good-evenin'," says Wicks, shovin' his back agin the door while the
  chief-officer stepped in. 'We've just come on a little perfessional wisit,
  Mr. Blyth, an' it won't be any good you jumpin' through the winders or what
  not, 'cos the house is surrounded.'</p>

  <p>"'All right,' says oad Tom, 'what should I want to jump through winders
  for?'</p>

  <p>"'What for?' says Wicks, shovin' oad Tom before him into the keepin'-room.
  'What for? Why, what d'ye call this here little party?' The tub was gone from
  the table, but that was what he expected. 'What d'ye call this here little
  party?' says Wicks.</p>

  <p>"'This here's a teetotal meetin',' says oad Toni.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! so I should ha' guessed,' says Wicks. 'Here, Wilkins!' he sings out,
  'you an' two more o' you come an' pull out this chest.'</p>

  <p>"'What d'ye want to come a-movin' my furnitude about for?' says oad Tom
  Blyth, makin' to putt a bold face on it. 'There ain't nothen' o' yourn there!
  No, nor nothin' agin the law, nayther!'</p>

  <p>"'Lucky for you if there ain't,' says Wicks. An' with that he pulls back
  the wainscot, an' there lay the tubs all in rows, snug as peas in a pod, just
  as he'd seen in the mornin'.</p>

  <p>"'All right,' says oad Tom, seein' there was no more to be said. 'All
  right,' says he, 'I'll go quiet. But you don't want my friends.'</p>

  <p>"'Ha, ha! But we can't spare 'em yet!' says Wicks; for there wasn't a man
  of 'em that Wicks hadn't had his eye on for months. 'We'll adjourn this here
  teetotal meeting solid as it stands. Come along! One at a time, please
  whistle the rest in, Wilkins!'</p>

  <p>"An' so there went down the hill such a procession as ain't been seen
  since. There was the seven prisoners an' the tubs, an' all Leigh out in their
  night-rig to see the show. Master Archie Wicks was prancin' on the wind, like
  a promoted peacock in full flight, an' he pitched off the gammick of the
  teetotal meetin' left and right. In them days teetotal meetin's were things
  you only read about in the papers, up in Lancashire an' thereaway, an' the
  joke of a teetotal meetin' of oad smugglers here in Essex, sittin' round a
  cargo o' tubs, went through Leigh like fireworks.</p>

  <p>"When they was all safe in the Custom-'us at last, oad Tom Blyth ups and
  says: 'Well now, Mr. Wicks, you an' your men had better set about broachin'
  your 'lowance tub, for however it goes I admit you've earned it!'</p>

  <p>"In them days you see, when there was a seizure, one tub went to the men
  as a sort o' perquisite. I doubt it wouldn't be allowed now, but then 'twere
  quite the reg'lar thing. So Mr. Wicks, ready enough, rememberin' his mornin'
  dram, sticks a gimlet into the first tub that comes, and fills pannikins
  right an' left. But he never emptied that tub. Afore he'd gone down a dozen
  pannikins there was some of his men a-coughin' an' a-spittin as fast as any
  o' the smugglers up at Blyth's. 'Why, choke me blind!' roars the one as got
  his tongue first; 'it's WATER!'</p>

  <p>"An' that was just what it was&mdash;water, every tub of it! They had been
  full o' white brandy once, but there were plugged-up gimlet holes in every
  tub, an' nothin' but water inside 'em!</p>

  <p>"'Why,' said oad Tom Blyth, lookin' surprised, 'o' course, it's water.
  What did I tell ye? Den't I say it was a teetotal meetin'?'</p>

  <p>"'Course he did' sings out the other smugglers. 'An' you've been a-callin'
  it a teetotal meetin' yourself, at the top of your voice, all through Leigh
  town! What did ye expect to find if 'tweren't water, eh?'</p>

  <p>"'I dunno why me an' my friends hey been brought down here in this
  ill-convenient way,' says oad Tom very solemn, 'but I do know as I insist on
  these here tubs o' water bein' carried back to where they kim from!'</p>

  <p>"Well, well; I've seen a number o' fanteegs round these parts in my time,
  but in all ninety year I never heard such a dovercourt as there were over
  that teetotal meetin'. Wicks was glad to get a shove on to another station.
  Of course, you may guess the time hadn't been wasted while that teetotal
  meetin' was on, an' while all the preventive men for miles round were
  attendin' to it. The carriers had taken their evenin' off the night before,
  but this night it was their turn to work. Golden Adams captained 'em again,
  an' they whipped off the real tubs from wherever they were hid while the
  teetotal meetin' were in full blast. Two nights runnin' oad Tom Blyth had got
  all the coastguards in a crowd together just where it suited him best, an'
  finished up by makin' 'em the joke of half Essex."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," I said, "that something depended on Nell Blyth,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Nell Blyth," said Roboshobery, "were an obedient gal, an' more to it, she
  did what she were told with a proper gumption. You know her."</p>

  <p>"I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I count you do. She went past this here winder while I was
  talkin'."</p>

  <p>"What, old Mrs. Furber?"</p>

  <p>"What you'd call old, sir, no doubt, though she might be my darter. Joe
  Furber died ten year back."</p>

  <h3>Published under syndication, e.g., in <i>The Omaru Mail</i>, New Zealand,
  Mar 9, 1907</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. REGINALD DRINKWATER had rooms in the Temple. That was
  almost all of importance that could be said about Mr. Reginald Drinkwater,
  whose life had been wholly uneventful for the twenty-four years of it that
  had passed before he encountered this, his first adventure of a romantic
  complexion.</p>

  <p>Mr. Drinkwater had not been called to the bar&mdash;he had not even begun
  to read with that purpose; but he was here, at the Temple, quite convenient
  if ever he should definitely decide to take that step. In fact, he had
  literary leanings, and had long reasoned with himself that, if he should
  actually embrace the profession of letters, any time spent in preparing for
  the law would be wasted, and waste of time was a vice against which a
  literary man should guard himself with especial care.</p>

  <p>He had not actually produced any literary work, for that, as everybody
  knows, is not a thing to be rushed at. But he had taken the chambers once
  occupied by a novelist of great reputation, and had laid in a large stock of
  manuscript paper of the sort said to be used by Mr. Thomas Hardy, and a
  fountain pen having a testimonial from Mr. Hall Caine; so that there remained
  no obstacle to success, in case his final decision should set him in the
  direction of his inclinations. Meantime, he received from his mother in
  Bedfordshire a regular allowance which was quite sufficient for his quiet
  requirements, and he wisely reflected that so long as one refrained from
  committing oneself irrevocably to one or other profession one avoided the
  possibility of an error which might cause serious regret throughout the rest
  of one's career.</p>

  <p>Mr. Drinkwater's rooms had the advantage of a situation from which one
  looked into the windows, a few yards away, of the chambers of the great Buss,
  K.C. The two sets of rooms, in fact, adjoined at the back of next-door houses
  set at an angle, so that Reginald Drinkwater, were it not for the general
  decorum of his behavior and his particular reverence for his distinguished
  neighbor, might have peashot Buss, K.C., at short range, when the windows
  were a little open. Also, if Buss, K.C., had not been a very fat, stumpy
  little man, with very short arms, and if he and Reginald Drinkwater had been
  acquainted, they might have shaken hands across the sills of the two windows
  closest to the angle over the little yard below. This, indeed, was a
  neighborly courtesy of which Reginald had dreamed as a possibility in his
  future times of eminence. Meanwhile, what with the proximity of Buss, K.C.,
  and the literary associations of his own rooms, he felt himself rather
  eminent than otherwise, already.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he would say on the infrequent occasion of a friend's visit;
  "they are old Buss's rooms. Fine collection of old silver he's got there,
  too." Which looked almost as though Reginald were a familiar visitor of Buss,
  K.C.; though, in fact, he only knew of the fine old silver, as others did, by
  report, and from the newspaper accounts of auction sales at which the great
  Buss was a buyer.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Reginald Drinkwater's inactivity had so endured for a good while
  he conceived a grievance against his very comfortable circumstances, in that
  his life had been wholly empty of adventure. This, he told himself, was the
  reason that he had not as yet launched on a brilliant literary career; for he
  had heard on high authority that one could only write in the light of one's
  own actual experience. So he took to seeking adventure in the streets of
  London, where, he believed, from the teaching of many magazine stories, it
  was very readily encountered. But his luck was out, for after many attempts
  he was rewarded with nothing better than the purchase of a dummy pawn-ticket
  from a plausible young man in fetter Lane. It is possible that a naturally
  retiring disposition hindered Reginald's ambitions, since, after all, London
  is a strange and adventurous place enough, as he was at length convinced. For
  indeed his romance came at last.</p>

  <p>He had left his rooms one february afternoon, with the simple design of
  buying tobacco at a shop in fleet Street; and because it was to be so short
  an expedition he had merely locked his inner door and left his "oak" swung
  open. The "oak" and the inner door, it may be explained parenthetically,
  stood, as is usual, scarce two feet apart, and the former, a ponderous
  iron-strapped fabric, was only locked when the inmate was away from home, or,
  being in, desired no visitors.</p>

  <p>Reginald Drinkwater bought the tobacco he required, and strolled easily
  back up fleet Street with his purchase in his pocket and his ignoble
  condition in his mind. Here he walked, in the midst of six million
  romances&mdash;for he had read, and therefore believed, that every life held
  its own&mdash;and not only had he found no romance himself, but he could
  guess at none of those about him. So Reginald walked, puzzled and
  ill-content, unaware that his romance waited for him a hundred strides away,
  and was nearer with every step.</p>

  <p>He turned in at the Temple Gate and twisted left and right through the
  passages leading to his quarters, musing gloomily; and so he ascended the
  stairs, and reached his landing to perceive that his "oak" was standing much
  closer than he had left it. He swung it back, and stood amazed. For here was
  his romance.</p>

  <p>Crouching between the "oak" and the inner door, shrinking into the angle
  farthest from him, her lips parted and her eyes full of fear, was the most
  beautiful girl he had ever seen or ever wished to see.</p>

  <p>Her heavy veil was flung back from her now pale face, her eyes were black
  and large and appealing, and her skin, brilliantly clear, had the tone of
  ivory.</p>

  <p>"You will not hurt me?" she pleaded. "You are not an enemy?"</p>

  <p>Reginald, confounded by the vision before him, and too anxious to remove
  such an impression to be wholly coherent, stammered fervent denials. Except
  for the lady's own obvious terror he would have been a little frightened
  himself, for he was young and susceptible, and prone to nervousness in female
  society.</p>

  <p>"I am much afraid," she said. "I am pursued. You are not angry that I
  should hide in your doorway?"</p>

  <p>He protested, still with some confusion, that nothing was so far from his
  thoughts; and was adding that, on the contrary, he was ready and anxious to
  do anything on earth to save her, when she checked him with raised
  forefinger, and a head turned to listen.</p>

  <p>"Was not that a step?" she said. "Is there nobody else on the stairs?"</p>

  <p>They listened together, but there was no sound.</p>

  <p>"They are waiting, then," she said, "and watching to me&mdash;watching
  <i>for</i> me at the outside. Can I not go by another door?"</p>

  <p>There was no other door, he explained, and indeed there was no need for
  such an exit. If she would place herself under his protection he would be
  happy to see her safely&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No, no!" she interrupted; "you do not understand how bad it is. I should
  be followed&mdash;they would kill me somewhere else&mdash;and my brother, my
  dear brother! I must wait a little while. I think they do not know it is in
  this house I have come. You will be kind, sir, will you not? I have not one
  friend; and if you will let me stay in your room a little while, till it
  comes dark, I can escape, I think. You are very kind&mdash;will you let me
  stay a little while?"</p>

  <p>It might seem an odd request in ordinary; but the circumstances were far
  from ordinary now. To Reginald, who had met his adventure at last, they were
  stunning, bewildering. Could he possibly drive away a friendless
  girl&mdash;to meet the strange perils she feared, alone? Was he not rather
  conscious of a secret joy that the danger, whatever it was had driven her to
  his protecting arm? He turned the key in the inner door, and thrust it
  open.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are very kind, sir&mdash;so very kind," the stranger repeated as
  she entered; and it was only now that Reginald noticed that she said "vehry"
  and that her whole accent and manner were a little foreign. "You have saved
  me," she continued, still much agitated; "and my brother&mdash;especially you
  have saved my dear brother!"</p>

  <p>"Your brother?" repeated Reginald, with a doubtful look about the
  staircase as he closed the door. "Your brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;my dear brother. He is not here&mdash;he is hiding. That is why
  I am so afraid to be followed, for then they will find him. Oh, the wicked
  men! They are so very cruel!"</p>

  <p>The beautiful girl sank into a chair and buried her face in her hands.
  Reginald, his whole soul filled with indignation that the world could hold
  creatures so base as to put her to such distress, was tortured with
  helplessness. If only he could do something&mdash;if only the unknown enemy
  stood tangibly before him.</p>

  <p>Presently she looked up and spoke again. "Pardon me," she said; "I am very
  weak when I should be very strong. You are a kind friend, but I should not
  trouble you with these things. Perhaps I can go away. Can they see these
  windows from the street?"</p>

  <p>Reginald hastened to reassure her. The windows overlooked nothing but a
  private yard, to which there was no access from any public place.</p>

  <p>"You are really quite safe," he protested. "And if there is anything I can
  do&mdash;anything in the world&mdash;if I am not intruding on private
  affairs, and you will tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But her attention was fixed on the windows. "Perhaps," she said, "I could
  go that way, if the other houses have doors in other streets. There is no
  other door here, you say, but the windows would not be so difficult&mdash;to
  go out by that house."</p>

  <p>She nodded toward Mr. Buss's rooms. But, as Reginald explained, Mr. Buss
  was away, taking a fortnight on the Riviera, and the door of his chambers
  would be locked. At the same time it gave him a further sense of the
  desperate situation of this delicate girl, that she should for a moment
  contemplate an escape by the expedient of scrambling from one window to
  another across an angle of wall thirty feet above the yard. He strove again
  to reassure her.</p>

  <p>"That way is not possible," he said; "but you are really quite safe.
  Perhaps you have come from a country where the police are not&mdash;" She
  looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"From another country?" she said. "You know I am not English? And they say
  my English is so good! How quick and clever you are!"</p>

  <p>Never had flattery sounded so sweet in Reginald's ears. Indeed flattery
  was a thing to them singularly unfamiliar, so small was his acquaintance with
  the world.</p>

  <p>"Your English," he replied, "is splendid&mdash;beautiful! But I
  thought&mdash;I supposed&mdash;something suggested that you were a foreigner,
  and I wish to tell you that our London police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know&mdash;they are excellent," she interrupted. "Better, I hope,
  at least than those of my poor country, where they have allowed a terrible
  crime&mdash;a horrible crime&mdash;that has made the whole world
  shudder!"</p>

  <p>Reginald thought instantly of Portugal and the murder of the king and his
  son; for the newspapers had been clamorous with the crime for a week past.
  "Do you speak Portugal?" he asked tentatively.</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed!" she replied with a melancholy smile. "My poor country! It is
  wonderful that you should judge so well; it is good for me that you are my
  friend, and not my enemy! Do you guess also what is my trouble? Shall I tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the world that could interest Reginald Drinkwater
  half so much, and he said so, in something very near those terms. "Unless,"
  he added, "you would rather&mdash;rather not tell me."</p>

  <p>"If it does not trouble you&mdash;'bore' you, is it not?&mdash;I would
  much like to tell you," she said. "It is so good to trust to a good friend;
  and when you have been so kind to shelter me from my enemies it is only right
  that I should tell you why I have asked your help. There has been great
  trouble in my country, and my dear brother Luiz and I have escaped to
  England. You have heard of the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;of course. The late dictator also has left Portugal, I
  believe. You are not related to him?"</p>

  <p>"To him? To the oppressor? To the man who has caused everything?
  Never&mdash;that is not one of our misfortunes, I thank heaven. My dear
  brother was of the opposite party&mdash;the republicans."</p>

  <p>"I see; and was implicated, I suppose, in the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean in the horrible crime&mdash;the assassination of the poor
  king and the prince? Ah, never! You could never suppose it if you knew my
  brother Luiz&mdash;never! We are of good family, and my brother could have no
  part in such doings. That is why we are here, and in such trouble. There were
  bad men in the republican party as well as good; indeed the bad men gained a
  great ascendency, and it is by them that the king was assassinated. My
  brother opposed them in the party and they became his enemies. Because of
  that they nominated him to join with the others in the crime; he was to prove
  his constancy, they said. But instead he gave a warning, so that the
  assassins were obliged to change their plans. Have you read of it in the
  journals? You will see that they killed the poor king and the prince in the
  street, near the public offices. At first it was to be on the quay, when they
  landed; but of that my brother gave secret warning, and on the quay they were
  very carefully guarded. Why did they not guard them as carefully for the rest
  of the journey? I cannot say; but the thing happened, as now you know, and my
  brother and I fled to England to escape the vengeance of the republican
  committee, who knew of the warning he had sent, and who were angry that the
  queen and the other prince had not been killed too. You may read the
  journals, but you do not know what terrible things are going on in Lisbon,
  even now!"</p>

  <p>"But surely you are safe here!"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, our enemies followed us by a ship that left the day
  after our own. We have changed our lodgings twice, but to-day I have been
  followed by two men&mdash;men that I have seen in Lisbon. I was terrified,
  and could not guess what to do. I came into the gardens here from the street,
  and walked about in the narrow courtyards, but they still followed. I think I
  must have escaped them for a moment when I turned into this court; but I
  found that there was no way out, so I ran up these stairs; and when I heard
  you coming, I feared they must have seen me enter and were still pursuing me.
  I did not suppose it would be a friend&mdash;such a kind friend; if you will
  not be angry that I call you my friend?"</p>

  <p>To this, Reginald Drinkwater, flushing with delight and stammering with
  confusion, made a wild and random answer. "It is delightful to hear you say
  it," he said, continuing, "and I wish I could do more&mdash;much
  more&mdash;anything&mdash;to make you say it again. Surely I can help you in
  some other way&mdash;some more important way?"</p>

  <p>She smiled sadly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is very noble of you," she said; "but I think there is
  nothing&mdash;nothing at least that might not be dangerous, which I should
  have no right to ask of you."</p>

  <p>"But tell me what it is," protested Reginald vehemently, "and I will do
  it. Surely my knowledge of this country may be of use to strangers like you
  and your brother?"</p>

  <p>"I have been in England before," she said; "though, of course, you must
  understand your own country better than I. And perhaps&mdash;when I have told
  my brother of your kindness&mdash;perhaps he may know of some way in which
  you might help us, if you will let me remind you of your offer."</p>

  <p>"If you will only promise that, whatever it is you ask me, you will make
  me happy," declaimed Reginald, with enthusiasm. "Will you promise it?"</p>

  <p>"Senor," she began, looking up at his face&mdash;"but you have not yet
  told me your name."</p>

  <p>Reginald repeated it, with an odd feeling that it had become a duller and
  less imposing name since he had last seen it, painted on his oak, only a few
  minutes ago.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Reginald Drinkwater," she said&mdash;and at once the name became
  beautiful on her lips&mdash;"I will promise." She extended her hand. "I am
  Lucia da Silva."</p>

  <p>The light in the courtyard was grown dull and dusk in the short february
  afternoon. "Perhaps it will be safe to go now," she said, rising and bending
  to peer once more from the window. "If," she added, "if you will do one
  little thing for me. Will you go first and see if they are watching? There
  are two men, one rather tall, though not very, and one small and short; both
  dark men. They must not see me go."</p>

  <p>Reginald repeated that he was ready to do anything, but suggested, in the
  meantime, tea from his gas-stove. His visitor, however, begged, with a very
  pretty anxiety, to be excused. She must lose no more time, she said, for
  already her brother would be alarmed at her long absence. And so Reginald
  left her and descended the staircase to scout from the front door.</p>

  <p>As he went he was aware of somebody hurrying down before him on the lower
  flights; and when he emerged from the door he saw a man walking sharply away
  near the corner of the court. The man was alone, however, and though
  certainly not short, nor small, but stoutly built, was scarcely of a stature
  that anybody would call tall, being of about middle height. Reginald followed
  to the corner, and there watched while the stranger disappeared round the
  next, and his footsteps died away toward Middle Temple Lane. This would seem
  to have been merely a visitor leaving some of the lower rooms, and whoever he
  was, he was gone; so Reginald returned, looking out sharply as he walked.
  Nowhere was there a pair of lurking men&mdash;nowhere, indeed, a pair of men
  at all. A clerk or two hurrying home early, a tradesman's boy with a basket
  and a tuneless whistle, an old messenger with his badge, and nobody else;
  nobody hiding in doorways, nobody lounging. Clearly the chase must have been
  abandoned.</p>

  <p>So he returned with his report, and found the beautiful fugitive awaiting
  him in the doorway. Could she go? Was the way quite clear?</p>

  <p>Reginald Drinkwater took coat, gloves and stick, and the two went out
  together. From her description it seemed clear that she had entered the
  Temple by the Middle Temple Lane gate; so now Reginald made it a point of
  strategy to leave by way of Whitefriars, where he knew a cab could be found
  in a quiet street.</p>

  <p>The cab was found, and then Reginald met a certain disappointment. For
  Lucia would not permit him to accompany her for even part of the way.</p>

  <p>"You are most kind, but it is better&mdash;much better&mdash;that I go
  alone," was all she would say; but there was that in her manner which made it
  final.</p>

  <p>Reginald accepted his defeat. "Where shall I tell the man to drive?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>For a moment she hesitated, with an odd look of doubt, which Reginald
  found himself resenting. Then she said: "Perhaps I shall not drive all the
  way; it may be better not. Tell him to go first to farringdon Road."</p>

  <p>"And you will not forget your promise?"</p>

  <p>"To ask you for help? No&mdash;I shall not forget it. Perhaps I shall come
  quite soon&mdash;when I have talked with my brother."</p>

  <p>With that the cab was gone, and Reginald Drinkwater tried hard to realize,
  as he went home across King's Bench Walk in the dark, the visible fact that
  here indeed was romance and adventure after all, in workaday London, and
  himself in the midst of it.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">ON the next morning after the visit of the wonderful
  Portuguese, Reginald, his breakfast finished, took his daily morning stroll
  in fleet Street. He did this partly out of respect for fleet Street, and a
  feeling that he was in some vague way growing literary in its precincts, but
  chiefly because for an hour after breakfast Mrs. Churcher, the laundress,
  made his rooms unendurable with pails and brooms, and a constant
  perambulation of her unclean self, which was in theory presumed to result in
  an accession of cleanliness to the premises. He returned perhaps a trifle
  later than usual, but found Mrs. Churcher still in possession&mdash;waiting
  for him, in fact, at the door.</p>

  <p>"There's bin a young lady 'ere for to see you, sir," she announced, in
  that voice of greasy huskiness by which the Temple laundress is distinguished
  from the rest of her sex. "A foring young lady as give the name of Silver, or
  de Silver. She wouldn't wait, but she said p'r'aps she'd call agin, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did she say anything else?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; she didn't leave no other message."</p>

  <p>Reginald was angry with himself for his delay in fleet Street, and
  questioned further. The young lady had been gone, now, some twenty minutes or
  half an hour. No, she hadn't said anything in particular, beyond asking for
  him, and bringing in with her Mrs. Churcher's bunch of keys, which she had
  supposed to be Mr. Drinkwater's, left in the outer door by accident.</p>

  <p>Reginald had his lunch sent in, and kept within doors for the rest of the
  day; but he saw nothing of Lucia da Silva. After breakfast next morning he
  perceived, with uncommon serenity, that the weather was damp and foggy, and
  afforded some sort of excuse for hanging about in his rooms, or at farthest
  on the stairs and lobby, while Mrs. Churcher performed her daily rites. But
  he waited and watched in vain till Mrs. Churcher had been gone out an hour,
  and more.</p>

  <p>Then at last there was a timid tap at his door, which he opened instantly,
  to see Lucia before him.</p>

  <p>"I have come," she said, "only because I have made you a promise. Do you
  remember the promise?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do&mdash;that you would tell me if I could be in any way of
  service to you and your brother. Tell me, now, what I can do."</p>

  <p>"I think, perhaps, you might not like it."</p>

  <p>"If it will serve you&mdash;and your brother&mdash;I shall delight in it.
  I will do anything. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"They have discovered our lodgings&mdash;the men."</p>

  <p>"The men who were watching you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. How I do not know. Perhaps they followed the cab&mdash;perhaps some
  other way; who can tell? They have found us out again, and we must go; but
  they are watching us, and it is difficult."</p>

  <p>"Where will you go?"</p>

  <p>"That is for my brother to settle; but I think he has plans, if&mdash;if
  we have a friend&mdash;a devoted, noble friend who will help us. Will you be
  the noble friend?"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;I have promised. I will do anything. What is the
  plan?"</p>

  <p>"I will say what my brother thinks. We have been going out, my brother and
  I, every evening, in a cab, to dinner at a restaurant. Will you come with me
  to-night, instead of my brother?"</p>

  <p>Could there be a pleasanter deed of heroism? Reginald heard the proposal
  with perhaps as much relief as surprise, for this was an act of devotion that
  he was quite ready to perform every day of his life. "It will give me the
  greatest pleasure," he said. "Where shall I come for you?"</p>

  <p>"This is where we are staying," she replied, and handed him a card. It was
  that of a house&mdash;obviously a boarding-house&mdash;in a quiet square near
  the New River Head; a place that Reginald remembered to have seen in his
  wanderings in London, and to have noticed because of its contrast of
  character with the neighboring streets.</p>

  <p>"You must not come to the front door," she resumed, "as you will
  understand when I explain. There is a path behind the houses, with stables.
  Each house has a door in the garden wall, and you must come to the fourth,
  where I shall be waiting before six o'clock; let us say half-past five."</p>

  <p>"That will be early for dinner, won't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we need not go to dinner at once. Often my brother and I go out
  early. The house on the north side of the square, remember. Will you come? I
  must not wait here&mdash;my brother is expecting me. You <i>will</i>
  come?"</p>

  <p>Nothing should stop him, Reginald resolved, that left him with legs to
  stand on; and he said so, in more elegant terms. And even as he was gathering
  his wits to frame certain inquiries that should not seem to pry, she was
  gone, with a press of the hand and a glance from her black eyes that kept him
  vastly elated for ten minutes; at the end of which period it dawned on him,
  as it might have done before, that it must be intended that he should assume
  the character of Lucia's brother for the evening, together with the
  liabilities of that relationship, including any casual bullet that his
  enemies might consider a suitable token of their sentiments. With that his
  elation sensibly diminished, and it occurred to him that it was much
  pleasanter to listen to Lucia's praises of his magnanimity than to do
  anything to deserve them.</p>

  <p>Still, it was an adventure, and he was in for it beyond withdrawal;
  morever, the danger somehow did not affect him as very immediate. The design
  appeared fairly clear. He was to enter the house from the back unobserved,
  and to leave it from the front, so as to draw off the attention of the
  watchers. Then, while the house was free from their observation, Luiz da
  Silva would make his escape and find some other retreat. "You must not come
  to the front door," Lucia had said, "as you will understand when I explain."
  But she had explained nothing as yet, and no doubt meant to reserve
  explanations till his arrival; though the plan seemed clear enough.</p>

  <p>On the whole he decided that he must dress for dinner. He could not tell
  whether or not Luiz da Silva had brought a dress-suit with him, that being
  one of the things he had meant to ask; but it could make little difference,
  either way. So dress he did.</p>

  <p>The fog thickened during the day, and it was dark some time before the
  hour fixed. Reginald left his cab a street or two away, and walked the
  remaining distance. The square was not difficult to find, nor the pathway
  behind the garden wall; and as he reached the fourth of the doors it opened
  while his hand was raised to tap, and he could see Lucia's dim figure
  within.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she said, "do not speak now. It is <i>most</i> noble of you."</p>

  <p>She took his arm, led him in and quietly closed and fastened the door. The
  garden was a small enough space, but they traversed it slowly as well as
  noiselessly; and Reginald began to feel that this was something more like an
  adventure than any previous experience of his life. They climbed a short
  flight of stone steps, and entered the house by a door which stood ajar; and
  then she spoke again.</p>

  <p>"There is a cab waiting," she said. "Will you turn up your coat-collar? If
  you will do that, and pull your hat a little forward, you will look much like
  my brother."</p>

  <p>He did as he was bid, and they emerged into the dim light of the hall,
  with its feeble gas-jet.</p>

  <p>He could now see that Lucia was already prepared, with hat and cloak. She
  opened the front door.</p>

  <p>"I think they are at the corner of the square, to the left," she
  whispered. "Do not look in that direction, but come straight into the cab. We
  go to the Caf Royal."</p>

  <p>The door shut softly behind them, and Reginald, his eyes fixed rigidly on
  the cab, valiantly resisted a desperate impulse to plunge into it headlong,
  and descended the steps with nervous deliberation. Truly this was an
  adventure at last.</p>

  <p>He experienced a feeling of much relief when they were safely seated in
  the cab and bowling through the streets toward Bloomsbury; but he got little
  conversation from his companion, who seemed nervous and thoughtful. He
  ventured to doubt the possibility that they were being followed; but she
  assured him that she and her brother had been followed on just such an
  occasion on the previous evening, a little later, and surmised that the enemy
  must keep a cab within call. And to a suggestion that an arrival at the Caf
  Royal at six o'clock would be a little awkward she replied that there was a
  very particular reason for it, which her brother would explain in detail when
  he had the happiness of personally meeting Mr. Drinkwater, to whom he would
  be eternally grateful.</p>

  <p>Through Hart Street they turned into New Oxford Street, and so down
  Shaftesbury Avenue. As they neared Picadilly Circus she spoke again. "If you
  will pay the man through the roof-door," she said, "we shall not have to
  stand long when we alight."</p>

  <p>Reginald admired the mental alertness that could suggest this expedient to
  a foreigner in London, and complied with the suggestion; so that when the cab
  pulled up before the Caf Royal they lost no time in reaching the
  swing-doors. Reginald saw, with some apprehension, that another cab stopped a
  little way behind them though after all with so many other cabs about it
  might not be worth considering.</p>

  <p>The doors swung behind them, and Reginald felt a further accession of
  confidence. What an adventure!</p>

  <p>But here he encountered surprise and disappointment. For Lucia turned to
  him and said hurriedly: "Oh, Mr. Drinkwater, I can never repay you! How brave
  you are! I have been in terrible fear for you all the way. Perhaps I ought
  not to have brought you, but there was no other friend for my dear
  brother&mdash;the brother I love so well! Will you promise to stay here, and
  not show yourself outside till after dinner? Till nine o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;we must wait before dinner&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, oh, thank you!" she interrupted, seizing his hand. "I must
  leave you now&mdash;I must go at once to my brother. There is a side door
  here, I know, into a little dark street; I shall not be seen. I will see you,
  or write to you, very soon. Good-bye, my noble friend!"</p>

  <p>And with that she was gone, leaving Reginald dumb and blinking. So he
  'stood till it occurred to him that he was attracting notice; which indeed he
  was. Whereupon he stalked gloomily across the room and flung himself into a
  seat; and being impelled to do scmething desperate, he ordered absinthe,
  which he did not like, but which was the most desperate form of refreshment
  he could think of.</p>

  <p>He sat alone and glowered and smoked cigarettes for an hour and a half; a
  period of time which sufficed to relieve his disappointment, and arouse his
  interest in the very excellent dinner which was to follow. And the excellent
  dinner reconciled him to his circumstances so far that he began to
  congratulate himself on having very cleverly foiled a very desperate gang of
  conspirators. He fell to wondering when and how he should next hear of Lucia
  da Silva; and so, a little past nine o'clock, he made his way home on foot,
  rather better satisfied with himself, on the whole, that he had felt after
  any other dinner he could remember. For he had an idea that he had acquitted
  himself very well; and, indeed, it was a very jewel of an adventure.</p>

  <p>Once more next morning he endured the society of Mrs. Churcher after
  breakfast&mdash;the fog was even heavier, to-day&mdash;but there was no
  caller. None, indeed, till the afternoon, and then it was a messenger-boy,
  with a letter; a letter written on scented paper in violet ink, but scribbled
  so hurriedly that it was often difficult to separate words and sentences.
  This done, however, it read thus:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;My brother and I cannot thank you
  enough for your generous kindness last night, which, alas, did not avail so
  effectually as we had hoped. The watching enemy were, as you know, two, and
  it would seem that only one followed us, leaving the other, the small, short
  man, to watch and confront my brother. This led to something which has
  altered our plans and makes us ask you for one favor more. Will you do it? Do
  not refuse after such kindness as you have shown. Will you go with a cab this
  evening at about six to the house we have left and bring away a large box?
  Enclosed is a note for the landlady, who will give you the box, and will hand
  you a hasty note of instructions I have left. Do not stay to read that note
  till you are in the cab and safely away with the box, and do not let the cab
  stand at the house longer than you can help. Also do not mention our real
  name to the landlady&mdash;you will understand that we have been obliged to
  conceal it. This time you will go to the front door, of course. Send me a
  note by this messenger saying that you will do this without fail.<br>
  <br>
  Ever yours gratefully and hopefully,<br>
  LUCIA</p><br>

  <p>Here was more food for Reginald's romantic appetite, which was by no means
  sated yet, but rather sharpened by experience. He longed to learn what had
  happened as the result of the encounter of Luiz and his enemy, and how the
  plot stood now. So he sent by the messenger a hurried note that he would
  certainly and gladly do all that was asked of him, and addressed himself to
  preparations. Such an adventure!</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was within a very few minutes of six that Reginald's
  cab&mdash;this time a four-wheeler, because the box might be
  large&mdash;brought him once more to the house in Pentonville. There was some
  little difficulty in finding it, for the fog had been thickening all day.
  This he judged an advantage as regarded the removal of the boxa thing no
  doubt that would be better done unobserved.</p>

  <p>His knock brought to the door a very common-place general servant, who
  took the note, and presently returned with another, addressed in Lucia's
  handwriting, to himself. Then she led him into a side room and shortly
  indicated the box by a jerk of the hand and a suggestion that he would find
  it "pretty heavy."</p>

  <p>It was a larger box than he had expected, long and unwieldy, and more than
  he could carry by himself. So he called the cabman, and they found it no very
  easy carrying, together; the cabman, in fact, growling furiously.</p>

  <p>The box safely mounted on the roof, Reginald lost no time in entering the
  cab, giving the cabman the first direction for farringdon Road, that being
  the nearest main road he could think of at the moment. After an excruciating
  delay&mdash;the cabman was exasperatingly deliberate with his rug&mdash;they
  moved off, and Reginald pulled out his note of instructions. It was even more
  hurriedly scribbled, he noticed, than the letter he had received by the
  messenger-boy a few hours before, the words running on with scarcely a lift
  of the pen, and no punctuation at all. The streets were dark as well as
  foggy, and he could only catch a glimpse on the paper now and again as they
  passed a shop or an uncommonly bright street-lamp, and one or two of the more
  legible words started out and vanished again. "Waterloo Station" was clear,
  near the bottom, and higher up "trouble," "difficulty," and "remains." At
  this last word Reginald sat up with an awful shock. Remains? What was in that
  heavy box on the roof?</p>

  <p>At this moment the cab emerged into a street so full of lighted shops that
  the whole note became plain; separating words and sentences with some
  difficulty, this is what he read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Sorry to trouble, but difficulty with small man caused.
  Troublesome thing. We must remove remains in box. Trust you implicitly. Bring
  to York Road gate of Waterloo Station 6.30."</p><br>

  <p>What words can paint the consternation of Reginald Drinkwater as he read
  this note? "We must remove remains in box!" This, then, was the event that
  had altered their plans and caused them "to ask one favor more." The
  encounter in the fog between Luiz da Silva and his enemy had ended in the
  death of the small man, and here was he, Reginald Drinkwater, carrying the
  corpse across London in a cab!</p>

  <p>The callousness of the note, too! The "difficulty" with the small man had
  caused the trouble, and it&mdash;or he&mdash;was merely a "troublesome
  thing!" A truly Southern contempt of human life!</p>

  <p>As he sat, amazed and confounded, the cab pulled up in farringdon Road,
  and the driver, with growls from the box, invited further instructions.</p>

  <p>The interruption recalled Reginald to action. "The York Road gate of
  Waterloo Station," he said, "as quick as you can get there!"</p>

  <p>For, indeed, this was all he could do. They trusted him; he had accepted
  the trust and had given his word, though he had never guessed what it
  involved. And after all, he reflected, this was a different thing, far from
  murder; nothing but simple self-defence. Though that consideration somehow
  made very little difference to the horror of the long box on the roof and
  what it held.</p>

  <p>The cab crawled and thumped and clattered through the fog, and Reginald
  prayed for the fog to thicken and so hide the ghastly box from human sight.
  And thicken it did, so that after a martyrdom of stopping and starting and
  crawling through farringdon Road and Street, the vehicle emerged from Ludgate
  Circus to encounter an increasing blackness in New Bridge Street. On it
  crept, close by the curb, and presently was lost in an immensity of mist,
  wherein nothing could be seen but nebulous light in distant random spots.
  They were making across the end of Queen Victoria Street for Blackfriars
  Bridge.</p>

  <p>The voyage across this smoky ocean seemed to be the longest stretch of the
  interminable journey. Once or twice the lights of some other vehicle neared
  and faded again, and shouts came from invisible depths; but the traffic
  hereabout was sparse just now. Reginald had begun to consider the possibility
  that the cab was making circles among the multitudinous crossings of these
  regions, when suddenly the horse stumbled and fell in a heap.</p>

  <p>The cabman made one roll of it out of his rug and off the box, and was
  dimly visible hauling at his horse's head and clearly audible cursing its
  entire body. The horse, for its own part, seemed disposed to approve of the
  situation, and willingly to accept the opportunity for a prolonged rest.
  Blows and shouts, it would seem to reflect, were much the same, lying or
  standing, and lying was the easier posture.</p>

  <p>Reginald's terrors increased tenfold; there would be a crowd, and a
  policeman, and the long box would be hauled down under general observation;
  and in his disordered memory the thing seemed now to have looked so like a
  stumpy coffin that he wondered he had not suspected it at once. He must, at
  any rate, keep it from the eye of a policeman.</p>

  <p>He scrambled out, and addressed the cabman. "If your horse is long getting
  up," he said, "I'll have another cab. I'm in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"All right," replied the cabman, extending his palm. "I've 'ad enough of
  it, if you 'ave. 'E ain't a easy one to get up, once 'e's down, an' I b'lieve
  'is knees is cut. Gimme my fare."</p>

  <p>Reginald hastily produced half a crown, and stood as firmly as he could
  while the man shoved the horrible box into his arms, and then slung his end
  on the neighboring curb. Having done which the cabman turned his attention
  once more to his horse, leaving his late fare to wrestle his luggage across
  the pavement; for Reginald's immediate purpose was to elude the eye of the
  policeman who must inevitably arrive to inspect the recumbent horse.</p>

  <p>Plainly the cab had strayed in the wide space before Blackfriars Bridge,
  and wandered diagonally across the approach; for now Reginald perceived that
  he had landed on the footpath of the Victoria Embankment. He pushed the box,
  end over end, into the darkest available spot under the parapet, and peered
  out into the choking fog in search of another cab.</p>

  <p>But very soon he began to understand that he was attempting something near
  an impossibility. A passing light in the wide, dark road was the most that
  could be seen of any cab, and each dash from the curb which he made only
  revealed that the cab was engaged. He began to grow seriously alarmed. He
  could not carry the thing&mdash;indeed he began to experience a growing
  repugnance to touch it or go near it&mdash;and there seemed to be positively
  no means of getting it to Waterloo. Moreover, the time appointed was already
  long overpast, and it was near seven.</p>

  <p>As he stood so, distractedly staring at the lights in the fog, a slow
  footstep approached, and a tall policeman came suddenly upon him out of the
  gloom, looking into his face as he passed&mdash;looking, as it seemed to
  Reginald's uneasy perceptions, with an eye of inquiry and deep suspicion.
  Fortunately, the man saw nothing of the box lying close under the parapet,
  and vanished as suddenly as he had appeared, leaving Reginald in an agony of
  fear. What if the policeman had seen the box, and had asked questions? How
  account for his possession of the corpse of an unknown foreigner? Plainly
  something must be done, and at once.</p>

  <p>His first impulse, as soon as the policeman was gone, was to take to his
  heels, simply. But then he remembered the river, so close to hand. The plain
  object of Lucia and her brother must be to dispose of the body, somehow; and
  possibly by this time they had fled, alarmed at his non-arrival. In any case
  there was no visible means of bringing them the box, and he must act on his
  own account, before that policeman returned on his beat. He took one stealthy
  glance about him, raised an end of the box against the parapet, and with a
  great effort lifted the other end and pushed the thing forward till it
  balanced on the coping. Then with a final desperate shove he sent it tumbling
  into the black abyss before him, and ran his hardest.</p>

  <p>He soon found it needful to check his pace, however, and narrowly averted
  a collision with a tree as it was. He found that he had taken the direction
  along the Embankment, away from Blackfriars. That being so he must go over
  Waterloo Bridge to inform Lucia of the fate of the box, if she were still
  there. As he went he grew calmer, and presently saw, by aid of a lamp, that
  it was five minutes past seven. He crossed the road warily at the
  best-lighted place he could find, and made his best pace to keep his
  appointment.</p>

  <p>That dreary tramp seemed a week of groping hours, and he found himself
  doubting his watch when it indicated, in the light of the public-house at the
  corner of York Road, that he was little more than an hour late. He hastened
  on, and was barely emerging from the blackness beneath the railway-bridge
  when his arm was seized above the elbow, and Lucia stood before him.</p>

  <p>"Where is it? The box?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"It's all right&mdash;I've&mdash;I've got rid of it; I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Got rid of it? What d'you mean?" Surprise, alarm, and sharp suspicion
  were harsh in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Pitched it into the river. That was all I could do, you see,
  with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pitched it into the river?" Her voice rose to a sort of hushed
  scream.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The cab broke down, and I had to get rid of the corpse somehow, and
  so&mdash;and so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Corpse? What corpse?"</p>

  <p>"In the box&mdash;the short man; the remains. It had to be got
  rid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She snatched at his arm again and shook it. "Do you mean to tell me," she
  hissed in his face, "that you've thrown that box into the river?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, certainly!"</p>

  <p>What followed Reginald will always find it difficult to describe, even if
  he should ever wish to remember it, which is doubtful. He was aware of a
  sudden torrent of a language which he was sure was not Portuguese, since he
  had heard it frequently at the Islington Cattle Market. Then something hard
  of Lucia's&mdash;he could scarcely believe it was her fist took him suddenly
  on the left ear, and the lady herself, her skirts snatched up in her hands,
  vanished into the fog at a bolt, leaving him dumb and gasping, as well as a
  little deaf&mdash;on the left side.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT evening in his rooms, amazed 'and bewildered, Reginald
  Drinkwater pulled once again from his pocket the note of instructions he had
  received at Pentonville. The thing was most hastily scribbled, as though it
  were all one sentence; most of the words ran on without a break till they
  reached the end of the line, and yet the meaning seemed quite clear. The
  punctuation he had supplied himself, and now he could see no better
  arrangement. "We must remove remains in box." That was plain enough;
  certainly plain enough. And then, suddenly, as by a flash of inspiration, he
  saw the thing in quite a different reading. The word "caused" ended the first
  line, and "troublesome thing" began the second. But hereabout the words were
  all joined, and if only the "some" were tacked on to "thing" instead of
  "trouble"&mdash;and there was no reason why it should not be&mdash;the whole
  meaning was changed. "Difficulty with small man caused trouble," it would
  read, and then, "something we must remove remains in box." Something we must
  remove remains in box!</p>

  <p>Mouth and eyes and fingers all opened together, and the paper fell between
  his knees as this amazing explanation presented itself. Then there was no
  body! No one was killed! He had only been sent to Pentonville because
  "something we must remove remains in box!" Great heavens! what had he flung
  into the river?</p>

  <p>He picked the paper up and read it once more, and the new reading stared
  at him plainer than ever. What had he done? He could understand now, dimly,
  that Lucia probably had reasons for her amazement and anger. But then that
  language&mdash;worse, that punch! What did it all mean?</p>

  <p>He gasped and wondered for two days, and then Buss, K.C., returned from
  his little holiday. Reginald's attention was attracted to his neighbor by a
  sudden howl and a series of appalling bellows, accompanied by frantic
  rushings to and fro, bangings of doors and shoutings on stairs. Then, after
  an interval, Reginald, still curious, perceived the head of an inspector of
  police at the nearest open window of Buss, K.C. And after another interval
  that same inspector presented himself at the rooms of Mr. Reginald
  Drinkwater. Mr. Buss's rooms had been entered and robbed during his absence
  from town, and the entry had been effected, in the judgment of the police,
  through the window in the corner, by some person crossing from Mr.
  Drinkwater's window. Of course the inspector didn't wish to say or do
  anything unpleasant, and no doubt investigations would put things in a
  different light; but for the present&mdash;!</p>

  <p>And so it came about that the Drinkwater romance was first poured into the
  unenthusiastic ears of the police; and that some of the most valuable of the
  Buss silver was dragged and dived for in the Thames near Blackfriars under
  the joint direction of the police and Mr. Drink-water himself.</p>

  <p>"Yes," observed the inspector, some days after his first visit, when Mr.
  Drinkwater's <i>bona fides</i> had been quite established&mdash;"yes, sir,
  it's just their sort o' job. Lucia da Silva she called herself this time, did
  she? It's a very pretty name. She's had a lot of 'em at one time or another,
  but I never heard that before. She's been Spanish an' she's been Italian an'
  she's been Greek&mdash;this Portuguese dodge is fresh; nothing like being
  up-to-date, I suppose. Bit of a sheeny, really, I believe. Yes. It's
  <i>she's</i> the smart one; he's got ideas, but he funks the work. You see
  she did it all in this job. Came to try and fit keys to your door when you
  were out&mdash;that was when you surprised her. Her fright was real enough,
  of course, when you turned up, but she was smart enough to turn it to her own
  account. You see, Mr. Buss's doors would be a harder job than
  yours&mdash;he's had patent locks put on 'em, inside and out, an' no doubt
  they knew it.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful quick she was with her yarn, wasn't she? She's a topper. Knew
  how to adapt it, too, you see. It was when she got you safe off in the Caf
  Royal they did it. Did it together, with the keys they'd made from the waxes
  she got from your laundress's bunch when she came the day before, and you
  were out. These women shouldn't leave keys about like that, though they
  always do. Yes, she did it smart all through&mdash;I always admired that gal.
  Not least smart was getting <i>you</i> to bring the stuff along after they'd
  left their lodgings. I think I know why that was. It was him funking it
  again&mdash;he's always a funk, fortunately, in these jobs. Thought we'd got
  an eye on the house, which we hadn't, because it's quite a respectable place,
  and we'd lost sight of him lately. But see the neatness of it, getting
  <i>you</i> to carry the stuff. If we <i>had</i> been watching the house, or
  if you'd' been stopped on the way, <i>you'd</i> have been in the soup, not
  them. Found with the goods on you, you see, sir, and the burglary done from
  your rooms! Eh? Oh, very neat. But there&mdash;I've got one joke against her,
  when I find her; that note that queered the game. That <i>is</i> rich.
  'Remains,' eh? 'Remains in box!' We must explain that to her, when we get
  her! 'Remains,' eh? Ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" repeated Reginald&mdash;a sickly echo. "Yes, quite a
  joke&mdash;against her!"</p>
