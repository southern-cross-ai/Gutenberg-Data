<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><i>The existence of this volume is due, not to my own
initiative, but to that of my enterprising kinsman and publisher,
<b>Mr. Grant Richards</b>. He it was who first suggested to me the
idea that it might be worth while to collect in one volume such of
my scattered short stories as I judged to possess most permanent
value. In order for us to carry out his plan, however, it became
necessary to obtain the friendly co-operation of <b>Messrs. Chatto
and Windus</b>, to whom belong the copyrights of my three previous
volumes of Collected Tales, published respectively under the titles
of <b>Strange Stories</b>, <b>The Beckoning Hand</b>, and <b>Ivan
Greet's Masterpiece</b>, some pieces from each of which series I
desired to include in the present selection. Fortunately,
<b>Messrs. Chatto and Windus</b> fell in with our scheme with that
kindness which I have learned to expect from them in all their
dealings; and an arrangement was thus effected by which I am
enabled to present here certain stories from their three volumes.
Together with these I have arranged an equal number of tales from
other sources&mdash;most of which have hitherto appeared in
periodicals only, while one is entirely new, never having been
before printed.</i></p>
<p><i>I may perhaps be permitted, without blame, to seize the
occasion of this selected edition in order to offer a few
<b>bibliographical remarks</b> on the origin and inception of my
short stories. For many years after I took to the trade of author,
I confined my writings to scientific or quasi-scientific subjects,
having indeed little or no idea that I possessed in the germ the
faculty of story-telling. But on one occasion, about the year 1880
(if I recollect aright), wishing to contribute an article to
<b>Belgravia</b> on the improbability of a man's being able to
recognise a ghost as such, even if he saw one, and the
impossibility of his being able to apply any test of credibility to
an apparition's statements, I ventured for the better development
of my subject to throw the argument into the form of a narrative. I
did not regard this narrative as a story: I looked upon it merely
as a convenient method of displaying a scientific truth. However,
the gods and <b>Mr. Chatto</b> thought otherwise. For, a month or
two later, <b>Mr. Chatto</b> wrote to ask me if I could supply
<b>Belgravia</b> with 'another story.' Not a little surprised at
this request, I sat down, like an obedient workman, and tried to
write one at my employer's bidding. I distrusted my own ability to
do so, it is true: but <b>Mr. Chatto</b>, I thought, being a dealer
in the article, must know better than I; and I was far too poor a
craftsman at that time to refuse any reasonable offer of
employment. So I did my best, <b>crassa Minerva</b>. To my great
astonishment, my second story was accepted and printed like my
first: the curious in such matters (if there be any) will find them
both in the volume entitled <b>Strange Stories</b> (published by
<b>Messrs. Chatto and Windus</b>) under the headings of 'Our
Scientific Observations on a Ghost,' and 'My New Year's Eve among
the Mummies.'</i></p>
<p><i>From that day forward for some years I continued at <b>Mr.
Chatto's</b> request to supply short stories from time to time to
<b>Belgravia</b>, a magazine which he then edited. But I did not
regard these my tentative tales in any serious light: and, fearing
that they might stand in the way of such little scientific
reputation as I possessed, I published them all under the prudent
pseudonym of <b>J. Arbuthnot Wilson</b>. I do not know that I
should have got much further on the downward path which leads to
fiction, had it not been for the intervention of my good friend the
late <b>Mr. James Payn</b>. When he undertook the editorship of the
<b>Cornhill</b>, he determined at first to turn it into a magazine
of stories only, and began to look about him for fresh blood to
press into the service. Among the writers he then secured (I seem
to recollect) were <b>Dr. Conan Doyle</b> and <b>Mr. Stanley
Weyman</b>. Now, under <b>Mr. Leslie Stephen's</b> editorship, I
had been accustomed to contribute to the <b>Cornhill</b> occasional
papers on scientific subjects: and one morning, by an odd
coincidence, I received two notes simultaneously from the new
editor. The first of them was addressed to me by my real name; in
it, <b>Mr. Payn</b> courteously but briefly informed me that he
returned one such scientific article which I had sent for his
consideration, as he had determined in future to exclude everything
but fiction from the magazine&mdash;a decision which he afterwards
saw reason to rescind. The second letter, forwarded through
<b>Messrs. Chatto and Windus</b>, was addressed to me under my
assumed name of <b>J. Arbuthnot Wilson</b>, and begged that unknown
person to submit to <b>Mr. Payn</b> a few stories 'like your
admirable <b>Mr. Chung</b>.' Now, this <b>Mr. Chung</b> was a tale
of a Chinese <b>attaché</b> in England, who fell in love with an
English girl: I had first printed it, like the others of that date,
in the pages of <b>Belgravia</b>. (Later on, it was included in the
volume of <b>Strange Stories</b>, where any hypothetical explorer
may still find it.) Till that moment, I had never regarded my
excursions into fiction in any serious light, setting down <b>Mr.
Chatto's</b> liking for them to that gentleman's amiability, or
else to his well-known scientific <b>penchant</b>. But when a
novelist like <b>Mr. James Payn</b> spoke well of my
work&mdash;nay, more; desired to secure it for his practically new
magazine&mdash;I began to think there might really be something in
my stories worth following up by a more serious effort.</i></p>
<p><i>Thus encouraged, I launched out upon what I venture to think
was the first voyage ever made in our time into the Romance of the
Clash of Races&mdash;since so much exploited. I wrote two short
stories, 'The Reverend John Creedy' and 'The Curate of Churnside,'
both of which I sent to <b>Mr. Payn</b>, in response to his
invitation. He was kind enough to like them, and they were duly
published in the <b>Cornhill</b>. At the time, their reception was
disappointing: but gradually, since then, I have learned from
incidental remarks that many people read them and remembered them;
indeed, I have reason to think that these first serious efforts of
mine at telling a story were among my most successful attempts at
the art of fiction. Once launched as a professional story-teller by
this fortuitous combination of circumstances, I continued at the
trade, and wrote a number of tales for the <b>Cornhill</b> and
other magazines, up till the year 1884, when I collected a few of
them into a volume of <b>Strange Stories</b>, under my own name,
for the first time casting off the veil of anonymity or the cloak
of a pseudonym. In the same year I also began my career as a
novelist properly so called, by producing my first long novel,
<b>Philistia</b>.</i></p>
<p><i>From that date forward, I have gone on writing a great many
stories, long and short, whose name is Legion. Out of the whole
number of shorter ones, I now select the present set, as
illustrating best in different keys the various types of tale to
which I have devoted myself.</i></p>
<p><i>Four of these pieces have already appeared as reprints in the
volume entitled <b>Strange Stories</b>&mdash;namely, 'The Reverend
John Creedy,' from the <b>Cornhill</b>; 'The Child of the
Phalanstery,' from <b>Belgravia</b>; and 'The Curate of Churnside'
and 'The Backslider,' both from the <b>Cornhill</b>. One, 'John
Cann's Treasure,' also from the <b>Cornhill</b>, has been reprinted
in the volume called <b>The Beckoning Hand</b>. Two more have been
included in the collection entitled <b>Ivan Greet's
Masterpiece</b>: namely, 'Ivan Greet's Masterpiece' itself,
originally issued as a Christmas number of the <b>Graphic</b>; and
'The Abbé's Repentance,' which first saw the light in the
<b>Contemporary Review</b>. The remainder have never appeared
before, except in periodicals. The Headpiece, 'A Confidential
Communication,' came out in the <b>Sketch</b>. So did 'Frasine's
First Communion.' 'Wolverden Tower' formed a Christmas number of
the <b>Illustrated London News</b>. 'Janet's Nemesis' was
contributed to the <b>Pall Mall Magazine</b>. The Intermezzo,
'Langalula,' is from the <b>Speaker</b>, as is also the Tailpiece,
'A Matter of Standpoint.' 'Cecca's Lover' made his original bow in
<b>Longman's Magazine</b>. Finally, 'The Churchwarden's Brother' is
entirely new, never having appeared in public before on this or any
other stage. I have to thank the editors and proprietors of the
various periodicals above enumerated for their courteous permission
to present afresh the contributions to their respective
pages.</i></p>
<p><i>I set forth this little Collection of Tales in all humility,
and with no small diffidence. In an age so prolific in high genius
as our own, I know how hard it is for mere modest industry to catch
the ear of a too pampered public. I shall be amply content if our
masters permit me to pick up the crumbs that fall from the table of
the Hardys, the Kiplings, the Merediths, and the Wellses.</i></p>

<h2><a name="HEADPIECE" id="HEADPIECE"></a>HEADPIECE</h2>
<h3>A CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION</h3>
<p>Ah, he <i>was</i> a mean-spirited beggar, that fellow Sibthorpe!
As mean-spirited a beggar as ever <i>I</i> come across. Yes, that's
who I mean; that's him; the fellow as was murdered. I s'pose you'd
call it murdered, now I come to think of it. But, Lord, he was such
a mean-spirited chap, he wouldn't be enough to 'ang a dog for!</p>
<p>'Charitable,' eh? 'A distinguished philanthropist!' Well, I
can't say as <i>I</i> ever thought much of his philanthropy. He was
always down on them as tries to earn a honest livin' tramping about
the country. Know how he was murdered? Well, yes, I should think I
did! I'm just about the fust livin' authority in England on that
there subjeck.</p>
<p>Well, come to that, I don't mind if I do tell you. You're a
straight sort of chap, you are. You're one of these 'ere
politicals. I ain't afraid o' trustin' you. You're not one of them
as 'ud peach on a pal to 'andle a reward o' fifty guineas. And it's
a rum story too. But mind, I tell you what I tell you in
confidence. There's not another chap in all this prison I'd tell as
much to.</p>
<p>I'd always knowed 'im, since I was no bigger nor that. Old fool
he was too; down on public-'ouses an' races an' such, an' always
ready to subscribe to anything for the elevation of the people.
People don't want to be elevated, says I; silly pack o' modern
new-fangled rubbish. I sticks to the public-'ouses.</p>
<p>Well, we was dead-beat that day. Liz an' me had tramped along
all the way from Aldershot. Last we come to the black lane by the
pine-trees after you've crossed the heath. Loneliest spot just
there that I know in England. The Gibbet 'Ill's to the right, where
the men was hung in chains; and the copse is to the left, where we
'ad that little brush one time with the keepers. Liz sat down on
the heather&mdash;she was dead-beat, she was&mdash;behind a clump
o' fuzz. An' I lay down beside 'er.</p>
<p>She was a good 'un, Liz. She followed me down through thick and
thin like a good 'un. No bloomin' nonsense about Liz, I can tell
you. I always liked 'er. And though I <i>did</i> get into a row
with her that mornin' afore she died, and kick 'er about the ribs a
bit&mdash;but, there, I'm a-digressin', as the parson put it; and
the jury brought it in 'Death by misadventure.' That was a narrow
squeak that time. I didn't think I'd swing for 'er, 'cause she 'it
me fust; but I did think they'd 'a' brought it in somethin' like
manslaughter.</p>
<p>However, as I say, I'm a-digressin' from the story. It was like
this with old Sibthorpe. We was a-lyin' under the gorse bushes,
wonderin' to ourselves 'ow we'd raise the wind for a
drink&mdash;for we was both of us just about as dry as they make
'em&mdash;when suddenly round the corner, with his 'at in his 'and,
and his white 'air a-blowin' round his 'ead, like an old fool as he
was, who should come but the doctor. Liz looks at me, and I looks
at Liz.</p>
<p>'It's that bloomin' old idjit, Dr. Sibthorpe,' says she. 'He
give me a week once.'</p>
<p>I 'ad my knife in my 'and. I looks at it, like this: then I
looks up at Liz. She laughs and nods at me. 'E couldn't see neither
of us behind the bush of fuzz. 'Arst 'im fust,' says Liz, low; 'an'
then, if he don't fork out&mdash;&mdash;' She drawed her finger so,
right across her throat, an' smiles. Oh, the <i>was</i> a good
'un!</p>
<p>Well, up I goes an' begins, reglar asker's style. 'You ain't got
a copper about you, sir,' says I, whinin' like, 'as you could give
a pore man as has tramped, without a bit or a sup, all the way from
Aldershot?'</p>
<p>'E looks at me an' smiles&mdash;the mean old hypocrite! 'I never
give to tramps,' says 'e. Then 'e looks at me agin. 'I know you,'
says 'e. 'You've been up afore me often.'</p>
<p>'An' I knows <i>you</i>,' says I, drawin' the knife; 'an' I
knows where you keeps your money. An' I ain't a-goin' to be up
afore you agin, not if <i>I</i> knows it.' An', with that, I rushes
up, an' just goes at him blind with it.</p>
<p>Well, he fought like a good 'un for his life, that he did. You
wouldn't 'a' thought the old fool had so much fight left in him.
But Liz stuck to me like a brick, an' we got him down at last, an'
I gave him one or two about the 'ead as quieted him. It was mostly
kickin'&mdash;no blood to speak of. Then we dragged him aside among
the heather, and covered him up a little bit, an' made all tidy on
the road where we'd stuck him.</p>
<p>'Take his watch, Liz,' says I.</p>
<p>Well, would you believe it? He was a magistrate for the county,
and lived in the 'All, an' was 'eld the richest gentleman for ten
mile about; but when Liz fished out his watch, what sort do you
think it was? I give you my word for it, a common Waterbury!</p>
<p>'You put that back, Liz,' says I. 'Put that back in the old
fool's pocket. Don't go carryin' it about to incriminate yourself,
free, gratis, for nothin',' says I; 'it ain't worth sixpence.'</p>
<p>''Ave you his purse?' says she.</p>
<p>'Yes, I 'ave,' says I. 'An' when we gets round the corner, we'll
see what's in it.'</p>
<p>Well, so we did; an', would you believe it, agin, when we come
to look, there was two ha'penny stamps and a lock of a child's
'air; and, s'elp me taters, that's all that was in it!</p>
<p>'It ain't right,' says I, 'for people to go about takin' in
other people with regard to their wealth,' says I. ''Ere's this
bloomin' old fool 'as misled us into s'posing he was the richest
man in all the county, and not a penny in his purse! It's downright
dishonest.'</p>
<p>Liz snatches it from me, an' turns it inside out. But it worn't
no good. Not another thing in it!</p>
<p>Well, she looks at me, an' I looks at her. 'You fool,' says she,
'to get us both into a blindfold scrape like this, without knowin'
whether or not he'd got the money about him! I guess we'll both
swing for it.'</p>
<p>'You told me to,' says I.</p>
<p>'That's a lie,' says she. Liz was always free-spoken.</p>
<p>I took her by the throat. 'Young woman,' says I, 'you keep a
civil tongue in your 'ead,' says I, 'or, by George, you'll follow
him!'</p>
<p>Then we looks at one another agin; and the humour of it comes
over us&mdash;I was always one as 'ad a sense of humour&mdash;an'
we busts out laughin'.</p>
<p>'Sold!' says I.</p>
<p>'Sold!' says Liz, half cryin'.</p>
<p>An' we both sat down, an' looked agin at one another like a pair
of born idjits.</p>
<p>Then it come over us gradjally what a pack o' fools that there
man had made of us. The longer I thought of it, the angrier it made
me. The mean-spirited old blackguard! To be walking around the
roads without a penny upon him!</p>
<p>'You go back, Liz,' says I, 'an' put that purse where we found
it, in his weskit pocket.'</p>
<p>Liz looked at me an' crouched. 'I daren't,' says she, cowerin'.
She was beginning to get frightened.</p>
<p>I took her by the 'air. 'By George!' says I, 'if you
don't&mdash;&mdash;' An' she saw I meant it.</p>
<p>Well, back she crawled, rather than walked, all shiverin'; an',
as for me, I set there on the heather an' watched her. By an' by,
she crawled round again. 'Done it?' says I. An' Liz, lookin' white
as a sheet, says, 'Yes, I done it.'</p>
<p>'I wasn't goin' to carry that about with me,' says I, 'for the
coppers to cop me. Now they'll put it in the papers: "Deceased's
watch and purse were found on him untouched, so that robbery was
clearly not the motive of the crime." Git up, Liz, you fool, an'
come along on with me.'</p>
<p>Up she got, an' come along. We crept down the valley, all tired
as we was, without a sup to drink; an' we reached the high-road,
all in among the bracken, an' we walked together as far as
Godalming. That was all. The p'lice set it down to revenge, an'
suspected the farmers. But, ever since then, every time I remember
it, it makes me 'ot with rage to think a man o' property like him
should go walking the roads, takin' other people in, without a
farden in his pocket. It was the biggest disappointment ever
<i>I</i> had in my life. To think I might 'a' swung for an old fool
like that! A great philanthropist, indeed! Why, he'd ought to 'a'
been ashamed o' himself. Not one blessed farden! I tell you, it
always makes me 'ot to think o' it.</p>

<h3>THE REVEREND JOHN CREEDY</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>'On Sunday next, the 14th inst., the Reverend John Creedy, B.A.,
of Magdalen College, Oxford, will preach in Walton Magna Church on
behalf of the Gold Coast Mission.' Not a very startling
announcement that; and yet, simple as it looks, it stirred Ethel
Berry's soul to its inmost depths. For Ethel had been brought up by
her Aunt Emily to look upon foreign missions as the one thing on
earth worth living for and thinking about; and the Reverend John
Creedy, B.A., had a missionary history of his own, strange enough
even in these strange days of queer juxtapositions between utter
savagery and advanced civilisation.</p>
<p>'Only think,' she said to her aunt, as they read the placard on
the schoolhouse board, 'he's a real African negro, the vicar says,
taken from a slaver on the Gold Coast when he was a child, and
brought to England to be educated. He's been to Oxford and got a
degree; and now he's going out again to Africa to convert his own
people. And he's coming down to the vicar's to stay on
Wednesday.'</p>
<p>'It's my belief,' said old Uncle James, Aunt Emily's brother,
the superannuated skipper, 'that he'd much better stop in England
for ever. I've been a good bit on the Coast myself in my time,
after palm oil and such, and my opinion is that a nigger's a nigger
anywhere, but he's a sight less of a nigger in England than out
yonder in Africa. Take him to England, and you make a gentleman of
him: send him home again, and the nigger comes out at once in spite
of you.'</p>
<p>'Oh, James,' Aunt Emily put in, 'how can you talk such
unchristianlike talk, setting yourself up against missions, when we
know that all the nations of the earth are made of one blood?'</p>
<p>'I've always lived a Christian life myself, Emily,' answered
Uncle James, 'though I have cruised a good bit on the Coast, too,
which is against it, certainly; but I take it a nigger's a nigger
whatever you do with him. The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, the
Scripture says, nor the leopard his spots, and a nigger he'll be to
the end of his days; you mark my words, Emily.'</p>
<p>On Wednesday, in due course, the Reverend John Creedy arrived at
the vicarage, and much curiosity there was throughout the village
of Walton Magna that week to see this curious new thing&mdash;a
coal-black parson. Next day, Thursday, an almost equally unusual
event occurred to Ethel Berry; for, to her great surprise, she got
a little note in the morning inviting her up to a tennis-party at
the vicarage the same afternoon. Now, though the vicar called on
Aunt Emily often enough, and accepted her help readily for school
feasts and other village festivities of the milder sort, the Berrys
were hardly up to that level of society which is commonly invited
to the parson's lawn tennis parties. And the reason why Ethel was
asked on this particular Thursday must be traced to a certain pious
conspiracy between the vicar and the secretary of the Gold Coast
Evangelistic Society. When those two eminent missionary advocates
had met a fortnight before at Exeter Hall, the secretary had
represented to the vicar the desirability of young John Creedy's
taking to himself an English wife before his departure. 'It will
steady him, and keep him right on the Coast,' he said, 'and it will
give him importance in the eyes of the natives as well.' Whereto
the vicar responded that he knew exactly the right girl to suit the
place in his own parish, and that by a providential conjunction she
already took a deep interest in foreign missions. So these two good
men conspired in all innocence of heart to sell poor Ethel into
African slavery; and the vicar had asked John Creedy down to Walton
Magna on purpose to meet her.</p>
<p>That afternoon Ethel put on her pretty sateen and her witching
little white hat, with two natural dog-roses pinned on one side,
and went pleased and proud up to the vicarage. The Reverend John
Creedy was there, not in full clerical costume, but arrayed in
tennis flannels, with only a loose white tie beneath his flap
collar to mark his newly acquired spiritual dignity. He was a
comely-looking negro enough, full-blooded, but not too broad-faced
nor painfully African in type; and when he was playing tennis his
athletic quick limbs and his really handsome build took away
greatly from the general impression of an inferior race. His voice
was of the ordinary Oxford type, open, pleasant, and refined, with
a certain easy-going air of natural gentility, hardly marred by
just the faintest tinge of the thick negro blur in the broad
vowels. When he talked to Ethel&mdash;and the vicar's wife took
good care that they should talk together a great deal&mdash;his
conversation was of a sort that she seldom heard at Walton Magna.
It was full of London and Oxford; of boat-races at Iffley and
cricket matches at Lord's; of people and books whose very names
Ethel had never heard&mdash;one of them was a Mr. Mill, she
thought, and another a Mr. Aristotle,&mdash;but which she felt
vaguely to be one step higher in the intellectual scale than her
own level. Then his friends, to whom he alluded casually, not like
one who airs his grand acquaintances, were such very distinguished
people. There was a real live lord, apparently, at the same college
with him, and he spoke of a young baronet whose estate lay close by
as plain 'Harrington of Christchurch,' without any 'Sir
Arthur'&mdash;a thing which even the vicar himself would hardly
have ventured to do. She knew that he was learned too; as a matter
of fact, he had taken a fair second class in Greats at Oxford; and
he could talk delightfully of poetry and novels. To say the truth,
John Creedy, in spite of his black face, dazzled poor Ethel, for he
was more of a scholar and a gentleman than anybody with whom she
had ever before had the chance of conversing on equal terms.</p>
<p>When Ethel turned the course of talk to Africa, the young parson
was equally eloquent and fascinating. He didn't care about leaving
England for many reasons, but he would be glad to do something for
his poor brethren. He was enthusiastic about missions; that was a
common interest; and he was so anxious to raise and improve the
condition of his fellow-negroes, that Ethel couldn't help feeling
what a noble thing it was of him thus to sacrifice himself,
cultivated gentleman as he was, in an African jungle, for his
heathen countrymen. Altogether, she went home from the tennis-court
that afternoon thoroughly overcome by John Creedy's personality.
She didn't for a moment think of falling in love with him&mdash;a
certain indescribable race-instinct set up an impassable barrier
against that&mdash;but she admired him and was interested in him in
a way that she had never yet felt with any other man.</p>
<p>As for John Creedy, he was naturally charmed with Ethel. In the
first place, he would have been charmed with any English girl who
took so much interest in himself and his plans; for, like all
negroes, he was frankly egotistical, and delighted to find a white
lady who seemed to treat him as a superior being. But, in the
second place, Ethel was really a charming, simple English village
lassie, with sweet little manners and a delicious blush, who might
have impressed a far less susceptible man than the young negro
parson. So, whatever Ethel felt, John Creedy felt himself truly in
love. And, after all, John Creedy was in all essentials an educated
English gentleman, with the same chivalrous feelings towards a
pretty and attractive girl that every English gentleman ought to
have.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning Aunt Emily and Ethel went to the parish
church, and the Reverend John Creedy preached the expected sermon.
It was almost his first&mdash;sounded like a trial trip, Uncle
James muttered,&mdash;but it was undoubtedly what connoisseurs
describe as an admirable discourse. John Creedy was free from any
tinge of nervousness&mdash;negroes never know what that word
means,&mdash;and he spoke fervently, eloquently, and with much
power of manner about the necessity for a Gold Coast Mission.
Perhaps there was really nothing very original or striking in what
he said, but his way of saying it was impressive and vigorous. The
negro, like many other lower races, has the faculty of speech
largely developed, and John Creedy had been noted as one of the
readiest and most fluent talkers at the Oxford Union debates. When
he enlarged upon the need for workers, the need for help, the need
for succour and sympathy in the great task of evangelisation, Aunt
Emily and Ethel forgot his black hands, stretched out open-palmed
towards the people, and felt only their hearts stirred within them
by the eloquence and enthusiasm of that appealing gesture.</p>
<p>The end of it all was, that instead of a week John Creedy
stopped for two months at Walton Magna, and during all that time he
saw a great deal of Ethel. Before the end of the first fortnight he
walked out one afternoon along the river-bank with her, and talked
earnestly of his expected mission.</p>
<p>'Miss Berry,' he said, as they sat to rest awhile on the parapet
of the little bridge by the weeping willows, 'I don't mind going to
Africa, but I can't bear going all alone. I am to have a station
entirely by myself up the Ancobra river, where I shall see no other
Christian face from year's end to year's end. I wish I could have
had some one to accompany me.'</p>
<p>'You will be very lonely,' Ethel answered. 'I wish indeed you
could have some companionship.'</p>
<p>'Do you really?' John Creedy went on. 'It is not good for man to
live alone; he wants a helpmate. Oh, Miss Ethel, may I venture to
hope that perhaps, if I can try to deserve you, you will be
mine?'</p>
<p>Ethel started in dismay. Mr. Creedy had been very attentive,
very kind, and she had liked to hear him talk, and had encouraged
his coming, but she was hardly prepared for this. The nameless
something in our blood recoiled at it. The proposal stunned her,
and she said nothing but 'Oh, Mr. Creedy, how <i>can</i> you say
such a thing?'</p>
<p>John Creedy saw the shadow on her face, the unintentional
dilatation of her delicate nostrils, the faint puckering at the
corner of her lips, and knew with a negro's quick instinct of
face-reading what it all meant. 'Oh, Miss Ethel,' he said, with a
touch of genuine bitterness in his tone, 'don't you, too, despise
us. I won't ask you for any answer now; I don't want an answer. But
I want you to think it over. Do think it over, and consider whether
you can ever love me. I won't press the matter on you; I won't
insult you by importunity; but I will tell you just this once, and
once for all, what I feel. I love you, and I shall always love you,
whatever you answer me now. I know it would cost you a wrench to
take me, a greater wrench than to take the least and the
unworthiest of your own people. But if you can only get over that
first wrench, I can promise earnestly and faithfully to love you as
well as ever woman yet was loved. Don't say anything now,' he went
on, as he saw she was going to open her mouth again: 'wait and
think it over; pray it over; and if you can't see your way straight
before you when I ask you this day fortnight "Yes or No," answer me
"No," and I give you my word of honour as a gentleman I will never
speak to you of the matter again. But I shall carry your picture
written on my heart to my grave.'</p>
<p>And Ethel knew that he was speaking from his very soul.</p>
<p>When she went home, she took Aunt Emily up into her little
bedroom, over the porch where the dog-roses grew, and told her all
about it. Aunt Emily cried and sobbed as if her heart would break,
but she saw only one answer from the first. 'It is a gate opened to
you, my darling,' she said: 'I shall break my heart over it, Ethel,
but it is a gate opened.' And though she felt that all the light
would be gone out of her life if Ethel went, she worked with her
might from that moment forth to induce Ethel to marry John Creedy
and go to Africa. Poor soul! she acted faithfully up to her
lights.</p>
<p>As for Uncle James, he looked at the matter very differently.
'Her instinct is against it,' he said stoutly, 'and our instincts
wasn't put in our hearts for nothing. They're meant to be a guide
and a light to us in these dark questions. No white girl ought to
marry a black man, even if he is a parson. It ain't natural: our
instinct is again it. A white man may marry a black woman if he
likes: I don't say anything again him, though I don't say I'd do it
myself, not for any money. But a white woman to marry a black man,
why, it makes our blood rise, you know, 'specially if you've
happened to have cruised worth speaking of along the Coast.'</p>
<p>But the vicar and the vicar's wife were charmed with the
prospect of success, and spoke seriously to Ethel about it. It was
a call, they thought, and Ethel oughtn't to disregard it. They had
argued themselves out of those wholesome race instincts that Uncle
James so rightly valued, and they were eager to argue Ethel out of
them too. What could the poor girl do? Her aunt and the vicar on
the one hand, and John Creedy on the other, were too much between
them for her native feelings. At the end of the fortnight John
Creedy asked her his simple question 'Yes or No,' and half against
her will she answered 'Yes.' John Creedy took her hand delicately
in his and fervidly kissed the very tips of her fingers; something
within him told him he must not kiss her lips. She started at the
kiss, but she said nothing. John Creedy noticed the start, and said
within himself, 'I shall so love and cherish her that I will make
her love me in spite of my black skin.' For with all the faults of
his negro nature, John Creedy was at heart an earnest and
affectionate man after his kind.</p>
<p>And Ethel really did, to some extent, love him already. It was
such a strange mixture of feeling. From one point of view he was a
gentleman by position, a clergyman, a man of learning and of piety;
and from this point of view Ethel was not only satisfied, but even
proud of him. For the rest, she took him as some good Catholics
take the veil&mdash;from a sense of the call. And so, before the
two months were out, Ethel Berry had married John Creedy, and both
started together at once for Southampton, on their way to Axim.
Aunt Emily cried, and hoped they might be blessed in their new
work, but Uncle James never lost his misgivings about the effect of
Africa upon a born African. 'Instincts is a great thing,' he said,
with a shake of his head, as he saw the West Coast mail steam
slowly down Southampton Water, 'and when he gets among his own
people his instincts will surely get the better of him, as safe as
my name is James Berry.'</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The little mission bungalow at Butabué, a wooden shed neatly
thatched with fan palms, had been built and garnished by the native
catechist from Axim and his wife before the arrival of the
missionaries, so that Ethel found a habitable dwelling ready for
her at the end of her long boat journey up the rapid stream of the
Ancobra. There the strangely matched pair settled down quietly
enough to their work of teaching and catechising, for the mission
had already been started by the native evangelist, and many of the
people were fairly ready to hear and accept the new religion. For
the first ten or twelve months Ethel's letters home were full of
praise and love for dear John. Now that she had come to know him
well, she wondered she had ever feared to marry him. No husband was
ever so tender, so gentle, so considerate. He nursed her in all her
little ailments like a woman; she leaned on him as a wife leans on
the strong arm of her husband. And then he was so clever, so wise,
so learned. Her only grief was that she feared she was not and
would never be good enough for him. Yet it was well for her that
they were living so entirely away from all white society at
Butabué, for there she had nobody with whom to contrast John but
the half-clad savages around them. Judged by the light of that
startling contrast, good John Creedy, with his cultivated ways and
gentle manners, seemed like an Englishman indeed.</p>
<p>John Creedy, for his part, thought no less well of his Ethel. He
was tenderly respectful to her; more distant, perhaps, than is
usual between husband and wife, even in the first months of
marriage, but that was due to his innate delicacy of feeling, which
made him half unconsciously recognise the depth of the gulf that
still divided them. He cherished her like some saintly thing, too
sacred for the common world. Yet Ethel was his helper in all his
work, so cheerful under the necessary privations of their life, so
ready to put up with bananas and cassava balls, so apt at kneading
plantain paste, so willing to learn from the negro women all the
mysteries of mixing agadey, cankey, and koko pudding. No tropical
heat seemed to put her out of temper; even the horrible country
fever itself she bore with such gentle resignation, John Creedy
felt in his heart of hearts that he would willingly give up his
life for her, and that it would be but a small sacrifice for so
sweet a creature.</p>
<p>One day, shortly after their arrival at Butabué, John Creedy
began talking in English to the catechist about the best way of
setting to work to learn the native language. He had left the
country when he was nine years old, he said, and had forgotten all
about it. The catechist answered him quickly in a Fantee phrase.
John Creedy looked amazed and started.</p>
<p>'What does he say?' asked Ethel.</p>
<p>'He says that I shall soon learn if only I listen; but the
curious thing is, Ethie, that I understand him.'</p>
<p>'It has come back to you, John, that's all. You are so quick at
languages, and now you hear it again you remember it.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps so,' said the missionary slowly, 'but I have never
recalled a word of it for all these years. I wonder if it will all
come back to me.'</p>
<p>'Of course it will, dear,' said Ethel; 'you know, things come to
you so easily in that way. You almost learned Portuguese while we
were coming out from hearing those Benguela people.'</p>
<p>And so it did come back, sure enough. Before John Creedy had
been six weeks at Butabué, he could talk Fantee as fluently as any
of the natives around him. After all, he was nine years old when he
was taken to England, and it was no great wonder that he should
recollect the language he had heard in his childhood till that age.
Still, he himself noticed rather uneasily that every phrase and
word, down to the very heathen charms and prayers of his infancy,
came back to him now with startling vividness and without an
effort.</p>
<p>Four months after their arrival John saw one day a tall and ugly
negro woman, in the scanty native dress, standing near the rude
market-place, where the Butabué butchers killed and sold their
reeking goat-meat. Ethel saw him start again; and with a terrible
foreboding in her heart, she could not help asking him why he
started. 'I can't tell you, Ethie,' he said piteously; 'for
heaven's sake, don't press me. I want to spare you.' But Ethel
would hear. 'Is it your mother, John?' she asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>'No, thank Heaven, not my mother, Ethie,' he answered her, with
something like pallor on his dark cheek, 'not my mother; but I
remember the woman.'</p>
<p>'A relative?'</p>
<p>'Oh, Ethie, don't press me. Yes, my mother's sister. I remember
her years ago. Let us say no more about it.' And Ethel, looking at
that gaunt and squalid savage woman, shuddered in her heart and
said no more.</p>
<p>Slowly, as time went on, however, Ethel began to notice a
strange shade of change coming over John's ideas and remarks about
the negroes. At first he had been shocked and distressed at their
heathendom and savagery; but the more he saw of it, the more he
seemed to find it natural enough in their position, and even in a
sort of way to sympathise with it or apologise for it. One morning,
a month or two later, he spoke to her voluntarily of his father. He
had never done so in England. 'I can remember,' he said, 'he was a
chief, a great chief. He had many wives, and my mother was one. He
was beaten in war by Kola, and I was taken prisoner. But he had a
fine palace at Kwantah, and many fan-bearers.' Ethel observed with
a faint terror that he seemed to speak with pride and complacency
of his father's chieftaincy. She shuddered again and wondered. Was
the West African instinct getting the upper hand in him over the
Christian gentleman?</p>
<p>When the dries were over, and the koko-harvest gathered, the
negroes held a grand feast. John had preached in the open air to
some of the market-people in the morning, and in the evening he was
sitting in the hut with Ethel, waiting till the catechist and his
wife should come in to prayers, for they carried out their
accustomed ceremony decorously, even there, every night and
morning. Suddenly they heard the din of savage music out of doors,
and the noise of a great crowd laughing and shouting down the
street. John listened, and listened with deepening attention.
'Don't you hear it, Ethie?' he cried. 'It's the tom-toms. I know
what it means. It's the harvest battle-feast!'</p>
<p>'How hideous!' said Ethel, shrinking back.</p>
<p>'Don't be afraid, dearest,' John said, smiling at her. 'It means
no harm. It's only the people amusing themselves.' And he began to
keep time to the tom-toms rapidly with the palms of his hands.</p>
<p>The din drew nearer, and John grew more evidently excited at
every step. 'Don't you hear, Ethie?' he said again. 'It's the
Salonga. What inspiriting music! It's like a drum and fife band;
it's like the bagpipes; it's like a military march. By Jove, it
compels one to dance!' And he got up as he spoke, in English
clerical dress (for he wore clerical dress even at Butabué), and
began capering in a sort of hornpipe round the tiny room.</p>
<p>'Oh, John, don't!' cried Ethel. 'Suppose the catechist were to
come in!'</p>
<p>But John's blood was up. 'Look here,' he said excitedly, 'it
goes like this. Here you hold your matchlock out; here you fire;
here you charge with cutlasses; here you hack them down before you;
here you hold up your enemy's head in your hands, and here you kick
it off among the women. Oh, it's grand!' There was a terrible light
in his black eyes as he spoke, and a terrible trembling in his
clenched black hands.</p>
<p>'John,' cried Ethel, in an agony of horror, 'it isn't Christian,
it isn't human, it isn't worthy of you. I can never, never love you
if you do such a thing again.'</p>
<p>In a moment John's face changed and his hand fell as if she had
stabbed him. 'Ethie,' he said in a low voice, creeping back to her
like a whipped spaniel,&mdash;'Ethie, my darling, my own soul, my
beloved; what <i>have</i> I done? Oh, heavens, I will never listen
to the accursed thing again! Oh, Ethie, for heaven's sake, for
mercy's sake, forgive me!'</p>
<p>Ethel laid her hand, trembling, on his head. John sank upon his
knees before her, and bowed himself down with his head between his
arms, like one staggered and penitent. Ethel lifted him gently, and
at that moment the catechist and his wife came in. John stood up
firmly, took down his Bible and Prayer Book, and read through
evening prayer at once in his usual impressive tone. In one moment
he had changed back again from the Fantee savage to the decorous
Oxford clergyman.</p>
<p>It was only a week later that Ethel, hunting about in the little
storeroom, happened to notice a stout wooden box carefully covered
up. She opened the lid with some difficulty, for it was fastened
down with a native lock, and to her horror she found inside it a
surreptitious keg of raw negro rum. She took the keg out, put it
conspicuously in the midst of the storeroom, and said nothing. That
night she heard John in the jungle behind the yard, and looking
out, she saw dimly that he was hacking the keg to pieces vehemently
with an axe. After that he was even kinder and tenderer to her than
usual for the next week; but Ethel vaguely remembered that once or
twice before he had seemed a little odd in his manner, and that it
was on those days that she had seen gleams of the savage nature
peeping through. Perhaps, she thought, with a shiver, his
civilisation was only a veneer, and a glass of raw rum or so was
enough to wash it off.</p>
<p>Twelve months after their first arrival, Ethel came home very
feverish one evening from her girls' school, and found John gone
from the hut. Searching about in the room for the quinine bottle,
she came once more upon a rum-keg, and this time it was empty. A
nameless terror drove her into the little bedroom. There, on the
bed, torn into a hundred shreds, lay John Creedy's black coat and
European clothing. The room whirled around her; and though she had
never heard of such a thing before, the terrible truth flashed
across her bewildered mind like a hideous dream. She went out,
alone, at night, as she had never done before since she came to
Africa, into the broad lane between the huts which constituted the
chief street of Butabué. So far away from home, so utterly solitary
among all those black faces, so sick at heart with that burning and
devouring horror! She reeled and staggered down the street, not
knowing how or where she went, till at the end, beneath the two
tall date-palms, she saw lights flashing and heard the noise of
shouts and laughter. A group of natives, men and women together,
were dancing and howling round a dancing and howling negro. The
central figure was dressed in the native fashion, with arms and
legs bare, and he was shouting a loud song at the top of his voice
in the Fantee language, while he shook a tom-tom. There was a
huskiness as of drink in his throat, and his steps were unsteady
and doubtful. Great heavens! could that reeling, shrieking black
savage be John Creedy?</p>
<p>Yes, instinct had gained the day over civilisation; the savage
in John Creedy had broken out; he had torn up his English clothes
and, in West African parlance, 'had gone Fantee.' Ethel gazed at
him, white with horror&mdash;stood still and gazed, and never cried
nor fainted, nor said a word. The crowd of negroes divided to right
and left, and John Creedy saw his wife standing there like a marble
figure. With one awful cry he came to himself again, and rushed to
her side. She did not repel him, as he expected; she did not speak;
she was mute and cold like a corpse, not like a living woman. He
took her up in his strong arms, laid her head on his shoulder, and
carried her home through the long line of thatched huts, erect and
steady as when he first walked up the aisle of Walton Magna church.
Then he laid her down gently on the bed, and called the wife of the
catechist. 'She has the fever,' he said in Fantee. 'Sit by
her.'</p>
<p>The catechist's wife looked at her, and said, 'Yes; the yellow
fever.'</p>
<p>And so she had. Even before she saw John the fever had been upon
her, and that awful revelation had brought it out suddenly in full
force. She lay unconscious upon the bed, her eyes open, staring
ghastilly, but not a trace of colour in her cheek nor a sign of
life upon her face.</p>
<p>John Creedy wrote a few words upon a piece of paper, which he
folded in his hand, gave a few directions in Fantee to the woman at
the bedside, and then hurried out like one on fire into the
darkness outside.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It was thirty miles through the jungle by a native trackway to
the nearest mission station at Effuenta. There were two Methodist
missionaries stationed there, John Creedy knew, for he had gone
round by boat more than once to see them. When he first came to
Africa he could no more have found his way across the neck of the
river fork by that tangled jungle track than he could have flown
bodily over the top of the cocoa palms; but now, half naked,
barefooted, and inspired with an overpowering emotion, he threaded
his path through the darkness among the creepers and lianas of the
forest in true African fashion. Stooping here, creeping on all
fours there, running in the open at full speed anon, he never once
stopped to draw breath till he had covered the whole thirty miles,
and knocked in the early dawn at the door of the mission hut at
Effuenta.</p>
<p>One of the missionaries opened the barred door cautiously. 'What
do you want?' he asked in Fantee of the bare-legged savage, who
stood crouching by the threshold.</p>
<p>'I bring a message from Missionary John Creedy,' the bare-legged
savage answered, also in Fantee. 'He wants European clothes.'</p>
<p>'Has he sent a letter?' asked the missionary.</p>
<p>John Creedy took the folded piece of paper from his palm. The
missionary read it. It told him in a few words how the Butabué
people had pillaged John's hut at night and stolen his clothing,
and how he could not go outside his door till he got some European
dress again.</p>
<p>'This is strange,' said the missionary. 'Brother Felton died
three days ago of the fever. You can take his clothes to Brother
Creedy, if you will.'</p>
<p>The bare-limbed savage nodded acquiescence. The missionary
looked hard at him, and fancied he had seen his face before, but he
never even for a moment suspected that he was speaking to John
Creedy himself.</p>
<p>A bundle was soon made of dead Brother Felton's clothes, and the
bare-limbed man took it in his arms and prepared to run back again
the whole way to Butabué.</p>
<p>'You have had nothing to eat,' said the lonely missionary.
'Won't you take something to help you on your way?'</p>
<p>'Give me some plantain paste,' answered John Creedy. 'I can eat
it as I go.' And when they gave it him he forgot himself for the
moment, and answered 'Thank you' in English. The missionary stared,
but thought it was only a single phrase that he had picked up at
Butabué, and that he was anxious, negro-fashion, to air his
knowledge.</p>
<p>Back through the jungle, with the bundle in his arms, John
Creedy wormed his way once more, like a snake or a tiger, never
pausing or halting on the road till he found himself again in the
open space outside the village of Butabué. There he stayed a while,
and behind a clump of wild ginger he opened the bundle and arrayed
himself once more from head to foot in English clerical dress. That
done, too proud to slink, he walked bold and erect down the main
alley, and quietly entered his own hut. It was high noon, the
baking high noon of Africa, as he did so.</p>
<p>Ethel lay unconscious still upon the bed. The negro woman
crouched, half asleep after her night's watching, at the foot. John
Creedy looked at his watch, which stood hard by on the little
wooden table. 'Sixty miles in fourteen hours,' he said aloud.
'Better time by a great deal than when we walked from Oxford to the
White Horse eighteen months since.' And then he sat down silently
by Ethel's bedside.</p>
<p>'Has she moved her eyes?' he asked the negress.</p>
<p>'Never, John Creedy,' answered the woman. Till last night she
had always called him 'Master.'</p>
<p>He watched the lifeless face for an hour or two. There was no
change in it till about four o'clock; then Ethel's eyes began to
alter their expression. He saw the dilated pupils contract a
little, and knew that consciousness was gradually returning.</p>
<p>In a moment more she looked round at him and gave a little cry.
'John,' she exclaimed, with a sort of awakening hopefulness in her
voice, 'where on earth did you get those clothes?'</p>
<p>'These clothes?' he answered softly. 'Why, you must be wandering
in your mind, Ethie dearest, to ask such a question now. At
Standen's, in the High at Oxford, my darling.' And he passed his
black hand gently across her loose hair.</p>
<p>Ethel gave a great cry of joy. 'Then it was a dream, a horrid
dream, John, or a terrible mistake? Oh, John, say it was a
dream!'</p>
<p>John drew his hand across his forehead slowly. 'Ethie darling,'
he said, 'you are wandering, I'm afraid. You have a bad fever. I
don't know what you mean.'</p>
<p>'Then you didn't tear them up, and wear a Fantee dress, and
dance with a tom-tom down the street? Oh, John!'</p>
<p>'Oh, Ethel! No. What a terrible delirium you must have had!'</p>
<p>'It is all well,' she said. 'I don't mind if I die now.' And she
sank back exhausted into a sort of feverish sleep.</p>
<p>'John Creedy,' said the black catechist's wife solemnly, in
Fantee, 'you will have to answer for that lie to a dying woman with
your soul!'</p>
<p>'<i>My</i> soul!' cried John Creedy passionately, smiting both
breasts with his clenched fists. '<i>My</i> soul! Do you think, you
negro wench, I wouldn't give <i>my</i> poor, miserable, black soul
to eternal torments a thousand times over, if only I could give her
little white heart one moment's forgetfulness before she dies?'</p>
<p>For five days longer Ethel lingered in the burning fever,
sometimes conscious for a minute or two, but for the most part
delirious or drowsy all the time. She never said another word to
John about her terrible dream, and John never said another word to
her. But he sat by her side and tended her like a woman, doing
everything that was possible for her in the bare little hut, and
devouring his full heart with a horrible gnawing remorse too deep
for pen or tongue to probe and fathom. For civilisation with John
Creedy was really at bottom far more than a mere veneer; though the
savage instincts might break out with him now and again, such
outbursts no more affected his adult and acquired nature than a
single bump-supper or wine-party at college affects the nature of
many a gentle-minded English lad. The truest John Creedy of all was
the gentle, tender, English clergyman.</p>
<p>As he sat by her bedside sleepless and agonised, night and day,
for five days together, one prayer only rose to his lips time after
time, 'Heaven grant she may die!' He had depth enough in the
civilised side of his soul to feel that that was the only way to
save her from a lifelong shame. 'If she gets well,' he said to
himself, trembling, 'I will leave this accursed Africa at once. I
will work my way back to England as a common sailor, and send her
home by the mail with my remaining money. I will never inflict my
presence upon her again, for she cannot be persuaded, if once she
recovers, that she did not see me, as she did see me, a bare-limbed
heathen Fantee brandishing a devilish tom-tom. But I shall get work
in England&mdash;not a parson's; that I can never be
again&mdash;but clerk's work, labourer's work, navvy's work,
anything! Look at my arms: I rowed five in the Magdalen eight: I
could hold a spade as well as any man. I will toil, and slave, and
save, and keep her still like a lady, if I starve for it myself:
but she shall never see my face again if once she recovers. Even
then it will be a living death for her, poor angel! There is only
one hope&mdash;Heaven grant she may die!'</p>
<p>On the fifth day she opened her eyes once. John saw that his
prayer was about to be fulfilled. 'John,' she said
feebly&mdash;'John, tell me, on your honour, it was only my
delirium.'</p>
<p>And John, raising his hand to heaven, <i>splendide mendax</i>,
answered in a firm voice, 'I swear it.'</p>
<p>Ethel smiled and shut her eyes. It was for the last time.</p>
<p>Next morning, John Creedy&mdash;tearless, but parched and dry in
the mouth, like one stunned and unmanned&mdash;took a pick-axe and
hewed out a rude grave in the loose soil near the river. Then he
fashioned a rough coffin from twisted canes with his own hands, and
in it he reverently placed the sacred body. He allowed no one to
help him or come near him&mdash;not even his fellow-Christians, the
catechist and his wife: Ethel was too holy a thing for their
African hands to touch. Next he put on his white surplice, and for
the first and only time in his life he read, without a quaver in
his voice, the Church of England Burial Service over the open
grave. And when he had finished he went back to his desolate hut,
and cried with a loud voice of utter despair, 'The one thing that
bound me to civilisation is gone. Henceforth I shall never speak
another word of English. I go to my own people.' So saying, he
solemnly tore up his European clothes once more, bound a cotton
loin-cloth round his waist, covered his head with dirt, and sat
fasting and wailing piteously, like a broken-hearted child, in his
cabin.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>Nowadays, the old half-caste Portuguese rum-dealer at Butabué
can point out to any English pioneer who comes up the river which
one, among a crowd of dilapidated negroes who lie basking in the
soft dust outside his hut was once the Reverend John Creedy, B.A.,
of Magdalen College, Oxford.</p>

<h3>FRASINE'S FIRST COMMUNION</h3>
<p>Zélie was our cook. She came back to us each winter when we
returned to the Riviera, and went away again in spring to
Aix-les-Bains, where she always made her summer season with a
German family. A thorough-going Provençale was Zélie,
olive-skinned, black-haired, thick-lipped, pleasant-featured, with
flashing dark eyes and a merry mouth, well shaped to make a mock at
you. Nobody would have called Zélie exactly pretty: but she was
comely and buxom, and good-humoured withal; while, as for
<i>pot-au-feu</i>, she had not her equal in the whole Department.
She said <i>çoux</i> for <i>choux</i>, and <i>çapeau</i> for
<i>chapeau</i>; but her smile was infectious, and her kindness of
heart was as undoubted as her omelettes.</p>
<p>One April afternoon, Ruth went out into the kitchen. She didn't
often penetrate into such regions at the villa; for Zélie, on that
point, was strictly conservative. 'If Madame desires to see me,'
she used to say, 'I receive at half-past nine in the morning, when
I come home from marketing. At all other hours, I am happy to
return Madame's call in the <i>salon</i>.' Zélie was too good a
servant to make it worth while for us to risk her displeasure; and
the consequence was that Ruth seldom ventured into Zélie's keep
except at the hour of her cook's reception.</p>
<p>On this particular day, however, Ruth was surprised to see Zélie
seated at the table, stitching away at what appeared to be a bridal
garment. Such white muslin and white tulle gave her a turn for a
moment. 'Why, Zélie!' she cried, putting one hand to her heart,
'you're not going to be married?' For cooks like Zélie are rare on
the Littoral.</p>
<p>'<i>Ma foi!</i> no, Madame,' Zélie answered, laughing. 'I
confection a robe for Frasine, who makes her first Communion.'</p>
<p>'Frasine!' Ruth exclaimed. 'And who may Frasine be? Your sister,
I suppose, Zélie?'</p>
<p>Zélie smoothed out a flounce with one capable brown hand. 'No,
Madame,' she said demurely; 'Frasine is my daughter.'</p>
<p>'Your daughter!' Ruth cried, staring at her. 'But, Zélie, I
never even knew you were married!'</p>
<p>Zélie smoothed still more vigorously at the edge of the flounce.
'<i>Mais non</i>, Madame,' she continued, in her most
matter-of-fact voice. 'It arrived so, you see. Hector's family were
against it, and thus it never happened.'</p>
<p>Ruth gazed at her, much shaken. 'But, Zélie,' she murmured,
seizing her hand in dismay, 'do you mean to tell
me&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>
<p>Zélie nodded her head sagely. 'Yes, yes, Madame,' she answered.
'These things come so to us other poor people. It is not like that,
I know, <i>chez vous</i>. But here in France, let us allow, the law
is so difficult.'</p>
<p>'Tell me all about it,' Ruth cried, sinking down on to one of
the kitchen chairs, and looking up at her appealingly. 'What age
has your daughter?'</p>
<p>'Frasine is twelve years old,' Zélie answered, still going on
with her work, 'and a pretty girl, too, though 'tis the word of a
mother. You see, Madame, it came about like this. The good Hector
was in love with me; but he was in a better position than my
parents for his part, for his father was proprietor, while mine was
workman. They owned a beautiful property up in our hills near
Vence&mdash;oh, a beautiful property! They harvested I could not
tell you how many hectolitres of olives. Their little blue wine was
renowned in the country. Well, Hector loved me, and I loved Hector.
<i>Que voulez-vous?</i> We were thrown, in our work, very much
together.' She paused, and glanced shyly askance at Ruth with those
expressive eyes of hers.</p>
<p>'And he didn't marry you?' Ruth asked, faltering.</p>
<p>'He meant to, Madame: I assure you, he meant to,' Zélie answered
hastily. 'He was a kind soul, Hector; he began it all at first for
the good motive. But, meanwhile, you understand, in waiting for the
priest&mdash;&mdash;' Zélie lifted her flounce close up to her face
and stitched away at it nervously.</p>
<p>'And that was all?' Ruth put in, with her scared white
face&mdash;I could hear and see it all through the door from my
study.</p>
<p>'That was all, Madame,' Zélie answered, very low. 'I m'a dit,
"Veux-tu?" Je lui ai dit, "Je veux bien." Et tout d'un coup, nous
voilà père et mère presque sans le savoir.'</p>
<p>There was a pause for a moment, during which you could hear
Zélie's needle go stitch, stitch, stitch, through the stiff
starched muslin. Then Ruth spoke again: 'And, after that, he left
you?'</p>
<p>Zélie's stoicism began to give way a little. There were tears in
her eyes, but still she stitched on, to hide her confusion. 'He
never meant any harm, my poor boy!' she answered, bending over. 'He
really loved me, and he always hoped, in the end, to marry me. So,
when he knew Frasine was beginning to be, he said to me, one fine
day, "Zélie, I will go up to Vence, and arrange your affair with my
father and the curé." And he went up to Vence, and asked his
father's consent to our marriage; for, <i>chez nous</i>, you know,
one is not permitted to marry without the consent of one's family.
But Hector's father was very angry at the news, and refused his
consent, because he was proprietor, and I was but a servant. And
about that time it was Hector's year to serve, and they put him
into a regiment that was stationed a long way off&mdash;oh! a very
long way off&mdash;quite far from my country, in the direction of
Orleans. And without his father's consent, of course, he could
never marry me, for that's our law here in France, to us others. So
he served his time, and at the end of it all&mdash;well, he married
another woman, and settled in Paris.'</p>
<p>'He married another woman,' Ruth repeated slowly, 'and left you
with Frasine.'</p>
<p>'<i>Parfaitement</i>, Madame,' Zélie answered with a gulp. Then,
all at once, her stoicism broke down completely; she laid aside her
sewing, and burst into tears with perfect frankness.</p>
<p>Ruth bent over her tenderly and stroked her brown hand. 'Dear
Zélie!' she said; 'he treated you cruelly.'</p>
<p>'No, no, Madame!' Zélie answered through her tears, still loyal
to her lover. 'You do not understand. He could not help it. He was
a brave boy, Hector. He meant to do well, it was all for the good
motive; but his family opposed; and with us, when your family
oppose, <i>mon Dieu!</i> it is finished. But still, he was good; he
did what he could for me. He acknowledged his child, and entered it
at the Mairie as his own and mine, which alters, of course, its
<i>état civil</i>&mdash;Frasine has right, at his death, to a share
of his property. My poor, good Hector! it was all he could do for
me.'</p>
<p>Ruth burst away at once, and came in to me, crying. This was all
so new to her, and we were both of us so genuinely attached to
Zélie. 'Oh, Hugh!' she began, 'Zélie's been telling me such a
dreadful, dreadful story. Do you know she has&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'My child,' I said, 'you may save yourself the trouble of
repeating it all to me; I've heard through the door every blessed
word you two have been saying.'</p>
<p>Ruth stood by my side, all tearful. 'But isn't it sad, Hugh?'
she said; 'and she seemed so resigned to it.'</p>
<p>'Very sad, dear,' I answered. 'But, do you know, little Ruthie,
I'm afraid such stories are by no means uncommon&mdash;abroad, I
mean, dear.'</p>
<p>'Hugh,' Ruth cried, seizing my arm, 'we must see this little
girl of hers.' She rushed out into the kitchen again. 'Zélie,' she
said, 'where is Frasine?'</p>
<p>Zélie had taken up her sewing once more by this time, and
answered with a little sob, 'In our mountains, Madame, near Vence;
in effect, she lives with my parents.'</p>
<p>'And do you see her often? Ruth asked.</p>
<p>'Once in fifteen days she comes to Mass in the town,' Zélie
answered with a sigh; 'and then, when Madame's convenience permits,
I usually see her. And when I have made my winter season, I go up
for eight days with her, to stop with my people, before I leave for
Aix-les-Bains; and when I return again in autumn, before Madame
arrives, I have eight days more. <i>Ce sont là mes
vacances.</i>'</p>
<p>'And where will she make her first Communion?' Ruth asked.</p>
<p>'Why, naturally, in the town,' Zélie answered, 'with the other
young people. The Bishop of Fréjus comes over, from here a
fortnight.'</p>
<p>'Bring her down here,' Ruth said in her imperious little way.
'Let her stop with us till the time. Monsieur and I desire to see
her.'</p>
<p>So Frasine came down, and very proud indeed Zélie was of her
daughter. Barring the irregularity of her first appearance in this
wicked world, Zélie had cause to be proud of her. She was tall and
well grown and as modest as a <i>rosière</i>. She had dove-like
eyes and peach bloom on her cheeks; and when Ruth and Zélie had
arranged her, all blushing, in her pretty white dress and her long
tulle veil, she looked a perfect model for Jules Breton's young
Christians. Zélie kissed her as she stood there with a mother's
fervour; and Ruth kissed her, I declare, just as fervently as
Zélie. They couldn't have made more fuss about that slip of a girl
if Frasine's father had kept his promise and the child had been
born in lawful wedlock.</p>
<p>After a day or two Ruth began to talk about something that was
troubling her. It was a very serious thing, she said, this first
Communion. It was an epoch in a girl's life, a family occasion.
Every member of the family ought to be apprised of it beforehand.
Hector might be married to another horrid woman in Paris, but,
after all, Frasine was his daughter, acknowledged as such in due
form at the Mairie. I'm bound to say that, though Ruth is a
stickler for the strictest morality on <i>our</i> side of the
Channel, she didn't take much account of that woman in Paris. I
ventured to suggest that to invite the good Hector to the first
Communion might be to endanger the peace of a deserving family.
Madame Hector <i>de jure</i> might be unaware of the existence of
her predecessor <i>de facto</i>, and might regard little Frasine,
as an unauthorised interloper, with no friendly feeling. But Ruth
was inexorable. You know her imperious, delicious little way when
she once gets a fixed idea into that dear glossy head of hers. She
insisted on maintaining the untenable position that a man is
somehow really and truly related to his own children, no matter who
may be their mother. As an English barrister, I humbly endeavoured
to point out to her the fact that recognition of this pernicious
principle would involve the downfall of law and order. Still, Ruth
was impervious to my sound argument on the subject, and refused to
listen to the voice of Blackstone. So the end of it all was that
she persuaded Zélie to write to Hector, informing him of this
important forthcoming epoch in their daughter's history.</p>
<p>Of course, I had a week of it. To search for Hector in Paris,
after nine years' silence, would be to search for a needle in a
bottle of hay, as I pointed out at once to those two fatuous women.
My own opinion was that Hector was to be found (as we say
facetiously) in the twenty-first <i>arrondissement</i>&mdash;the
point of which is that there are but twenty. But I rushed up to
Vence all the same, to prosecute inquiries as to what had become of
the former owner of that <i>belle propriété</i> which loomed so
large in Zélie's imagination. With infinite difficulty, and after
many trials, I had reason to believe, at last, that the
<i>nommé</i> Hector Canivet, ancient proprietor, was to be found at
a certain number in a certain street in the Montmartre Quartier.
Hither, therefore, we despatched our letter of invitation,
dexterously concocted in our very best French by Ruth, Zélie, and
myself in council assembled. It informed Monsieur Hector Canivet,
without note or comment, that Mdlle. Euphrasyne Canivet, now aged
twelve years, would make her first Communion in our parish church
on Wednesday the 22nd, and that Mdlle. Zélie Duhamel invited his
presence on this auspicious occasion. As an English barrister, I
insisted upon the point that consideration for the feelings of
Madame Canivet in Paris should make us leave it open for M. Hector
Canivet to treat Mdlle. Euphrasyne, if he were so minded, as a
distant cousin. So much of masculine guile have I still left in me.
Ruth was disposed to protest; but Zélie, more French, acquiesced in
my view of the case, and over-persuaded her.</p>
<p>Three days later I was sitting in my study, intent on the
twenty-fourth chapter of my 'History of the Rise of the Republic of
San Marino,' when suddenly the door opened, and Ruth burst in upon
me with the most radiant expression of perfect happiness I ever saw
even on that dimpled face of hers. She held a letter in her hand,
which she thrust forward to me eagerly.</p>
<p>'What's up?' I asked. 'Has that brute of a husband of Amelia's
been kind enough to drink himself to death at last?'</p>
<p>'No; read it, read it!' Ruth exclaimed, brimming over. 'Zélie
and Frasine are dissolved in tears in the kitchen over the news. I
knew I was doing right! I was sure we ought to tell him!'</p>
<p>I took the letter up in a maze. It was involved and long-winded,
full of the usual inflated rhetoric of the Provençal peasant. But
there was no doubt at all about the human feeling of it. Monsieur
Hector Canivet wrote with the profoundest emotion. He had always
loved and remembered his dear Zélie. She was still his dream to
him. He had married and settled because his parents wished it; but
now, his parents were dead, and he had sold his property, and was
doing very well at his <i>métier</i> in Paris. The late Madame
Canivet&mdash;on whose soul might the blessed saints have
mercy!&mdash;had died two years ago. Ever since that event he had
had it in his mind to return to his country, and look up Zélie and
his dear daughter; but pride, and uncertainty as to her feelings,
had prevented him. It was so long ago, and he knew not her
feelings. He took this intimation, however, as a proof that Zélie
had not yet entirely forgotten him; and if the devotion of a
lifetime, and a comfortable fortune (for a <i>bourgeois</i>) in
Paris, would atone to Zélie for his neglect in the past, he
proposed not only to be present at Frasine's first Communion, but
also to superadd to it another Sacrament of the Church which he was
only too conscious should have preceded her baptism. In short, if
Zélie was still of the same mind as of old, he desired to return,
in order to marry her.</p>
<p>'That's well,' I said. 'He will legitimatise his daughter.'</p>
<p>'You don't mean to say,' Ruth cried, 'he can make it just the
same as if he'd married Zélie all right to begin with?'</p>
<p>'Why, certainly!' I answered; 'in France, the law is sometimes
quite human.'</p>
<p>Ruth rushed into my arms. And the brave Hector was as good as
his word.</p>
<p>But we shall never get another cook like Zélie!</p>

<h3>THE CHILD OF THE PHALANSTERY</h3>
<blockquote><i>'Poor little thing,' said my strong-minded friend
compassionately. 'Just look at her! Clubfooted. What a misery to
herself and others! In a well-organised state of society, you know,
such poor wee cripples as that would be quietly put out of their
misery while they were still babies.'</i><br>
<br>
<i>'Let me think,' said I, 'how that would work out in actual
practice. I'm not so sure, after all, that we should be altogether
the better or the happier for it.'</i></blockquote>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>They sat together in a corner of the beautiful phalanstery
garden, Olive and Clarence, on the marble seat that overhung the
mossy dell where the streamlet danced and bickered among its pebbly
stickles; they sat there, hand in hand, in lovers' guise, and felt
their two bosoms beating and thrilling in some strange, sweet
fashion, just like two foolish unregenerate young people of the old
antisocial prephalansteric days. Perhaps it was the leaven of their
unenlightened ancestors still leavening by heredity the whole lump;
perhaps it was the inspiration of the calm soft August evening and
the delicate afterglow of the setting sun; perhaps it was the deep
heart of man and woman vibrating still as of yore in human
sympathy, and stirred to its innermost recesses by the unutterable
breath of human emotion. But at any rate there they sat, the
beautiful strong man in his shapely chiton, and the dainty fair
girl in her long white robe with the dark green embroidered border,
looking far into the fathomless depths of one another's eyes, in
silence sweeter and more eloquent than many words. It was Olive's
tenth day holiday from her share in the maidens' household duty of
the community; and Clarence, by arrangement with his friend
Germain, had made exchange from his own decade (which fell on
Plato) to this quiet Milton evening, that he might wander through
the park and gardens with his chosen love, and speak his full mind
to her now without reserve.</p>
<p>'If only the phalanstery will give its consent, Clarence,' Olive
said at last with a little sigh, releasing her hand from his, and
gathering up the folds of her stole from the marble flooring of the
seat;&mdash;'if only the phalanstery will give its consent! but I
have my doubts about it. Is it quite right? Have we chosen quite
wisely? Will the hierarch and the elder brothers think I am strong
enough and fit enough for the duties of the task? It is no light
matter, we know, to enter into bonds with one another for the
responsibilities of fatherhood and motherhood. I sometimes
feel&mdash;forgive me, Clarence&mdash;but I sometimes feel as if I
were allowing my own heart and my own wishes to guide me too
exclusively in this solemn question: thinking too much about you
and me, about ourselves (which is only an enlarged form of
selfishness, after all), and too little about the future good of
the community and&mdash;and&mdash;' blushing a little, for women
will be women even in a phalanstery&mdash;'and of the precious
lives we may be the means of adding to it. You remember, Clarence,
what the hierarch said, that we ought to think least and last of
our own feelings, first and foremost of the progressive evolution
of universal humanity.'</p>
<p>'I remember, darling,' Clarence answered, leaning over towards
her tenderly; 'I remember well, and in my own way, so far as a man
can (for we men haven't the moral earnestness of you women, I'm
afraid, Olive), I try to act up to it. But, dearest, I think your
fears are greater than they need be: you must recollect that
humanity requires for its higher development tenderness, and truth,
and love, and all the softer qualities, as well as strength and
manliness; and if you are a trifle less strong than most of our
sisters here, you seem to me at least (and I really believe to the
hierarch and to the elder brothers too) to make up for it, and more
than make up for it, in your sweet and lovable inner nature. The
men of the future mustn't all be cast in one unvarying stereotyped
mould; we must have a little of all good types combined, in order
to make a perfect phalanstery.'</p>
<p>Olive sighed again. 'I don't know,' she said pensively. 'I don't
feel sure. I hope I am doing right. In my aspirations every evening
I have desired light on this matter, and have earnestly hoped that
I was not being misled by my own feelings; for, oh, Clarence, I do
love you so dearly, so truly, so absorbingly, that I half fear my
love may be taking me unwittingly astray. I try to curb it; I try
to think of it all as the hierarch tells us we ought to; but in my
own heart I sometimes almost fear that I may be lapsing into the
idolatrous love of the old days, when people married and were given
in marriage, and thought only of the gratification of their own
personal emotions and affections, and nothing of the ultimate good
of humanity. Oh, Clarence, don't hate me and despise me for it;
don't turn upon me and scold me; but I love you, I love you, I love
you; oh, I'm afraid I love you almost idolatrously!'</p>
<p>Clarence lifted her small white hand slowly to his lips, with
that natural air of chivalrous respect which came so easily to the
young men of the phalanstery, and kissed it twice over fervidly
with quiet reverence. 'Let us go into the music-room, Olive
dearest,' he said as he rose; 'you are too sad to-night. You shall
play me that sweet piece of Marian's that you love so much; and
that will quiet you, darling, from thinking too earnestly about
this serious matter.'</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Next day, when Clarence had finished his daily spell of work in
the fruit-garden (he was third under-gardener to the community), he
went up to his own study, and wrote out a little notice in due form
to be posted at dinner-time on the refectory door: 'Clarence and
Olive ask leave of the phalanstery to enter with one another into
free contract of holy matrimony.' His pen trembled a little in his
hand as he framed that familiar set form of words (strange that he
had read it so often with so little emotion, and wrote it now with
so much: we men are so selfish!); but he fixed it boldly with four
small brass nails on the regulation notice-board, and waited, not
without a certain quiet confidence, for the final result of the
communal council.</p>
<p>'Aha!' said the hierarch to himself with a kindly smile, as he
passed into the refectory at dinner-time that day, 'has it come to
that, then? Well, well, I thought as much; I felt sure it would. A
good girl, Olive: a true, earnest, lovable girl: and she has chosen
wisely, too; for Clarence is the very man to balance her own
character as man's and wife's should do. Whether Clarence has done
well in selecting her is another matter. For my own part, I had
rather hoped she would have joined the celibate sisters, and have
taken nurse-duty for the sick and the children. It's her natural
function in life, the work she's best fitted for; and I should have
liked to see her take to it. But, after all, the business of the
phalanstery is not to decide vicariously for its individual
members&mdash;not to thwart their natural harmless inclinations and
wishes; on the contrary, we ought to allow every man and girl the
fullest liberty to follow their own personal taste and judgment in
every possible matter. Our power of interference as a community,
I've always felt and said, should only extend to the prevention of
obviously wrong and immoral acts, such as marriage with a person in
ill-health, or of inferior mental power, or with a distinctly bad
or insubordinate temper. Things of that sort, of course, are as
clearly wicked as idling in work-hours, or marriage with a first
cousin. Olive's health, however, isn't really bad, nothing more
than a very slight feebleness of constitution, as constitutions go
with us; and Eustace, who has attended her medically from her
babyhood (what a dear crowing little thing she used to be in the
nursery, to be sure!), tells me she's perfectly fitted for the
duties of her proposed situation. Ah well, ah well; I've no doubt
they'll be perfectly happy; and the wishes of the whole phalanstery
will go with them in any case, that's certain.'</p>
<p>Everybody knew that whatever the hierarch said or thought was
pretty sure to be approved by the unanimous voice of the entire
community. Not that he was at all a dictatorial or dogmatic old
man; quite the contrary; but his gentle kindly way had its full
weight with the brothers; and his intimate acquaintance, through
the exercise of his spiritual functions, with the inmost thoughts
and ideas of every individual member, man or woman, made him a safe
guide in all difficult or delicate questions, as to what the
decision of the council ought to be. So when, on the first Cosmos,
the elder brothers assembled to transact phalansteric business, and
the hierarch put in Clarence's request with the simple phrase, 'In
my opinion, there is no reasonable objection,' the community at
once gave in its adhesion, and formal notice was posted an hour
later on the refectory door, 'The phalanstery approves the
proposition of Clarence and Olive, and wishes all happiness to them
and to humanity from the sacred union they now contemplate.' 'You
see, dearest,' Clarence said, kissing her lips for the first time
(as unwritten law demanded), now that the seal of the community had
been placed upon their choice, 'you see, there can't be any harm in
our contract, for the elder brothers all approve it.'</p>
<p>Olive smiled and sighed from the very bottom of her full heart,
and clung to her lover as the ivy clings to a strong supporting
oak-tree. 'Darling,' she murmured in his ear, 'if I have you to
comfort me, I shall not be afraid, and we will try our best to work
together for the advancement and the good of divine humanity.'</p>
<p>Four decades later, on a bright Cosmos morning in September,
those two stood up beside one another before the altar of humanity,
and heard with a thrill the voice of the hierarch uttering that
solemn declaration, 'In the name of the Past, and of the Present,
and of the Future, I hereby admit you, Clarence and Olive, into the
holy society of Fathers and Mothers, of the United Avondale
Phalanstery, in trust for humanity, whose stewards you are. May you
so use and enhance the good gifts you have received from your
ancestors that you may hand them on, untarnished and increased, to
the bodies and minds of your furthest descendants.' And Clarence
and Olive answered humbly and reverently, 'If grace be given us, we
will.'</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Brother Eustace, physiologist to the phalanstery, looked very
grave and sad indeed as he passed from the Mothers' Room into the
Conversazione in search of the hierarch. 'A child is born into the
phalanstery,' he said gloomily; but his face conveyed at once a far
deeper and more pregnant meaning than his mere words could carry to
the ear.</p>
<p>The hierarch rose hastily and glanced into his dark keen eyes
with an inquiring look. 'Not something amiss?' he said eagerly,
with an infinite tenderness in his fatherly voice. 'Don't tell me
that, Eustace. Not ... oh, not a child that the phalanstery must
not for its own sake permit to live! Oh, Eustace, not, I hope,
idiotic! And I gave my consent too; I gave my consent for pretty
gentle little Olive's sake! Heaven grant I was not too much moved
by her prettiness and her delicacy; for I love her, Eustace, I love
her like a daughter.'</p>
<p>'So we all love the children of the phalanstery, Cyriac, we who
are elder brothers,' said the physiologist gravely, half smiling to
himself nevertheless at this quaint expression of old-world feeling
on the part even of the very hierarch, whose bounden duty it was to
advise and persuade a higher rule of conduct and thought than such
antique phraseology implied. 'No, not idiotic; not quite so bad as
that, Cyriac; not absolutely a hopeless case, but still, very
serious and distressing for all that. The dear little baby has its
feet turned inward. She'll be a cripple for life, I fear, and no
help for it.'</p>
<p>Tears rose unchecked into the hierarch's soft grey eyes. 'Its
feet turned inward,' he muttered sadly, half to himself. 'Feet
turned inward! Oh, how terrible! This will be a frightful blow to
Clarence and to Olive. Poor young things! their first-born, too.
Oh, Eustace, what an awful thought that, with all the care and
precaution we take to keep all causes of misery away from the
precincts of the phalanstery, such trials as this must needs come
upon us by the blind workings of the unconscious Cosmos! It is
terrible, too terrible!'</p>
<p>'And yet it isn't all loss,' the physiologist answered
earnestly. 'It isn't all loss, Cyriac, heart-rending as the
necessity seems to us. I sometimes think that if we hadn't these
occasional distressful objects on which to expend our sympathy and
our sorrow, we in our happy little communities might grow too smug,
and comfortable, and material, and earthly. But things like this
bring tears into our eyes, and we are the better for them in the
end, depend upon it, we are the better for them. They try our
fortitude, our devotion to principle, our obedience to the highest
and the hardest law. Every time some poor little waif like this is
born into our midst, we feel the strain of old prephalansteric
emotions and fallacies of feeling dragging us steadily and cruelly
down. Our first impulse is to pity the poor mother, to pity the
poor child, and in our mistaken kindness to let an unhappy life go
on indefinitely to its own misery and the preventible distress of
all around it. We have to make an effort, a struggle, before the
higher and more abstract pity conquers the lower and more concrete
one. But in the end we are all the better for it: and each such
struggle and each such victory, Cyriac, paves the way for that
final and truest morality when we shall do right instinctively and
naturally, without any impulse on any side to do wrong in any way
at all.'</p>
<p>'You speak wisely, Eustace,' the hierarch answered with a sad
shake of his head, 'and I wish I could feel like you. I ought to,
but I can't. Your functions make you able to look more
dispassionately upon these things than I can. I'm afraid there's a
great deal of the old Adam lingering wrongfully in me yet. And I'm
still more afraid there's a great deal of the old Eve lingering
even more strongly in all our mothers. It'll be a long time, I
doubt me, before they'll ever consent without a struggle to the
painless extinction of necessarily unhappy and imperfect lives. A
long time: a very long time. Does Clarence know of this yet?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I have told him. His grief is terrible. You had better go
and console him as best you can.'</p>
<p>'I will, I will. And poor Olive! Poor Olive! It wrings my heart
to think of her. Of course she won't be told of it, if you can
help, for the probationary four decades?'</p>
<p>'No, not if we can help it: but I don't know how it can ever be
kept from her. She <i>will</i> see Clarence, and Clarence will
certainly tell her.'</p>
<p>The hierarch whistled gently to himself. 'It's a sad case,' he
said ruefully, 'a very sad case; and yet I don't see how we can
possibly prevent it.'</p>
<p>He walked slowly and deliberately into the anteroom where
Clarence was seated on a sofa, his head between his hands, rocking
himself to and fro in his mute misery, or stopping to groan now and
then in a faint feeble inarticulate fashion. Rhoda, one of the
elder sisters, held the unconscious baby sleeping in her arms, and
the hierarch took it from her like a man accustomed to infants, and
looked ruefully at the poor distorted little feet. Yes, Eustace was
evidently quite right. There could be no hope of ever putting those
wee twisted ankles back straight and firm into their proper place
again like other people's.</p>
<p>He sat down beside Clarence on the sofa, and with a
commiserating gesture removed the young man's hands from his pale
white face. 'My dear, dear friend,' he said softly, 'what comfort
or consolation can we try to give you that is not a cruel mockery?
None, none, none. We can only sympathise with you and Olive: and
perhaps, after all, the truest sympathy is silence.'</p>
<p>Clarence answered nothing for a moment, but buried his face once
more in his hands and burst into tears. The men of the phalanstery
were less careful to conceal their emotions than we old-time folks
in these early centuries. 'Oh, dear hierarch,' he said, after a
long sob, 'it is too hard a sacrifice, too hard, too terrible! I
don't feel it for the baby's sake: for her 'tis better so: she will
be freed from a life of misery and dependence; but for my own sake,
and oh, above all, for dear Olive's! It will kill her, hierarch; I
feel sure it will kill her!'</p>
<p>The elder brother passed his hand with a troubled gesture across
his forehead. 'But what else can we do, dear Clarence?' he asked
pathetically. 'What else can we do? Would you have us bring up the
dear child to lead a lingering life of misfortune, to distress the
eyes of all around her, to feel herself a useless incumbrance in
the midst of so many mutually helpful and serviceable and happy
people? How keenly she would realise her own isolation in the
joyous, busy, labouring community of our phalansteries! How
terribly she would brood over her own misfortune when surrounded by
such a world of hearty, healthy, sound-limbed, useful persons!
Would it not be a wicked and a cruel act to bring her up to an old
age of unhappiness and imperfection? You have been in Australia, my
boy, when we sent you on that plant-hunting expedition, and you
have seen cripples with your own eyes, no doubt, which I have never
done&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;I who have never gone beyond the
limits of the most highly civilised Euramerican countries. You have
seen cripples, in those semi-civilised old colonial societies,
which have lagged after us so slowly in the path of progress; and
would you like your own daughter to grow up to such a life as that,
Clarence? would you like her, I ask you, to grow up to such a life
as that?'</p>
<p>Clarence clenched his right hand tightly over his left arm, and
answered with a groan, 'No, hierarch; not even for Olive's sake
could I wish for such an act of irrational injustice. You have
trained us up to know the good from the evil, and for no personal
gratification of our deepest emotions, I hope and trust, shall we
ever betray your teaching or depart from your principles. I know
what it is: I saw just such a cripple once, at a great town in the
heart of Central Australia&mdash;a child of eight years old,
limping along lamely on her heels by her mothers side; a sickening
sight: to think of it even now turns the blood in one's arteries;
and I could never wish Olive's baby to live and grow up to be a
thing like that. But, oh, I wish to heaven it might have been
otherwise: I wish to heaven this trial might have been spared us
both. Oh, hierarch, dear hierarch, the sacrifice is one that no
good man or woman would wish selfishly to forgo; yet for all that,
our hearts, our hearts are human still; and though we may reason
and may act up to our reasoning, the human feeling in
us&mdash;relic of the idolatrous days, or whatever you like to call
it&mdash;it will not choose to be so put down and stifled: it will
out, hierarch, it will out for all that, in real hot, human tears.
Oh, dear, dear kind father and brother, it will kill Olive: I know
it will kill her!'</p>
<p>'Olive is a good girl,' the hierarch answered slowly. 'A good
girl, well brought up, and with sound principles. She will not
flinch from doing her duty, I know, Clarence; but her emotional
nature is a very delicate one, and we have reason indeed to fear
the shock to her nervous system. That she will do right bravely, I
don't doubt: the only danger is lest the effort to do right should
cost her too dear. Whatever can be done to spare her shall be done,
Clarence. It is a sad misfortune for the whole phalanstery, such a
child being born to us as this: and we all sympathise with you: we
sympathise with you more deeply than words can say.'</p>
<p>The young man only rocked up and down drearily as before, and
murmured to himself, 'It will kill her, it will kill her! My Olive,
my Olive, I know it will kill her.'</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>They didn't keep the secret of the baby's crippled condition
from Olive till the four decades were over, nor anything like it.
The moment she saw Clarence, she guessed at once with a woman's
instinct that something serious had happened; and she didn't rest
till she had found out from him all about it. Rhoda brought her the
poor wee mite, carefully wrapped, after the phalansteric fashion,
in a long strip of fine flannel, and Olive unrolled the piece until
she came at last upon the small crippled feet, that looked so soft
and tender and dainty and waxen in their very deformity. The young
mother leant over the child a moment in speechless misery. 'Spirit
of Humanity,' she whispered at length feebly, 'oh, give me strength
to bear this terrible, unutterable trial! It will break my heart.
But I will try to bear it.'</p>
<p>There was something so touching in her attempted resignation
that Rhoda, for the first time in her life, felt almost tempted to
wish she had been born in the old wicked prephalansteric days, when
they would have let the poor baby grow up to womanhood as a matter
of course, and bear its own burden through life as best it might.
Presently, Olive raised her head again from the crimson silken
pillow. 'Clarence,' she said, in a trembling voice, pressing the
sleeping baby hard against her breast, 'when will it be? How long?
Is there no hope, no chance of respite?'</p>
<p>'Not for a long time yet, dearest Olive,' Clarence answered
through his tears. 'The phalanstery will be very gentle and patient
with us, we know; and brother Eustace will do everything that lies
in his power, though he's afraid he can give us very little hope
indeed. In any case, Olive darling, the community waits for four
decades before deciding anything: it waits to see whether there is
any chance for physiological or surgical relief: it decides nothing
hastily or thoughtlessly: it waits for every possible improvement,
hoping against hope till hope itself is hopeless. And then, if at
the end of the quartet, as I fear will be the case&mdash;for we
must face the worst, darling, we must face the worst&mdash;if at
the end of the quartet it seems clear to brother Eustace, and the
three assessor physiologists from the neighbouring phalansteries,
that the dear child would be a cripple for life, we're still
allowed four decades more to prepare ourselves in: four whole
decades more, Olive, to take our leave of the darling baby. You'll
have your baby with you for eighty days. And we must wean ourselves
from her in that time, darling. We must try to wean ourselves. But
oh Olive, oh Rhoda, it's very hard: very, very, very hard.'</p>
<p>Olive answered not a word, but lay silently weeping and pressing
the baby against her breast, with her large brown eyes fixed
vacantly upon the fretted woodwork of the panelled ceiling.</p>
<p>'You mustn't do like that, Olive dear,' sister Rhoda said in a
half-frightened voice. 'You must cry right out, and sob, and not
restrain yourself, darling, or else you'll break your heart with
silence and repression. Do cry aloud, there's a dear girl: do cry
aloud and relieve yourself. A good cry would be the best thing on
earth for you. And think, dear, how much happier it will really be
for the sweet baby to sink asleep so peacefully than to live a long
life of conscious inferiority and felt imperfection! What a
blessing it is to think you were born in a phalansteric land, where
the dear child will be happily and painlessly rid of its poor
little unconscious existence, before it has reached the age when it
might begin to know its own incurable and inevitable misfortune!
Oh, Olive, what a blessing that is, and how thankful we ought all
to be that we live in a world where the sweet pet will be saved so
much humiliation, and mortification, and misery!'</p>
<p>At that moment, Olive, looking within into her own wicked,
rebellious heart, was conscious, with a mingled glow, half shame,
half indignation, that so far from appreciating the priceless
blessings of her own situation, she would gladly have changed
places then and there with any barbaric woman of the old
semi-civilised prephalansteric days. We can so little appreciate
our own mercies. It was very wrong and anti-cosmic, she knew; very
wrong indeed, and the hierarch would have told her so at once; but
in her own woman's soul she felt she would rather be a miserable
naked savage in a wattled hut, like those one saw in old books
about Africa before the illumination, if only she could keep that
one little angel of a crippled baby, than dwell among all the
enlightenment, and knowledge, and art, and perfected social
arrangements of phalansteric England without her child&mdash;her
dear, helpless, beautiful baby. How truly the Founder himself had
said, 'Think you there will be no more tragedies and dramas in the
world when we have reformed it, nothing but one dreary dead level
of monotonous content? Ay, indeed, there will; for that, fear not;
while the heart of man remains, there will be tragedy enough on
earth and to spare for a hundred poets to take for their saddest
epics.'</p>
<p>Olive looked up at Rhoda wistfully. 'Sister Rhoda,' she said in
a timid tone, 'it may be very wicked&mdash;I feel sure it
is&mdash;but do you know, I've read somewhere in old stories of the
unenlightened days that a mother always loved the most afflicted of
her children the best. And I can understand it now, sister Rhoda; I
can feel it here,' and she put her hand upon her poor still heart.
'If only I could keep this one dear crippled baby, I could give up
all the world beside&mdash;except you, Clarence.'</p>
<p>'Oh, hush, darling!' Rhoda cried in an awed voice, stooping down
half alarmed to kiss her pale forehead. 'You mustn't talk like
that, Olive dearest. It's wicked; it's undutiful. I know how hard
it is not to repine and to rebel; but you mustn't, Olive, you
mustn't. We must each strive to bear our own burdens (with the help
of the community), and not to put any of them off upon a poor,
helpless, crippled little baby.'</p>
<p>'But our natures,' Clarence said, wiping his eyes dreamily; 'our
natures are only half attuned as yet to the necessities of the
higher social existence. Of course it's very wrong and very sad,
but we can't help feeling it, sister Rhoda, though we try our
hardest. Remember, it's not so many generations since our fathers
would have reared the child without a thought that they were doing
anything wicked&mdash;nay, rather, would even have held (so
powerful is custom) that it was positively wrong to save it by
preventive means from a certain life of predestined misery. Our
conscience in this matter isn't yet fully formed. We feel that it's
right, of course; oh yes, we know the phalanstery has ordered
everything for the best; but we can't help grieving over it; the
human heart within us is too unregenerate still to acquiesce
without a struggle in the dictates of right and reason.'</p>
<p>Olive again said nothing, but fixed her eyes silently upon the
grave, earnest portrait of the Founder over the carved oak
mantelpiece, and let the hot tears stream their own way over her
cold, white, pallid, bloodless cheek without reproof for many
minutes. Her heart was too full for either speech or comfort.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>Eight decades passed away slowly in the Avondale Phalanstery;
and day after day seemed more and more terrible to poor, weak,
disconsolate Olive. The quiet refinement and delicate surroundings
of their placid life seemed to make her poignant misery and long
anxious term of waiting only the more intense in its sorrow and its
awesomeness. Every day the younger sisters turned as of old to
their allotted round of pleasant housework; every day the elder
sisters, who had earned their leisure, brought in their dainty
embroidery, or their drawing materials, or their other occupations,
and tried to console her, or rather to condole with her, in her
great sorrow. She couldn't complain of any unkindness; on the
contrary, all the brothers and sisters were sympathy itself; while
Clarence, though he tried hard not to be <i>too</i> idolatrous to
her (which is wrong and antisocial, of course), was still
overflowing with tenderness and consideration for her in their
common grief. But all that seemed merely to make things worse. If
only somebody would have been cruel to her; if only the hierarch
would have scolded her, or the elder sisters have shown any distant
coldness, or the other girls have been wanting in sisterly
sympathy, she might have got angry or brooded over her wrongs;
whereas, now, she could do nothing save cry passively with a vain
attempt at resignation. It was nobody's fault; there was nobody to
be angry with, there was nothing to blame except the great
impersonal laws and circumstances of the Cosmos, which it would be
rank impiety and wickedness to question or to gainsay. So she
endured in silence, loving only to sit with Clarence's hand in
hers, and the dear doomed baby lying peacefully upon the stole in
her lap. It was inevitable, and there was no use repining; for so
profoundly had the phalanstery schooled the minds and natures of
those two unhappy young parents (and all their compeers), that
grieve as they might, they never for one moment dreamt of
attempting to relax or set aside the fundamental principles of
phalansteric society in these matters.</p>
<p>By the kindly rule of the phalanstery, every mother had complete
freedom from household duties for two years after the birth of her
child; and Clarence, though he would not willingly have given up
his own particular work in the grounds and garden, spent all the
time he could spare from his short daily task (every one worked
five hours every lawful day, and few worked longer, save on special
emergencies) by Olive's side. At last, the eight decades passed
slowly away, and the fatal day for the removal of little Rosebud
arrived. Olive called her Rosebud because, she said, she was a
sweet bud that could never be opened into a full-blown rose. All
the community felt the solemnity of the painful occasion; and by
common consent the day (Darwin, December 20) was held as an
intra-phalansteric fast by the whole body of brothers and
sisters.</p>
<p>On that terrible morning Olive rose early, and dressed herself
carefully in a long white stole with a broad black border of Greek
key pattern. But she had not the heart to put any black upon dear
little Rosebud; and so she put on her fine flannel wrapper, and
decorated it instead with the pretty coloured things that Veronica
and Philomela had worked for her, to make her baby as beautiful as
possible on this its last day in a world of happiness. The other
girls helped her and tried to sustain her, crying all together at
the sad event. 'She's a sweet little thing,' they said to one
another as they held her up to see how she looked. 'If only it
could have been her reception to-day instead of her removal!' But
Olive moved through them all with stoical
resignation&mdash;dry-eyed and parched in the throat, yet saying
not a word save for necessary instructions and directions to the
nursing sisters. The iron of her creed had entered into her very
soul.</p>
<p>After breakfast, brother Eustace and the hierarch came sadly in
their official robes into the lesser infirmary. Olive was there
already, pale and trembling, with little Rosebud sleeping
peacefully in the hollow of her lap. What a picture she looked, the
wee dear thing, with the hothouse flowers from the conservatory
that Clarence had brought to adorn her fastened neatly on to her
fine flannel robe! The physiologist took out a little phial from
his pocket, and began to open a sort of inhaler of white muslin. At
the same moment, the grave, kind old hierarch stretched out his
hands to take the sleeping baby from its mother's arms. Olive
shrank back in terror, and clasped the child softly to her heart.
'No, no, let me hold her myself, dear hierarch,' she said, without
flinching. 'Grant me this one last favour. Let me hold her myself.'
It was contrary to all fixed rules; but neither the hierarch nor
any one else there present had the heart to refuse that beseeching
voice on so supreme and spirit-rending an occasion.</p>
<p>Brother Eustace poured the chloroform solemnly and quietly on to
the muslin inhaler. 'By resolution of the phalanstery,' he said, in
a voice husky with emotion, 'I release you, Rosebud, from a life
for which you are naturally unfitted. In pity for your hard fate,
we save you from the misfortune you have never known, and will
never now experience.' As he spoke he held the inhaler to the
baby's face, and watched its breathing grow fainter and fainter,
till at last, after a few minutes, it faded gradually and entirely
away. The little one had slept from life into death, painlessly and
happily, even as they looked.</p>
<p>Clarence, tearful but silent, felt the baby's pulse for a
moment, and then, with a burst of tears, shook his head bitterly.
'It is all over,' he cried with a loud cry. 'It is all over; and we
hope and trust it is better so.'</p>
<p>But Olive still said nothing.</p>
<p>The physiologist turned to her with an anxious gaze. Her eyes
were open, but they looked blank and staring into vacant space. He
took her hand, and it felt limp and powerless. 'Great heaven!' he
cried, in evident alarm, 'what is this? Olive, Olive, our dear
Olive, why don't you speak?'</p>
<p>Clarence sprang up from the ground, where he had knelt to try
the dead baby's pulse, and took her unresisting wrist anxiously in
his. 'Oh, brother Eustace,' he cried passionately, 'help us, save
us; what's the matter with Olive? she's fainting, she's fainting! I
can't feel her heart beat, no, not ever so little.'</p>
<p>Brother Eustace let the pale white hand drop listlessly from his
grasp upon the pale white stole beneath, and answered slowly and
distinctly: 'She isn't fainting, Clarence; not fainting, my dear
brother. The shock and the fumes of chloroform together have been
too much for the action of the heart. She's dead too, Clarence; our
dear, dear sister; she's dead too.'</p>
<p>Clarence flung his arms wildly round Olive's neck, and listened
eagerly with his ear against her bosom to hear her heart beat. But
no sound came from the folds of the simple black-bordered stole; no
sound from anywhere save the suppressed sobs of the frightened
women who huddled closely together in the corner, and gazed
horror-stricken upon the two warm fresh corpses.</p>
<p>'She was a brave girl,' brother Eustace said at last, wiping his
eyes and composing her hands reverently. 'Olive was a brave girl,
and she died doing her duty, without one murmur against the sad
necessity that fate had unhappily placed upon her. No sister on
earth could wish to die more nobly than by thus sacrificing her own
life and her own weak human affections on the altar of humanity for
the sake of her child and of the world at large.'</p>
<p>'And yet, I sometimes almost fancy,' the hierarch murmured, with
a violent effort to control his emotions, 'when I see a scene like
this, that even the unenlightened practices of the old era may not
have been quite so bad as we usually think them, for all that.
Surely an end such as Olive's is a sad and a terrible end to have
forced upon us as the final outcome and natural close of all our
modern phalansteric civilisation.'</p>
<p>'The ways of the Cosmos are wonderful,' said brother Eustace
solemnly; 'and we, who are no more than atoms and mites upon the
surface of its meanest satellite, cannot hope so to order all
things after our own fashion that all its minutest turns and
chances may approve themselves to us as right in our own eyes.'</p>
<p>The sisters all made instinctively the reverential genuflexion.
'The Cosmos is infinite,' they said together, in the fixed formula
of their cherished religion. 'The Cosmos is infinite, and man is
but a parasite upon the face of the least among its satellite
members. May we so act as to further all that is best within us,
and to fulfil our own small place in the system of the Cosmos with
all becoming reverence and humility! In the name of universal
Humanity. So be it.'</p>

<h3>THE ABBÉ'S REPENTANCE</h3>
<p>Ivy Stanbury had never been in the South before. So everything
burst full upon her with all the charm of novelty. As they reached
Antibes Station, the sun was setting. A pink glow from his
blood-red orb lit up the snowy ridge of the Maritime Alps with
fairy splendour. It was a dream of delight to those eager young
eyes, fresh from the fog and frost and brooding gloom of London. In
front, the deep blue port, the long white mole, the picturesque
lighthouse, the arcaded breakwater, the sea just flecked with
russet lateen sails, the coasting craft that lay idle by the quays
in the harbour. Further on, the mouldering grey town, enclosed in
its mediæval walls, and topped by its two tall towers: the square
bastions and angles of Vauban's great fort: the laughing coast
towards Nice, dotted over with white villages perched high among
dark hills: and beyond all, soaring up into the cloudless sky, the
phantom peaks of those sun-smitten mountains. No lovelier sight can
eye behold round the enchanted Mediterranean: what wonder Ivy
Stanbury gazed at it that first night of her sojourn in the South
with unfeigned admiration?</p>
<p>'It's beautiful,' she broke forth, drawing a deep breath as she
spoke, and gazing up at the clear-cut outlines of the Cime de
Mercantourn. 'More beautiful than anything I could have imagined,
almost.'</p>
<p>But Aunt Emma was busy looking after the luggage, registered
through from London. '<i>Quatre colis</i>, all told, and then the
rugs and the hold-all! Maria should have fastened those straps more
securely. And where's the black bag? And the thing with the etna?
And mind you take care of my canary, Ivy.'</p>
<p>Ivy stood still and gazed. So like a vision did those dainty
pink summits, all pencilled with dark glens, hang mystic in the
air. To think about luggage at such a moment as this was, to her,
sheer desecration. And how wine-coloured was the dark sea in the
evening light: and how antique the grey Greek town: and how
delicious the sunset! The snowiest peaks of all stood out now in
the very hue of the pinky nacre that lines a shell: the shadows of
the gorges that scored their smooth sides showed up in delicate
tints of pale green and dark purple. Ivy drew a deep breath again,
and clutched the bird-cage silently.</p>
<p>The long drive to the hotel across the olive-clad promontory,
between bay and bay, was one continuous joy to her. Here and there
rocky inlets opened out for a moment to right or left, hemmed in by
tiny crags, where the blue sea broke in milky foam upon
weather-beaten skerries. Coquettish white villas gleamed rosy in
the setting sun among tangled gardens of strange shrubs, whose very
names Ivy knew not&mdash;date-palms, and fan-palms, and eucalyptus,
and mimosa, and green Mediterranean pine, and tall flowering agavé.
At last, the tired horses broke into a final canter, and drew up
before the broad stairs of the hotel on the headland. A vista
through the avenue revealed to Ivy's eyes a wide strip of sea, and
beyond it again the jagged outline of the Estérel, most exquisitely
shaped of earthly mountains, silhouetted in deep blue against the
fiery red of a sky just fading from the afterglow into profound
darkness.</p>
<p>She could hardly dress for dinner, for looking out of the
window. Even in that dim evening light, the view across the bay was
too exquisite to be neglected.</p>
<p>However, by dint of frequent admonitions from Aunt Emma, through
the partition door, she managed at last to rummage out her little
white evening dress&mdash;a soft nun's-cloth, made full in the
bodice&mdash;and scrambled through in the nick of time, as the
dinner-bell was ringing.</p>
<p><i>Table d'hôte</i> was fairly full. Most of the guests were
ladies. But to Ivy's surprise, and perhaps even dismay, she found
herself seated next a tall young man in the long black cassock of a
Catholic priest, with a delicate pale face, very austere and
clear-cut. This was disconcerting to Ivy, for, in the English way,
she had a vague feeling in her mind that priests, after all, were
not quite human.</p>
<p>The tall young man, however, turned to her after a minute's
pause with a frank and pleasant smile, which seemed all at once to
bespeak her sympathy. He had an even row of white teeth, Ivy
observed, and thin, thoughtful lips, and a cultivated air, and the
mien of a gentleman. Cardinal Manning must surely have looked like
that when he was an Anglican curate. So austere was the young man's
face, yet so gentle, so engaging.</p>
<p>'Mademoiselle has just arrived to-day?' he said interrogatively,
in the pure, sweet French of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Ivy could
see at a glance he felt she was shy of him, and was trying to
reassure her. 'What a beautiful sunset we've had! What light! What
colour!'</p>
<p>His voice rang so soft that Ivy plucked up heart of grace to
answer him boldly in her own pretty variation of the Ollendorffian
dialect, 'Yes, it was splendid, splendid. This is the first time I
visit the Mediterranean, and coming from the cold North, its beauty
takes my breath away.'</p>
<p>'Mademoiselle is French, then?' the young priest asked, with the
courtly flattery that sits so naturally on his countrymen. 'No,
English? Really! And nevertheless you speak with a charming accent.
But all English ladies speak French to-day. Yes, this place is
lovely: nothing lovelier on the coast. I went up this evening to
the hill that forms the centre of our little
promontory&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'The hill with the lighthouse that we passed on our way?' Ivy
asked, proud at heart that she could remember the word <i>phare</i>
off-hand, without reference to the dictionary.</p>
<p>The Abbé bowed. 'Yes, the hill with the lighthouse,' he
answered, hardly venturing to correct her by making <i>phare</i>
masculine.' There is there a sanctuary of Our Lady&mdash;Notre-Dame
de la Garoupe,&mdash;and I mounted up to it by the Chemin de la
Croix, to make my devotions. And after spending a little half-hour
all alone in the oratory, I went out upon the platform, and sat at
the foot of the cross, and looked before me upon the view. Oh,
mademoiselle, how shall I say? it was divine! it was beautiful! The
light from the setting sun touched up those spotless temples of the
eternal snow with the rosy radiance of an angel's wing. It was a
prayer in marble. One would think the white and common daylight,
streaming through some dim cathedral window, made rich with
figures, was falling in crimson palpitations on the clasped hands
of some alabaster saint&mdash;so glorious was it, so
beautiful!'</p>
<p>Ivy smiled at his enthusiasm: it was so like her own&mdash;and
yet, oh, so different! But she admired the young Abbé, all the
same, for not being ashamed of his faith. What English curate would
have dared to board a stranger like that&mdash;with such a winning
confidence that the stranger would share his own point of view of
things? And then the touch of poetry that he threw into it all was
so delicately mediæval. Ivy looked at him and smiled again. The
priest had certainly begun by creating a favourable impression.</p>
<p>All through dinner, her new acquaintance talked to her
uninterruptedly. Ivy was quite charmed to see how far her meagre
French would carry her. And her neighbour was so polite, so grave,
so attentive. He never seemed to notice her mistakes of gender, her
little errors of tense or mood or syntax; he caught rapidly at what
she meant when she paused for a word: he finished her sentences for
her better than she could have done them herself: he never
suggested, he never corrected, he never faltered, but he helped her
out, as it were, unconsciously, without ever seeming to help her.
In a word, he had the manners of a born gentleman, with the polish
and the grace of good French society. And then, whatever he said
was so interesting and so well put. A tinge of Celtic imagination
lighted up all his talk. He was well read in his own literature,
and in English and German too. Nothing could have been more unlike
Ivy's preconceived idea of the French Catholic priest&mdash;the
rotund and rubicund village curé. The man was tall, slim, pathetic,
poetical-looking, with piercing black eyes, and features of
striking and statuesque beauty. But above all, Ivy felt now that he
was earnest, and human&mdash;intensely human.</p>
<p>Once only, when conversation rose loud across the table, the
Abbé ventured to ask, with bated breath, in a candid tone of
inquiry, 'Mademoiselle is Catholic?'</p>
<p>Ivy looked down at her plate as she answered in a timid voice,
'No, monsieur, Anglican.' Then she added, half apologetically, with
a deprecating smile, ''Tis the religion of my country, you know.'
For she feared she shocked him.</p>
<p>'Perfectly,' the Abbé answered, with a sweet smile of resigned
regret; and he murmured something half to himself in the Latin
tongue, which Ivy didn't understand. It was a verse from the
Vulgate, 'Other sheep have I which are not of this fold: them also
will I bring in.' For he was a tolerant man, though devout, that
Abbé, and Mademoiselle was charming. Had not even the Church itself
held that Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, I know not how many
more&mdash;and then, Mademoiselle no doubt erred through ignorance
of the Faith, and the teaching of her parents!</p>
<p>After dinner they strolled out into the great entrance-hall. The
Abbé, with a courtly bow, went off, half reluctant, in another
direction. On a table close by, the letters that came by the
evening post lay displayed in long rows for visitors to claim their
own. With true feminine curiosity, Ivy glanced over the names of
her fellow-guests. One struck her at once&mdash;'M. l'Abbé de
Kermadec.' 'That must be our priest, Aunt Emma,' she said, looking
close at it. And the English barrister with the loud voice, who sat
opposite her at table, made answer, somewhat bluffly, 'Yes, that's
the priest, M. Guy de Kermadec. You can see with half an eye he's
above the common ruck of 'em. Belongs to a very distinguished
Breton family, so I'm told. Of late years, you know, there's been a
reaction in France in favour of piety. It's the mode to be
<i>dévot</i>. The Royalists think religion goes hand in hand with
legitimacy. So several noble families send a younger son into the
Church now again, as before the Revolution&mdash;make a decorative
Abbé of him. It's quite the thing, as times go. The eldest son of
the Kermadecs is a marquis, I believe&mdash;one of their trumpery
marquee's&mdash;has a château in Morbihan&mdash;the second son's in
a cavalry regiment, and serves La France; the third's in the
Church, and saves the souls of the family. That's the way they do
now. Division of labour, don't you see! Number one plays, number
two fights, number three prays. Land, army, piety.'</p>
<p>'Oh, indeed,' Ivy answered, shrinking into her shell at once.
She didn't know why, but it jarred upon her somehow to hear the
English barrister with the loud bluff voice speak like that about
her neighbour. M. Guy de Kermadec was of gentler mould, she felt
sure, than the barrister's coarse red hands should handle.</p>
<p>They stayed there some weeks. Aunt Emma's lungs were endowed
with a cavity. So Aunt Emma did little but sun herself on the
terrace, and chirp to the canary, and look across at the Estérel.
But Ivy was strong, her limbs were a tomboy's, and she wandered
about by herself to her heart's content over that rocky peninsula.
On her first morning at the Cape, indeed, she strolled out alone,
following a footpath that led through a green strip of pine-wood,
fragrant on either side with lentisk scrub and rosemary. It brought
her out upon the sea, near the very end of the promontory, at a
spot where white rocks, deeply honeycombed by the ceaseless spray
of centuries, lay tossed in wild confusion, stack upon stack, rent
and fissured. Low bushes, planed level by the wind, sloped
gradually upward. A <i>douanier's</i> trail threaded the rugged
maze. Ivy turned to the left and followed it on, well pleased, past
huge tors and deep gullies. Here and there, taking advantage of the
tilt of the strata, the sea had worn itself great caves and
blow-holes. A slight breeze was rolling breakers up these miniature
gorges. Ivy stood and watched them tumble in, the deep peacock blue
of the outer sea changing at once into white foam as they curled
over and shattered themselves on the green slimy reefs that blocked
their progress.</p>
<p>By and by she reached a spot where a clump of tall aloes, with
prickly points, grew close to the edge of the rocks in true African
luxuriance. Just beyond them, on the brink, a man sat bare-headed,
his legs dangling over a steep undermined cliff. The limestone was
tilted up there at such an acute angle that the crag overhung the
sea by a yard or two, and waves dashed themselves below into a
thick rain of spray without wetting the top. Ivy had clambered half
out to the edge before she saw who the man was. Then he turned his
head at the sound of her footfall, and sprang to his feet
hastily.</p>
<p>'Take care, mademoiselle,' he said, holding his round hat in his
left hand, and stretching out his right to steady her. 'Such spots
as these are hardly meant for skirts like yours&mdash;or mine. One
false step, and over you go. I'm a pretty strong swimmer
myself&mdash;our Breton sea did so much for me; but no swimmer on
earth could live against the force of those crushing breakers.
They'd catch a man on their crests, and pound him to a jelly on the
jagged needles of rock. They'd hurl him on to the crumbling
pinnacles, and then drag him back with their undertow, and crush
him at last, as in a gigantic mortar, till every trait, every
feature, was indistinguishable.'</p>
<p>'Thank you,' Ivy answered, taking his proffered hand as
innocently as she would have taken her father's curate's. 'It's
just beautiful out here, isn't it?' She seated herself on the ledge
near the spot where he had been sitting. 'How grandly the waves
roll in!' she cried, eyeing them with girlish delight. 'Do you come
here often, M. l'Abbé?'</p>
<p>The Abbé gazed at her, astonished. How strange are the ways of
these English! He was a priest, to be sure, a celibate by
profession; but he was young, he was handsome&mdash;he knew he was
good-looking; and mademoiselle was unmarried! This chance meeting
embarrassed him, to say the truth, far more than it did
Ivy&mdash;though Ivy too was shy, and a little conscious blush that
just tinged her soft cheek, made her look, the Abbé noted, even
prettier than ever. But still, if he was a priest, he was also a
gentleman. So, after a moment's demur, he sat down, a little way
off&mdash;further off, indeed, than the curate would have thought
it necessary to sit from her&mdash;and answered very gravely in
that soft low voice of his, 'Yes, I come here often, very often.
It's my favourite seat. On these rocks one seems to lose sight of
the world and the work of man's hand, and to stand face to face
with the eternal and the infinite.' He waved his arm, as he spoke,
towards the horizon, vaguely.</p>
<p>'I like it for its wildness,' Ivy said simply. 'These crags are
so beautiful.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' the young priest answered, looking across at them
pensively, 'I like to think, for my part, that for thousands of
years the waves have been dashing against them, day and night,
night and day, in a ceaseless rhythm, since the morning of the
creation. I like to think that before ever a Phocæan galley steered
its virgin trip into the harbour of Antipolis, this honeycombing
had begun; that when the Holy Maries of the Sea passed by our Cape
on their miraculous voyage to the mouths of the Rhone, they saw
this headland, precisely as we see it to-day, on their starboard
bow, all weather-eaten and weather-beaten.'</p>
<p>Ivy lounged with her feet dangling over the edge, as the Abbé
had done before. The Abbé sat and looked at her in fear and
trembling. If mademoiselle were to slip, now. His heart came up in
his mouth at the thought. He was a priest, to be sure; but at
seven-and-twenty, mark you well, even priests are human. They, too,
have hearts. Anatomically they resemble the rest of their kind; it
is only the cassock that makes the outer difference.</p>
<p>But Ivy sat talking in her imperfect French, with very little
sense of how much trouble she was causing him. She didn't know that
the Abbé, too, trembled on the very brink of a precipice. But his
was a moral one. By and by she rose. The Abbé stretched out his
hand, and lent it to her politely. He could do no less; yet the
touch of her ungloved fingers thrilled him. What a pity so fair a
lamb should stray so far from the true fold! Had Our Lady brought
him this chance? Was it his duty to lead her, to guide her, to save
her?</p>
<p>'Which is the way to the lighthouse hill?' Ivy asked him
carelessly.</p>
<p>The words seemed to his full heart like a sacred omen. For on
the lighthouse hill, as on all high places in Provence, stood also
a lighthouse of the soul, a sanctuary of Our Lady, that Notre-Dame
de la Garoupe whereof he had told her yesterday. And of her own
accord she had asked the way now to Our Lady's shrine. He would
guide her like a beacon. This was the finger of Providence. Sure,
Our Lady herself had put the thought into the heart of her.</p>
<p>'I go that way myself,' he said, rejoicing. 'If mademoiselle
will allow me, I will show her the path. Every day I go up there to
make my devotions.'</p>
<p>As they walked by the seaward trail, and climbed the craggy
little hill, the Abbé discoursed very pleasantly about many things.
Not religion alone; he was a priest, but no bigot. An enthusiast
for the sea, as becomes a Morbihan man, he loved it from every
point of view, as swimmer, yachtsman, rower, landscape artist. His
talk was of dangers confronted on stormy nights along the Ligurian
coast; of voyages to Corsica, to the Channel Islands, to Bilbao; of
great swims about Sark; of climbs among the bare summits over
yonder by Turbia. And he was wide-minded too; for he spoke with
real affection of a certain neighbour of theirs in Morbihan; he was
proud of the great writer's pure Breton blood, though he deprecated
his opinions&mdash;'But he's so kind and good after all, that dear
big Rénan!' Ivy started with surprise; not so had she heard the
noblest living master of French prose discussed and described in
their Warwickshire rectory. But every moment she saw yet clearer
that anything more unlike her preconceived idea of a Catholic
priest than this ardent young Celt could hardly be imagined.
Fervent and fervid, he led the conversation like one who spoke with
tongues. For herself she said little by the way; her French halted
sadly; but she listened with real pleasure to the full flowing
stream of the young man's discourse. After all, she knew now, he
was a young man at least&mdash;not human alone, but vivid and
virile as well, in spite of his petticoats.</p>
<p>People forget too often that putting on a <i>soutane</i> doesn't
necessarily make a strong nature feminine.</p>
<p>At the top of the lighthouse hill Ivy paused, delighted. Worlds
opened before her. To right and left, in rival beauty, spread a
glorious panorama. She stood and gazed at it entranced. She had
plenty of time indeed to drink in to the full those two blue bays,
with their contrasted mountain barriers&mdash;snowy Alps to the
east, purple Estérel to westward&mdash;for the Abbé had gone into
the rustic chapel to make his devotions. When he came out again,
curiosity tempted Ivy for a moment into that bare little
whitewashed barn. It was a Provençal fisher shrine of the rudest
antique type; its gaudy Madonna, tricked out with paper flowers,
stood under a crude blue canopy, set with tinsel-gilt stars; the
rough walls hung thick with ex-voto's of coarse and naïve
execution. Here, sailors in peril emerged from a watery grave by
the visible appearance of Our Lady issuing in palpable wood from a
very solid cloud of golden glory; there, a gig going down hill was
stopped forcibly from above with hands laid on the reins by Our
Lady in person; and yonder, again, a bursting gun did nobody any
harm, for had not Our Lady caught the fragments in her own stiff
fingers? Ivy gazed with a certain hushed awe at these nascent
efforts of art; such a gulf seemed to yawn between that tawdry
little oratory and the Abbé's own rich and cultivated nature. Yet
he went to pray there!</p>
<p>For the next three weeks Ivy saw much of M. Guy de Kermadec. She
taught him lawn-tennis, which he learned, indeed, with ease. At
first, to be sure, the English in the hotel rather derided the idea
of lawn-tennis in a cassock. But the Abbé was an adept at the
<i>jeu de paume</i>, which had already educated his hand and eye,
and he dropped into the new game so quickly, in spite of the
<i>soutane</i>, which sadly impeded his running, that even the
Cambridge undergraduate with the budding moustache was forced to
acknowledge 'the Frenchy' a formidable competitor. And then Ivy met
him often in his strolls round the coast. He used to sit and sketch
among the rocks, perched high on the most inaccessible pinnacles;
and Ivy, it must be admitted, though she hardly knew why
herself&mdash;so innocent is youth, so too dangerously
innocent&mdash;went oftenest by the paths where she was likeliest
to meet him. There she would watch the progress of his sketch, and
criticise and admire; and in the end, when she rose to go, native
politeness made it impossible for the Abbé to let her walk home
unprotected, so he accompanied her back by the coast path to the
hotel garden. Ivy hardly noticed that as he reached it he almost
invariably lifted his round hat at once and dismissed her,
unofficially as it were, to the society of her compatriots. But the
Abbé, more used to the ways of the world and of France, knew well
how unwise it was of him&mdash;a man of the Church&mdash;to walk
with a young girl alone so often in the country. A priest should be
circumspect.</p>
<p>Day after day, slowly, very slowly, the truth began to dawn by
degrees upon the Abbé de Kermadec that he was in love with Ivy. At
first, he fought the idea tooth and nail, like an evil vision. He
belonged to the Church, the Bride of Heaven: what had such as he to
do with mere carnal desires and earthly longings? But day by day,
as Ivy met him, and talked with him more confidingly, her French
growing more fluent by leaps and bounds under that able tutor Love,
whose face as yet she recognised not&mdash;nature began to prove
too strong for the Abbé's resolution. He found her company sweet.
The position was so strange, and to him so incomprehensible. If Ivy
had been a French girl, of course he could never have seen so much
of her: her mother or her maid would have mounted guard over her
night and day. Only with a married woman could he have involved
himself so deeply in France: and then, the sinfulness of their
intercourse would have been clear from the very outset to both
alike of them. But what charmed and attracted him most in Ivy was
just her English innocence. She was so gentle, so guileless. This
pure creature of God's never seemed to be aware she was doing
grievously wrong. The man who had voluntarily resigned all hope or
chance of chaste love was now irresistibly led on by the very force
of the spell he had renounced for ever.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;how hard it is for us to throw ourselves
completely into somebody else's attitude! So French was he, so
Catholic, that he couldn't quite understand the full depth of Ivy's
innocence. This girl who could walk and talk so freely with a
priest&mdash;surely she must be aware of what thing she was doing.
She must know she was leading him and herself into a dangerous
love, a love that could end in none but a guilty conclusion.</p>
<p>So thinking, and praying, and fighting against it, and despising
himself, the young Abbé yet persisted half unawares on the path of
destruction. His hot Celtic imagination proved too much for his
self-control. All night long he lay awake, tossing and turning on
his bed, alternately muttering fervent prayers to Our Lady, and
building up for himself warm visions of his next meeting with Ivy.
In the morning, he would rise up early, and go afoot to the shrine
of Notre-Dame de la Garoupe, and cry aloud with fiery zeal for
help, that he might be delivered from temptation:&mdash;and then he
would turn along the coast, towards his accustomed seat, looking
out eagerly for the rustle of Ivy's dress among the cistus-bushes.
When at last he met her, a great wave passed over him like a blush.
He thrilled from head to foot. He grew cold. He trembled
inwardly.</p>
<p>Not for nothing had he lived near the monastery of St. Gildas de
Rhuys. For such a Heloise as that, what priest would not gladly
become a second Abelard?</p>
<p>One morning, he met her by his overhanging ledge. The sea was
rough. The waves broke grandly.</p>
<p>Ivy came up to him, with that conscious blush of hers just
mantling her fair cheek. She liked him very much. But she was only
eighteen. At eighteen a girl hardly knows when she's in love. But
she vaguely suspects it.</p>
<p>The Abbé held out his hand. Ivy took it with a frank smile.
'Bonjour, M. de Kermadec!' she said lightly. She always addressed
him so&mdash;not as M. l'Abbé, now. Was that intentional, he
wondered? He took it to mean that she tried to forget his
ecclesiastical position. 'La tante Emma' should guard her treasure
in an earthen vessel more carefully. Why do these Protestants tempt
us priests with their innocent girls? He led her to a seat, and
gazed at her like a lover, his heart beating hard, and his knees
trembling violently. He <i>must</i> speak to her to-day. Though
<i>what</i>, he knew not.</p>
<p>He meant her no harm. He was too passionate, too pure, too
earnest for that. But he meant her no good either. He meant
nothing, nothing. Before her face he was a bark driven rudderless
by the breeze. He only knew he loved her: she <i>must</i> be his.
His passion hallowed his act. And she too, she loved him.</p>
<p>Leaning one hand on the rock, he talked to her for a while, he
hardly knew what. He saw she was tremulous. She looked down and
blushed often. That intangible, incomprehensible, invisible
something that makes lovers subtly conscious of one another's mood
had told her how he felt towards her. She tingled to the
finger-tips. It was sweet to be there&mdash;oh, how sweet, yet how
hopeless!</p>
<p>Romance to her: to him, sin, death, infamy.</p>
<p>At last he leaned across to her. She had answered him back once
more about some trifle, 'Mais, oui, M. de Kermadec.' 'Why this
"monsieur"?' the priest asked boldly, gazing deep into her startled
eyes. 'Je m'appelle Guy, mademoiselle. Why not Guy
then&mdash;Ivy?'</p>
<p>At the word her heart gave a bound. He had said it! He had said
it! He loved her; oh, how delicious! She could have cried for joy
at that implied avowal.</p>
<p>But she drew herself up for all that, like a pure-minded English
girl that she was, and answered with a red flush, 'Because&mdash;it
would be wrong, monsieur. You know very well, as things are, I
cannot.'</p>
<p>What a flush! what a halo! Madonna and vows were all forgotten
now. The Abbé flung himself forward in one wild burst of passion.
He gazed in her eyes, and all was lost. His hot Celtic soul poured
itself forth in full flood. He loved her: he adored her: she should
be his and his only. He had fought against it. But love&mdash;love
had conquered. 'Oh, Ivy,' he cried passionately, 'you will not
refuse me! You will be mine and mine only. You will love me as I
love you!'</p>
<p>Ivy's heart broke forth too. She looked at him and melted.
'Guy,' she answered, first framing the truth to herself in that
frank confession, 'I love you in return. I have loved you since the
very first moment I saw you.'</p>
<p>The Abbé seized her hand, and raised it rapturously to his lips.
'My beloved,' he cried, rosy red, 'you are mine, you are
mine&mdash;and I am yours for ever.'</p>
<p>Ivy drew back a little, somewhat abashed and alarmed by his
evident ardour. 'I wonder if I'm doing wrong?' she cried, with the
piteous uncertainty of early youth. 'Your vows, you know! your
vows! How will you ever get rid of them?'</p>
<p>The Abbé gazed at her astonished. What could this angel mean?
She wondered if she was doing wrong! Get rid of his vows! He, a
priest, to make love! What <i>naïveté</i>! What innocence!</p>
<p>But he was too hot to repent. 'My vows!' he cried, flinging them
from him with both hands into the sea. 'Ivy, let them go! Let the
waves bear them off! What are they to me now? I renounce them! I
have done with them!'</p>
<p>Ivy looked at him, breathing deep. Why, he loved her indeed. For
she knew how devoted he was, how earnest, how Catholic. 'Then
you'll join our Church,' she said simply, 'and give up your orders
and marry me!'</p>
<p>If a thunderbolt had fallen at the young priest's feet, its
effect could not have been more crushing, more instantaneous, more
extraordinary. In a moment, he had come to himself again, cooled,
astonished, horrified. Oh, what had he said? What had he done? What
vile sin had he committed? Not against Heaven, now, or the saints,
for of that and his own soul he thought just then but little: but
against that pure young girl whom he loved, that sweet creature of
innocence! And how could he ever explain to her? How retract? How
excuse himself? Even to attempt an explanation would be sheer
treason to her purity. The thought in his mind was too unholy for
her to hear. To tell her what he meant would be a crime, a sin, a
<i>bassesse</i>!</p>
<p>He saw it in an instant, how the matter would envisage itself to
her un-Catholic mind. She could never understand that to him, a
single fall, a temporary backsliding, was but a subject for
repentance, confession, absolution, pardon: while to renounce his
orders, renounce his Church, contract a marriage that in his eyes
would be no marriage at all, but a living lie, was to continue in
open sin, to degrade and dishonour her. For her own sake, even, if
saints and Madonna were not, Guy de Kermadec could never consent so
to taint and to sully her. That pure soul was too dear to him. He
had dreamed for a moment, indeed, of foul wrong, in the white heat
of passion: all men may be misled for a moment of impulse by the
strong demon within them: but to persevere in such wrong, to go on
sinning openly, flagrantly, shamelessly&mdash;Guy de Kermadec drew
back from the bare idea with disdain. As priest and as gentleman
alike, he looked down upon it and contemned it.</p>
<p>The reaction was profound. For a minute or two he gazed into
Ivy's face like one spellbound. He paused and hesitated. What way
out of this maze? How on earth could he undeceive her? Then
suddenly, with a loud cry, he sprang to his feet like one shot, and
stood up by the edge of the rocks in his long black <i>soutane</i>.
He held out his hands to raise her. 'Mademoiselle,' he groaned
aloud from his heart, in a very broken tone, 'I have done
wrong&mdash;grievous wrong: I have sinned&mdash;against Heaven and
against you, and am no more worthy to be called a priest.' He
raised his voice solemnly. It was the voice of a bruised and
wounded creature. 'Go back!' he cried once more, waving her away
from him as from one polluted. 'You can never forgive me. But at
least, go back. I should have cut out my tongue rather than have
spoken so to you. I am a leper&mdash;a wild beast. Ten thousand
times over, I crave your pardon.'</p>
<p>Ivy gazed at him, thunderstruck. In her innocence, she hardly
knew what the man even meant. But she saw her romance had toppled
over to its base, and shattered itself to nothing. Slowly she rose,
and took his hand across the rocks to steady her. They reached the
track in silence. As they gained it, the Abbé raised his hat for
the last time, and turned away bitterly. He took the path to the
right. Obedient to his gesture, Ivy went to the left. Back to the
hotel she went, lingering, with a heart like a stone, locked
herself up in her own room, and cried long and silently.</p>
<p>But as for Guy de Kermadec, all on fire with his remorse, he
walked fast along the sea-shore, over the jagged rock path, toward
the town of Antibes.</p>
<p>Through the narrow streets of the old city he made his way, like
a blind man, to the house of a priest whom he knew. His heart was
seething now with regret and shame and horror. What vile thing was
this wherewith he, a priest of God, had ventured to affront the
pure innocence of a maiden? What unchastity had he forced on the
chaste eyes of girlhood? Ivy had struck him dumb by her very
freedom from all guile. And it was she, the heretic, for whose soul
he had wrestled in prayer with Our Lady, who had brought him back
with a bound to the consciousness of sin, and the knowledge of
purity, from the very brink of a precipice.</p>
<p>He knocked at the door of his friend's house like a moral
leper.</p>
<p>His brother-priest received him kindly. Guy de Kermadec was
pale, but his manner was wild, like one mad with frenzy. 'Mon
père,' he said straight out, 'I have come to confess, <i>in
articulo mortis</i>. I feel I shall die to-night. I have a warning
from Our Lady. I ask you for absolution, a blessing, the holy
sacrament, extreme unction. If you refuse them, I die. Give me God
at your peril.'</p>
<p>The elder priest hesitated. How could he give the host otherwise
than to a person fasting? How administer extreme unction save to a
dying man? But Guy de Kermadec, in his fiery haste, overbore all
scrupulous ecclesiastical objections. He <i>was</i> a dying man, he
cried: Our Lady's own warning was surely more certain than the
guess or conjecture of a mere earthly doctor. The viaticum he
demanded, and the viaticum he must have. He was to die that night.
He knew it. He was sure of it.</p>
<p>He knelt down and confessed. He would brook no refusal. The
country priest, all amazed, sat and listened to him, breathless.
Once or twice he drew his sleek hand over his full fat face
doubtfully. The strange things this hot Breton said to him were
beyond his comprehension. They spoke different languages. How could
he, good easy soul, with his cut-and-dried theology, fathom the
fiery depths of that volcanic bosom? He nursed his chin in
suspense, and marvelled. Other priests had gone astray. Why this
wild fever of repentance? Other women had been tempted. Why this
passionate tenderness for the sensibilities of a mere English
heretic? Other girls had sinned outright. Why this horror at the
harm done to her in intention only?</p>
é
<p>But to Guy de Kermadec himself it was a crime of
<i>lè-majesté</i> against a young girl's purity. A crime whose very
nature it would be criminal to explain to her. A crime that he
could only atone with his life. Apology was impossible. Explanation
was treason. Nothing remained for it now but the one resource of
silence.</p>
<p>In an orgy of penitence, the young priest confessed, and
received absolution: he took the viaticum, trembling; he obtained
extreme unction. Then, with a terrible light in his eyes, he went
into a stationer's shop, and in tremulous lines wrote a note, which
he posted to Ivy.</p>
<blockquote>'Très chère dame,' it said simply, 'you will see me no
more. This morning, I offered, half unawares, a very great wrong to
you. Your own words, and Our Lady's intervention, brought me back
to myself. Thank Heaven, it was in time. I might have wronged you
more. My last prayers are for your pure soul. Pray for mine and
forgive me.<br>
<br>
Adieu! Guy de Kermadec.'</blockquote>
<p>After that, he strode out to the Cape once more. It was growing
dark by that time, for he was long at Antibes. He walked with fiery
eagerness to the edge of the cliff, where he had sat with joy that
morning&mdash;where he had sat before so often. The brink of the
rocks was wet with salt spray, very smooth and slippery. The Abbé
stood up, and looked over at the black water. The Church makes
suicide a sin, and he would obey the Church. But no canon prevents
one from leaning over the edge of a cliff, to admire the dark
waves. They rolled in with a thud, and broke in sheets of white
spray against the honeycombed base of the rock, invisible beneath
him.</p>
<p>'Si dextra tua tibi offenderit,' they said, in their long slow
chant&mdash;'si dextra tua tibi offenderit.' If thy right hand
offend thee, cut it off. And Ivy was dearer to him than his own
right hand. Yet not for that, oh Mary, Star of the Sea, not for
that; nor yet for his own salvation;&mdash;let him burn, if need
were, in nethermost hell, to atone this error&mdash;but for that
pure maid's sake, and for the cruel wrong he had put upon her. 'Oh,
Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows,' he cried, wringing his hands in his
agony, 'who wert a Virgin thyself, help and succour this virgin in
her own great sorrow. Thou knowest her innocence, her
guilelessness, her simplicity, and the harm beyond healing that I
wrought her unawares. Oh, blot it out of her pure white soul and
bless her. Thou knowest that for her sake alone, and to undo this
sin to her, I stand here to-night, on the brink of the precipice.
Queen of the Waves, Our Lady of the Look-out, if the sacrifice
please thee, take me thus to thine own bosom. Let thy billows rise
up and blot out my black sin. Oh, Mary, hear me! <i>Stella maris
adesto!</i>'</p>
<p>He stood there for hours, growing colder and stiffer. It was
quite dark now, and the sea was rising. Yet still he prayed on, and
still the spray dashed upward. At last, as he prayed in the dim
night, erect, with bare head, a great wave broke higher than ever
over the rocks below him. With a fierce joy, Guy de Kermadec felt
it thrill through the thickness of the cliff: then it rose in a
head, and burst upon him with a roar like the noise of thunder. He
lost his footing, and fell, clutching at the jagged pinnacles for
support, into the deep trough below. There, the billows caught him
up, and pounded him on the sharp crags. Thank Heaven for that
mercy! Our Lady had heard his last prayer. Mary, full of grace, had
been pleased to succour him. With a penance of blood, from torn
hands and feet, was he expiating his sin against Heaven and against
Ivy.</p>
<p>Next morning, the <i>douanier</i>, pacing the shore alone, saw a
dead body entangled among the sharp rocks by the precipice.
Climbing down on hands and knees, he fished it out with difficulty,
and ran to fetch a gendarme. The face was beaten to a jelly, past
all recognition, and the body was mangled in a hideous fashion. But
it wore a rent <i>soutane</i>, all in ribbons on the rocks; and the
left third finger bore a signet-ring with a coat of arms and the
motto, 'Foy d'un Kermadec.'</p>
<p>Ivy is still unwed. No eye but hers has ever seen Guy de
Kermadec's last letter.</p>

<h3>WOLVERDEN TOWER</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Maisie Llewelyn had never been asked to Wolverden before;
therefore, she was not a little elated at Mrs. West's invitation.
For Wolverden Hall, one of the loveliest Elizabethan manor-houses
in the Weald of Kent, had been bought and fitted up in appropriate
style (the phrase is the upholsterer's) by Colonel West, the famous
millionaire from South Australia. The Colonel had lavished upon it
untold wealth, fleeced from the backs of ten thousand sheep and an
equal number of his fellow-countrymen; and Wolverden was now, if
not the most beautiful, at least the most opulent country-house
within easy reach of London.</p>
<p>Mrs. West was waiting at the station to meet Maisie. The house
was full of Christmas guests already, it is true; but Mrs. West was
a model of stately, old-fashioned courtesy: she would not have
omitted meeting one among the number on any less excuse than a
royal command to appear at Windsor. She kissed Maisie on both
cheeks&mdash;she had always been fond of Maisie&mdash;and, leaving
two haughty young aristocrats (in powdered hair and blue-and-gold
livery) to hunt up her luggage by the light of nature, sailed forth
with her through the door to the obsequious carriage.</p>
<p>The drive up the avenue to Wolverden Hall Maisie found quite
delicious. Even in their leafless winter condition the great limes
looked so noble; and the ivy-covered hall at the end, with its
mullioned windows, its Inigo Jones porch, and its creeper-clad
gables, was as picturesque a building as the ideals one sees in Mr.
Abbey's sketches. If only Arthur Hume had been one of the party
now, Maisie's joy would have been complete. But what was the use of
thinking so much about Arthur Hume, when she didn't even know
whether Arthur Hume cared for her?</p>
<p>A tall, slim girl, Maisie Llewelyn, with rich black hair, and
ethereal features, as became a descendant of Llewelyn ap
Iorwerth&mdash;the sort of girl we none of us would have called
anything more than 'interesting' till Rossetti and Burne-Jones
found eyes for us to see that the type is beautiful with a deeper
beauty than that of your obvious pink-and-white prettiness. Her
eyes, in particular, had a lustrous depth that was almost
superhuman, and her fingers and nails were strangely transparent in
their waxen softness.</p>
<p>'You won't mind my having put you in a ground-floor room in the
new wing, my dear, will you?' Mrs. West inquired, as she led Maisie
personally to the quarters chosen for her. 'You see, we're so
unusually full, because of these tableaux!'</p>
<p>Maisie gazed round the ground-floor room in the new wing with
eyes of mute wonder. If <i>this</i> was the kind of lodging for
which Mrs. West thought it necessary to apologise, Maisie wondered
of what sort were those better rooms which she gave to the guests
she delighted to honour. It was a large and exquisitely decorated
chamber, with the softest and deepest Oriental carpet Maisie's feet
had ever felt, and the daintiest curtains her eyes had ever lighted
upon. True, it opened by French windows on to what was nominally
the ground in front; but as the Italian terrace, with its formal
balustrade and its great stone balls, was raised several feet above
the level of the sloping garden below, the room was really on the
first floor for all practical purposes. Indeed, Maisie rather liked
the unwonted sense of space and freedom which was given by this
easy access to the world without; and, as the windows were secured
by great shutters and fasteners, she had no counterbalancing fear
lest a nightly burglar should attempt to carry off her little pearl
necklet or her amethyst brooch, instead of directing his whole
attention to Mrs. West's famous diamond tiara.</p>
<p>She moved naturally to the window. She was fond of nature. The
view it disclosed over the Weald at her feet was wide and varied.
Misty range lay behind misty range, in a faint December haze,
receding and receding, till away to the south, half hidden by
vapour, the Sussex downs loomed vague in the distance. The village
church, as happens so often in the case of old lordly manors, stood
within the grounds of the Hall, and close by the house. It had been
built, her hostess said, in the days of the Edwards, but had
portions of an older Saxon edifice still enclosed in the chancel.
The one eyesore in the view was its new white tower, recently
restored (or rather, rebuilt), which contrasted most painfully with
the mellow grey stone and mouldering corbels of the nave and
transept.</p>
<p>'What a pity it's been so spoiled!' Maisie exclaimed, looking
across at the tower. Coming straight as she did from a Merioneth
rectory, she took an ancestral interest in all that concerned
churches.</p>
<p>'Oh, my dear!' Mrs. West cried, '<i>please</i> don't say that, I
beg of you, to the Colonel. If you were to murmur "spoiled" to him
you'd wreck his digestion. He's spent ever so much money over
securing the foundations and reproducing the sculpture on the old
tower we took down, and it breaks his dear heart when anybody
disapproves of it. For <i>some</i> people, you know, are so
absurdly opposed to reasonable restoration.</p>
<p>'Oh, but this isn't even restoration, you know,' Maisie said,
with the frankness of twenty, and the specialist interest of an
antiquary's daughter. 'This is pure reconstruction.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps so,' Mrs. West answered. 'But if you think so, my dear,
don't breathe it at Wolverden.'</p>
<p>A fire, of ostentatiously wealthy dimensions, and of the best
glowing coal, burned bright on the hearth; but the day was mild,
and hardly more than autumnal. Maisie found the room quite
unpleasantly hot. She opened the windows and stepped out on the
terrace. Mrs. West followed her. They paced up and down the broad
gravelled platform for a while&mdash;Maisie had not yet taken off
her travelling-cloak and hat&mdash;and then strolled half
unconsciously towards the gate of the church. The churchyard, to
hide the tombstones of which the parapet had been erected, was full
of quaint old monuments, with broken-nosed cherubs, some of them
dating from a comparatively early period. The porch, with its
sculptured niches deprived of their saints by puritan hands, was
still rich and beautiful in its carved detail. On the seat inside
an old woman was sitting. She did not rise as the lady of the manor
approached, but went on mumbling and muttering inarticulately to
herself in a sulky undertone. Still, Maisie was aware, none the
less, that the moment she came near a strange light gleamed
suddenly in the old woman's eyes, and that her glance was fixed
upon her. A faint thrill of recognition seemed to pass like a flash
through her palsied body. Maisie knew not why, but she was dimly
afraid of the old woman's gaze upon her.</p>
<p>'It's a lovely old church!' Maisie said, looking up at the
trefoil finials on the porch&mdash;'all, except the tower.'</p>
<p>'We <i>had</i> to reconstruct it,' Mrs. West answered
apologetically&mdash;Mrs. West's general attitude in life was
apologetic, as though she felt she had no right to so much more
money than her fellow-creatures. 'It would have fallen if we hadn't
done something to buttress it up. It was really in a most dangerous
and critical condition.'</p>
<p>'Lies! lies! lies!' the old woman burst out suddenly, though in
a strange, low tone, as if speaking to herself. 'It would
<i>not</i> have fallen&mdash;they knew it would not. It could not
have fallen. It would never have fallen if they had not destroyed
it. And even then&mdash;I was there when they pulled it
down&mdash;each stone clung to each, with arms and legs and hands
and claws, till they burst them asunder by main force with their
new-fangled stuff&mdash;I don't know what they call
it&mdash;dynamite, or something. It was all of it done for one
man's vainglory!'</p>
<p>'Come away, dear,' Mrs. West whispered. But Maisie loitered.</p>
<p>'Wolverden Tower was fasted thrice,' the old woman continued, in
a sing-song quaver. 'It was fasted thrice with souls of maids
against every assault of man or devil. It was fasted at the
foundation against earthquake and ruin. It was fasted at the top
against thunder and lightning. It was fasted in the middle against
storm and battle. And there it would have stood for a thousand
years if a wicked man had not raised a vainglorious hand against
it. For that's what the rhyme says&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Fasted thrice with souls of
men,<br></span> <span class="i0">Stands the tower of
Wolverden;<br></span> <span class="i0">Fasted thrice with maidens'
blood,<br></span> <span class="i0">A thousand years of fire and
flood<br></span> <span class="i0">Shall see it stand as erst it
stood.'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>She paused a moment, then, raising one skinny hand towards the
brand-new stone, she went on in the same voice, but with malignant
fervour&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'A thousand years the tower
shall stand<br></span> <span class="i0">Till ill assailed by evil
hand;<br></span> <span class="i0">By evil hand in evil
hour,<br></span> <span class="i0">Fasted thrice with warlock's
power,<br></span> <span class="i0">Shall fall the stanes of
Wulfhere's tower.'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>She tottered off as she ended, and took her seat on the edge of
a depressed vault in the churchyard close by, still eyeing Maisie
Llewelyn with a weird and curious glance, almost like the look
which a famishing man casts upon the food in a shop-window.</p>
<p>'Who is she?' Maisie asked, shrinking away in undefined
terror.</p>
<p>'Oh, old Bessie,' Mrs. West answered, looking more apologetic
(for the parish) than ever. 'She's always hanging about here. She
has nothing else to do, and she's an outdoor pauper. You see,
that's the worst of having the church in one's grounds, which is
otherwise picturesque and romantic and baronial; the road to it's
public; you must admit all the world; and old Bessie <i>will</i>
come here. The servants are afraid of her. They say she's a witch.
She has the evil eye, and she drives girls to suicide. But they
cross her hand with silver all the same, and she tells them their
fortunes&mdash;gives them each a butler. She's full of dreadful
stories about Wolverden Church&mdash;stories to make your blood run
cold, my dear, compact with old superstitions and murders, and so
forth. And they're true, too, that's the worst of them. She's quite
a character. Mr. Blaydes, the antiquary, is really attached to her;
he says she's now the sole living repository of the traditional
folk-lore and history of the parish. But I don't care for it
myself. It "gars one greet," as we say in Scotland. Too much
burying alive in it, don't you know, my dear, to quite suit
<i>my</i> fancy.'</p>
<p>They turned back as she spoke towards the carved wooden
lych-gate, one of the oldest and most exquisite of its class in
England. When they reached the vault by whose doors old Bessie was
seated, Maisie turned once more to gaze at the pointed lancet
windows of the Early English choir, and the still more ancient
dog-tooth ornament of the ruined Norman Lady Chapel.</p>
<p>'How solidly it's built!' she exclaimed, looking up at the
arches which alone survived the fury of the Puritan. 'It really
looks as if it would last for ever.'</p>
<p>Old Bessie had bent her head, and seemed to be whispering
something at the door of the vault. But at the sound she raised her
eyes, and, turning her wizened face towards the lady of the manor,
mumbled through her few remaining fang-like teeth an old local
saying, 'Bradbury for length, Wolverden for strength, and Church
Hatton for beauty!</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Three brothers builded
churches three;<br></span> <span class="i0">And fasted thrice each
church shall be:<br></span> <span class="i0">Fasted thrice with
maidens' blood,<br></span> <span class="i0">To make them safe from
fire and flood;<br></span> <span class="i0">Fasted thrice with
souls of men,<br></span> <span class="i0">Hatton, Bradbury,
Wolverden!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>'Come away,' Maisie said, shuddering. 'I'm afraid of that woman.
Why was she whispering at the doors of the vault down there? I
don't like the look of her.'</p>
<p>'My dear,' Mrs. West answered, in no less terrified a tone, 'I
will confess I don't like the look of her myself. I wish she'd
leave the place. I've tried to make her. The Colonel offered her
fifty pounds down and a nice cottage in Surrey if only she'd
go&mdash;she frightens me so much; but she wouldn't hear of it. She
said she must stop by the bodies of her dead&mdash;that's her
style, don't you see: a sort of modern ghoul, a degenerate
vampire&mdash;and from the bodies of her dead in Wolverden Church
no living soul should ever move her.'</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>For dinner Maisie wore her white satin Empire dress,
high-waisted, low-necked, and cut in the bodice with a certain
baby-like simplicity of style which exactly suited her strange and
uncanny type of beauty. She was very much admired. She felt it, and
it pleased her. The young man who took her in, a subaltern of
engineers, had no eyes for any one else; while old Admiral Wade,
who sat opposite her with a plain and skinny dowager, made her
positively uncomfortable by the persistent way in which he stared
at her simple pearl necklet.</p>
<p>After dinner, the tableaux. They had been designed and managed
by a famous Royal Academician, and were mostly got up by the
members of the house-party. But two or three actresses from London
had been specially invited to help in a few of the more
mythological scenes; for, indeed, Mrs. West had prepared the entire
entertainment with that topsy-turvy conscientiousness and
scrupulous sense of responsibility to society which pervaded her
view of millionaire morality. Having once decided to offer the
county a set of tableaux, she felt that millionaire morality
absolutely demanded of her the sacrifice of three weeks' time and
several hundred pounds money in order to discharge her obligations
to the county with becoming magnificence.</p>
<p>The first tableau, Maisie learned from the gorgeous programme,
was 'Jephthah's Daughter.' The subject was represented at the
pathetic moment when the doomed virgin goes forth from her father's
house with her attendant maidens to bewail her virginity for two
months upon the mountains, before the fulfilment of the awful vow
which bound her father to offer her up for a burnt offering. Maisie
thought it too solemn and tragic a scene for a festive occasion.
But the famous R.A. had a taste for such themes, and his grouping
was certainly most effectively dramatic.</p>
<p>'A perfect symphony in white and grey,' said Mr. Wills, the art
critic.</p>
<p>'How awfully affecting!' said most of the young girls.</p>
<p>'Reminds me a little too much, my dear, of old Bessie's
stories,' Mrs. West whispered low, leaning from her seat across two
rows to Maisie.</p>
<p>A piano stood a little on one side of the platform, just in
front of the curtain. The intervals between the pieces were filled
up with songs, which, however, had been evidently arranged in
keeping with the solemn and half-mystical tone of the tableaux. It
is the habit of amateurs to take a long time in getting their
scenes in order, so the interposition of the music was a happy
thought as far as its prime intention went. But Maisie wondered
they could not have chosen some livelier song for Christmas Eve
than 'Oh, Mary, go and call the cattle home, and call the cattle
home, and call the cattle home, across the sands of Dee.' Her own
name was Mary when she signed it officially, and the sad lilt of
the last line, 'But never home came she,' rang unpleasantly in her
ear through the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>The second tableau was the 'Sacrifice of Iphigenia.' It was
admirably rendered. The cold and dignified father, standing,
apparently unmoved, by the pyre; the cruel faces of the attendant
priests; the shrinking form of the immolated princess; the mere
blank curiosity and inquiring interest of the helmeted heroes
looking on, to whom this slaughter of a virgin victim was but an
ordinary incident of the Achæan religion&mdash;all these had been
arranged by the Academical director with consummate skill and
pictorial cleverness. But the group that attracted Maisie most
among the components of the scene was that of the attendant
maidens, more conspicuous here in their flowing white chitons than
even they had been when posed as companions of the beautiful and
ill-fated Hebrew victim. Two in particular excited her close
attention&mdash;two very graceful and spiritual-looking girls, in
long white robes of no particular age or country, who stood at the
very end near the right edge of the picture. 'How lovely they are,
the two last on the right!' Maisie whispered to her
neighbour&mdash;an Oxford undergraduate with a budding moustache.
'I do so admire them!'</p>
<p>'Do you?' he answered, fondling the moustache with one dubious
finger. 'Well, now, do you know, I don't think I do. They're rather
coarse-looking. And besides, I don't quite like the way they've got
their hair done up in bunches; too fashionable, isn't it?&mdash;too
much of the present day? I don't care to see a girl in a Greek
costume, with her coiffure so evidently turned out by
Truefitt's!'</p>
<p>'Oh, I don't mean those two,' Maisie answered, a little shocked
he should think she had picked out such meretricious faces; 'I mean
the two beyond them again&mdash;the two with their hair so simply
and sweetly done&mdash;the ethereal-looking dark girls.'</p>
<p>The undergraduate opened his mouth, and stared at her in blank
amazement for a moment. 'Well, I don't see&mdash;&mdash;' he began,
and broke off suddenly. Something in Maisie's eye seemed to give
him pause. He fondled his moustache, hesitated, and was silent.</p>
<p>'How nice to have read the Greek and know what it all means!'
Maisie went on, after a minute.' It's a human sacrifice, of course;
but, please, what is the story?'</p>
<p>The undergraduate hummed and hawed. 'Well, it's in Euripides,
you know,' he said, trying to look impressive,
'and&mdash;er&mdash;and I haven't taken up Euripides for my next
examination. But I <i>think</i> it's like this. Iphigenia was a
daughter of Agamemnon's, don't you know, and he had offended
Artemis or somebody&mdash;some other goddess; and he vowed to offer
up to her the most beautiful thing that should be born that year,
by way of reparation&mdash;just like Jephthah. Well, Iphigenia was
considered the most beautiful product of the particular
twelvemonth&mdash;don't look at me like that, please! you&mdash;you
make me nervous&mdash;and so, when the young woman grew
up&mdash;well, I don't quite recollect the ins and outs of the
details, but it's a human sacrifice business, don't you see; and
they're just going to kill her, though I <i>believe</i> a hind was
finally substituted for the girl, like the ram for Isaac; but I
must confess I've a very vague recollection of it.' He rose from
his seat uneasily. 'I'm afraid,' he went on, shuffling about for an
excuse to move, 'these chairs are too close. I seem to be
incommoding you.'</p>
<p>He moved away with a furtive air. At the end of the tableau one
or two of the characters who were not needed in succeeding pieces
came down from the stage and joined the body of spectators, as they
often do, in their character-dresses&mdash;a good opportunity, in
point of fact, for retaining through the evening the advantages
conferred by theatrical costume, rouge, and pearl-powder. Among
them the two girls Maisie had admired so much glided quietly toward
her and took the two vacant seats on either side, one of which had
just been quitted by the awkward undergraduate. They were not only
beautiful in face and figure, on a closer view, but Maisie found
them from the first extremely sympathetic. They burst into talk
with her, frankly and at once, with charming ease and grace of
manner. They were ladies in the grain, in instinct and breeding.
The taller of the two, whom the other addressed as Yolande, seemed
particularly pleasing. The very name charmed Maisie. She was
friends with them at once. They both possessed a certain nameless
attraction that constitutes in itself the best possible
introduction. Maisie hesitated to ask them whence they came, but it
was clear from their talk they knew Wolverden intimately.</p>
<p>After a minute the piano struck up once more. A famous Scotch
vocalist, in a diamond necklet and a dress to match, took her place
on the stage, just in front of the footlights. As chance would have
it, she began singing the song Maisie most of all hated. It was
Scott's ballad of 'Proud Maisie,' set to music by Carlo
Ludovici&mdash;</p>

lady.'"'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>Maisie listened to the song with grave discomfort. She had never
liked it, and to-night it appalled her. She did not know that just
at that moment Mrs. West was whispering in a perfect fever of
apology to a lady by her side, 'Oh dear! oh dear! what a dreadful
thing of me ever to have permitted that song to be sung here
to-night! It was horribly thoughtless! Why, now I remember, Miss
Llewelyn's name, you know, is Maisie!&mdash;and there she is
listening to it with a face like a sheet! I shall never forgive
myself!'</p>
<p>The tall, dark girl by Maisie's side, whom the other called
Yolande, leaned across to her sympathetically. 'You don't like that
song?' she said, with just a tinge of reproach in her voice as she
said it.</p>
<p>'I hate it!' Maisie answered, trying hard to compose
herself.</p>
<p>'Why so?' the tall, dark girl asked, in a tone of calm and
singular sweetness. 'It is sad, perhaps; but it's lovely&mdash;and
natural!'</p>
<p>'My own name is Maisie,' her new friend replied, with an
ill-repressed shudder. 'And somehow that song pursues me through
life. I seem always to hear the horrid ring of the words, "When six
braw gentlemen kirkward shall carry ye." I wish to Heaven my people
had never called me Maisie!'</p>
<p>'And yet <i>why</i>?' the tall, dark girl asked again, with a
sad, mysterious air. Why this clinging to life&mdash;this terror of
death&mdash;this inexplicable attachment to a world of misery? And
with such eyes as yours, too! Your eyes are like mine'&mdash;which
was a compliment, certainly, for the dark girl's own pair were
strangely deep and lustrous. 'People with eyes such as those, that
can look into futurity, ought not surely to shrink from a mere gate
like death! For death is but a gate&mdash;the gate of life in its
fullest beauty. It is written over the door, "Mors janua
vitæ."'</p>
<p>'What door?' Maisie asked&mdash;for she remembered having read
those selfsame words, and tried in vain to translate them, that
very day, though the meaning was now clear to her.</p>
<p>The answer electrified her: 'The gate of the vault in Wolverden
churchyard.'</p>
<p>She said it very low, but with pregnant expression.</p>
<p>'Oh, how dreadful!' Maisie exclaimed, drawing back. The tall,
dark girl half frightened her.</p>
<p>'Not at all,' the girl answered. 'This life is so short, so
vain, so transitory! And beyond it is peace&mdash;eternal
peace&mdash;the calm of rest&mdash;the joy of the spirit.'</p>
<p>'You come to anchor at last,' her companion added.</p>
<p>'But if&mdash;one has somebody one would not wish to leave
behind?' Maisie suggested timidly.</p>
<p>'He will follow before long,' the dark girl replied with quiet
decision, interpreting rightly the sex of the indefinite
substantive. 'Time passes so quickly. And if time passes quickly in
time, how much more, then, in eternity!'</p>
<p>'Hush, Yolande,' the other dark girl put in, with a warning
glance; 'there's a new tableau coming. Let me see, is this "The
Death of Ophelia"? No, that's number four; this is number three,
"The Martyrdom of St. Agnes."'</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>'My dear,' Mrs. West said, positively oozing apology, when she
met Maisie in the supper-room, 'I'm afraid you've been left in a
corner by yourself almost all the evening!'</p>
<p>'Oh dear, no,' Maisie answered with a quiet smile. 'I had that
Oxford undergraduate at my elbow at first; and afterwards those two
nice girls, with the flowing white dresses and the beautiful eyes,
came and sat beside me. What's their name, I wonder?'</p>
<p>'Which girls?' Mrs. West asked, with a little surprise in her
tone, for her impression was rather that Maisie had been sitting
between two empty chairs for the greater part of the evening,
muttering at times to herself in the most uncanny way, but not
talking to anybody.</p>
<p>Maisie glanced round the room in search of her new friends, and
for some time could not see them. At last, she observed them in a
remote alcove, drinking red wine by themselves out of
Venetian-glass beakers. 'Those two,' she said, pointing towards
them. 'They're such charming girls! Can you tell me who they are?
I've quite taken a fancy to them.'</p>
<p>Mrs. West gazed at them for a second&mdash;or rather, at the
recess towards which Maisie pointed&mdash;and then turned to Maisie
with much the same oddly embarrassed look and manner as the
undergraduate's. 'Oh, <i>those</i>!' she said slowly, peering
through and through her, Maisie thought. 'Those&mdash;must be some
of the professionals from London. At any rate&mdash;I'm not sure
which you mean&mdash;over there by the curtain, in the Moorish
nook, you say&mdash;well, I can't tell you their names! So they
<i>must</i> be professionals.'</p>
<p>She went off with a singularly frightened manner. Maisie noticed
it and wondered at it. But it made no great or lasting
impression.</p>
<p>When the party broke up, about midnight or a little later,
Maisie went along the corridor to her own bedroom. At the end, by
the door, the two other girls happened to be standing, apparently
gossiping.</p>
<p>'Oh, you've not gone home yet?' Maisie said, as she passed, to
Yolande.</p>
<p>'No, we're stopping here,' the dark girl with the speaking eyes
answered.</p>
<p>Maisie paused for a second. Then an impulse burst over her.
'Will you come and see my room?' she asked, a little timidly.</p>
<p>'Shall we go, Hedda?' Yolande said, with an inquiring glance at
her companion.</p>
<p>Her friend nodded assent. Maisie opened the door, and ushered
them into her bedroom.</p>
<p>The ostentatiously opulent fire was still burning brightly, the
electric light flooded the room with its brilliancy, the curtains
were drawn, and the shutters fastened. For a while the three girls
sat together by the hearth and gossiped quietly. Maisie liked her
new friends&mdash;their voices were so gentle, soft, and
sympathetic, while for face and figure they might have sat as
models to Burne-Jones or Botticelli. Their dresses, too, took her
delicate Welsh fancy; they were so dainty, yet so simple. The soft
silk fell in natural folds and dimples. The only ornaments they
wore were two curious brooches of very antique workmanship&mdash;as
Maisie supposed&mdash;somewhat Celtic in design, and enamelled in
blood-red on a gold background. Each carried a flower laid loosely
in her bosom. Yolande's was an orchid with long, floating
streamers, in colour and shape recalling some Southern lizard; dark
purple spots dappled its lip and petals. Hedda's was a flower of a
sort Maisie had never before seen&mdash;the stem spotted like a
viper's skin, green flecked with russet-brown, and uncanny to look
upon; on either side, great twisted spirals of red-and-blue
blossoms, each curled after the fashion of a scorpion's tail, very
strange and lurid. Something weird and witch-like about flowers and
dresses rather attracted Maisie; they affected her with the
half-repellent fascination of a snake for a bird; she felt such
blossoms were fit for incantations and sorceries. But a
lily-of-the-valley in Yolande's dark hair gave a sense of purity
which assorted better with the girl's exquisitely calm and nun-like
beauty.</p>
<p>After a while Hedda rose. 'This air is close,' she said. 'It
ought to be warm outside to-night, if one may judge by the sunset.
May I open the window?'</p>
<p>'Oh, certainly, if you like,' Maisie answered, a vague
foreboding now struggling within her against innate politeness.</p>
<p>Hedda drew back the curtains and unfastened the shutters. It was
a moonlit evening. The breeze hardly stirred the bare boughs of the
silver birches. A sprinkling of soft snow on the terrace and the
hills just whitened the ground. The moon lighted it up, falling
full upon the Hall; the church and tower below stood silhouetted in
dark against a cloudless expanse of starry sky in the background.
Hedda opened the window. Cool, fresh air blew in, very soft and
genial, in spite of the snow and the lateness of the season. 'What
a glorious night!' she said, looking up at Orion overhead. 'Shall
we stroll out for a while in it?'</p>
<p>If the suggestion had not thus been thrust upon her from
outside, it would never have occurred to Maisie to walk abroad in a
strange place, in evening dress, on a winter's night, with snow
whitening the ground; but Hedda's voice sounded so sweetly
persuasive, and the idea itself seemed so natural now she had once
proposed it, that Maisie followed her two new friends on to the
moonlit terrace without a moment's hesitation.</p>
<p>They paced once or twice up and down the gravelled walks.
Strange to say, though a sprinkling of dry snow powdered the ground
under foot, the air itself was soft and balmy. Stranger still,
Maisie noticed, almost without noticing it, that though they walked
three abreast, only one pair of footprints&mdash;her own&mdash;lay
impressed on the snow in a long trail when they turned at either
end and re-paced the platform. Yolande and Hedda must step lightly
indeed; or perhaps her own feet might be warmer or thinner shod, so
as to melt the light layer of snow more readily.</p>
<p>The girls slipped their arms through hers. A little thrill
coursed through her. Then, after three or four turns up and down
the terrace, Yolande led the way quietly down the broad flight of
steps in the direction of the church on the lower level. In that
bright, broad moonlight Maisie went with them undeterred; the Hall
was still alive with the glare of electric lights in bedroom
windows; and the presence of the other girls, both wholly free from
any signs of fear, took off all sense of terror or loneliness. They
strolled on into the churchyard. Maisie's eyes were now fixed on
the new white tower, which merged in the silhouette against the
starry sky into much the same grey and indefinite hue as the older
parts of the building. Before she quite knew where she was, she
found herself at the head of the worn stone steps which led into
the vault by whose doors she had seen old Bessie sitting. In the
pallid moonlight, with the aid of the greenish reflection from the
snow, she could just read the words inscribed over the portal, the
words that Yolande had repeated in the drawing-room, 'Mors janua
vitæ.'</p>
<p>Yolande moved down one step. Maisie drew back for the first time
with a faint access of alarm. 'You're&mdash;you're not <i>going
down</i> there!' she exclaimed, catching her breath for a
second.</p>
<p>'Yes, I am,' her new friend answered in a calmly quiet voice.
'Why not? We live here.'</p>
<p>'You live here?' Maisie echoed, freeing her arms by a sudden
movement and standing away from her mysterious friends with a
tremulous shudder.</p>
<p>'Yes, we live here,' Hedda broke in, without the slightest
emotion. She said it in a voice of perfect calm, as one might say
it of any house in a street in London.</p>
<p>Maisie was far less terrified than she might have imagined
beforehand would be the case under such unexpected conditions. The
two girls were so simple, so natural, so strangely like herself,
that she could not say she was really afraid of them. She shrank,
it is true, from the nature of the door at which they stood, but
she received the unearthly announcement that they lived there with
scarcely more than a slight tremor of surprise and
astonishment.</p>
<p>'You will come in with us?' Hedda said in a gently enticing
tone. 'We went into your bedroom.'</p>
<p>Maisie hardly liked to say no. They seemed so anxious to show
her their home. With trembling feet she moved down the first step,
and then the second. Yolande kept ever one pace in front of her. As
Maisie reached the third step, the two girls, as if moved by one
design, took her wrists in their hands, not unkindly, but
coaxingly. They reached the actual doors of the vault
itself&mdash;two heavy bronze valves, meeting in the centre. Each
bore a ring for a handle, pierced through a Gorgon's head embossed
upon the surface. Yolande pushed them with her hand. They yielded
instantly to her light touch, and opened <i>inward</i>. Yolande,
still in front, passed from the glow of the moon to the gloom of
the vault, which a ray of moonlight just descended obliquely. As
she passed, for a second, a weird sight met Maisie's eyes. Her face
and hands and dress became momentarily self-luminous; but through
them, as they glowed, she could descry within every bone and joint
of her living skeleton, dimly shadowed in dark through the luminous
haze that marked her body.</p>
<p>Maisie drew back once more, terrified. Yet her terror was not
quite what one could describe as fear: it was rather a vague sense
of the profoundly mystical. 'I can't! I can't!' she cried, with an
appealing glance. 'Hedda! Yolande! I cannot go with you.'</p>
<p>Hedda held her hand tight, and almost seemed to force her. But
Yolande, in front, like a mother with her child, turned round with
a grave smile. 'No, no,' she said reprovingly. 'Let her come if she
will, Hedda, of her own accord, not otherwise. The tower demands a
willing victim.'</p>
<p>Her hand on Maisie's wrist was strong but persuasive. It drew
her without exercising the faintest compulsion. 'Will you come with
us, dear?' she said, in that winning silvery tone which had
captivated Maisie's fancy from the very first moment they spoke
together. Maisie gazed into her eyes. They were deep and tender. A
strange resolution seemed to nerve her for the effort. 'Yes,
yes&mdash;I&mdash;will&mdash;come&mdash;with you,' she answered
slowly.</p>
<p>Hedda on one side, Yolande on the other, now went before her,
holding her wrists in their grasp, but rather enticing than drawing
her. As each reached the gloom, the same luminous appearance which
Maisie had noticed before spread over their bodies, and the same
weird skeleton shape showed faintly through their limbs in darker
shadow. Maisie crossed the threshold with a convulsive gasp. As she
crossed it she looked down at her own dress and body. They were
semi-transparent, like the others', though not quite so
self-luminous; the framework of her limbs appeared within in less
certain outline, yet quite dark and distinguishable.</p>
<p>The doors swung to of themselves behind her. Those three stood
alone in the vault of Wolverden.</p>
<p>Alone, for a minute or two; and then, as her eyes grew
accustomed to the grey dusk of the interior, Maisie began to
perceive that the vault opened out into a large and beautiful hall
or crypt, dimly lighted at first, but becoming each moment more
vaguely clear and more dreamily definite. Gradually she could make
out great rock-hewn pillars, Romanesque in their outline or dimly
Oriental, like the sculptured columns in the caves of Ellora,
supporting a roof of vague and uncertain dimensions, more or less
strangely dome-shaped. The effect on the whole was like that of the
second impression produced by some dim cathedral, such as Chartres
or Milan, after the eyes have grown accustomed to the mellow light
from the stained-glass windows, and have recovered from the
blinding glare of the outer sunlight. But the architecture, if one
may call it so, was more mosque-like and magical. She turned to her
companions. Yolande and Hedda stood still by her side; their bodies
were now self-luminous to a greater degree than even at the
threshold; but the terrible transparency had disappeared
altogether; they were once more but beautiful though strangely
transfigured and more than mortal women.</p>
<p>Then Maisie understood in her own soul, dimly, the meaning of
those mystic words written over the portal&mdash;'Mors janua
vitæ'&mdash;Death is the gate of life; and also the interpretation
of that awful vision of death dwelling within them as they crossed
the threshold; for through that gate they had passed to this
underground palace.</p>
<p>Her two guides still held her hands, one on either side. But
they seemed rather to lead her on now, seductively and
resistlessly, than to draw or compel her. As she moved in through
the hall, with its endless vistas of shadowy pillars, seen now
behind, now in dim perspective, she was gradually aware that many
other people crowded its aisles and corridors. Slowly they took
shape as forms more or less clad, mysterious, varied, and of many
ages. Some of them wore flowing robes, half mediæval in shape, like
the two friends who had brought her there. They looked like the
saints on a stained-glass window. Others were girt merely with a
light and floating Coan sash; while some stood dimly nude in the
darker recesses of the temple or palace. All leaned eagerly forward
with one mind as she approached, and regarded her with deep and
sympathetic interest. A few of them murmured words&mdash;mere
cabalistic sounds which at first she could not understand; but as
she moved further into the hall, and saw at each step more clearly
into the gloom, they began to have a meaning for her. Before long,
she was aware that she understood the mute tumult of voices at once
by some internal instinct. The Shades addressed her; she answered
them. She knew by intuition what tongue they spoke; it was the
Language of the Dead; and, by passing that portal with her two
companions, she had herself become enabled both to speak and
understand it.</p>
<p>A soft and flowing tongue, this speech of the Nether
World&mdash;all vowels it seemed, without distinguishable
consonants; yet dimly recalling every other tongue, and compounded,
as it were, of what was common to all of them. It flowed from those
shadowy lips as clouds issue inchoate from a mountain valley; it
was formless, uncertain, vague, but yet beautiful. She hardly knew,
indeed, as it fell upon her senses, if it were sound or
perfume.</p>
<p>Through this tenuous world Maisie moved as in a dream, her two
companions still cheering and guiding her. When they reached an
inner shrine or chantry of the temple she was dimly conscious of
more terrible forms pervading the background than any of those that
had yet appeared to her. This was a more austere and antique
apartment than the rest; a shadowy cloister, prehistoric in its
severity; it recalled to her mind something indefinitely
intermediate between the huge unwrought trilithons of Stonehenge
and the massive granite pillars of Philæ and Luxor. At the further
end of the sanctuary a sort of Sphinx looked down on her, smiling
mysteriously. At its base, on a rude megalithic throne, in solitary
state, a High Priest was seated. He bore in his hand a wand or
sceptre. All round, a strange court of half-unseen acolytes and
shadowy hierophants stood attentive. They were girt, as she
fancied, in what looked like leopards' skins, or in the fells of
some earlier prehistoric lion. These wore sabre-shaped teeth
suspended by a string round their dusky necks; others had ornaments
of uncut amber, or hatchets of jade threaded as collars on a cord
of sinew. A few, more barbaric than savage in type, flaunted
torques of gold as armlets and necklets.</p>
<p>The High Priest rose slowly and held out his two hands, just
level with his head, the palms turned outward. 'You have brought a
willing victim as Guardian of the Tower?' he asked, in that mystic
tongue, of Yolande and Hedda.</p>
<p>'We have brought a willing victim,' the two girls answered.</p>
<p>The High Priest gazed at her. His glance was piercing. Maisie
trembled less with fear than with a sense of strangeness, such as a
neophyte might feel on being first presented at some courtly
pageant. 'You come of your own accord?' the Priest inquired of her
in solemn accents.</p>
<p>'I come of my own accord,' Maisie answered, with an inner
consciousness that she was bearing her part in some immemorial
ritual. Ancestral memories seemed to stir within her.</p>
<p>'It is well,' the Priest murmured. Then he turned to her guides.
'She is of royal lineage?' he inquired, taking his wand in his hand
again.</p>
<p>'She is a Llewelyn,' Yolande answered, 'of royal lineage, and of
the race that, after your own, earliest bore sway in this land of
Britain. She has in her veins the blood of Arthur, of Ambrosius,
and of Vortigern.'</p>
<p>'It is well,' the Priest said again. 'I know these princes.'
Then he turned to Maisie. 'This is the ritual of those who build,'
he said, in a very deep voice. 'It has been the ritual of those who
build from the days of the builders of Lokmariaker and Avebury.
Every building man makes shall have its human soul, the soul of a
virgin to guard and protect it. Three souls it requires as a living
talisman against chance and change. One soul is the soul of the
human victim slain beneath the foundation-stone; she is the
guardian spirit against earthquake and ruin. One soul is the soul
of the human victim slain when the building is half built up; she
is the guardian spirit against battle and tempest. One soul is the
soul of the human victim who flings herself of her own free will
off tower or gable when the building is complete; she is the
guardian spirit against thunder and lightning. Unless a building be
duly fasted with these three, how can it hope to stand against the
hostile powers of fire and flood and storm and earthquake?'</p>
<p>An assessor at his side, unnoticed till then, took up the
parable. He had a stern Roman face, and bore a shadowy suit of
Roman armour. 'In times of old,' he said, with iron austerity, 'all
men knew well these rules of building. They built in solid stone to
endure for ever: the works they erected have lasted to this day, in
this land and others. So built we the amphitheatres of Rome and
Verona; so built we the walls of Lincoln, York, and London. In the
blood of a king's son laid we the foundation-stone: in the blood of
a king's son laid we the coping-stone: in the blood of a maiden of
royal line fasted we the bastions against fire and lightning. But
in these latter days, since faith grows dim, men build with burnt
brick and rubble of plaster; no foundation spirit or guardian soul
do they give to their bridges, their walls, or their towers: so
bridges break, and walls fall in, and towers crumble, and the art
and mystery of building aright have perished from among you.'</p>
<p>He ceased. The High Priest held out his wand and spoke again.
'We are the Assembly of Dead Builders and Dead Victims,' he said,
'for this mark of Wolverden; all of whom have built or been built
upon in this holy site of immemorial sanctity. We are the stones of
a living fabric. Before this place was a Christian church, it was a
temple of Woden. And before it was a temple of Woden, it was a
shrine of Hercules. And before it was a shrine of Hercules, it was
a grove of Nodens. And before it was a grove of Nodens, it was a
Stone Circle of the Host of Heaven. And before it was a Stone
Circle of the Host of Heaven, it was the grave and tumulus and
underground palace of Me, who am the earliest builder of all in
this place; and my name in my ancient tongue is Wolf, and I laid
and hallowed it. And after me, Wolf, and my namesake Wulfhere, was
this barrow called Ad Lupum and Wolverden. And all these that are
here with me have built and been built upon in this holy site for
all generations. And <i>you</i> are the last who come to join
us.'</p>
<p>Maisie felt a cold thrill course down her spine as he spoke
these words; but courage did not fail her. She was dimly aware that
those who offer themselves as victims for service must offer
themselves willingly; for the gods demand a voluntary victim; no
beast can be slain unless it nod assent; and none can be made a
guardian spirit who takes not the post upon him of his own free
will. She turned meekly to Hedda. 'Who are you?' she asked,
trembling.</p>
<p>'I am Hedda,' the girl answered, in the same soft sweet voice
and winning tone as before; 'Hedda, the daughter of Gorm, the chief
of the Northmen who settled in East Anglia. And I was a worshipper
of Thor and Odin. And when my father, Gorm, fought against Alfred,
King of Wessex, was I taken prisoner. And Wulfhere, the Kenting,
was then building the first church and tower of Wolverden. And they
baptized me, and shrived me, and I consented of my own free will to
be built under the foundation-stone. And there my body lies built
up to this day; and <i>I</i> am the guardian spirit against
earthquake and ruin.'</p>
<p>'And who are you?' Maisie asked, turning again to Yolande.</p>
<p>'I am Yolande Fitz-Aylwin,' the tall dark girl answered; 'a
royal maiden too, sprung from the blood of Henry Plantagenet. And
when Roland Fitz-Stephen was building anew the choir and chancel of
Wulfhere's minster, I chose to be immured in the fabric of the
wall, for love of the Church and all holy saints; and there my body
lies built up to this day; and <i>I</i> am the guardian against
battle and tempest.'</p>
<p>Maisie held her friend's hand tight. Her voice hardly trembled.
'And I?' she asked once more. 'What fate for me? Tell me!'</p>
<p>'Your task is easier far,' Yolande answered gently. 'For
<i>you</i> shall be the guardian of the new tower against thunder
and lightning. Now, those who guard against earthquake and battle
are buried alive under the foundation-stone or in the wall of the
building; there they die a slow death of starvation and choking.
But those who guard against thunder and lightning cast themselves
alive of their own free will from the battlements of the tower, and
die in the air before they reach the ground; so their fate is the
easiest and the lightest of all who would serve mankind; and
thenceforth they live with us here in our palace.'</p>
<p>Maisie clung to her hand still tighter. 'Must I do it?' she
asked, pleading.</p>
<p>'It is not <i>must</i>,' Yolande replied in the same caressing
tone, yet with a calmness as of one in whom earthly desires and
earthly passions are quenched for ever. 'It is as you choose
yourself. None but a willing victim may be a guardian spirit. This
glorious privilege comes but to the purest and best amongst us. Yet
what better end can you ask for your soul than to dwell here in our
midst as our comrade for ever, where all is peace, and to preserve
the tower whose guardian you are from evil assaults of lightning
and thunderbolt?'</p>
<p>Maisie flung her arms round her friend's neck. 'But&mdash;I am
afraid,' she murmured. Why she should even wish to consent she knew
not, yet the strange serene peace in these strange girls' eyes made
her mysteriously in love with them and with the fate they offered
her. They seemed to move like the stars in their orbits. 'How shall
I leap from the top?' she cried. 'How shall I have courage to mount
the stairs alone, and fling myself off from the lonely
battlement?'</p>
<p>Yolande unwound her arms with a gentle forbearance. She coaxed
her as one coaxes an unwilling child. 'You will <i>not</i> be
alone,' she said, with a tender pressure. 'We will all go with you.
We will help you and encourage you. We will sing our sweet songs of
life-in-death to you. Why should you draw back? All we have faced
it in ten thousand ages, and we tell you with one voice, you need
not fear it. 'Tis life you should fear&mdash;life, with its
dangers, its toils, its heartbreakings. Here we dwell for ever in
unbroken peace. Come, come, and join us!'</p>
<p>She held out her arms with an enticing gesture. Maisie sprang
into them, sobbing. 'Yes, I will come,' she cried in an access of
hysterical fervour. 'These are the arms of Death&mdash;I embrace
them. These are the lips of Death&mdash;I kiss them. Yolande,
Yolande, I will do as you ask me!'</p>
<p>The tall dark girl in the luminous white robe stooped down and
kissed her twice on the forehead in return. Then she looked at the
High Priest. 'We are ready,' she murmured in a low, grave voice.
'The Victim consents. The Virgin will die. Lead on to the tower. We
are ready! We are ready!'</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>From the recesses of the temple&mdash;if temple it
were&mdash;from the inmost shrines of the shrouded cavern,
unearthly music began to sound of itself, with wild modulation, on
strange reeds and tabors. It swept through the aisles like a
rushing wind on an Aeolian harp; at times it wailed with a voice
like a woman's; at times it rose loud in an organ-note of triumph;
at times it sank low into a pensive and melancholy flute-like
symphony. It waxed and waned; it swelled and died away again; but
no man saw how or whence it proceeded. Wizard echoes issued from
the crannies and vents in the invisible walls; they sighed from the
ghostly inter-spaces of the pillars; they keened and moaned from
the vast overhanging dome of the palace. Gradually the song shaped
itself by weird stages into a processional measure. At its sound
the High Priest rose slowly from his immemorial seat on the mighty
cromlech which formed his throne. The Shades in leopards' skins
ranged themselves in bodiless rows on either hand; the ghostly
wearers of the sabre-toothed lions' fangs followed like ministrants
in the footsteps of their hierarch.</p>
<p>Hedda and Yolande took their places in the procession. Maisie
stood between the two, with hair floating on the air; she looked
like a novice who goes up to take the veil, accompanied and cheered
by two elder sisters.</p>
<p>The ghostly pageant began to move. Unseen music followed it with
fitful gusts of melody. They passed down the main corridor, between
shadowy Doric or Ionic pillars which grew dimmer and ever dimmer
again in the distance as they approached, with slow steps, the
earthward portal.</p>
<p>At the gate, the High Priest pushed against the valves with his
hand. They opened <i>outward</i>.</p>
<p>He passed into the moonlight. The attendants thronged after him.
As each wild figure crossed the threshold the same strange sight as
before met Maisie's eyes. For a second of time each ghostly body
became self-luminous, as with some curious phosphorescence; and
through each, at the moment of passing the portal, the dim outline
of a skeleton loomed briefly visible. Next instant it had clothed
itself as with earthly members.</p>
<p>Maisie reached the outer air. As she did so, she gasped. For a
second, its chilliness and freshness almost choked her. She was
conscious now that the atmosphere of the vault, though pleasant in
its way, and warm and dry, had been loaded with fumes as of burning
incense, and with somnolent vapours of poppy and mandragora. Its
drowsy ether had cast her into a lethargy. But after the first
minute in the outer world, the keen night air revived her. Snow lay
still on the ground a little deeper than when she first came out,
and the moon rode lower; otherwise, all was as before, save that
only one or two lights still burned here and there in the great
house on the terrace. Among them she could recognise her own room,
on the ground floor in the new wing, by its open window.</p>
<p>The procession made its way across the churchyard towards the
tower. As it wound among the graves an owl hooted. All at once
Maisie remembered the lines that had so chilled her a few short
hours before in the drawing-room&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>But, marvellous to relate, they no longer alarmed her. She felt
rather that a friend was welcoming her home; she clung to Yolande's
hand with a gentle pressure.</p>
<p>As they passed in front of the porch, with its ancient yew-tree,
a stealthy figure glided out like a ghost from the darkling shadow.
It was a woman, bent and bowed, with quivering limbs that shook
half palsied. Maisie recognised old Bessie. 'I knew she would
come!' the old hag muttered between her toothless jaws. 'I knew
Wolverden Tower would yet be duly fasted!'</p>
<p>She put herself, as of right, at the head of the procession.
They moved on to the tower, rather gliding than walking. Old Bessie
drew a rusty key from her pocket, and fitted it with a twist into
the brand-new lock. 'What turned the old will turn the new,' she
murmured, looking round and grinning. Maisie shrank from her as she
shrank from not one of the Dead; but she followed on still into the
ringers' room at the base of the tower.</p>
<p>Thence a staircase in the corner led up to the summit. The High
Priest mounted the stair, chanting a mystic refrain, whose runic
sounds were no longer intelligible to Maisie. As she reached the
outer air, the Tongue of the Dead seemed to have become a mere
blank of mingled odours and murmurs to her. It was like a summer
breeze, sighing through warm and resinous pinewoods. But Yolande
and Hedda spoke to her yet, to cheer her, in the language of the
living. She recognised that as <i>revenants</i> they were still in
touch with the upper air and the world of the embodied.</p>
<p>They tempted her up the stair with encouraging fingers. Maisie
followed them like a child, in implicit confidence. The steps wound
round and round, spirally, and the staircase was dim; but a
supernatural light seemed to fill the tower, diffused from the
bodies or souls of its occupants. At the head of all, the High
Priest still chanted as he went his unearthly litany; magic sounds
of chimes seemed to swim in unison with his tune as they mounted.
Were those floating notes material or spiritual? They passed the
belfry; no tongue of metal wagged; but the rims of the great bells
resounded and reverberated to the ghostly symphony with sympathetic
music. Still they passed on and on, upward and upward. They reached
the ladder that alone gave access to the final story. Dust and
cobwebs already clung to it. Once more Maisie drew back. It was
dark overhead, and the luminous haze began to fail them. Her
friends held her hands with the same kindly persuasive touch as
ever. 'I cannot!' she cried, shrinking away from the tall, steep
ladder. 'Oh, Yolande, I cannot!'</p>
<p>'Yes, dear,' Yolande whispered in a soothing voice. 'You can. It
is but ten steps, and I will hold your hand tight. Be brave and
mount them!'</p>
<p>The sweet voice encouraged her. It was like heavenly music. She
knew not why she should submit, or, rather, consent; but none the
less she consented. Some spell seemed cast over her. With tremulous
feet, scarcely realising what she did, she mounted the ladder and
went up four steps of it.</p>
<p>Then she turned and looked down again. Old Bessie's wrinkled
face met her frightened eyes. It was smiling horribly. She shrank
back once more, terrified. 'I can't do it,' she cried, 'if that
woman comes up! I'm not afraid of <i>you</i>, dear'&mdash;she
pressed Yolande's hand&mdash;'but she, she is too terrible!'</p>
<p>Hedda looked back and raised a warning finger. 'Let the woman
stop below,' she said; 'she savours too much of the evil world. We
must do nothing to frighten the willing victim.'</p>
<p>The High Priest by this time, with his ghostly fingers, had
opened the trap-door that gave access to the summit. A ray of
moonlight slanted through the aperture. The breeze blew down with
it. Once more Maisie felt the stimulating and reviving effect of
the open air. Vivified by its freshness, she struggled up to the
top, passed out through the trap, and found herself standing on the
open platform at the summit of the tower.</p>
<p>The moon had not yet quite set. The light on the snow shone pale
green and mysterious. For miles and miles around she could just
make out, by its aid, the dim contour of the downs, with their thin
white mantle, in the solemn silence. Range behind range rose
faintly shimmering. The chant had now ceased; the High Priest and
his acolytes were mingling strange herbs in a mazar-bowl or
chalice. Stray perfumes of myrrh and of cardamoms were wafted
towards her. The men in leopards' skins burnt smouldering sticks of
spikenard. Then Yolande led the postulant forward again, and placed
her close up to the new white parapet. Stone heads of virgins
smiled on her from the angles. 'She must front the east,' Hedda
said in a tone of authority: and Yolande turned her face towards
the rising sun accordingly. Then she opened her lips and spoke in a
very solemn voice. 'From this new-built tower you fling yourself,'
she said, or rather intoned, 'that you may serve mankind, and all
the powers that be, as its guardian spirit against thunder and
lightning. Judged a virgin, pure and unsullied in deed and word and
thought, of royal race and ancient lineage&mdash;a Cymry of the
Cymry&mdash;you are found worthy to be intrusted with this charge
and this honour. Take care that never shall dart or thunderbolt
assault this tower, as She that is below you takes care to preserve
it from earthquake and ruin, and She that is midway takes care to
preserve it from battle and tempest. This is your charge. See well
that you keep it.'</p>
<p>She took her by both hands. 'Mary Llewelyn,' she said, 'you
willing victim, step on to the battlement.'</p>
<p>Maisie knew not why, but with very little shrinking she stepped
as she was told, by the aid of a wooden footstool, on to the
eastward-looking parapet. There, in her loose white robe, with her
arms spread abroad, and her hair flying free, she poised herself
for a second, as if about to shake out some unseen wings and throw
herself on the air like a swift or a swallow.</p>
<p>'Mary Llewelyn,' Yolande said once more, in a still deeper tone,
with ineffable earnestness, 'cast yourself down, a willing
sacrifice, for the service of man, and the security of this tower
against thunderbolt and lightning.'</p>
<p>Maisie stretched her arms wider, and leaned forward in act to
leap, from the edge of the parapet, on to the snow-clad
churchyard.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>One second more and the sacrifice would have been complete. But
before she could launch herself from the tower, she felt suddenly a
hand laid upon her shoulder from behind to restrain her. Even in
her existing state of nervous exaltation she was aware at once that
it was the hand of a living and solid mortal, not that of a soul or
guardian spirit. It lay heavier upon her than Hedda's or Yolande's.
It seemed to clog and burden her. With a violent effort she strove
to shake herself free, and carry out her now fixed intention of
self-immolation, for the safety of the tower. But the hand was too
strong for her. She could not shake it off. It gripped and held
her.</p>
<p>She yielded, and, reeling, fell back with a gasp on to the
platform of the tower. At the selfsame moment a strange terror and
commotion seemed to seize all at once on the assembled spirits. A
weird cry rang voiceless through the shadowy company. Maisie heard
it as in a dream, very dim and distant. It was thin as a bat's
note; almost inaudible to the ear, yet perceived by the brain or at
least by the spirit. It was a cry of alarm, of fright, of warning.
With one accord, all the host of phantoms rushed hurriedly forward
to the battlements and pinnacles. The ghostly High Priest went
first, with his wand held downward; the men in leopards' skins and
other assistants followed in confusion. Theirs was a reckless rout.
They flung themselves from the top, like fugitives from a cliff,
and floated fast through the air on invisible pinions. Hedda and
Yolande, ambassadresses and intermediaries with the upper air, were
the last to fly from the living presence. They clasped her hand
silently, and looked deep into her eyes. There was something in
that calm yet regretful look that seemed to say, 'Farewell! We have
tried in vain to save you, sister, from the terrors of living.'</p>
<p>The horde of spirits floated away on the air, as in a witches'
Sabbath, to the vault whence it issued. The doors swung on their
rusty hinges, and closed behind them. Maisie stood alone with the
hand that grasped her on the tower.</p>
<p>The shock of the grasp, and the sudden departure of the ghostly
band in such wild dismay, threw Maisie for a while into a state of
semi-unconsciousness. Her head reeled round; her brain swam
faintly. She clutched for support at the parapet of the tower. But
the hand that held her sustained her still. She felt herself gently
drawn down with quiet mastery, and laid on the stone floor close by
the trap-door that led to the ladder.</p>
<p>The next thing of which she could feel sure was the voice of the
Oxford undergraduate. He was distinctly frightened and not a little
tremulous. 'I think,' he said very softly, laying her head on his
lap, 'you had better rest a while, Miss Llewelyn, before you try to
get down again. I hope I didn't catch you and disturb you too
hastily. But one step more, and you would have been over the edge.
I really couldn't help it.'</p>
<p>'Let me go,' Maisie moaned, trying to raise herself again, but
feeling too faint and ill to make the necessary effort to recover
the power of motion. 'I <i>want</i> to go with them! I <i>want</i>
to join them!'</p>
<p>'Some of the others will be up before long,' the undergraduate
said, supporting her head in his hands; 'and they'll help me to get
you down again. Mr. Yates is in the belfry. Meanwhile, if I were
you, I'd lie quite still, and take a drop or two of this
brandy.'</p>
<p>He held it to her lips. Maisie drank a mouthful, hardly knowing
what she did. Then she lay quiet where he placed her for some
minutes. How they lifted her down and conveyed her to her bed she
scarcely knew. She was dazed and terrified. She could only remember
afterward that three or four gentlemen in roughly huddled clothes
had carried or handed her down the ladder between them. The spiral
stair and all the rest were a blank to her.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>When she next awoke she was lying in her bed in the same room at
the Hall, with Mrs. West by her side, leaning over her
tenderly.</p>
<p>Maisie looked up through her closed eyes and just saw the
motherly face and grey hair bending above her. Then voices came to
her from the mist, vaguely: 'Yesterday was so hot for the time of
year, you see!' 'Very unusual weather, of course, for Christmas.'
'But a thunderstorm! So strange! I put it down to that. The
electrical disturbance must have affected the poor child's head.'
Then it dawned upon her that the conversation she heard was passing
between Mrs. West and a doctor.</p>
<p>She raised herself suddenly and wildly on her arms. The bed
faced the windows. She looked out and beheld&mdash;the tower of
Wolverden church, rent from top to bottom with a mighty rent, while
half its height lay tossed in fragments on the ground in the
churchyard.</p>
<p>'What is it?' she cried wildly, with a flush as of shame.</p>
<p>'Hush, hush!' the doctor said. 'Don't trouble! Don't look at
it!'</p>
<p>'Was it&mdash;after I came down?' Maisie moaned in vague
terror.</p>
<p>The doctor nodded. 'An hour after you were brought down,' he
said, 'a thunderstorm broke over it. The lightning struck and
shattered the tower. They had not yet put up the
lightning-conductor. It was to have been done on Boxing Day.'</p>
<p>A weird remorse possessed Maisie's soul. 'My fault!' she cried,
starting up. 'My fault, my fault! I have neglected my duty!'</p>
<p>'Don't talk,' the doctor answered, looking hard at her. 'It is
always dangerous to be too suddenly aroused from these curious
overwrought sleeps and trances.'</p>
<p>'And old Bessie?' Maisie exclaimed, trembling with an eerie
presentiment.</p>
<p>The doctor glanced at Mrs. West. 'How did she know?' he
whispered. Then he turned to Maisie. 'You may as well be told the
truth as suspect it,' he said slowly. 'Old Bessie must have been
watching there. She was crushed and half buried beneath the falling
tower.'</p>
<p>'One more question, Mrs. West,' Maisie murmured, growing faint
with an access of supernatural fear. 'Those two nice girls who sat
on the chairs at each side of me through the tableaux&mdash;are
they hurt? Were they in it?'</p>
<p>Mrs. West soothed her hand. 'My dear child,' she said gravely,
with quiet emphasis, 'there were <i>no</i> other girls. This is
mere hallucination. You sat alone by yourself through the whole of
the evening.'</p>

<h3>JANET'S NEMESIS</h3>
<blockquote>[<i>You will say at first, 'A very old story!' Nay, not
so. A psychological study of what would really happen, if a
familiar incident of early fiction were to occur in our
century.</i>]</blockquote>
<p>'Under no circumstances,' said the surgeon, in a very decided
voice, 'will it be possible for Lady Remenham to take charge of her
own infant.'</p>
<p>'In that case,' the Earl answered, somewhat downcast, 'I suppose
we shall have to look out for a wet-nurse.'</p>
<p>'Of course,' the surgeon replied. 'You can't expect the baby to
live upon nothing, can you?'</p>
<p>Lord Remenham was annoyed. In the first place, he did not like
to hear his son and heir&mdash;then two hours old&mdash;cavalierly
described in quite ordinary language as 'the baby.' To be sure, the
infant viscount exactly resembled most other babies of those tender
years&mdash;or rather minutes. He was red and mottled and extremely
pulpy-looking; and his appearance in no way suggested his exalted
station. On the contrary, his face was marked by that comparative
absence of any particular nose and that unnecessary prominence of
two watery big eyes, which suggest our consanguinity with the negro
and the monkey. But more than that, Lord Remenham was annoyed at
this failure, on Gwendoline's part, to perform the full duties of
complete maternity which her husband expected of her. Remenham was
only thirty, but he was austere and <i>doctrinaire</i> to a degree
that would not have done dishonour to half a century. He had taken
a first class in law and modern history. He was strong on the
necessity for keeping up the physical standard of the race in
general, and our old nobility in particular, through the medium of
its mothers. With this laudable end in view, being a Balliol man
himself, he had married a lawn-tennis-playing,
cross-country-riding, good-looking young woman, Gwendoline Blake by
name, the daughter of a neighbouring squire; and he looked to her
to raise him up a family of sons and daughters of fine and sturdy
old English vigour. That Gwendoline should thus break down at the
first demand made upon her annoyed and surprised him. The race must
be going to the dogs indeed, if even girls like Gwendoline couldn't
be relied upon for the performance of the simplest and most obvious
maternal functions.</p>
<p>'Have you anybody you could suggest as a nurse for Lord Hurley?'
Remenham inquired, in his chilliest voice. He wished to let the
local doctor see he resented the imputation that the new viscount
was a mere baby.</p>
<p>'Most fortunate coincidence!' the doctor answered. 'I had a case
last night. The very thing. She didn't contemplate it; but I
believe the poor girl would be glad of the extra money. Very
destitute indeed, with nothing to depend upon.'</p>
<p>'Married, I hope?' Remenham observed, raising his eyebrows
slightly.</p>
<p>The doctor pursed his lips. 'We can't have everything in this
world,' he answered, after a brief pause. 'Wet-nurses, as your
unaided perspicacity must have observed, spring chiefly from the
class who become mothers before they become wives.'</p>
<p>Remenham gazed at him doubtfully. He had always a suspicion that
the doctor was chaffing him. 'Can she come here at once?' he asked,
with increased stiffness of manner.</p>
<p>'Come here at once?' the doctor echoed. 'Why, it was only last
night she was confined, my lord. You don't expect Englishwomen to
rival North American squaws, do you? No, no, she can't come. The
baby must go to her.'</p>
<p>'For how long?' Remenham faltered.</p>
<p>'A month, I suppose. We are most of us human. At the end of that
time the young woman, no doubt, can take up her abode here.'</p>
<p>'What sort of cottage?' Remenham asked. He disliked this
arrangement.</p>
<p>'Very clean and nice. The child could be brought round at
frequent intervals to see Lady Remenham. There is no time to be
lost. We had better see her and arrange with her immediately.'</p>
<p>Remenham gave way. He gave way under protest; but still he gave
way. Thingumbob's food and Swiss milk seemed to him greater evils
than this proposed arrangement. Gwendoline <i>ought</i> to have
been able to take care of the child herself; but seeing she
wasn't&mdash;well, he must needs fall back upon an efficient
substitute.</p>
<p>He accompanied the doctor to the young woman's cottage. He was
an honest man, who acted up to his convictions; and where anybody
so important as Viscount Hurley was concerned, he would not trust
to the services of any intermediary. He saw the young woman
himself&mdash;Janet Wells by name; a very good-looking young
person, strong, tall, and vigorous; just the sort of girl whom, on
any but moral grounds, one would desire to intrust with the keeping
of one's children. He asked her a question or two, with
<i>doctrinaire</i> stiffness, and was astonished to find she
resented some of them. However, though she was at first most averse
to giving up her own baby, to which she attached an enormous
importance&mdash;'and very properly too,' Remenham thought, 'for
the instinct of maternity lies at the root of race
preservation'&mdash;she was at last bribed over by promises of
money into accepting the charge of the infant viscount. It was
further arranged that the noble baby should be brought to her, well
wrapped up, at once, and that her own plebeian infant, for better
security of the high-born child, should be conveyed away forthwith,
to be brought up by hand at a married sister's, lest the mother
should be tempted to share with it the natural sustenance duly
bought and paid for on account of Lord Hurley.</p>
<p>As soon as they were gone, however, Janet turned to her mother.
'Mother,' she said firmly, 'I <i>won't</i> send my baby
away&mdash;no, not for any one's.'</p>
<p>'What will you do, then?' her mother asked. 'They're sure to ax
what's become o' it.'</p>
<p>Janet reflected a minute or two. Then she said in a tentative
way, 'We could borrow Sarah Marlowe's baby, and keep it in the
house till they fetch the lady's. Then we could send it away by
their men to Lucy's, and tell them to watch, if they liked, whether
any other baby ever came back again. Sarah Marlowe could fetch her
own from Lucy's to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'If I was you,' the mother said, 'I wouldn't cast no doubts upon
it.'</p>
<p>'That's true,' Janet answered feebly. 'Just send Sarah's baby
away to Lucy's without saying nothing about it.' And she dropped
back on her pillow in a listless way, adding nothing further.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that when little Lord Hurley arrived, squat
nose, mottled arms, red face, and all, there were three babies in
the cottage instead of two; and when the third, which was Sarah
Marlowe's, was sent away under charge of Lord Remenham himself to
the married sister's, Janet's and the lordling remained in
possession, to fight it out between themselves as best they might
as to their natural sustenance.</p>
<p>That evening, Janet submitted to have her own baby fed upon
Somebody's food, while she nursed the interloper as if it were her
own. But all the time she felt like a murderess. How dare she
deprive that child she had borne of its divinely-sent nourishment!
Her heart&mdash;a mother's heart&mdash;turned sick within her. Come
what might, she would nurse her own baby, she vowed internally, not
the Countess's. She revolted against this unnatural and cruel
diversion.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, therefore, when all in the house were
asleep, she arose tottering from her bed, and approached the two
cradles. Babies are much alike; her own and the lordling looked so
precisely similar that even she herself, but for the clothes, could
hardly have discriminated them. Hastily and with trembling fingers
she tore off the sleeping young aristocrat's finery&mdash;he wore a
trifle less of it at night than by day&mdash;and also undressed her
own red little bantling. In two minutes' time the momentous
transformation was fully complete. The Countess herself could not
have told her own child, as it lay there and slept, from the
cottager's infant.</p>
<p>Once done, the substitution cost no trouble of any sort. Next
morning Janet saw the baby&mdash;her baby, in its borrowed
finery&mdash;washed and dressed and duly taken care of; while she
took little heed of the lordly changeling in its poorer garb, as
her mother fed it in a perfunctory way out of the bottle. Somewhat
later in the day, indeed, she looked at her mother queerly. 'After
all, mother,' she said, blinking, 'there's something in blood. I
think the little lord looks more of a baby nor mine does somehow.'
And she smiled at her own child, in his stolen plumes,
contentedly.</p>
<p>'He's a proper baby, that he is,' her mother admitted, not
suspecting the substitution.</p>
<p>'I was thinking,' Janet put in, 'that perhaps it isn't safe to
keep my baby in the house now at all. They might make a fuss if
they were to find it out. Since this one's come, and I've begun
nursing him, he seems to belong to me, almost. Suppose we was to
send my own to Lucy's, to be brought up by hand. It 'ud be kind of
safer like.'</p>
<p>The mother acquiesced, not sorry to see that unwelcome intruder,
as she thought it, stowed safely out of the way. So that very
night, the real little Lord Hurley was ignominiously despatched by
private messenger to the married sister's; while the false Lord
Hurley, just as red and as mottled, stopped on with his mother in
his appropriated feathers.</p>
<p>For ten months, at home and at the castle, Janet nursed her own
baby honestly and sedulously. She wasted upon it the whole of a
mother's affection. Gradually, when she began to realise what she
had done, it occurred to her that perhaps she had not acted for
herself with the supremest wisdom. At first, her one idea had been
the purely instinctive and natural one that she wanted to nurse and
tend her own baby&mdash;not another woman's. But, joined with this
prime instinct, there had also been present more or less to her
mind another feeling&mdash;the feeling that her baby had as good a
right in the nature of things to wealth and honour, and
uncomfortably belaced and beflounced baby-linen, as any other
woman's baby. The pressure of these two ideas, acting unequally
together, had led her in a moment of hysterical impulse to exchange
the two children. Now the exchange was once made it satisfied her
very well&mdash;while she could keep her own baby. The question
was, How would things stand when the time came for her to part with
it?</p>
<p>In due course it came about that the two infants were
christened. Lord and Lady Remenham had Janet's child admitted into
the fold of the Church with the aid of a bishop, and a considerable
admixture of those pomps and vanities of this wicked world which
they simultaneously and verbally abjured for it. Janet herself, as
by office entitled, brought the baby to the font, where a Countess
held it, while a Marchioness assisted her in promising on its
behalf a large number of things, which nobody very seriously
intended to perform for it. The child was enrolled as an infantile
Christian under the sonorous names of Hugh Seymour Plantagenet,
which in themselves might be regarded as slight guarantees that the
pomps and vanities aforesaid would be duly avoided. As to the
Countess's son, he was baptized at the parish church of the village
by the curate. Sister Lucy held him at the font, and abjured for
him, with far greater sincerity and probability, all participation
in the sins of the great world, from which Janet's action had
effectually cut him off. As for a name, Plantagenets being out of
the question, he was cheaply and economically baptized as
William.</p>
<p>Thus those two began their way through the world: the cottager's
unwelcome baby as the heir of an Earl; and the Countess's son as
the illegitimate child of a discredited housemaid.</p>
<p>While the ten months lasted Janet was happy enough. She had her
child with her, and she had assured its future. But as the period
of wet-nursing drew towards a close, and there was talk of weaning,
a terrible longing began to come over her. Must she send away her
baby, her own dear baby, now she was just getting to love it far
better than ever?&mdash;now it 'took notice' so sweetly, and
returned her smile, and looked up into her eyes with those big,
black eyes, that recalled its father? It was too, too cruel. The
neighbours had noted that, while Janet was nursing the little lord,
as they thought, she had taken small note of her own neglected
baby, sent away to be brought up by hand at her sister Lucy's.
''Tis that way always with love-children,' they said; 'partic'larly
when the mother hires herself out a-wetnursing. She don't want none
of her own. Her heart is all set on the baby she's suckling.' Janet
heard them as in a dream, and smiled to herself with a strange, sad
smile, half superior knowledge, half regret and remorse; not indeed
for her act, but for its coming consequence. 'She knows the baby's
a lord,' the neighbours said, 'and she don't want none of her own
love-child after it.' Not want none of her own, indeed! It was
<i>because</i> it was her own that she couldn't bear to part with
it, though she knew it was for the child's best: she had secured
its future. But what was its future to her&mdash;if it must be
taken away from her and made into a lord, never to know its own
mother?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, fight against it and shrink from it as she might,
the time came at last when her baby must needs be taken from her;
or rather, when she must leave it, for from the end of the first
month she had lived at the castle, well cared for and waited upon,
and treated in everything as such an important person as Lord
Hurley's wet-nurse deserves to be treated. But now Lady Remenham's
orders were absolute&mdash;that woman who was stealing her baby
from her, under pretence of its being her own: the child must be
weaned within a fortnight, and Janet must leave the castle for
ever.</p>
<p>The dark day came. With a horrible sinking Janet prepared to go.
The baby clung to her, as if it knew what was happening. She tore
herself away, more dead than alive. Lady Remenham admitted she was
very fond of the child. 'Fond of the child, Gwendoline!' Lord
Remenham exclaimed, with greater truth: 'her conduct has been most
exemplary. We owe her a debt of the deepest gratitude. My only
feeling is that I've sometimes had qualms of conscience, when I saw
how completely we had perverted&mdash;or shall I say
diverted?&mdash;her natural instincts. I've felt at moments she was
centring upon Hugh affections which should have been centred upon
her own poor wronged and neglected baby.'</p>
<p>'You're always so absurdly conscientious,' Lady Remenham
replied, with her flippant air. 'We've paid the girl well for
it.'</p>
<p>'Her? Yes, her. But <i>not</i> her child,' Remenham answered,
with his deeper sense of equity. 'Her child, from whom we've bribed
her against her will by our offer of money. And the more she has
grown to love our baby&mdash;which she has undoubtedly done,
Gwen&mdash;the more have I felt my indebtedness to her infant. I
shall provide for that child.' And Remenham, who was a man with a
conscience, did provide for him decently. The Countess laughed at
him. She did not know she was laughing at him for making due
provision for their own baby.</p>
<p>Remenham had his way, however. He was a quiet, forcible man. He
provided Janet with a lump sum down, in ready money, which he
placed at a bank for her; and he took a lodging-house for her in a
Thames valley town, neither too near nor too remote&mdash;near
enough for her to keep touch with her parents ('Which is
essential,' he said, 'to keeping straight with women of her
class'); yet far enough away for her to call herself 'Mrs. Wells,'
without much fear of contradiction by her neighbours. 'You have now
a chance, my girl,' he said, with his superior and condescending
kindliness, 'of retrieving your position. Behave well, and some
good young man of your own class may still make honourable love to
you.'</p>
<p>But Janet was so overwhelmed with distress at leaving her
child&mdash;the child for whose future she had provided so
fatally&mdash;that she cared little just at present for the good
young man, or the honourable love he was still to offer her. Her
whole being for the moment was summed up in wounded affection for
the child of the worthless creature who had got her into this
trouble, and then basely enlisted in order to desert her. And the
sense that she had brought this second bereaval upon herself by her
foolish action only made her grief more poignant. She felt no
particular remorse for her betrayal of Lord Remenham and his
countess&mdash;most young women of her class are not built for such
remorse,&mdash;but she suffered agonies of distress at the loss of
her baby.</p>
<p>'You'll have your own little one back again now,' her mother
said to her, the first evening, while preparations for the move
were being made in the cottage.</p>
<p><i>Her own</i> little one! Janet's heart gave a start. She had
hardly even thought of that other baby&mdash;the Countess's
baby&mdash;the baby at Lucy's. She supposed she must have him
back.</p>
<p>'Oh, I'll get him in a day or two,' she answered listlessly.
'But he'll never be the same to me as&mdash;as the dear little
thing I've been nursing for my lady.'</p>
<p>Her mother gazed hard at her.</p>
<p>''Tis strange,' she said; ''tis always so with foster-mothers.
It seems as if love went out of one with the mother's milk. If you
nurse another woman's baby you get fonder of it, they say, nor you
would of your own. 'Tis no use denying it. The good Lord has made
us so.'</p>
<p>Janet rose from her chair and took refuge in her own bedroom.
There, sobbing low to herself, as one must do in a cottage, lest
one's sobs should be heard through the thin partitions, she rolled
and cried, hugging herself wildly at the deadly irony of it. Love
any other child better than her own dear baby! Why, she hated the
very thought of having that other one back. How could she endure to
bring it up? And, then, to think of the long years through which
she must go on pretending to love it!</p>
<p>However, for fear's sake and the neighbours', there was nothing
for her to do but to take back the child that had been christened
William, and to make believe to her mother that she took some care
of it. So she brought it away from Lucy's, and carried it home to
the cottage, while preparations still went on for the move to the
lodging-house. Her first thoughts of it were almost murderous.
Bring up that brat&mdash;that puling child of Lady
Remenham's&mdash;that boy that had dispossessed her of her own dear
pet!&mdash;no, no, she <i>could</i> not do it. For a week or two
she would pretend to take care of it, for form's sake; 'but there's
plenty of ways,' she thought, 'you can get rid of babies a long way
short of strangling them. There always comes turns when you can
hardly nurse 'em through, with the best care you can give 'em.
Neglect 'em then, and you're soon enough free from 'em.'</p>
<p>However, the first night baby Willie came home, she undressed
him and tended him as she had tended Hugh Seymour Plantagenet, her
own lordly babe&mdash;tended that Countess's brat who had hitherto
been accustomed to the tender mercies of Lucy's bringing up by
hand, in the precarious intervals of her dairy work and her charge
of her own five half-starved little ones. Baby Willie took to the
new nurse instantly. In her heart Janet despised the unclassed
little lordling. Accustomed as she was to her own noble Hugh, with
his exquisite baby-linen, his beautiful cradle, and his embroidered
coronet, she thought small things indeed of the poor wee
changeling, who had been brought up by hand in a labourer's cottage
and swathed in such clothes as she had provided beforehand for her
own unwelcome, unclassed infant. Nevertheless, she had acquired at
the castle a certain fastidious way of taking care of a baby; and,
mechanically at first, by the mere routine habits of the English
housemaid, she went on taking care of the Countess's brat with the
same solicitude she had been accustomed to lavish upon Hugh Seymour
Plantagenet.</p>
<p>Little by little a curious feeling began to come over her. Every
night and every morning she looked after baby Willie, and did for
him all the things she had been accustomed to do in the
night-nursery at the Earl's, for the reputed Lord Hurley. And even
as she did them she was dimly aware that they afforded her a
certain curious consolation and comfort in her bereavement. Having
lost her own baby, for all practical purposes (by her own act, yet
unwillingly), it pleased her at least to have some other child upon
whom she might continue to expend those motherly cares which were
at first an instinct, and had now come to be a habit with her. Even
so, people who have lost a child of their own often wish to adopt
one of corresponding age, not to break continuity in the current of
their feelings. When Janet first had to give up her own baby, it is
true, she hated the very thought of being compelled to tend that
child of the Countess's. But after a week or two of the other
woman's baby, she found the comfort of having still a child to
think about so great and so consoling, that not for worlds would
she have relinquished the pleasure of tending it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the move to the neighbouring town had been made, and
Janet had taken up her new position in life as mistress of a
lodging-house. Before her baby was born she would have thought that
position a very 'grand' one, and would have felt afraid of actually
ordering about a servant of her own; but ten months at the castle
had wrought a vast difference in her point of view: she was
accustomed there to be petted and waited upon; a footman in silk
stockings had brought up her meals to the day-nursery, for she had
received in every way the amount of consideration that should
naturally be paid to Lord Hurley's foster-mother. So she found it
'rather a come-down in life,' as she said, than otherwise, to go
straight from being waited upon by lordly flunkeys to receiving
orders for dinner from casual lodgers. However, being a tall young
woman of some grace and dignity, she gave a certain importance to
her new position, and was treated as a rule with considerable
respect by the better class of her visitors. Her plain black dress,
her slight affectation of widowhood, and her undeniable care and
attention for her baby, impressed them with the idea that Mrs.
Wells, as they called her, was 'a most superior young woman for her
station.' And in point of fact Janet had been well grounded in
fundamentals at the village school, and made 'a lodging-house lady'
as good as the best of them.</p>
<p>Her rooms, for the most part, were full in summer with waterside
visitors, though half empty in winter, when the season was dull;
but with what she made by them, and what Lord Remenham allowed her,
she managed to live in a style which her new class considered
extremely comfortable. Meanwhile Willie grew on, and, to her own
great surprise at first, Janet found herself constantly more and
more attached to him. The child was with her all day; she taught it
to walk, to talk, to dress itself; if it had been her very own, it
could hardly have been much nearer to her. Gradually she felt it
was filling the place in her heart that her own dear baby had once
better filled; and though she shrank from the recognition of that
fact, far more than she had shrunk from the first substitution, it
forced itself upon her, whether she would or not, from month to
month, with increasing distinctness.</p>
<p>Three times a year 'Mrs. Wells' returned by permission to the
castle, to visit once more her own lost darling. Lord Remenham was
touched by her constant attachment to 'Hughie,' and even the
Countess admitted in her cold way that 'Wells had behaved
throughout in the most exemplary manner'; there was no denying the
reality of her attachment to her foster-son. But as little Lord
Hurley reached seven and eight, Janet was aware of a painful
element, which grew more and more marked in these occasional
visits. It was clear each time that Hugh cared less and less to see
her. To say the truth, these four-monthly outbursts of spasmodic
affection on the part of a stranger distinctly bored the child. He
didn't care twopence himself about Mrs. Wells, whom he was told by
his father he ought to love 'because she was his
foster-mother'&mdash;a phrase which conveyed to him about as much
information as if he had been told that Janet was his residuary
legatee or his feudal suzerain. At first he merely felt the stated
visits a vague nuisance; they interfered with his playing: but as
time went on, he learned to hate them, and to shrink from being
'slobbered over,' as he expressed it, by a woman for whom he had
not any feeling on earth save one of mild though growing aversion.
At last, he flatly refused to see Mrs. Wells at all; and when Lord
Remenham interfered, and insisted, in his honest, stiff-necked way,
that Hugh must 'show some gratitude to the woman who had saved his
life,' the boy showed it by receiving her with marked
ungraciousness, and audibly exclaiming, in a voice of relief,
'Well, thank goodness, that's over!' as she left his presence.</p>
<p>Had this happened when he was two years old, or even three, it
would have broken Janet's heart by its cruel irony. But happening
when he was ten, it affected her far less poignantly than she could
herself have anticipated. She had grown meanwhile to be fonder and
fonder of Willie&mdash;'My own dear boy,' as she now called him to
herself; she took less and less notice, thought less and less
meanwhile, of the arrogant young aristocrat whom she had brought
into the world to be the Countess's plaything. Willie was so sweet
and good, and so deeply attached to her; while Hugh had rapidly
developed what she could not but consider the haughtiness of his
class, and seemed to think his real mother 'like the dirt beneath
his feet,' as she said to herself bitterly. Moreover, she had
another cause of grievance against the sturdy little viscount. He
was strong and vigorous, with the robust constitution inherited
from a peasant father and mother; while Willie, her own dear
Willie, was weak and ailing, and often required her most tender
nursing. When he was only two years old, indeed, he had a terrible
attack of croup, which nearly carried him off; and as Janet sat up
all night, with clasped hands and streaming eyes, watching by the
couch of the other woman's son, it came home to her all at once
that to lose Willie now would be ten thousand times worse for her
than to lose her own boy, the false Lord Hurley.</p>
<p>So things went on for several years: though after the little
episode of 'Thank goodness, that's over!' Janet went back no more
on her formal visits to the castle. She wrote Lord Remenham a most
dignified and sensible letter upon the subject&mdash;just a trifle
marred by her housemaidenly handwriting. 'I could not help seeing,
my lord,' she said, with simple eloquence, 'on my last visit to the
castle, that my dear foster-child no longer regards me with any
affection. As that is so, much as it grieves me, I think I had
better discontinue my visits. I love him as deeply and as dearly as
ever; but I love him too well to desire to hurt him, by inflicting
myself upon him when he doesn't want me.'</p>
<p>Remenham read the letter aloud as a penance to Hugh; who
responded with effusion, 'Well, that's one good thing, anyhow!' He
was deaf to his father's expressions of regret that he should have
so alienated the feelings of a good woman, who loved him. 'What
right had she to call me "my Hughie"?' he asked, with warmth. 'Why,
Charlie says she's nothing at all but a common lodging-house
woman.' Charlie was Hugh's friend, a boy-groom at the stables.</p>
<p>Remenham felt this conduct on Hurley's part so bitterly, that he
actually went across to the neighbouring town to call upon Janet,
and apologise to her for his son's coldness. But he chanced on a
day when Willie was ill and kept home from school. The boy's
delicacy struck him. 'Is he often so?' he asked, with a
heart-pang.</p>
<p>'Well, he's never been strong, my lord,' Janet answered
truthfully; 'having been brought up by hand, you know&mdash;it
never does suit them.' And as she spoke a sudden dagger went
through her heart all at once, to think she should have starved
that dear boy of the nourishment his father the Earl had bought and
paid for&mdash;in order to feed that strong and healthy and
ungrateful young aristocrat, her boy, Hugh Seymour Plantagenet,
Viscount Hurley.</p>
<p>The Earl recounted it all at length to his wife that night.
'Gwen,' he said seriously, 'we had no right to do it. I must
provide better for that boy. I shall allow his mother a hundred a
year for his education. He's a most intelligent child, with
excellent faculties; and I'm sure he'd do credit to any pains
bestowed upon him.'</p>
<p>'My dear,' the Countess answered, 'you shall do nothing so
quixotic.'</p>
<p>The natural result of which was that the Earl did it, and said
no more about it.</p>
<p>This princely allowance for her boy's education stirred up in
Janet's mind a fresh ambition. Like all dwellers in the Thames
valley, she knew well the name and the fame of Oxford. It loomed
large in her eyes, as the metropolis of the river. 'Twas not so
much as a great university, however, that Oxford appealed to her,
but as a place where men lived and learned to be
gentlemen&mdash;real waterside gentlemen, in white sweaters and red
blazers and straw hats with banded ribbons. Oxford men came often
to her lodgings in the summer&mdash;with the cardinal's hat or the
red cross embroidered on their jerseys,&mdash;and she recognised
the fact that there was a Something about them. Why should not her
boy, her own dear Willie, be sent to Oxford, and there manufactured
into a real gentleman? Manufactured? Why, he was a gentleman
born&mdash;and a nobleman too, if it came to that, and the real
Lord Hurley! If she sent him to Oxford, she might undo some part of
the terrible wrong she had done him long since in depriving him of
his birthright&mdash;a wrong which, brought home to her now she
loved him, was beginning to weigh upon her soul not a little; for
with our peasant class, incapable of any broad abstract ideas, you
must have a personal substratum of emotional feeling to work upon
in every case, before there can be any real recognition of right
and wrong in their wider aspects. It was a wild ambition, perhaps,
for a lodging-house keeper to entertain; but there was a good
grammar-school in the town, where the boys wore square college
caps; and with Lord Remenham's hundred a year, a great deal was
possible. She would begin saving it up, for it was to be paid to
her quarterly at once; and by the time her boy was of an age to go
to Oxford, she would have enough to send him there&mdash;and to
live herself in such a way as not to disgrace him.</p>
<p>Thenceforth she saved with the petty, penurious, argus-eyed
saving of the lesser <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Not so far as Willie was
concerned, however. For him, she spent all she could afford, to
keep him neat and well dressed, and to let him associate with other
boys who were fit companions for a destined Oxford man. Nay, more:
hard as it was for her to refuse them, she took no more big
schoolboys or Oxford men as lodgers in summer: no undergraduate
henceforth should ever be able to say, 'I know that man&mdash;I
lodged with his mother a couple of years ago.' Year after year she
saved up, and sent Willie to the grammar-school, and dressed him
well, and took every fond care of him. And year after year she
loved him more and more, with the ardent love one lavishes on those
for whom one has worked and endured and suffered. Yet ever amidst
it all came the gnawing thought, 'All I can do for him is as
nothing now, compared to what I have taken from him. I deprived him
of an earldom; and I can educate him, perhaps, to be a curate or a
schoolmaster.'</p>
<p>As for Willie, he loved and admired his mother&mdash;as he
naturally called her. He was fond of her and proud of her; for she
was tall and handsome; she 'held her head up'; and he could see how
hard she worked to keep the family 'respectable.' He honoured her
for that wish; for he had inherited the Earl's conscientious,
conventional, honest, <i>doctrinaire</i> nature. He was prouder of
her by far than he would have been of the Countess. When he was
getting to be seventeen, it began to strike Janet that her
occasional lapses in grammar, though more and more infrequent as
she got on in the world, were a source of pain or humiliation to
her boy; and she said to him frankly, 'Correct me, Willie, and
explain <i>why</i> to me.' He corrected and explained; and Janet,
who was naturally clear-headed, sensible, and logical, understood
and grasped the principles he expounded to her. She took pains with
her English. As he got on at school&mdash;he was head of his class
always, and took all the prizes, especially in classics&mdash;she
felt still more of a desire not to shame her boy when he should go
to Oxford; and with this intent she made him read her books, and
read them herself&mdash;Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray, the current
novelists&mdash;so that she might at least avoid putting her foot
in it when she heard them talked of. And being a woman of
remarkable mother-wit and quickness, she found very soon, to her
immense surprise, that she could talk of many such things a great
deal better than some silly 'real ladies.'</p>
<p>It was a glorious day when, soon after Willie was nineteen, her
boy returned from a week's visit to that marvellous Oxford one day,
with the incredibly great news that he had won a junior studentship
at Christ Church. (That is the name at 'the House' for what
anywhere else would be called a scholarship.) It was worth eighty
pounds a year, and, with Lord Remenham's allowance, it would enable
him to live like a gentleman at Oxford. Janet made a rapid
calculation in her own mind. Yes, yes; she could allow him seventy
pounds more herself, which would give him an income of £250; and
yet, by expending all her little savings in one wild burst, she
would be able to live at Oxford herself, in quiet lodgings, for
three years, like a lady, so as not to disgrace him!</p>
<p>One thing alone poisoned her happiness in this hour of triumph.
Willie added at last, with a touch of not unnatural pleasure, 'And
I beat some fellows from the biggest schools&mdash;from Eton and
Harrow; amongst others, Lord Hurley.'</p>
<p>A stab went straight through the mother's heart, or rather, the
foster-mother's&mdash;for it was not Hugh she was thinking of.
'Will he go to Christ Church with you?' she asked, trembling.</p>
<p>'Yes, mother dear, but without a studentship.'</p>
<p>Strange thoughts coursed quickly through Janet's head. That
young aristocrat, her own son, might be rude to her dear boy. How
much did he know? How much did he remember? It was fortunate she
had left off going to see him at the castle when he was ten years
old. Perhaps the whole episode might have faded from his memory.
But the Earl would know. And the Earl might tell him.</p>
<p>At that moment, if she didn't hate Hugh, at least she feared
him. And such fear as hers was not far from hatred.</p>
<p>October term came. It was the hour of freshmen. And when Lord
Hurley set out from the castle, his father (or rather his reputed
father) said to him as his last word, 'You know your
foster-mother's boy, young Wells, gained that junior studentship
that you missed, Hurley. Be sure, my boy, for our sake, that you
are kind to him.'</p>
<p>'All right, father,' Hurley answered, as he jumped into the
dogcart which was to take him to the station. But he added to
himself, with a smile, 'Just like my father! Wants to make me
polite to every deserving young cad who happens to interest
him.'</p>
<p>Three days later Janet was walking down the High, with her boy
in cap and gown, proud and delighted as she had never been before
in that strange varied life of hers. It was a moment of pure
triumph. All at once, from a window overhead, she heard a murmur of
voices. They came from a first-floor window of a club of
undergraduates, which was gay even then with flowers in boxes.</p>
<p>'Why, that's the woman we lodged with three or four years ago
when we stopped by the river!'&mdash;one voice exclaimed&mdash;the
voice of an Oriel commoner. 'How awfully odd! And she's walking
with a 'Varsity man!'</p>
<p>'Yes,' a second voice drawled. 'Devilish odd, isn't it? That's
my old foster-mother, Mrs. Wells; and she's walking with her son.
He's a <i>protégé</i> of my father's; and he's got a junior
studentship at the House. Rum combination, ain't it?'</p>
<p>Janet glanced at Willie. He had not a mother's ears, like hers;
and he had not heard them. He walked on smiling, unaware of this
calamity.</p>
<p>Janet Wells went home to her lodgings that night in an agony of
misery. The Nemesis of her wrong-doing had come home to her indeed.
She was paying her penalty. To think there was a day when she
fancied she would like to strangle her Willie, because he had taken
Hugh from her! Why, she hated Hugh now! Hated him even more
profoundly and fiercely, by far, than she had ever loved him. That
baseborn son of a drunken soldier to scorn her own boy&mdash;her
good, gentle Willie!</p>
<p>The drunken soldier's son had deprived her Willie of his
birthright and his earldom! And, worse than all, <i>she</i> had
helped him to do it!</p>
<p>She did not undress that night. She lay upon her bed in her
clothes, and tossed and turned, and moaned and suffered. It was
irrevocable now&mdash;quite, quite irrevocable. If she went to Lord
Remenham and told him her tale to-morrow, how <i>could</i> he
believe her? it was all too stale, too strange, too
romantic&mdash;and hackneyed romantic at that&mdash;for any one to
accept it. People would say she had been reading the <i>Family
Herald</i> tales; or that her head was full of Lady Clare and Lord
Ronald. What on earth could be more improbable, at our own time of
day, than a tale of a changeling? and who on earth would swallow it
on her unaided evidence?</p>
<p>She had dispossessed her boy, and, more terrible than all, she
had laid him open to Lord Hurley's cruel condescensions&mdash;the
cruel condescensions of the soldier's bastard.</p>
<p>Early next morning she rose, dressed her tumbled hair carefully,
made herself as neat as she could with a flower in her bodice, and
despatched a hurried note to Willie at Christ Church. 'Come at
once,' it said, 'to your heartbroken mother.'</p>
<p>Willie rushed round, wondering. Then, pale of face and haggard
of eye, Janet began to confess to him. She did not even sob: it was
far beyond sobbing. She told him first what she had heard Lord
Hurley say at the window the night before. Then she made a dramatic
pause: 'And that boy,' she added, 'is my own son, Willie.'</p>
<p>For a second Willie thought she was mad. Then he looked in her
face, her white, bloodless face, and saw she was speaking the truth
under strong emotion.</p>
<p>'How do you mean, mother?' he gasped.</p>
<p>Janet told him the whole tale, simply, in a few strong words,
with peasant brevity and peasant absence of self-justification. She
had done it, that was all&mdash;for ample reason at the time; and
now she was paying for it.</p>
<p>When she had finished she looked him in the face.</p>
<p>'You don't believe it?' she cried defiantly.</p>
<p>He took her hands in his.</p>
<p>'Dear mother,' he said, 'I believe it. I believe you always. You
never deceived me. I believe it; and I am sorry&mdash;for one thing
only. If I am not <i>your</i> son, you take from me a thing I
valued most of all&mdash;for I was proud to be the son of such a
mother.'</p>
<p>Those words repaid her for years of anguish. She strained him to
her bosom. 'My boy, my boy,' she cried, 'I have robbed you of your
inheritance!'</p>
<p>'The inheritance of your blood,' Willie answered, 'yes. The
other, I don't care about.'</p>
<p>She clasped him again. At least she would die happy.</p>
<p>'What can we do?' she cried. 'Can I confess to Lord
Remenham?'</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>'Oh no,' he answered. 'It would do no good. We should both be
regarded as absurd impostors. Nobody would believe it&mdash;except
myself. All the rest would think it was a foolish lie&mdash;and I
had egged you on to tell it.'</p>
<p>She held him tight against her breast.</p>
<p>'Don't be afraid,' she said. 'I will hold my tongue. I will not
again destroy your prospects.'</p>
<p>They sat together in her rooms all that day, for the most part
in silence, holding one another's hands in mute sympathy. On the
stroke of midnight he left her, as he must, to return to
college.</p>
<p>'Good-night, dearest!' he said, with a strange foreboding.
'Remember, I do not blame you in anything. I understand all; and a
French proverb says, "To understand all is to pardon all."'</p>
<p>She kissed him hysterically and let him go at once, without one
word of leave-taking.</p>
<p>By the first post next morning he received two notes from her.
One was formal, and intended only for the inspection of the
coroner. It spoke of nothing but sleeplessness, depression,
narcotics. The other ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>'My own, own Darling,<br>
<br>
'I do not wish to murder the son I bore. But if I remain alive I
feel I must rush upon Hurley, wherever I meet him, and stab him. I
am not even sure it is because he is my own child that I want to
spare him&mdash;is it not rather because I do not wish people to
say your mother was a murderess? So, good-bye for ever. Willie, my
Willie, I have wronged you deeply; I will wrong you no more. They
will think it was merely an overdose of morphia.<br>
<br>
'Your loving<br>
Mother.'</blockquote>
<p>The jury returned it 'Death by Misadventure.'</p>

<h2><a name="INTERMEZZO" id="INTERMEZZO"></a>INTERMEZZO</h2>
<h3>LANGALULA</h3>
<p>Langalula was a great chief. The people he ruled were numerous
and warlike: his assegais were ten thousand: his tribe had many
cattle. So the Missionary at his kraal was glad indeed when he felt
he had touched Langalula's heart; for it meant the conversion of a
whole heathen nation.</p>
<p>When the king goes over, the people soon follow him.</p>
<p>Langalula said, 'I am convinced; baptize me.'</p>
<p>But the ways of white men, are they not incomprehensible? Though
the Missionary had been preaching that very thing for months, yet
when Langalula gave in he answered, 'Conviction alone is not
enough. You must wait a while till I feel that your life shows
forth works meet for repentance.' Langalula grumbled. He was little
accustomed to such contradiction. But he knew it was hard arguing
with these priestly white men, who will baptize a starving slave
every bit as soon as a great chief; so he held his peace, and,
though he chafed at it, waited the Missionary's pleasure.</p>
<p>By and by, one day, the Missionary came to him. 'Langalula,' he
said condescendingly, 'I have watched you close for many weeks now,
and I think I can baptize you.'</p>
<p>'Then all my sins will be forgiven?' asked Langalula.</p>
<p>'All your sins will be forgiven,' the Missionary answered.</p>
<p>'But I must put away my wives?' Langalula asked once more.</p>
<p>'All save one,' answered the Missionary. It was a point of
doctrine, or at least of discipline.</p>
<p>'Then I think,' Langalula said, 'I will wait for a week&mdash;so
as to make up my mind which one of them is dearest to me.'</p>
<p>But he said this deceitfully, knowing in his own heart that all
his sins were going to be forgiven, and determining in the interval
to marry another wife, whom he would keep as his companion when he
put away the others. For there was a young girl coming on, black
but comely, the daughter of Khamsua, a neighbouring chief, whom
Langalula had seen, and whom he wished to purchase. And since the
last love is always (for the moment) the greatest, the chief cared
very little whether he must put away all his other wives or not, if
only he could keep Malali. She had driven out the rest of them. He
had watched the girl growing up at Khamsua's for years, and had
said to himself always, 'Whenever Malali is of marriageable age,
see if I do not buy her and marry her.'</p>
<p>In pursuance of this plan, as soon as the Missionary was gone,
Langalula rose up, and took the fighting men of his tribe with him
(that there might be no dispute), and marched into the country of
Malali's father, whose name, as I said, was Khamsua. When Khamsua
heard Langalula was on his way to his land with five thousand
assegais, not to speak of Winchester rifles, he went out to meet
him with a great retinue.</p>
<p>Khamsua cringed. Langalula said to him, 'I am come to ask for
Malali.'</p>
<p>The moment Khamsua heard that saying, he was unspeakably
terrified, and flung himself down on his face, and clasped
Langalula's knees. For Khamsua was only a small chief in the
country compared with Langalula.</p>
<p>'O my king,' Khamsua said, 'O lion of the people, how could I
know so great a monarch as you had set his eyes on Malali? and
before you asked&mdash;woe, woe!&mdash;Montelo's people came, and
offered oxen on Montelo's behalf for Malali. And I sold her to
them, because I was afraid of Montelo, and could not have believed
so great a chief as you had ever looked upon her.'</p>
<p>Langalula smiled at that. 'Oh, as for Montelo,' he said, 'I can
easily take her from him; and then I can get the Missionary to
marry us.'</p>
<p>Khamsua, however, answered like a fool. 'It cannot be. The
Christians are so strait-laced. Montelo is a Christian now; he was
baptized a week ago; and Malali was married to him in Christian
fashion. Even if you were to kill Montelo and take her to your
kraal, I don't believe the Missionary would marry you.'</p>
<p>Langalula turned to his men. 'Kill him,' he said simply. And
they killed him with an assegai.</p>
<p>As soon as that was finished, Langalula marched on into
Montelo's country. When he arrived there, Montelo crept out to meet
him and tried to parley with him. But Langalula would not parley
with the man who had deprived him of Malali. 'We will fight for
it,' he said angrily. And they fought for it, then and there. The
upshot of it all was that Langalula's men conquered in the battle,
and drove Montelo's men (who had no Winchesters) back to their
king's kraal; and then they killed Montelo himself, and carried his
head on an assegai.</p>
<p>By the very same evening they occupied the kraal that had once
been Montelo's, and Langalula's men brought out Malali to their own
leader. Langalula looked hard at her. She was a glossy-black girl,
very smooth-skinned and lithe, and clean of limb. The great chief
stared long at her. Malali hung her head and drooped her arms
before him. 'Why did you go with Montelo,' he asked at last, 'when
Langalula would have taken you?'</p>
<p>The girl trembled with fear. 'Twas no fault of hers. How could
she help it? A woman, there, is no free agent. 'My father sold me,'
she answered, whimpering; 'Montelo paid him a great many oxen. I
had no choice but to go. O King, O mighty lion, I did not know you
wanted me.'</p>
<p>With that she flung herself at his feet in terror, and held his
knees, imploring him.</p>
<p>'Take her to the hut that was once Montelo's,' said the great
chief, smiling; 'I will follow her there.'</p>
<p>They seized her arms and dragged her to the hut, crying and
shrieking as she went. They dragged her roughly. Langalula remained
behind, superintending the slaughter of Montelo's warriors. As soon
as he was tired he returned to the hut that had once been
Montelo's; for he wished to see Malali, whether she was really as
beautiful as he believed, even though the Missionary would never
marry him to her.</p>
<p>Malali, when she saw him, outside the hut, thought all was well,
and that Langalula loved her. So she left off crying, and tried
every art a woman knows to please and charm him. But Langalula was
a very great king, and his anger was aroused. A king's anger is
terrible. He smiled to himself to see with what simple tricks the
woman thought she could appease a mighty warrior.</p>
<p>'Go into my hut!' he said. And he followed her.</p>
<p>The next morning came, and the great king cried to himself with
annoyance and vexation that Montelo and Khamsua&mdash;and the
Missionary as well&mdash;should have done him, between them, out of
so beautiful a woman. If the Missionary had been a black man,
Langalula would have compelled him to baptize him outright, and
then to marry him properly to Malali, with book and ring, in the
Christian fashion. But he knew by experience it is no use
threatening these white men with tortures; for, threaten how you
may, they will not obey you; and, besides, the Governor would send
up troops from Cape Town; and 'tis ill fighting with the men of the
Governor. So he arose from his bed in the morning in a white heat
of passion. 'Malali,' he said, gazing at her with an ugly smile, 'I
like you better than any woman I ever yet saw. You please me in
everything. But you went off with Montelo, and the Missionary will
not marry me to you now I have speared him. I have also speared
your father, Khamsua, because he sold you for oxen to Montelo. I
want a real queen, who shall be married to me white-fashion. I am
becoming a Christian now, and can have only one wife. But it must
not be you, because you were sold to Montelo, whom I have slain in
the battle, and they will not marry us. So I will keep my own first
wife, the earliest married, though she is old and lean, and discard
the other ones. Come out of the hut, Malali, and stand in front of
my warriors.'</p>
<p>Malali was afraid at that, and would have skulked in the corner
if she dared; but she dared not, because she was frightened of
Langalula. So out she came as he bid her, trembling in all her
limbs, and crouching with terror; her knees hardly bore her.
Langalula turned to his men; he looked at her with regret. She was
sleek and beautiful.</p>
<p>'Pin her through the body to the ground with an assegai,' he
said, pointing at her.</p>
<p>And they pinned her through with an assegai.</p>
<p>'Pin her arms and her legs,' said the great chief.</p>
<p>And his followers pinned them. The woman fainted.</p>
<p>'Now leave her to die in the sun,' said Langalula.</p>
<p>So they left her to die there.</p>
<p>After that, Langalula marched back grimly with his men to his
own country. As soon as he reached his kraal he went to see the
Missionary. He was very submissive.</p>
<p>'I repent of all my sins,' he said. 'I have come to be baptized.
Teacher, I will put away all my wives save one; and even for that
one I will retain the earliest.'</p>
<p>And <i>that</i> is how Langalula became a Christian.</p>

<h3>THE CURATE OF CHURNSIDE</h3>
<p>Walter Dene, deacon, in his faultless Oxford clerical coat and
broad felt hat, strolled along slowly, sunning himself as he went,
after his wont, down the pretty central lane of West Churnside. It
was just the idyllic village best suited to the taste of such an
idyllic young curate as Walter Dene. There were cottages with
low-thatched roofs, thickly overgrown with yellow stonecrop and
pink house-leek; there were trellis-work porches up which the
scented dog-rose and the fainter honeysuckle clambered together in
sisterly rivalry; there were pargeted gable-ends of Elizabethan
farmhouses, quaintly varied with black oak joists and moulded
plaster panels. At the end of all, between an avenue of ancient
elm-trees, the heavy square tower of the old church closed in the
little vista&mdash;a church with a round Norman doorway and
dog-tooth arches, melting into Early English lancets in the aisle,
and finishing up with a great decorated east window by the broken
cross and yew-tree. Not a trace of Perpendicularity about it
anywhere, thank goodness: 'for if it were Perpendicular,' said
Walter Dene to himself often, 'I really think, in spite of my
uncle, I should have to look out for another curacy.'</p>
<p>Yes, it was a charming village, and a charming country; but,
above all, it was rendered habitable and pleasurable for a man of
taste by the informing presence of Christina Eliot. 'I don't think
I shall propose to Christina this week after all,' thought Walter
Dene as he strolled along lazily. 'The most delightful part of
love-making is certainly its first beginning. The little tremor of
hope and expectation; the half-needless doubt you feel as to
whether she really loves you; the pains you take to pierce the thin
veil of maidenly reserve; the triumph of detecting her at a blush
or a flutter when she sees you coming&mdash;all these are delicate
little morsels to be rolled daintily on the critical palate, and
not to be swallowed down coarsely at one vulgar gulp. Poor child,
she is on tenter-hooks of hesitation and expectancy all the time, I
know; for I'm sure she loves me now, I'm sure she loves me; but I
must wait a week yet: she will be grateful to me for it hereafter.
We mustn't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs; we mustn't eat
up all our capital at one extravagant feast, and then lament the
want of our interest ever afterward. Let us live another week in
our first fool's paradise before we enter on the safer but less
tremulous pleasures of sure possession. We can enjoy first love but
once in a lifetime; let us enjoy it now while we can, and not fling
away the chance prematurely by mere childish haste and girlish
precipitancy.' Thinking which thing, Walter Dene halted a moment by
the churchyard wall, picked a long spray of scented wild thyme from
a mossy cranny, and gazed into the blue sky above at the graceful
swifts who nested in the old tower, as they curved and circled
through the yielding air on their evenly poised and powerful
pinions.</p>
<p>Just at that moment old Mary Long came out of her cottage to
speak with the young parson. 'If ye plaze, Maister Dene,' she said
in her native west-country dialect, 'our Nully would like to zee
'ee. She's main ill to-day, zur, and she be like to die a'most, I'm
thinking.'</p>
<p>'Poor child, poor child,' said Walter Dene tenderly. 'She's a
dear little thing, Mrs. Long, is your Nellie, and I hope she may
yet be spared to you. I'll come and see her at once, and try if I
can do anything to ease her.'</p>
<p>He crossed the road compassionately with the tottering old
grandmother, giving her his helping hand over the kerbstone, and
following her with bated breath into the close little sickroom.
Then he flung open the tiny casement with its diamond-leaded panes,
so as to let in the fresh summer air, and picked a few sprigs of
sweetbriar from the porch, which he joined with the geranium from
his own button-hole to make a tiny nosegay for the bare bedside.
After that, he sat and talked awhile gently in an undertone to
pale, pretty little Nellie herself, and went away at last promising
to send her some jelly and some soup immediately from the vicarage
kitchen.</p>
<p>'She's a sweet little child,' he said to himself musingly,
'though I'm afraid she's not long for this world now; and the poor
like these small attentions dearly. They get them seldom, and value
them for the sake of the thoughtfulness they imply, rather than for
the sake of the mere things themselves. I can order a bottle of
calf's-foot at the grocer's, and Carter can set it in a mould
without any trouble; while as for the soup, some tinned mock turtle
and a little fresh stock makes a really capital mixture for this
sort of thing. It costs so little to give these poor souls
pleasure, and it is a great luxury to oneself undeniably. But,
after all, what a funny trade it is to set an educated man to do!
They send us up to Oxford or Cambridge, give us a distinct taste
for Aeschylus and Catullus, Dante and Milton, Mendelssohn and
Chopin, good claret and <i>olives farcies</i>, and then bring us
down to a country village, to look after the bodily and spiritual
ailments of rheumatic old washer-women! If it were not for poetry,
flowers, and Christina, I really think I should succumb entirely
under the infliction.'</p>
<p>'He's a dear, good man, that he is, is young passon,' murmured
old Mary Long as Walter disappeared between the elm-trees; 'and he
do love the poor and the zick, the same as if he was their own
brother. God bless his zoul, the dear, good vulla, vor all his
kindness to our Nully.'</p>
<p>Halfway down the main lane Walter came across Christina Eliot.
As she saw him she smiled and coloured a little, and held out her
small gloved hand prettily. Walter took it with a certain courtly
and graceful chivalry. 'An exquisite day, Miss Eliot,' he said;
'such a depth of sapphire in the sky, such a faint undertone of
green on the clouds by the horizon, such a lovely humming of bees
over the flickering hot meadows! On days like this, one feels that
Schopenhauer is wrong after all, and that life is sometimes really
worth living.'</p>
<p>'It seems to me often worth living,' Christina answered; 'if not
for oneself, at least for others. But you pretend to be more of a
pessimist than you really are, I fancy, Mr. Dene. Any one who finds
so much beauty in the world as you do can hardly think life poor or
meagre. You seem to catch the loveliest points in everything you
look at, and to throw a little literary or artistic reflection over
them which makes them even lovelier than they are in
themselves.'</p>
<p>'Well, no doubt one can increase one's possibilities of
enjoyment by carefully cultivating one's own faculties of
admiration and appreciation,' said the curate thoughtfully; 'but,
after all, life has only a few chapters that are thoroughly
interesting and enthralling in all its history. We oughtn't to
hurry over them too lightly, Miss Eliot; we ought to linger on them
lovingly, and make the most of their potentialities; we ought to
dwell upon them like "linkèd sweetness long drawn out." It is the
mistake of the world at large to hurry too rapidly over the
pleasantest episodes, just as children pick all the plums at once
out of the pudding. I often think that, from the purely selfish and
temporal point of view, the real value of a life to its subject may
be measured by the space of time over which he has managed to
spread the enjoyment of its greatest pleasures. Look, for example,
at poetry, now.'</p>
<p>A faint shade of disappointment passed across Christina's face
as he turned from what seemed another groove into that indifferent
subject; but she answered at once, 'Yes, of course one feels that
with the higher pleasures at least; but there are others in which
the interest of plot is greater, and then one looks naturally
rather to the end. When you begin a good novel, you can't help
hurrying through it in order to find out what becomes of everybody
at last.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but the highest artistic interest goes beyond mere plot
interest. I like rather to read for the pleasure of reading, and to
loiter over the passages that please me, quite irrespective of what
goes before or what comes after; just as you, for your part, like
to sketch a beautiful scene for its own worth to you, irrespective
of what may happen to the leaves in autumn, or to the cottage roof
in twenty years from this. By the way, have you finished that
little water-colour of the mill yet? It's the prettiest thing of
yours I've ever seen, and I want to look how you've managed the
light on your foreground.'</p>
<p>'Come in and see it,' said Christina. 'It's finished now, and,
to tell you the truth, I'm very well pleased with it myself.'</p>
<p>'Then I know it must be good,' the curate answered; 'for you are
always your own harshest critic.' And he turned in at the little
gate with her, and entered the village doctor's tiny
drawing-room.</p>
<p>Christina placed the sketch on an easel near the window&mdash;a
low window opening to the ground, with long lithe festoons of
faint-scented jasmine encroaching on it from outside&mdash;and let
the light fall on it aslant in the right direction. It was a pretty
and a clever sketch certainly, with more than a mere amateur's
sense of form and colour; and Walter Dene, who had a true eye for
pictures, could conscientiously praise it for its artistic depth
and fulness. Indeed, on that head at least, Walter Dene's veracity
was unimpeachable, however lax in other matters; nothing on earth
would have induced him to praise as good a picture or a sculpture
in which he saw no real merit. He sat a little while criticising
and discussing it, suggesting an improvement here or an alteration
there, and then he rose hurriedly, remembering all at once his
forgotten promise to little Nellie. 'Dear me,' he said, 'your
daughter's picture has almost made me overlook my proper duties,
Mrs. Eliot. I promised to send some jelly and things at once to
poor little Nellie Long at her grandmother's. How very wrong of me
to let my natural inclinations keep me loitering here, when I ought
to have been thinking of the poor of my parish!' And he went out
with just a gentle pressure on Christina's hand, and a look from
his eyes that her heart knew how to read aright at the first glance
of it.</p>
<p>'Do you know, Christie,' said her father, 'I sometimes fancy
when I hear that new parson fellow talk about his artistic
feelings, and so on, that he's just a trifle selfish, or at least
self-centred. He always dwells so much on his own enjoyment of
things, you know.'</p>
<p>'Oh no, papa,' cried Christina warmly. 'He's anything but
selfish, I'm sure. Look how kind he is to all the poor in the
village, and how much he thinks about their comfort and welfare.
And whenever he's talking with one, he seems so anxious to make you
feel happy and contented with yourself. He has a sort of little
subtle flattery of manner about him that's all pure kindliness; and
he's always thinking what he can say or do to please you, and to
help you onward. What you say about his dwelling on enjoyment so
much is really only his artistic sensibility. He feels things so
keenly, and enjoys beauty so deeply, that he can't help talking
enthusiastically about it even a little out of season. He has more
feelings to display than most men, and I'm sure that's the reason
why he displays them so much. A ploughboy could only talk
enthusiastically about roast beef and dumplings; Mr. Dene can talk
about everything that's beautiful and sublime on earth or in
heaven.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Walter Dene was walking quickly with his measured
tread&mdash;the even, regular tread of a cultivated
gentleman&mdash;down the lane toward the village grocer's, saying
to himself as he went, 'There was never such a girl in all the
world as my Christina. She may be only a country surgeon's
daughter&mdash;a rosebud on a hedgerow bush&mdash;but she has the
soul and the eye of a queen among women for all that. Every lover
has deceived himself with the same sweet dream, to be
sure&mdash;how over-analytic we have become nowadays, when I must
needs half argue myself out of the sweets of first love!&mdash;but
then they hadn't so much to go upon as I have. She has a wonderful
touch in music, she has an exquisite eye in painting, she has an
Italian charm in manner and conversation. I'm something of a
connoisseur, after all, and no more likely to be deceived in a
woman than I am in a wine or a picture. And next week I shall
really propose formally to Christina, though I know by this time it
will be nothing more than the merest formality. Her eyes are too
eloquent not to have told me that long ago. It will be a delightful
pleasure to live for her, and in order to make her happy. I frankly
recognise that I am naturally a little selfish&mdash;not coarsely
and vulgarly selfish; from that disgusting and piggish vice I may
conscientiously congratulate myself that I'm fairly free; but still
selfish in a refined and cultivated manner. Now, living with
Christina and for Christina will correct this defect in my nature,
will tend to bring me nearer to a true standard of perfection. When
I am by her side, and then only, I feel that I am thinking entirely
of her, and not at all of myself. To her I show my best side; with
her, that best side would be always uppermost. The companionship of
such a woman makes life something purer, and higher, and better
worth having. The one thing that stands in our way is this horrid
practical question of what to live upon. I don't suppose Uncle
Arthur will be inclined to allow me anything, and I can't marry on
my own paltry income and my curacy only. Yet I can't bear to keep
Christina waiting indefinitely till some thick-headed squire or
other chooses to take it into his opaque brain to give me a decent
living.'</p>
<p>From the grocer's the curate walked on, carrying the two tins in
his hand, as far as the vicarage. He went into the library, sat
down by his own desk, and rang the bell. 'Will you be kind enough
to give those things to Carter, John?' he said in his bland voice;
'and tell her to put the jelly in a mould, and let it set. The soup
must be warmed with a little fresh stock, and seasoned. Then take
them both, with my compliments, to old Mary Long the washerwoman,
for her grandchild. Is my uncle in?'</p>
<p>'No, Master Walter,' answered the man&mdash;he was always
'Master Walter' to the old servants at his uncle's&mdash;'the vicar
have gone over by train to Churminster. He told me to tell you he
wouldn't be back till evening, after dinner.'</p>
<p>'Did you see him off, John?'</p>
<p>'Yes, Master Walter. I took his portmantew to the station.'</p>
<p>'This will be a good chance, then,' thought Walter Dene to
himself. 'Very well, John,' he went on aloud: 'I shall write my
sermon now. Don't let anybody come to disturb me.'</p>
<p>John nodded and withdrew. Walter Dene locked the door after him
carefully, as he often did when writing sermons, and then lit a
cigar, which was also a not infrequent concomitant of his
exegetical labours. After that he walked once or twice up and down
the room, paused a moment to look at his parchment-covered Rabelais
and Villon on the bookshelf, peered out of the dulled glass windows
with the crest in their centre, and finally drew a curious bent
iron instrument out of his waistcoat pocket. With it in his hands,
he went up quietly to his uncle's desk, and began fumbling at the
lock in an experienced manner. As a matter of fact, it was not his
first trial of skill in lockpicking; for Walter Dene was a
painstaking and methodical man, and having made up his mind that he
would get at and read his uncle's will, he took good care to begin
by fastening all the drawers in his own bedroom, and trying his
prentice hand at unfastening them again in the solitude of his
chamber.</p>
<p>After half a minute's twisting and turning, the wards gave way
gently to his dexterous pressure, and the lid of the desk lay open
before him. Walter Dene took out the different papers one by
one&mdash;there was no need for hurry, and he was not a nervous
person&mdash;till he came to a roll of parchment, which he
recognised at once as the expected will. He unrolled it carefully
and quietly, without any womanish trembling or
excitement&mdash;'Thank Heaven,' he said to himself, 'I'm above
such nonsense as that'&mdash;and sat down leisurely to read it in
the big, low, velvet-covered study chair. As he did so, he did not
forget to lay a notched foot-rest for his feet, and to put the
little Japanese dish on the tiny table by his side to hold his
cigar ash. 'And now,' he said, 'for the important question whether
Uncle Arthur has left his money to me, or to Arthur, or to both of
us equally. He ought, of course, to leave at least half to me,
seeing I have become a curate on purpose to please him, instead of
following my natural vocation to the Bar; but I shouldn't be a bit
surprised if he had left it all to Arthur. He's a pig-headed and
illogical old man, the vicar; and he can never forgive me, I
believe, because, being the eldest son, I wasn't called after him
by my father and mother. As if that was my fault! Some people's
ideas of personal responsibility are so ridiculously muddled.'</p>
<p>He composed himself quietly in the armchair, and glanced rapidly
at the will through the meaningless preliminaries till he came to
the significant clauses. These he read more carefully. 'All my
estate in the county of Dorset, and the messuage or tenement known
as Redlands, in the parish of Lode, in the county of Devon, to my
dear nephew, Arthur Dene,' he said to himself slowly: 'Oh, this
will never do.' 'And I give and bequeath to my said nephew, Arthur
Dene, the sum of ten thousand pounds, three per cent. consolidated
annuities, now standing in my name'&mdash;'Oh, this is atrocious,
quite atrocious! What's this?' 'And I give and bequeath to my dear
nephew, Walter Dene, the residue of my personal estate'&mdash;'and
so forth. Oh no. That's quite sufficient. This must be rectified.
The residuary legatee would only come in for a few hundreds or so.
It's quite preposterous. The vicar was always an ill-tempered,
cantankerous, unaccountable person, but I wonder he has the face to
sit opposite me at dinner after that.'</p>
<p>He hummed an air from Schubert, and sat a moment looking
thoughtfully at the will. Then he said to himself quietly, 'The
simplest thing to do would be merely to scrape out or take out with
chemicals the name Arthur, substituting the name Walter, and
<i>vice versâ</i>. That's a very small matter; a man who draws as
well as I do ought to be able easily to imitate a copying clerk's
engrossing hand. But it would be madness to attempt it now and
here; I want a little practice first. At the same time, I mustn't
keep the will out a moment longer than is necessary; my uncle may
return by some accident before I expect him; and the true
philosophy of life consists in invariably minimising the adverse
chances. This will was evidently drawn up by Watson and Blenkiron,
of Chancery Lane. I'll write to-morrow and get them to draw up a
will for me, leaving all I possess to Arthur. The same clerk is
pretty sure to engross it, and that'll give me a model for the two
names on which I can do a little preliminary practice. Besides, I
can try the stuff Wharton told me about, for making ink fade, on
the same parchment. That will be killing two birds with one stone,
certainly. And now if I don't make haste I shan't have time to
write my sermon.'</p>
<p>He replaced the will calmly in the desk, fastened the lock again
with a delicate twirl of the pick, and sat down in his armchair to
compose his discourse for to-morrow's evensong. 'It's not a bad bit
of rhetoric,' he said to himself as he read it over for correction,
'but I'm not sure that I haven't plagiarised a little too freely
from Montaigne and dear old Burton. What a pity it must be thrown
away upon a Churnside congregation! Not a soul in the whole place
will appreciate a word of it, except Christina. Well, well, that
alone is enough reward for any man.' And he knocked off his ash
pensively into the Japanese ashpan.</p>
<p>During the course of the next week Walter practised diligently
the art of imitating handwriting. He got his will drawn up and
engrossed at Watson and Blenkiron's (without signing it, <i>bien
entendu</i>); and he spent many solitary hours in writing the two
names 'Walter' and 'Arthur' on the spare end of parchment, after
the manner of the engrossing clerk. He also tested the stuff for
making the ink fade to his own perfect satisfaction. And on the
next occasion when his uncle was safely off the premises for three
hours, he took the will once more deliberately from the desk,
removed the obnoxious letters with scrupulous care, and wrote in
his own name in place of Arthur's, so that even the engrossing
clerk himself would hardly have known the difference. 'There,' he
said to himself approvingly, as he took down quiet old George
Herbert from the shelf and sat down to enjoy an hour's smoke after
the business was over, 'that's one good deed well done, anyhow. I
have the calm satisfaction of a clear conscience. The vicar's
proposed arrangement was really most unfair; I have substituted for
it what Aristotle would rightly have called true distributive
justice. For though I've left all the property to myself, by the
unfortunate necessity of the case, of course I won't take it all.
I'll be juster than the vicar. Arthur shall have his fair share,
which is more, I believe, than he'd have done for me; but I hate
squalid money-grubbing. If brothers can't be generous and brotherly
to one another, what a wretched, sordid little life this of ours
would really be!'</p>
<p>Next Sunday morning the vicar preached, and Walter sat looking
up at him reflectively from his place in the chancel. A beautiful
clear-cut face, the curate's, and seen to great advantage from the
doctor's pew, set off by the white surplice, and upturned in quiet
meditation towards the elder priest in the pulpit. Walter was
revolving many things in his mind, and most of all one adverse
chance which he could not just then see his way to minimise. Any
day his uncle might take it into his head to read over the will and
discover the&mdash;ah, well, the rectification. Walter was a man of
too much delicacy of feeling even to think of it to himself as a
fraud or a forgery. Then, again, the vicar was not a very old man
after all; he might live for an indefinite period, and Christina
and himself might lose all the best years of their life waiting for
a useless person's natural removal. What a pity that threescore was
not the utmost limit of human life! For his own part, like the
Psalmist, Walter had no desire to outlive his own highest tastes
and powers of enjoyment. Ah, well, well, man's prerogative is to
better and improve upon nature. If people do not die when they
ought, then it becomes clearly necessary for philosophically-minded
juniors to help them on their way artificially.</p>
<p>It was an ugly necessity, certainly; Walter frankly recognised
that fact from the very beginning, and he shrank even from
contemplating it; but there was no other way out of the difficulty.
The old man had always been a selfish bachelor, with no love for
anybody or anything on earth except his books, his coins, his
garden, and his dinner; he was growing tired of all except the
last; would it not be better for the world at large, on strict
utilitarian principles, that he should go at once? True, such steps
are usually to be deprecated; but the wise man is a law unto
himself, and instead of laying down the wooden, hard-and-fast lines
that make conventional morality so much a rule of thumb, he judges
every individual case on its own particular merits. Here was
Christina's happiness and his own on the one hand, with many
collateral advantages to other people, set in the scale against the
feeble remnant of a selfish old man's days on the other. Walter
Dean had a constitutional horror of taking life in any form, and
especially of shedding blood; but he flattered himself that if
anything of the sort became clearly necessary, he was not the man
to shrink from taking the needful measures to ensure it, at any
sacrifice of personal comfort.</p>
<p>All through the next week Walter turned over the subject in his
own mind; and the more he thought about it, the more the plan
gained in definiteness and consistency as detail after detail
suggested itself to him. First he thought of poison. That was the
cleanest and neatest way of managing the thing, he considered; and
it involved the least unpleasant consequences. To stick a knife or
shoot a bullet into any sentient creature was a horrid and
revolting act; to put a little tasteless powder into a cup of
coffee and let a man sleep off his life quietly was really nothing
more than helping him involuntarily to a delightful euthanasia. 'I
wish any one would do as much for me at his age, without telling me
about it,' Walter said to himself seriously. But then the chances
of detection would be much increased by using poison, and Walter
felt it an imperative duty to do nothing which would expose
Christina to the shock of a discovery. She would not see the matter
in the same practical light as he did; women never do; their
morality is purely conventional, and a wise man will do nothing on
earth to shake it. You cannot buy poison without the risk of
exciting question. There remained, then, only shooting or stabbing.
But shooting makes an awkward noise, and attracts attention at the
moment; so the one thing possible was a knife, unpleasant as that
conclusion seemed to all his more delicate feelings.</p>
<p>Having thus decided, Walter Dene proceeded to lay his plans with
deliberate caution. He had no intention whatsoever of being
detected, though his method of action was simplicity itself. It was
only bunglers and clumsy fools who got caught; he knew that a man
of his intelligence and ability would not make such an idiot of
himself as&mdash;well, as common ruffians always do. He took his
old American bowie-knife, bought years ago as a curiosity, out of
the drawer where it had lain so long. It was very rusty, but it
would be safer to sharpen it privately on his own hone and strop
than to go asking for a new knife at a shop for the express purpose
of enabling the shopman afterwards to identify him. He sharpened it
for safety's sake during sermon-hour in the library, with the door
locked as usual. It took a long time to get off all the rust, and
his arm got quickly tired. One morning as he was polishing away at
it, he was stopped for a moment by a butterfly which flapped and
fluttered against the dulled window-panes. 'Poor thing!' he said to
himself, 'it will beat its feathery wings to pieces in its
struggles'; and he put a vase of Venetian glass on top of it,
lifted the sash carefully, and let the creature fly away outside in
the broad sunshine. At the same moment the vicar, who was strolling
with his King Charlie on the lawn, came up and looked in at the
window. He could not have seen in before, because of the dulled and
painted diamonds.</p>
<p>'That's a murderous-looking weapon, Wally,' he said, with a
smile, as his glance fell upon the bowie and hone. 'What do you use
it for?'</p>
<p>'Oh, it's an American bowie,' Walter answered carelessly. 'I
bought it long ago for a curiosity, and now I'm sharpening it up to
help me in carving that block of walnut wood.' And he ran his
finger lightly along the edge of the blade to test its keenness.
What a lucky thing that it was the vicar himself, and not the
gardener! If he had been caught by anybody else the fact would have
been fatal evidence after all was over. 'Méfiez-vous des
papillons,' he hummed to himself, after Béranger, as he shut down
the window. 'One more butterfly, and I must give up the game as
useless.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Walter meant to make a clean job of
it&mdash;hacking and hewing clumsily was repulsive to all his finer
feelings&mdash;he began also to study carefully the anatomy of the
human back. He took down all the books on the subject in the
library, and by their aid discovered exactly under which ribs the
heart lay. A little observation of the vicar, compared with the
plates in Quain's <i>Anatomy</i>, showed him precisely at what
point in his clerical coat the most vulnerable interstice was
situated. 'It's a horrid thing to have to do,' he thought over and
over again as he planned it, 'but it's the only way to secure
Christina's happiness.' And so, by a certain bright Friday evening
in August, Walter Dene had fully completed all his
preparations.</p>
<p>That afternoon, as on all bright afternoons in summer, the vicar
went for a walk in the grounds, attended only by little King
Charlie. He was squire and parson at once in Churnside, and he
loved to make the round of his own estate. At a certain gate by
Selbury Copse the vicar always halted to rest awhile, leaning on
the bar and looking at the view across the valley. It was a safe
and lonely spot. Walter remained at home (he was to take the
regular Friday evensong) and went into the study by himself. After
a while he took his hat, not without trembling, strolled across the
garden, and then made the short cut through the copse, so as to
meet the vicar by the gate. On his way he heard the noise of the
Dennings in the farm opposite, out rabbit-shooting with their guns
and ferrets in the warren. His very soul shrank within him at the
sound of that brutal sport. 'Great heavens!' he said to himself,
with a shudder; 'to think how I loathe and shrink from the
necessity of almost painlessly killing this one selfish old man for
an obviously good reason, and those creatures there will go out
massacring innocent animals with the aid of a hideous beast of
prey, not only without remorse, but actually by way of amusement! I
thank Heaven I am not even as they are.' Near the gate he came upon
his uncle quietly and naturally, though it would be absurd to deny
that at that supreme moment even Walter Dene's equable heart
throbbed hard, and his breath went and came tremulously. 'Alone,'
he thought to himself, 'and nobody near; this is quite
providential,' using even then, in thought, the familiar
phraseology of his profession.</p>
<p>'A lovely afternoon, Uncle Arthur,' he said as composedly as he
could, accurately measuring the spot on the vicar's coat with his
eye meanwhile. 'The valley looks beautiful in this light.'</p>
<p>'Yes, a lovely afternoon, Wally, my boy, and an exquisite
glimpse down yonder into the churchyard.'</p>
<p>As he spoke, Walter half leaned upon the gate beside him, and
adjusted the knife behind the vicar's back scientifically. Then,
without a word more, in spite of a natural shrinking, he drove it
home up to the haft, with a terrible effort of will, at the exact
spot on the back that the books had pointed out to him. It was a
painful thing to do, but he did it carefully and well. The effect
of Walter Dene's scientific provision was even more instantaneous
than he had anticipated. Without a single cry, without a sob or a
contortion, the vicar's lifeless body fell over heavily by the side
of the gate. It rolled down like a log into the dry ditch beneath.
Walter knelt trembling on the ground close by, felt the pulse for a
moment to assure himself that his uncle was really dead, and having
fully satisfied himself on this all-important point, proceeded to
draw the knife neatly out of the wound. He had let it fall in the
body, in order to extricate it more easily afterward, and not risk
pulling it out carelessly so as to get himself covered needlessly
by tell-tale drops of blood, like ordinary clumsy assassins. But he
had forgotten to reckon with little King Charlie. The dog jumped
piteously upon the body of his master, licked the wound with his
tongue, and refused to allow Walter to withdraw the knife. It would
be unsafe to leave it there, for it might be recognised. 'Minimise
the adverse chances,' he muttered still; but there was no inducing
King Charlie to move. A struggle might result in getting drops of
blood upon his coat, and then, great heavens, what a terrible
awakening for Christina! 'Oh, Christina, Christina, Christina,' he
said to himself piteously, 'it is for you only that I could ever
have ventured to do this hideous thing.' The blood was still oozing
out of the narrow slit, and saturating the black coat, and Walter
Dene with his delicate nerves could hardly bear to look upon
it.</p>
<p>At last he summoned up resolution to draw out the knife from the
ugly wound, in spite of King Charlie; and as he did so, oh, horror!
the little dog jumped at it, and cut his left fore-leg against the
sharp edge deep to the bone. Here was a pretty accident indeed! If
Walter Dene had been a common heartless murderer he would have
snatched up the knife immediately, left the poor lame dog to watch
and bleed beside his dead master, and skulked off hurriedly from
the mute witness to his accomplished crime. But Walter was made of
very different mould from that; he could not find it in his heart
to leave a poor dumb animal wounded and bleeding for hours
together, alone and untended. Just at first, indeed, he tried
sophistically to persuade himself his duty to Christina demanded
that he should go away at once, and never mind the sufferings of a
mere spaniel; but his better nature told him the next moment that
such sophisms were indefensible, and his humane instincts overcame
even the profound instinct of self-preservation. He sat down
quietly beside the warm corpse. 'Thank goodness,' he said, with a
slight shiver of disgust, 'I'm not one of those weak-minded people
who are troubled by remorse. They would be so overcome by terror at
what they had done that they would want to run away from the body
immediately, at any price. But I don't think I <i>could</i> feel
remorse. It is an incident of lower natures&mdash;natures that are
capable of doing actions under one set of impulses, which they
regret when another set comes uppermost in turn. That implies a
want of balance, an imperfect co-ordination of parts and passions.
The perfect character is consistent with itself; shame and
repentance are confessions of weakness. For my part, I never do
anything without having first deliberately decided that it is the
best or the only thing to do; and having so done it, I do not draw
back like a girl from the necessary consequences of my own act. No
fluttering or running away for me. Still, I must admit that all
that blood does look very ghastly. Poor old gentleman! I believe he
really died almost without knowing it, and that is certainly a
great comfort to one under the circumstances.'</p>
<p>He took King Charlie tenderly in his hands, without touching the
wounded leg, and drew his pocket handkerchief softly from his
pocket. 'Poor beastie,' he said aloud, holding out the cut limb
before him, 'you are badly hurt, I'm afraid; but it wasn't my
fault. We must see what we can do for you.' Then he wrapped the
handkerchief deftly around it, without letting any blood show
through, pressed the dog close against his breast, and picked up
the knife gingerly by the reeking handle. 'A fool of a fellow would
throw it into the river,' he thought, with a curl of his graceful
lip. 'They always dredge the river after these incidents. I shall
just stick it down a hole in the hedge a hundred yards off. The
police have no invention, dull donkeys; they never dredge the
hedges.' And he thrust it well down a disused rabbit burrow,
filling in the top neatly with loose mould.</p>
<p>Walter Dene meant to have gone home quietly and said evensong,
leaving the discovery of the body to be made at haphazard by
others, but this unfortunate accident to King Charlie compelled him
against his will to give the first alarm. It was absolutely
necessary to take the dog to the veterinary at once, or the poor
little fellow might bleed to death incontinently. 'One's best
efforts,' he thought, 'are always liable to these unfortunate
<i>contretemps</i>. I meant merely to remove a superfluous person
from an uncongenial environment; yet I can't manage it without at
the same time seriously injuring a harmless little creature that I
really love.' And with one last glance at the lifeless thing behind
him, he took his way regretfully along the ordinary path back
towards the peaceful village of Churnside.</p>
<p>Halfway down the lane, at the entrance to the village, he met
one of his parishioners. 'Tom,' he said boldly, 'have you seen
anything of the vicar? I'm afraid he's got hurt somehow. Here's
poor little King Charlie come limping back with his leg cut.'</p>
<p>'He went down the road, zur, 'arf an hour zince, and I arn't
zeen him afterwards.'</p>
<p>'Tell the servants at the vicarage to look around the grounds,
then; I'm afraid he has fallen and hurt himself. I must take the
dog at once to Perkins's, or else I shall be late for
evensong.'</p>
<p>The man went off straight towards the vicarage, and Walter Dene
turned immediately with the dog in his arms into the village
veterinary's.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The servants from the vicarage were not the first persons to hit
upon the dead body of the vicar. Joe Harley, the poacher, was out
reconnoitring that afternoon in the vicar's preserves; and five
minutes after Walter Dene had passed down the far side of the
hedge, Joe Harley skulked noiselessly from the orchard up to the
gate of the covert by Selbury Copse. He crept through the open end
by the post (for it was against Joe's principles under any
circumstances to climb over an obstacle of any sort, and so
needlessly expose himself), and he was just going to slink off
along the other hedge, having wires and traps in his pocket, when
his boot struck violently against a soft object in the ditch
underfoot. It struck so violently that it crushed in the object
with the force of the impact; and when Joe came to look at what the
object might be, he found to his horror that it was the bruised and
livid face of the old parson. Joe had had a brush with keepers more
than once, and had spent several months of seclusion in Dorchester
Gaol; but, in spite of his familiarity with minor forms of
lawlessness, he was moved enough in all conscience by this awful
and unexpected discovery. He turned the body over clumsily with his
hands, and saw that it had been stabbed in the back once only. In
doing so he trod in a little blood, and got a drop or two on his
sleeve and trousers; for the pool was bigger now, and Joe was not
so handy or dainty with his fingers as the idyllic curate.</p>
<p>It was an awful dilemma, indeed, for a confirmed and convicted
poacher. Should he give the alarm then and there, boldly, trusting
to his innocence for vindication, and helping the police to
discover the murderer? Why, that would be sheer suicide, no doubt;
'for who but would believe,' he thought, ''twas me as done it?' Or
should he slink away quietly and say nothing, leaving others to
find the body as best they might? That was dangerous enough in its
way if anybody saw him, but not so dangerous as the other course.
In an evil hour for his own chances Joe Harley chose that worse
counsel, and slank off in his familiar crouching fashion towards
the opposite corner of the copse.</p>
<p>On the way he heard John's voice holloaing for his master, and
kept close to the hedge till he had quite turned the corner. But
John had caught a glimpse of him too, and John did not forget it
when, a few minutes later, he came upon the horrid sight beside the
gate of Selbury Copse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Walter had taken King Charlie to the veterinary's, and
had his leg bound and bandaged securely. He had also gone down to
the church, got out his surplice, and begun to put it on in the
vestry for evensong, when a messenger came at hot haste from the
vicarage, with news that Master Walter must come up at once, for
the vicar was murdered.</p>
<p>'Murdered!' Walter Dene said to himself slowly half aloud;
'murdered! how horrible! Murdered!' It was an ugly word, and he
turned it over with a genuine thrill of horror. That was what they
would say of him if ever the thing came to be discovered! What an
inappropriate classification!</p>
<p>He threw aside the surplice, and rushed up hurriedly to the
vicarage. Already the servants had brought in the body, and laid it
out in the clothes it wore, on the vicar's own bed. Walter Dene
went in, shuddering, to look at it. To his utter amazement, the
face was battered in horribly and almost unrecognisably by a blow
or kick! What could that hideous mutilation mean? He could not
imagine. It was an awful mystery. Great heavens! just fancy if any
one were to take it into his head that he, Walter Dene, had done
<i>that</i>&mdash;had kicked a defenceless old gentleman brutally
about the face like a common London ruffian! The idea was too
horrible to be borne for a moment. It unmanned him utterly, and he
hid his face between his two hands and sobbed aloud like one
broken-hearted. 'This day's work has been too much for my nerves,'
he thought to himself between the sobs; 'but perhaps it is just as
well I should give way now completely.'</p>
<p>That night was mainly taken up with the formalities of all such
cases; and when at last Walter Dene went off, tired and nerve-worn,
to bed, about midnight, he could not sleep much for thinking of the
mystery. The murder itself didn't trouble him greatly; that was
over and past now, and he felt sure his precautions had been amply
sufficient to protect him even from the barest suspicion; but he
couldn't fathom the mystery of that battered and mutilated face!
Somebody must have seen the corpse between the time of the murder
and the discovery! Who could that somebody have been? and what
possible motive could he have had for such a horrible piece of
purposeless brutality?</p>
<p>As for the servants, in solemn conclave in the hall, they had
unanimously but one theory to account for all the facts: some
poacher or other, for choice Joe Harley, had come across the vicar
in the copse, with gun and traps in hand. The wretch had seen he
was discovered, had felled the poor old vicar by a blow in the face
with the butt-end of his rifle, and after he fell, fainting, had
stabbed him for greater security in the back. That was such an
obvious solution of the difficulty, that nobody in the servants'
hall had a moment's hesitation in accepting it.</p>
<p>When Walter heard next morning early that Joe Harley had been
arrested overnight, on John's information, his horror and surprise
at the news were wholly unaffected. Here was another new
difficulty, indeed. 'When I did the thing,' he said to himself, 'I
never thought of that possibility. I took it for granted it would
be a mystery, a problem for the local police (who, of course, could
no more solve it than they could solve the <i>pons asinorum</i>),
but it never struck me they would arrest an innocent person on the
charge instead of me. This is horrible. It's so easy to make out a
case against a poacher, and hang him for it, on suspicion. One's
whole sense of justice revolts against the thing. After all,
there's a great deal to be said in favour of the ordinary
commonplace morality: it prevents complications. A man of delicate
sensibilities oughtn't to kill anybody; he lets himself in for all
kinds of unexpected contingencies, without knowing it.'</p>
<p>At the coroner's inquest things looked very black indeed for Joe
Harley. Walter gave his evidence first, showing how he had found
King Charlie wounded in the lane; and then the others gave theirs,
as to the search for and finding of the body. John in particular
swore to having seen a man's back and head slinking away by the
hedge while they were looking for the vicar; and that back and head
he felt sure were Joe Harley's. To Walter's infinite horror and
disgust, the coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful murder
against the poor poacher. What other verdict could they possibly
have given in accordance with such evidence?</p>
<p>The trial of Joe Harley for the wilful murder of the Reverend
Arthur Dene was fixed for the next Dorchester Assizes. In the
interval, Walter Dene, for the first time in his placid life, knew
what it was to undergo a mental struggle. Whatever happened, he
could not let Joe Harley be hanged for this murder. His whole soul
rose up within him in loathing for such an act of hideous
injustice. For though Walter Dene's code of morality was certainly
not the conventional one, as he so often boasted to himself, he was
not by any means without a code of morals of any sort. He could
commit a murder where he thought it necessary, but he could not let
an innocent man suffer in his stead. His ethical judgment on that
point was just as clear and categorical as the judgment which told
him he was in duty bound to murder his uncle. For Walter did not
argue with himself on moral questions: he perceived the right and
necessary thing intuitively; he was a law to himself, and he obeyed
his own law implicitly, for good or for evil. Such men are capable
of horrible and diabolically deliberate crimes; but they are
capable of great and genuine self-sacrifices also.</p>
<p>Walter made no secret in the village of his disinclination to
believe in Joe Harley's guilt. Joe was a rough fellow, he said,
certainly, and he had no objection to taking a pheasant or two, and
even to having a free fight with the keepers; but, after all, our
game-laws were an outrageous piece of class legislation, and he
could easily understand how the poor, whose sense of justice they
outraged, should be so set against them. He could not think Joe
Harley was capable of a detestable crime. Besides, he had seen him
himself within a few minutes before and after the murder. Everybody
thought it such a proof of the young parson's generous and kindly
disposition; he had certainly the charity which thinketh no evil.
Even though his own uncle had been brutally murdered on his own
estate, he checked his natural feelings of resentment, and refused
to believe that one of his own parishioners could have been guilty
of the crime. Nay, more, so anxious was he that substantial justice
should be done the accused, and so confident was he of his
innocence, that he promised to provide counsel for him at his own
expense; and he provided two of the ablest barristers on the
Western circuit.</p>
<p>Before the trial, Walter Dene had come, after a terrible
internal struggle, to an awful resolution. He would do everything
he could for Joe Harley; but if the verdict went against him, he
was resolved, then and there, in open court, to confess, before
judge and jury, the whole truth. It would be a horrible thing for
Christina; he knew that: but he could not love Christina so much,
'loved he not honour more'; and honour, after his own fashion, he
certainly loved dearly. Though he might be false to all that all
the world thought right, it was ingrained in the very fibre of his
soul to be true to his own inner nature at least. Night after night
he lay awake, tossing on his bed, and picturing to his mind's-eye
every detail of that terrible disclosure. The jury would bring in a
verdict of guilty: then, before the judge put on his black cap, he,
Walter, would stand up, and tell them that he could not let another
man hang for his crime; he would have the whole truth out before
them; and then he would die, for he would have taken a little
bottle of poison at the first sound of the verdict. As for
Christina&mdash;oh, Christina!&mdash;Walter Dene could not dare to
let himself think upon that. It was horrible; it was unendurable;
it was torture a thousand times worse than dying: but still, he
must and would face it. For in certain phases, Walter Dene, forger
and murderer as he was, could be positively heroic.</p>
<p>The day of the trial came, and Walter Dene, pale and haggard
with much vigil, walked in a dream and faintly from his hotel to
the court-house. Everybody present noticed what a deep effect the
shock of his uncle's death had had upon him. He was thinner and
more bloodless than usual, and his dulled eyes looked black and
sunken in their sockets. Indeed, he seemed to have suffered far
more intensely than the prisoner himself, who walked in firmer and
more erect, and took his seat doggedly in the familiar dock. He had
been there more than once before, to say the truth, though never
before on such an errand. Yet mere habit, when he got there, made
him at once assume the hang-dog look of the consciously guilty.</p>
<p>Walter sat and watched and listened, still in a dream, but
without once betraying in his face the real depth of his innermost
feelings. In the body of the court he saw Joe's wife, weeping
profusely and ostentatiously, after the fashion considered to be
correct by her class; and though he pitied her from the bottom of
his heart, he could only think by contrast of Christina. What were
that good woman's fears and sorrows by the side of the grief and
shame and unspeakable horror he might have to bring upon his
Christina? Pray Heaven the shock, if it came, might kill her
outright; that would at least be better than that she should live
long years to remember. More than judge, or jury, or prisoner,
Walter Dene saw everywhere, behind the visible shadows that
thronged the court, that one persistent prospective picture of
heartbroken Christina.</p>
<p>The evidence for the prosecution told with damning force against
the prisoner. He was a notorious poacher; the vicar was a
game-preserver. He had poached more than once on the ground of the
vicarage. He was shown by numerous witnesses to have had an animus
against the vicar. He had been seen, not in the face, to be sure,
but still seen and recognised, slinking away, immediately after the
fact, from the scene of the murder. And the prosecution had found
stains of blood, believed by scientific experts to be human, on the
clothing he had worn when he was arrested. Walter Dene listened now
with terrible, unabated earnestness, for he knew that in reality it
was he himself who was upon his trial. He himself, and Christina's
happiness; for if the poacher were found guilty, he was firmly
resolved, beyond hope of respite, to tell all, and face the
unspeakable.</p>
<p>The defence seemed indeed a weak and feeble theory. Somebody
unknown had committed the murder, and this somebody, seen from
behind, had been mistaken by John for Joe Harley. The blood-stains
need not be human, as the cross-examination went to show, but were
only known by counter-experts to be mammalian&mdash;perhaps a
rabbit's. Every poacher&mdash;and it was admitted that Joe was a
poacher&mdash;was liable to get his clothes blood-stained. Grant
they were human, Joe, it appeared, had himself once shot off his
little finger. All these points came out from the examination of
the earlier witnesses. At last, counsel put the curate himself into
the box, and proceeded to examine him briefly as a witness for the
defence.</p>
<p>Walter Dene stepped, pale and haggard still, into the
witness-box. He had made up his mind to make one final effort 'for
Christina's happiness.' He fumbled nervously all the time at a
small glass phial in his pocket, but he answered all questions
without a moment's hesitation, and he kept down his emotions with a
wonderful composure which excited the admiration of everybody
present. There was a general hush to hear him. Did he see the
prisoner, Joseph Harley, on the day of the murder? Yes, three
times. When was the first occasion? From the library window, just
before the vicar left the house. What was Joseph Harley then doing?
Walking in the opposite direction from the copse. Did Joseph Harley
recognise him? Yes, he touched his hat to him. When was the second
occasion? About ten minutes later, when he, Walter, was leaving the
vicarage for a stroll. Did Joseph Harley then recognise him? Yes,
he touched his hat again, and the curate said, 'Good morning, Joe;
a fine day for walking.' When was the third time? Ten minutes later
again, when he was returning from the lane, carrying wounded little
King Charlie. Would it have been physically possible for the
prisoner to go from the vicarage to the spot where the murder was
committed, and back again, in the interval between the first two
occasions? It would not. Would it have been physically possible for
the prisoner to do so in the interval between the second and third
occasions? It would not.</p>
<p>'Then in your opinion, Mr. Dene, it is physically impossible
that Joseph Harley can have committed this murder?'</p>
<p>'In my opinion, it is physically impossible.'</p>
<p>While Walter Dene solemnly swore amid dead silence to this
treble lie, he did not dare to look Joe Harley once in the face;
and while Joe Harley listened in amazement to this unexpected
assistance to his case&mdash;for counsel, suspecting a mistaken
identity, had not questioned him too closely on the
subject&mdash;he had presence of mind enough not to let his
astonishment show upon his stolid features. But when Walter had
finished his evidence in chief, he stole a glance at Joe; and for a
moment their eyes met. Then Walter's fell in utter
self-humiliation; and he said to himself fiercely, 'I would not so
have debased and degraded myself before any man to save my own
life&mdash;what is my life worth to me, after all?&mdash;but to
save Christina, to save Christina, to save Christina! I have
brought all this upon myself for Christina's sake.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joe Harley was asking himself curiously what could be
the meaning of this new move on parson's part. It was deliberate
perjury, Joe felt sure, for parson could not have mistaken another
person for him three times over; but what good end for himself
could parson hope to gain by it? If it was he who had murdered the
vicar (as Joe strongly suspected), why did he not try to press the
charge home against the first person who happened to be accused,
instead of committing a distinct perjury on purpose to compass his
acquittal? Joe Harley, with his simple everyday criminal mind,
could not be expected to unravel the intricacies of so complex a
personality as Walter Dene's. But even there, on trial for his
life, he could not help wondering what on earth young parson could
be driving at in this business.</p>
<p>The judge summed up with the usual luminously obvious alternate
platitudes. If the jury thought that John had really seen Joe
Harley, and that the curate was mistaken in the person whom he
thrice saw, or was mistaken once only out of the thrice, or had
miscalculated the time between each occurrence, or the time
necessary to cover the ground to the gate, then they would find the
prisoner guilty of wilful murder. If, on the other hand, they
believed John had judged hastily, and that the curate had really
seen the prisoner three separate times, and that he had rightly
calculated all the intervals, then they would find the prisoner not
guilty. The prisoner's case rested entirely upon the <i>alibi</i>.
Supposing they thought there was a doubt in the matter, they should
give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt. Walter noticed that the
judge said in every other case, 'If you believe the witness
So-and-so,' but that in his case he made no such discourteous
reservation. As a matter of fact, the one person whose conduct
nobody for a moment dreamt of calling in question was the real
murderer.</p>
<p>The jury retired for more than an hour. During all that time two
men stood there in mortal suspense, intent and haggard, both upon
their trial, but not both equally. The prisoner in the dock fixed
his arms in a dogged and sullen attitude, the colour half gone from
his brown cheek, and his eyes straining with excitement, but
showing no outward sign of any emotion except the craven fear of
death. Walter Dene stood almost fainting in the body of the court,
his bloodless fingers still fumbling nervously at the little phial,
and his face deadly pale with the awful pallor of a devouring
horror. His heart scarcely beat at all, but at each long slow
pulsation he could feel it throb distinctly within his bosom. He
saw or heard nothing before him, but kept his aching eyes fixed
steadily on the door by which the jury were to enter. Junior
counsel nudged one another to notice his agitation, and whispered
that that poor young curate had evidently never seen a man tried
for his life before.</p>
<p>At last the jury entered. Joe and Walter waited, each in his own
manner, breathless for the verdict. 'Do you find the prisoner at
the bar guilty or not guilty of wilful murder?' Walter took the
little phial from his pocket, and held it carefully between his
finger and thumb. The awful moment had come; the next word would
decide the fate of himself and Christina. The foreman of the jury
looked up solemnly, and answered with slow distinctness, 'Not
guilty.' The prisoner leaned back vacantly, and wiped his forehead;
but there was an awful cry of relief from one mouth in the body of
the court, and Walter Dene sank back into the arms of the
bystanders, exhausted with suspense and overcome by the reaction.
The crowd remarked among themselves that young Parson Dene was too
tender-hearted a man to come into court at a criminal trial. He
would break his heart to see even a dog hanged, let alone his
fellow-Christians. As for Joe Harley, it was universally admitted
that he had had a narrow squeak of it, and that he had got off
better than he deserved. The jury gave him the benefit of the
doubt.</p>
<p>As soon as all the persons concerned had returned to Churnside,
Walter sent at once for Joe Harley. The poacher came to see him in
the vicarage library. He was elated and coarsely exultant with his
victory, as a relief from the strain he had suffered, after the
manner of all vulgar natures.</p>
<p>'Joe,' said the clergyman slowly, motioning him into a chair at
the other side of the desk, 'I know that after this trial Churnside
will not be a pleasant place to hold you. All your neighbours
believe, in spite of the verdict, that you killed the vicar. I feel
sure, however, that you did not commit this murder. Therefore, as
some compensation for the suffering of mind to which you have been
put, I think it well to send you and your wife and family to
Australia or Canada, whichever you like best. I propose also to
make you a present of a hundred pounds, to set you up in your new
home.'</p>
<p>'Make it five hundred, passon,' Joe said, looking at him
significantly.</p>
<p>Walter smiled quietly, and did not flinch in any way. 'I said a
hundred,' he continued calmly, 'and I will make it only a hundred.
I should have had no objection to making it five, except for the
manner in which you ask it. But you evidently mistake the motive of
my gift. I give it out of pure compassion for you, and not out of
any other feeling whatsoever.'</p>
<p>'Very well, passon,' said Joe sullenly, 'I accept it.'</p>
<p>'You mistake again,' Walter went on blandly, for he was himself
again now. 'You are not to accept it as terms; you are to thank me
for it as a pure present. I see we two partially understand each
other; but it is important you should understand me exactly as I
mean it. Joe Harley, listen to me seriously. I have saved your
life. If I had been a man of a coarse and vulgar nature, if I had
been like you in a similar predicament, I would have pressed the
case against you for obvious personal reasons, and you would have
been hanged for it. But I did not press it, because I felt
convinced of your innocence, and my sense of justice rose
irresistibly against it. I did the best I could to save you; I
risked my own reputation to save you; and I have no hesitation now
in telling you that to the best of my belief, if the verdict had
gone against you, the person who really killed the vicar,
accidentally or intentionally, meant to have given himself up to
the police, rather than let an innocent man suffer.'</p>
<p>'Passon,' said Joe Harley, looking at him intently, 'I believe
as you're tellin' me the truth. I zeen as much in that person's
face afore the verdict.'</p>
<p>There was a solemn pause for a moment; and then Walter Dene said
slowly, 'Now that you have withdrawn your claim as a claim, I will
stretch a point and make it five hundred. It is little enough for
what you have suffered. But I, too, have suffered terribly,
terribly.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, passon,' Joe answered. 'I zeen as you were turble
anxious.'</p>
<p>There was again a moment's pause. Then Walter Dene asked
quietly, 'How did the vicar's face come to be so bruised and
battered?'</p>
<p>'I stumbled up agin 'im accidental like, and didn't know I'd
kicked 'un till I'd done it. Must 'a been just a few minutes after
you'd 'a left 'un.'</p>
<p>'Joe,' said the curate in his calmest tone, 'you had better go;
the money will be sent to you shortly. But if you ever see my face
again, or speak or write a word of this to me, you shall not have a
penny of it, but shall be prosecuted for intimidation. A hundred
before you leave, four hundred in Australia. Now go.'</p>
<p>'Very well, passon,' Joe answered; and he went.</p>
<p>'Pah!' said the curate with a face of disgust, shutting the door
after him, and lighting a perfumed pastille in his little Chinese
porcelain incense-burner, as if to fumigate the room from the
poacher's offensive presence. 'Pah! to think that these affairs
should compel one to humiliate and abase oneself before a vulgar
clod like that! To think that all his life long that fellow will
virtually know&mdash;and misinterpret&mdash;my secret. He is
incapable of understanding that I did it as a duty to Christina.
Well, he will never dare to tell it, that's certain, for nobody
would believe him if he did; and he may congratulate himself
heartily that he's got well out of this difficulty. It will be the
luckiest thing in the end that ever happened to him. And now I hope
this little episode is finally over.'</p>
<p>When the Churnside public learned that Walter Dene meant to
carry his belief in Joe Harley's innocence so far as to send him
and his family at his own expense out to Australia, they held that
the young parson's charity and guilelessness was really, as the
doctor said, almost Quixotic. And when, in his anxiety to detect
and punish the real murderer, he offered a reward of five hundred
pounds from his own pocket for any information leading to the
arrest and conviction of the criminal, the Churnside people laughed
quietly at his extraordinary childlike simplicity of heart. The
real murderer had been caught and tried at Dorchester Assizes, they
said, and had only got off by the skin of his teeth because Walter
himself had come forward and sworn to a quite improbable and
inconclusive <i>alibi</i>. There was plenty of time for Joe to have
got to the gate by the short cut, and that he did so everybody at
Churnside felt morally certain. Indeed, a few years later a
blood-stained bowie-knife was found in the hedge not far from the
scene of the murder, and the gamekeeper 'could almost 'a took his
Bible oath he'd zeen just such a knife along o' Joe Harley.'</p>
<p>That was not the end of Walter Dene's Quixotisms, however. When
the will was read, it turned out that almost everything was left to
the young parson; and who could deserve it better, or spend it more
charitably? But Walter, though he would not for the world seem to
cast any slight or disrespect upon his dear uncle's memory, did not
approve of customs of primogeniture, and felt bound to share the
estate equally with his brother Arthur. 'Strange,' said the head of
the firm of Watson and Blenkiron to himself, when he read the
little paragraph about this generous conduct in the paper; 'I
thought the instructions were to leave it to his nephew Arthur, not
to his nephew Walter; but there, one forgets and confuses names of
people that one does not know so easily.' 'Gracious goodness!'
thought the engrossing clerk; 'surely it was the other way on. I
wonder if I can have gone and copied the wrong names in the wrong
places?' But in a big London business, nobody notes these things as
they would have been noted in Churnside; the vicar was always a
changeable, pernickety, huffy old fellow, and very likely he had
had a reverse will drawn up afterwards by his country lawyer. All
the world only thought that Walter Dene's generosity was really
almost ridiculous, even in a parson. When he was married to
Christina, six months afterwards, everybody said so charming a girl
was well mated with so excellent and admirable a husband.</p>
<p>And he really did make a very tender and loving husband and
father. Christina believed in him always, for he did his best to
foster and keep alive her faith. He would have given up active
clerical duty if he could, never having liked it (for he was above
hypocrisy), but Christina was against the project, and his bishop
would not hear of it. The Church could ill afford to lose such a
man as Mr. Dene, the bishop said, in these troubled times; and he
begged him as a personal favour to accept the living of Churnside,
which was in his gift. But Walter did not like the place, and asked
for another living instead, which, being of less value&mdash;'so
like Mr. Dene to think nothing of the temporalities,'&mdash;the
bishop even more graciously granted. He has since published a small
volume of dainty little poems on uncut paper, considered by some
critics as rather pagan in tone for a clergyman, but universally
allowed to be extremely graceful, the perfection of poetical form
with much delicate mastery of poetical matter. And everybody knows
that the author is almost certain to be offered the first vacant
canonry in his own cathedral. As for the little episode, he himself
has almost forgotten all about it; for those who think a murderer
must feel remorse his whole life long, are trying to read their own
emotional nature into the wholly dispassionate character of Walter
Dene.</p>

<h3>CECCA'S LOVER</h3>
<p>They're a queer lot, these Italians. After twenty years spent
among them I don't yet understand them. Italy itself I
love&mdash;every artist must. I love the very dirt. I love the
squalid towns. I love the crumbling walls; I love every stone of
them. When I came to the country first, I dropped into it like one
to the manner born. I said on the mere threshold, by the slope of
the Alps, stretching out my hands to the soil of Italy, 'Ecco la
mia patria!' But the Italians!&mdash;ah, there!&mdash;that's quite
another question. I like them, understand well; I don't say a word
against them; but comprehend them?&mdash;no, no; they're at once
too simple and too complex, by far, for our Northern
intelligence.</p>
<p>There was Cecca's case, for example; what a very queer history!
You must have noticed Cecca&mdash;that black-haired, flashing-eyed
Neapolitan maid of ours, who goes out with my little ones. Have I
never told you the story about Cecca's strange courtship? Well,
well; sit down here under the shade of the stone-pine, and light
your cigarette while I tell you all about it. Be careful of your
match, though; don't throw it away lighted in the midst of the
rosemary bushes; the myrtles and lentisks on these dry hillsides
flare up like tinder; the white heath crackles and fizzes in a
second; before you know where you are, the flame runs up the
junipers and pine-trees, corkscrew-wise; and <i>hi, presto!</i> in
rather less time than it takes to say so, the forest's ablaze from
Santa Croce to the Roya.</p>
<p>It was before we settled down here at Bordighera that the thing
began; indeed, it was Cecca, indirectly speaking, that brought us
to the coast here. We were living at Naples then, or, rather, near
Castellamare. Cecca was our housemaid. Her full name's Francesca.
She's handsome still, but she was beautiful then; the prettiest
fisher-girl from Sorrento to Pozzuoli. Fanny took her from her
parents when she was twelve years old, and trained her up in the
house like an English servant. But the hot Neapolitan nature burnt
strong in her, all the same; nobody could ever tame Cecca.</p>
<p>Well, she had a lover, of course; every girl has a
lover&mdash;especially in Italy. He was a fisherman, like her own
people; for the fishermen are a caste, and no well-bred fisher-girl
ever dreams of marrying any man outside it. The fellow's name was
Giuseppe. Our children loved him. He used to bring them dried
sea-horses with long curled tails, and queer shells with wings to
them, and creepy great octopuses with staring goggle eyes, that
they loved to see and yet shrank from in terror. He was a mighty
hunter of sea-eggs and cuttle-fish. Cecca pretended not to care for
him, Neapolitan fashion&mdash;for they are a crooked folk; but we
could see very well she was madly in love with him for all that. If
we sent her on the hills to take the children for a walk, we always
found, in the end, she'd gone on the beach instead, if Giuseppe was
hauling the seine, or mending his nets, or tarring and towing the
gaping chinks in the hull of the <i>Sant' Elmo</i>.</p>
<p>One morning I was sitting under the shadow of a boat, on the
shingle by the sea, doing a little water-colour; the children were
close by, playing with stranded jelly-fish; and Cecca was there to
look after them, basking in the sun like a lizard. Presently, on
the shore, Giuseppe's boat drove in, and he hauled her up close by,
with the aid of his brown-legged mates, never noticing us so near
him. Cecca noted him stealthily, glancing askance at me to keep
silence. The young man began sorting his fish&mdash;you know the
kind of thing&mdash;strange <i>frutti di mare</i> that they make
<i>frittura</i> of. All's fish that comes to their
net&mdash;mussels, squids, or sea-spiders. As he was doing it,
another pretty fisher-girl strolled up that way, brown-skinned like
himself, and with a bright red handkerchief twisted carelessly
round that glossy black head of hers. Cecca crept closer, under
shelter of the boat, her eyes like coals of fire, and listened to
the talk of them. I heard it all, too; frank fisher-folk chaff,
with frank fisher-folk words, in the frank fisher-folk dialect. A
good part of it, don't you see, would be totally unfit for
publication in English.</p>
<p>'Hey, my Lady, what a catch!' says the girl, holding her head on
one side, and looking down at the boat-load. 'Crabs, sardines, and
sea-wolf! You've fifty lire's worth there if you've got ten soldi.
You'll be making your fortune soon, Giuseppe!'</p>
<p>Giuseppe glanced up at her as she stood there so saucy, with one
hand on her hip, and one, coquettish, by the corner of her rich red
mouth, and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>'Pretty well,' he says, opening his hands, just so, in front of
him&mdash;you know their way. 'A fair catch for the season!'</p>
<p>The girl sidled nearer. Her name was Bianca (though she was
brown as a berry), and I knew her well by sight.</p>
<p>'You'll be marrying Cecca before long,' she said. 'You'll need
it all&mdash;then! <i>She'll</i> want red shoes and silk stockings,
your Cecca will.'</p>
<p>'Who said I was going to marry Cecca?' Giuseppe answers, quite
short, out of pure contrariety. That's the Neapolitan way. Talking
to one pretty girl, in the heat of the moment, he couldn't bear she
should think he cared for another one. Your Neapolitan would like
to make love to them all at once, or rather each in turn, and
pretend to every one of them he didn't care a pin for any of the
others.</p>
<p>Well, there they fell straight into an Italian chaffing-match,
half fun, half earnest; Bianca pretending Giuseppe was head over
ears in love with Cecca, to her certain knowledge; while Giuseppe
pretended he never cared for the mincing thing at all, and was
immensely devoted to no one but Bianca. It was pure Neapolitan
devilry on his part, of course; he couldn't help saying sweet
things to whatever pretty girl with a pair of black eyes was
nearest him at the moment, and depreciating by comparison every
other she spoke of.</p>
<p>But Cecca sat hard by, her hand curved round her ear,
shell-wise, so, to listen, and her brow like thunder. I dared not
say a word lest she should rise and rush at him.</p>
<p>'And you've chosen so well, too!' says Bianca, half satirically,
don't you see? 'She's so sweet! so pretty! Such lips for a kiss!
Such fine eyes to flirt with! Not a girl on the beach with eyes
like Cecca's!'</p>
<p>'Eyes!' Giuseppe answers, coming closer and ogling her. 'You
call her eyes <i>fine</i>? Why, <i>I</i> say she squints with
them.'</p>
<p>'Not squints,' says Bianca condescendingly. 'Just a very slight
cast.'</p>
<p>And indeed, as you may have noticed, though Cecca's so handsome,
they're <i>not</i> quite straight in her head, when you come to
look hard at them.</p>
<p>'<i>You</i> may call it a cast,' Giuseppe continues, counting
over his dories; 'but <i>I</i> call it squinting. Whereas
<i>your</i> eyes, Bianca&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>Bianca pouted her lips at him.</p>
<p>'That's the way of you men,' she says, mighty pleased all the
same. 'Always flattering us to our faces; while behind our
backs&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'And then, her temper!' says Giuseppe.</p>
<p>'Well, she <i>has</i> a temper, I admit,' Bianca goes on with
angelic candour. And so for twenty minutes such a game between
them, pulling poor Cecca to pieces, turn about, till, morally and
physically, she hadn't the ghost of a leg left to stand upon.</p>
<p>But Cecca! you should have seen her meanwhile. There she sat,
under the boat, drinking in every word, herself unseen, with the
eye and the face of a tigress just ready to spring, straining
forward to listen. It was awful to look at her; she seemed one
whirlwind of suppressed passion. Little fists clenched hard, neck
stretched out to the utmost, frowning brow, puckered eyes, nostrils
wide and quivering. I'd have given anything to paint her as she sat
there that minute. I tried it from memory afterwards&mdash;you
remember the piece, my 'Italian Idyll,' in the '84 Academy.</p>
<p>By and by she rose and faced them. Then came the tug of war. If
it was tragedy to see Cecca with her heart on fire, like the
pinewoods in summer, it was comedy to see those two disappear into
their shoes when Cecca fronted them. The Three Furies were nothing
to it. Bianca dodged and vanished. Giuseppe stood sheepish, jaw
dropped and eye staring, anxious at first to find out whether she'd
heard them or not; then pretending he'd known all the time she was
there, and just did it to tease her; lastly, throwing himself on
her mercy, and setting it all down, as was really the case, to the
time-pleasing, fickle Neapolitan temperament that was common to
both of them. 'You'd have done it yourself, Cecca,' he said, 'with
any other man, you know, if he'd begun to chaff you about your
fellow, Giuseppe.'</p>
<p>Cecca knew she would in her heart, I dare say, but she wouldn't
acknowledge it; having <i>heard</i> it all, you see, made all the
difference. It's the way of men, Giuseppe told her, craning eagerly
forward, to disparage even the girl they love best, when they want
to make themselves momentarily agreeable to another one. It's the
way of men, all the world over, I'm afraid; but, as far as I've
observed, the woman they love never lets them off one penny the
easier on account of its universality.</p>
<p>Well, they parted bad friends; Giuseppe went off in a huff, and
Cecca, proud and cold, with the mien of a duchess, stalked home by
the children's side in silence. For a day or two we heard nothing
more at all about the matter. Giuseppe didn't come round in the
evenings, as usual, to the villa gate; and Cecca's eyes in the
morning were red with crying. Not that she minded a bit, she told
Fanny, with a toss of her pretty head; for her own part, indeed,
she was rather glad than otherwise it was off altogether, for
Giuseppe, she always knew, wasn't half good enough for her. In a
moment of weakness she had encouraged his suit&mdash;a mere common
fisherman's, when the head waiter at the Victoria, that
distinguished-looking gentleman in a swallow-tail coat and a
spotless white tie, was dying of love for her. For Cecca had been
raised one degree in the social scale by taking service in a
foreign family, and, whenever she wanted to give herself airs, used
to pretend that nowadays she looked down upon mere fishermen.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week, however, old Catarina, our cook,
brought in evil tidings. She had no business to tell it, of course,
but, being a Neapolitan, she told it on purpose, in order to stir
up a little domestic tragedy between Cecca and her lover. Giuseppe
was paying his court to Bianca! They had been seen walking out in
the evening together! He had given her a lace scarf, and it was
even said&mdash;and so forth, and so forth! Well, <i>we</i> knew
very well, Fanny and I, what Giuseppe was driving at. He only
wanted to make Cecca as jealous as an owl, and so bring her back to
him. I don't pretend to understand Italians, as I told you; but
this much I know, that they always go to work the crooked way, if
they can, to attain their ends, by a sort of racial instinct. So I
wasn't astonished when Catarina told us this. But Cecca&mdash;she
was furious. She went straight out of the house like a wild cat on
the prowl, and crept along the shore in the direction of
Naples.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock she came back. I never saw her look so proud or
so beautiful before. There was a disdainful smile upon her thin
curled lips. Her eyes were terrible. She had a knife in her hand.
'Well, I've done it!' she cried to Fanny, flinging the knife on the
ground, so that it stuck by its point in the floor and quivered.
'I've done it at last! I've finished the thing! I've stabbed
him!'</p>
<p>Fanny was so aghast she hardly knew what to do. 'Not Giuseppe!'
she cried, all horror-struck. 'Oh, Cecca, don't say so.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I do say so,' says Cecca, flinging herself down in a
chair. And with that, what does she do but bury her face in her
hands, and rock herself up and down, like a creature distraught,
and burst into floods of tears, and moan through her sobs, 'Oh, I
loved him so! I loved him!'</p>
<p>Queer sort of way of showing you love a man, to go sticking a
knife into him! but that's the manner of these Italians. Fanny and
I had got used to them, you see, so we didn't make much of it.
Fanny tried to comfort the poor child, for we were really fond of
her. 'Perhaps he won't die,' she said, bending over her; 'you
mayn't have stabbed him badly.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, he will,' Cecca sobbed out, her eyes flashing fire.
'He'll die, I'm sure of it. I drove the knife home well, so that he
shouldn't recover and let that nasty Bianca have him.'</p>
<p>'Go out and see about it, Tom,' says my wife, turning round to
me, quite frightened; 'for if Giuseppe dies of it, then, of course,
it'll be murder.'</p>
<p>Well, out I went, and soon heard all the news from the people at
the corner. Giuseppe had been found, lying stabbed upon the road,
and been carried at once to the civic hospital. Nobody seemed to
think very much of the stabbing; some woman, no doubt, or else a
quarrel about a woman with some fisherman of his acquaintance. But
they considered it very probable Giuseppe would die. He was stabbed
twice badly in two dangerous places.</p>
<p>There was no time to be lost. Fanny and I made up our minds at
once. We were Italianate enough ourselves to think a great deal
less of the crime than of poor Cecca's danger. You know the
proverb, <i>Inglese Italianato è diavolo incarnato</i>. I hope it's
not <i>quite</i> true, but, at any rate, Fanny's Italianate, and
she was determined poor Cecca's head shouldn't fall off her neck if
<i>she</i> could prevent it. Fanny had always a conscientious
objection to the guillotine. So we saw at a glance Cecca must
disappear&mdash;disappear mysteriously. Before she began to be
suspected she must be smuggled out of the way, of course without
our seeming to know anything about it.</p>
<p>No sooner thought than done. 'Twas the moment for action. We
called up Cecca, and held a council of war over her. Just at first
the poor child absolutely refused to leave Naples on any account
while Giuseppe was in such danger; why, he might die, she said, any
moment&mdash;crying over him, you must know, as if it was somebody
else, not herself, who had stabbed him. That dear man might
die&mdash;the blessed Madonna save him!&mdash;and she not there to
comfort him in his last hour, or to burn a candle for the repose of
his soul after he'd gone to purgatory. No, not till Giuseppe was
healed or dead: she should stop at Castellamare!</p>
<p>But after a time Fanny talked her over. Fanny's so rational.
Everything would be done at the hospital for Giuseppe, she said;
and, supposing he died, why, we'd promise to waste our substance
riotously in hiring a reckless profusion of priests to sing masses
for his soul, if only Cecca'd take our advice and save herself. The
end of it all was, Cecca consented at last. She even volunteered a
suggestion on her own account. There was a Bordighera
coasting-vessel in the port that night, she said, whose skipper,
Paolo Bolognini, was a very good man and a friend of her father's.
The vessel was bound out to-morrow morning for Bordighera direct,
with a cargo of white Capri and country figs. If Cecca could only
go on board to-night, disguised as a boy, she might get clear away
beyond sea undetected. She seemed to think, poor soul, that if that
once happened there could be no more question of arresting her at
all; she was too childish to be aware that the law of Italy runs
even as far from her native Naples as this unknown coast here.</p>
<p>Well, it's no use being seriously angry and taking the high
moral standpoint with a naughty girl like that. You might as well
preach the Decalogue at a three-year-old baby. So we cut all
Cecca's hair short&mdash;she cried over its loss quite as bitterly
at the time as she had cried over Giuseppe&mdash;and we dressed her
up in a suit of her brother's clothes; and a very pretty fisher-boy
she made, after all, with a red cap on her head and a crimson sash
round her waist for girdle. She laughed for three good minutes when
she saw herself in the glass. Then we started her off, alone, for
the Bordighera sloop, along the dim, dark shore, while Fanny and I
stole after, at a discreet distance, to observe what happened.</p>
<p>At the very last moment, to be sure, Fanny had qualms of
conscience about letting a pretty girl like Cecca go alone on board
a ship among all those noisy Italian sailors. The British matron
within her still wondered whether the girl ought to be allowed to
go off without a chaperon. But I soon put a stopper on all
that&mdash;revolutions and rosewater&mdash;you can't stick at
trifles when you're escaping from an impending charge of murder;
and besides, Cecca could take care of herself (<i>with</i> a knife,
if necessary) among a hundred sailors. A boatman of our
acquaintance rowed her out to the sloop, which was anchored in the
bay. She went on board at once, and signified to us, by a
preconcerted signal with a light, that she was well received and
would be taken to Bordighera.</p>
<p>As soon as she was gone we expected every hour the police would
come up and make full inquiries. If they did come (having lost all
moral sense by this time), I was prepared to aid them in searching
the house through, with the most innocent face, for that missing
Cecca. But they never came at all. We learned why afterwards.
Giuseppe had been staunch; true as steel to the girl. In his bed at
the hospital, half dead with the wound, he never said for a moment
it was Cecca who had done it. That was partly his pride, I believe;
he didn't like to confess he'd been stabbed by a woman; and partly
his desire to avenge himself personally. He even concocted a
cock-and-bull story about a mysterious-looking fellow in a
brigand-like cloak and a slouch hat who attacked him unawares on
the high road, without the slightest provocation. The police didn't
believe <i>that</i>, of course, but they never suspected Cecca.
They set it down to a quarrel with some other man over a girl, and
thought he refused out of motives of honour to betray his
opponent.</p>
<p>For a week the poor fellow hovered between life and death. We
waited eagerly for news of him, which old Catarina brought us. Of
course we were afraid to inquire ourselves, lest suspicion should
fall upon us; but Fanny had promised Cecca that a letter should be
awaiting her when she reached Bordighera with a full, true, and
particular account of how the patient was progressing. The letter
contained a couple of hundred francs as well; for Fanny was wild
about that girl, and really talked as if stabbing one's lover was
the most natural thing in the world&mdash;an accident that might
happen to any lady any day. That's the sort of feeling that comes
of living too long at a stretch in Italy.</p>
<p>By and by, to everybody's immense astonishment, in spite of his
wounds, Giuseppe began to mend. It was really quite a miracle. If
you doubt it you can look at the <i>ex voto</i> in the chapel on
the hill over yonder, where you may see Giuseppe with a dagger
through his heart, and a very wooden Madonna with a simpering smile
descending in a halo of golden light, from most material clouds, to
pluck the thing out for him. He prayed hard that he might
live&mdash;to stick a knife into Cecca&mdash;and our Lady heard
him. At any rate, miracle or no miracle, the man recovered.
Meanwhile, we had heard from Cecca of her safe arrival at
Bordighera. But that was not all; the girl was foolish enough to
write to her people as well; who confided the fact to their dearest
friend; who told it under the utmost pledge of secrecy to a dozen
of her cronies; who retailed it to the marketwomen; who noised it
abroad with similar precautions to all Castellamare. In a week it
was known to all and sundry (except the police) that Giuseppe had
really been stabbed by Cecca, who had fled for her life to a place
beyond sea called Bordighera.</p>
<p>Presently old Catarina brought us worse news still. Giuseppe was
up and out, breathing forth fire and slaughter against the girl who
stabbed him. He meant to follow her to the world's end, he said,
and return blow for blow, exact vengeance for vengeance. The next
thing we heard was that he had sailed in a ship bound for Genoa
direct, and we doubted not he knew now Cecca was at Bordighera.</p>
<p>Well, nothing would satisfy poor Fanny after that but off we
must all pack, bag and baggage, to the north, to look after Cecca.
Not that she put it on that ground, of course; British matronhood
forbid! It was getting too hot for the neighbourhood of Naples, she
said, and time for our annual <i>villeggiatura</i> in the
mountains. We could take Bordighera on the way to the Lakes, and
carry Cecca with us to Lugano or Cadenabbia. For now that Giuseppe
hadn't died after all, there was no murder in the case, and we
might proceed more openly.</p>
<p>So off we started, children, nursemaid, and all, and came round
here by rail, post haste to Bordighera. We settled in for a few
days at the Belvedere while we looked about us. Fanny hunted up
Cecca at once in her lodgings in the town, and took her back as
head nurse. 'How do you know,' I said, 'she won't stick a knife one
day into one of the children?' But Fanny treated my remark with
deserved contempt, and observed with asperity that we men had no
feeling. Italianate, you see! completely Italianate!</p>
<p>We hadn't been in Bordighera but a week and day, as the old song
says, and I was walking along the Strada Romana one morning,
looking out on the blue sea through the branches of the olives,
when who should I perceive coming gaily towards me but my friend
Giuseppe. He had a red sash round his waist, with a knife stuck in
it ostentatiously. He was fingering the haft as he went. When he
saw me he smiled and showed all his white teeth. But 'twas an ugly
smile; I didn't like the look of it.</p>
<p>'Buon giorno, Giuseppe,' says I, trying to look unconcerned, as
if I'd expected to meet him. 'Glad to see you so well again.'</p>
<p>'Buon giorno, signore,' he answered in his politest tone. Then
he tapped his knife gaily: 'I've come to look for Cecca!'</p>
<p>I hurried home in hot haste, as fast as my legs would carry me.
At the Belvedere I saw Fanny sitting out sunning herself near the
stunted palm-tree in the front garden.</p>
<p>'Fanny, Fanny,' I cried, 'where's Cecca? Keep her out of the
way, for Heaven's sake! Here's Giuseppe at Bordighera, with a knife
at his side, going about like a roaring lion to devour her.'</p>
<p>Fanny clapped her hands to her ears.</p>
<p>'Oh, Tom,' she cried, 'what shall we do? She's down on the beach
somewhere, playing with the children.'</p>
<p>Of course this was serious. If Giuseppe came upon her unwarned,
I didn't doubt for a moment he'd carry out in real earnest his
threat of stabbing her. So off I sent the porter to find her, if
possible, and set her on her guard, telling him to bring her home,
if he could, by the back way over the hillside. Then Fanny and I
sat out, under the Japanese medlar on the terrace, where we could
command a good view of the road either way, and watch if the girl
was coming. Meanwhile, Giuseppe kept prowling under the olives on
the plain, and bandying chaff now and again with the Bordighera
cabmen.</p>
<p>Presently, to our horror, Cecca hove suddenly in sight, round
the corner by the Angst, with the children beside her. She was
carrying a great bunch of anemones and asphodel. Evidently the
porter had failed to warn and find her. My heart stood still within
me with suspense. I rushed to the edge of the terrace. But quicker
than I could rush, Cecca had seen Giuseppe, and Giuseppe Cecca.
With a wild cry of joy, she flung down the flowers and darted upon
him like a maniac. She threw her arms around him in a transport of
delight. She covered him with kisses. I never saw a woman give any
man such a welcome. One would think they were lovers on the eve of
marriage. And not three weeks before, mind you, she had tried her
level best with a knife in his breast to murder him at Naples!</p>
<p>'Giuseppe!' she cried, 'Giuseppe! Oh, carissimo! How I love
you!'</p>
<p>Giuseppe shook her off and glared at her angrily. He drew the
dagger from his belt, and held it, irresolute, in his hand for a
moment.</p>
<p>But Cecca laughed when she saw it. She laughed a merry laugh of
amusement and astonishment. 'No, no, caro mio,' she cried, seizing
his arm, quite unconcerned, with her pretty fingers. 'Not now, when
I rejoice to see you again, my own, are you going to stab me!' She
wrenched the knife from his grasp and flung it, all glittering, far
away among the olive groves. It gleamed in the air and fell.
Giuseppe watched her do it, and followed its flight with his eyes.
Then he stood there, sheepish. He didn't know what to do next. He
just stared and looked glum, in spite of all her endearments.</p>
<p>Cecca was more than a match for him, however. It was a picture
to see her. She began with her blandishments, making such heartfelt
love to him that no man in England, let alone in Italy, could
possibly have resisted her. In just about two minutes by the watch
he gave way. 'But what did you stab me for, little one?' he asked
rather sullenly.</p>
<p>Cecca stood back a pace and looked at him in amazement. She
surveyed him from head to foot like some strange wild animal. 'What
did I stab you for!' she repeated. 'And he asks me that! Oh,
Giuseppe, because I loved you! I loved you! I loved you! I loved
you so much I couldn't bear you out of my sight. And you to go and
walk with that Thing Bianca!'</p>
<p>'I won't do it again,' Giuseppe answered, all penitence.</p>
<p>Cecca fell upon him once more, kisses, tears, and tenderness.
'Oh, Giuseppe,' she cried, 'you can't think what I've suffered all
these days without you! I was longing for you to come. I was
praying to our Lady every hour of the night; and, now you're here,
that horrid Bianca shall never again get hold of you.'</p>
<p>We left them alone for half an hour, with half a flask of
Chianti to compose their minds upon. At the end of that time Cecca
came back to us smiling, and Giuseppe, looking more sheepish than
ever, beside her.</p>
<p>'Well, signora,' she said, overjoyed, 'it's all arranged now. As
soon as we can get the announcement published, Giuseppe and I are
going to get married.'</p>
<p>That settled our fate. Willy-nilly, we were tied to Bordighera.
Cecca declared she would never go back to Naples again, to let that
horrid Bianca practise her wiles and her evil eye on Giuseppe.
Fanny declared she could never get on without Cecca for the
children. Giuseppe declared he would never leave us. I shrugged my
shoulders. The upshot of it all was that we took our present villa,
on the slope of the Cima, and Giuseppe forswore the sea, turned
gardener on the spot, and married Cecca. Married her, fair and
square, at church, and before the Sindaco. He lives in our cottage.
That's him you see down yonder there, uncovering the artichokes.
And now I daresay you'll perceive what I mean when I say I never
<i>can</i> understand these Italians.</p>
<p>But the worst of it is, they make us in the end almost as bad as
they are. Have another cigarette? And be careful with your match,
please.</p>

<h3>THE BACKSLIDER</h3>
<p>There was much stir and commotion on the night of Thursday,
January the 14th, 1874, in the Gideonite Apostolic Church, number
47, Walworth Lane, Peckham, S.E. Anybody could see at a glance that
some important business was under consideration; for the Apostle
was there himself, in his chair of presidency, and the twelve
Episcops were there, and the forty-eight Presbyters, and a large
and earnest gathering of the Gideonite laity. It was only a small
bare schoolroom, fitted with wooden benches, was that headquarters
station of the young Church; but you could not look around it once
without seeing that its occupants were of the sort by whom great
religious revolutions may be made or marred. For the Gideonites
were one of those strange enthusiastic hole-and-corner sects that
spring up naturally in the outlying suburbs of great thinking
centres. They gather around the marked personality of some one
ardent, vigorous, half-educated visionary; and they consist for the
most part of intelligent, half-reasoning people, who are bold
enough to cast overboard the dogmatic beliefs of their fathers, but
not so bold as to exercise their logical faculty upon the
fundamental basis on which the dogmas originally rested. The
Gideonites had thus collected around the fixed centre of their
Apostle, a retired attorney, Murgess by name, whose teaching
commended itself to their groping reason as the pure outcome of
faithful Biblical research; and they had chosen their name because,
though they were but three hundred in number, they had full
confidence that when the time came they would blow their trumpets,
and all the host of Midian would be scattered before them. In fact,
they divided the world generally into Gideonite and Midianite, for
they knew that he that was not with them was against them. And no
wonder, for the people of Peckham did not love the struggling
Church. Its chief doctrine was one of absolute celibacy, like the
Shakers of America; and to this doctrine the Church had testified
in the Old Kent Road and elsewhere after a vigorous practical
fashion that roused the spirit of South-eastern London into the
fiercest opposition. The young men and maidens, said the Apostle,
must no longer marry or be given in marriage; the wives and
husbands must dwell asunder; and the earth must be made as an image
of heaven. These were heterodox opinions, indeed, which
South-eastern London could only receive with a strenuous
counterblast of orthodox brickbats and sound Anglican road
metal.</p>
<p>The fleece of wool was duly laid upon the floor; the trumpet and
the lamp were placed upon the bare wooden reading-desk; and the
Apostle, rising slowly from his seat, began to address the
assembled Gideonites.</p>
<p>'Friends,' he said, in a low, clear, impressive voice, with a
musical ring tempering its slow distinctness, 'we have met together
to-night to take counsel with one another upon a high matter. It is
plain to all of us that the work of the Church in the world does
not prosper as it might prosper were the charge of it in worthier
hands. We have to contend against great difficulties. We are not
among the rich or the mighty of the earth; and the poor whom we
have always with us do not listen to us. It is expedient,
therefore, that we should set some one among us aside to be
instructed thoroughly in those things that are most commonly taught
among the Midianites at Oxford or Cambridge. To some of you it may
seem, as it seemed at first to me, that such a course would involve
going back upon the very principles of our constitution. We are not
to overcome Midian by our own hand, nor by the strength of two and
thirty thousand, but by the trumpet, and the pitcher, and the cake
of barley bread. Yet, when I searched and inquired after this
matter, it seemed to me that we might also err by overmuch
confidence on the other side. For Moses, who led the people out of
Egypt, was made ready for the task by being learned in all the
learning of the Egyptians. Daniel, who testified in the captivity,
was cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and instructed
in the wisdom and tongue of the Chaldeans. Paul, who was the
apostle of the Gentiles, had not only sat at the feet of Gamaliel,
but was also able from their own poets and philosophers to confute
the sophisms and subtleties of the Grecians themselves. These
things show us that we should not too lightly despise even worldly
learning and worldly science. Perhaps we have gone wrong in
thinking too little of such dross, and being puffed up with
spiritual pride. The world might listen to us more readily if we
had one who could speak the word for us in the tongues understanded
of the world.'</p>
<p>As he paused, a hum of acquiescence went round the room.</p>
<p>'It has seemed to me, then,' the Apostle went on, 'that we ought
to choose some one among our younger brethren, upon whose shoulders
the cares and duties of the Apostolate might hereafter fall. We are
a poor people, but by subscription among ourselves we might raise a
sufficient sum to send the chosen person first to a good school
here in London, and afterwards to the University of Oxford. It may
seem a doubtful and a hazardous thing thus to stake our future upon
any one young man; but then we must remember that the choice will
not be wholly or even mainly ours; we will be guided and directed
as we ever are in the laying on of hands. To me, considering this
matter thus, it has seemed that there is one youth in our body who
is specially pointed out for this work. Only one child has ever
been born into the Church: he, as you know, is the son of brother
John Owen and sister Margaret Owen, who were received into the fold
just six days before his birth. Paul Owen's very name seems to many
of us, who take nothing for chance but all things for divinely
ordered, to mark him out at once as a foreordained Apostle. Is it
your wish, then, Presbyter John Owen, to dedicate your only son to
this ministry?'</p>
<p>Presbyter John Owen rose from the row of seats assigned to the
forty-eight, and moved hesitatingly towards the platform. He was an
intelligent-looking, honest-faced, sunburnt working man, a mason by
trade, who had come into the Church from the Baptist society; and
he was awkwardly dressed in his Sunday clothes, with the scrupulous
clumsy neatness of a respectable artisan who expects to take part
in an important ceremony. He spoke nervously and with hesitation,
but with all the transparent earnestness of a simple, enthusiastic
nature.</p>
<p>'Apostle and friends,' he said, 'it ain't very easy for me to
disentangle my feelins on this subjec' from one another. I hope I
ain't moved by any worldly feelin', an' yet I hardly know how to
keep such considerations out, for there's no denyin' that it would
be a great pleasure to me and to his mother to see our Paul
becomin' a teacher in Israel, and receivin' an education such as
you, Apostle, has pinted out. But we hope, too, we ain't insensible
to the good of the Church and the advantage that it might derive
from our Paul's support and preachin'. We can't help seein'
ourselves that the lad has got abilities; and we've tried to train
him up from his youth upward, like Timothy, for the furtherance of
the right doctrine. If the Church thinks he's fit for the work laid
upon him, his mother and me'll be glad to dedicate him to the
service.'</p>
<p>He sat down awkwardly, and the Church again hummed its
approbation in a suppressed murmur. The Apostle rose once more, and
briefly called on Paul Owen to stand forward.</p>
<p>In answer to the call, a tall, handsome, earnest-eyed boy
advanced timidly to the platform. It was no wonder that those
enthusiastic Gideonite visionaries should have seen in his face the
visible stamp of the Apostleship. Paul Owen had a rich crop of
dark-brown glossy and curly hair, cut something after the
Florentine Cinque-cento fashion&mdash;not because his parents
wished him to look artistic, but because that was the way in which
they had seen the hair dressed in all the sacred pictures that they
knew; and Margaret Owen, the daughter of some Wesleyan Spitalfields
weaver folk, with the imaginative Huguenot blood still strong in
her veins, had made up her mind ever since she became Convinced of
the Truth (as their phrase ran) that her Paul was called from his
cradle to a great work. His features were delicately chiselled, and
showed rather natural culture, like his mother's, than rough
honesty, like John Owen's, or strong individuality, like the
masterful Apostle's. His eyes were peculiarly deep and luminous,
with a far-away look which might have reminded an artist of the
central boyish figure in Holman Hunt's picture of the Doctors in
the Temple. And yet Paul Owen had a healthy colour in his cheek and
a general sturdiness of limb and muscle which showed that he was
none of your nervous, bloodless, sickly idealists, but a wholesome
English peasant-boy of native refinement and delicate
sensibilities. He moved forward with some natural hesitation before
the eyes of so many people&mdash;ay, and what was more terrible, of
the entire Church upon earth; but he was not awkward and
constrained in his action like his father. One could see that he
was sustained in the prominent part he took that morning by the
consciousness of a duty he had to perform and a mission laid upon
him which he must not reject.</p>
<p>'Are you willing, my son Paul,' asked the Apostle, gravely, 'to
take upon yourself the task that the Church proposes?'</p>
<p>'I am willing,' answered the boy in a low voice, 'grace
preventing me.'</p>
<p>'Does all the Church unanimously approve the election of our
brother Paul to this office?' the Apostle asked formally; for it
was a rule with the Gideonites that nothing should be done except
by the unanimous and spontaneous action of the whole body, acting
under direct and immediate inspiration; and all important matters
were accordingly arranged beforehand by the Apostle in private
interviews with every member of the Church individually, so that
everything that took place in public assembly had the appearance of
being wholly unquestioned. They took counsel first with one
another, and consulted the Scripture together; and when all private
doubts were satisfied, they met as a Church to ratify in solemn
conclave their separate conclusions. It was not often that the
Apostle did not have his own way. Not only had he the most marked
personality and the strongest will, but he alone also had Greek and
Hebrew enough to appeal always to the original word; and that
mysterious amount of learning, slight as it really was, sufficed
almost invariably to settle the scruples of his wholly ignorant and
pliant disciples. Reverence for the literal Scripture in its
primitive language was the corner-stone of the Gideonite Church;
and for all practical purposes, its one depositary and exponent for
them was the Apostle himself. Even the Rev. Albert Barnes's
Commentary was held to possess an inferior authority.</p>
<p>'The Church approves,' was the unanimous answer.</p>
<p>'Then, Episcops, Presbyters, and brethren,' said the Apostle,
taking up a roll of names, 'I have to ask that you will each mark
down on this paper opposite your own names how much a year you can
spare of your substance for six years to come, as a guarantee fund
for this great work. You must remember that the ministry of this
Church has cost you nothing; freely I have received and freely
given; do you now bear your part in equipping a new aspirant for
the succession to the Apostolate.'</p>
<p>The two senior Episcops took two rolls from his hand, and went
round the benches with a stylographic pen (so strangely do the ages
mingle&mdash;Apostles and stylographs) silently asking each to put
down his voluntary subscription. Meanwhile the Apostle read slowly
and reverently a few appropriate sentences of Scripture. Some of
the richer members&mdash;well-to-do small tradesmen of
Peckham&mdash;put down a pound or even two pounds apiece; the
poorer brethren wrote themselves down for ten shillings or even
five. In the end the guarantee list amounted to £195 a year. The
Apostle reckoned it up rapidly to himself, and then announced the
result to the assembly, with a gentle smile relaxing his austere
countenance. He was well pleased, for the sum was quite sufficient
to keep Paul Owen two years at school in London, and then send him
comfortably if not splendidly to Oxford. The boy had already had a
fair education in Latin and some Greek, at the Birkbeck Schools;
and with two years' further study he might even gain a scholarship
(for he was a bright lad), which would materially lessen the
expense to the young Church. Unlike many prophets and enthusiasts,
the Apostle was a good man of business; and he had taken pains to
learn all about these favourable chances before embarking his
people on so doubtful a speculation.</p>
<p>The Assembly was just about to close, when one of the Presbyters
rose unexpectedly to put a question which, contrary to the usual
practice, had not already been submitted for approbation to the
Apostle. He was a hard-headed, thickset, vulgar-looking man, a
greengrocer at Denmark Hill, and the Apostle always looked upon him
as a thorn in his side, promoted by inscrutable wisdom to the
Presbytery for the special purpose of keeping down the Apostle's
spiritual pride.</p>
<p>'One more pint, Apostle,' he said abruptly, 'afore we close. It
seems to me that even in the Church's work we'd ought to be
business-like. Now, it ain't business-like to let this young man,
Brother Paul, get his eddication out of us, if I may so speak afore
the Church, on spec. It's all very well our sayin' he's to be
eddicated and take on the Apostleship, but how do we know but what
when he's had his eddication he may fall away and become a
backslider, like Demas, and like others among ourselves that we
could mention? He may go to Oxford among a lot of Midianites, and
them of the great an' mighty of the earth too, and how do we know
but what he may round upon the Church, and go back upon us after
we've paid for his eddication? So what I want to ask is just this,
can't we bind him down in a bond that if he don't take the
Apostleship with the consent of the Church when it falls vacant,
he'll pay us back our money, so as we can eddicate up another as'll
be more worthy?'</p>
<p>The Apostle moved uneasily in his chair; but before he could
speak, Paul Owen's indignation found voice, and he said out his say
boldly before the whole assembly, blushing crimson with mingled
shame and excitement as he did so. 'If Brother Grimshaw and all the
brethren think so ill of me that they cannot trust my honesty and
honour,' he said, 'they need not be at the pains of educating me. I
will sign no bond and enter into no compact. But if you suppose
that I will be a backslider, you do not know me, and I will confer
no more with you upon the subject.'</p>
<p>'My son Paul is right,' the Apostle said, flushing up in turn at
the boy's audacity; 'we will not make the affairs of the Spirit a
matter for bonds and earthly arrangements. If the Church thinks as
I do, you will all rise up.'</p>
<p>All rose except Presbyter Grimshaw. For a moment there was some
hesitation, for the rule of the Church in favour of unanimity was
absolute; but the Apostle fixed his piercing eyes on Job Grimshaw,
and after a minute or so Job Grimshaw too rose slowly, like one
compelled by an unseen power, and cast in his vote grudgingly with
the rest. There was nothing more said about signing an
agreement.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Meenie Bolton had counted a great deal upon her visit to Oxford,
and she found it quite as delightful as she had anticipated. Her
brother knew such a nice set of men, especially Mr. Owen, of Christ
Church. Meenie had never been so near falling in love with anybody
in her life as she was with Paul Owen. He was so handsome and so
clever, and then there was something so romantic about this strange
Church they said he belonged to. Meenie's father was a country
parson, and the way in which Paul shrank from talking about the
Rector, as if his office were something wicked or uncanny, piqued
and amused her. There was a heretical tinge about him which made
him doubly interesting to the Rector's daughter. The afternoon
water party that eventful Thursday, down to Nuneham, she looked
forward to with the deepest interest. For her aunt, the Professor's
wife, who was to take charge of them, was certainly the most
delightful and most sensible of chaperons.</p>
<p>'Is it really true, Mr. Owen,' she said, as they sat together
for ten minutes alone after their picnic luncheon, by the side of
the weir under the shadow of the Nuneham beeches&mdash;'is it
really true that this Church of yours doesn't allow people to
marry?'</p>
<p>Paul coloured up to his eyes as he answered, 'Well, Miss Bolton,
I don't know that you should identify me too absolutely with my
Church. I was very young when they selected me to go to Oxford, and
my opinions have decidedly wavered a good deal lately. But the
Church certainly does forbid marriage. I have always been brought
up to look upon it as sinful.'</p>
<p>Meenie laughed aloud; and Paul, to whom the question was no
laughing matter, but a serious point of conscientious scruple,
could hardly help laughing with her, so infectious was that
pleasant ripple. He checked himself with an effort, and tried to
look serious. 'Do you know,' he said, 'when I first came to Christ
Church, I doubted even whether I ought to make your brother's
acquaintance because he was a clergyman's son. I was taught to
describe clergymen always as priests of Midian.' He never talked
about his Church to anybody at Oxford, and it was a sort of relief
to him to speak on the subject to Meenie, in spite of her laughing
eyes and undisguised amusement. The other men would have laughed at
him too, but their laughter would have been less sympathetic.</p>
<p>'And do you think them priests of Midian still?' asked
Meenie.</p>
<p>'Miss Bolton,' said Paul suddenly, as one who relieves his
overburdened mind by a great effort, 'I am almost moved to make a
confidante of you.'</p>
<p>'There is nothing I love better than confidences,' Meenie
answered; and she might truthfully have added, 'particularly from
you.'</p>
<p>'Well, I have been passing lately through a great many doubts
and difficulties. I was brought up by my Church to become its next
Apostle, and I have been educated at their expense both in London
and here. You know,' Paul added with his innate love of telling out
the whole truth, 'I am not a gentleman; I am the son of poor
working people in London.'</p>
<p>'Tom told me who your parents were,' Meenie answered simply;
'but he told me, too, you were none the less a true gentleman born
for that; and I see myself he told me right.'</p>
<p>Paul flushed again&mdash;he had a most unmanly trick of flushing
up&mdash;and bowed a little timid bow 'Thank you,' he said quietly.
'Well, while I was in London I lived entirely among my own people,
and never heard anything talked about except our own doctrines. I
thought our Apostle the most learned, the wisest, and the greatest
of men. I had not a doubt about the absolute infallibility of our
own opinions. But ever since I came to Oxford I have slowly begun
to hesitate and to falter. When I came up first, the men laughed at
me a good deal in a good-humoured way, because I wouldn't do as
they did. Then I thought myself persecuted for the truth's sake,
and was glad. But the men were really very kind and forbearing to
me; they never argued with me or bullied me; they respected my
scruples, and said nothing more about it as soon as they found out
what they really were. That was my first stumbling-block. If they
had fought me and debated with me, I might have stuck to my own
opinions by force of opposition. But they turned me in upon myself
completely by their silence, and mastered me by their kindly
forbearance. Point by point I began to give in, till now I hardly
know where I am standing.'</p>
<p>'You wouldn't join the cricket club at first, Tom says.'</p>
<p>'No, I wouldn't. I thought it wrong to walk in the ways of
Midian. But gradually I began to argue myself out of my scruples,
and now I positively pull six in the boat, and wear a Christ Church
ribbon on my hat. I have given up protesting against having my
letters addressed to me as Esquire (though I have really no right
to the title), and I nearly went the other day to have some cards
engraved with my name as "Mr. Paul Owen." I am afraid I'm
backsliding terribly.'</p>
<p>Meenie laughed again. 'If that is all you have to burden your
conscience with,' she said, 'I don't think you need spend many
sleepless nights.'</p>
<p>'Quite so,' Paul answered, smiling; 'I think so myself. But that
is not all. I have begun to have serious doubts about the Apostle
himself and the whole Church altogether. I have been three years at
Oxford now; and while I was reading for Mods, I don't think I was
so unsettled in my mind. But since I have begun reading philosophy
for my Greats, I have had to go into all sorts of deep
books&mdash;Mill, and Spencer, and Bain, and all kinds of fellows
who really think about things, you know, down to the very
bottom&mdash;and an awful truth begins to dawn upon me, that our
Apostle is after all only a very third-rate type of thinker. Now
that, you know, is really terrible.'</p>
<p>'I don't see why,' Meenie answered demurely. She was beginning
to get genuinely interested.</p>
<p>'That is because you have never had to call in question a
cherished and almost ingrown faith. You have never realised any
similar circumstances. Here am I, brought up by these good, honest,
earnest people, with their own hard-earned money, as a pillar of
their belief. I have been taught to look upon myself as the chosen
advocate of their creed, and on the Apostle as an almost divinely
inspired man. My whole life has been bound up in it; I have worked
and read night and day in order to pass high and do honour to the
Church; and now what do I begin to find the Church really is? A
petty group of poor, devoted, enthusiastic, ignorant people, led
blindly by a decently instructed but narrow-minded teacher, who has
mixed up his own headstrong self-conceit and self-importance with
his own peculiar ideas of abstract religion.' Paul paused, half
surprised at himself, for, though he had doubted before, he had
never ventured till that day to formulate his doubts, even to
himself, in such plain and straightforward language.</p>
<p>'I see,' said Meenie gravely; 'you have come into a wider world;
you have mixed with wider ideas; and the wider world has converted
you instead of your converting the world. Well, that is only
natural. Others beside you have had to change their opinions.'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes; but for me it is harder&mdash;oh! so much
harder.'</p>
<p>'Because you have looked forward to being an Apostle?'</p>
<p>'Miss Bolton, you do me injustice&mdash;not in what you say, but
in the tone you say it in. No, it is not the giving up of the
Apostleship that troubles me, though I did hope that I might help
in my way to make the world a new earth; but it is the shock and
downfall of their hopes to all those good earnest people, and
especially&mdash;oh! especially, Miss Bolton, to my own dear father
and mother.' His eyes filled with tears as he spoke.</p>
<p>'I can understand,' said Meenie, sympathetically, her eyes
dimming a little in response. 'They have set their hearts all their
lives long on your accomplishing this work, and it will be to them
the disappointment of a cherished romance.'</p>
<p>They looked at one another a few minutes in silence.</p>
<p>'How long have you begun to have your doubts?' Meenie asked
after the pause.</p>
<p>'A long time, but most of all since I saw you. It has made
me&mdash;it has made me hesitate more about the fundamental article
of our faith. Even now, I am not sure whether it is not wrong of me
to be talking so with you about such matters.'</p>
<p>'I see,' said Meenie, a little more archly; 'it comes perilously
near&mdash;&mdash;' and she broke off, for she felt she had gone a
step too far.</p>
<p>'Perilously near falling in love,' Paul continued boldly,
turning his big eyes full upon her. 'Yes, perilously near.'</p>
<p>Their eyes met; Meenie's fell; and they said no more. But they
both felt they understood one another. Just at that moment the
Professor's wife came up to interrupt the <i>tête-à-tête</i>; 'for
that young Owen,' she said to herself, 'is really getting quite too
confidential with dear Meenie.'</p>
<p>That same evening Paul paced up and down his rooms in Peckwater
with all his soul strangely upheaved within him and tossed and
racked by a dozen conflicting doubts and passions. Had he gone too
far? Had he yielded like Adam to the woman who beguiled him? Had he
given way like Samson to the snares of Delilah? For the old
Scripture phraseology and imagery, so long burned into his very
nature, clung to him still in spite of all his faltering changes of
opinion. Had he said more than he thought and felt about the
Apostle? Even if he was going to revise his views, was it right,
was it candid, was it loyal to the truth, that he should revise
them under the biassing influence of Meenie's eyes? If only he
could have separated the two questions&mdash;the Apostle's mission,
and the something which he felt growing up within him! But he could
not&mdash;and, as he suspected, for a most excellent reason,
because the two were intimately bound up in the very warp and woof
of his existence. Nature was asserting herself against the
religious asceticism of the Apostle; it could not be so wrong for
him to feel those feelings that had thrilled every heart in all his
ancestors for innumerable generations.</p>
<p>He was in love with Meenie: he knew that clearly now. And this
love was after all not such a wicked and terrible feeling; on the
contrary, he felt all the better and the purer for it already. But
then that might merely be the horrible seductiveness of the thing.
Was it not always typified by the cup of Circe, by the song of the
Sirens, by all that was alluring and beautiful and hollow? He paced
up and down for half an hour, and then (he had sported his oak long
ago) he lit his little reading-lamp and sat down in the big chair
by the bay window. Running his eyes over his bookshelf, he took
out, half by chance, Spencer's <i>Sociology</i>. Then, from sheer
weariness, he read on for a while, hardly heeding what he read. At
last he got interested, and finished a chapter. When he had
finished it, he put the book down, and felt that the struggle was
over. Strange that side by side in the same world, in the same
London, there should exist two such utterly different types of man
as Herbert Spencer and the Gideonite Apostle. The last seemed to
belong to the sixteenth century, the first to some new and hitherto
uncreated social world. In an age which produced thinkers like
that, how could he ever have mistaken the poor, bigoted, narrow,
half-instructed Apostle for a divinely inspired teacher! So far as
Paul Owen was concerned, the Gideonite Church and all that belonged
to it had melted utterly into thin air.</p>
<p>Three days later, after the Eights in the early evening, Paul
found an opportunity of speaking again alone with Meenie. He had
taken their party on to the Christ Church barge to see the race,
and he was strolling with them afterwards round the meadow walk by
the bank of the Cherwell. Paul managed to get a little in front
with Meenie, and entered at once upon the subject of his late
embarrassments.</p>
<p>'I have thought it all over since, Miss Bolton,' he
said&mdash;he half hesitated whether he should say 'Meenie' or not,
and she was half disappointed that he didn't, for they were both
very young, and very young people fall in love so
unaffectedly&mdash;'I have thought it all over, and I have come to
the conclusion that there is no help for it: I must break openly
with the Church.'</p>
<p>'Of course,' said Meenie, simply. 'That I understood.'</p>
<p>He smiled at her ingenuousness. Such a very forward young
person! And yet he liked it. 'Well, the next thing is, what to do
about it. You see, I have really been obtaining my education, so to
speak, under false pretences. I can't continue taking these good
people's money after I have ceased to believe in their doctrines. I
ought to have faced the question sooner. It was wrong of me to wait
until&mdash;until it was forced upon me by other
considerations.'</p>
<p>This time it was Meenie who blushed. 'But you don't mean to
leave Oxford without taking your degree?' she asked quickly.</p>
<p>'No, I think it will be better not. To stop here and try for a
fellowship is my best chance of repaying these poor people the
money which I have taken from them for no purpose.'</p>
<p>'I never thought of that,' said Meenie. 'You are bound in honour
to pay them back, of course.'</p>
<p>Paul liked the instantaneous honesty of that 'of course.' It
marked the naturally honourable character; for, 'of course,' too,
they must wait to marry (young people jump so) till all that money
was paid off. 'Fortunately,' he said, 'I have lived economically,
and have not spent nearly as much as they guaranteed. I got
scholarships up to a hundred a year of my own, and I only took a
hundred a year of theirs. They offered me two hundred. But there's
five years at a hundred, that makes five hundred pounds&mdash;a big
debt to begin life with.'</p>
<p>'Never mind,' said Meenie. 'You will get a fellowship, and in a
few years you can pay it off.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Paul, 'I can pay it off. But I can never pay off the
hopes and aspirations I have blighted. I must become a
schoolmaster, or a barrister, or something of that sort, and never
repay them for their self-sacrifice and devotion in making me
whatever I shall become. They may get back their money, but they
will have lost their cherished Apostle for ever.'</p>
<p>'Mr. Owen,' Meenie answered solemnly, 'the seal of the
Apostolate lies far deeper than that. It was born in you, and no
act of yours can shake it off.'</p>
<p>'Meenie,' he said, looking at her gently, with a changed
expression&mdash;'Meenie, we shall have to wait many years.'</p>
<p>'Never mind, Paul,' she replied, as naturally as if he had been
Paul to her all her life long, 'I can wait if you can. But what
will you do for the immediate present?'</p>
<p>'I have my scholarship,' he said; 'I can get on partly upon
that; and then I can take pupils; and I have only one year more of
it.'</p>
<p>So before they parted that night it was all well understood
between them that Paul was to declare his defection from the Church
at the earliest opportunity; that he was to live as best he might
till he could take his degree; that he was then to pay off all the
back debt; and that after all these things he and Meenie might get
comfortably married whenever they were able. As to the Rector and
his wife, or any other parental authorities, they both left them
out in the cold as wholly as young people always do leave their
elders out on all similar occasions.</p>
<p>'Maria's a born fool!' said the Rector to his wife a week after
Meenie's return; 'I always knew she was a fool, but I never knew
she was quite such a fool as to permit a thing like this. So far as
I can get it out of Edie, and so far as Edie can get it out of
Meenie, I understand that she has allowed Meenie to go and get
herself engaged to some Dissenter fellow, a Shaker, or a Mormon, or
a Communist, or something of the sort, who is the son of a common
labourer, and has been sent up to Oxford, Tom tells me, by his own
sect, to be made into a gentleman, so as to give some sort or
colour of respectability to their absurd doctrines. I shall send
the girl to town at once to Emily's, and she shall stop there all
next season, to see if she can't manage to get engaged to some
young man in decent society at any rate.'</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>When Paul Owen returned to Peckham for the long vacation, it was
with a heavy heart that he ventured back slowly to his father's
cottage. Margaret Owen had put everything straight and neat in the
little living room, as she always did, to welcome home her son who
had grown into a gentleman; and honest John stood at the threshold
beaming with pleasure to wring Paul's hand in his firm grip, just
back unwashed from his day's labour. After the first kissings and
greetings were over, John Owen said rather solemnly, 'I have bad
news for you, Paul. The Apostle is sick, even unto death.'</p>
<p>When Paul heard that, he was sorely tempted to put off the
disclosure for the present; but he felt he must not. So that same
night, as they sat together in the dusk near the window where the
geraniums stood, he began to unburden his whole mind, gently and
tentatively, so as to spare their feelings as much as possible, to
his father and mother. He told them how, since he went to Oxford,
he had learned to think somewhat differently about many things; how
his ideas had gradually deepened and broadened; how he had begun to
inquire into fundamentals for himself; how he had feared that the
Gideonites took too much for granted, and reposed too implicitly on
the supposed critical learning of their Apostle. As he spoke his
mother listened in tearful silence; but his father murmured from
time to time, 'I was afeard of this already, Paul; I seen it
coming, now and again, long ago.' There was pity and regret in his
tone, but not a shade of reproachfulness.</p>
<p>At last, however, Paul came to speak, timidly and reservedly, of
Meenie. Then his father's eye began to flash a little, and his
breath came deeper and harder. When Paul told him briefly that he
was engaged to her, the strong man could stand it no longer. He
rose up in righteous wrath, and thrust his son at arm's-length from
him. 'What!' he cried fiercely, 'you don't mean to tell me you have
fallen into sin and looked upon the daughters of Midian! It was no
Scriptural doubts that druv you on, then, but the desire of the
flesh and the lust of the eyes that has lost you! You dare to stand
up there, Paul Owen, and tell me that you throw over the Church and
the Apostle for the sake of a girl, like a poor miserable Samson!
You are no son of mine, and I have nothin' more to say to you.'</p>
<p>But Margaret Owen put her hand on his shoulder and said softly,
'John, let us hear him out.' And John, recalled by that gentle
touch, listened once more. Then Paul pleaded his case powerfully
again. He quoted Scripture to them; he argued with them, after
their own fashion, and down to their own comprehension, text by
text; he pitted his own critical and exegetical faculty against the
Apostle's. Last of all, he turned to his mother, who, tearful still
and heartbroken with disappointment, yet looked admiringly upon her
learned, eloquent boy, and said to her tenderly, 'Remember, mother,
you yourself were once in love. You yourself once stood, night
after night, leaning on the gate, waiting with your heart beating
for a footstep that you knew so well. You yourself once counted the
days and the hours and the minutes till the next meeting came.' And
Margaret Owen, touched to the heart by that simple appeal, kissed
him fervently a dozen times over, the hot tears dropping on his
cheek meanwhile; and then, contrary to all the rules of their
austere Church, she flung her arms round her husband too, and
kissed him passionately the first time for twenty years, with all
the fervour of a floodgate loosed. Paul Owen's apostolate had
surely borne its first fruit.</p>
<p>The father stood for a moment in doubt and terror, like one
stunned or dazed, and then, in a moment of sudden remembrance,
stepped forward and returned the kiss. The spell was broken, and
the Apostle's power was no more. What else passed in the cottage
that night, when John Owen fell upon his knees and wrestled in
spirit, was too wholly internal to the man's own soul for telling
here. Next day John and Margaret Owen felt the dream of their lives
was gone; but the mother in her heart rejoiced to think her boy
might know the depths of love, and might bring home a real lady for
his wife.</p>
<p>On Sunday it was rumoured that the Apostle's ailment was very
serious; but young Brother Paul Owen would address the Church. He
did so, though not exactly in the way the Church expected. He told
them simply and plainly how he had changed his views about certain
matters; how he thanked them from his heart for the loan of their
money (he was careful to emphasise the word <i>loan</i>), which had
helped him to carry on his education at Oxford; and how he would
repay them the principal and interest, though he could never repay
them the kindness, at the earliest possible opportunity. He was so
grave, so earnest, so transparently true, that, in spite of the
downfall of their dearest hopes, he carried the whole meeting with
him, all save one man. That man was Job Grimshaw. Job rose from his
place with a look of undisguised triumph as soon as Paul had
finished, and, mounting the platform quietly, said his say.</p>
<p>'I knew, Episcops, Presbyters, and Brethren,' he began, 'how
this 'ere young man would finish. I saw it the day he was appinted.
He's flushing up now the same as he flushed up then when I spoke to
him; and it ain't sperritual, it's worldly pride and
headstrongness, that's what it is. He's had our money, and he's had
his eddication, and now he's going to round on us, just as I said
he would. It's all very well talking about paying us back: how's a
young man like him to get five hunderd pounds, I should like to
know. And if he did even, what sort o' repayment would that be to
many of the brethren, who've saved and scraped for five year to let
him live like a gentleman among the great and the mighty o' Midian?
He's got his eddication out of us, and he can keep that whatever
happens, and make a living out of it, too; and now he's going back
on us, same as I said he would, and, having got all he can out of
the Church, he's going to chuck it away like a sucked orange. I
detest such backsliding and such ungratefulness.'</p>
<p>Paul's cup of humiliation was full, but he bit his lip till the
blood almost came, and made no answer.</p>
<p>'He boasted in his own strength,' Job went on mercilessly, 'that
he wasn't going to be a backslider, and he wasn't going to sign no
bond, and he wasn't going to confer with us, but we must trust his
honour and honesty, and such like. I've got his very words written
down in my notebook 'ere; for I made a note of 'em, foreseeing
this. If we'd 'a' bound him down, as I proposed, he wouldn't 'a'
dared to go backsliding and rounding on us, and making up to the
daughters of Midian, as I don't doubt but what he's been doing.'
Paul's tell-tale face showed him at once that he had struck by
accident on the right chord. 'But if he ever goes bringing a
daughter of Midian here to Peckham,' Job continued, 'we'll show her
these very notes, and ask her what she thinks of such dishonourable
conduct. The Apostle's dying, that's clear; and before he dies I
warrant he shall know this treachery.'</p>
<p>Paul could not stand that last threat. Though he had lost faith
in the Apostle as an Apostle, he could never forget the allegiance
he had once borne him as a father, or the spell which his powerful
individuality had once thrown around him as a teacher. To have
embittered that man's dying bed with the shadow of a terrible
disappointment would be to Paul a lifelong subject of deep remorse.
'I did not intend to open my mouth in answer to you, Mr. Grimshaw,'
he said (for the first time breaking through the customary address
of Brother), 'but I pray you, I entreat you, I beseech you, not to
harass the Apostle in his last moments with such a subject.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, I suppose so,' Job Grimshaw answered maliciously, all
the ingrained coarseness of the man breaking out in the wrinkles of
his face. 'No wonder you don't want him enlightened about your
goings on with the daughters of Midian, when you must know as well
as I do that his life ain't worth a day's purchase, and that he's a
man of independent means, and has left you every penny he's got in
his will, because he believes you're a fit successor to the
Apostolate. I know it, for I signed as a witness, and I read it
through, being a short one, while the other witness was signing.
And you must know it as well as I do. I suppose you don't think
he'll make another will now; but there's time enough to burn that
one anyhow.'</p>
<p>Paul Owen stood aghast at the vulgar baseness of which this lewd
fellow supposed him capable. He had never thought of it before; and
yet it flashed across his mind in a moment how obvious it was now.
Of course the Apostle would leave him his money. He was being
educated for the Apostolate, and the Apostolate could not be
carried on without the sinews of war. But that Job Grimshaw should
think him guilty of angling for the Apostle's money, and then
throwing the Church overboard&mdash;the bare notion of it was so
horrible to him that he could not even hold up his head to answer
the taunt. He sat down and buried his crimson face in his hands;
and Job Grimshaw, taking up his hat sturdily, with the air of a man
who has to perform an unpleasant duty, left the meeting-room
abruptly without another word.</p>
<p>There was a gloomy Sunday dinner that morning in the mason's
cottage, and nobody seemed much inclined to speak in any way. But
as they were in the midst of their solemn meal, a neighbour who was
also a Gideonite came in hurriedly. 'It's all over,' he said,
breathless&mdash;'all over with us and with the Church. The Apostle
is dead. He died this morning.'</p>
<p>Margaret Owen found voice to ask, 'Before Job Grimshaw saw
him?'</p>
<p>The neighbour nodded, 'Yes.'</p>
<p>'Thank Heaven for that!' cried Paul. 'Then he did not die
misunderstanding me!'</p>
<p>'And you'll get his money,' added the neighbour, 'for I was the
other witness.'</p>
<p>Paul drew a long breath. 'I wish Meenie was here' he said. 'I
must see her about this.'</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>A few days later the Apostle was buried, and his will was read
over before the assembled Church. By earnest persuasion of his
father, Paul consented to be present, though he feared another
humiliation from Job Grimshaw. But two days before he had taken the
law into his own hands, by writing to Meenie, at her aunt's in
Eaton Place; and that very indiscreet young lady, in response, had
actually consented to meet him in Kensington Gardens alone the next
afternoon. There he sat with her on one of the benches by the
Serpentine, and talked the whole matter over with her to his
heart's content.</p>
<p>'If the money is really left to me,' he said, 'I must in honour
refuse it. It was left to me to carry on the Apostolate, and I
can't take it on any other ground. But what ought I to do with it?
I can't give it over to the Church, for in three days there will be
no Church left to give it to. What shall I do with it?'</p>
<p>'Why,' said Meenie, thoughtfully, 'if I were you, I should do
this. First, pay back everybody who contributed towards your
support in full, principal and interest; then borrow from the
remainder as much as you require to complete your Oxford course;
and finally, pay back all that and the other money to the fund when
you are able, and hand it over for the purpose of doing some good
work in Peckham itself, where your Church was originally founded.
If the ideal can't be fulfilled, let the money do something good
for the actual.'</p>
<p>'You are quite right, Meenie,' said Paul, 'except in one
particular. I will not borrow from the fund for my own support. I
will not touch a penny of it, temporarily or permanently, for
myself in any way. If it comes to me, I shall make it over to
trustees at once for some good object, as you suggest, and shall
borrow from them five hundred pounds to repay my own poor people,
giving the trustees my bond to repay the fund hereafter. I shall
fight my own battle henceforth unaided.'</p>
<p>'You will do as you ought to do, Paul, and I am proud of
it.'</p>
<p>So next morning, when the meeting took place, Paul felt somewhat
happier in his own mind as to the course he should pursue with
reference to Job Grimshaw.</p>
<p>The Senior Episcop opened and read the last will and testament
of Arthur Murgess, attorney-at-law. It provided, in a few words,
that all his estate, real and personal, should pass unreservedly to
his friend, Paul Owen, of Christ Church, Oxford. It was whispered
about that, besides the house and grounds, the personalty might be
sworn at eight thousand pounds, a vast sum to those simple
people.</p>
<p>When the reading was finished, Paul rose and addressed the
assembly. He told them briefly the plan he had formed, and insisted
on his determination that not a penny of the money should be put to
his own uses. He would face the world for himself, and thanks to
their kindness he could face it easily enough. He would still earn
and pay back all that he owed them. He would use the fund, first
for the good of those who had been members of the Church, and
afterwards for the good of the people of Peckham generally. And he
thanked them from the bottom of his heart for the kindness they had
shown him.</p>
<p>Even Job Grimshaw could only mutter to himself that this was not
sperritual grace, but mere worldly pride and stubbornness, lest the
lad should betray his evil designs, which had thus availed him
nothing. 'He has lost his own soul and wrecked the Church for the
sake of the money,' Job said, 'and now he dassn't touch a farden of
it.'</p>
<p>Next John Owen rose and said slowly, 'Friends, it seems to me we
may as well all confess that this Church has gone to pieces. I
can't stop in it myself any longer, for I see it's clear agin
nature, and what's agin nature can't be true.' And though the
assembly said nothing, it was plain that there were many waverers
in the little body whom the affairs of the last week had shaken
sadly in their simple faith. Indeed, as a matter of fact, before
the end of the month the Gideonite Church had melted away, member
by member, till nobody at all was left of the whole assembly but
Job Grimshaw.</p>
<p>'My dear,' said the Rector to his wife a few weeks later, laying
down his <i>Illustrated</i>, 'this is really a very curious thing.
That young fellow Owen, of Christ Church, that Meenie fancied
herself engaged to, has just come into a little landed property and
eight or nine thousand pounds on his own account. He must be better
connected than Tom imagines. Perhaps we might make inquiries about
him after all.'</p>
<p>The Rector did make inquiries in the course of the week, and
with such results that he returned to the rectory in blank
amazement. 'That fellow's mad, Amelia,' he said, 'stark mad, if
ever anybody was. The leader of his Little Bethel, or Ebenezer, or
whatever it may be, has left him all his property absolutely,
without conditions; and the idiot of a boy declares he won't touch
a penny of it, because he's ceased to believe in their particular
shibboleth, and he thinks the leader wanted him to succeed him.
Very right and proper of him, of course, to leave the sect if he
can't reconcile it with his conscience, but perfectly Quixotic of
him to give up the money and beggar himself outright. Even if his
connection was otherwise desirable (which it is far from being), it
would be absurd to think of letting Meenie marry such a ridiculous
hare-brained fellow.'</p>
<p>Paul and Meenie, however, went their own way, as young people
often will, in spite of the Rector. Paul returned next term to
Oxford, penniless, but full of resolution, and by dint of taking
pupils managed to eke out his scholarship for the next year. At the
end of that time he took his first in Greats, and shortly after
gained a fellowship. From the very first day he began saving money
to pay off that dead weight of five hundred pounds. The kindly
ex-Gideonites had mostly protested against his repaying them at
all, but in vain: Paul would not make his entry into life, he said,
under false pretences. It was a hard pull, but he did it. He took
pupils, he lectured, he wrote well and vigorously for the press, he
worked late and early with volcanic energy; and by the end of three
years he had not only saved the whole of the sum advanced by the
Gideonites, but had also begun to put away a little nest-egg
against his marriage with Meenie. And when the editor of a great
morning paper in London offered him a permanent place upon the
staff, at a large salary, he actually went down to Worcestershire,
saw the formidable Rector himself in his own parish, and demanded
Meenie outright in marriage. And the Rector observed to his wife
that this young Owen seemed a well-behaved and amiable young man;
that after all one needn't know anything about his relations if one
didn't like; and that as Meenie had quite made up her mind, and was
as headstrong as a mule, there was no use trying to oppose her any
longer.</p>
<p>Down in Peckham, where Paul Owen lives, and is loved by half the
poor of the district, no one has forgotten who was the real founder
of the Murgess Institute, which does so much good in encouraging
thrift, and is so admirably managed by the founder and his wife. He
would take a house nowhere but at Peckham, he said. To the Peckham
people he owed his education, and for the Peckham people he would
watch the working of his little Institute. There is no better work
being done anywhere in that great squalid desert, the east and
south-east of London; there is no influence more magnetic than the
founder's. John and Margaret Owen have recovered their hopes for
their boy, only they run now in another and more feasible
direction; and those who witness the good that is being done by the
Institute among the poor of Peckham, or who have read that
remarkable and brilliant economical work lately published on 'The
Future of Co-operation in the East End, by P. O.,' venture to
believe that Meenie was right after all, and that even the great
social world itself has not yet heard the last of young Paul Owen's
lay apostolate.</p>

<h3>JOHN CANN'S TREASURE</h3>
<p>Cecil Mitford sat at a desk in the Record Office with a stained
and tattered sheet of dark dirty-brown antique paper spread before
him in triumph, and with an eager air of anxious inquiry speaking
forth from every line in his white face and every convulsive twitch
at the irrepressible corners of his firm pallid mouth. Yes, there
was no doubt at all about it; the piece of torn and greasy paper
which he had at last discovered was nothing more or less than John
Cann's missing letter. For two years Cecil Mitford had given up all
his spare time, day and night, to the search for that lost fragment
of crabbed seventeenth-century handwriting; and now at length,
after so many disappointments and so much fruitless anxious
hunting, the clue to the secret of John Cann's treasure was lying
there positively before him. The young man's hand trembled
violently as he held the paper fast, unopened in his feverish
grasp, and read upon its back the autograph endorsement of Charles
the Second's Secretary of State&mdash;'Letter in cypher from Io.
Cann, the noted Buccaneer, to his brother Will<sup>m</sup>.,
intercepted at Port Royal by his Ma<sup>tie's</sup> command, and
despatched by General Ed. D'Oyley, his Ma<sup>tie's</sup>
Captain-Gen^l and Governor-in-Chief of the Island of Jamaica, to
me, <span class="smcap">H. Nicholas</span>.' That was it, beyond
the shadow of a doubt; and though Cecil Mitford had still to apply
to the cypher John Cann's own written key, and to find out the
precise import of the directions it contained, he felt at that
moment that the secret was now at last virtually discovered, and
that John Cann's untold thousands of buried wealth were potentially
his very own already.</p>
<p>He was only a clerk in the Colonial Office, was Cecil Mitford,
on a beggarly income of a hundred and eighty a year&mdash;how small
it seemed now, when John Cann's money was actually floating before
his mind's-eye; but he had brains and industry and enterprise after
a fitful adventurous fashion of his own; and he had made up his
mind years before that he would find out the secret of John Cann's
buried treasure, if he had to spend half a lifetime on the almost
hopeless quest. As a boy, Cecil Mitford had been brought up at his
father's rectory on the slopes of Dartmoor, and there he had played
from his babyhood upward among the rugged granite boulders of John
Cann's rocks, and had heard from the farm labourers and the other
children around the romantic but perfectly historical legend of
John Cann's treasure. Unknown and incredible sums in Mexican
doubloons and Spanish dollars lay guarded by a strong oaken chest
in a cavern on the hilltop, long since filled up with flints and
mould from the neighbouring summits. To that secure hiding-place
the great buccaneer had committed the hoard gathered in his
numberless piratical expeditions, burying all together under the
shadow of a petty porphyritic tor that overhangs the green valley
of Bovey Tracy. Beside the bare rocks that mark the site, a
perfectly distinct pathway is worn by footsteps into the granite
platform underfoot; and that path, little Cecil Mitford had heard
with childish awe and wonder, was cut out by the pacing up and down
of old John Cann himself, mounting guard in the darkness and
solitude over the countless treasure that he had hidden away in the
recesses of the pixies' hole beneath.</p>
<p>As young Mitford grew up to man's estate, this story of John
Cann's treasure haunted his quick imagination for many years with
wonderful vividness. When he first came up to London, after his
father's death, and took his paltry clerkship in the Colonial
Office&mdash;how he hated the place, with its monotonous drudgery,
while John Cann's wealth was only waiting for him to take it and
floating visibly before his prophetic eyes!&mdash;the story began
for a while to fade out under the disillusioning realities of
respectable poverty and a petty Government post. But before he had
been many months in the West India department (he had a small room
on the third floor, overlooking Downing Street) a casual discovery
made in overhauling the archives of the office suddenly revived the
boyish dream with all the added realism and cool intensity of
maturer years. He came across a letter from John Cann himself to
the Protector Oliver, detailing the particulars of a fierce
irregular engagement with a Spanish privateer, in which the
Spaniard had been captured with much booty, and his vessel duly
sold to the highest bidder in Port Royal harbour. This curious
coincidence gave a great shock of surprise to young Mitford. John
Cann, then, was no mythical prehistoric hero, no fairy-king or pixy
or barrow-haunter of the popular fancy, but an actual genuine
historical figure, who corresponded about his daring exploits with
no less a personage than Oliver himself! From that moment forth,
Cecil Mitford gave himself up almost entirely to tracing out the
forgotten history of the old buccaneer. He allowed no peace to the
learned person who took care of the State Papers of the
Commonwealth at the Record Office, and he established private
relations, by letter, with two or three clerks in the Colonial
Secretary's Office at Kingston, Jamaica, whom he induced to help
him in reconstructing the lost story of John Cann's life.</p>
<p>Bit by bit Cecil Mitford had slowly pieced together a wonderful
mass of information, buried under piles of ragged manuscript and
weary reams of dusty documents, about the days and doings of that
ancient terror of the Spanish Main. John Cann was a Devonshire lad,
of the rollicking, roving seventeenth century, born and bred at
Bovey Tracy, on the flanks of Dartmoor, the last survivor of those
sea-dogs of Devon who had sallied forth to conquer and explore a
new Continent under the guidance of Drake, and Raleigh, and
Frobisher, and Hawkins. As a boy, he had sailed with his father in
a ship that bore the Queen's letters of marque and reprisal against
the Spanish galleons; in his middle life, he had lived a strange
roaming existence&mdash;half pirate and half privateer, intent upon
securing the Protestant religion and punishing the King's enemies
by robbing wealthy Spanish skippers and cutting off the recusant
noses of vile Papistical Cuban slave-traders; in his latter days,
the fierce, half-savage old mariner had relapsed into sheer
robbery, and had been hunted down as a public enemy by the Lord
Protector's servants, or later still by the Captains-General and
Governors-in-Chief of his Most Sacred Majesty's Dominions in the
West Indies. For what was legitimate warfare in the spacious days
of great Elizabeth, had come to be regarded in the degenerate reign
of Charles II. as rank piracy.</p>
<p>One other thing Cecil Mitford had discovered, with absolute
certainty; and that was that in the summer of 1660, the year of his
Ma<sup>ties</sup> most happy restoration,' as John Cann himself
phrased it, the persecuted and much misunderstood old buccaneer had
paid a secret visit to England, and had brought with him the whole
hoard which he had accumulated during sixty years of lawful or
unlawful piracy in the West Indies and the Spanish Main. Concerning
this hoard, which he had concealed somewhere in Devonshire, he kept
up a brisk vernacular correspondence in cypher with his brother
William, at Tavistock; and the key to that cypher, marked outside
'A clew to my Bro. Iohn's secret writing,' Cecil Mitford had been
fortunate enough to unearth among the undigested masses of the
Record Office. But one letter, the last and most important of the
whole series, containing as he believed the actual statement of the
hiding-place, had long evaded all his research: and that was the
letter which, now at last, after months and months of patient
inquiry, lay unfolded before his dazzled eyes on the little desk in
his accustomed corner. It had somehow been folded up by mistake in
the papers relating to the charge against Cyriack Skinner, of
complicity in the Rye House Plot. How it got there nobody knows,
and probably nobody but Cecil Mitford himself could ever have
succeeded in solving the mystery.</p>
<p>As he gazed, trembling, at the precious piece of dusty
much-creased paper, scribbled over in the unlettered schoolboy hand
of the wild old sea-dog, Cecil Mitford could hardly restrain
himself for a moment from uttering a cry. Untold wealth swam before
his eyes: he could marry Ethel now, and let her drive in her own
carriage! Ah, what he would give if he might only shout in his
triumph. He couldn't even read the words, he was so excited. But
after a minute or two, he recovered his composure sufficiently to
begin deciphering the crabbed writing, which constant practice and
familiarity with the system enabled him to do immediately, without
even referring to the key. And this was what, with a few minutes'
inspection, Cecil Mitford slowly spelled out of the dirty
manuscript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>'<i>From Jamaica. This 23rd day of
Jan<sup>y</sup>.</i><br>
<i>in the Yeare of our Lord 1663.</i><br>
<br>
'My deare Bro.,&mdash;I did not think to have written you againe,
after the scurvie Trick you have played me in disclosing my Affairs
to that meddlesome Knight that calls himself the King's Secretary:
but in truth your last Letter hath so moved me by your Vileness
that I must needs reply thereto with all Expedicion. These are to
assure you, then, that let you pray how you may, or gloze over your
base treatment with fine cozening Words and fair Promises, you
shall have neither lot nor scot in my Threasure, which is indeed as
you surmise hidden away in England, but the Secret whereof I shall
impart neither to you nor to no man. I have give commands,
therefore, that the Paper whereunto I have committed the place of
its hiding shall be buried with my own Body (when God please) in
the grave-yarde at Port Royal in this Island: so that you shall
never be bettered one Penny by your most Damnable Treachery and
Double-facedness. For I know you, my deare Bro., in very truth for
a prating Coxcomb, a scurvie cowardlie Knave, and a lying Thief of
other Men's Reputations. Therefore, no more herewith from your very
humble Ser<sup>vt.</sup> and Loving Bro.,<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Iohn Cann</span>,
Capt<sup>n.</sup>'</blockquote>
<p>Cecil Mitford laid the paper down as he finished reading it with
a face even whiter and paler than before, and with the muscles of
his mouth trembling violently with suppressed emotion. At the exact
second when he felt sure he had discovered the momentous secret, it
had slipped mysteriously through his very fingers, and seemed now
to float away into the remote distance, almost as far from his
eager grasp as ever. Even there, in the musty Record Office, before
all the clerks and scholars who were sitting about working
carelessly at their desks at mere dilettante historical
problems&mdash;the stupid prigs, how he hated them!&mdash;he could
hardly restrain the expression of his pent-up feelings at that
bitter disappointment in the very hour of his fancied triumph.
Jamaica! How absolutely distant and unapproachable it sounded! How
hopeless the attempt to follow up the clue! How utterly his
day-dream had been dashed to the ground in those three minutes of
silent deciphering! He felt as if the solid earth was reeling
beneath him, and he would have given the whole world if he could
have put his face between his two hands on the desk and cried like
a woman before the whole Record Office.</p>
<p>For half an hour by the clock he sat there dazed and motionless,
gazing in a blank disappointed fashion at the sheet of
coffee-coloured paper in front of him. It was late, and workers
were dropping away one after another from the scantily peopled
desks. But Cecil Mitford took no notice of them: he merely sat with
his arms folded, and gazed abstractedly at that disappointing,
disheartening, irretrievable piece of crabbed writing. At last an
assistant came up and gently touched his arm. 'We're going to close
now, sir,' he said in his unfeeling official tone&mdash;just as if
it were a mere bit of historical inquiry he was after&mdash;'and I
shall be obliged if you'll put back the manuscripts you've been
consulting into F. 27' Cecil Mitford rose mechanically and sorted
out the Cyriack Skinner papers into their proper places. Then he
laid them quietly on the shelf, and walked out into the streets of
London, for the moment a broken-hearted man.</p>
<p>But as he walked home alone that clear warm summer evening, and
felt the cool breeze blowing against his forehead, he began to
reflect to himself that, after all, all was not lost; that in fact
things really stood better with him now than they had stood that
very morning, before he lighted upon John Cann's last letter. He
had not discovered the actual hiding-place of the hoard, to be
sure, but he now knew on John Cann's own indisputable authority,
first, that there really was a hidden treasure; second, that the
hiding-place was really in England; and third, that full
particulars as to the spot where it was buried might be found in
John Cann's own coffin at Port Royal, Jamaica. It was a risky and
difficult thing to open a coffin, no doubt; but it was not
impossible. No, not impossible. On the whole, putting one thing
with another, in spite of his terrible galling disappointment, he
was really nearer to the recovery of the treasure now than he had
ever been in his life before. Till to-day, the final clue was
missing; to-day, it had been found. It was a difficult and
dangerous clue to follow, but still it had been found.</p>
<p>And yet, setting aside the question of desecrating a grave, how
all but impossible it was for him to get to Jamaica! His small
funds had long ago been exhausted in prosecuting the research, and
he had nothing on earth to live upon now but his wretched salary.
Even if he could get three or six months' leave from the Colonial
Office, which was highly improbable, how could he ever raise the
necessary money for his passage out and home, as well as for the
delicate and doubtful operation of searching for documents in John
Cann's coffin? It was tantalising, it was horrible, it was
unendurable; but here, with the secret actually luring him on to
discover it, he was to be foiled and baffled at the last moment by
a mere paltry, petty, foolish consideration of two hundred pounds!
Two hundred pounds! How utterly ludicrous! Why, John Cann's
treasure would make him a man of fabulous wealth for a whole
lifetime, and he was to be prevented from realising it by a
wretched matter of two hundred pounds! He would do anything to get
it&mdash;for a loan, a mere loan; to be repaid with cent. per cent.
interest; but where in the world, where in the world, was he ever
to get it from?</p>
<p>And then, quick as lightning, the true solution of the whole
difficulty flashed at once across his excited brain. He could
borrow all the money if he chose from Ethel! Poor little Ethel; she
hadn't much of her own; but she had just enough to live very
quietly upon with her Aunt Emily; and, thank Heaven, it wasn't tied
up with any of those bothering, meddling three-per-cent.-loving
trustees! She had her little all at her own disposal, and he could
surely get two or three hundred pounds from her to secure for them
both the boundless buried wealth of John Cann's treasure.</p>
<p>Should he make her a confidante outright, and tell her what it
was that he wanted the money for? No, that would be impossible; for
though she had heard all about John Cann over and over again, she
had not faith enough in the treasure&mdash;women are so
unpractical&mdash;to hazard her little scrap of money on it; of
that he felt certain. She would go and ask old Mr. Cartwright's
opinion; and old Mr. Cartwright was one of those penny-wise,
purblind, unimaginative old gentlemen who will never believe in
anything until they've seen it. Yet here was John Cann's money
going a-begging, so to speak, and only waiting for him and Ethel to
come and enjoy it. Cecil had no patience with those stupid,
stick-in-the-mud, timid people who can see no further than their
own noses. For Ethel's own sake he would borrow two or three
hundred pounds from her, one way or another, and she would easily
forgive him the harmless little deception when he paid her back a
hundredfold out of John Cann's boundless treasure.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>That very evening, without a minute's delay, Cecil determined to
go round and have a talk with Ethel Sutherland. 'Strike while the
iron's hot,' he said to himself. 'There isn't a minute to be lost;
for who knows but somebody else may find John Cann's treasure
before I do?'</p>
<p>Ethel opened the door to him herself; theirs was an old
engagement of long standing, after the usual Government clerk's
fashion; and Aunt Emily didn't stand out so stiffly as many old
maids do for the regular proprieties. Very pretty Ethel looked with
her pale face and the red ribbon in her hair; very pretty, but
Cecil feared, as he looked into her dark hazel eyes, a little
wearied and worn-out, for it was her music-lesson day, as he well
remembered. Her music-lesson day! Ethel Sutherland to give
music-lessons to some wretched squealing children at the West-End,
when all John Cann's wealth was lying there, uncounted, only
waiting for him and her to take it and enjoy it! The bare thought
was a perfect purgatory to him. He must get that two hundred pounds
to-night, or give up the enterprise altogether.</p>
<p>'Well, Ethel darling,' he said tenderly, taking her pretty
little hand in his; 'you look tired, dearest. Those horrid children
have been bothering you again. How I wish we were married, and you
were well out of it!'</p>
<p>Ethel smiled a quiet smile of resignation. 'They <i>are</i>
rather trying, Cecil,' she said gently, 'especially on days when
one has got a headache; but, after all, I'm very glad to have the
work to do; it helps such a lot to eke out our little income. We
have so <i>very</i> little, you know, even for two lonely women to
live upon in simple little lodgings like these, that I'm thankful I
can do something to help dear Aunt Emily, who's really goodness
itself. You see, after all, I get very well paid indeed for the
lessons.'</p>
<p>'Ethel,' Cecil Mitford said suddenly, thinking it better to dash
at once into the midst of business; 'I've come round this evening
to talk with you about a means by which you can add a great deal
with perfect safety to your little income. Not by lessons, Ethel
darling; not by lessons. I can't bear to see you working away the
pretty tips off those dear little fingers of yours with strumming
scales on the piano for a lot of stupid, gawky schoolgirls; it's by
a much simpler way than that; I know of a perfectly safe investment
for that three hundred that you've got in New Zealand Four per
Cents. Can you not have heard that New Zealand securities are in a
very shaky way just at present?'</p>
<p>'Very shaky, Cecil?' Ethel answered in surprise. 'Why, Mr.
Cartwright told me only a week ago they were as safe as the Bank of
England!'</p>
<p>'Mr. Cartwright's an ignorant old martinet,' Cecil replied
vigorously. 'He thinks because the stock's inscribed and the
dividends are payable in Threadneedle Street, that the colony of
New Zealand's perfectly solvent. Now, I'm in the Colonial Office,
and I know a great deal better than that. New Zealand has
over-borrowed, I assure you; quite over-borrowed; and a serious
fall is certain to come sooner or later. Mark my words, Ethel
darling; if you don't sell out those New Zealand Fours, you'll find
your three hundred has sunk to a hundred and fifty in rather less
than half no time!'</p>
<p>Ethel hesitated, and looked at him in astonishment. 'That's very
queer,' she said, 'for Mr. Cartwright wants me to sell out my
little bit of Midland and put it all into the same New Zealands. He
says they're so safe and pay so well.'</p>
<p>'Mr. Cartwright indeed!' Cecil cried contemptuously. 'What means
on earth has he of knowing? Didn't he advise you to buy nothing but
three per cents., and then let you get some Portuguese Threes at
fifty, which are really sixes, and exceedingly doubtful securities?
What's the use of trusting a man like that, I should like to know?
No, Ethel, if you'll be guided by me&mdash;and I have special
opportunities of knowing about these things at the Colonial
Office&mdash;you'll sell out your New Zealands, and put them into a
much better investment that I can tell you about. And if I were
you, I'd say nothing about it to Mr. Cartwright.'</p>
<p>'But, Cecil, I never did anything in business before without
consulting him! I should be afraid of going quite wrong.'</p>
<p>Cecil took her hand in his with real tenderness. Though he was
trying to deceive her&mdash;for her own good&mdash;he loved her
dearly in his heart of hearts, and hated himself for the deception
he was remorsefully practising upon her. Yet, for her sake, he
would go through with it. 'You must get accustomed to trusting
<i>me</i> instead of him, darling,' he said softly. 'When you are
mine for ever, as I hope you will be soon, you will take my advice,
of course, in all such matters, won't you? And you may as well
begin by taking it now. I have great hopes, Ethel, that before very
long my circumstances will be so much improved that I shall be able
to marry you&mdash;I hardly know how quickly; perhaps even before
next Christmas. But meanwhile, darling, I have something to break
to you that I dare say will grieve you a little for the moment,
though it's for your ultimate good, birdie&mdash;for your ultimate
good. The Colonial Office people have selected me to go to Jamaica
on some confidential Government business, which may keep me there
for three months or so. It's a dreadful thing to be away from you
so long, Ethel; but if I manage the business successfully&mdash;and
I shall, I know&mdash;I shall get promoted when I come back, well
promoted, perhaps to the chief clerkship in the Department; and
then we could marry comfortably almost at once.'</p>
<p>'To Jamaica! Oh, Cecil! How awfully far! And suppose you were to
get yellow fever or something.'</p>
<p>'But I won't, Ethel; I promise you I won't, and I'll guarantee
it with a kiss, birdie; so now, that's settled. And then, consider
the promotion! Only three months, probably, and when I come back,
we can be actually married. It's a wonderful stroke of luck, and I
only heard of it this morning. I couldn't rest till I came and told
you.'</p>
<p>Ethel wiped a tear away silently, and only answered 'If you're
glad, Cecil dearest, I'm glad too.'</p>
<p>'Well now, Ethel,' Cecil Mitford went on as gaily as he could,
'that brings me up to the second point. I want you to sell out
these wretched New Zealands, so as to take the money with me to
invest on good mortgages in Jamaica. My experience in West Indian
matters&mdash;after three years in the Department&mdash;will enable
me to lay it out for you at nine per cent.&mdash;nine per cent.,
observe, Ethel&mdash;on absolute security of landed property.
Planters want money to improve their estates, and can't get it at
less than that rate. Your three hundred would bring you in
twenty-seven pounds, Ethel; twenty-seven pounds is a lot of
money!'</p>
<p>What could poor Ethel do? In his plausible, affectionate
manner&mdash;and all for her own good, too&mdash;Cecil talked her
over quickly between love and business experience, coaxing kisses
and nine per cent. interest, endearing names and knowledge of West
Indian affairs, till helpless little Ethel willingly promised to
give up her poor little three hundred, and even arranged to meet
Cecil secretly on Thursday at the Bank of England, about Colonial
Office dinner-hour, to effect the transfer on her own account,
without saying a single word about it to Aunt Emily or Mr.
Cartwright. Cecil's conscience&mdash;for he <i>had</i> a
conscience, though he did his best to stifle it&mdash;gave him a
bitter twinge every now and then, as one question after another
drove him time after time into a fresh bit of deceit; but he tried
to smile and smile and be a villain as unconcernedly and lightly as
possible. Once only towards the end of the evening, when everything
was settled, and Cecil had talked about his passage, and the
important business with which he was intrusted, at full length, a
gleam of suspicion seemed to flash for a single second across poor
Ethel's deluded little brains. Jamaica&mdash;promotion&mdash;three
hundred pounds&mdash;it was all so sudden and so connected; could
Cecil himself be trying to deceive her, and using her money for his
wild treasure hunt? The doubt was horrible, degrading, unworthy of
her or him; and yet somehow for a single moment she could not help
half-unconsciously entertaining it.</p>
<p>'Cecil,' she said, hesitating, and looking into the very depths
of his truthful blue eyes; 'you're not concealing anything from me,
are you? It's not some journey connected with John Cann?'</p>
<p>Cecil coughed and cleared his throat uneasily, but by a great
effort he kept his truthful blue eyes still fixed steadily on hers.
(He would have given the world if he might have turned them away,
but that would have been to throw up the game incontinently.) 'My
darling Ethel,' he said evasively, 'how on earth could the Colonial
Office have anything to do with John Cann?'</p>
<p>'Answer me Yes or No, Cecil. Do please answer me Yes or No.'</p>
<p>Cecil kept his eyes still fixed immovably on hers, and without a
moment's hesitation answered quickly 'No.' It was an awful wrench,
and his lips could hardly frame the horrid falsehood, but for
Ethel's sake he answered 'No.'</p>
<p>'Then I know I can trust you, Cecil,' she said, laying her head
for forgiveness on his shoulder. 'Oh, how wrong it was of me to
doubt you for a second!'</p>
<p>Cecil sighed uneasily, and kissed her white forehead without a
single word.</p>
<p>'After all,' he thought to himself, as he walked back to his
lonely lodgings late that evening, 'I need never tell her anything
about it. I can pretend, when I've actually got John Cann's
treasure, that I came across the clue accidentally while I was in
Jamaica; and I can lay out three hundred of it there in mortgages:
and she need never know a single word about my innocent little
deception. But indeed in the pride and delight of so much money,
all our own, she'll probably never think at all of her poor little
paltry three hundred.'</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It was an awfully long time, that eighteen days at sea, on the
Royal Mail Steamship <i>Don</i>, bound for Kingston, Jamaica, with
John Cann's secret for ever on one's mind, and nothing to do all
day, by way of outlet for one's burning energy, but to look, hour
after hour, at the monotonous face of the seething water. But at
last the journey was over; and before Cecil Mitford had been
twenty-four hours at Date Tree Hall, the chief hotel in Kingston,
he had already hired a boat and sailed across the baking hot
harbour to Port Royal, to look in the dreary, sandy cemetery for
any sign or token of John Cann's grave.</p>
<p>An old grey-haired negro, digging at a fresh grave, had charge
of the cemetery, and to him Cecil Mitford at once addressed
himself, to find out whether any tombstone about the place bore the
name of John Cann. The old man turned the name over carefully in
his stolid brains, and then shook his heavy grey head with a
decided negative. 'Massa John Cann, sah,' he said dubiously, 'Massa
John Cann; it don't nobody buried here by de name ob Massa John
Cann. I sartin, sah, becase I's sexton in dis here cemetry dese
fifty year, an' I know de grabe ob ebbery buckra gentleman dat
ebber buried here since I fuss came.'</p>
<p>Cecil Mitford tossed his head angrily. 'Since <i>you</i> first
came, my good man,' he said with deep contempt. 'Since you first
came! Why, John Cann was buried here ages and ages before you
yourself were ever born or thought of.'</p>
<p>The old negro looked up at him inquiringly. There is nothing a
negro hates like contempt; and he answered back with a disdainful
tone, 'Den I can find out if him ebber was buried here at all, as
well as you, sah. We has register here; we don't ignorant heathen.
I has register in de church ob every pusson dat ebber buried in dis
cemetry from de berry beginnin&mdash;from de year ob de great
earthquake itself. What year dis Massa John Cann him die, now? What
year him die?'</p>
<p>Cecil pricked up his ears at the mention of the register, and
answered eagerly, 'In the year 1669.'</p>
<p>The old negro sat down quietly on a flat tomb, and answered with
a smile of malicious triumph, 'Den you is ignorant know-nuffin
pusson for a buckra gentleman, for true, sah, if you tink you will
find him grabe in dis here cemetry. Don't you nebber read your
history book, dat all Port Royal drowned in de great earthquake ob
de year 1692? We has register here for ebbery year, from de year
1692 downward; but de grabes, and de cemetery, and de register,
from de year 1692 upward, him all swallowed up entirely in de great
earthquake, bress de Lord!'</p>
<p>Cecil Mitford felt the earth shivering beneath him at that
moment, as verily as the Port Royal folk had felt it shiver in
1692. He clutched at the headstone to keep him from falling, and
sat down hazily on the flat tomb, beside the grey-headed old negro,
like one unmanned and utterly disheartened. It was all only too
true. With his intimate knowledge of John Cann's life, and of West
Indian affairs generally, how on earth could he ever have
overlooked it? John Cann's grave lay buried five fathoms deep, no
doubt, under the blue waters of the Caribbean. And it was for this
that he had madly thrown up his Colonial Office appointment, for
this that he had wasted Ethel's money, for this that he had
burdened his conscience with a world of lies; all to find in the
end that John Cann's secret was hidden under five fathoms of
tropical lagoon, among the scattered and water-logged ruins of Old
Port Royal. His fortitude forsook him for a single moment, and
burying his face in his two hands, there, under the sweltering
mid-day heat of that deadly sandbank, he broke down utterly, and
sobbed like a child before the very eyes of the now softened old
negro sexton.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>It was not for long, however. Cecil Mitford had at least one
strong quality&mdash;indomitable energy and perseverance. All was
not yet lost: if need were, he would hunt for John Cann's tomb in
the very submerged ruins of Old Port Royal. He looked up once more
at the puzzled negro, and tried to bear this bitter downfall of all
his hopes with manful resignation.</p>
<p>At that very moment, a tall and commanding-looking man, of about
sixty, with white hair but erect figure, walked slowly from the
cocoa-nut grove on the sand-spit into the dense and tangled
precincts of the cemetery. He was a brown man, a mulatto
apparently, but his look and bearing showed him at once to be a
person of education and distinction in his own fashion. The old
sexton rose up respectfully as the stranger approached, and said to
him in a very different tone from that in which he had addressed
Cecil Mitford,' Marnin, sah; marnin, Mr. Barclay. Dis here buckra
gentleman from Englan', him come 'quiring in de cemetry after de
grabe of pusson dat dead before de great earthquake. What for him
come here like-a-dat on fool's errand, eh, sah? What for him not
larn before him come dat Port Royal all gone drowned in de year
1692?'</p>
<p>The new-comer raised his hat slightly to Cecil Mitford, and
spoke at once in the grave gentle voice of an educated and
cultivated mulatto. 'You wanted some antiquarian information about
the island, sir; some facts about some one who died before the Port
Royal earthquake? You have luckily stumbled across the right man to
help you; for I think if anything can be recovered about anybody in
Jamaica, I can aid you in recovering it. Whose grave did you want
to see?'</p>
<p>Cecil hardly waited to thank the polite stranger, but blurted
out at once, 'The grave of John Cann, who died in 1669.'</p>
<p>The stranger smiled quietly. 'What! John Cann, the famous
buccaneer?' he said, with evident delight. 'Are you interested in
John Cann?'</p>
<p>'I am,' Cecil answered hastily. 'Do you know anything about
him?'</p>
<p>'I know all about him,' the tall mulatto replied. 'All about him
in every way. He was not buried at Port Royal at all. He intended
to be, and gave orders to that effect; but his servants had him
buried quietly elsewhere, on account of some dispute with the
Governor of the time being, about some paper which he desired to
have placed in his coffin.'</p>
<p>'Where, where?' Cecil Mitford gasped out eagerly, clutching at
this fresh straw with all the anxiety of a drowning man.</p>
<p>'At Spanish Town,' the stranger answered calmly. 'I know his
grave there well to the present day. If you are interested in
Jamaican antiquities, and would like to come over and see it, I
shall be happy to show you the tomb. That is my name.' And he
handed Cecil Mitford his card, with all the courteous dignity of a
born gentleman.</p>
<p>Cecil took the card and read the name on it: 'The Hon. Charles
Barclay, Leigh Caymanas, Spanish Town.' How his heart bounded again
that minute! Proof was accumulating on proof, and luck on luck!
After all, he had tracked down John Cann's grave; and the paper was
really there, buried in his coffin. He took the handkerchief from
his pocket and wiped his damp brow with a feeling of unspeakable
relief. Ethel was saved, and they might still enjoy John Cann's
treasure.</p>
<p>Mr. Barclay sat down beside him on the stone slab, and began
talking over all he knew about John Cann's life and actions. Cecil
affected to be interested in all he said, though really he could
think of one thing only: the treasure, the treasure, the treasure.
But he managed also to let Mr. Barclay see how much he too knew
about the old buccaneer; and Mr. Barclay, who was a simple-minded
learned enthusiast for all that concerned the antiquities of his
native island, was so won over by this display of local knowledge
on the part of a stranger and an Englishman, that he ended by
inviting Cecil over to his house at Spanish Town, to stop as long
as he was able. Cecil gladly accepted the invitation, and that very
afternoon, with a beating heart, he took his place in the lumbering
train that carried him over to the final goal of his Jamaican
expedition.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>In a corner of the Cathedral graveyard at Spanish Town, overhung
by a big spreading mango tree, and thickly covered by prickly scrub
of agavé and cactus, the white-haired old mulatto gentleman led
Cecil Mitford up to a water-worn and weathered stone, on which a
few crumbling letters alone were still visible. Cecil kneeled down
on the bare ground, regardless of the sharp cactus spines that
stung and tore his flesh, and began clearing the moss and lichen
away from the neglected monument. Yes, his host was right! right,
right, right, indubitably. The first two letters were <span class=
"smcap">Io</span>, then a blank where others were obliterated, and
then came <span class="smcap">ANN</span>. That stood clearly for
<span class="smcap">Iohn Cann</span>. And below he could slowly
make out the words, 'Born at ... vey Tra ... Devon ...' with an
illegible date, 'Died at P ... Royal, May 12, 1669.' Oh, great
heavens, yes. John Cann's grave! John Cann's grave! John Cann's
grave! Beyond any shadow or suspicion of mistake, John Cann and his
precious secret lay buried below that mouldering tombstone.</p>
<p>That very evening Cecil Mitford sought out and found the Spanish
Town gravedigger. He was a solemn-looking middle-aged black man,
with a keen smart face, not the wrong sort of man, Cecil Mitford
felt sure, for such a job as the one he contemplated. Cecil didn't
beat about the bush or temporise with him in any way. He went
straight to the point, and asked the man outright whether he would
undertake to open John Cann's grave, and find a paper that was
hidden in the coffin. The gravedigger stared at him, and answered
slowly, 'I don't like de job, sah; I don't like de job. Perhaps
Massa John Cann's ghost, him come and trouble me for dat: I don't
going to do it. What you gib me, sah; how much you gib me?'</p>
<p>Cecil opened his purse and took out of it ten gold sovereigns.
'I will give you that,' he said, 'if you can get me the paper out
of John Cann's coffin.'</p>
<p>The negro's eyes glistened, but he answered carelessly, 'I don't
tink I can do it. I don't want to open grabe by night, and if I
open him by day, de magistrates dem will hab me up for desecration
ob interment. But I can do dis for you, sah. If you like to wait
till some buckra gentleman die&mdash;John Cann grabe among de white
man side in de grabeyard&mdash;I will dig grabe alongside ob John
Cann one day, so let you come yourself in de night and take what
you like out ob him coffin. I don't go meddle with coffin myself,
to make de John Cann duppy trouble me, and magistrate send me off
about me business.'</p>
<p>It was a risky thing to do, certainly, but Cecil Mitford closed
with it, and promised the man ten pounds if ever he could recover
John Cann's paper. And then he settled down quietly at Leigh
Caymanas with his friendly host, waiting with eager, anxious
expectation&mdash;till some white person should die at Spanish
Town.</p>
<p>What an endless aimless time it seemed to wait before anybody
could be comfortably buried! Black people died by the score, of
course: there was a smallpox epidemic on, and they went to wakes
over one another's dead bodies in wretched hovels among the back
alleys, and caught the infection and sickened and died as fast as
the wildest imagination could wish them; but then, they were buried
apart by themselves in the pauper part of the Cathedral cemetery.
Still, no white man caught the smallpox, and few mulattoes: they
had all been vaccinated, and nobody got ill except the poorest
negroes. Cecil Mitford waited with almost fiendish eagerness to
hear that some prominent white man was dead or dying.</p>
<p>A month, six weeks, two months, went slowly past, and still
nobody of consequence in all Spanish Town fell ill or sickened.
Talk about tropical diseases! why, the place was abominably,
atrociously, outrageously healthy. Cecil Mitford fretted and fumed
and worried by himself, wondering whether he would be kept there
for ever and ever, waiting till some useless nobody chose to die.
The worst of it all was, he could tell nobody his troubles: he had
to pretend to look unconcerned and interested, and listen to all
old Mr. Barclay's stories about Maroons and buccaneers as if he
really enjoyed them.</p>
<p>At last, after Cecil had been two full months at Spanish Town,
he heard one morning with grim satisfaction that yellow fever had
broken out at Port Antonio. Now, yellow fever, as he knew full
well, attacks only white men, or men of white blood: and Cecil felt
sure that before long there would be somebody white dead in Spanish
Town. Not that he was really wicked or malevolent or even unfeeling
at heart; but his wild desire to discover John Cann's treasure had
now overridden every better instinct of his nature, and had
enslaved him, body and soul, till he could think of nothing in any
light save that of its bearing on his one mad imagination. So he
waited a little longer, still more eagerly than before, till yellow
fever should come to Spanish Town.</p>
<p>Sure enough the fever did come in good time, and the very first
person who sickened with it was Cecil Mitford. That was a
contingency he had never dreamt of, and for the time being it drove
John Cann's treasure almost out of his fevered memory. Yet not
entirely, even so, for in his delirium he raved of John Cann and
his doubloons till good old Mr. Barclay, nursing at his bedside
like a woman, as a tender-hearted mulatto always will nurse any
casual young white man, shook his head to himself and muttered
gloomily that poor Mr. Mitford had overworked his brain sadly in
his minute historical investigations.</p>
<p>For ten days Cecil Mitford hovered fitfully between life and
death, and for ten days good old Mr. Barclay waited on him,
morning, noon, and night, as devotedly as any mother could wait
upon her first-born. At the end of that time he began to mend
slowly; and as soon as the crisis was over he forgot forthwith all
about his illness, and thought once more of nothing on earth save
only John Cann's treasure. Was anybody else ill of the fever in
Spanish Town? Yes, two, but not dangerously. Cecil's face fell at
that saving clause, and in his heart he almost ventured to wish it
had been otherwise. He was no murderer, even in thought; but John
Cann's treasure! John Cann's treasure! John Cann's treasure! What
would not a man venture to do or pray, in order that he might
become the possessor of John Cann's treasure?</p>
<p>As Cecil began to mend, a curious thing happened at Leigh
Caymanas, contrary to almost all the previous medical experience of
the whole Island. Mr. Barclay, though a full mulatto, of half-black
blood, suddenly sickened with the yellow fever. He had worn himself
out with nursing Cecil, and the virus seemed to have got into his
blood in a way that it would never have done under other
circumstances. And when the doctor came to see him, he declared at
once that the symptoms were very serious. Cecil hated and loathed
himself for the thought; and yet, in a horrid, indefinite way he
gloated over the possibility of his kind and hospitable friend's
dying. Mr. Barclay had tended him so carefully that he almost loved
him; and yet, with John Cann's treasure before his very eyes, in a
dim, uncertain, awful fashion, he almost looked forward to his
dying. But where would he be buried? that was the question. Not,
surely, among the poor black people in the pauper corner. A man of
his host's distinction and position would certainly deserve a place
among the most exalted white graves&mdash;near the body of Governor
Modyford, and not far from the tomb of John Cann himself.</p>
<p>Day after day Mr. Barclay sank slowly but surely, and Cecil,
weak and hardly convalescent himself, sat watching by his bedside,
and nursing him as tenderly as the good brown man had nursed Cecil
himself in his turn a week earlier. The young clerk was no
hard-hearted wretch who could see a kind entertainer die without a
single passing pang; he felt for the grey old mulatto as deeply as
he could have felt for his own brother, if he had had one. Every
time there was a sign of suffering or feebleness, it went to
Cecil's heart like a knife&mdash;the very knowledge that on one
side of his nature he wished the man to die made him all the more
anxious and careful on the other side to do everything he could to
save him, if possible, or at least to alleviate his sufferings.
Poor old man! it was horrible to see him lying there, parched with
fever and dying by inches; but then&mdash;John Cann's treasure!
John Cann's treasure! John Cann's treasure! every shade that passed
over the good mulatto's face brought Cecil Mitford a single step
nearer to the final enjoyment of John Cann's treasure.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>On the evening when the Hon. Charles Barclay died, Cecil Mitford
went out, for the first time after his terrible illness, to speak a
few words in private with the negro sexton. He found the man
lounging in the soft dust outside his hut, and ready enough to find
a place for the corpse (which would be buried next morning, with
the ordinary tropical haste) close beside the spot actually
occupied by John Cann's coffin. All the rest, the sexton said with
a horrid grin, he would leave to Cecil.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock of a dark moonless night, Cecil Mitford, still
weak and ill, but trembling only from the remains of his fever, set
out stealthily from the dead man's low bungalow in the outskirts of
Spanish Town, and walked on alone through the unlighted, unpaved
streets of the sleeping city to the Cathedral precinct. Not a soul
met or passed him on the way through the lonely alleys; not a
solitary candle burned anywhere in a single window. He carried only
a little dark lantern in his hand, and a very small pick that he
had borrowed that same afternoon from the negro sexton. Stumbling
along through the unfamiliar lanes, he saw at last the great black
mass of the gaunt ungainly Cathedral, standing out dimly against
the hardly less black abyss of night that formed the solemn
background. But Cecil Mitford was not awed by place or season; he
could think only of one subject, John Cann's treasure. He groped
his way easily through scrub and monuments to the far corner of the
churchyard; and there, close by a fresh and open grave, he saw the
well-remembered, half-effaced letters that marked the mouldering
upright slab as John Cann's gravestone. Without a moment's delay,
without a touch of hesitation, without a single tinge of womanish
weakness, he jumped down boldly into the open grave and turned the
light side of his little lantern in the direction of John Cann's
undesecrated coffin.</p>
<p>A few strokes of the pick soon loosened the intervening earth
sufficiently to let him get at a wooden plank on the nearer side of
the coffin. It had mouldered away with damp and age till it was all
quite soft and pliable; and he broke through it with his hand
alone, and saw lying within a heap of huddled bones, which he knew
at once for John Cann's skeleton. Under any other circumstances,
such a sight, seen in the dead of night, with all the awesome
accessories of time and place, would have chilled and appalled
Cecil Mitford's nervous blood; but he thought nothing of it all
now; his whole soul was entirely concentrated on a single
idea&mdash;the search for the missing paper. Leaning over toward
the breach he had made into John Cann's grave, he began groping
about with his right hand on the floor of the coffin. After a
moment's search his fingers came across a small rusty metal object,
clasped, apparently, in the bony hand of the skeleton. He drew it
eagerly out; it was a steel snuff-box. Prising open the corroded
hinge with his pocket-knife, he found inside a small scrap of dry
paper. His fingers trembled as he held it to the dark lantern; oh
heavens, success! success! it was, it was&mdash;the missing
document!</p>
<p>He knew it in a moment by the handwriting and the cypher! He
couldn't wait to read it till he went home to the dead man's house;
so he curled himself up cautiously in Charles Barclay's open grave,
and proceeded to decipher the crabbed manuscript as well as he was
able by the lurid light of the lantern. Yes, yes, it was all right:
it told him with minute and unmistakable detail the exact spot in
the valley of the Bovey where John Cann's treasure lay securely
hidden. Not at John Cann's rocks on the hilltop, as the local
legend untruly affirmed&mdash;John Cann had not been such an
unguarded fool as to whisper to the idle gossips of Bovey the spot
where he had really buried his precious doubloons&mdash;but down in
the valley by a bend of the river, at a point that Cecil Mitford
had known well from his childhood upward. Hurrah! hurrah! the
secret was unearthed at last, and he had nothing more to do than to
go home to England and proceed to dig up John Cann's treasure!</p>
<p>So he cautiously replaced the loose earth on the side of the
grave, and walked back, this time bold and erect, with his dark
lantern openly displayed (for it mattered little now who watched or
followed him), to dead Charles Barclay's lonely bungalow. The black
servants were crooning and wailing over their master's body, and
nobody took much notice of the white visitor. If they had, Cecil
Mitford would have cared but little, so long as he carried John
Cann's last dying directions safely folded in his leather
pocket-book.</p>
<p>Next day, Cecil Mitford stood once more as a chief mourner
beside the grave he had sat in that night so strangely by himself:
and before the week was over, he had taken his passage for England
in the Royal Mail Steamer <i>Tagus</i>, and was leaving the
cocoa-nut groves of Port Royal well behind him on the port side.
Before him lay the open sea, and beyond it, England, Ethel, and
John Cann's treasure.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>It had been a long job after all to arrange fully the needful
preliminaries for the actual search after John Cann's buried
doubloons. First of all, there was Ethel's interest to pay, and a
horrid story for Cecil to concoct&mdash;all false, of course, worse
luck to it&mdash;about how he had managed to invest her poor three
hundred to the best advantage. Then there was another story to make
good about three months' extra leave from the Colonial Office. Next
came the question of buying the land where John Cann's treasure lay
hidden, and this was really a matter of very exceptional and
peculiar difficulty. The owner&mdash;pig-headed
fellow!&mdash;didn't want to sell, no matter how much he was
offered, because the corner contained a clump of trees that made a
specially pretty element in the view from his dining-room windows.
His dining-room windows, forsooth! What on earth could it matter,
when John Cann's treasure was at stake, whether anything at all was
visible or otherwise from his miserable dining-room windows? Cecil
was positively appalled at the obstinacy and narrow-mindedness of
the poor squireen, who could think of nothing at all in the whole
world but his own ridiculous antiquated windows. However, in the
end, by making his bid high enough, he was able to induce this
obstructive old curmudgeon to part with his triangular little
corner of land in the bend of the river. Even so, there was the
question of payment: absurd as it seemed, with all John Cann's
money almost in his hands, Cecil was obliged to worry and bother
and lie and intrigue for weeks together in order to get that paltry
little sum in hard cash for the matter of payment. Still, he raised
it in the end; raised it by inducing Ethel to sell out the
remainder of her poor small fortune, and cajoling Aunt Emily into
putting her name to a bill of sale for her few worthless bits of
old-fashioned furniture. At last, after many delays and vexatious
troubles, Cecil found himself the actual possessor of the corner of
land wherein lay buried John Cann's treasure.</p>
<p>The very first day that Cecil Mitford could call that coveted
piece of ground his own, he could not restrain his eagerness
(though he knew it was imprudent in a land where the unjust law of
treasure-trove prevails), but he must then and there begin covertly
digging under the shadow of the three big willow trees in the bend
of the river. He had eyed and measured the bearings so carefully
already that he knew the very spot to a nail's-breadth where John
Cann's treasure was actually hidden. He set to work digging with a
little pick as confidently as if he had already seen the doubloons
lying there in the strong box that he knew enclosed them. Four feet
deep he dug, as John Cann's instructions told him; and then, true
to the inch, his pick struck against a solid oaken box, well
secured with clamps of iron. Cecil cleared all the dirt away from
the top, carefully, not hurriedly, and tried with all his might to
lift the box out, but all in vain. It was far too heavy, of course,
for one man's arms to raise: all that weight of gold and silver
must be ever so much more than a single pair of hands could
possibly manage. He must try to open the lid alone, so as to take
the gold out, a bit at a time, and carry it away with him now and
again, as he was able, covering the place up carefully in between,
for fear of the Treasury and the Lord of the Manor. How abominably
unjust it seemed to him at that moment&mdash;the legal claim of
those two indolent hostile powers! to think that after he, Cecil
Mitford, had borne the brunt of the labour in adventurously hunting
up the whole trail of John Cann's secret, two idle irresponsible
participators should come in at the end, if they could, to profit
entirely by <i>his</i> ingenuity and <i>his</i> exertions!</p>
<p>At last, by a great effort, he forced the rusty lock open, and
looked eagerly into the strong oak chest. How his heart beat with
slow, deep throbs at that supreme moment, not with suspense, for he
<i>knew</i> he should find the money, but with the final
realisation of a great hope long deferred! Yes, there it lay, in
very truth, all before him&mdash;great shining coins of old Spanish
gold&mdash;gold, gold, gold, arranged in long rows, one coin after
another, over the whole surface of the broad oak box. He had found
it, he had found it, he had really found it! After so much toilsome
hunting, after so much vain endeavour, after so many heart-breaking
disappointments, John Cann's treasure in very truth lay open there
actually before him!</p>
<p>For a few minutes, eager and frightened as he was, Cecil Mitford
did not dare even to touch the precious pieces. In the greatness of
his joy, in the fierce rush of his overpowering emotions, he had no
time to think of mere base everyday gold and silver. It was the
future and the ideal that he beheld, not the piled-up heaps of
filthy lucre. Ethel was his, wealth was his, honour was his! He
would be a rich man and a great man now and henceforth for ever!
Oh, how he hugged himself in his heart on the wise successful fraud
by which he had induced Ethel to advance him the few wretched
hundreds he needed for his ever-memorable Jamaican journey! How he
praised to himself his own courage, and ingenuity, and
determination, and inexhaustible patience! How he laughed down that
foolish conscience of his that would fain have dissuaded him from
his master-stroke of genius. He deserved it all, he deserved it
all! Other men would have flinched before the risk and expense of
the voyage to Jamaica, would have given up the scent for a fool's
errand in the cemetery at Port Royal, would have shrunk from
ransacking John Cann's grave at dead of night in the Cathedral
precincts at Spanish Town, would have feared to buy the high-priced
corner of land at Bovey Tracy on a pure imaginative speculation.
But he, Cecil Mitford, had had the boldness and the cleverness to
do it every bit, and now, wisdom was justified of all her children.
He sat for five minutes in profound meditation on the edge of the
little pit he had dug, gloating dreamily over the broad gold
pieces, and inwardly admiring his own bravery and foresight and
indomitable resolution. What a magnificent man he really
was&mdash;a worthy successor of those great freebooting,
buccaneering, filibustering Devonians of the grand Elizabethan era!
To think that the worky-day modern world should ever have tried to
doom him, Cecil Mitford, with his splendid enterprise and glorious
potentialities, to a hundred and eighty a year and a routine
clerkship at the Colonial Office!</p>
<p>After a while, however, mere numerical cupidity began to get the
better of this heroic mood, and Cecil Mitford turned somewhat
languidly to the vulgar task of counting the rows of doubloons. He
counted up the foremost row carefully, and then for the first time
perceived, to his intense surprise, that the row behind was not
gold, but mere silver Mexican pistoles. He rubbed his eyes and
looked again, but the fact was unmistakable; there was only one row
of yellow gold in the top layer, and all the rest was merely bright
and glittering silver. Strange that John Cann should have put coins
of such small value near the top of his box: the rest of the gold
must certainly be in successive layers down further. He lifted up
the big gold doubloons in the first row, and then, to his blank
horror and amazement, came to&mdash;not more gold, not more silver,
but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;ay, incredible as it seemed,
appalling, horrifying&mdash;a wooden bottom!</p>
<p>Had John Cann, in his care and anxiety, put a layer of solid oak
between each layer of gold and silver? Hardly that, the oak was too
thick. In a moment Cecil Mitford had taken out all the coins of the
first tier, and laid bare the oaken bottom. A few blows of the pick
loosened the earth around, and then, oh horror, oh ghastly
disappointment, oh unspeakable heart-sickening revelation, the
whole box came out entire. It was only two inches deep altogether,
including the cover&mdash;it was, in fact, a mere shallow tray or
saucer, something like the sort of thin wooden boxes in which sets
of dessert-knives or fish-knives are usually sold for wedding
presents!</p>
<p>For the space of three seconds Cecil Mitford could not believe
his eyes, and then, with a sudden flash of awful vividness, the
whole terrible truth flashed at once across his staggering brain.
He had found John Cann's treasure indeed&mdash;the John Cann's
treasure of base actual reality; but the John Cann's treasure of
his fervid imagination, the John Cann's treasure he had dreamt of
from his boyhood upward, the John Cann's treasure he had risked all
to find and to win, did not exist, could not exist, and never had
existed at all anywhere! It was all a horrible, incredible,
unthinkable delusion! The hideous fictions he had told would every
one be now discovered; Ethel would be ruined; Aunt Emily would be
ruined; and they would both know him, not only for a fool, a
dreamer, and a visionary, but also for a gambler, a thief, and a
liar.</p>
<p>In his black despair he jumped down into the shallow hole once
more, and began a second time to count slowly over the accursed
dollars. The whole miserable sum&mdash;the untold wealth of John
Cann's treasure&mdash;would amount altogether to about two hundred
and twenty pounds of modern sterling English money. Cecil Mitford
tore his hair as he counted it in impotent self-punishment; two
hundred and twenty pounds, and he had expected at least as many
thousands! He saw it all in a moment. His wild fancy had mistaken
the poor outcast hunted-down pirate for a sort of ideal criminal
millionaire; he had erected the ignorant, persecuted John Cann of
real life, who fled from the king's justice to a nest of chartered
outlaws in Jamaica, into a great successful naval commander, like
the Drake or Hawkins of actual history. The whole truth about the
wretched solitary old robber burst in upon him now with startling
vividness; he saw him hugging his paltry two hundred pounds to his
miserly old bosom, crossing the sea with it stealthily from
Jamaica, burying it secretly in a hole in the ground at Bovey,
quarrelling about it with his peasant relations in England, as the
poor will often quarrel about mere trifles of money, and dying at
last with the secret of that wretched sum hidden in the snuff-box
that he clutched with fierce energy even in his lifeless skeleton
fingers. It was all clear, horribly, irretrievably, unmistakably
clear to him now; and the John Cann that he had once followed
through so many chances and changes had faded away at once into
absolute nothingness, now and for ever!</p>
<p>If Cecil Mitford had known a little less about John Cann's life
and exploits, he might still perhaps have buoyed himself up with
the vain hope that all the treasure was not yet
unearthed&mdash;that there were more boxes still buried in the
ground, more doubloons still hidden further down in the unexplored
bosom of the little three-cornered field. But the words of John
Cann's own dying directions were too explicit and clear to admit of
any such gloss or false interpretation. 'In a strong oaken chest,
bound round with iron, and buried at four feet of depth in the
south-western angle of the Home Croft, at Bovey,' said the
document, plainly: there was no possibility of making two out of it
in any way. Indeed, in that single minute, Cecil Mitford's mind had
undergone a total revolution, and he saw the John Cann myth for the
first time in his life now in its true colours. The bubble had
burst, the halo had vanished, the phantom had faded away, and the
miserable squalid miserly reality stood before him with all its
vulgar nakedness in their place. The whole panorama of John Cann's
life, as he knew it intimately in all its details, passed before
his mind's-eye like a vivid picture, no longer in the brilliant
hues of boyish romance, but in the dingy sordid tones of sober
fact. He had given up all that was worth having in this world for
the sake of a poor gipsy pirate's penny-saving hoard.</p>
<p>A weaker man would have swallowed the disappointment or kept the
delusion still to his dying day. Cecil Mitford was made of stronger
mould. The ideal John Cann's treasure had taken possession of him,
body and soul; and now that John Cann's treasure had faded into
utter nonentity&mdash;a paltry two hundred pounds&mdash;the whole
solid earth had failed beneath his feet, and nothing was left
before him but a mighty blank. A mighty blank. Blank, blank, blank.
Cecil Mitford sat there on the edge of the pit, with his legs
dangling over into the hollow where John Cann's treasure had never
been, gazing blankly out into a blank sky, with staring blank
eyeballs that looked straight ahead into infinite space and saw
utterly nothing.</p>
<p>How long he sat there no one knows; but late at night, when the
people at the Red Lion began to miss their guest, and turned out in
a body to hunt for him in the corner field, they found him sitting
still on the edge of the pit he had dug for the grave of his own
hopes, and gazing still with listless eyes into blank vacancy. A
box of loose coin lay idly scattered on the ground beside him. The
poor gentleman had been struck crazy, they whispered to one
another; and so indeed he had: not raving mad with acute insanity,
but blankly, hopelessly, and helplessly imbecile. With the loss of
John Cann's treasure the whole universe had faded out for him into
abject nihilism. They carried him home to the inn between them on
their arms, and put him to bed carefully in the old bedroom, as one
might put a new-born baby.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Manor, when he came to hear the whole pitiful
story, would have nothing to do with the wretched doubloons; the
curse of blood was upon them, he said, and worse than that; so the
Treasury, which has no sentiments and no conscience, came in at the
end for what little there was of John Cann's unholy treasure.</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>In the County Pauper Lunatic Asylum for Devon there was one
quiet impassive patient, who was always pointed out to
horror-loving visitors, because he had once been a gentleman, and
had a strange romance hanging to him still, even in that dreary
refuge of the destitute insane. The lady whom he had loved and
robbed&mdash;all for her own good&mdash;had followed him down from
London to Devonshire; and she and her aunt kept a small school,
after some struggling fashion, in the town close by, where many
kind-hearted squires of the neighbourhood sent their little girls,
while they were still very little, for the sake of charity, and for
pity of the sad, sad story. One day a week there was a whole
holiday&mdash;Wednesday it was&mdash;for that was visiting-day at
the County Asylum; and then Ethel Sutherland, dressed in deep
mourning, walked round with her aunt to the gloomy gateway at ten
o'clock, and sat as long as she was allowed with the faded image of
Cecil Mitford, holding his listless hand clasped hard in her pale
white fingers, and looking with sad, eager anxious eyes for any
gleam of passing recognition in his. Alas! the gleam never came
(perhaps it was better so); Cecil Mitford looked always straight
before him at the blank whitewashed walls, and saw nothing, heard
nothing, thought of nothing, from week's end to week's end.</p>
<p>Ethel had forgiven him all; what will not a loving woman
forgive? Nay, more, had found excuses and palliations for him which
quite glossed over his crime and his folly. He must have been
losing his reason long before he ever went to Jamaica, she said;
for in his right mind he would never have tried to deceive her or
himself in the way he had done. Did he not fancy he was sent out by
the Colonial Office, when he had really gone without leave or
mission? And did he not persuade her to give up her money to him
for investment, and after all never invest it? What greater proofs
of insanity could you have than those? And then that dreadful fever
at Spanish Town, and the shock of losing his kind entertainer, worn
out with nursing him, had quite completed the downfall of his
reason. So Ethel Sutherland, in her pure beautiful woman's soul,
went on believing, as steadfastly as ever, in the faith and the
goodness of that Cecil Mitford that had never been. <i>His</i>
ideal had faded out before the first touch of disillusioning fact;
<i>hers</i> persisted still, in spite of all the rudest assaults
that the plainest facts could make upon it. Thank Heaven for that
wonderful idealising power of a good woman, which enables her to
walk unsullied through this sordid world, unknowing and
unseeing.</p>
<p>At last one night, one terrible windy night in December, Ethel
Sutherland was wakened from her sleep in the quiet little
schoolhouse by a fearful glare falling fiercely upon her bedroom
window. She jumped up hastily and rushed to the little casement to
look out towards the place whence the glare came. One thought alone
rose instinctively in her white little mind&mdash;Could it be at
Cecil's Asylum? Oh, horror, yes; the whole building was in flames,
and if Cecil were taken&mdash;even poor mad imbecile
Cecil&mdash;what, what on earth would then be left her?</p>
<p>Huddling on a few things hastily, anyhow, Ethel rushed out
wildly into the street, and ran with incredible speed where all the
crowd of the town was running together, towards the blazing Asylum.
The mob knew her at once, and recognised her sad claim; they made a
little lane down the surging mass for her to pass through, till she
stood beside the very firemen at the base of the gateway. It was an
awful sight&mdash;poor mad wretches raving and imploring at the
windows, while the firemen plied their hose and brought their
escapes to bear as best they were able on one menaced tier after
another. But Ethel saw or heard nothing, save in one third-floor
window of the right wing, where Cecil Mitford stood, no longer
speechless and imbecile, but calling loudly for help, and flinging
his eager arms wildly about him. The shock had brought him back his
reason, for the moment at least: oh, thank God, thank God, he saw
her, he saw her!</p>
<p>With a sudden wild cry Ethel burst from the firemen who tried to
hold her back, leaped into the burning building and tore up the
blazing stairs, blinded and scorched, but by some miracle not quite
suffocated, till she reached the stone landing on the third story.
Turning along the well-known corridor, now filled with black
wreaths of stifling smoke, she reached at last Cecil's ward, and
flung herself madly, wildly into his circling arms. For a moment
they both forgot the awful death that girt them round on every
side, and Cecil, rising one second superior to himself, cried only,
'Ethel, Ethel, Ethel, I love you; forgive me!' Ethel pressed his
hand in hers gently, and answered in an agony of joy, 'There is
nothing to forgive, Cecil; I can die happy now, now that I have
once more heard you say you love me, you love me.'</p>
<p>Hand in hand they turned back towards the blazing staircase, and
reached the window at the end where the firemen were now bringing
their escape-ladder to bear on the third story. The men below
beckoned them to come near and climb out on to the ladder, but just
at that moment something behind seemed incomprehensibly to
fascinate and delay Cecil, so that he would not move a step nearer,
though Ethel led him on with all her might. She looked back to see
what could be the reason, and beheld the floor behind them rent by
the flames, and a great gap spreading downward to the treasurer's
room. On the tiled floor a few dozen pence and shillings and other
coins lay, white with heat, among the glowing rubbish; and the
whole mass, glittering like gold in the fierce glare, seemed some
fiery cave filled to the brim with fabulous wealth. Cecil's eye was
riveted upon the yawning gap, and the corners of his mouth twitched
horribly as he gazed with intense interest upon the red cinders and
white-hot coin beneath him. Instinctively Ethel felt at once that
all was lost, and that the old mania was once more upon him.
Clasping her arm tight round his waist, while the firemen below
shouted to her to leave him and come down as she valued her life,
she made one desperate effort to drag him by main force to the head
of the ladder. But Cecil, strong man that he was, threw her weak
little arm impetuously away, as he might have thrown a two-year-old
baby's, and cried to her in a voice trembling with excitement,
'See, see, Ethel, at last, at last; there it is, there it is in
good earnest. <span class="smcap">John Cann's Treasure!</span>'</p>
<p>Ethel seized his arm imploringly once more. 'This way, darling,'
she cried, in a voice choked by sobs and half stifled with the
smoke. 'This way to the ladder.'</p>
<p>But Cecil broke from her fiercely, with a wild light in his big
blue eyes, and shouting aloud, 'The treasure, the treasure!' leaped
with awful energy into the very centre of the seething fiery abyss.
Ethel fell, fainting with terror and choked by the flames, on to
the burning floor of the third story. The firemen, watching from
below, declared next day that that crazy madman must have died
stifled before he touched the heap of white-hot ruins in the
central shell, and the poor lady was insensible or dead with
asphyxia full ten minutes before the flames swept past the spot
where her lifeless body was lying immovable.</p>

<h3>IVAN GREET'S MASTERPIECE</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>'Twas at supper at Charlie Powell's; every one there admitted
Charlie was in splendid form. His audacity broke the record. He
romanced away with even more than his usual brilliant recklessness.
Truth and fiction blended well in his animated account of his day's
adventures. He had lunched that morning with the newly-appointed
editor of a high-class journal for the home
circle&mdash;circulation exceeding half a million,&mdash;and had
returned all agog with the glorious prospect of untold wealth
opening fresh before him. So he discounted his success by inviting
a dozen friends to champagne and lobster-salad at his rooms in St.
James's, and held forth to them, after his wont, in a rambling
monologue.</p>
<p>'When I got to the house,' he said airily, poising a
champagne-glass halfway up in his hand, 'with the modest
expectation of a chop and a pint of porter in the domestic
ring&mdash;imagine my surprise at finding myself forthwith standing
before the gates of an Oriental palace&mdash;small, undeniably
small, a bijou in its way, but still, without doubt, a veritable
palace. I touched the electric bell. Hi, presto! at my touch the
door flew open as if by magic, and disclosed&mdash;a Circassian
slave, in a becoming costume <i>à la</i> Liberty in Regent Street,
and smiling like the advertisement of a patent dentifrice! I gasped
out&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'But how did ye know she was a Circassian?' Paddy O'Connor
inquired, interrupting him brusquely. (His name was really Francis
Xavier O'Connor, but they called him 'Paddy' for short, just to
mark his Celtic origin.)</p>
<p>Charlie Powell smiled a contemptuously condescending smile. He
was then on the boom, as chief literary lion. 'How do I know ye're
an Oirishman, Paddy?' he answered, hardly heeding the interruption.
'By her accent, my dear boy; her pure, unadulterated Circassian
accent! "Is Mr. Morrison at home?" I gasped out to the Vision of
Beauty. The Vision of Beauty smiled and nodded&mdash;her English
being chiefly confined to smiles, with a Circassian flavour; and
led me on by degrees into the great man's presence. I mounted a
stair, with a stained-glass window all yellows and browns, very
fine and Burne-Jonesey; I passed through a drawing-room in the
Stamboul style&mdash;couches, rugs, and draperies; and after
various corridors&mdash;Byzantine, Persian, Moorish&mdash;I reached
at last a sort of arcaded alcove at the further end, where two men
lay reclining on an Eastern divan&mdash;one, a fez on his head,
pulling hard at a chibouque; the other, bare-headed, burbling smoke
through a hookah. The bare-headed one rose: "Mr. Powell," says he,
waving his hand to present me, "My friend, Macpherson Pasha!" I
bowed, and looked unconcerned. I wanted them to think I'd lived all
my life hobnobbing with Pashas. Well, we talked for a while about
the weather and the crops, and the murder at Mile End, and the
state of Islam; when, presently, of a sudden, Morrison claps his
hands&mdash;so&mdash;and another Circassian slave, still more
beautiful, enters.</p>
<p>'"Lunch, houri," says Morrison.</p>
<p>'"The effendi is served," says the Circassian.</p>
<p>'And down we went to the dining-room. Bombay black-wood, every
inch of it, inlaid with ivory. Venetian glass on the table; solid
silver on the sideboard. Only us three, if you please, to lunch;
but everything as spick and span as if the Prince was of the
company. The three Circassian slaves, in Liberty caps, stood behind
our chairs&mdash;one goddess apiece&mdash;and looked after us
royally. Chops and porter, indeed! It was a banquet for a poet;
Ivan Greet should have been there; he'd have mugged up an ode about
it. Clear turtle and Chablis&mdash;the very best brand; then smelts
and sweetbreads; next lamb and mint sauce; ortolans on toast;
ice-pudding; fresh strawberries. A guinea each, strawberries, I
give you my word, just now at Covent Garden. Oh, mamma! what a
lunch, boys! The Hebes poured champagne from a golden flagon; that
is to say, at any rate'&mdash;for Paddy's eye was upon
him&mdash;'the neck of the bottle was wrapped in gilt tinfoil. And
all the time Morrison talked&mdash;great guns, how he talked! I
never heard anything in my life to equal it. The man's been
everywhere, from Peru to Siberia. The man's been everything, from a
cowboy to a communard. My hair stood on end with half the things he
said to me; and I haven't got hair so easily raised as some
people's. Was I prepared to sell my soul for Saxon gold at the
magnificent rate of five guineas a column? Was I prepared to jump
out of my skin! I choked with delight. Hadn't I sold it all along
to the enemies of Wales for a miserable pittance of thirty
shillings? What did he want me to do? Why, contribute third
leaders&mdash;you know the kind of thing&mdash;tootles on the
penny-trumpet about irrelevant items of non-political
news&mdash;the wit and humour of the fair, best domestic style,
informed throughout with wide general culture. An allusion to
Aristophanes; a passing hint at Rabelais; what Lucian would have
said to his friends on this theme; how the row at the School Board
would have affected Sam Johnson.</p>
<p>'"But you must remember, Mr. Powell," says Morrison, with an
unctuous smile, "the greater part of our readers are&mdash;well,
not to put it too fine&mdash;country squires and conservative
Dissenters. Your articles mustn't hurt their feelings or
prejudices. Go warily, warily! You must stick to the general policy
of the paper, and be tenderly respectful to John Wesley's
memory."</p>
<p>'"Sir," said I, smacking his hand, "for five guineas a column
I'd be tenderly respectful to King Ahab himself, if you cared to
insist upon it. You may count on my writing whatever rubbish you
desire for the nursery mind." And I passed from his dining-room
into the enchanted alcove.</p>
<p>'But before I left, my dear Ivan, I'd heard such things as I
never heard before, and been promised such pay as seemed to me this
morning beyond the dreams of avarice. And oh, what a character!
"When I was a slave at Khartoum," the man said; or "When I was a
schoolmaster in Texas"; "When I lived as a student up five floors
at Heidelberg"; or "When I ran away with Félix Pyat from the
Versaillais"; till I began to think 'twas the Wandering Jew himself
come to life again in Knightsbridge. At last, after coffee and
cigarettes on a Cairo tray&mdash;with reminiscences of
Paraguay&mdash;I emerged on the street, and saw erect before my
eyes a great round Colosseum. I seemed somehow to recognise it.
"This is <i>not</i> Bagdad, then," I said to myself, rubbing my
eyes very hard&mdash;for I thought I must have been wafted some
centuries off, on an enchanted carpet. Then I looked once more.
Yes, sure enough, it <i>was</i> the Albert Hall. And <i>there</i>
was the Memorial with its golden image. I rubbed my eyes a second
time, and hailed a hansom&mdash;for there were hansoms about, and
policemen, and babies. "Thank Heaven!" I cried aloud; "after all,
this <i>is</i> London!"'</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>'It's a most regrettable incident!' Ivan Greet said
solemnly.</p>
<p>The rest turned and looked. Ivan Greet was their poet. He was
tall and thin, with strange, wistful eyes, somewhat furtive in
tone, and a keen, sharp face, and lank, long hair that fell loose
on his shoulders. It was a point with this hair to be always
abnormally damp and moist, with a sort of unnatural and impalpable
moisture. The little coterie, of authors and artists to which Ivan
belonged regarded him indeed with no small respect, as a great man
<i>manqué</i>. Nature, they knew, had designed him for an immortal
bard; circumstances had turned him into an occasional journalist.
But to them, he represented Art for Art's sake. So when Ivan said
solemnly, 'It's a most regrettable incident,' every eye in the room
turned and stared at him in concert.</p>
<p>'Why so, me dear fellow?' Paddy O'Connor asked, open-eyed. 'I
call it magnificent!'</p>
<p>But Ivan Greet answered warmly, 'Because it'll take him still
further away than ever from his work in life, which you and I know
is science and philosophy.'</p>
<p>'And yer own grand epic?' Paddy suggested, with a smart smile,
pouncing down like a hawk upon him.</p>
<p>Ivan Greet coloured&mdash;positively coloured&mdash;'blushed
visibly to the naked eye,' as Paddy observed afterwards, in
recounting the incident to his familiar friend at the United
Bohemians. But he stood his ground like a man and a poet for all
that. 'My own epic isn't written yet&mdash;probably never
<i>will</i> be written,' he answered, after a pause, with quiet
firmness. 'I give up to the <i>Daily Telephone</i> what was meant
for mankind: I acknowledge it freely. Still, I'm sorry when I see
any other good man&mdash;and most of all Charlie
Powell&mdash;compelled to lose his own soul the same way I myself
have done.' He paused and looked round. 'Boys,' he said, addressing
the table, 'in these days, if any man has anything out of the
common to say, he must be rich and his own master, or he won't be
allowed to say it. If he's poor, he has first to earn his living;
and to earn his living he's compelled to do work he doesn't want to
do&mdash;work that stifles the things which burn and struggle for
utterance within him. The editor is the man who rules the
situation; and what the editor asks is good paying matter. Good
paying matter Charlie can give him, of course: Charlie can give
him, thank Heaven, whatever he asks for. But this hack-work will
draw him further and further afield from the work in life for which
God made him&mdash;the philosophical reconstitution of the world
and the universe for the twentieth century. And that's why I
say&mdash;and I say it again&mdash;a most regrettable
incident!'</p>
<p>Charlie Powell set down his glass of champagne untasted. Ivan
Greet was regarded by his narrow little circle of journalistic
associates as something of a prophet; and his words, solemnly
uttered, sobered Charlie for a while&mdash;recalled him with a
bound to his better personality. 'Ivan's right,' he said slowly,
nodding his head once or twice. 'He's right, <i>as</i> usual. We're
all of us wasting on weekly middles the talents God gave us for a
higher purpose. We know it, every man Jack of us. But Heaven help
us, I say, Ivan: for how can we help ourselves? We live by bread.
We must eat bread first, or how can we write epics or philosophies
afterwards? This age demands of us the sacrifice of our
individualities. It will be better some day, perhaps, when Bellamy
and William Morris have remodelled the world: life will be simpler,
and bare living easier. For the present I resign myself to
inevitable fate. I'll write middles for Morrison, and eat and
drink; and I'll wait for my philosophy till I'm rich and bald, and
have leisure to write it in my own hired house in Fitzjohn's
Avenue.'</p>
<p>Ivan Greet gazed across at him with a serious look in those
furtive eyes. 'That's all very well for <i>you</i>!' he cried half
angrily, in a sudden flaring forth of long-suppressed emotion.
'Philosophy can wait till a man's rich and bald; it gains by
waiting; it's the better for maturity. But poetry!&mdash;ah, there,
I hate to talk about it! Who can begin to set about his divine work
when he's turned sixty and worn out by forty years of uncongenial
leaders? The thing's preposterous. A poet must write when he's
young and passionate, or not at all. He may go on writing in age,
of course, as his blood grows cool, if he's kept up the habit, like
Wordsworth and Tennyson: he may even let it lie by or rust for a
time, like Milton or Goethe, and resume it later, if he throws
himself meanwhile, heart and soul, into some other occupation that
carries him away with it resistlessly for the moment; but spend
half his life in degrading his style and debasing his genius by
working for hire at the beck and call of an editor&mdash;lose his
birthright like that, and then turn at last with the bald head you
speak about to pour forth at sixty his frigid lyrics&mdash;I tell
you, Charlie, the thing's impossible! The poet must work, the poet
must acquire his habits of thought and style and expression in the
volcanic period; if he waits till he's crusted over and encysted
with age, he may hammer out rhetoric, he may string fresh rhymes,
but he'll never, never give us one line of real poetry.'</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>He spoke with fiery zeal. It was seldom Ivan Greet had an
outbreak like this. For the most part he acquiesced, like all the
rest of us, in the supreme dictatorship of Supply and
Demand&mdash;those economic gods of the modern book-market. But now
and again rebellious fits came over him, and he kicked against the
pricks with all the angry impetuosity of a born poet. For the rest
of that night he sat moody and silent. Black bile consumed him.
Paddy O'Connor rose and sang with his usual verve the last new
Irish comic song from the music-halls; Fred Mowbray, from Jamaica,
told good stories in negro dialect with his wonted exuberance;
Charlie Powell bubbled over with spirits and epigrams. But Ivan
Greet sat a little apart, with scarcely a smile on his wistful
face; he sat and ruminated. He was angry at heart; the poetic
temperament is a temperament of moods; and each mood, once roused,
takes possession for the time of a man's whole nature. So Ivan
remained angry, with a remorseful anger; he was ashamed of his own
life, ashamed of falling short of his own cherished ideals. Yet how
could he help himself? Man, as he truly said, must live by bread,
though not by bread alone; a sufficiency of food is still a
condition-precedent of artistic creation. You can't earn your
livelihood nowadays by stringing together rhymes, string you never
so deftly; and Ivan had nothing but his pen to earn it with. He had
prostituted that pen to write harmless little essays on social
subjects in the monthly magazines; his better nature recoiled with
horror to-night from the thought of that hateful, that wicked
profanation.</p>
<p>'Twas a noisy party. They broke up late. Fred Mowbray walked
home along Piccadilly with Ivan. It was one of those dull, wet
nights in the streets of London when everything glistens with a
dreary reflection from the pallid gas-lamps. Pah! what weather! To
Fred, West-Indian born, it was utterly hideous. He talked as they
went along of the warmth, the sunshine, the breadth of space, the
ease of living, in his native islands. What a contrast between
those sloppy pavements, thick with yellow mud, and the sun-smitten
hillsides, clad in changeless green, where the happy nigger lay
basking and sprawling all day long on his back in the midst of his
plantain-patches, while the bountiful sun did the hard work of life
for him by ripening his coconuts and mellowing his bananas, unasked
and untended!</p>
<p>Ivan Greet drank it in. As Fred spoke, an idea rose up vague and
formless in the poet's soul. There were countries, then, where
earth was still kindly, and human wants still few; where Nature, as
in the Georgics, supplied even now the primary needs of man's life
unbidden! Surely, in such a land as that a poet yet might live;
tilling his own small plot and eating the fruits of his own slight
toil, he might find leisure to mould without let or hindrance the
thought that was in him into exquisite melody. The bare fancy fired
him. A year or two spent in those delicious climates might enable a
man to turn out what was truest and best in him. He might drink of
the spring and be fed from the plantain-patch, like those wiser
negroes, but he would carry with him still all the inherited wealth
of European culture, and speak like a Greek god under the tropic
shade of Jamaican cotton-trees.</p>
<p>To the average ratepayer such a scheme would appear the veriest
midsummer madness. But Ivan Greet was a poet. Now, a poet is a man
who acts on impulse. And to Ivan the impulse itself was absolutely
sacred. He paused on the slippery pavement, and faced his companion
suddenly. 'How much land does it take there for a man to live
upon?' he asked, with hurried energy.</p>
<p>Fred Mowbray reflected. 'Well, two acres at most, I should say,
down in plantain and yam,' he answered, 'would support a
family.'</p>
<p>'And you can buy it?' Ivan went on, with surprising eagerness.
'I mean, there's lots to be had&mdash;it's always in the
market?'</p>
<p>'Lots to be had? Why, yes! No difficulty there! Half Jamaica's
for sale, on the mountains especially. The island's under-peopled;
our pop's half a million; it'd hold quite three. Land goes for a
mere song; you can buy where you will, quite easily.'</p>
<p>Ivan Greet's lip trembled with intense excitement. A vision of
freedom floated dimly before him. Palms, tree-ferns, bamboos,
waving clumps of tropic foliage; a hillside hut; dusky faces, red
handkerchiefs; and leisure, leisure, leisure to do the work he
liked in! Oh soul, what a dream! You shall say what you will there!
To Ivan that was religion&mdash;all the religion he had perhaps;
for his was, above all things, an artistic nature.</p>
<p>'How much would it cost, do you think?' he inquired, all
tremulous.</p>
<p>And Fred answered airily, 'Well, I fancy not more than a pound
or two an acre.'</p>
<p>A pound or two an acre! Just a column in the <i>Globe</i>. The
gates of Paradise stood open before him!</p>
<p>They walked on a hundred yards or so again in silence. Ivan
Greet was turning over in his seething soul a strange scheme to
free himself from Egyptian bondage. At last he asked once more,
'How much would it cost me to go out by the steerage, if there is
such a thing on the steamers to Jamaica?'</p>
<p>Fred Mowbray paused a moment. 'Well, I should think,' he said at
last, pursing his lips to look wise, 'you ought to do it for about
a tenner.'</p>
<p>Ivan's mind was made up. Those words decided him. While his
mother lived he had felt bound to support her; and the necessity
for doing so had 'kept him straight,' his friends said&mdash;or, as
he himself would have phrased it, had tied him firmly down to
unwilling servitude. But now he had nobody on earth save himself to
consult, for Ethel had married well, and Stephen, dull lad, was
comfortably ensconced in a City office. He went home all on fire
with his new idea. That night he hardly slept; coconuts waved their
long leaves in the breeze before him; dusky hands beckoned him with
strange signs and enticements to come over to a land of sunlight
and freedom. But he was practical too; he worked it all out in his
head arithmetically. So much coming in from this or that magazine;
so much cash in hand; so much <i>per contra</i> for petty debts at
home; so much for outfit, passage-money, purchase. With two acres
of his own he could live like a lord on his yams and plantains.
What sort of food-stuff, indeed, your yam might be he hadn't, to
say the truth, the very faintest conception. But who cares for such
detail? It was freedom he wanted, not the fleshpots of Egypt. And
freedom he would have to work out his own nature.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>There was commotion on the hillside at St. Thomas-in-the-Vale
one brilliant blazing noontide a few weeks later. Clemmy burst upon
the group that sat lounging on the ground outside the hut-door with
most unwonted tidings. 'You hear dem sell dat piece o' land nex'
bit to Tammas?' she cried, all agog with excitement; 'you hear dem
sell it?'</p>
<p>Old Rachel looked up, yawning. 'What de gal a-talking about?'
she answered testily, for old Rachel was toothless. 'Folk all know
dat&mdash;him hear tell long ago. Sell dem two acre las' week,
Peter say, to 'tranger down a' Kingston.'</p>
<p>'Yes, an' de 'tranger come up,' Clemmy burst out, hardly able to
contain herself at so astounding an incident, 'an' what you tink
him is? Him doan't nagur at all! Him reel buckra gentleman!'</p>
<p>A shrill whistle of surprise and subdued unbelief ran sharply
round the little cluster of squatting negroes. 'Him buckra?' Peter
Foddergill repeated to himself, half incredulous. Peter was
Clemmy's stepfather; for Clemmy was a brown girl, and old Rachel,
her mother, was a full-blooded negress. Her paternity was lost in
the dim past of the island.</p>
<p>'Yes, him buckra,' Clemmy repeated in a very firm voice. 'Him
reel white buckra. Him come up to take de land, an' him gwine to
lib dere.'</p>
<p>'It doan't can true!' old Rachel cried, rousing herself. 'It
doan't can possible. Buckra gentleman doan't can come an' lib on
two-acre plot alongside o' black nagur. Him gwine to sell it again;
dat what it is; or else him gwine to gib it to some nagur leeady.
White buckra doan't can lib all alone in St. Tammas.'</p>
<p>But Clemmy was positive. 'No, no,' she cried, unmoved, shaking
her comely brown head, with its crimson bandanna&mdash;for she was
a pretty girl of her sort was Clemmy. 'Him gwine to lib dere. Him
tell me so himself. Him gwine to build hut on it, an' plant it down
in plantain. Him berry pretty gentleman, wit' long hair on him
shoulder; him hab eyes quick and sharp all same like weasel; and
when him smile, him look kinder nor anyting. But him say him come
out from England for good becos him lub better to lib in Jamaica;
an' him gwine to build him hut here, and lib same like nagur.'</p>
<p>In a moment the little cluster of negro hovels was all a-buzz
with conjecture, and hubbub, and wonderment. Only the small black
babies were left sprawling in the dust, with the small black pigs,
beside their mothers' doors, so that you could hardly tell at a
glance which was which, as they basked there; all the rest of the
population, men, women, and children, with that trifling exception,
made a general stampede with one accord for the plot next to
Tammas's. A buckra come to live on the hillside in their midst! A
buckra going to build a little hut like their own! A buckra going
to cultivate a two-acre plot with yam and plantain! They were
aghast with surprise. It was wonderful, wonderful! For Jamaica
negroes don't keep abreast of the Movement, and they didn't yet
know the ways of our latter-day prophets.</p>
<p>As for Ivan Greet himself, he was fairly surprised in turn, as
he stood there in his shirt-sleeves surveying his estate, at this
sudden eruption of good-humoured barbarians. How they grinned and
chattered! What teeth! what animation! He had bought his two acres
with the eye of faith at Kingston from their lawful proprietor,
knowing nothing but their place on the plan set before him. That
morning he had come over by train to Spanish Town, and tramped
through the wondrous defile of the Bog Walk to Linstead, and asked
his way thence by devious bridle-paths to his own new property on
the hillside at St. Thomas. Conveyancing in Jamaica is but an
artless art; having acquired his plot by cash payment on the nail,
Ivan was left to his own devices to identify and demarcate it. But
Tammas's acre was marked on the map in conspicuous blue, and
defined in real life by a most warlike boundary fence of prickly
aloes; while a dozen friendly negroes, all amazement at the sight,
were ready to assist him at once in finding and measuring off the
adjacent piece duly outlined in red on the duplicate plan he had
got with his title-deed.</p>
<p>It was a very nice plot, with a very fine view, in a very sweet
site, on a very green hillside. But Ivan Greet, though young and
strong with the wiry strength of the tall thin Cornishman, was
weary and hot after a long morning's tramp under a tropical sun,
and somewhat taken aback (as well he might be, indeed) at the
strangeness and squalor of his new surroundings. He had pulled off
his coat and laid it down upon the ground; and now he sat on it in
his shirt-sleeves for airiness and coolness. His heart sank for a
moment as he gazed in dismay at the thick and spiky jungle of
tropical scrub he would have to stub up before he could begin to
plant his first yam or banana. That was a point, to say the truth,
which had hardly entered into his calculations beforehand in
England. He had figured to himself the pine-apples and plantains as
a going concern; the coconuts dropping down their ready-made crops;
the bread-fruits eternally ripe at all times and seasons. It was a
shock to him to find mother-earth so encumbered with an alien
growth; he must tickle her with a hoe ere she smiled with a
harvest. Tickle her with a hoe indeed! It was a cutlass he would
need to hack down that matted mass of bristling underbrush.</p>
<p>And how was he to live meanwhile? That was now the question. His
money was all spent save a couple of pounds, for his estimates had
erred, as is the way of estimates, rather on the side of deficiency
than of excess; and he was now left half stranded. But his doubts
on this subject were quickly dispelled by the unexpected
good-nature of his negro neighbours. As soon as those simple folk
began to realise, by dint of question and answer, that the buckra
meant actually to settle down in their midst, and live his life as
they did, their kindliness and their offers of help knew no stint
or moderation. The novelty of the idea fairly took them by storm.
They chuckled and guffawed at it. A buckra from England&mdash;a
gentleman in dress and accent and manner (for negroes know what's
what, and can judge these things as well as you or I can) come of
his own free-will to build a hut like their own, and live on the
tilth of two acres of plantain! It was splendid! it was wonderful!
They entered into the spirit of the thing with true negro zest.
'Hey, massy, dat good now!' They would have done anything for
Ivan&mdash;anything, that is to say, that involved no more than the
average amount of negro exertion.</p>
<p>As for the buckra himself, thus finding himself suddenly in the
midst of new friends, all eager to hear of his plans and
intentions, he came out in his best colours under stress of their
welcome, and showed himself for what he was&mdash;a great-hearted
gentleman. Sympathy always begets sympathy. Ivan accepted their
proffered services with a kindly smile of recognition and
gratitude, which to those good-natured folk seemed most
condescending and generous in a real live white man. The news
spread like wildfire. A buckra had come who loved the nagur. Before
three hours were over every man in the hamlet had formed a high
opinion of Mistah Greet's moral qualities. 'Doan't nebber see
buckra like a' dis one afore,' old Peter murmured musingly to his
cronies on the hillside. 'Him doan't got no pride, 'cep de pride ob
a gentleman. Him talk to you and me same as if he tink us buckra
like him. Hey, massy, massa, him good man fe' true! Wonder what
make him want to come lib at St. Tammas?'</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>That very first day, before the green and gold of tropical
sunset had faded into the solemn grey of twilight, Ivan Greet had
decided on the site of his new hut, and begun to lay the
foundations of a rude wooden shanty with the willing aid of his new
black associates. Half the men of the community buckled to at the
work, and all the women: for the women felt at once a novel glow of
sympathy and unspoken compassion towards the unknown white man with
the wistful eyes, who had come across the great sea to cast in his
lot with theirs under the waving palm-trees. Now, your average
negress can do as much hard labour as an English navvy; and as the
men found the timber and the posts for the corners without money or
price, it came to pass that by evening that day a fair framework
for a wattled hut of true African pattern stood already four-square
to all the airts of heaven in the middle frontage of Ivan Greet's
two acres. But it was roofless, of course, and its walls were still
unbuilt: nothing existed so far but the bare square outline. It had
yet to receive its wattled sides, and to be covered in on top with
a picturesque waterproof thatch of fan-palm. Still, it was a noble
hut as huts went on the hillside. Ivan and his fellow-workers stood
and gazed at it that evening as they struck work for the day with
profound admiration for their own cunning handicraft.</p>
<p>And now came the question where Ivan was to sleep, and what to
do for his supper. He had doubts in his own mind how all this could
be managed. But Clemmy had none; Clemmy was the only brown girl in
the little community, and as such, of course, she claimed and
received an acknowledged precedence. 'I shall have to sleep
<i>somewhere</i>,' Ivan murmured, somewhat ruefully, gazing round
him at the little cluster of half-barbarous cottages. 'But
how&mdash;Heaven help me!'</p>
<p>And Clemmy, nodding her head with a wise little smile, made
answer naturally&mdash;</p>
<p>'You gwine sleep at me fader, sah; we got berry nice room. You
doan't can go an' sleep wit' all dem common nagur dah.'</p>
<p>'I'm not very rich, you know,' Ivan interposed hastily, with
something very like a half-conscious blush&mdash;though, to be
sure, he was red enough already with his unwonted exertion in that
sweltering atmosphere. 'I am not very rich, but I've a little still
left, and I can afford to pay&mdash;well, whatever you think would
be proper&mdash;for bed and board till I can get my own house
up.'</p>
<p>Clemmy waved him aside, morally speaking, with true negro
dignity.</p>
<p>'We <i>invite</i> you, sah,' she said proudly, like a lady in
the land (which she was at St. Thomas). 'When we ax gentleman to
stop, we doan't want nuffin paid for him board and lodgin'. We
offer you de hospitality of our house an' home till your own house
finish. Christen people doan't can do no less dan dat, I hope, for
de homeless 'tranger.'</p>
<p>She spoke with such grave politeness, such unconsciousness of
the underlying humour of the situation, that Ivan, with his quickly
sympathetic poet's heart, raised his hat in return, as he answered
with equal gravity, in the tone he might have used to a great lady
in England&mdash;</p>
<p>'It's awfully kind of you. I appreciate your goodness. I shall
accept with pleasure the hospitality you offer me.'</p>
<p>Old Peter grinned delight from ear to ear. It was a feather in
his cap thus to entertain in his hut the nobility and gentry.
Though, to be sure, 'twas his right, as the acknowledged stepfather
of the only undeniable brown girl in the whole community. For a
brown girl, mark you, serves, to a certain extent, as a patent of
gentility in the household she adorns; she is a living proof of the
fact that the family to which she belongs has been in the habit of
mixing with white society.</p>
<p>'You come along in, sah!' old Peter cried cheerily. 'You tired
wit' dat work. You doan't accustom' to it. White gentleman from
England find de sun berry hot out heah in Jamaica. You take drop 'o
rum, sah, or you like coconut water?'</p>
<p>Ivan modestly preferred the less spirituous liquor to the wine
of the country; so Clemmy, much flattered, and not a little
fluttered, brought out a fresh green coconut, and sliced its top
off before his eyes with one slash of the knife, and poured the
limpid juice (which came forth clear as crystal, not thick and
milky) into a bowl-shaped calabash, which she offered with a
graceful bow for their visitor's acceptance. Ivan seated himself on
the ground just outside the hut as he saw the negroes do (for the
air inside was hot, and close, and stifling), and took with real
pleasure his first long pull at that delicious beverage. 'Why, it's
glorious!' he exclaimed, with unfeigned enthusiasm (for he was hot
and thirsty), turning the empty calabash upside down before his
entertainers' eyes, to let them see he fully appreciated their
rustic attentions. 'Quite different from the coconuts one gets in
London! So fresh, and pure, and cool! It's almost worth coming out
to Jamaica to taste it.'</p>
<p>Clemmy smiled her delight. Was ever buckra so affable! Then she
brought out a spoon&mdash;common pewter, or the like&mdash;which
she wiped on her short skirt with unaffected simplicity, and handed
it to him gravely. After that she gave him the coconut itself, with
the soft jelly inside, which Ivan proceeded to scoop out, and eat
before her eyes with evident relish. A semicircle of admiring
negroes and negresses stood round and looked on&mdash;'Hey, massy,
massa! him da eat de coconut!'&mdash;as though the sight of a white
man taking jelly with a spoon were some startling novelty. Now,
Ivan was modest, as becomes a poet; but he managed to eat on, as
little disconcerted by their attentions as possible; for he saw, if
he was to live for some time among these people, how necessary it
was from the very beginning to conciliate and please them.</p>
<p>The coconut finished, Clemmy produced boiled yam and a little
salt fish; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish, and sat down
by Ivan's side to their frugal supper. Being a brown girl, of
course she could venture on such a liberty with an invited guest;
old Peter and her mother, as two pure-blooded blacks, sat a little
apart from their new friend and their daughter, not to seem too
presumptuous. And still, as Ivan ate, the admiring chorus ran round
the semicircle, 'Hey, massy, but dat fine! hey, massy, but him no
proud! My king! you see him eat! You ebber know buckra do de same
like a' dat afore?'</p>
<p>That night&mdash;his first night in the Jamaican
mountains&mdash;Ivan slept in old Peter's hut. It was narrow and
close, but he opened the wooden window as wide as possible to let
in the fresh air, and lay with his head to it; he was young and
strong, and had a fancy for roughing it. Next morning, early, he
was up with his hosts, and afoot, for his work, while still the
Southern sun hung low in the heavens. Fresh plantains and
bread-fruit, with a draught from a coconut, made up the bill of
fare for his simple breakfast; Ivan thought them not bad, though a
trifle unsatisfying. That day, and several days after, he passed on
his plot; the men&mdash;great hulking blacks&mdash;gave him a
helping hand by fits and starts at his job, though less eagerly
than at first; the women, more faithful to their waif from oversea,
worked on with a will at the wattling and thatching. As for Clemmy,
she took a personal interest in the building from beginning to end;
she regarded it with a vague sort of proprietary pride; she spoke
of it as 'de house' in the very phrase we all of us use ourselves
about the place we're engaged in building or furnishing.</p>
<p>At last, after a fortnight, the hut was finished. The entire
hillside turned out with great joy to celebrate its inauguration.
They lighted a bonfire of the brushwood and scrub they had cleared
off the little blank platform in front of the door; each man
brought his own rum; Ivan spent some five of his hoarded shillings
in supplying refreshments for his assembled neighbours. Such a
house-warming had never before been known in St. Thomas. Till late
that evening little groups sat round the embers and baked yam and
sweet potatoes in the hot wood-ashes. It was after midnight when
the crowd, well drunken, began to disperse. Then they all went
away, one by one&mdash;except Clemmy.</p>
<p>Ivan looked at her inquiringly. She hung her head and
hesitated.</p>
<p>'You tink buckra gentleman can lib alone in house widout
serbant?' she asked, at last, in a very timid tone. 'You doan't
want housekeeper? Buckra must hab some one to cook for him an care
for him. You no' want me to go. I tink I make good
housekeeper.'</p>
<p>'Of course,' Ivan answered, with a gleam of comprehension, 'I
never thought about that. Why, just the right thing. How very kind
of you! I can't cook for myself. I suppose I must have somebody to
manage about boiling the yams and plantains.'</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>So, for eight or ten months, Ivan Greet lived on in his wattled
hut on that Jamaican hillside. He was dead to the world, and the
world to him; he neither wrote to nor heard from any friend in
England. In the local planters' phrase, he simply 'went nigger.'
What little luggage he possessed he had left at Spanish Town
station while he built his hut; as soon as he was fully installed
in his own freehold house, and had got his supplies into working
order, he and Clemmy started off for Spanish Town together, and
brought it back, with much laughter, turn about, between them.
Clemmy bore the big box on her head, whenever her turn came, as she
was accustomed to carry a pail of water. It contained the small
wardrobe he brought out from England, and, more important still,
the pen, ink, and paper with which he was to write&mdash;his
immortal masterpiece.</p>
<p>Not that Ivan was in any hurry to begin his great task. Freedom
and leisure were the keynotes of the situation. He would only set
to work when the impulse came upon him. And just at first neither
freedom nor leisure nor impulse was his. He had his ground to
prepare, his yams and bananas to plant, his daily bread, or daily
bread-fruit, to procure, quite as truly as in England. Though, to
be sure, Clemmy's friends were most generous of their store, with
that unconscious communism of all primitive societies. They offered
what they had, and offered it freely. And Ivan, being a poet,
accepted their gifts more frankly by far than most others could
have done: he would repay them all, he said, with a grateful glance
in those furtive eyes of his, when his crop was ready. The negroes
in turn liked him all the better for that; they were proud to be
able to lend or give to the buckra from England. It raised them no
little in their own esteem to find the white man so willing to chum
with them.</p>
<p>Five or six weeks passed away after Ivan had taken possession of
his hut before he attempted to turn his hand to any literary work.
Meanwhile, he was busily occupied in stubbing and planting, with
occasional help from his negro allies, and the constant aid of
those ever-faithful negresses. Even after he had settled down to a
quiet life under his own vine and fig-tree, some time went past
before the spirit moved him to undertake composition. To say the
truth, this <i>dolce far niente</i> world exactly suited him. Poets
are lazy by nature&mdash;or, shall we put it, contemplative? When
Ivan in England first dreamt of this strange scheme, he looked
forward to it as a noble stroke for faith and freedom, a sacrifice
of his own personal worldly comfort to the work in life that was
set before him. And so, indeed, it was, from the point of view of
the fleshpots of Egypt. But fleshpots, after all, don't fill so
large a place in human existence as civilisation fancies. When he
found himself at last at ease on his hillside, he was surprised to
discover how delightful, how poetical, how elevated is savagery. He
sat all day long on the ground under the plantains, in shirt and
trousers, with Clemmy by his side, or took a turn for exercise now
and again in the cool of the evening through his sprouting yam
plot. Palm-leaves whispered in the wind, mangoes glowed on the
branches, pomegranates cracked and reddened, humming-birds darted
swift in invisible flight from flower to flower of the crimson
hibiscus. What need to hurry in such a land as this, where all the
world at once eats its lotus in harmony?</p>
<p>After a while, however, inspiration came upon him. It came
unsought. It hunted him up and constrained him. He brought forth
pen and paper to the door of the hut, and, sitting there in the
broad shade (Clemmy still at his side), began from time to time to
jot down a sentence, a thought, a phrase, a single word, exactly as
they came to him. He didn't work hard. To work hard, indeed, or, in
other words, to spur his Pegasus beyond its natural pace, was to
Ivan nothing short of sheer worldly infidelity. Literature is the
realisation of one's inmost personality in external form. He wanted
freedom for that very purpose&mdash;that he might write the thing
he would in the way that occurred to him. But slowly, none the
less, a delicate picture grew up by degrees on the canvas before
him. It wasn't a poem: the Muse didn't move him just so to verse,
and he would be true to the core to her. It was a little romance, a
vignette of tropical life, a <i>Paul et Virginie</i> picture of the
folk he saw then and there on the hillside. And, indeed, the
subject exactly suited him. A Bohemian in the grain, the easy,
Bohemian life of these children of nature in their wattled huts
appealed to him vividly. For a month or so now he had lived in
their midst as one of themselves; he had caught their very tone: he
had learned to understand them, to know them, to sympathise with
them. 'I'll tell you what it is, sir,' a dissipated young planter
had said to him at Kingston during the few days he spent there,
'people may say what they like about this blessed island; but what
I say's this, it's a jolly good place to live in, all the same,
where rum is cheap and morals is lax!' Not so did the poet's eye
envisage that black Arcadia.</p>
<p>To Ivan it was an Eden of the Caribbean Seas; he loved it for
its simplicity, its naturalness, its utter absence of guile or wile
or self-consciousness. 'Twas a land indeed where the Queen's writ
ran not; where the moral law bore but feeble sway; where men and
women, as free as the wind, lived and loved in their own
capricious, ancestral fashion. Its ethics were certainly not the
ethics of that hateful Mayfair from which he had fled in search of
freedom. But life was real, if life was not earnest; no sham was
there, no veiled code of pretence; what all the world did all the
world frankly and openly acknowledged. Censors and censoriousness
were alike unknown. Every man did that which was right in his own
eyes, and no man hindered him. In such an environment what space
for idylls! Never, since Theocritus, had poet's eye beheld anything
like it. In the midst of this <i>naïf</i> world he so thoroughly
understood and so deeply appreciated Ivan Greet couldn't help but
burst into song, or at least into romance of Arcadian pattern. Day
by day he sat at the door of his hut, or strolled through the
hamlet, with a nod and a smile for black Rose or black Robert,
noting as he went their little words and ways, jotting mentally
down on the tablets of his brain each striking phrase or tone or
native pose or incident. So his idyll took shape of itself, he
hardly knew how. It was he that held the pen; it was Nature herself
that dictated the plot, the dialogue, the episodes.</p>
<p>In the evenings, whenever the fancy seized him, he would sit and
read aloud what he had written during the day to his companion
Clemmy. There, in the balmy glow of tropical dusk, with the sunset
lighting up in pink or purple the page as he read it, and the
breeze rustling soft through the golden leaves of the star-apple,
that simple tale of a simple life was uttered and heard in its
native world, to the fullest advantage. But Clemmy! As for Clemmy,
she sat entranced; was there ever so grand a man on earth as Ivan?
Never before had that brown girl known there was anything other in
the way of books than the Bible, the hymn-book, and the A B C in
which she learned to read at the negro village-school down yonder
at Linstead. And now, Ivan's tale awoke a new interest, a fresh
delight within her. She understood it all the better in that it was
a truthful tale of her own land and her own people. Time, place,
surroundings, all were wholly familiar to her. It made her laugh a
low laugh of surprise and pleasure to see how Ivan hit off with one
striking phrase, one deft touch, one neat epithet, the people and
things she had known and mixed with from her earliest childhood. In
a word, it was Clemmy's first glimpse into literature. Now, Clemmy
was a brown girl, and clever at that. European blood of no mean
strain flowed in her veins&mdash;the blood of an able English naval
family. Till Ivan came, indeed, she had lived the life and thought
the thoughts of the people around her. But her new companion
wakened higher chords, unsuspected by herself, in her inner nature.
She revelled in his idyll. Oh, how sweet they were, those evenings
on the hillside, when Ivan took her into his confidence, as it
were, and poured forth into her ear that dainty tale that would
have fallen so flat on the dull ears of her companions! For Clemmy
knew now she was better than the rest. She had always prided
herself, of course, like every brown girl, on her ennobling mixture
of European blood; though she never knew quite why. This book
revealed it to her. She realised now how inheritance had given her
something that was wanting to the black girls, her playmates, in
the village. She and Ivan were one in one-half their natures.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>Ten months passed away. Working by fits and starts, as the mood
came upon him, Ivan Greet completed and repolished his masterpiece.
It was but a little thing, yet he knew it was a masterpiece. Every
word and line in it pleased and satisfied him. And when <i>he</i>
was satisfied, he knew he had reckoned with his hardest critic. He
had only to send it home to England now, and get it published. For
the rest, he cared little. Let men read it or not, let them praise
or blame, he had done a piece of work at last that was worthy of
him.</p>
<p>And Clemmy admired it more than words could fathom. Though she
spoke her own uncouth dialect only, she could understand and
appreciate all that Ivan had written&mdash;for Ivan had written it.
Those ten months of daily intercourse with her poet in all moods
had been to Clemmy a liberal education. Even her English improved,
though that was a small matter; but her point of view widened and
expanded unspeakably. It was the first time she had ever been
brought into contact with a higher nature. And Ivan was so kind, so
generous, so sympathetic. In one word, he treated her as he would
treat a lady. Accustomed as she was only to the coarsely
good-natured blacks of her hamlet, Clemmy found an English
gentleman a wonderfully lovable and delightful companion. She knew,
of course, he didn't <i>love</i> her&mdash;that would be asking too
much; but he was tender and gentle to her, as his poet's heart
would have made him be to any other woman under like conditions.
Sometimes the girls in the village would ask her in confidence,
'You tink him lub you, Clemmy? You tink de buckra lub you?'</p>
<p>And Clemmy, looking coy, and holding her head on one side, would
answer, in the peculiar Jamaican sing-song, 'Him mind on him book.
Him doan't tink ob dem ting. Him mind too full. Him doan't tink to
lub me.'</p>
<p>But Clemmy loved <i>him</i>&mdash;deeply, devotedly. When a
woman of the lower races loves a man of the higher, she clings to
him with the fidelity of a dog to its master. Clemmy would have
died for Ivan Greet; her whole life was now bound up in her
Englishman. His masterpiece was to her something even more divine
than to Ivan himself; she knew by heart whole pages and passages of
it.</p>
<p>In this delicious idyllic dream&mdash;a dream of young love
satisfied (for Clemmy didn't ask such impossibilities from fate as
that Ivan should love her as she loved him)&mdash;those happy
months sped away all too fast, till Ivan's work was finished. On
the morning of the day before he meant to take it in to the post at
Spanish Town, and send it off, registered, to his friends in
England, he walked out carelessly barefooted&mdash;so negro-like
had he become&mdash;among the deep dew on the grass in front of his
shanty. Clemmy caught sight of him from the door, and shook her
head gravely.</p>
<p>'If you was my pickney, Ivan,' she said, with true African
freedom, 'I tell you what I do: I smack you for dat. You gwine to
take de fever!'</p>
<p>Ivan laughed, and waved his hand.</p>
<p>'Oh, no fear,' he cried lightly. 'I'm a Jamaican born by now.
I've taken to the life as a duck takes to the water. Besides, it's
quite warm, Clemmy. This dew won't hurt me.'</p>
<p>Clemmy thought no more of it at the time, though she went in at
once, and brought out his shoes and socks, and made him put them on
with much womanly chiding. But that night, after supper, when she
took his hand in hers, as was her wont of an evening, she drew back
in surprise.</p>
<p>'Why, Ivan,' she cried, all cold with terror, 'your hand too
hot! You done got de fever!'</p>
<p>'Well, I don't feel quite the thing,' Ivan admitted grudgingly.
'I've chills down my back and throbbing pain in my head. I think
I'll turn in and try some quinine, Clemmy.'</p>
<p>Clemmy's heart sank at once. She put him to bed on the rough
sack in the hut that served for a mattress, and sent Peter post
haste down to Linstead for the doctor. It was hours before he came;
he was dining with a friend at a 'penn' on the mountains; he
wouldn't hurry himself for the 'white trash' who had 'gone nigger'
on the hillside. Meanwhile Clemmy sat watching, all inward horror,
by Ivan's bedside. Long before the doctor arrived her Englishman
was delirious. Tropical diseases run their course with appalling
rapidity. By the time the doctor came he looked at the patient with
a careless eye. All the world round about had heard of the white
man who 'lived with the niggers,' and despised him accordingly.</p>
<p>'Yellow fever,' he said calmly, in a very cold voice. 'He can't
be moved, and he can't be nursed here. A pretty piggery this for a
white man to die in!'</p>
<p>Clemmy clasped her hands hard.</p>
<p>'To die in!' she echoed aloud. 'To die in! To die in!'</p>
<p>'Well, he's not likely to <i>live</i>, is he?' the doctor
answered, with a sharp little laugh. 'But we'll do what we can. He
must be nursed day and night, and kept cool and well-aired, and
have arrowroot and brandy every half-hour, awake or asleep&mdash;a
couple of teaspoonfuls. I suppose you can get some other girl to
help you sit up with him?'</p>
<p>To help her sit up with him! Clemmy shuddered at the thought.
She would have sat up with him herself every night for a century.
What was sleep or rest to her when Ivan was in danger! For the next
three days she never moved from his side except to make fresh
arrowroot by the fire outside the hut, or to bring back a calabash
of clear water from the rivulet. But how could nursing avail? The
white man's constitution was already broken down by the hardships
and bad food, nay, even by the very idleness of the past ten
months; and that hut was, indeed, no fit place to tend him in. The
disease ran its course with all its fatal swiftness. From the very
first night Ivan never for a moment recovered consciousness. On the
second he was worse. On the third, with the suddenness of that
treacherous climate, a tropical thunderstorm burst over them
unawares. It chilled the air fast. Before it had rained itself out
with peal upon peal and flash upon flash, in quick succession, Ivan
Greet had turned on his side and died, and Clemmy sat alone in the
hut with a corpse, and her unborn baby.</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>For a week or two the world was a blank to Clemmy. She knew only
one thing&mdash;that Ivan had left her two sacred legacies. To
print his book, to bring up his child&mdash;those were now the
tasks in life set before her. From the very first moment she
regarded the manuscript of his masterpiece with the profoundest
reverence. Even before six stalwart negroes in their Sunday clothes
came to bury her dead poet on the slope of the hillside under a
murmuring clump of feathery bamboos, she had taken out that
precious bundle of papers from Ivan's box in the corner, which
served as sofa in the bare little shanty, and had wrapped it up
tenderly in his big silk handkerchief, and replaced it with care,
and locked up the box again, and put the key, tied by a string,
round her neck on her own brown bosom. And when Ivan was gone for
ever, and her tears were dry enough, she went to that box every
night and morning, and unrolled the handkerchief reverently, and
took out the unprinted book, and read it here and there&mdash;with
pride and joy and sorrow&mdash;and folded it up again and replaced
it in its ark till another evening. She knew nothing of
books&mdash;till this one; it had never even struck her they were
the outcome of human brains and hands: but she knew it was her
business in life now to publish it. Ivan Greet was gone, and, but
for those two legacies he left behind him, she would have wished to
die&mdash;she would have died, as negroes can, by merely wishing
it. But now she couldn't. She must live for his child; she must
live for his idyll. It was a duty laid upon her. She knew not
how&mdash;but somehow, some time, she must get that book
printed.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, her baby was born. As it lay on her lap, a
dear, little, soft, round, creamy-brown girl&mdash;hardly brown at
all, indeed, but a delicate quadroon, with deep chestnut hair and
European features&mdash;she loved it in her heart for its father's
sake chiefly. It was Ivan's child, made in Ivan's likeness. They
christened it Vanna; 'twas the nearest feminine form she could
devise to Ivan. But even the baby&mdash;her baby, his
baby&mdash;seemed hardly more alive to Clemmy herself than the
manuscript that lay wrapped with scented herbs and leaves in the
box in the corner. For that was all Ivan's, and it spoke to her
still with his authentic voice&mdash;his own very words, his tone,
his utterance. Many a time she took it out, as baby lay asleep,
with tender eyelids closed, on the bed where Ivan had died (for
sanitary science and knowledge of the germ theory haven't spread
much as yet to St. Thomas-in-the-Vale) and read it aloud in her own
sing-song way, and laughed and cried over it, and thought to
herself, time and again, '<i>He</i> wrote all that! How wonderful!
How beautiful!'</p>
<p>As soon as ever she was well enough, after baby came, Clemmy
took that sacred manuscript, reverently folded still in its soft
silk handkerchief, among its fragrant herbs, and with baby at her
breast, trudged by herself along the dusty road, some twenty-five
miles, all the way into Kingston. It was a long, hot walk, and she
was weak and ill; but Ivan's book must be printed, let it cost her
what it might; she would work herself to death, but she must manage
to print it. She knew nothing of his family, his friends in
England; she knew nothing of publishing, or of the utter futility
of getting the type set at a Kingston printing-office; she only
knew this&mdash;that Ivan wrote that book, and that, before he
died, he meant to get it printed. After a weary trudge, buoyed only
by vague hopes of fulfilling Ivan's last wish, she reached the
baking streets of the grim white city. To her that squalid seaport
seemed a very big and bustling town. Wandering there by herself,
alone and afraid, down its unwonted thoroughfares, full of black
men and white, all hurrying on their own errands, and all equally
strange to her, she came at last to Henderson's, the printer's.
With a very timid air, she mustered up courage to enter the shop,
and unfolded with trembling fingers her sacred burden. The printer
stared hard at her. 'Not your own, I suppose?' he said, turning it
over with a curious eye, like any common manuscript, and evidently
amused at the bare idea of a book by an up-country brown girl.</p>
<p>And Clemmy, half aghast that any man should touch that holy
relic so lightly, made answer very low, 'No, not me own. Me fren's.
Him dead, and I want to know how much you ax to print him.'</p>
<p>The man ran his eye through it, and calculated roughly. 'On
paper like this,' he said, after jotting down a few figures, 'five
hundred copies would stand you in something like five-and-thirty
pounds, exclusive of binding.'</p>
<p>Five-and-thirty pounds! Clemmy drew a long breath. It was
appalling, impossible. 'You haven't got so much about you, I
suppose!' the printer went on, with a laugh. Clemmy's eyes filled
with tears. Five-and-thirty pounds! And a brown girl! Was it
likely?</p>
<p>'I doan't want it print jes' yet,' she answered, with an effort,
hardly keeping back her tears. 'I only come to ax&mdash;walk in all
de way from St. Tammas-in-de-Vale, so make me tired. Bime-by,
p'raps, I print him&mdash;when I done got de money. I doan't got it
jes' yet&mdash;but I'm gwine home to get it.'</p>
<p>And home she went, heavy-hearted; home she went to get it.
Five-and-thirty pounds, but she meant to earn it. Tramp, tramp,
tramp, she trudged along to St. Thomas. Between the pestilential
lagoons on the road to Spanish Town she thought it all out. Before
she reached the outskirts, with her baby at her breast, she had
already matured her plan of campaign for the future. Come what
might, she must make enough money to print Ivan Greet's
masterpiece. She was only a brown girl, but she was still in
possession of the two-acre plot; and possession is always nine
points of the law, in Jamaica as in England. Indeed, with her
simple West Indian notions of proprietorship and inheritance,
Clemmy never doubted for a moment they were really her own, as much
as if she were Ivan's lawful widow. Nobody had yet come to disturb
or evict her; nobody had the right, in Jamaica at least: for Ivan
Greet's heirs, executors, and assigns slumbered at peace, five
thousand miles away, oversea in England. So, as Clemmy tramped on,
along the dusty high-road, and between the malarious swamps, and
through the grey streets of dismantled Spanish Town, and up the
grateful coolness of the Rio Cobre ravine to her home in St.
Thomas, she said to herself and to his baby at her breast a
thousand times over how she would toil and moil, and save and
scrape, and earn money to print his last work at last as he meant
it to be printed.</p>
<h3>IX</h3>
<p>And she worked with a will. She didn't know it was a heroic
resolve on her part; she only knew she had got to do it. She
planted yam and coffee and tobacco. Coffee and tobacco need higher
cultivation than the more thriftless class of negroes usually care
to bestow upon them; but Clemmy was a brown girl, and she worked as
became the descendant of so many strenuous white ancestors. She
could live herself on the yams and bread-fruit; when her crop was
ripe she could sell the bananas and coffee and tobacco, and hoard
up the money she got in a belt round her waist, for she never could
trust all that precious coin away from her own person.</p>
<p>From the day of her return, she worked hard with a will; and on
market-days she trudged down with her basket on her head and her
baby in her arms to sell her surplus produce in Linstead market.
Every quattie she earned she tied up tight in the girdle round her
waist. When the quatties reached eight she exchanged them for a
shilling&mdash;one shilling more towards the thirty-five pounds it
would cost her to print Ivan Greet's last idyll! The people in St.
Thomas were kind to Clemmy. 'Him doan't nebber get ober de buckra
deat',' they said. 'Him take it berry to heart. Him lub him fe'
true, dat gal wit' de buckra!' So they helped her still, as they
had helped Ivan in his lifetime. Many a one gave her an hour's work
at her plot when the drought threatened badly, or aided her to get
in her yams and sweet potatoes before the rainy season.</p>
<p>Clemmy was an Old Connexion Baptist. They all belonged to the
Old Connexion in the Linstead district. Your negro is strong on
doctrinal theology, and he likes the practical sense of sins
visibly washed away by total immersion. It gives him a comfortable
feeling of efficient regeneration which no mere infant sprinkling
could possibly emulate. One morning, on the hillside, as Clemmy
stood in her plot by a graceful clump of waving bamboos, hacking
down with her cutlass the weeds that encumbered her precious
coffee-bushes&mdash;the bushes that were to print Ivan Greet's last
manuscript&mdash;of a sudden the minister rode by on his mountain
pony&mdash;sleek, smooth-faced, oleaginous, the very picture and
embodiment of the well-fed, negro-paid, up-country missionary. He
halted on the path&mdash;a mere ledge of bridle-track&mdash;as he
passed where she stood bending down at her labour.</p>
<p>'Hey, Clemmy,' the minister cried in his half-negro
tone&mdash;for, though an Englishman born, he had lived among his
flock on the mountains so long that he had caught at last its very
voice and accent&mdash;'they tell me this good-for-nothing white
man's dead who lived in the hut here. Perhaps it was better so!
Instead of trying to raise and improve your people, he had sunk
himself to their lowest level. So you've got his hut now! And what
are you doing, child, with the coffee and tobacco?'</p>
<p>Clemmy's face burned hot; this was sheer desecration! The flush
almost showed through her dusky brown skin, so intense was her
indignant wrath at hearing her dead Ivan described by that sleek
fat creature as a 'good-for-nothing white man.' But she answered
back bravely, 'Him good friend to me fe' true, sah. I doan't know
nuffin 'bout what make him came heah, but I nebber see buckra treat
nagur anywhere same way like he treat dem. An' I lubbed him true.
And I growin' dem crop dah to prin' de book him gone left behind
him.'</p>
<p>The minister reflected. This was sheer contumacy. 'But the
land's not yours,' he said testily. 'It belongs to the man's
relations&mdash;his heirs or his creditors. Unless of course,' he
added, after a pause, just to make things sure, 'he left it by will
to you.'</p>
<p>'No, sah, him doant make no will,' Clemmy answered, trembling,
'an' him doan't leave it to anybody. But I lib on de land while
Ivan lib, an' I doan't gwine to quit it for no one on eart' now him
dead and buried.'</p>
<p>'You were his housekeeper, I think,' the minister went on,
musing.</p>
<p>And Clemmy, adopting that usual euphemism of the country where
such relations are habitual, made answer, hanging her head, 'Yes,
sah, I was him housekeeper.'</p>
<p>'What was his name?' the minister asked, taking out a small
notebook.</p>
<p>'Dem call him Ivan Greet,' Clemmy answered incautiously.</p>
<p>'Ivan Greet,' the minister repeated, stroking his smooth double
chin and reflecting inwardly. 'Ivan Greet! Ivan Greet! No doubt a
Russian!... Well, Clemmy, you must remember, this land's not yours;
and if only we can find out where Ivan Greet belonged, and write to
his relations&mdash;which is, of course, our plain
duty&mdash;you'll have to give it up and go back to your father.'
He shook his pony's reins. 'Get up, Duchess! 'he cried calmly.
'Good morning, Clemmy; good morning.'</p>
<p>'Marnin', sah,' Clemmy answered, with a vague foreboding, her
heart standing still with chilly fear within her.</p>
<p>But, as soon as the minister's ample back was turned, she laid
down her cutlass, took up little Vanna from the ground beside her,
pressed the child to her breast, and rushed with passionate tears
to the box in the hut that contained, in many folds, <i>his</i>
precious manuscript. She took the key from her neck, and unlocked
it eagerly. Then she brought forth the handkerchief, unwound it
with care, and stared hard through her tears at that sacred
title-page. His relations indeed! Who was nearer him than herself?
Who had ever so much right to till that plot of land as she who was
the guardian of his two dying legacies? She would use it to feed
his child, and to print his last book. She could kill his own folk
if they came there to take it from her!</p>
<h3>X</h3>
<p>For weeks and weeks after that, Clemmy worked on in fear and
trembling. Would Ivan's friends come out to claim that precious
plot from her&mdash;the plot that was to publish his immortal
masterpiece? For she knew it was immortal; had not Ivan himself,
while he read it, explained so much to her? But slowly she plucked
up heart, as week after week passed away undisturbed, and no
interloper come to destroy her happiness. She began to believe the
minister had said rather more than he meant; he never had written
at all to Ivan's folk in England. Month after month slipped away;
and the mango season came, and the tobacco leaves were picked in
good condition and sold, and the coffee-berries ripened. Negro
friends passed her hut, nodding kindly salute. 'You makin' plenty
money, Clemmy? You sell de leaf dear? Hey, but de pickney look
well? Him farder proud now if him can see de pickney.'</p>
<p>At last the rainy season was over, and the rivers were full.
Mosquito larvæ swarmed and wriggled by thousands in the shallow
lagoons; and when they got their wings, the sea-breeze drove them
up in countless numbers to the deep basin of St. Thomas, a
lake-like expanse in the central range ringed round by a continuous
amphitheatre of very high mountains. They were a terrible plague,
those mosquitoes; they drove poor little Vanna half wild with pain
and terror. A dozen times in the night the tender little creature
woke crying from their bites. Clemmy stretched a veil over her
face, but that made little difference. Those wretched mosquitoes
bit right through the veil. Clemmy didn't know where to turn to
protect her baby.</p>
<p>'Him buckra baby; dat what de matter,' old Rachel suggested
gravely. 'Nagur baby doan't feel de 'skeeter bite same like o'
buckra. Nagur folk and 'skeeter belong all o' same country. But
buckra doan't hab no 'skeeter in England. Missy Queen doan't 'low
dem. Now dis 'ere chile buckra&mdash;tree part buckra an' one part
nagur. Dat what for make him so much feel de 'skeeter.'</p>
<p>'But what can I do for 'top him, marra?' Clemmy inquired
despondently.</p>
<p>'It only one way,' old Rachel answered, with a very sage face,
'burn smudge before de door. Dat drive away 'skeeter.'</p>
<p>Now a smudge is a fresh-cut turf of aromatic peaty marsh
vegetation; you light it before the hut, where it smoulders slowly
during the day and evening, and the smoke keeps the mosquitoes from
entering the place while the door stands open. Clemmy tried the
smudge next day, and found it most efficacious. For two or three
nights little Vanna slept peacefully. Old Rachel nodded her
head.</p>
<p>'Keep him burning,' she advised, 'till de water dry up, an' de
worm, dem kill, and it doan't no more 'skeeter.'</p>
<p>Clemmy followed her mother's advice to the letter in this
matter. Each morning when she went out to work on her plot, with
little Vanna laid tenderly in her one shawl on the ground close by,
she lighted the smudge and kept it smouldering all day, renewing it
now and again as it burnt out through the evening. On Thursday, as
was her wont, she went down with her goods to Linstead to market.
On her head she carried her basket of 'bread-kind'&mdash;that is to
say, yam, and the other farinaceous roots or fruits which are to
the negro what wheaten bread is to the European peasant. She walked
along erect, with the free, swinging gait peculiar to her
countrywomen, untrammelled by stays and the other abominations of
civilised costume; little Vanna on her arm crowed and gurgled
merrily. 'Twas a broiling hot day, but Clemmy's heart was lighter.
Was there ever such a treasure as that fair little Vanna, whitest
of quadroons?&mdash;and she was saving up fast for the second of
those thirty-five precious pounds towards printing Ivan's
manuscript!</p>
<p>In the market-place at Linstead she sat all day among the
chattering negresses, who chaffered for quatties, with white teeth
displayed, or higgled over the price of bread-fruit and plantain.
'Tis a pretty scene, one of these tropical markets, with its
short-kirtled black girls, bare-legged and barefooted, in their
bright cotton gowns and their crimson bandannas. Before them stand
baskets of golden mangoes and purple star-apples; oranges lie piled
in little pyramids on the ground; green shaddocks and great slices
of pink-fleshed water-melon tempt the thirsty passer-by with their
juicy lusciousness. Over all rises the constant din of shrill
African voices; 'tis a perfect saturnalia of hubbub and noise,
instinct with bright colour and alive with merry faces.</p>
<p>So Clemmy sat there all day, enjoying herself after her fashion,
in this weekly gathering of all the society known to her. For the
market-place is the popular negro substitute for the At Homes and
Assembly Rooms of more civilised communities. Vanna crowed with
delight to see the little black babies in their mother's arms, and
the pretty red tomatoes scattered around loose among the gleaming
oranges. It was late when Clemmy rose to go home to her hamlet. She
trudged along, gaily enough, with her laughing companions; more
than a year had passed now since Ivan's death, and at times, in the
joy of more money earned for him, she could half forget her great
grief for Ivan. The sun was setting as she reached her own plot.
For a moment her heart came up into her mouth. Then she started
with a cry. She gazed before her in blank horror. The hut had
disappeared! In its place stood a mass of still smouldering
ashes.</p>
<p>In one second she understood the full magnitude of her loss, and
how it had all happened. With a woman's quickness she pictured it
to herself by pure instinct. The smudge had set fire to the clumps
of dry grass by the door of the hut; the grass had lighted up the
thin wattle and palm thatch; and once set afire, on that sweltering
day, her home had burnt down to the ground like tinder.</p>
<p>Two or three big negroes stood gazing in blank silence at the
little heap of ruins&mdash;or rather of ash, for all was now
consumed to a fine white powder. Clemmy rushed at them headlong
with a wild cry of suspense. 'You save de box?' she faltered out in
her agony. 'You save de box? You here when it burning?'</p>
<p>'Nobody doan't see till him all in a blaze,' one young negro
replied in a surly voice, as negroes use in a moment of disaster;
'an' den, when we see, we doan't able to do nuffin.'</p>
<p>Clemmy laid down her child. 'De box, de box!' she cried in a
frenzied voice, digging down with tremulous hands into the smoking
ashes. The square form of the hut was still rudely preserved by the
pile of white powder, and she knew in a moment in which corner to
look for it. But she dug like a mad creature. Soon all was
uncovered. The calcined remains of Ivan's clothes were there, and a
few charred fragments of what seemed like paper. And that was all.
The precious manuscript itself was utterly destroyed. Ivan Greet's
one Masterpiece was lost for ever.</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p>Clemmy crouched on the ground with her arms round her knees. She
sat there cowering. She was too appalled for tears; her eyes were
dry, but her heart was breaking.</p>
<p>For a minute or two she crouched motionless in deathly silence.
Even the negroes held their peace. Instinctively they divined the
full depth of her misery.</p>
<p>After a while she rose again, and took Vanna on her lap. The
child cried for food, and Clemmy opened her bosom. Then she sat
there long beside the ruins of her hut. Negresses crowded round and
tried in vain to comfort her. How could they understand her loss?
They didn't know what it meant: for in that moment of anguish
Clemmy felt herself a white woman. They spoke to her of the hut.
The hut! What to her were ten thousand palaces! If you had given
her the King's House at Spanish Town that night it would have been
all the same. Not the roof over her head, but Ivan Greet's
manuscript.</p>
<p>She rocked herself up and down as she cowered on the ground, and
moaned inarticulately. The rocking and moaning lulled Vanna to
sleep. His child was now all she had left to live for. For hours
she crouched on the bare ground, never uttering a word: the
negresses sat round, and watched her intently. Now and again old
Rachel begged her to come home to her stepfather's hut; but Clemmy
couldn't stir a step from those sacred ashes. It grew dark and
chilly, for Ivan Greet's plot stood high on the mountain. One by
one the negresses dropped off to their huts; Clemmy sat there
still, with her naked feet buried deep in the hot ash, and Ivan
Greet's baby clasped close to her bosom.</p>
<p>At last with tropical unexpectedness, a great flash of lightning
blazed forth, all at once, and showed the wide basin and the
mountains round as distinct as daylight. Instantly and
simultaneously a terrible clap of thunder bellowed aloud in their
ears. Then the rain-cloud burst. It came down in a single sheet
with equatorial violence.</p>
<p>Old Rachel and the few remaining negresses fled home. They
seized Clemmy's arm, and tried to drag her; but Clemmy sat dogged,
and refused to accompany them. Then they started and left her. All
night long the storm raged, and the thunder roared awesomely. Great
flashes lighted up swaying stems of coconuts and bent clumps of
bamboo; huge palms snapped short like reeds before the wind; loud
peals rent the sky with their ceaseless artillery. And all night
long, in spite of storm and wind, the rain pelted down in one
unending flood, as though it poured by great leaks from some
heavenly reservoir.</p>
<p>Torrents tore down the hills; many huts were swept away; streams
roared and raved; devastation marked their track; 'twas a carnival
of ruin, a memorable hurricane. Hail rattled at times; all was
black as pitch, save when the lightning showed everything more
vivid than daylight. But Clemmy sat on, hot at heart with her
agony.</p>
<p>When morning dawned, the terrified negroes, creeping forth from
their shanties, found her still on her plot, crouching close over
<i>his</i> child, but stiff and stark and cold and lifeless. Her
bare feet had dug deep in the ashes of Ivan's hut, now washed by
the rain to a sodden remnant. Little Vanna just breathed in her
dead mother's arms. Old Rachel took her.</p>
<p>And that's why the world has never heard more of Ivan Greet's
Masterpiece.</p>

<h3>THE CHURCHWARDEN'S BROTHER</h3>
<p>When I was curate at Redleigh, before my cousin presented me to
the very comfortable vicarage where I am now installed&mdash;only
four hundred souls, and no dissenters!&mdash;I lodged for a while
in the house of a most respectable country grocer of the name of
Vernon. He was an excellent person, this Edward Vernon, a staunch
pillar of the Church, ample of girth, like a Norman column, and a
prosperous man of business. Providence had favoured him. He owned a
considerable amount of house-property in the Redleigh
neighbourhood, after the fashion of the well-to-do rural tradesman;
for I have noticed on my way through the world in England that the
smaller capitalist never cares to invest in anything on earth save
the tangible and the visible. He'd rather get his two per cent sure
out of cottages in his own parish than five or six out of unknown
and uncertain colonial ventures. Australia is a name to him: the
Argentine a phantom. But a cottage is a reality. He believes in
house-property, and he pins his faith on it. 'As safe as houses,'
is to him no mere phrase, but the simple statement of a fundamental
principle.</p>
<p>Vernon was one of our churchwardens, and a most estimable man.
His clean-shaven face invited moral confidence. Though he was
close, very close, in his personal expenditure, and I'm afraid a
hard landlord to his poorer tenants, he always subscribed liberally
to all church undertakings, and took care to keep on excellent
terms with our worthy vicar. (I call poor old Wilkins 'worthy'
because I think that achromatic conventional epithet exactly suits
my late ecclesiastical superior's character: he was one of those
negatively good and colourless men for whose special behoof that
amiable non-committing adjective must have been expressly invented
by the wisdom of our ancestors.) People even wondered at times that
Vernon, who had a substantial private house of his own, apart from
his business, should care to receive a lodger into the bosom of his
family; and indeed, I must admit, he never let his rooms to any one
save the passing curate of the moment. Ill-natured critics used to
say he did it on purpose 'to keep in with the parsons'; and, to say
the truth, a becoming respect for the persons of the clergy was a
marked peculiarity in Vernon's well-balanced mind. I always
considered him in every respect a model of discreet behaviour for
the laity in his own rank and class of society.</p>
<p>He had his faults, of course; we are none of us
perfect&mdash;not even bishops, as I always remark after every
visitation. His relations with Mrs. Vernon, for example, were a
trifle strained, though naturally I can't say whether the blame lay
rather with him or with her; and he behaved at times with undue
severity to his children. I couldn't help noticing, too, that very
late at nights the good man seemed occasionally less clear and
articulate in his pronunciation than in the middle of the day; but
I ought in justice to add that if this vocal indecision were really
due to incautious indulgence in an extra glass of wine with a
friend over his pipe, Vernon had at least the grace and good taste
to conceal his failing as far as possible. For I observed at all
such times that he talked but sparingly, and in a very low voice;
that he avoided my presence with considerable ingenuity; and that
he seemed thoroughly ashamed of himself for his momentary lapse
into an undignified condition. I am an Oxford man myself, and I can
allow for such lapses, having rowed bow in my eight when I was an
undergraduate at Oriel, and enjoyed in my time, as an Englishman
may, the noisy fun of a good bump-supper.</p>
<p>Apart from this slight failing, however, which was never
conspicuous, and which I could hardly have observed had I not been
admitted into the privacy of Vernon's family, I found my landlord
in every way a true exponent of what I may venture to describe as
lower-middle-class Christian virtues. He had raised himself by his
industry and providence to a respectable position; he had saved and
invested till he was quite a rich man, as riches went in Redleigh;
and though I had occasion more than once to remonstrate with him
(officially) about the unsavoury condition of the Dingle End
cottages (popularly known as 'Vernon's Piggeries'), I must allow
there was a good deal of truth in his apt reply that the cottages
were quite good enough for the creatures who lived in them. 'When
you can never get in your rent,' he said, 'without going before the
court for it, it ain't in human nature, sir, to do much for your
tenants.' Having the misfortune to be an owner of West Indian
property myself, I must say in my heart I largely sympathised with
him.</p>
<p>I lodged at Vernon's for about two years in very great comfort.
The Banksia roses looked in at my window-sill. Mrs. Vernon was an
excellent manager, and had brought her husband a considerable
fortune. (She was the daughter of a notorious Wesleyan miller who
worshipped at a galvanised iron chapel in an adjoining parish; but,
of course, she had conformed as soon as she married the vicar's
churchwarden.) Though she and Vernon were on visibly bad terms with
one another, which they didn't attempt to conceal even before the
children, they were both of one mind wherever business was
concerned, being indeed most excellent and cautious stewards of the
ample means which Providence had vouchsafed them. And the cookery
was perfect. My modest chop was always grilled to a turn, thick,
brown, and juicy: I had no fault to find in any way with the
domestic arrangements. I fancy Mrs. Vernon, though Methodist bred,
must have been quite as much alive as her husband to the commercial
value of a clerical connection; certainly she was quite as anxious
to increase to the utmost the fortune they had acquired by their
joint exertions.</p>
<p>At the end of two years, however, a very unpleasant event
occurred, which made me feel with deep force the slightness of the
tie by which we all cling on to respectability and well-being.
Vernon came up to me one morning with a newspaper in his hand,
looking deadly pale, and half inarticulate with emotion. 'I beg
your pardon, sir,' he gasped out with a visible effort, as he
pointed with one finger to a paragraph of news, 'but have you read
<i>this</i> in the <i>Standard</i>?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I've read it, Vernon,' I answered, glancing hastily at the
lines to which his forefinger referred me; 'it's a very shocking
thing; very shocking indeed: but I make it a rule never to take
much interest in these sensational police cases.'</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon, sir,' he said again (he was always most
respectful in his mode of address); 'but did you happen to notice,
the man's name in this horrid report is Vernon?'</p>
<p>'Bless my soul, so it is,' I cried, glancing down at it once
more. I had never thought of connecting it with my respectable
landlord. 'You can't mean to tell me such a disreputable person as
the murderer seems to be is in any way related to you.'</p>
<p>The churchwarden winced. 'Well, it's no use concealing it from
you, sir,' he answered, looking down. 'Before half an hour's out,
all the parish will know it. I'd rather you heard it first of all
from me, who can explain the affair, than from some unfriendly
outsider.' And, indeed, it was true that Vernon, having got on in
the world, hadn't too many friends to speak up for him in Redleigh.
'You see the name alone's quite enough to fix it. There aren't
likely to be many Norcott Vernons in England. They'd know him by
that ... Well, yes, sir; I'll admit it; the man's my own twin
brother.'</p>
<p>'Your own twin brother!' I cried, taken aback, 'And in a case
like this! All the details so unpleasant! You don't mean to say you
think he really and truly murdered this woman?'</p>
<p>Vernon's face was very grave. 'Yes, I do, sir,' he answered.
'I'm afraid I must admit it. Norcott was always a very bad lot
indeed; an idle, improvident, careless fellow as ever existed;
right enough if only just he could have kept sober for a week; but
when the drink was in him, there was no saying what folly on earth
it would drive him to.'</p>
<p>'And the antecedents too!' I cried, scanning the paper once
more. 'Such a disgraceful life! His unfortunate relations with the
murdered woman! If I hadn't heard the facts from your own lips,
Vernon, I could never have believed he was a member of your
family!'</p>
<p>'Well, that's just where it is, sir,' the grocer answered, his
lips quivering a little. 'He had a wife of his own once&mdash;a
very decent woman, too, though he married improvidently. But he
killed her with his drinking; and then he got remorse very bad for
her death, which is always a foolish kind of feeling to give way
to; and that drove him to drink again, a deal worse than ever; and
after that, he picked up with some wretched creature; and
quarrelling with her, I suppose, this affair was the end of
it.'</p>
<p>'A knife!' I said, reading it over. 'The worst kind of murder.
Stabbing always seems to go with the most lawless habits.'</p>
<p>'That's it, sir,' my friend answered. 'I always told him he was
lawless. But it's a terrible thing, sir, and no mistake, when one's
own flesh and blood is had up like that on a charge of murder.'</p>
<p>'It is indeed, Vernon,' I answered, 'and I sympathise with you
most profoundly. But I'm going out now to see about that choir
practice. I'll talk with you again later on about this matter. Will
you tell Mrs. Vernon I'll want my beef-tea as usual, if you please,
at eleven punctually?'</p>
<p>For the next day or two, very little was heard in the parish
except gossip about Norcott Vernon and his early enormities. He
monopolised Redleigh. I had never even heard of the man's existence
before; but now that he was the hero of a first-class local
domestic tragedy, every old labourer in the village had some story
to tell of 'young Norcott Vernon's' juvenile delinquencies. I
improved the occasion, indeed, with my boys in the Sunday school by
pointing out to them how fatal might be the final results of the
lawless habits engendered (as in this sad case) by the practice of
tickling trout and playing truant on Saturdays. I found it
absolutely necessary to do something of the sort, as the episode
simply filled the minds of my entire Confirmation class. They read
the local paper before my very eyes, and discussed the chances of
the verdict in loud whispers, which led me to suppose they had been
privately betting upon it.</p>
<p>When the day of the trial at Dorchester arrived, Vernon begged
me with the utmost eagerness to accompany him to the assizes. He
had always been so useful to me that, though the request was made
at an inconvenient moment, I determined to go with him; besides, if
it came to that, the trial itself promised to be in most ways a
sufficiently curious one. I did my best, however, to keep the lads
in the parish from attending the assizes: a morbid interest in such
sights, I hold, is most injurious to young people. On the morning
fixed for the trial, I went off myself with Vernon, taking my seat,
as was then my wont, owing to straitened means, in a third-class
carriage. It was one of those commodious little horse-boxes, still
in use on the Great Western, open at the top between the different
compartments; and as we got in, we happened to catch the end of a
conversation carried on between two of my poorer parishioners.
'Wull, what I says, Tom,' one of them was remarking to his
neighbour, 'is just like this; Ted were always a long zight the
worst of they two Vernons, for all he's so thick with the passons
and such-like. Norcott, he were open, that's where it is, don't 'ee
zee?&mdash;but Ted, he's a sneak, and always were one. He'd zell
his own mother for money, he 'ould. Whereas Norcott, wy, he'd give
'ee the coat off his back, if on'y a decent zart o' chap was to ask
him vor it.'</p>
<p>'That's so, Clem,' the other man answered him confidently.
'You've just about hit upon it. And the reason Ted Vernon's takin'
passon along of him to 'sizes to-day, why, it's just 'cause he do
think it do look more decent-like, when he's goin' to zee his own
twin brother found guilty and zentenced off vor wilful murder.'</p>
<p>I considered it would be indecorous on our part to overhear any
more of so personal a conversation (especially as there were two of
us), so I coughed rather loudly to check their chatter, and, I'm
pleased to say, put a stop at once to that lively colloquy. A
moment later, I felt rather than saw a cautious head peep slowly
over the partition; then a low voice whispered in very awestruck
tones, 'Law, Tom, if that ain't passon hisself a-zittin' along o'
Ted in next compartment!'</p>
<p>When we reached the court, the murder case was the first on the
day's list for trial. Accused was already in the dock when we
entered. I looked hard at the prisoner. As often happens in the
case of twins, he remarkably resembled his brother the
churchwarden. To be sure, his swollen face bore evident marks of
drink and dissipation, while Edward Vernon's was smooth and smug
and respectable-looking; but in spite of this mere difference of
acquired detail, their features, and even their expressions,
remained absurdly alike, though I fancied the prisoner must have
possessed in youth a somewhat franker and more open countenance,
with handsomer traits in it than the Redleigh grocer's. He sat
through the trial, which was short and hasty, with an air of fierce
bravado on his bloated features, very different indeed from the
respectful deference which his brother would have displayed to
judge, jury, and counsel. The story of his crime was a vulgar and
sordid one. The verdict, of course, was a foregone conclusion. The
man's very face would have sufficed to condemn him, even without
the assiduous bungling of his lawyer, who didn't try to do more
than plead mitigating circumstances, which might possibly have
reduced the verdict from the capital charge to one of manslaughter.
The jury found the prisoner guilty without leaving their box; and
the judge, with what seemed to me almost precipitate haste, assumed
the black cap, and in a few short words passed sentence of death
upon him for the wilful murder of the wretched creature with whom,
as he rightly said, the man shared his infamy.</p>
<p>I went back to Redleigh in the same carriage with Vernon, who
seemed very much upset by this distressing circumstance. But what
surprised me most was the strange and so to speak sneaking way in
which he appeared more than once to disclaim any connection with
his brother's crime. He was so respectable a man himself, and so
excellent a churchman, that I'm sure if he hadn't mooted the
subject of his own accord nobody would ever for one moment have
thought of confusing his moral character in any way with his
brother's. But he said to me more than once as we returned, in an
argumentative voice, 'Look here, Mr. Ogilvie; people talk a lot of
nonsense, you know, about twins and their likeness. They'll tell
you down our way that what one twin'll do, the other'll do as well
as him. But that's all plain rubbish. Twins are born just as
different as other people. Now my brother and me were always quite
different. Not one thing alike in us. From the very beginning,
Norcott was always a proper bad lot. Do what I would, I never could
teach him prudence or saving. He was always breaking out, and had
no self-restraint; and self-restraint, I say, is the principle at
the bottom of all the virtues. It's the principle at the bottom of
all the virtues. And Norcott could never be kept from the drink
either: when a man drinks like him, it just makes a fiend of him.
Especially in <i>our</i> family. Unless he has
self-restraint&mdash;self-restraint; self-restraint'&mdash;he drew
himself up proudly&mdash;'and then, of course, that's quite another
matter.'</p>
<p>Three days after he came up to me again. 'Would you do me a
great kindness, sir?' he asked. 'You know you've always been a very
good friend to me.'</p>
<p>'What is it, Vernon?' I inquired, not being given to promise
anything in the dark in that way.</p>
<p>'Well, it's this, sir,' he answered, hesitating a little. 'I
want to go and see poor Norcott in Dorchester jail before he's
turned off, if I may venture to call it so; and I don't exactly
like to go near him by myself&mdash;it's a delicate business: so I
thought, as you were a clergyman, and a proper person (as I may
say) to accompany me, perhaps you wouldn't mind just running across
with me.'</p>
<p>I had an errand or two in Dorchester, as it happened, that day;
and I felt besides a certain natural curiosity to see how the
fellow took the prospect of hanging, now the bravado of the trial
had cooled off him a little; so I said, 'It's not exactly
convenient for me to go to-day, Vernon' (not to make myself too
cheap); 'but still, if you think it would be a comfort to you to
have a clergyman by your side, why, to oblige a parishioner, and as
a matter of duty, I don't mind accompanying you.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, sir,' he replied, looking at me rather curiously;
'I'm sure I'm very much obliged indeed to you.' He said it, as he
always said everything, respectfully and deferentially; yet I
thought I somehow noticed a queer undercurrent of contempt in the
tone of his voice which I had never before observed in it. And I
certainly detected a strange gleam of devilry in the corner of his
eye as he bowed and withdrew, which reminded me at once of his
brother the murderer.</p>
<p>However, I thought no more about it at the time, and we went
across to Dorchester next day very amicably, Vernon thanking me
profusely more than once on the way for my goodness in accompanying
him. We had a pass from the authorities to see the prisoner; and
the moment we entered the fellow's cell I could perceive at a
glance he was as unrepentant as ever. His eyes were sullen. In
fact, though of course he couldn't possibly have had access to
brandy in prison, he wore the exact air of a man who has been
drinking heavily. I suppose he had acquired by dint of long
practice a permanently drunken aspect and habit, which followed him
even into the enforced teetotalism of the condemned cell. His
manner was offensive, and extremely hectoring. As soon as his
brother spoke to him, he burst out at once into a long, loud peal
of discordant laughter. His hilarity shocked me. 'Hullo, Ted,' he
cried, seizing his brother's hand. 'So you've come to preach to me!
And you've brought along a parson! Well, well, that's
characteristic! You couldn't drop in without a devil-dodger,
couldn't you? I know why you've done that. It's half of it
hypocrisy; but it's more than half that you didn't dare to face
me&mdash;here, alone, in my cell&mdash;without a parson by your
side to keep you in countenance!'</p>
<p>I felt grieved to see a man so near his last end in such an
unbecoming frame of mind for one in his position; so I ventured to
encroach so far upon the province of the prison chaplain as to
offer him a little spiritual advice and exhortation. His brother,
too, spoke to him most nicely and well, reminding him of their
innocent childhood together, and of the many opportunities of
leading a better life which had often been afforded him by the
kindness of relations. But the condemned man seemed to wallow in a
condition of hopeless rebellion; he had been delivered over, I
judged, to a reprobate mind, which rendered him unwilling to listen
to advice or consolation of any kind. His manner remained insolent
and defiant to the very end; nothing that my companion could say to
encourage him would bring him to a proper sense of his awful
position.</p>
<p>At last, towards the close of our interview, when Vernon was
endeavouring to utter a few appropriate words of affectionate
farewell, the prisoner burst forth of a sudden with a fierce
outbreak of language, the very words of which are engraved to this
day on my memory. 'Why, Ted, you shallow sneak,' he cried, with
every outer appearance of profound indignation, 'what humbug this
all is&mdash;your pretending to preach to me! You know from your
childhood up you've always been a sight a worse fellow than I have!
You know it, and I know it! Bone of my bone, and blood of my blood,
I know every thought, every feeling, every fibre of you. I know the
false bent of you. Why, you and I are the selfsame man&mdash;except
only that I was never a sneak and a hypocrite as you are. When we
were boys at school, we got into the same scrapes; but <i>you</i>
sneaked out, and <i>I</i> got flogged for them. When we stole
apples together, it was I who climbed the hedge, and you who kept
the biggest half of the apples for yourself, and ate them secretly.
Every instinct and impulse that has led me into this scrape,
<i>you</i> have it as well as <i>I</i> have. Only, you have in
addition that confounded self-restraint of yours, which <i>I</i>
call covetousness and worldly wisdom.'</p>
<p>Edward Vernon seemed to wince as the criminal went on; but he
bowed his head low and answered nothing. His brother still
continued in a more excited voice: 'Oh yes, I know you; every trick
and every trait of you. You mean-spirited hypocrite! The family
vices, you've got them as bad as I have, and one of them worse than
me. There never was a Vernon yet, I know, but loved the drink and
loved the money. I love them myself; <i>you</i> love them as well
or better than I do. But <i>I</i> loved drink best; and <i>you</i>
loved money. That was meaner and worse than me. <i>I</i> married
for love a woman I doted on; and then, I led her a wretched life
with the drink, and repented time and again, as we Vernons
<i>will</i> repent&mdash;you know the way of us&mdash;and after
that, fell back again. <i>You</i> married for money a woman you
despised, and lived your wretched life at loggerheads with her for
ever, being only at one for a time in your miserable
money-grubbing. I loved the money, too; but I had grace enough left
to hate myself for loving it; and it drove me into drink, worse,
worse than ever; for whenever I tried to lead what <i>you</i> would
call "a decent life," I found in a week or two I was saving and
scraping and carneying like you, and degenerating into a confounded
respectable hypocrite. I despised and disliked myself so much for
that&mdash;never being able to sink quite as low as you
do&mdash;that I turned back to my drink, and respected myself the
more for it. Then poor Lucy died&mdash;I hurried her to her grave,
I know; no fear of <i>that</i> with you; your Martha won't be
hurried to the grave by any one; she'll stroll down in her own good
time, fat and sleek and respectable. I repented for that
again&mdash;and drank worse than ever over it. <i>You</i> drink
too, but late at night, in your own house&mdash;quietly, decently,
soberly&mdash;like a respectable tradesman and a solvent
churchwarden. You keep a parson in the house with you to prevent
your breaking out some evening unawares into a Vernon fandango. Oh
yes; I understand you! Then I picked up with poor Moll. I'm built
like that. I <i>must</i> have a woman about, to care for and
sympathise with&mdash;and to bully when I'm not sober. But I wasn't
going to inflict my poor drunken self upon a pure, good woman, whom
I'd have driven to her grave the same as I did Lucy; so I picked up
with poor Moll there. She could drink with me herself; and in her
way I loved her. Don't pull a shocked mug: you know how that was
just as well as I do; for you're the same build as me, and, you
see, you're a drunkard. I've always that consolation in talking to
you, Ted, that at least I feel sure you can quite understand me.
Two of a mind don't need an interpreter. Well, we quarrelled one
night, Moll and I, both as drunk as owls&mdash;quarrelled about
another man; and in my heat, I struck her. She up and had at me. It
was knives after that; her first, me after; and&mdash;here I am
now, awaiting execution. But, Ted, you know it's only because
you're a meaner sneak than I am that <i>I'm</i> sitting here, a
condemned murderer to-day, while <i>you're</i> a respectable and
respected tradesman.'</p>
<p>To my great surprise, Edward Vernon seemed immensely impressed
by this unseemly harangue, and, covering his face with his hands,
cowered visibly before the man. For my own dignity's sake, I felt
it was high time this unfortunate interview should come to a
conclusion. 'Vernon,' I said, touching the grocer's arm, 'let's go
now, I beg of you. Our presence is superfluous. It's clear we can
do your unhappy brother no good. He's not in a fitting frame of
mind just now to receive with advantage our advice or condolence.
Suppose we leave him to the kindly ministrations of the prison
chaplain?'</p>
<p>'You're right, sir,' the grocer answered, taking his
handkerchief from his face (and, contrary to all belief, I saw he
had been crying). 'I'm afraid my presence rather aggravates than
consoles him.'</p>
<p>The murderer rose from his seat. His face was hateful. 'Ted,
Ted,' he cried out, 'you infernal hypocrite; will you keep up your
hypocrisy even at a moment like this before your condemned brother?
Oh, Ted, I'm ashamed of you. Go home, sir, go home; take your
bottle from your box, and repent a good honest Vernon repentance!
Get decently drunk before the eyes of the world, and confess your
sneakishness. It's money-grubbing, not virtue, that's kept
<i>you</i> straight so long. If you've any conscience left, boy, go
home and repent of it. Go home and get drunk; and let all the world
know which man of us two was really the worst devil!'</p>
<p>I seized the grocer's arm and hurried him by main force out of
the condemned cell. I felt this scene was growing unseemly. But all
the way back to Redleigh he sat and crouched in the train, looking
as if he had been whipped, and white as a ghost with terror.</p>
<p>Three days after, Norcott Vernon was to be executed at
Dorchester. In the morning his brother Edward disappeared from
Redleigh, and didn't turn up again till late in the evening. About
eleven o'clock, I was sitting in my own rooms, in my long lounge
chair, engaged in reading the excellent literary supplement to the
<i>Guardian</i>; and, having mislaid my paper-knife, no doubt
through the culpable negligence of Mrs. Vernon's housemaid, I had
just taken from its sheath the little Norwegian dirk or dagger
which I brought back the year before from my trip to the Hardanger
Fiord. I had cut the pages open with it, and laid the knife down
carelessly on the table by my side (which ought to be a lesson to
one in habits of tidiness), when a loud and disgraceful noise upon
the stairs aroused my attention&mdash;a noise as of quarrel and
drunken scuffling. Next instant, with a rude burst, my door was
pushed open, and my landlord entered, all red and blustering,
without even so much as a knock to announce his arrival.</p>
<p>He had been drinking, that was evident; for his face was
flushed: and I noticed, almost without consciously recognising the
fact, that his features and expression now resembled more closely
than ever the condemned man whom I had seen a few days before in
his cell at Dorchester. He advanced towards me with an insolent
hectoring air which exactly recalled his unfortunate brother's.
'Hullo, parson,' he cried, laughing loud: 'so there you are at your
studies&mdash;looking over the list of next presentations! Ha, ha,
ha! that's a good joke! You're counting the loaves and fishes. How
much the advowson? Present incumbent, I suppose, over eighty, and
failing!'</p>
<p>I had never before seen the man in such a state as this; so I
rose severely and fronted him. 'Vernon,' I observed in my most
chilling voice, 'you've been drinking, sir, drinking!'</p>
<p>He drew back a pace, and throwing his head on one side, looked
long at me and sniggered. 'Yes, I have, you image,' he answered.
'You fool, I've been drinking. Honestly, openly, manfully drinking.
And I've got it on me now&mdash;the Vernon repentance. I've been
over to Dorchester&mdash;oh yes, I've been over: to see the black
flag hoisted over the jail when my brother Norcott was turned
off&mdash;for the murder I myself as good as committed.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean, man?' I cried, taken aback. 'You're drunk,
sir: dead drunk! Go at once from my presence!'</p>
<p>'Drunk?' he answered. 'Yes, drunk! But precious sober for all
that. I've come to myself at last. I won't endure it any longer....
Why, do you think, you great goggle-eyed owl, I <i>like</i> all
this flummery? Do you think I <i>like</i> your parsonical cant? I'm
a Vernon, and I hate it; though for the money's sake, the vile
money, the hateful money that was always our stumbling-block, I've
endured it and put up with it. But I'm done with it now; I've
slaved and saved enough: I've come to myself, as Norcott advised,
and I tell you, I'm done with it. You thought I had no conscience,
you blue-faced baboon; but I had, and I've awaked it. Good gin's
awaked it. It's wide awake now, and it's driving me to this, for
poor Norcott's murder. <i>I</i> did it as well as he; I did it, and
I'll pay for it. I could have done the same thing any day if I'd
only had the courage, and if it hadn't been for this cursed
respectability's sake that I endured for the money. I just kept it
down, because I wasn't half the man my brother Norcott was. They've
hanged him for being more of a man than I was. <i>He</i> loved his
wife, and <i>I</i> hate mine. But I'm a man too; and I can murder
with the best of them.'</p>
<p>I began to be alarmed. 'Go to bed, you wretched sot!' I
exclaimed severely.</p>
<p>But he burst into a loud laugh. 'No, no; I won't go to bed,' he
answered, '&mdash;till I've had your blood. I'll have your blood,
or some one's. Then I'll go up sober for once, and sleep the sleep
of a baby.'</p>
<p>As he spoke, his eye chanced to fall upon the Norwegian dagger
which I had incautiously laid down beside the <i>Guardian</i> upon
the table. He snatched it up and brandished it. I turned pale, I
suppose; at any rate, I'm sure I retired with some haste to the far
side of the sitting-room. He followed me like a demon. 'Why, you
white-livered cur,' he cried, in a voice like a madman's, 'you're
afraid of dying! Ha, ha, ha! that's good! A parson, and afraid!
Afraid of going home! Where's the point of your religion?'</p>
<p>I dodged him about the table; but he flew after me, round and
round. He brandished the knife as he did so.</p>
<p>'I've got a conscience,' he shrieked aloud, 'and it's wide awake
now. I'm done with hypocrisy. No more money-grubbing for me. I
shall have somebody's blood. It ain't fair poor Norcott should be
hanged by the neck till dead, and worse men than he alive and
respected! I shall come out just for once in my life to-night. I
shall show my real character. Let's be honest and
straightforward.&mdash;I'll drive it up to the haft in you.'</p>
<p>He poked the knife out. Then he flung back his head and roared
with laughter. 'How the devil-dodger runs!' he cried, lunging at
me. 'It does one good to see him. But I'll have his blood, all the
same. I shall swing for it, like Norcott.'</p>
<p>With a desperate effort, I rushed forward and seized the deadly
weapon from the fellow's hands. In doing so, I cut myself with the
blade rather seriously. But I wrenched it away, all the same. He
let me wrench it. But he stood there and laughed at me. Then he
retreated towards the door, and pulled out&mdash;a new pistol. 'I
bought this at Dorchester,' he said calmly, cocking it. 'I bought
it this morning, for conscience' sake, to do a murder with.'</p>
<p>I faced him in silence. He pointed it at me and laughed again.
'What a precious funk they're in!' he cried, seeming to burst with
amusement. 'What a lot they all think of their tuppeny-ha'penny
lives! It's enough to make one laugh. But I don't think I'll shoot
him. He ain't worth a good cartridge. He's such a contemptible
jackass!'</p>
<p>The words were rude; but I confess, at the moment, I heard them
with pleasure.</p>
<p>Then, to my immense surprise, he opened the door once more, with
a cunning look on his face, and walked quietly upstairs. I fell,
unmanned, into my easy-chair, quivering all over with nervous
agitation. There was a minute's pause. At the end of that time, a
loud report shook the room I sat in. It was followed at ten
seconds' interval by another. Next instant, the housemaid rushed
down with a face of terror. 'Oh, come up, sir,' she cried. 'There's
terrible things happening! Mr. Vernon's shot himself, and he's
killed the missus!'</p>
<p>I went up to the bedroom. The wife was on the hearth-rug, shot
lightly through the body. The wretched man himself lay moaning on
the bed, blood streaming from his breast, and his eyes half open.
As he saw me, he smiled through his pain and flung up one hand.
'Norcott was right,' he said slowly. 'I was always a deal a worse
fellow than he was. But I've come to myself now, and I hope I've
killed her.'</p>
<p>He was wrong in that hope. His wife recovered. The jury very
rightly returned it as temporary insanity. Indeed, Vernon's strange
and unbecoming language to myself just before his death clearly
showed the fact that reason had been deposed from her seat for the
time being. I have always felt that his brother's terrible end must
have preyed upon a once estimable parishioner's mind so much that
he was scarcely responsible at the time for his dreadful actions,
which providentially had no such evil results for my own life and
limbs as I feared at the moment of his worst delirium. His estate
was proved at seventy odd thousand pounds, and his widow has since
married a most respectable solicitor.</p>

<h2><a name="TAILPIECE" id="TAILPIECE"></a>TAILPIECE</h2>
<h3>A MATTER OF STANDPOINT</h3>
<p>'Anything going to-day, comrade?' hungry-looking Jules asked of
hungry-looking Hector, just outside the grounds of the Hotel
Beau-Rivage.</p>
<p>'<i>Pas de chance</i>,' hungry-looking Hector responded, with a
shake of his shaggy head. 'No work since a fortnight. It is, look
you, these <i>bourgeois</i>!'</p>
<p>But the word <i>bourgeois</i> did not mean to those unkempt and
starveling Provençaux at all the same thing that the English
journalist has made it mean to the English reader. To you, dear
gentlemen, it implies practically an underbred person, whose tastes
are less noble and exalted than your own; to Jules and Hector, it
connoted rather a man in a black coat&mdash;good, bad, or
indifferent: a person not a workman, a <i>riche</i>, an eat-all, a
member of the capitalist or idle classes. Sons of the southern
proletariat themselves, born to a slender and precarious diet of
garlic and olives, with a substratum of sour bread, and an
occasional rinsing of <i>petit vin bleu</i>, they made no petty
discrimination of trade or profession, no invidious distinction of
banker or brewer, merchant or manufacturer, doctor or advocate,
poet or painter. If you wore a blue blouse or a coarse grey shirt
with a crimson sash, you were an <i>ouvrier</i> and a brother; if
you wore a black coat and a starched white collar, you were a
<i>sacré bourgeois</i>, and an enemy of humanity. 'Tis a simple
creed, with much to recommend it. It may occasionally go
wrong&mdash;all creeds are fallible&mdash;but in the main it
answers to a genuine distinction of life and function&mdash;from
the point of view of starveling Jules and starveling Hector,
<i>bien entendu</i>!</p>
<p>'What hast thou eaten to-day?' hungry Jules inquired, with a
keen glance from under his black penthouse eyebrows. His sharp
beady eyes were naturally deep-set, but a long course of starvation
had made them still further recede into dim recesses of darkling
shadow.</p>
<p>Hungry Hector shrugged his shoulders&mdash;or rather his
shoulder-bones. 'What would you have?' he answered, with the
philosophy of hunger. 'Like this, like that! Here a crust, there a
cabbage-stalk! As the unemployed live. 'Tis not a banquet,
<i>convenons</i>.'</p>
<p>Hungry Jules seized him energetically by the ulna&mdash;only
anatomical language can fairly describe the various salient
portions of those two thinly-draped skeletons. 'Look in
<i>there</i>!' he cried hoarsely, pointing through the window.
'They feast, those <i>bourgeois</i>! They have eaten already soup,
and fish, and calves' feet in <i>béchamel</i>; and now the men in
the white chokers are offering them roast lamb. <i>C'est trop fort,
n'est-ce pas, camarade?</i>'</p>
<p>Hungry Hector leaned forward and inspected the diners with
glistening eyes that half started from his head. Some of the
pampered children of luxury actually turned up their noses at hot
roast lamb! '<i>Décidément, c'est trop fort</i>,' he answered,
horrified. His righteous indignation was fast rising to
boiling-point.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>Inside, at the table, young Doctor Hughes, of London, that
amiable consumptive, who had worn himself to death in the underpaid
service of the poor of Whitechapel, was sitting with his wife,
toying idly with the food on the plate before him. Minna's eyes
were fixed upon him. 'Don't you think, dear,' she whispered, 'you
could eat just a mouthful or two of this nice roast lamb? Do try!
It's <i>so</i> good for you.'</p>
<p>Trevor Hughes turned it over with a listless fork, and inspected
it. 'I never can eat the Riviera lamb,' he answered, stifling a
sigh. 'It's killed too young; and it's so lean and skinny.'</p>
<p>'But you ate no soup, and you ate no fish,' Minna murmured, with
tears in her eyes. She saw only too plainly that his appetite was
failing.</p>
<p>'The soup was cold and greasy,' Trevor explained, not peevishly,
but in an apologetic voice; 'and the fish was <i>loup</i>. I cannot
eat <i>loup</i>. You know it disagrees with me.'</p>
<p>Minna knew it did&mdash;and trembled. For day by day more and
more things disagreed with him. She began to wonder with a
tremulous fear what she could give him to live upon.</p>
<p>'If only we could get away to Algiers,' she murmured low, 'you
might recover your appetite. But here, on the Riviera, none of the
food seems to suit you.'</p>
<p>'I'm afraid not,' Trevor answered. And he knew too well why. He
had seen more than enough of such cases in Whitechapel.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>Jules seized Hector's arm again. 'And see,' he cried. 'See!
Those lackeys bring in something else to offer them! Sacred name of
a dog, I swear to you, it is chicken!'</p>
<p>'Do these people eat chicken every day?' Hector asked, half
beside himself with astonishment, his lantern jaws dropping rapidly
as his hungry mouth watered.</p>
<p>'Do they eat chicken every day? <i>Ma foi</i>, yes, they do:
unless in its place they eat duck or partridge. Figure to yourself,
partridge! I have watched them here for a week, and you will not
believe such shameful luxury&mdash;the <i>luxe effréné des
bourgeois</i>! Every evening that goes they sit down to the same
feast&mdash;soup, fish, an <i>entrée</i>, a joint, a
<i>rôti</i>&mdash;and sweets&mdash;and dessert. <i>Mon dieu, c'est
effrayant!</i>'</p>
<p>Hector grasped his short knife. Poverty had not been able to
deprive him of <i>that</i>. '<i>C'est pas mal</i>,' he exclaimed
again. 'But they shall pay for it, those mouths there! Bloodsuckers
that drink up the life-blood of the people. And <i>me</i> dine on
cabbage-stalks! I swear to you, they shall pay for it!'</p>
<p>'What do you mean?' hungry Jules exclaimed, seizing his ulna
once more with a certain greedy and convulsive eagerness.</p>
<p>Hector opened the knife stealthily, a strange gleam in his eye.
'The first <i>bourgeois</i> who leaves the room!' he whispered
between his set teeth, holding it up, blade downward, and striking
the air with a vicious thrust. 'They are all of them equally
culpable. <i>Le premier venu, c'est compris?</i>'</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>Minna looked at her husband tenderly. 'A little bit of chicken,
darling?' she murmured low. 'I'm sure you can eat just a mouthful
off the wing. Such nice white meat! Do let me give you some.'</p>
<p>Trevor shook his head with a sad smile. 'No, no, dear,' he
answered with a weary, dreary look. 'I couldn't touch a mouthful.
You know I detest the <i>table d'hôte poulet</i>.'</p>
<p>'You're not going?' she cried, seeing him rise with the weary,
dreary look still deepening on his face.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he answered. 'The room's so hot. I shall stroll out into
the garden. It's nice and cool there, and the air seems to do me
more good than anything.'</p>
<p>'Then I shall go with you,' Minna cried, and rose from the table
to accompany her husband.</p>
<p>'<i>Tiens, Hector</i>,' Jules whispered, as husband and wife
emerged from the hotel door. <i>Vois-tu? un bourgeois!</i>'</p>
<p>A sudden blind rush. A knife gleaming in the air. A scream of
horror from Minna. A gurgle of blood; a red stream; a sigh. And the
tragedy was complete. There was one <i>bourgeois</i> the less alive
on earth; and one friend of humanity stood back, with gnashed
teeth, awaiting arrest by the guests and the <i>concierge</i>.</p>
<p>'A horrible crime!' you say. Yes, no doubt, a horrible
crime&mdash;from the ethical side, a crime of the first magnitude.
But from the psychological side, which is how human actions rather
strike me, a regrettable result of incompatibility in the matter of
standpoint. Those two saw things differently&mdash;no more than
that. If each could have seen with the other's eyes&mdash;well,
most crimes are so, and most blunders also.</p>
