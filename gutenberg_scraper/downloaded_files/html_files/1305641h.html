<p><span class="a">The</span> Queensland Government having made
arrangements for forming a settlement at Cape York, it became
necessary to adopt some plan by means of which Cape York settlers
could be supplied with fresh meat and other necessaries. Mr.
Frank Jardine then agreed to take a herd of cattle overland to
meet the wants of the settlement, and at the same time to open up
the unexplored country of the peninsula without going out of his
road. I was appointed to accompany the party as surveyor; and a
grant of 150<i>l</i>. was made by the Government to supply me
with horses and necessaries for the trip. A sextant, artificial
horizon, prismatic compass, Gregory-compass, and barometer were
also supplied. My duties were defined in a letter from A.C.
Gregory, Esq., the Surveyor-General. They were as
follows:&mdash;To keep a field-book of the route, and in it to
notice the nature of the soil, timber, grasses, and so forth;
also the abundance or scarcity of water, any suitable place for
settlement, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The party left Rockhampton on the 14th of May, 1864, under the
superintendence of Mr. A. Jardine, and journeyed, by the old road
to Port Denison, as far as Macdonald's station on the Bogie
River; then to a good camping-ground on the north bank of the
river Burdekin, within 12 miles of Mr. Anthill's station,
crossing that river at Hamilton's public-house. The party was
then ten in number, and consisted of the following persons:
Messrs. A. Jardine, Scrutton, Binney, and Conderoy, and six black
boys&mdash;Euler, Peter, Sambo, Barney, Charley, and Pluto. They
reached the camping-ground on the 17th of June, 1864. They had
with them thirty-one horses. Mr. Frank Jardine and I reached Port
Denison, from Rockhampton, in the <i>Diamantina</i>, S.S.,
Captain Champion, having touched at Port Mackay, about the 16th
of July. The leader then purchased five horses for my use with
the money which had been granted for that purpose.</p>
<p>In a week's time, agreeably spent by me at Burdekin Downs, the
party reached that station. I then joined them, and we proceeded
to "Reedy Lake", and encamped there.</p>
<p>Shortly before leaving Reedy Lake our advanced party was
enlarged by the addition of two persons&mdash;Mr. Bode, a
gentleman in search of new country, and his black boy. His path
and ours being the same we journeyed on together. We left Reedy
Lake on the 17th of August, 1864, and on the 24th reached the
station <span class="pagenum">{Page 20}</span> of Messrs. Firth
and Atkinson, Upper Burdekin, near which we encamped.</p>

<p><i>Aug</i>. 26.&mdash;Travelled about 17 miles W. by S. over
broken ridges, lightly timbered with ironbark, moderately-well
grassed, but now very dry. Encamped on the west border of a small
plain, without finding water.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 16 miles W. by S. At 6
miles from our last camp crossed the range dividing the water of
the supposed Lynd and Burdekin rivers; both the ascent and
descent were very gradual; the remaining 10 miles undulating,
open, ironbark forest, well grassed, but no water until the end
of our day's journey, when we encamped near some water-holes, on
the western side of a small black-soil plain, the grass of which
had been burnt.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 14 miles W.N.W. through
what would generally be called good country, although at this
season very dry. On our way we noticed small-leaved bauhinia,
myrtle, and grevillia. Passed the homestead of Mr. M'Kinnon,
encamping about 3 miles beyond, on the north-east bank of a
creek, then supposed to be the Lynd River of Leichhardt.
Abundance of water in the creek, near our camp, and, immediately
opposite, a low basaltic ridge appears a few yards from the bank
of the creek, which latter is lined on both sides with melaleuca.
In its bed are basalt and mica slate. Floodmarks 2 feet above the
bank. Latitude 18° 55' 23".</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 15 miles north-west. At
first stony ridges, timbered chiefly with ironbark; afterwards
the soil became more sandy, and we noticed bloodwood, acacia, and
apple-gum, and some good grass. At 11 miles from the last camp we
crossed the creek, whose sandy bed is there dry and shallow, 60
yards wide, having in it masses of basalt and mica-slate. At 4
miles beyond the crossing-place we encamped near an excellent
water-hole in the creek. The adjacent country to our left, while
travelling this distance, appeared to be scrubby. The bed of the
creek is frequently filled with melaleuca.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 13 miles north-west, the
creek running nearly parallel with us&mdash;open undulating
ironbark forest, tolerably well grassed&mdash;soil sandy. At this
distance from last camp we reached the homestead of Mr. Yates,
then crossing the creek, which is there about 70 yards wide,
sandy bed, with masses of mica-slate, and banks 15 feet deep,
continued on our journey, over a basaltic flat, lightly timbered
with box for one mile E.N.E., crossing and encamping on the north
side of an ana-branch of the creek above-mentioned, within a
quarter of a mile of the homestead of J.G. Macdonald,
Esq.,&mdash;our resting-place until the cattle are purchased.
<span class="pagenum">{Page 21}</span></p>
<p>Messrs. A. Jardine and Bode, with two black boys, leave the
camp, taking with them a fortnight's provisions. Their intention
is to follow down the creek near which we are encamped, supposed
to be the Lynd River, as far as its junction with the Mitchell,
observing which side of the creek was most suitable for
travelling. During their absence I took seven sets of lunar
observations, the result of which gave a mean longitude 144° 3'
30" E. of Greenwich, in latitude 18° 37' 10" S., as the mean
latitude from several northern and southern observations. The
variation of the compass I found, by theodolite (not a very good
one) to be about 6° E. The prismatic compass with which I was
provided had no coloured glasses nor any reflector.</p>
<p><i>August and September</i>.&mdash;After being absent for
nearly three weeks, Messrs. A. Jardine and Bode return, much
puzzled with regard to the course of the supposed River Lynd.
They had followed it down for about 180 miles, and say that the
last 60 miles they were travelling nearly due west. Mr. Jardine
plotted his course roughly on a sheet of foolscap (120 miles of
the distance I afterwards found to be tolerably correct); and I
gave it as my opinion that we were on the main branch of the
River Gilbert. We afterwards found the river, shown in the map by
a dotted line, as a branch of the River Lynd, was a new river,
and is probably the main branch of the River Gilbert. We named it
the River Einnasleigh. I ascended a hill about 1 mile to the N.E.
of our camp, and obtained several bearings of adjacent mountains
and ranges. The surrounding country is mountainous on all sides
except south and south-east, and the smoke of burning grass is to
be seen in all directions, occasioned by the blacks.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 6.&mdash;The cattle are here, and start in a few
days&mdash;about 250 head. Our leader thinks it necessary to
reduce the party; and two black boys, Charley and Pluto, are to
be left behind.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our party numbered ten persons, 36 horses,
both pack and saddle, and three tents, as well as provisions,
estimated to last us, with care, four months. We travelled about
19 miles, our general course being N.W. by N.: the first four
miles of our journey being over basaltic flats, timbered with box
and apple-gum; the remainder ridges, both sandy and stony,
tolerably well grassed, and timbered with ironbark. Encamped near
the river in latitude 18° 23' 59".</p>
<p>About a mile up the river from this camp it is joined by a
large creek from the south-east, and 5 miles beyond its mouth the
river is shut in by a long rocky range trending south-west. The
river is here about 250 yards wide, and its bed filled with huge
masses of granite and basalt, its banks sloping and rocky. Water
good and plentiful, but not running.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Shifted our camp one mile to the N.N.E. to
the bank <span class="pagenum">{Page 22}</span> of a small
lagoon, within a quarter of a mile of the river. The horses
enjoyed good grass, fresh and green, for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Box, barringtonia, flooded gum, and pandanus were the
prevailing varieties found here.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 10 miles N.N.W., 5 miles
sandy ridges, timbered chiefly with box-trees of small girth; the
remaining distance the ridges became stony. Seven miles from camp
we passed a fine reach of water in the river, which is there
about 500 yards wide and filled with masses of basalt. Some
prominent peaks rise from broken country to the east; to the
westward the rocky range, before mentioned, continues to run
nearly parallel with the river, having a steep rocky bluff nearly
opposite our camp. I have named this Startwell Bluff. Encamped on
the bank of the river, which is here broad and shallow; its bed
is filled with melaleuca, and some excellent water in rocky
holes. Grass very dry.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 11 miles north-west;
irregular ridges, very rocky and difficult for the horses and
cattle, quartz, basalt, and a rock full of large leaflets of
mica. Across the river the country is mountainous and broken, and
on this side the grass has been recently burned by the natives.
The river-bed is broad, shallow, and more sandy, and is joined by
a deep, sandy, dry creek, 80 yards wide, coming from E.N.E., its
banks steep and lined with immense melaleuca-trees. We encamped
on its north bank near the river, and found water in the creek by
digging. Noticed bloodwood and the Leichhardt-tree and
ironbark.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 8 miles N.W. by N.;
at first ironbark forest and sandy ridges, basalt cropping up in
places; afterwards basalt became more plentiful, and made
travelling difficult. The river-bank was intersected by deep
gullies, and at 4 miles from last camp its bed narrowed to 150
yards, one deep sandy channel, banks lined with melaleuca. At
about 7 miles from last camp we were compelled to leave the
river, whose bed is there filled with masses of rock, it is also
shut in on both sides by abrupt rocky ranges. We then crossed a
low basaltic ridge and flat, and encamped near a large swamp, on
its western side, not deep. I ascended the range to the north of
our camp, and had a capital view of the surrounding country. The
rocky range before mentioned, of which Startwell Bluff is a
prominent point, from thence makes a great bend to the west, and
then north, running into the river a mile or two to the north of
our present camp. The country enclosed by the range and river
appears to be level. To the east I saw nothing but rocky ranges
quite near us, but to the S.E. by W. my view extended for at
least 25 miles, enabling me to note the bearing of a prominent
peak at that distance (Carl's Peak). <span class="pagenum">{Page
23}</span></p>
<p>Latitude 18° 2' 7". The mean of a north and south
observation.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 11 miles, our
general course being N.N.W., passing through a gap in the range
about 2½ miles to the north-east of our camp. The remaining part
of our journey was difficult travelling; basaltic flats and
ridges openly timbered, and all the grass burnt. We encamped on
the eastern bank of a creek which took its rise near the range.
The creek is connected with the river by a channel near our
present camp; it was named Parallel Creek by Mr. A. Jardine, on
his previous exploration-trip down this river, although from this
point it becomes an ana-branch. We enjoy fine strong breezes from
the eastward, with fine clear weather. The thermometer reading
73° at sunrise this morning.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;To-day our journey was much shorter than
usual, in consequence of the difficult nature of the country. We
continued our course for 7½ miles north-west down Parallel Creek,
being frequently compelled to travel in its bed, and as often
obliged to leave it. It is separated from the river by a high
ridge of basalt, and its bed, when not filled with masses of
rock, is sandy and timbered with melaleuca, its north-east bank
is frequently very abrupt and rocky; some good grass grows
amongst the basalt, but much of it has been burned by the
natives. We encamped on the north-east bank of the creek, where
it is not rocky, and where its slope towards the creek is
gradual. The basaltic ridge immediately opposite our camp is
abrupt, and from 60 to 70 feet high. About a quarter of a mile up
the creek from camp the rocky bank on the north-east side ends in
a sandstone cliff, worn into caves and hollows by weather and
time.</p>
<p>Latitude 17° 51' 5".</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our journey to-day of about 10½ miles, a
little to the north of W.N.W., was performed over country similar
to that yesterday described, but more rocky and difficult. Water
was more frequently found in the bed of the creek, although near
our camp it was not plentiful. To the eastward broken country is
still apparent, but ranges and hills are becoming less frequent.
The ana-branch is here about 300 yards wide, and filled with tall
melaleuca.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;At about 3½ miles from last camp the
ana-branch joins the river, which is there 500 yards wide, and an
immense sand-bed, having in it large masses of granite, porphyry
and sandstone. Our general course to-day has been W. by N. about
8 miles. From the junction downwards it is stiff sandy bank,
openly timbered with box and bloodwood, and travelling is much
easier. Quartz ridges, densely clothed with scrub, are seen from
the river-bank in a north-east direction. <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 24}</span></p>
<p>Latitude 17° 45' 40".</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our journey down the
north-eastern bank of the river for about 11 miles in a
north-westerly direction, The first 7 miles exceedingly rocky
ridges, in many places running abruptly into the river, and
intersected by very deep gullies. We avoided some of these by
travelling at about a mile from the river; beyond that distance
there is much scrub. The last 4 miles, low sandstone ridges, open
forest on the river frontage, and timbered with larger trees,
box, bloodwood, and gum. Soil very light and rotten, and grasses
very coarse.</p>
<p>At about 4 miles from last camp the bed of the river is
divided into channels by a high rock, three-quarters of a mile in
length. A fine sheet of water is contained between this rock and
the north-east bank; in this gorge I noticed flood-marks 30 feet
above the bed of the river. Could not get a good view of the
neighbouring country, but caught a glimpse of some low ranges to
the westward. At our camp the river-bank is low, and the bed
densely timbered with melaleuca, and occasional
Leichhardt-trees.</p>
<p>Encamped near a good but shallow water-hole in the river.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Continued our course down the north bank of
the river for about 11 miles W.N.W., the country becoming more
open as we proceeded. To our right low sandstone ranges, partly
covered with scrub and having abrupt sides, terminated at 200 or
300 yards from the river, between the spurs and along the
frontage of the river. Box-flats, openly timbered, firm soil, and
good grasses. Encamped near a fine long water-hole in the river,
which furnished us with some excellent cod, bream, and
catfish.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 10 miles west; the
country becoming still more open and the box-flats more
extensive, as well as better grassed; gullies less numerous and
the banks of the river low, the bed still wide, well watered, and
sandy. Encamped on the north-west side of a small creek, plenty
of water in water-holes in its bed, about half-a-mile from the
river, which is here three-quarters of a mile wide, sandy bed,
filled with small melaleuca trees, and having low banks.</p>
<p>Latitude 17° 34' 32".</p>
<p>It was the wish of our leader, Mr. F. Jardine, to get on to
the River Lynd, and to follow it to its junction with the River
Mitchell, continuing our course down that river as far as would
be thought necessary to avoid any difficulty in finding water.
Mr. A. Jardine had previously mentioned this good camping-ground
as a suitable place for the horses and cattle, pending another
advance exploration trip they (Messrs. F. and A. Jardine) had in
view, to the northward.</p>
<p>I plotted up my courses, and said that 18 to 20 miles N.N.E.
from camp they ought to strike the River Lynd. <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 25}</span></p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;The brothers, taking with them Euler and
the necessary provisions, left us to-day.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;They returned to-day, and their report was
unsatisfactory. Following a N.N.E. course, they came upon a
creek, which I take to be Turning Creek, running in the same
direction, and afterwards a large creek, which should be the Lynd
River. At the distance above mentioned, Leichhardt's description
of the neighbouring country does not at all coincide with the
sort of country on the creek. Our leader and his brother say they
were down the creek for about 50 miles. The country either
densely timbered or clothed with tea-tree scrub, little or no
grass, and water only to be found in lagoons near the creek. Mr.
A. Jardine does not think it is the Lynd River of Leichhardt. I
do, for two reasons:&mdash;1st. Its distance from our camp is
what I expected it would be; and 2nd. Its general course is the
same.</p>
<p>I know my starting point to be correct as regards latitude,
and I think I have its position east from Greenwich nearly right.
We have with us two maps, one a tracing furnished me by the
Surveyor-General and the other 'Buxton's map of Queensland.' One
places the River Lynd about 30 miles east of the place assigned
to it in the other. I have assumed the former to be
correct&mdash;that is the tracing.</p>
<p>While at this, our 13th camp, I ascended a low range to the
north-east,-three-quarters of a mile distant. To the north-west
and west low sandstone ranges, and one to the south, distant
about 15 miles. A low range also to the E.N.E. 18 miles,
elsewhere nearly level country. A lagoon across the river about
3½ miles from camp in a box-forest, very open, and grasses very
dry, and several on this side of the river 5 or 6 miles from
camp; in one of these some very large catfish were caught, but
the rocky bottom was a great annoyance to the fishermen. Near the
camp there are box, bloodwood, acacia, apple-gum, and the
Leichhardt-tree.</p>
<p>The black boys have been very successful in finding large
quantities of the honey of the native bee, and I have named the
creek near which we are encamped Cooroora Creek in
consequence.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. F. Jardine and his brother, with Euler,
again leave us, intending to travel northward until they reach
the River Mitchell. The remainder of the party are to follow a
marked tree line, and to encamp near the supposed Lynd, on the
bank of a small lagoon, there to await their return. Mr. Jardine
has requested me to name the river we are about to leave "The
Einnasleigh."</p>
<p>31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Leave our 13th camp. Horses in good
condition and cattle doing well, and travel about 4 miles
generally N. by E., encamping on a creek or water-course, running
south-east, and holding <span class="pagenum">{Page 26}</span> a
little dirty but drinkable water in small holes. Flat box-forest,
and very little grass.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 1.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 14 miles N.N.E.,
encamping on the south-west side of a small lagoon, about 200
yards from the supposed River Lynd. The first mile box-forest,
and remainder of the journey gently undulating sandy ridges,
poorly grassed, but densely timbered with tea-tree, rusty gum,
bloodwood, stringy bark, acacia, and occasionally pandanus. At
about 8 miles from last camp we came to a small creek, dry sandy
bed; a little water was found in it where sandstone was cropping
up. The bed was 4 or 5 feet deep. About 1 mile further on we
passed a spring, covering a small flat near the creek. From this
point into camp we passed some enormous ant-hills, 8 to 10 feet
high and 20 to 30 feet in circumference. Near the camp grows a
fine shady tree, about 30 feet in height, branches slightly
drooping, and bearing an oval yellow fruit, pulpy when ripe, with
a rough stone inside.</p>
<p>Latitude 17° 23' 24".</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Our leader and his brother returned to-day;
they report having been as far north as 56 miles from this camp,
through wretched country, with a further prospect anything but
favourable.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 5 miles north,
crossing the River Lynd at about half-a-mile from last camp, and
at three-quarters of a mile passing a small lagoon. Low sandy
ridges, little or no grass, and densely timbered with tea-tree,
some bloodwood, stringy-bark, and a little box. The river, where
we crossed it, was about 100 yards wide, several channels, and
bed scrubby, 8 to 12 feet deep. We afterwards found that the
river here mentioned as the River Lynd was a branch of the River
Staaten. We have named it "Byerley Creek."</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. F. and A. Jardine, with Binney, Euler,
and Barney, go forward, taking the cattle with them.</p>
<p>This afternoon the long dry grass in which we had unpacked
caught fire, and defied our efforts to put it out. We saw that no
time was to be lost, and by. great exertion removed the packs and
saddles, and sundry scattered articles, to a large ant-hill to
windward of the fire, where the grass was much shorter. There
were only Scrutton, Conderoy, and I in camp, and we worked like
horses, beating the fire down with blankets all round the
ant-hill, Scrutton even rushing to one of two packs burning
furiously and rescuing some flasks of gunpowder, the solder of
the flasks running off at the time. The heat was suffocating, and
we were all nearly leaving everything to its fate several times,
when finally a few billies full of water prevented further
danger. On examining the things that were saved, we found that
every pack had been singed somewhere, and many straps and
surcingles spoiled. <span class="pagenum">{Page 27}</span></p>
<p>6<i>th</i> and 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Some horses still absent.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Found all our horses and travelled about 15
miles N. ½ W.; either barren or very poorly grassed low sandy
ridges, clothed with tea-tree scrub and a kind of brigalow, some
stringy bark, acacia, and bloodwood. Another horse&mdash;one of
those purchased for my use&mdash;unable to travel, poisoned, we
think. We were obliged to leave him behind. Encamped near a small
water-hole, in a sandy dry creek, having sandstone in its
bed.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Similar country to that of yesterday, very
little or no grass, and no water in the dry sandy creeks,
although some was found by digging in their beds; many pandanus
palms grew on their banks. Our general course to-day was N. ½ W.,
16 miles, when we joined the advance party.</p>
<p>We encamped on the north-east bank of a creek (Cockburn Creek,
a branch of Byerly Creek), 50 yards wide, coming from the E.S.E.,
after running it down for half-a-mile from the crossing place.
Its bed is much filled with sandstone and plenty of water. On its
banks grow melaleuca and flooded gum. Floodmarks 8 to 10 feet
above the level of the bed.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 56' 6".</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Messrs. F. and A. Jardine, with Euler,
again leave us, with instructions to continue our course down the
creek for three or four days, should we find water, and there to
encamp and await their return. It would be impossible to continue
travelling northward through this country, and we think there is
a possibility of finding more open travelling near the creek, as
well as grass and water; in fact, this is the only course open to
us. Travelled to-day about 7 miles north-west, crossing the creek
near our last camp, and again near our present one. It contains
some fine water-holes and a good deal of sandstone. Both sides
are densely timbered and poorly grassed. Encamped on the
north-west bank of the creek.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course down the creek for
about 7 miles in a westerly direction, similar to that of
yesterday; water still plentiful in the creek. Encamped on the
south-west bank of the creek, with a forest of bloodwood saplings
behind us, and a little fresh grass.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 51' 31".</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our journey down the creek for
about 6 miles N.W. by W. Its bed becomes more sandy and full of
trees&mdash;melaleuca, nonda, and many others new to me. Water
less plentiful. Encamped near a small water-hole in the creek.
The appearance of the country does not change. We met with the
green-tree ant here in large numbers, and the bite not so painful
as we expected.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 3½ miles N.W. by W.,
encamping near some small lagoons within sight of the creek,
where a little water was also to be found; half-a-mile from creek
low sandy <span class="pagenum">{Page 28}</span> ridges, timbered
with tea-tree. In the neighbourhood of this camp there is a
little fresh grass. Bloodwood, acacia, stringy-bark, and gum, and
nonda.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 46' 5".</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Remained in camp.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our leader returns, telling us he has seen
the Mitchell River, but that the country is wretched, and to the
northward worse, so that we must continue to travel near the
river.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course down the creek for
about 11 miles N.W. by W. The appearance of the country much the
same&mdash;in some places so densely timbered, and so much
undergrowth of trees and small saplings, that it is difficult to
see more than 100 yards in any direction. Encamped in the sandy
bed of the creek, which has two channels, banks not abrupt, 10
feet high, water plentiful, grass long, dry, and poor. Bloodwood,
nonda, acacia, and stringy-bark; in creek, melaleuca and flooded
gum.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 11 miles W.N.W., and
at 5 miles from last camp the creek we have followed (Byerley
Creek) joins the Lynd River(?) which comes from the south-east,
bed 200 yards wide, two channels, sandy, dry, and banks low. We
crossed it and continued our course down its south-west side,
which is quite as densely timbered as the creek we have just
left. (Mr. F. Jardine desires me to name it Cockburn Creek.)
Encamped in the bed of the river, which there has several
channels, and is 300 yards wide.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled down the north-east bank of the
River Staaten, about 4½ miles, N.W. by N.; at this point it joins
a river coming from the E. by S., 300 yards wide, sandy bed,
several channels, water in holes, banks low, sandstone cropping
up in places. We encamped about 3½ miles further on, in a
westerly direction, in the bed of the river, which is broad, and
timbered all across with melaleuca; water only to be found in
holes. A scrubby kind of brushwood grows on its banks, 200 yards
from the river on either side. Flat country covered with
tea-tree, scrub, and desert-grass, no kind of use whatever for
pastoral purposes.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 32' 17".</p>
<p>Although the latitude of the junction of the Lynd and Mitchell
rivers differs slightly from the latitude of the junction we have
just passed, the appearance of a broad river coming from the same
direction confirms me in the opinion I held at the 15th camp that
we were on the River Lynd. The description of country, however,
differs widely from Leichhardt's accounts of the country he saw
on the Lynd, and makes me doubtful, for I am not positively
certain that my longitude at Macdonald's was correct, though I
cannot think it was considerably in error. The only course open
to us at present is to follow this river down to the coast,
leaving it when the country opens sufficiently. <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 29}</span></p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 9½ miles W. ½ S., about one
mile distant from and nearly parallel with the river on its
northern side, encamping near one of the chain of lagoons on its
north side. The horses and cattle get some picking near the edge
of the water; elsewhere the grasses are dry and poor. The bed of
the river is here free from fallen trees, and has some sheets of
not deep water. The banks are scrubby, and in some parts are
water-worn by floods. We saw a little triodia, many kinds of
acacia, and handsome nonda-trees, loaded with fruit. A shower of
rain from the west.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 9 miles due west through
tea-tree forest, flat country. Encamping near the river-bank in
sand, to avoid a shower of rain from the west.</p>
<p>In the evening we were startled by a shout from one of our
black boys, who espied about twenty natives coming up from the
riverbank. The sun was nearly down, and they took care to have
him at their backs. They were fully armed and painted, danced and
shouted a little while like maniacs, and began to throw their
spears. Two shots from our rifles scattered without touching any
of them. Fortunately none of the party were hit, although a spear
passed between Conderoy's legs, quite near enough.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;This morning thirteen of our horses were
missing, so we packed all the available ones, and walking
ourselves, shifted the camp to one of a fine chain of lagoons,
about 3 miles W. by S., one mile from the river on its north
side. At our last camp water was scarce. Here we have abundance,
and a little feed for the horses and cattle. As far as we
ourselves are concerned, this is the best camp we have had. The
country is more open, and a decided improvement in the grasses. A
little box, bloodwood, rusty-gum, and farther from the river
tea-tree levels.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 32' 45".</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Up to this date we remained in camp, while
the black-boys were searching for the horses and some cattle that
had also got away. Recovered our horses this morning and
travelled about 8 miles W.N.W., following the chain of lagoons,
which, lower down, form a creek, encamping near the last. Country
on either side tea-tree levels, near the river scrubby, without a
blade of grass excepting that found on the banks of the lagoons.
The river is distant from camp about 3 miles due south, 150 yards
wide, clear sandy bed, and some sheets of shallow water. The
banks are not abrupt, but water-worn, in places laying bare the
sandstone.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;The chain of lagoons here breaks into a
creek, running W.N.W. ½ W. This we followed for about 9 miles,
and encamped near a small water-hole in creek; no grass for the
horses and cattle, except that growing on the banks of the creek,
and not much there. Soil sandy and exceedingly poor, sandstone
cropping up in creek.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 26' 53".</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 30}</span>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cross the creek and travel about 9 miles
S.W. ½ W. Level country densely timbered with tea-tree; no grass,
and many conical ant-hills, about 3 feet high. Nearer the river
the country opened, and finally after passing through a fringe of
tea-tree saplings, bloodwood and stringy-bark, open forest
fronting the river with plenty of grass and a prospect of
improvement in the country. Stiff clay soil, sandstone cropping
out here and there. Some box, acacias, and nondas. The banks of
the river steep, water in many places.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 11 miles W.N.W. along the
north-east bank of the river, over narrow box-flats fronting the
river with a background of tea-trees. The river-bed is 300 yards
wide at 3 miles from last camp, and at about 9½ miles it is
joined by the creek we left yesterday; plenty of water in the
river. Encamped on its northern bank.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 1.&mdash;Continued travelling down the same side
of the river, at a quarter of a mile from camp crossing a creek
150 yards wide; sandy bed, sandstone cropping up, two channels:
it runs into the river from the N.E. by E. At 3 miles from last
camp many lagoons have been filled by recent rains. At first the
country presented the same desert-like and dry appearance that we
have been accustomed to, but about the lagoons there was some
short fresh grass. The banks of the river are in many places
waterworn by floods, and spinifex grows on them. We encamped near
the river, which is here one channel and one sheet of water 70
yards wide. Flood-marks 14 to 15 feet above the level of the
water, or nearly to the top of the bank.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 27' 26".</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Continued our course down the river about 10
miles W. ½ S. The country becomes scrubby, and spinifex
plentiful. Encamped near the river, which is 300 yards wide,
plentifully timbered with melaleuca, and some sheets of water,
scarcely drinkable. In the vicinity of the camp are some fine
bloodwood and acacias, barringtonia, and rusty-gum.</p>
<p>For some time since I have been much puzzled to account for
the large amount of westing we have been making, and now think
that the Lynd and Mitchell rivers of Leichhardt must have been
much to the eastward of us. The latitude of last camp 16° 27'
26", together with my dead reckoning for longitude, places it
about 40 miles from the coast. There is a broad sandy creek
described by Leichhardt, nearer to the coast, and a little
further south. I believe the river we are on to be the same,
named at its mouth by the Dutch "The Staaten." We saw many ducks
to-day in some water-holes near the river, and a few native
companions.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Travelled down the River Staaten, our
journey being shortened to 6 miles west by a heavy thunderstorm
from the westward. The country we came through to-day gradually
assumed a <span class="pagenum">{Page 31}</span> more cheerful
aspect, being tolerably well grassed, watered by some fine
lagoons, slightly undulating and openly timbered with large
bloodwood, tea-tree, acacia, and box. Encamped about a quarter of
a mile from the river, which here widens to 500 yards, sandy bed,
water 30 yards, 2 feet deep at low tide, which rises and falls
from 1 foot to 18 inches, easily fordable. The banks are low.</p>
<p>Latitude, 16° 26' 38".</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;We remained in camp to-day until 4 o'clock;
everything then packing up. We shifted camp about 2 miles W.N.W.;
at 1½ mile crossing an ana-branch, and another near camp. Plenty
of grass at this as well as our last camp.</p>
<p>The river has many ana-branches, and triodia in its bed. I had
not time to go down to its mouth. Acacia, bloodwood, fig-tree
(loaded with unripe fruit), and many others unknown to me.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leave the Staaten, and travel about 12 miles
N. ½ W. Much of the country we passed through is subject to
inundation. In a shallow watercourse about 2½ miles from last
camp, the flood-marks were as high as 6 feet. Encamped in a dry
swamp&mdash;flood-marks 2 feet on the trees, no water, and very
little grass. In the evening, one of the black boys came into
camp, and reported having found water in a small lagoon about 2
miles distant.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;One-half the horses missing. In the
afternoon, packed up to shift the camp to the lagoon before
mentioned. While packing, an accident occurred which at first
sight would indicate great carelessness. We had with us a mule, a
most useful animal&mdash;his pack one of the heaviest.
Immediately on being packed he slipped off unperceived, which was
the more easy, as the country was so densely timbered. He could
not have been gone 10 minutes when his absence was discovered,
and Sambo at once sent on his tracks; but the mule could travel
faster than Sambo could track him, and we were obliged to give
him up for that day. Our 38th camp was pitched in open
box-forest, flat country, near a small lagoon, which held a
little water quite green with vegetable matter. Two similar
lagoons are in the same creek, 1½ mile up, and half-a-mile down,
respectively. The soil is very hard and dry, but full of
crab-holes; grasses poor and scanty.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;All the horses but two (Lucifer and
Deceiver)&mdash;the mule also&mdash;were found. Deceiver was
found dead; Lucifer, mad, in consequence of excessive thirst, and
drinking salt water. Sambo and Barny were out three days and
nights tracking the mule, but were finally obliged to give him
up. There are here box, bloodwood, acacia, sterculia, and nonda.
Up to this time I have used 6° variation. Here the variation of
the needle is 4° E.</p>
<p>Latitude 16° 13' 45".</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left our 38th camp, and travelled about 12
miles north, over some small brackish plains, intersected by dry
shallow water-courses, and changing with strips of tea-tree
forest and scrub. At <span class="pagenum">{Page 32}</span> 8
miles from last camp we rested near a small creek running
north-west, and holding a little water in holes, while Mr. F.
Jardine, and his brother and Euler, went on a-head to seek water.
Euler came back to us with the news and we continued our course,
encamping on the north bank of Rocky Creek, which has much
sandstone in its bed and plenty of water, and is no doubt a
branch of the Rocky Creek mentioned by Leichhardt. The general
appearance of the country seems to indicate that this has been a
very dry season. We have strong westerly breezes during the day,
falling off soon after sunset. Slight easterly winds spring up at
midnight.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 14½ miles N.E. ½ E.,
slightly undulating country, timbered with tea-tree and
occasional patches of box-forest or stringy-bark, bloodwood, and
apple-gum; grasses slightly improving, but very dry. We were
fortunate in finding a small lagoon directly in our course, in a
small creek running W. by S. The floodmarks in this creek were
nearly on a level with the adjacent country; but the bed is so
irregular, no height above its level could be given.</p>
<p>Latitude 15° 56' 31".</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;The country opened to-day immediately on
leaving last camp, 3 miles of level, open, box-forest, grasses
very dry, then passing through a narrow belt of scrub we came to
broken sandstone ridges, and at about 4 miles from last camp
crossed a deep creek nearly dry, 30 yards wide, running W. by N.
The banks for several hundred yards on both sides much broken and
rocky, with small ana-branches on its south side. Then came 17
miles of plains and patches of open forest-box, bloodwood,
acacia, apple-gum, and bauhinia; soil, hard clay, much cracked
and dried up by heat, grasses on the plains very dry, in the
patches of open forest sometimes fresh and green. This country
is, I think, suitable for pastoral purposes, although we found
the grass much dried and ground cracked by heat.</p>
<p>The horses having had a very long day at 19 miles, we unpacked
near a dry swamp, and sent Euler on a-head to find water, having
seen none since leaving the deep creek, and then a very little.
He returned in about an hour with the welcome news, when we
packed up, and shifted 2 miles further on to a small creek
plentifully watered running W.N.W. Our general course was N.E. 21
miles.</p>
<p>Latitude 15° 45' 30".</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;From the 13th camp it has been customary
for us to travel in the following order: Messrs. F. and A.
Jardine immediately after breakfast rode on a-head and found a
camping-ground; the cattle then followed under the care of Binney
and one or two black boys; the horses were then packed, and
followed the rest in charge of Scrutton, Conderoy, and one or two
black boys, generally passing the cattle at 5 or 6 miles from
camp. I generally rode last of all, finding I could keep the
courses and <span class="pagenum">{Page 33}</span> distances
better there than elsewhere. We had scarcely left camp this
morning when we heard the report of fire-arms in front, and on
riding up to a creek about a mile from camp, found that our
leader and his brother had been attacked by some natives, whom
they soon put to flight. The creek just mentioned held at the
point of attack a deep sheet of water 20 yards broad. A little
higher up we crossed it where the bed was dry. We travelled 5 or
5½ miles north-east, flat country, open forest, many shallow
water-holes quite dry, grasses dense and much better than we had
seen lately. Encamped on a deep creek running N.N.W., its bed in
some parts densely timbered, the foliage rich and luxuriant, in
others there are fine sheets of excellent water. Leichhardt's
melaleuca, fan-leaved palm and fig-trees, some of the latter
bearing ripe fruit, also vines and tropical trees unknown to
me.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Crossed the ana-branch to-day, after
cutting a passage through the vines, and travelled about 7 miles
N.N.E., over box country much divided, and made very irregular by
numerous small ana-branches all subject to inundation, drift in
the trees and marks on the trunks of the box and flooded gum from
2 to 6 feet above the levels of the flats. At about 4½ miles from
camp we crossed the main stream of the Mitchell River, bed 500
yards wide, sandy, and two channels, some water not running,
banks low, and flood-marks above them; the foliage of the trees
on both sides is very dense, and rich in various shades of green.
The latter part of our journey bore some resemblance to a
deserted garden which had contained many choice plants and trees,
acacia, bauhinia, Leichhardt, and fan-leaved palm, the latter
numerous, also cedar.</p>
<p>Encamped on a flooded gum-flat, grasses plentiful, fresh, and
green, but rather coarse.</p>
<p>This country seemed well furnished with game&mdash;black,
whistling, and Burdekin duck, Torres Strait pigeons, native
companions, and many wallabies.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 7 miles over a continuation
of country subject to inundation in consequence of the overflow
of the water of the Mitchell River. Our general course about N.
by W.</p>
<p>About 5 miles from camp our leader with his brother met us,
saying that a number of natives, 70 or 80, had disputed their
passage (they were following the course of an ana-branch holding
a sheet of running water 40 to 50 yards wide, endeavouring to
find a crossing-place), throwing spears at them, some of which
came unpleasantly close.</p>
<p>Our rifles and ammunition were soon in readiness, we could
hear the natives coming up around us, when we advanced to the
attack. Many of them lost the numbers of their mess, but no one
of our party was hit.</p>
<p>A short time afterwards a crossing-place was found higher up
<span class="pagenum">{Page 34}</span> the stream, and we
encamped on the north-east bank of a fine sheet of deep water, 70
yards wide, crossing near its north-west end, where the bed was
of sandstone and above the level of the water. These ana-branches
are all distinguished by a narrow belt of dense foliage.</p>
<p>The grass at our camp is very poor and coarse.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 13 miles N.W. by N.,
leaving the river, and coming on to it again about an hour and a
half before camping. Flood-marks 3 or 4 feet over most of the
country we passed through, which is clothed with box, tea-tree,
and mixed grasses, and has a slight inclination towards the
river, whose banks are worn into perpendicular walls by floods.
No water except in the river for 3 miles out.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 11 miles, for about
7 miles N.N.W., the surface of the land was much worn into
hollows by floods, as the river here overflows its banks. The
north-east bank is 20 feet high and precipitous. At about 7 miles
from last camp we crossed a deep creek coming from the E.S.E., 70
yards wide; water 2 feet wide and running; the banks on both
sides were a little scrubby. After leaving the creek, we
travelled through box and bloodwood open forest, with occasional
patches of tea-tree scrub and spinifex in sandstone washes.
Wherever we find tea-tree, there the grasses become very poor and
water scarce, except in large watersheds. Before reaching camp we
were drenched by a thunderstorm from the north-west. The
camping-ground is a bloodwood and stringy-bark ridge, not within
sight of the river, some grass, not dense, and a little water in
a gully to our left.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Heavy rains and much thunder and lightning
during the night from the north-west. To-day the heat was very
oppressive. Travelled about 10 miles W.N.W.; undulating open
box-forest with small patches of tea-tree scrub: tea-tree away to
the N.N.E. The grasses are fresh and green and tolerably good,
and the country is suitable for pastoral purposes&mdash;should
there be any extent of it. It appears to me, however, to end in
tea-tree forest, and is possibly confined to the vicinity of the
river. At about 3½ miles from last camp, crossed a shallow creek,
100 yards wide, sandstone cropping up in its bed; not running.
Encamped near a lagoon, the river being distant from us about 1
mile W.S.W. The bed is sandy, a quarter of a mile wide, shallow
water nearly all across, banks low; it comes from the S.E. by E,,
and runs W.N.W. From its appearance I should think that the bed
extends still further to the southward.</p>
<p>Could not ascertain the rise and fall of the tide. Some small
fan-leaved palms and mangrove-myrtle grow near its banks.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Just before sundown last night, our black
boys reported that some natives were hovering about not far away,
armed with <span class="pagenum">{Page 35}</span> spears and
watching our movements. In this instance it was thought better to
carry the war into the enemy's camp than to have them throwing
spears at us in the night. Most of our party went after them, and
an exciting chase commenced, so close, that the natives were
obliged to throw away their spears, two dozen of which were
brought into camp. Some are made of reed, and others of hardwood,
and most of them pointed with fish-bones. No one was hurt on
either side.</p>
<p>To-day we left the River Mitchell, and travelled about 16
miles N. ½ W. Marine plains, poorly grassed and divided by
patches of tea-tree forest, sometimes blood wood, barringtonia,
and acacia, or groves of the pandanus palm. Many melon-holes. We
encamped on the north side of a small creek, which holds a little
water; its course is N.W. by W.</p>
<p>As there was no grass, watches were set to keep the
horses.</p>
<p>Latitude 15° 2' 30".</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Travelled to day about 12 miles N.N.W. ½ N.
Slightly undulating tea-tree forest, nothing but desert-grass. At
about 7 miles from our last camp found a little water in a small
creek running W.N.W. Encamped without water, and where the
country was densely timbered with very little grass. Again
watched the horses.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 6 miles N.N.W., encamping
on a bloodwood, stringy-bark low ridge, sandy, but fortunately a
little grass, The poor horses are looking very thin and
hungry.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Christmas Day.&mdash;Travelled N.N.W. ½ N.,
about 13 miles; country slightly undulating. Tea-tree forest, in
some parts a little scrubby, in no part very open. Occasional
patches of bloodwood and stringy-bark forest, in which we found a
little grass. At 6½ miles from last camp crossed a creek, dry
bed, running west, 150 yards wide. We have called it Balourgah
Creek, that, I understand, being the native name for mahogany,
its banks being lined with those trees. Encamped on the south
side of a creek holding plenty of water in rocky holes; much
ironstone in its bed. This we have named Christmas Creek.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 12 miles N.N.W.;
country slightly undulating and a little improved. Bloodwood and
stringy-bark on the ridges. Tea-tree in the hollows, sometimes
scrubby and sometimes swampy, though now dry; a species of
swamp-oak grows there. The soil is becoming more sandy, Encamped
on the south-east side of a fine sheet of excellent water, 80
yards wide, in a creek running W.S.W. Mr. A. Jardine wishes it to
be named Hersey Creek. Near the camp are acacia, bloodwood,
stringy-bark, sterculia, banksia. We have rain now every day; not
enough, however, to prevent our travelling. Indeed the rainy
season seems to have set in. <span class="pagenum">{Page
36}</span></p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 10 miles north.
Bloodwood and stringy-bark more and tea-tree less frequent.
Country slightly undulating. In the Bloodwood Forest there is
some good grass&mdash;not much. Much underwood, and vines and
creepers, nonda, and acacia. In the tea-tree country are some
gigantic ant-hills, chiefly of a conical shape, many of them like
sections of old mud-walls, from 10 to 20 feet high. Encamped in a
tea-tree open flat, having found a little water in a small sandy
creek near us.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 11 miles north, the
first 5 miles slightly undulating. Bloodwood and stringy-bark on
the rises, and tea-tree in the hollows; then crossing a dry creek
160 yards wide, sandstone in its bed, which was of several
channels. The remaining 7 miles box-flats, which are more or less
subject to inundation, and are also much divided by small
watercourses and swamps. Crab and turtle shells strewed the
ground. Pandanus, acacia, and rusty-gum. Encamped on a box-flat,
the water in a small creek near us being brackish.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;We had scarcely encamped yesterday before a
heavy thunderstorm passed over us. The rain was a great boon,
enabling us to fill our billies and cans with good water. It
poured in torrents until midnight, and our tents not being
waterproof we all passed an uncomfortable night.</p>
<p>We have hitherto been obliged to seek water near the coast,
but as it is now to be found everywhere, we think of trying the
interior. We accordingly travelled about 11 miles E.N.E.; at
about 4 miles from camp came to a stream 40 yards wide,
apparently deep water&mdash;tide rising&mdash;followed it up for
1½ mile where it rapidly diminished, and where we crossed it
without difficulty. Box-flats along its southern bank on which
were flood-marks 6 to 8 feet high, the grass being very rank and
sedgy. The remaining 5½ miles undulating, poor, sandy soil at
first, timbered with bloodwood and stringy-bark on the rises, and
tea-tree in the hollows. The grasses on the low bloodwood ridges
much improved. Encamped near a tea-tree swamp.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Remained in camp. Heavy rain again last
night. I should have mentioned that while at our 54th camp, and
during the rain, some natives were observed by our black boys who
came running into camp with the news that they were frightening
and driving the horses. As at our 47th camp a chase had answered
our wishes in sending them away, it was thought best to do the
same here, and the same result followed. The natives, however,
did not go quite so readily in this instance.</p>
<p>31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Our general course to-day was about E.N.E.
½ E., 13 miles. At the distance of nearly 2 miles N.E. from
camp&mdash;ridges tolerably well grassed, timbered with bloodwood
and stringy-bark, we came to a creek&mdash;Kendall Creek&mdash;50
yards wide, steep banks, <span class="pagenum">{Page 37}</span>
and deep water all across. We saw it up for about 3 miles, and
then crossed without unpacking. Continued our course through
bloodwood and stringy-bark forest, alternating with tea-tree.
When about 12 miles from camp, came to another
creek&mdash;Sinclair Creek&mdash;25 yards wide, deep, and
apparently permanent water, waterlilies; it was running W.N.W. We
followed it up one mile, and encamped on the site of an old
native camp. The tea-tree hollows we pass through are now, owing
to the recent rains, becoming swamps, and also very boggy. The
grass in them is always poor; occasionally honeysuckle is to be
met with. The first creek mentioned to-day I have named "Kendall
Creek;" where we crossed, the water was 3 feet deep, running. The
second, whose bed is sandstone, and banks abrupt, but not deep, I
have named "Sinclair Creek."</p>
<p><i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1865.&mdash;We were fortunate to
find a crossing on Sinclair Creek, about one mile N.E. from camp,
the water was there 3 feet deep, running, flood-marks 10 feet
above the surface of the stream, which is beautifully clear. Our
course was then N.E. ½ N., about 13 miles in all, undulating
bloodwood and stringy-bark forest, commencing with a little
tea-tree. At 2 miles from camp, near the top of the ridge,
noticed grass-tree, at that point the grasses were rather poor.
Finally, encamped on a small creek, only a few yards wide, very
much like a cut channel, coming from the north-east, and running
S by E.</p>
<p>The appearance of the country has totally changed, very much
for the better, the grasses are good, though not very dense,
leaving, we think, room for improvement, and the timber is finer.
More than all, however, we are glad to be out of that tea-tree
country, which has been as sore eyes to us ever since we left the
River Einnasleigh. Near the camp are banksia, grevillea,
bloodwood, and stringy-bark.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Soon after arriving in camp a heavy
thunderstorm passed over us from the north-east, which, towards
evening, settled down into a steady rain, lasting until
midnight.</p>
<p>Travelled to-day about 15 miles N.N.E., undulating country,
the ridges being very wide and gently swelling: the soil firm,
chocolate colour; the grasses good, and often dense; the timber
chiefly bloodwood and stringy-bark forest, with much underwood
and vines, sandstone cropping up in places. At about 11 miles
from last camp the forest becomes dense, with a multitude of
small bloodwood and stringy-bark saplings; and at 12 miles the
ridge ended in a valley running north. A little further on came
to a small creek near its head; here were banksia, pandanus, some
young fan-leaved palms, and, round the edge of a small water-hole
in the creek, ferns, the first we have met with. Following the
creek down for about 1½ mile, we camped on the stony rising
ground to the westward near a water-hole in the creek, which is
elsewhere dry. <span class="pagenum">{Page 38}</span> Near the
camp are apple-gum, acacia, bloodwood, stringy-bark, and
mahogany.</p>
<p>Latitude 13° 46' 46".</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 16 miles, N.N.E. ½
N., undulating country, the soil changing several times soon
after leaving camp, becoming light sandy, heavy travelling; and
again before reaching the next camp, firm. The grasses varied
both in density and quality.</p>
<p>At about 3½ miles from camp crossed a deep creek, running to
the W.S.W., bed sandy, steep banks, small stream of good water
running; dense foliage and vines on the banks. We have named this
"Kinloch Creek." At about 7 and 12 miles respectively, we crossed
two small creeks similar to cut channels, the immediate banks of
which were boggy, in each a clear stream of good water. These
small creeks, which probably have their source in springs, have a
fringe more or less wide of banksia, and in them mahogany. The
forest is chiefly bloodwood and stringy-bark, although at
intervals we noticed a little iron-bark, zamia, pines, and
grass-tree.</p>
<p>Latitude 13° 35' 54".</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;We made a shorter stage to-day than
usual&mdash;only 6 miles&mdash;N. ½ W., crossing a deep creek,
100 yards wide, and several ana-branches; bed sandy, with
sandstone cropping up, water not running, but plentiful; dense
foliage, and vines on the banks. Undulating bloodwood and
stringy-bark as far as the creek, which is 5 miles from last
camp; then box, rusty-gum, bloodwood; all open forest. Encamped,
just in time to avoid a heavy shower of rain, near a small creek,
or ana-branch of the last creek.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 14 miles, N. by E.
The first 4 miles, stony ridges, tolerably well grassed; timbered
with bloodwood and stringy bark; then, descending rather abruptly
into a valley, at 5 miles crossed a river running, at that point,
W. by S., 200 yards wide; dry, sandy bed, the banks from 7 to 10
feet above the level of the bed, and flood-marks 8 feet above the
banks. I believe this river to be the same as that one named at
its mouth the Coen by the Dutch. The banks are distinguished by a
line of rich foliage. Mahogany, very fine; some large melaleuca
also growing in the bed, the Leichhardt, and many other fine
trees unknown to me. A box-flat, about one mile in width, with
ana-branches, extended along the north side of the river; the
intervening spaces covered with long, coarse, dense grasses and
sweet-smelling herbs. Continuing our journey, at one mile from
the river passed a fine sheet of water, deep and apparently
permanent, in an ana-branch. The remaining part of the journey
was performed over undulating gradually-ascending country,
timbered chiefly with bloodwood and stringy-bark, not of large
size, sometimes box, acacia, and rusty-gum. <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 39}</span></p>
<p>At about 12½ miles from last camp I obtained a peep at the
surrounding country, which is to the westward level, to the
south-west a short, low range, or rather high ridge, runs north
and south, to the north and north-east high ridges; but the
general view gives an idea of flat country, not a prominent hill
to be seen. Encamped near a small water-hole, in a creek or
watercourse running S.S.E.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 16 miles due north.
Undulating, open box-forest: some iron-bark, bloodwood, acacia,
and sterculia. Pandanus everywhere common. Small deep creeks and
heads of watercourses running to the north-west and W.N.W. At
about 5 miles from camp saw a short range to the eastward,
trending north and south, distant 6 or 7 miles. The grasses are
excellent; indeed, all the undulating country we have passed
through since leaving our 56th camp, should it be found to be
well watered, may be said to be well adapted for pastoral
purposes. It is to be noticed, however, that ice see the country
under its most favourable aspect. Encamped near the head of a
watercourse, holding in a small water-hole a little water; the
edges of the hole distinctly show a stiff yellow clay.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 14½ or 15 miles N. ½
E.; at 1½ mile from camp crossing a creek about 15 yards wide and
25 feet deep; clay bed, nearly dry, and not running. It comes
from the south-east, and half a mile lower down is joined by a
similar deep creek coming from the N.E. by E., which we also
crossed, the banks of both being very steep and covered with
dense luxuriant foliage. Mahogany, Leichhardt, melaleuca, and
many vines and dense long grasses. The north bank of the latter
creek was a high sandstone ridge. Then about 5 miles of level
country, box and apple-gum; many hollows and melon-holes. The
remaining portion of the day's journey was over
slightly-undulating country: bloodwood and acacia, open forest
occasionally, a little tea-tree, and once banksia, fan-leaved
palm, not frequent, pandanus and box, grasses dense and good,
ferns, wild flowers, and creepers and vines along the ground.
Encamped on a small deep creek coming from the S.S.E. and running
N.N.W.; not much water.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;The rains continue every day, and the nights
too cloudy to obtain the latitude. Fortunately, we seldom meet
with very heavy travelling, the soil being firm, except in
gum-flats. We are pushing very hard to reach the settlements
before the floods. We travelled to-day about 18 miles, a little
to the east of north. The first 6 miles undulating, open box and
bloodwood forest, very pretty country; then one mile gum-flat. In
these 7 miles there were many hollows and melon-holes. We then
passed over some higher ridges, on which grow some fine iron-bark
and bloodwood trees; here sandstone was cropping out, Latterly,
undulating <span class="pagenum">{Page 40}</span> open bloodwood
and stringy-bark forest, changing with tea-tree and banksia, all
tolerably well grassed. Encamped on a low ridge (near a tea-tree
swamp), timbered with rusty and apple-gum, bloodwood, and acacia.
It rains while I am writing.</p>
<p>Latitude 12° 38' 2".</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled to-day about 14½ miles north,
through undulating open bloodwood and stringy-bark forest,
changing with tea-tree and banksia-swamps. At about 8 miles from
camp crossed a large deep creek&mdash;"River
Batavia"&mdash;coming from the S.E. by E., and running N.W. by
W., 120 yards broad, sandy bed, 30 feet deep; water very clear
and good, running about 2 feet deep.</p>
<p>The banks were covered with dense foliage and vine-scrub, in
which grow some fine trees. The remaining distance bloodwood and
stringy-bark, changing with tea-tree and banksia. Encamped near
Tea-Tree Swamp.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leave our 65th camp and travel about 2½
miles N.N.E.; soil very boggy after the heavy fall of rain.
Ridges timbered with bloodwood and stringy-bark, hollows with
bloodwood and gum. The cattle had preceded us, but many of them
bogged when crossing a shallow watercourse&mdash;the gently
sloping banks of which were very boggy&mdash;the water knee-deep,
running N.N.W. After unpacking the horses we crossed them with
some difficulty, and succeeded in getting all the cattle out but
two&mdash;one a very fine fat bullock. These were killed, the
former serving us with meat, and encamped on fine ground near the
creek to cure what was not eaten, which was done by jerking
it.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our journey to-day in a N.N.E.
direction; very heavy travelling. At about 2 miles from camp we
came to a creek about 15 yards wide; water nearly bank and bank;
current very strong, running to the N.W. by W. Crossed our packs
and saddles and other things by felling a tree, which did not
quite reach across, and obliged us to be very quick as the water
was rising rapidly.</p>
<p>We then packed up and endeavoured to continue our course, but
we had scarcely left the ridge forming the north-east bank of the
creek when a heavy storm broke over us. We were now in a gum and
bloodwood flat, and the ground soon ankle-deep in water; the
clayey soil became boggy, and many of the horses sunk under their
burdens and were unable to rise: one we were compelled to leave,
as, after lifting her out of the bog, she was too weak to
stand.</p>
<p>Returned to the ridge near the creek, and encamped about half
a mile above the crossing-place.</p>
<p>Poisonous grass or herbs at this camp; cattle were not
affected by it. We did not see the Flinders poisonous plant at
any part of our journey. <span class="pagenum">{Page
41}</span></p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Remained in camp to-day to dry everything.
This morning two of our horses were found dead, Rasper and
Marion, occasioned, we think, by poisonous grass or herb; and in
the course of the day several other horses showed symptoms of
being attacked by a similar disorder. Excessive sweat, blindness,
and contraction of the stomach, and, I think, thirst, as all
endeavoured to reach the water,</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning discovered four more horses
dead. Our horses were now twenty in number, so that we were
reduced to the necessity of walking. So, ridding the packs of as
much useless lumber as possible, we packed all the horses and
proceeded on foot. It was found necessary that one should ride
with the cattle, that being Binney's duty. We walked through
bloodwood and stringy-bark forests, intersected by tea-tree and
pandanus water-courses: in these the horses frequently bogged; so
much was this the case on coming to a gum-flat that we were
compelled to unpack everything and carry the packs and saddles to
a low ridge, having travelled about 9½ N.E. by N. While
travelling another good packhorse died, and shortly after
reaching camp another.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 7 miles N.E. by N.;
undulating country, intersected by small watercourses full of
water, and running generally about south-east. Sandstone cropped
up on the ridges, which are timbered with bloodwood, iron-bark,
apple-gum, and pomegranate. Some zyamia, and the ground is
everywhere covered with ferns, and, near the watercourses,
mosses. The grasses are good, but not dense. The grasses in this
country are generally known as blue and Isaac's grass. The
hollows are boggy, and the timber generally met with in them is
bloodwood, tea-tree, gum, and pandanus.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;We had a very heavy storm yesterday
afternoon, commencing a little after midday and raining for three
hours. The hardest rain we have had. Remained in camp to-day to
dry our belongings. The rain had scarcely ceased when some
fifteen or twenty natives came near the camp. They were unarmed,
made a great noise, and talked, gesticulating vehemently. They
would not allow us to come near,&mdash;that is, on our approach
they retreated, and finally, getting their spears, came up with
the intention of attacking us. Two shots only were fired; some of
our party then chased them, the natives, however, soon outrunning
everybody. They use the wommerah to throw their spears, which are
pointed with fishbone; the shaft being made of hardwood.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leave our 69th camp and walk about 15½
miles N. by E., walking over some high ridges, or one might
almost say low ranges; there does not appear to be a distinct
range, merely a succession of gradually-ascending ridges, which
are not well grassed. The forest is not open: bloodwood and
stringy-bark, <span class="pagenum">{Page 42}</span> apple-gum,
grevillea, young pandanus, and zamia. At about 5 miles from camp
we descended gradually into a valley and crossed, the horses
bogging a little; a smaller stream of excellent water running to
the west. A little further on a deeper creek, bed sandy and firm,
water also running knee-deep in the same direction. On the north
bank of this creek, which formed the slope of a high ridge, were
growing box, stringy-bark, apple-gum, bloodwood, and acacia. The
creek itself is probably one of the heads of the River
Batavia.</p>
<p>About 5½ or 6 miles beyond this point we came to a deep creek
with steep banks, the water running slowly to the W. by N. We
found a shallow crossing, and passed over without difficulty;
flood-marks 20 feet above the bed. On the banks grow vines,
melaleuca, and mahogany.</p>
<p>Next passing over a bloodwood and stringy-bark ridge; many
vines, much underwood, and little grass. We encamped on the north
side of a deep creek, 10 yards wide, water knee-deep, and running
slowly to the westward; banks steep, and timbered with gigantic
melaleuca, mahogany, seaforthia, palm, fruit, and other trees
unknown to me.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 15½ miles north; at 2½
miles from camp crossing a deep creek, banks steep, water
knee-deep, running south-west, sandstone in its bed. At 4½ miles
from camp reached the top of a low range, heading S.W. by W. Our
ascent commenced with the day's journey. Some of these ridges are
stony, with poor grass; and some sandy, with much underwood and
vines, making walking laborious; passed some gigantic ant-hills
of bright red earth, the colour sometimes approaching vermilion,
25 to 30 feet high. The timber chiefly bloodwood and
stringy-bark, with grevillea, and occasionally apple-gum. At
about 8½ miles from camp crossed a small creek running to the
westward, flood-marks not high; and at 10½ miles descended into a
valley. From this point we saw a low range to the north-east,
distant about 5 or 6 miles, heading apparently south-east and
north-west. Encamped on the north-east bank of a shallow creek;
clear excellent water running to the north-west. During the
latter part of our walk the soil became more loose and sandy,
ending at the descent into the valley in white sand, poor grass,
banksia; near the creek, pandanus, and a palm-tree, whose leaf is
like a star, radiating naturally from the stem, and not split by
the wind. While travelling, another horse died.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;We found two other horses had died this
morning from the effects of the poison&mdash;whatever it may
be&mdash;which they had taken at the 67th camp. These poor brutes
foamed very much at the mouth, and were continually walking round
until they dropped. Our horses now numbered fifteen, and we were
obliged to throw <span class="pagenum">{Page 43}</span> away two
empty saddles. Walked to-day about 11½ miles N.N.E., crossing
several high ridges, trending generally N.W. by W., the creeks
and watercourses between them being deep and narrow; some of the
ridges were scrubby, all densely clothed with underwood and vines
wherever stringy-bark was seen; all also either very poorly
grassed or barren. Eleven miles from camp the top of the ridge
was free from trees, and for ten miles to the northward nothing
but brushwood to be seen. Encamped near a deep creek in a ravine
running generally W.S.W.; water excellent. We passed to-day a
great deal of banksia and grass-tree; in the creeks, were
mahogany, pandanus, tea-tree, and the star-leaved palm.</p>
<p>Latitude 11° 46' 36".</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 8 miles N.N.E. ½ E.,
crossing many gullies, in every one of them a stream of clear
sparkling water, cool and excellent. No trees, with the exception
of stunted banksia, except in the ravines; brushwood in white
sand, no grass. At about 5½ miles from camp entered a bloodwood
and stringy-bark forest, very dense underwood, and vines; a mile
further on more open. Encamped near a rivulet running N.E. By
climbing a tree to the eastward, on the top of the ridge, I saw
the coast-line to the east and south-east, distant about 10
miles. The country lying between us and the sea appears to be
flat and covered with brushwood. The coast-line is marked by
white sand-hills. There is some grass, not by any means dense, in
the neighbourhood of the camp. With regard to the small streams
of running water near the top of the range, their banks were in
all instances boggy and covered with mosses and ferns.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;On leaving camp to-day we endeavoured to
travel north, but were foiled at 2 miles from camp by a dense
impenetrable scrub; returning towards our yesterday's camp about
half a mile, then about half a mile east, to the eastern slope of
the range. At this point the sea was distinctly visible: a bay to
the south-east, the projecting point of land bearing
S.S.E.&mdash;Cape Grenville, probably. It is difficult to tell
the trending of the Richardson Range. To the northward it appears
to be N.N.E.; to the southward its outline cannot be seen.
Continuing our course down a spur of the range, which is very
stony (ironstone), we encamped near a small creek, running water,
to the eastward. The course of the stream is marked by a line of
small trees and dense foliage. From a point on the spur of the
range, near the camp, I got the prismatic bearing of Cape
Grenville, 117°.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;The grass was good at the camp we left
to-day, and was much needed by the horses and cattle. We walked
to-day 7½ miles N.N.E. in about 6½ hours, crossing four deep and
narrow creeks running generally east, and between them spurs of
the coast <span class="pagenum">{Page 44}</span> range, or rather
dividing range. Every one of these creeks is full of dense
vine-scrub, and through which we were obliged to cut a path. The
scrub in some places quite impenetrable. One vine in particular,
the long fine tendrils of which were covered with hooked thorns,
was most annoying. The foliage of the trees, which are tall, has
a very tropical appearance; some fruit-trees, seaforthia, and
star-leaved palm. The spurs of the range are either stony or of
white sand: in the former instance not badly grassed, in the
latter without grass and covered with brushwood, mahogany,
banksia, pandanus frequent, tea-tree occasionally.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 10 miles north. About 2
miles from camp, I ascended a bluff spur of the range, and saw
the sea quite plainly at about 8 miles distant; to the north a
short range trending east and west, distant from 14 to 18 miles.
All the country we can see from this point, included between the
north and south-east points, appears to be either scrubby or
covered with brushwood.</p>
<p>We had only to cut paths through four or five creeks to-day,
and at about 4 miles were off the range, which tails out towards
the north-west very gradually. The soil is white sand, and grass
rare; forest country, with dense underwood alternating with more
open ridges, covered with brushwood or grass-tree, banksia,
pandanus. We were twice pushed out of our course to the westward
by dense pine-scrubs. Water is plentiful; every creek on this
side of the range has a stream of cool, clear, running water in
it. Encamped amidst some open brushwood near a small creek
running east; rocky bed; not in time to avoid a heavy shower of
rain from the eastward.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 9½ miles N.W. by N.;
fewer creeks, otherwise the country is similar to that of
yesterday. Some of the underwood very dense and difficult to walk
through; grass-trees very plentiful. Pine-scrub to our right, at
about 5 miles from camp, stretching away to the eastward. At
about 9 miles from last camp emerged out of some very dense
brushwood into undulating forest, with grass enough for a camp.
We therefore pitched our tents near a tea-tree watercourse,
similar to those we saw on the western watershed. We passed
to-day pines, mahogany, a species of oak, rough-leaved fig, and
other tropical trees. Many ferns and mosses in the creeks.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 4½ miles north. At 3½
miles from camp came to a creek 10 yards wide, 8 to 10 feet deep,
banks abrupt, bed of white sand, water 2 feet deep, running. Soon
after skirting this creek, which runs N. by W., the
country&mdash;which had previously been scrubby or covered with
brushwood&mdash;improved. The soil&mdash;before white
sand&mdash;became richer, and of a chocolate colour; the grass
dense and good. While travelling a <span class="pagenum">{Page
45}</span> very heavy thunderstorm caused the creeks to rise very
rapidly, preventing us from continuing our journey.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked about 10 miles N. 16° W., crossing
several deep and narrow creeks, each distinguished by a dense
vine-scrub. At 3 miles from camp the soil again changed to white
sand; and again we walked through heath, brushwood, and scrub,
the latter part of the day's journey being performed in heavy
rain. Encamped on a gently-sloping sandy ridge, timbered by a few
stunted trees&mdash;banksia, grass-tree, and pandanus; not much
grass either for horses or cattle. A small watercourse to the
southward, and near the camp, runs eastward.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leave our 79th camp and travel about 10½ or
11 miles N.W. by W., at 1½ mile from camp, coming to and
following the course of the River Jardine, which, I think, is the
Escape. It enlarges very rapidly, many creeks coming into it from
the southward; the north-east bank is lined for several miles by
a dense scrub, the south-west bank being densely
timbered&mdash;oaks, tea-tree, heath and brushwood; in some
places much underwood and pandanus. Walking is tedious and
difficult. We all suffer from sore feet. Various methods are
tried to walk comfortably; some have boots, some are barefooted,
others use pieces of blanket; then again a kind of sandal was
invented, and found to answer very well. Although much hindered
by the scrubby creeks, we endeavour to push on, in rain or
sunshine. Encamped on a large stream, 40 to 50 yards wide, coming
from the S.W. by S., and joining the river half a mile below our
camp. The river is here 60 yards wide, swollen by the recent
rains, although yet 8 feet below the top of the banks, which are
very irregular, and broken by small tea-tree creeks coming in
from the S.S.W.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Found a shallow crossing-place of the
creek, near which we encamped, and were able to carry everything,
over safely, swimming the horses and cattle. We then continued
our course about 5 miles north-west, through country partly
scrubby, partly forest, tolerably well grassed. The ground
everywhere much covered by vines, shrubs, and herbs. Crossed two
scrubby creeks near their junction with the river. Higher up the
scrub continued for a mile beyond these creeks. Encamped near the
river on the south bank of a narrow deep creek coming from the
N.W. by W. The river widens rapidly, being here 100 yards wide,
banks abrupt, and not heavily timbered. The vine creeks we have
crossed have in their scrubs many wild and some luscious-looking
fruits, many eatable and good. These would no doubt improve with
cultivation. More game is to be found here than we have seen for
a long time; kangaroo, wallaby, scrub and plain turkeys,
pheasants, black cockatoos, parrots, and many pigeons.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our course to-day was very winding,
generally about <span class="pagenum">{Page 46}</span> N.W. by
W., distance about 12. miles. The river ran very much to the
eastward, and had a very scrubby frontage to its north-west bank.
About 3 miles from camp we came to an open heath extending to the
north-east, the country being still a succession of ridges, some
of which are tolerably well grassed; on others there is much
underwood, sometimes heath and brushwood. It may be said in a
general way of the country we have seen on the east coast, that
it is composed of sandy ridges, not often grassed, but clothed
with heath and brushwood, or scrubby.</p>
<p>The rains are heavy, and commenced always about mid-day, the
nights being now fine and clear. This day's journey seemed to be
very heavy for the horses, several of them knocked up on the road
and were left behind.</p>
<p>Encamped near the river, the last 1½ mile of the journey being
more open. It is the stated intention of the leader to wait here
a week to rest ourselves, as well as the cattle and horses.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. Frank Jardine, his brother, and Euler
leave us, and go on ahead to find the settlement. My dead
reckoning places our present camp about 19 miles south from
Somerset, and 8 miles from the mouth of the Escape River, as
shown in the tracing.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Our leader returns. His report
is as follows:&mdash;"He followed the river down, having
travelled 30 <i>miles west</i> and 20 <i>miles north</i>. He then
turned back, believing it to be the western waters. The river,
whose width is here 100 yards, he tells us is 300 yards wide; 30
miles lower down another branch coming in from the southward,
that the main stream makes a great bend to the west and
south-west, in one place running S.S.E. He would not be surprised
if it is the Batavia." This proves at any rate that my estimated
distances are incorrect, that is, since we have been, obliged to
walk.* This is not to be wondered at when it is remembered that
we have had a difficult country to walk through, that our
stoppages were frequent in consequence of the horses bogging and
being dragged out, having also to cut roads through most of the
scrubby creeks in our way. I do not think the error in latitude
more than 15 miles. For many camps I have been unable to obtain
the latitude. The sextant has been shaken out of adjustment or
the run injured, and no opportunity has yet offered of putting it
into order. We do not see the sun, both days and nights being now
rainy&mdash;not heavy rain, but continuous. The river has not
risen more than 1 foot since we have been encamped here; at its
lowest, the depth of water above the level of the bed was about 5
feet. It is now rising rapidly.</p>
<p class="foot">[* I afterwards found that these distances were
incorrect, the <i>true distances</i> west and north respectively
from the 82nd camp to the point in our track, where the leader
turned back, are about 24 W. and 7 N.]</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 47}</span>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;On the night of the 4th I was enabled to
obtain the true latitude of this camp, having previously adjusted
the sextant as well as possible. I found the plate at the back of
the horizon-glass broken. Latitude 82nd camp, 11° 11' 39", or
about 33 miles south of Cape York&mdash;probably 26 miles south
of the settlement. Mr. F. Jardine, his brother, and Euler cross
the river, and again leave us to seek the settlement. We expect
to see them on Saturday or Sunday next.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;A most lovely, clear, fine day. We hope the
weather is breaking.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Heavy thunderstorm from the N.W.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>, 9<i>th</i>, and 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Fine days,
thundering a little in the afternoon; the river going down
rapidly; the bed is sandy, many snags, and the banks abrupt, not
deeper than 15 to 20 feet, lined with melaleuca and mahogany. The
immediate frontage to the river, say 200 to 300 yards, is more or
less well grassed and timbered, with nonda, bloodwood, and
tea-tree. To the westward, beyond that distance, the country is
undulating, white sandy soil, no grass, partly open heath, with
banksia, brushwood, and pandanus, partly scrubby, and appears to
be the same as far as one can see. I am told by one of the party,
a native of Sydney, that this country and that in the
neighbourhood of Sydney are exactly similar.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our leader returns a second time
unsuccessful; he tells me that he proceeded in a direct line
N.N.E., intending to strike the coast and follow its bends until
he reached the settlement. He was on the coast near the mouth of
the Escape River; saw Newcastle Bay and Mount Bemer; could not
cross the river, so many mangroves&mdash;so much mud and other
disagreeable things. He further says that the river is more than
one mile wide at the mouth, from which point he followed it up
towards its source for 53 miles,* it was there 300 yards wide,
unapproachable by reason of mangroves and mud. Their horses
knocked up the second day after they left us, and they were
obliged, they tell us, to walk back, after being almost within
sight of the place of our destination. They describe the country
as wretched, compared with which that we have passed through was
a paradise&mdash;that we know was bad enough. They found nothing
but scrub and brushwood&mdash;no grass whatever&mdash;near the
coast mangroves <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">[* I see in the account of Mr. Kennedy's
expedition the Escape River is about 16 or 17 miles long.]</p>
<p>Our opinions are now changed; there is no doubt that the
river, near which we are encamped, is the Escape, and our best
plan is to follow it until it bends to the eastward.</p>
<p>All our provisions are now gone with the exception of 10 lbs.
of <span class="pagenum">{Page 48}</span> flour. The sugar lasted
up to this camp. Most of the tea was burnt at the 16th camp, the
remnant that was saved there would have lasted some time with
care, but even that was lost with the mule at the 37th camp; from
that point we boiled the sugar and water together and drank it
instead of tea. Now we are reduced to jerked meat and water.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;It was finally resolved to continue our
journey down the river as far as the head of the tide. The horses
are looking wretched, and are evidently almost worn out, we are
therefore obliged to leave several packsaddles and other rubbish.
Walked about 8½ or 9 miles W.N.W. The course of the river is very
tortuous, the banks from 10 to 12 feet average height above the
surface of the stream, which is quite free from fallen trees,
although an occasional snag is seen in the shallows. Tea-tree
swamps run parallel with, and are only divided from, the river by
its bank. The country is nowhere open nor well grassed, sometimes
scrubby, often much underwood and brushwood. Floodmarks 10 to 12
feet above the water.-Encamped on the river-bank.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked about 7 miles W. by N., leaving the
river-bank at about one mile from camp to avoid a scrub, and
travelling through country very poorly grassed&mdash;banksia,
heath, and brushwood&mdash;undulating white sandy soil, not
boggy, although recent heavy rains have made it very wet. Near
the river the soil is sometimes much richer, and there are
occasional patches of better grass. The river timber is
melaleuca, and mahogany, white bloodwood, nonda, tea-tree, grow
in its immediate neighbourhood. Encamped on the bank of a creek,
15 yards wide, immediately after crossing it near its junction
with the river. It has a sandy bed, water running 2 feet
deep&mdash;banks abrupt, but not deep.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our journey from camp 84, walking
about 9½ miles west. The whole river frontage is not by any means
open; yet we were compelled to follow its windings&mdash;so many
swamps run parallel with it, sometimes forming a permanent
lagoon, and sometimes running into the river by a shallow gully.
At 8 miles from camp, crossed a large creek 30 yards wide, sandy
bed, sandstone cropping up. We unpacked, and carried everything
over at the shallowest place we could find, where the water was
running beautifully clear, five feet deep. At some points the
ground is covered by dense grass and vines, bloodwood, nonda,
mahogany, tree-tea, and banksia. Encamped on the river-bank.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 8½ miles W.N.W.,
keeping close to the river for about 5 miles, when a boggy swamp
obliged us to leave the river-bank. It was at this point that our
leader and his brother turned back, concluding that this river
ran into the west coast, without having seen anything definite.
As before mentioned, they told me they had travelled 20 miles
north, and 30 <span class="pagenum">{Page 49}</span> miles
west&mdash;a glance at the map will show this to have been an
error. The next three miles we walked through wretched country,
heath and brushwood, banksia and scrub, pandanus frequent. Our
path was about one mile from the river from which we were
separated by a densely-timbered swamp. The last half-mile
following a ridge which brought us down to the river, and better
grass, this being a good camp for the horses and cattle.</p>
<p>The river here overflows its banks, more particularly the
north-eastern one, during floods.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 9 miles north, almost
at starting we crossed a creek 15 yards wide, water running 6
feet deep; its bed is sandy, sandstone cropping up, and it comes
apparently from the southward.</p>
<p>After crossing the creek, we continued travelling near the
river, having a high ridge, timbered with bloodwood and
stringy-bark, on our left hand; it was also clothed with many
vines and much underwood, and extended for one mile due north.
After this, the features of the country were similar to those
previously mentioned&mdash;a mixture of swamp and scrub,
brushwood and underwood. Encamped quite close to the river, whose
waters appear to be affected by the tide&mdash;a slight rise and
fall being perceptible at intervals. We have been expecting the
river to turn to the eastward latterly, and are somewhat
doubtful, now, where it will run. My dead reckoning places our
present (the 87th) camp about 7 or 8 miles from the coast, and 32
miles, in a direct line S.W. by W., from the settlement.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;After staying at the 87th camp to kill and
jerk some beef, we continued our journey to-day, walking about 6
miles north-west. The swamps became less frequent, and the grass
improved. We were much disappointed to find the river turning to
the westward, being finally brought to a standstill by a creek 15
yards wide, coming apparently from the south. Here we see
mangroves and a tidal mark, showing a rise and fall of 3 feet;
here we encamped. From the top of a ridge on the other or western
side of the creek, one of the Jardines, by climbing a tree, saw
the mouth of the river, at the distance of 2 miles. He tells me
he saw Prince of Wales Island quite distinctly, and that the
river-mouth is one mile wide. This is conclusive, and we must now
retrace our steps and cross the river. Had not our horses been in
so low a condition&mdash;some of them being scarcely able to
walk&mdash;some one would have gone a-head and prevented the
whole party travelling so far out of its course.</p>
<p>Latitude 10° 56' 14".</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Returned to the 87th camp.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Heavy rains; the river rising rapidly.</p>
<p>Mr. F. Jardine and his brother, with Euler, swam across the
<span class="pagenum">{Page 50}</span> river, taking with them 5
horses, and start on another excursion to find the
settlement.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i> to 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Heavy rains continuing night
and day almost without intermission. River has risen to within
one foot of the top of the bank at camp, having overflowed its
banks in many places, both up and down the river.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Shifted camp on to a low ridge
about one mile down the river. Rains cease. One of the weak
horses, Lady Scott, died.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;The Messrs. Jardine return with good news.
They had no difficulty in finding Somerset, having met with two
of the blacks, who guided them. They tell us they accomplished
the distance in from 35 to 37 miles. Every one very glad to see
them, as we were beginning to feel the effects of living on
jerked meat and water.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made a punt by covering a frame with
bullock-hide, and crossed everything dry but the last load, which
consisted of pack-saddles. Encamped on the east bank of the
river, which had fallen 7 feet.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leave our last camp in much better spirits
than we have enjoyed latterly, walked about 10 miles N.E. by E.
The first 3 miles a mixture of swamp, brushwood, and heath, white
sandy soil, banksia, and tea-tree. Then 7 miles undulating
country, the ridges of chocolate-coloured soil, grass tolerably
good, vines and underwood, timbered with bloodwood and
stringy-bark.</p>
<p>In the valleys the soil is white sand, grasses poor, banksia
and tea-tree. About 4½ miles from last camp we unpacked
everything and crossed a creek 6 yards wide, running 5 feet deep,
coming from the south; bed, level, of sandstone; banks low and
abrupt. On crossing the creek, one of the weak horses could not
stand, and we were obliged to leave him to his fate. Had not five
horses in good condition been brought out from the settlement, we
must have left most of our goods and chattels behind.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 9 miles N.E. by E. High
ridges tolerably well grassed, and crowded with dense
vine-scrubs. Swamps in the hollows, sometimes hidden by dense
brushwood. Water everywhere plentiful.</p>
<p>Encamped on the south-eastern slope of a well-grassed ridge,
having a swamp beneath, and a small vine-scrub above us.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Some natives came to the camp during the
morning, and were sent away to bring some fish in exchange for
tobacco. Five of them returned in the evening, each bringing his
supply of shellfish, receiving some tobacco, of which they are
all very fond, in return. They smoked the leaf by inhaling a long
draught from a piece of bamboo, which is previously filled by
means of a tube made of a large green leaf in which a leaf of the
weed is rolled, <span class="pagenum">{Page 51}</span> lit, and
the smoke blown into the bamboo. This singular method of smoking
had great effect on them, making them very stupid.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked 7½ or 8 miles N.E. by N. Undulating
country, bloodwood and stringy-bark, moderately well
grassed&mdash;sometimes vines, underwood, and ferns, occasionally
scrubby. Encamped on the slope of a ridge overlooking a small
lake to the southward, its native name is Chapegwynya, pronounced
ass pelt. Alligators have been seen in the lake. Noticed nonda,
Moreton Bay ash, tea-tree, and mahogany. Passed many old native
camps, the ground being covered with shells.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked to-day about 7½ miles north-east;
alternately scrubby and open forest, high ridges timbered chiefly
with bloodwood, tolerably well grassed. In the valleys, white
sandy soil, tea-tree and banksia, and poor grasses; water
everywhere plentiful. At about 4 miles from, camp we rested on
the north bank of a larger lake than Chapegwynya, named Boronto,
Here Mr. Jardine met us. He had just ridden out from Somerset. He
had selected a good camp near the coast, about two miles from
Somerset, at Vallack Point, which we reached in the evening.</p>
<p>The scrubs abound with turkeys and wallabies, and occasionally
megapodii are met with.</p>
<p>The site of the town of Somerset seems to be admirably
selected on the south-west side of a channel, averaging perhaps
800 yards width, which divides Albany Island from the main land.
The coast-line is very irregular. Ridges, 100 to 150 feet above
the sea-level, end abruptly in the channel, separating small
sandy or muddy bays; the shore of Albany Island also presenting
similar indentations and projections. The ridges are generally
clothed with scrub, although on the south-east side of the town
the slopes are bald. The land between the ridges slopes down
gently to the beach of each bay, being in some instances more
openly timbered. Small fresh-water streams or rivulets find their
way slowly to the sea. Good water is also to be found by digging
a few feet deep in the hollows. The soil is very poor white sand,
although vines and shrubs grow very luxuriantly in the scrubs
which cover much of the neighbouring country. On the ridges the
soil is very thin, ironstone frequently cropping out. Sandstone,
too, is laid bare, by the weather and time, immediately above
high-water mark. The views are picturesque from any point, and
are a great relief to the eye after travelling for five months
through nothing but forest.</p>
